This archive contains a Executable of LHA and an archive with the source
and the addapted Makefile so one can compile under Linux.

I (The Sender of this File) would like to see this archive added to the
archive of Linux Programs.

I hope it is of any use to someone out there!

For any questions I'm reacheable by E-Mail under

m2c6@sci.kun.nl (At least until June 1992).
