	Linux -- The free Minix like Un*x clone is here.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	This file is updated constantly.
	NOT to be published ... contains unreleased information.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	For hackers only Linux version 0.12 code and sources
	available here.

	nic.funet.fi will also be site for Linux binaries,

	Directory structure:

		INSTALL		contains everything you should
				have to get Linux up and running.

		bin		binaries for /bin, /usr/bin and
				/usr/contrib/bin
		doc		documents and man pages
		images		boot and root images etc.
		kernel		kernel and driver sources
		lib		lib sources
		tools		tools for hackers, not for common
				use
		xtra		community contributed diffs and
				utilities.
		incoming	you can FTP 'put' your stuff here,
				see next section for putting.

	Check file 'ls-laR', which contains "ls -laR" listing.

	Eh ... for people having question 'but my site doesn't
	have FTP' ...

		Just mail to 'mailserver@nic.funet.fi' and put
		command "help" to mail _body_ (body is the part
		where you write your messages/text and is not
		related to mail header, which contains lines
		like 'To: foobar').

		Mailserver is not official .. it's under testing,
		to it might work or not, but don't flame me about
		it ... I take only 'thanks' mails (nice to get them
		for work you didn't do ;-)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Putting Linux stuff to nic.funet.fi ...

		Please use directory /pub/OS/Linux/incoming

		Please use FTP command "binary" for binary i.e.
		stuff like *.tar, *.tar.Z, or runable binaries etc.

		Our FTP is _hacked_, so you or anybody won't
		see the stuff in there, until I enable it. I try
		to check directories constantly, but you might
		also want to throw me a mail ?-)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	If you are willing to support Linux development,
	please "mail arl@hut.fi" .. and tell what goodies
	you are willing to do - I try to organize.

	Or you might use mailing list ...

	Or you might want to send mail directly to
	'torvalds@cs.helsinki.fi'

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Linux mailing list (is _MANUALLY_ kept) addresses:

		For subscribing and unsubscribing:

			linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi

		For mailing real articles:

			linux-activists@niksula.hut.fi

	Please, do NOT send subscribe/unsubscribe mails to
	linus-activist@niksula.hut.fi, or I and other people
	will *flame* you, and you'll notice, how your mailbox
	filled up ;-). You even might get dozens of copies
	of netiquette from net users ...

	How to find out, who's on the list ?

	Just "telnet joker.cs.hut.fi 25" ('25' or 'smtp')
	tell our smtp, you want to "vrfy linux-activists", then
	you have the list of users. Say "quit" to quit.

current status can be asked with "finger torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi"
here's sample entry:

Free UNIX for the 386 - coming 4QR 91 or 1QR 92.

Most system calls are now implemented (including mount/umount), and they
are almost POSIX, so porting programs to it is relatively easy.  The
official version has still no floppy support, but that will be out next
week (and there is a update already, though not official).  It still
needs minix to be installed (stand-alone boot-floppy coming this month).

Linux can now be gotten by anonymous ftp from 'nic.funet.fi' in the
directory '/pub/OS/Linux'.  The same directory also contains some binary
files to run under Linux.  Currently gcc, bash, update, uemacs, tar,
make and fileutils.  Several people with minix have gotten a running
system, but it's still a hackers kernel.

There is also a mailing list set up 'Linux-activists@niksula.hut.fi'.
To join, mail a request to 'Linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi'.

Mail for more info.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	At HUT (Helsinki University of Technology) I try to
	use students for programming work to make Linux better.

	So could you, if you are teacher. Linux might be
	even more suitable for teaching purposes than Minix.

	My experiencies with Minix are not promising, I got about
	1/3 of given projects back i.e. 2/3 were unfinished.
	Projects were like 'create symlinks to Minix' or
	'do a device driver for XX adapter'.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Some of the features I'd like to have (maybe I'll also
	code them):

		o	adding some features from my own OS.
			- STREAMS I/O, now only subset
			- Kernel development environment
				Should be like configuring
				BSD kernel.

		o	Socket stuff from BSD.
		o	BSD net stuff or Xkernel.

		o	Mach. I try to check what's usable in Mach.
				I took keyboard stuff from Mach
				to my own OS, but floppy stuff
				was too complicated (spaghetti-code),
				so I coded it again.
				Maybe some parts of kernel is also usable.

		o	Portability
		o	Modularity
				Like device drivers should have
				multiple levels; high/medium for
				abstraction and low level for
				specific card/chip support.
