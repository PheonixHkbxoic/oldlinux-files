We need to make installation REAL SIMPLE AND FAST. I suggest the
following standard for distributing ported programs.

Everything should be contained in a [compressed] tar file with a:

  - README, a short explanations of how this version differs from
    the original, if it does, and how it was compiled.

  - PREREQUIST, again which kernel, but also which version of the
    original.

[* Let's call this PREREQ so we can all spell it *]

  - Makefile, not for compilation, but for installation!! After having
    checked that you agree with paths and so, you just type 'make install'
    perhaps as root.

  - Patches, context diff against the original.

  - Binaries

  - Optionally, manual pages, also with full path.

Kernel patches should also be a [compressed] tar file containing:

  - README, describing what the patch does/is.
  - PREREQUIST, a precise statement of which version of the
    kernel the patches applies, and which, if any, patches that
    was already applied.

[* Begin Soap Box:
	I don't think we should distribute kernel patches in the standard
	release trees, unless there is a DEFINITE (fatal) bug fixed by the
	patch.  Most people are looking for an easy-to-build system with
	binaries and sources that they can get up-and-running without much
	trouble.  Yes, we have to put together kernel patch kits, but we
	need to have them coordinated (all patches in one common patchfile).
   End Soap Box *]

Sources belong in /usr/src, linux sources in /usr/src/linux, etc.

Maybe we should split patches and binaries, but I don't like that, as you
would properbly end up having only one of either.

[* It is my feeling that we should not distribute patches without the source
	that the patches apply to.  Often, someone will grab the wrong 
	"official" source, and the patches won't take.  Then they make noises
	about the patch not working.  I feel that we should provide FULL
	SOURCE to all programs, *WITH PATCHES APPLIED*.  Leave the patches
	in a _common_ directory under each source tree, ie:

			/usr/src/gcc/LINPAT/*
				     ^^^^^^ name subject to discussion

	to allow someone to see exactly what was changed, but also allow them
	to compile without applying the patches themselves.		     *]
