I am happy to announce the creation of the Linux Standards (linux-standards)
mailing list.  The list is chartered as follows:

linux-standards:  Discussion of distribution and directory standards for 
                  the Linux Operating System, including directory structure,
                  file location, and release disk format.

Requests to be added to the mailing list should be sent to:
                linux-standards-request@banjo.concert.net
