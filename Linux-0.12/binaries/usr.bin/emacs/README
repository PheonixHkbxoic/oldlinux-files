EMACS 18.57 patches for Linux 0.12:

These patches are in two parts:

1) two small kernel patches to fix some minor problems (fs-diff):
	select.c: a pipe with no writer should select as readable to
		  allow detection of EOF
		  also, the kernel now silently corrects any attempts to
		  select more file descriptors than are supported (this
		  avoids the bit loss on left shift problem reported on
		  the activists list)

	pipe.c:	(I sent this to Linus for 0.12, but it didn't make it):
		reads on a pipe should return partial results.
		Otherwise, programs expecting to get such reads will
		work weirdly.

2) patches to the EMACS 18.57 distribution to build it for Linux-0.12.

Shar & enjoy,
