SED is a stream editor.
A stream editor is used to perform basic text
transformations on an input stream
(a file or input from a pipeline).
While in some ways similar to an editor which
permits scripted edits (such as ED),
SED works by making only one pass over the
input(s), and is consequently more efficient.
But it is SED's ability to filter text in a pipeline
which particularly distinguishes it from other types of
editors.
