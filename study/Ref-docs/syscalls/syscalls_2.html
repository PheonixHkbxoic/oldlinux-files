<P>
Each syscall has its own subsection and each of this subsections are
divided in four subsubsections:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>SYNOPSIS
<DD>contains the syscall definition in ANSI C.
<P>
<DT>PARAMETERS
<DD>describes each parameter of the syscall and specifies the flow of
information for each parameter. Each syscall is followed by <SAMP>`[in]'</SAMP>
when the information flows into the syscall, <SAMP>`[out]'</SAMP> when it flows
out if the syscall and <SAMP>`[in out]'</SAMP> when it flows in on entry and
flows out on return. Of course, in the case of pointers, the pointer
itself always flows in and the bracketed notation indicates the flow of
the data the pointer points to.
<P>
<DT>DESCRIPTON
<DD>describes the operations performed by that syscall.
<P>
<DT>RETURN VALUE
<DD>describes possbile return values from the syscall and the possible
values of <CODE>errno</CODE> for each possible errors. The meaning of those
error codes are not listed if they are evident. See section <A HREF="syscalls_114.html#SEC114" tppabs="http://www.infran.ru/TechInfo/syscalls/syscalls_114.html#SEC114">Errors</A> For
example, <CODE>EFAULT</CODE> always means that an invalid address or an
address range with incorrect protection attirbutes was passed to the
syscall. If an error code has special meaning for the described syscall,
this meaning is included in the description.
