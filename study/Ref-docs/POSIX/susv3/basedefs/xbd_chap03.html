contain fewer elements than the total number of possible numeric code values; that is, some code values may be unassigned.

<h3><a name="tag_03_100"></a>Collating Element</h3>

<p>The smallest entity used to determine the logical ordering of character or wide-character strings; see also <a href=
"#tag_03_102">Collation Sequence</a> . A collating element consists of either a single character, or two or more characters
collating as a single entity. The value of the <i>LC_COLLATE</i> category in the current locale determines the current set of
collating elements.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_03_101"></a>Collation</h3>

<p>The logical ordering of character or wide-character strings according to defined precedence rules. These rules identify a
collation sequence between the collating elements, and such additional rules that can be used to order strings consisting of
multiple collating elements.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_03_102"></a>Collation Sequence</h3>

<p>The relative order of collating elements as determined by the setting of the <i>LC_COLLATE</i> category in the current locale.
The collation sequence is used for sorting and is determined from the collating weights assigned to each collating element. In the
absence of weights, the collation sequence is the order in which collating elements are specified between <b>order_start</b> and
<b>order_end</b> keywords in the <i>LC_COLLATE</i> category.</p>

<p>Multi-level sorting is accomplished by assigning elements one or more collation weights, up to the limit {COLL_WEIGHTS_MAX}. On
each level, elements may be given the same weight (at the primary level, called an equivalence class; see also <a href=
"#tag_03_150">Equivalence Class</a> ) or be omitted from the sequence. Strings that collate equally using the first assigned weight
(primary ordering) are then compared using the next assigned weight (secondary ordering), and so on. <basefont size="2"></p>

<h3><a name="tag_03_103"></a>Column Position</h3>

<p>A unit of horizontal measure related to characters in a line.</p>

<p>It is assumed that each character in a character set has an intrinsic column width independent of any output device. Each
printable character in the portable character set has a column width of one. The standard utilities, when used as described in
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, assume that all characters have integral column widths. The column width of a character is not
necessarily related to the internal representation of the character (numbers of bits or bytes).</p>

<p>The column position of a character in a line is defined as one plus the sum of the column widths of the preceding characters in
the line. Column positions are numbered starting from 1.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_03_239"></a>Nice Value</h3>

<p>A number used as advice to the system to alter process scheduling. Numerically smaller values give a process additional

<h3><a name="tag_03_240"></a>Non-Blocking</h3>

<p>A property of an open file description that causes function calls involving it to return without delay when it is detected that
the requested action associated with the function call cannot be completed without unknown delay. <basefont size="2"></p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>

<dd>The exact semantics are dependent on the type of file associated with the open file description. For data reads from devices
such as ttys and FIFOs, this property causes the read to return immediately when no data was available. Similarly, for writes, it
causes the call to return immediately when the thread would otherwise be delayed in the write operation; for example, because no
space was available. For networking, it causes functions not to await protocol events (for example, acknowledgements) to occur. See

<p>A signal that is attributable to a specific thread.</p>

synchronous is a property of how the signal was generated and not a property of the signal number.</p>

<p>An implementation of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_03_381"></a>System Crash</h3>

<p>An interval initiated by an unspecified circumstance that causes all processes (possibly other than special system processes) to

<h3><a name="tag_03_383"></a>System Databases</h3>

<p>An implementation provides two system databases.</p>

<p>The &quot;group database&quot; contains the following information for each group:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Group name</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Numerical group ID</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>List of all users allowed in the group</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The &quot;user database&quot; contains the following information for each user:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>User name</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Numerical user ID</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Numerical group ID</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Initial working directory</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Initial user program</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>If the initial user program field is null, the system default is used. If the initial working directory field is null, the
interpretation of that field is implementation-defined. These databases may contain other fields that are unspecified by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_03_384"></a>System Documentation</h3>

<p>All documentation provided with an implementation except for the conformance document. Electronically distributed documents for
an implementation are considered part of the system documentation.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_03_385"></a>System Process</h3>

<p>An implementation-defined object, other than a process executing an application, that has a process ID.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_03_386"></a>System Reboot</h3>

<p>An implementation-defined sequence of events that may result in the loss of transitory data; that is, data that is not saved in
permanent storage. For example, message queues, shared memory, semaphores, and processes.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_03_387"></a>System Trace Event</h3>

<p>A trace event that is generated by the implementation, in response either to a system-initiated action or to an
application-requested action, except for a call to <a href="../functions/posix_trace_event.html"><i>posix_trace_event</i>()</a>.
When supported by the implementation, a system-initiated action generates a process-independent system trace event and an
application-requested action generates a process-dependent system trace event. For a system trace event not defined by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, the associated trace event type identifier is derived from the implementation-defined name for this
trace event, and the associated data is of implementation-defined content and length.</p>

<p>Pertaining to events occurring in all processes existing in an implementation at a given point in time.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_03_389"></a>Tab Character (&lt;tab&gt;)</h3>

<p>A character that in the output stream indicates that printing or displaying should start at the next horizontal tabulation
position on the current line. It is the character designated by <tt>'\t'</tt> in the C language. If the current position is at or
past the last defined horizontal tabulation position, the behavior is unspecified. It is unspecified whether this character is the
exact sequence transmitted to an output device by the system to accomplish the tabulation.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_03_390"></a>Terminal (or Terminal Device)</h3>

<p>A character special file that obeys the specifications of the general terminal interface. <basefont size="2"></p>

<p>A file that contains characters organized into one or more lines. The lines do not contain NUL characters and none can exceed
{LINE_MAX} bytes in length, including the &lt;newline&gt;. Although IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not distinguish between
text files and binary files (see the ISO&nbsp;C standard), many utilities only produce predictable or meaningful output when
operating on text files. The standard utilities that have such restrictions always specify &quot;text files&quot; in their STDIN or INPUT
FILES sections.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_03_393"></a>Thread</h3>

<p>A single flow of control within a process. Each thread has its own thread ID, scheduling priority and policy, <i>errno</i>
value, thread-specific key/value bindings, and the required system resources to support a flow of control. Anything whose address
may be determined by a thread, including but not limited to static variables, storage obtained via <a href=

automatic variables, are accessible to all threads in the same process. <basefont size="2"></p>

runnable threads in the system.</p>

<p>A function that may be safely invoked concurrently by multiple threads. Each function defined in the System Interfaces volume of

which holds a mutex locked while it is accessing static storage, or objects shared among threads.</p>

<p>A process global handle of type <b>pthread_key_t</b> which is used for naming thread-specific data.</p>
