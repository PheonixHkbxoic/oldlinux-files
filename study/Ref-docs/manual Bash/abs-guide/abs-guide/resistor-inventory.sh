# Exercise:
# --------
# Rewrite this script using arrays, rather than indirect variable referencing.
# Which method is more straightforward and intuitive?


# Notes:
# -----
#  Shell scripts are inappropriate for anything except the most simple
#+ database applications, and even then it involves workarounds and kludges.
#  Much better is to use a language with native support for data structures,
#+ such as C++ or Java (or even Perl).
