<H1><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC25">Syntax</A></H1>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX91"></A>
<A NAME="IDX92"></A>
This chapter describes the machine-independent syntax allowed in a
source file.  <CODE>as</CODE> syntax is similar to what many other
assemblers use; it is inspired by the BSD 4.2
assembler, except that <CODE>as</CODE> does not assemble Vax bit-fields.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC26" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC26">Preprocessing</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX93"></A>
The <CODE>as</CODE> internal preprocessor:

<UL>
<LI>

<A NAME="IDX94"></A>
 
adjusts and removes extra whitespace.  It leaves one space or tab before
the keywords on a line, and turns any other whitespace on the line into
a single space.

<A NAME="IDX95"></A>
<LI>

removes all comments, replacing them with a single space, or an
appropriate number of newlines.

<A NAME="IDX96"></A>
<LI>

converts character constants into the appropriate numeric values.
</UL>

<P>
It does not do macro processing, include file handling, or
anything else you may get from your C compiler's preprocessor.  You can
do include file processing with the <CODE>.include</CODE> directive
(see section <A HREF="as_7.html#SEC97"><CODE>.include "<VAR>file</CODE>"</VAR></A>).  You can use the GNU C compiler driver
to get other "CPP" style preprocessing, by giving the input file a
<SAMP>`.S'</SAMP> suffix.  See section `Options Controlling the Kind of Output' in <CITE>Using GNU CC</CITE>.

</P>
<P>
Excess whitespace, comments, and character constants
cannot be used in the portions of the input text that are not
preprocessed.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX97"></A>
<A NAME="IDX98"></A>
<A NAME="IDX99"></A>
<A NAME="IDX100"></A>
If the first line of an input file is <CODE>#NO_APP</CODE> or if you use the
<SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> option, whitespace and comments are not removed from the input file.
Within an input file, you can ask for whitespace and comment removal in
specific portions of the by putting a line that says <CODE>#APP</CODE> before the
text that may contain whitespace or comments, and putting a line that says
<CODE>#NO_APP</CODE> after this text.  This feature is mainly intend to support
<CODE>asm</CODE> statements in compilers whose output is otherwise free of comments
and whitespace.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC27" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC27">Whitespace</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX101"></A>
<EM>Whitespace</EM> is one or more blanks or tabs, in any order.
Whitespace is used to separate symbols, and to make programs neater for
people to read.  Unless within character constants
(see section <A HREF="as_3.html#SEC32">Character Constants</A>), any whitespace means the same
as exactly one space.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC28" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC28">Comments</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX102"></A>
There are two ways of rendering comments to <CODE>as</CODE>.  In both
cases the comment is equivalent to one space.

</P>
<P>
Anything from <SAMP>`/*'</SAMP> through the next <SAMP>`*/'</SAMP> is a comment.
This means you may not nest these comments.

</P>

<PRE>
/*
  The only way to include a newline ('\n') in a comment
  is to use this sort of comment.
*/

/* This sort of comment does not nest. */
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX103"></A>
Anything from the <EM>line comment</EM> character to the next newline
is considered a comment and is ignored.  The line comment character is
<SAMP>`;'</SAMP> for the AMD 29K family;
<SAMP>`;'</SAMP> on the ARC;
<SAMP>`;'</SAMP> for the H8/300 family;
<SAMP>`!'</SAMP> for the H8/500 family;
<SAMP>`;'</SAMP> for the HPPA;
<SAMP>`#'</SAMP> on the i960;
<SAMP>`!'</SAMP> for the Hitachi SH;
<SAMP>`!'</SAMP> on the SPARC;
<SAMP>`#'</SAMP> on the m32r;
<SAMP>`|'</SAMP> on the 680x0;
<SAMP>`#'</SAMP> on the Vax;
<SAMP>`!'</SAMP> for the Z8000;
<SAMP>`#'</SAMP> on the V850;
see section <A HREF="as_8.html#SEC138">Machine Dependent Features</A>.  
</P>
<P>
On some machines there are two different line comment characters.  One
character only begins a comment if it is the first non-whitespace character on
a line, while the other always begins a comment.

</P>
<P>
The V850 assembler also supports a double dash as starting a comment that
extends to the end of the line.

</P>
<P>
<SAMP>`--'</SAMP>;

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX104"></A>
<A NAME="IDX105"></A>
<A NAME="IDX106"></A>
To be compatible with past assemblers, lines that begin with <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> have a
special interpretation.  Following the <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> should be an absolute
expression (see section <A HREF="as_6.html#SEC60">Expressions</A>): the logical line number of the <EM>next</EM>
line.  Then a string (see section <A HREF="as_3.html#SEC33">Strings</A>) is allowed: if present it is a
new logical file name.  The rest of the line, if any, should be whitespace.

</P>
<P>
If the first non-whitespace characters on the line are not numeric,
the line is ignored.  (Just like a comment.)

</P>

<PRE>
                          # This is an ordinary comment.
# 42-6 "new_file_name"    # New logical file name
                          # This is logical line # 36.
</PRE>

<P>
This feature is deprecated, and may disappear from future versions
of <CODE>as</CODE>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC29">Symbols</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX107"></A>
A <EM>symbol</EM> is one or more characters chosen from the set of all
letters (both upper and lower case), digits and the three characters
<SAMP>`_.$'</SAMP>.
On most machines, you can also use <CODE>$</CODE> in symbol names; exceptions
are noted in section <A HREF="as_8.html#SEC138">Machine Dependent Features</A>.
No symbol may begin with a digit.  Case is significant.
There is no length limit: all characters are significant.  Symbols are
delimited by characters not in that set, or by the beginning of a file
(since the source program must end with a newline, the end of a file is
not a possible symbol delimiter).  See section <A HREF="as_5.html#SEC45">Symbols</A>.
<A NAME="IDX108"></A>

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC30">Statements</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX109"></A>
<A NAME="IDX110"></A>
<A NAME="IDX111"></A>
A <EM>statement</EM> ends at a newline character (<SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>) or an "at"
sign (<SAMP>`@'</SAMP>).  The newline or at sign is considered part of the
preceding statement.  Newlines and at signs within character constants
are an exception: they do not end statements.
A <EM>statement</EM> ends at a newline character (<SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>) or an exclamation 
point (<SAMP>`!'</SAMP>).  The newline or exclamation point is considered part of the
preceding statement.  Newlines and exclamation points within character
constants are an exception: they do not end statements.
A <EM>statement</EM> ends at a newline character (<SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>); or (for the
H8/300) a dollar sign (<SAMP>`$'</SAMP>); or (for the
Hitachi-SH or the
H8/500) a semicolon
(<SAMP>`;'</SAMP>).  The newline or separator character is considered part of
the preceding statement.  Newlines and separators within character
constants are an exception: they do not end statements.
A <EM>statement</EM> ends at a newline character (<SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>) or line
separator character.  (The line separator is usually <SAMP>`;'</SAMP>, unless
this conflicts with the comment character; see section <A HREF="as_8.html#SEC138">Machine Dependent Features</A>.)  The
newline or separator character is considered part of the preceding
statement.  Newlines and separators within character constants are an
exception: they do not end statements.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX112"></A>
<A NAME="IDX113"></A>
It is an error to end any statement with end-of-file:  the last
character of any input file should be a newline.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX114"></A>
<A NAME="IDX115"></A>
<A NAME="IDX116"></A>
You may write a statement on more than one line if you put a
backslash (<KBD>\</KBD>) immediately in front of any newlines within the
statement.  When <CODE>as</CODE> reads a backslashed newline both
characters are ignored.  You can even put backslashed newlines in
the middle of symbol names without changing the meaning of your
source program.

</P>
<P>
An empty statement is allowed, and may include whitespace.  It is ignored.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX117"></A>
<A NAME="IDX118"></A>
A statement begins with zero or more labels, optionally followed by a
key symbol which determines what kind of statement it is.  The key
symbol determines the syntax of the rest of the statement.  If the
symbol begins with a dot <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> then the statement is an assembler
directive: typically valid for any computer.  If the symbol begins with
a letter the statement is an assembly language <EM>instruction</EM>: it
assembles into a machine language instruction.
Different versions of <CODE>as</CODE> for different computers
recognize different instructions.  In fact, the same symbol may
represent a different instruction in a different computer's assembly
language.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX119"></A>
<A NAME="IDX120"></A>
A label is a symbol immediately followed by a colon (<CODE>:</CODE>).
Whitespace before a label or after a colon is permitted, but you may not
have whitespace between a label's symbol and its colon. See section <A HREF="as_5.html#SEC46">Labels</A>.

</P>
<P>
For HPPA targets, labels need not be immediately followed by a colon, but 
the definition of a label must begin in column zero.  This also implies that
only one label may be defined on each line.

</P>

<PRE>
label:     .directive    followed by something

<H2><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC31">Constants</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX121"></A>
A constant is a number, written so that its value is known by
inspection, without knowing any context.  Like this:

<PRE>
.byte  74, 0112, 092, 0x4A, 0X4a, 'J, '\J # All the same value.
.ascii "Ring the bell\7"                  # A string constant.
.octa  0x123456789abcdef0123456789ABCDEF0 # A bignum.
.float 0f-314159265358979323846264338327\
95028841971.693993751E-40                 # - pi, a flonum.
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC32">Character Constants</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX122"></A>
<A NAME="IDX123"></A>
There are two kinds of character constants.  A <EM>character</EM> stands
for one character in one byte and its value may be used in
numeric expressions.  String constants (properly called string
<EM>literals</EM>) are potentially many bytes and their values may not be
used in arithmetic expressions.

</P>



<H4><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC33">Strings</A></H4>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX124"></A>
<A NAME="IDX125"></A>
A <EM>string</EM> is written between double-quotes.  It may contain
double-quotes or null characters.  The way to get special characters
into a string is to <EM>escape</EM> these characters: precede them with
a backslash <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> character.  For example <SAMP>`\\'</SAMP> represents
one backslash:  the first <CODE>\</CODE> is an escape which tells
<CODE>as</CODE> to interpret the second character literally as a backslash
(which prevents <CODE>as</CODE> from recognizing the second <CODE>\</CODE> as an
escape character).  The complete list of escapes follows.

<A NAME="IDX141"></A>

lower case <CODE>x</CODE> works.

<A NAME="IDX142"></A>
<A NAME="IDX143"></A>
<DT><KBD>\\</KBD>
<DD>
Represents one <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> character.

<A NAME="IDX144"></A>
<A NAME="IDX145"></A>
<DT><KBD>\"</KBD>
<DD>
Represents one <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> character.  Needed in strings to represent
this character, because an unescaped <SAMP>`"'</SAMP> would end the string.

<DT><KBD>\ <VAR>anything-else</VAR></KBD>
<DD>
Any other character when escaped by <KBD>\</KBD> gives a warning, but
assembles as if the <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> was not present.  The idea is that if
you used an escape sequence you clearly didn't want the literal
interpretation of the following character.  However <CODE>as</CODE> has no
other interpretation, so <CODE>as</CODE> knows it is giving you the wrong
code and warns you of the fact.
</DL>

<P>
Which characters are escapable, and what those escapes represent,
varies widely among assemblers.  The current set is what we think
the BSD 4.2 assembler recognizes, and is a subset of what most C
compilers recognize.  If you are in doubt, do not use an escape
sequence.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX146"></A>
<A NAME="IDX147"></A>
<A NAME="IDX148"></A>
A single character may be written as a single quote immediately
followed by that character.  The same escapes apply to characters as
to strings.  So if you want to write the character backslash, you
must write <KBD>'\\</KBD> where the first <CODE>\</CODE> escapes the second
<CODE>\</CODE>.  As you can see, the quote is an acute accent, not a
grave accent.  A newline
(or at sign <SAMP>`@'</SAMP>)
(or dollar sign <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>, for the H8/300; or semicolon <SAMP>`;'</SAMP> for the
Hitachi SH or
H8/500)
immediately following an acute accent is taken as a literal character
and does not count as the end of a statement.  The value of a character
constant in a numeric expression is the machine's byte-wide code for
that character.  <CODE>as</CODE> assumes your character code is ASCII:
<KBD>'A</KBD> means 65, <KBD>'B</KBD> means 66, and so on.

A <EM>flonum</EM> represents a floating point number.  The translation is
indirect: a decimal floating point number from the text is converted by
<CODE>as</CODE> to a generic binary floating point number of more than
sufficient precision.  This generic floating point number is converted
to a particular computer's floating point format (or formats) by a
portion of <CODE>as</CODE> specialized to that computer.

</P>
<P>
A flonum is written by writing (in order)

<UL>
<LI>

The digit <SAMP>`0'</SAMP>.
(<SAMP>`0'</SAMP> is optional on the HPPA.)

<LI>

A letter, to tell <CODE>as</CODE> the rest of the number is a flonum.
<KBD>e</KBD> is recommended.  Case is not important.

On the H8/300, H8/500,
Hitachi SH,

one of the letters <SAMP>`DFPRSX'</SAMP> (in upper or lower case).

On the ARC, the letter must be one of the letters <SAMP>`DFRS'</SAMP>
(in upper or lower case).

On the Intel 960 architecture, the letter must be
one of the letters <SAMP>`DFT'</SAMP> (in upper or lower case).

On the HPPA architecture, the letter must be <SAMP>`E'</SAMP> (upper case only).

<LI>

An optional sign: either <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>.

<LI>

An optional <EM>integer part</EM>: zero or more decimal digits.

<LI>

An optional <EM>fractional part</EM>: <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> followed by zero
