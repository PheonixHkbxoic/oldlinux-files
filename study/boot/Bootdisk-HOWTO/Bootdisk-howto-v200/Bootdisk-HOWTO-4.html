<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Advanced Bootdisk Creation</A></H2>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Overview</A></H2>

<P>Previous Sections of this document covered the basics of creating
boot/root disks, and are applicable to nearly all kernels up to the
present (2.0, the latest stable kernel).</P>
<P>Kernels 1.3.48+ involved a substantial rewrite of the ramdisk code,
adding significant new capabilities.  These kernels could automatically
detect compressed filesystems, uncompress them and load them into the
ramdisk on boot-up.  Root filesystems could be placed on a second disk,
and as of kernel 1.3.98 or so, ramdisks are dynamically expandable.</P>
<P>Altogether, these new capabilities mean that boot disks can contain
substantially more than they used to.  With compression, a 1722K disk may
now hold up to about 3.5 megs of files.  As anyone who has created
bootdisks knows, much time is spent pruning down the file set and finding
trimmed-down versions of files that will all fit in a small filesystem.
With the new capabilities this is no longer such a concern.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, creating bootdisks to exploit these new features is
slightly more difficult now.  To build a compressed filesystem on a
floppy, the filesystem has to be built on another device and then
compressed and transferred to the floppy.  This means a few more steps.</P>
<P>The basic strategy is to create a compressed root filesystem, copy the
kernel to the floppy disk, tell the kernel where to find the root
filesystem, then copy the compressed root filesystem to the floppy.</P>
<P>Here's a simple ASCII drawing of what the disk will look like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
|&lt;--- zImage ---&gt;|&lt;------ Compressed root filesystem --------&gt;|
|________________|____________________________________________|
             Floppy disk space
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Here are the steps to create the boot floppy:</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Creating a root filesystem</A></H2>

<P>The root filesystem is created pretty much the same way as outlined in
Section 2.3 of this document.  The primary difference is that you can no
longer create a root filesystem directly on a floppy -- you must create
it on a separate device larger than the floppy area it will occupy.</P>

<H3>Choosing a device</H3>

<P>In order to build such a root filesystem, you need a spare device that is
large enough.  There are several choices:
<UL>
<LI>If you have an unused hard disk partition that is large enough
(several megabytes), this is the easiest solution.
Alternatively, if you have enough physical RAM you can simply
turn off swapping and build the filesystem in your swap
partition.

However, most people don't have a spare partition and can't afford
to turn swapping off, so...</LI>
<LI>Use a loopback device.  A loopback device allows a disk file on
an existing filesystem to be treated as a device.  In order to
use loopback devices you need specially modified mount
and unmount programs.  You can find these at:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl:/pub/linux/util/mount-2.5X.tar.gz
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

where X is the latest modification letter.

One you've installed these special mount/umount binaries,
create a temporary file on a hard disk with enough capacity (eg,
/tmp/fsfile).

Use this file name in place of DEVICE below.
When you issue a mount command you must include the
option "-o loop" to tell mount to use a loopback device.  
For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        mount -o loop -t ext2 /tmp/fsfile /mnt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


will mount /tmp/fsfile (via a loopback device) at the mount point
/mnt.  A 'df' will confirm this.</LI>
<LI>A final option is to use the ramdisk (DEVICE = /dev/ram or
/dev/ramdisk).  In this case, RAM is used to simulate a disk
drive.  The ramdisk must be large enough to hold a
filesystem of the appropriate size. Check your Lilo configuration file
(/etc/lilo.conf) for a line like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        RAMDISK_SIZE = nnn
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

which determines how much RAM will be allocated.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>After you've chosen one of these options, prepare the device with:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        dd if=/dev/zero of=DEVICE bs=1k 4096
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This command zeroes out the device.  This step is important because the
filesystem on the device will be compressed later, so all unused
portions should be filled with zeroes to achieve maximum compression.</P>
<P>Next, create the filesystem with:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        mke2fs /dev/hdb5 -m 0 DEVICE
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>(If you're using a loopback device, the disk file you're using should be
supplied in place of this DEVICE.  In this case, mke2fs will ask if you
really want to do this; say yes.)</P>
<P>Then mount the device:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        mount -t ext2 DEVICE /mnt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Proceed as before, copying files into /mnt, as specified in Section 2.3.</P>

<H3>Compressing the filesystem</H3>

<P>After you're done copying files into the root filesystem, you need to
copy it back out and compress it.  First, umount it:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        umount /mnt
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>(Technically you can copy the filesystem without unmounting it first,
but that's somewhat dangerous, and bad practice.)</P>
<P>Next, copy data off the device to a disk file.  Call the disk file
<CODE>rootfs</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        dd if=DEVICE of=rootfs
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Then compress it.  Use the '-9' option of gzip for maximal compression:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        gzip -9 rootfs
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This may take several minutes.  When it finishes, you'll have a file
rootfs.gz that is your compressed root filesystem.</P>
<P>If you're tight on disk space you can combine dd and gzip:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        dd if=DEVICE bs=1k | gzip -9 &gt; rootfs.gz
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Calculating the space</A></H2>

<P>At this point, check the space to make sure both the kernel and the root
filesystem will fit on the floppy.  An "ls -l" will show how many bytes
each occupies; divide by 1024 to determine how many blocks each will
need.  For partial blocks, be sure to round up to the next block.</P>
<P>For example, if the kernel size is 453281 bytes, it will need
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        ceil(453281 / 1024) = 443
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

blocks, so it will occupy blocks 0-442 on the floppy disk.  The
compressed root filesystem will begin at block 443.  Remember this
block number for the commands to follow; call it ROOTBEGIN.</P>
<P>You must tell the kernel where on the floppy to find the root
filesystem.  Inside the kernel image is a ramdisk word that specifies
where the root filesystem is to be found, along with other options.  The
word is defined in /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel.setup.c and is
interpreted as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        bits  0-10:     Offset to start of ramdisk, in 1024 byte blocks
                        (This is ROOTBEGIN, calculated above)
        bits 11-13:     unused
        bit     14:     Flag indicating that ramdisk is to be loaded
        bit     15:     Flag indicating to prompt for floppy
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>(If bit 15 is set, on boot-up you will be prompted to place a new floppy
disk in the drive.  This is necessary for a two-disk boot set, discussed
below in Section 4.5.  For now, this will be zero.)</P>
<P>If the root filesystem is to begin at block 443, the ramdisk word is
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        1BB (hex)       443 (decimal)     (bits 0-10)
     + 4000 (hex)       Ramdisk load flag (bit 14)
       ----------
     = 41BB (hex) 
     =16827 (decimal)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This ramdisk word will be set in the kernel image using the "rdev -r"
command in the next section.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Copying files to the floppy</A></H2>


<P>At this point you're ready to create the boot floppy.  First copy the
kernel:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        dd if=zImage of=/dev/fd0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Next, tell the kernel to find its root filesystem on the floppy:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        rdev /dev/fd0 /dev/fd0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Next, you have to set the ramdisk word in the kernel image now residing
on the floppy.  The ramdisk word is set using the "rdev -r" command.
Using the figure calculated in 4.3:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        rdev -r zImage 16827
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Finally, place the root filesystem on the floppy after the kernel.  The
<CODE>dd</CODE> command has a <CODE>seek</CODE> option that allows you to specify how many
blocks to skip:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        dd if=rootfs.gz of=/dev/fd0 bs=1k seek=443
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>(The value 443 is ROOTBEGIN from Section 4.3.)</P>
<P>Wait for the floppy drive to finish writing, and you're done.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Making a two-disk set.</A></H2>

<P>If you want more space, you can make a two-disk boot set.  In this case,
the first floppy disk will contain the kernel alone, and the second will
contain the compressed root filesystem.  With this configuration you can use a
compressed filesystem of up to 1440K.</P>
<P>A two-disk set is created using a simple variation of the instructions
above.  First, you must set the ramdisk PROMPT flag to 1 to instruct the
kernel to prompt and wait for the second floppy.  The root filesystem
will begin at byte 0 of the second floppy.  </P>
<P>From section 4.3, the ramdisk PROMPT flag (bit 15) will be set to 1, and
the ramdisk offset will be zero.  In our example the new calculation
would be:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
                4000 (hex)      Ramdisk load flag (bit 14)
              + 8000 (hex)      Ramdisk prompt flag (bit 15)
              ------------
              = C000 (hex)
              =49152 (decimal)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>which would be used in the 'rdev -r' calculation as before.</P>
<P>Follow the instructions of 4.4, above, but after issuing the 'rdev -r'
command, put a new floppy in the drive and issue the command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        dd if=rootfs.gz of=/dev/fd0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The <CODE>seek</CODE> option is not needed since the root filesystem starts at block
zero.</P>
