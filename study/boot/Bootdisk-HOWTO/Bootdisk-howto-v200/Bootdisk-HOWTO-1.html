<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Why Build Boot Disks?</A></H2>

<P>Linux boot disks are useful in a number of situations, such as:
<UL>
<LI>Testing a new kernel.</LI>
<LI>Recovering from disk or system failure. Such a failure could be
anything from a lost boot sector to a disk head crash.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>There are several ways of producing boot disks:
<UL>
<LI>Use one from a distribution such as Slackware. This will at 
least allow you to boot.</LI>
<LI>Use a rescue package to set up disks designed to be used
as rescue disks.</LI>
<LI>Learn what is required for each of the various types of disk
to operate, then build your own.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>I originally chose the last option - learn how it works so that you
can do it yourself. That way, if something breaks, you can work out
what to do to fix it. Plus you learn a lot about how Linux works along
the way. Once I understood how it all worked, then I changed to using
the Bootkit rescue package to maintain my boot disks.</P>
<P>Experienced Linux users may find little of use in this 
document. However users new to Linux system administration who
wish to protect against root disk loss and other mishaps may find
it useful.</P>
<P>A note on versions - this document has been updated to support the
following packages and versions:
<UL>
<LI>Linux 1.99.9</LI>
<LI>LILO 0.19</LI>
