<H2><A NAME="s6">6. References</A></H2>

<P>In this section, vvv is used in package names in place of the version,
to avoid referring here to specific versions. When retrieving a package,
always get the latest version unless you have good reasons for not
doing so.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 LILO - Linux Loader</A></H2>

<P>Written by Werner Almesberger. Excellent boot loader, and the
documentation includes information on the boot sector contents and
the early stages of the boot process.</P>
<P>Ftp from: <CODE>tsx-11.mit.edu:
/pub/linux/packages/lilo/lilo.vvv.tar.gz</CODE>
also on sunsite and mirror sites.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Linux FAQ and HOWTOs</A></H2>

<P>These are available from many sources. Look at the usenet newsgroups
<CODE>news.answers</CODE> and <CODE>comp.os.linux.announce</CODE>. </P>
<P>Ftp from: <CODE>sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs</CODE>
<UL>
<LI>FAQ is in <CODE>/pub/linux/docs/faqs/linux-faq</CODE></LI>

<P>with the word "help" in the message, then follow the mailed instructions.</P>
<P>Note: if you haven't read the Linux FAQ and related documents such as the
Linux Installation HOWTO and the Linux Install Guide, then you should not
be trying to build boot diskettes.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Rescue Packages</A></H2>


<H3>Bootkit</H3>

<P>Written by Scott Burkett. Bootkit provides a flexible menu-driven
framework for managing rescue disk creation and contents. It uses the
Dialog package to provide nice menus, and a straight-forward directory
tree to contain definitions of rescue disk contents. The package
includes samples of the main files needed. The package
aims to provide only the framework; it is up to the user to work out
what to put on the disks and set up the config files accordingly.
For those users who don't mind doing this, it is a good choice.
I use this package myself.</P>

/pub/Linux/system/Recovery/Bootkit-vvv.tar.gz</CODE></P>

<H3>CatRescue</H3>

<P>Written by Oleg Kibirev. This package concentrates on saving space
on the rescue diskettes by extensive use of compression, and by
implementing executables as shells scripts. The doco includes some
tips on what to do in various disaster situations.</P>
<P>Ftp from: <CODE>gd.cs.csufresno.edu/pub/sun4bin/src/CatRescue100.tgz</CODE></P>

<H3>Rescue Shell Scripts</H3>

<P>Written by Thomas Heiling. This contains shell scripts to produce
boot and boot/root diskettes. It has some dependencies on specific
versions of other software such as LILO, and so might need some
effort to convert to your system, but it might be useful as a 
starting point if you wanted more comprehensive shell scripts than
are provided in this document.</P>
<P>Ftp from: <CODE>sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Recovery/rescue.tgz</CODE></P>

<H3>SAR - Search and Rescue</H3>

<P>Written by Karel Kubat. SAR produces a rescue diskette, using 
several techniques to minimize the space required on the diskette.
The manual includes a description of the Linux boot/login process.</P>
<P>Ftp from: <CODE>ftp.icce.rug.nl:/pub/unix/SAR-vvv.tar.gz</CODE></P>
<P>The manual is available via WWW from:</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 Slackware Distribution</A></H2>

<P>Apart from being one of the more popular Linux distributions around, it
is also a good place to get a generic kernel. It is available from
almost everywhere, so there is little point in putting addresses here.</P>
