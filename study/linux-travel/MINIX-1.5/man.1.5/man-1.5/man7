# dosA, dosB, dosC, dosD, dosE, dosF
	dosA (7)  	dosB (7)	dosC (7)	etc.

NAME:
	/dev/dosA .. /dev/dosF - synonyms for MS-DOS directories A: .. F:

DESCRIPTION:
	The dosdir, dosread, and doswrite commands use the letters A..F
to refer to MS-DOS disk devices. These commands look in the /dev directory
for names like /dev/dosA, etc., which must be linked to the standard Minix
devices names, using the ln command, for example:

	ln /dev/at0 /dev/dosA

	The links may vary from machine to machine, depending upon what
equipment is installed. Some possibilites are:

	/dev/dosA - refers to /dev/pc0 (5.25" device) or /dev/ps0 (3.5")
	/dev/dosB - refers to /dev/pc1 (5.25" device) or /dev/ps1 (3.5")
	/dev/dosC - refers to /dev/hd1 (hard disk C:)
	/dev/dosD - refers to /dev/hd2 (hard disk D:)
	/dev/dosE - refers to /dev/at0 (5.25" device) or /dev/PS0 (3.5")
	/dev/dosF - refers to /dev/at1 (5.25" device) or /dev/PS1 (3.5")

	The Minix 1.5 hard disk drivers support disk partitions of up
to 64M; and dosdir, etc., cannot work with DOS partitions larger than
this.

# fd0 
	/dev/fd0 /dev/fd1

	These are names for the disk drives that auto detect the format.
Disk access via these names may be slower, since the driver has to determine
what kind of disk format it is dealing with by trial and error. Also,
early versions of Minix did not support 1.44M disks (type /dev/PS0), and
this format is not auto-detecting reliably by all parts of the Minix 1.5
system, most notoriously by the original Minixc bootloader.
 
SEE ALSO: PS0(7), dosA(7), etc.
	
# PS0 at0 fd0 pat0 pc0 ps0
	/dev/PS0 /dev/at0 /dev/pat0 /dev/pc0 /dev/ps0

	These are some of the floppy disk device types. In every case 
the 0 device corresponds to the first drive (A: under MS-DOS); there
may also be a 1 device (i.e., /dev/PS1) corresponding to the second
floppy device.
	
	Referring to these devices rather than the generic /dev/fd0,
/dev/fd1 names is faster and possibly more reliable.

	/dev/pc0 is a 5.25" 360K disk drive, XT-type 
	/dev/ps0 is a 3.5" 720K drive
	/dev/at0 is a 5.25" 1.2M drive 
	/dev/PS0 is a 3.5" 1.44M drive
	/dev/pcat0 is a /dev/at0-type drive with a 360K disk.

# console tty0
	/dev/console, /dev/tty0

This is the video display and keyboard. The two names are equivalent.

# ether
	/dev/ether
	
	This is the ethernet card. With Mariusz Ostrowski's ether drivers
one ethernet interface is supported. The driver must be recompiled for the
appropriate hardware, of which several types are supported.

SEE ALSO: /usr/local/src/ether*

# hd0 hd1 hd2 hd3 hd4
	/dev/hd0 /dev/hd1 /dev/hd2 /dev/hd3 /dev/hd4

	These are the names used by Minix to refer to hard drive partitions.
/dev/hd0 is the root partition; this name is used by fdisk, but is never
used to refer to an actual data partition. /dev/hd1 .. /dev/hd4 refer to
the four possible partitions on the first hard drive.

	Two hard drives are supported by Minix 1.5; the second drive's
partition table is referred to as /dev/hd5 and the partitions are /dev/hd6
.. /dev/hd9.

	Minix 1.5 does not support sub-partitions.

	Linux was originally based upon Minix, and Linux can mount Minix
hard drive partions. The Linux naming system is different, however; the
partition tables for the first and second are known to Linux as /dev/hda 
and /dev/hdb, and the partitons are hda1, hda2, etc.

# kmem mem
	/dev/kmem /dev/mem
		
	These device names refer to memory, and allow programs to access 
memory locations. /dev/mem refers to all of memory and /dev/kmem refers to
the memory used by the kernel.

SEE ALSO: port(7)

# lp
	/dev/lp

	This is the printer. Minix 1.5 supports only one parallel printer,
corresponding to the MS-DOS LPT1: device.

SEE ALSO: lpr(1)

# null
	/dev/null

	This is the famous /dev/null which accepts all the data you 
throw at it and always gives an imediate end-of-file when you read it.

# port
	/dev/port

	Similar to /dev/mem and /dev/kmem, this device makes 80x86 I/O
ports accessible.

SEE ALSO: mem(7), kmem(7)
	
# ptyp0 ttyp0 
	/dev/ptyp0 ../dev/ptypf, /dev/ttyp0 .. /dev/ttypf

	These are devices that provide pseudo ports for network connections.

# ram
	/dev/ram

	This is a RAM disk. By default Minix copies the contents of its
root directory from the ram image device to /dev/ram, making access to the 
most-used files very rapid. In this mode the size of the RAM disk is 
fixed by the size of the ram-image device.

	Using the boot monitor it is also possible to create an empty 
/dev/ram of any desired size, which can be mounted at any point in the
Minix file system except the root. With standard Minix 1.5 it is not 
possible to make a root RAM device of arbitrary size.

SEE ALSO: monitor(8)

# tty 
	/dev/tty

	/dev/tty does not refer to a particular physical device. It is
always the users login terminal, which may be the console, a remote
terminal connected to a serial  port, or a network terminal using a 
pseudo-terminal.

SEE ALSO: tty0(7), tty1(7), ttyp(7), ttys(4)

# tty1 tty2
	/dev/tty1 /dev/tty2

	These are the IBM PC serial ports, corresponding to DOS devices
COM1: and COM2:. If the /etc/ttys(4) file is properly configured logins
can be made from serial terminals connected to these lines. 

SEE ALSO: tty0(7), ttys(4), stty(1), getty(1)
