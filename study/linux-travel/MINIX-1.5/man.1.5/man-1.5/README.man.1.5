General notes on the Minix 1.5 man command:  

	Unix systems generally seem to keep man pages as individual
files named according to the subject and the section, for example,
rm.1, ls.1, chmod.2, etc., in directories named according to the
manual section, such as man1/, man2/, etc.  These files may not be not
flat text, they may be compressed and/or they may need to be passed
through a formatting program such as nroff.

	The Minix man files that are available over the net are tarred
collections of such files (not compressed, but needing to be run
through a formatting program).
 
	Minix 1.5 man files do it differently. The Minix 1.5.10 man
command expects to find a single large flat text file for each man
section. One could debate whether this is a good idea or not, but it
isn't the way most other Unix systems do it. It is probably more
practical for the very small file systems on the floppy-based PCs for
which Minix was originally developed. The man index display (see
below) is definitely a more friendly interface than the standard Unix
man system, which won't give you much help if you don't already know
which command you want to ask about.

	There isn't any documentation on the format of man files
except what is inherent in the man.c source.  The man files consist of
keyword lines that begin with a "#" in the first column, followed by
lines of text to be displayed when one of the keywords in the
preceding keyword line is selected from the keyword menu or as an
argument to the man command.  The keyword lines are not displayed, but
all lines of text up to but not including the next keyword line will
be displayed. New articles may be added to a man file by
concatenation, but if a keyword appears more than once only the last
reference will be displayed.

	In use, the Minix 1.5.10 man command expects to find files
man<n> in the directory/usr/man. The command format is
	man [<arg1> [arg2]]

	If the command is given with no arguments a menu of the
keywords in /usr/man/man1 is presented.

	If the commmand is given with one argument, if the argument is
a <n> suffix of a man<n> file in /usr/man a menu of the keywords in
man<n> is presented.

	If the commmand is given with one argument, if the argument is
not a <n> suffix of a man<n> file in /usr/man a search is made for an
article with a keyword corresponding to arg1 in /usr/man/man1.

	If the command is given with two arguments the first argument
is used to select a file /usr/man/man<arg1> and the second argument is
the keyword to search for.

	Articles can be paged through in the forward direction using
the Enter key.  Presentation of an article may be interrupted by the
intr (Delete by default, may be changed with stty) key or the Q key.
When in menu mode the menu will be presented each time an article is
complete. The intr or Q key will exit from the menu back to the
command line prompt.

Man files from the net: 

	For better or for worse, a decision seems to have been made
that the man system of future versions of Minix will be the
traditional Unix one, with a single file for each entry. This will
make maintenance of the man files easier, but it does away with the
menu display that beginners to Unix will probably find easier to use.

	Most of the man pages you get from the net will need to be
processed in the following way to be used with the Minix 1.5 man
command:

1. Convert each article to a flat ASCII file. (Maybe not as easy as it
should be if Minix is the only Unix you have, since most of these
files cannot be fully converted using only the Minix 1.5 nroff -man
command.)

2. Add a line to the top of each article that begins with a pound sign
"#" followed by all the names by which you want to retrieve that
article.

3. Concatenate all the files for section 1 together and name the
resulting file man1, man2, etc. Put all of them in the directory
/usr/man.

	Two caveats: don't throw away the original tarred files you
get from the net, since when you update to Minix 1.6 or later you'll
need to have separate files for each topic. Also, be aware that the
man files that have been posted to the net may actually be based on
Minix 1.6.16 or a later version in which the action of each command
may no longer be the same as in Minix 1.5.10.
