Minix 1.5 man pages on minix1.hampshire.edu

I have posted my Minix 1.5 man pages in the anonymous ftp area of
minix1.hampshire.edu.  I hope they will be of use to people using 
Minix 1.5 on MacIntosh or Atari systems.

These are flat ASCII files, one file per man section, intended to be
read by the Minix 1.5 man command.  This is not a standard man command
as found on other Unix versions, in fact, its name was originally help,
and its action is similar to the MS-DOS HELP command.  With no argument
the command gives you a menu of available documents.  See the README
for more information.

The sections of the Minix 1.5 manual are:
	
     Section 1: User commands
     Section 2: System calls
     Section 3: C library
     Section 4: File formats
     Section 5: Miscellaneous
     Section 6: Games
     Section 7: Special files (devices)
     Section 8: Maintenance procedures

The entries in section 1 are derived from a set of man pages that Andy
Tanenbaum sent me in 1993, and some of the entries correspond to
enhancements added in the version 1.6 release, but the majority are
identical to the Minix 1.5 man pages in the printed Minix 1.5 Reference
Manual.  Andy has given his permission to post this material.

The entries in the other sections come from a variety of sources.  Some
are Andy's pages moved to another section.  Many entries were provided
by other contributors to enhanced Minix 1.5 as it was installed on
minix1.hampshire.edu, and pages for the boot monitor (by Kees Bot) and
the Tnet network package (by Michael Temari) are included.  So be
warned, if you download these pages for use on your MacIntosh or Atari
running Minix 1.5 there are some entries here that don't correspond to
anything in your system.  Many entries were written by me (asw) for my
own use or for my students, and some of these are very sketchy.  In
some cases the formatting into plain ASCII is incomplete, and a few
entries originally written in Spanish may not have been translated into
English.
