The following uuencoded shar files contain the sources for cppmake 2.3. This
version of cppmake has been upgraded for 1.5.10 and contains some bug fixes
for:

1. trailing make options sometimes not passed to make
2. quoted newline sometimes consumed cpp directives

It should be noted that cppmake uses fopen(name, "w+") to create readable
temporary files. 1.5.10 stdio does not support the '+' update mode. Use estdio
or a hacked version of 1.5.10 stdio.

The shar files were created using shar followed by compress followed by uue. To
recover, use uud followed by uncompress followed by sh or unshar.
