Hello world!

A few weeks before, I announced a folding editor named Origami.  The
current version seems to be stable.  If you never worked with a folding
editor before, save the posting and read the documentation.  There is a
section written for those people.  It takes five minutes to convince me,
that folding editors make writing of programs and documents so much
easier, I hope that you will get the same experience.
This is the newest version we have.  There is full macro language
support and documentation.  Origami runs on PC MINIX 1.5.10 and SUN 3/4
with SunOS 4.1. 

The sources are uuencoded 13-bit compressed shell archives.  There
should be no problems to unpack and use them.  One archive contains two
of my local system wide include files.  They are identical with the ones
included in my MROFF distribution and should be copied to
/usr/include/local.

Part1 contains keybindings and macros: origami1.5/bindings
Part2 contains the documentation as roff source: origami1.5/doc
Part3 contains the above mentioned include files: /usr/include/local
Part4 and Part5 must be concatenated and contain sources: origami1.5

If you have questions, bug reports (with fixes as cdiffs :-) ), or
anything else, you can send me email to:
