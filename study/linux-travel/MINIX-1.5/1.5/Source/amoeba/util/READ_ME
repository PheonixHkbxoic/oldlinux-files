This directory contains the sources for amoeba based utilities.  These are
mainly of interest if you have an ethernet connection.  Master and sherver
should not be installed if you do not have an ethernet connection since they
will take up precious memory.


Installation:

1. Type make

2. Copy files as follows:

	cp rsh  /usr/bin
	cp rcp  /usr/bin
	cp to   /usr/bin
	cp from /usr/bin

3. Edit /etc/rc and add the lines:

	echo "Starting sherver(s)"
	/usr/bin/master 1 <uid> <gid> /etc/sherver port

   where port is the name that your node is to be known by.  It should not be
   more than 6 characters long.  It can be made up of any characters you like.
   Note that the flags <uid> and <gid> are the uid and group id that the 
   sherver will run under.
