<DD>"This book is intended as an introduction and guide to the Second Extended File System, also known as Ext2.  Trying to implement ext2 drivers isn't always an easy task, the most difficult issue is unfortunately the documentation available. It seems like most of the documentation on the net about the internal layout of Ext2 was written to complement the Linux sources rather than be a complete document by themselves."<p>

<DD>"In this paper, we describe the history of Linux filesystems. We briefly introduce the fundamental concepts implemented in Unix filesystems. We present the implementation of the Virtual File System layer in Linux and we detail the Second Extended File System kernel code and user mode tools. Last, we present performance measurements made on Linux and BSD filesystems and we conclude with the current status of Ext2fs and the future directions."<p>

McDonald and Markus G. Kuhn</a><br>
<DD>"Cryptographic file systems provide little protection against legal or illegal instruments that force the owner of data to release decryption keys for stored data once the presence of encrypted data on an inspected computer has been established. We are interested in how cryptographic file systems can be extended to provide additional protection for such a scenario and we have extended the standard Linux file system (Ext2fs) with a plausible-deniability encryption function. Even though it is obvious that our computer has harddisk encryption software installed and might contain some encrypted data, an inspector will not be able to determine whether we have revealed the access keys to all security levels or only those to a few selected ones. We describe the design of our freely available implementation of this steganographic file system and discuss its security and performance characteristics."<p>

We present a model that relates disk and device characteristics to the recording rate, and derive storage granularity and scattering parameters that guarantee continuous access. In order for the filesystem to support multiple concurrent requests, we develop admission control algorithms for determining whether a new request can be accepted without violating the realtime constraints of any of the requests."<p>
