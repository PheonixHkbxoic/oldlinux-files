<DD>This document defines a programming model for use with the AltiVec instruction set extension to the PowerPC architecture. There are three types of programming interfaces
described in this document: 1. A high-level language interface, intended for use within programming languages
such as C or C++.
2. An application binary interface (ABI) deﬁning low-level coding conventions. 3. An assembly language interface.<p>

<DD>"Alpha is a 64-bit load/store RISC architecture that is designed with particular emphasis on the three elements that most affect performance: clock speed, multiple instruction issue, and multiple processors.<p>The Alpha architects examined and analyzed current and theoretical RISC architecture design elements and developed high-performance alternatives for the Alpha architecture. The architects adopted only those design elements that appeared valuable for a projected 25-year design horizon. Thus, Alpha becomes the first 21st century computer architecture."<p>
