<DD>Descriptions of the hardware and software interface to the CyberMaster.  This information has been collected by reverse engineering the protocol and hardware, culminating in a linux port for the CyberMaster.  Very interesting, and legos are cool!<p>
<DT><font size=+1><a href='http://www.crynwr.com/lego-robotics/'>Lego Mindstorms Internals</a></font> - by <a href='mailto:nelson@crynwr.com'>Russell Nelson</a><br>
<DD>Similarly, this page describes how to interface to the Lego Mindstorms robot controller... This is a really cool was to computerize your legos, programming them to do interesting things.  By knowing how to get around the Lego language, you can do even more interesting things...<p>

<DT><font size=+1><a href='http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/files/OtherHW/atx_201.pdf'>ATX Spec v2.01</a></font><br>
<DD>ATX was developed as an evolution of the Baby-AT form-factor and was defined to address four major areas of improvement: enhanced ease-of-use, better support for current and future I/O, better support for current and future processor technology, and reduced total system cost.<p>ATX combines the best functionality from the form factors that dominated the computer industry in the early 1990-92's: the high integration of LPX and the expandability of Baby-AT.<p>
<DT><font size=+1><a href='http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/files/OtherHW/NETPC.pdf'>Network PC System Design Guidelines</a></font><br>
<DD>This guide presents information for engineers who build or plan to build personal computers and expansion cards under the Network PC Design Initiative.<p>The Network PC is a new addition to the PC family, not a replacement, using Intel architecture and other microprocessor architectures that run the Microsoft 'Windows' or Windows NT Workstation operating systems.  The Net PC will reduce the cost of business computing by optimizing the design for users who do not require the flexibility and expandability of the traditional PC, and by allowing organizations to centrally manage their information technology. Although the types of business users will vary, the Net PC will be ideally suited for those involved in activities such as data entry, transaction processing, and intranet and Internet access.<p>

<DT><font size=+1>System Design Guides</font><br>
<DD>These guides describe what Microsoft wants for the Windows family of products... in the process, they describe exactly the interfaces that need to be exposed... which makes them useful for addressing the preexisting products that match these specs.<p>

<DT><font size=+1><a href='http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/files/OtherHW/PC98SystemDesignGuide.pdf'>PC '98 System Design Guide</a></font><br>
<DD>"This guide is for engineers who build personal computers, expansion cards, and peripheral devices that will be used with the Microsoft Windows '98 and NT v5.0 operating systems.  The goal of this document is to provide hardware design guidelines that will result in the optimal user experience."<p>
