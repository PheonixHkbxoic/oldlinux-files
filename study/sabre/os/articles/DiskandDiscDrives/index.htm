<DD>This document gives a lot of details about accessing and manipulating IDE disks directly, as an operating system would have to do.  This document is heartily recommended for those who do not want to use the BIOS through VM86 mode.  :)<p>

<DD>This file describes the IO ports that are available on an IDE disk, as well as some example code to go with it.  The sample code demonstrates reading and writing to the disk...<p>

<DD>This code example demonstrates direct IDE disk control, using the IO ports.  This code does not use interrupts to drive the disk, but instead polls for the data.  Also included is this <a href="../../../../sabre/os/files/Disk/HDTEST.asm" tppabs="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/files/Disk/HDTEST.asm">test program</a>.<p>

<DD>"Why is an understanding of how a BIOS works so important?  The basic reason is that the information returned by INT 13H AH=08H is used by FDISK, it is used in the partition table entries within a partition record (like the Master Boot Record) that are created by FDISK, and it is used by the small boot program that FDISK places into the Master Boot Record.  The information returned by INT 13H AH=08H is in cylinder/head/sector (CHS) format -- it is not in LBA format.  The boot processing done by your computer's BIOS (INT 19H and INT 13H) is all CHS based."<p>

<DD>"This booklet (now electronic) is published as a service of Data Recovery Labs.  Its purpose is to provide the fundamental knowledge of concepts and terminology that is necessary to deal with the complexities of hard disk subsystems.  It is not a technical reference guide and should not replace original documentation made available by manufacturers."<p>

<DD>"This summary describes how information is encoded on Compact Disc (CD) beginning with the physical pits and going up through higher levels of data encoding  to  the structured   multimedia  information that  is possible with   programs like HyperCard.   This  discussion    is much broader than any  single  standards document,  e.g. the CD-Audio   Red Book,   while omitting  much of   the   detail needed  only  by  drive manufacturers."<p>

The CD-ROM disc appears just like a magnetic disk to the user and to applications software, ensuring compatibility with current software."<p>

<DD>"Device Bay is an industry specification defining a mechanism for easily adding and upgrading PC peripheral devices without opening the chassis.

<DD>"A major shortcoming of removable media devices on PC platforms is their inability to report to the host when the user attempts to eject the medium. Currently most removable media devices just eject the medium when the user presses the Eject button, and potentially any data the operating system has not saved to the device is lost. Various volume tracking and locking schemes reduce this risk, but do not eliminate it. Ideally, devices will have a means of communicating to the host that the user wants to eject the medium or has inserted a new medium.<P>This specification defines a protocol for providing this function for SCSI ATA and ATAPI devices. The support is enabled using a new SCSI command, ENABLE MEDIA STATUS, and the media status is retrieved using a new SCSI ATA command, GET MEDIA STATUS."<p>

<DD>"With the use of increasingly sophisticated encryption systems, an attacker wishing to gain access to sensitive data is forced to look elsewhere for information.  One avenue of attack is the recovery of supposedly erased data from magnetic media or random-access memory.  This paper covers some of the methods available to recover erased data and presents schemes to make this recovery significantly more difficult." - Paper includes many references.<p>

<DD>"In this paper we explore the design of 'Do-It-Yourself' RAIDs: RAID systems that can assembled by the end user from commercially available disks, enclosures, cables, racks, computers, and networks. We quantitatively
evaluate the tradeoffs in cost, performance, and reliability of these DIY-RAID systems."<p>
