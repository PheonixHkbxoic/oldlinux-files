<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>I&nbsp;was originally going to write an article for the
ill-fated PCGPE&nbsp;2 on using the CMOS timer interrupt, but
since I no longer support MS-DOS that article will not be
written. Instead, I've written this short HTML page showing how
to enable and use it for anyone who's interested.</p>

<p><b>What is It?</b></p>

<p>The CMOS timer is a chip on the motherboard responsible for
keeping track of the time. It's connected to the motherboard
battery, which is why your computer keeps the correct time even
when you unplug it from the wall (unless of course you disconnect
the battery). When the computer is first booted the appropriate
BIOS function reads the time from the CMOS chip and sets the
appropriate variables in system memory. BIOS&nbsp;also
initializes the PIT&nbsp;chip, which then periodically (ie 18.2
times a second)&nbsp;generates an interrupt to update the time
variables. Messing with the PIT&nbsp;chip's frequency will affect
the computer's time, but it will automatically be set again the
next time the user boots and BIOS reads the CMOS chip again. You
can also read the time from the CMOS chip directly if you want to
set the correct time afterwards (details on how to do this are in
<a
href="ftp://x2ftp.oulu.fi/pub/msdos/programming/docs/helppc21.zip">HelpPC</a>).</p>

<p>One very useful feature of the CMOS timer is that it's capable
of generating regular interrupts. The frequency is fixed at
1024Hz, but that's is more than enough for most applications, and
in my experiments it has a negligable affect on overall system
performance. Best of all, it leaves the PIT chip free to do other
stuff. In fact, if you develop your application carefully you
probably won't have to use the PIT chip at all (unless you need
an extremely high resolution timer such as that required for
CPU&nbsp;instruction timing)! I've found the CMOS timer to be
safer, easier to implement and more reliable that PIT
(particularly when running under a Win95 DOS&nbsp;shell).</p>

<p><b>Ok, So How Do I&nbsp;Enable It?</b></p>

<p>The following code will enable the interrupts:</p>

<p><font color="#008080"><b><tt>outp(0x70, 0x0B); </tt></b></font></p>

<p><font color="#008080"><b><tt>outp(0x71, inp(0x71) | 0x40);</tt></b></font></p>

<p>The following code will disable the interrupts:</p>

<p><font color="#008080"><b><tt>outp(0x70, 0x0B); </tt></b></font></p>

<p><font color="#008080"><b><tt>outp(0x71, inp(0x71) &amp;0xBF);</tt></b></font></p>

<p>When the timer is enabled it will trigger interrupt 0x70 at a
rate of 1024Hz. Place a custom interrupt handler there to trap
it. As always, make sure you install your custom handler before
enabling the interrupt, get the old handler beforehand and be
sure to call it in your own, and make sure you clean up after
yourself when you're done.</p>

<p>(Details on what the above registers actually do can be found
in <a
href="ftp://x2ftp.oulu.fi/pub/msdos/programming/docs/helppc21.zip">HelpPC</a>).</p>

<p><b>How Would I&nbsp;Use This in a Real Application?</b></p>

<p>I'm sure there are many ways to use this, here is one I would
suggest. I'll assume that your application is doing real-time
sound mixing and needs accurate timing for animation control.</p>

<p>First of all I'd declare the following two variables:</p>

<pre><font color="#008080"><b><tt>volatile unsigned LONG&nbsp;time; // indicates elapsed time</tt></b></font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080"><b><tt>int mixing=0;                // a boolean variable</tt></b></font></pre>

<p>The <b>volatile</b> keyword is used to indicate to the
compiler that it should <i>always</i> read the contents of the
variable before using it (Most compilers often cache variables in
registers in order to improve performance. This is unacceptable
since the interrupt handler may change the value of the variable
at any time).</p>

<p>Next I&nbsp;would write an interrupt handler which looked
something like this:</p>

<pre><font color="#008080"><b>void interrupt handler(...) </b></font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080"><b>{</b></font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080"><b> time++;               // Update time value</b></font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080"><b> oldhandler();         // call the old handler</b></font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080"><b> // If we are not already mixing then we should try and mix some more</b></font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080"><b> if (!mixing)</b></font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080"><b> {</b></font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080"><b>  mixing = 1;    // Indicate that we are now mixing</b></font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080"><b>  _asm sti;      // Enable interrupts</b></font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080"><b>  MixSound();    // Go mix</b></font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080"><b>  mixing = 0;    // No longer mixing</b></font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080"><b> }</b></font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080"><b>}</b></font></pre>

<p>This code starts by incrementing the <b>time</b> variable.
Thus, the main application can simply read this variable at any
time and divide by 1024 to get the number of seconds elapsed (or
divide by 1.024 to get he number of milliseconds). The handler
should then calls the old handler so that the interrupt is
acknowledged (can also be accomplished with the
outp(0x20,0x20)&nbsp;instruction). The handler then does sound
mixing.</p>

<p>You can see that the interrupt handler I've designed calls a
function called MixSound(). I assume that this function
determines whether there is any sound to be mixed into the
playback buffer, and if so does whatever it needs to do. Now if
this function mixes 1/2 a second of sound (say)&nbsp;at a time,
then quite a few int 0x70's may be triggered while it is mixing.
Normally our handler wouldn't be called for these, and we'd see a
slight &quot;glitch&quot;&nbsp;in animation&quot; since the <b>time</b>
variable would have skipped over a few interrupts.. For this
purpose it is important that interrupts are enabled while the
mixing is in progress, so that further int 0x70's interrupt the
sound mixing function and are still processed (hence the <b>_asm
sti</b> statement). The problem though is that this will cause
the MixSound()&nbsp;function to be called again when it's already
in the middle of mixing sound - the result of which is
potentially disastrous. For this reason I&nbsp;maintain the <b>mixing</b>
variable, so that while mixing is in progress the variable is set
and the handler doesn't try to call the mixing routine again.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;haven't actually tried using the CMOS timer for tripple
buffering, but I&nbsp;imagine it would be pretty straightforward.
If you are in a 60Hz display mode then retraces would occurr
every 1024/60=17.0666 ticks or so (make sure you stay synched to
the retrace, I'd probably start polling the VGA card after about
15 ticks or so just to be safe). I'd use a loop similar to the
MixSound() loop above, which would instead poll the vertical
retrace bit waiting for the retrace to start. It should then read
the current time value, calculate when the next retrace is due to
start (current time +&nbsp;15)&nbsp;and then go do whatever it
has to do.</p>

<p>One last thing I'd like to point out is that the <b>time</b>
variable I&nbsp;use is a 32-bit unsigned long. This means that
it's value would wrap around to 0 after 4294967296 ticks, which
is about once every seven weeks. I&nbsp;can't imagine very many
programs which would be left running for this long, but it's best
to keep it in mind anyway.</p>
