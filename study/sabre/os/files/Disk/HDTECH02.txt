Before we consider how to install, configure and maintain hard drives, 
we need a basic understanding of drive construction and design concepts.  
This chapter examines in some detail the parts and functional components 
of hard drive subsystems.

(Note : A number of acronyms are used throughout this chapter and the 
glossary for this booklet is not yet available.  Therefore, I have 
attached a brief set of definitions for some of the terminology.)

HARD DRIVES AND CONTROLLERS:

A hard drive subsystem is comprised of the following components: 

1. The Hard Disk, with one or more boards (PCB) attached.
2. A Controller Mechanism, either on the hard disk PCB or on the bus
   adapter within the PC.
3. Bus Adapter for interfacing the controller to the host PC.
4. Cables and Connectors to link it all together.

========================================================================
THE HARD DISK:

Within a sealed enclosure (Head Disk Assembly or HDA) are one or more 
rigid  platters that are "fixed" or non-removable.  These are coated 
with magnetically sensitized material and data can be written to and 
read from the surface by means of electromagnetic read/write heads.  
When powered up, the platters are constantly rotating (except for 
certain pre-programmed sleep modes) and the heads are moved back and 
forth across the surface to access different locations.  This is a 
sealed unit which should not be opened, except by qualified personnel in 
a controlled, dust free environment.  

The circuit board(s) attached to the outside of the HDA provide the 
electronics needed for physical control of the motors within the sealed 
unit.  They interface the source of electrical power and control signals 
to the disk assembly through various connectors and cables.  Most boards 
have some jumpers, dip switches and/or resistors that are used for 
configuration purposes.  

Functionally, these PCB's are separate from the Hard Disk Controller, 
but many of the newer drives (IDE and SCSI) embed the controller chip 
directly onto this board (as opposed to having it on the Bus adapter).

INSIDE THE HDA - PARTS OF A HARD DISK:

1. Disk Platter(s), separated by spacers and held together by a clamp.
2. Spindle shaft onto which platters are mounted.
3. Spindle motor for rotating the platters.
4. Electromagnetic read/write heads (usually, one per surface).
5. Access arms or armatures from which the heads are suspended.
6. Actuator for moving the arms (with heads attached).
7. Preamplifier circuitry to maximize read/write signals.
8. Air filter and pressure vent.

The Platters:

Most platters or disks are made of an aluminum alloy, though ceramic or 
glass platters can also be found.  The diameter is normally 2 1/2", 3 
1/2" or 5 1/4" with a hole in the center for mounting onto the spindle 
shaft.  Thickness of the media can vary from less than 1/32 of an inch 
to about 1/8 of an inch. 

During manufacture the platters are coated with a magnetizable material. 
Older drives used a ferrite compound applied by squirting a solution 
onto the surface and rotating at high speeds to distribute the material 
by centrifugal force.  This process left a rust colored ferrite layer 
which was then hardened, polished and coated with a lubricant.

Newer drives apply the magnetic layer by plating a thin metal film onto 
the surface through galvanization or sputtering.  These surfaces have a 
shiny chrome-like appearance.

Spindle and Spindle Motors:

Most drives have several platters that are separated by disk spacers and 
clamped to a rotating spindle that turns the platters in unison.  A 
direct drive, brushless spindle motor is built into the spindle or 
mounted directly below it. (Sometimes this motor is visible from outside 
of the sealed enclosure.) The spindle, and consequently the platters, 
are rotated at a constant speed, usually 3,600 RPM, though newer models 
have increased that to 4800, 5400, or 7,200.

The spindle motor receives control signals through a closed loop 
feedback system that stabilizes to a constant rotation speed.  Control 
signals come from information written onto the surface(s) during 
manufacture or with older drives, from physical sensors.  

Read/Write Heads:

Since both sides of each platter are coated to provide separate 
surfaces, there is normally one electromagnetic read/write head for each 
side of each platter.  Therefore, a drive with 4 platters would have 8 
sides and 8 heads.  Some drives use one side as a dedicated surface for 
control signals leaving an odd number (5,7,etc.) of heads for actual 
use.

Each head is mounted onto the end of an access arm and these arms (one 
per surface) are moved in unison under the control of a single actuator 
mechanism.  When one head is over track 143, all the heads on all other 
sides should be at the same location over their respective surfaces.

Generally speaking, only one of the heads is active at any given time.  
There are some drives that can read or write from two or more heads at a 
time, but while this has been common with main frame drives, it 
represents a major design change for personal computers and the 
technology is not yet widely used. 

The spinning disk(s) create an air cushion over which the heads float.  
Depending on design, this air buffer ranges from 2 to 15 microns.  By 
contrast, a smoke particle or finger print is about 30 microns in size! 

The heads are not supposed to come into contact with the surface during 
rotation.  Only when powered off should the heads come to rest on the 
surface, but this should be over a specific area of the surface, 
reserved for that purpose.  Most drives built since the late 1980's 
employ an automatic parking feature which moves the heads to this 
designated region and may even lock the heads there until powered up. 

Head Actuators:

The head actuator is the positioning mechanism used to move the arms and 
consequently the heads, back and forth over the surface.  Once again, 
earlier drives used a different method than is now common. 

Originally, head positioning was controlled by a stepper motor that 
rotated in either direction by reacting to stepper pulses and moving the 
head assembly back and forth by means of a "rack and pinion" or by 
spooling and unspooling a band attached to the actuator arms.  Each 
pulse moved the assembly over the surface in predefined steps or 
detents.  Each step represented a track location and data was expected 
to be under the head.  This design, still used for floppy drives, is not 
suitable for current drive densities and is prone to alignment problems 
caused by friction, wear and tear, heat deformation, and lack of 
feedback information needed for correcting positioning error. 

The more common voice coil actuator controls the movement of a coil  
toward or away from a permanent magnet based upon the amount of current 
flowing through it.  The armatures are attached to this coil and move in 
and out over the surface with it.  This is a very precise method, but 
also very sensitive.  Any variation in the current can cause the head 
assembly to change position and there are no pre-defined positions. 
Inherently this is an analog system, with the exact amount of movement 
controlled by the exact amount of current applied. 

The actual position of the coil is determined by servo (or indexing) 
information, which is written to the drive by the manufacturer.  
Location is adjusted to different tracks by reading and reacting to 
these control signals.

Internal Electronics:

There is surprisingly little circuitry found within the sealed HDA.  
There are electrical and control wires for the spindle and head actuator 
motors and the head assembly has flex cables with a preamplifier chip 
often built onto it.  This chip takes pulses from the heads (as close to 
the source as possible) and cleans up and amplifies these signals before 
transmission to components outside of the housing.

Air Filtering and Ventilation:

Minor wear of internal components and occasional contact of the heads 
with the surface can cause microscopic particles to be loosened within 
the HDA.  A permanent air filter is mounted within the air stream to 
remove these particles before they can cause damage to delicate 
mechanisms.  

Most drives also have a small vent to allow for minor air exchange from 
outside of the housing.  This allows for equalization of air pressure so 
drives can be used in different environments without risk of imploding 
or exploding.  

========================================================================
CONTROLLERS AND BUS ADAPTERS:

The hard disk controller provides the logical link between a hard disk 
unit and the program code within the host computer.  It reacts to 
requests from the computer by sending seek, read, write, and control 
signals to the drive and must interpret and control the flow of data. 

Data moving to and from the drive includes sector ID's, positioning 
information and timing or clock signals.  The controller must encode, 
decode and separate this control information from actual data written to 
or read from the drive.  

Also, data is sent to and from the drive serially, in bit format, but 
the CPU wants to recieve at least a byte (8 bits) at a time.  The 
controller must take bits (8 - 16 - or 32 at a time) and assemble them 
into bytes, words, and doublewords that can be transferred to/from the 
computer.       

"OUR INDUSTRY MUST LOVE STANDARDS - WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF THEM!"

And so it is with hard disk controllers.

Controllers can be categorized in several different ways, by :

Basic computer design (PC/XT vs AT-286-386-486,etc)
  - as mentioned in the first chapter, standard AT controllers use
    different I/O addresses, IRQ and employ PIO as opposed to DMA.

Bus Architecture (8-16 bit ISA, 32 bit MCA/EISA/VLB/PCI, etc.)
  - The adapter must be designed to interface with and use features of
    available expansion spots in the host computer.

Controller Card vs Adapter
  - The expansion board that plugs into the PC is commonly referred to
    as a controller card, but for many drives (primarily IDE and SCSI)
    the controller mechanism is built directly onto the drive PCB and
    the expansion board in the PC (or built into motherboard) is
    actually a Host/Bus adapter.

TROUBLESHOOTING TIP - If the BIOS reports "HDD CONTROLLER FAILURE" don't 
assume the problem is with your AT/IO board.  It might well be the drive 
PCB that has failed.

Controller/Drive Interface
  - Both drive and controller must communicate in the same 'language'
    and several different standards for electrical properties and
    logical meaning of signals have been established.  These
    include ST506/412, ESDI, SCSI, IDE(ATA/XTA) and EIDE(ATA2).

Data Encoding Method
   - Determines how densely data can be packed onto a track. MFM
     encoding is sufficient for only 17 x 512 byte sectors per track.
     RLL permits up to 27 and variations of ARLL allow 34 or more
     sectors per track.  This recording density is a major determinant
     of storage capacity, and with rotation speed and interleave are
     critical factors for true data transfer capability.

Support for Translation
    - Some controllers present different logical parameters to the PC
      than the actual physical geometry of the drive.

Need for ROM Extension or Software Device Driver
    - Additional program code is used to provide support for hard drives
      when none exists (as in PC/XTs), to implement translation schemes
      (as in ST506/RLL and ESDI designs), allow for non-standard devices
      or features (SCSI), or for a combination of these (EIDE).


Below is a quick list of the major combinations that have been used in 
PCs past and present.  While I am sure many others could be added, these 
are the ones I have come across over the years.

         *   ESDI drives have some of the controller logic built onto
             the hard drive PCB and some on the controller card.
         **  PS/2 ESDI uses the same physical interface as other ESDI
             devices, but supports additional features specific to their
             implementation.
         *** 16 bit? 32 bit? Who knows?  I have never been sure.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not to mention hundreds of other combinations to support different 
interleaves, track buffers, hardware caching, bus mastering, error 
correction schemes, SCSI I-II-III, optional floppy control, ESDI to SCSI 
converters,  ST506 to SCSI converters (etc., etc., etc.).

So, what does all this mean to you?

Specifically, don't be surprised if the drive you have in your left 
hand, does not work correctly with the controller / adapter you have in 
your right hand.   Also, if controllers are changed it may affect 
performance as well as the ability to access previously recorded data.

How to deal with some of this confusion will be addressed in
CHAPTER 3 - Installing and Configuring Hard Drives.

ADDITIONAL READING MATERIAL:
========================================================================

I have always had difficulty finding appropriate reading material to 
recommend, but there are a few sources that I consider a must for 
technicians and support personnel.

First, a number of Internet Newsgroups have exceptional FAQ's 
(Frequently Asked Questions) which are updated and posted on a regular 
basis.  These include:

"YET ANOTHER ATA-2/FAST-ATA/EIDE FAQ"
by John Wehman and Peter Herweijer
Newsgroup : comp.sys.ibm.hardware.storage

"BIOS TYPES"
by Hale Landis
Newsgroup : comp.sys.ibm.hardware.storage

"SCSI FAQ - 2 Parts"
by Gary A. Field
Newsgroup : comp.periphs.scsi

While bookstores are full of titles, most of them simply provide a 
rehash of basics.  The following two books are an important part of my 
library because they cover much more than the usual:

"THE INDISPENSABLE PC HARDWARE BOOK" by Hans-Peter Messmer (1994)
Addison-Wesley Publishing Company,
ISBN - 0-201-62424-9

"THE UNDOCUMENTED PC" by Frank Van Gilluwe (1994)
Addison-Wesley Publishing Company,
ISBN - 0-201-62277-7

Other books well worth the read include:

"THE HARD DISK SURVIVAL GUIDE" by Mark Minasi (1991)
Sybex Inc.,
ISBN - 0-89588-799-1
A little dated, but full of useful information.  Hopefully there is a 
revised and updated version.

"OFFICIAL SPINRITE II AND HARD DISK COMPANION" by J. M. Goodman, (1990)
IDG Books Worldwide, Inc.,
ISBN - 878058-08-8
Current advances are not covered, but great explanation of drive basics.

"HARD DRIVE BIBLE" by Martin Bodo (1993)
Corporate Systems Center (CSC)
My copy is the sixth edition from April, 1993.  The first 50 pages of 
the book should be of interest (though not always clearly organized). 
The balance of the book (150 pages) is a listing of drive types and 
jumper settings.  It's quite good, but keeping something like that 
updated is virtually impossible.  

WARNING - DO NOT BUY - "The Data Recovery Bible" by Pamela Kane.
Poorly organized material, most of which has nothing to do with data 
recovery.  Waste of a good title if you ask me! 

========================================================================
ACRONYM DEFINITIONS:
========================================================================

IRQ (Interrupt Request) - Lines on the bus used to signal hardware 
interrupts.

I/O (Input Output) - Peripherals accessible by the CPU through registers 
at specific I/O addresses (or I/O ports).

PIO (Programmed Input Output) - Exchange of data between memory and 
peripherals by means of Input Output commands.

DMA (Dynamic Memory Access) - Transferring data directly between memory 
and peripherals without going through the CPU.

BUS ARCHITECTURES:

ISA (Industry Standard Architecture) - 8 bit and 16 bit expansion slots 
used by PC, XT, and AT designs.  Often called IBM Standard Architecture.

EISA (Extended Industry Standard Architecture) - Developed by several 
independent manufacturers (Compaq, AST, Zenith, Tandy, etc.) to 
standardize 32 bit operation and combat IBM's MCA.

MCA (Micro Channel Architecture) - Expansion bus introduced by IBM in 
1987, used by some (but not all) PS/2 models.

PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) - High speed bus developed by 
Intel to support the demands of Pentium and 486 based computers.

VLB (VESA Local Bus) - High speed, 32 bit extension to the ISA bus 
promoted by the VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association).

DRIVE INTERFACES:

ST506/412 - Standard interface used on XT and AT drives and controllers. 
Originally developed by Seagate Technologies to support their ST506
(5 MB) and ST412 (10 MB) drives.  The entire controller mechanism is 
located on a controller card and communications between the drive and 
controller flow over 2 ribbon cables - one for drive control and one for 
data.

ESDI (Enhanced Small Device Interface) - Developed by Maxtor in the 
early 1980's as an upgrade and improvement to the ST506 design.  While 
the drive does not have an embedded controller, one of the most critical  
functions ,encoding-decoding, is performed on the drive.  This allows 
for faster communications and higher drive capacities.  Uses the same 
cabling as ST506 interface, but carries different signals on each line. 

SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) - Based on an original design by 
Shugart Associates, SCSI is not specifically a drive interface, but a 
method of allowing different devices to communicate with a PC.  For hard 
drives the entire controller is built onto the drive PCB, allowing for 
very high speed transfers to and from the drive.  Fully interpreted,  
parallel data is then transferred to and from the PC by way of a single 
cable through a bus interface that has configured the device as a hard 
drive.

IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) - A technology pioneered by Compaq 
and Conner that embedded a controller onto the hard disk PCB while 
maintaining compatibility with the register level commands sent by the 
computer's INT 13 routines.  IDE drives are configured and appear to the 
computer like standard ST506 drives.

ATA (AT Attachment) - Implementation of the IDE design with a 16 bit AT 
style controller on board the drive.

XTA (XT Attachment) - Rarely used implementation of IDE with an 
integrated 8 bit XT controller.

ATA-2 - Enhancement to the AT Attachment standard to provide for 
considerable performance improvement and more sophisticated drive 
identification.

EIDE (Enhanced IDE) and FAST-ATA - Various implementations of the ATA-2 
standard as marketed by Western Digital (EIDE) and Seagate/Quantum 
(FAST-ATA).

DATA ENCODING SCHEMES

MFM (Modified Frequency Modulation) - Common technique used to encode 
the magnetic fluxes recorded on a drive into data.  Still used on floppy 
drives and most original XT and AT systems.  Notice that most drive 
types supported by the motherboard BIOS have 17 sectors per track.  This 
is the standard density for MFM encoding. 

RLL (Run Length Limited) - Encoding method that allows 50% more 
information to be recorded on a track than MFM.  Accomplished by 
recording larger representations for every byte, but able to pack them 
more tightly onto the surface, because of fewer actual flux changes.  
Often called 2,7 RLL because the recording scheme involves patterns with 
no more than 7 successive zeros and no less than two. 

ARLL (Advanced Run Length Limited) - More complex yet powerful 
derivatives of the RLL scheme.  Include 1,7 and 3,9 encoding.  Most 
every new drive made today uses some form of RLL or ARLL encoding.
