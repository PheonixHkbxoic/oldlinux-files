<h1><a name="IDETECH_006"><b>5</b>.  Register Address Decoding</a></h1>

The host addresses the drive with programmed I/O. Host address lines A0, A1,
A2, chip select CS1FX- and CS3FX-, IOR- and IOW- address the disk registers.
Host address lines A3...A9 generate the two chip selects: CS1FX- and CS3FX-.<p>

Chip select CS1FX- accesses the eight hard disk Command Block Registers.
Chip select CS3FX- is valid during 8 bit transfers to/from the Control Block
registers alternate status and Device Control, and drive address.<p>

The drive selects the primary or alternate command block addresses using
address bit A7.<p>

(Note: What the above sentence means is that there is a provision for a primary
host adapter at I/O address 1FX/3FX and a secondary host adapter at I/O adress
17X/37X. Each host adapter can have up to two hard drives MASTER/SLAVED off it).<p>

See below for a graphical explanation:<p>


<pre>

HEX  BINARY          DESCRIPTION

1FX  0001 1111 XXXX  Primary Command Registers
3FX  0011 1111 XXXX  Primary Control Registers

17X  0001 0111 XXXX  Alternate Command Registers
37X  0011 0111 XXXX  Alternate Control Registers

  +--- Address bit A7
</pre>

X means "don't care" i.e. X can be 0h, 1h, 2h, ..., Dh, Eh, Fh or 0b, 1b).<p>

Data bus lines D8...D15 are valid only when IOCS16- is active and the drive is
transferring data. The transfer of ECC information occurs only on data bus lines
D0...D7 and data bus lines D8...D15 are invalid during such transfer.<p>

<hr>

<h1><a name="IDETECH_007"><b>6</b>.  Pin Descriptions</a></h1>

<dl>
<dt> -RESET
<dd>is asserted for at least 25 microseconds after voltage levels have
 stabilized during power on and negated thereafer unless the drive
 needs to be reset at a later time.<p>

<dt>D0...D15
<dd>bidirectional data bus. D0...D7 are used during 8 bit data transfers
 e.g. registers and ECC bytes.<p>

<dt>KEY
<dd>is not a connection. The connection pin is missing and forms part of a
 mechanism that prevents the IDC connector from being reverse connected.<p>

<dt>-IOW
<dd>is the Write strobe signal. The rising edge of -IOW clocks data from
 from the host to the drive.<p>

<dt>-IOR
<dd>is the Read strobe signal. The falling edge of -IOR enables data from
 the drive onto the host data bus.<p>

<dt>-IOCHRDY
<dd>is negated to extend the host transfer cycle of any host register
 read/write access when the drive is not ready to respond to a data
 transfer request. When not negated, it is in a high impedance state.<p>

<dt>SPSYNC
<dd>spindle synchronization. This may be either input or output to the
 drive depending on a vendor defined switch. If a drive is set to MASTER
 the signal is output and if a drive is SLAVE the signal is input. There
 is no requirement that each drive implementation be plug compatible to
 the extent that a multiple vendor drive subsystem be operable. However
 if drives are designed to match the following recommendations then
 controllers can operate drives with a single implementation:<p>

 There can only be one MASTER drive at a time in a configuration. The
 host or the drive designated as master can generate SPSYNC at least
 once per revolution (it may be more than onceper revolution).<p>

 SPSYNC received by a drive is used as the synchronization signal to
 lock the spindles in step. The time to achieve synchronization varies
 and is indicated by the drive setting DRDY. If the drive does not
 achieve synchronization, it will not set DRDY.<p>

 A master drive or a host generates SPSYNC and transmits it. A slave
 does not generate SPSYNC and must be responsible to synchronize its
 index to SPSYNC. If a drive does not support synchronization, it will
 ignore SPSYNC. In the event that a previously synchronized drive loses
 synchronization, it does not clear DRDY.<p>

 Prior to the introduction of this standard, this signal was defined as
 ALE (Address Latch Enable) and was used for an address valid indication
 from the host system. If used, the host address and chip selects, ADDR0
 through ADDR2, CS1FX- and CS3FX- were valid at the negation of this
 signal and remained valid while ALE was negated, therefore the drive
 did not need to latch these signals with ALE.<p>

<dt>INTRQ
<dd>is used to interrupt the host system when the drive has a pending
 interrupt, the drive is selected and the host has enabled drive
 interrupts by clearing nIEN in the Device Control Register.<p>

 INTRQ is negated by:<p>
   <ul>
   <li>assertion of -RESET.
   <li>the setting of SRST in the Device Control Register.
   <li>the host writing to the Command Register.
   <li>the host reading the Status Register.
   </ul>

 NOTE: Some drives may negate INTRQ on PIO data transfer completion,
 except on a single sector read or on the last sector of a multi-sector
 read. On PIO transfers INTRQ is asserted at the begining of each data
 block to be transfered. A data block is usually a single sector except
 when declared otherwise via the Set Multiple Command. An exception
 occurs on Format Track, Write Sector(s), Write Buffer and Write Long
 commands and INTRQ will not be asserted at the begining of the first
 data block to be transferred.<p>

<dt>-IOCS16
<dd>indicates to the host that the 16 bit data port has been addressed and
 the drive is prepared to send/receive a 16 bit data word. This signal
 is an open collector output. D8...D15 are only valid when -IOCS16 is
 active and the drive is transferring data. The transfer of ECC data
 occurs only on D0...D7 so D8...D15 are invalid during ECC transfers.<p>

<dt>ADDR0-2
<dd>used to select a register or a data port in the drive.<p>

<dt>-PDIAG
<dd>will be asserted by Drive 1 to indicate to Drive 0 that it has passed
 diagnostics. Following a power-on reset or software reset, Drive 1 will
 negate -PDIAG within 1 msec to indicate to Drive 0 that it is busy.<p>

 Drive 1 will then assert -PDIAG within 30 secs to indicate that it is
 no longer busy and can provide status information. After the assertion
 of -PDIAG, Drive 1 may be unable to accept commands until it has
 finished its reset procedure and DRDY is set.<p>

 Following the receipt of a valid Execute Drive Diagnostics command,
 Drive 1 will negate -PDIAG within 1 msec to indicate to Drive 0 that
 it is busy and has not yet passed its drive diagnostics. If Drive 1 is
 pressent, then Drive 0 will wait for up to 5 msec from the receipt of
 a valid Execte Drive Diagnostics command for Drive 1 to assert -PDIAG.
 Drive 1 should clear BUSY beforeasserting -PDIAG as -PDIAG is used to
 indicate the Drive 1 has passed its diagnostics and is ready to post
 status.<p>

 If -DASP was not asserted by Drive 1 during reset initialization,
 Drive 0 will post its own status immediately after it completes its
 diagnostics and clear the Drive 1 Status Register to 00h. Drive 0 may
 be unable to accept commands until it has finished its reset procedure
 and DRDY is set.<p>

<dt>-CS1FX
<dd>is a chip select generated by address decoding circuitry from host
 address lines A3...A9. Usually asserted during I/O operations to ports
 1F0 through 1F7. -CS1FX is used to access the eight hard disk Command
 Block Registers.<p>

<dt>-CS3FX
<dd>is a chip select generated by address decoding circuitry from host
 address lines A3...A9. Usually asserted during I/O operations to ports
 3F0 through 3F7. -CS3FX is valid during 8 bit transfers to/from the
 Control Block Registers, Alternate Status Register, Device Control
 Register and drive address.<p>

 NOTE: The primary host adapter is accessed via I/O addresses 1FX and
 3FX while the secondary host adapter is accessed via I/O addresses 17X
 and 37X. See Ed's note under the paragraph "Register Address Decoding"
 above.<p>

<dt>-DASP
<dd>is a time multiplexed signal which indicates that a drive is active or
 that Drive 1 is present. It is an open collector output.<p>

 During power-on initialization or after reset, -DASP will be asserted
 by Drive 1 within 400 msec to indicate its presence. Drive 0 will allow
 up to 450 msec for Drive 1 to assert -DASP. If Drive 1 is not present,
 Drive 0 may use -DASP to drive an activity LED.<p>

 -DASP will be negated following acceptance of the first valid command
 by Drive 1 or after 31 seconds, whichever comes first. Any time after
 negation of -DASP, it may be used by either drive as an activity
 indicator.

this register. Also, the port to which the sector table is transferred during
execution of the Format command. Transfers of ECC bytes during the execution
of Read/Write Long commands are 8 bit transfers.<p>

<dt>1F1: Read: ERROR REGISTER

</pre>

<dt>1F1: Write: WRITE PRECOMPENSATION
<dd>The drive ignores the write precompensation value passed by the host.<p>

<dt>1F2: Read/Write: SECTOR COUNT REGISTER
<dd>Defines the number of sectors of data to be transferred across the host bus,
for the subsequent command. If the value in this register is zero, the sector
count is 256 sectors. If the command executes successfully, the value in this
register at command completion is zero. As each sector is transferred, the
Sector Count register is decremented by one to reflect the number of sectors
remaining to be transferred. If the command execution is not successful, this
register contains the number of sectors that must be transferred to complete
the original request.<p>

<dt>1F3: Read/Write: SECTOR NUMBER REGISTER
<dd> Contains the ID number of the first sector to be accessed by the subsequent
command. The sector can be from one to the maximum number of sectors per track.
See the command description for additional information about the contents of
the Sector Number Register following command completion whether successful or
unsuccessful.<p>

<dt>1F4: Read/Write: CYLINDER LOW REGISTER
<dd>Contains the eight low order bits of the starting cylinder address for any disk
access. On multiple sector transfers that cross cylinder boundaries, this
register is updated at the end of the command to reflect the current cylinder

|  7  |  BUSY    | Busy bit. Set by the controller logic of the drive when  |
|     |          | ever the drive has access to and the host is locked out  |
|     |          | of the Command Block Registers. Set under the following  |
|     |          | conditions:                                              |
|     |          |  o Within 400 nsec after the negation of RESET or after  |
|     |          |    SRST is set in the Device Control Register. After a   |
|     |          |    reset it is recomended that BUSY be set no more than  |
|     |          |    30 seconds.                                           |
|     |          |  o Within 400 nsec of a host write to the Command        |
|     |          |    Register with a Recalibrate, Read Long, Read Buffer,  |
|     |          |    Read, Read Verify, Initialize Drive Parameters, Seek  |
|     |          |    Identify Drive, or Execute Drive Diagnostic command.  |
|     |          |  o Within 5 microseconds following the transfer of 512   |
|     |          |    bytes of data during the execution of a Write, Write  |
|     |          |    Buffer or Format Track command; or 512 bytes of data  |
|     |          |    and the appropriate number of ECC bytes during the    |
|     |          |    execution of a Write Long command.                    |
|     |          |    When BUSY is set no Command Block Register can be     |
|     |          |    written too and a read of any Command Block Register  |
|     |          |    returns the contents of the Status Register.          |
|     |          |                                                          |
|  6  |  DRDY    | Drive Ready bit. Indicates that the drive is ready to    |
|     |          | accept commands. When and error occurs, this bit stays   |
|     |          | unchanged until the host reads the Status Register then  |
|     |          | again indicates that hte drive is ready. On power up,    |
|     |          | this bit should be cleared and should remain cleared     |
|     |          | until the drive is up to speed and ready to accept a     |
|     |          | command.                                                 |

|  5  |  DWF     | Drive Write Fault bit. When an error occurs, this bit    |
|     |          | remains unchanged until the host reads the Status        |
|     |          | Register, then again indicates the current write fault   |
|     |          | status.                                                  |

|  4  |  DSC     | Drive Seek Complete bit. This bit is set when a seek     |
|     |          | operation is complete and the heads are settled over a   |
|     |          | track. When an error occurs, this bit remains unchanged  |
|     |          | until the host reads the Status Register, then again it  |
|     |          | indicates the current seek complete status.              |
|     |          |                                                          |
|  3  |  DRQ     | Data Request bit. When set it indicates that the drive   |
|     |          | is ready to transfer a word or byte of data between the  |
|     |          | host and the data port.                                  |

|  2  |  CORR    | Corrected Data bit. When a correctable data error has    |
|     |          | been encountered and the data has been corrected, this   |
|     |          | bit is set. This condition does not terminate a multi    |
|     |          | sector read operation.                                   |
|     |          |                                                          |
|  1  |  INDEX   | Index bit. Set when the index mark is detected once per  |
|     |          | disk revolution.                                         |

|  0  |  ERROR   | Error bit. When set indicates that the previous command  |
|     |          | ended in an error. The other bits in the Error Register  |
|     |          | and Status Register contain additional information about |
|     |          | the cause of the error.                                  |

<h1><a name="IDETECH_010"><b>9</b>.  Command Descriptions</a></h1>

The drive decodes and executes commands loaded into the Command Register. In
applications involving two hard drives, both drives receive all commands but
only the selected drive executes commands. The recommended procedure for
executing a command on the selected drive is:<p>

<ol>
<li> Wait for drive to clear BUSY.
<li> Load required parameters in the Command Block Registers.
<li> Activate the Interrupt Enable (nIEN) bit.
<li> Wait for drive to set DRDY.
<li> Write the command code to the Command Register.
</ol>

Execution of the command begins as soon as the drive loads the Command Block
Register. The remainder of this section describes the function of each command.<p>

<dl>
<dt>90h: Execute Drive Diagnostic
<dd>Performs internal diagnostic tests implemented by the drive. Drive 0 sets
BUSY within 400 nsec of the receipt of the command.<p>

If Drive 1 is present:<p>

<ul>
<li>Both drives execute diagnostics.
<li>Drive 0 waits up to 5 seconds for Drive 1 to assert PDIAG-
<li>If Drive 1 does not assert PDIAG-, indicatinf a failure, Drive 0 appends 80h with its own diagnostic status.
<li>If the host detects a Drive 1 diagnostic failure when reading Drive 0 status it sets the DRV bit then reads the Drive 1 status.
</ul>

     If Drive 1 is not present:<p>

     <ul>
     <li>Drive 0 reports only its own diagnostic results.
     <li>Drive 0 clears BUSY and generates an interrupt.
     </ul>

     If Drive 1 fails diagnostics, Drive 0 appends 80h with its own diagnostic
     status and loads that code in the Error Register. If Drive 1 passes its
     diagnostics or no Drive 1 is present, Drive 0 appends 00h with its own
     diagnostic status and loads that in the Error Register.<p>

     The Diagnostic Code written to the Error Register is a unique 8 bit code as
     listed below.<p>

+------+----------------------------------+
| Code | Description                      |
+------+----------------------------------+
|  01  | No error detected.               |
|  02  | Formatter device error.          |
|  03  | Sector buffer error.             |
|  04  | ECC circuitry error.             |
|  05  | Controller microprocessor error. |
|  8X  | Drive 1 failed.                  |
+------+----------------------------------+
</pre>

<dt>50h: Format Track

<dd>The track address is specified in the Sector Count Register. When the drive
     accepts this command, it sets the DRQ bit then waits for the host to fill
     the sector buffer. When the buffer is full, the drive clears DRQ, sets BUSY
     and begins command execution.<p>

<dt>ECh: Identify Drive

<dd>This command enables the host to receive paramater information from the
     drive. When the host issues this command, the drive sets BUSY, stores the
     required parameter information in the sector buffer, sets DRQ and generates
     an interrupt. The host then reads the information from the sector buffer.
     The table below defines the words stored in the buffer. All reserved fields
     should be zeros.<p>

<dt>91h: Initialize Drive Parameters
<dd>This command wnables the host to set the head switch and sector wrap values
     for multi sector operations. Upon receipt of the command the drive sets
     BUSY and generates an interrupt. The only two registers used are the Sector
     Count Register which specifies the number of sectors and the Drive/Head
     Register which specifies the number of heads minus one. The DRV bit assigns
     these values to Drive 0 or Drive 1 as appropriate.<p>

     This command does not check the sector count and head values for validity.
     If these values are invalid, the drive will not report an error until
     another command causes an illegal access.<p>

<dt>1Xh: Recalibrate
<dd>This command moves the read/write heads from any location on the disk to
     cylinder 0. Upon receipt of this command, the drive sets BUSY and issues
     a seek to cylinder 0. The drive the waits for the seel to complete, updates
     status, negates BUSY and generates an interrupt.<p>

<dt>E4h: Read buffer
<dd>This command enables the host to read the current contents of the drive's
     sector buffer. When the host issues this command, the drive sets BUSY, sets
     up the sector buffer for a read operation, sets DRQ, clears BUSY, and
     generates an interrupt. The host then reads up to 512 bytes of data from
     the buffer.<p>

     Read Buffer and Write Buffer commands are synchronizes so that sequential
     Read Buffer and Write Buffer commands access the same 512 bytes within the
     buffer.<p>

<dt>20h: Read Sectors with Retry
<dt>21h: Read Sectors without Retry

<dd>The Read Sectors command reads from 1 to 256 sectors, beginning at the
     specified sector. As specified in the Command Bloks Register, a sector
     count equal to 0 requests 256 sectors. When the drive accepts this command
     it sets BUSY and begins execution of the command.<p>

     For single sector reads, the drive performs an implicit seek if it is not
     on the requested track. Once there it looks for the appropriate ID field.<p>

     For no retry commands, if two index pulses occur without an error free read
     of the requested ID field, the drive posts an ID not found error in the
     Error Register.<p>

     For retry commands, the drive attempts to read the ID field up to a vendor
     specific number of retries before reporting the error.<p>

     If the drive reads the requested ID field correctly, it must recognize the
     data address mark within a specified number of bytes or report a data
     address mark not found error. Once the drive finds the data address mark
     it reads the data field into the sector buffer. If an error occurs the
     drive sets the error bits, sets DRQ and generates an interrupt. The drive
     always sets DRQ regardles of the presence or absence of an error condition
     at the end of the sector. Upon command completion the Command Block
     Register contains the cylinder, head, sector of the last sector read.<p>

<dt>22h: Read Long with Retry
<dt>23h: Read Long without Retry
<dd>For multiple sector reads, the drive sets DRQ, clears BUSY and generates
     an interrupt each time the drive is ready to sent a sector to the host.
     When the sector transfer completes the drive clears DRQ and on all except
     the last sector sets BUSY. At the completion of the command, the Command
     Block Register contains the cylinder, head, sector of the last sector read.<p>

     If an uncorrectable error occurs during a multiple sector read, the read
     terminates at the sector in which the error occured. The Command Block
     Register contains the cylinder, head, sector where the error occured. The
     host can then determine what error occurred and where. Whether the error
     was correctable or uncorrectable the drive loads the data in the sector
     buffer.<p>

     When a Read Long command executes, data and ECC bytes contained in the data
     field of the requested sector are returned in the sector buffer. The drive
     does not check the ECC bytes to determine if a data error has occured.
     Multi sector Read Long opperations are supported.<p>

<dt>40h: Read Verify Sector with Retry
<dt>41h: Read Verify Sector without Retry
<dd>The execution of this command is identical to the Read Sectors command but
     the Read Verify command does not cause the drive to set DRQ, and the drive
     transfers no data to the host. On receipt of Read Verify commandm the drive
     sets BUSY. When the requested sectors have been verified, the drive clears
     BUSY and generates an interrupt. Upon command completion the Command Block
     Register contains the cylinder, head, sector of the last sector verified.<p>

     If an error occurs during a multi sector verify, the verify terminates at
     the sector in which the error occured and this can be found in the Command
     Block Register.<p>

<dt>7Xh: Seek
<dd>The seek command initiates a seek to the track and selects the head
     specified in the Command Block Register. It is not necessary for the drive
     to be formatted for a seek to execute properly. When the host issues a Seek
     command the drive sets BUSY and generates an interrupt. The drive will not
     set DSC until the seek is complete. A seek may net be complete before the
     drive returns the interrupt. If the host issues a new command to the drive
     while a seek is in progress, BUSY remains set until the seek completes then
     the drive executes the new command.<p>

<dt>EFh: Set Features
<dd>This command is used by the host to establish parameters that effect the
     execution of certain drive features. When the drive receives this command
     it sets BUSY, checks the contents of the Features Register (Write Precomp
     Register), clears BUSY and generates an interrupt. Features are drive
     specific and may include:<p>

       <ul>
       <li>33h: retry inhibited
       <li>44h: 11 bytes ECC enabled
       <li>55h: disable read cache
       <li>77h: ECC disabled
       <li>88h: ECC enabled
       <li>99h: retry enabled
       <li>AAh: read cache enabled
       <li>BBh: 4 bytes ECC enabled
       </ul>

     If the value in the Feature Register is not supported or is invalid, the
     drive aborts the command.<p>

<dt>E8h: Write Buffer
<dd>This command enables the host to overwrite the contents of the drive's
     sector buffer with any data pattern. On receipt of this comand the drive
     sets BUSY within 400 nsec, sets up the sector buffer for a write operation,
     sets DRQ and clears BUSY. The host then writes up to 512 bytes of data to
     the buffer. The Read Buffer and Write Buffer are synchronized so that back
     to back Read Buffer and Write Buffer commands access the same 512 bytes
     within the buffer.<p>

<dt>30h: Write Sectors with Retry
<dt>31h: Write Sectors without Retry
<dd>This command writes from 1 to 256 sectors beginning at the specified sector
     and as stated earlier, a sector count of 0 in the Command Block Register
     will request 256 sectors. When the drive accepts this command it sets DRQ
     and wait for the host to fill the sector buffer with the data to be written
     to disk. No interrupt is generated to start the first buffer fill operation
     and once the buffer is full the drive clears the DRQ, sets BUSY and begins
     execution of the command.<p>

     For single sector Write operations, the drive sets DRQ upon receipt of the
     command and waits for the host to fill the sector buffer. Once a sector has
     been transferred, the drive sets BUSY and clears DRQ. If the drive is not
     on the requested cylinder and head an inplied seek and/or head switch is
     performed. Once the desired track is reached the drive searches for the
     appropriate ID field.<p>

     If the ID field is read correctly, the information in the buffer, including
     the ECC bytes is written to the disk. When the drive has processed the
     sector, it clears BUSY and generated an interrupt. The host reads the
     Status Register. At the completion of this command the Command Block
     Registers contain the cylinder, head, sector of the last sector written.<p>

     During multi sector Write operations, the drive sets DRQ, clears BUSY and
     generated and interrupt on all but the first sector when it is ready to
     receive a sector from the host. Once the sector transfer comapletes, the
     drive clears DRQ, and sets BUSY. When the last sector has been written to
     the disk, the drive clears BUSY, DRQ is already clear, and generates an
     interrupt. At the completion of the command, the Command Block Registers
     contain the cylinder, head, sector of the last sector written to disk.<p>

     If an error occurs during a multi sector Write operation, the write
     terminates at the sector in which the error occured. The Command Block
     Register contains the cylinder, head, sector of the sector in which the
     error occured. Ther host can then determine which error occured and where.<p>

<dt>32h: Write Long Sectors with Retry
<dt>33h: Write Long Sectors without Retry
<dd>When the Write Long command is executed, the drive writes the data and ECC
     bytes from the sector buffer to disk. The drive does not generate the ECC
     bytes itself. Multi sector Write Long operations are supported. Operation
     is similar to the Write Sector commands above.
