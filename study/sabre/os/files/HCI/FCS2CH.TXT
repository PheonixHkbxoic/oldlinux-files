Instructions for putting FCS handle on CH Flightstick base
----------------------------------------------------------

Here's a quick file to explain the procedure for taking a Thrustmaster
Flight Control Stick and mounting it on a CH Flightstick base, while
keeping all FCS button and hat functions (and only losing the throttle
wheel on the CH base.)

You'll need a small phillips head screwdriver, a pair of wire-cutters,
a pair of wire-strippers, electrical tape, and a T-10 star screwdriver
(or similarly sized allen wrench)

First, remove the bottoms of both bases.  Look at the internals.
You'll see that the potentiomenter layouts for both sticks are very
similar.  The key to doing this whole procedure is removing the cable
from the FCS and installing it in the CH base.  In the Ch, you have 3
wires that connect the pots (1 black, 1 blue, 1 tan)  There is also a
yellow wire that goes to the throttle wheel pot (the blue wire also
goes to this pot as well)  Ignore the throttle wheel pot as it won't
work after the procedure (it uses the same pin assignments in the plug
as the 4-way switch).

Cut the Black, blue, and tan wires that go to the cable.  Cut the
wires leading up to the CH handle triggers.  Cut the yellow wire leading
to the throttle wheel pot.  Now, remove the cable from the base.  On the
FCS, there are also three wires for the pots...a black wire, a white
wire, and a tan wire.  There is also a gray wire connecting the pots
together in the FCS, but you can ignore this wire completely (the pots
in the CH are connected already by part of the blue wire)  Cut the white,
tan, and black wires leading to the FCS cable.  Cut the wires leading up
into the handle of the FCS, making sure to leave plenty of extra wire on
either end as you'll be connecting them right back together.

Now, remove the FCS cable from the base.  Unscrew the CH stick handle
screws and remove the handle from the shaft. Notice that there is a small
pilot hole on the shaft.  This is important as it allows the FCS stick
to fasten to the CH shaft.  Unscrew the FCS stick screws and remove the
free half of the handle.  The other half is screwed to the shaft via a
similar pilot hole. (At this point, use great care with the FCS stick...
the buttons and solder joints are extremely fragile and break easily.)
Unscrew the other half of the handle from the FCS shaft.  Use the screw
to open the small pilot hole in the CH shaft...then connect the handle
to the shaft using the screw.  Thread the wires from the handle back
down the CH shaft, then screw the other half of the FCS handle on to
the assembly.

Well, you're almost done!!  Now, take the FCS cable and connect the pot
wires as follows...

            FCS Cable                      Ch Base and pots
             Black wire         to             Black wire
             White wire         to               Tan Wire
               Tan Wire         to              Blue Wire

Now just reconnect the FCS handle wires to the cable wires, slip the
cable stop into the space provided in the base, and button her up!!  
Then just check the stick out using any program that takes advantage
of the FCS features (I use AOTP to benchtest my stick...it was a dog
with the FCS, but very sprightly with the CH stick...now it has the
best of each!)

well for you as it did for me.  Good luck!!

********************************NOTE**************************************
I downloaded this file from Compuserve because of the problems I experienced 
with the Thrustmaster Flight Control System.  I have since converted my FCS to 
my old CH Flightstick base and have had NO problems since doing this.  The only 
real problem I found was that the person that wrote this left his number only, 
and not his name.  This makes it very hard to contact someone to find out how 
well it worked.  Well you can contact me, Albert Lowe, here on the MPSBBS, or 
through Compuserve at 73233,2455.  If you need help.  I must stress that you 
shouldn't try this unless you have a good dexterity and have worked with 
electrical wiring before.  If you want this done, but don't think you can do it,
get someone that you think can.  

Good Luck,

Albert Lowe
