Hi!

Sometime ago, I tried to use two mice at the
the same PC. It worked, and I used it for a
tron game, and  a simple Air Hockey simulation 
(two player only).

Here's what I've done to use those two mice:
0) Install mouse handler (com1)
1) Save the address of the current hander
2) Point the irq to "no handler installed"
3) Install a mouse handler for com2
4) Save it's address

To get the mouseinformation, just swap the
isr addresses, then use the standard mouse
functions.
