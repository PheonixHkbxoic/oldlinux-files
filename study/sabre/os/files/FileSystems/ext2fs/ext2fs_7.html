An inode uniquely describes a file. Here's what an inode looks like on
disk:
<P>
<PRE>
struct ext2_inode {
  unsigned short i_mode;
  unsigned short i_uid;
  unsigned long  i_size;
  unsigned long  i_atime;
  unsigned long  i_ctime;
  unsigned long  i_mtime;
  unsigned long  i_dtime;
  unsigned short i_gid;
  unsigned short i_links_count;
  unsigned long  i_blocks;
  unsigned long  i_flags;
  unsigned long  i_reserved1;
  unsigned long  i_block[EXT2_N_BLOCKS];
  unsigned long  i_version;
  unsigned long  i_file_acl;
  unsigned long  i_dir_acl;
  unsigned long  i_faddr;
  unsigned char  i_frag;
  unsigned char  i_fsize;
  unsigned short i_pad1;
  unsigned long  i_reserved2[2];
};
</PRE>
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>i_mode</CODE>
<DD>type of file (character, block, link, etc.) and access rights on the
file.
<P>
<DT><CODE>i_uid</CODE>
<DD>uid of the owner of the file.
<P>
<DT><CODE>i_size</CODE>
<DD>logical size in bytes.
<P>
<DT><CODE>i_atime</CODE>
<DD>last time the file was accessed.
<P>
<DT><CODE>i_ctime</CODE>
<DD>last time the inode information of the file was changed.
<P>
<DT><CODE>i_mtime</CODE>
<DD>last time the file content was modified.
<P>
<DT><CODE>i_dtime</CODE>
<DD>when this file was deleted.
<P>
<DT><CODE>i_gid</CODE>
<DD>gid of the file.
<P>
<DT><CODE>i_links_count</CODE>
<DD>number of links pointing to this file.
<P>
<DT><CODE>i_blocks</CODE>
<DD>number of blocks allocated to this file counted in 512 bytes units.
<P>
<DT><CODE>i_flags</CODE>
<DD>flags (see below).
<P>
<DT><CODE>i_reserved1</CODE>
<DD>reserved.
<P>
<DT><CODE>i_block</CODE>
<DD>pointers to blocks (see below).
<P>
<DT><CODE>i_version</CODE>
<DD>version of the file (used by NFS).
<P>
<DT><CODE>i_file_acl</CODE>
<DD>control access list of the file (not used yet).
<P>
<DT><CODE>i_dir_acl</CODE>
<DD>control access list of the directory (not used yet).
<P>
<DT><CODE>i_faddr</CODE>
<DD>block where the fragment of the file resides.
<P>
<DT><CODE>i_frag</CODE>
<DD>number of the fragment in the block.
<P>
<DT><CODE>i_size</CODE>
<DD>size of the fragment.
<P>
<DT><CODE>i_pad1</CODE>
<DD>padding.
<P>
<DT><CODE>i_reserved2</CODE>
<DD>reserved.
</DL>
<P>
As you can see, the inode contains, <CODE>EXT2_N_BLOCKS</CODE> (15 in ext2fs
0.5) pointers to block. Of theses pointers, the first
<CODE>EXT2_NDIR_BLOCKS</CODE> (12) are direct pointers to data. The following entry
points to a block of pointers to data (indirect). The following entry
points to a block of pointers to blocks of pointers to data (double
indirection). The following entry points to a block of pointers to a
block of pointers to a block of pointers to data (triple indirection).
<P>
The inode flags may take one or more of the following or'ed values:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>EXT2_SECRM_FL 0x0001</CODE>
<DD>secure deletion. This usually means that when this flag is set and we
delete the file, random data is written in the blocks previously allocated
to the file.
<P>
<DT><CODE>EXT2_UNRM_FL 0x0002</CODE>
<DD>undelete. When this flag is set and the file is being deleted, the file
system code must store enough information to ensure the undeletion of
the file (to a certain extent).
<P>
<DT><CODE>EXT2_COMPR_FL 0x0004</CODE>
<DD>compress file. The content of the file is compressed, the file system
code must use compression/decompression algorithms when accessing the
data of this file.
<P>
<DT><CODE>EXT2_SYNC_FL 0x0008</CODE>
<DD>synchronous updates. The disk representation of this file must be kept
in sync with it's in core representation. Asynchronous I/O on this kind
of file is not possible. The synchronous updates only apply to the inode
itself and to the indirect blocks. Data blocks are always written
asynchronously on the disk.

Some inodes have a special meaning:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>EXT2_BAD_INO 1</CODE>
<DD>a file containing the list of bad blocks on the file system.
<P>
<DT><CODE>EXT2_ROOT_INO 2</CODE>
<DD>the root directory of the file system.
<P>
<DT><CODE>EXT2_ACL_IDX_INO 3</CODE>
<DD>ACL inode.
<P>
<DT><CODE>EXT2_ACL_DATA_INO 4</CODE>
<DD>ACL inode.
<P>
<DT><CODE>EXT2_BOOT_LOADER_INO 5</CODE>
<DD>the file containing the boot loader. (Not used yet it seems.)
<P>
<DT><CODE>EXT2_UNDEL_DIR_INO 6</CODE>
<DD>the undelete directory of the system.
<P>
<DT><CODE>EXT2_FIRST_INO 11</CODE>
<DD>this is the first inode that does not have a special meaning.
