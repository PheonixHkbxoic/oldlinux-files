<h1>Application Programs and the HPFS</h1>
</center>

Each of the OS/2 releases thus far have carried with them a major 
discontinuity for application programmers who teamed their trade in the 
MS-DOS environment. In OS/2 1.0, such programmers were faced for the first 
time with virtual memory, multitasking, inter-process communications, and 
the protected mode restrictions on addressing and direct control of the 
hardware and were challenged to master powerful new concepts such as 
threading and dynamic linking. In OS/2 Version 1.1, the stakes were raised 
even fufiher. Programmers were offered a powerful hardware-independent
graphical user interface but had to restructure their applications 
drastically for an event-driven environment based on objects and message 
passing. In OS/2 Version 1.2, it is time for many of the file- oriented 
programming habits and assumptions carried forward from the MS-DOS 
environment to fall by the wayside. An application that wishes to take 
full advantage of the HPFS must allow for long, free-form, mixed-case 
filenames and paths with few restrictions on punctuation and must be 
sensitive to the presence of EAs and ACLs. 
<p>
After all, if EAs are to be of any use, it won't suffice for applications 
to update a file by renaming the old file and creating a new one without 
also copying the EAs. But the necessary changes for OS/2 Version 1.2 are 
not tricky to make. A new API function, DosCopy, helps applications create 
backups--it essentially duplicates an existing file together with its EAs. 
EAs can also be manipulated explicitly with DosQFileInfo DosSetFileInfo 
DosQPathlnfo and DosSetPathInfo. A program should call DosQSysInfo at run 
time to find the maximum possible path length for the system and ensure 
that all buffers used by DosChDir DosQCurDir and related functions are 
sufficiently large. Similarly the buffers used by DosOpen DosMove 
DosGetModName, DosFindFirst D DosFindNext and like functions must allow for 
longer filenames. Any logic that folds cases in filenames or tests for the 
occurrence of only one dot delimiter in a filename must be rethought or 
eliminated. The other changes in the API will not affect the average 
application. The functions DosQFileInfo DosFindFirst and DosFindNext now 
retain all three sets of times and dates (created last accessed last 
motified) for a file on an HPFS volume but few programs are concerned with 
time and date stamps anyway. DosQFslnfo is used to obtain volume labels or 
disk characteristics just as before and the use of DosSetFsInfo for volume 
labels is unchanged. There are a few totally new API functions such as 
DosFsCtl (analogous to DosDevlOCtl but used for communication between an 
application and an FSD) DosFsAttach (a sort of explicit mount call) and
DosQFsAttach (determines which FSD owns a volume) these are intended mainly 
for use by disk utility program. In order to prevent old OS/2 applications 
and MS-DOS applications running in the DOS box from inadvertently damaging 
HPFS files a new flag bit has been defined in the EXE file header that 
indicates whether an application is HPFS-aware. If this bit is not set the 
application will only be able to search for open or create files on HPFS 
volumes that are compatible with the FAT' file system's 8.3 naming conventions. 
lf the bit is set OS/2 allows access to all files on an HPFS volume because 
it assumes that the program knows how to handle long free-form filenames and 
will take the responsibility of conserving a file's EAs and ACLs.
