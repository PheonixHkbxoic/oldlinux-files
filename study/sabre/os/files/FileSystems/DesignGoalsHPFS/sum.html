<h1>Summary</h1>
</center>

The HPFS solves all of the historical problems of the FAT file system. it 
achieves excellent throughput even in extreme casses--many very small files 
or a few very large files--by means of advanced data structures and techniques 
such as intelligent caching read-ahead and write-behind. Disk space is used 
economically because it is managed on a sector basis. Existing application 
programs will need modification to take advantage of the HPF'S's support for 
extended attributes and long filenames but these changes will not be difficult. 
All application programs will benefit from the HPFS's improved performance and 
decreased CPU use whether they are modified or not. This article is based on a 
prerelease version of the HPFS that was still undergoing modification and 
tuning. Therefore the final release of the HPFS may differ in some details 
from the description given here.

Most programmers are at at least passingly famiIiar with the data structure 
known as a binary tree. Binary trees are a technique for imposing a logical 
ordering on a collection of data items by means of pointers, without regard 
to the physical order of the data. In a simple binary tree, each node contains 
some data, including a key value that determines the node's logical position 
in the tree, as well as pointers to the node's left and right sub trees. The 
node that begins the tree is known as the root: the nodes that sit at the 
ends of the tree's branches are sometimes called the leaves. To find a 
particular piece of data, the binary tree is traversed from the root. At each 
node, the desired key is compared with the node's key: if they don't match, 
one branch of the node's sub tree or another is selected based on whether the 
desired key is less than or greater than the node's key. This process 
continues until a match is found or an empty sub tree is encountered 
(see <a href="#figa">Figure A</a>). 
Such simple binary trees, although easy to understand and implement, have 
disadvantages in practice. If keys are not well distributed or are added to 
the tree in a non-random fashion, the tree can become quite asymmetric, 
leading to wide variations in tree traversal times. In order to make access 
times uniform, many programmers prefer a particular type of balanced tree 
known as a B- Tree. For the purposes of this discussion, the important 
points about a B-Tree are that data is stored in all nodes, more than one 
data item might be stored in a node, and all of the branches of the tree 
are of identical length (see <a href="#figb">Figure B</a>). 
The worst-case behavior of a B-Tree is predictable and much better than that 
of a simple binary tree, but the maintenance of a B-Tree is correspondingly 
more complex. Adding a new data item, changing a key value, or deleting a 
data item may result in the splitting or merging of a node, which in turm 
forces a cascade of other operations on the tree to rebalance it. A B+ Tree 
is a specialized form of B-Tree that has two types of nodes: internal, which 
only point to other nodes, and external, which contain the actual data 
(see <a href="#figc">Figure C</a>). 
The advantage of a B+ Tree over a B- Tree is that the internal nodes of the
B+Tree can hold many more decision values than the intenmediate-level nodes 
of a B-Tree, so the fan out of the tree is faster and the average length of 
a branch is shorter. This makes up for the fact that yell must always follow 
a B+ Tree branch to its end to get the data for which you are looking, whereas 
in a B-Tree you may discover the data at an interme-diate code or even at the 
root.
