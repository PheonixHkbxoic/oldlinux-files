<h1>Installable File Systems</h1>

Support for installable file systems has been one of the most eagerly 
anticipated features of OS/2 Version 1.2. it will make it possible to 
access multiple incompatible volume structures--FAT, HPFS, CD ROM, and 
perhaps even UNIX on the same OS/2 system at the same time, will 
simplify the life of network implementors, and will open the door to 
rapid file system evolution and innovation. Installable file systems 
are, however, only relevant to the HPFS insofar as they make use of 
the HPFS optional. The FAT file system is still embedded in the OS/2 
kernel, as it was in OS/2 1.0 and 1.1, and will remain there as the 
compatibility file system for some time to come. An installable file 
system driver (FSD) is analogous in many ways to a device driver. An 
FSD resides on the disk in a file that is structured like a 
dynamic-link library (DLL), typically with a SYS or IFS extension, 
and is loaded during system initialization by <tt>IFS=</tt> statements 
in the <tt>CONFIG.SYS</tt> file.  <tt>IFS=</tt> directives are processed 
in the order they are encountered and are also sensitive to the order of
<tt>DEVlCE=</tt> statements for device drivers. This lets you load a 
device driver for a nonstandard device, load a file system driver from 
a volume on that device, and so on. Once an FSD is installed and 
initialized, the kernel communicates with it in terms of logical requests 
for file opens, reads, writes, seeks, closes, and so on. 
The FSD translates these requests--using control structures and tables 
found on the volume itself--into requests for sector reads and writes for 
which it can call special kernel entry points called File System Helpers 
(FsHlps). The kernel passes the demands for sector I/O to the appropriate 
device driver and returns the results to the FSD 
(<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>). 
The procedure used by the operating system to associate volumes with 
FSDs is called dynamic mounting and works as follows. Whenever a volume 
is first accessed, or after it has been locked for direct access and then 
unlocked (for example, by a FORMAT operation), OS/2 presents identifying 
information from the volume to each of the FSDs in turn until one of them 
recognizes the information. When an FSD claims the volume, the volume is 
mounted and all subsequent file I/O requests for the volume are routed to 
that FSD.

<b>FIGURE 6</b>: 
A simplified sketch of the relationship between an application program, the
OS/2 kernel, an installable file system, a disk drlver, and the physical 
disk device.  The applicatIon issues logical file requests to the OS/2 kernel 
by callng the entry points for DosOpen, DosRead, DosWrlte, DosChgFilePtr, and 
so on. The kernel passes these requests to the appropriate installable file 
system for the volume holding the file. The installable file system translates 
the logical file requests into requests for reads or writes of logical sectors 
and calls a kernel File System Helper (FsHlp) to pass these requests to the 
appropriate disk drlver. The disk driver transforms the logical sector requests 
into requests for specific physical units, cylinders heads, and sectors, and 
issues commands to the disk adapter to transfer data between the disk and 
memory.
