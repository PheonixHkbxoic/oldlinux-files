Design Goals and Implementation of the<br>
New High Performance File System

The High Performance File System (hereafter HPFS), which is making its first
appearance in the OS/2 operating system Version 1.2, had its genesis in the 
network division of Microsoft and was designed by Gordon Letwin, the chief 
architect of the OS/2 operating system. The HPFS has been designed to meet 
the demands of increasingly powerful PC's, fixed disks, and networks for many 
years to come and to serve as a suitable platform for object-oriented languages, 
applications, and user interfaces.
The HPFS is a complex topic because it incorporates three distinct yet 
interrelated file system issues. First, the HPFS is a way of organizing data 
on a random access block storage device. Second, it is a software module that 
translates file-oriented requests from an application program into more 
primitive requests that a device driver can understand, using a variety of 
creative techniques to maximize performance. Third, the HPFS is a practical 
illustration of an important new OS/2 feature known as Installable File Systems. 
This article introduces the three aspects of the HPFS. But first, it puts the 
HPFS in perspective by reviewing some of the problems that led to the system's 
existence.
