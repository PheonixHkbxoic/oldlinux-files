<H2>Part 3: Fragmentation, Diskspace Bitmaps and Code Pages</H2>
Written by Dan Bridges

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
This article originally appeared in the May 1996 issue of Significant
Bits, the monthly magazine of the Brisbug PC User Group Inc.

<P>
This month we look at how HPFS knows which sectors are occupied and which ones
are free.  We examine the amount of file fragmentation on five HPFS volumes and
also check out the fragmentation of free space.  A program will be presented to
show free runs and some other details.  Finally, we'll briefly discuss Code
Pages and look at a program to display their contents.

<P>
<H2>How Sectors are Mapped on a HPFS Volume</H2>

<P>
The sector usage on a HPFS partition is mapped in data band bitmap blocks.
These blocks are 2 KB in size (four sectors) and are usually situated at either
the beginning or end of a data band.  A data band is almost 8 MB.  (Actually
8,190 KB since 2 KB is needed for its bitmap.)  See Figure 1. The state of each
bit in the block indicates whether or not a sector (HPFS' allocation unit) is
occupied.  If a bit is set (1) then its corresponding sector is free.  If the
bit is not set (0) than the sector is occupied.  Structures situated within the
confines of a data band such as Code Page Info &amp; Data sectors, Hotfix
sectors,
the Root Directory DirBlk etc.  are all marked as fully occupied within that
band's usage bitmap.

<P>
Since each bit maps a sector, a byte maps eight sectors and the complete 2 KB
block maps the 16,384 sectors (including the bitmap block itself) in a 8 MB
band.  And since two blocks can face each other, we arrive at the maximum
possible extent (fragment) size of 16,380 KB.  Examine Figure 2 now to see
examples of file and freespace mapping.

<P>
In this example we see 23 occupied sectors ("u") and 4 unoccupied areas (".")
which we will refer to as "freeruns" [of sectors].  At one extreme, the 23
sectors might belong to one file (here in four extents) while at the other
extreme we might have the FNODEs of 23 "zero-length" files.  (Every file and
directory entry on a HPFS volume must have an FNODE sector.)

<P>
The advantages of the bitmap approach are twofold.  First, the small allocation
unit size on a HPFS volume means greatly reduced allocation unit wastage
compared to large FAT partitions.  Second, the compact mapping structure makes
it feasible for HPFS to quickly search a data band for enough free space to slot
in a file of known size, in one piece if possible.  For example, as just
mentioned HPFS can map 32,760 allocation units with just 4 KB of bitmaps whereas
a 16-bit FAT structure requires 64 KB (per FAT copy) to map 32,768 allocation
units.

<P>
<H2>A Fragmentation Analysis</H2>

<P>
In this section we'll examine the level of fragmentation on the five HPFS
partitions of my first HD.  Look at Figure 3. Notes:

<P>
1. A time-since-last-defrag figure of "Never" means that I've never run a
defragger across this partition since upgrading to OS/2 Warp 118 days ago.  This
value is stored in the SuperBlock (LSN 16) and was determined by using the
ShowSuperSpare REXX program featured in Part 2.

<P>
2. The fragmentation levels were reported by the wondrous FST (freeware) with
"FST -n check -f C:"  while the names of the fragmented files and their sizes
came from the GammaTech Utilities (commercial) "HPFSOPT C:  -u -d -o1 -l
logfile".  You can also use the Graham Utilities (commercial) "HPFS-EXT C:  -s".

<P>
3. The high number of files with 0 data extents on C:  is due to the presence of
the WPS folders on this drive.  Each of these has "zero" bytes in the main file
but they usually have bytes in EAs.

<P>
4. Files with 0 or 1 extents are considered to fully contiguous, so I've placed
them in one grouping.

<P>
5. Files with 2-8 extents are considered to be "nearly" contiguous" since the
fragments will usually be placed close together on the disk and also because a
list of the location and length of up to 8 extents can be kept in a file's FNODE
sector.  This list will be kept memory resident while the file is open.  Note 1:
the extents themselves can not be kept memory resident since, theoretically,
they could be up to 8*16,380 KB in size.  But no non-data disk reads, after the
initial read of the FNODE, would be required to work with the file.  Note 2:
under some circumstances, the 8 extents, if small enough, could be kept memory
resident in the sense that they could be held in HPFS' cache.  We will consider
FNODEs in detail in a later installment.

<P>
6. Files with more than 8 extents have too many fragments to be listed in their
FNODEs.  Instead an B+tree allocation sector structure (an ALSEC) is used to map
the extents.  The sector mappings are small enough to keep memory resident while
the file is open.  ALSECs will be covered in a latter installment.

<P>
7. EAs are usually not fragmented since, in the current implementation of OS/2,
the total EA size associated with any one file is only 64 KB.  If a file has EAs
in 0 extents then the EA information is stored completely within the FNODE
sector.  (There is space in the FNODE for up to 145 bytes of "internal" EAs.)
In all other cases on my system they currently stored in single, external runs
of sectors.  EAs will be covered in later installments.

<P>
We now turn to the topic of what circumstances are leading to file fragmentation
on these partitions.

<P>
C:  _ The OS/2 system partition.  I've run out of space on this drive on
occasions.  Activity here occurs though the running of Fixpacks (FP 16 and then
FP 17 were run), INI maintenance utilities and driver upgrades.  There is really
nothing of concern here.  Most HPFS defraggers suggest not trying to defrag
files that have less than 2 or 3 extents since you run the risk of fragmenting
the free space.  We will return to this topic shortly.

<P>
D:  _ My main work area and the location of communications files.  I use the DOS
comms package TELEMATE because I've always liked its features (although OS/2 has
to work hard to handle its modem access during a file transfer - OS/2 comms
programs, in general, are much less demanding of the CPU's attention).  The
other major comms package I use is OS/2 BinkleyTerm v2.60 feeding OS/2 Squish
message databases.  The fragmented files consist mainly of files downloaded by
TELEMATE (DOS comms programs do not inform HPFS, ahead of time, of how much
space the downloaded file will occupy) and Squish databases (*.SQD).  The drive
was defragged 53 days ago at which time no special effort was made to reduce
file fragmentation below 2-3 extents, accounting for the presence of 245 files
with two extents.  This really is an insignificant amount regardless of what the
4% figure may lead you to believe.

<P>
The most fragmented file on this partition is a 150 KB BinkleyTerm logfile with
30 extents.  The main reason I can see for fragmentation in this case is that
the file is frequently being updated with information while file transfers are
in progress.  The Squish databases are also prone to fragmentation.  Out of a
total of 25 database files there were 8, averaging 500 KB each, with a average
of 15 extents.

<P>
E:  _ The fragmentation here was insignificant apart from a single 2.8 MB
executable Windows program that has had a DOS patch program run over it,
resulting in 38 fragments.  The 2-extent files were mainly data files that are
produced by this same Windows package (being run under WIN-OS2).

<P>
F:  _ Almost no fragmentation since this partition is reserved for DOS programs
and I don't use them much.

<P>
G:  _ My second major work partition.  Fragmentation is low and unlikely to go
much lower since 2 extents is considered below the point of defragger
involvement.

<P>
The conclusions to be drawn from the above is that, if you don't get too hot
under the collar about some files having 2 or 3 extents then there will
generally be little need to worry about fragmentation under HPFS.  Only certain
types of files (some comms/DOS/Windows) will be candidates.  And keeping
partitions less than 80% full should help reduce general fragmentation as well.

<P>
<H2>Defragmenting Files</H2>

<P>
Since fragmentation is a relatively minor concern under HPFS there is not much
of an argument for purchasing OS/2 utilities based mainly on their ability to
defragment HPFS drives, especially since it's not hard to defragment files
yourself.  You see, providing there is enough contiguous freespace on a volume,
the mere act of copying the files to a temporary directory, deleting the
original and then moving the files back will usually eliminate, or at least
reduce fragmentation since HPFS, knowing the original filesize, will look for a
suitably sized freespace.  The success of this technique is demonstrated in
Figure 4 where 25 Squish database files (*.SQD) totalling 5.7 MB where shuffled
about on D:.  Note:  don't use the MOVE command to initially transfer the files
to the temp directory since this will just alter the directory entry rather than
actually rewriting the files.

<P>
I've used the GU's HPFS-EXT to report these figures.  This is freely available
in the GULITE demo package.  Note:  the fully functional HPFSDFRG is also in
this package but I wanted to show that it's not that hard to do this by hand.
HPFSDFRG does much the same as I did except that you can specify the
optimisation threshold (minimum number of extents before a file becomes a
candidate) and it will retry the copying operation up to ten times if there are
more extents after the operation than before it (due to heavily fragmented
freespace).

<P>
<H2>The Fragmentation of Freespace</H2>

<P>
Another significant aspect of HPFS' fragmentation resistance is how well the FS
keeps disk freespace in big, contiguous chunks.  If the current files on a
partition are relatively fragmentation free but the remaining freespace is
arranged in lots of small chunks then there is a good change that new files will
be fragmented.  You can check this with "FST -n info -f C:".  This produces a
table that counts the number of freespace extents that are 1, 2-3, 4-7, 8-15,
...  16384-32767 sectors long.  In my opinion though it is more important to
consider the product of the actual extent size by their frequency since the
presence of numerous 1-extent spaces are not important if there are still a
number of large spaces available.

<P>
Figure 5 shows the output of the REXX program ShowFreeruns.cmd.  The partition
of 100 MB is almost empty.  The display shows the location of the 2 KB block
that holds the list of the starting LSNs of each bitmap block (this figure comes
from the dword at offset 18h in the SuperBlock), the location of each bitmap
block on the left and the sector size and location of freespace on the right.
As you see, this partition has 13 data bands, 6 of which face each other.  A
version of ShowFreeruns.cmd that only outputs the run size was used to generate
a list of figures.  This list was loaded into a spreadsheet, sorted and a
frequency distribution performed.  See Figure 6. You can see that C:  has no
large areas remaining, D:  has the majority of its freespace in the 4 MB &lt; 8 MB
range and that E:, F:  and G:  have kept large majorities of their freespace in
very big runs.  Overall, this is quite good performance.

<H2>The ShowFreeruns Program</H2>

<P>
Like other programs in this series, ShowFreeruns.cmd (see Figure 7) uses
SECTOR.DLL to read a sector off a logical drive.  I was motivated to design this
program after seeing the output of the GU's "HPFSINFO C:  -F".  On a one-third
full 1.2 GB partition, the program presented here takes 17 secs compared to
HPFSINFO's time of 26 secs.  HPFSINFO also shows the CHS (Cyl/Hd/Sec)
coordinates of each run.  I was not interested in these but instead display the
freerun's size.  HPFSINFO also displays the meaning of what's in the SuperBlock
and the SpareBlock.  If you want to do this, you can include the code from
ShowSuperSpare.cmd from Part 2 and it will only add an extra 0.5 secs to the
time.  The performance then, for a interpreted program (REXX), is quite good and
was achieved primarily through a speed-up technique to be discussed shortly.
Moreover, HPFSINFO consistently overstates the end of each freerun by 1 and it
sometimes does not show the last run (e.g.  on C:  it states that there are 366
freeruns but only shows 365 of them).  This last bug appears to be caused by the
last freerun continuing to the end of the partition.  My design accounts for
this situation.

<P>
Since a sector is mapped by a bit, the program often needs to check the status
of a bit within a bitmap's byte.  This is done using the BITAND(string1,
string2) inbuilt function.  In this design string 1 holds the byte to be
examined and string 2 holds a character that only has the corresponding bit set.
Rather than having to work out the character for string 2 each time BITAND() is
used, we instead precalculate the eight characters and then store them in the
BitValue.  compound variable for later use.

<P>
The next step is to read in the SuperBlock and from it get the location of the
list of bitmap sectors and the total number of sectors.  The later value is
required so we know when we've reached the end of the partition.

<P>
We then read in the four sectors of the block holding the list of bitmaps.  The
list consists of dwords that store the starting LSN of each bitmap block.  128
dwords can fit in each sector of the list so the four sectors of the list can
hold 512 bitmap block LSNs.  Now a bitmap block maps 8 MB of diskspace so this
'lite' version is only good when dealing with a partition of less than 4 GB.
(Earlier works refer to the maximum partition size as 512 GB but in the recent
"Just Add OS/2 Warp" package, in its technical section, it is stated that the
maximum partition size is 64 GB.)  I won't be able to check this aspect of the
design until I get a HD bigger than 4 GB and succumb to the mad urge to
partition it as one volume.

<P>
The end of the list is indicated by the first occurrence of 0000h.  The list of
the 100 MB partition shown in Figure 5 contains only 13 dwords since it has 13
data bands so, in a typical case, you should not expect to find much data stored
in this block.

<P>
A freerun can be bigger than a data band since pairs of bands face each other,
so we consider two bands at a time, unless we reach the end of the partition
without a facing band.  Once we have a data region we call the DetermineFreeruns
procedure.  Here we examine the two, combined data bitmaps (unless it's a solo
band at the end).  In the initial design I looked at each byte in the 4 KB
bitmap combination to see it if it was either 00h (all eight sectors used) or
FFh (all eight sectors free).  Typically, you will find lots of occupied or free
sectors together, so checking eight at a time speeds up the search.  Only when
the byte was neither of these is a bit-level search required.

<P>
However, the speed of this version was poor, with the search though each byte of
the 322 KB of bitmaps for the 161 databands in the 1.2 GB partition taking a
total of 104 secs.  The obvious solution was to extend the optimisation method
to a second, higher level by checking more bytes first to see if they were all
set or clear.  I settled on 16 bytes which covers 128 sectors (64 KB) of
diskspace at a time and this resulted in the final time of 17 secs.  Further
experiments with larger (64 byte) groups and also with third-level optimisation
did not show much improvement with my mix of partitions but your situation may
warrant further experimentation.

<P>
<H2>Code Pages</H2>

<P>
Different languages have different character sets.  Code Pages (CPs) are used to
map an ASCII character to the actual character.  CP tables reside in
COUNTRY.SYS.  They are also present on a HPFS volume and every directory entry
(DIRENT) includes a CP index value.

<P>
CPs are used to map character case (i.e.  in a foreign character set the
relationship between lower and upper-case characters) and for collating
sequences used when sorting.  As mentioned in Part 1, HPFS directories use a
B-tree structure which, as part of its operation, always store file/directory
names in sorted order.  Remember that HPFS is not case-sensitive (including when
sorting) but it preserves case.

<P>
The European-style language (including English) have relatively straightforward
Single-Byte Character Sets (SBCS) i.e.  one character is represented by one
byte.  Asian character sets typically have many characters so they require two
bytes per character (DBCS).

<P>
The first 128 characters in all ASCII CPs are the same so the CP tables on the
disk only map ASCII 128-255.

<P>
The SpareBlock holds the LSN of the first CP Info sector.  There is a header
followed by up to 31 16-byte CP Info Entries.  There is provision for more than
one CP Info sector which could hold CP Info Entries 31-61 (counting from 0).
Why so many different CPs are catered for I have no idea since I've been unable
to have more than two loaded at a time.  In Australia we typically use CP437
(standard PC) - Country 061 and CP850 (multilingual Latin-1) - Country 000.  The
layout of a CP Info sector is shown in Figure 8.

The CP Info Entry contains the LSN where this entry's CP mapping table is
stored.  This sector is a CP Data Sector.  As well as a header there is enough
space for up to three 128-byte CP maps per sector.  Figure 9 shows the layout of
a CP Data Sector.

<H2>The CP.cmd Program</H2>

<P>
Figure 10 shows the display produced by the REXX CP.cmd program (Figure 11).
I've stopped it before it reached ASCII 255.  Normally, the output will scroll
off the screen, so either pause it or send it to the printer.  If the mapped
character has the same value as its ASCII value the word "same" is displayed
instead to reduce clutter.

<P>
While REXX does not support arrays it does have compound variables and I've used
a CV called "array" to store the contents of each CP's mapping table.  The
design only deals with the first 31 CP Info entries (that should be more than
enough anyway) and accommodates additional CPs by adding new columns to the
display.

<P>
Armed with this printout you can experiment with different collating sequences
when switching CPs.  You can check out your current CP by typing "CHCP" and then
switch to a different CP by issuing, say, "CHCP 850".  I used "REM &gt;
File[Alt-nnn]" to create zero-length files, with one or more high-order ASCII
characters in their filenames, as test fodder.

<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<P>
In this installment you've learned how to decode the data band usage bitmaps
contents and how to display the contents of the Code Page mapping tables.  Next
time we'll examine B-trees, DIRBLKs and DIRENTs.
