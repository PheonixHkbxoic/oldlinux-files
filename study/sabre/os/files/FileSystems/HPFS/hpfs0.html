Written by Dan Bridges

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
I am not a programmer's backside but I am an enthusiast interested in
finding out more about HPFS.  There is so little detailed information
available on HPFS that I think you will find this modest series
instructive.  The REXX programs to be presented are functional but they
are not particularly pleasing in an aesthetic sense.  However they do
ferret out information and will help you to understand what is going on.
I'm sure that a programming guru, once motivated, could come up with
superior versions.  Hopefully they will.  This installment originally
appeared at the OS2Zone web site (http://www.os2zone.aus.net).

<P>
I've been asked [by someone else.  Ed.] to write a preface to this series.
Normally I prefer to write on little-covered topics whereas much of what I'm
going to discuss in this installment often appears in a cursory examination of
the HPFS.  The trouble with most of what has been written about HPFS in books on
OS/2 is that the topic is never considered very deeply.  After finishing working
your way through this series (still being written on a monthly basis, but
expected to occupy eight parts including this one) you will have a detailed
knowledge of the structures of the HPFS.  Having said that, there is a place for
some initial information for readers who currently know very little about the
subject.

<P>
<H2>File Systems</H2>

<P>
A File System (FS) is a combination of hardware and software that
enables the storage and retrieval of information on removable (floppy
disk, tape, CD) and non-removable (HD) media.  The File Allocation Table
FS (FAT) is used by DOS.  It is also built into OS/2.  Now FAT appeared
back in the days of DOS v1 in 1981 and was designed with a backward
glance to CP/M.  A hierarchical directory structure arrived with DOS v2
to support the XT's 10 MB HD.  OS/2 v1.x used straight FAT.  OS/2 v2.x
and later provide "Super FAT".  This uses the same layout of
information on the storage medium (e.g.  a floppy written under OS/2 v2
can easily be read by a DOS system) but adds performance improvements to
the software used to transfer the data.  Super FAT will be covered in
Part 1.

<P>
<H2>FAT</H2>

<P>
Figure 1 shows the layout of a FAT volume.  There are two copies of the
FAT.  These should be identical.  This may seem like a safety feature
but it only works in the case of physical corruption (if a bad sector
develops in one of the sectors in a FAT, the other one is automatically
used instead) not for logical corruption.  So if the FS gets confused
and the two copies are not the same there is no easy way to determine
which copy is still O K.

practice.

<P>
The root directory is made a fixed known size because the system files
are placed immediately after it.  The known location for the initial
system files enables DOS or OS/2 to commence loading itself.  (The boot
record, which loads first off, is small and only has enough space for
code to find the initial system files at a known location.)  However
this design decision also limits the number of files that can be listed
in the root directory of a FAT volume.

<P>
Entries in the root directory and in subdirectories are not ordered so
searching for a particular file can take some time, particularly if
there are many files in a directory.

<P>
The FAT and the root directory are positioned at the beginning of the
volume (on a disk this is typically on the outside).  These entries are
read often, particularly in a multitasking environment, requiring a lot
of relatively slow (in CPU terms) head movement.

<P>
<H2>How Files are Stored on a FAT Volume</H2>

<P>
Files are stored on a FAT volume using the FS' minimum allocation unit,
the cluster (1-64 sectors).  A 32-byte directory entry only provides
sufficient space for a 8.3 filename, file attributes, last alteration
date/time, filesize and the starting cluster.  See Figure 2.

system.

<P>
The corresponding initial cluster entry in the FAT then points to the
next FAT entry for the second cluster of the file (assuming that the
file was big enough) which in turn points to the next cluster and so on.
FAT entries can be 16-bit (max.  FFFFh) or 12-bit (max.  FFFh) in size,
with volumes less than 16 MB using the 12-bit scheme.  FAT entries can
be of four types:

<UL>
<LI>Contain 0000h if the cluster is free (available);
<LI>Contain the number of the next cluster in the chain;
<LI>If this is the last cluster in the chain then the FAT entry will
    consist of a character which signifies the end of the chain (EOF);
<LI>Another special character if the cluster of the disk is bad
    (unreliable).
</UL>

<P>
The FAT FS is prone to fragmentation (i.e.  a file's clusters are not in
one, contiguous chain) in a single-tasking environment because the FAT
is searched sequentially for the next free entry in the FAT when a file
is written, regardless of how much needs to be written.  The situation
is even worse in a multitasking environment because you can have more
than one writing operation in progress at the same time.  See Figures 3
and 4 for an example of a fragmented file under FAT.

<P>
The FAT FS uses a singly-linked scheme i.e.  the FAT entry points only
to the next cluster.  If, for some reason, the chain is accidentally
broken (the next cluster value is corrupted) then there is no
information in the isolated next cluster to indicate what it was
previously connected to.  So the FAT FS, while relatively simple, is
also rather vulnerable.

<P>
FAT was designed in the days of small disk size and today it really
shows its age.  The maximum number of entries (clusters) in a 16-bit FAT
is just under 64K (due to technical reasons, the actual maximum is
65,518).  Since we can't increase the number of clusters past this
limit, a large volume requires the use of large cluster sizes.  So, for
example, a volume in the 1-2 GB range has 32 KB clusters.  Now a cluster
is the minimum allocation unit so a 1 byte file on such a volume would
consume 32 KB of space, a 33 KB file would consume 64 KB and so on.  A
rough assumption you can make is that, on average, half a cluster of
space is wasted per file.  You can run CHKDSK on a FAT volume, note the
total number of files and also the allocation unit size and then
multiply these two figures together and divide the result by 2 to get
some idea of the wastage.  The situation is quite different with HPFS as
you will see when you read Part 1.

<P>
Finally, FAT under OS/2 supports Extended Attributes (EAs - up to 64 KB
of extra information associated with a file), but since there is very
little extra space in a 32-byte directory entry it is only possible to
store a pointer into an external file with all EAs on a volume being
stored in this file ("EA DATA.  SF").  In general it is fair to state
that EAs are tacked on to FAT.  With HPFS the integration is much
better.  If the EA is small enough HPFS stores it completely within the
file's FNODE (every file and directory has an FNODE).  Otherwise EAs is
stored outside the file but closely associated with it and usually
situated physically close to the file for performance reasons.  Some
users have occasionally reported crosslinking of EAs under FAT.  This
can be quite a serious matter requiring reinstallation of the operating
system.  I've not heard of this occurring under HPFS.  Note that the
WorkPlace Shell relies heavily on EAs.

<H2>HPFS</H2>

<P>
HPFS is example of a class of file systems known as Installable File
Systems (IFS).  Other types of IFS include CD support (CDFS), Network
File System (NFS), Toronto Virtual File System (TVFS - combines FS
elements of VM, namely CMS search path, with elements of UNIX, namely
symbolic link), EXT2-OS (read Linux EXT2FS partitions under OS/2) and
HPFS386 (with IBM LAN Server Advanced).

<P>
An IFS is installed at start-up time.  The software to access the actual
device is specified as a device driver (usually BASEDEV=xxxxx.DMD/.ADD)
while a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) is load to control the format/layout
of the data (with IFS=xxxxx.IFS).  OS/2 can run more than one IFS at a
time so you could, for example, copy from a CD to a HPFS volume in one
session while reading a floppy disk (FAT) in another session.

<P>
HPFS has many advantages over FAT:  Long Filename (254 characters
including spaces); excellent performance when directories containing
many files; designed to be fault tolerant; fragmentation resistant;
space efficient with large partitions; works well in a multitasking
environment.  These topics will be explored in the series.

<P>
<H2>REXX</H2>

<P>
One of the many benefits of using OS/2 is that it comes with REXX
(providing you install it - it requires very little extra space).  REXX
is a surprisingly versatile and powerful scripting language and there
are oodles of REXX programs and add-ons available, much of it for free.
This series presents REXX programs that access HPFS structures and
decode their contents.

<P>
<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<P>
In this installment you have seen that the FAT FS has a number of
problems related to its ancient origins.  HPFS comes from a fresh design
with one eye on likely advances in storage that would occur in the
foreseeable future and the other eye on obtaining good performance.  In
the next installment we look at the many techniques HPFS uses to achieve
its better performance.
