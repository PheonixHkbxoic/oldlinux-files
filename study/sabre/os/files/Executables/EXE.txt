The relocation table is a set of far pointers (eg: 1234:5678h) and it appears
you just add the relocation factor to the value at that address. The relocation
factor is the start segment of where the program is loaded.

Example:
------------------------------------------------
code segment
start:
        mov     ax,seg _myseg
code ends

_myseg segment
_myseg ends
end start
-------------------------------------------------

 Start  Stop   Length Name               Class

 00000H 00002H 00003H CODE
 00010H 00010H 00000H _MYSEG

-------------------------------------------------

Note that _MYSEG is exactly one segment above CODE.

Generated output is B8 01 00; which is "mov ax,0001"

The fixup table for this file has a single entry, 0000:0001. Thus if the start
of the program begins at segment 3562 then the "mov ax,0001" gets converted to
"mov ax,3563".
