A DPMI client that provides resident protected mode services (also
called a "protected mode TSR") must install itself using <a
href="api/310c00.html">Int 31H Functions 0C00H</a> and <a
href="api/310c01.html">0C01H</a>.  The protected mode TSR first
declares its intent to remain resident by calling <a
href="api/310c00.html">Function 0C00H</a>, providing the DPMI host
with the code and data descriptors and callback entry points for
16-bit and/or 32-bit protected mode.  If the TSR does not wish to
provide services in a particular mode, it provides a code descriptor
for that mode containing all zero bytes.  The protected mode TSR then
terminates and stays resident by calling <a href="api/310c01.html">Int
31H Function 0C01H</a>.  Note that after this function call, the TSR's
original addressing context is destroyed; its LDT and IDT no longer
exist, although any extended memory blocks it owned at the time of
termination remain allocated. <p>

Whenever another DPMI client <i>in the same virtual machine</i> loads
or terminates, the DPMI host will inspect its list of protected mode
TSRs.  If a particular TSR has indicated that it can execute in the
active client's mode, the DPMI host will automatically allocate two
LDT descriptors in the active client's context, initialize them to the
values specified in the protected mode TSR's original <a
href="api/310c00.html">Function 0C00H</a> call, and enter the TSR via
a <tt>FAR CALL</tt> at the offset appropriate to the current mode,
passing the following values:<p>

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4>

<tr><td>CS</td><td align=left>executable selector which maps the same
memory as the code descriptor in the <a href="api/310c00.html">Int 31H
Function 0C00H</a> data structure for the current mode (16-bit or
32-bit)</td></tr>

<tr><td>(E)IP</td><td align=left>Offset specified in the <a
href="api/310c00.html">Int 31H Function 0C00H</a> data structure for
the current mode (16-bit or 32-bit)</td></tr>

<tr><td>DS</td><td align=left>read/write data selector which maps the
same memory as the data descriptor specified in the <a
href="api/310c00.html">Int 31H Function 0C00H</a> data structure for
the current mode (16-bit or 32-bit)</td></tr>

<tr><td>ES</td><td align=left>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>FS</td><td align=left>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>GS</td><td align=left>0</td></tr>

<tr><td>AX</td><td align=left>Reason for callback: 0=DPMI client
loading, 1=DPMI client terminating</td></tr>

<tr><td>BX</td><td align=left>unique handle for the client within the
virtual machine</td></tr>

</table><p>

When a new DPMI client is loaded and executes the initial switch to
protected mode, the appropriate callback procedure in the protected
mode TSR will be entered by a <tt>FAR CALL</tt> with AX=0
<i>before</i> the DPMI host returns to the new program.  The TSR may
then hook interrupts, create descriptors, or allocate memory blocks in
the new client's context prior to the client's access to such
protected mode resources.  For example, the initialization callback
gives the TSR an opportunity to insert itself in the chain of handlers
for any arbitrary interrupt or exception.  The TSRs are invoked in the
order of their installation but are removed in the reverse order.  The
TSR may also need to construct per-client data structures in its own
memory, and can use the value supplied to it in BX as a "handle" for
the client.  The TSR must exit from the initialization callback with a
<tt>RETF</tt>.

Similarly, when a DPMI client terminates using Int 21H Function 4CH or
<a href="api/310c01.html">Int 31H Function 0C01H</a>, the TSR's
callback procedure will be entered by a <tt>FAR CALL</tt> with AX=1
<i>before</i> the active client's LDT or IDT has been destroyed.  The
protected mode TSR can then perform any client termination
responsibilities of which the client is unaware (e.g. unmapping of
physical memory), release any protected mode resources which it has
acquired on behalf of the client (e.g. ownership of shared memory),
and deallocate any per-client data structures of its own.  The
termination callback must exit with a <tt>RETF</tt> and indicate an
action to the DPMI host as follows:

<ul>
Carry = clear to keep resident services in memory, or<br>
Carry = set to remove resident services from memory.
</ul>

A resident service provider should only be removed from memory of the
last client of the virtual machine they are servicing.<p>

<a href="api/310c00.html">Int 31H Functions 0C00H</a> and <a
href="api/310c01.html">0C01H</a> should only be used by DPMI clients
which intend to provide resident services to other protected mode
clients.  If the objective is only to provide resident services to
real mode programs, the client should use the DPMI translation service
<a href="api/310300.html">Int 31H Function 0300H</a> to invoke DOS's
Int 31H Function 31H directly. <p>
