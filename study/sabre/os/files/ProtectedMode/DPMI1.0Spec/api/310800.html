<h2>Physical Address Mapping
<img src="../0.9.gif" alt="[0.9]" width=22 height=17></h2>

Converts a physical address into a linear address.  This function
allows device drivers running under DPMI hosts which use paging to
reach physical memory that is associated with their devices above the
1 MB boundary Examples of such devices are the Weitek numeric
coprocessor (usually mapped at 3 GB), buffers that hold scanner bit
maps, and high-end displays that can be configured to make display
memory appear in extended memory.<p>

<h2>Notes</h2><ul>


<li>It is the caller's responsibility to allocate and initialize a
descriptor for access to the memory.<p>

<li>This function should only be used by clients that absolutely
require direct access to a memory mapped device at physical addresses
above 1 MB.  Clients should not use this function to access memory
below the 1 MB boundary (the real mode addressable region).  See also
<a href="310200.html">Int 31H Functions 0002H</a>, <a
href="310508.html">0508H</a>, and <a href="310509.html">0509H</a>.<p>

<li>When this function is called, the DPMI host either creates page
table entries that directly map the physical addresses requested and
returns the linear address of the created page table entries, or else
just returns the linear address of the memory region that is already
used to map the requested device.  For example, if the client attempts
to map a Weitek coprocessor and the host already has a linear region
set up to map the Weitek chip and virtualize it, it would simply
return the linear address of the existing region.  If the host does
not virtualize the Weitek chip, it would create 16 page table entries
that map the 64 KB Weitek address space and return a linear address
corresponding to the new page table entries.<p>

<li>If the host is not virtualizing the device, it must disable any
memory caching on the mapped pages; in particular, on the 80486 the
host must set the PCD (page cache disable) bit in the page table
entries.<p>

<li>The host is permitted to fail any memory mapping call.  However,
the host should support this function whenever possible, to achieve
compatibility with application programs that use memory-mapped devices
of which the host is not aware.  Useful guidelines are that the host
should fail any attempt to map addresses below 1 MB, or addresses
which the host considers to be general-purpose RAM memory.  Attempts
to map any other physical address should succeed, since the host
should either (a) already know about the device and be able to return
a linear address used to access the device, or (b) assume the program
is attempting to map a legitimate device of which the host has no
knowledge.<p>

<li>Programs and device drivers which need to perform DMA I/O to
physical addresses in a virtualized hardware environment should use
the Virtual DMA Services (see the Glossary entry for the Virtual DMA
Services Specification).  Also see page 10 of the DPMI execution
environment section.<p>
