The programmable interrupt controllers are mapped by the DPMI host to
the system's default interrupt assignments.  On an IBM AT-compatible
system, for example, the master interrupt controller (IRQ0 through
IRQ7) is programmed to use a base interrupt level of 8 and the slave
controller (IRQ8 through IRQ15) uses a base interrupt level of 70H.<p>

All of the code and data that may be touched by hardware interrupt
handlers must reside in locked memory to avoid page faults at
interrupt time.  The handler will always be called on a locked stack.
As in real mode, hardware interrupt handlers are called with virtual
interrupts disabled and the trace flag reset.  In systems where the
CPU's interrupt flag is virtualized, <tt>IRET</tt> may not restore the
interrupt flag.  Therefore, clients should execute a <tt>STI</tt>
before executing <tt>IRET</tt> or else interrupts will remain
disabled. <p>

Protected mode hardware interrupt handlers that call a real mode
routine must either ensure that the real mode code will not modify
segment registers or user the DPMI state save/restore services (see
page 94).  However, any interrupt handler that executes completely in
protected mode, or uses the translation services (<a

href="api/310301.html">0301H</a>, or <a
href="api/310302.html">0302H</a>), does not need to save the real mode
register state. <p>

Personal computers with two programmable interrupt controllers usually
have a BIOS that redirects one of the interrupts from the slave
controller into the range of the master controller for compatibility
with older, 8086/88-based systems.  For example, devices jumpered for
IRQ2 on PC/AT-compatible computers actually interrupt on IRQ 9 (Int
71H), but the BIOS on these systems converts Int 71H to Int 0AH yet
sends the EOI command (appropriately) to the slave controller.  A
protected mode client that needs access to the redirected interrupt
might use a variation on one of the following techniques:

<ul>

<li> Install only a real mode handler for the target interrupt, taking
advantage of the built-in redirection.  This method is robust on
systems where other software has reprogrammed the interrupt
controllers, or where the slave interrupt controller may be
absent. <p>

<li> Install both real mode and protected mode handlers for the target
interrupt.  In such cases, the program must send the EOI command to
both the slave and master interrupt controllers since the BIOS is
never called.  This method is more efficient in that there are not any
unnecessary switches to real mode. <p>

</ul>
