DPMI clients are loaded in real mode.  In order to enter protected
mode, the client must first call <a href="api/2f1687.html">Int 2FH
Function 1687H</a> to test for the presence of a DPMI host and obtain
the address of the real-to-protected mode switch entry point.  <a
href="api/2f1687.html">Function 1687H</a> also returns information
about the DPMI host's capabilities and the size of a private data area
which will be used by the host to hold client-specific data
structures.  After allocating the required private data area via the
normal real mode memory allocation interface (DOS Int 21H Function
48H), the client makes a <tt>FAR CALL</tt> to the mode switch entry
point with the following parameters: <p>

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4>
<tr><td rowspan=5 align=center>AX</td><td colspan=2>flags</td></tr>
<tr><th align=center>Bit</th><th>Significance</th></tr>
<tr><td align=center rowspan=2>0</td><td align=left>0 = 16-bit application</td></tr>
<tr><td align=left>1 = 32-bit application</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center rowspan=1>1-15</td><td align=left>Reserved, should be zero</td></tr>

<tr><td align=center>ES</td><td colspan=2>real mode segment of DPMI
host private data area (must be at least as large as the size returned
in SI by <a href="api/2f1687.html">Int 2FH Function 1687H</a>; ES is
ignored if the size was zero.</td></tr>

</table><p>


If the Carry flag is set upon return, the mode switch was
unsuccessful, the client is still running in real mode, and register
AX contains one of the following error codes: <p>

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4>

<tr><td align=center>8011H</td><td align=left>descriptor unavailable
(cannot allocate descriptors for CS, DS, ES, SS, PSP, and environment
pointer)</td></tr>

<tr><td align=center>8021H</td><td align=left>invalid value (32-bit
program specified but not supported)</td></tr>

</table><p>

If the mode switch was successful, the mode switch routine returns to
the call in protected mode with the Carry flag clear and the following
results:<p>

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4>

<tr><td align=center>CS</td><td align=left>16-bit selector with base
of real mode CS and a 64KB limit</td></tr>

<tr><td align=center>SS</td><td align=left>selector with base of real
mode SS and a 64 KB limit</td></tr>

<tr><td align=center>DS</td><td align=left>selector with base of real
mode DS and a 64 KB limit</td></tr>

<tr><td align=center>ES</td><td align=left>selector to program's PSP
with a 100H byte limit</td></tr>

<tr><td align=center>FS</td><td align=left>0 (if running on an 80386
or later)</td></tr>

<tr><td align=center>GS</td><td align=left>0 (if running on an 80386
or later)</td></tr>

</table><p>

All other registers are preserved, except that for 32-bit clients the
high word of ESP will be forced to zero.  32-bit clients will
initially run with a 16-bit code segment, but all Int 31H calls will
still require 48-bit pointers, and the stack and data descriptors will
be 32-bit (the Big bit will be set in the descriptors).  Note that if
DS+SS at the time of the mode switch call, only one descriptor may be
allocated, and the same selector may be returned in DS and SS.  The
client is allowed to modify or free the CS, DS and SS descriptors
allocated by the mode switch routine. <p>

The environment pointer in the client program's PSP is automatically
converted to a selector during the mode switch.  If the client wishes
to free the memory occupied by the environment, it should do so <i>
before </i> entering protected mode and zero the word at PSP:2CH
(segment address of the environment>.  The client may change the
environment point in the PSP after entering protected mode but it must
restore it to the selector created by the DPMI host before
terminating.  The client should <i>not</I> modify or free the PSP or
environment descriptors supplied by the DPMI host.<p>

<b> Example:</b>  The following code illustrates how a DPMI client
would obtain the address of the mode switch entry point, allocate the
DPMI host private data area, and enter protected mode.

<pre>
modesw	dd	0			; far pointer to DPMI host's
					; mode switch entry point
	.
	.
	.
	mov	ax,1687h		; get address of DPMI host's
	<a href="api/2f1687.html">int	2fh</a>			; mode switch entry point
	or	ax,ax			; exit if no DPMI host
	jnz	error
	mov	word ptr modesw,di	; save far pointer to host's
	mov	word ptr modesw+2,es	; mode switch entry point
	or	si,si			; check private data area size
	jz	@@1			; jump if no private data area

	mov	bx,si			; allocate DPMI private area
	mov	ah,48h			; allocate memory
	int	21h			; transfer to DOS
	jc	error			; jump, allocation failed
	mov	es,ax			; let ES=segment of data area

@@1:	mov	ax,0			; bit 0=0 indicates 16-bit app
	call	modesw			; switch to protected mode
	jc	error			; jump if mode switch failed
					; else we're in prot. mode now
