When a DPMI client switches into protected mode, a unique interrupt
descriptor table (IDT) is created for the client by the DPMI host.
Initially, all software interrupts (except for Int 31H, Int 2FH and
Int 21H Function 4CH) or external hardware interrupts are directed to
a handler that simply reflects the interrupt to real mode; i.e. the
DPMI host's default handler simply switches the CPU into real mode and
re-issues the interrupt, so that it can be serviced by the original
real mod owner of the interrupt.  The contents of the general
registers and flags are passed to the real mode handler and the
modified registers and flags are returned to the protected mode
handler.  Segment registers and the stack pointer are not passed
between modes; the contents of the segment registers after the switch
to real mode are undefined, and the DPMI host automatically supplies a
valid real mode stack. <p>

DPMI clients can install their own distinct real mode or protected
mode handlers for software and external hardware interrupts with <a
href="api/310201.html">Functions 0201H</a> and <a
href="api/310205.html">0205H</a> respectively.  If a protected mode
handler is installed, it is called instead of any real mode handler or
the DPMI host's default handler.  Just as in real mode, the protected
mode handler can either service the interrupt and terminate with an
IRET, or transfer to the next handler in the chain by executing a
<tt>PUSHF/CALL</tt> or a <tt>FAR JMP</tt>.  The final handler in the
protected mode handler chain (the DPMI host's default handler) will
reflect the interrupt to real mode. <p>
