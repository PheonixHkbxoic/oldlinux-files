Under many DPMI hosts, interrupts will always remain enabled in
protected mode (i.e. the interrupt flag will be set at all times) to
allow preemptive multitasking.  Such hosts will maintain a virtual
interrupt state for each virtual machine, trapping the execution of
instructions that ordinarily affect the hardware interrupt flag and
adjusting the client's virtual interrupt flag accordingly. When the
virtual interrupt flag is cleared by the client's execution of
<tt>CLI</tt> or call to <a href="api/310900.html">DPMI function Int
31H 0900H</a>, the program will not receive any hardware interrupts
until it sets the flag again with <tt>STI</tt> or calls <a
href="api/310901.html">Function 0901H</a>.  DPMI clients should not
use the <tt>PUSHF</tt> instruction to examine their interrupt status.
This is because <tt>PUSHF</tt> pushes the real processor flags onto
the stack, which do not reflect the state of the client's virtual
interrupt flag.  Similarly, clients cannot use <tt>IRET(D)</tt> or
<tt>POPF</tt> to alter the interrupt flag, because these instructions
access the physical interrupt flag and are ignored by the CPU due to
the client's privilege level. <p>

<b>Example:</b> The following source code demonstrates how a client
would disable virtual interrupts prior to entry to an
interrupt-critical section of code, then restore the virtual interrupt
flag to its previous state at the end of the critical section:

<pre>

	mov	ax,0900h		; get previous virtual interrupt
	<a href="api/310900.html">int	31h</a>			; flag and disable interrupts
	push	ax			; save value 0900H or 0901H
	.
	.				; interrupt-critical code goes here
	.
	pop	ax
	<a href="api/310900.html">int	31h</a>			; restore previous interrupt flag
</pre>

If the client already knows (or does not care about) the previous
state of the virtual interrupt flag, it can use <tt>CLI</tt> and
<tt>STI</tt> instead of <a href="api/310900.html">DPMI functions
0900H</a> and <a href="api/310901.html">0901H</a>.  The programmer
should assume that the execution of either of these instructions will
be slow. <p>
