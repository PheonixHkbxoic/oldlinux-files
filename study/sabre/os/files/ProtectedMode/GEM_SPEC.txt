INT 2F - MS Windows - WINDOWS ENHANCED MODE & 286 DOSX INIT BROADCAST
	AX = 1605h
	ES:BX = 0000h:0000h
	DS:SI = 0000h:0000h
	CX = 0000h
	DX = flags
	    bit 0 = 0 if Windows enhanced-mode initialization
	    bit 0 = 1 if Microsoft 286 DOS extender initialization
	    bits 1-15 reserved (undefined)
	DI = version number (major in upper byte, minor in lower)
Return: CX = 0000h if okay for Windows to load
	CX = FFFFh (other registers unchanged) if Windows 3.0 in standard mode
	CX <> 0 if Windows should not load
	ES:BX -> startup info structure (see #1410)
	DS:SI -> virtual86 mode enable/disable callback or 0000h:0000h
	      (see #1413)
Notes:	the Windows enhanced mode loader and Microsoft 286 DOS extender will
	  broadcast an INT 2F/AX=1605h call when initializing.	Any DOS device
	  driver or TSR can watch for this broadcast and return the appropriate
	  values.  If the driver or TSR returns CX <> 0, it is also its
	  responsibility to display an error message.
	each handler must first chain to the prior INT 2F handler with
	  registers unchanged before processing the call
	if the handler requires local data on a per-VM basis, it must store the
	  returned ES:BX in the "next" field of a startup info structure and
	  return a pointer to that structure in ES:BX
	a single TSR may set the V86 mode enable/disable callback; if DS:SI is
	  already nonzero, the TSR must fail the initialization by setting CX
	  nonzero
	MSD checks for Windows 3.0 running in standard mode by testing whether
	  CX=FFFFh and other registers are unchanged on return
	Novell DOS v7.0 (Update 8 - Update 11) TASKMGR in multitasking mode
	  uses this broadcast, even if TASKMGR.INI sets WinPresent= to OFF
	Micrsoft's EMM386.EXE for DOS 5+ when installed with the NOEMS option
	  changes its driver name from EMMQXXX0 to EMMXXXX0 while Windows is
	  active

Format of Windows Startup Information Structure:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 1410)
 00h  2 BYTEs	major, minor version of info structure
 02h	DWORD	pointer to next startup info structure or 0000h:0000h
 06h	DWORD	pointer to ASCIZ name of virtual device file or 0000h:0000h
 0Ah	DWORD	virtual device reference data (see #1412)
		(only used if above nonzero)
 0Eh	DWORD	pointer to instance data records (see #1411) or 0000h:0000h

Format of one Instance Item in array:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 1411)
 00h	DWORD	address of instance data (end of array if 0000h:0000h)
 04h	WORD	size of instance data

Format of Virtual Device Reference Data:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 1412)
 00h	DWORD	physical address of ??? or 00000000h
 04h	DWORD	physical address of ??? table
 08h	DWORD	"DEST_PAGE" address to which pages must be mapped
 0Ch  N DWORDs	"SRC_PAGE" physical addresses of the pages
		00000000h = end of table
Note:	EMM386.EXE sets the first pointer to the start of the device driver
	  chain, the second pointer to a field of 40h bytes followed by a
	  16-bit offset to the end of the SRC_PAGE table, and DEST_PAGE to
	  the start segment of the UMB area

(Table 1413)
Values Windows virtual mode enable/disable procedure is called with:
	AX = 0000h disable V86 mode
	AX = 0001h enable V86 mode
	interrupts disabled
Return: CF set on error
	CF clear if successful
	interrupts disabled

INT 2F - MS Windows - WINDOWS ENHANCED MODE & 286 DOSX EXIT BROADCAST
	AX = 1606h
	DX = flags
	    bit 0 = 0 if Windows enhanced-mode exit
	    bit 0 = 1 if Microsoft 286 DOS extender exit
	    bits 1-15 reserved (undefined)
Notes:	if the init broadcast fails (AX=1605h returned CX <> 0), then this
	  broadcast will be issued immediately.
	this call will be issued in real mode
	Novell DOS v7.0 (Update 8 - Update 10) TASKMGR in multitasking mode
	  uses this broadcast, even if TASKMGR.INI sets WinPresent= to OFF
