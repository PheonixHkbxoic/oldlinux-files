<h3>
<a name="preface">Preface</a></h3>

This tutorial is intended as a supplement to the
<a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/sigops/roll_your_own">SigOps OS
Tutorial</a> to teach the fundamentals of symmetric multprocessing
using Intel MP compliant hardware.  Knowledge of the concepts and
implementations of basic operating system parts such as managing virtual
memory and multitasking are assumed and will not be discussed except as
they relate to multiprocessing.  Knowledge equivalent to an intermediate
or advanced computer architecture college course will be helpful in
understanding scheduling issues, but is not required.
<p>

This tutorial is not intended to be a complete explanation of how to
implement an SMP-capable operating system, nor as a replacement for
Intel's documentation.  Rather it is designed to
give an overview of the things I learned in writing SMP support for
<a href="http://www.frotz.net/openblt">OpenBLT</a>, a freely
redistributable microkernel-based operating system under the BSD
licence.  Particularly, some tedious hardware
aspects will not be discussed in detail when the reader could just as
easily read official Intel documentation.  The interested reader should
refer to the references for more detailed information.  For code examples,
the reader should refer to the source code of
<a href="http://www.frotz.net/openblt">OpenBLT</a> or
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>.  The Linux kernel source
code might be helpful, although it is under the GPL.
<p>

This tutorial is a work in progress.  If you see an error or something
that needs clarification, please <a href="mailto:cammeres@uiuc.edu">e-mail

<dl>
<dt>AP
    <dd>application processor.  A processor that is not the BSP.  All APs are
        in a halted state when the BIOS first gives control to the operating
        system.
<dt>APIC
    <dd>Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller.  Either a local APIC or
        an I/O APIC.  It is attached to the APIC bus.
<dt>APIC bus
    <dd>A special non-architechural bus on which the APICs in the system
        send messages.
<dt>BSP
    <dd>bootstrap processor.  The processor which is given control after the
        BIOS finishes its POST.
<dt>I/O APIC
    <dd>A special APIC for receiving and distributing interrupts from external
        devices which is backward compatible with the PIC.  There is generally
        only one per computer.
<dt>IPI
    <dd>interprocessor interrupt.  A special interrupt sent to a processor by
        the originating processor programming its APIC with a target or logical
        target ID, and an interrupt vector.
<dt>Local APIC
    <dd>an APIC built in to the processor.  It is responsible for dispatching
        interrupts sent over the APIC bus to its processor core and sending
        interrupts to other processors over the APIC bus.
<dt>MP
    <dd>Intel's MultiProcessor Specification, a standard which defines how
        SMP hardware should be presented to the operating system and how the
        operating system should interact with this hardware.
<dt>serialisation
    <dd>The act of executing a certain instruction which causes the processor
        to pause to
        retire all instructions currently being executed before proceeding
        to the next instruction in the stream.  For example, before switching
        to protected mode, the processor must retire all instructions that
        began executing in real mode before beginning any in protected mode.
<dt>SMP
    <dd>symmetric multiprocessing.  Using multiple processors which share
        the same physical memory in the same computer at the time.  You are
        probably reading this tutorial with the hope that your operating
        system will become SMP-capable.
<dt>UP
    <dd>uniprocessor.  Your operating system to date is a UP operating system.

<h3>
<a name="config">MP Detection and Configuration</a>
</h3>

When the system first starts, the BIOS detects the hardware installed in
the system using electric means and then creates structures to describe
this hardware to the operating system.  There are two such tables.
The first is the MP Floating Pointer Structure, which is required.
The second is the MP Configuration Table, which is optional.  If the
configuration table does not exist, the operating system should set up
the default configuration indicated in the floating pointer structure.
Some data in the tables is in ASCII.  Strings are padded with spaces
and are not null-terminated.
<p>

First, you need to find the floating pointer structure.  According to
the spec, it can be in one of four places:  (1) in the first kilobyte
of the extended BIOS data area, (2) the last kilobyte of base memory,
(3) the top of physical memory, or (4) the BIOS read-only memory space
between 0xe0000 and 0xfffff.  You need to search these areas for the
four-byte signature "_MP_" which denotes the start of the floating
pointer structure.  Absence of this structure indicates that the system
is not MP compliant.  At this point your operating system can either halt,
or it can fall back into a UP setup.
<p>

You should checksum the structure to make sure it has not been corrupted.
There is not much of interest in the floating pointer structure, unless
your system does not have a configuration table.  In this case, you will
need to get the number of the default configuration your system adheres to
and set up the system for SMP using those parameters.  Otherwise, you will
need to get the address of the configuration table and begin parsing that.
<p>

The configuration table is divided into three parts:  a header, a base
section, and an extended section.  The header begins with the four-byte
signature "PCMP", although you do not have to search for it.  Once you
find it, checksum it.  At this point, you can print the OEM and product
ID strings in the configuration table if you want.  You should get the
address of the local APIC from this and store it.  Then, proceed to
parse the base section.
<p>

The base section consists of a set of entries that describe either
processors, system busses, I/O APICs, I/O interrupt assignments, or
local interrupt assignments.  All entries are eight bytes in length,
save processor entries which are twenty bytes.  The first byte of each
entry denotes the type of the entry.  Look through each entry.  You will
probably want to generate quite a few OS-specific data structure here.
In particular, you will want to note the APIC ID of each processor in
the system, its version, and its type as well as the address of the
system's I/O APIC.
<p>

<h3>
<a name="apic">Using Local APICs</a>
</h3>

MP systems have a special bus to which all APICs in the system are
connected.  This bus is one of the ways the processors can communicate
with one another (the other, of course, is shared memory).  APICs (both
local and I/O) are memory mapped devices.  The default location for
the local APIC is at 0xfee00000 in physical memory.  The local APIC
will appear in the same place for each processor, but each processor
will reference its own APIC; the APIC intercepts memory references to
its registers, and those references will not generate bus cycles on
some systems.  Since APICs are mapped in high memory, the APs will have
to switch to protected mode before they can intialise their local APICs.
If you like, you can map the APIC to a different address using the paging
unit, but be sure to disable caching in the page table entry since some
registers can change between accesses.  For this reason, pointers to
APIC registers should be volatile.  To initialise the BSP's local APIC,
set the enable bit in the spurious interrupt vector register and set
the error interrupt vector in the local vector table.
<p>

<h3>
<a name="booting">Booting Application Processors</a>
</h3>

Once you have detected the processors in the system, set up your local
APIC, and verified that you can communicate with it (hint: read the
APIC version register), it's time to boot the APs.  N.B. that it is good
practise to not try to boot the BSP here.  That would be bad.
<p>

Since the APs will wake up in real mode, everything they need to get
started should be in low memory (below 0x100000 or one megabyte).
First, set the shutdown code by setting address 0:f to 0xa.  Then,
grab a page of memory for the AP's stack.  You will also need space
to store the `trampoline' code, i.e. the code the processor executes
after waking up to switch to protected mode and jump to the kernel.
You can either use the same page of code for each processor or store
the code at the bottom of the processor's stack.  Note that the start of
the code must be at a page-aligned address.  Copy the code there, then
set the warm reset vector at address 40:67 to the start of this code.
Next, you should reset a bit in the kernel which the processor will use
to signal that it has booted and finished initialisation and clear any
APIC error by writing a zero to the error status register.  If you need
to pass any parameters or data to the AP, now would be a good time to
set that up.  For example, since OpenBLT's kernel runs in high memory,
I have to pass the address of the page directory in memory so that the
AP can load it and enable paging before calling the kernel.
<p>

Now you can actually boot the processor.  The procedure consists of
sending a sequence of interrupts to the processor.  The incremental effect
of each is undefined, but at the end of the sequence, the processor will
be booted.  First send an INIT IPI.  Assert the INIT signal by writing
the target processor's APIC ID to the high word of the interrupt command
register.  Then write to the low word with the bits set to enable the INIT
delivery mode, level triggered, and assert the interrupt.  Deassert INIT
by repeating the procedure with the assert bit reset.  Now, wait 10 ms.
Use of the APIC timer is suggested.
<p>

If the local APIC is not an 82489dx, you need to send two STARTUP IPIs.
Clear APIC errors, set the target APIC ID in the ICR, then send the
interrupt by writing to the low word of the ICR with bits set for STARTUP
delivery mode and with the code vector in the low byte.  The code vector
is the physical page number at which the processor should start executing,
i.e. the start of your trampoline code.  Wait 200 ms, then check the low
word of the ICR to make sure bit 16 is reset to indicate the interrupt
was dispatched before sending the second STARTUP.  After sending it,
spin and wait for the AP to set its ready bit in memory.  You may want
to set a timeout of 5 seconds, after which you assume the processor did
not wake up.
<p>

<h3>
<a name="protmode">Switching from Real Mode to Protected Mode</a>
</h3>

Provided you did everything right above, the processor at some point woke
up in real mode and started executing the code you told it to.  First,
execute a "cli" instruction to turn off interrupts, just in case.  Now,
begin the switch to protected mode.  Load an appropriatee value into GDTR.
This can either point to the actual GDT or in my case, a temporary GDT.
If you need to activate paging, load the address of a page directory
into cr3.  Then set bit zero in cr0 to enable protected mode as well as
bit 31 if you need to enable paging to get into the kernel.  Then do an
ljmp to the kernel text segment with an offset that points to the next
instruction to serialise the processor.  Now that you're in protected
mode, load appropriate descriptors into the segment registers, then
execute a "cld", which is reportedly what gcc expects.  Then, jump to
the starting address of your kernel.
<p>

Don't reference any symbols in this code since it
will be running at an address for which it was not linked;
all memory references must be absolute.  Since your kernel is above
one megabyte in memory, you can't access any global variables in real
mode.  Also be careful in specifying your offset address for the ljmp
instruction, and do specify the address of the start of your kernel,
not a symbol in the instruction that goes into the kernel.
Jumping to a symbol doesn't seem to work.  For details,
see OpenBLT's kernel/trampoline.S.
<p>

Debugging this part is really not too bad.  What you have to do is
establish some communication space in low memory, then have the AP write
bytes to that memory to explain what it is doing and print these out on
the BSP.
<p>

<h3>
<a name="ipis">Interprocessor Interrupts</a>
</h3>

IPIs are used to maintain synchronisation between the processors.
For example, if a kernel page table entry changes, both processors must
either flush their TLBs or invalidate that particular page table entry.
Whichever processor changed the mapping knows to do this automatically,
but the other processor does not; therefore, the processor which changed
the mapping must send an IPI to the other processor to tell it to flush
its TLB or invalidate the page table entry.
<p>

Using the local APIC, you can send interrupts to all processors, all
processors but the one sending the interrupt, or a specific processor
or logical address as well as self-interrupts.  To send an IPI, write
the destination APIC ID, if needed, into the high word of the ICR, then
write the low word of ICR with the destination shorthand and interrupt
vector set to send the IPI.  Be sure to wrap these functions in spinlocks.
You might want to turn off interrupts as well while sending IPIs.
<p>

<h3>
<a name="other">Other Considerations</a>
</h3>

One thing to note is that semaphores (a.k.a. spinlocks) may need to
be done differently under SMP.  Consider a scenario where semaphores
are procured with a ``bts'' instruction.  If both processors hit that
instruction at the same time while the semaphore is reset, they might
both think they have acquired it.  For this reason, you would need to
use a ``lock'' prefix on that instruction to lock the system bus and
maintain synchronisation.
