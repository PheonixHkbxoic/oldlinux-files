<H1><FONT size=+4>Chris's Chamber</FONT></H1></CENTER>Welcome to Chris Lattner's 
Homepage. This page gives a one-sided glimpse into his life, illustrating some 
of his areas of interest. Where you go depends on what <B>you</B> want to know 
about. So then, what is it? Do you <A 
href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/Projects/">want see a semi-complete list of 
projects I work on</A>? Are you interested in <A 
href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/java/">Java Programming</A>? Maybe your are 
more of an <A href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/">operating systems</A> <A 
href="http://korbit.sourceforge.net/">hacker</A>? Perhaps you like operating 
systems, but are <A href="http://korbit.sourceforge.net/">feeling a little bit 
twisted today</A>? Do you have a web site? Do you want to get the low-down on <A 
href="http://www.nondot.org/MagicStats/">who visits your website and why</A>? 
Perhaps you want to <A href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/stats/">see</A> <A 
href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/Stats">some</A> of the <A 
href="http://www.nondot.org/MagicStats/stats">stats</A> for my pages? Maybe you 
are more of a <A href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/graphpro/">graphics</A> <A 
href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/java/GRAS/">programmer</A> <A 
href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/Projects/Raytracer/">type person</A>? Maybe 
you are interested in <A 
href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/SeniorProject/project.html">seeing a game</A> 
I <A href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/SeniorProject/">wrote back in high 
school</A>? Maybe you want to flashback to 1996 when I was into programming with 
<A href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/mystuff/units.html">turbo pascal</A> and <A 
href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/mystuff/tp_progs.html">assembly</A>? Are you a 
<A href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/Projects/HaskellLexer/">fan of the 
functional programming languages</A>? Perhaps you are more interested in the art 
of <A href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/Projects/#llvm">compiler design and 
implementation</A>? Hrm, it's possible you are an <A 
href="http://www.gnu.org/">open source/free software</A> fanatic... If so, 
you'll find that every line of code available on this site is available for use 
just about however you would like to. I also have some <A 
href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/Mirrored/">documentations mirrored here</A>. 
Maybe you are a wuss and want things laid out better for you? ...
