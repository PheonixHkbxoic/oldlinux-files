This is the utilities disk for installing the MCC (Manchester Computing
Centre) interim version of Linux.  To set up your hard disk:

     Use fdisk to create a primary partition for Linux.  The format of the
     command is 'fdisk [device]'; the default device is /dev/hda, and others
     are /dev/hdb, /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc, etc.  You may also wish
     to set up other partitions for Linux, and/or a partition of at least
     5 megabytes for swap space.  Give the command V (verify) before
     writing your partition table.

     AFTER USING FDISK, REBOOT AND REMOUNT THIS DISK ON /mnt.

     Use mkfs and mkswap to initialise the partitions you created above.
     If you do not remember their blocksize, use fdisk with the command p
     to display it (and then q to exit).  mkfs and mkswap have this syntax:

          mkxxx [-c] /dev/hdxxx nnnnn

     where [-c] optionally checks the partition, hdxxx is the partition's
     device as reported by fdisk, and nnnnn is the partition's size in blocks
     as reported by fdisk.

Alternatively, you may be updating an older version of Linux.  In that
case, only the commands and files contained in this disk will be replaced.
The installation procedure saves old configuration files from /etc, /root,
and /home/user.

Use the command 'swapon /dev/hdxxx' to activate swap space made by mkswap.

Mount the new root partition on /root.  Mount any other partitions relative
to this; for example, fir you want a partition to become /usr/src on the
installed system, you should mount it on /root/usr/src.  When all partitions
are mounted, type 'install_root'.
