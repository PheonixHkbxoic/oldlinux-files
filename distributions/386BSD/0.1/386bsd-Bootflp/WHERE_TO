		Floppy, Tape, and CDROM Distribution Sets
			Where to Get Them

Since 386BSD is an unfunded project, we do not have the equipment or 
the facilities to provide floppy and tape dumps on demand, and have 
instead made 386BSD available via the network. The current list of
ftp mirror sites is in the file DISTRIBUTION.HOSTS.

However, there are several groups who have offered to provide 386BSD 
on floppies, tapes, or CDROM for a distribution fee, or who get together 
with others and make copies for interested users.

The following is an *incomplete* list of people who claim to provide
386BSD on floppies and/or tapes. 

This list is supplied to users of 386BSD as a courtesy, and should not 
in any way be considered an endorsement of any person, group, or company 
appearing on this list.

There is no verification of any information provided, including names, 
rates, and experience. If you are interested in purchasing 386BSD on
any media, we recommend that you follow established verification
and interview procedures before contracting for any services
with respect to 386BSD.

If you wish to add or delete the mention of a floppy or tape distributon
set provider, please contact ljolitz@cardio.ucsf.edu or CIS 76703,4266.

Thank you
