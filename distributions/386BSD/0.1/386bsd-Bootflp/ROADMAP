		     DISTRIBUTION SITE
			  ROADMAP



Greetings,

     This is the distribution site ROADMAP file	for  386BSD
Release	0.1.	If  this  site is an *official* distribution
host, the following file tree should be present. If this  is
not an official site, the host should display an appropriate
message routing users to an official site.   This  unaltered
file (ROADMAP) should also be included.

     The distribution is in contained in  three	sets  (bin-
dist,  srcdist,	etcdist). Each set is made up of a multivo-
lume, compressed, CPIO dump,  split  into  470	block  files
suitable  for  floppies	and/or download. Optionally, a site
may *also* set up a filesystem directory which contains	all
the  files  already  extracted and in position, for the pur-
poses of browsing and for individual downloading.

     The bootable/ directory contains two compressed  floppy
images:	the Tiny 386BSD Installation Floppy (dist.fs.Z) and
the Fixit Floppy (fixit.fs.Z).	For direct MS-DOS  download,
uncompressed  images  of these floppies are also present, as
well as the source and binary for rawrite, to  allow  people
to create the filesystem floppies themselves.

     The tools/ directory contains shell scripts for  making
floppies (rawrite, voldump) and verifying cksums (dcksum).

     Official patches, when they are released,	will  reside
in patches/. They will appear simultaneously on BIX and Com-
puserve and can be installed by the  Sysop.  (These  patches
will  also  be made available via the Internet/Usenet on the
newsgroup "comp.os.386bsd" when it is activated --  see	the
INSTALL.NOTES  file  for  further  information on this news-
group).	The unofficial/ directory will	contain  structured
(hopefully)  unofficial	patches, contributions, commentary,
analysis, and support information from contributors.  It  is
*mandatory*  that  this directory exist, but it is up to the
local Sysop what editorial control he exerts over it.

     Userdirectory contains the names and addresses of users
who  have registered with us (via REGISTRATION form) and who
have  requested	that  their  name,  affiliation  and  email
address	be  made  public here for contact with other 386BSD
users.

     Service.support contains a	unverified  and  disclaimed
list  of  people,  groups, and/or companies offering support
for 386BSD.  We require that anyone  wishing  to  appear  on
this  list send mail properly requesting inclusion or exclu-
sion, to avoid any potential problems.	Requests for  inclu-
sion  should  state the following: name, firm (if any), con-
tact address  and  country,  contact  phone/fax/telex/email,
areas of specialty, rates, and experience.  This information
is only for the purposes of aiding users, and is  definitely
not intended as *advertising*.


386BSD ROADMAP		2			July 1992










     Please note  that	userdirectory  is  mandatory,  while
service.support is not.

     The distribution sets are "set in granite" and unchang-
ing  from  the	point that the distribution arrives. We will
periodically  update   the   patches,	userdirectory,	and
service.support	files.	No  interim  releases will be made.
Anyone can add files to unofficial at any time.

     For   inquiries	on    386BSD,	send	email	to
ljolitz@cardio.ucsf.edu or CIS 76703,4266.

Thank you for your interest and assistance.

Bill and Lynne Jolitz.
