                    LINUX HARDWARE COMPATIBLITY HOWTO

VERSION: 0.6                                               DATE: 01 Aug 93


Note:  This list was originally posted by who-knows?  I don't remember, and
I haven't seen it in a while, so I'll take the responsibility of maintaining
this list.  Please send your hardware (in)compatibility lists to erc@apple.com.
PLEASE put the word "HARDWARE" in your subject line IN CAPS!
--------------------------------- cut here -----------------------------------
     Welcome to the Linux Hardware Compatibility HOWTO. It is my hope that
this will be of help to people and that it will do away with a lot of the
"Will XXX work with my System?" questions.  I also hope that this will help
people who want to buy a system to run Linux or are in the process of
upgrading their system and want to make sure that the hardware they buy is
compatible with Linux (especially for item's such as SCSI controller's and
CD-ROM's, and video cards for X).
	Please be aware that the list NO LONGER contains X hardware
specifics.  These will be posted as a seperate listing.(along with 
clocks, settings, etc.)
	People who have emailed me (erc@apple.com) about specific pieces
of hardware that they've gotten to work have their name and email address
printed alongside.  This is to help others who are having difficulty get
help directly from the guilty party. ;)

     If you are wondering about a specific piece of Hardware and you don't
find it in this list all I can say is I don't know at this time but as soon
as I find out it will be in the next list.  If you find out that it work's
from some other source, i.e. a friend or trying it out, PLEASE let me know.
Also even though a piece of equipment is on this system doesn't mean that I
know how to get it to work with Linux, it is on this list because someone
has told me that it works on THEIR system. So if it is on the list and
you can't make it work, it sounds like a good time to, in order, do:

	1) read ALL the faq's
	2) read comp.os.linux.help, and scan the subjects for your XXX
	3) email the person listed here who says it works (if any)
	3) post AFTER READING comp.os.linux.help and c.o.l.announce.

    Thanks to everyone that has helped and sent info this list,it  is a lot 
better because of their help!

This HOWTO is archived in a number of places, including sunsite.unc.edu in
/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. It is posted periodically to comp.os.linux.announce.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
-----------------

From: mow@marsu.tynet.sub.org

The ProAudio Spectrum 16 does not work properly in combination
with the Adaptec 1542B. This is due to both card's busmastering
feature. NeXTSTEP/Intel even crashes with this configuration.
