		     TAMU-1.0D Linux BINARY SET
                      Installation Instructions

MINIMUM HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
    80386 CPU
    4MB or more of RAM, 60MB of disk space (base)
RECOMMENDED HARDWARE:
    80486 CPU
    8MB RAM 100MB disk

------------------------------------------------------------------------

BEFORE INSTALLATION:

1. Retrieve the appropriate files from net.tamu.edu:
	boot
	bin.*
   Note: the boot diskette must be used in your drive A:
         but you may use any floppy drive for the install disk set.
         So if you have a 5.25 a: and 3.5 drive b:, the boot
         diskette must be 5.25, but the install set may be either
         5.25 or 3.5.

2. Transfer the images to diskettes with either dd (unix) or
   rawrite (dos).  (Rawrite and uncompress for DOS are available
   from net.tamu.edu in util/dos-utils).  By the way, dd runs 
   MUCH faster to floppies on a Sun if the blocking is set up 
   correctly. For 3.5 inch floppies on a Sun sparcstation:
	dd bs=18k conv=sync if=boot of=/dev/rfd0

NOTE:!!!
   The bin.* files are diskette *IMAGES*.  That is, they exactly fill
   a raw diskette, and cannot be copied as files to diskettes as a DOS
   file. If you try under DOS to do "copy bin.01 a:" the file will
   not fit. You must use some tool like rawrite to write the image to
   diskette.

   The rawrite steps can be combined/simplified with the use of the new
   "rawfd" dos device driver, available in the dos_utils directory on
   net.tamu.edu:pub/linux.  This raw floppy device driver (which can be
   loaded in config.sys, or from the dos command prompt) allows one to
   ftp *directly* to the raw floppy disk, as if it were a regular
   destination file.  For example, the ftp command "get boot rawfda"
   would ftp the boot disk image, and write it directly to the raw
   floppy in drive a:. In addition, rawfd will also format the floppy
   as it writes out the data, thus saving another step.

3. Determine necessary information about your configuration:
   With the new automated installation, the only required information
   you need is (and you need this ONLY if you are networked):
	hostname
	ip address
	netmask
	local nameserver address
	local default route address

   This package uses the standard linux naming scheme:
	fd0H1440	3.5 inch HD floppy (a:)
	fd0h1200	5.25 inch HD floppy (a:)
	fd1H1440	3.5 inch HD floppy (b:)
	fd1h1200	5.25 inch HD floppy (b:)
	hda		entire ide/mfm first *drive*
	hda1 .. hda4	first thru fourth *partition* on hda
	hdb		entire ide/mfm second *drive*
	hdb1 .. hdb4	first thru fourth *partition* on hdb
	sda		entire scsi first *drive*
	sda1 .. sda4	first thru fourth *partition* on sda

------------------------------------------------------------------------


INSTALLATION:

If your disk will be sharing space with other operating systems, such
as DOS, INSTALL THE OTHER SYSTEMS FIRST.  My preferred layout is OS/2
on partition 1 using HPFS, DOS/WIN3.1 on partition 2 using FAT, an
extended partition on partition 3 with a FAT filesystem (so it appears
as drive d: to both OS/2 and DOS), and linux in partition 4. If you
install them in this order, and in these locations, then TAMU linux's 
bootactv can be used for boot time selection, and OS/2's Boot Mangler
is not needed. (REALLY!)

There are two installation methods: a simple menu driven installation
script for most configurations (single linux root partition),
or manual installation for experienced users with more complex needs.


AUTOMATED INSTALLATION:

1. Boot the "boot" diskette.

   	IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT AVAILABLE BOOT KERNELS:

	The boot diskette has two tiny kernels: one for scsi
 	or ide disk systems, and one just for ide based systems.
	Both tiny kernels have all unnecessary drivers, such as
	networking, CDROM, and special serial/mouse drivers
	removed, as these sometimes conflict with a given
	hardware configuration. By default, lilo will boot the
 	combined scsi/ide kernel in ramdisk mode.  If you have 
	an ide only system, and the scsi probing code conflicts
	with your hardware, you can try the ide only kernel.
	If you press <tab> at the lilo boot prompt, you will
 	see a list of available boot modes:
		ramdisk      (scsi/ide kernel)
		floppy       (scsi/ide kernel)
		harddisk     (scsi/ide kernel)
		ide_ramdisk  (ide only kernel)
		ide_floppy   (ide only kernel)
		ide_harddisk (ide only kernel)
	The automatic install requires that you boot in the ramdisk mode.
	If you have insufficient memory for this, you can do a manual 
	install from a floppy mode boot. The harddisk mode boot is
	useful as a backup way to boot a linux hard disk partition,
	if you have problems with the normal lilo boot.

	The installed linux system has a full "generic" linux kernel
	(/vmlinuz) with ide, scsi, drivers, along with all possible
	network and mouse drivers.  If the boot diskette works, but
	the installed hard disk kernel has problems booting due to
	driver conflicts with your hardware configuration, you will
	have to boot the hard disk using the boot diskette (selecting
	either the "harddisk" or "ide_hardisk" modes, and then
	configure and build a kernel tailored for your hardware
	(as discussed in "Rebuilding the kernel:" later in this document).


   The lilo boot program will prompt for "Boot" device -- press a 
   shift key to see a help screen listing boot choices, and then simply
   press enter.  (If you have a value point or other non-standard hardware,
   you may need to enter some lilo boot parameters here - see the
   examples on the boot information screen, or the latest FAQ for details.)
   As the kernel boots, you will be asked for video
   mode desired -- either select one of the choices, or let the
   prompt time out.  You will finally see a menu:

	Linux Maintenance Diskette

	1 - Install a full distribution set
	2 - Exit to linux shell
 
   press '1' and enter, to start the automated installation program.
   If you want to do a manual install, or other maintenance, press 2.  

2.  Running the automated installation program:

    The program will first ask a series of questions to determine
    the desired installation configuration.  In every case, a 
    default answer will be provided, and this default answer will
    be displayed in parentheses (default) at the end of the question.
    To accept the default answer, simply press enter.

    The questions asked are:

    - What floppy drive will be used for installation? 
	simply pick (1-4) from the menu

      (A list of available partitions (including any free partitions)
      are then presented.)
    - Do you need to run fdisk now? (n)
	you need to run fdisk only if none of the displayed
 	partitions (including any free space) are suitable.

    - Which partition will be used for linux? (/dev/hda1)
	The default partition is chosen to be the largest linux or empty
 	partition found.  Non linux partitions will not be automatically
	selected as default partitions, but they are displayed on the 
	list, and can be chosen.

    - Setup swapping (for 4MB ram or less)? (y)
	Swapping to a 4MB swap file will be configured by default unless 
	there is insufficient space in the selected partition. 
	Swapping must be selected if you have 4MB of ram or less,
	or subsequent steps may run out of memory.

    - Install all files? (y/n)
        The default is to install all files in the distribution set.
	If you would like to selectively install packages from the set,
        enter 'n'.  The installation program will then ask you to remove
   	the boot diskette, and insert the first data diskette, so that it
	can read the Table Of Contents (TOC). once it has read the TOC,
	it will for each package list the package name and size in bytes,
	and ask if you want it installed. The TAMU-1.0D TOC list contains:

	Package Name	Size (bytes)	Diskette #
	base 		 3508234	1
	extra 		 4830318	1,2,3
	network 	 1084081	3	
	development 	11282586	3,4,5
	kernel_src	 5081820	5,6
	man_pages 	 7048497	6,7
	emacs 		15305892	7,8,9
	ghostscript 	 1022020	9,10
	groff 		 1964556	10,11
	libc-lite 	  619524	11
	X_libX11 	  478272	12
	X_base 		25698219	12,13,14,15,16,17
	X_server_8514 	  848900
	X_server_Mach32   885764
	X_server_Mach8 	  869380
	X_server_Mono 	  771076
	X_server_S3 	  947204
	X_server_SVGA 	  947204
	X_server_VGA16 	  791556
	X_man_pages 	 4237255
	X_server_kit 	 3501751	21

	The base package is the only required package. It contains the
	kernel, /bin, /sbin, /boot, /lib, and some /usr/bin files
	necessary for booting a basic linux system.

	The X_libX11 package is separate from the rest of X_base,
	as it must be included if you load the emacs package.

	You need at least one of the X_server pakcages, based on your
	your graphics hardware. The X_server_kit is optional.


    - Do you want BOOTACTV (boot time partition selector) installed? (y)
	bootactv is a simple MBR (master boot record) boot partition
	selector.  You want this if you have multiple partitions
	on the first drive.  You don't want it if you need to boot 
	linux on a second drive partition, as in this case, LILO 
	needs to be put in the first drive MBR. (see next question)

    - Where do you want lilo installed? (/dev/hda1):
	If you asked for bootactv, the lilo bootstrap will default
	to the selected linux partition.  If not, lilo will default to
	the MBR.
 
    - What is this machine's hostname? (tamu) 
	Simply enter the machine's desired hostname (default "tamu")

    - Do you want networking configured? (y):
	simply enter 'n' if you don't want networking enabled.

If you asked for networking, you will get the following added questions:

    - What domain is the machine in (tamu.edu) 
	simply enter your IP domain name

    - What is this host's IP address (192.9.200.1) 
	enter your host's IP address

    - What is the netmask (default) 
	The presented default is correct for standard class A, B, or C
	networks.  If your net is subnetted, you will need to override 
	default with your local netmask.  For example, tamu.edu
    	has a class B network (128.194), so the default presented
	is 255.255.0.0, but we actually are subnetted with mask of 
	255.255.255.0

    - What is the network's address (default) 
	The network address is (your IP address & NETMASK),
	ie a host part of all zeros.
	The default should be correct unless your subnet mask is
	not on a byte boundary, in which case you may need to override
	the presented value.

    - what is the broadcast address (default)
	The broadcast address is (your IP address | !NETMASK)
	ie a host part of all ones.
	The default should be correct unless your subnet mask is
	not on a byte boundary, in which case you may need to override
	the presented value.
	
    - What is the default gateway (default) 
	The calculated default is host 254 on your network. You will
	probably want to change this.

    - What is the nameserver address (default)
	The calculated default is host 254 on your network. You will
	probably want to change this.

Once these questions are answered, the program will display the selected
partition, and ask for confirmation to proceed.  The default on this 
question is 'n' -- you HAVE to enter 'y' to proceed.

The rest of the installation is automatic - it will tell you to take
out the boot diskette, and enter the bin.* diskettes one at a time.
Note that the new installation program is very forgiving of errors;
if you insert the wrong diskette, it will tell you which disk you 
inserted, and ask for the correct one again.  When the installation
is finished, it will remind you to remove the last data diskette,
and reboot (use ctrl-alt-del).
The first time you reboot, fsck may check the root partition.
In all subsequent reboots, as long as you use halt or reboot, the
filesystems should be clean, and fsck will skip the time consuming
checks.	 
 
RUNNING FDISK:

If you do want to run fdisk manually:

    If you want to run fdisk during the automated installation, simply
    enter 'y' at the appropriate question.
    You will be asked which disk device to partition, such
    as hda, hdb, sda, sdb as discussed above.
    Fdisk has command help available with the "m" command.

    "fdisk" should be able to determine your disk's geometry.  If not,
    you will need to tell it the number of cylinders, heads, and sectors
    of your hard disk.  Use the "x" command to switch to expert menu.
    Then use the "c" command to specify the cylinders, "h" command to
    specify heads, and "s" command to specify the sectors of your disk.
    Now use the "r" command to return to the starting menu.

    The instructions here are a little less clear since your partitioning
    preferences may be different.  I will give an example of 3 partitions,
    one for DOS, one for swap and the other for the root filesystem.  
    I have a 90M drive that I want to partition into 10M for DOS, 
    10M linux swap and 70M linux root file system.

    First I use the "p" command to print the partition table.  I see
    that my disk has 1024 cylinders, and that partition 1 (DOS) covers
    cylinders 1 through 114.  Then I use the "d" command to delete any
    partitions other than DOS (partition 1).  I then use the "n"
    command to create new partitions.  "fdisk" will ask me if I want a
    primary of extended partition: use primary.  Next it will ask me
    where to start the partition: I use cylinder 115.  I want my first
    partition to be a swap partitoin of size 10M.  The computer asks me
    how big to make the partition: I enter 114 cylinders.  I create a
    second primary partition starting at cylinder 229 and make it 796
    cylinders in size.

    By default, all partitions are created as Linux/MINIX partitions.
    Since we want to use partition 2 for swap, we need to change its
    type, or "system id".  Use the "t" command to change the type:
    choose partition 2 and choose type 82 "Linux swap".  Similarly,
    partition 3 needs to be changed to type 83 (extfs).  A complete
    list of supported partition types can be obtained using the "l"
    command.

    Before we go, use the "p" command to print the partition table and
    note down the number of blocks for each partition.  We will need this
    in the next step.

    We are now done with this.  Use the "w" command to write the information
    to disk and exit "fdisk".

    When you exit fdisk, you will be reminded to reboot, which you must do
    now, if you changed any partition information with fdisk. To reboot,
    press <control>-<alt>-<delete> keys together. If you did not make
    any changes, simply press return to continue installation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


MANUAL INSTALLATION:

 1. Boot your computer with disk "boot".
    At the maintenance menu, select (2.) to exit to a command shell.
 
 2. Run the "fdisk" command.  Partitions the disk as desired and note down
    the number of blocks allocated to each partition. (see the earlier
    description of this.)

    [ /sbin/fdisk /dev/hda ]

 3. Reboot your machine.

    (Ctrl-Alt-Del or push reset button).

 4. Run "mkefs" to create the file system on all non-swap partitions.

    [ /sbin/mke2fs -c /dev/hda2 72345 ]

    (I pulled 72345 out of air for this example, but you should used
    the number of blocks fdisk reported in the previous step.)

 5. do the actual installation:
    [ mount -t ext2 /dev/hda2 /mnt ]
    [ cd /mnt ]
    [ label -u -i /dev/fd0H1440 |gzip -d|tar xBpf - ]

    (change hda2 fd0H1440 and 1440 as appropriate)

 6. configure the new root files:
    [ cd /mnt/etc ]
    [ /mnt/usr/bin/vi system_config ]
	this file contains definitions for the system configuration.
	edit the example values appropriately.
    [ ../sbin/doconfig ]

 7. If you have more than one operating system (eg DOS and Linux)
    and want to have boot time selection of which operating system
    to run, install bootactv on your boot drive:

    [ cd /mnt/boot; /mnt/bin/cp bootactv.bin /dev/hda ]

    ( substitute your drive name for "/dev/hda")

8. prepare for reboot:

    [ cd / ]
    [ umount /mnt ]
    [ sync ]

------------------------------------------------------------------------


FURTHER CONFIGURATION:

 1. remove all floppies, and reboot the machine:
    [ control-alt-delete ]

 2. Log in as root by typing "root" at the login prompt.

    [ root ]
     set a password for root:
    [ passwd ]

 3. You are now mostly done.  You may still need to configure /etc/mtools,
    /etc/fstab (if necessary for cdrom ...), and
    /usr/X386/lib/X11/Xconfig.hostname. You may also want to rebuild
    the kernel for your configuration (the default kernel has only
    necessary devices in it, and assumes you have only a 80386 processor).
    Hints for the last two follow later.

 4. If you need to change any of the configuration values entered
    during installation (such as ip address ...), you need to change
    the respective entry in /etc/system_config. If you are turning 
    networking on for the first time, you will then need to run
    doconfig, which creates some networking config files based on the
    system_config information. NOTE that this will update /etc/fstab,
    so if you have customized it, save a copy and restore it afterwards.

FINAL TIPS:

1. use "useradd -m user_name" to build a regular user account,
   (the -m switch uses the /etc/skel files for the user home skeleton).
   You will need to set a password for them ("passwd user_name").

2. root and the user skeleton is now configured to use fvwm.
   Fvwm is configured to popup window tools on the left mouse button,
   utilities on the right button, and games on the middle button.
   (If your mouse has only two buttons, the middle button is emulated
   by pressing both buttons simultaneously.)

3. For a fun demo of ghostscript, use xfm to cd into 
   /usr/lib/ghostscript/examples, and drag/drop any of the examples 
   onto the xfm application "ghostscript".

4. if you rebuild the kernel, be sure to run "ps -U" to update
   /etc/psdatabase. Do this before doing a "make clean" in the 
   /usr/src/linux directory, as the system file in /usr/src/linux/tools
   is needed by "ps -U".

5. if you are new to Linux, be sure to try the four virtual terminals,
   available with <left-alt>-F1 thru <left-alt>-F4. Under X-windows,
   the virtual terminals are reached with <ctrl>-<alt>-F1 thru F4,
   and you return to X with <alt>-F5.

6. You can use the boot disk for maintenance (in case of filesystem
   problems, the disk has e2fsck), or for reinstallation from your
   own backup set. NOTE - the maintenance disk does not have 'ls'
   so you can't look around.  /sbin has most system commands
   (mount, umount, fsck, mkfs...), and /bin has most /bin commands.

7. to make a backup compatible with the installation disk:
   [cd /]
   [tar cf - .|gzip|label -o /dev/fd0H1440 ]
   (or as appropriate for your floppy)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rebuilding the kernel:
1. cd /usr/src/linux
2. run "make config"
   This will ask which optional devices you want in the kernel.
3. run "make dep"
4. run "make clean"
5. run "make"
6. install the kernel:
	cp zImage /vmlinuz
	lilo
That's it!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

XFree86-2.1 Configuration:

Getting the new XFree86-2.1 running involves three major steps:
    1. point /usr/X386/bin/X to the appropriate server for you adapter.
    2. Create the config file /usr/X386/lib/X11/Xconfig.<hostname>
    3. Edit the config file for your mouse.

1. Choosing the server:
	cd /usr/X386/bin
	rm X
	ln -s XF86_<type> X
    where <type> is one of "SVGA", "8514", "Mach8" "Mach32", "S3",
    "MONO", or "VGA_16"

2. Creating the Xconfig file:
There are several configuration options for XFree86-2.1:
    A. Sample configuration files
    B. Simplified scanning Xconfig.1m
    C. The "right" (pain in the rear end) way

A. Sample Config files:
The directory /usr/X386/lib/X11/Xconfig.Samples has a number of 
preconfigured Xconfig files for common adapters/monitors. Check
the index file to see if one is available.  If one is, simply copy it to
/usr/X386/lib/X11/Xconfig.<hostname>.

B. SIMPLIFIED X Window Configuration
In /usr/lib/X11 there are several Xconfig templates:
	Xconfig.hostname -  *DEFAULT* - working copy of Xconfig.1M
	Xconfig.1M       -  the install version for 1MB vga cards
	Xconfig          -  working copy of Xconfig.master
	Xconfig.master   -  standard X11 release version (manual install)
	Xconfig.drs      -  this is my tailored copy of Xconfig.1M

By default, when you run "startx", the server will use Xconfig.tamu,
as the hostname is "tamu". This file is a working copy of the .1M
easy installation version for 1MB vga cards.  If your vga card has
only 512K bytes of memory, it can not run in the 1024x768 resolution
modes, so you need to delete these modes from the Xconfig file. If
you are running on a notebook, you probably can use only the 640 x 480
modes.

Then, in Xconfig.tamu:

1. check the mouse definitions, and if necessary, comment out the default
   (microsoft mouse on ttyS0, aka com1:) and uncomment the line
   corresponding to your mouse type and port. 
   If your mouse has 3 buttons, comment out the "Emulate3Buttons" line.

2. run "xinit"
   There will be 48 available "modes" that are essentially all possible
   combinations of clocks and resolutions. You can cycle through all of
   these modes by pressing control-alt-keypad+.  (If your vga card has
   512K, there will be only 32 modes). The modes are named "1" through
   "48" and appear in that order.  Most of these modes will show
   garbage on your screen. Jot down the number (ie 1 - 48) of any
   mode that presents a reasonable display (minor size or x/y offset
   errors can be trimmed out later.) Hopefully you will find at least
   one good mode for each of 1024x768, 800x600, and 640x480 display
   resolutions.  Exit X using control-alt-backspace, and then edit
   Xconfig.tamu, to delete the "bad" mode numbers out of the "Modes"
   line, leaving just the few good ones you jotted down. (You can look 
   at my final version in Xconfig.drs, which left just three modes on 
   the "Modes" line.)

That should be it! No puzzling over the vga database, frequencies,
clocks, or dot calculations!  This has been tested on several machines
with Tseng, trident, and paradise cards.  On my own tseng clone,
in 1 minute I discovered two very nice modes that I had missed in
hours of testing using other methods!

(2.1 If necessary, you may need to tweak the dot values in the corresponding
   mode entries in the ModeDB section, if the display is a little off center.
   Each mode line in the ModeDB section has 4 numbers for horizontal dots,
   and four numbers for vertical dots. If the display is a little off in
   the horizontal or vertical position, try adjusting the MIDDLE two
   numbers in the respective horizontal or vertical set by 10 or 20 dots.
   This needs to be done by trial and error, but at least you have a good
   starting point. ) 

C. The "right" way:
Read /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/?????? adn follow the instructions.

3. Setting the mouse:
