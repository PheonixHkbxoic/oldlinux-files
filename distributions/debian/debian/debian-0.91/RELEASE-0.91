Bug Reporting
=============

Please mail bug reports, comments and suggestions to <debian-bugs@pixar.com>.

[ NOTE to BETA testers: this is intended for those not on the debian-devel
  list.  If you are, then don't bother with debian-bugs.  It's simply a
  way for end-users to easily reports bugs to us. ]

 
Mailing lists
=============

There are several mailing lists devoted to the Debian Linux distribution:

* debian-announce@pixar.com   A moderated mailing list for important Debian
			      Linux announcements (new releases, bug fixes,
			      etc.)

* debian-devel@pixar.com      A _closed_ mailing list for use only by Debian
			      Linux developers and BETA testers

* debian-user@pixar.com       An open forum for users of Debian Linux

These lists are managed by Bruce Perens <bruce@pixar.com>.  Bruce is also
the moderator of debian-announce.  Special thanks to Bruce for setting these
lists up for us.

From Bruce, here's how these lists can be joined:

> The first two lists are open admission. You join them by sending e-mail
> to LISTSERV@pixar.com with these two commands in the body of the message:
>  
> 	subscribe debian-announce YOUR-ENGLISH-NAME
> 	subscribe debian-user YOUR-ENGLISH-NAME
> 	help
>  
> You can leave out the command for any list you aren't interested in. For
> instance, Ian Murdock sent these e-mail commands to LISTSERV@pixar.com to
> join the lists:
>  
> 	subscribe debian-announce Ian Murdock
> 	subscribe debian-user Ian Murdock
> 	help
>  
> The debian-devel list is closed-admission. You join this by sending
> mail to bruce@pixar.com with a sentence or so explaining that you are
> developing software or that you will continue to beta-test the Debian
> releases.
>  
> The list server will say that you can only post from the address you
> subscribed from. That feature is disabled, you can post from any address.
