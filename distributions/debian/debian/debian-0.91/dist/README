The Debian Linux binary distribution, version 0.91 BETA.

The bootdisk and basedisk images may be found in the directory `base'.
Installation of the basedisks is _required_.  Simply download the three
disk images, use gunzip to decompress them and then dd or rawrite the
images to floppy disk.  Boot the system with the bootdisk and follow
the instructions to install the base system.

Debian Linux packages may be found in the directory `packages'.
Installation of these packages is completely optional.  Install only
the packages that you need or want with the `dpkg' utility; printable
ASCII and PostScript copies of the dpkg man page can be found in the
top-level `doc' directory.
