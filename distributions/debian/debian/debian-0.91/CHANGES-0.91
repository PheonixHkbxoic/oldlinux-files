NOTE: Please install 0.91 if you have installed 0.90 or before.  The
change from absolute to relative pathnames will make it impossible to
upgrade in the future with dpkg if you are not running 0.91 or later.
Please do not attempt to manually upgrade to 0.91 from any previous
version; it simply WILL NOT WORK.

Changes from 0.90 to 0.91:

* repackaged the distribution using relative pathnames in the packages. 

* worded the mounting example in dinstall slightly better.

* fixed the problem with selecting no swap partition in dsetup.

* fixed several minor problems in dpkg, most notably the bug that reset
  the number of packages installed after each disk.  Several additional
  changes were made to the script, but they were minor, including
  modifications to deal with relative pathnames, a fix so that package
  dependencies actually WORK now and better error handling when a
  filesystem cannot be mounted.

* upgraded to Linux kernel 0.99.14w.  This fixed the `ftp: setsockopt
  TOS (ignored)' problem we were having with ftp and rlogin/rsh.

* patched dip-3.3.7 to work with recent kernels.  Thanks, Christian.

* some permission changes: chsh, rlogin and rsh weren't SUID.

* upgraded to fixperms 1.0.  It now reports incorrect owner/group when
  appropriate.

* a bit more, but I forget exactly what.  I must start keeping better
  notes.
