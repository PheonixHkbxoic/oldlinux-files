                   How to Submit a Debian Bug Report

Please carefully read the following information about how to write a
bug report for Debian Linux.  Following these guidelines will greatly
increase the chances that someone will have enough information to
correct your problem.

Please read the Linux FAQ before sending in a bug report.  The Linux
FAQ is located in /usr/doc if you installed `doc.deb' on your Debian
system.  The Linux FAQ is also available in
   nic.funet.fi (128.214.6.100)   /pub/OS/Linux/doc
   tsx-11.mit.edu (18.172.1.2)    /pub/linux/docs
   sunsite.unc.edu (152.2.22.81)  /pub/Linux/docs

Please read appropriate HOWTO documents, info pages, manual pages, or
other miscellaneous documentation.  HOWTO and miscellaneous documents
are located in /usr/doc if you installed `doc.deb' on your Debian
system.  They are also available in
   nic.funet.fi (128.214.6.100)   /pub/OS/Linux/doc/HOWTO
   tsx-11.mit.edu (18.172.1.2)    /pub/linux/docs/HOWTO
   sunsite.unc.edu (152.2.22.81)  /pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO

Please read the Debian PROBLEMS file before sending in a bug report.
The PROBLEMS file describes known bugs in the current version of Debian
and any known fixes.  Please do not report problems listed in this file
unless you have a fix for them.  This is not yet written, but will be
made available on sunsite.unc.edu in the future.

Please send the completed form, located below, to debian-bugs@pixar.com
or debian-user@pixar.com (the former is encouraged).  For problems that
you are unable to understand or correct, use the debian-bugs address.

Information about interim solutions will be posted regularly to the
debian-announce@pixar.com list.

Please delete the text in brackets before sending it in.
