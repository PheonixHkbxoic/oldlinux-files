This directory contains a bootable floppy disk image that should allow you
to boot linux on any 386 or 486 PC with a supported ethernet card. 

The kernel is linux-pl10 + ALPHA-diffs + one line fix + minor ioperm mods
(which you really don't want to know about).


FILES
-----
README 		-- this file.
linux-pl10a.gz  -- the bootable root disk image.
scsi-xt-boot.gz -- boot floppy with scsi, xt kitchen sink etc support.
usr.bin.tgz     -- user networking binaries *unpack in /usr*
usr.etc.tgz     -- networking daemons etc   *unpack in /usr*
keymaps.tgz     -- non UK keymaps (cp to /etc/keymap)

INSTALLATION:
------------
You can copy the image onto a floppy from most unix/linux machines with:
gunzip &lt; linux-pl10a.gz | dd of=/dev/fd0 bs=18k

Under msdog you will need to gunzip (with gzip.exe -d) the image then copy
it to a floppy with rawrite.exe.


LIMITATIONS:
-----------

The image will only fit on a 3.5" drive, so you must have a 3.5" drive as A:

Booting is slow, the disk got pretty fragmented in setting up and I didn't
use the lilo fast read options which don't work on all machines.

The bootable root disk only has ide, nfs, minix, ext2, mouse and math emu.

If you want to have SCSI or XT disk support, you will need to use the scsi
boot image and then insert the bootable root disk at the prompt. (i.e. back
to the old boot and root disk system). 

UPDATE: the scsi-xt image now has all standard filesystems (i.e. ext and
xiafs are in).

If you are on the Oxford campus the image will mount a /usr partition from
ftp.robots, else where you must provide your own /usr. Attempting to mount
from ftp.robots will force me to remove this service, the current linux nfs
code will produces far to high ethernet and nfs server load to not cause 
major disruptions.

Although the ftp.robots /usr partition contains Xfree86, it is not possible
to run it over nfs as mmap is not supported over nfs (please feel free to
implement this and send the patches to linus - it isn't _that_ hard...).


WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:
----------------------
You need to know the following information before you can successfully use 
this boot image - make sure you know the configuration answers before 
attempting to boot!

1) Permission of your local netadmin.
2) Your PCs host name.
3) The IP address of your PC.
4) The IP address of the gateway/default router out of your network.
5) The netmask for your network

If you are outside Oxford you also need:
6) The IP address of your local named server.
7) a /usr partition that you can mount which contains the networking daemons
in /usr/etc and user binaries in /usr/bin

If you are not on a B or C class network the you will also need to know:
8) Your broadcast address
9) The net address for your network - what default packets for your local 
ethernet are routed to.


BOOTING:
-------
Supported cards are
The Novell NE-2000
The 3c503 EtherLink II
WD80x3 Western Digital (SMC) WD80x3. *#!

If you don't have one of these you are on your own.

*#! WD80x3 cards must have the shared ram address at 0x4E000 for them to work!
Use wdsetup under linux or ezsetup under dos to set this up.

Alternatively if the auto configure doesn't work you can stop the boot at the
lilo prompt and give the ethernet card options there as
ether=IRQ,IOADDR,SHMEMSTART,SHMEMEND,IS8BIT,eth0 

e.g.
LILO linux ether=10,0x300,0x4E000,0x52000,1,eth0


INSTALLING FROM THIS BOOT IMAGE:
--------------------------------

The aim of this image was to allow people to try linux before committing
themselves. It should be possible to also use it as an install base.

Use fdisk and mkfs prepare your hard disk in the normal way. Then mount the
new root partition on /mnt and you can use the /bin/copy_rootdisk script to
copy everything to your new root partition

e.g. 

#mount -t ext2 /mnt
#/bin/copy_rootdisk

Then edit /etc/lilo/config (/etc/lilo/config.hda is an example hard disk
setup) and run:

/etc/lilo/lilo -r /mnt 

to install linux on your hard disk.

If you don't have a UK keyboard, remove /etc/keymap (for US keyboards) or
replace /etc/keymap with the correct map from the keymap.tgz archive.

The rest is up to you.


BUGS:  
---- 

The binaries in usr.bin.tgz and usr.etc.tgz, are recent but possibly not the
most bug free, if you know of a superior version of any of these please mail
me at the address below. rlogin does works between a PC and SUN which makes
a change
