The patches enclosed are for the released version of bash 1.05.

All of the bugs specific to Bash 1.05 have been fixed (as far as they
have been reported), and some older bugs as well.

This is the first time that I have made patches available  This is
because Bash is approaching a stable state.

You can apply these patches to a pristine version of Bash 1.05 by
running the `patch' program with bash-1.05-patches as input in the
distribution directory:

	patch <bash-1.05-patches

As always, please send bug reports to bug-bash@prep.ai.mit.edu.
If you have a large patch to Bash, especially one which is complex, I
would suggest that you send it to bash-maintainers@ai.mit.edu, so that
we can correspond with you and keep the source in sync.

Thanks for using Bash,

	Brian Fox
