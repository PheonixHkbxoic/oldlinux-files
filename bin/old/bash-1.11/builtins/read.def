$BUILTIN read
$FUNCTION read_builtin
$SHORT_DOC read [-r] [name ...]
One line is read from the standard input, and the first word is
assigned to the first NAME, the second word to the second NAME, etc.
with leftover words assigned to the last NAME.  Only the characters
found in $IFS are recognized as word delimiters.  The return code is
zero, unless end-of-file is encountered.  If the -r option is given, a
backslash-newline pair (\\n) is not ignored, and the backslash is
considered to be part of the line.

/* Read the value of the shell variables whose names follow.
   The reading is done from the current input stream, whatever
   that may be.  Successive words of the input line are assigned
   to the variables mentioned in LIST.  The last variable in LIST
   gets the remainder of the words on the line.  If no variables
   are mentioned in LIST, then the default variable is $REPLY.

   S. R. Bourne's shell complains if you don't name a variable
   to receive the stuff that is read.  GNU's shell doesn't.  This
   allows you to let the user type random things. */
