README for the GNUish MS-DOS project.
Copyright (C) 1990 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
Last updated: 90-11-02.


The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is not highly interested in ports
of GNU software to MS-DOS, because they threaten to slow down the GNU
project by using up the time of the people who maintain GNU software.
However, Thorsten Ohl <td12@ddagsi3.bitnet> is organizing distribution
of such ports and moderating the GNUish MS-DOS project.

There is currently no room on prep.ai.mit.edu to put these files up
for ftp.  If prep get more disk space, they might become available.
For the present, see below for a list of ftp archive sites providing a
copy of the GNUish MS-DOS subdirectory and, for each ftp site, the
name and electronic address of the maintainer.

The GNUish MS-DOS subdirectory contains both MS-DOS ports of GNU
software and MS-DOS replacements for non-ported GNU software, the
collective whole being dubbed the "GNUish MS-DOS" project.

When several ports of the same tool exist, one of them has been
selected by the moderator of this project.  This does not means that
the selected port is the best possible, it means however that the port
is quite good.  Nobody should feel offended by any selection.

Some tools are possibly dangerous if you do not thoroughly understand
their usage (v.g. `rm -r *').  You ought to know what you are doing.
YOU USE THESE TOOLS AT YOUR OWN RISK.  You *were* warned!

FTP ARCHIVE SITES

The collection of programs known as the GNUish MS-DOS project is
available for ftp at the following addresses.  Administrative contacts
and upload directories are listed here for the moderator's convenience.

   vulcan.phyast.pitt.edu [130.49.33.16], in pub/pc/gnudos.

	adm contact: Roberto Gomez <roberto@bondi.phyast.pitt.edu>

SOURCE CODE

Due to space considerations, only the patches relative to the official
GNU source code (with the source code found on prep.ai.mit.edu being
considered "official") and custom-written source code are provided.
In order to re-compile the GNUish MS-DOS project on your computer, you
need to first obtain the official GNU source code.  GNU documentation
(if any) can also be found within the official GNU source code.

The Free Software Foundation has set up an anonymous FTP site for GNU
software on prep.ai.mit.edu [18.71.0.38].  The distributions present
on that machine are considered "official" and are the best ones to use
with the GNUish MS-DOS project.


EXECUTABLE CODE

For convenience, ready-to-execute binaries are also provided for those
who do not have the necessary compilers, or do not feel like using
them.  User documentation is usually not provided, at least for now,
beyond the documentation provided in the official GNU distribution.

	swalib0.zoo	2,3	Swapping library from <td12@ddagsi3.bitnet>
	
	  1	use `zoo x//' to restore sub-directories
	  2	requires Microsoft C compiler at level 6.0
	  3	this is a source library, not a user program
	  4	GNUish, but unofficial or unreleased GNU product
	  5	includes both makeinfo *and* a stand-alone Info reader

For those interested, the filename for each of packages is selected
according to the following pattern:

	<radix><version><release>.zoo

In this syntax, <radix> is a string of three to six characters to
identify the product, v.g. `futil' indicates GNU file utilities.
<version> is a series of one to three digits indicating the version,
v.g. `14' for `1.4', 358 for `3.58' or `0' for non-released yet; the
decimal point is not necessarily implied after the first digit.  In no
case <radix> and <version> altogether could go over seven characters.
The <release> is nothing for the first edition in GNUish MS-DOS
archives, but might be a single letter for subsequent editions, like
`a', `b', `c', etc. in turn.


FUTURE FILES

The following GNU tools have already been ported to DOS, and will be
added later in the GNUish MS-DOS subdirectory:

	bison chess compress ctags gawk perl rcs readline

The following replacement tools could be made available in the GNUish
MS-DOS subdirectory, in the future:

	freemacs or jove	no editor war, please :-)
	ms_sh162		waiting for bash :-)
	uxutl162		only some of them

Work is being done for:

	tar
