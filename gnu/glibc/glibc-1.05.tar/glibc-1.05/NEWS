Version 1.05

* The standard location for the file that says what the local timezone is
  has changed again.  It is now `/usr/local/etc/localtime' (or more
  precisely, `${prefix}/etc/localtime') rather than `/etc/localtime'.

* The distribution no longer contains any files with names longer than 14
  characters.

* `struct ttyent' has two new flag bits: TTY_TRUSTED and TTY_CONSOLE.
  These are set by the new `trusted' and `console' keywords in `/etc/ttys'.

* New functions `ttyslot' and `syslog' from 4.4 BSD.

Version 1.04

* The configuration process has changed quite a bit.  The `configure'
  script is now used just like the configuration scripts for other GNU
  packages.  The `sysdeps' directory hierarchy is much rearranged.
  The file `INSTALL' explains the new scheme in detail.

* The header files no longer need to be processed into ANSI C and
  traditional C versions.  There is just one set of files to install, and
  it will work with ANSI or old C compilers (including `gcc -traditional').

* Brendan Kehoe and Ian Lance Taylor have ported the library to the
  MIPS DECStation running Ultrix 4.

* The Sun 4 startup code (crt0) can now properly load SunOS 4 shared libraries.
  Tom Quinn contributed the initial code.  The GNU C library can NOT yet be
  made itself into a shared library.

* Yet further improved support for the i386, running 4.3 BSD-like systems
  (such as Mach 3 with the Unix single-server), or System V.

* New function `strncasecmp' to do case-insensitive string comparison
  with limited length.

* New function `strsep' is a reentrant alternative to `strtok'.

* New functions `scandir' and `alphasort' for searching directories.

* New function `setenv' is a better interface to `putenv'.

* Ian Lance Taylor has contributed an implementation of the SVID `ftw'
  function for traversing a directory tree.

* The GNU obstack package is now also part of the C library.
  The new function `open_obstack_stream' creates a stdio stream that
  writes onto an obstack; `obstack_printf' and `obstack_vprintf' do
  formatted output directly to an obstack.

* Miscellaneous new functions: reboot, nice, sigaltstack (4.4 BSD only),
  cfmakeraw, getusershell, getpass, swab, getttyent, seteuid, setegid.

* `FNM_FILE_NAME' is another name for `FNM_PATHNAME', used with `fnmatch'.

* The new functions `strfry' and `memfrob' do mysterious and wonderful
  things to your strings.

* There are some new test programs: test-fseek, testmb, and testrand.

* Some work has been done to begin porting the library to 4.4 BSD and Linux.
  These ports are not finished, but are a good starting place for really
  supporting those systems.

* `/etc/localtime' is now the standard location for the file that says what
  the local timezone is, rather than `/usr/local/lib/zoneinfo/localtime'.
  This follows the general principle that `/etc' is the place for all local
  configuration files.

* The C library header files now use `extern "C"' when used by the C++
  compiler, so the C library should now work with C++ code.

* The header file <bstring.h> is gone.  <string.h> now declares bcopy,
  bcmp, bzero, and ffs.  

* Mike Haertel (of GNU e?grep and malloc fame) has written a new sorting
  function which uses the `merge sort' algorithm, and is said to be
  significantly faster than the old GNU `qsort' function.  Merge sort is
  now the standard `qsort' function.  The new algorithm can require a lot
  of temporary storage; so, the old sorting function is called when the
  required storage is not available.

* The C library now includes Michael Glad's Ultra Fast Crypt, which
  provides the Unix `crypt' function, plus some other entry points.
  Because of the United States export restriction on DES implementations,
  we are distributing this code separately from the rest of the C library.
  There is an extra distribution tar file just for crypt; it is called
  `glibc-VERSION-crypt.tar.Z', e.g. `glibc-1.04-crypt.tar.Z'.  You can just
  unpack the crypt distribution along with the rest of the C library and
  build; you can also build the library without getting crypt.  Users
  outside the USA can get the crypt distribution via anonymous FTP from
  ftp.uni-c.dk [129.142.6.74], or another archive site outside the U.S.

* The code and header files taken from 4.4 BSD have been updated with the
  latest files released from Berkeley.
