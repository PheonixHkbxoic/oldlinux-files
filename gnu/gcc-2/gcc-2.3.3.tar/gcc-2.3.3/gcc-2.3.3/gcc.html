<H2> Preamble </H2>
<!--docid::SEC2::-->
<P>

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
</P><P>

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
</P><P>

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
</P><P>

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
</P><P>

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
</P><P>

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
</P><P>

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
</P><P>

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
</P><P>

<center>
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
</center>
</P><P>

<OL>
<LI>
This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<P>

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
</P><P>

<LI>
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
<P>

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
</P><P>

<LI>
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<P>

<OL>
<LI>
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<P>

<LI>
You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.
<P>

<LI>
If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
</OL>
<P>

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
</P><P>

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
</P><P>

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
</P><P>

<LI>
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<P>

<OL>
<LI>
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<P>

<LI>
Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,
<P>

<LI>
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</OL>
<P>

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
</P><P>

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
</P><P>

<LI>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
<P>

<LI>
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.
<P>

<LI>
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
<P>

<LI>
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
<P>

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
</P><P>

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
</P><P>

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
</P><P>

<LI>
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<P>

<LI>
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
<P>

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.
</P><P>

<LI>
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<P>

<center>
 NO WARRANTY
</center>
</P><P>

<LI>
BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<P>

<LI>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

<H2> How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs </H2>
<!--docid::SEC3::-->
<P>

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
</P><P>

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre><VAR>one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.</VAR>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
</P><P>

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19<VAR>yy</VAR> <VAR>name of author</VAR>

type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The hypothetical commands <SAMP>`show w'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`show c'</SAMP> should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than <SAMP>`show w'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`show c'</SAMP>; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
suits your program.
</P><P>

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

<H1> 1. Protect Your Freedom--Fight "Look And Feel" </H1>
<!--docid::SEC5::-->
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>This section is a political message from the League for Programming
Freedom to the users of GNU CC.  It is included here as an expression
of support for the League on the part of the Free Software Foundation.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Apple and Lotus are trying to create a new form of legal monopoly: a
copyright on a class of user interfaces.  These monopolies would cause
serious problems for users and developers of computer software and
systems.  Xerox, too, has tried to make a monopoly for itself on window
systems; their suit against Apple was thrown out on a technicality, but
Xerox has not said anything to indicate it wouldn't try again.
</P><P>

Until a few years ago, the law seemed clear: no one could restrict
others from using a user interface; programmers were free to implement
any interface they chose.  Imitating interfaces, sometimes with changes,
was standard practice in the computer field.  The interfaces we know
evolved gradually in this way; for example, the Macintosh user interface
drew ideas from the Xerox interface, which in turn drew on work done at
Stanford and SRI.  1-2-3 imitated VisiCalc, and dBase imitated a
database program from JPL.
</P><P>

Most computer companies, and nearly all computer users, were happy with
this state of affairs.  The companies that are suing say it does not
offer "enough incentive" to develop their products, but they must have
considered it "enough" when they made their decision to do so.  It
seems they are not satisfied with the opportunity to continue to compete
in the marketplace--not even with a head start.
</P><P>

If companies like Xerox, Lotus, and Apple are permitted to make law
through the courts, the precedent will hobble the software industry:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
Gratuitous incompatibilities will burden users.  Imagine if each
car manufacturer had to arrange the pedals in a different order.
<P>

<LI>
Software will become and remain more expensive.  Users will be
"locked in" to proprietary interfaces, for which there is no real
competition.
<P>

<LI>
Large companies have an unfair advantage wherever lawsuits become
commonplace.  Since they can easily afford to sue, they can intimidate
small companies with threats even when they don't really have a case.
<P>

<LI>
User interface improvements will come slower, since incremental
evolution through creative imitation will no longer be permitted.
<P>

<LI>
Even Apple, etc., will find it harder to make improvements if
they can no longer adapt the good ideas that others introduce, for
fear of weakening their own legal positions.  Some users suggest that
this stagnation may already have started.
<P>

<LI>
If you use GNU software, you might find it of some concern that user
interface copyright will make it hard for the Free Software Foundation
to develop programs compatible with the interfaces that you already
know.
</UL>
<P>

To protect our freedom from lawsuits like these, a group of programmers
and users have formed a new grass-roots political organization, the
League for Programming Freedom.
</P><P>

The purpose of the League is to oppose new monopolistic practices such
as user-interface copyright and software patents; it calls for a return
to the legal policies of the recent past, in which these practices were
not allowed.  The League is not concerned with free software as an
issue, and not affiliated with the Free Software Foundation.
</P><P>

The League's membership rolls include John McCarthy, inventor of Lisp,
Marvin Minsky, founder of the Artificial Intelligence lab, Guy L.
Steele, Jr., author of well-known books on Lisp and C, as well as
Richard Stallman, the developer of GNU CC.  Please join and add your
name to the list.  Membership dues in the League are $42 per year for
programmers, managers and professionals; $10.50 for students; $21 for
others.
</P><P>

The League needs both activist members and members who only pay their
dues.

from the defendants they are suing.

Port your existing software to competing systems, so that you encourage
users to switch.

Write letters to company presidents to let them know their conduct
is unacceptable.

Tell your friends and colleagues about this issue and how it threatens
to ruin the computer industry.
<P>

Above all, don't work for the look-and-feel plaintiffs, and don't
accept contracts from them.

<H1> 2. GNU CC Command Options </H1>
<!--docid::SEC6::-->
<P>

When you invoke GNU CC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The "overall options" allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP> option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.
</P><P>

Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX2"></A>
<A NAME="IDX3"></A>
The <CODE>gcc</CODE> program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multiletter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may <EM>not</EM> be grouped: <SAMP>`-dr'</SAMP> is very different from <SAMP>`-d
-r'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several options
of the same kind; for example, if you specify <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> more than once,
the directories are searched in the order specified.
</P><P>

Many options have long names starting with <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> or with
<SAMP>`-W'</SAMP>---for example, <SAMP>`-fforce-mem'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-fstrength-reduce'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-Wformat'</SAMP> and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
<SAMP>`-ffoo'</SAMP> would be <SAMP>`-fno-foo'</SAMP>.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.

<!--docid::SEC8::-->
<P>

Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  The first three
stages apply to an individual source file, and end by producing an
object file; linking combines all the object files (those newly
compiled, and those specified as input) into an executable file.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX6"></A>
For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE><VAR>file</VAR>.c</CODE>
<DD>C source code which must be preprocessed.
<P>

<DT><CODE><VAR>file</VAR>.i</CODE>
<DD>C source code which should not be preprocessed.
<P>

<DT><CODE><VAR>file</VAR>.ii</CODE>
<DD>C++ source code which should not be preprocessed.
<P>

<DT><CODE><VAR>file</VAR>.m</CODE>
<DD>Objective-C source code.  Note that you must link with the library
<TT>`libobjc.a'</TT> to make an Objective-C program work.
<P>

<DT><CODE><VAR>file</VAR>.h</CODE>
<DD>C header file (not to be compiled or linked).
<P>

<DT><CODE><VAR>file</VAR>.cc</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE><VAR>file</VAR>.cxx</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE><VAR>file</VAR>.C</CODE>
<DD>C++ source code which must be preprocessed.
<P>

<DT><CODE><VAR>file</VAR>.s</CODE>
<DD>Assembler code.
<P>

<DT><CODE><VAR>file</VAR>.S</CODE>
<DD>Assembler code which must be preprocessed.
<P>

<DT><CODE><VAR>other</VAR></CODE>
<DD>An object file to be fed straight into linking.
Any file name with no recognized suffix is treated this way.
</DL>
<P>

You can specify the input language explicitly with the <SAMP>`-x'</SAMP> option:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-x <VAR>language</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Specify explicitly the <VAR>language</VAR> for the following input files
(rather than choosing a default based on the file name suffix).
This option applies to all following input files until
the next <SAMP>`-x'</SAMP> option.  Possible values of <VAR>language</VAR> are
<SAMP>`c'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`objective-c'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`c-header'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`c++'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`cpp-output'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`assembler'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`assembler-with-cpp'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-x none</CODE>
<DD>Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files are
handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if <SAMP>`-x'</SAMP>
has not been used at all).
</DL>
<P>

If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
<SAMP>`-x'</SAMP> (or filename suffixes) to tell <CODE>gcc</CODE> where to start, and
one of the options <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-S'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> to say where
<CODE>gcc</CODE> is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
<SAMP>`-x cpp-output -E'</SAMP> instruct <CODE>gcc</CODE> to do nothing at all.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-c</CODE>
<DD>Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.
<P>

By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`.i'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`.s'</SAMP>, etc., with <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-S</CODE>
<DD>Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.
<P>

By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
replacing the suffix <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`.i'</SAMP>, etc., with <SAMP>`.s'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-E</CODE>
<DD>Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The
output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
standard output.
<P>

Input files which don't require preprocessing are ignored.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX7"></A>
<DT><CODE>-o <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Place output in file <VAR>file</VAR>.  This applies regardless to whatever
sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.
<P>

Since only one output file can be specified, it does not make sense to
use <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> when compiling more than one input file, unless you are
producing an executable file as output.
</P><P>

If <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> is not specified, the default is to put an executable file
in <TT>`a.out'</TT>, the object file for <TT>`<VAR>source</VAR>.<VAR>suffix</VAR>'</TT> in
<TT>`<VAR>source</VAR>.o'</TT>, its assembler file in <TT>`<VAR>source</VAR>.s'</TT>, and
all preprocessed C source on standard output.</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-v</CODE>
<DD>Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages
of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver
program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-pipe</CODE>
<DD>Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems where
the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the GNU assembler has
no trouble.

<H2> 2.3 Options Controlling Dialect </H2>
<!--docid::SEC9::-->
<P>

The following options control the dialect of C or C++ that the compiler
accepts:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>
<DT><CODE>-ansi</CODE>
<DD>Support all ANSI standard C programs.
<P>

This turns off certain features of GNU C that are incompatible with ANSI
C, such as the <CODE>asm</CODE>, <CODE>inline</CODE> and <CODE>typeof</CODE> keywords, and
predefined macros such as <CODE>unix</CODE> and <CODE>vax</CODE> that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used ANSI trigraph feature, and disallows <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> as part of
identifiers.
</P><P>

The alternate keywords <CODE>__asm__</CODE>, <CODE>__extension__</CODE>,
<CODE>__inline__</CODE> and <CODE>__typeof__</CODE> continue to work despite
<SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP>.  You would not want to use them in an ANSI C program, of
course, but it useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP>.  Alternate predefined macros
such as <CODE>__unix__</CODE> and <CODE>__vax__</CODE> are also available, with or
without <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

The <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> option does not cause non-ANSI programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> is required in
addition to <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP>.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC10">2.4 Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</A>.
</P><P>

The macro <CODE>__STRICT_ANSI__</CODE> is predefined when the <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP>
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
ANSI standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.
</P><P>

The functions <CODE>alloca</CODE>, <CODE>abort</CODE>, <CODE>exit</CODE>, and
<CODE>_exit</CODE> are not builtin functions when <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> is used.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fall-virtual</CODE>
<DD>Treat certain member functions as virtual, implicitly (C++ only).  This
applies to all member functions declared in the same class with a
"method-call" operator method (except for constructor functions and
<CODE>new</CODE> or <CODE>delete</CODE> member operators).  In effect, all of these
methods become "implicitly virtual."
<P>

This does not mean that all calls to these methods will be made through
the internal table of virtual functions.  There are some circumstances
under which it is obvious that a call to a given virtual function can be
made directly, and in these cases the calls still go direct.
</P><P>

The effect of making all methods of a class with a declared
<SAMP>`operator-&#62;()()'</SAMP> implicitly virtual using <SAMP>`-fall-virtual'</SAMP>
extends also to all non-constructor methods of any class derived from
such a class.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fdollars-in-identifiers</CODE>
<DD>Permit the use of <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> in identifiers (C++ only).  You can also use
<SAMP>`-fno-dollars-in-identifiers'</SAMP> to explicitly prohibit use of
<SAMP>`$'</SAMP>.  (GNU C++ allows <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> by default on some target systems
but not others.)
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fenum-int-equiv</CODE>
<DD>Permit implicit conversion of <CODE>int</CODE> to enumeration types (C++
only).  Normally GNU C++ allows conversion of <CODE>enum</CODE> to <CODE>int</CODE>,
but not the other way around.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-asm</CODE>
<DD>Do not recognize <CODE>asm</CODE>, <CODE>inline</CODE> or <CODE>typeof</CODE> as a
keyword.  These words may then be used as identifiers.  You can
use <CODE>__asm__</CODE>, <CODE>__inline__</CODE> and <CODE>__typeof__</CODE> instead.
<SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> implies <SAMP>`-fno-asm'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-builtin</CODE>
<DD>Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with two leading
underscores. Currently, the functions affected include <CODE>_exit</CODE>,
<CODE>abort</CODE>, <CODE>abs</CODE>, <CODE>alloca</CODE>, <CODE>cos</CODE>, <CODE>exit</CODE>,
<CODE>fabs</CODE>, <CODE>labs</CODE>, <CODE>memcmp</CODE>, <CODE>memcpy</CODE>, <CODE>sin</CODE>,
<CODE>sqrt</CODE>, <CODE>strcmp</CODE>, <CODE>strcpy</CODE>, and <CODE>strlen</CODE>.
<P>

The <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> option prevents <CODE>alloca</CODE> and <CODE>_exit</CODE> from
being builtin functions.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-strict-prototype</CODE>
<DD>Treat a function declaration with no arguments, such as <SAMP>`int foo
();'</SAMP>, as C would treat it--as saying nothing about the number of
arguments or their types (C++ only).  Normally, such a declaration in
C++ means that the function <CODE>foo</CODE> takes no arguments.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fthis-is-variable</CODE>
<DD>Permit assignment to <CODE>this</CODE> (C++ only).  The incorporation of
user-defined free store management into C++ has made assignment to
<SAMP>`this'</SAMP> an anachronism.  Therefore, by default it is invalid to
assign to <CODE>this</CODE> within a class member function.  However, for
backwards compatibility, you can make it valid with
<SAMP>`-fthis-is-variable'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-trigraphs</CODE>
<DD>Support ANSI C trigraphs.  You don't want to know about this
brain-damage.  The <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> option implies <SAMP>`-trigraphs'</SAMP>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
<DT><CODE>-traditional</CODE>
<DD>Attempt to support some aspects of traditional C compilers.
Specifically:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>
All <CODE>extern</CODE> declarations take effect globally even if they
are written inside of a function definition.  This includes implicit
declarations of functions.
<P>

<LI>
The keywords <CODE>typeof</CODE>, <CODE>inline</CODE>, <CODE>signed</CODE>, <CODE>const</CODE>
and <CODE>volatile</CODE> are not recognized.  (You can still use the
alternative keywords such as <CODE>__typeof__</CODE>, <CODE>__inline__</CODE>, and
so on.)
<P>

<LI>
Comparisons between pointers and integers are always allowed.
<P>

<LI>
Integer types <CODE>unsigned short</CODE> and <CODE>unsigned char</CODE> promote
to <CODE>unsigned int</CODE>.
<P>

<LI>
Out-of-range floating point literals are not an error.
<P>

<LI>
String "constants" are not necessarily constant; they are stored in
writable space, and identical looking constants are allocated
separately.  (This is the same as the effect of
<SAMP>`-fwritable-strings'</SAMP>.)
<P>

<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
<LI>
All automatic variables not declared <CODE>register</CODE> are preserved by
<CODE>longjmp</CODE>.  Ordinarily, GNU C follows ANSI C: automatic variables
not declared <CODE>volatile</CODE> may be clobbered.
<P>

<LI>
In the preprocessor, comments convert to nothing at all, rather than
to a space.  This allows traditional token concatenation.
<P>

<LI>
In the preprocessor, macro arguments are recognized within string
constants in a macro definition (and their values are stringified,
though without additional quote marks, when they appear in such a
context).  The preprocessor always considers a string constant to end
at a newline.
<P>

<LI>
The predefined macro <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> is not defined when you use
<SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP>, but <CODE>__GNUC__</CODE> is (since the GNU extensions
which <CODE>__GNUC__</CODE> indicates are not affected by
<SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP>).  If you need to write header files that work
differently depending on whether <SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP> is in use, by
testing both of these predefined macros you can distinguish four
situations: GNU C, traditional GNU C, other ANSI C compilers, and
other old C compilers.
</UL>
<P>

You may wish to use <SAMP>`-fno-builtin'</SAMP> as well as <SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP>
if your program uses names that are normally GNU C builtin functions for
other purposes of its own.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-traditional-cpp</CODE>
<DD>Attempt to support some aspects of traditional C preprocessors.
This includes the last three items in the table immediately above,
but none of the other effects of <SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fcond-mismatch</CODE>
<DD>Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second and
third arguments.  The value of such an expression is void.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-funsigned-char</CODE>
<DD>Let the type <CODE>char</CODE> be unsigned, like <CODE>unsigned char</CODE>.
<P>

Each kind of machine has a default for what <CODE>char</CODE> should
be.  It is either like <CODE>unsigned char</CODE> by default or like
<CODE>signed char</CODE> by default.
</P><P>

Ideally, a portable program should always use <CODE>signed char</CODE> or
<CODE>unsigned char</CODE> when it depends on the signedness of an object.
But many programs have been written to use plain <CODE>char</CODE> and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.
</P><P>

The type <CODE>char</CODE> is always a distinct type from each of
<CODE>signed char</CODE> or <CODE>unsigned char</CODE>, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fsigned-char</CODE>
<DD>Let the type <CODE>char</CODE> be signed, like <CODE>signed char</CODE>.
<P>

Note that this is equivalent to <SAMP>`-fno-unsigned-char'</SAMP>, which is
the negative form of <SAMP>`-funsigned-char'</SAMP>.  Likewise,
<SAMP>`-fno-signed-char'</SAMP> is equivalent to <SAMP>`-funsigned-char'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fsigned-bitfields</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-funsigned-bitfields</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-fno-signed-bitfields</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-fno-unsigned-bitfields</CODE>
<DD>These options control whether a bitfield is signed or unsigned, when the
declaration does not use either <CODE>signed</CODE> or <CODE>unsigned</CODE>.  By
default, such a bitfield is signed, because this is consistent: the
basic integer types such as <CODE>int</CODE> are signed types.
<P>

However, when <SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP> is used, bitfields are all unsigned
no matter what.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fwritable-strings</CODE>
<DD>Store string constants in the writable data segment and don't uniquize
them.  This is for compatibility with old programs which assume they
can write into string constants.  <SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP> also has this
effect.
<P>

Writing into string constants is a very bad idea; "constants" should
be constant.

<H2> 2.4 Options to Request or Suppress Warnings </H2>
<!--docid::SEC10::-->
<P>

Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which
are not inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.
</P><P>

You can request many specific warnings with options beginning <SAMP>`-W'</SAMP>,
for example <SAMP>`-Wimplicit'</SAMP> to request warnings on implicit
declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also has a
negative form beginning <SAMP>`-Wno-'</SAMP> to turn off warnings;
for example, <SAMP>`-Wno-implicit'</SAMP>.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.
</P><P>

These options control the amount and kinds of warnings produced by GNU
CC:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
<DT><CODE>-fsyntax-only</CODE>
<DD>Check the code for syntax errors, but don't emit any output.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-w</CODE>
<DD>Inhibit all warning messages.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wno-import</CODE>
<DD>Inhibit warning messages about the use of <SAMP>`#import'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-pedantic</CODE>
<DD>Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ANSI standard C; reject
all programs that use forbidden extensions.  
<P>

Valid ANSI standard C programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few will require <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP>).  However,
without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C features
are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with <SAMP>`__'</SAMP>.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
<CODE>__extension__</CODE>.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC78">4.30 Alternate Keywords</A>.
</P><P>

This option is not intended to be <I>useful</I>; it exists only to satisfy
pedants who would otherwise claim that GNU CC fails to support the ANSI
standard.
</P><P>

Some users try to use <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> to check programs for strict ANSI
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ANSI practices, but not all--only those for which
ANSI C <EM>requires</EM> a diagnostic.
</P><P>

A feature to report any failure to conform to ANSI C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP>.  We recommend, rather, that
users take advantage of the extensions of GNU C and disregard the
limitations of other compilers.  Aside from certain supercomputers and
obsolete small machines, there is less and less reason ever to use any
other C compiler other than for bootstrapping GNU CC.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-pedantic-errors</CODE>
<DD>Like <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP>, except that errors are produced rather than
warnings.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-W</CODE>
<DD>Print extra warning messages for these events:
<P>

<UL>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
<LI>
A nonvolatile automatic variable might be changed by a call to
<CODE>longjmp</CODE>.  These warnings as well are possible only in
optimizing compilation.
<P>

The compiler sees only the calls to <CODE>setjmp</CODE>.  It cannot know
where <CODE>longjmp</CODE> will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because <CODE>longjmp</CODE> cannot
in fact be called at the place which would cause a problem.
</P><P>

<LI>
A function can return either with or without a value.  (Falling
off the end of the function body is considered returning without
a value.)  For example, this function would evoke such a
warning:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>foo (a)
{
  if (a &#62; 0)
    return a;
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<LI>
An expression-statement contains no side effects.
<P>

<LI>
An unsigned value is compared against zero with <SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`&#60;='</SAMP>.
<P>

<LI>
A comparison like <SAMP>`x&#60;=y&#60;=z'</SAMP> appears; this is equivalent to
<SAMP>`(x&#60;=y ? 1 : 0) &#60;= z'</SAMP>, which is a different interpretation from
that of ordinary mathematical notation.
<P>

<LI>
Storage-class specifiers like <CODE>static</CODE> are not the first things in
a declaration.  According to the C Standard, this usage is obsolescent.
<P>

<LI>
An aggregate has a partly bracketed initializer.
For example, the following code would evoke such a warning,
because braces are missing around the initializer for <CODE>x.h</CODE>:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>struct s { int f, g; };
struct t { struct s h; int i; };
struct t x = { 1, 2, 3 };
</pre></td></tr></table></UL>
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wenum-clash</CODE>
<DD>Warn about conversion between different enumeration types (C++ only).
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wimplicit</CODE>
<DD>Warn whenever a function or parameter is implicitly declared.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wreturn-type</CODE>
<DD>Warn whenever a function is defined with a return-type that defaults
to <CODE>int</CODE>.  Also warn about any <CODE>return</CODE> statement with no
return-value in a function whose return-type is not <CODE>void</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wunused</CODE>
<DD>Warn whenever a local variable is unused aside from its declaration,
whenever a function is declared static but never defined, and whenever
a statement computes a result that is explicitly not used.
<P>

If you want to prevent a warning for a particular variable, you can use
this macro:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define USE(var) \
  static void * use_##var = (&#38;use_##var, (void *) &#38;var)

USE (string);
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wswitch</CODE>
<DD>Warn whenever a <CODE>switch</CODE> statement has an index of enumeral type
and lacks a <CODE>case</CODE> for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  (The presence of a <CODE>default</CODE> label prevents this
warning.)  <CODE>case</CODE> labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wcomment</CODE>
<DD>Warn whenever a comment-start sequence <SAMP>`/*'</SAMP> appears in a comment.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wtrigraphs</CODE>
<DD>Warn if any trigraphs are encountered (assuming they are enabled).
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wformat</CODE>
<DD>Check calls to <CODE>printf</CODE> and <CODE>scanf</CODE>, etc., to make sure that
the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
specified.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wchar-subscripts</CODE>
<DD>Warn if an array subscript has type <CODE>char</CODE>.  This is a common cause
of error, as programmers often forget that this type is signed on some
machines.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wuninitialized</CODE>
<DD>An automatic variable is used without first being initialized.
<P>

These warnings are possible only in optimizing compilation,
because they require data flow information that is computed only
when optimizing.  If you don't specify <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>, you simply won't
get these warnings.
</P><P>

These warnings occur only for variables that are candidates for
register allocation.  Therefore, they do not occur for a variable that
is declared <CODE>volatile</CODE>, or whose address is taken, or whose size
is other than 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.  Also, they do not occur for
structures, unions or arrays, even when they are in registers.
</P><P>

Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.
</P><P>

These warnings are made optional because GNU CC is not smart
enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
despite appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
this can happen:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>{
  int x;
  switch (y)
    {
    case 1: x = 1;
      break;
    case 2: x = 4;
      break;
    case 3: x = 5;
    }
  foo (x);
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If the value of <CODE>y</CODE> is always 1, 2 or 3, then <CODE>x</CODE> is
always initialized, but GNU CC doesn't know this.  Here is
another common case:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>{
  int save_y;
  if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
  <small>...</small>
  if (change_y) y = save_y;
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This has no bug because <CODE>save_y</CODE> is used only if it is set.
</P><P>

Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare as
<CODE>volatile</CODE> all the functions you use that never return.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC66">4.20 Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wparentheses</CODE>
<DD>Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wall</CODE>
<DD>All of the above <SAMP>`-W'</SAMP> options combined.  These are all the
options which pertain to usage that we recommend avoiding and that we
believe is easy to avoid, even in conjunction with macros.
</DL>
<P>

The remaining <SAMP>`-W<small>...</small>'</SAMP> options are not implied by <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP>
because they warn about constructions that we consider reasonable to
use, on occasion, in clean programs.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-Wtraditional</CODE>
<DD>Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
ANSI C.
<P>

<UL>
<LI>
Macro arguments occurring within string constants in the macro body.
These would substitute the argument in traditional C, but are part of
the constant in ANSI C.
<P>

<LI>
A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.
<P>

<LI>
A <CODE>switch</CODE> statement has an operand of type <CODE>long</CODE>.
</UL>
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wshadow</CODE>
<DD>Warn whenever a local variable shadows another local variable.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wid-clash-<VAR>len</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Warn whenever two distinct identifiers match in the first <VAR>len</VAR>
characters.  This may help you prepare a program that will compile
with certain obsolete, brain-damaged compilers.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wpointer-arith</CODE>
<DD>Warn about anything that depends on the "size of" a function type or
of <CODE>void</CODE>.  GNU C assigns these types a size of 1, for
convenience in calculations with <CODE>void *</CODE> pointers and pointers
to functions.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wcast-qual</CODE>
<DD>Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier from
the target type.  For example, warn if a <CODE>const char *</CODE> is cast
to an ordinary <CODE>char *</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wcast-align</CODE>
<DD>Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment of the
target is increased.  For example, warn if a <CODE>char *</CODE> is cast to
an <CODE>int *</CODE> on machines where integers can only be accessed at
two- or four-byte boundaries.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wwrite-strings</CODE>
<DD>Give string constants the type <CODE>const char[<VAR>length</VAR>]</CODE> so that
copying the address of one into a non-<CODE>const</CODE> <CODE>char *</CODE>
pointer will get a warning.  These warnings will help you find at
compile time code that can try to write into a string constant, but
only if you have been very careful about using <CODE>const</CODE> in
declarations and prototypes.  Otherwise, it will just be a nuisance;
this is why we did not make <SAMP>`-Wall'</SAMP> request these warnings.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wconversion</CODE>
<DD>Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from what
would happen to the same argument in the absence of a prototype.  This
includes conversions of fixed point to floating and vice versa, and
conversions changing the width or signedness of a fixed point argument
except when the same as the default promotion.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Waggregate-return</CODE>
<DD>Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined or
called.  (In languages where you can return an array, this also elicits
a warning.)
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wstrict-prototypes</CODE>
<DD>Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the
argument types.  (An old-style function definition is permitted without
a warning if preceded by a declaration which specifies the argument
types.)
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wmissing-prototypes</CODE>
<DD>Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself
provides a prototype.  The aim is to detect global functions that fail
to be declared in header files.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wredundant-decls</CODE>
<DD>Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope, even in
cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes nothing.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Wnested-externs</CODE>
<DD>Warn if an <CODE>extern</CODE> declaration is encountered within an function.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Winline</CODE>
<DD>Warn if a function can not be inlined, and either it was declared as inline,
or else the <SAMP>`-finline-functions'</SAMP> option was given.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Werror</CODE>
<DD>Make all warnings into errors.

<H2> 2.5 Options for Debugging Your Program or GNU CC </H2>
<!--docid::SEC11::-->
<P>

GNU CC has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or GCC:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-g</CODE>
<DD>Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF).  GDB can work with this debugging
information.
<P>

On most systems that use stabs format, <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> enables use of extra
debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information
makes debugging work better in GDB but will probably make other debuggers
crash or
refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
to generate the extra information, use <SAMP>`-gstabs+'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-gstabs'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-gxcoff+'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-gxcoff'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-gdwarf+'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`-gdwarf'</SAMP>
(see below).
</P><P>

Unlike most other C compilers, GNU CC allows you to use <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> with
<SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values were already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they were moved out of loops.
</P><P>

Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.
</P><P>

The following options are useful when GNU CC is generated with the
capability for more than one debugging format.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-ggdb</CODE>
<DD>Produce debugging information in the native format (if that is supported),
including GDB extensions if at all possible.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-gstabs</CODE>
<DD>Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
without GDB extensions.  This is the format used by DBX on most BSD
systems.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-gstabs+</CODE>
<DD>Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-gcoff</CODE>
<DD>Produce debugging information in COFF format (if that is supported).
This is the format used by SDB on most System V systems prior to
System V Release 4.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-gxcoff</CODE>
<DD>Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported).
This is the format used by the DBX debugger on IBM RS/6000 systems.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-gxcoff+</CODE>
<DD>Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported),
using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-gdwarf</CODE>
<DD>Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is supported).
This is the format used by SDB on most System V Release 4 systems.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-gdwarf+</CODE>
<DD>Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is supported),
using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-g<VAR>level</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-ggdb<VAR>level</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-gstabs<VAR>level</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-gcoff<VAR>level</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-gxcoff<VAR>level</VAR></CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-gdwarf<VAR>level</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Request debugging information and also use <VAR>level</VAR> to specify how
much information.  The default level is 2.
<P>

Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, but no information
about local variables and no line numbers.
</P><P>

Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use <SAMP>`-g3'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<DT><CODE>-p</CODE>
<DD>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <CODE>prof</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
<DT><CODE>-pg</CODE>
<DD>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <CODE>gprof</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
<DT><CODE>-a</CODE>
<DD>Generate extra code to write profile information for basic blocks,
which will record the number of times each basic block is executed.
This data could be analyzed by a program like <CODE>tcov</CODE>.  Note,
however, that the format of the data is not what <CODE>tcov</CODE> expects.
Eventually GNU <CODE>gprof</CODE> should be extended to process this data.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-d<VAR>letters</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified by
<VAR>letters</VAR>.  This is used for debugging the compiler.  The file names
for most of the dumps are made by appending a word to the source file
name (e.g.  <TT>`foo.c.rtl'</TT> or <TT>`foo.c.jump'</TT>).  Here are the
possible letters for use in <VAR>letters</VAR>, and their meanings:
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`M'</SAMP>
<DD>Dump all macro definitions, at the end of preprocessing, and write no
output.
<DT><SAMP>`N'</SAMP>
<DD>Dump all macro names, at the end of preprocessing.
<DT><SAMP>`D'</SAMP>
<DD>Dump all macro definitions, at the end of preprocessing, in addition to
normal output.
<DT><SAMP>`y'</SAMP>
<DD>Dump debugging information during parsing, to standard error.
<DT><SAMP>`r'</SAMP>
<DD>Dump after RTL generation, to <TT>`<VAR>file</VAR>.rtl'</TT>.
<DT><SAMP>`x'</SAMP>
<DD>Just generate RTL for a function instead of compiling it.  Usually used
with <SAMP>`r'</SAMP>.
<DT><SAMP>`j'</SAMP>
<DD>Dump after first jump optimization, to <TT>`<VAR>file</VAR>.jump'</TT>.
<DT><SAMP>`s'</SAMP>
<DD>Dump after CSE (including the jump optimization that sometimes
follows CSE), to <TT>`<VAR>file</VAR>.cse'</TT>.
<DT><SAMP>`L'</SAMP>
<DD>Dump after loop optimization, to <TT>`<VAR>file</VAR>.loop'</TT>.
<DT><SAMP>`t'</SAMP>
<DD>Dump after the second CSE pass (including the jump optimization that
sometimes follows CSE), to <TT>`<VAR>file</VAR>.cse2'</TT>.
<DT><SAMP>`f'</SAMP>
<DD>Dump after flow analysis, to <TT>`<VAR>file</VAR>.flow'</TT>.
<DT><SAMP>`c'</SAMP>
<DD>Dump after instruction combination, to <TT>`<VAR>file</VAR>.combine'</TT>.
<DT><SAMP>`S'</SAMP>

<H2> 2.6 Options That Control Optimization </H2>
<!--docid::SEC12::-->
<P>

These options control various sorts of optimizations:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-O</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-O1</CODE>
<DD>Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.
<P>

Without <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>, the compiler's goal is to reduce the cost of
compilation and to make debugging produce the expected results.
Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a breakpoint
between statements, you can then assign a new value to any variable or
change the program counter to any other statement in the function and
get exactly the results you would expect from the source code.
</P><P>

Without <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>, only variables declared <CODE>register</CODE> are
allocated in registers.  The resulting compiled code is a little worse
than produced by PCC without <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

With <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time.
</P><P>

When <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> is specified, <SAMP>`-fthread-jumps'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`-fdelayed-branch'</SAMP> are turned on.  On some machines other
flags may also be turned on.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-O2</CODE>
<DD>Optimize even more.  Nearly all supported optimizations that do not
involve a space-speed tradeoff are performed.  As compared to <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>,
this option increases both compilation time and the performance of the
generated code.
<P>

<SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP> turns on all <SAMP>`-f<VAR>flag</VAR>'</SAMP> options that enable more
optimization, except for <SAMP>`-funroll-loops'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-funroll-all-loops'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-fomit-frame-pointer'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-O0</CODE>
<DD>Do not optimize.
<P>

If you use multiple <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective.
</DL>
<P>

Options of the form <SAMP>`-f<VAR>flag</VAR>'</SAMP> specify machine-independent
flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
form of <SAMP>`-ffoo'</SAMP> would be <SAMP>`-fno-foo'</SAMP>.  In the table below,
only one of the forms is listed--the one which is not the default.
You can figure out the other form by either removing <SAMP>`no-'</SAMP> or
adding it.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-ffloat-store</CODE>
<DD>Do not store floating point variables in registers, and inhibit other
options that might change whether a floating point value is taken from a
register or memory.
<P>

This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as
the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a <CODE>double</CODE> is supposed to have.  For most programs,
the excess precision does only good, but a few programs rely on the
precise definition of IEEE floating point.  Use <SAMP>`-ffloat-store'</SAMP> for
such programs.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-defer-pop</CODE>
<DD>Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that function
returns.  For machines which must pop arguments after a function call,
the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on the stack for several
function calls and pops them all at once.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fforce-mem</CODE>
<DD>Force memory operands to be copied into registers before doing
arithmetic on them.  This may produce better code by making all
memory references potential common subexpressions.  When they are
not common subexpressions, instruction combination should
eliminate the separate register-load.  I am interested in hearing
about the difference this makes.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fforce-addr</CODE>
<DD>Force memory address constants to be copied into registers before
doing arithmetic on them.  This may produce better code just as
<SAMP>`-fforce-mem'</SAMP> may.  I am interested in hearing about the
difference this makes.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fomit-frame-pointer</CODE>
<DD>Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
in many functions.  <STRONG>It also makes debugging impossible on
some machines.</STRONG>
<P>

On some machines, such as the Vax, this flag has no effect, because
the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame pointer
and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
machine-description macro <CODE>FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED</CODE> controls
whether a target machine supports this flag.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC154">14.5 Register Usage</A>.</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-inline</CODE>
<DD>Don't pay attention to the <CODE>inline</CODE> keyword.  Normally this option
is used to keep the compiler from expanding any functions inline.
Note that if you are not optimizing, no functions can be expanded inline.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-finline-functions</CODE>
<DD>Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth
integrating in this way.
<P>

If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function is
declared <CODE>static</CODE>, then the function is normally not output as
assembler code in its own right.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fkeep-inline-functions</CODE>
<DD>Even if all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function
is declared <CODE>static</CODE>, nevertheless output a separate run-time
callable version of the function.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-default-inline</CODE>
<DD>Don't make member functions inline by default merely because they are
defined inside the class scope (C++ only).
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-function-cse</CODE>
<DD>Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that
calls a constant function contain the function's address explicitly.
<P>

This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
that alter the assembler output may be confused by the optimizations
performed when this option is not used.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-ffast-math</CODE>
<DD>This option allows GCC to violate some ANSI or IEEE rules/specifications
in the interest of optimizing code for speed.  For example, it allows
the compiler to assume arguments to the <CODE>sqrt</CODE> function are 
non-negative numbers.  
<P>

This option should never be turned on by any <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> option since 
it can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on 
an exact implementation of IEEE or ANSI rules/specifications for
math functions.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-felide-constructors</CODE>
<DD>Elide constructors when this seems plausible (C++ only).  With this
option, GNU C++ initializes <CODE>y</CODE> directly from the call to <CODE>foo</CODE>
without going through a temporary in the following code:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>A foo ();
A y = foo ();
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Without this option, GNU C++ first initializes <CODE>y</CODE> by calling the
appropriate constructor for type <CODE>A</CODE>; then assigns the result of
<CODE>foo</CODE> to a temporary; and, finally, replaces the initial value of
<CODE>y</CODE> with the temporary.
</P><P>

The default behavior (<SAMP>`-fno-elide-constructors'</SAMP>) is specified by
the draft ANSI C++ standard.  If your program's constructors have side
effects, <SAMP>`-felide-constructors'</SAMP> can change your program's behavior,
since some constructor calls may be omitted.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fmemoize-lookups</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-fsave-memoized</CODE>
<DD>Use heuristics to compile faster (C++ only).  These heuristics are not
enabled by default, since they are only effective for certain input
files.  Other input files compile more slowly.
<P>

The first time the compiler must build a call to a member function (or
reference to a data member), it must (1) determine whether the class
implements member functions of that name; (2) resolve which member
function to call (which involves figuring out what sorts of type
conversions need to be made); and (3) check the visibility of the member
function to the caller.  All of this adds up to slower compilation.
Normally, the second time a call is made to that member function (or
reference to that data member), it must go through the same lengthy
process again.  This means that code like this
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>cout &#60;&#60; "This " <&#60; p &#60;&#60; " has " &#60;&#60; n &#60;&#60; " legs.\n";
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

makes six passes through all three steps.  By using a software cache, a
"hit" significantly reduces this cost.  Unfortunately, using the cache
introduces another layer of mechanisms which must be implemented, and so
incurs its own overhead.  `-fmemoize-lookups' enables the software
cache.
</P><P>

Because access privileges (visibility) to members and member functions
may differ from one function context to the next, G++ may need to flush
the cache.  With the <SAMP>`-fmemoize-lookups'</SAMP> flag, the cache is flushed
after every function that is compiled.  The <SAMP>`-fsave-memoized'</SAMP> flag
enables the same software cache, but when the compiler determines that
the context of the last function compiled would yield the same access
privileges of the next function to compile, it preserves the cache.
This is most helpful when defining many member functions for the same
class: with the exception of member functions which are friends of other
classes, each member function has exactly the same access privileges as
every other, and the cache need not be flushed.
</DL>
<P>

The following options control specific optimizations.  The <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP>
option turns on all of these optimizations except <SAMP>`-funroll-loops'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`-funroll-all-loops'</SAMP>.  The <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> option usually turns on
the <SAMP>`-fthread-jumps'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-fdelayed-branch'</SAMP> options, but
specific machines may change the default optimizations.
</P><P>

You can use the following flags in the rare cases when "fine-tuning"
of optimizations to be performed is desired.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-fstrength-reduce</CODE>
<DD>Perform the optimizations of loop strength reduction and
elimination of iteration variables.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fthread-jumps</CODE>
<DD>Perform optimizations where we check to see if a jump branches to a
location where another comparison subsumed by the first is found.  If
so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of the
second branch or a point immediately following it, depending on whether
the condition is known to be true or false.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fcse-follow-jumps</CODE>
<DD>In common subexpression elimination, scan through jump instructions
when the target of the jump is not reached by any other path.  For
example, when CSE encounters an <CODE>if</CODE> statement with an
<CODE>else</CODE> clause, CSE will follow the jump when the condition
tested is false.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fcse-skip-blocks</CODE>
<DD>This is similar to <SAMP>`-fcse-follow-jumps'</SAMP>, but causes CSE to
follow jumps which conditionally skip over blocks.  When CSE
encounters a simple <CODE>if</CODE> statement with no else clause,
<SAMP>`-fcse-skip-blocks'</SAMP> causes CSE to follow the jump around the
body of the <CODE>if</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-frerun-cse-after-loop</CODE>
<DD>Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop optimizations has been
performed.  
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fexpensive-optimizations</CODE>
<DD>Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively expensive.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fdelayed-branch</CODE>
<DD>If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions
to exploit instruction slots available after delayed branch
instructions.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fschedule-insns</CODE>
<DD>If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions to
eliminate execution stalls due to required data being unavailable.  This
helps machines that have slow floating point or memory load instructions
by allowing other instructions to be issued until the result of the load
or floating point instruction is required.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fschedule-insns2</CODE>
<DD>Similar to <SAMP>`-fschedule-insns'</SAMP>, but requests an additional pass of
instruction scheduling after register allocation has been done.  This is
especially useful on machines with a relatively small number of
registers and where memory load instructions take more than one cycle.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fcaller-saves</CODE>
<DD>Enable values to be allocated in registers that will be clobbered by
function calls, by emitting extra instructions to save and restore the
registers around such calls.  Such allocation is done only when it
seems to result in better code than would otherwise be produced.
<P>

This option is enabled by default on certain machines, usually those
which have no call-preserved registers to use instead.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-funroll-loops</CODE>
<DD>Perform the optimization of loop unrolling.  This is only done for loops
whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time or run time.
<SAMP>`-funroll-loop'</SAMP> implies <SAMP>`-fstrength-reduce'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`-frerun-cse-after-loop'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-funroll-all-loops</CODE>
<DD>Perform the optimization of loop unrolling.  This is done for all loops
and usually makes programs run more slowly.  <SAMP>`-funroll-all-loops'</SAMP>
implies <SAMP>`-fstrength-reduce'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-frerun-cse-after-loop'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-peephole</CODE>
<DD>Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations.

<H2> 2.7 Options Controlling the Preprocessor </H2>
<!--docid::SEC13::-->
<P>

These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.
</P><P>

If you use the <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> option, nothing is done except preprocessing.
Some of these options make sense only together with <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> because
they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual
compilation.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-include <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Process <VAR>file</VAR> as input before processing the regular input file.
In effect, the contents of <VAR>file</VAR> are compiled first.  Any <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`-U'</SAMP> options on the command line are always processed before
<SAMP>`-include <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>, regardless of the order in which they are
written.  All the <SAMP>`-include'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-imacros'</SAMP> options are
processed in the order in which they are written.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-imacros <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Process <VAR>file</VAR> as input, discarding the resulting output, before
processing the regular input file.  Because the output generated from
<VAR>file</VAR> is discarded, the only effect of <SAMP>`-imacros <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>
is to make the macros defined in <VAR>file</VAR> available for use in the
main input.
<P>

Any <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-U'</SAMP> options on the command line are always
processed before <SAMP>`-imacros <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP>, regardless of the order in
which they are written.  All the <SAMP>`-include'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-imacros'</SAMP>
options are processed in the order in which they are written.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-nostdinc</CODE>
<DD>Do not search the standard system directories for header files.  Only
the directories you have specified with <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> options (and the
current directory, if appropriate) are searched.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC16">2.10 Options for Directory Search</A>, for information on <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP>.
<P>

By using both <SAMP>`-nostdinc'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP>, you can limit the include-file
search path to only those directories you specify explicitly.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-nostdinc++</CODE>
<DD>Do not search for header files in the C++-specific standard directories,
but do still search the other standard directories.
(This option is used when building <SAMP>`libg++'</SAMP>.)
<P>

<DT><CODE>-undef</CODE>
<DD>Do not predefine any nonstandard macros.  (Including architecture flags).
<P>

<DT><CODE>-E</CODE>
<DD>Run only the C preprocessor.  Preprocess all the C source files
specified and output the results to standard output or to the
specified output file.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-C</CODE>
<DD>Tell the preprocessor not to discard comments.  Used with the
<SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> option.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-P</CODE>
<DD>Tell the preprocessor not to generate <SAMP>`#line'</SAMP> commands.
Used with the <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP> option.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
<A NAME="IDX18"></A>
<DT><CODE>-M</CODE>
<DD>Tell the preprocessor to output a rule suitable for <CODE>make</CODE>
describing the dependencies of each object file.  For each source file,
the preprocessor outputs one <CODE>make</CODE>-rule whose target is the object
file name for that source file and whose dependencies are all the files
<SAMP>`#include'</SAMP>d in it.  This rule may be a single line or may be
continued with <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>-newline if it is long.  The list of rules is
printed on standard output instead of the preprocessed C program.
<P>

<SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> implies <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

Another way to specify output of a <CODE>make</CODE> rule is by setting
the environment variable <CODE>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC34">2.14 Environment Variables Affecting GNU CC</A>).
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-MM</CODE>
<DD>Like <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> but the output mentions only the user header files
included with <SAMP>`#include "<VAR>file</VAR>"'</SAMP>.  System header files
included with <SAMP>`#include &#60;<VAR>file</VAR>&#62;'</SAMP> are omitted.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-MD</CODE>
<DD>Like <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> but the dependency information is written to files with
names made by replacing <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> with <SAMP>`.d'</SAMP> at the end of the
output file names.  This is in addition to compiling the input files as
specified---<SAMP>`-MD'</SAMP> does not inhibit ordinary compilation the way
<SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> does.
<P>

The Mach utility <SAMP>`md'</SAMP> can be used to merge the <SAMP>`.d'</SAMP> files
into a single dependency file suitable for using with the <SAMP>`make'</SAMP>
command.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-MMD</CODE>
<DD>Like <SAMP>`-MD'</SAMP> except mention only user header files, not system
header files.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-H</CODE>
<DD>Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other normal
activities.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-A<VAR>question</VAR>(<VAR>answer</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Assert the answer <VAR>answer</VAR> for <VAR>question</VAR>, in case it is tested
with a preprocessor conditional such as <SAMP>`#if
#<VAR>question</VAR>(<VAR>answer</VAR>)'</SAMP>.  <SAMP>`-A-'</SAMP> disables the standard
assertions that normally describe the target machine.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-D<VAR>macro</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Define macro <VAR>macro</VAR> with the string <SAMP>`1'</SAMP> as its definition.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-D<VAR>macro</VAR>=<VAR>defn</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Define macro <VAR>macro</VAR> as <VAR>defn</VAR>.  All instances of <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> on
the command line are processed before any <SAMP>`-U'</SAMP> options.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-U<VAR>macro</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Undefine macro <VAR>macro</VAR>.  <SAMP>`-U'</SAMP> options are evaluated after all
<SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> options, but before any <SAMP>`-include'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-imacros'</SAMP>
options.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-dM</CODE>
<DD>Tell the preprocessor to output only a list of the macro definitions
that are in effect at the end of preprocessing.  Used with the <SAMP>`-E'</SAMP>
option.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-dD</CODE>
<DD>Tell the preprocessing to pass all macro definitions into the output, in
their proper sequence in the rest of the output.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-dN</CODE>
<DD>Like <SAMP>`-dD'</SAMP> except that the macro arguments and contents are omitted.
Only <SAMP>`#define <VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP> is included in the output.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-trigraphs</CODE>
<DD>Support ANSI C trigraphs.  You don't want to know about this
brain-damage.  The <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> option also has this effect.

<H2> 2.9 Options for Linking </H2>
<!--docid::SEC15::-->
<P>

These options come into play when the compiler links object files into
an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
not doing a link step.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
<DT><CODE><VAR>object-file-name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input
to the linker.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-c</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-S</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-E</CODE>
<DD>If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and
object file names should not be used as arguments.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC8">2.2 Options Controlling the Kind of Output</A>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
<DT><CODE>-l<VAR>library</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Search the library named <VAR>library</VAR> when linking.
<P>

It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the
linker searches processes libraries and object files in the order they
are specified.  Thus, <SAMP>`foo.o -lz bar.o'</SAMP> searches library <SAMP>`z'</SAMP>
after file <TT>`foo.o'</TT> but before <TT>`bar.o'</TT>.  If <TT>`bar.o'</TT> refers
to functions in <SAMP>`z'</SAMP>, those functions may not be loaded.
</P><P>

The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
which is actually a file named <TT>`lib<VAR>library</VAR>.a'</TT>.  The linker
then uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.
</P><P>

The directories searched include several standard system directories
plus any that you specify with <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

Normally the files found this way are library files--archive files
whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive file by
scanning through it for members which define symbols that have so far
been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that is found is an
ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion.  The only
difference between using an <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option and specifying a file name
is that <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> surrounds <VAR>library</VAR> with <SAMP>`lib'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`.a'</SAMP>
and searches several directories.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-lobjc</CODE>
<DD>This special case of the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option is what you need to do when you
link an Objective C program.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-nostdlib</CODE>
<DD>Don't use the standard system libraries and startup files when linking.
Only the files you specify will be passed to the linker.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-static</CODE>
<DD>On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking with the shared
libraries.  On other systems, this
option has no effect.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-shared</CODE>
<DD>Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to
form an executable.  Only a few systems support this option.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-symbolic</CODE>
<DD>Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.  Warn
about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the link editor
option <SAMP>`-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs'</SAMP>).  Only a few systems support
this option.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-Xlinker <VAR>option</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Pass <VAR>option</VAR> as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
supply system-specific linker options which GNU CC does not know how to
recognize.
<P>

If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
<SAMP>`-Xlinker'</SAMP> twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
For example, to pass <SAMP>`-assert definitions'</SAMP>, you must write
<SAMP>`-Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions'</SAMP>.  It does not work to write
<SAMP>`-Xlinker "-assert definitions"'</SAMP>, because this passes the entire
string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-Wl,<VAR>option</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Pass <VAR>option</VAR> as an option to the linker.  If <VAR>option</VAR> contains
commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-u <VAR>symbol</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Pretend the symbol <VAR>symbol</VAR> is undefined, to force linking of
library modules to define it.  You can use <SAMP>`-u'</SAMP> multiple times with
different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.

<H2> 2.10 Options for Directory Search </H2>
<!--docid::SEC16::-->
<P>

These options specify directories to search for header files, for
libraries and for parts of the compiler:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-I<VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Append directory <VAR>dir</VAR> to the list of directories searched for
include files.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-I-</CODE>
<DD>Any directories you specify with <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> options before the <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP>
option are searched only for the case of <SAMP>`#include "<VAR>file</VAR>"'</SAMP>;
they are not searched for <SAMP>`#include &#60;<VAR>file</VAR>&#62;'</SAMP>.
<P>

If additional directories are specified with <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> options after
the <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP>, these directories are searched for all <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP>
directives.  (Ordinarily <EM>all</EM> <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> directories are used
this way.)
</P><P>

In addition, the <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP> option inhibits the use of the current
directory (where the current input file came from) as the first search
directory for <SAMP>`#include "<VAR>file</VAR>"'</SAMP>.  There is no way to
override this effect of <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP>.  With <SAMP>`-I.'</SAMP> you can specify
searching the directory which was current when the compiler was
invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor does
by default, but it is often satisfactory.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP> does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
for header files.  Thus, <SAMP>`-I-'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-nostdinc'</SAMP> are
independent.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-L<VAR>dir</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Add directory <VAR>dir</VAR> to the list of directories to be searched
for <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-B<VAR>prefix</VAR></CODE>
<DD>This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries and
data files of the compiler itself.
<P>

The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
<TT>`cpp'</TT>, <TT>`cc1'</TT>, <TT>`as'</TT> and <TT>`ld'</TT>.  It tries
<VAR>prefix</VAR> as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and
without <SAMP>`<VAR>machine</VAR>/<VAR>version</VAR>/'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC17">2.11 Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version</A>).
</P><P>

For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
<SAMP>`-B'</SAMP> prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if <SAMP>`-B'</SAMP>
was not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, which are
<TT>`/usr/lib/gcc/'</TT> and <TT>`/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/'</TT>.  If neither of
those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
name is searched for using the directories specified in your
<SAMP>`PATH'</SAMP> environment variable.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`-B'</SAMP> prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
options into <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> options for the linker.
</P><P>

The run-time support file <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT> can also be searched for using
the <SAMP>`-B'</SAMP> prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
out of the link if it is not found by those means.
</P><P>

Another way to specify a prefix much like the <SAMP>`-B'</SAMP> prefix is to use
the environment variable <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC34">2.14 Environment Variables Affecting GNU CC</A>.

<H2> 2.11 Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version </H2>
<!--docid::SEC17::-->
<P>

By default, GNU CC compiles code for the same type of machine that you
are using.  However, it can also be installed as a cross-compiler, to
compile for some other type of machine.  In fact, several different
configurations of GNU CC, for different target machines, can be
installed side by side.  Then you specify which one to use with the
<SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> option.
</P><P>

In addition, older and newer versions of GNU CC can be installed side
by side.  One of them (probably the newest) will be the default, but
you may sometimes wish to use another.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-b <VAR>machine</VAR></CODE>
<DD>The argument <VAR>machine</VAR> specifies the target machine for compilation.
This is useful when you have installed GNU CC as a cross-compiler.
<P>

The value to use for <VAR>machine</VAR> is the same as was specified as the
machine type when configuring GNU CC as a cross-compiler.  For
example, if a cross-compiler was configured with <SAMP>`configure
i386v'</SAMP>, meaning to compile for an 80386 running System V, then you
would specify <SAMP>`-b i386v'</SAMP> to run that cross compiler.
</P><P>

When you do not specify <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP>, it normally means to compile for
the same type of machine that you are using.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-V <VAR>version</VAR></CODE>
<DD>The argument <VAR>version</VAR> specifies which version of GNU CC to run.
This is useful when multiple versions are installed.  For example,
<VAR>version</VAR> might be <SAMP>`2.0'</SAMP>, meaning to run GNU CC version 2.0.
<P>

The default version, when you do not specify <SAMP>`-V'</SAMP>, is controlled
by the way GNU CC is installed.  Normally, it will be a version that
is recommended for general use.
</DL>
<P>

The <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-V'</SAMP> options actually work by controlling part of
the file name used for the executable files and libraries used for
compilation.  A given version of GNU CC, for a given target machine, is
normally kept in the directory <TT>`/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/<VAR>machine</VAR>/<VAR>version</VAR>'</TT>.</P><P>

It follows that sites can customize the effect of <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-V'</SAMP>
either by changing the names of these directories or adding
alternate names (or symbolic links).  Thus, if
<TT>`/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/80386'</TT> is a link to
<TT>`/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/i386v'</TT>, then <SAMP>`-b 80386'</SAMP> becomes an alias
for <SAMP>`-b i386v'</SAMP>.</P><P>

In one respect, the <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-V'</SAMP> do not completely change
to a different compiler: the top-level driver program <CODE>gcc</CODE>
that you originally invoked continues to run and invoke the other
executables (preprocessor, compiler per se, assembler and linker)
that do the real work.  However, since no real work is done in the
driver program, it usually does not matter that the driver program
in use is not the one for the specified target and version.
</P><P>

The only way that the driver program depends on the target machine is
in the parsing and handling of special machine-specific options.
However, this is controlled by a file which is found, along with the
other executables, in the directory for the specified version and
target machine.  As a result, a single installed driver program adapts
to any specified target machine and compiler version.
</P><P>

The driver program executable does control one significant thing,
however: the default version and target machine.  Therefore, you can
install different instances of the driver program, compiled for
different targets or versions, under different names.
</P><P>

For example, if the driver for version 2.0 is installed as <CODE>ogcc</CODE>
and that for version 2.1 is installed as <CODE>gcc</CODE>, then the command
<CODE>gcc</CODE> will use version 2.1 by default, while <CODE>ogcc</CODE> will use
2.0 by default.  However, you can choose either version with either
command with the <SAMP>`-V'</SAMP> option.

<P>

Earlier we discussed the standard option <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> which chooses among
different installed compilers for completely different target
machines, such as Vax vs. 68000 vs. 80386.
</P><P>

In addition, each of these target machine types can have its own
special options, starting with <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP>, to choose among various
hardware models or configurations--for example, 68010 vs 68020,
floating coprocessor or none.  A single installed version of the
compiler can compile for any model or configuration, according to the
options specified.
</P><P>

Some configurations of the compiler also support additional special
options, usually for compatibility with other compilers on the same
platform.
</P><P>

These options are defined by the macro <CODE>TARGET_SWITCHES</CODE> in the
machine description.  The default for the options is also defined by
that macro, which enables you to change the defaults.

This is the default for most 68020 systems unless <SAMP>`-nfp'</SAMP> was
specified when the compiler was configured.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-m68030</CODE>
<DD>Generate output for a 68030.  This is the default
when the compiler is configured for 68030-based systems.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-m68040</CODE>
<DD>Generate output for a 68040.  This is the default
when the compiler is configured for 68040-based systems.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-m68020-40</CODE>
<DD>Generate output for a 68040, without using any of the new instructions.
This results in code which can run relatively efficiently on either a
68020/68881 or a 68030 or a 68040.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mfpa</CODE>
<DD>Generate output containing Sun FPA instructions for floating point.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-msoft-float</CODE>
<DD>Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> the requisite libraries are not part of GNU CC.
Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are used, but
this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your
own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mshort</CODE>
<DD>Consider type <CODE>int</CODE> to be 16 bits wide, like <CODE>short int</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mnobitfield</CODE>
<DD>Do not use the bit-field instructions.  <SAMP>`-m68000'</SAMP> implies
<SAMP>`-mnobitfield'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mbitfield</CODE>
<DD>Do use the bit-field instructions.  <SAMP>`-m68020'</SAMP> implies
<SAMP>`-mbitfield'</SAMP>.  This is the default if you use the unmodified
sources configured for a 68020.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mrtd</CODE>
<DD>Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions
that take a fixed number of arguments return with the <CODE>rtd</CODE>
instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This
saves one instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop
the arguments there.
<P>

This calling convention is incompatible with the one normally
used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call libraries
compiled with the Unix compiler.
</P><P>

Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
take variable numbers of arguments (including <CODE>printf</CODE>);
otherwise incorrect code will be generated for calls to those
functions.
</P><P>

In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a
function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
harmlessly ignored.)
</P><P>

The <CODE>rtd</CODE> instruction is supported by the 68010 and 68020
processors, but not by the 68000.

</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-m88000</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX21"></A>
Generate code that works well on both the m88100 and the

<P>

<DT><CODE>-m88100</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX22"></A>

runs on the m88110.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-m88110</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX23"></A>
Generate code that works best for the m88110, and may not run

<P>

<DT><CODE>-midentify-revision</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX24"></A>
<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
<A NAME="IDX26"></A>
Include an <CODE>ident</CODE> directive in the assembler output recording the

flags used.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mno-underscores</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX27"></A>
<A NAME="IDX28"></A>
In assembler output, emit symbol names without adding an underscore
character at the beginning of each name.  The default is to use an
underscore as prefix on each name.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mocs-debug-info</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-ocs-debug-info</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX29"></A>
<A NAME="IDX30"></A>
<A NAME="IDX31"></A>
<A NAME="IDX32"></A>
Include (or omit) additional debugging information (about registers used
in each stack frame) as specified in the 88open Object Compatibility
Standard, "OCS".  This extra information allows debugging of code that
has had the frame pointer eliminated.  The default for DG/UX, SVr4, and
Delta 88 SVr3.2 is to include this information; other 88k configurations
omit this information by default.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mocs-frame-position</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX33"></A>
<A NAME="IDX34"></A>
When emitting COFF debugging information for automatic variables and
parameters stored on the stack, use the offset from the canonical frame
address, which is the stack pointer (register 31) on entry to the
function.  The DG/UX, SVr4, Delta88 SVr3.2, and BCS configurations use
<SAMP>`-mocs-frame-position'</SAMP>; other 88k configurations have the default
<SAMP>`-mno-ocs-frame-position'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mno-ocs-frame-position</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX35"></A>
<A NAME="IDX36"></A>
When emitting COFF debugging information for automatic variables and
parameters stored on the stack, use the offset from the frame pointer
register (register 30).  When this option is in effect, the frame
pointer is not eliminated when debugging information is selected by the
-g switch.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-moptimize-arg-area</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-optimize-arg-area</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX37"></A>
<A NAME="IDX38"></A>
<A NAME="IDX39"></A>
Control how to store function arguments in stack frames.
<SAMP>`-moptimize-arg-area'</SAMP> saves space, but conflicts with the 88open
specifications.  <SAMP>`-mno-optimize-arg-area'</SAMP> conforms to the 88open
standards.  By default GNU CC does not optimize the argument area.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mshort-data-<VAR>num</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX40"></A>
<A NAME="IDX41"></A>
<A NAME="IDX42"></A>
Generate smaller data references by making them relative to <CODE>r0</CODE>,
which allows loading a value using a single instruction (rather than the
usual two).  You control which data references are affected by
specifying <VAR>num</VAR> with this option.  For example, if you specify
<SAMP>`-mshort-data-512'</SAMP>, then the data references affected are those
involving displacements of less than 512 bytes.
<SAMP>`-mshort-data-<VAR>num</VAR>'</SAMP> is not effective for <VAR>num</VAR> greater
than 64K.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mserialize-volatile</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX43"></A>
<DT><CODE>-mno-serialize-volatile</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX44"></A>
<A NAME="IDX45"></A>
Do, or don't, generate code to guarantee sequential consistency of
volatile memory references.
<P>

GNU CC always guarantees consistency by default, for the preferred
processor submodel.  How this is done depends on the submodel.
</P><P>

The m88100 processor does not reorder memory references and so always
provides sequential consistency.  If you use <SAMP>`-m88100'</SAMP>, GNU CC does
not generate any special instructions for sequential consistency.
</P><P>

The order of memory references made by the m88110 processor does not
always match the order of the instructions requesting those references.
In particular, a load instruction may execute before a preceding store
instruction.  Such reordering violates sequential consistency of
volatile memory references, when there are multiple processors.  When
you use <SAMP>`-m88000'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-m88110'</SAMP>, GNU CC generates special
instructions when appropriate, to force execution in the proper order.
</P><P>

The extra code generated to guarantee consistency may affect the
performance of your application.  If you know that you can safely forgo
this guarantee, you may use <SAMP>`-mno-serialize-volatile'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

If you use <SAMP>`-m88100'</SAMP> but require sequential consistency when
running on the m88110 processor, you should use
<SAMP>`-mserialize-volatile'</SAMP>.

<DD><A NAME="IDX46"></A>

<A NAME="IDX49"></A>
Turn on (<SAMP>`-msvr4'</SAMP>) or off (<SAMP>`-msvr3'</SAMP>) compiler extensions
related to System V release 4 (SVr4).  This controls the following:
<P>

<OL>
<LI>
Which variant of the assembler syntax to emit (which you can select
independently using <SAMP>`-mversion-03.00'</SAMP>).  
<LI>
<SAMP>`-msvr4'</SAMP> makes the C preprocessor recognize <SAMP>`#pragma weak'</SAMP>
that is used on System V release 4.
<LI>
<SAMP>`-msvr4'</SAMP> makes GNU CC issue additional declaration directives used in
SVr4.  
</OL>
<P>

<SAMP>`-msvr3'</SAMP> is the default for all m88K configurations except
the SVr4 configuration.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-mversion-03.00</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX50"></A>
In the DG/UX configuration, there are two flavors of SVr4.  This option
modifies <SAMP>`-msvr4'</SAMP> to select whether the hybrid-COFF or real-ELF
flavor is used.  All other configurations ignore this option.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mno-check-zero-division</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mcheck-zero-division</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX51"></A>
<A NAME="IDX52"></A>
<A NAME="IDX53"></A>
Early models of the 88K architecture had problems with division by zero;
in particular, many of them didn't trap.  Use these options to avoid
including (or to include explicitly) additional code to detect division
by zero and signal an exception.  All GNU CC configurations for the 88K use
<SAMP>`-mcheck-zero-division'</SAMP> by default.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-muse-div-instruction</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX54"></A>
<A NAME="IDX55"></A>
Do not emit code to check both the divisor and dividend when doing
signed integer division to see if either is negative, and adjust the
signs so the divide is done using non-negative numbers.  Instead, rely
on the operating system to calculate the correct value when the
<CODE>div</CODE> instruction traps.  This results in different behavior when
the most negative number is divided by -1, but is useful when most or
all signed integer divisions are done with positive numbers.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mtrap-large-shift</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mhandle-large-shift</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX56"></A>
<A NAME="IDX57"></A>
<A NAME="IDX58"></A>
<A NAME="IDX59"></A>
Include code to detect bit-shifts of more than 31 bits; respectively,
trap such shifts or emit code to handle them properly.  By default GNU CC
makes no special provision for large bit shifts.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mwarn-passed-structs</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX60"></A>
<A NAME="IDX61"></A>
Warn when a function passes a struct as an argument or result.
Structure-passing conventions have changed during the evolution of the C
language, and are often the source of portability problems.  By default,
GNU CC issues no such warning.

<P>

These <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> options are defined for the IBM RT PC:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-min-line-mul</CODE>
<DD>Use an in-line code sequence for integer multiplies.  This is the
default.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mcall-lib-mul</CODE>
<DD>Call <CODE>lmul$$</CODE> for integer multiples.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mfull-fp-blocks</CODE>
<DD>Generate full-size floating point data blocks, including the minimum
amount of scratch space recommended by IBM.  This is the default.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mminimum-fp-blocks</CODE>
<DD>Do not include extra scratch space in floating point data blocks.  This
results in smaller code, but slower execution, since scratch space must
be allocated dynamically.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX62"></A>
<A NAME="IDX63"></A>
<DT><CODE>-mfp-arg-in-fpregs</CODE>
<DD>Use a calling sequence incompatible with the IBM calling convention in
which floating point arguments are passed in floating point registers.
Note that <CODE>varargs.h</CODE> and <CODE>stdargs.h</CODE> will not work with
floating point operands if this option is specified.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mfp-arg-in-gregs</CODE>
<DD>Use the normal calling convention for floating point arguments.  This is
the default.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mhc-struct-return</CODE>
<DD>Return structures of more than one word in memory, rather than in a
register.  This provides compatibility with the MetaWare HighC (hc)
compiler.  Use <SAMP>`-fpcc-struct-return'</SAMP> for compatibility with the
Portable C Compiler (pcc).
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mnohc-struct-return</CODE>
<DD>Return some structures of more than one word in registers, when
convenient.  This is the default.  For compatibility with the
IBM-supplied compilers, use either <SAMP>`-fpcc-struct-return'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`-mhc-struct-return'</SAMP>.

<H3> 2.12.9 MIPS Options </H3>
<!--docid::SEC27::-->
<P>

These <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> options are defined for the MIPS family of computers:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-mcpu=<VAR>cpu type</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Assume the defaults for the machine type <VAR>cpu type</VAR> when
scheduling instructions.  The default <VAR>cpu type</VAR> is
<SAMP>`default'</SAMP>, which picks the longest cycles times for any of the
machines, in order that the code run at reasonable rates on all MIPS
cpu's.  Other choices for <VAR>cpu type</VAR> are <SAMP>`r2000'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`r3000'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`r4000'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`r6000'</SAMP>.  While picking a
specific <VAR>cpu type</VAR> will schedule things appropriately for that
particular chip, the compiler will not generate any code that does not
meet level 1 of the MIPS ISA (instruction set architecture) without
the <SAMP>`-mips2'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-mips3'</SAMP> switches being used.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mips2</CODE>
<DD>Issue instructions from level 2 of the MIPS ISA (branch likely, square
root instructions).  The <SAMP>`-mcpu=r4000'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-mcpu=r6000'</SAMP>
switch must be used in conjunction with <SAMP>`-mips2'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mips3</CODE>
<DD>Issue instructions from level 3 of the MIPS ISA (64 bit instructions).
You must use the <SAMP>`-mcpu=r4000'</SAMP> switch along with <SAMP>`-mips3'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mint64</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mlong64</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mlonglong128</CODE>
<DD>These options don't work at present.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mmips-as</CODE>
<DD>Generate code for the MIPS assembler, and invoke <TT>`mips-tfile'</TT> to
add normal debug information.  This is the default for all
platforms except for the OSF/1 reference platform, using the OSF/rose
object format.  If the either of the <SAMP>`-gstabs'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-gstabs+'</SAMP>
switches are used, the <TT>`mips-tfile'</TT> program will encapsulate the
stabs within MIPS ECOFF.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mgas</CODE>
<DD>Generate code for the GNU assembler.  This is the default on the OSF/1
reference platform, using the OSF/rose object format.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mrnames</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-rnames</CODE>
<DD>The <SAMP>`-mrnames'</SAMP> switch says to output code using the MIPS software
names for the registers, instead of the hardware names (ie, <VAR>a0</VAR>
instead of <VAR>$4</VAR>).  The GNU assembler does not support the
<SAMP>`-mrnames'</SAMP> switch, and the MIPS assembler will be instructed to
run the MIPS C preprocessor over the source file.  The
<SAMP>`-mno-rnames'</SAMP> switch is default.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mgpopt</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-gpopt</CODE>
<DD>The <SAMP>`-mgpopt'</SAMP> switch says to write all of the data declarations
before the instructions in the text section, this allows the MIPS
assembler to generate one word memory references instead of using two
words for short global or static data items.  This is on by default if
optimization is selected.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mstats</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-stats</CODE>
<DD>For each non-inline function processed, the <SAMP>`-mstats'</SAMP> switch
causes the compiler to emit one line to the standard error file to
print statistics about the program (number of registers saved, stack
size, etc.).
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mmemcpy</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-memcpy</CODE>
<DD>The <SAMP>`-mmemcpy'</SAMP> switch makes all block moves call the appropriate
string function (<SAMP>`memcpy'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`bcopy'</SAMP>) instead of possibly
generating inline code.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mmips-tfile</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-mips-tfile</CODE>
<DD>The <SAMP>`-mno-mips-tfile'</SAMP> switch causes the compiler not
postprocess the object file with the <TT>`mips-tfile'</TT> program,
after the MIPS assembler has generated it to add debug support.  If
<TT>`mips-tfile'</TT> is not run, then no local variables will be
available to the debugger.  In addition, <TT>`stage2'</TT> and
<TT>`stage3'</TT> objects will have the temporary file names passed to the
assembler embedded in the object file, which means the objects will
not compare the same.  The <SAMP>`-mno-mips-tfile'</SAMP> switch should only
be used when there are bugs in the <TT>`mips-tfile'</TT> program that
prevents compilation.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-msoft-float</CODE>
<DD>Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> the requisite libraries are not part of GNU CC.
Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are used, but
this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your
own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mhard-float</CODE>
<DD>Generate output containing floating point instructions.  This is the
default if you use the unmodified sources.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mfp64</CODE>
<DD>Assume that the <VAR>FR</VAR> bit in the status word is on, and that there
are 32 64-bit floating point registers, instead of 32 32-bit floating
point registers.  You must also specify the <SAMP>`-mcpu=r4000'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`-mips3'</SAMP> switches.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mfp32</CODE>
<DD>Assume that there are 32 32-bit floating point registers.  This is the
default.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mabicalls</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-abicalls</CODE>
<DD>Emit the <SAMP>`.abicalls'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`.cpload'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`.cprestore'</SAMP>
pseudo operations that some System V.4 ports use for position
independent code.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mhalf-pic</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-half-pic</CODE>
<DD>Put pointers to extern references into the data section and load them
up, rather than put the references in the text section.  These options
do not work at present.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-G <VAR>num</VAR></CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX64"></A>
<A NAME="IDX65"></A>
Put global and static items less than or equal to <VAR>num</VAR> bytes into
the small data or bss sections instead of the normal data or bss
section.  This allows the assembler to emit one word memory reference
instructions based on the global pointer (<VAR>gp</VAR> or <VAR>$28</VAR>),
instead of the normal two words used.  By default, <VAR>num</VAR> is 8 when
the MIPS assembler is used, and 0 when the GNU assembler is used.  The
<SAMP>`-G <VAR>num</VAR>'</SAMP> switch is also passed to the assembler and linker.
All modules should be compiled with the same <SAMP>`-G <VAR>num</VAR>'</SAMP>
value.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-nocpp</CODE>
<DD>Tell the MIPS assembler to not run it's preprocessor over user
assembler files (with a <SAMP>`.s'</SAMP> suffix) when assembling them.
</DL>
<P>

These options are defined by the macro
<CODE>TARGET_SWITCHES</CODE> in the machine description.  The default for the
options is also defined by that macro, which enables you to change the
defaults.

</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-m486</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-486</CODE>
<DD>Control whether or not code is optimized for a 486 instead of an
386.  Code generated for an 486 will run on a 386 and vice versa.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-msoft-float</CODE>
<DD>Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> the requisite libraries are not part of GNU CC.
Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are used, but
this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your
own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for

<P>

On machines where a function returns floating point results in the 80387
register stack, some floating point opcodes may be emitted even if
<SAMP>`-msoft-float'</SAMP> is used.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-mno-fp-ret-in-387</CODE>
<DD>Don't use the FPU registers for return values of functions.
<P>

The usual calling convention has functions return values of types
<CODE>float</CODE> and <CODE>double</CODE> in an FPU register, even if there
is no FPU.  The idea is that the operating system should emulate
an FPU.
</P><P>

The option <SAMP>`-mno-fp-ret-in-387'</SAMP> causes such values to be returned
in ordinary CPU registers instead.

<!--docid::SEC29::-->
<P>

This <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> option is defined for the HPPA family of computers:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-mno-bss</CODE>
<DD>Disable the use of the BSS section.  This may be necessary with older
versions of pa-gas.   It is highly recommended that you pick up a new
version of pa-gas from <CODE>jaguar.cs.utah.edu</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mpa-risc-1-0</CODE>
<DD>Generate code for a PA 1.0 processor.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mpa-risc-1-1</CODE>
<DD>Generate code for a PA 1.1 processor.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mkernel</CODE>
<DD>Generate code which is suitable for use in kernels.  Specifically, avoid
<CODE>add</CODE> instructions in which one of the arguments is the DP register;
generate <CODE>addil</CODE> instructions instead.  This avoids a rather serious
bug in the HP-UX linker.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mshared-libs</CODE>
<DD>Generate code that can be linked against HP-UX shared libraries.  This option
is not fully function yet, and is not on by default for any PA target.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mno-shared-libs</CODE>
<DD>Don't generate code that will be linked against shared libraries.  This is
the default for all PA targets.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mlong-calls</CODE>
<DD>Generate code which allows calls to functions greater than 256K away from
the caller when the caller and callee are in the same source file.  Do
not turn this option on unless code refuses to link with "branch out of
range errors" from the linker.

These <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> options are defined for the Intel 960 implementations:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-m<VAR>cpu type</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Assume the defaults for the machine type <VAR>cpu type</VAR> for some of
the other options, including instruction scheduling, floating point
support, and addressing modes.  The choices for <VAR>cpu type</VAR> are
<SAMP>`ka'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`kb'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`mc'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`ca'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`cf'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`sa'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`sb'</SAMP>.
The default is
<SAMP>`kb'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mnumerics</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-msoft-float</CODE>
<DD>The <SAMP>`-mnumerics'</SAMP> option indicates that the processor does support
floating-point instructions.  The <SAMP>`-msoft-float'</SAMP> option indicates
that floating-point support should not be assumed.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mleaf-procedures</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-leaf-procedures</CODE>
<DD>Do (or do not) attempt to alter leaf procedures to be callable with the
<CODE>bal</CODE> instruction as well as <CODE>call</CODE>.  This will result in more
efficient code for explicit calls when the <CODE>bal</CODE> instruction can be
substituted by the assembler or linker, but less efficient code in other
cases, such as calls via function pointers, or using a linker that doesn't
support this optimization.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mtail-call</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-tail-call</CODE>
<DD>Do (or do not) make additional attempts (beyond those of the
machine-independent portions of the compiler) to optimize tail-recursive
calls into branches.  You may not want to do this because the detection of
cases where this is not valid is not totally complete.  The default is
<SAMP>`-mno-tail-call'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mcomplex-addr</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-complex-addr</CODE>
<DD>Assume (or do not assume) that the use of a complex addressing mode is a
win on this implementation of the i960.  Complex addressing modes may not
be worthwhile on the K-series, but they definitely are on the C-series.
The default is currently <SAMP>`-mcomplex-addr'</SAMP> for all processors except
the CB and CC.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mcode-align</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-code-align</CODE>
<DD>Align code to 8-byte boundaries for faster fetching (or don't bother).
Currently turned on by default for C-series implementations only.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mic-compat</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mic2.0-compat</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mic3.0-compat</CODE>
<DD>Enable compatibility with iC960 v2.0 or v3.0.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-masm-compat</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mintel-asm</CODE>
<DD>Enable compatibility with the iC960 assembler.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mstrict-align</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-strict-align</CODE>
<DD>Do not permit (do permit) unaligned accesses.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-mold-align</CODE>
<DD>Enable structure-alignment compatibility with Intel's gcc release version
1.3 (based on gcc 1.37).  Currently this is buggy in that <SAMP>`#pragma
align 1'</SAMP> is always assumed as well, and cannot be turned off.

operations, you must ensure that the library is built so as not to call
them.
<P>

Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point operations are
required to have floating-point registers.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-mfp-reg</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>-mno-fp-regs</CODE>
<DD>Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register set.
<CODE>-mno-fp-regs</CODE> implies <CODE>-msoft-float</CODE>.  If the floating-point
register set is not used, floating point operands are passed in integer
registers as if they were integers and floating-point results are passed
in $0 instead of $f0.  This is a non-standard calling sequence, so any
function with a floating-point argument or return value called by code
compiled with <CODE>-mno-fp-regs</CODE> must also be compiled with that
option.
<P>

A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not use,
and hence need not save and restore, any floating-point registers.

<H2> 2.13 Options for Code Generation Conventions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC33::-->
<P>

These machine-independent options control the interface conventions
used in code generation.
</P><P>

Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
of <SAMP>`-ffoo'</SAMP> would be <SAMP>`-fno-foo'</SAMP>.  In the table below, only
one of the forms is listed--the one which is not the default.  You
can figure out the other form by either removing <SAMP>`no-'</SAMP> or adding
it.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>-fpcc-struct-return</CODE>
<DD>Use the same convention for returning <CODE>struct</CODE> and <CODE>union</CODE>
values that is used by the usual C compiler on your system.  This
convention is less efficient for small structures, and on many
machines it fails to be reentrant; but it has the advantage of
allowing intercallability between GNU CC-compiled code and PCC-compiled
code.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fshort-enums</CODE>
<DD>Allocate to an <CODE>enum</CODE> type only as many bytes as it needs for the
declared range of possible values.  Specifically, the <CODE>enum</CODE> type
will be equivalent to the smallest integer type which has enough room.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fshort-double</CODE>
<DD>Use the same size for <CODE>double</CODE> as for <CODE>float</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fshared-data</CODE>
<DD>Requests that the data and non-<CODE>const</CODE> variables of this
compilation be shared data rather than private data.  The distinction
makes sense only on certain operating systems, where shared data is
shared between processes running the same program, while private data
exists in one copy per process.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-common</CODE>
<DD>Allocate even uninitialized global variables in the bss section of the
object file, rather than generating them as common blocks.  This has the
effect that if the same variable is declared (without <CODE>extern</CODE>) in
two different compilations, you will get an error when you link them.
The only reason this might be useful is if you wish to verify that the
program will work on other systems which always work this way.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-ident</CODE>
<DD>Ignore the <SAMP>`#ident'</SAMP> directive.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fno-gnu-linker</CODE>
<DD>Don't output global initializations such as C++ constructors and
destructors in the form used by the GNU linker (on systems where the GNU
linker is the standard method of handling them).  Use this option when
you want to use a "collect" program and a non-GNU linker.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-finhibit-size-directive</CODE>
<DD>Don't output a <CODE>.size</CODE> assembler directive, or anything else that
would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the 
two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.  This option is
used when compiling <TT>`crtstuff.c'</TT>; you should not need to use it
for anything else.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fnonnull-objects</CODE>
<DD>Assume that objects reached through references are not null
(C++ only).
<P>

Normally, GNU C++ makes conservative assumptions about objects reached
through references.  For example, the compiler must check that <CODE>a</CODE>
is not null in code like the following:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>obj &#38;a = g ();
a.f (2);
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Checking that references of this sort have non-null values requires
extra code, however, and it is unnecessary for many programs.  You can
use <SAMP>`-fnonnull-objects'</SAMP> to omit the checks for null, if your
program doesn't require checking.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fverbose-asm</CODE>
<DD>Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to those
who actually need to read the generated assembly code (perhaps while
debugging the compiler itself).
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fvolatile</CODE>
<DD>Consider all memory references through pointers to be volatile.
<P>

<DT><CODE>-fpic</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX66"></A>
<A NAME="IDX67"></A>
If supported for the target machine, generate position-independent code
(PIC) suitable for use in a shared library.  All addresses will be
accessed through a global offset table (GOT).  If the GOT size for the
linked executable exceeds a machine-specific maximum size, you will get
an error message from the linker indicating that <SAMP>`-fpic'</SAMP> does not
work; recompile with <SAMP>`-fPIC'</SAMP> instead.  (These maximums are 16k on
the m88k, 8k on the Sparc, and 32k on the m68k and RS/6000.  The 386 has
no such limit.)
<P>

Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.  For the 386, GNU CC supports PIC for System V
but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the IBM RS/6000 is always
position-independent.
</P><P>

The GNU assembler does not fully support PIC.  Currently, you must use
some other assembler in order for PIC to work.  We would welcome
volunteers to upgrade GAS to handle this; the first part of the job is
to figure out what the assembler must do differently.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fPIC</CODE>
<DD>If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent code,
suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding any limit on the size of the
global offset table.  This option makes a difference on the m68k, m88k
and the Sparc.
<P>

Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-ffixed-<VAR>reg</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Treat the register named <VAR>reg</VAR> as a fixed register; generated code
should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame
pointer or in some other fixed role).
<P>

<VAR>reg</VAR> must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted
are machine-specific and are defined in the <CODE>REGISTER_NAMES</CODE>
macro in the machine description macro file.
</P><P>

This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fcall-used-<VAR>reg</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Treat the register named <VAR>reg</VAR> as an allocatable register that is
clobbered by function calls.  It may be allocated for temporaries or
variables that do not live across a call.  Functions compiled this way
will not save and restore the register <VAR>reg</VAR>.
<P>

Use of this flag for a register that has a fixed pervasive role in the
machine's execution model, such as the stack pointer or frame pointer,
will produce disastrous results.
</P><P>

This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>-fcall-saved-<VAR>reg</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Treat the register named <VAR>reg</VAR> as an allocatable register saved by
functions.  It may be allocated even for temporaries or variables that
live across a call.  Functions compiled this way will save and restore
the register <VAR>reg</VAR> if they use it.
<P>

Use of this flag for a register that has a fixed pervasive role in the
machine's execution model, such as the stack pointer or frame pointer,
will produce disastrous results.
</P><P>

A different sort of disaster will result from the use of this flag for
a register in which function values may be returned.
</P><P>

This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.

<H2> 2.14 Environment Variables Affecting GNU CC </H2>
<!--docid::SEC34::-->
<P>

This section describes several environment variables that affect how GNU
CC operates.  They work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files.
</P><P>

Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
<SAMP>`-B'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC16">2.10 Options for Directory Search</A>).  These
take precedence over places specified using environment variables, which
in turn take precedence over those specified by the configuration of GNU
CC.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC150">14.1 Controlling the Compilation Driver, <TT>`gcc'</TT></A>.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>TMPDIR</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX68"></A>
If <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  GNU CC uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.
<P>

<DT><CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX69"></A>
If <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE> is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.
<P>

If GNU CC cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.
</P><P>

Other prefixes specified with <SAMP>`-B'</SAMP> take precedence over this prefix.
</P><P>

This prefix is also used for finding files such as <TT>`crt0.o'</TT> that are
used for linking.
</P><P>

In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with <SAMP>`/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib'</SAMP>
(more precisely, with the value of <CODE>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>), GNU CC tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with <SAMP>`-Bfoo/'</SAMP>, GNU CC will search
<TT>`foo/bar'</TT> where it would normally search <TT>`/usr/local/lib/bar'</TT>.
These alternate directories are searched first; the standard directories
come next.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>COMPILER_PATH</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX70"></A>
The value of <CODE>COMPILER_PATH</CODE> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <CODE>PATH</CODE>.  GNU CC tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the
subprograms using <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>LIBRARY_PATH</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX71"></A>
The value of <CODE>LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <CODE>PATH</CODE>.  GNU CC tries the directories thus
specified when searching for special linker files, if it can't find them
using <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>.  Linking using GNU CC also uses these
directories when searching for ordinary libraries for the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>
option (but directories specified with <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> come first).
<P>

<DT><CODE>C_INCLUDE_PATH</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX72"></A>
<A NAME="IDX73"></A>
<A NAME="IDX74"></A>
These environment variables pertain to particular languages.  Each
variable's value is a colon-separated list of directories, much like
<CODE>PATH</CODE>.  When GNU CC searches for header files, it tries the
directories listed in the variable for the language you are using, after
the directories specified with <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> but before the standard header
file directories.
<P>

<DT><CODE>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX75"></A>
<A NAME="IDX76"></A>
If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output dependencies
for Make based on the header files processed by the compiler.  This
output looks much like the output from the <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> option
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC13">2.7 Options Controlling the Preprocessor</A>), but it goes to a separate file, and is
in addition to the usual results of compilation.
<P>

The value of <CODE>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</CODE> can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
<SAMP>`<VAR>file</VAR> <VAR>target</VAR>'</SAMP>, in which case the rules are written to
file <VAR>file</VAR> using <VAR>target</VAR> as the target name.

<H2> 2.15 Running Protoize </H2>
<!--docid::SEC35::-->
<P>

The program <CODE>protoize</CODE> is an optional part of GNU C.  You can use
it to add prototypes to a program, thus converting the program to ANSI
C in one respect.  The companion program <CODE>unprotoize</CODE> does the
reverse: it removes argument types from any prototypes that are found.
</P><P>

When you run these programs, you must specify a set of source files as
command line arguments.  The conversion programs start out by compiling
these files to see what functions they define.  The information gathered
about a file <VAR>foo</VAR> is saved in a file named <TT>`<VAR>foo</VAR>.X'</TT>.
</P><P>

After scanning comes actual conversion.  The specified files are all
eligible to be converted; any files they include (whether sources or
just headers) are eligible as well.
</P><P>

But not all the eligible files are converted.  By default,
<CODE>protoize</CODE> and <CODE>unprotoize</CODE> convert only source and header
files in the current directory.  You can specify additional directories
whose files should be converted with the <SAMP>`-d <VAR>directory</VAR>'</SAMP>
option.  You can also specify particular files to exclude with the
<SAMP>`-x <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP> option.  A file is converted if it is eligible, its
directory name matches one of the specified directory names, and its
name within the directory has not been excluded.
</P><P>

Basic conversion with <CODE>protoize</CODE> consists of rewriting most
function definitions and function declarations to specify the types of
the arguments.  The only ones not rewritten are those for varargs
functions.
</P><P>

<CODE>protoize</CODE> optionally inserts prototype declarations at the
beginning of the source file, to make them available for any calls that
precede the function's definition.  Or it can insert prototype
declarations with block scope in the blocks where undeclared functions
are called.
</P><P>

Basic conversion with <CODE>unprotoize</CODE> consists of rewriting most
function declarations to remove any argument types, and rewriting
function definitions to the old-style pre-ANSI form.
</P><P>

Both conversion programs print a warning for any function declaration or
definition that they can't convert.  You can suppress these warnings
with <SAMP>`-q'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

The output from <CODE>protoize</CODE> or <CODE>unprotoize</CODE> replaces the
original source file.  The original file is renamed to a name ending
with <SAMP>`.save'</SAMP>.  If the <SAMP>`.save'</SAMP> file already exists, then 
the source file is simply discarded.
</P><P>

<CODE>protoize</CODE> and <CODE>unprotoize</CODE> both depend on GNU CC itself to
scan the program and collect information about the functions it uses.
So neither of these programs will work until GNU CC is installed.
</P><P>

Here is a table of the options you can use with <CODE>protoize</CODE> and
<CODE>unprotoize</CODE>.  Each option works with both programs unless
otherwise stated.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`-B <VAR>directory</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>Look for the file <TT>`SYSCALLS.c.X'</TT> in <VAR>directory</VAR>, instead of the
usual directory (normally <TT>`/usr/local/lib'</TT>).  This file contains
prototype information about standard system functions.  This option
applies only to <CODE>protoize</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-c <VAR>compilation-options</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>Use  <VAR>compilation-options</VAR> as the options when running <CODE>gcc</CODE> to
produce the <SAMP>`.X'</SAMP> files.  The special option <SAMP>`-aux-info'</SAMP> is
always passed in addition, to tell <CODE>gcc</CODE> to write a <SAMP>`.X'</SAMP> file.
<P>

Note that the compilation options must be given as a single argument to
<CODE>protoize</CODE> or <CODE>unprotoize</CODE>.  If you want to specify several
<CODE>gcc</CODE> options, you must quote the entire set of compilation options
to make them a single word in the shell.
</P><P>

There are certain <CODE>gcc</CODE> arguments that you cannot use, because they
would produce the wrong kind of output.  These include <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-S'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> If you include these in
the <VAR>compilation-options</VAR>, they are ignored.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`-C'</SAMP>
<DD>Rename files to end in <SAMP>`.C'</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP>.
This is convenient if you are converting a C program to C++.
This option applies only to <CODE>protoize</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-g'</SAMP>
<DD>Add explicit global declarations.  This means inserting explicit
declarations at the beginning of each source file for each function
that is called in the file and was not declared.  These declarations
precede the first function definition that contains a call to an
undeclared function.  This option applies only to <CODE>protoize</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-i <VAR>string</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>Indent old-style parameter declarations with the string <VAR>string</VAR>.
This option applies only to <CODE>protoize</CODE>.
<P>

<CODE>unprotoize</CODE> converts prototyped function definitions to old-style
function definitions, where the arguments are declared between the
argument list and the initial <SAMP>`{'</SAMP>.  By default, <CODE>unprotoize</CODE>
uses five spaces as the indentation.  If you want to indent with just
one space instead, use <SAMP>`-i " "'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`-k'</SAMP>
<DD>Keep the <SAMP>`.X'</SAMP> files.  Normally, they are deleted after conversion
is finished.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>
<DD>Add explicit local declarations.  <CODE>protoize</CODE> with <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> inserts
a prototype declaration for each function in each block which calls the
function without any declaration.  This option applies only to
<CODE>protoize</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-n'</SAMP>
<DD>Make no real changes.  This mode just prints information about the conversions
that would have been done without <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP>.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`-N'</SAMP>
<DD>Make no <SAMP>`.save'</SAMP> files.  The original files are simply deleted.

If you need special compiler options to compile one of your program's
source files, then you should generate that file's <SAMP>`.X'</SAMP> file
specially, by running <CODE>gcc</CODE> on that source file with the
appropriate options and the option <SAMP>`-aux-info'</SAMP>.  Then run
<CODE>protoize</CODE> on the entire set of files.  <CODE>protoize</CODE> will use
the existing <SAMP>`.X'</SAMP> file because it is newer than the source file.
For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>gcc -Dfoo=bar file1.c -aux-info
protoize *.c
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

You need to include the special files along with the rest in the
<CODE>protoize</CODE> command, even though their <SAMP>`.X'</SAMP> files already
exist, because otherwise they won't get converted.
</P><P>

<CODE>protoize</CODE> successfully.

<OL>
<LI>
If you have built GNU CC previously in the same directory for a
different target machine, do <SAMP>`make distclean'</SAMP> to delete all files
that might be invalid.  One of the files this deletes is
<TT>`Makefile'</TT>; if <SAMP>`make distclean'</SAMP> complains that <TT>`Makefile'</TT>
does not exist, it probably means that the directory is already suitably
clean.
<P>

<LI>
On a System V release 4 system, make sure <TT>`/usr/bin'</TT> precedes
<TT>`/usr/ucb'</TT> in <CODE>PATH</CODE>.  The <CODE>cc</CODE> command in
<TT>`/usr/ucb'</TT> uses libraries which have bugs.
<P>

<LI>
Specify the host and target machine configurations.  You do this by
running the file <TT>`configure'</TT> with appropriate arguments.
<P>

If you are building a compiler to produce code for the machine it runs
on, specify just one machine type.  Use the <SAMP>`--target'</SAMP> option; the
host type will default to be the same as the target.  (For information
on building a cross-compiler, see <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC38">3.2 Building and Installing a Cross-Compiler</A>.)  The command
looks like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>configure --target=sparc-sun-sunos4.1
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

A configuration name may be canonical or it may be more or less
abbreviated.
</P><P>

A canonical configuration name has three parts, separated by dashes.
It looks like this: <SAMP>`<VAR>cpu</VAR>-<VAR>company</VAR>-<VAR>system</VAR>'</SAMP>.
(The three parts may themselves contain dashes; <TT>`configure'</TT>
can figure out which dashes serve which purpose.)  For example,
<SAMP>`m68k-sun-sunos4.1'</SAMP> specifies a Sun 3.
</P><P>

You can also replace parts of the configuration by nicknames or aliases.
For example, <SAMP>`sun3'</SAMP> stands for <SAMP>`m68k-sun'</SAMP>, so
<SAMP>`sun3-sunos4.1'</SAMP> is another way to specify a Sun 3.  You can also
use simply <SAMP>`sun3-sunos'</SAMP>, since the version of SunOS is assumed by
default to be version 4.  <SAMP>`sun3-bsd'</SAMP> also works, since
<TT>`configure'</TT> knows that the only BSD variant on a Sun 3 is SunOS.
</P><P>

You can specify a version number after any of the system types, and some
of the CPU types.  In most cases, the version is irrelevant, and will be
ignored.  So you might as well specify the version if you know it.
</P><P>

Here are the possible CPU types:
</P><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
a29k, alpha, arm, c<VAR>n</VAR>, elxsi, hppa1.0, hppa1.1,
i386, i860, i960, m68000, m68k, m88k, mips,
ns32k, pyramid, romp, rs6000, sparc, vax, we32k.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Here are the recognized company names.  As you can see, customary
abbreviations are used rather than the longer official names.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

The company name is meaningful only to disambiguate when the rest of
the information supplied is insufficient.  You can omit it, writing
just <SAMP>`<VAR>cpu</VAR>-<VAR>system</VAR>'</SAMP>, if it is not needed.  For example,
<SAMP>`vax-ultrix4.2'</SAMP> is equivalent to <SAMP>`vax-dec-ultrix4.2'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

Here is a list of system types:
</P><P>

aix, aos, bsd, ctix, dgux, dynix,
genix, hpux, isc, linux, luna, mach,
minix, newsos, osf, osfrose, riscos,

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

You can omit the system type; then <TT>`configure'</TT> guesses the
operating system from the CPU and company.
</P><P>

You can add a version number to the system type; this may or may not
make a difference.  For example, you can write <SAMP>`bsd4.3'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`bsd4.4'</SAMP> to distinguish versions of BSD.  In practice, the version
number is most needed for <SAMP>`sysv3'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`sysv4'</SAMP>, which are often
treated differently.
</P><P>

If you specify an impossible combination such as <SAMP>`i860-dg-vms'</SAMP>,
then you may get an error message from <TT>`configure'</TT>, or it may
ignore part of the information and do the best it can with the rest.
<TT>`configure'</TT> always prints the canonical name for the alternative
that it used.
</P><P>

Often a particular model of machine has a name.  Many machine names are
recognized as aliases for CPU/company combinations.  Thus, the machine
name <SAMP>`sun3'</SAMP>, mentioned above, is an alias for <SAMP>`m68k-sun'</SAMP>.
Sometimes we accept a company name as a machine name, when the name is
popularly used for a particular machine.  Here is a table of the known
machine names:

Remember that a machine name specifies both the cpu type and the company

There are four additional options you can specify independently to 
describe variant hardware and software configurations.  These are
<SAMP>`--with-gnu-as'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`--with-gnu-ld'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`--with-stabs'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`--nfp'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`--with-gnu-as'</SAMP>
<DD>On certain systems, you must specify whether you want GNU CC to work
with the usual compilation tools or with the GNU compilation tools
(including GAS).  Use the <SAMP>`--with-gnu-as'</SAMP> argument when you run
<TT>`configure'</TT>, if you want to use the GNU tools.  (Specify
<SAMP>`--with-gnu-ld'</SAMP> as well, since on these systems GAS works only with
the GNU linker.)  The systems where this makes a difference are
<SAMP>`i386-<VAR>anything</VAR>-sysv'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`i860-<VAR>anything</VAR>-bsd'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`m68k-hp-hpux'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`m68k-sony-bsd'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`m68k-altos-sysv'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`m68000-hp-hpux'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`m68000-att-sysv'</SAMP>.  On any other system,
<SAMP>`--with-gnu-as'</SAMP> has no effect.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`--with-gnu-ld'</SAMP>
<DD>Specify the option <SAMP>`--with-gnu-ld'</SAMP> if you plan to use the GNU
linker.  This inhibits the installation of <CODE>collect2</CODE>, a program
which otherwise serves as a front-end for the system's linker on most
configurations.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`--with-stabs'</SAMP>
<DD>On MIPS based systems, you must specify whether you want GNU CC to
create the normal ECOFF debugging format, or to use BSD-style stabs
passed through the ECOFF symbol table.  The normal ECOFF debug format
cannot fully handle languages other than C.  BSD stabs format can handle
other languages, but it only works with the GNU debugger GDB.
<P>

Normally, GNU CC uses the ECOFF debugging format by default; if you
prefer BSD stabs, specify <SAMP>`--with-stabs'</SAMP> when you configure GNU
CC.
</P><P>

No matter which default you choose when you configure GNU CC, the user
can use the <SAMP>`-gcoff'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-gstabs+'</SAMP> options to specify explicitly
the debug format for a particular compilation.
</P><P>

<DT><SAMP>`--nfp'</SAMP>
<DD>On certain systems, you must specify whether the machine has a floating
point unit.  These systems are <SAMP>`m68k-sun-sunos<VAR>n</VAR>'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`m68k-isi-bsd'</SAMP>.  On any other system, <SAMP>`--nfp'</SAMP> currently has no
effect, though perhaps there are other systems where it could usefully
make a difference.
</DL>
<P>

If you want to install your own homemade configuration files, you can
use <SAMP>`local'</SAMP> as the company name to access them.  If you use 
configuration <SAMP>`<VAR>cpu</VAR>-local'</SAMP>, the entire configuration name
is used to form the configuration file names.
</P><P>

Thus, if you specify <SAMP>`m68k-local'</SAMP>, then the files used are
<TT>`m68k-local.md'</TT>, <TT>`m68k-local.h'</TT>, <TT>`m68k-local.c'</TT>,
<TT>`xm-m68k-local.h'</TT>, <TT>`t-m68k-local'</TT>, and <TT>`x-m68k-local'</TT>.
</P><P>

Here is a list of configurations that have special treatment or special
things you must know:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`alpha-*-osf1'</SAMP>
<DD>Systems using processors that implement the DEC Alpha architecture and
are running the OSF/1 operating system. (VMS on the Alpha is not
currently supported by GNU CC.)  As of this writing, the only Alpha-based
product currently available from DEC is the 21064 (EV4) processor chip;
no system-level products can be ordered.  This port is provided for
those developers who might have early Alpha hardware from DEC or other
vendors and run the OSF/1 operating system.  It has not been extensively
tested and both the C++ and Objective-C languages may not work, except
in a cross-compilation environment.
<P>

The <CODE>ASSEMBLE_FILE_START</CODE> macro writes a <CODE>.verstamp</CODE> directive
containing the version of the calling sequence.  Currently, we use
<SAMP>`9 0'</SAMP>, which we believe will work until the official release by DEC
of their system, at which point <SAMP>`3 11'</SAMP> is the correct value.  If
you get a mismatch error from the assembler on a <CODE>.verstamp</CODE> line,
consult the file <TT>`/usr/include/stamp.h'</TT> for the present value.  GNU
C on the Alpha does not support versions of DEC's OSF/1 earlier than
BL9; if you are running an older version, we suggest you ask your DEC
contact for an update.
</P><P>

Note that since the Alpha is a 64-bit architecture, cross-compilers
from 32-bit machines will not generate as efficient code as that
generated when the compiler is running on a 64-bit machine because many
optimizations that depend on being able to represent a word on the
target in an integral value on the host cannot be performed.

This configuration
corresponds to AMD's standard calling sequence and binary interface

<DD>Motorola m88k running the AT&#38;T/Unisoft/Motorola V.3 reference port.
These systems tend to use the Green Hills C, revision 1.8.5, as the
standard C compiler.  There are apparently bugs in this compiler that
result in object files differences between stage 2 and stage 3.  If this
happens, make the stage 4 compiler and compare it to the stage 3
compiler.  If the stage 3 and stage 4 object files are identical, this
suggests a problem with the standard C compiler.  It is best, however,
to use an older version of GNU CC for bootstrapping.

possible that some old versions of the system lack the functions
<CODE>memcpy</CODE>, <CODE>memcmp</CODE>, and <CODE>memset</CODE>.  If your system lacks

mismatches between the stage 2 and stage 3 compilers in various files.
These errors are minor differences in some floating-point constants and
can be safely ignored; the stage 3 compiler is correct.

Build the compiler.  Just type <SAMP>`make LANGUAGES=c'</SAMP> in the compiler
directory.
<P>

<SAMP>`LANGUAGES=c'</SAMP> specifies that only the C compiler should be
compiled.  The makefile normally builds compilers for all the supported
languages; currently, C, C++ and Objective C.  However, C is the only
language that is sure to work when you build with other non-GNU C
compilers.  In addition, building anything but C at this stage is a
waste of time.
</P><P>

In general, you can specify the languages to build by typing the
argument <SAMP>`LANGUAGES="<VAR>list</VAR>"'</SAMP>, where <VAR>list</VAR> is one or more
words from the list <SAMP>`c'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`c++'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`objective-c'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

Ignore any warnings you may see about "statement not reached" in
<TT>`insn-emit.c'</TT>; they are normal.  Any other compilation errors may
represent bugs in the port to your machine or operating system, and
should be investigated and reported (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC89">6. Reporting Bugs</A>).
</P><P>

Some commercial compilers fail to compile GNU CC because they have bugs
or limitations.  For example, the Microsoft compiler is said to run out
of macro space.  Some Ultrix compilers run out of expression space; then
you need to break up the statement where the problem happens.
</P><P>

If you are building with a previous GNU C compiler, do not
use <SAMP>`CC=gcc'</SAMP> on the make command or by editing the Makefile.
Instead, use a full pathname to specify the compiler, such as
<SAMP>`CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc'</SAMP>.  This is because make might execute
the <TT>`gcc'</TT> in the current directory before all of the
compiler components have been built.
</P><P>

<LI>
If you are using COFF-encapsulation, you must convert <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT> to
a GNU-format library at this point.  See the file <TT>`README.ENCAP'</TT>
in the directory containing the GNU binary file utilities, for
directions.

Move the first-stage object files and executables into a subdirectory
with this command:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>make stage1
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The files are moved into a subdirectory named <TT>`stage1'</TT>.
Once installation is complete, you may wish to delete these files
with <CODE>rm -r stage1</CODE>.

Recompile the compiler with itself, with this command:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>make CC="stage1/xgcc -Bstage1/" CFLAGS="-g -O"
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This is called making the stage 2 compiler.
</P><P>

The command shown above builds compilers for all the supported
languages.  If you don't want them all, you can specify the languages to
build by typing the argument <SAMP>`LANGUAGES="<VAR>list</VAR>"'</SAMP>.  <VAR>list</VAR>
should contain one or more words from the list <SAMP>`c'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`c++'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`objective-c'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`proto'</SAMP>.  Separate the words with spaces.
<SAMP>`proto'</SAMP> stands for the programs <CODE>protoize</CODE> and
<CODE>unprotoize</CODE>; they are not a separate language, but you use
<CODE>LANGUAGES</CODE> to enable or disable their installation.
</P><P>

If you are going to build the stage 3 compiler, then you might want to
build only the C language in stage 2.
</P><P>

Once you have built the stage 2 compiler, if you are short of disk
space, you can delete the subdirectory <TT>`stage1'</TT>.
</P><P>

On a 68000 or 68020 system lacking floating point hardware,
unless you have selected a <TT>`tm.h'</TT> file that expects by default
that there is no such hardware, do this instead:

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>make CC="stage1/xgcc -Bstage1/" CFLAGS="-g -O -msoft-float"
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<LI>
If you wish to test the compiler by compiling it with itself one more
time, do this:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>make stage2
make CC="stage2/xgcc -Bstage2/" CFLAGS="-g -O" 
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This is called making the stage 3 compiler.  Aside from the <SAMP>`-B'</SAMP>
option, the compiler options should be the same as when you made the
stage 2 compiler.  But the <CODE>LANGUAGES</CODE> option need not be the
same.  The command shown above builds compilers for all the supported
languages; if you don't want them all, you can specify the languages to
build by typing the argument <SAMP>`LANGUAGES="<VAR>list</VAR>"'</SAMP>, as described
above.
</P><P>

Then compare the latest object files with the stage 2 object
files--they ought to be identical, unless they contain time stamps.
You can compare the files, disregarding the time stamps if any, like
this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>make compare
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This will mention any object files that differ between stage 2 and stage
3.  Any difference, no matter how innocuous, indicates that the stage 2
compiler has compiled GNU CC incorrectly, and is therefore a potentially
serious bug which you should investigate and report (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC89">6. Reporting Bugs</A>).
</P><P>

If your system does not put time stamps in the object files, then this
is a faster way to compare them (using the Bourne shell):
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>for file in *.o; do
cmp $file stage2/$file
done
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If you have built the compiler with the <SAMP>`-mno-mips-tfile'</SAMP> option on
MIPS machines, you will not be able to compare the files.
</P><P>

<LI>
Install the compiler driver, the compiler's passes and run-time support.
You can use the following command:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>make install CC="stage2/xgcc -Bstage2/" CFLAGS="-g -O" LANGUAGES="<VAR>list</VAR>"
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

(Use the same value for <CODE>CC</CODE>, <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> and <CODE>LANGUAGES</CODE>
that you used when compiling the files that are being installed.  One
reason this is necessary is that some versions of Make have bugs and
recompile files gratuitously when you do this step.  If you use the same
variable values, those files will be recompiled properly.
</P><P>

This copies the files <TT>`cc1'</TT>, <TT>`cpp'</TT> and <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT> to files
<TT>`cc1'</TT>, <TT>`cpp'</TT> and <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT> in directory
<TT>`/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/<VAR>target</VAR>/<VAR>version</VAR>'</TT>, which is where the
compiler driver program looks for them.  Here <VAR>target</VAR> is the target
machine type specified when you ran <TT>`configure'</TT>, and <VAR>version</VAR>
is the version number of GNU CC.  This naming scheme permits various
versions and/or cross-compilers to coexist.
</P><P>

It also copies the driver program <TT>`gcc'</TT> into the directory
<TT>`/usr/local/bin'</TT>, so that it appears in typical execution search
paths.</P><P>

On some systems, this command will cause recompilation of some files.
This is usually due to bugs in <CODE>make</CODE>.  You should either ignore
this problem, or use GNU Make.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX80"></A>
<STRONG>Warning: there is a bug in <CODE>alloca</CODE> in the Sun library.  To
avoid this bug, be sure to install the executables of GNU CC that were
compiled by GNU CC.  (That is, the executables from stage 2 or 3, not
stage 1.)  They use <CODE>alloca</CODE> as a built-in function and never the
one in the library.</STRONG>
</P><P>

(It is usually better to install GNU CC executables from stage 2 or 3,
since they usually run faster than the ones compiled with some other
compiler.)
</P><P>

<LI>
Install the Objective C library (if you have built the Objective C
compiler).  Here is the command to do this:
<P>

Correct errors in the header files on your machine.
<P>

Various system header files often contain constructs which are
erroneous, incompatible with ANSI C or otherwise unsuitable, and they
will not work when you compile programs with GNU CC.
</P><P>

The most common erroneous construct is found in <TT>`ioctl.h'</TT>, where a
macro expects argument values to be substituted for argument names
inside of character constants--something not done in ANSI C.  This
particular problem can be prevented by using <SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP>.  Other
problems are not so easy to work around.
</P><P>

GNU CC comes with shell scripts to fix known header file problems.  They
install corrected copies of various header files in a special directory
where only GNU CC will normally look for them.  The scripts adapt to
various systems by searching all the system header files for the problem
cases that we know about.
</P><P>

Use the following command to do this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>make install-fixincludes
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If you selected a different directory for GNU CC installation when you
installed it, by specifying the Make variable <CODE>prefix</CODE> or
<CODE>libdir</CODE>, specify it the same way in this command.
</P><P>

Note that some systems are starting to come with ANSI C system header
files.  On these systems, don't run <CODE>install-fixincludes</CODE>; it may
not work, and is certainly not necessary.  One exception: there are is a
special script for System V release 4, which you should run.
</P><P>

It is not the purpose of <CODE>install-fixincludes</CODE> to add prototypes to
the system header files.  We support headers with ANSI C prototypes in
the GNU C Library, and we have no time to support adding them to other
systems' header files.
</P><P>

<LI>
If you're going to use C++, it's likely that you need to also install
the <CODE>libg++</CODE> distribution.  It should be available from the same
place where you got the GCC distribution.  Just as GCC does not
distribute a C runtime library, it also does not include a C++ run-time
library.  All I/O functionality, special class libraries, etc., are
available in the <CODE>libg++</CODE> distribution.
</OL>
<P>

If you cannot install the compiler's passes and run-time support in
<TT>`/usr/local/lib'</TT>, you can alternatively use the <SAMP>`-B'</SAMP> option to
specify a prefix by which they may be found.  The compiler concatenates
the prefix with the names  <TT>`cpp'</TT>, <TT>`cc1'</TT> and <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT>.
Thus, you can put the files in a directory <TT>`/usr/foo/gcc'</TT> and
specify <SAMP>`-B/usr/foo/gcc/'</SAMP> when you run GNU CC.
</P><P>

Also, you can specify an alternative default directory for these files
by setting the Make variable <CODE>libdir</CODE> when you make GNU CC.

This also tells <CODE>configure</CODE> where to find the compiler sources;
<CODE>configure</CODE> takes the directory from the file name that was used to

<H2> 3.2 Building and Installing a Cross-Compiler </H2>
<!--docid::SEC38::-->
<P>

GNU CC can function as a cross-compiler for many machines, but not all.
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
Cross-compilers for the Mips as target do not work because the auxiliary
programs <TT>`mips-tdump.c'</TT> and <TT>`mips-tfile.c'</TT> can't be compiled
on anything but a Mips.
<P>

<LI>
Cross-compilers to or from the Vax probably don't work completely
because the Vax uses an incompatible floating point format (not IEEE
format).
</UL>
<P>

Since GNU CC generates assembler code, you probably need a
cross-assembler that GNU CC can run, in order to produce object files.
If you want to link on other than the target machine, you need a
cross-linker as well.  You also need header files and libraries suitable
for the target machine that you can install on the host machine.
</P><P>

To build GNU CC as a cross-compiler, you start out by running
<CODE>configure</CODE>.  You must specify two different configurations, the
host and the target.  Use the <SAMP>`--host=<VAR>host</VAR>'</SAMP> option for the
host and <SAMP>`--target=<VAR>target</VAR>'</SAMP> to specify the target type.  For
example, here is how to configure for a cross-compiler that runs on a
hypothetical Intel 386 system and produces code for an HP 68030 system
running BSD:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>configure --target=m68k-hp-bsd4.3 --host=i386-bozotheclone-bsd4.3
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Next you should install the cross-assembler and cross-linker (and
<CODE>ar</CODE> and <CODE>ranlib</CODE>).  Put them in the directory
<TT>`/usr/local/<VAR>target</VAR>/bin'</TT>.  The installation of GNU CC will find
them there and copy or link them to the proper place to find them when
you run the cross-compiler later.
</P><P>

If you want to install any additional libraries to use with the
cross-compiler, put them in the directory
<TT>`/usr/local/<VAR>target</VAR>/lib'</TT>; all files in that subdirectory will
be installed in the proper place when you install the cross-compiler.
Likewise, put the header files for the target machine in
<TT>`/usr/local/<VAR>target</VAR>/include'</TT>.
</P><P>

You must now produce a substitute for <TT>`libgcc1.a'</TT>.  Normally this
file is compiled with the "native compiler" for the target machine;
compiling it with GNU CC does not work.  But compiling it with the host
machine's compiler also doesn't work--that produces a file that would
run on the host, and you need it to run on the target.
</P><P>

We can't give you any automatic way to produce this substitute.  For
some targets, the subroutines in <TT>`libgcc1.c'</TT> are not actually used.
You need not provide the ones that won't be used.  The ones that most
commonly are used are the multiplication, division and remainder
routines--many RISC machines rely on the library for this.  One way to
make them work is to define the appropriate <CODE>perform_<small>...</small></CODE>
macros for the subroutines that you need.  If these definitions do not
use the C arithmetic operators that they are meant to implement, you
might be able to compile them with the cross-compiler you are building.
To do this, specify <SAMP>`LIBGCC1=libgcc1.a OLDCC=./xgcc'</SAMP> when building
the compiler.
</P><P>

Now you can proceed just as for compiling a single-machine compiler
through the step of building stage 1.  If you have not provided some
sort of <TT>`libgcc1.a'</TT>, then compilation will give up at the point
where it needs that file, printing a suitable error message.  If you
do provide <TT>`libgcc1.a'</TT>, then building the compiler will automatically
compile and link a test program called <TT>`cross-test'</TT>; if you get
errors in the linking, it means that not all of the necessary routines
in <TT>`libgcc1.a'</TT> are available.
</P><P>

When you are using a cross-compiler configuration, building stage 1
does not compile all of GNU CC.  This is because one part of building,
the compilation of <TT>`libgcc2.c'</TT>, requires use of the cross-compiler.
</P><P>

However, when you type <SAMP>`make install'</SAMP> to install the bulk of the
cross-compiler, that will also compile <TT>`libgcc2.c'</TT> and install the
resulting <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT>.
</P><P>

Do not try to build stage 2 for a cross-compiler.  It doesn't work to
rebuild GNU CC as a cross-compiler using the cross-compiler, because
that would produce a program that runs on the target machine, not on the
host.  For example, if you compile a 386-to-68030 cross-compiler with
itself, the result will not be right either for the 386 (because it was
compiled into 68030 code) or for the 68030 (because it was configured
for a 386 as the host).  If you want to compile GNU CC into 68030 code,
whether you compile it on a 68030 or with a cross-compiler on a 386, you
must specify a 68030 as the host when you configure it.

There are two variants of this CPU, called 1.0 and 1.1, which have
different machine descriptions.  You must use the right one for your

all other 8<VAR>nn</VAR> machines use 1.0.
</P><P>

The easiest way to handle this problem is to use <SAMP>`configure

the model number of the machine.  Then <TT>`configure'</TT> will figure out
if the machine is a 1.0 or 1.1.  Use <SAMP>`uname -a'</SAMP> to find out the
model number of your machine.

<SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> does not work on HP-UX, since that system uses a peculiar
debugging format which GNU CC does not know about.  There are preliminary
versions of GAS and GDB for the HP-PA which do work with GNU CC for 
debugging.  You can get them by anonymous ftp from <CODE>jaguar.cs.utah.edu</CODE>

compiler.  This compiler will have the same characteristics as the usual
stage 2 compiler on other systems.  Use it to make a stage 4 compiler

<H2> 3.7 Installing GNU CC on VMS </H2>
<!--docid::SEC43::-->
<P>

The VMS version of GNU CC is distributed in a backup saveset containing
both source code and precompiled binaries.
</P><P>

To install the <TT>`gcc'</TT> command so you can use the compiler easily, in
the same manner as you use the VMS C compiler, you must install the VMS CLD
file for GNU CC as follows:
</P><P>

<OL>
<LI>
Define the VMS logical names <SAMP>`GNU_CC'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`GNU_CC_INCLUDE'</SAMP>
to point to the directories where the GNU CC executables
(<TT>`gcc-cpp.exe'</TT>, <TT>`gcc-cc1.exe'</TT>, etc.) and the C include files are
kept respectively.  This should be done with the commands:<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>$ assign /system /translation=concealed -
  disk:[gcc.] gnu_cc
$ assign /system /translation=concealed -
  disk:[gcc.include.] gnu_cc_include
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

with the appropriate disk and directory names.  These commands can be
placed in your system startup file so they will be executed whenever
the machine is rebooted.  You may, if you choose, do this via the
<TT>`GCC_INSTALL.COM'</TT> script in the <TT>`[GCC]'</TT> directory.
</P><P>

<LI>
Install the <TT>`GCC'</TT> command with the command line:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>$ set command /table=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables -
  /output=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables gnu_cc:[000000]gcc
$ install replace sys$common:[syslib]dcltables
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<LI>
To install the help file, do the following:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>$ library/help sys$library:helplib.hlb gcc.hlp
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Now you can invoke the compiler with a command like <SAMP>`gcc /verbose
file.c'</SAMP>, which is equivalent to the command <SAMP>`gcc -v -c file.c'</SAMP> in
Unix.
</OL>
<P>

If you wish to use GNU C++ you must first install GNU CC, and then
perform the following steps:
</P><P>

<OL>
<LI>
Define the VMS logical name <SAMP>`GNU_GXX_INCLUDE'</SAMP> to point to the
directory where the preprocessor will search for the C++ header files.
This can be done with the command:<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>$ assign /system /translation=concealed -
  disk:[gcc.gxx_include.] gnu_gxx_include
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

with the appropriate disk and directory name.  If you are going to be
using libg++, this is where the libg++ install procedure will install
the libg++ header files.
</P><P>

<LI>
Obtain the file <TT>`gcc-cc1plus.exe'</TT>, and place this in the same
directory that <TT>`gcc-cc1.exe'</TT> is kept.
<P>

The GNU C++ compiler can be invoked with a command like <SAMP>`gcc /plus
/verbose file.cc'</SAMP>, which is equivalent to the command <SAMP>`g++ -v -c
file.cc'</SAMP> in Unix.
</OL>
<P>

We try to put corresponding binaries and sources on the VMS distribution
tape.  But sometimes the binaries will be from an older version than the
sources, because we don't always have time to update them.  (Use the
<SAMP>`/version'</SAMP> option to determine the version number of the binaries and
compare it with the source file <TT>`version.c'</TT> to tell whether this is
so.)  In this case, you should use the binaries you get to recompile the
sources.  If you must recompile, here is how:
</P><P>

<OL>
<LI>
Execute the command procedure <TT>`vmsconfig.com'</TT> to copy files
<TT>`vax-vms.h'</TT>, <TT>`xm-vax-vms.h'</TT>, <TT>`vax.c'</TT> and <TT>`vax.md'</TT> to
<TT>`tm.h'</TT>, <TT>`config.h'</TT>, <TT>`aux-output.c'</TT>, and <TT>`md.'</TT>
respectively, and to create files <TT>`tconfig.h'</TT> and
<TT>`hconfig.h'</TT>.  This procedure also creates several linker option
files used by <TT>`make-cc1.com'</TT> and a data file used by
<TT>`make-l2.com'</TT>.<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>$ @vmsconfig.com
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<LI>
Setup the logical names and command tables as defined above.  In
addition, define the VMS logical name <SAMP>`GNU_BISON'</SAMP> to point at the
to the directories where the Bison executable is kept.  This should be
done with the command:<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>$ assign /system /translation=concealed -
  disk:[bison.] gnu_bison
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

You may, if you choose, use the <TT>`INSTALL_BISON.COM'</TT> script in the
<TT>`[BISON]'</TT> directory.
</P><P>

<LI>
Install the <SAMP>`BISON'</SAMP> command with the command line:<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>$ set command /table=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables -
  /output=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables -
  gnu_bison:[000000]bison
$ install replace sys$common:[syslib]dcltables
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<LI>
Type <SAMP>`@make-gcc'</SAMP> to recompile everything (alternatively, you may
submit the file <TT>`make-gcc.com'</TT> to a batch queue).  If you wish to
build the GNU C++ compiler as well as the GNU CC compiler, you must
first edit <TT>`make-gcc.com'</TT> and follow the instructions that appear
in the comments.<P>

<LI>
In order to use GCC, you need a library of functions which GCC compiled code
will call to perform certain tasks, and these functions are defined in the
file <TT>`libgcc2.c'</TT>.  To compile this you should use the command procedure
<TT>`make-l2.com'</TT>, which will generate the library <TT>`libgcc2.olb'</TT>.
<TT>`libgcc2.olb'</TT> should be built using the compiler built from
the same distribution that <TT>`libgcc2.c'</TT> came from, and
<TT>`make-gcc.com'</TT> will automatically do all of this for you.
<P>

To install the library, use the following commands:</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>$ library gnu_cc:[000000]gcclib/delete=(new,eprintf)
$ library libgcc2/extract=*/output=libgcc2.obj
$ library gnu_cc:[000000]gcclib libgcc2.obj
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The first command simply removes old modules that will be replaced with modules
from libgcc2.  If the VMS librarian complains about those modules not being
present, simply ignore the message and continue on with the next command.
</P><P>

Whenever you update the compiler on your system, you should also update the
library with the above procedure.
</P><P>

<LI>
You may wish to build GCC in such a way that no files are written to the
directory where the source files reside.  An example would be the when
the source files are on a read-only disk.  In these cases, execute the
following DCL commands (substituting your actual path names):
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>$ assign dua0:[gcc.build_dir.]/translation=concealed, -
         dua1:[gcc.source_dir.]/translation=concealed  gcc_build
$ set default gcc_build:[000000]
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

where <TT>`dua1:[gcc.source_dir]'</TT>
contains the source code, and
<TT>`dua0:[gcc.build_dir]'</TT> is meant to contain all of the generated object
files and executables.  Once you have done this, you can proceed building GCC
as described above.  (Keep in mind that <TT>`gcc_build'</TT> is a rooted logical
name, and thus the device names in each element of the search list must be an
actual physical device name rather than another rooted logical name).
</P><P>

<LI>
<STRONG>If you are building GNU CC with a previous version of GNU CC,
you also should check to see that you have the newest version of the
assembler</STRONG>.  In particular, GNU CC version 2 treats global constant
variables slightly differently from GNU CC version 1, and GAS version
1.38.1 does not have the patches required to work with GCC version 2.
If you use GAS 1.38.1, then <CODE>extern const</CODE> variables will not have
the read-only bit set, and the linker will generate warning messages
about mismatched psect attributes for these variables.  These warning
messages are merely a nuisance, and can safely be ignored.
<P>

If you are compiling with a version of GNU CC older than 1.33, specify
<SAMP>`/DEFINE=("inline=")'</SAMP> as an option in all the compilations.  This
requires editing all the <CODE>gcc</CODE> commands in <TT>`make-cc1.com'</TT>.
(The older versions had problems supporting <CODE>inline</CODE>.)  Once you
have a working 1.33 or newer GNU CC, you can change this file back.
</P><P>

<LI>
If you want to build GNU CC with the VAX C compiler, you will need to
make minor changes in <TT>`make-cccp.com'</TT> and <TT>`make-cc1.com'</TT>
to choose alternate definitions of <CODE>CC</CODE>, <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>, and
<CODE>LIBS</CODE>.  See comments in those files.  However, you must
also have a working version of the GNU assembler (GNU as, aka GAS) as
it is used as the back-end for GNU CC to produce binary object modules
and is not included in the GNU CC sources.  GAS is also needed to
compile <TT>`libgcc2'</TT> in order to build <TT>`gcclib'</TT> (see above);
<TT>`make-l2.com'</TT> expects to be able to find it operational in
<TT>`gnu_cc:[000000]gnu-as.exe'</TT>.
<P>

To use GNU CC on VMS, you need the VMS driver programs
<TT>`gcc.exe'</TT>, <TT>`gcc.com'</TT>, and <TT>`gcc.cld'</TT>.  They are
distributed with the VMS binaries (<TT>`gcc-vms'</TT>) rather than the
GNU CC sources.  GAS is also included in <TT>`gcc-vms'</TT>, as is Bison.
</P><P>

Once you have successfully built GNU CC with VAX C, you should use the
resulting compiler to rebuild itself.  Before doing this, be sure to
restore the <CODE>CC</CODE>, <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>, and <CODE>LIBS</CODE> definitions in
<TT>`make-cccp.com'</TT> and <TT>`make-cc1.com'</TT>.  The second generation
compiler will be able to take advantage of many optimizations that must
be suppressed when building with other compilers.
</OL>
<P>

Under previous versions of GNU CC, the generated code would occasionally
give strange results when linked with the sharable <TT>`VAXCRTL'</TT> library.
Now this should work.
</P><P>

Even with this version, however, GNU CC itself should not be linked with
the sharable <TT>`VAXCRTL'</TT>.  The version of <CODE>qsort</CODE> in
<TT>`VAXCRTL'</TT> has a bug (known to be present in VMS versions V4.6
through V5.5) which causes the compiler to fail.
</P><P>

The executables that are generated by <TT>`make-cc1.com'</TT> and
<TT>`make-cccp.com'</TT> use the object library version of <TT>`VAXCRTL'</TT> in
order to make use of the <CODE>qsort</CODE> routine in <TT>`gcclib.olb'</TT>.  If
you wish to link the compiler executables with the shareable image
version of <TT>`VAXCRTL'</TT>, you should edit the file <TT>`tm.h'</TT> (created
by <TT>`vmsconfig.com'</TT>) to define the macro <CODE>QSORT_WORKAROUND</CODE>.
</P><P>

<CODE>QSORT_WORKAROUND</CODE> is always defined when GNU CC is compiled with
VAX C, to avoid a problem in case <TT>`gcclib.olb'</TT> is not yet
available.

The system's compiler produces bad code for some of the GNU CC
optimization files.  So you must build the stage 2 compiler without
optimization.  Then build a stage 3 compiler with optimization.
That executable should work.  Here are the necessary commands:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>make LANGUAGES=c CC=stage1/xgcc CFLAGS="-Bstage1/ -g"
make stage2
make CC=stage2/xgcc CFLAGS="-Bstage2/ -g -O"
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

You may need to raise the ULIMIT setting to build a C++ compiler,
as the file <TT>`cc1plus'</TT> is larger than one megabyte.

<H2> 3.9 Installing GNU CC on the MIPS </H2>
<!--docid::SEC45::-->
See <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC36">3. Installing GNU CC</A> about whether to use <SAMP>`--with-stabs'</SAMP> or
not.
<P>

The MIPS C compiler needs to be told to increase its table size
for switch statements with the <SAMP>`-Wf,-XNg1500'</SAMP> option in
order to compile <TT>`cp-parse.c'</TT>.  If you use the <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP>
optimization option, you also need to use <SAMP>`-Olimit 3000'</SAMP>.
Both of these options are automatically generated in the
<TT>`Makefile'</TT> that the shell script <TT>`configure'</TT> builds.
If you override the <CODE>CC</CODE> make variable and use the MIPS
compilers, you may need to add <SAMP>`-Wf,-XNg1500 -Olimit 3000'</SAMP>.

MIPS computers running RISC-OS can support four different
personalities: default, BSD 4.3, System V.3, and System V.4
(older versions of RISC-OS don't support V.4).  To configure GCC
for these platforms use the following configurations:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`mips-mips-riscos<CODE>rev</CODE>'</SAMP>
<DD>Default configuration for RISC-OS, revision <CODE>rev</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`mips-mips-riscos<CODE>rev</CODE>bsd'</SAMP>
<DD>BSD 4.3 configuration for RISC-OS, revision <CODE>rev</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`mips-mips-riscos<CODE>rev</CODE>sysv4'</SAMP>
<DD>System V.4 configuration for RISC-OS, revision <CODE>rev</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`mips-mips-riscos<CODE>rev</CODE>sysv'</SAMP>
<DD>System V.3 configuration for RISC-OS, revision <CODE>rev</CODE>.
</DL>
<P>

The revision <CODE>rev</CODE> mentioned above is the revision of
RISC-OS to use.  You must reconfigure GCC when going from a
RISC-OS revision 4 to RISC-OS revision 5.  This has the effect of
avoiding a linker
bug (see <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC82">5.2 Installation Problems</A> for more details).
</P><P>

DECstations can support three different personalities: Ultrix,
DEC OSF/1, and OSF/rose.  To configure GCC for these platforms
use the following configurations:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`decstation-ultrix'</SAMP>

GNU C provides several language features not found in ANSI standard C.
(The <SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> option directs GNU CC to print a warning message if
any of these features is used.)  To test for the availability of these
features in conditional compilation, check for a predefined macro
<CODE>__GNUC__</CODE>, which is always defined under GNU CC.

<H2> 4.1 Statements and Declarations within Expressions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC47::-->
<P>

A compound statement enclosed in parentheses may appear as an expression
in GNU C.  This allows you to use loops, switches, and local variables
within an expression.
</P><P>

Recall that a compound statement is a sequence of statements surrounded
by braces; in this construct, parentheses go around the braces.  For
example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>({ int y = foo (); int z;
   if (y &#62; 0) z = y;
   else z = - y;
   z; })
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

is a valid (though slightly more complex than necessary) expression
for the absolute value of <CODE>foo ()</CODE>.
</P><P>

The last thing in the compound statement should be an expression
followed by a semicolon; the value of this subexpression serves as the
value of the entire construct.  (If you use some other kind of statement
last within the braces, the construct has type <CODE>void</CODE>, and thus
effectively no value.)
</P><P>

This feature is especially useful in making macro definitions "safe" (so
that they evaluate each operand exactly once).  For example, the
"maximum" function is commonly defined as a macro in standard C as
follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define max(a,b) ((a) &#62; (b) ? (a) : (b))
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX84"></A>
But this definition computes either <VAR>a</VAR> or <VAR>b</VAR> twice, with bad
results if the operand has side effects.  In GNU C, if you know the
type of the operands (here let's assume <CODE>int</CODE>), you can define
the macro safely as follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define maxint(a,b) \
  ({int _a = (a), _b = (b); _a &#62; _b ? _a : _b; })
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Embedded statements are not allowed in constant expressions, such as
the value of an enumeration constant, the width of a bit field, or
the initial value of a static variable.
</P><P>

If you don't know the type of the operand, you can still do this, but you
must use <CODE>typeof</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC52">4.6 Referring to a Type with <CODE>typeof</CODE></A>) or type naming (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC51">4.5 Naming an Expression's Type</A>).

<H2> 4.2 Locally Declared Labels </H2>
<!--docid::SEC48::-->
<P>

Each statement expression is a scope in which <EM>local labels</EM> can be
declared.  A local label is simply an identifier; you can jump to it
with an ordinary <CODE>goto</CODE> statement, but only from within the
statement expression it belongs to.
</P><P>

A local label declaration looks like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>__label__ <VAR>label</VAR>;
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

or
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>__label__ <VAR>label1</VAR>, <VAR>label2</VAR>, <small>...</small>;
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Local label declarations must come at the beginning of the statement
expression, right after the <SAMP>`({'</SAMP>, before any ordinary
declarations.
</P><P>

The label declaration defines the label <EM>name</EM>, but does not define
the label itself.  You must do this in the usual way, with
<CODE><VAR>label</VAR>:</CODE>, within the statements of the statement expression.
</P><P>

The local label feature is useful because statement expressions are
often used in macros.  If the macro contains nested loops, a <CODE>goto</CODE>
can be useful for breaking out of them.  However, an ordinary label
whose scope is the whole function cannot be used: if the macro can be
expanded several times in one function, the label will be multiply
defined in that function.  A local label avoids this problem.  For
example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define SEARCH(array, target)                     \
({                                               \
  __label__ found;                                \
  typeof (target) _SEARCH_target = (target);      \
  typeof (*(array)) *_SEARCH_array = (array);     \
  int i, j;                                       \
  int value;                                      \
  for (i = 0; i &#60; max; i++)                       \
    for (j = 0; j &#60; max; j++)                     \
      if (_SEARCH_array[i][j] == _SEARCH_target)  \
        { value = i; goto found; }              \
  value = -1;                                     \

<P>

You can get the address of a label defined in the current function
(or a containing function) with the unary operator <SAMP>`&#38;&#38;'</SAMP>.  The
value has type <CODE>void *</CODE>.  This value is a constant and can be used 
wherever a constant of that type is valid.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>void *ptr;
<small>...</small>
ptr = &#38;&#38;foo;
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

To use these values, you need to be able to jump to one.  This is done
with the computed goto statement<A NAME="DOCF1" HREF="gcc.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>, <CODE>goto *<VAR>exp</VAR>;</CODE>.  For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>goto *ptr;
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Any expression of type <CODE>void *</CODE> is allowed.
</P><P>

One way of using these constants is in initializing a static array that
will serve as a jump table:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>static void *array[] = { &#38;&#38;foo, &#38;&#38;bar, &#38;&#38;hack };
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Then you can select a label with indexing, like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>goto *array[i];
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Note that this does not check whether the subscript is in bounds--array
indexing in C never does that.
</P><P>

Such an array of label values serves a purpose much like that of the
<CODE>switch</CODE> statement.  The <CODE>switch</CODE> statement is cleaner, so
use that rather than an array unless the problem does not fit a
<CODE>switch</CODE> statement very well.
</P><P>

Another use of label values is in an interpreter for threaded code.
The labels within the interpreter function can be stored in the
threaded code for super-fast dispatching.  
</P><P>

You can use this mechanism to jump to code in a different function.  If
you do that, totally unpredictable things will happen.  The best way to
avoid this is to store the label address only in automatic variables and
never pass it as an argument.

<H2> 4.4 Nested Functions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC50::-->
<P>

A <EM>nested function</EM> is a function defined inside another function.
The nested function's name is local to the block where it is defined.
For example, here we define a nested function named <CODE>square</CODE>,
and call it twice:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>foo (double a, double b)
{
  double square (double z) { return z * z; }

  return square (a) + square (b);
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The nested function can access all the variables of the containing
function that are visible at the point of its definition.  This is
called <EM>lexical scoping</EM>.  For example, here we show a nested
function which uses an inherited variable named <CODE>offset</CODE>:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
{
  int access (int *array, int index)
    { return array[index + offset]; }
  int i;
  <small>...</small>
  for (i = 0; i &#60; size; i++)
    <small>...</small> access (array, i) <small>...</small>
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

It is possible to call the nested function from outside the scope of its
name by storing its address or passing the address to another function:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>hack (int *array, int size)
{
  void store (int index, int value)
    { array[index] = value; }

  intermediate (store, size);
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here, the function <CODE>intermediate</CODE> receives the address of
<CODE>store</CODE> as an argument.  If <CODE>intermediate</CODE> calls
<CODE>store</CODE>, the arguments given to <CODE>store</CODE> are used to store
into <CODE>array</CODE>.  But this technique works only so long as the
containing function (<CODE>hack</CODE>, in this example) does not exit.  If
you try to call the nested function through its address after the
containing function has exited, all hell will break loose.
</P><P>

GNU CC implements taking the address of a nested function using a
technique called <EM>trampolines</EM>.  A paper describing them is
available from <SAMP>`maya.idiap.ch'</SAMP> in the file
<TT>`pub/tmb/usenix88-lexic.ps.Z'</TT>.
</P><P>

A nested function can jump to a label inherited from a containing
function, provided the label was explicitly declared in the containing
function (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC48">4.2 Locally Declared Labels</A>).  Such a jump returns instantly to the
containing function, exiting the nested function which did the
<CODE>goto</CODE> and any intermediate functions as well.  Here is an example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
{
  __label__ failure;
  int access (int *array, int index)
    {
      if (index &#62; size)
        goto failure;
      return array[index + offset];
    }
  int i;
  <small>...</small>
  for (i = 0; i &#60; size; i++)
    <small>...</small> access (array, i) <small>...</small>
  <small>...</small>
  return 0;

 /* Control comes here from <CODE>access</CODE>
    if it detects an error.  */
 failure:
  return -1;
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

A nested function always has internal linkage.  Declaring one with
<CODE>extern</CODE> is erroneous.  If you need to declare the nested function
before its definition, use <CODE>auto</CODE> (which is otherwise meaningless
for function declarations).
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
{
  __label__ failure;
  auto int access (int *, int);
  <small>...</small>
  int access (int *array, int index)
    {
      if (index &#62; size)
        goto failure;
      return array[index + offset];
    }
  <small>...</small>
}

<H2> 4.5 Naming an Expression's Type </H2>
<!--docid::SEC51::-->
<P>

You can give a name to the type of an expression using a <CODE>typedef</CODE>
declaration with an initializer.  Here is how to define <VAR>name</VAR> as a
type name for the type of <VAR>exp</VAR>:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>typedef <VAR>name</VAR> = <VAR>exp</VAR>;
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This is useful in conjunction with the statements-within-expressions
feature.  Here is how the two together can be used to define a safe
"maximum" macro that operates on any arithmetic type:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define max(a,b) \
  ({typedef _ta = (a), _tb = (b);  \
    _ta _a = (a); _tb _b = (b);     \
    _a &#62; _b ? _a : _b; })
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX85"></A>
<A NAME="IDX86"></A>
<A NAME="IDX87"></A>
<A NAME="IDX88"></A>
<A NAME="IDX89"></A>
</P><P>

The reason for using names that start with underscores for the local
variables is to avoid conflicts with variable names that occur within the
expressions that are substituted for <CODE>a</CODE> and <CODE>b</CODE>.  Eventually we
hope to design a new form of declaration syntax that allows you to declare
variables whose scopes start only after their initializers; this will be a
more reliable way to prevent such conflicts.

<H2> 4.6 Referring to a Type with <CODE>typeof</CODE> </H2>
<!--docid::SEC52::-->
<P>

Another way to refer to the type of an expression is with <CODE>typeof</CODE>.
The syntax of using of this keyword looks like <CODE>sizeof</CODE>, but the
construct acts semantically like a type name defined with <CODE>typedef</CODE>.
</P><P>

There are two ways of writing the argument to <CODE>typeof</CODE>: with an
expression or with a type.  Here is an example with an expression:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>typeof (x[0](1))
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This assumes that <CODE>x</CODE> is an array of functions; the type described
is that of the values of the functions.
</P><P>

Here is an example with a typename as the argument:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>typeof (int *)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here the type described is that of pointers to <CODE>int</CODE>.
</P><P>

If you are writing a header file that must work when included in ANSI C
programs, write <CODE>__typeof__</CODE> instead of <CODE>typeof</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC78">4.30 Alternate Keywords</A>.
</P><P>

A <CODE>typeof</CODE>-construct can be used anywhere a typedef name could be
used.  For example, you can use it in a declaration, in a cast, or inside
of <CODE>sizeof</CODE> or <CODE>typeof</CODE>.
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
This declares <CODE>y</CODE> with the type of what <CODE>x</CODE> points to.
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>typeof (*x) y;
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<LI>
This declares <CODE>y</CODE> as an array of such values.
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>typeof (*x) y[4];
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<LI>
This declares <CODE>y</CODE> as an array of pointers to characters:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>typeof (typeof (char *)[4]) y;
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

It is equivalent to the following traditional C declaration:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>char *y[4];
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

To see the meaning of the declaration using <CODE>typeof</CODE>, and why it
might be a useful way to write, let's rewrite it with these macros:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define pointer(T)  typeof(T *)
#define array(T, N) typeof(T [N])
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Now the declaration can be rewritten this way:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>array (pointer (char), 4) y;
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Thus, <CODE>array (pointer (char), 4)</CODE> is the type of arrays of 4
pointers to <CODE>char</CODE>.

<H2> 4.7 Generalized Lvalues </H2>
<!--docid::SEC53::-->
Compound expressions, conditional expressions and casts are allowed as
lvalues provided their operands are lvalues.  This means that you can take
their addresses or store values into them.
<P>

For example, a compound expression can be assigned, provided the last
expression in the sequence is an lvalue.  These two expressions are
equivalent:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(a, b) += 5
a, (b += 5)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Similarly, the address of the compound expression can be taken.  These two
expressions are equivalent:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>&#38;(a, b)
a, &#38;b
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

A conditional expression is a valid lvalue if its type is not void and the
true and false branches are both valid lvalues.  For example, these two
expressions are equivalent:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(a ? b : c) = 5
(a ? b = 5 : (c = 5))
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

A cast is a valid lvalue if its operand is an lvalue.  A simple
assignment whose left-hand side is a cast works by converting the
right-hand side first to the specified type, then to the type of the
inner left-hand side expression.  After this is stored, the value is
converted back to the specified type to become the value of the
assignment.  Thus, if <CODE>a</CODE> has type <CODE>char *</CODE>, the following two
expressions are equivalent:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(int)a = 5
(int)(a = (char *)(int)5)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

An assignment-with-arithmetic operation such as <SAMP>`+='</SAMP> applied to a cast
performs the arithmetic using the type resulting from the cast, and then
continues as in the previous case.  Therefore, these two expressions are
equivalent:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(int)a += 5
(int)(a = (char *)(int) ((int)a + 5))
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

You cannot take the address of an lvalue cast, because the use of its
address would not work out coherently.  Suppose that <CODE>&#38;(int)f</CODE> were
permitted, where <CODE>f</CODE> has type <CODE>float</CODE>.  Then the following
statement would try to store an integer bit-pattern where a floating
point number belongs:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>*&#38;(int)f = 1;
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This is quite different from what <CODE>(int)f = 1</CODE> would do--that
would convert 1 to floating point and store it.  Rather than cause this
inconsistency, we think it is better to prohibit use of <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> on a cast.
</P><P>

If you really do want an <CODE>int *</CODE> pointer with the address of
<CODE>f</CODE>, you can simply write <CODE>(int *)&#38;f</CODE>.

<H2> 4.8 Conditional Expressions with Omitted Operands </H2>
<!--docid::SEC54::-->
<P>

The middle operand in a conditional expression may be omitted.  Then
if the first operand is nonzero, its value is the value of the conditional
expression.
</P><P>

Therefore, the expression
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>x ? : y
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

has the value of <CODE>x</CODE> if that is nonzero; otherwise, the value of
<CODE>y</CODE>.
</P><P>

This example is perfectly equivalent to
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>x ? x : y
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX90"></A>
<A NAME="IDX91"></A>
In this simple case, the ability to omit the middle operand is not
especially useful.  When it becomes useful is when the first operand does,
or may (if it is a macro argument), contain a side effect.  Then repeating
the operand in the middle would perform the side effect twice.  Omitting
the middle operand uses the value already computed without the undesirable
effects of recomputing it.

<H2> 4.9 Double-Word Integers </H2>
<!--docid::SEC55::-->
<P>

GNU C supports data types for integers that are twice as long as
<CODE>long int</CODE>.  Simply write <CODE>long long int</CODE> for a signed
integer, or <CODE>unsigned long long int</CODE> for an unsigned integer.
</P><P>

You can use these types in arithmetic like any other integer types.
Addition, subtraction, and bitwise boolean operations on these types
are open-coded on all types of machines.  Multiplication is open-coded
if the machine supports fullword-to-doubleword a widening multiply
instruction.  Division and shifts are open-coded only on machines that
provide special support.  The operations that are not open-coded use
special library routines that come with GNU CC.
</P><P>

There may be pitfalls when you use <CODE>long long</CODE> types for function
arguments, unless you declare function prototypes.  If a function
expects type <CODE>int</CODE> for its argument, and you pass a value of type
<CODE>long long int</CODE>, confusion will result because the caller and the
subroutine will disagree about the number of bytes for the argument.
Likewise, if the function expects <CODE>long long int</CODE> and you pass
<CODE>int</CODE>.  The best way to avoid such problems is to use prototypes.

<H2> 4.10 Arrays of Length Zero </H2>
<!--docid::SEC56::-->
<P>

Zero-length arrays are allowed in GNU C.  They are very useful as the last
element of a structure which is really a header for a variable-length
object:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>struct line {
  int length;
  char contents[0];
};

{
  struct line *thisline = (struct line *)
    malloc (sizeof (struct line) + this_length);
  thisline-&#62;length = this_length;
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In standard C, you would have to give <CODE>contents</CODE> a length of 1, which
means either you waste space or complicate the argument to <CODE>malloc</CODE>.

<H2> 4.11 Arrays of Variable Length </H2>
<!--docid::SEC57::-->
<P>

Variable-length automatic arrays are allowed in GNU C.  These arrays are
declared like any other automatic arrays, but with a length that is not
a constant expression.  The storage is allocated at the point of
declaration and deallocated when the brace-level is exited.  For
example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>FILE *
concat_fopen (char *s1, char *s2, char *mode)
{
  char str[strlen (s1) + strlen (s2) + 1];
  strcpy (str, s1);
  strcat (str, s2);
  return fopen (str, mode);
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX92"></A>
<A NAME="IDX93"></A>
<A NAME="IDX94"></A>
Jumping or breaking out of the scope of the array name deallocates the
storage.  Jumping into the scope is not allowed; you get an error
message for it.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX95"></A>
You can use the function <CODE>alloca</CODE> to get an effect much like
variable-length arrays.  The function <CODE>alloca</CODE> is available in
many other C implementations (but not in all).  On the other hand,
variable-length arrays are more elegant.
</P><P>

There are other differences between these two methods.  Space allocated
with <CODE>alloca</CODE> exists until the containing <EM>function</EM> returns.
The space for a variable-length array is deallocated as soon as the array
name's scope ends.  (If you use both variable-length arrays and
<CODE>alloca</CODE> in the same function, deallocation of a variable-length array
will also deallocate anything more recently allocated with <CODE>alloca</CODE>.)
</P><P>

You can also use variable-length arrays as arguments to functions:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>struct entry
tester (int len, char data[len][len])
{
  <small>...</small>
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The length of an array is computed once when the storage is allocated
and is remembered for the scope of the array in case you access it with
<CODE>sizeof</CODE>.
</P><P>

If you want to pass the array first and the length afterward, you can
use a forward declaration in the parameter list--another GNU extension.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>struct entry
tester (int len; char data[len][len], int len)
{
  <small>...</small>
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX96"></A>
The <SAMP>`int len'</SAMP> before the semicolon is a <EM>parameter forward
declaration</EM>, and it serves the purpose of making the name <CODE>len</CODE>
known when the declaration of <CODE>data</CODE> is parsed.
</P><P>

You can write any number of such parameter forward declarations in the
parameter list.  They can be separated by commas or semicolons, but the
last one must end with a semicolon, which is followed by the "real"
parameter declarations.  Each forward declaration must match a "real"
declaration in parameter name and data type.

<H2> 4.12 Macros with Variable Numbers of Arguments </H2>
<!--docid::SEC58::-->
<P>

In GNU C, a macro can accept a variable number of arguments, much as a
function can.  The syntax for defining the macro looks much like that
used for a function.  Here is an example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define eprintf(format, args...)  \
 fprintf (stderr, format, ## args)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here <CODE>args</CODE> is a <EM>rest argument</EM>: it takes in zero or more
arguments, as many as the call contains.  All of them plus the commas
between them form the value of <CODE>args</CODE>, which is substituted into
the macro body where <CODE>args</CODE> is used.  Thus, we have these
expansions:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>eprintf ("%s:%d: ", input_file_name, line_number)
==>
fprintf (stderr, "%s:%d: ", input_file_name, line_number)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Note that the comma after the string constant comes from the definition
of <CODE>eprintf</CODE>, whereas the last comma comes from the value of
<CODE>args</CODE>.
</P><P>

The reason for using <SAMP>`##'</SAMP> is to handle the case when <CODE>args</CODE>
matches no arguments at all.  In this case, <CODE>args</CODE> has an empty
value.  In this case, the second comma in the definition becomes an
embarrassment: if it got through to the expansion of the macro, we would
get something like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>fprintf (stderr, "success!\n", )
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

which is invalid C syntax.  <SAMP>`##'</SAMP> gets rid of the comma, so we get
the following instead:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>fprintf (stderr, "success!\n")
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This is a special feature of the GNU C preprocessor: <SAMP>`##'</SAMP> adjacent
to a rest argument discards the token on the other side of the
<SAMP>`##'</SAMP>, if the rest argument value is empty.

<H2> 4.16 Constructor Expressions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC62::-->
<P>

GNU C supports constructor expressions.  A constructor looks like
a cast containing an initializer.  Its value is an object of the
type specified in the cast, containing the elements specified in
the initializer.
</P><P>

Usually, the specified type is a structure.  Assume that
<CODE>struct foo</CODE> and <CODE>structure</CODE> are declared as shown:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>struct foo {int a; char b[2];} structure;
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here is an example of constructing a <CODE>struct foo</CODE> with a constructor:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>structure = ((struct foo) {x + y, 'a', 0});
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This is equivalent to writing the following:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>{
  struct foo temp = {x + y, 'a', 0};
  structure = temp;
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

You can also construct an array.  If all the elements of the constructor
are (made up of) simple constant expressions, suitable for use in
initializers, then the constructor is an lvalue and can be coerced to a
pointer to its first element, as shown here:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>char **foo = (char *[]) { "x", "y", "z" };
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Array constructors whose elements are not simple constants are
not very useful, because the constructor is not an lvalue.  There
are only two valid ways to use it: to subscript it, or initialize
an array variable with it.  The former is probably slower than a
<CODE>switch</CODE> statement, while the latter does the same thing an
ordinary C initializer would do.  Here is an example of
subscripting an array constructor:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>output = ((int[]) { 2, x, 28 }) [input];
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Constructor expressions for scalar types and union types are is
also allowed, but then the constructor expression is equivalent
to a cast.

<H2> 4.17 Labeled Elements in Initializers </H2>
<!--docid::SEC63::-->
<P>

Standard C requires the elements of an initializer to appear in a fixed
order, the same as the order of the elements in the array or structure
being initialized.
</P><P>

In GNU C you can give the elements in any order, specifying the array
indices or structure field names they apply to.
</P><P>

To specify an array index, write <SAMP>`[<VAR>index</VAR>]'</SAMP> before the
element value.  For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>int a[6] = { [4] 29, [2] 15 };
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

is equivalent to
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>int a[6] = { 0, 0, 15, 0, 29, 0 };
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The index values must be constant expressions, even if the array being
initialized is automatic.
</P><P>

In a structure initializer, specify the name of a field to initialize
with <SAMP>`<VAR>fieldname</VAR>:'</SAMP> before the element value.  For example,
given the following structure, 
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>struct point { int x, y; };
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

the following initialization
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>struct point p = { y: yvalue, x: xvalue };
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

is equivalent to
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>struct point p = { xvalue, yvalue };
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

You can also use an element label when initializing a union, to
specify which element of the union should be used.  For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>union foo { int i; double d; };

union foo f = { d: 4 };
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

will convert 4 to a <CODE>double</CODE> to store it in the union using
the second element.  By contrast, casting 4 to type <CODE>union foo</CODE>
would store it into the union as the integer <CODE>i</CODE>, since it is
an integer.  (See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC65">4.19 Cast to a Union Type</A>.)
</P><P>

You can combine this technique of naming elements with ordinary C
initialization of successive elements.  Each initializer element that
does not have a label applies to the next consecutive element of the
array or structure.  For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>int a[6] = { [1] v1, v2, [4] v4 };
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

is equivalent to
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>int a[6] = { 0, v1, v2, 0, v4, 0 };
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Labeling the elements of an array initializer is especially useful
when the indices are characters or belong to an <CODE>enum</CODE> type.
For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>int whitespace[256]
  = { [' '] 1, ['\t'] 1, ['\h'] 1,
      ['\f'] 1, ['\n'] 1, ['\r'] 1 };

<H2> 4.19 Cast to a Union Type </H2>
<!--docid::SEC65::-->
<P>

A cast to union type is like any other cast, except that the type
specified is a union type.  You can specify the type either with
<CODE>union <VAR>tag</VAR></CODE> or with a typedef name.
</P><P>

The types that may be cast to the union type are those of the members
of the union.  Thus, given the following union and variables:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>union foo { int i; double d; };
int x;
double y;
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

both <CODE>x</CODE> and <CODE>y</CODE> can be cast to type <CODE>union</CODE> foo.
</P><P>

Using the cast as the right-hand side of an assignment to a variable of
union type is equivalent to storing in a member of the union:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>union foo u;
<small>...</small>
u = (union foo) x  ==  u.i = x
u = (union foo) y  ==  u.d = y
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

You can also use the union cast as a function argument:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>void hack (union foo);
<small>...</small>
hack ((union foo) x);
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<H2> 4.20 Declaring Attributes of Functions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC66::-->
<P>

In GNU C, you declare certain things about functions called in your program
which help the compiler optimize function calls.
</P><P>

A few standard library functions, such as <CODE>abort</CODE> and <CODE>exit</CODE>,
cannot return.  GNU CC knows this automatically.  Some programs define
their own functions that never return.  You can declare them
<CODE>volatile</CODE> to tell the compiler this fact.  For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>extern void volatile fatal ();

void
fatal (<small>...</small>)
{
  <small>...</small> /* Print error message. */ <small>...</small>
  exit (1);
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The <CODE>volatile</CODE> keyword tells the compiler to assume that
<CODE>fatal</CODE> cannot return.  This makes slightly better code, but more
importantly it helps avoid spurious warnings of uninitialized variables.
</P><P>

It does not make sense for a <CODE>volatile</CODE> function to have a return
type other than <CODE>void</CODE>.
</P><P>

Many functions do not examine any values except their arguments, and
have no effects except the return value.  Such a function can be subject
to common subexpression elimination and loop optimization just as an
arithmetic operator would be.  These functions should be declared
<CODE>const</CODE>.  For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>extern int const square ();
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

says that the hypothetical function <CODE>square</CODE> is safe to call
fewer times than the program says.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX98"></A>
Note that a function that has pointer arguments and examines the data
pointed to must <EM>not</EM> be declared <CODE>const</CODE>.  Likewise, a
function that calls a non-<CODE>const</CODE> function usually must not be
<CODE>const</CODE>.  It does not make sense for a <CODE>const</CODE> function to
return <CODE>void</CODE>.
</P><P>

We recommend placing the keyword <CODE>const</CODE> after the function's
return type.  It makes no difference in the example above, but when the
return type is a pointer, it is the only way to make the function itself
const.  For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>const char *mincp (int);
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

says that <CODE>mincp</CODE> returns <CODE>const char *</CODE>---a pointer to a
const object.  To declare <CODE>mincp</CODE> const, you must write this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>char * const mincp (int);
</pre></td></tr></table>  
<A NAME="IDX99"></A>
<A NAME="IDX100"></A>
Some people object to this feature, suggesting that ANSI C's
<CODE>#pragma</CODE> should be used instead.  There are two reasons for not
doing this.
</P><P>

<OL>
<LI>
It is impossible to generate <CODE>#pragma</CODE> commands from a macro.
<P>

<LI>
The <CODE>#pragma</CODE> command is just as likely as these keywords to mean
something else in another compiler.
</OL>
<P>

These two reasons apply to almost any application that might be proposed
for <CODE>#pragma</CODE>.  It is basically a mistake to use <CODE>#pragma</CODE> for
<EM>anything</EM>.
</P><P>

The keyword <CODE>__attribute__</CODE> allows you to specify special
attributes when making a declaration.  This keyword is followed by an
attribute specification inside double parentheses.  One attribute,
<CODE>format</CODE>, is currently defined for functions.  Others are
implemented for variables and structure fields (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC66">4.20 Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>).
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>format (<VAR>archetype</VAR>, <VAR>string-index</VAR>, <VAR>first-to-check</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX101"></A>
The <CODE>format</CODE> attribute specifies that a function takes <CODE>printf</CODE>
or <CODE>scanf</CODE> style arguments which should be type-checked against a
format string.  For example, the declaration:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>extern int
my_printf (void *my_object, const char *my_format, ...)
      __attribute__ ((format (printf, 2, 3)));
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to <CODE>my_printf</CODE>
for consistency with the <CODE>printf</CODE> style format string argument
<CODE>my_format</CODE>.
</P><P>

The parameter <VAR>archetype</VAR> determines how the format string is
interpreted, and should be either <CODE>printf</CODE> or <CODE>scanf</CODE>.  The
parameter <VAR>string-index</VAR> specifies which argument is the format
string argument (starting from 1), while <VAR>first-to-check</VAR> is the
number of the first argument to check against the format string.  For
functions where the arguments are not available to be checked (such as
<CODE>vprintf</CODE>), specify the third parameter as zero.  In this case the
compiler only checks the format string for consistency.
</P><P>

In the example above, the format string (<CODE>my_format</CODE>) is the second
argument of the function <CODE>my_print</CODE>, and the arguments to check
start with the third argument, so the correct parameters for the format
attribute are 2 and 3.
</P><P>

The <CODE>format</CODE> attribute allows you to identify your own functions
which take format strings as arguments, so that GNU CC can check the
calls to these functions for errors.  The compiler always checks formats
for the ANSI library functions <CODE>printf</CODE>, <CODE>fprintf</CODE>,
<CODE>sprintf</CODE>, <CODE>scanf</CODE>, <CODE>fscanf</CODE>, <CODE>sscanf</CODE>,
<CODE>vprintf</CODE>, <CODE>vfprintf</CODE> and <CODE>vsprintf</CODE> whenever such
warnings are requested (using <SAMP>`-Wformat'</SAMP>), so there is no need to
modify the header file <TT>`stdio.h'</TT>.

<H2> 4.21 Prototypes and Old-Style Function Definitions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC67::-->
<P>

GNU C extends ANSI C to allow a function prototype to override a later
old-style non-prototype definition.  Consider the following example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>/* Use prototypes unless the compiler is old-fashioned.  */
#if __STDC__
#define P(x) (x)
#else
#define P(x) ()
#endif

/* Prototype function declaration.  */
int isroot P((uid_t));

/* Old-style function definition.  */
int
isroot (x)   /* ??? lossage here ??? */
     uid_t x;
{
  return x == 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Suppose the type <CODE>uid_t</CODE> happens to be <CODE>short</CODE>.  ANSI C does
not allow this example, because subword arguments in old-style
non-prototype definitions are promoted.  Therefore in this example the
function definition's argument is really an <CODE>int</CODE>, which does not
match the prototype argument type of <CODE>short</CODE>.
</P><P>

This restriction of ANSI C makes it hard to write code that is portable
to traditional C compilers, because the programmer does not know
whether the <CODE>uid_t</CODE> type is <CODE>short</CODE>, <CODE>int</CODE>, or
<CODE>long</CODE>.  Therefore, in cases like these GNU C allows a prototype
to override a later old-style definition.  More precisely, in GNU C, a
function prototype argument type overrides the argument type specified
by a later old-style definition if the former type is the same as the
latter type before promotion.  Thus in GNU C the above example is
equivalent to the following:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>int isroot (uid_t);

int
isroot (uid_t x)
{
  return x == 0;
}

<H2> 4.22 Dollar Signs in Identifier Names </H2>
<!--docid::SEC68::-->
<P>

In GNU C, you may use dollar signs in identifier names.  This is because
many traditional C implementations allow such identifiers.
</P><P>

On some machines, dollar signs are allowed in identifiers if you specify
<SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP>.  On a few systems they are allowed by default,
even if you do not use <SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP>.  But they are never
allowed if you specify <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP>.

<H2> 4.24 Inquiring on Alignment of Types or Variables </H2>
<!--docid::SEC70::-->
<P>

The keyword <CODE>__alignof__</CODE> allows you to inquire about how an object
is aligned, or the minimum alignment usually required by a type.  Its
syntax is just like <CODE>sizeof</CODE>.
</P><P>

For example, if the target machine requires a <CODE>double</CODE> value to be
aligned on an 8-byte boundary, then <CODE>__alignof__ (double)</CODE> is 8.
This is true on many RISC machines.  On more traditional machine
designs, <CODE>__alignof__ (double)</CODE> is 4 or even 2.
</P><P>

Some machines never actually require alignment; they allow reference to any
data type even at an odd addresses.  For these machines, <CODE>__alignof__</CODE>
reports the <EM>recommended</EM> alignment of a type.
</P><P>

When the operand of <CODE>__alignof__</CODE> is an lvalue rather than a type, the
value is the largest alignment that the lvalue is known to have.  It may
have this alignment as a result of its data type, or because it is part of
a structure and inherits alignment from that structure. For example, after
this declaration:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>struct foo { int x; char y; } foo1;
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

the value of <CODE>__alignof__ (foo1.y)</CODE> is probably 2 or 4, the same as
<CODE>__alignof__ (int)</CODE>, even though the data type of <CODE>foo1.y</CODE>
does not itself demand any alignment.</P><P>

A related feature which lets you specify the alignment of an object is
<CODE>__attribute__ ((aligned (<VAR>alignment</VAR>)))</CODE>; see the following
section.

<H2> 4.25 Specifying Attributes of Variables </H2>
<!--docid::SEC71::-->
<P>

The keyword <CODE>__attribute__</CODE> allows you to specify special
attributes of variables or structure fields.  This keyword is followed
by an attribute specification inside double parentheses.  Four
attributes are currently defined: <CODE>aligned</CODE>, <CODE>format</CODE>,
<CODE>mode</CODE> and <CODE>packed</CODE>.  <CODE>format</CODE> is used for functions,
and thus not documented here; see <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC66">4.20 Declaring Attributes of Functions</A>.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX102"></A>
<DT><CODE>aligned (<VAR>alignment</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>This attribute specifies the alignment of the variable or structure
field, measured in bytes.  For example, the declaration:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>int x __attribute__ ((aligned (16))) = 0;
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

causes the compiler to allocate the global variable <CODE>x</CODE> on a
16-byte boundary.  On a 68040, this could be used in conjunction with
an <CODE>asm</CODE> expression to access the <CODE>move16</CODE> instruction which
requires 16-byte aligned operands.
</P><P>

You can also specify the alignment of structure fields.  For example, to
create a double-word aligned <CODE>int</CODE> pair, you could write:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>struct foo { int x[2] __attribute__ ((aligned (8))); };
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This is an alternative to creating a union with a <CODE>double</CODE> member
that forces the union to be double-word aligned.
</P><P>

It is not possible to specify the alignment of functions; the alignment
of functions is determined by the machine's requirements and cannot be
changed.  You cannot specify alignment for a typedef name because such a
name is just an alias, not a distinct type.
</P><P>

The linker of your operating system imposes a maximum alignment.  If the
linker aligns each object file on a four byte boundary, then it is
beyond the compiler's power to cause anything to be aligned to a larger
boundary than that.  For example, if  the linker happens to put this object
file at address 136 (eight more than a multiple of 64), then the compiler
cannot guarantee an alignment of more than 8 just by aligning variables in
the object file.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>mode (<VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX103"></A>
This attribute specifies the data type for the declaration--whichever
type corresponds to the mode <VAR>mode</VAR>.  This in effect lets you
request an integer or floating point type according to its width.
<P>

<DT><CODE>packed</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX104"></A>
The <CODE>packed</CODE> attribute specifies that a variable or structure field
should have the smallest possible alignment--one byte for a variable,
and one bit for a field, unless you specify a larger value with the
<CODE>aligned</CODE> attribute.

<H2> 4.26 An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro </H2>
<!--docid::SEC72::-->
<P>

By declaring a function <CODE>inline</CODE>, you can direct GNU CC to
integrate that function's code into the code for its callers.  This
makes execution faster by eliminating the function-call overhead; in
addition, if any of the actual argument values are constant, their known
values may permit simplifications at compile time so that not all of the
inline function's code needs to be included.  Inlining of functions is
an optimization and it really "works" only in optimizing compilation.
If you don't use <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>, no function is really inline.
</P><P>

To declare a function inline, use the <CODE>inline</CODE> keyword in its
declaration, like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>inline int
inc (int *a)
{
  (*a)++;
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

(If you are writing a header file to be included in ANSI C programs, write
<CODE>__inline__</CODE> instead of <CODE>inline</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC78">4.30 Alternate Keywords</A>.)
</P><P>

You can also make all "simple enough" functions inline with the option
<SAMP>`-finline-functions'</SAMP>.  Note that certain usages in a function
definition can make it unsuitable for inline substitution.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX105"></A>
When a function is both inline and <CODE>static</CODE>, if all calls to the
function are integrated into the caller, and the function's address is
never used, then the function's own assembler code is never referenced.
In this case, GNU CC does not actually output assembler code for the
function, unless you specify the option <SAMP>`-fkeep-inline-functions'</SAMP>.
Some calls cannot be integrated for various reasons (in particular,
calls that precede the function's definition cannot be integrated, and
neither can recursive calls within the definition).  If there is a
nonintegrated call, then the function is compiled to assembler code as
usual.  The function must also be compiled as usual if the program
refers to its address, because that can't be inlined.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX106"></A>
When an inline function is not <CODE>static</CODE>, then the compiler must assume
that there may be calls from other source files; since a global symbol can
be defined only once in any program, the function must not be defined in
the other source files, so the calls therein cannot be integrated.
Therefore, a non-<CODE>static</CODE> inline function is always compiled on its
own in the usual fashion.
</P><P>

If you specify both <CODE>inline</CODE> and <CODE>extern</CODE> in the function
definition, then the definition is used only for inlining.  In no case
is the function compiled on its own, not even if you refer to its
address explicitly.  Such an address becomes an external reference, as
if you had only declared the function, and had not defined it.
</P><P>

This combination of <CODE>inline</CODE> and <CODE>extern</CODE> has almost the
effect of a macro.  The way to use it is to put a function definition in
a header file with these keywords, and put another copy of the
definition (lacking <CODE>inline</CODE> and <CODE>extern</CODE>) in a library file.
The definition in the header file will cause most calls to the function
to be inlined.  If any uses of the function remain, they will refer to
the single copy in the library.
</P><P>

GNU C does not inline any functions when not optimizing.  It is not
clear whether it is better to inline or not, in this case, but we found
that a correct implementation when not optimizing was difficult.  So we
did the easy thing, and turned it off.

<H2> 4.27 Assembler Instructions with C Expression Operands </H2>
<!--docid::SEC73::-->
<P>

In an assembler instruction using <CODE>asm</CODE>, you can now specify the
operands of the instruction using C expressions.  This means no more
guessing which registers or memory locations will contain the data you want
to use.
</P><P>

You must specify an assembler instruction template much like what appears
in a machine description, plus an operand constraint string for each
operand.
</P><P>

For example, here is how to use the 68881's <CODE>fsinx</CODE> instruction:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>asm ("fsinx %1,%0" : "=f" (result) : "f" (angle));
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here <CODE>angle</CODE> is the C expression for the input operand while
<CODE>result</CODE> is that of the output operand.  Each has <SAMP>`"f"'</SAMP> as its
operand constraint, saying that a floating point register is required.  The
<SAMP>`='</SAMP> in <SAMP>`=f'</SAMP> indicates that the operand is an output; all output
operands' constraints must use <SAMP>`='</SAMP>.  The constraints use the same
language used in the machine description (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC126">13.6 Operand Constraints</A>).
</P><P>

Each operand is described by an operand-constraint string followed by the C
expression in parentheses.  A colon separates the assembler template from
the first output operand, and another separates the last output operand
from the first input, if any.  Commas separate output operands and separate
inputs.  The total number of operands is limited to ten or to the maximum
number of operands in any instruction pattern in the machine description,
whichever is greater.
</P><P>

If there are no output operands, and there are input operands, then there
must be two consecutive colons surrounding the place where the output
operands would go.
</P><P>

Output operand expressions must be lvalues; the compiler can check this.
The input operands need not be lvalues.  The compiler cannot check whether
the operands have data types that are reasonable for the instruction being
executed.  It does not parse the assembler instruction template and does
not know what it means, or whether it is valid assembler input.  The
extended <CODE>asm</CODE> feature is most often used for machine instructions
that the compiler itself does not know exist.
</P><P>

The output operands must be write-only; GNU CC will assume that the values
in these operands before the instruction are dead and need not be
generated.  Extended asm does not support input-output or read-write
operands.  For this reason, the constraint character <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>, which
indicates such an operand, may not be used.
</P><P>

When the assembler instruction has a read-write operand, or an operand
in which only some of the bits are to be changed, you must logically
split its function into two separate operands, one input operand and one
write-only output operand.  The connection between them is expressed by
constraints which say they need to be in the same location when the
instruction executes.  You can use the same C expression for both
operands, or different expressions.  For example, here we write the
(fictitious) <SAMP>`combine'</SAMP> instruction with <CODE>bar</CODE> as its read-only
source operand and <CODE>foo</CODE> as its read-write destination:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>asm ("combine %2,%0" : "=r" (foo) : "0" (foo), "g" (bar));
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The constraint <SAMP>`"0"'</SAMP> for operand 1 says that it must occupy the same
location as operand 0.  A digit in constraint is allowed only in an input
operand, and it must refer to an output operand.
</P><P>

Only a digit in the constraint can guarantee that one operand will be in
the same place as another.  The mere fact that <CODE>foo</CODE> is the value of
both operands is not enough to guarantee that they will be in the same
place in the generated assembler code.  The following would not work:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>asm ("combine %2,%0" : "=r" (foo) : "r" (foo), "g" (bar));
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Various optimizations or reloading could cause operands 0 and 1 to be in
different registers; GNU CC knows no reason not to do so.  For example, the
compiler might find a copy of the value of <CODE>foo</CODE> in one register and
use it for operand 1, but generate the output operand 0 in a different
register (copying it afterward to <CODE>foo</CODE>'s own address).  Of course,
since the register for operand 1 is not even mentioned in the assembler
code, the result will not work, but GNU CC can't tell that.
</P><P>

Some instructions clobber specific hard registers.  To describe this, write
a third colon after the input operands, followed by the names of the
clobbered hard registers (given as strings).  Here is a realistic example
for the Vax:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>asm volatile ("movc3 %0,%1,%2"
              : /* no outputs */
              : "g" (from), "g" (to), "g" (count)
              : "r0", "r1", "r2", "r3", "r4", "r5");
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If you refer to a particular hardware register from the assembler code,
then you will probably have to list the register after the third colon
to tell the compiler that the register's value is modified.  In many
assemblers, the register names begin with <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>; to produce one
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> in the assembler code, you must write <SAMP>`%%'</SAMP> in the input.
</P><P>

If your assembler instruction can alter the condition code register,
add <SAMP>`cc'</SAMP> to the list of clobbered registers.  GNU CC on some
machines represents the condition codes as a specific hardware
register; <SAMP>`cc'</SAMP> serves to name this register.  On other machines,
the condition code is handled differently, and specifying <SAMP>`cc'</SAMP>
has no effect.  But it is valid no matter what the machine.
</P><P>

If your assembler instruction modifies memory in an unpredicable
fashion, add <SAMP>`memory'</SAMP> to the list of clobbered registers.
This will cause GNU CC to not keep memory values cached in
registers across the assembler instruction.
</P><P>

You can put multiple assembler instructions together in a single <CODE>asm</CODE>
template, separated either with newlines (written as <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>) or with
semicolons if the assembler allows such semicolons.  The GNU assembler
allows semicolons and all Unix assemblers seem to do so.  The input
operands are guaranteed not to use any of the clobbered registers, and
neither will the output operands' addresses, so you can read and write the
clobbered registers as many times as you like.  Here is an example of
multiple instructions in a template; it assumes that the subroutine
<CODE>_foo</CODE> accepts arguments in registers 9 and 10:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>asm ("movl %0,r9;movl %1,r10;call _foo"
     : /* no outputs */
     : "g" (from), "g" (to)
     : "r9", "r10");
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Unless an output operand has the <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> constraint modifier, GNU CC may
allocate it in the same register as an unrelated input operand, on the
assumption that the inputs are consumed before the outputs are produced.
This assumption may be false if the assembler code actually consists of
more than one instruction.  In such a case, use <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> for each output
operand that may not overlap an input.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC130">13.6.4 Constraint Modifier Characters</A>.
</P><P>

If you want to test the condition code produced by an assembler instruction,
you must include a branch and a label in the <CODE>asm</CODE> construct, as follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>asm ("clr %0;frob %1;beq 0f;mov #1,%0;0:"
     : "g" (result)
     : "g" (input));
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This assumes your assembler supports local labels, as the GNU assembler
and most Unix assemblers do.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX107"></A>
Usually the most convenient way to use these <CODE>asm</CODE> instructions is to
encapsulate them in macros that look like functions.  For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define sin(x)       \
({ double __value, __arg = (x);   \
   asm ("fsinx %1,%0": "=f" (__value): "f" (__arg));  \
   __value; })
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here the variable <CODE>__arg</CODE> is used to make sure that the instruction
operates on a proper <CODE>double</CODE> value, and to accept only those
arguments <CODE>x</CODE> which can convert automatically to a <CODE>double</CODE>.
</P><P>

Another way to make sure the instruction operates on the correct data type
is to use a cast in the <CODE>asm</CODE>.  This is different from using a
variable <CODE>__arg</CODE> in that it converts more different types.  For
example, if the desired type were <CODE>int</CODE>, casting the argument to
<CODE>int</CODE> would accept a pointer with no complaint, while assigning the
argument to an <CODE>int</CODE> variable named <CODE>__arg</CODE> would warn about
using a pointer unless the caller explicitly casts it.
</P><P>

If an <CODE>asm</CODE> has output operands, GNU CC assumes for optimization
purposes that the instruction has no side effects except to change the
output operands.  This does not mean that instructions with a side effect
cannot be used, but you must be careful, because the compiler may eliminate
them if the output operands aren't used, or move them out of loops, or
replace two with one if they constitute a common subexpression.  Also, if
your instruction does have a side effect on a variable that otherwise
appears not to change, the old value of the variable may be reused later if
it happens to be found in a register.
</P><P>

You can prevent an <CODE>asm</CODE> instruction from being deleted, moved
significantly, or combined, by writing the keyword <CODE>volatile</CODE> after
the <CODE>asm</CODE>.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define set_priority(x)  \
asm volatile ("set_priority %0": /* no outputs */ : "g" (x))
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

An instruction without output operands will not be deleted or moved
significantly, regardless, unless it is unreachable.
</P><P>

Note that even a volatile <CODE>asm</CODE> instruction can be moved in ways
that appear insignificant to the compiler, such as across jump
instructions.  You can't expect a sequence of volatile <CODE>asm</CODE>
instructions to remain perfectly consecutive.  If you want consecutive
output, use a single <CODE>asm</CODE>.
</P><P>

It is a natural idea to look for a way to give access to the condition
code left by the assembler instruction.  However, when we attempted to
implement this, we found no way to make it work reliably.  The problem
is that output operands might need reloading, which would result in
additional following "store" instructions.  On most machines, these
instructions would alter the condition code before there was time to
test it.  This problem doesn't arise for ordinary "test" and
"compare" instructions because they don't have any output operands.
</P><P>

If you are writing a header file that should be includable in ANSI C
programs, write <CODE>__asm__</CODE> instead of <CODE>asm</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC78">4.30 Alternate Keywords</A>.

<H2> 4.28 Controlling Names Used in Assembler Code </H2>
<!--docid::SEC74::-->
<P>

You can specify the name to be used in the assembler code for a C
function or variable by writing the <CODE>asm</CODE> (or <CODE>__asm__</CODE>)
keyword after the declarator as follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>int foo asm ("myfoo") = 2;
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This specifies that the name to be used for the variable <CODE>foo</CODE> in
the assembler code should be <SAMP>`myfoo'</SAMP> rather than the usual
<SAMP>`_foo'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

On systems where an underscore is normally prepended to the name of a C
function or variable, this feature allows you to define names for the
linker that do not start with an underscore.
</P><P>

You cannot use <CODE>asm</CODE> in this way in a function <EM>definition</EM>; but
you can get the same effect by writing a declaration for the function
before its definition and putting <CODE>asm</CODE> there, like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>extern func () asm ("FUNC");

func (x, y)
     int x, y;
<small>...</small>
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

It is up to you to make sure that the assembler names you choose do not
conflict with any other assembler symbols.  Also, you must not use a
register name; that would produce completely invalid assembler code.  GNU
CC does not as yet have the ability to store static variables in registers.
Perhaps that will be added.

GNU C allows you to put a few global variables into specified hardware
registers.  You can also specify the register in which an ordinary
register variable should be allocated.
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
Global register variables reserve registers throughout the program.
This may be useful in programs such as programming language
interpreters which have a couple of global variables that are accessed
very often.
<P>

<LI>
Local register variables in specific registers do not reserve the
registers.  The compiler's data flow analysis is capable of determining
where the specified registers contain live values, and where they are
available for other uses.
<P>

These local variables are sometimes convenient for use with the extended
<CODE>asm</CODE> feature (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC73">4.27 Assembler Instructions with C Expression Operands</A>), if you want to write one
output of the assembler instruction directly into a particular register.

<H3> 4.29.1 Defining Global Register Variables </H3>
<!--docid::SEC76::-->
<P>

You can define a global register variable in GNU C like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>register int *foo asm ("a5");
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here <CODE>a5</CODE> is the name of the register which should be used.  Choose a
register which is normally saved and restored by function calls on your
machine, so that library routines will not clobber it.
</P><P>

Naturally the register name is cpu-dependent, so you would need to
conditionalize your program according to cpu type.  The register
<CODE>a5</CODE> would be a good choice on a 68000 for a variable of pointer
type.  On machines with register windows, be sure to choose a "global"
register that is not affected magically by the function call mechanism.
</P><P>

In addition, operating systems on one type of cpu may differ in how they
name the registers; then you would need additional conditionals.  For
example, some 68000 operating systems call this register <CODE>%a5</CODE>.
</P><P>

Eventually there may be a way of asking the compiler to choose a register
automatically, but first we need to figure out how it should choose and
how to enable you to guide the choice.  No solution is evident.
</P><P>

Defining a global register variable in a certain register reserves that
register entirely for this use, at least within the current compilation.
The register will not be allocated for any other purpose in the functions
in the current compilation.  The register will not be saved and restored by
these functions.  Stores into this register are never deleted even if they
would appear to be dead, but references may be deleted or moved or
simplified.
</P><P>

It is not safe to access the global register variables from signal
handlers, or from more than one thread of control, because the system
library routines may temporarily use the register for other things (unless
you recompile them specially for the task at hand).

It is not safe for one function that uses a global register variable to
call another such function <CODE>foo</CODE> by way of a third function
<CODE>lose</CODE> that was compiled without knowledge of this variable (i.e. in a
different source file in which the variable wasn't declared).  This is
because <CODE>lose</CODE> might save the register and put some other value there.
For example, you can't expect a global register variable to be available in
the comparison-function that you pass to <CODE>qsort</CODE>, since <CODE>qsort</CODE>
might have put something else in that register.  (If you are prepared to
recompile <CODE>qsort</CODE> with the same global register variable, you can
solve this problem.)
</P><P>

If you want to recompile <CODE>qsort</CODE> or other source files which do not
actually use your global register variable, so that they will not use that
register for any other purpose, then it suffices to specify the compiler
option <SAMP>`-ffixed-<VAR>reg</VAR>'</SAMP>.  You need not actually add a global
register declaration to their source code.
</P><P>

A function which can alter the value of a global register variable cannot
safely be called from a function compiled without this variable, because it
could clobber the value the caller expects to find there on return.
Therefore, the function which is the entry point into the part of the
program that uses the global register variable must explicitly save and
restore the value which belongs to its caller.

On most machines, <CODE>longjmp</CODE> will restore to each global register
variable the value it had at the time of the <CODE>setjmp</CODE>.  On some
machines, however, <CODE>longjmp</CODE> will not change the value of global
register variables.  To be portable, the function that called <CODE>setjmp</CODE>
should make other arrangements to save the values of the global register
variables, and to restore them in a <CODE>longjmp</CODE>.  This way, the same
thing will happen regardless of what <CODE>longjmp</CODE> does.
</P><P>

All global register variable declarations must precede all function
definitions.  If such a declaration could appear after function
definitions, the declaration would be too late to prevent the register from
being used for other purposes in the preceding functions.
</P><P>

Global register variables may not have initial values, because an
executable file has no means to supply initial contents for a register.
</P><P>

On the Sparc, there are reports that g3 <small>...</small> g7 are suitable
registers, but certain library functions, such as <CODE>getwd</CODE>, as well
as the subroutines for division and remainder, modify g3 and g4.  g1 and
g2 are local temporaries.
</P><P>

On the 68000, a2 <small>...</small> a5 should be suitable, as should d2 <small>...</small> d7.
Of course, it will not do to use more than a few of those.

<H3> 4.29.2 Specifying Registers for Local Variables </H3>
<!--docid::SEC77::-->
<P>

You can define a local register variable with a specified register
like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>register int *foo asm ("a5");
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here <CODE>a5</CODE> is the name of the register which should be used.  Note
that this is the same syntax used for defining global register
variables, but for a local variable it would appear within a function.
</P><P>

Naturally the register name is cpu-dependent, but this is not a
problem, since specific registers are most often useful with explicit
assembler instructions (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC73">4.27 Assembler Instructions with C Expression Operands</A>).  Both of these things
generally require that you conditionalize your program according to
cpu type.
</P><P>

In addition, operating systems on one type of cpu may differ in how they
name the registers; then you would need additional conditionals.  For
example, some 68000 operating systems call this register <CODE>%a5</CODE>.
</P><P>

Eventually there may be a way of asking the compiler to choose a register
automatically, but first we need to figure out how it should choose and
how to enable you to guide the choice.  No solution is evident.
</P><P>

Defining such a register variable does not reserve the register; it
remains available for other uses in places where flow control determines
the variable's value is not live.  However, these registers are made
unavailable for use in the reload pass.  I would not be surprised if
excessive use of this feature leaves the compiler too few available
registers to compile certain functions.

<!--docid::SEC78::-->
<P>

The option <SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP> disables certain keywords; <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP>
disables certain others.  This causes trouble when you want to use GNU C
extensions, or ANSI C features, in a general-purpose header file that
should be usable by all programs, including ANSI C programs and traditional
ones.  The keywords <CODE>asm</CODE>, <CODE>typeof</CODE> and <CODE>inline</CODE> cannot be
used since they won't work in a program compiled with <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP>, while
the keywords <CODE>const</CODE>, <CODE>volatile</CODE>, <CODE>signed</CODE>, <CODE>typeof</CODE>
and <CODE>inline</CODE> won't work in a program compiled with
<SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP>.</P><P>

The way to solve these problems is to put <SAMP>`__'</SAMP> at the beginning and
end of each problematical keyword.  For example, use <CODE>__asm__</CODE>
instead of <CODE>asm</CODE>, <CODE>__const__</CODE> instead of <CODE>const</CODE>, and
<CODE>__inline__</CODE> instead of <CODE>inline</CODE>.
</P><P>

Other C compilers won't accept these alternative keywords; if you want to
compile with another compiler, you can define the alternate keywords as
macros to replace them with the customary keywords.  It looks like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#ifndef __GNUC__
#define __asm__ asm
#endif
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<SAMP>`-pedantic'</SAMP> causes warnings for many GNU C extensions.  You can
prevent such warnings within one expression by writing
<CODE>__extension__</CODE> before the expression.  <CODE>__extension__</CODE> has no
effect aside from this.

<H2> 4.31 Incomplete <CODE>enum</CODE> Types </H2>
<!--docid::SEC79::-->
<P>

You can define an <CODE>enum</CODE> tag without specifying its possible values.
This results in an incomplete type, much like what you get if you write
<CODE>struct foo</CODE> without describing the elements.  A later declaration
which does specify the possible values completes the type.
</P><P>

You can't allocate variables or storage using the type while it is
incomplete.  However, you can work with pointers to that type.

This extension may not be very useful, but it makes the handling of
<CODE>enum</CODE> more consistent with the way <CODE>struct</CODE> and <CODE>union</CODE>
are handled.

Loop unrolling doesn't work properly for certain C++ programs.  This is
because of difficulty in updating the debugging information within the

information so that this will work properly, but we have not done this

<H2> 5.2 Installation Problems </H2>
<!--docid::SEC82::-->
<P>

This is a list of problems (and some apparent problems which don't
really mean anything is wrong) that show up during installation of GNU
CC.
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
On certain systems, defining certain environment variables such as
<CODE>CC</CODE> can interfere with the functioning of <CODE>make</CODE>.
<P>

<LI>
If you encounter seemingly strange errors when trying to build the
compiler in a directory other than the source directory, it could be
because you have previously configured the compiler in the source
directory.  Make sure you have done all the necessary preparations.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC37">3.1 Compilation in a Separate Directory</A>.
<P>

<LI>
In previous versions of GNU CC, the <CODE>gcc</CODE> driver program looked for
<CODE>as</CODE> and <CODE>ld</CODE> in various places such as files beginning with
<TT>`/usr/local/lib/gcc-'</TT>.  GNU CC version 2 looks for them in the
directory <TT>`/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/<VAR>target</VAR>/<VAR>version</VAR>'</TT>.
<P>

Thus, to use a version of <CODE>as</CODE> or <CODE>ld</CODE> that is not the system
default, for example <CODE>gas</CODE> or GNU <CODE>ld</CODE>, you must put them in
that directory (or make links to them from that directory).
</P><P>

<LI>
Some commands executed when making the compiler may fail (return a
non-zero status) and be ignored by <CODE>make</CODE>.  These failures, which
are often due to files that were not found, are expected, and can safely
be ignored.
<P>

<LI>
It is normal to have warnings in compiling certain files about
unreachable code and about enumeration type clashes.  These files' names
begin with <SAMP>`insn-'</SAMP>.
<P>

<LI>
Sometimes <CODE>make</CODE> recompiles parts of the compiler when installing
the compiler.  In one case, this was traced down to a bug in
<CODE>make</CODE>.  Either ignore the problem or switch to GNU Make.
<P>

<LI>
On some 386 systems, building the compiler never finishes because
<CODE>enquire</CODE> hangs due to a hardware problem in the motherboard--it
reports floating point exceptions to the kernel incorrectly.  You can
install GNU CC except for <TT>`float.h'</TT> by patching out the command to
run <CODE>enquire</CODE>.  You may also be able to fix the problem for real by
getting a replacement motherboard.  This problem was observed in
Revision E of the Micronics motherboard, and is fixed in Revision F.
<P>

<LI>
On some 386 systems, GNU CC crashes trying to compile <TT>`enquire.c'</TT>.
This happens on machines that don't have a 387 FPU chip.  On 386
machines, the system kernel is supposed to emulate the 387 when you
don't have one.  The crash is due to a bug in the emulator.
<P>

One of these systems is the Unix from Interactive Systems: 386/ix.
On this system, an alternate emulator is provided, and it does work.
To use it, execute this command as super-user:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>ln /etc/emulator.rel1 /etc/emulator
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

and then reboot the system.  (The default emulator file remains present
under the name <TT>`emulator.dflt'</TT>.)
</P><P>

If you have such a problem on the SCO system, try using
<TT>`/etc/emulator.att'</TT>.
</P><P>

Another system which has this problem is Esix.  We don't know whether it
has an alternate emulator that works.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX114"></A>
<LI>
Sometimes on a Sun 4 you may observe a crash in the program
<CODE>genflags</CODE> or <CODE>genoutput</CODE> while building GNU CC.  This is said to
be due to a bug in <CODE>sh</CODE>.  You can probably get around it by running
<CODE>genflags</CODE> or <CODE>genoutput</CODE> manually and then retrying the
<CODE>make</CODE>.
<P>

<LI>
If you use the 1.31 version of the MIPS assembler (such as was shipped
with Ultrix 3.1), you will need to use the -fno-delayed-branch switch
when optimizing floating point code.  Otherwise, the assembler will
complain when the GCC compiler fills a branch delay slot with a
floating point instruction, such as add.d.
<P>

<LI>
Users have reported some problems with version 2.0 of the MIPS
compiler tools that were shipped with Ultrix 4.1.  Version 2.10
which came with Ultrix 4.2 seems to work fine.
<P>

<LI>
Some versions of the MIPS linker will issue an assertion failure
when linking code that uses <CODE>alloca</CODE> against shared
libraries on RISC-OS 5.0, and DEC's OSF/1 systems.  This is a bug
in the linker, that is supposed to be fixed in future revisions.
To protect against this, GCC passes <SAMP>`-non_shared'</SAMP> to the
linker unless you pass an explicit <SAMP>`-shared'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`-call_shared'</SAMP> switch.
<P>

<LI>
On System V release 3, you may get this error message
while linking:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>ld fatal: failed to write symbol name <VAR>something</VAR> 
 in strings table for file <VAR>whatever</VAR>
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This indicates that the disk is full or your ULIMIT won't allow
the file to be as large as it needs to be.
</P><P>

<LI>
On HP 9000 series 300 or 400 running HP-UX release 8.0, there is a bug
in the assembler that must be fixed before GNU CC can be built.  This
bug manifests itself during the first stage of compilation, while
building <TT>`libgcc2.a'</TT>:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>_floatdisf
cc1: warning: `-g' option not supported on this version of GCC
cc1: warning: `-g1' option not supported on this version of GCC
./gcc: Internal compiler error: program as got fatal signal 11
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

A patched version of the assembler is available by anonymous ftp from
<CODE>altdorf.ai.mit.edu</CODE> as the file
<TT>`archive/cph/hpux-8.0-assembler'</TT>.  If you have HP software support,
the patch can also be obtained directly from HP, as described in the
following note:
</P><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is the patched assembler, to patch SR#1653-010439, where the
assembler aborts on floating point constants.
<P>

The bug is not really in the assembler, but in the shared library
version of the function "cvtnum(3c)".  The bug on "cvtnum(3c)" is
SR#4701-078451.  Anyway, the attached assembler uses the archive
library version of "cvtnum(3c)" and thus does not exhibit the bug.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

This patch is also known as PHCO_0800.
</P><P>

<LI>
Another assembler problem on the HP PA results in an error message like
this while compiling part of <TT>`libgcc2.a'</TT>:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>as: /usr/tmp/cca08196.s @line#30 [err#1060]
  Argument 1 or 3 in FARG upper
         - lookahead = RTNVAL=GR
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This happens because HP changed the assembler syntax after system
release 8.02.  GNU CC assumes the newer syntax; if your assembler wants

Some versions of the Pyramid C compiler are reported to be unable to
compile GNU CC.  You must use an older version of GNU CC for
bootstrapping.  One indication of this problem is if you get a crash
when GNU CC compiles the function <CODE>muldi3</CODE> in file <TT>`libgcc2.c'</TT>.
<P>

You may be able to succeed by getting GNU CC version 1, installing it,
and using it to compile GNU CC version 2.  The bug in the Pyramid C
compiler does not seem to affect GNU CC version 1.

On the Tower models 4<VAR>n</VAR>0 and 6<VAR>n</VAR>0, by default a process is not
allowed to have more than one megabyte of memory.  GNU CC cannot compile
itself (or many other programs) with <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> in that much memory.
<P>

To solve this problem, reconfigure the kernel adding the following line

On the Altos 3068, programs compiled with GNU CC won't work unless you
fix a kernel bug.  This happens using system versions V.2.2 1.0gT1 and
V.2.2 1.0e and perhaps later versions as well.  See the file
<TT>`README.ALTOS'</TT>.

<UL>
<LI>
Cross compilation can run into trouble for certain machines because
some target machines' assemblers require floating point numbers to be
written as <EM>integer</EM> constants in certain contexts.
<P>

The compiler writes these integer constants by examining the floating
point value as an integer and printing that integer, because this is
simple to write and independent of the details of the floating point
representation.  But this does not work if the compiler is running on
a different machine with an incompatible floating point format, or
even a different byte-ordering.
</P><P>

In addition, correct constant folding of floating point values
requires representing them in the target machine's format.
(The C standard does not quite require this, but in practice
it is the only way to win.)
</P><P>

It is now possible to overcome these problems by defining macros such
as <CODE>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</CODE>.  But doing so is a substantial amount of
work for each target machine.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC197">14.18 Cross Compilation and Floating Point Format</A>.

<P>

This section lists various difficulties encountered in using GNU C or
GNU C++ together with other compilers or with the assemblers, linkers,
libraries and debuggers on certain systems.
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
GNU C normally compiles functions to return small structures and unions
in registers.  Most other compilers arrange to return them just like
larger structures and unions.  This can lead to trouble when you link
together code compiled by different compilers. To avoid the problem, you
can use the option <SAMP>`-fpcc-struct-return'</SAMP> when compiling with GNU CC.
<P>

<LI>
GNU C++ does not do name mangling in the same way as other C++
compilers.  This means that object files compiled with one compiler
cannot be used with another.
<P>

GNU C++ also uses different techniques for arranging virtual function
tables and the layout of class instances.  In general, therefore,
linking code compiled with different C++ compilers does not work.
</P><P>

<LI>
Older GDB versions sometimes fail to read the output of GNU CC version
2.  If you have trouble, get GDB version 4.4 or later.
<P>

<LI>
<A NAME="IDX115"></A>
DBX rejects some files produced by GNU CC, though it accepts similar
constructs in output from PCC.  Until someone can supply a coherent
description of what is valid DBX input and what is not, there is
nothing I can do about these problems.  You are on your own.
<P>

<LI>
The GNU assembler (GAS) does not support PIC.  To generate PIC code, you
must use some other assembler, such as <TT>`/bin/as'</TT>.
<P>

<LI>
On some BSD systems including some versions of Ultrix, use of profiling
causes static variable destructors (currently used only in C++) not to
be run.
<P>

<LI>
Use of <SAMP>`-I/usr/include'</SAMP> may cause trouble.
<P>

Many systems come with header files that won't work with GNU CC unless
corrected by <CODE>fixincludes</CODE>.  The corrected header files go in a new
directory; GNU CC searches this directory before <TT>`/usr/include'</TT>.
If you use <SAMP>`-I/usr/include'</SAMP>, this tells GNU CC to search
<TT>`/usr/include'</TT> earlier on, before the corrected headers.  The
result is that you get the uncorrected header files.
</P><P>

Instead, you should use these options:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>-I/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/<VAR>target</VAR>/<VAR>version</VAR>/include -I/usr/include
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<LI>
On a Sparc, GNU CC aligns all values of type <CODE>double</CODE> on an 8-byte
boundary, and it expects every <CODE>double</CODE> to be so aligned.  The Sun
compiler usually gives <CODE>double</CODE> values 8-byte alignment, with one
exception: function arguments of type <CODE>double</CODE> may not be aligned.
<P>

As a result, if a function compiled with Sun CC takes the address of an
argument of type <CODE>double</CODE> and passes this pointer of type
<CODE>double *</CODE> to a function compiled with GNU CC, dereferencing the
pointer may cause a fatal signal.
</P><P>

One way to solve this problem is to compile your entire program with GNU
CC.  Another solution is to modify the function that is compiled with
Sun CC to copy the argument into a local variable; local variables
are always properly aligned.  A third solution is to modify the function
that uses the pointer to dereference it via the following function
<CODE>access_double</CODE> instead of directly with <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>inline double
access_double (double *unaligned_ptr)
{
  union d2i { double d; int i[2]; };

  union d2i *p = (union d2i *) unaligned_ptr;
  union d2i u;

  u.i[0] = p-&#62;i[0];
  u.i[1] = p-&#62;i[1];

  return u.d;
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Storing into the pointer can be done likewise with the same union.
</P><P>

<LI>
On a Sun, linking using GNU CC fails to find a shared library and
reports that the library doesn't exist at all.
<P>

This happens if you are using the GNU linker, because it does only
static linking and looks only for unshared libraries.  If you have a
shared library with no unshared counterpart, the GNU linker won't find
anything.
</P><P>

We hope to make a linker which supports Sun shared libraries, but please
don't ask when it will be finished--we don't know.
</P><P>

<LI>
Sun forgot to include a static version of <TT>`libdl.a'</TT> with some
versions of SunOS (mainly 4.1).  This results in undefined symbols when
linking static binaries (that is, if you use <SAMP>`-static'</SAMP>).  If you
see undefined symbols <CODE>_dlclose</CODE>, <CODE>_dlsym</CODE> or <CODE>_dlopen</CODE>
when linking, compile and link against the file
<TT>`mit/util/misc/dlsym.c'</TT> from the MIT version of X windows.
<P>

<LI>
On the HP PA machine, ADB sometimes fails to work on functions compiled
with GNU CC.  Specifically, it fails to work on functions that use
<CODE>alloca</CODE> or variable-size arrays.  This is because GNU CC doesn't
generate HP-UX unwind descriptors for such functions.  It may even be
impossible to generate them.
<P>

<LI>
Debugging (<SAMP>`-g'</SAMP>) is not supported on the HP PA machine, unless you use 
the preliminary GNU tools (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC36">3. Installing GNU CC</A>).
<P>

<LI>
The HP-UX linker has a bug which can cause programs which make use of
<CODE>const</CODE> variables to fail in unusual ways.  If your program makes
use of global <CODE>const</CODE> variables, we suggest you compile with the
following additional options:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>-Dconst="" -D__const="" -D__const__="" -fwritable-strings
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This will force the <CODE>const</CODE> variables into the DATA subspace which 
will avoid the linker bug.
</P><P>

Another option one might use to work around this problem is
<SAMP>`-mkernel'</SAMP>.  <SAMP>`-mkernel'</SAMP> changes how the address of variables
is computed to a sequence less likely to tickle the HP-UX linker bug.
</P><P>

We hope to work around this problem in GNU CC 2.4, if HP does not fix
it.
</P><P>

<LI>
Taking the address of a label may generate errors from the HP-UX
PA assembler.  GAS for the PA does not have this problem.
<P>

<LI>
GNU CC produced code will not yet link against HP-UX 8.0 shared libraries.
We expect to fix this problem in GNU CC 2.4.  
<P>

<LI>
The current version of the assembler (<TT>`/bin/as'</TT>) for the RS/6000
has certain problems that prevent the <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> option in GCC from
working.
<P>

IBM has produced a fixed version of the assembler.  The replacement
assembler is not a standard component of either AIX 3.1.5 or AIX 3.2,
but is expected to become standard in a future distribution.  This
assembler is available from IBM as APAR IX22829.  Yet more bugs have
been fixed in a newer assembler, which will shortly be available as APAR
IX26107.  See the file <TT>`README.RS6000'</TT> for more details on these
assemblers.
</P><P>

<LI>
On the IBM RS/6000, compiling code of the form
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>extern int foo;

<small>...</small> foo <small>...</small>

static int foo;
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

will cause the linker to report an undefined symbol <CODE>foo</CODE>.
Although this behavior differs from most other systems, it is not a
bug because redefining an <CODE>extern</CODE> variable as <CODE>static</CODE>
is undefined in ANSI C.
</P><P>

<LI>
On VMS, GAS versions 1.38.1 and earlier may cause spurious warning
messages from the linker.  These warning messages complain of mismatched
psect attributes.  You can ignore them.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC43">3.7 Installing GNU CC on VMS</A>.
<P>

<LI>
On NewsOS version 3, if you include both <TT>`stddef.h'</TT> and
<TT>`sys/types.h'</TT>, you get an error because there are two typedefs of
<CODE>size_t</CODE>.  You should change <TT>`sys/types.h'</TT> by adding these
lines around the definition of <CODE>size_t</CODE>:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#ifndef _SIZE_T
#define _SIZE_T
<VAR>actual typedef here</VAR>
#endif
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

On the Alliant, the system's own convention for returning structures
and unions is unusual, and is not compatible with GNU CC no matter
what options are used.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX117"></A>
<A NAME="IDX118"></A>
<LI>
On the IBM RT PC, the MetaWare HighC compiler (hc) uses yet another
convention for structure and union returning.  Use
<SAMP>`-mhc-struct-return'</SAMP> to tell GNU CC to use a convention compatible
with it.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX119"></A>
<A NAME="IDX120"></A>
<LI>
On Ultrix, the Fortran compiler expects registers 2 through 5 to be saved
by function calls.  However, the C compiler uses conventions compatible
with BSD Unix: registers 2 through 5 may be clobbered by function calls.
<P>

GNU CC uses the same convention as the Ultrix C compiler.  You can use
these options to produce code compatible with the Fortran compiler:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>-fcall-saved-r2 -fcall-saved-r3 -fcall-saved-r4 -fcall-saved-r5
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<LI>
On the WE32k, you may find that programs compiled with GNU CC do not
work with the standard shared C ilbrary.  You may need to link with
the ordinary C compiler.  If you do so, you must specify the following
options:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>-L/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/we32k-att-sysv/2.3 -lgcc -lc_s
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The first specifies where to find the library <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT>
specified with the <SAMP>`-lgcc'</SAMP> option.
</P><P>

GNU CC does linking by invoking <CODE>ld</CODE>, just as <CODE>cc</CODE> does, and
there is no reason why it <EM>should</EM> matter which compilation program
you use to invoke <CODE>ld</CODE>.  If someone tracks this problem down,
it can probably be fixed easily.

<H2> 5.5 Incompatibilities of GNU CC </H2>
<!--docid::SEC85::-->
<P>

There are several noteworthy incompatibilities between GNU C and most
existing (non-ANSI) versions of C.  The <SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP> option
eliminates many of these incompatibilities, <EM>but not all</EM>, by
telling GNU C to behave like the other C compilers.
</P><P>

<UL>
<A NAME="IDX121"></A>
<A NAME="IDX122"></A>
<A NAME="IDX123"></A>
<LI>
GNU CC normally makes string constants read-only.  If several
identical-looking string constants are used, GNU CC stores only one
copy of the string.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX124"></A>
One consequence is that you cannot call <CODE>mktemp</CODE> with a string
constant argument.  The function <CODE>mktemp</CODE> always alters the
string its argument points to.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX125"></A>
<A NAME="IDX126"></A>
<A NAME="IDX127"></A>
Another consequence is that <CODE>sscanf</CODE> does not work on some systems
when passed a string constant as its format control string or input.
This is because <CODE>sscanf</CODE> incorrectly tries to write into the string
constant.  Likewise <CODE>fscanf</CODE> and <CODE>scanf</CODE>.
</P><P>

The best solution to these problems is to change the program to use
<CODE>char</CODE>-array variables with initialization strings for these
purposes instead of string constants.  But if this is not possible,
you can use the <SAMP>`-fwritable-strings'</SAMP> flag, which directs GNU CC
to handle string constants the same way most C compilers do.
<SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP> also has this effect, among others.
</P><P>

<LI>
<CODE>-2147483648</CODE> is positive.
<P>

This is because 2147483648 cannot fit in the type <CODE>int</CODE>, so
(following the ANSI C rules) its data type is <CODE>unsigned long int</CODE>.
Negating this value yields 2147483648 again.
</P><P>

<LI>
GNU CC does not substitute macro arguments when they appear inside of
string constants.  For example, the following macro in GNU CC
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define foo(a) "a"
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

will produce output <CODE>"a"</CODE> regardless of what the argument <VAR>a</VAR> is.
</P><P>

The <SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP> option directs GNU CC to handle such cases
(among others) in the old-fashioned (non-ANSI) fashion.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX128"></A>
<A NAME="IDX129"></A>
<LI>
When you use <CODE>setjmp</CODE> and <CODE>longjmp</CODE>, the only automatic
variables guaranteed to remain valid are those declared
<CODE>volatile</CODE>.  This is a consequence of automatic register
allocation.  Consider this function:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>jmp_buf j;

foo ()
{
  int a, b;

  a = fun1 ();
  if (setjmp (j))
    return a;

  a = fun2 ();
  /* <CODE>longjmp (j)</CODE> may occur in <CODE>fun3</CODE>. */
  return a + fun3 ();
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here <CODE>a</CODE> may or may not be restored to its first value when the
<CODE>longjmp</CODE> occurs.  If <CODE>a</CODE> is allocated in a register, then
its first value is restored; otherwise, it keeps the last value stored
in it.
</P><P>

If you use the <SAMP>`-W'</SAMP> option with the <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> option, you will
get a warning when GNU CC thinks such a problem might be possible.
</P><P>

The <SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP> option directs GNU C to put variables in
the stack by default, rather than in registers, in functions that
call <CODE>setjmp</CODE>.  This results in the behavior found in
traditional C compilers.
</P><P>

<LI>
Programs that use preprocessor directives in the middle of macro
arguments do not work with GNU CC.  For example, a program like this
will not work:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>foobar (
#define luser
        hack)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

ANSI C does not permit such a construct.  It would make sense to support
it when <SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP> is used, but it is too much work to
implement.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX130"></A>
<A NAME="IDX131"></A>
<A NAME="IDX132"></A>
<LI>
Declarations of external variables and functions within a block apply
only to the block containing the declaration.  In other words, they
have the same scope as any other declaration in the same place.
<P>

In some other C compilers, a <CODE>extern</CODE> declaration affects all the
rest of the file even if it happens within a block.
</P><P>

The <SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP> option directs GNU C to treat all <CODE>extern</CODE>
declarations as global, like traditional compilers.
</P><P>

<LI>
In traditional C, you can combine <CODE>long</CODE>, etc., with a typedef name,
as shown here:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>typedef int foo;
typedef long foo bar;
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In ANSI C, this is not allowed: <CODE>long</CODE> and other type modifiers
require an explicit <CODE>int</CODE>.  Because this criterion is expressed
by Bison grammar rules rather than C code, the <SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP>
flag cannot alter it.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX133"></A>
<LI>
PCC allows typedef names to be used as function parameters.  The
difficulty described immediately above applies here too.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX134"></A>
<LI>
PCC allows whitespace in the middle of compound assignment operators
such as <SAMP>`+='</SAMP>.  GNU CC, following the ANSI standard, does not
allow this.  The difficulty described immediately above applies here
too.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX135"></A>
<A NAME="IDX136"></A>
<LI>
GNU CC complains about unterminated character constants inside of
preprocessor conditionals that fail.  Some programs have English
comments enclosed in conditionals that are guaranteed to fail; if these
comments contain apostrophes, GNU CC will probably report an error.  For
example, this code would produce an error:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#if 0
You can't expect this to work.
#endif
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The best solution to such a problem is to put the text into an actual
C comment delimited by <SAMP>`/*<small>...</small>*/'</SAMP>.  However,
<SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP> suppresses these error messages.
</P><P>

<LI>
Many user programs contain the declaration <SAMP>`long time ();'</SAMP>.  In the
past, the system header files on many systems did not actually declare
<CODE>time</CODE>, so it did not matter what type your program declared it to
return.  But in systems with ANSI C headers, <CODE>time</CODE> is declared to
return <CODE>time_t</CODE>, and if that is not the same as <CODE>long</CODE>, then
<SAMP>`long time ();'</SAMP> is erroneous.
<P>

The solution is to change your program to use <CODE>time_t</CODE> as the return
type of <CODE>time</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX137"></A>
<LI>
When compiling functions that return <CODE>float</CODE>, PCC converts it to
a double.  GNU CC actually returns a <CODE>float</CODE>.  If you are concerned
with PCC compatibility, you should declare your functions to return
<CODE>double</CODE>; you might as well say what you mean.

When compiling functions that return structures or unions, GNU CC
output code normally uses a method different from that used on most
versions of Unix.  As a result, code compiled with GNU CC cannot call
a structure-returning function compiled with PCC, and vice versa.
<P>

The method used by GNU CC is as follows: a structure or union which is
1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes long is returned like a scalar.  A structure or union
with any other size is stored into an address supplied by the caller
(usually in a special, fixed register, but on some machines it is passed
on the stack).  The machine-description macros <CODE>STRUCT_VALUE</CODE> and
<CODE>STRUCT_INCOMING_VALUE</CODE> tell GNU CC where to pass this address.
</P><P>

By contrast, PCC on most target machines returns structures and unions
of any size by copying the data into an area of static storage, and then
returning the address of that storage as if it were a pointer value.
The caller must copy the data from that memory area to the place where
the value is wanted.  GNU CC does not use this method because it is
slower and nonreentrant.
</P><P>

On some newer machines, PCC uses a reentrant convention for all
structure and union returning.  GNU CC on most of these machines uses a
compatible convention when returning structures and unions in memory,
but still returns small structures and unions in registers.
</P><P>

You can tell GNU CC to use a compatible convention for all structure and
union returning with the option <SAMP>`-fpcc-struct-return'</SAMP>.

<H2> 5.6 Disappointments and Misunderstandings </H2>
<!--docid::SEC86::-->
<P>

These problems are perhaps regrettable, but we don't know any practical
way around them.
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
Certain local variables aren't recognized by debuggers when you compile
with optimization.
<P>

This occurs because sometimes GNU CC optimizes the variable out of
existence.  There is no way to tell the debugger how to compute the
value such a variable "would have had", and it is not clear that would
be desirable anyway.  So GNU CC simply does not mention the eliminated
variable when it writes debugging information.
</P><P>

You have to expect a certain amount of disagreement between the
executable and your source code, when you use optimization.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX140"></A>
<A NAME="IDX141"></A>
<LI>
Users often think it is a bug when GNU CC reports an error for code
like this:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>int foo (struct mumble *);

struct mumble { <small>...</small> };

int foo (struct mumble *x)
{ <small>...</small> }
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This code really is erroneous, because the scope of <CODE>struct
mumble</CODE> in the prototype is limited to the argument list containing it.
It does not refer to the <CODE>struct mumble</CODE> defined with file scope
immediately below--they are two unrelated types with similar names in
different scopes.
</P><P>

But in the definition of <CODE>foo</CODE>, the file-scope type is used
because that is available to be inherited.  Thus, the definition and
the prototype do not match, and you get an error.
</P><P>

This behavior may seem silly, but it's what the ANSI standard specifies.
It is easy enough for you to make your code work by moving the
definition of <CODE>struct mumble</CODE> above the prototype.  It's not worth
being incompatible with ANSI C just to avoid an error for the example
shown above.
</P><P>

<LI>
Accesses to bitfields even in volatile objects works by accessing larger
objects, such as a byte or a word.  You cannot rely on what size of
object is accessed in order to read or write the bitfield; it may even
vary for a given bitfield according to the precise usage.
<P>

If you care about controlling the amount of memory that is accessed, use
volatile but do not use bitfields.
</P><P>

<LI>
On 68000 systems, you can get paradoxical results if you test the
precise values of floating point numbers.  For example, you can find
that a floating point value which is not a NaN is not equal to itself.
This results from the fact that the the floating point registers hold a
few more bits of precision than fit in a <CODE>double</CODE> in memory.
Compiled code moves values between memory and floating point registers
at its convenience, and moving them into memory truncates them.
<P>

You can partially avoid this problem by using the option
<SAMP>`-ffloat-store'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC12">2.6 Options That Control Optimization</A>).
</P><P>

<LI>
On the MIPS, variable argument functions using <TT>`varargs.h'</TT>
cannot have a floating point value for the first argument.  The
reason for this is that in the absence of a prototype in scope,
if the first argument is a floating point, it is passed in a
floating point register, rather than an integer resgister.
<P>

If the code is rewritten to use the ANSI standard <TT>`stdarg.h'</TT>
method of variable arguments, and the prototype is in scope at
the time of the call, everything will work fine.

<H2> 5.7 Caveats of using <CODE>protoize</CODE> </H2>
<!--docid::SEC87::-->
<P>

The conversion programs <CODE>protoize</CODE> and <CODE>unprotoize</CODE> can
sometimes change a source file in a way that won't work unless you
rearrange it.
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
<CODE>protoize</CODE> can insert references to a type name or type tag before
the definition, or in a file where they are not defined.
<P>

If this happens, compiler error messages should show you where the new
references are, so fixing the file by hand is straightforward.
</P><P>

<LI>
There are some C constructs which <CODE>protoize</CODE> cannot figure out.
For example, it can't determine argument types for declaring a
pointer-to-function variable; this you must do by hand.  <CODE>protoize</CODE>
inserts a comment containing <SAMP>`???'</SAMP> each time it finds such a
variable; so you can find all such variables by searching for this
string.  ANSI C does not require declaring the argument types of
pointer-to-function types.
<P>

<LI>
Using <CODE>unprotoize</CODE> can easily introduce bugs.  If the program
relied on prototypes to bring about conversion of arguments, these
conversions will not take place in the program without prototypes.
One case in which you can be sure <CODE>unprotoize</CODE> is safe is when
you are removing prototypes that were made with <CODE>protoize</CODE>; if
the program worked before without any prototypes, it will work again
without them.
<P>

You can find all the places where this problem might occur by compiling
the program with the <SAMP>`-Wconversion'</SAMP> option.  It prints a warning
whenever an argument is converted.
</P><P>

<LI>
Both conversion programs can be confused if there are macro calls in and
around the text to be converted.  In other words, the standard syntax
for a declaration or definition must not result from expanding a macro.
This problem is inherent in the design of C and cannot be fixed.  If
only a few functions have confusing macro calls, you can easily convert
them manually.
<P>

<LI>
<CODE>protoize</CODE> cannot get the argument types for a function whose
definition was not actually compiled due to preprocessor conditionals.
When this happens, <CODE>protoize</CODE> changes nothing in regard to such 
a function.  <CODE>protoize</CODE> tries to detect such instances and warn
about them.
<P>

You can generally work around this problem by using <CODE>protoize</CODE> step
by step, each time specifying a different set of <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> options for
compilation, until all of the functions have been converted.  There is
no automatic way to verify that you have got them all, however.
</P><P>

<LI>
Confusion may result if there is an occasion to convert a function
declaration or definition in a region of source code where there is more
than one formal parameter list present.  Thus, attempts to convert code
containing multiple (conditionally compiled) versions of a single
function header (in the same vicinity) may not produce the desired (or
expected) results.
<P>

If you plan on converting source files which contain such code, it is
recommended that you first make sure that each conditionally compiled
region of source code which contains an alternative function header also
contains at least one additional follower token (past the final right
parenthesis of the function header).  This should circumvent the
problem.
</P><P>

<LI>
<CODE>unprotoize</CODE> can become confused when trying to convert a function
definition or declaration which contains a declaration for a
pointer-to-function formal argument which has the same name as the
function being defined or declared.  We recommand you avoid such choices
of formal parameter names.
<P>

<LI>
You might also want to correct some of the indentation by hand and break
long lines.  (The conversion programs don't write lines longer than
eighty characters in any case.)

<H2> 5.8 Certain Changes We Don't Want to Make </H2>
<!--docid::SEC88::-->
<P>

This section lists changes that people frequently request, but which
we do not make because we think GNU CC is better without them.
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
Checking the number and type of arguments to a function which has an
old-fashioned definition and no prototype.
<P>

Such a feature would work only occasionally--only for calls that appear
in the same file as the called function, following the definition.  The
only way to check all calls reliably is to add a prototype for the
function.  But adding a prototype eliminates the motivation for this
feature.  So the feature is not worthwhile.
</P><P>

<LI>
Warning about using an expression whose type is signed as a shift count.
<P>

Shift count operands are probably signed more often than unsigned.
Warning about this would cause far more annoyance than good.
</P><P>

<LI>
Warning about assigning a signed value to an unsigned variable.
<P>

Such assignments must be very common; warning about them would cause
more annoyance than good.
</P><P>

<LI>
Warning about unreachable code.
<P>

It's very common to have unreachable code in machine-generated
programs.  For example, this happens normally in some files of GNU C
itself.
</P><P>

<LI>
Warning when a non-void function value is ignored.
<P>

Coming as I do from a Lisp background, I balk at the idea that there is
something dangerous about discarding a value.  There are functions that
return values which some callers may find useful; it makes no sense to
clutter the program with a cast to <CODE>void</CODE> whenever the value isn't
useful.
</P><P>

<LI>
Assuming (for optimization) that the address of an external symbol is
never zero.
<P>

This assumption is false on certain systems when <SAMP>`#pragma weak'</SAMP> is
used.
</P><P>

<LI>
Making <SAMP>`-fshort-enums'</SAMP> the default.
<P>

This would cause storage layout to be incompatible with most other C
compilers.  And it doesn't seem very important, given that you can get
the same result in other ways.  The case where it matters most is when
the enumeration-valued object is inside a structure, and in that case
you can specify a field width explicitly.
</P><P>

<LI>
Making bitfields unsigned by default on particular machines where "the
ABI standard" says to do so.
<P>

The ANSI C standard leaves it up to the implementation whether a bitfield
declared plain <CODE>int</CODE> is signed or not.  This in effect creates two
alternative dialects of C.
</P><P>

The GNU C compiler supports both dialects; you can specify the dialect
you want with the option <SAMP>`-fsigned-bitfields'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`-funsigned-bitfields'</SAMP>.  However, this leaves open the question
of which dialect to use by default.
</P><P>

Currently, the preferred dialect makes plain bitfields signed, because
this is simplest.  Since <CODE>int</CODE> is the same as <CODE>signed int</CODE> in
every other context, it is cleanest for them to be the same in bitfields
as well.
</P><P>

Some computer manufacturers have published Application Binary Interface
standards which specify that plain bitfields should be unsigned.  It is
a mistake, however, to say anything about this issue in an ABI.  This is
because the handling of plain bitfields distinguishes two dialects of C.
Both dialects are meaningful on every type of machine.  Whether a
particular object file was compiled using signed bitfields or unsigned
is of no concern to other object files, even if they access the same
bitfields in the same data structures.
</P><P>

A given program is written in one or the other of these two dialects.
The program stands a chance to work on most any machine if it is
compiled with the proper dialect.  It is unlikely to work at all if
compiled with the wrong dialect.
</P><P>

Many users appreciate the GNU C compiler because it provides an
environment that is uniform across machines.  These users would be
inconvenienced if the compiler treated plain bitfields differently on
certain machines.
</P><P>

Occasionally users write programs intended only for a particular machine
type.  On these occasions, the users would benefit if the GNU C compiler
were to support by default the same dialect as the other compilers on
that machine.  But such applications are rare.  And users writing a
program to run on more than one type of machine cannot possibly benefit
from this kind of compatibility.
</P><P>

This is why GNU CC does and will treat plain bitfields in the same
fashion on all types of machines (by default).
</P><P>

There are some arguments for making bitfields unsigned by default on all
machines.  If, for example, this becomes a universal de facto standard,
it would make sense for GNU CC to go along with it.  This is something
to be considered in the future.
</P><P>

(Of course, users strongly concerned about portability should indicate
explicitly in each bitfield whether it is signed or not.  In this way,
they write programs which have the same meaning in both C dialects.)
</P><P>

<LI>
Undefining <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> when <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> is not used.
<P>

Currently, GNU CC defines <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> as long as you don't use
<SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP>.  This provides good results in practice.
</P><P>

Programmers normally use conditionals on <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> to ask whether
it is safe to use certain features of ANSI C, such as function
prototypes or ANSI token concatenation.  Since plain <SAMP>`gcc'</SAMP> supports
all the features of ANSI C, the correct answer to these questions is
"yes".
</P><P>

Some users try to use <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> to check for the availability of
certain library facilities.  This is actually incorrect usage in an ANSI
C program, because the ANSI C standard says that a conforming
freestanding implementation should define <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> even though it
does not have the library facilities.  <SAMP>`gcc -ansi -pedantic'</SAMP> is a
conforming freestanding implementation, and it is therefore required to
define <CODE>__STDC__</CODE>, even though it does not come with an ANSI C
library.
</P><P>

Sometimes people say that defining <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> in a compiler that
does not completely conform to the ANSI C standard somehow violates the
standard.  This is illogical.  The standard is a standard for compilers
that claim to support ANSI C, such as <SAMP>`gcc -ansi'</SAMP>---not for other
compilers such as plain <SAMP>`gcc'</SAMP>.  Whatever the ANSI C standard says
is relevant to the design of plain <SAMP>`gcc'</SAMP> without <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> only
for pragmatic reasons, not as a requirement.
</P><P>

<LI>
Undefining <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> in C++.
<P>

Programs written to compile with C++-to-C translators get the
value of <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> that goes with the C compiler that is
subsequently used.  These programs must test <CODE>__STDC__</CODE>
to determine what kind of C preprocessor that compiler uses:
whether they should concatenate tokens in the ANSI C fashion
or in the traditional fashion.
</P><P>

These programs work properly with GNU C++ if <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> is defined.
They would not work otherwise.
</P><P>

In addition, many header files are written to provide prototypes in ANSI
C but not in traditional C.  Many of these header files can work without
change in C++ provided <CODE>__STDC__</CODE> is defined.  If <CODE>__STDC__</CODE>
is not defined, they will all fail, and will all need to be changed to
test explicitly for C++ as well.
</P><P>

<LI>
Deleting "empty" loops.
<P>

GNU CC does not delete "empty" loops because the most likely reason
you would put one in a program is to have a delay.  Deleting them will
not make real programs run any faster, so it would be pointless.
</P><P>

It would be different if optimization of a nonempty loop could produce
an empty one.  But this generally can't happen.

compiler reports errors (not just warnings) which would ordinarily
prevent the assembler from being run.

<LI>
If the compiler produces valid assembly code that does not correctly
execute the input source code, that is a compiler bug.
<P>

However, you must double-check to make sure, because you may have run
into an incompatibility between GNU C and traditional C
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC85">5.5 Incompatibilities of GNU CC</A>).  These incompatibilities might be considered
bugs, but they are inescapable consequences of valuable features.
</P><P>

Or you may have a program whose behavior is undefined, which happened
by chance to give the desired results with another C or C++ compiler.
</P><P>

For example, in many nonoptimizing compilers, you can write <SAMP>`x;'</SAMP>
at the end of a function instead of <SAMP>`return x;'</SAMP>, with the same
results.  But the value of the function is undefined if <CODE>return</CODE>
is omitted; it is not a bug when GNU CC produces different results.
</P><P>

Problems often result from expressions with two increment operators,
as in <CODE>f (*p++, *p++)</CODE>.  Your previous compiler might have
interpreted that expression the way you intended; GNU CC might
interpret it another way.  Neither compiler is wrong.  The bug is
in your code.
</P><P>

After you have localized the error to a single source line, it should
be easy to check for these things.  If your program is correct and
well defined, you have found a compiler bug.
</P><P>

<LI>
If the compiler produces an error message for valid input, that is a
compiler bug.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX149"></A>
<LI>
If the compiler does not produce an error message for invalid input,
that is a compiler bug.  However, you should note that your idea of
"invalid input" might be my idea of "an extension" or "support
for traditional practice".
<P>

<LI>
If you are an experienced user of C or C++ compilers, your suggestions
for improvement of GNU CC or GNU C++ are welcome in any case.

Often people think of posting bug reports to the newsgroup instead of
mailing them.  This appears to work, but it has one problem which can be
crucial: a newsgroup posting does not contain a mail path back to the
sender.  Thus, if maintainers need more information, they may be unable
to reach you.  For this reason, you should always send bug reports by
mail to the proper mailing list.

<H2> 6.3 How to Report Bugs </H2>
<!--docid::SEC92::-->
<P>

The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
<STRONG>report all the facts</STRONG>.  If you are not sure whether to state a
fact or leave it out, state it!
</P><P>

Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
problem and they conclude that some details don't matter.  Thus, you might
assume that the name of the variable you use in an example does not matter.
Well, probably it doesn't, but one cannot be sure.  Perhaps the bug is a
stray memory reference which happens to fetch from the location where that
name is stored in memory; perhaps, if the name were different, the contents
of that location would fool the compiler into doing the right thing despite
the bug.  Play it safe and give a specific, complete example.  That is the
easiest thing for you to do, and the most helpful.
</P><P>

Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable someone to
fix the bug if it is not known.  It isn't very important what happens if
the bug is already known.  Therefore, always write your bug reports on
the assumption that the bug is not known.
</P><P>

Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, "Does this ring a
bell?"  This cannot help us fix a bug, so it is basically useless.  We
respond by asking for enough details to enable us to investigate.
You might as well expedite matters by sending them to begin with.
</P><P>

Try to make your bug report self-contained.  If we have to ask you for
more information, it is best if you include all the previous information
in your response, as well as the information that was missing.
</P><P>

To enable someone to investigate the bug, you should include all these
things:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
The version of GNU CC.  You can get this by running it with the
<SAMP>`-v'</SAMP> option.
<P>

Without this, we won't know whether there is any point in looking for
the bug in the current version of GNU CC.
</P><P>

<LI>
A complete input file that will reproduce the bug.  If the bug is in the
C preprocessor, send a source file and any header files that it
requires.  If the bug is in the compiler proper (<TT>`cc1'</TT>), run your
source file through the C preprocessor by doing <SAMP>`gcc -E
<VAR>sourcefile</VAR> &#62; <VAR>outfile</VAR>'</SAMP>, then include the contents of
<VAR>outfile</VAR> in the bug report.  (When you do this, use the same
<SAMP>`-I'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-U'</SAMP> options that you used in actual
compilation.)
<P>

A single statement is not enough of an example.  In order to compile it,
it must be embedded in a complete file of compiler input; and the bug
might depend on the details of how this is done.
</P><P>

Without a real example one can compile, all anyone can do about your bug
report is wish you luck.  It would be futile to try to guess how to
provoke the bug.  For example, bugs in register allocation and reloading
frequently depend on every little detail of the function they happen in.
</P><P>

Even if the input file that fails comes from a GNU program, you should
still send the complete test case.  Don't ask the GNU CC maintainers to
do the extra work of obtaining the program in question--they are all
overworked as it is.  Also, the problem may depend on what is in the
header files on your system; it is unreliable for the GNU CC maintainers
to try the problem with the header files available to them.  By sending
CPP output, you can eliminate this source of uncertainty.
</P><P>

<LI>
The command arguments you gave GNU CC or GNU C++ to compile that example
and observe the bug.  For example, did you use <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>?  To guarantee
you won't omit something important, list all the options.
<P>

If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess wrong
and then we would not encounter the bug.
</P><P>

<LI>
The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name and
version number.
<P>

<LI>
The operands you gave to the <CODE>configure</CODE> command when you installed
the compiler.
<P>

<LI>
A complete list of any modifications you have made to the compiler
source.  (We don't promise to investigate the bug unless it happens in
an unmodified compiler.  But if you've made modifications and don't tell
us, then you are sending us on a wild goose chase.)
<P>

Be precise about these changes.  A description in English is not
enough--send a context diff for them.
</P><P>

Adding files of your own (such as a machine description for a machine we
don't support) is a modification of the compiler source.
</P><P>

<LI>
Details of any other deviations from the standard procedure for installing
GNU CC.
<P>

<LI>
A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
incorrect.  For example, "The compiler gets a fatal signal," or,
"The assembler instruction at line 208 in the output is incorrect."
<P>

Of course, if the bug is that the compiler gets a fatal signal, then one
can't miss it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, the maintainer might
not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.  None of us has time to study
all the assembler code from a 50-line C program just on the chance that
one instruction might be wrong.  We need <EM>you</EM> to do this part!
</P><P>

Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should still
say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on, such as, your
copy of the compiler is out of synch, or you have encountered a bug in
the C library on your system.  (This has happened!)  Your copy might
crash and the copy here would not.  If you <I>said</I> to expect a crash,
then when the compiler here fails to crash, we would know that the bug
was not happening.  If you don't say to expect a crash, then we would
not know whether the bug was happening.  We would not be able to draw
any conclusion from our observations.
</P><P>

If the problem is a diagnostic when compiling GNU CC with some other
compiler, say whether it is a warning or an error.
</P><P>

Often the observed symptom is incorrect output when your program is run.
Sad to say, this is not enough information unless the program is short
and simple.  None of us has time to study a large program to figure out
how it would work if compiled correctly, much less which line of it was
compiled wrong.  So you will have to do that.  Tell us which source line
it is, and what incorrect result happens when that line is executed.  A
person who understands the program can find this as easily as finding a
bug in the program itself.
</P><P>

<LI>
If you send examples of assembler code output from GNU CC or GNU C++,
please use <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> when you make them.  The debugging information
includes source line numbers which are essential for correlating the
output with the input.
<P>

<LI>
If you wish to mention something in the GNU CC source, refer to it by
context, not by line number.
<P>

The line numbers in the development sources don't match those in your
sources.  Your line numbers would convey no useful information to the
maintainers.
</P><P>

<LI>
Additional information from a debugger might enable someone to find a
problem on a machine which he does not have available.  However, you
need to think when you collect this information if you want it to have
any chance of being useful.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX150"></A>
For example, many people send just a backtrace, but that is never
useful by itself.  A simple backtrace with arguments conveys little
about GNU CC because the compiler is largely data-driven; the same
functions are called over and over for different RTL insns, doing
different things depending on the details of the insn.
</P><P>

Most of the arguments listed in the backtrace are useless because they
are pointers to RTL list structure.  The numeric values of the
pointers, which the debugger prints in the backtrace, have no
significance whatever; all that matters is the contents of the objects
they point to (and most of the contents are other such pointers).
</P><P>

In addition, most compiler passes consist of one or more loops that
scan the RTL insn sequence.  The most vital piece of information about
such a loop--which insn it has reached--is usually in a local variable,
not in an argument.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX151"></A>
What you need to provide in addition to a backtrace are the values of
the local variables for several stack frames up.  When a local
variable or an argument is an RTX, first print its value and then use
the GDB command <CODE>pr</CODE> to print the RTL expression that it points
to.  (If GDB doesn't run on your machine, use your debugger to call
the function <CODE>debug_rtx</CODE> with the RTX as an argument.)  In
general, whenever a variable is a pointer, its value is no use
without the data it points to.
</UL>
<P>

Here are some things that are not necessary:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
A description of the envelope of the bug.
<P>

Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
changes will not affect it.
</P><P>

This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way we
will find the bug is by running a single example under the debugger with
breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of examples.  You might
as well save your time for something else.
</P><P>

Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report <EM>instead</EM> of
the original one, that is a convenience.  Errors in the output will be
easier to spot, running under the debugger will take less time, etc.
Most GNU CC bugs involve just one function, so the most straightforward
way to simplify an example is to delete all the function definitions
except the one where the bug occurs.  Those earlier in the file may be
replaced by external declarations if the crucial function depends on
them.  (Exception: inline functions may affect compilation of functions
defined later in the file.)
</P><P>

However, simplification is not vital; if you don't want to do this,
report the bug anyway and send the entire test case you used.
</P><P>

<LI>
In particular, some people insert conditionals <SAMP>`#ifdef BUG'</SAMP> around
a statement which, if removed, makes the bug not happen.  These are just
clutter; we won't pay any attention to them anyway.  Besides, you should
send us cpp output, and that can't have conditionals.
<P>

<LI>
A patch for the bug.
<P>

A patch for the bug is useful if it is a good one.  But don't omit the
necessary information, such as the test case, on the assumption that a
patch is all we need.  We might see problems with your patch and decide
to fix the problem another way, or we might not understand it at all.
</P><P>

Sometimes with a program as complicated as GNU CC it is very hard to
construct an example that will make the program follow a certain path
through the code.  If you don't send the example, we won't be able to
construct one, so we won't be able to verify that the bug is fixed.
</P><P>

And if we can't understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why your
patch should be an improvement, we won't install it.  A test case will
help us to understand.
</P><P>

See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC93">6.4 Sending Patches for GNU CC</A>, for guidelines on how to make it easy for us to
understand and install your patches.
</P><P>

<LI>
A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.
<P>

Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even I can't guess right about such
things without first using the debugger to find the facts.
</P><P>

<LI>
A core dump file.
<P>

We have no way of examining a core dump for your type of machine
unless we have an identical system--and if we do have one,
we should be able to reproduce the crash ourselves.

<H2> 6.4 Sending Patches for GNU CC </H2>
<!--docid::SEC93::-->
<P>

If you would like to write bug fixes or improvements for the GNU C
compiler, that is very helpful.  When you send your changes, please
follow these guidelines to avoid causing extra work for us in studying
the patches.
</P><P>

If you don't follow these guidelines, your information might still be
useful, but using it will take extra work.  Maintaining GNU C is a lot
of work in the best of circumstances, and we can't keep up unless you do
your best to help.
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
Send an explanation with your changes of what problem they fix or what
improvement they bring about.  For a bug fix, just include a copy of the
bug report, and explain why the change fixes the bug.
<P>

(Referring to a bug report is not as good as including it, because then
we will have to look it up, and we have probably already deleted it if
we've already fixed the bug.)
</P><P>

<LI>
Always include a proper bug report for the problem you think you have
fixed.  We need to convince ourselves that the change is right before
installing it.  Even if it is right, we might have trouble judging it if
we don't have a way to reproduce the problem.
<P>

<LI>
Include all the comments that are appropriate to help people reading the
source in the future understand why this change was needed.
<P>

<LI>
Don't mix together changes made for different reasons.
Send them <EM>individually</EM>.
<P>

If you make two changes for separate reasons, then we might not want to
install them both.  We might want to install just one.  If you send them
all jumbled together in a single set of diffs, we have to do extra work
to disentangle them--to figure out which parts of the change serve
which purpose.  If we don't have time for this, we might have to ignore
your changes entirely.
</P><P>

If you send each change as soon as you have written it, with its own
explanation, then the two changes never get tangled up, and we can
consider each one properly without any extra work to disentangle them.
</P><P>

Ideally, each change you send should be impossible to subdivide into
parts that we might want to consider separately, because each of its
parts gets its motivation from the other parts.
</P><P>

<LI>
Send each change as soon as that change is finished.  Sometimes people
think they are helping us by accumulating many changes to send them all
together.  As explained above, this is absolutely the worst thing you
could do.
<P>

Since you should send each change separately, you might as well send it
right away.  That gives us the option of installing it immediately if it
is important.
</P><P>

<LI>
Use <SAMP>`diff -c'</SAMP> to make your diffs.  Diffs without context are hard
for us to install reliably.  More than that, they make it hard for us to
study the diffs to decide whether we want to install them.  Unidiff
format is better than contextless diffs, but not as easy to read as
<SAMP>`-c'</SAMP> format.
<P>

If you have GNU diff, use <SAMP>`diff -cp'</SAMP>, which shows the name of the
function that each change occurs in.
</P><P>

<LI>
Write the change log entries for your changes.  We get lots of changes,
and we don't have time to do all the change log writing ourselves.
<P>

Read the <TT>`ChangeLog'</TT> file to see what sorts of information to put
in, and to learn the style that we use.  The purpose of the change log
is to show people where to find what was changed.  So you need to be
specific about what functions you changed; in large functions, it's
often helpful to indicate where within the function the change was.
</P><P>

On the other hand, once you have shown people where to find the change,
you need not explain its purpose. Thus, if you add a new function, all
you need to say about it is that it is new.  If you feel that the
purpose needs explaining, it probably does--but the explanation will be
much more useful if you put it in comments in the code.
</P><P>

If you would like your name to appear in the header line for who made
the change, send us the header line.
</P><P>

<LI>
When you write the fix, keep in mind that we can't install a change that
would break other systems.
<P>

People often suggest fixing a problem by changing machine-independent
files such as <TT>`toplev.c'</TT> to do something special that a particular
system needs.  Sometimes it is totally obvious that such changes would
break GNU CC for almost all users.  We can't possibly make a change like
that.  At best it might tell us how to write another patch that would
solve the problem acceptably.
</P><P>

Sometimes people send fixes that <EM>might</EM> be an improvement in
general--but it is hard to be sure of this.  It's hard to install
such changes because we have to study them very carefully.  Of course,
a good explanation of the reasoning by which you concluded the change
was correct can help convince us.
</P><P>

The safest changes are changes to the configuration files for a
particular machine.  These are safe because they can't create new bugs
on other machines.
</P><P>

Please help us keep up with the workload by designing the patch in a
form that is good to install.

Due to the differences between the filesystems of Unix and VMS, GNU CC
attempts to translate file names in <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> into names that VMS
will understand.  The basic strategy is to prepend a prefix to the
specification of the include file, convert the whole filename to a VMS
filename, and then try to open the file.  GNU CC tries various prefixes
one by one until one of them succeeds:
</P><P>

<OL>
<LI>
The first prefix is the <SAMP>`GNU_CC_INCLUDE:'</SAMP> logical name: this is
where GNU C header files are traditionally stored.  If you wish to store
header files in non-standard locations, then you can assign the logical
<SAMP>`GNU_CC_INCLUDE'</SAMP> to be a search list, where each element of the
list is suitable for use with a rooted logical.
<P>

<LI>
The next prefix tried is <SAMP>`SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSLIB.]'</SAMP>.  This is where
VAX-C header files are traditionally stored.
<P>

<LI>
If the include file specification by itself is a valid VMS filename, the
preprocessor then uses this name with no prefix in an attempt to open
the include file.
<P>

<LI>
If the file specification is not a valid VMS filename (i.e. does not
contain a device or a directory specifier, and contains a <SAMP>`/'</SAMP>
character), the preprocessor tries to convert it from Unix syntax to 
VMS syntax.
<P>

Conversion works like this: the first directory name becomes a device,
and the rest of the directories are converted into VMS-format directory
names.  For example, <TT>`X11/foobar.h'</TT> is translated to
<TT>`X11:[000000]foobar.h'</TT> or <TT>`X11:foobar.h'</TT>, whichever one can be
opened.  This strategy allows you to assign a logical name to point to
the actual location of the header files.
</P><P>

<LI>
If none of these strategies succeeds, the <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> fails.
</OL>
<P>

Include directives of the form:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#include foobar
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

are a common source of incompatibility between VAX-C and GNU CC.  VAX-C
treats this much like a standard <CODE>#include &#60;foobar.h&#62;</CODE> directive.
That is incompatible with the ANSI C behavior implemented by GNU CC: to
expand the name <CODE>foobar</CODE> as a macro.  Macro expansion should
eventually yield one of the two standard formats for <CODE>#include</CODE>:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#include "<VAR>file</VAR>"
#include &#60;<VAR>file</VAR>&#62;
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If you have this problem, the best solution is to modify the source to
convert the <CODE>#include</CODE> directives to one of the two standard forms.
That will work with either compiler.  If you want a quick and dirty fix,
define the file names as macros with the proper expansion, like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define stdio &#60;stdio.h&#62;
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This will work, as long as the name doesn't conflict with anything else
in the program.
</P><P>

Another source of incompatibility is that VAX-C assumes that:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#include "foobar"
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

is actually asking for the file <TT>`foobar.h'</TT>.  GNU CC does not
make this assumption, and instead takes what you ask for literally;
it tries to read the file <TT>`foobar'</TT>.  The best way to avoid this
problem is to always specify the desired file extension in your include
directives.
</P><P>

GNU CC for VMS is distributed with a set of include files that is
sufficient to compile most general purpose programs.  Even though the
GNU CC distribution does not contain header files to define constants
and structures for some VMS system-specific functions, there is no
reason why you cannot use GNU CC with any of these functions.  You first
may have to generate or create header files, either by using the public
domain utility <CODE>UNSDL</CODE> (which can be found on a DECUS tape), or by
extracting the relevant modules from one of the system macro libraries,
and using an editor to construct a C header file.
</P><P>

A <CODE>#include</CODE> file name cannot contain a DECNET node name.  The
preprocessor reports an I/O error if you attempt to use a node name,
whether explicitly, or implicitly via a logical name.

GNU CC does not provide the <CODE>globalref</CODE>, <CODE>globaldef</CODE> and
<CODE>globalvalue</CODE> keywords of VAX-C.  You can get the same effect with
an obscure feature of GAS, the GNU assembler.  (This requires GAS
version 1.39 or later.)  The following macros allow you to use this
feature in a fairly natural way:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=smallexample><FONT SIZE=-1><pre>#ifdef __GNUC__
#define GLOBALREF(TYPE,NAME)                      \
  TYPE NAME                                       \
  asm ("_$$PsectAttributes_GLOBALSYMBOL$$" #NAME)
#define GLOBALDEF(TYPE,NAME,VALUE)                \
  TYPE NAME                                       \
  asm ("_$$PsectAttributes_GLOBALSYMBOL$$" #NAME) \
    = VALUE
#define GLOBALVALUEREF(TYPE,NAME)                 \
  const TYPE NAME[1]                              \     
  asm ("_$$PsectAttributes_GLOBALVALUE$$" #NAME)
#define GLOBALVALUEDEF(TYPE,NAME,VALUE)           \
  const TYPE NAME[1]                              \
  asm ("_$$PsectAttributes_GLOBALVALUE$$" #NAME)  \
    = {VALUE}
#else
#define GLOBALREF(TYPE,NAME) \
  globalref TYPE NAME
#define GLOBALDEF(TYPE,NAME,VALUE) \
  globaldef TYPE NAME = VALUE
#define GLOBALVALUEDEF(TYPE,NAME,VALUE) \
  globalvalue TYPE NAME = VALUE
#define GLOBALVALUEREF(TYPE,NAME) \
  globalvalue TYPE NAME
#endif
</FONT></pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

(The <CODE>_$$PsectAttributes_GLOBALSYMBOL</CODE> prefix at the start of the
name is removed by the assembler, after it has modified the attributes
of the symbol).  These macros are provided in the VMS binaries
distribution in a header file <TT>`GNU_HACKS.H'</TT>.  An example of the
usage is:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>GLOBALREF (int, ijk);
GLOBALDEF (int, jkl, 0);
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The macros <CODE>GLOBALREF</CODE> and <CODE>GLOBALDEF</CODE> cannot be used
straightforwardly for arrays, since there is no way to insert the array
dimension into the declaration at the right place.  However, you can
declare an array with these macros if you first define a typedef for the
array type, like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>typedef int intvector[10];
GLOBALREF (intvector, foo);
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Array and structure initializers will also break the macros; you can
define the initializer to be a macro of its own, or you can expand the
<CODE>GLOBALDEF</CODE> macro by hand.  You may find a case where you wish to
use the <CODE>GLOBALDEF</CODE> macro with a large array, but you are not
interested in explicitly initializing each element of the array.  In
such cases you can use an initializer like: <CODE>{0,}</CODE>, which will
initialize the entire array to <CODE>0</CODE>.
</P><P>

A shortcoming of this implementation is that a variable declared with
<CODE>GLOBALVALUEREF</CODE> or <CODE>GLOBALVALUEDEF</CODE> is always an array.  For
example, the declaration:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>GLOBALVALUEREF(int, ijk);
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

declares the variable <CODE>ijk</CODE> as an array of type <CODE>int [1]</CODE>.
This is done because a globalvalue is actually a constant; its "value"
is what the linker would normally consider an address.  That is not how
an integer value works in C, but it is how an array works.  So treating
the symbol as an array name gives consistent results--with the
exception that the value seems to have the wrong type.  <STRONG>Don't
try to access an element of the array.</STRONG>  It doesn't have any elements.
The array "address" may not be the address of actual storage.
</P><P>

The fact that the symbol is an array may lead to warnings where the
variable is used.  Insert type casts to avoid the warnings.  Here is an
example; it takes advantage of the ANSI C feature allowing macros that
expand to use the same name as the macro itself.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>GLOBALVALUEREF (int, ss$_normal);
GLOBALVALUEDEF (int, xyzzy,123);
#ifdef __GNUC__
#define ss$_normal ((int) ss$_normal)
#define xyzzy ((int) xyzzy)
#endif
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Don't use <CODE>globaldef</CODE> or <CODE>globalref</CODE> with a variable whose
type is an enumeration type; this is not implemented.  Instead, make the
variable an integer, and use a <CODE>globalvaluedef</CODE> for each of the
enumeration values.  An example of this would be:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#ifdef __GNUC__
GLOBALDEF (int, color, 0);
GLOBALVALUEDEF (int, RED, 0);
GLOBALVALUEDEF (int, BLUE, 1);
GLOBALVALUEDEF (int, GREEN, 3);
#else
enum globaldef color {RED, BLUE, GREEN = 3};
#endif

GNU CC automatically arranges for <CODE>main</CODE> to return 1 by default if
you fail to specify an explicit return value.  This will be interpreted
by VMS as a status code indicating a normal successful completion.
Version 1 of GNU CC did not provide this default.
</P><P>

GNU CC on VMS works only with the GNU assembler, GAS.  You need version
1.37 or later of GAS in order to produce value debugging information for
the VMS debugger.  Use the ordinary VMS linker with the object files
produced by GAS.

Under previous versions of GNU CC, the generated code would occasionally

Now this should work.
</P><P>

A caveat for use of <CODE>const</CODE> global variables: the <CODE>const</CODE>
modifier must be specified in every external declaration of the variable
in all of the source files that use that variable.  Otherwise the linker
will issue warnings about conflicting attributes for the variable.  Your
program will still work despite the warnings, but the variable will be
placed in writable storage.

Although the VMS linker does distinguish between upper and lower case
letters in global symbols, most VMS compilers convert all such symbols
into upper case and most run-time library routines also have upper case
names.  To be able to reliably call such routines, GNU CC (by means of
the assembler GAS) converts global symbols into upper case like other
VMS compilers.  However, since the usual practice in C is to distinguish
case, GNU CC (via GAS) tries to preserve usual C behavior by augmenting
each name that is not all lower case.  This means truncating the name
to at most 23 characters and then adding more characters at the end
which encode the case pattern of those 23.   Names which contain at
least one dollar sign are an exception; they are converted directly into
upper case without augmentation.
</P><P>

Name augmentation yields bad results for programs that use precompiled
libraries (such as Xlib) which were generated by another compiler.  You
can use the compiler option <SAMP>`/NOCASE_HACK'</SAMP> to inhibit augmentation;
it makes external C functions and variables case-independent as is usual
on VMS.  Alternatively, you could write all references to the functions
and variables in such libraries using lower case; this will work on VMS,
but is not portable to other systems.  The compiler option <SAMP>`/NAMES'</SAMP>
also provides control over global name handling.
</P><P>

Function and variable names are handled somewhat differently with GNU
C++.  The GNU C++ compiler performs <EM>name mangling</EM> on function
names, which means that it adds information to the function name to
describe the data types of the arguments that the function takes. One
result of this is that the name of a function can become very long.
Since the VMS linker only recognizes the first 31 characters in a name,
special action is taken to ensure that each function and variable has a
unique name that can be represented in 31 characters.
</P><P>

If the name (plus a name augmentation, if required) is less than 32
characters in length, then no special action is performed. If the name
is longer than 31 characters, the assembler (GAS) will generate a
hash string based upon the function name, truncate the function name to
23 characters, and append the hash string to the truncated name.  If the
<SAMP>`/VERBOSE'</SAMP> compiler option is used, the assembler will print both
the full and truncated names of each symbol that is truncated.
</P><P>

The <SAMP>`/NOCASE_HACK'</SAMP> compiler option should not be used when you are
compiling programs that use libg++. libg++ has several instances of
objects (i.e.  <CODE>Filebuf</CODE> and <CODE>filebuf</CODE>) which become
indistinguishable in a case-insensitive environment.  This leads to
cases where you need to inhibit augmentation selectively (if you were
using libg++ and Xlib in the same program, for example).  There is no
special feature for doing this, but you can get the result by defining a
macro for each mixed case symbol for which you wish to inhibit
augmentation.  The macro should expand into the lower case equivalent of
itself.  For example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define StuDlyCapS studlycaps
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

These macro definitions can be placed in a header file to minimize the
number of changes to your source code.

<H1> 9. GNU CC and Portability </H1>
<!--docid::SEC99::-->
<P>

The main goal of GNU CC was to make a good, fast compiler for machines in
the class that the GNU system aims to run on: 32-bit machines that address
8-bit bytes and have several general registers.  Elegance, theoretical
power and simplicity are only secondary.
</P><P>

GNU CC gets most of the information about the target machine from a machine
description which gives an algebraic formula for each of the machine's
instructions.  This is a very clean way to describe the target.  But when
the compiler needs information that is difficult to express in this
fashion, I have not hesitated to define an ad-hoc parameter to the machine
description.  The purpose of portability is to reduce the total work needed
on the compiler; it was not of interest for its own sake.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX167"></A>
<A NAME="IDX168"></A>
<A NAME="IDX169"></A>
GNU CC does not contain machine dependent code, but it does contain code
that depends on machine parameters such as endianness (whether the most
significant byte has the highest or lowest address of the bytes in a word)
and the availability of autoincrement addressing.  In the RTL-generation
pass, it is often necessary to have multiple strategies for generating code
for a particular kind of syntax tree, strategies that are usable for different
combinations of parameters.  Often I have not tried to address all possible
cases, but only the common ones or only the ones that I have encountered.
As a result, a new target may require additional strategies.  You will know
if this happens because the compiler will call <CODE>abort</CODE>.  Fortunately,
the new strategies can be added in a machine-independent fashion, and will
affect only the target machines that need them.

<H1> 10. Interfacing to GNU CC Output </H1>
<!--docid::SEC100::-->
<P>

GNU CC is normally configured to use the same function calling convention
normally in use on the target system.  This is done with the
machine-description macros described (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC149">14. Target Description Macros</A>).
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX170"></A>
<A NAME="IDX171"></A>
<A NAME="IDX172"></A>
However, returning of structure and union values is done differently on
some target machines.  As a result, functions compiled with PCC
returning such types cannot be called from code compiled with GNU CC,
and vice versa.  This does not cause trouble often because few Unix
library routines return structures or unions.
</P><P>

GNU CC code returns structures and unions that are 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes
long in the same registers used for <CODE>int</CODE> or <CODE>double</CODE> return
values.  (GNU CC typically allocates variables of such types in
registers also.)  Structures and unions of other sizes are returned by
storing them into an address passed by the caller (usually in a
register).  The machine-description macros <CODE>STRUCT_VALUE</CODE> and
<CODE>STRUCT_INCOMING_VALUE</CODE> tell GNU CC where to pass this address.
</P><P>

By contrast, PCC on most target machines returns structures and unions
of any size by copying the data into an area of static storage, and then
returning the address of that storage as if it were a pointer value.
The caller must copy the data from that memory area to the place where
the value is wanted.  This is slower than the method used by GNU CC, and
fails to be reentrant.
</P><P>

On some target machines, such as RISC machines and the 80386, the
standard system convention is to pass to the subroutine the address of
where to return the value.  On these machines, GNU CC has been
configured to be compatible with the standard compiler, when this method
is used.  It may not be compatible for structures of 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX173"></A>
<A NAME="IDX174"></A>
GNU CC uses the system's standard convention for passing arguments.  On
some machines, the first few arguments are passed in registers; in
others, all are passed on the stack.  It would be possible to use
registers for argument passing on any machine, and this would probably
result in a significant speedup.  But the result would be complete
incompatibility with code that follows the standard convention.  So this
change is practical only if you are switching to GNU CC as the sole C
compiler for the system.  We may implement register argument passing on
certain machines once we have a complete GNU system so that we can
compile the libraries with GNU CC.
</P><P>

On some machines (particularly the Sparc), certain types of arguments
are passed "by invisible reference".  This means that the value is
stored in memory, and the address of the memory location is passed to
the subroutine.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX175"></A>
If you use <CODE>longjmp</CODE>, beware of automatic variables.  ANSI C says that
automatic variables that are not declared <CODE>volatile</CODE> have undefined
values after a <CODE>longjmp</CODE>.  And this is all GNU CC promises to do,
because it is very difficult to restore register variables correctly, and
one of GNU CC's features is that it can put variables in registers without
your asking it to.
</P><P>

If you want a variable to be unaltered by <CODE>longjmp</CODE>, and you don't
want to write <CODE>volatile</CODE> because old C compilers don't accept it,
just take the address of the variable.  If a variable's address is ever
taken, even if just to compute it and ignore it, then the variable cannot
go in a register:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>{
  int careful;
  &#38;careful;
  <small>...</small>
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX176"></A>
<A NAME="IDX177"></A>
Code compiled with GNU CC may call certain library routines.  Most of
them handle arithmetic for which there are no instructions.  This
includes multiply and divide on some machines, and floating point
operations on any machine for which floating point support is disabled
with <SAMP>`-msoft-float'</SAMP>.  Some standard parts of the C library, such as
<CODE>bcopy</CODE> or <CODE>memcpy</CODE>, are also called automatically.  The usual
function call interface is used for calling the library routines.
</P><P>

These library routines should be defined in the library <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT>,
which GNU CC automatically searches whenever it links a program.  On
machines that have multiply and divide instructions, if hardware
floating point is in use, normally <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT> is not needed, but it
is searched just in case.
</P><P>

Each arithmetic function is defined in <TT>`libgcc1.c'</TT> to use the
corresponding C arithmetic operator.  As long as the file is compiled
with another C compiler, which supports all the C arithmetic operators,
this file will work portably.  However, <TT>`libgcc1.c'</TT> does not work if
compiled with GNU CC, because each arithmetic function would compile
into a call to itself!

<H1> 11. Passes and Files of the Compiler </H1>
<!--docid::SEC101::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX178"></A>
The overall control structure of the compiler is in <TT>`toplev.c'</TT>.  This
file is responsible for initialization, decoding arguments, opening and
closing files, and sequencing the passes.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX179"></A>
The parsing pass is invoked only once, to parse the entire input.  The RTL
intermediate code for a function is generated as the function is parsed, a
statement at a time.  Each statement is read in as a syntax tree and then
converted to RTL; then the storage for the tree for the statement is
reclaimed.  Storage for types (and the expressions for their sizes),
declarations, and a representation of the binding contours and how they nest,
remain until the function is finished being compiled; these are all needed
to output the debugging information.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX180"></A>
<A NAME="IDX181"></A>
Each time the parsing pass reads a complete function definition or
top-level declaration, it calls the function
<CODE>rest_of_compilation</CODE> or <CODE>rest_of_decl_compilation</CODE> in
<TT>`toplev.c'</TT>, which are responsible for all further processing
necessary, ending with output of the assembler language.  All other
compiler passes run, in sequence, within <CODE>rest_of_compilation</CODE>.
When that function returns from compiling a function definition, the
storage used for that function definition's compilation is entirely
freed, unless it is an inline function (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC72">4.26 An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro</A>).
</P><P>

Here is a list of all the passes of the compiler and their source files.
Also included is a description of where debugging dumps can be requested
with <SAMP>`-d'</SAMP> options.
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
Parsing.  This pass reads the entire text of a function definition,
constructing partial syntax trees.  This and RTL generation are no longer
truly separate passes (formerly they were), but it is easier to think
of them as separate.
<P>

The tree representation does not entirely follow C syntax, because it is
intended to support other languages as well.
</P><P>

Language-specific data type analysis is also done in this pass, and every
tree node that represents an expression has a data type attached.
Variables are represented as declaration nodes.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX182"></A>
<A NAME="IDX183"></A>
<A NAME="IDX184"></A>
Constant folding and some arithmetic simplifications are also done
during this pass.
</P><P>

The language-independent source files for parsing are
<TT>`stor-layout.c'</TT>, <TT>`fold-const.c'</TT>, and <TT>`tree.c'</TT>.
There are also header files <TT>`tree.h'</TT> and <TT>`tree.def'</TT>
which define the format of the tree representation.</P><P>

The source files for parsing C are <TT>`c-parse.y'</TT>, <TT>`c-decl.c'</TT>,
<TT>`c-typeck.c'</TT>, <TT>`c-convert.c'</TT>, <TT>`c-lang.c'</TT>, and
<TT>`c-aux-info.c'</TT> along with header files <TT>`c-lex.h'</TT>, and
<TT>`c-tree.h'</TT>.
</P><P>

The source files for parsing C++ are <TT>`cp-parse.y'</TT>,
<TT>`cp-class.c'</TT>,<BR>
<TT>`cp-cvt.c'</TT>, <TT>`cp-decl.c'</TT>, <TT>`cp-decl2.c'</TT>,
<TT>`cp-dem.c'</TT>, <TT>`cp-except.c'</TT>,<BR>
<TT>`cp-expr.c'</TT>, <TT>`cp-init.c'</TT>, <TT>`cp-lex.c'</TT>,

<TT>`cp-search.c'</TT>, <TT>`cp-tree.c'</TT>, <TT>`cp-type2.c'</TT>, and
<TT>`cp-typeck.c'</TT>, along with header files <TT>`cp-tree.def'</TT>,
<TT>`cp-tree.h'</TT>, and <TT>`cp-decl.h'</TT>.
</P><P>

The special source files for parsing Objective C are
<TT>`objc-parse.y'</TT>, <TT>`objc-actions.c'</TT>, <TT>`objc-tree.def'</TT>, and
<TT>`objc-actions.h'</TT>.  Certain C-specific files are used for this as
well.
</P><P>

The file <TT>`c-common.c'</TT> is also used for all of the above languages.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX185"></A>
<LI>
RTL generation.  This is the conversion of syntax tree into RTL code.
It is actually done statement-by-statement during parsing, but for
most purposes it can be thought of as a separate pass.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX186"></A>
This is where the bulk of target-parameter-dependent code is found,
since often it is necessary for strategies to apply only when certain
standard kinds of instructions are available.  The purpose of named
instruction patterns is to provide this information to the RTL
generation pass.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX187"></A>
Optimization is done in this pass for <CODE>if</CODE>-conditions that are
comparisons, boolean operations or conditional expressions.  Tail
recursion is detected at this time also.  Decisions are made about how
best to arrange loops and how to output <CODE>switch</CODE> statements.
</P><P>

The source files for RTL generation include <TT>`stmt.c'</TT>,
<TT>`function.c'</TT>, <TT>`expr.c'</TT>, <TT>`calls.c'</TT>, <TT>`explow.c'</TT>,
<TT>`expmed.c'</TT>, <TT>`optabs.c'</TT> and <TT>`emit-rtl.c'</TT>.  Also, the file
<TT>`insn-emit.c'</TT>, generated from the machine description by the
program <CODE>genemit</CODE>, is used in this pass.  The header file
<TT>`expr.h'</TT> is used for communication within this pass.</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX188"></A>
<A NAME="IDX189"></A>
The header files <TT>`insn-flags.h'</TT> and <TT>`insn-codes.h'</TT>,
generated from the machine description by the programs <CODE>genflags</CODE>
and <CODE>gencodes</CODE>, tell this pass which standard names are available
for use and which patterns correspond to them.</P><P>

Aside from debugging information output, none of the following passes
refers to the tree structure representation of the function (only
part of which is saved).
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX190"></A>
The decision of whether the function can and should be expanded inline
in its subsequent callers is made at the end of rtl generation.  The
function must meet certain criteria, currently related to the size of
the function and the types and number of parameters it has.  Note that
this function may contain loops, recursive calls to itself
(tail-recursive functions can be inlined!), gotos, in short, all
constructs supported by GNU CC.  The file <TT>`integrate.c'</TT> contains
the code to save a function's rtl for later inlining and to inline that
rtl when the function is called.  The header file <TT>`integrate.h'</TT>
is also used for this purpose.
</P><P>

The option <SAMP>`-dr'</SAMP> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <SAMP>`.rtl'</SAMP> to
the input file name.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX191"></A>
<A NAME="IDX192"></A>
<A NAME="IDX193"></A>
<LI>
Jump optimization.  This pass simplifies jumps to the following
instruction, jumps across jumps, and jumps to jumps.  It deletes
unreferenced labels and unreachable code, except that unreachable code
that contains a loop is not recognized as unreachable in this pass.
(Such loops are deleted later in the basic block analysis.)  It also
converts some code originally written with jumps into sequences of
instructions that directly set values from the results of comparisons,
if the machine has such instructions.
<P>

Jump optimization is performed two or three times.  The first time is
immediately following RTL generation.  The second time is after CSE,
but only if CSE says repeated jump optimization is needed.  The
last time is right before the final pass.  That time, cross-jumping
and deletion of no-op move instructions are done together with the
optimizations described above.
</P><P>

The source file of this pass is <TT>`jump.c'</TT>.
</P><P>

The option <SAMP>`-dj'</SAMP> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass is run for the first time.  This dump file's name is made by
appending <SAMP>`.jump'</SAMP> to the input file name.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX194"></A>
<LI>
Register scan.  This pass finds the first and last use of each
register, as a guide for common subexpression elimination.  Its source
is in <TT>`regclass.c'</TT>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX195"></A>
<LI>
Jump threading.  This pass detects a condition jump that branches to an
identical or inverse test.  Such jumps can be <SAMP>`threaded'</SAMP> through
the second conditional test.  The source code for this pass is in
<TT>`jump.c'</TT>.  This optimization is only performed if
<SAMP>`-fthread-jumps'</SAMP> is enabled.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX196"></A>
<A NAME="IDX197"></A>
<LI>
Common subexpression elimination.  This pass also does constant
propagation.  Its source file is <TT>`cse.c'</TT>.  If constant
propagation causes conditional jumps to become unconditional or to
become no-ops, jump optimization is run again when CSE is finished.
<P>

The option <SAMP>`-ds'</SAMP> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <SAMP>`.cse'</SAMP> to
the input file name.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX198"></A>
<A NAME="IDX199"></A>
<A NAME="IDX200"></A>
<LI>
Loop optimization.  This pass moves constant expressions out of loops,
and optionally does strength-reduction and loop unrolling as well.
Its source files are <TT>`loop.c'</TT> and <TT>`unroll.c'</TT>, plus the header
<TT>`loop.h'</TT> used for communication between them.  Loop unrolling uses
some functions in <TT>`integrate.c'</TT> and the header <TT>`integrate.h'</TT>.
<P>

The option <SAMP>`-dL'</SAMP> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <SAMP>`.loop'</SAMP> to
the input file name.
</P><P>

<LI>
If <SAMP>`-frerun-cse-after-loop'</SAMP> was enabled, a second common
subexpression elimination pass is performed after the loop optimization
pass.  Jump threading is also done again at this time if it was specified.
<P>

The option <SAMP>`-dt'</SAMP> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <SAMP>`.cse2'</SAMP> to
the input file name.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX201"></A>
<A NAME="IDX202"></A>
<LI>
Stupid register allocation is performed at this point in a
nonoptimizing compilation.  It does a little data flow analysis as
well.  When stupid register allocation is in use, the next pass
executed is the reloading pass; the others in between are skipped.
The source file is <TT>`stupid.c'</TT>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX203"></A>
<A NAME="IDX204"></A>
<A NAME="IDX205"></A>
<LI>
Data flow analysis (<TT>`flow.c'</TT>).  This pass divides the program
into basic blocks (and in the process deletes unreachable loops); then
it computes which pseudo-registers are live at each point in the
program, and makes the first instruction that uses a value point at
the instruction that computed the value.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX206"></A>
This pass also deletes computations whose results are never used, and
combines memory references with add or subtract instructions to make
autoincrement or autodecrement addressing.
</P><P>

The option <SAMP>`-df'</SAMP> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <SAMP>`.flow'</SAMP> to
the input file name.  If stupid register allocation is in use, this
dump file reflects the full results of such allocation.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX207"></A>
<LI>
Instruction combination (<TT>`combine.c'</TT>).  This pass attempts to
combine groups of two or three instructions that are related by data
flow into single instructions.  It combines the RTL expressions for
the instructions by substitution, simplifies the result using algebra,
and then attempts to match the result against the machine description.
<P>

The option <SAMP>`-dc'</SAMP> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <SAMP>`.combine'</SAMP>
to the input file name.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX208"></A>
<A NAME="IDX209"></A>
<LI>
Instruction scheduling (<TT>`sched.c'</TT>).  This pass looks for
instructions whose output will not be available by the time that it is
used in subsequent instructions.  (Memory loads and floating point
instructions often have this behavior on RISC machines).  It re-orders
instructions within a basic block to try to separate the definition and
use of items that otherwise would cause pipeline stalls.
<P>

Instruction scheduling is performed twice.  The first time is immediately
after instruction combination and the second is immediately after reload.
</P><P>

The option <SAMP>`-dS'</SAMP> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after this
pass is run for the first time.  The dump file's name is made by
appending <SAMP>`.sched'</SAMP> to the input file name.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX210"></A>
<LI>
Register class preferencing.  The RTL code is scanned to find out
which register class is best for each pseudo register.  The source
file is <TT>`regclass.c'</TT>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX211"></A>
<A NAME="IDX212"></A>
<LI>
Local register allocation (<TT>`local-alloc.c'</TT>).  This pass allocates
hard registers to pseudo registers that are used only within one basic
block.  Because the basic block is linear, it can use fast and
powerful techniques to do a very good job.
<P>

The option <SAMP>`-dl'</SAMP> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <SAMP>`.lreg'</SAMP> to
the input file name.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX213"></A>
<LI>
Global register allocation (<TT>`global.c'</TT>).  This pass
allocates hard registers for the remaining pseudo registers (those
whose life spans are not contained in one basic block).
<P>

<A NAME="IDX214"></A>
<LI>
Reloading.  This pass renumbers pseudo registers with the hardware
registers numbers they were allocated.  Pseudo registers that did not
get hard registers are replaced with stack slots.  Then it finds
instructions that are invalid because a value has failed to end up in
a register, or has ended up in a register of the wrong kind.  It fixes
up these instructions by reloading the problematical values
temporarily into registers.  Additional instructions are generated to
do the copying.
<P>

The reload pass also optionally eliminates the frame pointer and inserts
instructions to save and restore call-clobbered registers around calls.
</P><P>

Source files are <TT>`reload.c'</TT> and <TT>`reload1.c'</TT>, plus the header
<TT>`reload.h'</TT> used for communication between them.
</P><P>

The option <SAMP>`-dg'</SAMP> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <SAMP>`.greg'</SAMP> to
the input file name.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX215"></A>
<A NAME="IDX216"></A>
<LI>
Instruction scheduling is repeated here to try to avoid pipeline stalls
due to memory loads generated for spilled pseudo registers.
<P>

The option <SAMP>`-dR'</SAMP> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <SAMP>`.sched2'</SAMP>
to the input file name.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX217"></A>
<A NAME="IDX218"></A>
<LI>
Jump optimization is repeated, this time including cross-jumping
and deletion of no-op move instructions.
<P>

The option <SAMP>`-dJ'</SAMP> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <SAMP>`.jump2'</SAMP>
to the input file name.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX219"></A>
<A NAME="IDX220"></A>
<LI>
Delayed branch scheduling.  This optional pass attempts to find
instructions that can go into the delay slots of other instructions,
usually jumps and calls.  The source file name is <TT>`reorg.c'</TT>.  
<P>

The option <SAMP>`-dd'</SAMP> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <SAMP>`.dbr'</SAMP>
to the input file name.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX221"></A>
<LI>
Conversion from usage of some hard registers to usage of a register
stack may be done at this point.  Currently, this is supported only
for the floating-point registers of the Intel 80387 coprocessor.   The
source file name is <TT>`reg-stack.c'</TT>.
<P>

The options <SAMP>`-dk'</SAMP> causes a debugging dump of the RTL code after
this pass.  This dump file's name is made by appending <SAMP>`.stack'</SAMP>
to the input file name.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX222"></A>
<A NAME="IDX223"></A>
<LI>
Final.  This pass outputs the assembler code for the function.  It is
also responsible for identifying spurious test and compare
instructions.  Machine-specific peephole optimizations are performed
at the same time.  The function entry and exit sequences are generated
directly as assembler code in this pass; they never exist as RTL.
<P>

The source files are <TT>`final.c'</TT> plus <TT>`insn-output.c'</TT>; the
latter is generated automatically from the machine description by the
tool <TT>`genoutput'</TT>.  The header file <TT>`conditions.h'</TT> is used
for communication between these files.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX224"></A>
<LI>
Debugging information output.  This is run after final because it must
output the stack slot offsets for pseudo registers that did not get
hard registers.  Source files are <TT>`dbxout.c'</TT> for DBX symbol table
format, <TT>`sdbout.c'</TT> for SDB symbol table format, and
<TT>`dwarfout.c'</TT> for DWARF symbol table format.
</UL>
<P>

Some additional files are used by all or many passes:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
Every pass uses <TT>`machmode.def'</TT> and <TT>`machmode.h'</TT> which define
the machine modes.
<P>

<LI>
Several passes use <TT>`real.h'</TT>, which defines the default
representation of floating point constants and how to operate on them.
<P>

<LI>
All the passes that work with RTL use the header files <TT>`rtl.h'</TT>
and <TT>`rtl.def'</TT>, and subroutines in file <TT>`rtl.c'</TT>.  The tools
<CODE>gen*</CODE> also use these files to read and work with the machine
description RTL.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX225"></A>
<LI>
Several passes refer to the header file <TT>`insn-config.h'</TT> which
contains a few parameters (C macro definitions) generated
automatically from the machine description RTL by the tool

<H1> 12. RTL Representation </H1>
<!--docid::SEC102::-->
<P>

Most of the work of the compiler is done on an intermediate representation
called register transfer language.  In this language, the instructions to be
output are described, pretty much one by one, in an algebraic form that
describes what the instruction does.
</P><P>

RTL is inspired by Lisp lists.  It has both an internal form, made up of
structures that point at other structures, and a textual form that is used
in the machine description and in printed debugging dumps.  The textual
form uses nested parentheses to indicate the pointers in the internal form.

<H2> 12.1 RTL Object Types </H2>
<!--docid::SEC103::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX231"></A>
RTL uses five kinds of objects: expressions, integers, wide integers,
strings and vectors.  Expressions are the most important ones.  An RTL
expression ("RTX", for short) is a C structure, but it is usually
referred to with a pointer; a type that is given the typedef name
<CODE>rtx</CODE>.
</P><P>

An integer is simply an <CODE>int</CODE>; their written form uses decimal digits.
A wide integer is an integral object whose type is <CODE>HOST_WIDE_INT</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC199">15. The Configuration File</A>); their written form used decimal digits.
</P><P>

A string is a sequence of characters.  In core it is represented as a
<CODE>char *</CODE> in usual C fashion, and it is written in C syntax as well.
However, strings in RTL may never be null.  If you write an empty string in
a machine description, it is represented in core as a null pointer rather
than as a pointer to a null character.  In certain contexts, these null
pointers instead of strings are valid.  Within RTL code, strings are most
commonly found inside <CODE>symbol_ref</CODE> expressions, but they appear in
other contexts in the RTL expressions that make up machine descriptions.  
</P><P>

A vector contains an arbitrary number of pointers to expressions.  The
number of elements in the vector is explicitly present in the vector.
The written form of a vector consists of square brackets
(<SAMP>`[<small>...</small>]'</SAMP>) surrounding the elements, in sequence and with
whitespace separating them.  Vectors of length zero are not created;
null pointers are used instead.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX232"></A>
<A NAME="IDX233"></A>
<A NAME="IDX234"></A>
<A NAME="IDX235"></A>
Expressions are classified by <EM>expression codes</EM> (also called RTX
codes).  The expression code is a name defined in <TT>`rtl.def'</TT>, which is
also (in upper case) a C enumeration constant.  The possible expression
codes and their meanings are machine-independent.  The code of an RTX can
be extracted with the macro <CODE>GET_CODE (<VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE> and altered with
<CODE>PUT_CODE (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>newcode</VAR>)</CODE>.
</P><P>

The expression code determines how many operands the expression contains,
and what kinds of objects they are.  In RTL, unlike Lisp, you cannot tell
by looking at an operand what kind of object it is.  Instead, you must know
from its context--from the expression code of the containing expression.
For example, in an expression of code <CODE>subreg</CODE>, the first operand is
to be regarded as an expression and the second operand as an integer.  In
an expression of code <CODE>plus</CODE>, there are two operands, both of which
are to be regarded as expressions.  In a <CODE>symbol_ref</CODE> expression,
there is one operand, which is to be regarded as a string.
</P><P>

Expressions are written as parentheses containing the name of the
expression type, its flags and machine mode if any, and then the operands
of the expression (separated by spaces).
</P><P>

Expression code names in the <SAMP>`md'</SAMP> file are written in lower case,
but when they appear in C code they are written in upper case.  In this
manual, they are shown as follows: <CODE>const_int</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX236"></A>
<A NAME="IDX237"></A>
In a few contexts a null pointer is valid where an expression is normally
wanted.  The written form of this is <CODE>(nil)</CODE>.

<H2> 12.2 Access to Operands </H2>
<!--docid::SEC104::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX238"></A>
For each expression type <TT>`rtl.def'</TT> specifies the number of
contained objects and their kinds, with four possibilities: <SAMP>`e'</SAMP> for
expression (actually a pointer to an expression), <SAMP>`i'</SAMP> for integer,
<SAMP>`w'</SAMP> for wide integer, <SAMP>`s'</SAMP> for string, and <SAMP>`E'</SAMP> for vector
of expressions.  The sequence of letters for an expression code is
called its <EM>format</EM>.  Thus, the format of <CODE>subreg</CODE> is
<SAMP>`ei'</SAMP>.</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX239"></A>
A few other format characters are used occasionally:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>u</CODE>
<DD><SAMP>`u'</SAMP> is equivalent to <SAMP>`e'</SAMP> except that it is printed differently
in debugging dumps.  It is used for pointers to insns.
<P>

<DT><CODE>n</CODE>
<DD><SAMP>`n'</SAMP> is equivalent to <SAMP>`i'</SAMP> except that it is printed differently
in debugging dumps.  It is used for the line number or code number of a
<CODE>note</CODE> insn.
<P>

<DT><CODE>S</CODE>
<DD><SAMP>`S'</SAMP> indicates a string which is optional.  In the RTL objects in
core, <SAMP>`S'</SAMP> is equivalent to <SAMP>`s'</SAMP>, but when the object is read,
from an <SAMP>`md'</SAMP> file, the string value of this operand may be omitted.
An omitted string is taken to be the null string.
<P>

<DT><CODE>V</CODE>
<DD><SAMP>`V'</SAMP> indicates a vector which is optional.  In the RTL objects in
core, <SAMP>`V'</SAMP> is equivalent to <SAMP>`E'</SAMP>, but when the object is read
from an <SAMP>`md'</SAMP> file, the vector value of this operand may be omitted.
An omitted vector is effectively the same as a vector of no elements.
<P>

<DT><CODE>0</CODE>
<DD><SAMP>`0'</SAMP> means a slot whose contents do not fit any normal category.
<SAMP>`0'</SAMP> slots are not printed at all in dumps, and are often used in
special ways by small parts of the compiler.
</DL>
<P>

There are macros to get the number of operands, the format, and the
class of an expression code:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>

The following classes are defined:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>o</CODE>
<DD>An RTX code that represents an actual object, such as <CODE>reg</CODE> or
<CODE>mem</CODE>.  <CODE>subreg</CODE> is not in this class.
<P>

<DT><CODE>&#60;</CODE>
<DD>An RTX code for a comparison.  The codes in this class are
<CODE>NE</CODE>, <CODE>EQ</CODE>, <CODE>LE</CODE>, <CODE>LT</CODE>, <CODE>GE</CODE>, <CODE>GT</CODE>,
<CODE>LEU</CODE>, <CODE>LTU</CODE>, <CODE>GEU</CODE>, <CODE>GTU</CODE>.<P>

<DT><CODE>1</CODE>
<DD>An RTX code for a unary arithmetic operation, such as <CODE>neg</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>c</CODE>
<DD>An RTX code for a commutative binary operation, other than <CODE>NE</CODE>
and <CODE>EQ</CODE> (which have class <SAMP>`&#60;'</SAMP>).
<P>

<DT><CODE>2</CODE>
<DD>An RTX code for a noncommutative binary operation, such as <CODE>MINUS</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><CODE>b</CODE>
<DD>An RTX code for a bitfield operation (<CODE>ZERO_EXTRACT</CODE> and
<CODE>SIGN_EXTRACT</CODE>).

<CODE>CALL_INSN</CODE>).<P>

<DT><CODE>m</CODE>

<A NAME="IDX244"></A>

<A NAME="IDX246"></A>
<A NAME="IDX247"></A>
Operands of expressions are accessed using the macros <CODE>XEXP</CODE>,
<CODE>XINT</CODE>, <CODE>XWINT</CODE> and <CODE>XSTR</CODE>.  Each of these macros takes
two arguments: an expression-pointer (RTX) and an operand number
(counting from zero).  Thus,</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>XEXP (<VAR>x</VAR>, 2)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

accesses operand 2 of expression <VAR>x</VAR>, as an expression.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>XINT (<VAR>x</VAR>, 2)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

accesses the same operand as an integer.  <CODE>XSTR</CODE>, used in the same
fashion, would access it as a string.
</P><P>

Any operand can be accessed as an integer, as an expression or as a string.
You must choose the correct method of access for the kind of value actually
stored in the operand.  You would do this based on the expression code of
the containing expression.  That is also how you would know how many
operands there are.
</P><P>

For example, if <VAR>x</VAR> is a <CODE>subreg</CODE> expression, you know that it has
two operands which can be correctly accessed as <CODE>XEXP (<VAR>x</VAR>, 0)</CODE>
and <CODE>XINT (<VAR>x</VAR>, 1)</CODE>.  If you did <CODE>XINT (<VAR>x</VAR>, 0)</CODE>, you
would get the address of the expression operand but cast as an integer;
that might occasionally be useful, but it would be cleaner to write
<CODE>(int) XEXP (<VAR>x</VAR>, 0)</CODE>.  <CODE>XEXP (<VAR>x</VAR>, 1)</CODE> would also
compile without error, and would return the second, integer operand cast as
an expression pointer, which would probably result in a crash when
accessed.  Nothing stops you from writing <CODE>XEXP (<VAR>x</VAR>, 28)</CODE> either,
but this will access memory past the end of the expression with
unpredictable results.</P><P>

Access to operands which are vectors is more complicated.  You can use the
macro <CODE>XVEC</CODE> to get the vector-pointer itself, or the macros
<CODE>XVECEXP</CODE> and <CODE>XVECLEN</CODE> to access the elements and length of a
vector.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX248"></A>
<DT><CODE>XVEC (<VAR>exp</VAR>, <VAR>idx</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Access the vector-pointer which is operand number <VAR>idx</VAR> in <VAR>exp</VAR>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX249"></A>
<DT><CODE>XVECLEN (<VAR>exp</VAR>, <VAR>idx</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Access the length (number of elements) in the vector which is
in operand number <VAR>idx</VAR> in <VAR>exp</VAR>.  This value is an <CODE>int</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX250"></A>
<DT><CODE>XVECEXP (<VAR>exp</VAR>, <VAR>idx</VAR>, <VAR>eltnum</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Access element number <VAR>eltnum</VAR> in the vector which is
in operand number <VAR>idx</VAR> in <VAR>exp</VAR>.  This value is an RTX.
<P>

It is up to you to make sure that <VAR>eltnum</VAR> is not negative
and is less than <CODE>XVECLEN (<VAR>exp</VAR>, <VAR>idx</VAR>)</CODE>.
</DL>
<P>

All the macros defined in this section expand into lvalues and therefore
can be used to assign the operands, lengths and vector elements as well as
to access them.

<H2> 12.4 Machine Modes </H2>
<!--docid::SEC106::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX317"></A>
A machine mode describes a size of data object and the representation used
for it.  In the C code, machine modes are represented by an enumeration
type, <CODE>enum machine_mode</CODE>, defined in <TT>`machmode.def'</TT>.  Each RTL
expression has room for a machine mode and so do certain kinds of tree
expressions (declarations and types, to be precise).
</P><P>

In debugging dumps and machine descriptions, the machine mode of an RTL
expression is written after the expression code with a colon to separate
them.  The letters <SAMP>`mode'</SAMP> which appear at the end of each machine mode
name are omitted.  For example, <CODE>(reg:SI 38)</CODE> is a <CODE>reg</CODE>
expression with machine mode <CODE>SImode</CODE>.  If the mode is
<CODE>VOIDmode</CODE>, it is not written at all.
</P><P>

Here is a table of machine modes.  The term "byte" below refers to an
object of <CODE>BITS_PER_UNIT</CODE> bits (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC152">14.3 Storage Layout</A>).
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX318"></A>
<DT><CODE>QImode</CODE>
<DD>"Quarter-Integer" mode represents a single byte treated as an integer.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX319"></A>
<DT><CODE>HImode</CODE>
<DD>"Half-Integer" mode represents a two-byte integer.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX320"></A>
<DT><CODE>PSImode</CODE>
<DD>"Partial Single Integer" mode represents an integer which occupies
four bytes but which doesn't really use all four.  On some machines,
this is the right mode to use for pointers.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX321"></A>
<DT><CODE>SImode</CODE>
<DD>"Single Integer" mode represents a four-byte integer.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX322"></A>
<DT><CODE>PDImode</CODE>
<DD>"Partial Double Integer" mode represents an integer which occupies
eight bytes but which doesn't really use all eight.  On some machines,
this is the right mode to use for certain pointers.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX323"></A>
<DT><CODE>DImode</CODE>
<DD>"Double Integer" mode represents an eight-byte integer.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX324"></A>
<DT><CODE>TImode</CODE>
<DD>"Tetra Integer" (?) mode represents a sixteen-byte integer.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX325"></A>
<DT><CODE>SFmode</CODE>
<DD>"Single Floating" mode represents a single-precision (four byte) floating
point number.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX326"></A>
<DT><CODE>DFmode</CODE>
<DD>"Double Floating" mode represents a double-precision (eight byte) floating
point number.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX327"></A>
<DT><CODE>XFmode</CODE>
<DD>"Extended Floating" mode represents a triple-precision (twelve byte)
floating point number.  This mode is used for IEEE extended floating
point.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX328"></A>
<DT><CODE>TFmode</CODE>
<DD>"Tetra Floating" mode represents a quadruple-precision (sixteen byte)
floating point number.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX329"></A>
<DT><CODE>CCmode</CODE>
<DD>"Condition Code" mode represents the value of a condition code, which
is a machine-specific set of bits used to represent the result of a
comparison operation.  Other machine-specific modes may also be used for
the condition code.  These modes are not used on machines that use
<CODE>cc0</CODE> (see see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC177">14.12 Condition Code Status</A>).
<P>

<A NAME="IDX330"></A>
<DT><CODE>BLKmode</CODE>
<DD>"Block" mode represents values that are aggregates to which none of
the other modes apply.  In RTL, only memory references can have this mode,
and only if they appear in string-move or vector instructions.  On machines
which have no such instructions, <CODE>BLKmode</CODE> will not appear in RTL.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX331"></A>
<DT><CODE>VOIDmode</CODE>
<DD>Void mode means the absence of a mode or an unspecified mode.
For example, RTL expressions of code <CODE>const_int</CODE> have mode
<CODE>VOIDmode</CODE> because they can be taken to have whatever mode the context
requires.  In debugging dumps of RTL, <CODE>VOIDmode</CODE> is expressed by
the absence of any mode.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX332"></A>
<A NAME="IDX333"></A>
<A NAME="IDX334"></A>
<A NAME="IDX335"></A>
<DT><CODE>SCmode, DCmode, XCmode, TCmode</CODE>
<DD>These modes stand for a complex number represented as a pair of
floating point values.  The values are in <CODE>SFmode</CODE>, <CODE>DFmode</CODE>,
<CODE>XFmode</CODE>, and <CODE>TFmode</CODE>, respectively.  Since C does not
support complex numbers, these machine modes are only partially
implemented.
</DL>
<P>

The machine description defines <CODE>Pmode</CODE> as a C macro which expands
into the machine mode used for addresses.  Normally this is the mode
whose size is <CODE>BITS_PER_WORD</CODE>, <CODE>SImode</CODE> on 32-bit machines.
</P><P>

The only modes which a machine description <I>must</I> support are
<CODE>QImode</CODE>, and the modes corresponding to <CODE>BITS_PER_WORD</CODE>,
<CODE>FLOAT_TYPE_SIZE</CODE> and <CODE>DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE</CODE>.
The compiler will attempt to use <CODE>DImode</CODE> for 8-byte structures and
unions, but this can be prevented by overriding the definition of
<CODE>MAX_FIXED_MODE_SIZE</CODE>.  Alternatively, you can have the compiler
use <CODE>TImode</CODE> for 16-byte structures and unions.  Likewise, you can
arrange for the C type <CODE>short int</CODE> to avoid using <CODE>HImode</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX336"></A>
Very few explicit references to machine modes remain in the compiler and
these few references will soon be removed.  Instead, the machine modes
are divided into mode classes.  These are represented by the enumeration
type <CODE>enum mode_class</CODE> defined in <TT>`machmode.h'</TT>.  The possible
mode classes are:

<H2> 12.5 Constant Expression Types </H2>
<!--docid::SEC107::-->
<P>

The simplest RTL expressions are those that represent constant values.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX360"></A>
<DT><CODE>(const_int <VAR>i</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>This type of expression represents the integer value <VAR>i</VAR>.  <VAR>i</VAR>
is customarily accessed with the macro <CODE>INTVAL</CODE> as in
<CODE>INTVAL (<VAR>exp</VAR>)</CODE>, which is equivalent to <CODE>XWINT (<VAR>exp</VAR>, 0)</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX361"></A>
<A NAME="IDX362"></A>
<A NAME="IDX363"></A>
<A NAME="IDX364"></A>
There is only one expression object for the integer value zero; it is
the value of the variable <CODE>const0_rtx</CODE>.  Likewise, the only
expression for integer value one is found in <CODE>const1_rtx</CODE>, the only
expression for integer value two is found in <CODE>const2_rtx</CODE>, and the
only expression for integer value negative one is found in
<CODE>constm1_rtx</CODE>.  Any attempt to create an expression of code
<CODE>const_int</CODE> and value zero, one, two or negative one will return
<CODE>const0_rtx</CODE>, <CODE>const1_rtx</CODE>, <CODE>const2_rtx</CODE> or
<CODE>constm1_rtx</CODE> as appropriate.</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX365"></A>
Similarly, there is only one object for the integer whose value is
<CODE>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE>.  It is found in <CODE>const_true_rtx</CODE>.  If
<CODE>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE> is one, <CODE>const_true_rtx</CODE> and
<CODE>const1_rtx</CODE> will point to the same object.  If
<CODE>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE> is -1, <CODE>const_true_rtx</CODE> and
<CODE>constm1_rtx</CODE> will point to the same object.</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX366"></A>
<DT><CODE>(const_double:<VAR>m</VAR> <VAR>addr</VAR> <VAR>i0</VAR> <VAR>i1</VAR> <small>...</small>)</CODE>
<DD>Represents either a floating-point constant of mode <VAR>m</VAR> or an
integer constant that is too large to fit into <CODE>HOST_BITS_PER_WIDE_INT</CODE>
bits but small enough to fit within twice that number of bits (GNU CC
does not provide a mechanism to represent even larger constants).  In
the latter case, <VAR>m</VAR> will be <CODE>VOIDmode</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX367"></A>
<A NAME="IDX368"></A>
<VAR>addr</VAR> is used to contain the <CODE>mem</CODE> expression that corresponds
to the location in memory that at which the constant can be found.  If
it has not been allocated a memory location, but is on the chain of all
<CODE>const_double</CODE> expressions in this compilation (maintained using an
undisplayed field), <VAR>addr</VAR> contains <CODE>const0_rtx</CODE>.  If it is not
on the chain, <VAR>addr</VAR> contains <CODE>cc0_rtx</CODE>.  <VAR>addr</VAR> is
customarily accessed with the macro <CODE>CONST_DOUBLE_MEM</CODE> and the
chain field via <CODE>CONST_DOUBLE_CHAIN</CODE>.</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX369"></A>
If <VAR>m</VAR> is <CODE>VOIDmode</CODE>, the bits of the value are stored in
<VAR>i0</VAR> and <VAR>i1</VAR>.  <VAR>i0</VAR> is customarily accessed with the macro
<CODE>CONST_DOUBLE_LOW</CODE> and <VAR>i1</VAR> with <CODE>CONST_DOUBLE_HIGH</CODE>.
</P><P>

If the constant is floating point (either single or double precision),
then the number of integers used to store the value depends on the size
of <CODE>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC197">14.18 Cross Compilation and Floating Point Format</A>).  The integers
represent a <CODE>double</CODE>.  To convert them to a <CODE>double</CODE>, do
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>union real_extract u;
bcopy (&#38;CONST_DOUBLE_LOW (x), &#38;u, sizeof u);
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

and then refer to <CODE>u.d</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX370"></A>
<A NAME="IDX371"></A>
<A NAME="IDX372"></A>
The macro <CODE>CONST0_RTX (<VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE> refers to an expression with
value 0 in mode <VAR>mode</VAR>. If mode <VAR>mode</VAR> is of mode class
<CODE>MODE_INT</CODE>, it returns <CODE>const0_rtx</CODE>.  Otherwise, it returns a
<CODE>CONST_DOUBLE</CODE> expression in mode <VAR>mode</VAR>.  Similarly, the macro
<CODE>CONST1_RTX (<VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE> refers to an expression with value 1 in
mode <VAR>mode</VAR> and similarly for <CODE>CONST2_RTX</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX373"></A>
<DT><CODE>(const_string <VAR>str</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Represents a constant string with value <VAR>str</VAR>.  Currently this is
used only for insn attributes (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC140">13.15 Instruction Attributes</A>) since constant
strings in C are placed in memory.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX374"></A>
<DT><CODE>(symbol_ref:<VAR>mode</VAR> <VAR>symbol</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Represents the value of an assembler label for data.  <VAR>symbol</VAR> is
a string that describes the name of the assembler label.  If it starts
with a <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>, the label is the rest of <VAR>symbol</VAR> not including
the <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>.  Otherwise, the label is <VAR>symbol</VAR>, usually prefixed
with <SAMP>`_'</SAMP>.
<P>

The <CODE>symbol_ref</CODE> contains a mode, which is usually <CODE>Pmode</CODE>.
Usually that is the only mode for which a symbol is directly valid.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX375"></A>
<DT><CODE>(label_ref <VAR>label</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Represents the value of an assembler label for code.  It contains one
operand, an expression, which must be a <CODE>code_label</CODE> that appears
in the instruction sequence to identify the place where the label
should go.
<P>

The reason for using a distinct expression type for code label
references is so that jump optimization can distinguish them.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>(const:<VAR>m</VAR> <VAR>exp</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Represents a constant that is the result of an assembly-time
arithmetic computation.  The operand, <VAR>exp</VAR>, is an expression that
contains only constants (<CODE>const_int</CODE>, <CODE>symbol_ref</CODE> and
<CODE>label_ref</CODE> expressions) combined with <CODE>plus</CODE> and
<CODE>minus</CODE>.  However, not all combinations are valid, since the
assembler cannot do arbitrary arithmetic on relocatable symbols.
<P>

<VAR>m</VAR> should be <CODE>Pmode</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX376"></A>
<DT><CODE>(high:<VAR>m</VAR> <VAR>exp</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Represents the high-order bits of <VAR>exp</VAR>, usually a
<CODE>symbol_ref</CODE>.  The number of bits is machine-dependent and is
normally the number of bits specified in an instruction that initializes
the high order bits of a register.  It is used with <CODE>lo_sum</CODE> to
represent the typical two-instruction sequence used in RISC machines to
reference a global memory location.
<P>

<VAR>m</VAR> should be <CODE>Pmode</CODE>.

<H2> 12.6 Registers and Memory </H2>
<!--docid::SEC108::-->
<P>

Here are the RTL expression types for describing access to machine
registers and to main memory.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX377"></A>
<A NAME="IDX378"></A>
<A NAME="IDX379"></A>
<DT><CODE>(reg:<VAR>m</VAR> <VAR>n</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>For small values of the integer <VAR>n</VAR> (less than
<CODE>FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER</CODE>), this stands for a reference to machine
register number <VAR>n</VAR>: a <EM>hard register</EM>.  For larger values of
<VAR>n</VAR>, it stands for a temporary value or <EM>pseudo register</EM>.
The compiler's strategy is to generate code assuming an unlimited
number of such pseudo registers, and later convert them into hard
registers or into memory references.
<P>

<VAR>m</VAR> is the machine mode of the reference.  It is necessary because
machines can generally refer to each register in more than one mode.
For example, a register may contain a full word but there may be
instructions to refer to it as a half word or as a single byte, as
well as instructions to refer to it as a floating point number of
various precisions.
</P><P>

Even for a register that the machine can access in only one mode,
the mode must always be specified.
</P><P>

The symbol <CODE>FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER</CODE> is defined by the machine
description, since the number of hard registers on the machine is an
invariant characteristic of the machine.  Note, however, that not
all of the machine registers must be general registers.  All the
machine registers that can be used for storage of data are given
hard register numbers, even those that can be used only in certain
instructions or can hold only certain types of data.
</P><P>

A hard register may be accessed in various modes throughout one
function, but each pseudo register is given a natural mode
and is accessed only in that mode.  When it is necessary to describe
an access to a pseudo register using a nonnatural mode, a <CODE>subreg</CODE>
expression is used.
</P><P>

A <CODE>reg</CODE> expression with a machine mode that specifies more than
one word of data may actually stand for several consecutive registers.
If in addition the register number specifies a hardware register, then
it actually represents several consecutive hardware registers starting
with the specified one.
</P><P>

Each pseudo register number used in a function's RTL code is
represented by a unique <CODE>reg</CODE> expression.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX380"></A>
<A NAME="IDX381"></A>
Some pseudo register numbers, those within the range of
<CODE>FIRST_VIRTUAL_REGISTER</CODE> to <CODE>LAST_VIRTUAL_REGISTER</CODE> only
appear during the RTL generation phase and are eliminated before the
optimization phases.  These represent locations in the stack frame that
cannot be determined until RTL generation for the function has been
completed.  The following virtual register numbers are defined:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX382"></A>
<DT><CODE>VIRTUAL_INCOMING_ARGS_REGNUM</CODE>
<DD>This points to the first word of the incoming arguments passed on the
stack.  Normally these arguments are placed there by the caller, but the
callee may have pushed some arguments that were previously passed in
registers.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX383"></A>
<A NAME="IDX384"></A>
When RTL generation is complete, this virtual register is replaced
by the sum of the register given by <CODE>ARG_POINTER_REGNUM</CODE> and the
value of <CODE>FIRST_PARM_OFFSET</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX385"></A>
<A NAME="IDX386"></A>
<DT><CODE>VIRTUAL_STACK_VARS_REGNUM</CODE>
<DD>If <CODE>FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARDS</CODE> is defined, this points to immediately
above the first variable on the stack.  Otherwise, it points to the
first variable on the stack.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX387"></A>
<A NAME="IDX388"></A>
It is replaced with the sum of the register given by
<CODE>FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM</CODE> and the value <CODE>STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX389"></A>
<DT><CODE>VIRTUAL_STACK_DYNAMIC_REGNUM</CODE>
<DD>This points to the location of dynamically allocated memory on the stack
immediately after the stack pointer has been adjusted by the amount of
memory desired.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX390"></A>
<A NAME="IDX391"></A>
It is replaced by the sum of the register given by
<CODE>STACK_POINTER_REGNUM</CODE> and the value <CODE>STACK_DYNAMIC_OFFSET</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX392"></A>
<DT><CODE>VIRTUAL_OUTGOING_ARGS_REGNUM</CODE>
<DD>This points to the location in the stack at which outgoing arguments
should be written when the stack is pre-pushed (arguments pushed using
push insns should always use <CODE>STACK_POINTER_REGNUM</CODE>).
<P>

<A NAME="IDX393"></A>
It is replaced by the sum of the register given by
<CODE>STACK_POINTER_REGNUM</CODE> and the value <CODE>STACK_POINTER_OFFSET</CODE>.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="IDX394"></A>
<DT><CODE>(subreg:<VAR>m</VAR> <VAR>reg</VAR> <VAR>wordnum</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><CODE>subreg</CODE> expressions are used to refer to a register in a machine
mode other than its natural one, or to refer to one register of
a multi-word <CODE>reg</CODE> that actually refers to several registers.
<P>

Each pseudo-register has a natural mode.  If it is necessary to
operate on it in a different mode--for example, to perform a fullword
move instruction on a pseudo-register that contains a single
byte--the pseudo-register must be enclosed in a <CODE>subreg</CODE>.  In
such a case, <VAR>wordnum</VAR> is zero.
</P><P>

Usually <VAR>m</VAR> is at least as narrow as the mode of <VAR>reg</VAR>, in which
case it is restricting consideration to only the bits of <VAR>reg</VAR> that
are in <VAR>m</VAR>.  However, sometimes <VAR>m</VAR> is wider than the mode of
<VAR>reg</VAR>.  These <CODE>subreg</CODE> expressions are often called
<EM>paradoxical</EM>.  They are used in cases where we want to refer to an
object in a wider mode but do not care what value the additional bits
have.  The reload pass ensures that paradoxical references are only
made to hard registers.
</P><P>

The other use of <CODE>subreg</CODE> is to extract the individual registers of
a multi-register value.  Machine modes such as <CODE>DImode</CODE> and
<CODE>TImode</CODE> can indicate values longer than a word, values which
usually require two or more consecutive registers.  To access one of the
registers, use a <CODE>subreg</CODE> with mode <CODE>SImode</CODE> and a
<VAR>wordnum</VAR> that says which register.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX395"></A>
The compilation parameter <CODE>WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN</CODE>, if set to 1, says
that word number zero is the most significant part; otherwise, it is
the least significant part.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX396"></A>
<A NAME="IDX397"></A>
<A NAME="IDX398"></A>
Between the combiner pass and the reload pass, it is possible to have a
paradoxical <CODE>subreg</CODE> which contains a <CODE>mem</CODE> instead of a
<CODE>reg</CODE> as its first operand.  After the reload pass, it is also
possible to have a non-paradoxical <CODE>subreg</CODE> which contains a
<CODE>mem</CODE>; this usually occurs when the <CODE>mem</CODE> is a stack slot
which replaced a pseudo register.
</P><P>

Note that it is not valid to access a <CODE>DFmode</CODE> value in <CODE>SFmode</CODE>
using a <CODE>subreg</CODE>.  On some machines the most significant part of a
<CODE>DFmode</CODE> value does not have the same format as a single-precision
floating value.
</P><P>

It is also not valid to access a single word of a multi-word value in a
hard register when less registers can hold the value than would be
expected from its size.  For example, some 32-bit machines have
floating-point registers that can hold an entire <CODE>DFmode</CODE> value.
If register 10 were such a register <CODE>(subreg:SI (reg:DF 10) 1)</CODE>
would be invalid because there is no way to convert that reference to
a single machine register.  The reload pass prevents <CODE>subreg</CODE>
expressions such as these from being formed.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX399"></A>
<A NAME="IDX400"></A>
The first operand of a <CODE>subreg</CODE> expression is customarily accessed 
with the <CODE>SUBREG_REG</CODE> macro and the second operand is customarily
accessed with the <CODE>SUBREG_WORD</CODE> macro.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX401"></A>
<A NAME="IDX402"></A>
<DT><CODE>(scratch:<VAR>m</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>This represents a scratch register that will be required for the
execution of a single instruction and not used subsequently.  It is
converted into a <CODE>reg</CODE> by either the local register allocator or
the reload pass.
<P>

<CODE>scratch</CODE> is usually present inside a <CODE>clobber</CODE> operation
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC114">12.12 Side Effect Expressions</A>).
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX403"></A>
<A NAME="IDX404"></A>
<DT><CODE>(cc0)</CODE>
<DD>This refers to the machine's condition code register.  It has no
operands and may not have a machine mode.  There are two ways to use it:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>
To stand for a complete set of condition code flags.  This is best on
most machines, where each comparison sets the entire series of flags.
<P>

With this technique, <CODE>(cc0)</CODE> may be validly used in only two
contexts: as the destination of an assignment (in test and compare
instructions) and in comparison operators comparing against zero
(<CODE>const_int</CODE> with value zero; that is to say, <CODE>const0_rtx</CODE>).
</P><P>

<LI>
To stand for a single flag that is the result of a single condition.
This is useful on machines that have only a single flag bit, and in
which comparison instructions must specify the condition to test.
<P>

With this technique, <CODE>(cc0)</CODE> may be validly used in only two
contexts: as the destination of an assignment (in test and compare
instructions) where the source is a comparison operator, and as the
first operand of <CODE>if_then_else</CODE> (in a conditional branch).
</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="IDX405"></A>
There is only one expression object of code <CODE>cc0</CODE>; it is the
value of the variable <CODE>cc0_rtx</CODE>.  Any attempt to create an
expression of code <CODE>cc0</CODE> will return <CODE>cc0_rtx</CODE>.
</P><P>

Instructions can set the condition code implicitly.  On many machines,
nearly all instructions set the condition code based on the value that
they compute or store.  It is not necessary to record these actions
explicitly in the RTL because the machine description includes a
prescription for recognizing the instructions that do so (by means of
the macro <CODE>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</CODE>).  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC177">14.12 Condition Code Status</A>.  Only
instructions whose sole purpose is to set the condition code, and
instructions that use the condition code, need mention <CODE>(cc0)</CODE>.
</P><P>

On some machines, the condition code register is given a register number
and a <CODE>reg</CODE> is used instead of <CODE>(cc0)</CODE>.  This is usually the
preferable approach if only a small subset of instructions modify the
condition code.  Other machines store condition codes in general
registers; in such cases a pseudo register should be used.
</P><P>

Some machines, such as the Sparc and RS/6000, have two sets of
arithmetic instructions, one that sets and one that does not set the
condition code.  This is best handled by normally generating the
instruction that does not set the condition code, and making a pattern
that both performs the arithmetic and sets the condition code register
(which would not be <CODE>(cc0)</CODE> in this case).  For examples, search
for <SAMP>`addcc'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`andcc'</SAMP> in <TT>`sparc.md'</TT>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX406"></A>
<DT><CODE>(pc)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX407"></A>
This represents the machine's program counter.  It has no operands and
may not have a machine mode.  <CODE>(pc)</CODE> may be validly used only in
certain specific contexts in jump instructions.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX408"></A>
There is only one expression object of code <CODE>pc</CODE>; it is the value
of the variable <CODE>pc_rtx</CODE>.  Any attempt to create an expression of
code <CODE>pc</CODE> will return <CODE>pc_rtx</CODE>.
</P><P>

All instructions that do not jump alter the program counter implicitly
by incrementing it, but there is no need to mention this in the RTL.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX409"></A>
<DT><CODE>(mem:<VAR>m</VAR> <VAR>addr</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>This RTX represents a reference to main memory at an address
represented by the expression <VAR>addr</VAR>.  <VAR>m</VAR> specifies how large
a unit of memory is accessed.

<DT><CODE>(compare:<VAR>m</VAR> <VAR>x</VAR> <VAR>y</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Represents the result of subtracting <VAR>y</VAR> from <VAR>x</VAR> for purposes

infinite precision.
<P>

Of course, machines can't really subtract with infinite precision.
However, they can pretend to do so when only the sign of the

may validly be used: as a value to be stored in the condition codes.

The mode <VAR>m</VAR> is not related to the modes of <VAR>x</VAR> and <VAR>y</VAR>,
but instead is the mode of the condition code value.  If <CODE>(cc0)</CODE>
is used, it is <CODE>VOIDmode</CODE>.  Otherwise it is some mode in class
<CODE>MODE_CC</CODE>, often <CODE>CCmode</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC177">14.12 Condition Code Status</A>.

Normally, <VAR>x</VAR> and <VAR>y</VAR> must have the same mode.  Otherwise,
<CODE>compare</CODE> is valid only if the mode of <VAR>x</VAR> is in class

A <CODE>compare</CODE> specifying two <CODE>VOIDmode</CODE> constants is not valid

<H2> 12.8 Comparison Operations </H2>
<!--docid::SEC110::-->
<P>

Comparison operators test a relation on two operands and are considered
to represent a machine-dependent nonzero value described by, but not
necessarily equal to, <CODE>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC198">14.19 Miscellaneous Parameters</A>)
if the relation holds, or zero if it does not.  The mode of the
comparison operation is independent of the mode of the data being
compared.  If the comparison operation is being tested (e.g., the first
operand of an <CODE>if_then_else</CODE>), the mode must be <CODE>VOIDmode</CODE>.
If the comparison operation is producing data to be stored in some
variable, the mode must be in class <CODE>MODE_INT</CODE>.  All comparison
operations producing data must use the same mode, which is
machine-specific.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX473"></A>
There are two ways that comparison operations may be used.  The
comparison operators may be used to compare the condition codes
<CODE>(cc0)</CODE> against zero, as in <CODE>(eq (cc0) (const_int 0))</CODE>.  Such
a construct actually refers to the result of the preceding instruction
in which the condition codes were set.  The instructing setting the
condition code must be adjacent to the instruction using the condition
code; only <CODE>note</CODE> insns may separate them.
</P><P>

Alternatively, a comparison operation may directly compare two data
objects.  The mode of the comparison is determined by the operands; they
must both be valid for a common machine mode.  A comparison with both
operands constant would be invalid as the machine mode could not be
deduced from it, but such a comparison should never exist in RTL due to
constant folding.
</P><P>

In the example above, if <CODE>(cc0)</CODE> were last set to
<CODE>(compare <VAR>x</VAR> <VAR>y</VAR>)</CODE>, the comparison operation is
identical to <CODE>(eq <VAR>x</VAR> <VAR>y</VAR>)</CODE>.  Usually only one style
of comparisons is supported on a particular machine, but the combine
pass will try to merge the operations to produce the <CODE>eq</CODE> shown
in case it exists in the context of the particular insn involved.
</P><P>

Inequality comparisons come in two flavors, signed and unsigned.  Thus,
there are distinct expression codes <CODE>gt</CODE> and <CODE>gtu</CODE> for signed and
unsigned greater-than.  These can produce different results for the same
pair of integer values: for example, 1 is signed greater-than -1 but not
unsigned greater-than, because -1 when regarded as unsigned is actually
<CODE>0xffffffff</CODE> which is greater than 1.
</P><P>

The signed comparisons are also used for floating point values.  Floating
point comparisons are distinguished by the machine modes of the operands.

<H2> 12.10 Conversions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC112::-->
<P>

All conversions between machine modes must be represented by
explicit conversion operations.  For example, an expression
which is the sum of a byte and a full word cannot be written as
<CODE>(plus:SI (reg:QI 34) (reg:SI 80))</CODE> because the <CODE>plus</CODE>
operation requires two operands of the same machine mode.
Therefore, the byte-sized operand is enclosed in a conversion
operation, as in

The conversion operation is not a mere placeholder, because there
may be more than one way of converting from a given starting mode
to the desired final mode.  The conversion operation code says how
to do it.
</P><P>

For all conversion operations, <VAR>x</VAR> must not be <CODE>VOIDmode</CODE>
because the mode in which to do the conversion would not be known.
The conversion must either be done at compile-time or <VAR>x</VAR>
must be placed into a register.

<H2> 12.12 Side Effect Expressions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC114::-->
<P>

The expression codes described so far represent values, not actions.
But machine instructions never produce values; they are meaningful
only for their side effects on the state of the machine.  Special
expression codes are used to represent side effects.
</P><P>

The body of an instruction is always one of these side effect codes;
the codes described above, which represent values, appear only as
the operands of these.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX512"></A>
<DT><CODE>(set <VAR>lval</VAR> <VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Represents the action of storing the value of <VAR>x</VAR> into the place
represented by <VAR>lval</VAR>.  <VAR>lval</VAR> must be an expression
representing a place that can be stored in: <CODE>reg</CODE> (or
<CODE>subreg</CODE> or <CODE>strict_low_part</CODE>), <CODE>mem</CODE>, <CODE>pc</CODE> or
<CODE>cc0</CODE>.<P>

If <VAR>lval</VAR> is a <CODE>reg</CODE>, <CODE>subreg</CODE> or <CODE>mem</CODE>, it has a
machine mode; then <VAR>x</VAR> must be valid for that mode.</P><P>

If <VAR>lval</VAR> is a <CODE>reg</CODE> whose machine mode is less than the full
width of the register, then it means that the part of the register
specified by the machine mode is given the specified value and the
rest of the register receives an undefined value.  Likewise, if
<VAR>lval</VAR> is a <CODE>subreg</CODE> whose machine mode is narrower than
the mode of the register, the rest of the register can be changed in
an undefined way.
</P><P>

If <VAR>lval</VAR> is a <CODE>strict_low_part</CODE> of a <CODE>subreg</CODE>, then the
part of the register specified by the machine mode of the
<CODE>subreg</CODE> is given the value <VAR>x</VAR> and the rest of the register
is not changed.</P><P>

If <VAR>lval</VAR> is <CODE>(cc0)</CODE>, it has no machine mode, and <VAR>x</VAR> may
be either a <CODE>compare</CODE> expression or a value that may have any mode.
The latter case represents a "test" instruction.  The expression
<CODE>(set (cc0) (reg:<VAR>m</VAR> <VAR>n</VAR>))</CODE> is equivalent to
<CODE>(set (cc0) (compare (reg:<VAR>m</VAR> <VAR>n</VAR>) (const_int 0)))</CODE>.
Use the former expression to save space during the compilation.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX513"></A>
<A NAME="IDX514"></A>
If <VAR>lval</VAR> is <CODE>(pc)</CODE>, we have a jump instruction, and the
possibilities for <VAR>x</VAR> are very limited.  It may be a
<CODE>label_ref</CODE> expression (unconditional jump).  It may be an
<CODE>if_then_else</CODE> (conditional jump), in which case either the
second or the third operand must be <CODE>(pc)</CODE> (for the case which
does not jump) and the other of the two must be a <CODE>label_ref</CODE>
(for the case which does jump).  <VAR>x</VAR> may also be a <CODE>mem</CODE> or
<CODE>(plus:SI (pc) <VAR>y</VAR>)</CODE>, where <VAR>y</VAR> may be a <CODE>reg</CODE> or a
<CODE>mem</CODE>; these unusual patterns are used to represent jumps through
branch tables.</P><P>

If <VAR>lval</VAR> is neither <CODE>(cc0)</CODE> nor <CODE>(pc)</CODE>, the mode of
<VAR>lval</VAR> must not be <CODE>VOIDmode</CODE> and the mode of <VAR>x</VAR> must be
valid for the mode of <VAR>lval</VAR>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX515"></A>
<A NAME="IDX516"></A>
<VAR>lval</VAR> is customarily accessed with the <CODE>SET_DEST</CODE> macro and 
<VAR>x</VAR> with the <CODE>SET_SRC</CODE> macro.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX517"></A>
<DT><CODE>(return)</CODE>
<DD>As the sole expression in a pattern, represents a return from the
current function, on machines where this can be done with one
instruction, such as Vaxes.  On machines where a multi-instruction
"epilogue" must be executed in order to return from the function,
returning is done by jumping to a label which precedes the epilogue, and
the <CODE>return</CODE> expression code is never used.
<P>

Inside an <CODE>if_then_else</CODE> expression, represents the value to be
placed in <CODE>pc</CODE> to return to the caller.
</P><P>

Note that an insn pattern of <CODE>(return)</CODE> is logically equivalent to
<CODE>(set (pc) (return))</CODE>, but the latter form is never used.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX518"></A>
<DT><CODE>(call <VAR>function</VAR> <VAR>nargs</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Represents a function call.  <VAR>function</VAR> is a <CODE>mem</CODE> expression
whose address is the address of the function to be called.
<VAR>nargs</VAR> is an expression which can be used for two purposes: on
some machines it represents the number of bytes of stack argument; on
others, it represents the number of argument registers.
<P>

Each machine has a standard machine mode which <VAR>function</VAR> must
have.  The machine description defines macro <CODE>FUNCTION_MODE</CODE> to
expand into the requisite mode name.  The purpose of this mode is to
specify what kind of addressing is allowed, on machines where the
allowed kinds of addressing depend on the machine mode being
addressed.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX519"></A>
<DT><CODE>(clobber <VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Represents the storing or possible storing of an unpredictable,
undescribed value into <VAR>x</VAR>, which must be a <CODE>reg</CODE>,
<CODE>scratch</CODE> or <CODE>mem</CODE> expression.
<P>

One place this is used is in string instructions that store standard
values into particular hard registers.  It may not be worth the
trouble to describe the values that are stored, but it is essential to
inform the compiler that the registers will be altered, lest it
attempt to keep data in them across the string instruction.
</P><P>

If <VAR>x</VAR> is <CODE>(mem:BLK (const_int 0))</CODE>, it means that all memory
locations must be presumed clobbered.
</P><P>

Note that the machine description classifies certain hard registers as
"call-clobbered".  All function call instructions are assumed by
default to clobber these registers, so there is no need to use
<CODE>clobber</CODE> expressions to indicate this fact.  Also, each function
call is assumed to have the potential to alter any memory location,
unless the function is declared <CODE>const</CODE>.
</P><P>

If the last group of expressions in a <CODE>parallel</CODE> are each a
<CODE>clobber</CODE> expression whose arguments are <CODE>reg</CODE> or
<CODE>match_scratch</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC123">13.3 RTL Template for Generating and Recognizing Insns</A>) expressions, the combiner
phase can add the appropriate <CODE>clobber</CODE> expressions to an insn it
has constructed when doing so will cause a pattern to be matched.
</P><P>

This feature can be used, for example, on a machine that whose multiply
and add instructions don't use an MQ register but which has an
add-accumulate instruction that does clobber the MQ register.  Similarly,
a combined instruction might require a temporary register while the
constituent instructions might not.
</P><P>

When a <CODE>clobber</CODE> expression for a register appears inside a
<CODE>parallel</CODE> with other side effects, the register allocator
guarantees that the register is unoccupied both before and after that
insn.  However, the reload phase may allocate a register used for one of
the inputs unless the <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> constraint is specified for the selected
alternative (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC130">13.6.4 Constraint Modifier Characters</A>).  You can clobber either a specific hard
register, a pseudo register, or a <CODE>scratch</CODE> expression; in the
latter two cases, GNU CC will allocate a hard register that is available
there for use as a temporary.
</P><P>

For instructions that require a temporary register, you should use
<CODE>scratch</CODE> instead of a pseudo-register because this will allow the
combiner phase to add the <CODE>clobber</CODE> when required.  You do this by
coding (<CODE>clobber</CODE> (<CODE>match_scratch</CODE> <small>...</small>)).  If you do
clobber a pseudo register, use one which appears nowhere else--generate
a new one each time.  Otherwise, you may confuse CSE.
</P><P>

There is one other known use for clobbering a pseudo register in a
<CODE>parallel</CODE>: when one of the input operands of the insn is also
clobbered by the insn.  In this case, using the same pseudo register in
the clobber and elsewhere in the insn produces the expected results.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX520"></A>
<DT><CODE>(use <VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Represents the use of the value of <VAR>x</VAR>.  It indicates that the
value in <VAR>x</VAR> at this point in the program is needed, even though
it may not be apparent why this is so.  Therefore, the compiler will
not attempt to delete previous instructions whose only effect is to
store a value in <VAR>x</VAR>.  <VAR>x</VAR> must be a <CODE>reg</CODE> expression.
<P>

During the delayed branch scheduling phase, <VAR>x</VAR> may be an insn.
This indicates that <VAR>x</VAR> previously was located at this place in the
code and its data dependencies need to be taken into account.  These
<CODE>use</CODE> insns will be deleted before the delayed branch scheduling
phase exits.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX521"></A>
<DT><CODE>(parallel [<VAR>x0</VAR> <VAR>x1</VAR> <small>...</small>])</CODE>
<DD>Represents several side effects performed in parallel.  The square
brackets stand for a vector; the operand of <CODE>parallel</CODE> is a
vector of expressions.  <VAR>x0</VAR>, <VAR>x1</VAR> and so on are individual
side effect expressions--expressions of code <CODE>set</CODE>, <CODE>call</CODE>,
<CODE>return</CODE>, <CODE>clobber</CODE> or <CODE>use</CODE>.<P>

"In parallel" means that first all the values used in the individual
side-effects are computed, and second all the actual side-effects are
performed.  For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(parallel [(set (reg:SI 1) (mem:SI (reg:SI 1)))
           (set (mem:SI (reg:SI 1)) (reg:SI 1))])
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

says unambiguously that the values of hard register 1 and the memory
location addressed by it are interchanged.  In both places where
<CODE>(reg:SI 1)</CODE> appears as a memory address it refers to the value
in register 1 <EM>before</EM> the execution of the insn.
</P><P>

It follows that it is <EM>incorrect</EM> to use <CODE>parallel</CODE> and
expect the result of one <CODE>set</CODE> to be available for the next one.
For example, people sometimes attempt to represent a jump-if-zero
instruction this way:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(parallel [(set (cc0) (reg:SI 34))
           (set (pc) (if_then_else
                        (eq (cc0) (const_int 0))
                        (label_ref <small>...</small>)
                        (pc)))])
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

But this is incorrect, because it says that the jump condition depends
on the condition code value <EM>before</EM> this instruction, not on the
new value that is set by this instruction.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX522"></A>
Peephole optimization, which takes place together with final assembly
code output, can produce insns whose patterns consist of a <CODE>parallel</CODE>
whose elements are the operands needed to output the resulting
assembler code--often <CODE>reg</CODE>, <CODE>mem</CODE> or constant expressions.
This would not be well-formed RTL at any other stage in compilation,
but it is ok then because no further optimization remains to be done.
However, the definition of the macro <CODE>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</CODE>, if
any, must deal with such insns if you define any peephole optimizations.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX523"></A>
<DT><CODE>(sequence [<VAR>insns</VAR> <small>...</small>])</CODE>
<DD>Represents a sequence of insns.  Each of the <VAR>insns</VAR> that appears
in the vector is suitable for appearing in the chain of insns, so it
must be an <CODE>insn</CODE>, <CODE>jump_insn</CODE>, <CODE>call_insn</CODE>,
<CODE>code_label</CODE>, <CODE>barrier</CODE> or <CODE>note</CODE>.
<P>

A <CODE>sequence</CODE> RTX is never placed in an actual insn during RTL
generation.  It represents the sequence of insns that result from a
<CODE>define_expand</CODE> <EM>before</EM> those insns are passed to
<CODE>emit_insn</CODE> to insert them in the chain of insns.  When actually
inserted, the individual sub-insns are separated out and the
<CODE>sequence</CODE> is forgotten.
</P><P>

After delay-slot scheduling is completed, an insn and all the insns that
reside in its delay slots are grouped together into a <CODE>sequence</CODE>.
The insn requiring the delay slot is the first insn in the vector;
subsequent insns are to be placed in the delay slot.
</P><P>

<CODE>INSN_ANNULLED_BRANCH_P</CODE> is set on an insn in a delay slot to
indicate that a branch insn should be used that will conditionally annul
the effect of the insns in the delay slots.  In such a case,
<CODE>INSN_FROM_TARGET_P</CODE> indicates that the insn is from the target of
the branch and should be executed only if the branch is taken; otherwise
the insn should be executed only if the branch is not taken.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC147">13.15.7 Delay Slot Scheduling</A>.

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX529"></A>
<DT><CODE>(pre_dec:<VAR>m</VAR> <VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Represents the side effect of decrementing <VAR>x</VAR> by a standard
amount and represents also the value that <VAR>x</VAR> has after being
decremented.  <VAR>x</VAR> must be a <CODE>reg</CODE> or <CODE>mem</CODE>, but most
machines allow only a <CODE>reg</CODE>.  <VAR>m</VAR> must be the machine mode
for pointers on the machine in use.  The amount <VAR>x</VAR> is decremented
by is the length in bytes of the machine mode of the containing memory
reference of which this expression serves as the address.  Here is an
example of its use:<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(mem:DF (pre_dec:SI (reg:SI 39)))

<P>

<A NAME="IDX531"></A>
<DT><CODE>(post_dec:<VAR>m</VAR> <VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Represents the same side effect as <CODE>pre_dec</CODE> but a different
value.  The value represented here is the value <VAR>x</VAR> has <I>before</I>
being decremented.

<A NAME="IDX532"></A>

<DD>Similar, but specifies incrementing <VAR>x</VAR> instead of decrementing it.
</DL>
<P>

These embedded side effect expressions must be used with care.  Instruction
patterns may not use them.  Until the <SAMP>`flow'</SAMP> pass of the compiler,
they may occur only to represent pushes onto the stack.  The <SAMP>`flow'</SAMP>
pass finds cases where registers are incremented or decremented in one
instruction and used as an address shortly before or after; these cases are
then transformed to use pre- or post-increment or -decrement.
</P><P>

If a register used as the operand of these expressions is used in
another address in an insn, the original value of the register is used.
Uses of the register outside of an address are not permitted within the
same insn as a use in an embedded side effect expression because such
insns behave differently on different machines and hence must be treated
as ambiguous and disallowed.
</P><P>

An instruction that can be represented with an embedded side effect
could also be represented using <CODE>parallel</CODE> containing an additional
<CODE>set</CODE> to describe how the address register is altered.  This is not
done because machines that allow these operations at all typically
allow them wherever a memory address is called for.  Describing them as
additional parallel stores would require doubling the number of entries
in the machine description.

<H2> 12.14 Assembler Instructions as Expressions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC116::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX533"></A>
The RTX code <CODE>asm_operands</CODE> represents a value produced by a
user-specified assembler instruction.  It is used to represent
an <CODE>asm</CODE> statement with arguments.  An <CODE>asm</CODE> statement with
a single output operand, like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>asm ("foo %1,%2,%0" : "=a" (outputvar) : "g" (x + y), "di" (*z));
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

is represented using a single <CODE>asm_operands</CODE> RTX which represents
the value that is stored in <CODE>outputvar</CODE>:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(set <VAR>rtx-for-outputvar</VAR>
     (asm_operands "foo %1,%2,%0" "a" 0
                   [<VAR>rtx-for-addition-result</VAR> <VAR>rtx-for-*z</VAR>]
                   [(asm_input:<VAR>m1</VAR> "g")
                    (asm_input:<VAR>m2</VAR> "di")]))
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here the operands of the <CODE>asm_operands</CODE> RTX are the assembler
template string, the output-operand's constraint, the index-number of the
output operand among the output operands specified, a vector of input
operand RTX's, and a vector of input-operand modes and constraints.  The
mode <VAR>m1</VAR> is the mode of the sum <CODE>x+y</CODE>; <VAR>m2</VAR> is that of
<CODE>*z</CODE>.
</P><P>

When an <CODE>asm</CODE> statement has multiple output values, its insn has
several such <CODE>set</CODE> RTX's inside of a <CODE>parallel</CODE>.  Each <CODE>set</CODE>
contains a <CODE>asm_operands</CODE>; all of these share the same assembler
template and vectors, but each contains the constraint for the respective
output operand.  They are also distinguished by the output-operand index
number, which is 0, 1, <small>...</small> for successive output operands.

<H2> 12.15 Insns </H2>
<!--docid::SEC117::-->
<P>

The RTL representation of the code for a function is a doubly-linked
chain of objects called <EM>insns</EM>.  Insns are expressions with
special codes that are used for no other purpose.  Some insns are
actual instructions; others represent dispatch tables for <CODE>switch</CODE>
statements; others represent labels to jump to or various sorts of
declarative information.
</P><P>

In addition to its own specific data, each insn must have a unique
id-number that distinguishes it from all other insns in the current
function (after delayed branch scheduling, copies of an insn with the
same id-number may be present in multiple places in a function, but
these copies will always be identical and will only appear inside a
<CODE>sequence</CODE>), and chain pointers to the preceding and following
insns.  These three fields occupy the same position in every insn,
independent of the expression code of the insn.  They could be accessed
with <CODE>XEXP</CODE> and <CODE>XINT</CODE>, but instead three special macros are
always used:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX534"></A>
<DT><CODE>INSN_UID (<VAR>i</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Accesses the unique id of insn <VAR>i</VAR>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX535"></A>
<DT><CODE>PREV_INSN (<VAR>i</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Accesses the chain pointer to the insn preceding <VAR>i</VAR>.
If <VAR>i</VAR> is the first insn, this is a null pointer.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX536"></A>
<DT><CODE>NEXT_INSN (<VAR>i</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Accesses the chain pointer to the insn following <VAR>i</VAR>.
If <VAR>i</VAR> is the last insn, this is a null pointer.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="IDX537"></A>
<A NAME="IDX538"></A>
The first insn in the chain is obtained by calling <CODE>get_insns</CODE>; the
last insn is the result of calling <CODE>get_last_insn</CODE>.  Within the
chain delimited by these insns, the <CODE>NEXT_INSN</CODE> and
<CODE>PREV_INSN</CODE> pointers must always correspond: if <VAR>insn</VAR> is not
the first insn,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>NEXT_INSN (PREV_INSN (<VAR>insn</VAR>)) == <VAR>insn</VAR>
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

is always true and if <VAR>insn</VAR> is not the last insn,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>PREV_INSN (NEXT_INSN (<VAR>insn</VAR>)) == <VAR>insn</VAR>
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

is always true.
</P><P>

After delay slot scheduling, some of the insns in the chain might be
<CODE>sequence</CODE> expressions, which contain a vector of insns.  The value
of <CODE>NEXT_INSN</CODE> in all but the last of these insns is the next insn
in the vector; the value of <CODE>NEXT_INSN</CODE> of the last insn in the vector
is the same as the value of <CODE>NEXT_INSN</CODE> for the <CODE>sequence</CODE> in
which it is contained.  Similar rules apply for <CODE>PREV_INSN</CODE>.
</P><P>

This means that the above invariants are not necessarily true for insns
inside <CODE>sequence</CODE> expressions.  Specifically, if <VAR>insn</VAR> is the
first insn in a <CODE>sequence</CODE>, <CODE>NEXT_INSN (PREV_INSN (<VAR>insn</VAR>))</CODE>
is the insn containing the <CODE>sequence</CODE> expression, as is the value
of <CODE>PREV_INSN (NEXT_INSN (<VAR>insn</VAR>))</CODE> is <VAR>insn</VAR> is the last
insn in the <CODE>sequence</CODE> expression.  You can use these expressions
to find the containing <CODE>sequence</CODE> expression.</P><P>

Every insn has one of the following six expression codes:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX539"></A>
<DT><CODE>insn</CODE>
<DD>The expression code <CODE>insn</CODE> is used for instructions that do not jump
and do not do function calls.  <CODE>sequence</CODE> expressions are always
contained in insns with code <CODE>insn</CODE> even if one of those insns
should jump or do function calls.
<P>

Insns with code <CODE>insn</CODE> have four additional fields beyond the three
mandatory ones listed above.  These four are described in a table below.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX540"></A>
<DT><CODE>jump_insn</CODE>
<DD>The expression code <CODE>jump_insn</CODE> is used for instructions that may
jump (or, more generally, may contain <CODE>label_ref</CODE> expressions).  If
there is an instruction to return from the current function, it is
recorded as a <CODE>jump_insn</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX541"></A>
<CODE>jump_insn</CODE> insns have the same extra fields as <CODE>insn</CODE> insns,
accessed in the same way and in addition contains a field
<CODE>JUMP_LABEL</CODE> which is defined once jump optimization has completed.
</P><P>

For simple conditional and unconditional jumps, this field contains the
<CODE>code_label</CODE> to which this insn will (possibly conditionally)
branch.  In a more complex jump, <CODE>JUMP_LABEL</CODE> records one of the
labels that the insn refers to; the only way to find the others
is to scan the entire body of the insn.
</P><P>

Return insns count as jumps, but since they do not refer to any labels,
they have zero in the <CODE>JUMP_LABEL</CODE> field.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX542"></A>
<DT><CODE>call_insn</CODE>
<DD>The expression code <CODE>call_insn</CODE> is used for instructions that may do
function calls.  It is important to distinguish these instructions because
they imply that certain registers and memory locations may be altered
unpredictably.
<P>

A <CODE>call_insn</CODE> insn may be preceded by insns that contain a single
<CODE>use</CODE> expression and be followed by insns the contain a single
<CODE>clobber</CODE> expression.  If so, these <CODE>use</CODE> and <CODE>clobber</CODE>
expressions are treated as being part of the function call.
There must not even be a <CODE>note</CODE> between the <CODE>call_insn</CODE> and
the <CODE>use</CODE> or <CODE>clobber</CODE> insns for this special treatment to
take place.  This is somewhat of a kludge and will be removed in a later
version of GNU CC.
</P><P>

<CODE>call_insn</CODE> insns have the same extra fields as <CODE>insn</CODE> insns,
accessed in the same way.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX543"></A>
<A NAME="IDX544"></A>
<DT><CODE>code_label</CODE>
<DD>A <CODE>code_label</CODE> insn represents a label that a jump insn can jump
to.  It contains two special fields of data in addition to the three
standard ones.  <CODE>CODE_LABEL_NUMBER</CODE> is used to hold the <EM>label
number</EM>, a number that identifies this label uniquely among all the
labels in the compilation (not just in the current function).
Ultimately, the label is represented in the assembler output as an
assembler label, usually of the form <SAMP>`L<VAR>n</VAR>'</SAMP> where <VAR>n</VAR> is
the label number.
<P>

When a <CODE>code_label</CODE> appears in an RTL expression, it normally
appears within a <CODE>label_ref</CODE> which represents the address of
the label, as a number.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX545"></A>
The field <CODE>LABEL_NUSES</CODE> is only defined once the jump optimization
phase is completed and contains the number of times this label is
referenced in the current function.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX546"></A>
<DT><CODE>barrier</CODE>
<DD>Barriers are placed in the instruction stream when control cannot flow
past them.  They are placed after unconditional jump instructions to
indicate that the jumps are unconditional and after calls to
<CODE>volatile</CODE> functions, which do not return (e.g., <CODE>exit</CODE>).
They contain no information beyond the three standard fields.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX547"></A>
<A NAME="IDX548"></A>
<A NAME="IDX549"></A>
<DT><CODE>note</CODE>
<DD><CODE>note</CODE> insns are used to represent additional debugging and
declarative information.  They contain two nonstandard fields, an
integer which is accessed with the macro <CODE>NOTE_LINE_NUMBER</CODE> and a
string accessed with <CODE>NOTE_SOURCE_FILE</CODE>.
<P>

If <CODE>NOTE_LINE_NUMBER</CODE> is positive, the note represents the
position of a source line and <CODE>NOTE_SOURCE_FILE</CODE> is the source file name
that the line came from.  These notes control generation of line
number data in the assembler output.
</P><P>

Otherwise, <CODE>NOTE_LINE_NUMBER</CODE> is not really a line number but a
code with one of the following values (and <CODE>NOTE_SOURCE_FILE</CODE>
must contain a null pointer):
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX550"></A>
<DT><CODE>NOTE_INSN_DELETED</CODE>
<DD>Such a note is completely ignorable.  Some passes of the compiler
delete insns by altering them into notes of this kind.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX551"></A>
<A NAME="IDX552"></A>
<DT><CODE>NOTE_INSN_BLOCK_BEG</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>NOTE_INSN_BLOCK_END</CODE>
<DD>These types of notes indicate the position of the beginning and end
of a level of scoping of variable names.  They control the output
of debugging information.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX553"></A>
<A NAME="IDX554"></A>
<DT><CODE>NOTE_INSN_LOOP_BEG</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>NOTE_INSN_LOOP_END</CODE>
<DD>These types of notes indicate the position of the beginning and end
of a <CODE>while</CODE> or <CODE>for</CODE> loop.  They enable the loop optimizer
to find loops quickly.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX555"></A>
<DT><CODE>NOTE_INSN_LOOP_CONT</CODE>
<DD>Appears at the place in a loop that <CODE>continue</CODE> statements jump to.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX556"></A>
<DT><CODE>NOTE_INSN_LOOP_VTOP</CODE>
<DD>This note indicates the place in a loop where the exit test begins for
those loops in which the exit test has been duplicated.  This position
becomes another virtual start of the loop when considering loop
invariants. 
<P>

<A NAME="IDX557"></A>
<DT><CODE>NOTE_INSN_FUNCTION_END</CODE>
<DD>Appears near the end of the function body, just before the label that
<CODE>return</CODE> statements jump to (on machine where a single instruction
does not suffice for returning).  This note may be deleted by jump
optimization.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX558"></A>
<DT><CODE>NOTE_INSN_SETJMP</CODE>
<DD>Appears following each call to <CODE>setjmp</CODE> or a related function.
</DL>
<P>

These codes are printed symbolically when they appear in debugging dumps.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="IDX559"></A>
<A NAME="IDX560"></A>
The machine mode of an insn is normally <CODE>VOIDmode</CODE>, but some
phases use the mode for various purposes; for example, the reload pass
sets it to <CODE>HImode</CODE> if the insn needs reloading but not register
elimination and <CODE>QImode</CODE> if both are required.  The common
subexpression elimination pass sets the mode of an insn to <CODE>QImode</CODE>
when it is the first insn in a block that has already been processed.
</P><P>

Here is a table of the extra fields of <CODE>insn</CODE>, <CODE>jump_insn</CODE>
and <CODE>call_insn</CODE> insns:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX561"></A>
<DT><CODE>PATTERN (<VAR>i</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>An expression for the side effect performed by this insn.  This must be
one of the following codes: <CODE>set</CODE>, <CODE>call</CODE>, <CODE>use</CODE>,
<CODE>clobber</CODE>, <CODE>return</CODE>, <CODE>asm_input</CODE>, <CODE>asm_output</CODE>,
<CODE>addr_vec</CODE>, <CODE>addr_diff_vec</CODE>, <CODE>trap_if</CODE>, <CODE>unspec</CODE>,
<CODE>unspec_volatile</CODE>, <CODE>parallel</CODE>, or <CODE>sequence</CODE>.  If it is a <CODE>parallel</CODE>,
each element of the <CODE>parallel</CODE> must be one these codes, except that
<CODE>parallel</CODE> expressions cannot be nested and <CODE>addr_vec</CODE> and
<CODE>addr_diff_vec</CODE> are not permitted inside a <CODE>parallel</CODE> expression.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX562"></A>
<DT><CODE>INSN_CODE (<VAR>i</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>An integer that says which pattern in the machine description matches
this insn, or -1 if the matching has not yet been attempted.
<P>

Such matching is never attempted and this field remains -1 on an insn
whose pattern consists of a single <CODE>use</CODE>, <CODE>clobber</CODE>,
<CODE>asm_input</CODE>, <CODE>addr_vec</CODE> or <CODE>addr_diff_vec</CODE> expression.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX563"></A>
Matching is also never attempted on insns that result from an <CODE>asm</CODE>
statement.  These contain at least one <CODE>asm_operands</CODE> expression.
The function <CODE>asm_noperands</CODE> returns a non-negative value for
such insns.
</P><P>

In the debugging output, this field is printed as a number followed by
a symbolic representation that locates the pattern in the <TT>`md'</TT>
file as some small positive or negative offset from a named pattern.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX564"></A>
<DT><CODE>LOG_LINKS (<VAR>i</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A list (chain of <CODE>insn_list</CODE> expressions) giving information about
dependencies between instructions within a basic block.  Neither a jump
nor a label may come between the related insns.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX565"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_NOTES (<VAR>i</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A list (chain of <CODE>expr_list</CODE> and <CODE>insn_list</CODE> expressions)
giving miscellaneous information about the insn.  It is often information
pertaining to the registers used in this insn.
</DL>
<P>

The <CODE>LOG_LINKS</CODE> field of an insn is a chain of <CODE>insn_list</CODE>
expressions.  Each of these has two operands: the first is an insn,
and the second is another <CODE>insn_list</CODE> expression (the next one in
the chain).  The last <CODE>insn_list</CODE> in the chain has a null pointer
as second operand.  The significant thing about the chain is which
insns appear in it (as first operands of <CODE>insn_list</CODE>
expressions).  Their order is not significant.
</P><P>

This list is originally set up by the flow analysis pass; it is a null
pointer until then.  Flow only adds links for those data dependencies
which can be used for instruction combination.  For each insn, the flow
analysis pass adds a link to insns which store into registers values
that are used for the first time in this insn.  The instruction
scheduling pass adds extra links so that every dependence will be
represented.  Links represent data dependencies, antidependencies and
output dependencies; the machine mode of the link distinguishes these
three types: antidependencies have mode <CODE>REG_DEP_ANTI</CODE>, output
dependencies have mode <CODE>REG_DEP_OUTPUT</CODE>, and data dependencies have
mode <CODE>VOIDmode</CODE>.
</P><P>

The <CODE>REG_NOTES</CODE> field of an insn is a chain similar to the
<CODE>LOG_LINKS</CODE> field but it includes <CODE>expr_list</CODE> expressions in
addition to <CODE>insn_list</CODE> expressions.  There are several kinds
of register notes, which are distinguished by the machine mode, which
in a register note is really understood as being an <CODE>enum reg_note</CODE>.
The first operand <VAR>op</VAR> of the note is data whose meaning depends on
the kind of note. 
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX566"></A>
<A NAME="IDX567"></A>
The macro <CODE>REG_NOTE_KIND (<VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE> returns the kind of
register note.  Its counterpart, the macro <CODE>PUT_REG_NOTE_KIND
(<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>newkind</VAR>)</CODE> sets the register note type of <VAR>x</VAR> to be
<VAR>newkind</VAR>.
</P><P>

Register notes are of three classes: They may say something about an
input to an insn, they may say something about an output of an insn, or
they may create a linkage between two insns.  There are also a set
of values that are only used in <CODE>LOG_LINKS</CODE>.
</P><P>

These register notes annotate inputs to an insn:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX568"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_DEAD</CODE>
<DD>The value in <VAR>op</VAR> dies in this insn; that is to say, altering the
value immediately after this insn would not affect the future behavior
of the program.  
<P>

This does not necessarily mean that the register <VAR>op</VAR> has no useful
value after this insn since it may also be an output of the insn.  In
such a case, however, a <CODE>REG_DEAD</CODE> note would be redundant and is
usually not present until after the reload pass, but no code relies on
this fact.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX569"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_INC</CODE>
<DD>The register <VAR>op</VAR> is incremented (or decremented; at this level
there is no distinction) by an embedded side effect inside this insn.
This means it appears in a <CODE>post_inc</CODE>, <CODE>pre_inc</CODE>,
<CODE>post_dec</CODE> or <CODE>pre_dec</CODE> expression.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX570"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_NONNEG</CODE>
<DD>The register <VAR>op</VAR> is known to have a nonnegative value when this
insn is reached.  This is used so that decrement and branch until zero
instructions, such as the m68k dbra, can be matched.
<P>

The <CODE>REG_NONNEG</CODE> note is added to insns only if the machine
description contains a pattern named
<SAMP>`decrement_and_branch_until_zero'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX571"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_NO_CONFLICT</CODE>
<DD>This insn does not cause a conflict between <VAR>op</VAR> and the item
being set by this insn even though it might appear that it does.
In other words, if the destination register and <VAR>op</VAR> could
otherwise be assigned the same register, this insn does not
prevent that assignment.
<P>

Insns with this note are usually part of a block that begins with a
<CODE>clobber</CODE> insn specifying a multi-word pseudo register (which will
be the output of the block), a group of insns that each set one word of
the value and have the <CODE>REG_NO_CONFLICT</CODE> note attached, and a final
insn that copies the output to itself with an attached <CODE>REG_EQUAL</CODE>
note giving the expression being computed.  This block is encapsulated
with <CODE>REG_LIBCALL</CODE> and <CODE>REG_RETVAL</CODE> notes on the first and
last insns, respectively.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX572"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_LABEL</CODE>
<DD>This insn uses <VAR>op</VAR>, a <CODE>code_label</CODE>, but is not a
<CODE>jump_insn</CODE>.  The presence of this note allows jump optimization to
be aware that <VAR>op</VAR> is, in fact, being used.
</DL>
<P>

The following notes describe attributes of outputs of an insn:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX573"></A>
<A NAME="IDX574"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_EQUIV</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>REG_EQUAL</CODE>
<DD>This note is only valid on an insn that sets only one register and
indicates that that register will be equal to <VAR>op</VAR> at run time; the
scope of this equivalence differs between the two types of notes.  The
value which the insn explicitly copies into the register may look
different from <VAR>op</VAR>, but they will be equal at run time.  If the
output of the single <CODE>set</CODE> is a <CODE>strict_low_part</CODE> expression,
the note refers to the register that is contained in <CODE>SUBREG_REG</CODE>
of the <CODE>subreg</CODE> expression.
 
For <CODE>REG_EQUIV</CODE>, the register is equivalent to <VAR>op</VAR> throughout
the entire function, and could validly be replaced in all its
occurrences by <VAR>op</VAR>.  ("Validly" here refers to the data flow of
the program; simple replacement may make some insns invalid.)  For
example, when a constant is loaded into a register that is never
assigned any other value, this kind of note is used.
<P>

When a parameter is copied into a pseudo-register at entry to a function,
a note of this kind records that the register is equivalent to the stack
slot where the parameter was passed.  Although in this case the register
may be set by other insns, it is still valid to replace the register
by the stack slot throughout the function.
</P><P>

In the case of <CODE>REG_EQUAL</CODE>, the register that is set by this insn
will be equal to <VAR>op</VAR> at run time at the end of this insn but not
necessarily elsewhere in the function.  In this case, <VAR>op</VAR>
is typically an arithmetic expression.  For example, when a sequence of
insns such as a library call is used to perform an arithmetic operation,
this kind of note is attached to the insn that produces or copies the
final value.
</P><P>

These two notes are used in different ways by the compiler passes.
<CODE>REG_EQUAL</CODE> is used by passes prior to register allocation (such as
common subexpression elimination and loop optimization) to tell them how
to think of that value.  <CODE>REG_EQUIV</CODE> notes are used by register
allocation to indicate that there is an available substitute expression
(either a constant or a <CODE>mem</CODE> expression for the location of a
parameter on the stack) that may be used in place of a register if
insufficient registers are available.
</P><P>

Except for stack homes for parameters, which are indicated by a
<CODE>REG_EQUIV</CODE> note and are not useful to the early optimization
passes and pseudo registers that are equivalent to a memory location
throughout there entire life, which is not detected until later in
the compilation, all equivalences are initially indicated by an attached
<CODE>REG_EQUAL</CODE> note.  In the early stages of register allocation, a
<CODE>REG_EQUAL</CODE> note is changed into a <CODE>REG_EQUIV</CODE> note if
<VAR>op</VAR> is a constant and the insn represents the only set of its
destination register.
</P><P>

Thus, compiler passes prior to register allocation need only check for
<CODE>REG_EQUAL</CODE> notes and passes subsequent to register allocation
need only check for <CODE>REG_EQUIV</CODE> notes.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX575"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_UNUSED</CODE>
<DD>The register <VAR>op</VAR> being set by this insn will not be used in a
subsequent insn.  This differs from a <CODE>REG_DEAD</CODE> note, which
indicates that the value in an input will not be used subsequently.
These two notes are independent; both may be present for the same
register.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX576"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_WAS_0</CODE>
<DD>The single output of this insn contained zero before this insn.
<VAR>op</VAR> is the insn that set it to zero.  You can rely on this note if
it is present and <VAR>op</VAR> has not been deleted or turned into a <CODE>note</CODE>;
its absence implies nothing.
</DL>
<P>

These notes describe linkages between insns.  They occur in pairs: one
insn has one of a pair of notes that points to a second insn, which has
the inverse note pointing back to the first insn.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX577"></A>

library call, the first insn that was generated to set up the arguments
for the library call).
<P>

Loop optimization uses this note to treat such a sequence as a single
operation for code motion purposes and flow analysis uses this note to
delete such sequences whose results are dead.
</P><P>

A <CODE>REG_EQUAL</CODE> note will also usually be attached to this insn to 
provide the expression being computed by the sequence.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX578"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_LIBCALL</CODE>
<DD>This is the inverse of <CODE>REG_RETVAL</CODE>: it is placed on the first

set and use <CODE>cc0</CODE> are adjacent.  However, when branch delay slot

<H2> 12.16 RTL Representation of Function-Call Insns </H2>
<!--docid::SEC118::-->
<P>

Insns that call subroutines have the RTL expression code <CODE>call_insn</CODE>.
These insns must satisfy special rules, and their bodies must use a special
RTL expression code, <CODE>call</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX585"></A>
A <CODE>call</CODE> expression has two operands, as follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(call (mem:<VAR>fm</VAR> <VAR>addr</VAR>) <VAR>nbytes</VAR>)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here <VAR>nbytes</VAR> is an operand that represents the number of bytes of
argument data being passed to the subroutine, <VAR>fm</VAR> is a machine mode
(which must equal as the definition of the <CODE>FUNCTION_MODE</CODE> macro in
the machine description) and <VAR>addr</VAR> represents the address of the
subroutine.
</P><P>

For a subroutine that returns no value, the <CODE>call</CODE> expression as
shown above is the entire body of the insn, except that the insn might
also contain <CODE>use</CODE> or <CODE>clobber</CODE> expressions.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX586"></A>
For a subroutine that returns a value whose mode is not <CODE>BLKmode</CODE>,
the value is returned in a hard register.  If this register's number is
<VAR>r</VAR>, then the body of the call insn looks like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(set (reg:<VAR>m</VAR> <VAR>r</VAR>)
     (call (mem:<VAR>fm</VAR> <VAR>addr</VAR>) <VAR>nbytes</VAR>))
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This RTL expression makes it clear (to the optimizer passes) that the
appropriate register receives a useful value in this insn.
</P><P>

When a subroutine returns a <CODE>BLKmode</CODE> value, it is handled by
passing to the subroutine the address of a place to store the value.
So the call insn itself does not "return" any value, and it has the
same RTL form as a call that returns nothing.
</P><P>

On some machines, the call instruction itself clobbers some register,
for example to contain the return address.  <CODE>call_insn</CODE> insns
on these machines should have a body which is a <CODE>parallel</CODE>
that contains both the <CODE>call</CODE> expression and <CODE>clobber</CODE>
expressions that indicate which registers are destroyed.  Similarly,
if the call instruction requires some register other than the stack
pointer that is not explicitly mentioned it its RTL, a <CODE>use</CODE>
subexpression should mention that register.
</P><P>

Functions that are called are assumed to modify all registers listed in
the configuration macro <CODE>CALL_USED_REGISTERS</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC155">14.5.1 Basic Characteristics of Registers</A>) and, with the exception of <CODE>const</CODE> functions and library
calls, to modify all of memory.
</P><P>

Insns containing just <CODE>use</CODE> expressions directly precede the
<CODE>call_insn</CODE> insn to indicate which registers contain inputs to the
function.  Similarly, if registers other than those in
<CODE>CALL_USED_REGISTERS</CODE> are clobbered by the called function, insns
containing a single <CODE>clobber</CODE> follow immediately after the call to
indicate which registers.

<H2> 12.17 Structure Sharing Assumptions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC119::-->
<P>

The compiler assumes that certain kinds of RTL expressions are unique;
there do not exist two distinct objects representing the same value.
In other cases, it makes an opposite assumption: that no RTL expression
object of a certain kind appears in more than one place in the
containing structure.
</P><P>

These assumptions refer to a single function; except for the RTL
objects that describe global variables and external functions,
and a few standard objects such as small integer constants,
no RTL objects are common to two functions.
</P><P>

<UL>
<A NAME="IDX587"></A>
<LI>
Each pseudo-register has only a single <CODE>reg</CODE> object to represent it,
and therefore only a single machine mode.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX588"></A>
<A NAME="IDX589"></A>
<LI>
For any symbolic label, there is only one <CODE>symbol_ref</CODE> object
referring to it.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX590"></A>
<LI>
There is only one <CODE>const_int</CODE> expression with value 0, only
one with value 1, and only one with value -1.
Some other integer values are also stored uniquely.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX591"></A>
<LI>
There is only one <CODE>pc</CODE> expression.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX592"></A>
<LI>
There is only one <CODE>cc0</CODE> expression.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX593"></A>
<LI>
There is only one <CODE>const_double</CODE> expression with value 0 for
each floating point mode.  Likewise for values 1 and 2.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX594"></A>
<A NAME="IDX595"></A>
<LI>
No <CODE>label_ref</CODE> or <CODE>scratch</CODE> appears in more than one place in
the RTL structure; in other words, it is safe to do a tree-walk of all
the insns in the function and assume that each time a <CODE>label_ref</CODE>
or <CODE>scratch</CODE> is seen it is distinct from all others that are seen.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX596"></A>
<LI>
Only one <CODE>mem</CODE> object is normally created for each static
variable or stack slot, so these objects are frequently shared in all
the places they appear.  However, separate but equal objects for these
variables are occasionally made.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX597"></A>
<LI>
When a single <CODE>asm</CODE> statement has multiple output operands, a
distinct <CODE>asm_operands</CODE> expression is made for each output operand.
However, these all share the vector which contains the sequence of input
operands.  This sharing is used later on to test whether two
<CODE>asm_operands</CODE> expressions come from the same statement, so all
optimizations must carefully preserve the sharing if they copy the
vector at all.
<P>

<LI>
No RTL object appears in more than one place in the RTL structure
except as described above.  Many passes of the compiler rely on this
by assuming that they can modify RTL objects in place without unwanted
side-effects on other insns.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX598"></A>
<LI>
During initial RTL generation, shared structure is freely introduced.
After all the RTL for a function has been generated, all shared
structure is copied by <CODE>unshare_all_rtl</CODE> in <TT>`emit-rtl.c'</TT>,
after which the above rules are guaranteed to be followed.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX599"></A>
<LI>
During the combiner pass, shared structure within an insn can exist
temporarily.  However, the shared structure is copied before the
combiner is finished with the insn.  This is done by calling
<CODE>copy_rtx_if_shared</CODE>, which is a subroutine of
<CODE>unshare_all_rtl</CODE>.

A machine description has two parts: a file of instruction patterns

The <TT>`.md'</TT> file for a target machine contains a pattern for each
instruction that the target machine supports (or at least each instruction
that is worth telling the compiler about).  It may also contain comments.

<H2> 13.1 Everything about Instruction Patterns </H2>
<!--docid::SEC121::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX600"></A>
Each instruction pattern contains an incomplete RTL expression, with pieces
to be filled in later, operand constraints that restrict how the pieces can
be filled in, and an output pattern or C code to generate the assembler
output, all wrapped up in a <CODE>define_insn</CODE> expression.
</P><P>

A <CODE>define_insn</CODE> is an RTL expression containing four or five operands:
</P><P>

<OL>
<LI>
An optional name.  The presence of a name indicate that this instruction
pattern can perform a certain standard job for the RTL-generation
pass of the compiler.  This pass knows certain names and will use
the instruction patterns with those names, if the names are defined
in the machine description.
<P>

The absence of a name is indicated by writing an empty string
where the name should go.  Nameless instruction patterns are never
used for generating RTL code, but they may permit several simpler insns
to be combined later on.
</P><P>

Names that are not thus known and used in RTL-generation have no
effect; they are equivalent to no name at all.
</P><P>

<LI>
The <EM>RTL template</EM> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC123">13.3 RTL Template for Generating and Recognizing Insns</A>) is a vector of incomplete
RTL expressions which show what the instruction should look like.  It is
incomplete because it may contain <CODE>match_operand</CODE>,
<CODE>match_operator</CODE>, and <CODE>match_dup</CODE> expressions that stand for
operands of the instruction.

This is an instruction that sets the condition codes based on the value of
a general operand.  It has no condition, so any insn whose RTL description
has the form shown may be handled according to this pattern.  The name
<SAMP>`tstsi'</SAMP> means "test a <CODE>SImode</CODE> value" and tells the RTL generation
pass that, when it is necessary to test such a value, an insn to do so
can be constructed using this pattern.

<H2> 13.3 RTL Template for Generating and Recognizing Insns </H2>
<!--docid::SEC123::-->
<P>

The RTL template is used to define which insns match the particular pattern
and how to find their operands.  For named patterns, the RTL template also
says how to construct an insn from specified operands.
</P><P>

Construction involves substituting specified operands into a copy of the
template.  Matching involves determining the values that serve as the
operands in the insn being matched.  Both of these activities are
controlled by special expression types that direct matching and
substitution of the operands.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX605"></A>
<DT><CODE>(match_operand:<VAR>m</VAR> <VAR>n</VAR> <VAR>predicate</VAR> <VAR>constraint</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>This expression is a placeholder for operand number <VAR>n</VAR> of
the insn.  When constructing an insn, operand number <VAR>n</VAR>
will be substituted at this point.  When matching an insn, whatever
appears at this position in the insn will be taken as operand
number <VAR>n</VAR>; but it must satisfy <VAR>predicate</VAR> or this instruction
pattern will not match at all.
<P>

Operand numbers must be chosen consecutively counting from zero in
each instruction pattern.  There may be only one <CODE>match_operand</CODE>
expression in the pattern for each operand number.  Usually operands
are numbered in the order of appearance in <CODE>match_operand</CODE>
expressions.
</P><P>

<VAR>predicate</VAR> is a string that is the name of a C function that accepts two
arguments, an expression and a machine mode.  During matching, the
function will be called with the putative operand as the expression and
<VAR>m</VAR> as the mode argument (if <VAR>m</VAR> is not specified,
<CODE>VOIDmode</CODE> will be used, which normally causes <VAR>predicate</VAR> to accept
any mode).  If it returns zero, this instruction pattern fails to match.
<VAR>predicate</VAR> may be an empty string; then it means no test is to be done
on the operand, so anything which occurs in this position is valid.
</P><P>

Most of the time, <VAR>predicate</VAR> will reject modes other than <VAR>m</VAR>---but
not always.  For example, the predicate <CODE>address_operand</CODE> uses
<VAR>m</VAR> as the mode of memory ref that the address should be valid for.
Many predicates accept <CODE>const_int</CODE> nodes even though their mode is
<CODE>VOIDmode</CODE>.
</P><P>

<VAR>constraint</VAR> controls reloading and the choice of the best register
class to use for a value, as explained later (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC126">13.6 Operand Constraints</A>).
</P><P>

People are often unclear on the difference between the constraint and the
predicate.  The predicate helps decide whether a given insn matches the
pattern.  The constraint plays no role in this decision; instead, it
controls various decisions in the case of an insn which does match.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX606"></A>
On CISC machines, <VAR>predicate</VAR> is most often <CODE>"general_operand"</CODE>.
This function checks that the putative operand is either a constant, a
register or a memory reference, and that it is valid for mode <VAR>m</VAR>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX607"></A>
For an operand that must be a register, <VAR>predicate</VAR> should be
<CODE>"register_operand"</CODE>.  It would be valid to use
<CODE>"general_operand"</CODE>, since the reload pass would copy any
non-register operands through registers, but this would make GNU CC do
extra work, it would prevent invariant operands (such as constant) from
being removed from loops, and it would prevent the register allocator
from doing the best possible job.  On RISC machines, it is usually most
efficient to allow <VAR>predicate</VAR> to accept only objects that the
constraints allow.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX608"></A>
For an operand that must be a constant, either use
<CODE>"immediate_operand"</CODE> for <VAR>predicate</VAR>, or make the instruction
pattern's extra condition require a constant, or both.  You cannot
expect the constraints to do this work!  If the constraints allow only
constants, but the predicate allows something else, the compiler will
crash when that case arises.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX609"></A>
<DT><CODE>(match_scratch:<VAR>m</VAR> <VAR>n</VAR> <VAR>constraint</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>This expression is also a placeholder for operand number <VAR>n</VAR>
and indicates that operand must be a <CODE>scratch</CODE> or <CODE>reg</CODE>
expression.
<P>

When matching patterns, this is completely equivalent to
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(match_operand:<VAR>m</VAR> <VAR>n</VAR> "scratch_operand" <VAR>pred</VAR>)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

but, when generating RTL, it produces a (<CODE>scratch</CODE>:<VAR>m</VAR>)
expression.
</P><P>

If the last few expressions in a <CODE>parallel</CODE> are <CODE>clobber</CODE>
expressions whose operands are either a hard register or
<CODE>match_scratch</CODE>, the combiner can add them when necessary.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC114">12.12 Side Effect Expressions</A>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX610"></A>
<DT><CODE>(match_dup <VAR>n</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>This expression is also a placeholder for operand number <VAR>n</VAR>.
It is used when the operand needs to appear more than once in the
insn.
<P>

In construction, <CODE>match_dup</CODE> behaves exactly like
<CODE>match_operand</CODE>: the operand is substituted into the insn being
constructed.  But in matching, <CODE>match_dup</CODE> behaves differently.
It assumes that operand number <VAR>n</VAR> has already been determined by
a <CODE>match_operand</CODE> appearing earlier in the recognition template,
and it matches only an identical-looking expression.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX611"></A>
<DT><CODE>(match_operator:<VAR>m</VAR> <VAR>n</VAR> <VAR>predicate</VAR> [<VAR>operands</VAR><small>...</small>])</CODE>
<DD>This pattern is a kind of placeholder for a variable RTL expression
code.
<P>

When constructing an insn, it stands for an RTL expression whose
expression code is taken from that of operand <VAR>n</VAR>, and whose
operands are constructed from the patterns <VAR>operands</VAR>.
</P><P>

When matching an expression, it matches an expression if the function
<VAR>predicate</VAR> returns nonzero on that expression <EM>and</EM> the
patterns <VAR>operands</VAR> match the operands of the expression.
</P><P>

Suppose that the function <CODE>commutative_operator</CODE> is defined as
follows, to match any expression whose operator is one of the
commutative arithmetic operators of RTL and whose mode is <VAR>mode</VAR>:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>int
commutative_operator (x, mode)
     rtx x;
     enum machine_mode mode;
{
  enum rtx_code code = GET_CODE (x);
  if (GET_MODE (x) != mode)
    return 0;
  return GET_RTX_CLASS (code) == 'c' || code == EQ || code == NE;
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Then the following pattern will match any RTL expression consisting
of a commutative operator applied to two general operands:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(match_operator:SI 3 "commutative_operator"
  [(match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "g")
   (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "g")])
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Here the vector <CODE>[<VAR>operands</VAR><small>...</small>]</CODE> contains two patterns
because the expressions to be matched all contain two operands.
</P><P>

When this pattern does match, the two operands of the commutative
operator are recorded as operands 1 and 2 of the insn.  (This is done
by the two instances of <CODE>match_operand</CODE>.)  Operand 3 of the insn
will be the entire commutative expression: use <CODE>GET_CODE
(operands[3])</CODE> to see which commutative operator was used.
</P><P>

The machine mode <VAR>m</VAR> of <CODE>match_operator</CODE> works like that of
<CODE>match_operand</CODE>: it is passed as the second argument to the
predicate function, and that function is solely responsible for
deciding whether the expression to be matched "has" that mode.
</P><P>

When constructing an insn, argument 3 of the gen-function will specify
the operation (i.e. the expression code) for the expression to be
made.  It should be an RTL expression, whose expression code is copied
into a new expression whose operands are arguments 1 and 2 of the
gen-function.  The subexpressions of argument 3 are not used;
only its expression code matters.
</P><P>

When <CODE>match_operator</CODE> is used in a pattern for matching an insn,
it usually best if the operand number of the <CODE>match_operator</CODE>
is higher than that of the actual operands of the insn.  This improves
register allocation because the register allocator often looks at
operands 1 and 2 of insns to see if it can do register tying.
</P><P>

There is no way to specify constraints in <CODE>match_operator</CODE>.  The
operand of the insn which corresponds to the <CODE>match_operator</CODE>
never has any constraints because it is never reloaded as a whole.
However, if parts of its <VAR>operands</VAR> are matched by
<CODE>match_operand</CODE> patterns, those parts may have constraints of
their own.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX612"></A>
<DT><CODE>(match_op_dup:<VAR>m</VAR> <VAR>n</VAR>[<VAR>operands</VAR><small>...</small>])</CODE>
<DD>Like <CODE>match_dup</CODE>, except that it applies to operators instead of
operands.  When constructing an insn, operand number <VAR>n</VAR> will be
substituted at this point.  But in matching, <CODE>match_op_dup</CODE> behaves
differently.  It assumes that operand number <VAR>n</VAR> has already been
determined by a <CODE>match_operator</CODE> appearing earlier in the
recognition template, and it matches only an identical-looking
expression.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX613"></A>
<DT><CODE>(match_parallel <VAR>n</VAR> <VAR>predicate</VAR> [<VAR>subpat</VAR><small>...</small>])</CODE>
<DD>This pattern is a placeholder for an insn that consists of a
<CODE>parallel</CODE> expression with a variable number of elements.  This
expression should only appear at the top level of an insn pattern.
<P>

When constructing an insn, operand number <VAR>n</VAR> will be substituted at
this point.  When matching an insn, it matches if the body of the insn
is a <CODE>parallel</CODE> expression with at least as many elements as the
vector of <VAR>subpat</VAR> expressions in the <CODE>match_parallel</CODE>, if each
<VAR>subpat</VAR> matches the corresponding element of the <CODE>parallel</CODE>,
<EM>and</EM> the function <VAR>predicate</VAR> returns nonzero on the
<CODE>parallel</CODE> that is the body of the insn.  It is the responsibility
of the predicate to validate elements of the <CODE>parallel</CODE> beyond
those listed in the <CODE>match_parallel</CODE>.</P><P>

A typical use of <CODE>match_parallel</CODE> is to match load and store
multiple expressions, which can contains a variable number of elements
in a <CODE>parallel</CODE>.  For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_insn ""
  [(match_parallel 0 "load_multiple_operation"
                   [(set (match_operand:SI 1 "gpc_reg_operand" "=r")
                         (match_operand:SI 2 "memory_operand" "m"))
                    (use (reg:SI 179))
                    (clobber (reg:SI 179))])]
  ""
  "loadm 0,0,%1,%2")
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This example comes from <TT>`a29k.md'</TT>.  The function
<CODE>load_multiple_operations</CODE> is defined in <TT>`a29k.c'</TT> and checks
that subsequent elements in the <CODE>parallel</CODE> are the same as the
<CODE>set</CODE> in the pattern, except that they are referencing subsequent
registers and memory locations.
</P><P>

An insn that matches this pattern might look like:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(parallel [(set (reg:SI 20) (mem:SI (reg:SI 100)))
           (use (reg:SI 179))
           (clobber (reg:SI 179))
           (set (reg:SI 21) (mem:SI (plus:SI (reg:SI 100) (const_int 4))))
           (set (reg:SI 22) (mem:SI (plus:SI (reg:SI 100) (const_int 8))))])
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX614"></A>
<DT><CODE>(match_par_dup <VAR>n</VAR> [<VAR>subpat</VAR><small>...</small>])</CODE>
<DD>Like <CODE>match_op_dup</CODE>, but for <CODE>match_parallel</CODE> instead of
<CODE>match_operator</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX615"></A>
<DT><CODE>(address (match_operand:<VAR>m</VAR> <VAR>n</VAR> "address_operand" ""))</CODE>
<DD>This complex of expressions is a placeholder for an operand number
<VAR>n</VAR> in a "load address" instruction: an operand which specifies
a memory location in the usual way, but for which the actual operand
value used is the address of the location, not the contents of the
location.
<P>

<CODE>address</CODE> expressions never appear in RTL code, only in machine
descriptions.  And they are used only in machine descriptions that do
not use the operand constraint feature.  When operand constraints are
in use, the letter <SAMP>`p'</SAMP> in the constraint serves this purpose.
</P><P>

<VAR>m</VAR> is the machine mode of the <EM>memory location being
addressed</EM>, not the machine mode of the address itself.  That mode is
always the same on a given target machine (it is <CODE>Pmode</CODE>, which
normally is <CODE>SImode</CODE>), so there is no point in mentioning it;
thus, no machine mode is written in the <CODE>address</CODE> expression.  If
some day support is added for machines in which addresses of different
kinds of objects appear differently or are used differently (such as
the PDP-10), different formats would perhaps need different machine
modes and these modes might be written in the <CODE>address</CODE>
expression.

<H2> 13.4 Output Templates and Operand Substitution </H2>
<!--docid::SEC124::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX616"></A>
<A NAME="IDX617"></A>
The <EM>output template</EM> is a string which specifies how to output the
assembler code for an instruction pattern.  Most of the template is a
fixed string which is output literally.  The character <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> is used
to specify where to substitute an operand; it can also be used to
identify places where different variants of the assembler require
different syntax.
</P><P>

In the simplest case, a <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> followed by a digit <VAR>n</VAR> says to output
operand <VAR>n</VAR> at that point in the string.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> followed by a letter and a digit says to output an operand in an
alternate fashion.  Four letters have standard, built-in meanings described
below.  The machine description macro <CODE>PRINT_OPERAND</CODE> can define
additional letters with nonstandard meanings.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`%c<VAR>digit</VAR>'</SAMP> can be used to substitute an operand that is a
constant value without the syntax that normally indicates an immediate
operand.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`%n<VAR>digit</VAR>'</SAMP> is like <SAMP>`%c<VAR>digit</VAR>'</SAMP> except that the value of
the constant is negated before printing.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`%a<VAR>digit</VAR>'</SAMP> can be used to substitute an operand as if it were a
memory reference, with the actual operand treated as the address.  This may
be useful when outputting a "load address" instruction, because often the
assembler syntax for such an instruction requires you to write the operand
as if it were a memory reference.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`%l<VAR>digit</VAR>'</SAMP> is used to substitute a <CODE>label_ref</CODE> into a jump
instruction.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`%='</SAMP> outputs a number which is unique to each instruction in the
entire compilation.  This is useful for making local labels to be
referred to more than once in a single template that generates multiple
assembler instructions.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> followed by a punctuation character specifies a substitution that
does not use an operand.  Only one case is standard: <SAMP>`%%'</SAMP> outputs a
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> into the assembler code.  Other nonstandard cases can be
defined in the <CODE>PRINT_OPERAND</CODE> macro.  You must also define
which punctuation characters are valid with the
<CODE>PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P</CODE> macro.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX618"></A>
<A NAME="IDX619"></A>
The template may generate multiple assembler instructions.  Write the text
for the instructions, with <SAMP>`\;'</SAMP> between them.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX620"></A>
When the RTL contains two operands which are required by constraint to match
each other, the output template must refer only to the lower-numbered operand.
Matching operands are not always identical, and the rest of the compiler
arranges to put the proper RTL expression for printing into the lower-numbered
operand.
</P><P>

One use of nonstandard letters or punctuation following <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> is to
distinguish between different assembler languages for the same machine; for
example, Motorola syntax versus MIT syntax for the 68000.  Motorola syntax
requires periods in most opcode names, while MIT syntax does not.  For
example, the opcode <SAMP>`movel'</SAMP> in MIT syntax is <SAMP>`move.l'</SAMP> in Motorola
syntax.  The same file of patterns is used for both kinds of output syntax,
but the character sequence <SAMP>`%.'</SAMP> is used in each place where Motorola
syntax wants a period.  The <CODE>PRINT_OPERAND</CODE> macro for Motorola syntax
defines the sequence to output a period; the macro for MIT syntax defines
it to do nothing.

<H2> 13.5 C Statements for Generating Assembler Output </H2>
<!--docid::SEC125::-->
<P>

Often a single fixed template string cannot produce correct and efficient
assembler code for all the cases that are recognized by a single
instruction pattern.  For example, the opcodes may depend on the kinds of
operands; or some unfortunate combinations of operands may require extra
machine instructions.
</P><P>

If the output control string starts with a <SAMP>`@'</SAMP>, then it is actually
a series of templates, each on a separate line.  (Blank lines and
leading spaces and tabs are ignored.)  The templates correspond to the
pattern's constraint alternatives (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC128">13.6.2 Multiple Alternative Constraints</A>).  For example,
if a target machine has a two-address add instruction <SAMP>`addr'</SAMP> to add
into a register and another <SAMP>`addm'</SAMP> to add a register to memory, you
might write this pattern:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_insn "addsi3"
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,m")
        (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0,0")
                 (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "g,r")))]
  ""
  "@
   addr %2,%0
   addm %2,%0")
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX621"></A>
<A NAME="IDX622"></A>
If the output control string starts with a <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>, then it is not an
output template but rather a piece of C program that should compute a
template.  It should execute a <CODE>return</CODE> statement to return the
template-string you want.  Most such templates use C string literals, which
require doublequote characters to delimit them.  To include these
doublequote characters in the string, prefix each one with <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

The operands may be found in the array <CODE>operands</CODE>, whose C data type
is <CODE>rtx []</CODE>.
</P><P>

It is very common to select different ways of generating assembler code
based on whether an immediate operand is within a certain range.  Be
careful when doing this, because the result of <CODE>INTVAL</CODE> is an
integer on the host machine.  If the host machine has more bits in an
<CODE>int</CODE> than the target machine has in the mode in which the constant
will be used, then some of the bits you get from <CODE>INTVAL</CODE> will be
superfluous.  For proper results, you must carefully disregard the
values of those bits.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX623"></A>
It is possible to output an assembler instruction and then go on to output
or compute more of them, using the subroutine <CODE>output_asm_insn</CODE>.  This
receives two arguments: a template-string and a vector of operands.  The
vector may be <CODE>operands</CODE>, or it may be another array of <CODE>rtx</CODE>
that you declare locally and initialize yourself.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX624"></A>
When an insn pattern has multiple alternatives in its constraints, often
the appearance of the assembler code is determined mostly by which alternative
was matched.  When this is so, the C code can test the variable
<CODE>which_alternative</CODE>, which is the ordinal number of the alternative
that was actually satisfied (0 for the first, 1 for the second alternative,
etc.).
</P><P>

For example, suppose there are two opcodes for storing zero, <SAMP>`clrreg'</SAMP>
for registers and <SAMP>`clrmem'</SAMP> for memory locations.  Here is how
a pattern could use <CODE>which_alternative</CODE> to choose between them:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_insn ""
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,m")
        (const_int 0))]
  ""
  "*
  return (which_alternative == 0
          ? \"clrreg %0\" : \"clrmem %0\");
  ")
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The example above, where the assembler code to generate was
<EM>solely</EM> determined by the alternative, could also have been specified
as follows, having the output control string start with a <SAMP>`@'</SAMP>:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_insn ""
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,m")
        (const_int 0))]
  ""
  "@
   clrreg %0
   clrmem %0")

<H2> 13.6 Operand Constraints </H2>
<!--docid::SEC126::-->
<P>

Each <CODE>match_operand</CODE> in an instruction pattern can specify a
constraint for the type of operands allowed.  Constraints can say whether
an operand may be in a register, and which kinds of register; whether the
operand can be a memory reference, and which kinds of address; whether the
operand may be an immediate constant, and which possible values it may
have.  Constraints can also require two operands to match.

<H3> 13.6.1 Simple Constraints </H3>
<!--docid::SEC127::-->
<P>

The simplest kind of constraint is a string full of letters, each of
which describes one kind of operand that is permitted.  Here are
the letters that are allowed:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX625"></A>
<A NAME="IDX626"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`m'</SAMP>
<DD>A memory operand is allowed, with any kind of address that the machine
supports in general.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX627"></A>
<A NAME="IDX628"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`o'</SAMP>
<DD>A memory operand is allowed, but only if the address is
<EM>offsettable</EM>.  This means that adding a small integer (actually,
the width in bytes of the operand, as determined by its machine mode)
may be added to the address and the result is also a valid memory
address.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX629"></A>
For example, an address which is constant is offsettable; so is an
address that is the sum of a register and a constant (as long as a
slightly larger constant is also within the range of address-offsets
supported by the machine); but an autoincrement or autodecrement
address is not offsettable.  More complicated indirect/indexed
addresses may or may not be offsettable depending on the other
addressing modes that the machine supports.
</P><P>

Note that in an output operand which can be matched by another
operand, the constraint letter <SAMP>`o'</SAMP> is valid only when accompanied
by both <SAMP>`&#60;'</SAMP> (if the target machine has predecrement addressing)
and <SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP> (if the target machine has preincrement addressing).
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX630"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`V'</SAMP>
<DD>A memory operand that is not offsettable.  In other words, anything that
would fit the <SAMP>`m'</SAMP> constraint but not the <SAMP>`o'</SAMP> constraint.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX631"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`&#60;'</SAMP>
<DD>A memory operand with autodecrement addressing (either predecrement or
postdecrement) is allowed.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX632"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP>
<DD>A memory operand with autoincrement addressing (either preincrement or
postincrement) is allowed.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX633"></A>
<A NAME="IDX634"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`r'</SAMP>
<DD>A register operand is allowed provided that it is in a general
register.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX635"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`d'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`a'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`f'</SAMP>, <small>...</small>
<DD>Other letters can be defined in machine-dependent fashion to stand for
particular classes of registers.  <SAMP>`d'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`a'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`f'</SAMP> are
defined on the 68000/68020 to stand for data, address and floating
point registers.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX636"></A>
<A NAME="IDX637"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`i'</SAMP>
<DD>An immediate integer operand (one with constant value) is allowed.
This includes symbolic constants whose values will be known only at
assembly time.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX638"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`n'</SAMP>
<DD>An immediate integer operand with a known numeric value is allowed.
Many systems cannot support assembly-time constants for operands less
than a word wide.  Constraints for these operands should use <SAMP>`n'</SAMP>
rather than <SAMP>`i'</SAMP>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX639"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`I'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`J'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`K'</SAMP>, <small>...</small> <SAMP>`P'</SAMP>
<DD>Other letters in the range <SAMP>`I'</SAMP> through <SAMP>`P'</SAMP> may be defined in
a machine-dependent fashion to permit immediate integer operands with
explicit integer values in specified ranges.  For example, on the
68000, <SAMP>`I'</SAMP> is defined to stand for the range of values 1 to 8.
This is the range permitted as a shift count in the shift
instructions.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX640"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`E'</SAMP>
<DD>An immediate floating operand (expression code <CODE>const_double</CODE>) is
allowed, but only if the target floating point format is the same as
that of the host machine (on which the compiler is running).
<P>

<A NAME="IDX641"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`F'</SAMP>
<DD>An immediate floating operand (expression code <CODE>const_double</CODE>) is
allowed.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX642"></A>
<A NAME="IDX643"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`G'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`H'</SAMP>
<DD><SAMP>`G'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`H'</SAMP> may be defined in a machine-dependent fashion to
permit immediate floating operands in particular ranges of values.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX644"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`s'</SAMP>
<DD>An immediate integer operand whose value is not an explicit integer is
allowed.
<P>

This might appear strange; if an insn allows a constant operand with a
value not known at compile time, it certainly must allow any known
value.  So why use <SAMP>`s'</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`i'</SAMP>?  Sometimes it allows
better code to be generated.
</P><P>

For example, on the 68000 in a fullword instruction it is possible to
use an immediate operand; but if the immediate value is between -128
and 127, better code results from loading the value into a register and
using the register.  This is because the load into the register can be
done with a <SAMP>`moveq'</SAMP> instruction.  We arrange for this to happen
by defining the letter <SAMP>`K'</SAMP> to mean "any integer outside the
range -128 to 127", and then specifying <SAMP>`Ks'</SAMP> in the operand
constraints.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX645"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`g'</SAMP>
<DD>Any register, memory or immediate integer operand is allowed, except for
registers that are not general registers.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX646"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`X'</SAMP>
<DD>Any operand whatsoever is allowed, even if it does not satisfy
<CODE>general_operand</CODE>.  This is normally used in the constraint of
a <CODE>match_scratch</CODE> when certain alternatives will not actually 
require a scratch register.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX647"></A>
<A NAME="IDX648"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`0'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`1'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`2'</SAMP>, <small>...</small> <SAMP>`9'</SAMP>
<DD>An operand that matches the specified operand number is allowed.  If a
digit is used together with letters within the same alternative, the
digit should come last.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX649"></A>
<A NAME="IDX650"></A>
This is called a <EM>matching constraint</EM> and what it really means is
that the assembler has only a single operand that fills two roles
considered separate in the RTL insn.  For example, an add insn has two
input operands and one output operand in the RTL, but on most CISC
machines an add instruction really has only two operands, one of them an
input-output operand:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>addl #35,r12
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Matching constraints are used in these circumstances.
More precisely, the two operands that match must include one input-only
operand and one output-only operand.  Moreover, the digit must be a
smaller number than the number of the operand that uses it in the
constraint.
</P><P>

For operands to match in a particular case usually means that they
are identical-looking RTL expressions.  But in a few special cases
specific kinds of dissimilarity are allowed.  For example, <CODE>*x</CODE>
as an input operand will match <CODE>*x++</CODE> as an output operand.
For proper results in such cases, the output template should always
use the output-operand's number when printing the operand.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX651"></A>
<A NAME="IDX652"></A>
<A NAME="IDX653"></A>
<A NAME="IDX654"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`p'</SAMP>
<DD>An operand that is a valid memory address is allowed.  This is
for "load address" and "push address" instructions.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX655"></A>
<SAMP>`p'</SAMP> in the constraint must be accompanied by <CODE>address_operand</CODE>
as the predicate in the <CODE>match_operand</CODE>.  This predicate interprets
the mode specified in the <CODE>match_operand</CODE> as the mode of the memory
reference for which the address would be valid.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX656"></A>
<A NAME="IDX657"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`Q'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`R'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`S'</SAMP>, <small>...</small> <SAMP>`U'</SAMP>
<DD>Letters in the range <SAMP>`Q'</SAMP> through <SAMP>`U'</SAMP> may be defined in a
machine-dependent fashion to stand for arbitrary operand types.
The machine description macro <CODE>EXTRA_CONSTRAINT</CODE> is passed the
operand as its first argument and the constraint letter as its
second operand.
<P>

A typical use for this would be to distinguish certain types of
memory references that affect other insn operands.
</P><P>

Do not define these constraint letters to accept register references
(<CODE>reg</CODE>); the reload pass does not expect this and would not handle
it properly.
</DL>
<P>

In order to have valid assembler code, each operand must satisfy
its constraint.  But a failure to do so does not prevent the pattern
from applying to an insn.  Instead, it directs the compiler to modify
the code so that the constraint will be satisfied.  Usually this is
done by copying an operand into a register.
</P><P>

Contrast, therefore, the two instruction patterns that follow:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_insn ""
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r")
        (plus:SI (match_dup 0)
                 (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "r")))]
  ""
  "<small>...</small>")
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

which has two operands, one of which must appear in two places, and
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_insn ""
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r")
        (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0")
                 (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "r")))]
  ""
  "<small>...</small>")
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

which has three operands, two of which are required by a constraint to be
identical.  If we are considering an insn of the form
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(insn <VAR>n</VAR> <VAR>prev</VAR> <VAR>next</VAR>
  (set (reg:SI 3)
       (plus:SI (reg:SI 6) (reg:SI 109)))
  <small>...</small>)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

the first pattern would not apply at all, because this insn does not
contain two identical subexpressions in the right place.  The pattern would
say, "That does not look like an add instruction; try other patterns."
The second pattern would say, "Yes, that's an add instruction, but there
is something wrong with it."  It would direct the reload pass of the
compiler to generate additional insns to make the constraint true.  The
results might look like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(insn <VAR>n2</VAR> <VAR>prev</VAR> <VAR>n</VAR>
  (set (reg:SI 3) (reg:SI 6))
  <small>...</small>)

(insn <VAR>n</VAR> <VAR>n2</VAR> <VAR>next</VAR>
  (set (reg:SI 3)
       (plus:SI (reg:SI 3) (reg:SI 109)))
  <small>...</small>)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

It is up to you to make sure that each operand, in each pattern, has
constraints that can handle any RTL expression that could be present for
that operand.  (When multiple alternatives are in use, each pattern must,
for each possible combination of operand expressions, have at least one
alternative which can handle that combination of operands.)  The
constraints don't need to <EM>allow</EM> any possible operand--when this is
the case, they do not constrain--but they must at least point the way to
reloading any possible operand so that it will fit.
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
If the constraint accepts whatever operands the predicate permits,
there is no problem: reloading is never necessary for this operand.
<P>

For example, an operand whose constraints permit everything except
registers is safe provided its predicate rejects registers.
</P><P>

An operand whose predicate accepts only constant values is safe
provided its constraints include the letter <SAMP>`i'</SAMP>.  If any possible
constant value is accepted, then nothing less than <SAMP>`i'</SAMP> will do;
if the predicate is more selective, then the constraints may also be
more selective.
</P><P>

<LI>
Any operand expression can be reloaded by copying it into a register.
So if an operand's constraints allow some kind of register, it is
certain to be safe.  It need not permit all classes of registers; the
compiler knows how to copy a register into another register of the
proper class in order to make an instruction valid.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX658"></A>
<A NAME="IDX659"></A>
<LI>
A nonoffsettable memory reference can be reloaded by copying the
address into a register.  So if the constraint uses the letter
<SAMP>`o'</SAMP>, all memory references are taken care of.
<P>

<LI>
A constant operand can be reloaded by allocating space in memory to
hold it as preinitialized data.  Then the memory reference can be used
in place of the constant.  So if the constraint uses the letters
<SAMP>`o'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`m'</SAMP>, constant operands are not a problem.
<P>

<LI>
If the constraint permits a constant and a pseudo register used in an insn
was not allocated to a hard register and is equivalent to a constant,
the register will be replaced with the constant.  If the predicate does
not permit a constant and the insn is re-recognized for some reason, the
compiler will crash.  Thus the predicate must always recognize any
objects allowed by the constraint.
</UL>
<P>

If the operand's predicate can recognize registers, but the constraint does
not permit them, it can make the compiler crash.  When this operand happens
to be a register, the reload pass will be stymied, because it does not know
how to copy a register temporarily into memory.

<H3> 13.6.2 Multiple Alternative Constraints </H3>
<!--docid::SEC128::-->
<P>

Sometimes a single instruction has multiple alternative sets of possible
operands.  For example, on the 68000, a logical-or instruction can combine
register or an immediate value into memory, or it can combine any kind of
operand into a register; but it cannot combine one memory location into
another.
</P><P>

These constraints are represented as multiple alternatives.  An alternative
can be described by a series of letters for each operand.  The overall
constraint for an operand is made from the letters for this operand
from the first alternative, a comma, the letters for this operand from
the second alternative, a comma, and so on until the last alternative.
Here is how it is done for fullword logical-or on the 68000:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_insn "iorsi3"
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=m,d")
        (ior:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "%0,0")
                (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "dKs,dmKs")))]
  <small>...</small>)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The first alternative has <SAMP>`m'</SAMP> (memory) for operand 0, <SAMP>`0'</SAMP> for
operand 1 (meaning it must match operand 0), and <SAMP>`dKs'</SAMP> for operand
2.  The second alternative has <SAMP>`d'</SAMP> (data register) for operand 0,
<SAMP>`0'</SAMP> for operand 1, and <SAMP>`dmKs'</SAMP> for operand 2.  The <SAMP>`='</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> in the constraints apply to all the alternatives; their
meaning is explained in the next section (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC129">13.6.3 Register Class Preferences</A>).
</P><P>

If all the operands fit any one alternative, the instruction is valid.
Otherwise, for each alternative, the compiler counts how many instructions
must be added to copy the operands so that that alternative applies.
The alternative requiring the least copying is chosen.  If two alternatives
need the same amount of copying, the one that comes first is chosen.
These choices can be altered with the <SAMP>`?'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`!'</SAMP> characters:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX660"></A>
<A NAME="IDX661"></A>
<DT><CODE>?</CODE>
<DD>Disparage slightly the alternative that the <SAMP>`?'</SAMP> appears in,
as a choice when no alternative applies exactly.  The compiler regards
this alternative as one unit more costly for each <SAMP>`?'</SAMP> that appears
in it.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX662"></A>
<A NAME="IDX663"></A>
<DT><CODE>!</CODE>
<DD>Disparage severely the alternative that the <SAMP>`!'</SAMP> appears in.
This alternative can still be used if it fits without reloading,
but if reloading is needed, some other alternative will be used.
</DL>
<P>

When an insn pattern has multiple alternatives in its constraints, often
the appearance of the assembler code is determined mostly by which
alternative was matched.  When this is so, the C code for writing the
assembler code can use the variable <CODE>which_alternative</CODE>, which is
the ordinal number of the alternative that was actually satisfied (0 for
the first, 1 for the second alternative, etc.).  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC125">13.5 C Statements for Generating Assembler Output</A>.

The operand constraints have another function: they enable the compiler
to decide which kind of hardware register a pseudo register is best
allocated to.  The compiler examines the constraints that apply to the
insns that use the pseudo register, looking for the machine-dependent
letters such as <SAMP>`d'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`a'</SAMP> that specify classes of registers.
The pseudo register is put in whichever class gets the most "votes".
The constraint letters <SAMP>`g'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`r'</SAMP> also vote: they vote in
favor of a general register.  The machine description says which registers
are considered general.
</P><P>

Of course, on some machines all registers are equivalent, and no register
classes are defined.  Then none of this complexity is relevant.

<!--docid::SEC130::-->
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX665"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`='</SAMP>
<DD>Means that this operand is write-only for this instruction: the previous
value is discarded and replaced by output data.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX666"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`+'</SAMP>
<DD>Means that this operand is both read and written by the instruction.
<P>

When the compiler fixes up the operands to satisfy the constraints,
it needs to know which operands are inputs to the instruction and
which are outputs from it.  <SAMP>`='</SAMP> identifies an output; <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>
identifies an operand that is both input and output; all other operands
are assumed to be input only.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX667"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP>
<DD>Means (in a particular alternative) that this operand is written
before the instruction is finished using the input operands.
Therefore, this operand may not lie in a register that is used as an
input operand or as part of any memory address.
<P>

<SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> applies only to the alternative in which it is written.  In
constraints with multiple alternatives, sometimes one alternative
requires <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> while others do not.  See, for example, the
<SAMP>`movdf'</SAMP> insn of the 68000.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> does not obviate the need to write <SAMP>`='</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX668"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`%'</SAMP>
<DD>Declares the instruction to be commutative for this operand and the
following operand.  This means that the compiler may interchange the
two operands if that is the cheapest way to make all operands fit the
constraints.  This is often used in patterns for addition instructions
that really have only two operands: the result must go in one of the
arguments.  Here for example, is how the 68000 halfword-add
instruction is defined:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_insn "addhi3"
  [(set (match_operand:HI 0 "general_operand" "=m,r")
     (plus:HI (match_operand:HI 1 "general_operand" "%0,0")
              (match_operand:HI 2 "general_operand" "di,g")))]
  <small>...</small>)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX669"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`#'</SAMP>
<DD>Says that all following characters, up to the next comma, are to be
ignored as a constraint.  They are significant only for choosing
register preferences.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX670"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`*'</SAMP>
<DD>Says that the following character should be ignored when choosing
register preferences.  <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> has no effect on the meaning of the
constraint as a constraint, and no effect on reloading.
<P>

Here is an example: the 68000 has an instruction to sign-extend a
halfword in a data register, and can also sign-extend a value by
copying it into an address register.  While either kind of register is
acceptable, the constraints on an address-register destination are
less strict, so it is best if register allocation makes an address
register its goal.  Therefore, <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> is used so that the <SAMP>`d'</SAMP>
constraint letter (for data register) is ignored when computing
register preferences.

<H3> 13.6.5 Not Using Constraints </H3>
<!--docid::SEC131::-->
<P>

Some machines are so clean that operand constraints are not required.  For
example, on the Vax, an operand valid in one context is valid in any other
context.  On such a machine, every operand constraint would be <SAMP>`g'</SAMP>,
excepting only operands of "load address" instructions which are
written as if they referred to a memory location's contents but actual
refer to its address.  They would have constraint <SAMP>`p'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX671"></A>
For such machines, instead of writing <SAMP>`g'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`p'</SAMP> for all
the constraints, you can choose to write a description with empty constraints.
Then you write <SAMP>`""'</SAMP> for the constraint in every <CODE>match_operand</CODE>.
Address operands are identified by writing an <CODE>address</CODE> expression
around the <CODE>match_operand</CODE>, not by their constraints.
</P><P>

When the machine description has just empty constraints, certain parts
of compilation are skipped, making the compiler faster.  However,
few machines actually do not need constraints; all machine descriptions
now in existence use constraints.

<H2> 13.7 Standard Names for Patterns Used in Generation </H2>
<!--docid::SEC132::-->
<P>

Here is a table of the instruction names that are meaningful in the RTL
generation pass of the compiler.  Giving one of these names to an
instruction pattern tells the RTL generation pass that it can use the
pattern in to accomplish a certain task.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX672"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`mov<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>Here <VAR>m</VAR> stands for a two-letter machine mode name, in lower case.
This instruction pattern moves data with that machine mode from operand
1 to operand 0.  For example, <SAMP>`movsi'</SAMP> moves full-word data.
<P>

If operand 0 is a <CODE>subreg</CODE> with mode <VAR>m</VAR> of a register whose
own mode is wider than <VAR>m</VAR>, the effect of this instruction is
to store the specified value in the part of the register that corresponds
to mode <VAR>m</VAR>.  The effect on the rest of the register is undefined.
</P><P>

This class of patterns is special in several ways.  First of all, each
of these names <EM>must</EM> be defined, because there is no other way
to copy a datum from one place to another.
</P><P>

Second, these patterns are not used solely in the RTL generation pass.
Even the reload pass can generate move insns to copy values from stack
slots into temporary registers.  When it does so, one of the operands is
a hard register and the other is an operand that can need to be reloaded
into a register.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX673"></A>
Therefore, when given such a pair of operands, the pattern must generate
RTL which needs no reloading and needs no temporary registers--no
registers other than the operands.  For example, if you support the
pattern with a <CODE>define_expand</CODE>, then in such a case the
<CODE>define_expand</CODE> mustn't call <CODE>force_reg</CODE> or any other such
function which might generate new pseudo registers.
</P><P>

This requirement exists even for subword modes on a RISC machine where
fetching those modes from memory normally requires several insns and
some temporary registers.  Look in <TT>`spur.md'</TT> to see how the
requirement can be satisfied.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX674"></A>
During reload a memory reference with an invalid address may be passed
as an operand.  Such an address will be replaced with a valid address
later in the reload pass.  In this case, nothing may be done with the
address except to use it as it stands.  If it is copied, it will not be
replaced with a valid address.  No attempt should be made to make such
an address into a valid address and no routine (such as
<CODE>change_address</CODE>) that will do so may be called.  Note that
<CODE>general_operand</CODE> will fail when applied to such an address.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX675"></A>
The global variable <CODE>reload_in_progress</CODE> (which must be explicitly
declared if required) can be used to determine whether such special
handling is required.
</P><P>

The variety of operands that have reloads depends on the rest of the
machine description, but typically on a RISC machine these can only be
pseudo registers that did not get hard registers, while on other
machines explicit memory references will get optional reloads.
</P><P>

If a scratch register is required to move an object to or from memory,
it can be allocated using <CODE>gen_reg_rtx</CODE> prior to reload.  But this
is impossible during and after reload.  If there are cases needing
scratch registers after reload, you must define
<CODE>SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS</CODE> and/or
<CODE>SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS</CODE> to detect them, and provide
patterns <SAMP>`reload_in<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`reload_out<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP> to handle
them.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC161">14.6 Register Classes</A>.
</P><P>

The constraints on a <SAMP>`move<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP> must permit moving any hard
register to any other hard register provided that
<CODE>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</CODE> permits mode <VAR>m</VAR> in both registers and
<CODE>REGISTER_MOVE_COST</CODE> applied to their classes returns a value of 2.
</P><P>

It is obligatory to support floating point <SAMP>`move<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP>
instructions into and out of any registers that can hold fixed point
values, because unions and structures (which have modes <CODE>SImode</CODE> or
<CODE>DImode</CODE>) can be in those registers and they may have floating
point members.
</P><P>

There may also be a need to support fixed point <SAMP>`move<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP>
instructions in and out of floating point registers.  Unfortunately, I
have forgotten why this was so, and I don't know whether it is still
true.  If <CODE>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</CODE> rejects fixed point values in
floating point registers, then the constraints of the fixed point
<SAMP>`move<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP> instructions must be designed to avoid ever trying to
reload into a floating point register.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX676"></A>

<DT><SAMP>`reload_in<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP>

move between operand 0 and operand 1.  Operand 2 describes the scratch

with mode <VAR>m</VAR> of a register whose natural mode is wider,
the <SAMP>`movstrict<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP> instruction is guaranteed not to alter
any of the register except the part which belongs to mode <VAR>m</VAR>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX679"></A>
<DT><CODE>load_multiple</CODE>
<DD>Load several consecutive memory locations into consecutive registers.
Operand 0 is the first of the consecutive registers, operand 1
is the first memory location, and operand 2 is a constant: the
number of consecutive registers.
<P>

Define this only if the target machine really has such an instruction;
do not define this if the most efficient way of loading consecutive
registers from memory is to do them one at a time.
</P><P>

On some machines, there are restrictions as to which consecutive
registers can be stored into memory, such as particular starting or
ending register numbers or only a range of valid counts.  For those
machines, use a <CODE>define_expand</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC138">13.13 Defining RTL Sequences for Code Generation</A>)
and make the pattern fail if the restrictions are not met.
</P><P>

Write the generated insn as a <CODE>parallel</CODE> with elements being a
<CODE>set</CODE> of one register from the appropriate memory location (you may
also need <CODE>use</CODE> or <CODE>clobber</CODE> elements).  Use a
<CODE>match_parallel</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC123">13.3 RTL Template for Generating and Recognizing Insns</A>) to recognize the insn.  See
<TT>`a29k.md'</TT> and <TT>`rs6000.md'</TT> for examples of the use of this insn
pattern.

<DT><SAMP>`s<VAR>cond</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>Store zero or nonzero in the operand according to the condition codes.
Value stored is nonzero iff the condition <VAR>cond</VAR> is true.
<VAR>cond</VAR> is the name of a comparison operation expression code, such
as <CODE>eq</CODE>, <CODE>lt</CODE> or <CODE>leu</CODE>.
<P>

You specify the mode that the operand must have when you write the
<CODE>match_operand</CODE> expression.  The compiler automatically sees
which mode you have used and supplies an operand of that mode.
</P><P>

The value stored for a true condition must have 1 as its low bit, or
else must be negative.  Otherwise the instruction is not suitable and
you should omit it from the machine description.  You describe to the
compiler exactly which value is stored by defining the macro
<CODE>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC198">14.19 Miscellaneous Parameters</A>).  If a description cannot be
found that can be used for all the <SAMP>`s<VAR>cond</VAR>'</SAMP> patterns, you
should omit those operations from the machine description.
</P><P>

These operations may fail, but should do so only in relatively
uncommon cases; if they would fail for common cases involving
integer comparisons, it is best to omit these patterns.
</P><P>

If these operations are omitted, the compiler will usually generate code
that copies the constant one to the target and branches around an
assignment of zero to the target.  If this code is more efficient than
the potential instructions used for the <SAMP>`s<VAR>cond</VAR>'</SAMP> pattern
followed by those required to convert the result into a 1 or a zero in
<CODE>SImode</CODE>, you should omit the <SAMP>`s<VAR>cond</VAR>'</SAMP> operations from
the machine description.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX732"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`b<VAR>cond</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>Conditional branch instruction.  Operand 0 is a <CODE>label_ref</CODE> that
refers to the label to jump to.  Jump if the condition codes meet
condition <VAR>cond</VAR>.
<P>

Some machines do not follow the model assumed here where a comparison
instruction is followed by a conditional branch instruction.  In that
case, the <SAMP>`cmp<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP> (and <SAMP>`tst<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP>) patterns should
simply store the operands away and generate all the required insns in a
<CODE>define_expand</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC138">13.13 Defining RTL Sequences for Code Generation</A>) for the conditional
branch operations.  All calls to expand <SAMP>`b<VAR>cond</VAR>'</SAMP> patterns are
immediately preceded by calls to expand either a <SAMP>`cmp<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP>
pattern or a <SAMP>`tst<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP> pattern.
</P><P>

Machines that use a pseudo register for the condition code value, or
where the mode used for the comparison depends on the condition being
tested, should also use the above mechanism.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC135">13.10 Defining Jump Instruction Patterns</A>
</P><P>

The above discussion also applies to <SAMP>`s<VAR>cond</VAR>'</SAMP> patterns.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX733"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`call'</SAMP>
<DD>Subroutine call instruction returning no value.  Operand 0 is the
function to call; operand 1 is the number of bytes of arguments pushed
(in mode <CODE>SImode</CODE>, except it is normally a <CODE>const_int</CODE>);
operand 2 is the number of registers used as operands.
<P>

On most machines, operand 2 is not actually stored into the RTL
pattern.  It is supplied for the sake of some RISC machines which need
to put this information into the assembler code; they can put it in
the RTL instead of operand 1.
</P><P>

Operand 0 should be a <CODE>mem</CODE> RTX whose address is the address of the
function.  Note, however, that this address can be a <CODE>symbol_ref</CODE>
expression even if it would not be a legitimate memory address on the
target machine.  If it is also not a valid argument for a call
instruction, the pattern for this operation should be a
<CODE>define_expand</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC138">13.13 Defining RTL Sequences for Code Generation</A>) that places the
address into a register and uses that register in the call instruction.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX734"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`call_value'</SAMP>
<DD>Subroutine call instruction returning a value.  Operand 0 is the hard
register in which the value is returned.  There are three more
operands, the same as the three operands of the <SAMP>`call'</SAMP>
instruction (but with numbers increased by one).
<P>

Subroutines that return <CODE>BLKmode</CODE> objects use the <SAMP>`call'</SAMP>
insn.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX735"></A>
<A NAME="IDX736"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`call_pop'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`call_value_pop'</SAMP>
<DD>Similar to <SAMP>`call'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`call_value'</SAMP>, except used if defined and
if <CODE>RETURN_POPS_ARGS</CODE> is non-zero.  They should emit a <CODE>parallel</CODE>
that contains both the function call and a <CODE>set</CODE> to indicate the
adjustment made to the frame pointer.
<P>

For machines where <CODE>RETURN_POPS_ARGS</CODE> can be non-zero, the use of these
patterns increases the number of functions for which the frame pointer
can be eliminated, if desired.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX737"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`return'</SAMP>
<DD>Subroutine return instruction.  This instruction pattern name should be
defined only if a single instruction can do all the work of returning
from a function.
<P>

Like the <SAMP>`mov<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP> patterns, this pattern is also used after the
RTL generation phase.  In this case it is to support machines where
multiple instructions are usually needed to return from a function, but
some class of functions only requires one instruction to implement a
return.  Normally, the applicable functions are those which do not need
to save any registers or allocate stack space.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX738"></A>
<A NAME="IDX739"></A>
For such machines, the condition specified in this pattern should only
be true when <CODE>reload_completed</CODE> is non-zero and the function's
epilogue would only be a single instruction.  For machines with register
windows, the routine <CODE>leaf_function_p</CODE> may be used to determine if
a register window push is required.
</P><P>

Machines that have conditional return instructions should define patterns
such as

<A NAME="IDX740"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`nop'</SAMP>
<DD>No-op instruction.  This instruction pattern name should always be defined
to output a no-op in assembler code.  <CODE>(const_int 0)</CODE> will do as an
RTL pattern.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX741"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`indirect_jump'</SAMP>
<DD>An instruction to jump to an address which is operand zero.
This pattern name is mandatory on all machines.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX742"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`casesi'</SAMP>
<DD>Instruction to jump through a dispatch table, including bounds checking.
This instruction takes five operands:
<P>

<OL>
<LI>
The index to dispatch on, which has mode <CODE>SImode</CODE>.
<P>

<LI>
The lower bound for indices in the table, an integer constant.
<P>

<LI>
The total range of indices in the table--the largest index
minus the smallest one (both inclusive).
<P>

<LI>
A label that precedes the table itself.
<P>

<LI>
A label to jump to if the index has a value outside the bounds.
(If the machine-description macro <CODE>CASE_DROPS_THROUGH</CODE> is defined,
then an out-of-bounds index drops through to the code following
the jump table instead of jumping to this label.  In that case,
this label is not actually used by the <SAMP>`casesi'</SAMP> instruction,
but it is always provided as an operand.)
</OL>
<P>

The table is a <CODE>addr_vec</CODE> or <CODE>addr_diff_vec</CODE> inside of a
<CODE>jump_insn</CODE>.  The number of elements in the table is one plus the
difference between the upper bound and the lower bound.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX743"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`tablejump'</SAMP>
<DD>Instruction to jump to a variable address.  This is a low-level
capability which can be used to implement a dispatch table when there
is no <SAMP>`casesi'</SAMP> pattern.
<P>

This pattern requires two operands: the address or offset, and a label
which should immediately precede the jump table.  If the macro
<CODE>CASE_VECTOR_PC_RELATIVE</CODE> is defined then the first operand is an
offset which counts from the address of the table; otherwise, it is an
absolute address to jump to.  In either case, the first operand has
mode <CODE>Pmode</CODE>.
</P><P>

The <SAMP>`tablejump'</SAMP> insn is always the last insn before the jump
table it uses.  Its assembler code normally has no need to use the
second operand, but you should incorporate it in the RTL pattern so
that the jump optimizer will not delete the table as unreachable code.

<DD>Most machines save and restore the stack pointer by copying it to or
from an object of mode <CODE>Pmode</CODE>.  Do not define these patterns on
such machines.
<P>

Some machines require special handling for stack pointer saves and
restores.  On those machines, define the patterns corresponding to the
non-standard cases by using a <CODE>define_expand</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC138">13.13 Defining RTL Sequences for Code Generation</A>) that produces the required insns.  The three types of
saves and restores are:
</P><P>

<OL>
<LI>
<SAMP>`save_stack_block'</SAMP> saves the stack pointer at the start of a block
that allocates a variable-sized object and <SAMP>`restore_stack_block'</SAMP>
restores the stack pointer when the block is exited.
<P>

<LI>
<SAMP>`save_stack_function'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`restore_stack_function'</SAMP> operate
similarly for the outermost block of a function and are used when the
function allocates variable-sized objects or calls <CODE>alloca</CODE>.  Only
the epilogue uses the restored stack pointer, allowing a simpler save or
restore sequence on some machines.
<P>

<LI>
<SAMP>`save_stack_nonlocal'</SAMP> is used in functions that contain labels
branched to by nested functions.  It saves the stack pointer in such a
way that the inner function can use <SAMP>`restore_stack_nonlocal'</SAMP> to
restore the stack pointer.  The compiler generates code to restore the
frame and argument pointer registers, but some machines require saving
and restoring additional data such as register window information or
stack backchains.  Place insns in these patterns to save and restore any
such required data.
</OL>
<P>

When saving the stack pointer, operand 0 is the save area and operand 1
is the stack pointer.  The mode used to allocate the save area is the
mode of operand 0.  You must specify an integral mode, or
<CODE>VOIDmode</CODE> if no save area is needed for a particular type of save
(either because no save is needed or because a machine-specific save
area can be used).  Operand 0 is the stack pointer and operand 1 is the
save area for restore operations.  If <SAMP>`save_stack_block'</SAMP> is
defined, operand 0 must not be <CODE>VOIDmode</CODE> since these saves can be
arbitrarily nested.
</P><P>

A save area is a <CODE>mem</CODE> that is at a constant offset from
<CODE>virtual_stack_vars_rtx</CODE> when the stack pointer is saved for use by
nonlocal gotos and a <CODE>reg</CODE> in the other two cases.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX750"></A>
<DT><SAMP>`allocate_stack'</SAMP>
<DD>Subtract operand 0 from the stack pointer to create space for
for dynamically allocated data.
<P>

Do not define this pattern if all that must be done is the subtraction.
On some machines require other operations such as stack probes or
maintaining the back chain.  Define this pattern to emit those
operations in addition to updating the stack pointer.

<H2> 13.8 When the Order of Patterns Matters </H2>
<!--docid::SEC133::-->
<P>

Sometimes an insn can match more than one instruction pattern.  Then the
pattern that appears first in the machine description is the one used.
Therefore, more specific patterns (patterns that will match fewer things)
and faster instructions (those that will produce better code when they
do match) should usually go first in the description.

In some cases the effect of ordering the patterns can be used to hide
a pattern when it is not valid.  For example, the 68000 has an
instruction for converting a fullword to floating point and another
for converting a byte to floating point.  An instruction converting
an integer to floating point could match either one.  We put the
pattern to convert the fullword first to make sure that one will
be used rather than the other.  (Otherwise a large integer might
be generated as a single-byte immediate quantity, which would not work.)
Instead of using this pattern ordering it would be possible to make the
pattern for convert-a-byte smart enough to deal properly with any
constant value.

Every machine description must have a named pattern for each of the
conditional branch names <SAMP>`b<VAR>cond</VAR>'</SAMP>.  The recognition template
must always have the form
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(set (pc)
     (if_then_else (<VAR>cond</VAR> (cc0) (const_int 0))

                   (pc)))
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In addition, every machine description must have an anonymous pattern
for each of the possible reverse-conditional branches.  Their templates
look like
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(set (pc)
     (if_then_else (<VAR>cond</VAR> (cc0) (const_int 0))
                   (pc)
                   (label_ref (match_operand 0 "" ""))))
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

They are necessary because jump optimization can turn direct-conditional
branches into reverse-conditional branches.
</P><P>

It is often convenient to use the <CODE>match_operator</CODE> construct to
reduce the number of patterns that must be specified for branches.  For
example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_insn ""
  [(set (pc)
        (if_then_else (match_operator 0 "comparison_operator"
                                      [(cc0) (const_int 0)])
                      (pc)
                      (label_ref (match_operand 1 "" ""))))]
  "<VAR>condition</VAR>"
  "<small>...</small>")
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

In some cases machines support instructions identical except for the
machine mode of one or more operands.  For example, there may be
"sign-extend halfword" and "sign-extend byte" instructions whose
patterns are
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(set (match_operand:SI 0 <small>...</small>)
     (extend:SI (match_operand:HI 1 <small>...</small>)))

(set (match_operand:SI 0 <small>...</small>)
     (extend:SI (match_operand:QI 1 <small>...</small>)))
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Constant integers do not specify a machine mode, so an instruction to
extend a constant value could match either pattern.  The pattern it
actually will match is the one that appears first in the file.  For correct
results, this must be the one for the widest possible mode (<CODE>HImode</CODE>,
here).  If the pattern matches the <CODE>QImode</CODE> instruction, the results
will be incorrect if the constant value does not actually fit that mode.
</P><P>

Such instructions to extend constants are rarely generated because they are
optimized away, but they do occasionally happen in nonoptimized
compilations.
</P><P>

If a constraint in a pattern allows a constant, the reload pass may
replace a register with a constant permitted by the constraint in some
cases.  Similarly for memory references.  You must ensure that the
predicate permits all objects allowed by the constraints to prevent the
compiler from crashing.
</P><P>

Because of this substitution, you should not provide separate patterns
for increment and decrement instructions.  Instead, they should be 
generated from the same pattern that supports register-register add
insns by examining the operands and generating the appropriate machine
instruction.

<H2> 13.10 Defining Jump Instruction Patterns </H2>
<!--docid::SEC135::-->
<P>

For most machines, GNU CC assumes that the machine has a condition code.
A comparison insn sets the condition code, recording the results of both
signed and unsigned comparison of the given operands.  A separate branch
insn tests the condition code and branches or not according its value.
The branch insns come in distinct signed and unsigned flavors.  Many
common machines, such as the Vax, the 68000 and the 32000, work this
way.
</P><P>

Some machines have distinct signed and unsigned compare instructions, and
only one set of conditional branch instructions.  The easiest way to handle
these machines is to treat them just like the others until the final stage
where assembly code is written.  At this time, when outputting code for the
compare instruction, peek ahead at the following branch using
<CODE>next_cc0_user (insn)</CODE>.  (The variable <CODE>insn</CODE> refers to the insn
being output, in the output-writing code in an instruction pattern.)  If
the RTL says that is an unsigned branch, output an unsigned compare;
otherwise output a signed compare.  When the branch itself is output, you
can treat signed and unsigned branches identically.
</P><P>

The reason you can do this is that GNU CC always generates a pair of
consecutive RTL insns, possibly separated by <CODE>note</CODE> insns, one to
set the condition code and one to test it, and keeps the pair inviolate
until the end.
</P><P>

To go with this technique, you must define the machine-description macro
<CODE>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</CODE> to do <CODE>CC_STATUS_INIT</CODE>; in other words, no
compare instruction is superfluous.
</P><P>

Some machines have compare-and-branch instructions and no condition code.
A similar technique works for them.  When it is time to "output" a
compare instruction, record its operands in two static variables.  When
outputting the branch-on-condition-code instruction that follows, actually
output a compare-and-branch instruction that uses the remembered operands.
</P><P>

It also works to define patterns for compare-and-branch instructions.
In optimizing compilation, the pair of compare and branch instructions
will be combined according to these patterns.  But this does not happen
if optimization is not requested.  So you must use one of the solutions
above in addition to any special patterns you define.
</P><P>

In many RISC machines, most instructions do not affect the condition
code and there may not even be a separate condition code register.  On
these machines, the restriction that the definition and use of the
condition code be adjacent insns is not necessary and can prevent
important optimizations.  For example, on the IBM RS/6000, there is a
delay for taken branches unless the condition code register is set three
instructions earlier than the conditional branch.  The instruction
scheduler cannot perform this optimization if it is not permitted to
separate the definition and use of the condition code register.
</P><P>

On these machines, do not use <CODE>(cc0)</CODE>, but instead use a register
to represent the condition code.  If there is a specific condition code
register in the machine, use a hard register.  If the condition code or
comparison result can be placed in any general register, or if there are
multiple condition registers, use a pseudo register.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX751"></A>
<A NAME="IDX752"></A>
On some machines, the type of branch instruction generated may depend on
the way the condition code was produced; for example, on the 68k and
Sparc, setting the condition code directly from an add or subtract
instruction does not clear the overflow bit the way that a test
instruction does, so a different branch instruction must be used for
some conditional branches.  For machines that use <CODE>(cc0)</CODE>, the set
and use of the condition code must be adjacent (separated only by
<CODE>note</CODE> insns) allowing flags in <CODE>cc_status</CODE> to be used.
(See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC177">14.12 Condition Code Status</A>.)  Also, the comparison and branch insns can be
located from each other by using the functions <CODE>prev_cc0_setter</CODE>
and <CODE>next_cc0_user</CODE>.
</P><P>

However, this is not true on machines that do not use <CODE>(cc0)</CODE>.  On
those machines, no assumptions can be made about the adjacency of the
compare and branch insns and the above methods cannot be used.  Instead,
we use the machine mode of the condition code register to record
different formats of the condition code register.
</P><P>

Registers used to store the condition code value should have a mode that
is in class <CODE>MODE_CC</CODE>.  Normally, it will be <CODE>CCmode</CODE>.  If
additional modes are required (as for the add example mentioned above in
the Sparc), define the macro <CODE>EXTRA_CC_MODES</CODE> to list the
additional modes required (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC177">14.12 Condition Code Status</A>).  Also define
<CODE>EXTRA_CC_NAMES</CODE> to list the names of those modes and
<CODE>SELECT_CC_MODE</CODE> to choose a mode given an operand of a compare.
</P><P>

If it is known during RTL generation that a different mode will be
required (for example, if the machine has separate compare instructions
for signed and unsigned quantities, like most IBM processors), they can
be specified at that time.
</P><P>

If the cases that require different modes would be made by instruction
combination, the macro <CODE>SELECT_CC_MODE</CODE> determines which machine
mode should be used for the comparison result.  The patterns should be
written using that mode.  To support the case of the add on the Sparc
discussed above, we have the pattern
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_insn ""
  [(set (reg:CC_NOOV 0)
        (compare:CC_NOOV (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "%r")

                         (const_int 0)))]
  ""
  "<small>...</small>")
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The <CODE>SELECT_CC_MODE</CODE> macro on the Sparc returns <CODE>CC_NOOVmode</CODE>
for comparisons whose argument is a <CODE>plus</CODE>.

There are often cases where multiple RTL expressions could represent an
operation performed by a single machine instruction.  This situation is
most commonly encountered with logical, branch, and multiply-accumulate
instructions.  In such cases, the compiler attempts to convert these
multiple RTL expressions into a single canonical form to reduce the
number of insn patterns required.

<H2> 13.12 Defining Machine-Specific Peephole Optimizers </H2>
<!--docid::SEC137::-->
<P>

In addition to instruction patterns the <TT>`md'</TT> file may contain
definitions of machine-specific peephole optimizations.
</P><P>

The combiner does not notice certain peephole optimizations when the data
flow in the program does not suggest that it should try them.  For example,
sometimes two consecutive insns related in purpose can be combined even
though the second one does not appear to use a register computed in the
first one.  A machine-specific peephole optimizer can detect such
opportunities.
</P><P>

A definition looks like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_peephole
  [<VAR>insn-pattern-1</VAR>
   <VAR>insn-pattern-2</VAR>
   <small>...</small>]
  "<VAR>condition</VAR>"
  "<VAR>template</VAR>"
  "<VAR>optional insn-attributes</VAR>")
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The last string operand may be omitted if you are not using any
machine-specific information in this machine description.  If present,
it must obey the same rules as in a <CODE>define_insn</CODE>.
</P><P>

In this skeleton, <VAR>insn-pattern-1</VAR> and so on are patterns to match
consecutive insns.  The optimization applies to a sequence of insns when
<VAR>insn-pattern-1</VAR> matches the first one, <VAR>insn-pattern-2</VAR> matches
the next, and so on.</P><P>

Each of the insns matched by a peephole must also match a
<CODE>define_insn</CODE>.  Peepholes are checked only at the last stage just
before code generation, and only optionally.  Therefore, any insn which
would match a peephole but no <CODE>define_insn</CODE> will cause a crash in code
generation in an unoptimized compilation, or at various optimization
stages.
</P><P>

The operands of the insns are matched with <CODE>match_operands</CODE>,
<CODE>match_operator</CODE>, and <CODE>match_dup</CODE>, as usual.  What is not
usual is that the operand numbers apply to all the insn patterns in the
definition.  So, you can check for identical operands in two insns by
using <CODE>match_operand</CODE> in one insn and <CODE>match_dup</CODE> in the
other.
</P><P>

The operand constraints used in <CODE>match_operand</CODE> patterns do not have
any direct effect on the applicability of the peephole, but they will
be validated afterward, so make sure your constraints are general enough
to apply whenever the peephole matches.  If the peephole matches
but the constraints are not satisfied, the compiler will crash.
</P><P>

It is safe to omit constraints in all the operands of the peephole; or
you can write constraints which serve as a double-check on the criteria
previously tested.
</P><P>

Once a sequence of insns matches the patterns, the <VAR>condition</VAR> is
checked.  This is a C expression which makes the final decision whether to
perform the optimization (we do so if the expression is nonzero).  If
<VAR>condition</VAR> is omitted (in other words, the string is empty) then the
optimization is applied to every sequence of insns that matches the
patterns.
</P><P>

The defined peephole optimizations are applied after register allocation
is complete.  Therefore, the peephole definition can check which
operands have ended up in which kinds of registers, just by looking at
the operands.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX765"></A>
The way to refer to the operands in <VAR>condition</VAR> is to write
<CODE>operands[<VAR>i</VAR>]</CODE> for operand number <VAR>i</VAR> (as matched by
<CODE>(match_operand <VAR>i</VAR> <small>...</small>)</CODE>).  Use the variable <CODE>insn</CODE>
to refer to the last of the insns being matched; use
<CODE>prev_nonnote_insn</CODE> to find the preceding insns.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX766"></A>
When optimizing computations with intermediate results, you can use
<VAR>condition</VAR> to match only when the intermediate results are not used
elsewhere.  Use the C expression <CODE>dead_or_set_p (<VAR>insn</VAR>,
<VAR>op</VAR>)</CODE>, where <VAR>insn</VAR> is the insn in which you expect the value
to be used for the last time (from the value of <CODE>insn</CODE>, together
with use of <CODE>prev_nonnote_insn</CODE>), and <VAR>op</VAR> is the intermediate
value (from <CODE>operands[<VAR>i</VAR>]</CODE>).</P><P>

Applying the optimization means replacing the sequence of insns with one
new insn.  The <VAR>template</VAR> controls ultimate output of assembler code
for this combined insn.  It works exactly like the template of a
<CODE>define_insn</CODE>.  Operand numbers in this template are the same ones
used in matching the original sequence of insns.
</P><P>

The result of a defined peephole optimizer does not need to match any of
the insn patterns in the machine description; it does not even have an
opportunity to match them.  The peephole optimizer definition itself serves
as the insn pattern to control how the insn is output.
</P><P>

Defined peephole optimizers are run as assembler code is being output,
so the insns they produce are never combined or rearranged in any way.
</P><P>

Here is an example, taken from the 68000 machine description:

<H2> 13.13 Defining RTL Sequences for Code Generation </H2>
<!--docid::SEC138::-->
<P>

On some target machines, some standard pattern names for RTL generation
cannot be handled with single insn, but a sequence of RTL insns can
represent them.  For these target machines, you can write a
<CODE>define_expand</CODE> to specify how to generate the sequence of RTL.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX767"></A>
A <CODE>define_expand</CODE> is an RTL expression that looks almost like a
<CODE>define_insn</CODE>; but, unlike the latter, a <CODE>define_expand</CODE> is used
only for RTL generation and it can produce more than one RTL insn.
</P><P>

A <CODE>define_expand</CODE> RTX has four operands:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
The name.  Each <CODE>define_expand</CODE> must have a name, since the only
use for it is to refer to it by name.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX768"></A>
<LI>
The RTL template.  This is just like the RTL template for a
<CODE>define_peephole</CODE> in that it is a vector of RTL expressions
each being one insn.
<P>

<LI>
The condition, a string containing a C expression.  This expression is
used to express how the availability of this pattern depends on
subclasses of target machine, selected by command-line options when
GNU CC is run.  This is just like the condition of a
<CODE>define_insn</CODE> that has a standard name.
<P>

<LI>
The preparation statements, a string containing zero or more C
statements which are to be executed before RTL code is generated from
the RTL template.
<P>

Usually these statements prepare temporary registers for use as
internal operands in the RTL template, but they can also generate RTL
insns directly by calling routines such as <CODE>emit_insn</CODE>, etc.
Any such insns precede the ones that come from the RTL template.
</UL>
<P>

Every RTL insn emitted by a <CODE>define_expand</CODE> must match some
<CODE>define_insn</CODE> in the machine description.  Otherwise, the compiler
will crash when trying to generate code for the insn or trying to optimize
it.
</P><P>

The RTL template, in addition to controlling generation of RTL insns,
also describes the operands that need to be specified when this pattern
is used.  In particular, it gives a predicate for each operand.
</P><P>

A true operand, which needs to be specified in order to generate RTL from
the pattern, should be described with a <CODE>match_operand</CODE> in its first
occurrence in the RTL template.  This enters information on the operand's
predicate into the tables that record such things.  GNU CC uses the
information to preload the operand into a register if that is required for
valid RTL code.  If the operand is referred to more than once, subsequent
references should use <CODE>match_dup</CODE>.
</P><P>

The RTL template may also refer to internal "operands" which are
temporary registers or labels used only within the sequence made by the
<CODE>define_expand</CODE>.  Internal operands are substituted into the RTL
template with <CODE>match_dup</CODE>, never with <CODE>match_operand</CODE>.  The
values of the internal operands are not passed in as arguments by the
compiler when it requests use of this pattern.  Instead, they are computed
within the pattern, in the preparation statements.  These statements
compute the values and store them into the appropriate elements of
<CODE>operands</CODE> so that <CODE>match_dup</CODE> can find them.
</P><P>

There are two special macros defined for use in the preparation statements:
<CODE>DONE</CODE> and <CODE>FAIL</CODE>.  Use them with a following semicolon,
as a statement.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>

<A NAME="IDX769"></A>
<DT><CODE>DONE</CODE>
<DD>Use the <CODE>DONE</CODE> macro to end RTL generation for the pattern.  The
only RTL insns resulting from the pattern on this occasion will be
those already emitted by explicit calls to <CODE>emit_insn</CODE> within the
preparation statements; the RTL template will not be generated.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX770"></A>
<DT><CODE>FAIL</CODE>
<DD>Make the pattern fail on this occasion.  When a pattern fails, it means
that the pattern was not truly available.  The calling routines in the
compiler will try other strategies for code generation using other patterns.
<P>

Failure is currently supported only for binary (addition, multiplication,
shifting, etc.) and bitfield (<CODE>extv</CODE>, <CODE>extzv</CODE>, and <CODE>insv</CODE>)
operations.
</DL>
<P>

Here is an example, the definition of left-shift for the SPUR chip:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_expand "ashlsi3"
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "")
        (ashift:SI
          (match_operand:SI 1 "register_operand" "")
          (match_operand:SI 2 "nonmemory_operand" "")))]
  ""
  "
{
  if (GET_CODE (operands[2]) != CONST_INT
      || (unsigned) INTVAL (operands[2]) &#62; 3)
    FAIL;
}")
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This example uses <CODE>define_expand</CODE> so that it can generate an RTL insn
for shifting when the shift-count is in the supported range of 0 to 3 but
fail in other cases where machine insns aren't available.  When it fails,
the compiler tries another strategy using different patterns (such as, a
library call).
</P><P>

If the compiler were able to handle nontrivial condition-strings in
patterns with names, then it would be possible to use a
<CODE>define_insn</CODE> in that case.  Here is another case (zero-extension
on the 68000) which makes more use of the power of <CODE>define_expand</CODE>:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_expand "zero_extendhisi2"
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "")
        (const_int 0))
   (set (strict_low_part
          (subreg:HI
            (match_dup 0)
            0))
        (match_operand:HI 1 "general_operand" ""))]
  ""
  "operands[1] = make_safe_from (operands[1], operands[0]);")
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX771"></A>
Here two RTL insns are generated, one to clear the entire output operand
and the other to copy the input operand into its low half.  This sequence
is incorrect if the input operand refers to [the old value of] the output
operand, so the preparation statement makes sure this isn't so.  The
function <CODE>make_safe_from</CODE> copies the <CODE>operands[1]</CODE> into a
temporary register if it refers to <CODE>operands[0]</CODE>.  It does this
by emitting another RTL insn.
</P><P>

Finally, a third example shows the use of an internal operand.
Zero-extension on the SPUR chip is done by <CODE>and</CODE>-ing the result
against a halfword mask.  But this mask cannot be represented by a
<CODE>const_int</CODE> because the constant value is too large to be legitimate
on this machine.  So it must be copied into a register with
<CODE>force_reg</CODE> and then the register used in the <CODE>and</CODE>.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_expand "zero_extendhisi2"
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "")
        (and:SI (subreg:SI
                  (match_operand:HI 1 "register_operand" "")
                  0)
                (match_dup 2)))]
  ""
  "operands[2]
     = force_reg (SImode, gen_rtx (CONST_INT,
                                   VOIDmode, 65535)); ")
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> If the <CODE>define_expand</CODE> is used to serve a
standard binary or unary arithmetic operation or a bitfield operation,
then the last insn it generates must not be a <CODE>code_label</CODE>,
<CODE>barrier</CODE> or <CODE>note</CODE>.  It must be an <CODE>insn</CODE>,
<CODE>jump_insn</CODE> or <CODE>call_insn</CODE>.  If you don't need a real insn
at the end, emit an insn to copy the result of the operation into
itself.  Such an insn will generate no code, but it can avoid problems
in the compiler.</P><P>

<H2> 13.14 Splitting Instructions into Multiple Instructions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC139::-->
<P>

There are two cases where you should specify how to split a pattern into
multiple insns.  On machines that have instructions requiring delay
slots (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC147">13.15.7 Delay Slot Scheduling</A>) or that have instructions whose output is
not available for multiple cycles (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC148">13.15.8 Specifying Function Units</A>), the compiler
phases that optimize these cases need to be able to move insns into
one-cycle delay slots.  However, some insns may generate more than one
machine instruction.  These insns cannot be placed into a delay slot.
</P><P>

Often you can rewrite the single insn as a list of individual insns,
each corresponding to one machine instruction.  The disadvantage of
doing so is that it will cause the compilation to be slower and require
more space.  If the resulting insns are too complex, it may also
suppress some optimizations.  The compiler splits the insn if there is a
reason to believe that it might improve instruction or delay slot
scheduling.
</P><P>

The insn combiner phase also splits putative insns.  If three insns are
merged into one insn with a complex expression that cannot be matched by
some <CODE>define_insn</CODE> pattern, the combiner phase attempts to split
the complex pattern into two insns that are recognized.  Usually it can
break the complex pattern into two patterns by splitting out some
subexpression.  However, in some other cases, such as performing an
addition of a large constant in two insns on a RISC machine, the way to
split the addition into two insns is machine-dependent.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX772"></A>
The <CODE>define_split</CODE> definition tells the compiler how to split a
complex insn into several simpler insns.  It looks like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_split
  [<VAR>insn-pattern</VAR>]
  "<VAR>condition</VAR>"
  [<VAR>new-insn-pattern-1</VAR>
   <VAR>new-insn-pattern-2</VAR>
   <small>...</small>]
  "<VAR>preparation statements</VAR>")
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<VAR>insn-pattern</VAR> is a pattern that needs to be split and
<VAR>condition</VAR> is the final condition to be tested, as in a
<CODE>define_insn</CODE>.  When an insn matching <VAR>insn-pattern</VAR> and
satisfying <VAR>condition</VAR> is found, it is replaced in the insn list
with the insns given by <VAR>new-insn-pattern-1</VAR>,
<VAR>new-insn-pattern-2</VAR>, etc.
</P><P>

The <VAR>preparation statements</VAR> are similar to those specified for
<CODE>define_expand</CODE> (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC138">13.13 Defining RTL Sequences for Code Generation</A>) and are executed
before the new RTL is generated to prepare for the generated code
or emit some insns whose pattern is not fixed.  Unlike those in
<CODE>define_expand</CODE>, however, these statements must not generate
any new pseudo-registers.  Once reload has completed, they also
must not allocate any space in the stack frame.
</P><P>

Patterns are matched against <VAR>insn-pattern</VAR> in two different
circumstances.  If an insn needs to be split for delay slot scheduling
or insn scheduling, the insn is already known to be valid, which means
that it must have been matched by some <CODE>define_insn</CODE> and, if
<CODE>reload_completed</CODE> is non-zero, is known to satisfy the constraints
of that <CODE>define_insn</CODE>.  In that case, the new insn patterns must
also be insns that are matched by some <CODE>define_insn</CODE> and, if
<CODE>reload_completed</CODE> is non-zero, must also satisfy the constraints
of those definitions.
</P><P>

As an example of this usage of <CODE>define_split</CODE>, consider the following
example from <TT>`a29k.md'</TT>, which splits a <CODE>sign_extend</CODE> from
<CODE>HImode</CODE> to <CODE>SImode</CODE> into a pair of shift insns:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_split
  [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "gen_reg_operand" "")
        (sign_extend:SI (match_operand:HI 1 "gen_reg_operand" "")))]
  ""
  [(set (match_dup 0)
        (ashift:SI (match_dup 1)
                   (const_int 16)))
   (set (match_dup 0)
        (ashiftrt:SI (match_dup 0)
                     (const_int 16)))]
  "
{ operands[1] = gen_lowpart (SImode, operands[1]); }")
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

When the combiner phase tries to split an insn pattern, it is always the
case that the pattern is <EM>not</EM> matched by any <CODE>define_insn</CODE>.
The combiner pass first tries to split a single <CODE>set</CODE> expression
and then the same <CODE>set</CODE> expression inside a <CODE>parallel</CODE>, but
followed by a <CODE>clobber</CODE> of a pseudo-reg to use as a scratch
register.  In these cases, the combiner expects exactly two new insn
patterns to be generated.  It will verify that these patterns match some
<CODE>define_insn</CODE> definitions, so you need not do this test in the
<CODE>define_split</CODE> (of course, there is no point in writing a
<CODE>define_split</CODE> that will never produce insns that match).

accepts some insns that match some <CODE>define_insn</CODE> as well as some
insns that don't.  Instead, write two separate <CODE>define_split</CODE>
definitions, one for the insns that are valid and one for the insns that
are not valid.

In addition to describing the instruction supported by the target machine,
the <TT>`md'</TT> file also defines a group of <EM>attributes</EM> and a set of
values for each.  Every generated insn is assigned a value for each attribute.
One possible attribute would be the effect that the insn has on the machine's
condition code.  This attribute can then be used by <CODE>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</CODE>
to track the condition codes.

<!--docid::SEC141::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX773"></A>
The <CODE>define_attr</CODE> expression is used to define each attribute required
by the target machine.  It looks like:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_attr <VAR>name</VAR> <VAR>list-of-values</VAR> <VAR>default</VAR>)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<VAR>name</VAR> is a string specifying the name of the attribute being defined.
</P><P>

<VAR>list-of-values</VAR> is either a string that specifies a comma-separated
list of values that can be assigned to the attribute, or a null string to
indicate that the attribute takes numeric values.
</P><P>

<VAR>default</VAR> is an attribute expression that gives the value of this
attribute for insns that match patterns whose definition does not include
an explicit value for this attribute.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC144">13.15.4 Example of Attribute Specifications</A>, for more
information on the handling of defaults.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC146">13.15.6 Constant Attributes</A>,
for information on attributes that do not depend on any particular insn.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX774"></A>
For each defined attribute, a number of definitions are written to the
<TT>`insn-attr.h'</TT> file.  For cases where an explicit set of values is
specified for an attribute, the following are defined:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
A <SAMP>`#define'</SAMP> is written for the symbol <SAMP>`HAVE_ATTR_<VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP>.
<P>

<LI>
An enumeral class is defined for <SAMP>`attr_<VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP> with
elements of the form <SAMP>`<VAR>upper-name</VAR>_<VAR>upper-value</VAR>'</SAMP> where
the attribute name and value are first converted to upper case.
<P>

<LI>
A function <SAMP>`get_attr_<VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP> is defined that is passed an insn and
returns the attribute value for that insn.
</UL>
<P>

For example, if the following is present in the <TT>`md'</TT> file:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_attr "type" "branch,fp,load,store,arith" <small>...</small>)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

the following lines will be written to the file <TT>`insn-attr.h'</TT>.
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define HAVE_ATTR_type
enum attr_type {TYPE_BRANCH, TYPE_FP, TYPE_LOAD,
                 TYPE_STORE, TYPE_ARITH};
extern enum attr_type get_attr_type ();
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If the attribute takes numeric values, no <CODE>enum</CODE> type will be
defined and the function to obtain the attribute's value will return
<CODE>int</CODE>.

<!--docid::SEC142::-->
<P>

RTL expressions used to define attributes use the codes described above
plus a few specific to attribute definitions, to be discussed below. 
Attribute value expressions must have one of the following forms:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX775"></A>
<DT><CODE>(const_int <VAR>i</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>The integer <VAR>i</VAR> specifies the value of a numeric attribute.  <VAR>i</VAR>
must be non-negative.
<P>

The value of a numeric attribute can be specified either with a
<CODE>const_int</CODE> or as an integer represented as a string in
<CODE>const_string</CODE>, <CODE>eq_attr</CODE> (see below), and <CODE>set_attr</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC143">13.15.3 Assigning Attribute Values to Insns</A>) expressions.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX776"></A>
<DT><CODE>(const_string <VAR>value</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>The string <VAR>value</VAR> specifies a constant attribute value.
If <VAR>value</VAR> is specified as <SAMP>`"*"'</SAMP>, it means that the default value of
the attribute is to be used for the insn containing this expression.
<SAMP>`"*"'</SAMP> obviously cannot be used in the <VAR>default</VAR> expression
of a <CODE>define_attr</CODE>.<P>

If the attribute whose value is being specified is numeric, <VAR>value</VAR>
must be a string containing a non-negative integer (normally
<CODE>const_int</CODE> would be used in this case).  Otherwise, it must
contain one of the valid values for the attribute.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX777"></A>
<DT><CODE>(if_then_else <VAR>test</VAR> <VAR>true-value</VAR> <VAR>false-value</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><VAR>test</VAR> specifies an attribute test, whose format is defined below.
The value of this expression is <VAR>true-value</VAR> if <VAR>test</VAR> is true,
otherwise it is <VAR>false-value</VAR>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX778"></A>
<DT><CODE>(cond [<VAR>test1</VAR> <VAR>value1</VAR> <small>...</small>] <VAR>default</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>The first operand of this expression is a vector containing an even
number of expressions and consisting of pairs of <VAR>test</VAR> and <VAR>value</VAR>
expressions.  The value of the <CODE>cond</CODE> expression is that of the
<VAR>value</VAR> corresponding to the first true <VAR>test</VAR> expression.  If
none of the <VAR>test</VAR> expressions are true, the value of the <CODE>cond</CODE>
expression is that of the <VAR>default</VAR> expression.

<VAR>test</VAR> expressions can have one of the following forms:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX779"></A>

<DD>These tests are true if the indicated logical function is true.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX783"></A>
<DT><CODE>(match_operand:<VAR>m</VAR> <VAR>n</VAR> <VAR>pred</VAR> <VAR>constraints</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>This test is true if operand <VAR>n</VAR> of the insn whose attribute value
is being determined has mode <VAR>m</VAR> (this part of the test is ignored
if <VAR>m</VAR> is <CODE>VOIDmode</CODE>) and the function specified by the string
<VAR>pred</VAR> returns a non-zero value when passed operand <VAR>n</VAR> and mode
<VAR>m</VAR> (this part of the test is ignored if <VAR>pred</VAR> is the null
string).
<P>

The <VAR>constraints</VAR> operand is ignored and should be the null string.

<CODE>const_int</CODE> and <CODE>symbol_ref</CODE> are always valid terms (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC145">13.15.5 Computing the Length of an Insn</A>,for additional forms).  <CODE>symbol_ref</CODE> is a string
denoting a C expression that yields an <CODE>int</CODE> when evaluated by the
<SAMP>`get_attr_<small>...</small>'</SAMP> routine.  It should normally be a global
variable.</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX805"></A>
<DT><CODE>(eq_attr <VAR>name</VAR> <VAR>value</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><VAR>name</VAR> is a string specifying the name of an attribute.
<P>

<VAR>value</VAR> is a string that is either a valid value for attribute
<VAR>name</VAR>, a comma-separated list of values, or <SAMP>`!'</SAMP> followed by a
value or list.  If <VAR>value</VAR> does not begin with a <SAMP>`!'</SAMP>, this
test is true if the value of the <VAR>name</VAR> attribute of the current
insn is in the list specified by <VAR>value</VAR>.  If <VAR>value</VAR> begins
with a <SAMP>`!'</SAMP>, this test is true if the attribute's value is
<EM>not</EM> in the specified list.
</P><P>

For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(eq_attr "type" "load,store")
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

is equivalent to
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(ior (eq_attr "type" "load") (eq_attr "type" "store"))
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If <VAR>name</VAR> specifies an attribute of <SAMP>`alternative'</SAMP>, it refers to the
value of the compiler variable <CODE>which_alternative</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC125">13.5 C Statements for Generating Assembler Output</A>) and the values must be small integers.  For
example,</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(eq_attr "alternative" "2,3")
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

is equivalent to

     (eq (symbol_ref "which_alternative") (const_int 3)))
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Note that, for most attributes, an <CODE>eq_attr</CODE> test is simplified in cases
where the value of the attribute being tested is known for all insns matching
a particular pattern.  This is by far the most common case.</DL>

<H3> 13.15.3 Assigning Attribute Values to Insns </H3>
<!--docid::SEC143::-->
<P>

The value assigned to an attribute of an insn is primarily determined by
which pattern is matched by that insn (or which <CODE>define_peephole</CODE>
generated it).  Every <CODE>define_insn</CODE> and <CODE>define_peephole</CODE> can
have an optional last argument to specify the values of attributes for
matching insns.  The value of any attribute not specified in a particular
insn is set to the default value for that attribute, as specified in its
<CODE>define_attr</CODE>.  Extensive use of default values for attributes
permits the specification of the values for only one or two attributes
in the definition of most insn patterns, as seen in the example in the
next section.</P><P>

The optional last argument of <CODE>define_insn</CODE> and
<CODE>define_peephole</CODE> is a vector of expressions, each of which defines
the value for a single attribute.  The most general way of assigning an
attribute's value is to use a <CODE>set</CODE> expression whose first operand is an
<CODE>attr</CODE> expression giving the name of the attribute being set.  The
second operand of the <CODE>set</CODE> is an attribute expression
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC142">13.15.2 Attribute Expressions</A>) giving the value of the attribute.</P><P>

When the attribute value depends on the <SAMP>`alternative'</SAMP> attribute
(i.e., which is the applicable alternative in the constraint of the
insn), the <CODE>set_attr_alternative</CODE> expression can be used.  It
allows the specification of a vector of attribute expressions, one for
each alternative.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX806"></A>
When the generality of arbitrary attribute expressions is not required,
the simpler <CODE>set_attr</CODE> expression can be used, which allows
specifying a string giving either a single attribute value or a list
of attribute values, one for each alternative.
</P><P>

The form of each of the above specifications is shown below.  In each case,
<VAR>name</VAR> is a string specifying the attribute to be set.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>(set_attr <VAR>name</VAR> <VAR>value-string</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><VAR>value-string</VAR> is either a string giving the desired attribute value,
or a string containing a comma-separated list giving the values for
succeeding alternatives.  The number of elements must match the number
of alternatives in the constraint of the insn pattern.
<P>

Note that it may be useful to specify <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> for some alternative, in
which case the attribute will assume its default value for insns matching
that alternative.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX807"></A>
<DT><CODE>(set_attr_alternative <VAR>name</VAR> [<VAR>value1</VAR> <VAR>value2</VAR> <small>...</small>])</CODE>
<DD>Depending on the alternative of the insn, the value will be one of the
specified values.  This is a shorthand for using a <CODE>cond</CODE> with
tests on the <SAMP>`alternative'</SAMP> attribute.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX808"></A>
<DT><CODE>(set (attr <VAR>name</VAR>) <VAR>value</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>The first operand of this <CODE>set</CODE> must be the special RTL expression
<CODE>attr</CODE>, whose sole operand is a string giving the name of the
attribute being set.  <VAR>value</VAR> is the value of the attribute.
</DL>
<P>

The following shows three different ways of representing the same
attribute value specification:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(set_attr "type" "load,store,arith")

(set_attr_alternative "type"
                      [(const_string "load") (const_string "store")
                       (const_string "arith")])

(set (attr "type")
     (cond [(eq_attr "alternative" "1") (const_string "load")
            (eq_attr "alternative" "2") (const_string "store")]
           (const_string "arith")))
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX809"></A>
The <CODE>define_asm_attributes</CODE> expression provides a mechanism to
specify the attributes assigned to insns produced from an <CODE>asm</CODE>
statement. It has the form:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_asm_attributes [<VAR>attr-sets</VAR>])
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

where <VAR>attr-sets</VAR> is specified the same as for <CODE>define_insn</CODE>
and <CODE>define_peephole</CODE> expressions.
</P><P>

These values will typically be the "worst case" attribute values.  For
example, they might indicate that the condition code will be clobbered.
</P><P>

A specification for a <CODE>length</CODE> attribute is handled specially.  To
compute the length of an <CODE>asm</CODE> insn, the length specified in the
<CODE>define_asm_attributes</CODE> expression is multiplied by the number of
machine instructions specified in the <CODE>asm</CODE> statement, determined
by counting the number of semicolons and newlines in the string.
Therefore, the value of the <CODE>length</CODE> attribute specified in a
<CODE>define_asm_attributes</CODE> should be the maximum possible length of a
single machine instruction.

<H3> 13.15.4 Example of Attribute Specifications </H3>
<!--docid::SEC144::-->
<P>

The judicious use of defaulting is important in the efficient use of
insn attributes.  Typically, insns are divided into <EM>types</EM> and an
attribute, customarily called <CODE>type</CODE>, is used to represent this
value.  This attribute is normally used only to define the default value
for other attributes.  An example will clarify this usage.
</P><P>

Assume we have a RISC machine with a condition code and in which only
full-word operations are performed in registers.  Let us assume that we
can divide all insns into loads, stores, (integer) arithmetic
operations, floating point operations, and branches.

Here we will concern ourselves with determining the effect of an insn on
the condition code and will limit ourselves to the following possible
effects:  The condition code can be set unpredictably (clobbered), not
be changed, be set to agree with the results of the operation, or only
changed if the item previously set into the condition code has been
modified.

performed on quantities smaller than a machine word clobber the condition
code since they will set the condition code to a value corresponding to the

<H3> 13.15.5 Computing the Length of an Insn </H3>
<!--docid::SEC145::-->
<P>

For many machines, multiple types of branch instructions are provided, each
for different length branch displacements.  In most cases, the assembler
will choose the correct instruction to use.  However, when the assembler
cannot do so, GCC can when a special attribute, the <SAMP>`length'</SAMP>
attribute, is defined.  This attribute must be defined to have numeric
values by specifying a null string in its <CODE>define_attr</CODE>.
</P><P>

In the case of the <SAMP>`length'</SAMP> attribute, two additional forms of
arithmetic terms are allowed in test expressions:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX810"></A>
<DT><CODE>(match_dup <VAR>n</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>This refers to the address of operand <VAR>n</VAR> of the current insn, which
must be a <CODE>label_ref</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX811"></A>
<DT><CODE>(pc)</CODE>
<DD>This refers to the address of the <EM>current</EM> insn.  It might have
been more consistent with other usage to make this the address of the
<EM>next</EM> insn but this would be confusing because the length of the 
current insn is to be computed.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="IDX812"></A>
<A NAME="IDX813"></A>
For normal insns, the length will be determined by value of the
<SAMP>`length'</SAMP> attribute.  In the case of <CODE>addr_vec</CODE> and
<CODE>addr_diff_vec</CODE> insn patterns, the length will be computed as
the number of vectors multiplied by the size of each vector.</P><P>

The following macros can be used to refine the length computation:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX814"></A>
<DT><CODE>FIRST_INSN_ADDRESS</CODE>
<DD>When the <CODE>length</CODE> insn attribute is used, this macro specifies the
value to be assigned to the address of the first insn in a function.  If
not specified, 0 is used.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX815"></A>
<DT><CODE>ADJUST_INSN_LENGTH (<VAR>insn</VAR>, <VAR>length</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>If defined, modifies the length assigned to instruction <VAR>insn</VAR> as a
function of the context in which it is used.  <VAR>length</VAR> is an lvalue
that contains the initially computed length of the insn and should be
updated with the correct length of the insn.  If updating is required,
<VAR>insn</VAR> must not be a varying-length insn.
<P>

This macro will normally not be required.  A case in which it is
required is the ROMP.  On this machine, the size of an <CODE>addr_vec</CODE>
insn must be increased by two to compensate for the fact that alignment
may be required.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="IDX816"></A>
The routine that returns the value of the <CODE>length</CODE> attribute,
<CODE>get_attr_length</CODE>, can be used by the output routine to determine
the form of the branch instruction to be written, as the example
below illustrates.
</P><P>

As an example of the specification of variable-length branches, consider
the IBM 360.  If we adopt the convention that a register will be set to
the starting address of a function, we can jump to labels within 4K of
the start using a four-byte instruction.  Otherwise, we need a six-byte
sequence to load the address from memory and then branch to it.
</P><P>

On such a machine, a pattern for a branch instruction might be specified
as follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_insn "jump"

<H3> 13.15.6 Constant Attributes </H3>
<!--docid::SEC146::-->
<P>

A special form of <CODE>define_attr</CODE>, where the expression for the
default value is a <CODE>const</CODE> expression, indicates an attribute that
is constant for a given run of the compiler.  Constant attributes may be
used to specify which variety of processor is used.  For example,
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_attr "cpu" "m88100,m88110,m88000"
 (const
  (cond [(symbol_ref "TARGET_88100") (const_string "m88100")
         (symbol_ref "TARGET_88110") (const_string "m88110")]
        (const_string "m88000"))))

(define_attr "memory" "fast,slow"
 (const
  (if_then_else (symbol_ref "TARGET_FAST_MEM")
                (const_string "fast")
                (const_string "slow"))))
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The routine generated for constant attributes has no parameters as it
does not depend on any particular insn.  RTL expressions used to define
the value of a constant attribute may use the <CODE>symbol_ref</CODE> form,
but may not use either the <CODE>match_operand</CODE> form or <CODE>eq_attr</CODE>
forms involving insn attributes.

<H3> 13.15.7 Delay Slot Scheduling </H3>
<!--docid::SEC147::-->
<P>

The insn attribute mechanism can be used to specify the requirements for
delay slots, if any, on a target machine.  An instruction is said to
require a <EM>delay slot</EM> if some instructions that are physically
after the instruction are executed as if they were located before it.
Classic examples are branch and call instructions, which often execute
the following instruction before the branch or call is performed.
</P><P>

On some machines, conditional branch instructions can optionally
<EM>annul</EM> instructions in the delay slot.  This means that the
instruction will not be executed for certain branch outcomes.  Both
instructions that annul if the branch is true and instructions that
annul if the branch is false are supported.
  
Delay slot scheduling differs from instruction scheduling in that
determining whether an instruction needs a delay slot is dependent only
on the type of instruction being generated, not on data flow between the
instructions.  See the next section for a discussion of data-dependent
instruction scheduling.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX817"></A>
The requirement of an insn needing one or more delay slots is indicated
via the <CODE>define_delay</CODE> expression.  It has the following form:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_delay <VAR>test</VAR>
              [<VAR>delay-1</VAR> <VAR>annul-true-1</VAR> <VAR>annul-false-1</VAR>
               <VAR>delay-2</VAR> <VAR>annul-true-2</VAR> <VAR>annul-false-2</VAR>
               <small>...</small>])
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<VAR>test</VAR> is an attribute test that indicates whether this
<CODE>define_delay</CODE> applies to a particular insn.  If so, the number of
required delay slots is determined by the length of the vector specified
as the second argument.  An insn placed in delay slot <VAR>n</VAR> must
satisfy attribute test <VAR>delay-n</VAR>.  <VAR>annul-true-n</VAR> is an
attribute test that specifies which insns may be annulled if the branch
is true.  Similarly, <VAR>annul-false-n</VAR> specifies which insns in the
delay slot may be annulled if the branch is false.  If annulling is not
supported for that delay slot, <CODE>(nil)</CODE> should be coded.</P><P>

For example, in the common case where branch and call insns require
a single delay slot, which may contain any insn other than a branch or
call, the following would be placed in the <TT>`md'</TT> file:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_delay (eq_attr "type" "branch,call")
              [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)])
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Multiple <CODE>define_delay</CODE> expressions may be specified.  In this
case, each such expression specifies different delay slot requirements
and there must be no insn for which tests in two <CODE>define_delay</CODE>
expressions are both true.
</P><P>

For example, if we have a machine that requires one delay slot for branches
but two for calls,  no delay slot can contain a branch or call insn,
and any valid insn in the delay slot for the branch can be annulled if the
branch is true, we might represent this as follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_delay (eq_attr "type" "branch")
   [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil)])

(define_delay (eq_attr "type" "call")
              [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)
               (eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)])

<H3> 13.15.8 Specifying Function Units </H3>
<!--docid::SEC148::-->
<P>

On most RISC machines, there are instructions whose results are not
available for a specific number of cycles.  Common cases are instructions
that load data from memory.  On many machines, a pipeline stall will result
if the data is referenced too soon after the load instruction.
</P><P>

In addition, many newer microprocessors have multiple function units, usually
one for integer and one for floating point, and often will incur pipeline
stalls when a result that is needed is not yet ready.
</P><P>

The descriptions in this section allow the specification of how much
time must elapse between the execution of an instruction and the time
when its result is used.  It also allows specification of when the
execution of an instruction will delay execution of similar instructions
due to function unit conflicts.
</P><P>

For the purposes of the specifications in this section, a machine is
divided into <EM>function units</EM>, each of which execute a specific
class of instructions in first-in-first-out order.  Function units that
accept one instruction each cycle and allow a result to be used in the
succeeding instruction (usually via forwarding) need not be specified.
Classic RISC microprocessors will normally have a single function unit,
which we can call <SAMP>`memory'</SAMP>.  The newer "superscalar" processors
will often have function units for floating point operations, usually at
least a floating point adder and multiplier.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX818"></A>
Each usage of a function units by a class of insns is specified with a
<CODE>define_function_unit</CODE> expression, which looks like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_function_unit <VAR>name</VAR> <VAR>multiplicity</VAR> <VAR>simultaneity</VAR>
                      <VAR>test</VAR> <VAR>ready-delay</VAR> <VAR>issue-delay</VAR>
                     [<VAR>conflict-list</VAR>])
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<VAR>name</VAR> is a string giving the name of the function unit.
</P><P>

<VAR>multiplicity</VAR> is an integer specifying the number of identical
units in the processor.  If more than one unit is specified, they will
be scheduled independently.  Only truly independent units should be
counted; a pipelined unit should be specified as a single unit.  (The
only common example of a machine that has multiple function units for a
single instruction class that are truly independent and not pipelined
are the two multiply and two increment units of the CDC 6600.)
</P><P>

<VAR>simultaneity</VAR> specifies the maximum number of insns that can be
executing in each instance of the function unit simultaneously or zero
if the unit is pipelined and has no limit.
</P><P>

All <CODE>define_function_unit</CODE> definitions referring to function unit
<VAR>name</VAR> must have the same name and values for <VAR>multiplicity</VAR> and
<VAR>simultaneity</VAR>.
</P><P>

<VAR>test</VAR> is an attribute test that selects the insns we are describing
in this definition.  Note that an insn may use more than one function
unit and a function unit may be specified in more than one
<CODE>define_function_unit</CODE>.
</P><P>

<VAR>ready-delay</VAR> is an integer that specifies the number of cycles
after which the result of the instruction can be used without
introducing any stalls.
</P><P>

<VAR>issue-delay</VAR> is an integer that specifies the number of cycles
after the instruction matching the <VAR>test</VAR> expression begins using
this unit until a subsequent instruction can begin.  A cost of <VAR>N</VAR>
indicates an <VAR>N-1</VAR> cycle delay.  A subsequent instruction may also
be delayed if an earlier instruction has a longer <VAR>ready-delay</VAR>
value.  This blocking effect is computed using the <VAR>simultaneity</VAR>,
<VAR>ready-delay</VAR>, <VAR>issue-delay</VAR>, and <VAR>conflict-list</VAR> terms.
For a normal non-pipelined function unit, <VAR>simultaneity</VAR> is one, the
unit is taken to block for the <VAR>ready-delay</VAR> cycles of the executing
insn, and smaller values of <VAR>issue-delay</VAR> are ignored.
</P><P>

<VAR>conflict-list</VAR> is an optional list giving detailed conflict costs
for this unit.  If specified, it is a list of condition test expressions
to be applied to insns chosen to execute in <VAR>name</VAR> following the
particular insn matching <VAR>test</VAR> that is already executing in
<VAR>name</VAR>.  For each insn in the list, <VAR>issue-delay</VAR> specifies the
conflict cost; for insns not in the list, the cost is zero.  If not
specified, <VAR>conflict-list</VAR> defaults to all instructions that use the
function unit.
</P><P>

Typical uses of this vector are where a floating point function unit can
pipeline either single- or double-precision operations, but not both, or
where a memory unit can pipeline loads, but not stores, etc.
</P><P>

As an example, consider a classic RISC machine where the result of a
load instruction is not available for two cycles (a single "delay"
instruction is required) and where only one load instruction can be executed
simultaneously.  This would be specified as:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_function_unit "memory" 1 1 (eq_attr "type" "load") 2 0)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

For the case of a floating point function unit that can pipeline either
single or double precision, but not both, the following could be specified:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(define_function_unit
   "fp" 1 0 (eq_attr "type" "sp_fp") 4 4 [(eq_attr "type" "dp_fp")])
(define_function_unit
   "fp" 1 0 (eq_attr "type" "dp_fp") 4 4 [(eq_attr "type" "sp_fp")])
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> The scheduler attempts to avoid function unit conflicts
and uses all the specifications in the <CODE>define_function_unit</CODE>
expression.  It has recently come to our attention that these
specifications may not allow modeling of some of the newer
"superscalar" processors that have insns using multiple pipelined
units.  These insns will cause a potential conflict for the second unit
used during their execution and there is no way of representing that
conflict.  We welcome any examples of how function unit conflicts work
in such processors and suggestions for their representation.

<SAMP>`-lgcc'</SAMP> to tell the linker to do the search.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX833"></A>
<DT><CODE>RELATIVE_PREFIX_NOT_LINKDIR</CODE>

<DT><CODE>MD_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>
<DD>If defined, this macro is an additional prefix to try after
<CODE>STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>.  <CODE>MD_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE> is not searched
when the <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> option is used, or the compiler is built as a cross
compiler.

<P>

<A NAME="IDX837"></A>
<DT><CODE>MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX</CODE>
<DD>If defined, this macro supplies an additional prefix to try after the

<A NAME="IDX839"></A>
<DT><CODE>LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override the
standard choice of <TT>`/usr/local/include'</TT> as the default prefix to
try when searching for local header files.  <CODE>LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>
comes before <CODE>SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE> in the search order.
<P>

Cross compilers do not use this macro and do not search either
<TT>`/usr/local/include'</TT> or its replacement.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX840"></A>
<DT><CODE>SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to specify a
system-specific directory to search for header files before the standard
directory.  <CODE>SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE> comes before
<CODE>STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE> in the search order.
<P>

Cross compilers do not use this macro and do not search the directory
specified.

<A NAME="IDX841"></A>
<DT><CODE>STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override the
standard choice of <TT>`/usr/include'</TT> as the default prefix to
try when searching for header files.
<P>

Cross compilers do not use this macro and do not search either
<TT>`/usr/include'</TT> or its replacement.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX842"></A>
<DT><CODE>INCLUDE_DEFAULTS</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if you wish to override the entire default search path
for include files.  The default search path includes
<CODE>GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>, <CODE>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>,
<CODE>LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>, <CODE>SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>, and
<CODE>STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>.  In addition, the macros
<CODE>GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE> and <CODE>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE> are defined
automatically by <TT>`Makefile'</TT>, and specify private search areas for
GCC.  The directory <CODE>GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE> is used only for C++
programs.
<P>

The definition should be an initializer for an array of structures.
Each array element should have two elements: the directory name (a
string constant) and a flag for C++-only directories.  Mark the end of
the array with a null element.  For example, here is the definition used
for VMS:
</P><P>

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX843"></A>
<DT><CODE>CPP_PREDEFINES</CODE>
<DD>Define this to be a string constant containing <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> options to
define the predefined macros that identify this machine and system.
These macros will be predefined unless the <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> option is
specified.
<P>

In addition, a parallel set of macros are predefined, whose names are
made by appending <SAMP>`__'</SAMP> at the beginning and at the end.  These
<SAMP>`__'</SAMP> macros are permitted by the ANSI standard, so they are
predefined regardless of whether <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> is specified.
</P><P>

For example, on the Sun, one can use the following value:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>"-Dmc68000 -Dsun -Dunix"
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The result is to define the macros <CODE>__mc68000__</CODE>, <CODE>__sun__</CODE>
and <CODE>__unix__</CODE> unconditionally, and the macros <CODE>mc68000</CODE>,
<CODE>sun</CODE> and <CODE>unix</CODE> provided <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> is not specified.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX844"></A>
<DT><CODE>STDC_VALUE</CODE>
<DD>Define the value to be assigned to the built-in macro <CODE>__STDC__</CODE>.
The default is the value <SAMP>`1'</SAMP>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX845"></A>
<DT><CODE>extern int target_flags;</CODE>
<DD>This declaration should be present.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX846"></A>
<A NAME="IDX847"></A>
<DT><CODE>TARGET_<small>...</small></CODE>
<DD>This series of macros is to allow compiler command arguments to
enable or disable the use of optional features of the target machine.
For example, one machine description serves both the 68000 and
the 68020; a command argument tells the compiler whether it should
use 68020-only instructions or not.  This command argument works
by means of a macro <CODE>TARGET_68020</CODE> that tests a bit in
<CODE>target_flags</CODE>.
<P>

Define a macro <CODE>TARGET_<VAR>featurename</VAR></CODE> for each such option.
Its definition should test a bit in <CODE>target_flags</CODE>; for example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define TARGET_68020 (target_flags &#38; 1)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

One place where these macros are used is in the condition-expressions
of instruction patterns.  Note how <CODE>TARGET_68020</CODE> appears
frequently in the 68000 machine description file, <TT>`m68k.md'</TT>.
Another place they are used is in the definitions of the other
macros in the <TT>`<VAR>machine</VAR>.h'</TT> file.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX848"></A>
<DT><CODE>TARGET_SWITCHES</CODE>
<DD>This macro defines names of command options to set and clear
bits in <CODE>target_flags</CODE>.  Its definition is an initializer
with a subgrouping for each command option.
<P>

Each subgrouping contains a string constant, that defines the option
name, and a number, which contains the bits to set in
<CODE>target_flags</CODE>.  A negative number says to clear bits instead;
the negative of the number is which bits to clear.  The actual option
name is made by appending <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> to the specified name.
</P><P>

One of the subgroupings should have a null string.  The number in
this grouping is the default value for <CODE>target_flags</CODE>.  Any
target options act starting with that value.
</P><P>

Here is an example which defines <SAMP>`-m68000'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-m68020'</SAMP>
with opposite meanings, and picks the latter as the default:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define TARGET_SWITCHES \
  { { "68020", 1},      \
    { "68000", -1},     \
    { "", 1}}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX849"></A>
<DT><CODE>TARGET_OPTIONS</CODE>
<DD>This macro is similar to <CODE>TARGET_SWITCHES</CODE> but defines names of command
options that have values.  Its definition is an initializer with a
subgrouping for each command option. 
<P>

Each subgrouping contains a string constant, that defines the fixed part
of the option name, and the address of a variable.  The variable, type
<CODE>char *</CODE>, is set to the variable part of the given option if the fixed
part matches.  The actual option name is made by appending <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> to the
specified name. 
</P><P>

Here is an example which defines <SAMP>`-mshort-data-<VAR>number</VAR>'</SAMP>.  If the
given option is <SAMP>`-mshort-data-512'</SAMP>, the variable <CODE>m88k_short_data</CODE>
will be set to the string <CODE>"512"</CODE>. 
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>extern char *m88k_short_data;
#define TARGET_OPTIONS { { "short-data-", &#38;m88k_short_data } }
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX850"></A>
<DT><CODE>TARGET_VERSION</CODE>
<DD>This macro is a C statement to print on <CODE>stderr</CODE> a string
describing the particular machine description choice.  Every machine
description should define <CODE>TARGET_VERSION</CODE>.  For example:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#ifdef MOTOROLA

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX853"></A>
<DT><CODE>BITS_BIG_ENDIAN</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro to be the value 1 if the most significant bit in a
byte has the lowest number; otherwise define it to be the value zero.
This means that bit-field instructions count from the most significant
bit.  If the machine has no bit-field instructions, this macro is
irrelevant.
<P>

This macro does not affect the way structure fields are packed into
bytes or words; that is controlled by <CODE>BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX854"></A>
<DT><CODE>BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro to be 1 if the most significant byte in a word has the
lowest number.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX855"></A>
<DT><CODE>WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro to be 1 if, in a multiword object, the most
significant word has the lowest number.  This applies to both memory
locations and registers; GNU CC fundamentally assumes that the order of
words in memory is the same as the order in registers.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX856"></A>
<DT><CODE>BITS_PER_UNIT</CODE>
<DD>Number of bits in an addressable storage unit (byte); normally 8.

<A NAME="IDX857"></A>
<DT><CODE>BITS_PER_WORD</CODE>
<DD>Number of bits in a word; normally 32.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX858"></A>
<DT><CODE>MAX_BITS_PER_WORD</CODE>
<DD>Maximum number of bits in a word.  If this is undefined, the default is
<CODE>BITS_PER_WORD</CODE>.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
largest value that <CODE>BITS_PER_WORD</CODE> can have at run-time.

<DT><CODE>PROMOTE_MODE (<VAR>m</VAR>, <VAR>unsignedp</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A macro to update <VAR>m</VAR> and <VAR>unsignedp</VAR> when an object whose type
is <VAR>type</VAR> and which has the specified mode and signedness is to be
stored in a register.  This macro is only called when <VAR>type</VAR> is a
scalar type.
<P>

On most RISC machines, which only have operations that operate on a full
register, define this macro to set <VAR>m</VAR> to <CODE>word_mode</CODE> if
<VAR>m</VAR> is an integer mode narrower than <CODE>BITS_PER_WORD</CODE>.  In most
cases, only integer modes should be widened because wider-precision
floating-point operations are usually more expensive than their narrower
counterparts.
</P><P>

For most machines, the macro definition does not change <VAR>unsignedp</VAR>.
However, some machines, have instructions that preferentially handle
either signed or unsigned quanities of certain modes.  For example, on
the DEC Alpha, 32-bit loads from memory and 32-bit add instructions
sign-extend the result to 64 bits.  On such machines, set
<VAR>unsignedp</VAR> according to which kind of extension is more efficient.
</P><P>

Do not define this macro if it would never modify <VAR>m</VAR>.

<A NAME="IDX862"></A>
<DT><CODE>PROMOTE_FUNCTION_ARGS</CODE>

<DT><CODE>PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if the promotion described by <CODE>PROMOTE_MODE</CODE>
should also be done for the return value of functions.

If this macro is defined, <CODE>FUNCTION_VALUE</CODE> must perform the same
promotions done by <CODE>PROMOTE_MODE</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX864"></A>
<DT><CODE>PARM_BOUNDARY</CODE>
<DD>Normal alignment required for function parameters on the stack, in
bits.  All stack parameters receive at least this much alignment
regardless of data type.  On most machines, this is the same as the
size of an integer.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX865"></A>
<DT><CODE>STACK_BOUNDARY</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if you wish to preserve a certain alignment for
the stack pointer.  The definition is a C expression
for the desired alignment (measured in bits).
<P>

<A NAME="IDX866"></A>
If <CODE>PUSH_ROUNDING</CODE> is not defined, the stack will always be aligned
to the specified boundary.  If <CODE>PUSH_ROUNDING</CODE> is defined and specifies a
less strict alignment than <CODE>STACK_BOUNDARY</CODE>, the stack may be
momentarily unaligned while pushing arguments.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_BOUNDARY</CODE>
<DD>Alignment required for a function entry point, in bits.

<A NAME="IDX868"></A>
<DT><CODE>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</CODE>
<DD>Biggest alignment that any data type can require on this machine, in bits.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX869"></A>
<DT><CODE>BIGGEST_FIELD_ALIGNMENT</CODE>
<DD>Biggest alignment that any structure field can require on this machine,
in bits.  If defined, this overrides <CODE>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</CODE> for
structure fields only.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX870"></A>
<DT><CODE>MAX_OFILE_ALIGNMENT</CODE>
<DD>Biggest alignment supported by the object file format of this machine.
Use this macro to limit the alignment which can be specified using the
<CODE>__attribute__ ((aligned (<VAR>n</VAR>)))</CODE> construct.  If not defined,
the default value is <CODE>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX871"></A>
<DT><CODE>DATA_ALIGNMENT (<VAR>type</VAR>, <VAR>basic-align</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment for a static
variable.  <VAR>type</VAR> is the data type, and <VAR>basic-align</VAR> is the
alignment that the object would ordinarily have.  The value of this
macro is used instead of that alignment to align the object.
<P>

If this macro is not defined, then <VAR>basic-align</VAR> is used.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX872"></A>
One use of this macro is to increase alignment of medium-size data to
make it all fit in fewer cache lines.  Another is to cause character
arrays to be word-aligned so that <CODE>strcpy</CODE> calls that copy
constants to character arrays can be done inline.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX873"></A>
<DT><CODE>CONSTANT_ALIGNMENT (<VAR>constant</VAR>, <VAR>basic-align</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment given to a constant
that is being placed in memory.  <VAR>constant</VAR> is the constant and
<VAR>basic-align</VAR> is the alignment that the object would ordinarily
have.  The value of this macro is used instead of that alignment to
align the object.
<P>

If this macro is not defined, then <VAR>basic-align</VAR> is used.
</P><P>

The typical use of this macro is to increase alignment for string
constants to be word aligned so that <CODE>strcpy</CODE> calls that copy
constants can be done inline.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX874"></A>
<DT><CODE>EMPTY_FIELD_BOUNDARY</CODE>
<DD>Alignment in bits to be given to a structure bit field that follows an
empty field such as <CODE>int : 0;</CODE>.
<P>

Note that <CODE>PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS</CODE> also affects the alignment
that results from an empty field.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX875"></A>
<DT><CODE>STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY</CODE>
<DD>Number of bits which any structure or union's size must be a multiple of.
Each structure or union's size is rounded up to a multiple of this.
<P>

If you do not define this macro, the default is the same as
<CODE>BITS_PER_UNIT</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX876"></A>
<DT><CODE>STRICT_ALIGNMENT</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro to be the value 1 if instructions will fail to work
if given data not on the nominal alignment.  If instructions will merely
go slower in that case, define this macro as 0.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX877"></A>
<DT><CODE>PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS</CODE>
<DD>Define this if you wish to imitate the way many other C compilers handle
alignment of bitfields and the structures that contain them.
<P>

The behavior is that the type written for a bitfield (<CODE>int</CODE>,
<CODE>short</CODE>, or other integer type) imposes an alignment for the
entire structure, as if the structure really did contain an ordinary
field of that type.  In addition, the bitfield is placed within the
structure so that it would fit within such a field, not crossing a
boundary for it.
</P><P>

Thus, on most machines, a bitfield whose type is written as <CODE>int</CODE>
would not cross a four-byte boundary, and would force four-byte
alignment for the whole structure.  (The alignment used may not be four
bytes; it is controlled by the other alignment parameters.)
</P><P>

If the macro is defined, its definition should be a C expression;
a nonzero value for the expression enables this behavior.
</P><P>

Note that if this macro is not defined, or its value is zero, some
bitfields may cross more than one alignment boundary.  The compiler can
support such references if there are <SAMP>`insv'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`extv'</SAMP>, and
<SAMP>`extzv'</SAMP> insns that can directly reference memory.
</P><P>

The other known way of making bitfields work is to define
<CODE>STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY</CODE> as large as <CODE>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</CODE>.
Then every structure can be accessed with fullwords.
</P><P>

Unless the machine has bitfield instructions or you define
<CODE>STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY</CODE> that way, you must define
<CODE>PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS</CODE> to have a nonzero value.
</P><P>

If your aim is to make GNU CC use the same conventions for laying out
bitfields as are used by another compiler, here is how to investigate
what the other compiler does.  Compile and run this program:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>struct foo1
{
  char x;
  char :0;
  char y;
};

struct foo2
{
  char x;
  int :0;
  char y;
};

main ()
{
  printf ("Size of foo1 is %d\n", sizeof (struct foo1));
  printf ("Size of foo2 is %d\n", sizeof (struct foo2));
  exit (0);
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

If this prints 2 and 5, then the compiler's behavior is what you would
get from <CODE>PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX878"></A>
<DT><CODE>BITFIELD_NBYTES_LIMITED</CODE>
<DD>Like PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS except that its effect is limited to
aligning a bitfield within the structure.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX879"></A>
<DT><CODE>ROUND_TYPE_SIZE (<VAR>struct</VAR>, <VAR>size</VAR>, <VAR>align</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro as an expression for the overall size of a structure 
(given by <VAR>struct</VAR> as a tree node) when the size computed from the
fields is <VAR>size</VAR> and the alignment is <VAR>align</VAR>.
<P>

The default is to round <VAR>size</VAR> up to a multiple of <VAR>align</VAR>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX880"></A>
<DT><CODE>ROUND_TYPE_ALIGN (<VAR>struct</VAR>, <VAR>computed</VAR>, <VAR>specified</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro as an expression for the alignment of a structure 
(given by <VAR>struct</VAR> as a tree node) if the alignment computed in the
usual way is <VAR>computed</VAR> and the alignment explicitly specified was
<VAR>specified</VAR>.
<P>

The default is to use <VAR>specified</VAR> if it is larger; otherwise, use
the smaller of <VAR>computed</VAR> and <CODE>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</CODE>
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX881"></A>
<DT><CODE>MAX_FIXED_MODE_SIZE</CODE>
<DD>An integer expression for the size in bits of the largest integer
machine mode that should actually be used.  All integer machine modes of
this size or smaller can be used for structures and unions with the
appropriate sizes.  If this macro is undefined, <CODE>GET_MODE_BITSIZE
(DImode)</CODE> is assumed.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX882"></A>
<DT><CODE>CHECK_FLOAT_VALUE (<VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>value</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C statement to validate the value <VAR>value</VAR> (of type
<CODE>double</CODE>) for mode <VAR>mode</VAR>.  This means that you check whether
<VAR>value</VAR> fits within the possible range of values for mode
<VAR>mode</VAR> on this target machine.  The mode <VAR>mode</VAR> is always
<CODE>SFmode</CODE> or <CODE>DFmode</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX883"></A>
If <VAR>value</VAR> is not valid, you should call <CODE>error</CODE> to print an
error message and then assign some valid value to <VAR>value</VAR>.
Allowing an invalid value to go through the compiler can produce
incorrect assembler code which may even cause Unix assemblers to
crash.
</P><P>

This macro need not be defined if there is no work for it to do.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX884"></A>
<DT><CODE>TARGET_FLOAT_FORMAT</CODE>
<DD>A code distinguishing the floating point format of the target machine.
There are three defined values:
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX885"></A>
<DT><CODE>IEEE_FLOAT_FORMAT</CODE>
<DD>This code indicates IEEE floating point.  It is the default; there is no
need to define this macro when the format is IEEE.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX886"></A>
<DT><CODE>VAX_FLOAT_FORMAT</CODE>
<DD>This code indicates the peculiar format used on the Vax.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX887"></A>
<DT><CODE>UNKNOWN_FLOAT_FORMAT</CODE>
<DD>This code indicates any other format.
</DL>
<P>

The value of this macro is compared with <CODE>HOST_FLOAT_FORMAT</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC199">15. The Configuration File</A>) to determine whether the target machine has the same
format as the host machine.  If any other formats are actually in use on
supported machines, new codes should be defined for them.

<DT><CODE>FIXED_REGISTERS</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX912"></A>
<A NAME="IDX913"></A>
An initializer that says which registers are used for fixed purposes
all throughout the compiled code and are therefore not available for
general allocation.  These would include the stack pointer, the frame
pointer (except on machines where that can be used as a general
register when no frame pointer is needed), the program counter on
machines where that is considered one of the addressable registers,
and any other numbered register with a standard use.

This information is expressed as a sequence of numbers, separated by
commas and surrounded by braces.  The <VAR>n</VAR>th number is 1 if

Like <CODE>FIXED_REGISTERS</CODE> but has 1 for each register that is
clobbered (in general) by function calls as well as for fixed
registers.  This macro therefore identifies the registers that are not
available for general allocation of values that must live across
function calls.

If a register has 0 in <CODE>CALL_USED_REGISTERS</CODE>, the compiler

If the usage of an entire class of registers depends on the target

<CODE>fixed_regs</CODE> and <CODE>call_used_regs</CODE> to 1 for each of the
registers in the classes which should not be used by GCC.  Also define
the macro <CODE>REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER</CODE> to return <CODE>NO_REGS</CODE> if it
is called with a letter for a class that shouldn't be used.
</P><P>

(However, if this class is not included in <CODE>GENERAL_REGS</CODE> and all
of the insn patterns whose constraints permit this class are
controlled by target switches, then GCC will automatically avoid using
these registers when the target switches are opposed to them.)

<DT><CODE>NON_SAVING_SETJMP</CODE>
<DD>If this macro is defined and has a nonzero value, it means that

<H3> 14.5.3 How Values Fit in Registers </H3>
<!--docid::SEC157::-->
<P>

This section discusses the macros that describe which kinds of values
(specifically, which machine modes) each register can hold, and how many
consecutive registers are needed for a given mode.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX926"></A>
<DT><CODE>HARD_REGNO_NREGS (<VAR>regno</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression for the number of consecutive hard registers, starting
at register number <VAR>regno</VAR>, required to hold a value of mode
<VAR>mode</VAR>.
<P>

On a machine where all registers are exactly one word, a suitable
definition of this macro is
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define HARD_REGNO_NREGS(REGNO, MODE)            \
   ((GET_MODE_SIZE (MODE) + UNITS_PER_WORD - 1)  \
    / UNITS_PER_WORD))
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX927"></A>
<DT><CODE>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (<VAR>regno</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression that is nonzero if it is permissible to store a value
of mode <VAR>mode</VAR> in hard register number <VAR>regno</VAR> (or in several
registers starting with that one).  For a machine where all registers
are equivalent, a suitable definition is
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK(REGNO, MODE) 1
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

It is not necessary for this macro to check for the numbers of fixed
registers, because the allocation mechanism considers them to be always
occupied.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX928"></A>
On some machines, double-precision values must be kept in even/odd
register pairs.  The way to implement that is to define this macro
to reject odd register numbers for such modes.
</P><P>

The minimum requirement for a mode to be OK in a register is that the
<SAMP>`mov<VAR>mode</VAR>'</SAMP> instruction pattern support moves between the
register and any other hard register for which the mode is OK; and that
moving a value into the register and back out not alter it.
</P><P>

Since the same instruction used to move <CODE>SImode</CODE> will work for all
narrower integer modes, it is not necessary on any machine for
<CODE>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</CODE> to distinguish between these modes, provided
you define patterns <SAMP>`movhi'</SAMP>, etc., to take advantage of this.  This
is useful because of the interaction between <CODE>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</CODE>
and <CODE>MODES_TIEABLE_P</CODE>; it is very desirable for all integer modes
to be tieable.
</P><P>

Many machines have special registers for floating point arithmetic.
Often people assume that floating point machine modes are allowed only
in floating point registers.  This is not true.  Any registers that
can hold integers can safely <EM>hold</EM> a floating point machine
mode, whether or not floating arithmetic can be done on it in those
registers.  Integer move instructions can be used to move the values.
</P><P>

On some machines, though, the converse is true: fixed-point machine
modes may not go in floating registers.  This is true if the floating
registers normalize any value stored in them, because storing a
non-floating value there would garble it.  In this case,
<CODE>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</CODE> should reject fixed-point machine modes in
floating registers.  But if the floating registers do not automatically
normalize, if you can store any bit pattern in one and retrieve it
unchanged without a trap, then any machine mode may go in a floating
register, so you can define this macro to say so.
</P><P>

On some machines, such as the Sparc and the Mips, we get better code
by defining <CODE>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</CODE> to forbid integers in floating
registers, even though the hardware is capable of handling them.  This
is because transferring values between floating registers and general
registers is so slow that it is better to keep the integer in memory.
</P><P>

The primary significance of special floating registers is rather that
they are the registers acceptable in floating point arithmetic
instructions.  However, this is of no concern to
<CODE>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</CODE>.  You handle it by writing the proper
constraints for those instructions.
</P><P>

On some machines, the floating registers are especially slow to access,
so that it is better to store a value in a stack frame than in such a
register if floating point arithmetic is not being done.  As long as the
floating registers are not in class <CODE>GENERAL_REGS</CODE>, they will not
be used unless some pattern's constraint asks for one.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX929"></A>
<DT><CODE>MODES_TIEABLE_P (<VAR>mode1</VAR>, <VAR>mode2</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression that is nonzero if it is desirable to choose register
allocation so as to avoid move instructions between a value of mode
<VAR>mode1</VAR> and a value of mode <VAR>mode2</VAR>.
<P>

If <CODE>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (<VAR>r</VAR>, <VAR>mode1</VAR>)</CODE> and
<CODE>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (<VAR>r</VAR>, <VAR>mode2</VAR>)</CODE> are ever different
for any <VAR>r</VAR>, then <CODE>MODES_TIEABLE_P (<VAR>mode1</VAR>,

<H3> 14.5.4 Handling Leaf Functions </H3>
<!--docid::SEC158::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX930"></A>
<A NAME="IDX931"></A>
On some machines, a leaf function (i.e., one which makes no calls) can run
more efficiently if it does not make its own register window.  Often this
means it is required to receive its arguments in the registers where they
are passed by the caller, instead of the registers where they would
normally arrive.
</P><P>

The special treatment for leaf functions generally applies only when
other conditions are met; for example, often they may use only those
registers for its own variables and temporaries.  We use the term "leaf
function" to mean a function that is suitable for this special
handling, so that functions with no calls are not necessarily "leaf
functions".
</P><P>

GNU CC assigns register numbers before it knows whether the function is
suitable for leaf function treatment.  So it needs to renumber the
registers in order to output a leaf function.  The following macros
accomplish this.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX932"></A>
<DT><CODE>LEAF_REGISTERS</CODE>
<DD>A C initializer for a vector, indexed by hard register number, which
contains 1 for a register that is allowable in a candidate for leaf
function treatment.
<P>

If leaf function treatment involves renumbering the registers, then the
registers marked here should be the ones before renumbering--those that
GNU CC would ordinarily allocate.  The registers which will actually be
used in the assembler code, after renumbering, should not be marked with 1
in this vector.
</P><P>

Define this macro only if the target machine offers a way to optimize
the treatment of leaf functions.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX933"></A>
<DT><CODE>LEAF_REG_REMAP (<VAR>regno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression whose value is the register number to which <VAR>regno</VAR>
should be renumbered, when a function is treated as a leaf function.
<P>

If <VAR>regno</VAR> is a register number which should not appear in a leaf
function before renumbering, then the expression should yield -1, which
will cause the compiler to abort.
</P><P>

Define this macro only if the target machine offers a way to optimize the
treatment of leaf functions, and registers need to be renumbered to do
this.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX934"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_LEAF_ALLOC_ORDER</CODE>
<DD>If defined, an initializer for a vector of integers, containing the
numbers of hard registers in the order in which the GNU CC should prefer
to use them (from most preferred to least) in a leaf function.  If this
macro is not defined, REG_ALLOC_ORDER is used for both non-leaf and
leaf-functions.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="IDX935"></A>
Normally, it is necessary for <CODE>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</CODE> and
<CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE> to treat leaf functions specially.  It can test

<P>

These features do not work very well.  They exist because they used to
be required to generate correct code for the 80387 coprocessor of the
80386.  They are no longer used by that machine description and may be
removed in a later version of the compiler.  Don't use them!
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX939"></A>
<DT><CODE>OVERLAPPING_REGNO_P (<VAR>regno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>If defined, this is a C expression whose value is nonzero if hard
register number <VAR>regno</VAR> is an overlapping register.  This means a
hard register which overlaps a hard register with a different number.
(Such overlap is undesirable, but occasionally it allows a machine to
be supported which otherwise could not be.)  This macro must return
nonzero for <EM>all</EM> the registers which overlap each other.  GNU CC
can use an overlapping register only in certain limited ways.  It can
be used for allocation within a basic block, and may be spilled for
reloading; that is all.
<P>

If this macro is not defined, it means that none of the hard registers
overlap each other.  This is the usual situation.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX940"></A>
<DT><CODE>INSN_CLOBBERS_REGNO_P (<VAR>insn</VAR>, <VAR>regno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>If defined, this is a C expression whose value should be nonzero if
the insn <VAR>insn</VAR> has the effect of mysteriously clobbering the
contents of hard register number <VAR>regno</VAR>.  By "mysterious" we
mean that the insn's RTL expression doesn't describe such an effect.
<P>

If this macro is not defined, it means that no insn clobbers registers
mysteriously.  This is the usual situation; all else being equal,
it is best for the RTL expression to show all the activity.

<A NAME="IDX941"></A>
<A NAME="IDX942"></A>
<DT><CODE>PRESERVE_DEATH_INFO_REGNO_P (<VAR>regno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>If defined, this is a C expression whose value is nonzero if accurate
<CODE>REG_DEAD</CODE> notes are needed for hard register number <VAR>regno</VAR>
at the time of outputting the assembler code.  When this is so, a few
optimizations that take place after register allocation and could
invalidate the death notes are not done when this register is
involved.
<P>

You would arrange to preserve death info for a register when some of the
code in the machine description which is executed to write the assembler
code looks at the death notes.  This is necessary only when the actual
hardware feature which GNU CC thinks of as a register is not actually a
register of the usual sort.  (It might, for example, be a hardware
stack.)
</P><P>

If this macro is not defined, it means that no death notes need to be
preserved.  This is the usual situation.

<H2> 14.6 Register Classes </H2>
<!--docid::SEC161::-->
<P>

On many machines, the numbered registers are not all equivalent.
For example, certain registers may not be allowed for indexed addressing;
certain registers may not be allowed in some instructions.  These machine
restrictions are described to the compiler using <EM>register classes</EM>.
</P><P>

You define a number of register classes, giving each one a name and saying
which of the registers belong to it.  Then you can specify register classes
that are allowed as operands to particular instruction patterns.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX943"></A>
<A NAME="IDX944"></A>
In general, each register will belong to several classes.  In fact, one
class must be named <CODE>ALL_REGS</CODE> and contain all the registers.  Another
class must be named <CODE>NO_REGS</CODE> and contain no registers.  Often the
union of two classes will be another class; however, this is not required.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX945"></A>
One of the classes must be named <CODE>GENERAL_REGS</CODE>.  There is nothing
terribly special about the name, but the operand constraint letters
<SAMP>`r'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`g'</SAMP> specify this class.  If <CODE>GENERAL_REGS</CODE> is
the same as <CODE>ALL_REGS</CODE>, just define it as a macro which expands
to <CODE>ALL_REGS</CODE>.
</P><P>

Order the classes so that if class <VAR>x</VAR> is contained in class <VAR>y</VAR>
then <VAR>x</VAR> has a lower class number than <VAR>y</VAR>.
</P><P>

The way classes other than <CODE>GENERAL_REGS</CODE> are specified in operand
constraints is through machine-dependent operand constraint letters.
You can define such letters to correspond to various classes, then use
them in operand constraints.
</P><P>

You should define a class for the union of two classes whenever some
instruction allows both classes.  For example, if an instruction allows
either a floating point (coprocessor) register or a general register for a
certain operand, you should define a class <CODE>FLOAT_OR_GENERAL_REGS</CODE>
which includes both of them.  Otherwise you will get suboptimal code.
</P><P>

You must also specify certain redundant information about the register
classes: for each class, which classes contain it and which ones are
contained in it; for each pair of classes, the largest class contained
in their union.
</P><P>

When a value occupying several consecutive registers is expected in a
certain class, all the registers used must belong to that class.
Therefore, register classes cannot be used to enforce a requirement for
a register pair to start with an even-numbered register.  The way to
specify this requirement is with <CODE>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</CODE>.
</P><P>

Register classes used for input-operands of bitwise-and or shift
instructions have a special requirement: each such class must have, for
each fixed-point machine mode, a subclass whose registers can transfer that
mode to or from memory.  For example, on some machines, the operations for
single-byte values (<CODE>QImode</CODE>) are limited to certain registers.  When
this is so, each register class that is used in a bitwise-and or shift
instruction must have a subclass consisting of registers from which
single-byte values can be loaded or stored.  This is so that
<CODE>PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS</CODE> can always have a possible value to return.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX946"></A>
<DT><CODE>enum reg_class</CODE>
<DD>An enumeral type that must be defined with all the register class names
as enumeral values.  <CODE>NO_REGS</CODE> must be first.  <CODE>ALL_REGS</CODE>
must be the last register class, followed by one more enumeral value,
<CODE>LIM_REG_CLASSES</CODE>, which is not a register class but rather
tells how many classes there are.
<P>

Each register class has a number, which is the value of casting
the class name to type <CODE>int</CODE>.  The number serves as an index
in many of the tables described below.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX947"></A>
<DT><CODE>N_REG_CLASSES</CODE>
<DD>The number of distinct register classes, defined as follows:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define N_REG_CLASSES (int) LIM_REG_CLASSES
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX948"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_CLASS_NAMES</CODE>
<DD>An initializer containing the names of the register classes as C string
constants.  These names are used in writing some of the debugging dumps.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX949"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_CLASS_CONTENTS</CODE>
<DD>An initializer containing the contents of the register classes, as integers
which are bit masks.  The <VAR>n</VAR>th integer specifies the contents of class
<VAR>n</VAR>.  The way the integer <VAR>mask</VAR> is interpreted is that
register <VAR>r</VAR> is in the class if <CODE><VAR>mask</VAR> &#38; (1 &#60;&#60; <VAR>r</VAR>)</CODE> is 1.
<P>

When the machine has more than 32 registers, an integer does not suffice.
Then the integers are replaced by sub-initializers, braced groupings containing
several integers.  Each sub-initializer must be suitable as an initializer
for the type <CODE>HARD_REG_SET</CODE> which is defined in <TT>`hard-reg-set.h'</TT>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX950"></A>
<DT><CODE>REGNO_REG_CLASS (<VAR>regno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression whose value is a register class containing hard register
<VAR>regno</VAR>.  In general there is more than one such class; choose a class
which is <EM>minimal</EM>, meaning that no smaller class also contains the
register.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX951"></A>
<DT><CODE>BASE_REG_CLASS</CODE>
<DD>A macro whose definition is the name of the class to which a valid
base register must belong.  A base register is one used in an address
which is the register value plus a displacement.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX952"></A>
<DT><CODE>INDEX_REG_CLASS</CODE>
<DD>A macro whose definition is the name of the class to which a valid
index register must belong.  An index register is one used in an
address where its value is either multiplied by a scale factor or
added to another register (as well as added to a displacement).
<P>

<A NAME="IDX953"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER (<VAR>char</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression which defines the machine-dependent operand constraint
letters for register classes.  If <VAR>char</VAR> is such a letter, the
value should be the register class corresponding to it.  Otherwise,
the value should be <CODE>NO_REGS</CODE>.  The register letter <SAMP>`r'</SAMP>,
corresponding to class <CODE>GENERAL_REGS</CODE>, will not be passed
to this macro; you do not need to handle it.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX954"></A>
<DT><CODE>REGNO_OK_FOR_BASE_P (<VAR>num</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression which is nonzero if register number <VAR>num</VAR> is
suitable for use as a base register in operand addresses.  It may be
either a suitable hard register or a pseudo register that has been
allocated such a hard register.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX955"></A>
<DT><CODE>REGNO_OK_FOR_INDEX_P (<VAR>num</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression which is nonzero if register number <VAR>num</VAR> is
suitable for use as an index register in operand addresses.  It may be
either a suitable hard register or a pseudo register that has been
allocated such a hard register.
<P>

The difference between an index register and a base register is that
the index register may be scaled.  If an address involves the sum of
two registers, neither one of them scaled, then either one may be
labeled the "base" and the other the "index"; but whichever
labeling is used must fit the machine's constraints of which registers
may serve in each capacity.  The compiler will try both labelings,
looking for one that is valid, and will reload one or both registers
only if neither labeling works.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX956"></A>
<DT><CODE>PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>class</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression that places additional restrictions on the register class
to use when it is necessary to copy value <VAR>x</VAR> into a register in class
<VAR>class</VAR>.  The value is a register class; perhaps <VAR>class</VAR>, or perhaps
another, smaller class.  On many machines, the definition
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS(X,CLASS) CLASS
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

is safe.
</P><P>

Sometimes returning a more restrictive class makes better code.  For
example, on the 68000, when <VAR>x</VAR> is an integer constant that is in range
for a <SAMP>`moveq'</SAMP> instruction, the value of this macro is always
<CODE>DATA_REGS</CODE> as long as <VAR>class</VAR> includes the data registers.
Requiring a data register guarantees that a <SAMP>`moveq'</SAMP> will be used.
</P><P>

If <VAR>x</VAR> is a <CODE>const_double</CODE>, by returning <CODE>NO_REGS</CODE>
you can force <VAR>x</VAR> into a memory constant.  This is useful on
certain machines where immediate floating values cannot be loaded into
certain kinds of registers.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX957"></A>
<DT><CODE>PREFERRED_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>class</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Like <CODE>PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS</CODE>, but for output reloads instead of
input reloads.  If you don't define this macro, the default is to use
<VAR>class</VAR>, unchanged.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX958"></A>
<DT><CODE>LIMIT_RELOAD_CLASS (<VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>class</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression that places additional restrictions on the register class
to use when it is necessary to be able to hold a value of mode
<VAR>mode</VAR> in a reload register for which class <VAR>class</VAR> would
ordinarily be used.
<P>

Unlike <CODE>PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS</CODE>, this macro should be used when
there are certain modes that simply can't go in certain reload classes.
</P><P>

The value is a register class; perhaps <VAR>class</VAR>, or perhaps another,
smaller class.
</P><P>

Don't define this macro unless the target machine has limitations which
require the macro to do something nontrivial.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX959"></A>
<A NAME="IDX960"></A>
<A NAME="IDX961"></A>
<DT><CODE>SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS (<VAR>class</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (<VAR>class</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (<VAR>class</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Many machines have some registers that cannot be copied directly to or
from memory or even from other types of registers.  An example is the
<SAMP>`MQ'</SAMP> register, which on most machines, can only be copied to or
from general registers, but not memory.  Some machines allow copying all
registers to and from memory, but require a scratch register for stores
to some memory locations (e.g., those with symbolic address on the RT,
and those with certain symbolic address on the Sparc when compiling
PIC).  In some cases, both an intermediate and a scratch register are
required.
<P>

You should define these macros to indicate to the reload phase that it may
need to allocate at least one register for a reload in addition to the
register to contain the data.  Specifically, if copying <VAR>x</VAR> to a
register <VAR>class</VAR> in <VAR>mode</VAR> requires an intermediate register,
you should define <CODE>SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS</CODE> to return the
largest register class all of whose registers can be used as
intermediate registers or scratch registers.
</P><P>

If copying a register <VAR>class</VAR> in <VAR>mode</VAR> to <VAR>x</VAR> requires an
intermediate or scratch register, you should define
<CODE>SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS</CODE> to return the largest register
class required.  If the requirements for input and output reloads are
the same, the macro <CODE>SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS</CODE> should be used instead
of defining both macros identically.
</P><P>

The values returned by these macros are often <CODE>GENERAL_REGS</CODE>.
Return <CODE>NO_REGS</CODE> if no spare register is needed; i.e., if <VAR>x</VAR>
can be directly copied to or from a register of <VAR>class</VAR> in
<VAR>mode</VAR> without requiring a scratch register.  Do not define this
macro if it would always return <CODE>NO_REGS</CODE>.
</P><P>

If a scratch register is required (either with or without an
intermediate register), you should define patterns for
<SAMP>`reload_in<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`reload_out<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP>, as required
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC132">13.7 Standard Names for Patterns Used in Generation</A>.  These patterns, which will normally be
implemented with a <CODE>define_expand</CODE>, should be similar to the
<SAMP>`mov<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP> patterns, except that operand 2 is the scratch
register. 
</P><P>

Define constraints for the reload register and scratch register that
contain a single register class.  If the original reload register (whose
class is <VAR>class</VAR>) can meet the constraint given in the pattern, the
value returned by these macros is used for the class of the scratch
register.  Otherwise, two additional reload registers are required.
Their classes are obtained from the constraints in the insn pattern.
</P><P>

<VAR>x</VAR> might be a pseudo-register or a <CODE>subreg</CODE> of a
pseudo-register, which could either be in a hard register or in memory.
Use <CODE>true_regnum</CODE> to find out; it will return -1 if the pseudo is
in memory and the hard register number if it is in a register.
</P><P>

These macros should not be used in the case where a particular class of
registers can only be copied to memory and not to another class of
registers.  In that case, secondary reload registers are not needed and
would not be helpful.  Instead, a stack location must be used to perform
the copy and the <CODE>mov<VAR>m</VAR></CODE> pattern should use memory as a
intermediate storage.  This case often occurs between floating-point and
general registers.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX962"></A>
<DT><CODE>SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED (<VAR>class1</VAR>, <VAR>class2</VAR>, <VAR>m</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Certain machines have the property that some registers cannot be copied
to some other registers without using memory.  Define this macro on
those machines to be a C expression that is non-zero if objects of mode
<VAR>m</VAR> in registers of <VAR>class1</VAR> can only be copied to registers of
class <VAR>class2</VAR> by storing a register of <VAR>class1</VAR> into memory
and loading that memory location into a register of <VAR>class2</VAR>.
<P>

Do not define this macro if its value would always be zero. 
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX963"></A>
<DT><CODE>SMALL_REGISTER_CLASSES</CODE>
<DD>Normally the compiler will avoid choosing spill registers from registers
that have been explicitly mentioned in the rtl (these registers are
normally those used to pass parameters and return values).  However,
some machines have so few registers of certain classes that there would
not be enough registers to use as spill registers if this were done.
<P>

On those machines, you should define <CODE>SMALL_REGISTER_CLASSES</CODE>.
When it is defined, the compiler allows registers explicitly used in the
rtl to be used as spill registers but prevents the compiler from
extending the lifetime of these registers.
</P><P>

Defining this macro is always safe, but unnecessarily defining this macro
will reduce the amount of optimizations that can be performed in some
cases.  If this macro is not defined but needs to be, the compiler will
run out of reload registers and print a fatal error message.
</P><P>

For most machines, this macro should not be defined.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX964"></A>
<DT><CODE>CLASS_MAX_NREGS (<VAR>class</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression for the maximum number of consecutive registers
of class <VAR>class</VAR> needed to hold a value of mode <VAR>mode</VAR>.
<P>

This is closely related to the macro <CODE>HARD_REGNO_NREGS</CODE>.
In fact, the value of the macro <CODE>CLASS_MAX_NREGS (<VAR>class</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
should be the maximum value of <CODE>HARD_REGNO_NREGS (<VAR>regno</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
for all <VAR>regno</VAR> values in the class <VAR>class</VAR>.
</P><P>

This macro helps control the handling of multiple-word values
in the reload pass.
</DL>
<P>

Three other special macros describe which operands fit which constraint
letters.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX965"></A>
<DT><CODE>CONST_OK_FOR_LETTER_P (<VAR>value</VAR>, <VAR>c</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression that defines the machine-dependent operand constraint letters
that specify particular ranges of integer values.  If <VAR>c</VAR> is one
of those letters, the expression should check that <VAR>value</VAR>, an integer,
is in the appropriate range and return 1 if so, 0 otherwise.  If <VAR>c</VAR> is
not one of those letters, the value should be 0 regardless of <VAR>value</VAR>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX966"></A>
<DT><CODE>CONST_DOUBLE_OK_FOR_LETTER_P (<VAR>value</VAR>, <VAR>c</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression that defines the machine-dependent operand constraint
letters that specify particular ranges of <CODE>const_double</CODE> values.
<P>

If <VAR>c</VAR> is one of those letters, the expression should check that
<VAR>value</VAR>, an RTX of code <CODE>const_double</CODE>, is in the appropriate
range and return 1 if so, 0 otherwise.  If <VAR>c</VAR> is not one of those
letters, the value should be 0 regardless of <VAR>value</VAR>.
</P><P>

<CODE>const_double</CODE> is used for all floating-point constants and for
<CODE>DImode</CODE> fixed-point constants.  A given letter can accept either
or both kinds of values.  It can use <CODE>GET_MODE</CODE> to distinguish
between these kinds.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX967"></A>
<DT><CODE>EXTRA_CONSTRAINT (<VAR>value</VAR>, <VAR>c</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression that defines the optional machine-dependent constraint
letters that can be used to segregate specific types of operands,
usually memory references, for the target machine.  Normally this macro
will not be defined.  If it is required for a particular target machine,
it should return 1 if <VAR>value</VAR> corresponds to the operand type
represented by the constraint letter <VAR>c</VAR>.  If <VAR>c</VAR> is not defined
as an extra constraint, the value returned should be 0 regardless of
<VAR>value</VAR>.
<P>

For example, on the ROMP, load instructions cannot have their output in r0 if
the memory reference contains a symbolic address.  Constraint letter
<SAMP>`Q'</SAMP> is defined as representing a memory address that does
<EM>not</EM> contain a symbolic address.  An alternative is specified with
a <SAMP>`Q'</SAMP> constraint on the input and <SAMP>`r'</SAMP> on the output.  The next
alternative specifies <SAMP>`m'</SAMP> on the input and a register class that
does not include r0 on the output.

<!--docid::SEC165::-->

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX986"></A>
<DT><CODE>FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED</CODE>
<DD>A C expression which is nonzero if a function must have and use a frame
pointer.  This expression is evaluated  in the reload pass.  If its value is
nonzero the function will have a frame pointer.
<P>

The expression can in principle examine the current function and decide
according to the facts, but on most machines the constant 0 or the
constant 1 suffices.  Use 0 when the machine allows code to be generated
with no frame pointer, and doing so saves some time or space.  Use 1
when there is no possible advantage to avoiding a frame pointer.
</P><P>

In certain cases, the compiler does not know how to produce valid code
without a frame pointer.  The compiler recognizes those cases and
automatically gives the function a frame pointer regardless of what
<CODE>FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED</CODE> says.  You don't need to worry about
them.</P><P>

In a function that does not require a frame pointer, the frame pointer
register can be allocated for ordinary usage, unless you mark it as a
fixed register.  See <CODE>FIXED_REGISTERS</CODE> for more information.
</P><P>

This macro is ignored and need not be defined if <CODE>ELIMINABLE_REGS</CODE>
is defined.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX987"></A>
<A NAME="IDX988"></A>
<DT><CODE>INITIAL_FRAME_POINTER_OFFSET (<VAR>depth-var</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C statement to store in the variable <VAR>depth-var</VAR> the difference
between the frame pointer and the stack pointer values immediately after
the function prologue.  The value would be computed from information
such as the result of <CODE>get_frame_size ()</CODE> and the tables of
registers <CODE>regs_ever_live</CODE> and <CODE>call_used_regs</CODE>.
<P>

If <CODE>ELIMINABLE_REGS</CODE> is defined, this macro will be not be used and
need not be defined.  Otherwise, it must be defined even if
<CODE>FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED</CODE> is defined to always be true; in that
case, you may set <VAR>depth-var</VAR> to anything.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX989"></A>
<DT><CODE>ELIMINABLE_REGS</CODE>
<DD>If defined, this macro specifies a table of register pairs used to
eliminate unneeded registers that point into the stack frame.  If it is not
defined, the only elimination attempted by the compiler is to replace
references to the frame pointer with references to the stack pointer.
<P>

The definition of this macro is a list of structure initializations, each
of which specifies an original and replacement register.
</P><P>

On some machines, the position of the argument pointer is not known until
the compilation is completed.  In such a case, a separate hard register
must be used for the argument pointer.  This register can be eliminated by
replacing it with either the frame pointer or the argument pointer,
depending on whether or not the frame pointer has been eliminated.
</P><P>

In this case, you might specify:
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define ELIMINABLE_REGS  \
{{ARG_POINTER_REGNUM, STACK_POINTER_REGNUM}, \
 {ARG_POINTER_REGNUM, FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM}, \
 {FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM, STACK_POINTER_REGNUM}}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Note that the elimination of the argument pointer with the stack pointer is
specified first since that is the preferred elimination.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX990"></A>
<DT><CODE>CAN_ELIMINATE (<VAR>from-reg</VAR>, <VAR>to-reg</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression that returns non-zero if the compiler is allowed to try
to replace register number <VAR>from-reg</VAR> with register number
<VAR>to-reg</VAR>.  This macro need only be defined if <CODE>ELIMINABLE_REGS</CODE>
is defined, and will usually be the constant 1, since most of the cases
preventing register elimination are things that the compiler already
knows about.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX991"></A>
<DT><CODE>INITIAL_ELIMINATION_OFFSET (<VAR>from-reg</VAR>, <VAR>to-reg</VAR>, <VAR>offset-var</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>This macro is similar to <CODE>INITIAL_FRAME_POINTER_OFFSET</CODE>.  It
specifies the initial difference between the specified pair of
registers.  This macro must be defined if <CODE>ELIMINABLE_REGS</CODE> is
defined.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX992"></A>
<DT><CODE>LONGJMP_RESTORE_FROM_STACK</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if the <CODE>longjmp</CODE> function restores registers from
the stack frames, rather than from those saved specifically by
<CODE>setjmp</CODE>.  Certain quantities must not be kept in registers across
a call to <CODE>setjmp</CODE> on such machines.

<H3> 14.7.4 Passing Function Arguments on the Stack </H3>
<!--docid::SEC166::-->
<P>

The macros in this section control how arguments are passed
on the stack.  See the following section for other macros that
control passing certain arguments in registers.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX993"></A>
<DT><CODE>PROMOTE_PROTOTYPES</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if an argument declared as <CODE>char</CODE> or
<CODE>short</CODE> in a prototype should actually be passed as an
<CODE>int</CODE>.  In addition to avoiding errors in certain cases of
mismatch, it also makes for better code on certain machines.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX994"></A>
<DT><CODE>PUSH_ROUNDING (<VAR>npushed</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression that is the number of bytes actually pushed onto the
stack when an instruction attempts to push <VAR>npushed</VAR> bytes.
<P>

If the target machine does not have a push instruction, do not define
this macro.  That directs GNU CC to use an alternate strategy: to
allocate the entire argument block and then store the arguments into
it.
</P><P>

On some machines, the definition
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define PUSH_ROUNDING(BYTES) (BYTES)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

will suffice.  But on other machines, instructions that appear
to push one byte actually push two bytes in an attempt to maintain
alignment.  Then the definition should be
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define PUSH_ROUNDING(BYTES) (((BYTES) + 1) &#38; ~1)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX995"></A>
<A NAME="IDX996"></A>
<DT><CODE>ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS</CODE>
<DD>If defined, the maximum amount of space required for outgoing arguments
will be computed and placed into the variable
<CODE>current_function_outgoing_args_size</CODE>.  No space will be pushed
onto the stack for each call; instead, the function prologue should
increase the stack frame size by this amount.
<P>

It is not proper to define both <CODE>PUSH_ROUNDING</CODE> and
<CODE>ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX997"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE (<VAR>fndecl</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if functions should assume that stack space has been
allocated for arguments even when their values are passed in
registers.
<P>

The value of this macro is the size, in bytes, of the area reserved for
arguments passed in registers for the function represented by <VAR>fndecl</VAR>.
</P><P>

This space can either be allocated by the caller or be a part of the
machine-dependent stack frame: <CODE>OUTGOING_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE>
says which.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX998"></A>
<A NAME="IDX999"></A>
<DT><CODE>MAYBE_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>FINAL_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE (<VAR>const_size</VAR>, <VAR>var_size</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Define these macros in addition to the one above if functions might
allocate stack space for arguments even when their values are passed
in registers.  These should be used when the stack space allocated
for arguments in registers is not a simple constant independent of the
function declaration.
<P>

The value of the first macro is the size, in bytes, of the area that
we should initially assume would be reserved for arguments passed in registers.
</P><P>

The value of the second macro is the actual size, in bytes, of the area
that will be reserved for arguments passed in registers.  This takes two
arguments: an integer representing the number of bytes of fixed sized
arguments on the stack, and a tree representing the number of bytes of
variable sized arguments on the stack.
</P><P>

When these macros are defined, <CODE>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE> will only be
called for libcall functions, the current function, or for a function
being called when it is known that such stack space must be allocated.
In each case this value can be easily computed.
</P><P>

When deciding whether a called function needs such stack space, and how
much space to reserve, GNU CC uses these two macros instead of
<CODE>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1000"></A>
<DT><CODE>OUTGOING_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE>
<DD>Define this if it is the responsibility of the caller to allocate the area
reserved for arguments passed in registers.
<P>

If <CODE>ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS</CODE> is defined, this macro controls
whether the space for these arguments counts in the value of
<CODE>current_function_outgoing_args_size</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1001"></A>
<DT><CODE>STACK_PARMS_IN_REG_PARM_AREA</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if <CODE>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE> is defined but stack
parameters don't skip the area specified by <CODE>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE>.
<P>

Normally, when a parameter is not passed in registers, it is placed on the
stack beyond the <CODE>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE> area.  Defining this macro
suppresses this behavior and causes the parameter to be passed on the
stack in its natural location.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1002"></A>
<DT><CODE>RETURN_POPS_ARGS (<VAR>funtype</VAR>, <VAR>stack-size</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression that should indicate the number of bytes of its own
arguments that a function pops on returning, or 0 if the
function pops no arguments and the caller must therefore pop them all
after the function returns.
<P>

<VAR>funtype</VAR> is a C variable whose value is a tree node that
describes the function in question.  Normally it is a node of type
<CODE>FUNCTION_TYPE</CODE> that describes the data type of the function.
From this it is possible to obtain the data types of the value and
arguments (if known).
</P><P>

When a call to a library function is being considered, <VAR>funtype</VAR>
will contain an identifier node for the library function.  Thus, if
you need to distinguish among various library functions, you can do so
by their names.  Note that "library function" in this context means
a function used to perform arithmetic, whose name is known specially
in the compiler and was not mentioned in the C code being compiled.
</P><P>

<VAR>stack-size</VAR> is the number of bytes of arguments passed on the
stack.  If a variable number of bytes is passed, it is zero, and
argument popping will always be the responsibility of the calling function.
</P><P>

On the Vax, all functions always pop their arguments, so the definition
of this macro is <VAR>stack-size</VAR>.  On the 68000, using the standard
calling convention, no functions pop their arguments, so the value of
the macro is always 0 in this case.  But an alternative calling
convention is available in which functions that take a fixed number of
arguments pop them but other functions (such as <CODE>printf</CODE>) pop
nothing (the caller pops all).  When this convention is in use,
<VAR>funtype</VAR> is examined to determine whether a function takes a fixed
number of arguments.

<H3> 14.7.5 Passing Arguments in Registers </H3>
<!--docid::SEC167::-->
<P>

This section describes the macros which let you control how various
types of arguments are passed in registers or how they are arranged in
the stack.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1003"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_ARG (<VAR>cum</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>, <VAR>named</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression that controls whether a function argument is passed
in a register, and which register.
<P>

The arguments are <VAR>cum</VAR>, which summarizes all the previous
arguments; <VAR>mode</VAR>, the machine mode of the argument; <VAR>type</VAR>,
the data type of the argument as a tree node or 0 if that is not known
(which happens for C support library functions); and <VAR>named</VAR>,
which is 1 for an ordinary argument and 0 for nameless arguments that
correspond to <SAMP>`<small>...</small>'</SAMP> in the called function's prototype.
</P><P>

The value of the expression should either be a <CODE>reg</CODE> RTX for the
hard register in which to pass the argument, or zero to pass the
argument on the stack.
</P><P>

For machines like the Vax and 68000, where normally all arguments are
pushed, zero suffices as a definition.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1004"></A>
The usual way to make the ANSI library <TT>`stdarg.h'</TT> work on a machine
where some arguments are usually passed in registers, is to cause
nameless arguments to be passed on the stack instead.  This is done
by making <CODE>FUNCTION_ARG</CODE> return 0 whenever <VAR>named</VAR> is 0.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1005"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1006"></A>
You may use the macro <CODE>MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (<VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>)</CODE>
in the definition of this macro to determine if this argument is of a
type that must be passed in the stack.  If <CODE>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE>
is not defined and <CODE>FUNCTION_ARG</CODE> returns non-zero for such an
argument, the compiler will abort.  If <CODE>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE> is
defined, the argument will be computed in the stack and then loaded into
a register.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1007"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG (<VAR>cum</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>, <VAR>named</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if the target machine has "register windows", so
that the register in which a function sees an arguments is not
necessarily the same as the one in which the caller passed the
argument.
<P>

For such machines, <CODE>FUNCTION_ARG</CODE> computes the register in which
the caller passes the value, and <CODE>FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG</CODE> should
be defined in a similar fashion to tell the function being called
where the arguments will arrive.
</P><P>

If <CODE>FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG</CODE> is not defined, <CODE>FUNCTION_ARG</CODE>
serves both purposes.</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1008"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_ARG_PARTIAL_NREGS (<VAR>cum</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>, <VAR>named</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression for the number of words, at the beginning of an
argument, must be put in registers.  The value must be zero for
arguments that are passed entirely in registers or that are entirely
pushed on the stack.
<P>

On some machines, certain arguments must be passed partially in
registers and partially in memory.  On these machines, typically the
first <VAR>n</VAR> words of arguments are passed in registers, and the rest
on the stack.  If a multi-word argument (a <CODE>double</CODE> or a
structure) crosses that boundary, its first few words must be passed
in registers and the rest must be pushed.  This macro tells the
compiler when this occurs, and how many of the words should go in
registers.
</P><P>

<CODE>FUNCTION_ARG</CODE> for these arguments should return the first
register to be used by the caller for this argument; likewise
<CODE>FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG</CODE>, for the called function.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1009"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_ARG_PASS_BY_REFERENCE (<VAR>cum</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>, <VAR>named</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression that indicates when an argument must be passed by reference.
If nonzero for an argument, a copy of that argument is made in memory and a
pointer to the argument is passed instead of the argument itself.
The pointer is passed in whatever way is appropriate for passing a pointer
to that type.
<P>

On machines where <CODE>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE> is not defined, a suitable
definition of this macro might be
<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define FUNCTION_ARG_PASS_BY_REFERENCE(CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)  \
  MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (MODE, TYPE)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1010"></A>
<DT><CODE>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE>
<DD>A C type for declaring a variable that is used as the first argument of
<CODE>FUNCTION_ARG</CODE> and other related values.  For some target machines,
the type <CODE>int</CODE> suffices and can hold the number of bytes of
argument so far.
<P>

There is no need to record in <CODE>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE> anything about the
arguments that have been passed on the stack.  The compiler has other
variables to keep track of that.  For target machines on which all
arguments are passed on the stack, there is no need to store anything in
<CODE>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE>; however, the data structure must exist and
should not be empty, so use <CODE>int</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1011"></A>
<DT><CODE>INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS (<VAR>cum</VAR>, <VAR>fntype</VAR>, <VAR>libname</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C statement (sans semicolon) for initializing the variable <VAR>cum</VAR>
for the state at the beginning of the argument list.  The variable has
type <CODE>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE>.  The value of <VAR>fntype</VAR> is the tree node
for the data type of the function which will receive the args, or 0
if the args are to a compiler support library function.
<P>

When processing a call to a compiler support library function,
<VAR>libname</VAR> identifies which one.  It is a <CODE>symbol_ref</CODE> rtx which
contains the name of the function, as a string.  <VAR>libname</VAR> is 0 when
an ordinary C function call is being processed.  Thus, each time this
macro is called, either <VAR>libname</VAR> or <VAR>fntype</VAR> is nonzero, but
never both of them at once.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1012"></A>
<DT><CODE>INIT_CUMULATIVE_INCOMING_ARGS (<VAR>cum</VAR>, <VAR>fntype</VAR>, <VAR>libname</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Like <CODE>INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE> but overrides it for the purposes of
finding the arguments for the function being compiled.  If this macro is
undefined, <CODE>INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE> is used instead.
<P>

The argument <VAR>libname</VAR> exists for symmetry with
<CODE>INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE>.  The value passed for <VAR>libname</VAR> is
always 0, since library routines with special calling conventions are
never compiled with GNU CC.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1013"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_ARG_ADVANCE (<VAR>cum</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>, <VAR>named</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C statement (sans semicolon) to update the summarizer variable
<VAR>cum</VAR> to advance past an argument in the argument list.  The
values <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR> and <VAR>named</VAR> describe that argument.
Once this is done, the variable <VAR>cum</VAR> is suitable for analyzing
the <EM>following</EM> argument with <CODE>FUNCTION_ARG</CODE>, etc.<P>

This macro need not do anything if the argument in question was passed
on the stack.  The compiler knows how to track the amount of stack space
used for arguments without any special help.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1014"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_ARG_PADDING (<VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>If defined, a C expression which determines whether, and in which direction,
to pad out an argument with extra space.  The value should be of type
<CODE>enum direction</CODE>: either <CODE>upward</CODE> to pad above the argument,
<CODE>downward</CODE> to pad below, or <CODE>none</CODE> to inhibit padding.
<P>

This macro does not control the <EM>amount</EM> of padding; that is
always just enough to reach the next multiple of <CODE>FUNCTION_ARG_BOUNDARY</CODE>.
</P><P>

This macro has a default definition which is right for most systems.
For little-endian machines, the default is to pad upward.  For
big-endian machines, the default is to pad downward for an argument of
constant size shorter than an <CODE>int</CODE>, and upward otherwise.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1015"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_ARG_BOUNDARY (<VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>If defined, a C expression that gives the alignment boundary, in bits,
of an argument with the specified mode and type.  If it is not defined, 
<CODE>PARM_BOUNDARY</CODE> is used for all arguments.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1016"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_ARG_REGNO_P (<VAR>regno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression that is nonzero if <VAR>regno</VAR> is the number of a hard
register in which function arguments are sometimes passed.  This does
<EM>not</EM> include implicit arguments such as the static chain and
the structure-value address.  On many machines, no registers can be
used for this purpose since all function arguments are pushed on the
stack.

</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1017"></A>
<DT><CODE>TRADITIONAL_RETURN_FLOAT</CODE>

<A NAME="IDX1018"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_VALUE (<VAR>valtype</VAR>, <VAR>func</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression to create an RTX representing the place where a
function returns a value of data type <VAR>valtype</VAR>.  <VAR>valtype</VAR> is
a tree node representing a data type.  Write <CODE>TYPE_MODE
(<VAR>valtype</VAR>)</CODE> to get the machine mode used to represent that type.
On many machines, only the mode is relevant.  (Actually, on most
machines, scalar values are returned in the same place regardless of
mode).<P>

If <CODE>PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN</CODE> is defined, you must apply the same
promotion rules specified in <CODE>PROMOTE_MODE</CODE> if <VAR>valtype</VAR> is a
scalar type.
</P><P>

If the precise function being called is known, <VAR>func</VAR> is a tree
node (<CODE>FUNCTION_DECL</CODE>) for it; otherwise, <VAR>func</VAR> is a null
pointer.  This makes it possible to use a different value-returning
convention for specific functions when all their calls are
known.</P><P>

<CODE>FUNCTION_VALUE</CODE> is not used for return vales with aggregate data

so that the register in which a function returns its value is not
the same as the one in which the caller sees the value.
<P>

For such machines, <CODE>FUNCTION_VALUE</CODE> computes the register in
which the caller will see the value, and
<CODE>FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE</CODE> should be defined in a similar fashion
to tell the function where to put the value.</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1020"></A>
<DT><CODE>LIBCALL_VALUE (<VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression to create an RTX representing the place where a library
function returns a value of mode <VAR>mode</VAR>.  If the precise function
being called is known, <VAR>func</VAR> is a tree node
(<CODE>FUNCTION_DECL</CODE>) for it; otherwise, <VAR>func</VAR> is a null
pointer.  This makes it possible to use a different value-returning
convention for specific functions when all their calls are
known.<P>

Note that "library function" in this context means a compiler
support routine, used to perform arithmetic, whose name is known
specially by the compiler and was not mentioned in the C code being
compiled.
</P><P>

The definition of <CODE>LIBRARY_VALUE</CODE> need not be concerned aggregate
data types, because none of the library functions returns such types.

<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P (<VAR>regno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression that is nonzero if <VAR>regno</VAR> is the number of a hard
register in which the values of called function may come back.
<P>

A register whose use for returning values is limited to serving as the
second of a pair (for a value of type <CODE>double</CODE>, say) need not be
recognized by this macro.  So for most machines, this definition
suffices:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P(N) ((N) == 0)

<H3> 14.7.7 How Large Values Are Returned </H3>
<!--docid::SEC169::-->
<P>

When a function value's mode is <CODE>BLKmode</CODE> (and in some other
cases), the value is not returned according to <CODE>FUNCTION_VALUE</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC168">14.7.6 How Scalar Function Values Are Returned</A>).  Instead, the caller passes the address of a
block of memory in which the value should be stored.  This address
is called the <EM>structure value address</EM>.
</P><P>

This section describes how to control returning structure values in
memory.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1022"></A>
<DT><CODE>RETURN_IN_MEMORY (<VAR>type</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression which can inhibit the returning of certain function
values in registers, based on the type of value.  A nonzero value says
to return the function value in memory, just as large structures are
always returned.  Here <VAR>type</VAR> will be a C expression of type
<CODE>tree</CODE>, representing the data type of the value.
<P>

Note that values of mode <CODE>BLKmode</CODE> are returned in memory
regardless of this macro.  Also, the option <SAMP>`-fpcc-struct-return'</SAMP>
takes effect regardless of this macro.  On most systems, it is
possible to leave the macro undefined; this causes a default
definition to be used, whose value is the constant 0.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1023"></A>
<DT><CODE>STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM</CODE>
<DD>If the structure value address is passed in a register, then
<CODE>STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM</CODE> should be the number of that register.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1024"></A>
<DT><CODE>STRUCT_VALUE</CODE>
<DD>If the structure value address is not passed in a register, define
<CODE>STRUCT_VALUE</CODE> as an expression returning an RTX for the place
where the address is passed.  If it returns 0, the address is passed as
an "invisible" first argument.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1025"></A>
<DT><CODE>STRUCT_VALUE_INCOMING_REGNUM</CODE>
<DD>On some architectures the place where the structure value address
is found by the called function is not the same place that the
caller put it.  This can be due to register windows, or it could
be because the function prologue moves it to a different place.
<P>

If the incoming location of the structure value address is in a
register, define this macro as the register number.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1026"></A>
<DT><CODE>STRUCT_VALUE_INCOMING</CODE>
<DD>If the incoming location is not a register, define
<CODE>STRUCT_VALUE_INCOMING</CODE> as an expression for an RTX for where the
called function should find the value.  If it should find the value on
the stack, define this to create a <CODE>mem</CODE> which refers to the frame
pointer.  A definition of 0 means that the address is passed as an
"invisible" first argument.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1027"></A>
<DT><CODE>PCC_STATIC_STRUCT_RETURN</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if the usual system convention on the target machine
for returning structures and unions is for the called function to return
the address of a static variable containing the value.  GNU CC does not
normally use this convention, even if it is the usual one, but does use
it if <SAMP>`-fpcc-struct-return'</SAMP> is specified.
<P>

Do not define this if the usual system convention is for the caller to
pass an address to the subroutine.

<!--docid::SEC170::-->
<P>

If you enable it, GNU CC can save registers around function calls.  This
makes it possible to use call-clobbered registers to hold variables that
must live across calls.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1028"></A>
<DT><CODE>DEFAULT_CALLER_SAVES</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if function calls on the target machine do not preserve
any registers; in other words, if <CODE>CALL_USED_REGISTERS</CODE> has 1
for all registers.  This macro enables <SAMP>`-fcaller-saves'</SAMP> by default.
Eventually that option will be enabled by default on all machines and both
the option and this macro will be eliminated.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1029"></A>
<DT><CODE>CALLER_SAVE_PROFITABLE (<VAR>refs</VAR>, <VAR>calls</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression to determine whether it is worthwhile to consider placing
a pseudo-register in a call-clobbered hard register and saving and
restoring it around each function call.  The expression should be 1 when
this is worth doing, and 0 otherwise.

<H3> 14.7.9 Function Entry and Exit </H3>
<!--docid::SEC171::-->
<P>

This section describes the macros that output function entry
(<EM>prologue</EM>) and exit (<EM>epilogue</EM>) code.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1030"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE (<VAR>file</VAR>, <VAR>size</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C compound statement that outputs the assembler code for entry to a
function.  The prologue is responsible for setting up the stack frame,
initializing the frame pointer register, saving registers that must be
saved, and allocating <VAR>size</VAR> additional bytes of storage for the
local variables.  <VAR>size</VAR> is an integer.  <VAR>file</VAR> is a stdio
stream to which the assembler code should be output.
<P>

The label for the beginning of the function need not be output by this
macro.  That has already been done when the macro is run.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1031"></A>
To determine which registers to save, the macro can refer to the array
<CODE>regs_ever_live</CODE>: element <VAR>r</VAR> is nonzero if hard register
<VAR>r</VAR> is used anywhere within the function.  This implies the function
prologue should save register <VAR>r</VAR>, provided it is not one of the
call-used registers.  (<CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE> must likewise use
<CODE>regs_ever_live</CODE>.)
</P><P>

On machines that have "register windows", the function entry code does
not save on the stack the registers that are in the windows, even if
they are supposed to be preserved by function calls; instead it takes
appropriate steps to "push" the register stack, if any non-call-used
registers are used in the function.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1032"></A>
On machines where functions may or may not have frame-pointers, the
function entry code must vary accordingly; it must set up the frame
pointer if one is wanted, and not otherwise.  To determine whether a
frame pointer is in wanted, the macro can refer to the variable
<CODE>frame_pointer_needed</CODE>.  The variable's value will be 1 at run
time in a function that needs a frame pointer.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC165">14.7.3 Eliminating Frame Pointer and Arg Pointer</A>.
</P><P>

The function entry code is responsible for allocating any stack space
required for the function.  This stack space consists of the regions
listed below.  In most cases, these regions are allocated in the
order listed, with the last listed region closest to the top of the
stack (the lowest address if <CODE>STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD</CODE> is defined, and
the highest address if it is not defined).  You can use a different order
for a machine if doing so is more convenient or required for
compatibility reasons.  Except in cases where required by standard
or by a debugger, there is no reason why the stack layout used by GCC
need agree with that used by other compilers for a machine.
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
<A NAME="IDX1033"></A>
A region of <CODE>current_function_pretend_args_size</CODE> bytes of
uninitialized space just underneath the first argument arriving on the
stack.  (This may not be at the very start of the allocated stack region
if the calling sequence has pushed anything else since pushing the stack
arguments.  But usually, on such machines, nothing else has been pushed
yet, because the function prologue itself does all the pushing.)  This
region is used on machines where an argument may be passed partly in
registers and partly in memory, and, in some cases to support the
features in <TT>`varargs.h'</TT> and <TT>`stdargs.h'</TT>.
<P>

<LI>
An area of memory used to save certain registers used by the function.
The size of this area, which may also include space for such things as
the return address and pointers to previous stack frames, is
machine-specific and usually depends on which registers have been used
in the function.  Machines with register windows often do not require
a save area.
<P>

<LI>
A region of at least <VAR>size</VAR> bytes, possibly rounded up to an allocation
boundary, to contain the local variables of the function.  On some machines,
this region and the save area may occur in the opposite order, with the
save area closer to the top of the stack.
<P>

<LI>
<A NAME="IDX1034"></A>
Optionally, in the case that <CODE>ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS</CODE> is defined,
a region of <CODE>current_function_outgoing_args_size</CODE> bytes to be used
for outgoing argument lists of the function.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC166">14.7.4 Passing Function Arguments on the Stack</A>.
</UL>
<P>

Normally, it is necessary for <CODE>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</CODE> and
<CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE> to treat leaf functions specially.  The C
variable <CODE>leaf_function</CODE> is nonzero for such a function.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1035"></A>
<DT><CODE>EXIT_IGNORE_STACK</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if the return
instruction or the function epilogue ignores the value of the stack
pointer; in other words, if it is safe to delete an instruction to
adjust the stack pointer before a return from the function.
<P>

Note that this macro's value is relevant only for functions for which
frame pointers are maintained.  It is never safe to delete a final
stack adjustment in a function that has no frame pointer, and the
compiler knows this regardless of <CODE>EXIT_IGNORE_STACK</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1036"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE (<VAR>file</VAR>, <VAR>size</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C compound statement that outputs the assembler code for exit from a
function.  The epilogue is responsible for restoring the saved
registers and stack pointer to their values when the function was
called, and returning control to the caller.  This macro takes the
same arguments as the macro <CODE>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</CODE>, and the
registers to restore are determined from <CODE>regs_ever_live</CODE> and
<CODE>CALL_USED_REGISTERS</CODE> in the same way.
<P>

On some machines, there is a single instruction that does all the work
of returning from the function.  On these machines, give that
instruction the name <SAMP>`return'</SAMP> and do not define the macro
<CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE> at all.
</P><P>

Do not define a pattern named <SAMP>`return'</SAMP> if you want the
<CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE> to be used.  If you want the target switches
to control whether return instructions or epilogues are used, define a
<SAMP>`return'</SAMP> pattern with a validity condition that tests the target
switches appropriately.  If the <SAMP>`return'</SAMP> pattern's validity
condition is false, epilogues will be used.
</P><P>

On machines where functions may or may not have frame-pointers, the
function exit code must vary accordingly.  Sometimes the code for these
two cases is completely different.  To determine whether a frame pointer
is wanted, the macro can refer to the variable
<CODE>frame_pointer_needed</CODE>.  The variable's value will be 1 at run time
in a function that needs a frame pointer.
</P><P>

Normally, it is necessary for <CODE>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</CODE> and
<CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE> to treat leaf functions specially.  The C
variable <CODE>leaf_function</CODE> is nonzero for such a function.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC158">14.5.4 Handling Leaf Functions</A>.
</P><P>

On some machines, some functions pop their arguments on exit while
others leave that for the caller to do.  For example, the 68020 when
given <SAMP>`-mrtd'</SAMP> pops arguments in functions that take a fixed
number of arguments.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1037"></A>
Your definition of the macro <CODE>RETURN_POPS_ARGS</CODE> decides which
functions pop their own arguments.  <CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE> needs to
know what was decided.  The variable <CODE>current_function_pops_args</CODE>
is the number of bytes of its arguments that a function should pop.
See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC168">14.7.6 How Scalar Function Values Are Returned</A>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1038"></A>
<DT><CODE>DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if the function epilogue contains delay slots to which
instructions from the rest of the function can be "moved".  The
definition should be a C expression whose value is an integer
representing the number of delay slots there.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1039"></A>
<DT><CODE>ELIGIBLE_FOR_EPILOGUE_DELAY (<VAR>insn</VAR>, <VAR>n</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression that returns 1 if <VAR>insn</VAR> can be placed in delay
slot number <VAR>n</VAR> of the epilogue.
<P>

The argument <VAR>n</VAR> is an integer which identifies the delay slot now
being considered (since different slots may have different rules of
eligibility).  It is never negative and is always less than the number
of epilogue delay slots (what <CODE>DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE</CODE> returns).
If you reject a particular insn for a given delay slot, in principle, it
may be reconsidered for a subsequent delay slot.  Also, other insns may
(at least in principle) be considered for the so far unfilled delay
slot.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1040"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1041"></A>
The insns accepted to fill the epilogue delay slots are put in an RTL
list made with <CODE>insn_list</CODE> objects, stored in the variable
<CODE>current_function_epilogue_delay_list</CODE>.  The insn for the first
delay slot comes first in the list.  Your definition of the macro
<CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE> should fill the delay slots by outputting the
insns in this list, usually by calling <CODE>final_scan_insn</CODE>.
</P><P>

You need not define this macro if you did not define
<CODE>DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE</CODE>.

<H3> 14.7.10 Generating Code for Profiling </H3>
<!--docid::SEC172::-->
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1042"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_PROFILER (<VAR>file</VAR>, <VAR>labelno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C statement or compound statement to output to <VAR>file</VAR> some
assembler code to call the profiling subroutine <CODE>mcount</CODE>.
Before calling, the assembler code must load the address of a
counter variable into a register where <CODE>mcount</CODE> expects to
find the address.  The name of this variable is <SAMP>`LP'</SAMP> followed
by the number <VAR>labelno</VAR>, so you would generate the name using
<SAMP>`LP%d'</SAMP> in a <CODE>fprintf</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1043"></A>
The details of how the address should be passed to <CODE>mcount</CODE> are
determined by your operating system environment, not by GNU CC.  To
figure them out, compile a small program for profiling using the
system's installed C compiler and look at the assembler code that
results.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1044"></A>
<DT><CODE>PROFILE_BEFORE_PROLOGUE</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if the code for function profiling should come before
the function prologue.  Normally, the profiling code comes after.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1045"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1046"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER (<VAR>file</VAR>, <VAR>labelno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C statement or compound statement to output to <VAR>file</VAR> some
assembler code to initialize basic-block profiling for the current
object module.  This code should call the subroutine
<CODE>__bb_init_func</CODE> once per object module, passing it as its sole
argument the address of a block allocated in the object module.
<P>

The name of the block is a local symbol made with this statement:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (<VAR>buffer</VAR>, "LPBX", 0);
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Of course, since you are writing the definition of
<CODE>ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL</CODE> as well as that of this macro, you
can take a short cut in the definition of this macro and use the name
that you know will result.
</P><P>

The first word of this block is a flag which will be nonzero if the
object module has already been initialized.  So test this word first,
and do not call <CODE>__bb_init_func</CODE> if the flag is nonzero.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1047"></A>
<DT><CODE>BLOCK_PROFILER (<VAR>file</VAR>, <VAR>blockno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C statement or compound statement to increment the count associated
with the basic block number <VAR>blockno</VAR>.  Basic blocks are numbered
separately from zero within each compilation.  The count associated
with block number <VAR>blockno</VAR> is at index <VAR>blockno</VAR> in a vector

<H2> 14.8 Implementing the Varargs Macros </H2>
<!--docid::SEC173::-->
<P>

GNU CC comes with an implementation of <TT>`varargs.h'</TT> and
<TT>`stdarg.h'</TT> that work without change on machines that pass arguments
on the stack.  Other machines require their own implementations of
varargs, and the two machine independent header files must have
conditionals to include it.
</P><P>

ANSI <TT>`stdarg.h'</TT> differs from traditional <TT>`varargs.h'</TT> mainly in
the calling convention for <CODE>va_start</CODE>.  The traditional
implementation takes just one argument, which is the variable in which
to store the argument pointer.  The ANSI implementation of
<CODE>va_start</CODE> takes an additional second argument.  The user is
supposed to write the last named argument of the function here.
</P><P>

However, <CODE>va_start</CODE> should not use this argument.  The way to find
the end of the named arguments is with the built-in functions described
below.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1048"></A>
<DT><CODE>__builtin_saveregs ()</CODE>
<DD>Use this built-in function to save the argument registers in memory so
that the varargs mechanism can access them.  Both ANSI and traditional
versions of <CODE>va_start</CODE> must use <CODE>__builtin_saveregs</CODE>, unless
you use <CODE>SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS</CODE> (see below) instead.
<P>

On some machines, <CODE>__builtin_saveregs</CODE> is open-coded under the
control of the macro <CODE>EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS</CODE>.  On other machines,
it calls a routine written in assembler language, found in
<TT>`libgcc2.c'</TT>.
</P><P>

Regardless of what code is generated for the call to
<CODE>__builtin_saveregs</CODE>, it appears at the beginning of the function,
not where the call to <CODE>__builtin_saveregs</CODE> is written.  This is
because the registers must be saved before the function starts to use
them for its own purposes.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1049"></A>
<DT><CODE>__builtin_args_info (<VAR>category</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Use this built-in function to find the first anonymous arguments in
registers.
<P>

In general, a machine may have several categories of registers used for
arguments, each for a particular category of data types.  (For example,
on some machines, floating-point registers are used for floating-point
arguments while other arguments are passed in the general registers.)
To make non-varargs functions use the proper calling convention, you
have defined the <CODE>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE> data type to record how many
registers in each category have been used so far
</P><P>

<CODE>__builtin_args_info</CODE> accesses the same data structure of type
<CODE>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE> after the ordinary argument layout is finished
with it, with <VAR>category</VAR> specifying which word to access.  Thus, the
value indicates the first unused register in a given category.
</P><P>

Normally, you would use <CODE>__builtin_args_info</CODE> in the implementation
of <CODE>va_start</CODE>, accessing each category just once and storing the
value in the <CODE>va_list</CODE> object.  This is because <CODE>va_list</CODE> will
have to update the values, and there is no way to alter the
values accessed by <CODE>__builtin_args_info</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1050"></A>
<DT><CODE>__builtin_next_arg ()</CODE>
<DD>This is the equivalent of <CODE>__builtin_args_info</CODE>, for stack
arguments.  It returns the address of the first anonymous stack
argument, as type <CODE>void *</CODE>. If <CODE>ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD</CODE>, it
returns the address of the location above the first anonymous stack
argument. Use it in <CODE>va_start</CODE> to initialize the pointer for
fetching arguments from the stack. 
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1051"></A>
<DT><CODE>__builtin_classify_type (<VAR>object</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Since each machine has its own conventions for which data types are
passed in which kind of register, your implementation of <CODE>va_arg</CODE>
has to embody these conventions.  The easiest way to categorize the
specified data type is to use <CODE>__builtin_classify_type</CODE> together
with <CODE>sizeof</CODE> and <CODE>__alignof__</CODE>.
<P>

<CODE>__builtin_classify_type</CODE> ignores the value of <VAR>object</VAR>,
considering only its data type.  It returns an integer describing what
kind of type that is--integer, floating, pointer, structure, and so on.
</P><P>

The file <TT>`typeclass.h'</TT> defines an enumeration that you can use to
interpret the values of <CODE>__builtin_classify_type</CODE>.
</DL>
<P>

These machine description macros help implement varargs: 
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1052"></A>
<DT><CODE>EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS (<VAR>args</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>If defined, is a C expression that produces the machine-specific code
for a call to <CODE>__builtin_saveregs</CODE>.  This code will be moved to the
very beginning of the function, before any parameter access are made.
The return value of this function should be an RTX that contains the
value to use as the return of <CODE>__builtin_saveregs</CODE>.
<P>

The argument <VAR>args</VAR> is a <CODE>tree_list</CODE> containing the arguments
that were passed to <CODE>__builtin_saveregs</CODE>.
</P><P>

If this macro is not defined, the compiler will output an ordinary
call to the library function <SAMP>`__builtin_saveregs'</SAMP>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1053"></A>
<DT><CODE>SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS (<VAR>args_so_far</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>, <VAR>pretend_args_size</VAR>, <VAR>second_time</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>This macro offers an alternative to using <CODE>__builtin_saveregs</CODE> and
defining the macro <CODE>EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS</CODE>.  Use it to store the
anonymous register arguments into the stack so that all the arguments
appear to have been passed consecutively on the stack.  Once this is
done, you can use the standard implementation of varargs that works for
machines that pass all their arguments on the stack.
<P>

The argument <VAR>args_so_far</VAR> is the <CODE>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE> data
structure, containing the values that obtain after processing of the
named arguments.  The arguments <VAR>mode</VAR> and <VAR>type</VAR> describe the
last named argument--its machine mode and its data type as a tree node.
</P><P>

The macro implementation should do two things: first, push onto the
stack all the argument registers <EM>not</EM> used for the named
arguments, and second, store the size of the data thus pushed into the
<CODE>int</CODE>-valued variable whose name is supplied as the argument
<VAR>pretend_args_size</VAR>.  The value that you store here will serve as
additional offset for setting up the stack frame.
</P><P>

Because you must generate code to push the anonymous arguments at
compile time without knowing their data types,
<CODE>SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS</CODE> is only useful on machines that have just
a single category of argument register and use it uniformly for all data
types.
</P><P>

If the argument <VAR>second_time</VAR> is nonzero, it means that the
arguments of the function are being analyzed for the second time.  This
happens for an inline function, which is not actually compiled until the
end of the source file.  The macro <CODE>SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS</CODE> should
not generate any instructions in this case.

<H2> 14.9 Trampolines for Nested Functions </H2>
<!--docid::SEC174::-->
<P>

A <EM>trampoline</EM> is a small piece of code that is created at run time
when the address of a nested function is taken.  It normally resides on
the stack, in the stack frame of the containing function.  These macros
tell GNU CC how to generate code to allocate and initialize a
trampoline.
</P><P>

The instructions in the trampoline must do two things: load a constant
address into the static chain register, and jump to the real address of
the nested function.  On CISC machines such as the m68k, this requires
two instructions, a move immediate and a jump.  Then the two addresses
exist in the trampoline as word-long immediate operands.  On RISC
machines, it is often necessary to load each address into a register in
two parts.  Then pieces of each address form separate immediate
operands.
</P><P>

The code generated to initialize the trampoline must store the variable
parts--the static chain value and the function address--into the
immediate operands of the instructions.  On a CISC machine, this is
simply a matter of copying each address to a memory reference at the
proper offset from the start of the trampoline.  On a RISC machine, it
may be necessary to take out pieces of the address and store them
separately.

<DT><CODE>TRAMPOLINE_TEMPLATE (<VAR>file</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C statement to output, on the stream <VAR>file</VAR>, assembler code for a

<DT><CODE>TRAMPOLINE_SECTION</CODE>

trampoline template is to be placed (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC179">14.14 Dividing the Output into Sections (Texts, Data, <small>...</small>)</A>).  The default is
a value of <SAMP>`readonly_data_section'</SAMP>, which places the trampoline in
the section containing read-only data.

<DT><CODE>INITIALIZE_TRAMPOLINE (<VAR>addr</VAR>, <VAR>fnaddr</VAR>, <VAR>static_chain</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C statement to initialize the variable parts of a trampoline.
<VAR>addr</VAR> is an RTX for the address of the trampoline; <VAR>fnaddr</VAR> is
an RTX for the address of the nested function; <VAR>static_chain</VAR> is an
RTX for the static chain value that should be passed to the function

<A NAME="IDX1059"></A>
<DT><CODE>ALLOCATE_TRAMPOLINE (<VAR>fp</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression to allocate run-time space for a trampoline.  The

space for the trampoline.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1060"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1061"></A>
If this macro is not defined, by default the trampoline is allocated as
a stack slot.  This default is right for most machines.  The exceptions
are machines where it is impossible to execute instructions in the stack
area.  On such machines, you may have to implement a separate stack,
using this macro in conjunction with <CODE>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</CODE> and
<CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE>.
</P><P>

<VAR>fp</VAR> points to a data structure, a <CODE>struct function</CODE>, which
describes the compilation status of the immediate containing function of
the function which the trampoline is for.  Normally (when
<CODE>ALLOCATE_TRAMPOLINE</CODE> is not defined), the stack slot for the
trampoline is in the stack frame of this containing function.  Other
allocation strategies probably must do something analogous with this
information.
</DL>
<P>

Implementing trampolines is difficult on many machines because they have
separate instruction and data caches.  Writing into a stack location
fails to clear the memory in the instruction cache, so when the program
jumps to that location, it executes the old contents.
</P><P>

Here are two possible solutions.  One is to clear the relevant parts of
the instruction cache whenever a trampoline is set up.  The other is to
make all trampolines identical, by having them jump to a standard
subroutine.  The former technique makes trampoline execution faster; the
latter makes initialization faster.
</P><P>

To clear the instruction cache when a trampoline is initialized, define
the following macros which describe the shape of the cache.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1062"></A>
<DT><CODE>INSN_CACHE_SIZE</CODE>
<DD>The total size in bytes of the cache.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1063"></A>
<DT><CODE>INSN_CACHE_LINE_WIDTH</CODE>
<DD>The length in bytes of each cache line.  The cache is divided into cache
lines which are disjoint slots, each holding a contiguous chunk of data
fetched from memory.  Each time data is brought into the cache, an
entire line is read at once.  The data loaded into a cache line is 
always aligned on a boundary equal to the line size.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1064"></A>
<DT><CODE>INSN_CACHE_DEPTH</CODE>
<DD>The number of alternative cache lines that can hold any particular memory
location.
</DL>
<P>

To use a standard subroutine, define the following macro.  In addition,
you must make sure that the instructions in a trampoline fill an entire
cache line with identical instructions, or else ensure that the
beginning of the trampoline code is always aligned at the same point in
its cache line.  Look in <TT>`m68k.h'</TT> as a guide.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1065"></A>
<DT><CODE>TRANSFER_FROM_TRAMPOLINE</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if trampolines need a special subroutine to do their
work.  The macro should expand to a series of <CODE>asm</CODE> statements
which will be compiled with GNU CC.  They go in a library function named
<CODE>__transfer_from_trampoline</CODE>.
<P>

If you need to avoid executing the ordinary prologue code of a compiled
C function when you jump to the subroutine, you can do so by placing a
special label of your own in the assembler code.  Use one <CODE>asm</CODE>
statement to generate an assembler label, and another to make the label
global.  Then trampolines can use that label to jump directly to your
special assembler code.

of <CODE>float</CODE> and <CODE>int</CODE>.)
<P>

The obvious choice would be <CODE>float</CODE>---but that won't work with
traditional C compilers that expect all arguments declared as <CODE>float</CODE>

<DT><CODE>INTIFY (<VAR>float-value</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro to override the way the value of a

return it.  These functions are actually declared to return type 
<CODE>FLOAT_VALUE_TYPE</CODE> (normally <CODE>int</CODE>).
<P>

These values can't be returned as type <CODE>float</CODE> because traditional
C compilers would gratuitously convert the value to a <CODE>double</CODE>.
</P><P>

A local variable named <CODE>intify</CODE> is always available when the macro
<CODE>INTIFY</CODE> is used.  It is a union of a <CODE>float</CODE> field named

<CODE>FLOAT_VALUE_TYPE</CODE> or <CODE>int</CODE>.

<P>

It usually pays to define several simpler macros to serve as
subroutines for this one.  Otherwise it may be too complicated to
understand.
</P><P>

This macro must exist in two variants: a strict variant and a
non-strict one.  The strict variant is used in the reload pass.  It
must be defined so that any pseudo-register that has not been
allocated a hard register is considered a memory reference.  In
contexts where some kind of register is required, a pseudo-register
with no hard register must be rejected.
</P><P>

The non-strict variant is used in other passes.  It must be defined to
accept all pseudo-registers in every context where some kind of
register is required.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1101"></A>
Compiler source files that want to use the strict variant of this
macro define the macro <CODE>REG_OK_STRICT</CODE>.  You should use an
<CODE>#ifdef REG_OK_STRICT</CODE> conditional to define the strict variant
in that case and the non-strict variant otherwise.
</P><P>

Typically among the subroutines used to define
<CODE>GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS</CODE> are subroutines to check for
acceptable registers for various purposes (one for base registers, one
for index registers, and so on).  Then only these subroutine macros
need have two variants; the higher levels of macros may be the same
whether strict or not.</P><P>

Normally, constant addresses which are the sum of a <CODE>symbol_ref</CODE>
and an integer are stored inside a <CODE>const</CODE> RTX to mark them as
constant.  Therefore, there is no need to recognize such sums
specifically as legitimate addresses.  Normally you would simply
recognize any <CODE>const</CODE> as legitimate.
</P><P>

Usually <CODE>PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS</CODE> is not prepared to handle constant
sums that are not marked with  <CODE>const</CODE>.  It assumes that a naked
<CODE>plus</CODE> indicates indexing.  If so, then you <EM>must</EM> reject such
naked constant sums as illegitimate addresses, so that none of them will
be given to <CODE>PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1102"></A>
On some machines, whether a symbolic address is legitimate depends on
the section that the address refers to.  On these machines, define the
macro <CODE>ENCODE_SECTION_INFO</CODE> to store the information into the
<CODE>symbol_ref</CODE>, and then check for it here.  When you see a
<CODE>const</CODE>, you will have to look inside it to find the
<CODE>symbol_ref</CODE> in order to determine the section.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC181">14.16 Defining the Output Assembler Language</A>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1103"></A>
The best way to modify the name string is by adding text to the
beginning, with suitable punctuation to prevent any ambiguity.  Allocate
the new name in <CODE>saveable_obstack</CODE>.  You will have to modify
<CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF</CODE> to remove and decode the added text and
output the name accordingly, and define <CODE>STRIP_NAME_ENCODING</CODE> to
access the original name string.
</P><P>

You can check the information stored here into the <CODE>symbol_ref</CODE> in
the definitions of <CODE>GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS</CODE> and
<CODE>PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1104"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_OK_FOR_BASE_P (<VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression that is nonzero if <VAR>x</VAR> (assumed to be a <CODE>reg</CODE>
RTX) is valid for use as a base register.  For hard registers, it
should always accept those which the hardware permits and reject the
others.  Whether the macro accepts or rejects pseudo registers must be
controlled by <CODE>REG_OK_STRICT</CODE> as described above.  This usually
requires two variant definitions, of which <CODE>REG_OK_STRICT</CODE>
controls the one actually used.

<DD>A C expression that is nonzero if <VAR>x</VAR> (assumed to be a <CODE>reg</CODE>
RTX) is valid for use as an index register.
<P>

The difference between an index register and a base register is that
the index register may be scaled.  If an address involves the sum of
two registers, neither one of them scaled, then either one may be
labeled the "base" and the other the "index"; but whichever
labeling is used must fit the machine's constraints of which registers
may serve in each capacity.  The compiler will try both labelings,
looking for one that is valid, and will reload one or both registers
only if neither labeling works.

It is not necessary for this macro to come up with a legitimate

<P>

Autoincrement and autodecrement addresses typically have mode-dependent
effects because the amount of the increment or decrement is the size
of the operand being addressed.  Some machines have other mode-dependent

<VAR>x</VAR> satisfies <CODE>CONSTANT_P</CODE>, so you need not check this.  In fact,

<H2> 14.12 Condition Code Status </H2>
<!--docid::SEC177::-->
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1110"></A>
The file <TT>`conditions.h'</TT> defines a variable <CODE>cc_status</CODE> to
describe how the condition code was computed (in case the interpretation of
the condition code depends on the instruction that it was set by).  This
variable contains the RTL expressions on which the condition code is
currently based, and several standard flags.
</P><P>

Sometimes additional machine-specific flags must be defined in the machine
description header file.  It can also add additional machine-specific
information by defining <CODE>CC_STATUS_MDEP</CODE>.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1111"></A>
<DT><CODE>CC_STATUS_MDEP</CODE>
<DD>C code for a data type which is used for declaring the <CODE>mdep</CODE>
component of <CODE>cc_status</CODE>.  It defaults to <CODE>int</CODE>.
<P>

This macro is not used on machines that do not use <CODE>cc0</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1112"></A>
<DT><CODE>CC_STATUS_MDEP_INIT</CODE>
<DD>A C expression to initialize the <CODE>mdep</CODE> field to "empty".
The default definition does nothing, since most machines don't use
the field anyway.  If you want to use the field, you should probably
define this macro to initialize it.
<P>

This macro is not used on machines that do not use <CODE>cc0</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1113"></A>
<DT><CODE>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC (<VAR>exp</VAR>, <VAR>insn</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C compound statement to set the components of <CODE>cc_status</CODE>
appropriately for an insn <VAR>insn</VAR> whose body is <VAR>exp</VAR>.  It is
this macro's responsibility to recognize insns that set the condition
code as a byproduct of other activity as well as those that explicitly
set <CODE>(cc0)</CODE>.
<P>

This macro is not used on machines that do not use <CODE>cc0</CODE>.
</P><P>

If there are insns that do not set the condition code but do alter
other machine registers, this macro must check to see whether they
invalidate the expressions that the condition code is recorded as
reflecting.  For example, on the 68000, insns that store in address
registers do not set the condition code, which means that usually
<CODE>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</CODE> can leave <CODE>cc_status</CODE> unaltered for such
insns.  But suppose that the previous insn set the condition code
based on location <SAMP>`a4@(102)'</SAMP> and the current insn stores a new
value in <SAMP>`a4'</SAMP>.  Although the condition code is not changed by
this, it will no longer be true that it reflects the contents of
<SAMP>`a4@(102)'</SAMP>.  Therefore, <CODE>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</CODE> must alter
<CODE>cc_status</CODE> in this case to say that nothing is known about the
condition code value.
</P><P>

The definition of <CODE>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</CODE> must be prepared to deal
with the results of peephole optimization: insns whose patterns are
<CODE>parallel</CODE> RTXs containing various <CODE>reg</CODE>, <CODE>mem</CODE> or
constants which are just the operands.  The RTL structure of these
insns is not sufficient to indicate what the insns actually do.  What
<CODE>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</CODE> should do when it sees one is just to run
<CODE>CC_STATUS_INIT</CODE>.
</P><P>

A possible definition of <CODE>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</CODE> is to call a function
that looks at an attribute (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC140">13.15 Instruction Attributes</A>) named, for example,
<SAMP>`cc'</SAMP>.  This avoids having detailed information about patterns in
two places, the <TT>`md'</TT> file and in <CODE>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1114"></A>
<DT><CODE>EXTRA_CC_MODES</CODE>
<DD>A list of names to be used for additional modes for condition code
values in registers (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC135">13.10 Defining Jump Instruction Patterns</A>).  These names are added
to <CODE>enum machine_mode</CODE> and all have class <CODE>MODE_CC</CODE>.  By
convention, they should start with <SAMP>`CC'</SAMP> and end with <SAMP>`mode'</SAMP>.
<P>

You should only define this macro if your machine does not use <CODE>cc0</CODE>
and only if additional modes are required.

<DT><CODE>EXTRA_CC_NAMES</CODE>
<DD>A list of C strings giving the names for the modes listed in

operation code <VAR>op</VAR> is applied to rtx <VAR>x</VAR> and <VAR>y</VAR>.  For
example, on the Sparc, <CODE>SELECT_CC_MODE</CODE> is defined as (see

<H2> 14.13 Describing Relative Costs of Operations </H2>
<!--docid::SEC178::-->
<P>

These macros let you describe the relative speed of various operations
on the target machine.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1117"></A>
<DT><CODE>CONST_COSTS (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>code</VAR>, <VAR>outer_code</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A part of a C <CODE>switch</CODE> statement that describes the relative costs
of constant RTL expressions.  It must contain <CODE>case</CODE> labels for
expression codes <CODE>const_int</CODE>, <CODE>const</CODE>, <CODE>symbol_ref</CODE>,
<CODE>label_ref</CODE> and <CODE>const_double</CODE>.  Each case must ultimately
reach a <CODE>return</CODE> statement to return the relative cost of the use
of that kind of constant value in an expression.  The cost may depend on
the precise value of the constant, which is available for examination in
<VAR>x</VAR>, and the rtx code of the expression in which it is contained,
found in <VAR>outer_code</VAR>.
<P>

<VAR>code</VAR> is the expression code--redundant, since it can be
obtained with <CODE>GET_CODE (<VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1118"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1119"></A>
<DT><CODE>RTX_COSTS (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>code</VAR>, <VAR>outer_code</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Like <CODE>CONST_COSTS</CODE> but applies to nonconstant RTL expressions.
This can be used, for example, to indicate how costly a multiply
instruction is.  In writing this macro, you can use the construct
<CODE>COSTS_N_INSNS (<VAR>n</VAR>)</CODE> to specify a cost equal to <VAR>n</VAR> fast
instructions.  <VAR>outer_code</VAR> is the code of the expression in which
<VAR>x</VAR> is contained.
<P>

This macro is optional; do not define it if the default cost assumptions
are adequate for the target machine.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1120"></A>
<DT><CODE>ADDRESS_COST (<VAR>address</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>An expression giving the cost of an addressing mode that contains
<VAR>address</VAR>.  If not defined, the cost is computed from
the <VAR>address</VAR> expression and the <CODE>CONST_COSTS</CODE> values.
<P>

For most CISC machines, the default cost is a good approximation of the
true cost of the addressing mode.  However, on RISC machines, all
instructions normally have the same length and execution time.  Hence
all addresses will have equal costs.
</P><P>

In cases where more than one form of an address is known, the form with
the lowest cost will be used.  If multiple forms have the same, lowest,
cost, the one that is the most complex will be used.
</P><P>

For example, suppose an address that is equal to the sum of a register
and a constant is used twice in the same basic block.  When this macro
is not defined, the address will be computed in a register and memory
references will be indirect through that register.  On machines where
the cost of the addressing mode containing the sum is no higher than
that of a simple indirect reference, this will produce an additional
instruction and possibly require an additional register.  Proper
specification of this macro eliminates this overhead for such machines.
</P><P>

Similar use of this macro is made in strength reduction of loops.
</P><P>

<VAR>address</VAR> need not be valid as an address.  In such a case, the cost
is not relevant and can be any value; invalid addresses need not be
assigned a different cost.
</P><P>

On machines where an address involving more than one register is as
cheap as an address computation involving only one register, defining
<CODE>ADDRESS_COST</CODE> to reflect this can cause two registers to be live
over a region of code where only one would have been if
<CODE>ADDRESS_COST</CODE> were not defined in that manner.  This effect should
be considered in the definition of this macro.  Equivalent costs should
probably only be given to addresses with different numbers of registers
on machines with lots of registers.
</P><P>

This macro will normally either not be defined or be defined as a
constant.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1121"></A>
<DT><CODE>REGISTER_MOVE_COST (<VAR>from</VAR>, <VAR>to</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression for the cost of moving data from a register in class
<VAR>from</VAR> to one in class <VAR>to</VAR>.  The classes are expressed using
the enumeration values such as <CODE>GENERAL_REGS</CODE>.  A value of 2 is the
default; other values are interpreted relative to that.
<P>

It is not required that the cost always equal 2 when <VAR>from</VAR> is the
same as <VAR>to</VAR>; on some machines it is expensive to move between
registers if they are not general registers.
</P><P>

If reload sees an insn consisting of a single <CODE>set</CODE> between two
hard registers, and if <CODE>REGISTER_MOVE_COST</CODE> applied to their
classes returns a value of 2, reload does not check to ensure that the
constraints of the insn are met.  Setting a cost of other than 2 will
allow reload to verify that the constraints are met.  You should do this
if the <SAMP>`mov<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP> pattern's constraints do not allow such copying.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1122"></A>
<DT><CODE>MEMORY_MOVE_COST (<VAR>m</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression for the cost of moving data of mode <VAR>m</VAR> between a
register and memory.  A value of 2 is the default; this cost is relative
to those in <CODE>REGISTER_MOVE_COST</CODE>.
<P>

If moving between registers and memory is more expensive than between
two registers, you should define this macro to express the relative cost.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1123"></A>
<DT><CODE>BRANCH_COST</CODE>
<DD>A C expression for the cost of a branch instruction.  A value of 1 is
the default; other values are interpreted relative to that.
</DL>
<P>

Here are additional macros which do not specify precise relative costs,
but only that certain actions are more expensive than GNU CC would
ordinarily expect.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1124"></A>
<DT><CODE>SLOW_BYTE_ACCESS</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if accessing less
than a word of memory (i.e. a <CODE>char</CODE> or a <CODE>short</CODE>) is no
faster than accessing a word of memory, i.e., if such access
require more than one instruction or if there is no difference in cost
between byte and (aligned) word loads.
<P>

When this macro is not defined, the compiler will access a field by
finding the smallest containing object; when it is defined, a fullword
load will be used if alignment permits.  Unless bytes accesses are
faster than word accesses, using word accesses is preferable since it
may eliminate subsequent memory access if subsequent accesses occur to
other fields in the same word of the structure, but to different bytes.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1125"></A>
<DT><CODE>SLOW_ZERO_EXTEND</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if zero-extension (of a <CODE>char</CODE> or <CODE>short</CODE>
to an <CODE>int</CODE>) can be done faster if the destination is a register
that is known to be zero.
<P>

If you define this macro, you must have instruction patterns that
recognize RTL structures like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(set (strict_low_part (subreg:QI (reg:SI <small>...</small>) 0)) <small>...</small>)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

and likewise for <CODE>HImode</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1126"></A>
<DT><CODE>SLOW_UNALIGNED_ACCESS</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro to be the value 1 if unaligned accesses have a cost
many times greater than aligned accesses, for example if they are
emulated in a trap handler.
<P>

When this macro is non-zero, the compiler will act as if
<CODE>STRICT_ALIGNMENT</CODE> were non-zero when generating code for block
moves.  This can cause significantly more instructions to be produced.
Therefore, do not set this macro non-zero if unaligned accesses only add a
cycle or two to the time for a memory access.
</P><P>

If the value of this macro is always zero, it need not be defined.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1127"></A>
<DT><CODE>DONT_REDUCE_ADDR</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro to inhibit strength reduction of memory addresses.
(On some machines, such strength reduction seems to do harm rather
than good.)
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1128"></A>
<DT><CODE>MOVE_RATIO</CODE>
<DD>The number of scalar move insns which should be generated instead of a
string move insn or a library call.  Increasing the value will always
make code faster, but eventually incurs high cost in increased code size.
<P>

If you don't define this, a reasonable default is used.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1129"></A>
<DT><CODE>NO_FUNCTION_CSE</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if it is as good or better to call a constant
function address than to call an address kept in a register.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1130"></A>
<DT><CODE>NO_RECURSIVE_FUNCTION_CSE</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if it is as good or better for a function to call
itself with an explicit address than to call an address kept in a
register.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1131"></A>
<DT><CODE>ADJUST_COST (<VAR>insn</VAR>, <VAR>link</VAR>, <VAR>dep_insn</VAR>, <VAR>cost</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C statement (sans semicolon) to update the integer variable <VAR>cost</VAR>
based on the relationship between <VAR>insn</VAR> that is dependent on
<VAR>dep_insn</VAR> through the dependence <VAR>link</VAR>.  The default is to
make no adjustment to <VAR>cost</VAR>.  This can be used for example to
specify to the scheduler that an output- or anti-dependence does not
incur the same cost as a data-dependence.

<H2> 14.14 Dividing the Output into Sections (Texts, Data, <small>...</small>) </H2>
<!--docid::SEC179::-->
<P>

An object file is divided into sections containing different types of
data.  In the most common case, there are three sections: the <EM>text
section</EM>, which holds instructions and read-only data; the <EM>data
section</EM>, which holds initialized writable data; and the <EM>bss
section</EM>, which holds uninitialized data.  Some systems have other kinds
of sections.

<CODE>VAR_DECL</CODE> node or a constant of some sort.  <VAR>reloc</VAR>

<A NAME="IDX1144"></A>
<DT><CODE>SELECT_RTX_SECTION (<VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>rtx</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C statement or statements to switch to the appropriate section for
output of <VAR>rtx</VAR> in mode <VAR>mode</VAR>.  You can assume that <VAR>rtx</VAR>
is some kind of constant in RTL.  The argument <VAR>mode</VAR> is redundant
except in the case of a <CODE>const_int</CODE> rtx.  Select the section by
calling <CODE>text_section</CODE> or one of the alternatives for other
sections.
<P>

Do not define this macro if you put all constants in the read-only
data section.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1145"></A>
<DT><CODE>JUMP_TABLES_IN_TEXT_SECTION</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if jump tables (for <CODE>tablejump</CODE> insns) should be
output in the text section, along with the assembler instructions.
Otherwise, the readonly data section is used.
<P>

This macro is irrelevant if there is no separate readonly data section.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1146"></A>
<DT><CODE>ENCODE_SECTION_INFO (<VAR>decl</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if references to a symbol must be treated differently
depending on something about the variable or function named by the
symbol (such as what section it is in).
<P>

The macro definition, if any, is executed immediately after the rtl for
<VAR>decl</VAR> has been created and stored in <CODE>DECL_RTL (<VAR>decl</VAR>)</CODE>.
The value of the rtl will be a <CODE>mem</CODE> whose address is a
<CODE>symbol_ref</CODE>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1147"></A>
The usual thing for this macro to do is to record a flag in the
<CODE>symbol_ref</CODE> (such as <CODE>SYMBOL_REF_FLAG</CODE>) or to store a
modified name string in the <CODE>symbol_ref</CODE> (if one bit is not enough
information).

<A NAME="IDX1148"></A>
<DT><CODE>STRIP_NAME_ENCODING (<VAR>var</VAR>, <VAR>sym_name</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Decode <VAR>sym_name</VAR> and store the real name part in <VAR>var</VAR>, sans
the characters that encode section info.  Define this macro if
<CODE>ENCODE_SECTION_INFO</CODE> alters the symbol's name string.

<H2> 14.15 Position Independent Code </H2>
<!--docid::SEC180::-->
<P>

This section describes macros that help implement generation of position
independent code.  Simply defining these macros is not enough to
generate valid PIC; you must also add support to the macros
<CODE>GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS</CODE> and <CODE>LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS</CODE>, and
<CODE>PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS</CODE> as well.  You must modify the definition of
<SAMP>`movsi'</SAMP> to do something appropriate when the source operand
contains a symbolic address.  You may also need to alter the handling of
switch statements so that they use relative addresses.
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1149"></A>
<DT><CODE>PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM</CODE>
<DD>The register number of the register used to address a table of static
data addresses in memory.  In some cases this register is defined by a
processor's "application binary interface" (ABI).  When this macro
is defined, RTL is generated for this register once, as with the stack
pointer and frame pointer registers.  If this macro is not defined, it
is up to the machine-dependent files to allocate such a register (if
necessary).
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1150"></A>
<DT><CODE>FINALIZE_PIC</CODE>
<DD>By generating position-independent code, when two different programs (A
and B) share a common library (libC.a), the text of the library can be
shared whether or not the library is linked at the same address for both
programs.  In some of these environments, position-independent code
requires not only the use of different addressing modes, but also
special code to enable the use of these addressing modes.
<P>

The <CODE>FINALIZE_PIC</CODE> macro serves as a hook to emit these special
codes once the function is being compiled into assembly code, but not
before.  (It is not done before, because in the case of compiling an
inline function, it would lead to multiple PIC prologues being
included in functions which used inline functions and were compiled to
assembly language.)
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1151"></A>
<DT><CODE>LEGITIMATE_PIC_OPERAND_P (<VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression that is nonzero if <VAR>x</VAR> is a legitimate immediate
operand on the target machine when generating position independent code.
You can assume that <VAR>x</VAR> satisfies <CODE>CONSTANT_P</CODE>, so you need not
check this.  You can also assume <VAR>flag_pic</VAR> is true, so you need not
check it either.  You need not define this macro if all constants 
(including <CODE>SYMBOL_REF</CODE>) can be immediate operands when generating 
position independent code.

some appropriate text to go at the start of an assembler file.
<P>

Normally this macro is defined to output a line containing
<SAMP>`#NO_APP'</SAMP>, which is a comment that has no effect on most

<DD>A C statement to output assembler commands which will identify
the object file as having been compiled with GNU CC (or another
GNU compiler).
<P>

If you don't define this macro, the string <SAMP>`gcc_compiled.:'</SAMP>
is output.  This string is calculated to define a symbol which,
on BSD systems, will never be defined for any other reason.
GDB checks for the presence of this symbol when reading the
symbol table of an executable.

<A NAME="IDX1156"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_APP_ON</CODE>
<DD>A C string constant for text to be output before each <CODE>asm</CODE>
statement or group of consecutive ones.  Normally this is
<CODE>"#APP"</CODE>, which is a comment that has no effect on most
assemblers but tells the GNU assembler that it must check the lines
that follow for all valid assembler constructs.

<A NAME="IDX1157"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_APP_OFF</CODE>
<DD>A C string constant for text to be output after each <CODE>asm</CODE>
statement or group of consecutive ones.  Normally this is
<CODE>"#NO_APP"</CODE>, which tells the GNU assembler to resume making the
time-saving assumptions that are valid for ordinary compiler output.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1158"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_FILENAME (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE>

which indicates that filename <VAR>name</VAR> is the current source file to
the stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR>.

instruction to assemble an integer of 16, 8, 4, 2 or 1 bytes,
respectively, whose value is <VAR>value</VAR>.  The argument <VAR>exp</VAR> will
be an RTL expression which represents a constant value.  Use
<SAMP>`output_addr_const (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>exp</VAR>)'</SAMP> to output this value
as an assembler expression.<P>

For sizes larger than <CODE>UNITS_PER_WORD</CODE>, if the action of a macro

a size of <CODE>UNITS_PER_WORD</CODE>, once for each word, you need not define
the macro.

instruction to assemble a single byte containing the number <VAR>value</VAR>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1172"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_BYTE_OP</CODE>
<DD>A C string constant giving the pseudo-op to use for a sequence of

<CODE>"byte"</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1173"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_ASCII (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>ptr</VAR>, <VAR>len</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C statement to output to the stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR> an assembler
instruction to assemble a string constant containing the <VAR>len</VAR>
bytes at <VAR>ptr</VAR>.  <VAR>ptr</VAR> will be a C expression of type
<CODE>char *</CODE> and <VAR>len</VAR> a C expression of type <CODE>int</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1174"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_POOL_PROLOGUE (<VAR>file</VAR> <VAR>funname</VAR> <VAR>fundecl</VAR> <VAR>size</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C statement to output assembler commands to define the start of the
constant pool for a function.  <VAR>funname</VAR> is a string giving
the name of the function.  Should the return type of the function
be required, it can be obtained via <VAR>fundecl</VAR>.  <VAR>size</VAR>
is the size, in bytes, of the constant pool that will be written
immediately after this call.
<P>

If no constant-pool prefix is required, the usual case, this macro need
not be defined.

<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_SPECIAL_POOL_ENTRY (<VAR>file</VAR>, <VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>align</VAR>, <VAR>labelno</VAR>, <VAR>jumpto</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C statement (with or without semicolon) to output a constant in the
constant pool, if it needs special treatment.  (This macro need not do
anything for RTL expressions that can be output normally.)
<P>

The argument <VAR>file</VAR> is the standard I/O stream to output the
assembler code on.  <VAR>x</VAR> is the RTL expression for the constant to
output, and <VAR>mode</VAR> is the machine mode (in case <VAR>x</VAR> is a
<SAMP>`const_int'</SAMP>).  <VAR>align</VAR> is the required alignment for the value
<VAR>x</VAR>; you should output an assembler directive to force this much
alignment.
</P><P>

The argument <VAR>labelno</VAR> is a number to use in an internal label for
the address of this pool entry.  The definition of this macro is
responsible for outputting the label definition at the proper place.
Here is how to do this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL (<VAR>file</VAR>, "LC", <VAR>labelno</VAR>);
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

When you output a pool entry specially, you should end with a
<CODE>goto</CODE> to the label <VAR>jumpto</VAR>.  This will prevent the same pool
entry from being output a second time in the usual manner.

that is, available for reference from other files.  Use the expression

<DD>A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
<VAR>stream</VAR> a reference in assembler syntax to a label named
<VAR>name</VAR>.  This should add <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> to the front of the name, if that
is customary on your operating system, as it is in most Berkeley Unix
systems.  This macro is used in <CODE>assemble_name</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1193"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF_AS_INT (<VAR>file</VAR>, <VAR>label</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro for systems that use the program <CODE>collect2</CODE>.
The definition should be a C statement to output a word containing
a reference to the label <VAR>label</VAR>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1194"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>prefix</VAR>, <VAR>num</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C statement to output to the stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR> a label whose
name is made from the string <VAR>prefix</VAR> and the number <VAR>num</VAR>.
<P>

It is absolutely essential that these labels be distinct from the labels
used for user-level functions and variables.  Otherwise, certain programs
will have name conflicts with internal labels.
</P><P>

It is desirable to exclude internal labels from the symbol table of the
object file.  Most assemblers have a naming convention for labels that
should be excluded; on many systems, the letter <SAMP>`L'</SAMP> at the
beginning of a label has this effect.  You should find out what
convention your system uses, and follow it.
</P><P>

The usual definition of this macro is as follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>fprintf (<VAR>stream</VAR>, "L%s%d:\n", <VAR>prefix</VAR>, <VAR>num</VAR>)
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1195"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (<VAR>string</VAR>, <VAR>prefix</VAR>, <VAR>num</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C statement to store into the string <VAR>string</VAR> a label whose name
is made from the string <VAR>prefix</VAR> and the number <VAR>num</VAR>.
<P>

This string, when output subsequently by <CODE>assemble_name</CODE>,
should produce the same output that <CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL</CODE>
would produce with the same <VAR>prefix</VAR> and <VAR>num</VAR>.
</P><P>

If the string begins with <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>, then <CODE>assemble_name</CODE> will
output the rest of the string unchanged.  It is often convenient for
<CODE>ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL</CODE> to use <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> in this way.  If the
string doesn't start with <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>, then <CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF</CODE> gets
to output the string, and may change it.  (Of course,
<CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF</CODE> is also part of your machine description, so
you should know what it does on your machine.)
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1196"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_FORMAT_PRIVATE_NAME (<VAR>outvar</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>, <VAR>number</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression to assign to <VAR>outvar</VAR> (which is a variable of type
<CODE>char *</CODE>) a newly allocated string made from the string
<VAR>name</VAR> and the number <VAR>number</VAR>, with some suitable punctuation
added.  Use <CODE>alloca</CODE> to get space for the string.
<P>

This string will be used as the argument to <CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF</CODE>
to produce an assembler label for an internal static variable whose
name is <VAR>name</VAR>.  Therefore, the string must be such as to result
in valid assembler code.  The argument <VAR>number</VAR> is different each
time this macro is executed; it prevents conflicts between
similarly-named internal static variables in different scopes.
</P><P>

Ideally this string should not be a valid C identifier, to prevent any
conflict with the user's own symbols.  Most assemblers allow periods
or percent signs in assembler symbols; putting at least one of these
between the name and the number will suffice.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1197"></A>
<DT><CODE>OBJC_GEN_METHOD_LABEL (<VAR>buf</VAR>, <VAR>is_inst</VAR>, <VAR>class_name</VAR>, <VAR>cat_name</VAR>, <VAR>sel_name</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro to override the default assembler names used for
Objective C methods.
<P>

The default name is a unique method number followed by the name of the
class (e.g. <SAMP>`_1_Foo'</SAMP>).  For methods in categories, the name of
the category is also included in the assembler name (e.g.
<SAMP>`_1_Foo_Bar'</SAMP>).
</P><P>

These names are safe on most systems, but make debugging difficult since
the method's selector is not present in the name.  Therefore, particular
systems define other ways of computing names.
</P><P>

<VAR>buf</VAR> is an expression of type <CODE>char *</CODE> which gives you a
buffer in which to store the name; its length is as long as
<VAR>class_name</VAR>, <VAR>cat_name</VAR> and <VAR>sel_name</VAR> put together, plus
50 characters extra.
</P><P>

The argument <VAR>is_inst</VAR> specifies whether the method is an instance
method or a class method; <VAR>class_name</VAR> is the name of the class;
<VAR>cat_name</VAR> is the name of the category (or NULL if the method is not
in a category); and <VAR>sel_name</VAR> is the name of the selector.
</P><P>

On systems where the assembler can handle quoted names, you can use this
macro to provide more human-readable names.

<H3> 14.16.5 How Initialization Functions Are Handled </H3>
<!--docid::SEC186::-->
<P>

The compiled code for certain languages includes <EM>constructors</EM>
(also called <EM>initialization routines</EM>)---functions to initialize
data in the program when the program is started.  These functions need
to be called before the program is "started"---that is to say, before
<CODE>main</CODE> is called.
</P><P>

Compiling some languages generates <EM>destructors</EM> (also called
<EM>termination routines</EM>) that should be called when the program
terminates.
</P><P>

To make the initialization and termination functions work, the compiler
must output something in the assembler code to cause those functions to
be called at the appropriate time.  When you port the compiler to a new
system, you need to specify how to do this.
</P><P>

There are two major ways that GCC currently supports the execution of
initialization and termination functions.  Each way has two variants.
Much of the structure is common to all four variations.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1198"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1199"></A>
The linker must build two lists of these functions--a list of
initialization functions, called <CODE>__CTOR_LIST__</CODE>, and a list of
termination functions, called <CODE>__DTOR_LIST__</CODE>.
</P><P>

Each list always begins with an ignored function pointer (which may hold
0, -1, or a count of the function pointers after it, depending on
the environment).  This is followed by a series of zero or more function
pointers to constructors (or destructors), followed by a function
pointer containing zero.
</P><P>

Depending on the operating system and its executable file format, either
<TT>`crtstuff.c'</TT> or <TT>`libgcc2.c'</TT> traverses these lists at startup
time and exit time.  Constructors are called in forward order of the
list; destructors in reverse order.
</P><P>

The best way to handle static constructors works only for object file
formats which provide arbitrarily-named sections.  A section is set
aside for a list of constructors, and another for a list of destructors.
Traditionally these are called <SAMP>`.ctors'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`.dtors'</SAMP>.  Each
object file that defines an initialization function also puts a word in
the constructor section to point to that function.  The linker
accumulates all these words into one contiguous <SAMP>`.ctors'</SAMP> section.
Termination functions are handled similarly.
</P><P>

To use this method, you need appropriate definitions of the macros
<CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR</CODE> and <CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR</CODE>.  Usually
you can get them by including <TT>`svr4.h'</TT>.
</P><P>

When arbitrary sections are available, there are two variants, depending
upon how the code in <TT>`crtstuff.c'</TT> is called.  On systems that
support an <EM>init</EM> section which is executed at program startup,
parts of <TT>`crtstuff.c'</TT> are compiled into that section.  The
program is linked by the <CODE>gcc</CODE> driver like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>ld -o <VAR>output_file</VAR> crtbegin.o <small>...</small> crtend.o -lgcc
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The head of a function (<CODE>__do_global_ctors</CODE>) appears in the init
section of <TT>`crtbegin.o'</TT>; the remainder of the function appears in
the init section of <TT>`crtend.o'</TT>.  The linker will pull these two
parts of the section together, making a whole function.  If any of the
user's object files linked into the middle of it contribute code, then that
code will be executed as part of the body of <CODE>__do_global_ctors</CODE>.
</P><P>

To use this variant, you must define the <CODE>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</CODE>
macro properly.
</P><P>

If no init section is available, do not define
<CODE>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</CODE>.  Then <CODE>__do_global_ctors</CODE> is built into
the text section like all other functions, and resides in
<TT>`libgcc.a'</TT>.  When GCC compiles any function called <CODE>main</CODE>, it
inserts a procedure call to <CODE>__main</CODE> as the first executable code
after the function prologue.  The <CODE>__main</CODE> function, also defined
in <TT>`libgcc2.c'</TT>, simply calls <TT>`__do_global_ctors'</TT>.
</P><P>

In file formats that don't support arbitrary sections, there are again
two variants.  In the simplest variant, the GNU linker (GNU <CODE>ld</CODE>)
and an `a.out' format must be used.  In this case,
<CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR</CODE> is defined to produce a <CODE>.stabs</CODE>
entry of type <SAMP>`N_SETT'</SAMP>, referencing the name <CODE>__CTOR_LIST__</CODE>,
and with the address of the void function containing the initialization
code as its value.  The GNU linker recognizes this as a request to add
the value to a "set"; the values are accumulated, and are eventually
placed in the executable as a vector in the format described above, with
a leading (ignored) count and a trailing zero element.
<CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR</CODE> is handled similarly.  Since no init
section is available, the absence of <CODE>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</CODE> causes
the compilation of <CODE>main</CODE> to call <CODE>__main</CODE> as above, starting
the initialization process.
</P><P>

The last variant uses neither arbitrary sections nor the GNU linker.
This is preferable when you want to do dynamic linking and when using
file formats which the GNU linker does not support, such as `ECOFF'.  In
this case, <CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR</CODE> does not produce an
<CODE>N_SETT</CODE> symbol; initialization and termination functions are
recognized simply by their names.  This requires an extra program in the
linkage step, called <CODE>collect2</CODE>.  This program pretends to be the
linker, for use with GNU CC; it does its job by running the ordinary
linker, but also arranges to include the vectors of initialization and
termination functions.  These functions are called via <CODE>__main</CODE> as
described above.
</P><P>

Choosing among these configuration options has been simplified by a set
of operating-system-dependent files in the <TT>`config'</TT> subdirectory.
These files define all of the relevant parameters.  Usually it is
sufficient to include one into your specific machine-dependent
configuration file.  These files are:

<H3> 14.16.6 Macros Controlling Initialization Routines </H3>
<!--docid::SEC187::-->
<P>

Here are the macros that control how the compiler handles initialization
and termination functions:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1200"></A>
<DT><CODE>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</CODE>
<DD>If defined, a C string constant for the assembler operation to identify
the following data as initialization code.  If not defined, GNU CC will
assume such a section does not exist.  When you are using special
sections for initialization and termination functions, this macro also
controls how <TT>`crtstuff.c'</TT> and <TT>`libgcc2.c'</TT> arrange to run the
initialization functions.
<P>

<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1201"></A>
Define this macro as a C statement to output on the stream <VAR>stream</VAR>
the assembler code to arrange to call the function named <VAR>name</VAR> at
initialization time.
<P>

Assume that <VAR>name</VAR> is the name of a C function generated
automatically by the compiler.  This function takes no arguments.  Use
the function <CODE>assemble_name</CODE> to output the name <VAR>name</VAR>; this
performs any system-specific syntactic transformations such as adding an
underscore.
</P><P>

If you don't define this macro, nothing special is output to arrange to
call the function.  This is correct when the function will be called in
some other manner--for example, by means of the <CODE>collect2</CODE> program,
which looks through the symbol table to find these functions by their
names.  If you want to use <CODE>collect2</CODE>, then you need to arrange for
it to be built and installed and used on your system.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE>

<H3> 14.16.7 Output of Assembler Instructions </H3>
<!--docid::SEC188::-->
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1206"></A>
<DT><CODE>REGISTER_NAMES</CODE>
<DD>A C initializer containing the assembler's names for the machine
registers, each one as a C string constant.  This is what translates
register numbers in the compiler into assembler language.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1207"></A>
<DT><CODE>ADDITIONAL_REGISTER_NAMES</CODE>
<DD>If defined, a C initializer for an array of structures containing a name
and a register number.  This macro defines additional names for hard
registers, thus allowing the <CODE>asm</CODE> option in declarations to refer
to registers using alternate names.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1208"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_OPCODE (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>ptr</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if you are using an unusual assembler that
requires different names for the machine instructions.
<P>

The definition is a C statement or statements which output an
assembler instruction opcode to the stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR>.  The
macro-operand <VAR>ptr</VAR> is a variable of type <CODE>char *</CODE> which
points to the opcode name in its "internal" form--the form that is
written in the machine description.  The definition should output the
opcode name to <VAR>stream</VAR>, performing any translation you desire, and
increment the variable <VAR>ptr</VAR> to point at the end of the opcode
so that it will not be output twice.
</P><P>

In fact, your macro definition may process less than the entire opcode
name, or more than the opcode name; but if you want to process text
that includes <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>-sequences to substitute operands, you must take
care of the substitution yourself.  Just be sure to increment
<VAR>ptr</VAR> over whatever text should not be output normally.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1209"></A>
If you need to look at the operand values, they can be found as the
elements of <CODE>recog_operand</CODE>.
</P><P>

If the macro definition does nothing, the instruction is output
in the usual way.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1210"></A>
<DT><CODE>FINAL_PRESCAN_INSN (<VAR>insn</VAR>, <VAR>opvec</VAR>, <VAR>noperands</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>If defined, a C statement to be executed just prior to the output of
assembler code for <VAR>insn</VAR>, to modify the extracted operands so
they will be output differently.
<P>

Here the argument <VAR>opvec</VAR> is the vector containing the operands
extracted from <VAR>insn</VAR>, and <VAR>noperands</VAR> is the number of
elements of the vector which contain meaningful data for this insn.
The contents of this vector are what will be used to convert the insn
template into assembler code, so you can change the assembler output
by changing the contents of the vector.
</P><P>

This macro is useful when various assembler syntaxes share a single
file of instruction patterns; by defining this macro differently, you
can cause a large class of instructions to be output differently (such
as with rearranged operands).  Naturally, variations in assembler
syntax affecting individual insn patterns ought to be handled by
writing conditional output routines in those patterns.
</P><P>

If this macro is not defined, it is equivalent to a null statement.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1211"></A>
<DT><CODE>PRINT_OPERAND (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>code</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C compound statement to output to stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR> the
assembler syntax for an instruction operand <VAR>x</VAR>.  <VAR>x</VAR> is an
RTL expression.
<P>

<VAR>code</VAR> is a value that can be used to specify one of several ways
of printing the operand.  It is used when identical operands must be
printed differently depending on the context.  <VAR>code</VAR> comes from
the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> specification that was used to request printing of the
operand.  If the specification was just <SAMP>`%<VAR>digit</VAR>'</SAMP> then
<VAR>code</VAR> is 0; if the specification was <SAMP>`%<VAR>ltr</VAR>
<VAR>digit</VAR>'</SAMP> then <VAR>code</VAR> is the ASCII code for <VAR>ltr</VAR>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1212"></A>
If <VAR>x</VAR> is a register, this macro should print the register's name.
The names can be found in an array <CODE>reg_names</CODE> whose type is
<CODE>char *[]</CODE>.  <CODE>reg_names</CODE> is initialized from
<CODE>REGISTER_NAMES</CODE>.
</P><P>

When the machine description has a specification <SAMP>`%<VAR>punct</VAR>'</SAMP>
(a <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> followed by a punctuation character), this macro is called
with a null pointer for <VAR>x</VAR> and the punctuation character for
<VAR>code</VAR>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1213"></A>
<DT><CODE>PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P (<VAR>code</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression which evaluates to true if <VAR>code</VAR> is a valid
punctuation character for use in the <CODE>PRINT_OPERAND</CODE> macro.  If
<CODE>PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P</CODE> is not defined, it means that no
punctuation characters (except for the standard one, <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>) are used
in this way.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1214"></A>
<DT><CODE>PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C compound statement to output to stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR> the
assembler syntax for an instruction operand that is a memory reference
whose address is <VAR>x</VAR>.  <VAR>x</VAR> is an RTL expression.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1215"></A>
On some machines, the syntax for a symbolic address depends on the
section that the address refers to.  On these machines, define the macro
<CODE>ENCODE_SECTION_INFO</CODE> to store the information into the
<CODE>symbol_ref</CODE>, and then check for it here.  See section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC181">14.16 Defining the Output Assembler Language</A>.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1216"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1217"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBR_OUTPUT_SEQEND(<VAR>file</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C statement, to be executed after all slot-filler instructions have
been output.  If necessary, call <CODE>dbr_sequence_length</CODE> to
determine the number of slots filled in a sequence (zero if not
currently outputting a sequence), to decide how many no-ops to output,
or whatever.
<P>

Don't define this macro if it has nothing to do, but it is helpful in
reading assembly output if the extent of the delay sequence is made
explicit (e.g. with white space).
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1218"></A>
Note that output routines for instructions with delay slots must be
prepared to deal with not being output as part of a sequence (i.e.
when the scheduling pass is not run, or when no slot fillers could be
found.)  The variable <CODE>final_sequence</CODE> is null when not
processing a sequence, otherwise it contains the <CODE>sequence</CODE> rtx
being output.

<SAMP>`%U'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`%I'</SAMP> options of <CODE>asm_fprintf</CODE> (see

<P>

The definition should be a C statement to output to the stdio stream
<VAR>stream</VAR> an assembler pseudo-instruction to generate a difference

<!--docid::SEC193::-->
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1239"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_DEBUGGING_INFO</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if GNU CC should produce debugging output for DBX
in response to the <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> option.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1240"></A>
<DT><CODE>XCOFF_DEBUGGING_INFO</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if GNU CC should produce XCOFF format debugging output
in response to the <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> option.  This is a variant of DBX format.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1241"></A>
<DT><CODE>DEFAULT_GDB_EXTENSIONS</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro to control whether GNU CC should by default generate
GDB's extended version of DBX debugging information (assuming DBX-format
debugging information is enabled at all).  If you don't define the
macro, the default is 1: always generate the extended information
if there is any occasion to.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1242"></A>
<DT><CODE>DEBUG_SYMS_TEXT</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if all <CODE>.stabs</CODE> commands should be output while
in the text section.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1243"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_STABS_OP</CODE>
<DD>A C string constant naming the assembler pseudo op to use instead of
<CODE>.stabs</CODE> to define an ordinary debugging symbol.  If you don't
define this macro, <CODE>.stabs</CODE> is used.  This macro applies only to
DBX debugging information format.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1244"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_STABD_OP</CODE>
<DD>A C string constant naming the assembler pseudo op to use instead of
<CODE>.stabd</CODE> to define a debugging symbol whose value is the current
location.  If you don't define this macro, <CODE>.stabd</CODE> is used.
This macro applies only to DBX debugging information format.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1245"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_STABN_OP</CODE>
<DD>A C string constant naming the assembler pseudo op to use instead of
<CODE>.stabn</CODE> to define a debugging symbol with no name.  If you don't
define this macro, <CODE>.stabn</CODE> is used.  This macro applies only to
DBX debugging information format.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1246"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_NO_XREFS</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if DBX on your system does not support the construct
<SAMP>`xs<VAR>tagname</VAR>'</SAMP>.  On some systems, this construct is used to
describe a forward reference to a structure named <VAR>tagname</VAR>.
On other systems, this construct is not supported at all.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1247"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_CONTIN_LENGTH</CODE>
<DD>A symbol name in DBX-format debugging information is normally
continued (split into two separate <CODE>.stabs</CODE> directives) when it
exceeds a certain length (by default, 80 characters).  On some
operating systems, DBX requires this splitting; on others, splitting
must not be done.  You can inhibit splitting by defining this macro
with the value zero.  You can override the default splitting-length by
defining this macro as an expression for the length you desire.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1248"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_CONTIN_CHAR</CODE>
<DD>Normally continuation is indicated by adding a <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> character to
the end of a <CODE>.stabs</CODE> string when a continuation follows.  To use
a different character instead, define this macro as a character
constant for the character you want to use.  Do not define this macro
if backslash is correct for your system.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1249"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_STATIC_STAB_DATA_SECTION</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if it is necessary to go to the data section before
outputting the <SAMP>`.stabs'</SAMP> pseudo-op for a non-global static
variable.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1250"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_TYPE_DECL_STABS_CODE</CODE>

for a typedef.  The default is <CODE>N_LSYM</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1251"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_STATIC_CONST_VAR_CODE</CODE>
<DD>The value to use in the "code" field of the <CODE>.stabs</CODE> directive
for a static variable located in the text section.  DBX format does not
provide any "right" way to do this.  The default is <CODE>N_FUN</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1252"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_REGPARM_STABS_CODE</CODE>
<DD>The value to use in the "code" field of the <CODE>.stabs</CODE> directive
for a parameter passed in registers.  DBX format does not provide any
"right" way to do this.  The default is <CODE>N_RSYM</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1253"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_REGPARM_STABS_LETTER</CODE>
<DD>The letter to use in DBX symbol data to identify a symbol as a parameter
passed in registers.  DBX format does not customarily provide any way to
do this.  The default is <CODE>'P'</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1254"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_MEMPARM_STABS_LETTER</CODE>
<DD>The letter to use in DBX symbol data to identify a symbol as a stack
parameter.  The default is <CODE>'p'</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1255"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_FUNCTION_FIRST</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if the DBX information for a function and its
arguments should precede the assembler code for the function.  Normally,
in DBX format, the debugging information entirely follows the assembler
code.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1256"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_LBRAC_FIRST</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if the <CODE>N_LBRAC</CODE> symbol for a block should
precede the debugging information for variables and functions defined in
that block.  Normally, in DBX format, the <CODE>N_LBRAC</CODE> symbol comes
first.

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX1257"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_OUTPUT_LBRAC (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro to say how to output to <VAR>stream</VAR> the debugging
information for the start of a scope level for variable names.  The
argument <VAR>name</VAR> is the name of an assembler symbol (for use with
<CODE>assemble_name</CODE>) whose value is the address where the scope begins.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1258"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_OUTPUT_RBRAC (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Like <CODE>DBX_OUTPUT_LBRAC</CODE>, but for the end of a scope level.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1259"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_OUTPUT_ENUM (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if the target machine requires special handling to
output an enumeration type.  The definition should be a C statement
(sans semicolon) to output the appropriate information to <VAR>stream</VAR>
for the type <VAR>type</VAR>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1260"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_OUTPUT_FUNCTION_END (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>function</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if the target machine requires special output at the
end of the debugging information for a function.  The definition should
be a C statement (sans semicolon) to output the appropriate information
to <VAR>stream</VAR>.  <VAR>function</VAR> is the <CODE>FUNCTION_DECL</CODE> node for
the function.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1261"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_OUTPUT_STANDARD_TYPES (<VAR>syms</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if you need to control the order of output of the
standard data types at the beginning of compilation.  The argument
<VAR>syms</VAR> is a <CODE>tree</CODE> which is a chain of all the predefined
global symbols, including names of data types.
<P>

Normally, DBX output starts with definitions of the types for integers
and characters, followed by all the other predefined types of the
particular language in no particular order.
</P><P>

On some machines, it is necessary to output different particular types
first.  To do this, define <CODE>DBX_OUTPUT_STANDARD_TYPES</CODE> to output
those symbols in the necessary order.  Any predefined types that you
don't explicitly output will be output afterward in no particular order.
</P><P>

Be careful not to define this macro so that it works only for C.  There
are no global variables to access most of the built-in types, because
another language may have another set of types.  The way to output a
particular type is to look through <VAR>syms</VAR> to see if you can find it.
Here is an example:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>{
  tree decl;
  for (decl = syms; decl; decl = TREE_CHAIN (decl))
    if (!strcmp (IDENTIFIER_POINTER (DECL_NAME (decl)), "long int"))
      dbxout_symbol (decl);
  <small>...</small>
}
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

This does nothing if the expected type does not exist.
</P><P>

See the function <CODE>init_decl_processing</CODE> in source file
<TT>`c-decl.c'</TT> to find the names to use for all the built-in C types.
</P><P>

Here is another way of finding a particular type:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>{
  tree decl;
  for (decl = syms; decl; decl = TREE_CHAIN (decl))
    if (TREE_CODE (decl) == TYPE_DECL
        &#38;&#38; TREE_CODE (TREE_TYPE (decl)) == INTEGER_CST
        &#38;&#38; TYPE_PRECISION (TREE_TYPE (decl)) == 16
        &#38;&#38; TYPE_UNSIGNED (TREE_TYPE (decl)))
      /* This must be <CODE>unsigned short</CODE>.  */
      dbxout_symbol (decl);
  <small>...</small>

<H2> 14.18 Cross Compilation and Floating Point Format </H2>
<!--docid::SEC197::-->
<P>

While all modern machines use 2's complement representation for integers,
there are a variety of representations for floating point numbers.  This
means that in a cross-compiler the representation of floating point numbers
in the compiled program may be different from that used in the machine
doing the compilation.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1274"></A>
Because different representation systems may offer different amounts of
range and precision, the cross compiler cannot safely use the host
machine's floating point arithmetic.  Therefore, floating point constants
must be represented in the target machine's format.  This means that the
cross compiler cannot use <CODE>atof</CODE> to parse a floating point constant;
it must have its own special routine to use instead.  Also, constant
folding must emulate the target machine's arithmetic (or must not be done
at all).
</P><P>

The macros in the following table should be defined only if you are cross
compiling between different floating point formats.
</P><P>

Otherwise, don't define them. Then default definitions will be set up which
use <CODE>double</CODE> as the data type, <CODE>==</CODE> to test for equality, etc.
</P><P>

You don't need to worry about how many times you use an operand of any
of these macros.  The compiler never uses operands which have side effects.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>PREDICATE_CODES</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1297"></A>
Optionally define this if you have added predicates to
<TT>`<VAR>machine</VAR>.c'</TT>.  This macro is called within an initializer of an
array of structures.  The first field in the structure is the name of a
predicate and the second field is an array of rtl codes.  For each
predicate, list all rtl codes that can be in expressions matched by the
predicate.  The list should have a trailing comma.  Here is an example
of two entries in the list for a typical RISC machine:
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define PREDICATE_CODES \
  {"gen_reg_rtx_operand", {SUBREG, REG}},  \
  {"reg_or_short_cint_operand", {SUBREG, REG, CONST_INT}},
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Defining this macro does not affect the generated code (however,
incorrect definitions that omit an rtl code that may be matched by the
predicate can cause the compiler to malfunction).  Instead, it allows
the table built by <TT>`genrecog'</TT> to be more compact and efficient,
thus speeding up the compiler.  The most important predicates to include
in the list specified by this macro are thoses used in the most insn
patterns.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1298"></A>
<DT><CODE>CASE_VECTOR_MODE</CODE>
<DD>An alias for a machine mode name.  This is the machine mode that
elements of a jump-table should have.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1299"></A>
<DT><CODE>CASE_VECTOR_PC_RELATIVE</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if jump-tables should contain relative addresses.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1300"></A>
<DT><CODE>CASE_DROPS_THROUGH</CODE>
<DD>Define this if control falls through a <CODE>case</CODE> insn when the index
value is out of range.  This means the specified default-label is
actually ignored by the <CODE>case</CODE> insn proper.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1301"></A>
<DT><CODE>CASE_VALUES_THRESHOLD</CODE>
<DD>Define this to be the smallest number of different values for which it
is best to use a jump-table instead of a tree of conditional branches.
The default is four for machines with a <CODE>casesi</CODE> instruction and
five otherwise.  This is best for most machines.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1302"></A>
<DT><CODE>BYTE_LOADS_ZERO_EXTEND</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if an instruction to load a value narrower than a
word from memory into a register also zero-extends the value to the whole 
register.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1303"></A>
<DT><CODE>BYTE_LOADS_SIGN_EXTEND</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if an instruction to load a value narrower than a
word from memory into a register also sign-extends the value to the whole 
register.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1304"></A>
<DT><CODE>IMPLICIT_FIX_EXPR</CODE>
<DD>An alias for a tree code that should be used by default for conversion
of floating point values to fixed point.  Normally,
<CODE>FIX_ROUND_EXPR</CODE> is used.<P>

<A NAME="IDX1305"></A>
<DT><CODE>FIXUNS_TRUNC_LIKE_FIX_TRUNC</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if the same instructions that convert a floating
point number to a signed fixed point number also convert validly to an
unsigned one.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1306"></A>
<DT><CODE>EASY_DIV_EXPR</CODE>
<DD>An alias for a tree code that is the easiest kind of division to
compile code for in the general case.  It may be
<CODE>TRUNC_DIV_EXPR</CODE>, <CODE>FLOOR_DIV_EXPR</CODE>, <CODE>CEIL_DIV_EXPR</CODE> or
<CODE>ROUND_DIV_EXPR</CODE>.  These four division operators differ in how
they round the result to an integer.  <CODE>EASY_DIV_EXPR</CODE> is used
when it is permissible to use any of those kinds of division and the
choice should be made on the basis of efficiency.<P>

<A NAME="IDX1307"></A>
<DT><CODE>MOVE_MAX</CODE>
<DD>The maximum number of bytes that a single instruction can move quickly
from memory to memory.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1308"></A>
<DT><CODE>SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED</CODE>
<DD>Defining this macro causes the compiler to omit a sign-extend,
zero-extend, or bitwise `and' instruction that truncates the count of a
shift operation to a width equal to the number of bits needed to
represent the size of the object being shifted.  On machines that have
instructions that act on bitfields at variable positions, which may
include `bit test' instructions, defining <CODE>SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED</CODE>
also enables deletion of truncations of the values that serve as
arguments to bitfield instructions.
<P>

If both types of instructions truncate the count (for shifts) and
position (for bitfield operations), or if no variable-position bitfield
instructions exist, you should define this macro.
</P><P>

However, on some machines, such as the 80386 and the 680x0, truncation
only applies to shift operations and not the (real or pretended)
bitfield operations.  Do not define <CODE>SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED</CODE> on such
machines.  Instead, add patterns to the <TT>`md'</TT> file that include the
implied truncation of the shift instructions.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1309"></A>
<DT><CODE>TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION (<VAR>outprec</VAR>, <VAR>inprec</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression which is nonzero if on this machine it is safe to
"convert" an integer of <VAR>inprec</VAR> bits to one of <VAR>outprec</VAR>
bits (where <VAR>outprec</VAR> is smaller than <VAR>inprec</VAR>) by merely
operating on it as if it had only <VAR>outprec</VAR> bits.
<P>

On many machines, this expression can be 1.
</P><P>

It is reported that suboptimal code can result when
<CODE>TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION</CODE> returns 1 for a pair of sizes for modes for
which <CODE>MODES_TIEABLE_P</CODE> is 0.  If this is the case, making
<CODE>TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION</CODE> return 0 in such cases may improve things.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1310"></A>
<DT><CODE>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE>
<DD>A C expression describing the value returned by a comparison operator
with an integral mode and stored by a store-flag instruction
(<SAMP>`s<VAR>cond</VAR>'</SAMP>) when the condition is true.  This description must
apply to <EM>all</EM> the <SAMP>`s<VAR>cond</VAR>'</SAMP> patterns and all the
comparison operators whose results have a <CODE>MODE_INT</CODE> mode.
<P>

A value of 1 or -1 means that the instruction implementing the
comparison operator returns exactly 1 or -1 when the comparison is true
and 0 when the comparison is false.  Otherwise, the value indicates
which bits of the result are guaranteed to be 1 when the comparison is
true.  This value is interpreted in the mode of the comparison
operation, which is given by the mode of the first operand in the
<SAMP>`s<VAR>cond</VAR>'</SAMP> pattern.  Either the low bit or the sign bit of
<CODE>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE> be on.  Presently, only those bits are used by
the compiler.
</P><P>

If <CODE>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE> is neither 1 or -1, the compiler will
generate code that depends only on the specified bits.  It can also
replace comparison operators with equivalent operations if they cause
the required bits to be set, even if the remaining bits are undefined.
For example, on a machine whose comparison operators return an
<CODE>SImode</CODE> value and where <CODE>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE> is defined as
<SAMP>`0x80000000'</SAMP>, saying that just the sign bit is relevant, the
expression
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(ne:SI (and:SI <VAR>x</VAR> (const_int <VAR>power-of-2</VAR>)) (const_int 0))
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

can be converted to
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>(ashift:SI <VAR>x</VAR> (const_int <VAR>n</VAR>))
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

where <VAR>n</VAR> is the appropriate shift count to move the bit being
tested into the sign bit.
</P><P>

There is no way to describe a machine that always sets the low-order bit
for a true value, but does not guarantee the value of any other bits,
but we do not know of any machine that has such an instruction.  If you
are trying to port GNU CC to such a machine, include an instruction to
perform a logical-and of the result with 1 in the pattern for the
comparison operators and let us know (see section <A HREF="gcc.html#SEC92">6.3 How to Report Bugs</A>).
</P><P>

Often, a machine will have multiple instructions that obtain a value
from a comparison (or the condition codes).  Here are rules to guide the
choice of value for <CODE>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE>, and hence the instructions
to be used:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
Use the shortest sequence that yields a valid definition for
<CODE>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE>.  It is more efficient for the compiler to
"normalize" the value (convert it to, e.g., 1 or 0) than for the
comparison operators to do so because there may be opportunities to
combine the normalization with other operations.
<P>

<LI>
For equal-length sequences, use a value of 1 or -1, with -1 being
slightly preferred on machines with expensive jumps and 1 preferred on
other machines.
<P>

<LI>
As a second choice, choose a value of <SAMP>`0x80000001'</SAMP> if instructions
exist that set both the sign and low-order bits but do not define the
others.
<P>

<LI>
Otherwise, use a value of <SAMP>`0x80000000'</SAMP>.
</UL>
<P>

You need not define <CODE>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE> if the machine has no store-flag
instructions.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1311"></A>
<DT><CODE>FLOAT_STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE>
<DD>A C expression that gives a non-zero floating point value that is
returned when comparison operators with floating-point results are true.
Define this macro on machine that have comparison operations that return
floating-point values.  If there are no such operations, do not define
this macro.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1312"></A>
<DT><CODE>Pmode</CODE>
<DD>An alias for the machine mode for pointers.  Normally the definition
can be
<P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#define Pmode SImode
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1313"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_MODE</CODE>
<DD>An alias for the machine mode used for memory references to functions
being called, in <CODE>call</CODE> RTL expressions.  On most machines this
should be <CODE>QImode</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1314"></A>
<DT><CODE>INTEGRATE_THRESHOLD (<VAR>decl</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>A C expression for the maximum number of instructions above which the
function <VAR>decl</VAR> should not be inlined.  <VAR>decl</VAR> is a
<CODE>FUNCTION_DECL</CODE> node.
<P>

The default definition of this macro is 64 plus 8 times the number of
arguments that the function accepts.  Some people think a larger
threshold should be used on RISC machines.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1315"></A>
<DT><CODE>SCCS_DIRECTIVE</CODE>
<DD>Define this if the preprocessor should ignore <CODE>#sccs</CODE> directives
and print no error message.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1316"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1317"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1318"></A>
<DT><CODE>HANDLE_PRAGMA (<VAR>stream</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if you want to implement any pragmas.  If defined, it
should be a C statement to be executed when <CODE>#pragma</CODE> is seen.  The
argument <VAR>stream</VAR> is the stdio input stream from which the source
text can be read.
<P>

It is generally a bad idea to implement new uses of <CODE>#pragma</CODE>.  The
only reason to define this macro is for compatibility with other
compilers that do support <CODE>#pragma</CODE> for the sake of any user
programs which already use it.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1319"></A>
<DT><CODE>DOLLARS_IN_IDENTIFIERS</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro to control use of the character <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> in identifier
names.  The value should be 0, 1, or 2.  0 means <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> is not allowed
by default; 1 means it is allowed by default if <SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP> is
used; 2 means it is allowed by default provided <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> is not used.
1 is the default; there is no need to define this macro in that case.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1320"></A>
<DT><CODE>NO_DOLLAR_IN_LABEL</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if the assembler does not accept the character
<SAMP>`$'</SAMP> in label names.  By default constructors and destructors in
G++ have <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> in the identifiers.  If this macro is defined,
<SAMP>`.'</SAMP> is used instead.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1321"></A>
<DT><CODE>DEFAULT_MAIN_RETURN</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro if the target system expects every program's <CODE>main</CODE>
function to return a standard "success" value by default (if no other
value is explicitly returned).
<P>

The definition should be a C statement (sans semicolon) to generate the
appropriate rtl instructions.  It is used only when compiling the end of
<CODE>main</CODE>.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>HAVE_ATEXIT</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1322"></A>
Define this if the target system supports the function
<CODE>atexit</CODE> from the ANSI C standard.  If this is not defined,
and <CODE>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</CODE> is not defined, a default
<CODE>exit</CODE> function will be provided to support C++.
<P>

<DT><CODE>EXIT_BODY</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1323"></A>
Define this if your <CODE>exit</CODE> function needs to do something
besides calling an external function <CODE>_cleanup</CODE> before
terminating with <CODE>_exit</CODE>.  The <CODE>EXIT_BODY</CODE> macro is
only needed if netiher <CODE>HAVE_ATEXIT</CODE> nor
<CODE>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</CODE> are defined.

The configuration file <TT>`xm-<VAR>machine</VAR>.h'</TT> contains macro

<P>

<A NAME="IDX1337"></A>
<DT><CODE>OBSTACK_CHUNK_ALLOC</CODE>
<DD>The function used to allocate obstack chunks.
If you don't define this, <CODE>xmalloc</CODE> is used.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1338"></A>
<DT><CODE>OBSTACK_CHUNK_FREE</CODE>
<DD>The function used to free obstack chunks.
If you don't define this, <CODE>free</CODE> is used.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1339"></A>
<DT><CODE>USE_C_ALLOCA</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro to indicate that the compiler is running with the
<CODE>alloca</CODE> implemented in C.  This version of <CODE>alloca</CODE> can be
found in the file <TT>`alloca.c'</TT>; to use it, you must also alter the
<TT>`Makefile'</TT> variable <CODE>ALLOCA</CODE>.  (This is done automatically
for the systems on which we know it is needed.)
<P>

If you do define this macro, you should probably do it as follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>#ifndef __GNUC__
#define USE_C_ALLOCA
#else
#define alloca __builtin_alloca
#endif
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

so that when the compiler is compiled with GNU CC it uses the more
efficient built-in <CODE>alloca</CODE> function.
</P><P>

<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_CONVERSION_BUG</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1340"></A>
Define this macro to indicate that the host compiler does not properly
handle converting a function value to a pointer-to-function when it is
used in an expression.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1341"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1342"></A>
<DT><CODE>HAVE_VPRINTF</CODE>
<DD>Define this if the library function <CODE>vprintf</CODE> is available on your
system.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1343"></A>
<DT><CODE>MULTIBYTE_CHARS</CODE>
<DD>Define this macro to enable support for multibyte characters in the
input to GNU CC.  This requires that the host system support the ANSI C
library functions for converting multibyte characters to wide
characters.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1344"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1345"></A>
<DT><CODE>HAVE_PUTENV</CODE>
<DD>Define this if the library function <CODE>putenv</CODE> is available on your
system.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1346"></A>
<DT><CODE>NO_SYS_SIGLIST</CODE>
<DD>Define this if your system <EM>does not</EM> provide the variable
<CODE>sys_siglist</CODE>.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1347"></A>
<DT><CODE>USE_PROTOTYPES</CODE>
<DD>Define this to be 1 if you know that the host compiler supports
prototypes, even if it doesn't define __STDC__, or define
it to be 0 if you do not want any prototypes used in compiling
GNU CC.  If <SAMP>`USE_PROTOTYPES'</SAMP> is not defined, it will be
determined automatically whether your compiler supports
prototypes by checking if <SAMP>`__STDC__'</SAMP> is defined.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1348"></A>
<DT><CODE>NO_MD_PROTOTYPES</CODE>
<DD>Define this if you wish suppression of prototypes generated from
the machine description file, but to use other prototypes within
GNU CC.  If <SAMP>`USE_PROTOTYPES'</SAMP> is defined to be 0, or the
host compiler does not support prototypes, this macro has no
effect.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1349"></A>
<DT><CODE>MD_CALL_PROTOTYPES</CODE>
<DD>Define this if you wish to generate prototypes for the
<CODE>gen_call</CODE> or <CODE>gen_call_value</CODE> functions generated from
the machine description file.  If <SAMP>`USE_PROTOTYPES'</SAMP> is
defined to be 0, or the host compiler does not support
prototypes, or <SAMP>`NO_MD_PROTOTYPES'</SAMP> is defined, this macro has
no effect.  As soon as all of the machine descriptions are
modified to have the appropriate number of arguments, this macro
will be removed.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1350"></A>
Some systems do provide this variable, but with a different name such
as <CODE>_sys_siglist</CODE>.  On these systems, you can define
<CODE>sys_siglist</CODE> as a macro which expands into the name actually
provided.
</P><P>

<A NAME="IDX1351"></A>
<DT><CODE>NO_STAB_H</CODE>
<DD>Define this if your system does not have the include file
<TT>`stab.h'</TT>.  If <SAMP>`USG'</SAMP> is defined, <SAMP>`NO_STAB_H'</SAMP> is
assumed.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="IDX1352"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1353"></A>
In addition, configuration files for system V define <CODE>bcopy</CODE>,
<CODE>bzero</CODE> and <CODE>bcmp</CODE> as aliases.  Some files define <CODE>alloca</CODE>
as a macro when compiled with GNU CC, in order to take advantage of the
benefit of GNU CC's built-in <CODE>alloca</CODE>.
