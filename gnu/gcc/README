The following sub-directories contain compressed tar files of the
gcc-1.40 executables for different architectures.  After obtaining the
file for the wanted architecture, do the following (we assume that
<GCCPATH> is where you have put the compressed tar file):

1). Become s(uper)u(ser)
2). cd /usr/local
3). cat <GCCPATH>/gcc-1.40.tar.Z | uncompress | tar xf -
4). ranlib lib/gcc-gnulib
5). Done
