This would have gone out last week, but our news machine was down.  My
apologies ......

I had a look at gcc-1.40 over the weekend, and now have it running on both
68k and 386.  Enclosed below are the relevant patches.

Instructions for use:

(a).  You must have an existing version of gcc on your system.  If you
      havn't, get one from plains.  I havn't attempted to bootstrap 1.40
      with anything other than gcc, so if you want to try it you are on your
      own.  You'll need gas and gld from plains anyway.

(b).  Get a virgin copy of gcc-1.40 from your favourite GNU archive site.

(c).  Unpack the patches below - this is a uuencoded 13-bit compressed tar
      archive.

(d).  Copy the xm* and tm* files into gcc-1.40/config, and the conf* files 
      into gcc-1.40.

(e).  Apply the patches - all the files ending in .cd are cdiffs.

(f).  Don't run config.gcc, but use conf.minix68k or conf.minix386 as
      appropriate for your system.

(g).  Hit "make" and wait.  On a 33MHz 386 compilation will take about 30
      minutes.  On an Atari ST expect several hours (!).

I strongly suggest using stage1 and stage2 as per the INSTALL instructions
with the gcc sources.  On the ST, gcc passed the (stage2 == stage3) test with
no problems.  On the 386 I needed an extra iteration for some non-obvious
reason.  The 386 version has successfully compiled mm and fs for a running
kernel - I havn't had the chance to try the 68k version yet.

Enjoy.
