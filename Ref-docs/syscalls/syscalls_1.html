<P>
The scope of the specifications is general enough to serve for
specification document for designing Linux personalities for
microkernels or for creating Linux compatible libraries. It contains the
complete specifications of the interface. The description of each
syscall contains a rough sketch (almost pseudo-code) of the code that needs
written in order to implement the syscall correctly for Linux compatiblity.
<P>
This information is accurate as of version 1.0 of Linux.
