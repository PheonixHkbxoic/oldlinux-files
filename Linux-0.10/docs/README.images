This tar file contains new disk images for Linux 0.10 boot floppies

bootimage.Z	Contains the Linux 0.10 boot floppy image, with the
		patch to buffers.c included to avoid disk corruption
		problems when two processes are thrashing the buffer
		cache.

bootimage-ncaps.Z
		As above, except it also includes a patch to keyboard.S
		so that the caps lock key acts as a control key.
		(You never need a caps lock key when you're using Unix
		anyway  :-)
