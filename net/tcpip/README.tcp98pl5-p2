This diff fixes some problems with the first diff, and corrects a few
error returns.  Hopefully some of the problems with accept, connect,
and shutdown should have vanished.  Again these are not really against
pl5 but against pl4 + some of the pl5 diffs + patch1.  You may need to
do these by hand also.
