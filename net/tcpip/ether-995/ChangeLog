	* 8390.c: Commented out 'high_water_mark', since it's
	  never set and results in an 'unused variable' warning.

	* hp.c: Deleted the 'int i;' from hp_block_output() --
	  it's unused now that port_write_b() is used instead
	  of an explicit loop.

	* ne.c: Added explicit support for D-Link ethercards.

	* hp.c: Changed the 8-bit output and input loops to use
	port_{read,write?_b() instead.  Assigned dev->irq before
	sigaction() is call to avoid the 3c503 problem (below).

	* 3c503.c: Fixed a wild I/O port write in the probe code that had
	been added to mask interrupts during probes.  Also assigned dev->irq
	before sigaction() is called to correctly handle that spurious
	first interrupt.

	* wd.c: Changed the IRQ from the unreliable autoIRQ to reading the
	configuation register.  I also go a report that it still works
	with the 8003

	* 3c503: Added EL2_AUI as an alias for EI8390_THICK, and rewrote
	the IRQ selection code.  It now does assigns the first free IRQ
	from the list { 5 2/9 3 4 }.

	* GNUmakefile: Changed the default name from "eth_if" to "eth0" to
	be compatible.  Also changed the name of EI8390_THICK to EL2_AUI.

	* 8390.c: Omitted incrementing ei_debug during a rx_overrun.

	* ne.c: I put the a ctron check inside of #ifdef EI_8BIT
	  so that 8-bit Cabletron card are recognized.
