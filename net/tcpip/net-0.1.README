README for net-src-0.1.tar.Z and net-bin-0.1.tar.Z

Included are ftp, ftpd, telnet, telnetd, inetd, named, nslookup and ping.

These are libc-4.1 versions of various net programs, both
source and binaries.  They are from bsd-net2 with very minimal
changes.  The telnet port is based on the one from Pete Chown.

Yes, this telnet/telnetd really works.  I think.  This is only
a pre-release.  Let me know if there are any problems.
