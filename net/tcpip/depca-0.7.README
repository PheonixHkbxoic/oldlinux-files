Subject: new depca-0.7 for pl13
Date: 26 Sep 93 18:31:24 EDT

Find enclosed depca-0.7. This version patches against the limux99pl13
kernel sources and shoud go where the other depca-driver went (I think
somewhere in Linux/BETA/depca). From the older versions there only the 
0.5 version is worth keeping, because it patches against pl10 and 11.

Gruss PB
