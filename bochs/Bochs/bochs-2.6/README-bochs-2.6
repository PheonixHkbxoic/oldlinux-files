Detailed change log :

- CPU
  - Implemented EPT A/D extensions support.
    Bochs is fully aligned with rev043 of the of Intel(R) Architecture Manual.
  - Implemented ADX (ADCX/ADOX) instructions support, the feature can
    be enabled using .bochsrc CPUID option.
  - More than 10% CPU emulation speedup with even more optimal lazy flags
    handling, stack access optimizations and cross branch trace linking.
  - Support for AMD's SVM hardware emulation in Bochs CPU, to enable
    configure with --enable-svm option
  - Implemented AMD Extended XAPIC support, to enable set .bochsrc CPU
    APIC option to 'xapic_ext'
  ! Added Corei5 750 (Lynnfield) configuration to the CPUDB
  ! Added Turion64 (Tyler) configuration to the CPUDB
  ! Added AMD Phenom X3 8650 (Toliman) configuration to the CPUDB
  ! Added Corei7 3770K (Ivy Bridge) configuration to the CPUDB
  - Bugfixes for CPU emulation correctness and stability
    (critical fixes for APIC/X2APIC, VMX and AVX/XOP emulation)

- Bochs Debugger and Instrumentation
  - Implemented new debugger command 'info device [string]' that shows the
    state of the device specified in 'string'
  - Improved debug dump for ne2k, pci, pic and vga/cirrus devices. Added
    debug dump for pci2isa, i/o apic, cmos, pit, floppy and dma devices.
  - Added TLB to CPU param tree - now it can be browsed from Bochs internal
    debugger and Bochs debugger GUI through param tree interfaces
  - Implemented 'writemem' debugger command to dump virtual memory block
    starting from selected linear address into a file
  - Updated definition of instrumentation callbacks, see description in
    instrumentation.txt / Fixed instrumentation examples

- Configure and compile
  - Moved disk imaging, networking, sound and USB devices to subdirectories
    in the iodev folder.
  - pcidev: enable support for Linux kernel 3.x (Debian patch by Guillem Jover)
  - debugger: generate parser / lexer files only if all required tools are present

- Config interface
  - Added support for direct device plugin loading with bochsrc directive for
    devices which have the same name for the plugin and config option.
  - The bochsrc option 'plugin_ctrl' can now be used to load/unload optional
    plugins directly when parsing the config file or command line. See the bochsrc
    sample for supported devices.
  - Moved bochsrc parsing / writing and config parameter handling for networking,
    sound and USB devices to the plugin device code. The options are only
    available when the corresponding plugin device is loaded.
  - Added ability to set log action per device from .bochsrc.
  - Added new command line option '-noconsole' to disable the console
    window on Windows host.
  - Renamed PCI Pseudo NIC option to "pcipnic" (for direct plugin loading)
  - Moved several related options to the new "keyboard" bochsrc option.
  - Added new parameter 'rtc_sync' for the 'clock' option. If this option
    is enabled together with the realtime synchronization, the RTC runs
    at realtime speed.
  - Moved MWAIT_IS_NOP bochsrc option from CPUID to CPU so it can be set
    even if cpu was configured using pre-defined CPUDB profile.
  - Allow larger CPU 'quantum' values when emulating SMP systems for speed
    (quantum values up to 32 are allowed now).

- I/O Devices
  - Networking
    - Ported Intel(R) 82540EM Gigabit Ethernet adapter emulation from Qemu,
      to enable configure with option --enable-e1000
    - Added PCI network boot ROM support to all network adapters
    - Added TFTP support to the 'slirp' networking module
  - PCI
    - added "auto-assign to PCI slot" feature for PCI-only devices
  - DMA
    - Added the capability to transfer more then one byte / word per ISA DMA cycle
  - VGA
    - Major rewrite of the vga / cirrus code:
      - vgacore (shared standard VGA emulation code)
      - vga (Bochs VBE and PCI VGA)
      - cirrus (CL-GD 5430 ISA / CL-GD 5446 PCI)
    - Added VGA graphics blinking support
    - More accurate vertical and horizontal retrace emulation
      (based on the DOSBox implementation)
  - hard drive / hdimage
    - added new disk image mode 'vpc' for VirtualPC images
    - undoable mode: added coherency check (flat image size and timestamp)
    - sparse mode: fixed read support
  - Sound
    - implemented PC speaker beep using the lowlevel sound interface
    - added SDL audio output support

- ROM BIOS
  - improved PCI boot ROM support (for VGA and other devices)
  - added MADT entry for Interrupt Source Override to ACPI tables

- GUI and display libraries
  - implemented "auto-off" timer for status LEDs indicating a data transfer
  - Added support for sending absolute mouse position values from the gui if an
    absolute pointing device (USB tablet) is active (rfb, sdl, win32, wx, x).
  - Gui debugger now supported when using sdl gui on Windows
  - Implemented "hideIPS" option in rfb, sdl, win32 and wx libraries
  - wx: fixed random freezes with wxGTK and "show ips" feature enabled
  - rfb: the "show ips" feature now works on Windows host

- Tools
  - bxcommit: added support for converting growing to flat mode images
  - bxcommit: support command line options and non-interactive (quiet) mode
  - bximage: increased maximum disk size to 8 TB
