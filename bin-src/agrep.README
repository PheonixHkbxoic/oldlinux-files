I believe this is about the easiest port I've never done.  It compiles  with GCC 1.4 (haven't gotten around to fiddling with 2.1 just yet) without a hitch.No configuration, no defines, no nuthin'.  Just un-tar it, type "make", and away we go!  Not so much as a peep from the compiler.  I haven't tested it exhaustively,  but I fooled around with it for a while, and it seems to work fine.  One last note.  For the time being,  my only access to the internet is through a VAX running VMS. Since VMS uses 512-byte, fixed-length records forbinary files, the size will be rounded up to the next multiple of 512.  Thecorrect sizes are: agrep-2.04.tar.Z - 62351  agrep.Z - 37706 agrep.ps.1.Z - 74055 agrep.ps.2.Z - 41544    I don't think it should cause any problems, but tar will probably bitch aboutthe trailing garbage.  If that bothers you, use touch to fix the size beforeyou uncompress them.Ciao!      Hutch.         (hutchinson@wrair-emh1.army.mil)The rest of this file is the original readme from cs.arizona.edu.------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is version 2.04 of agrep - a new tool for fast text searching allowing errors.agrep is similar to egrep (or grep or fgrep), but it is much more general(and usually faster).The main changes from version 1.1 are 1) incorporating Boyer-Mooretype filtering to speed up search considerably, 2) allowing multi patterns via the -f option; this is similar to fgrep, but from our experience agrep is much faster, 3) searching for "best match" without having tospecify the number of errors allowed, and 4) ascii is no longer required.Several more options were added.To compile, simply run make in the agrep directory after untar'ingthe tar file (tar -xf agrep-2.04.tar will do it).The three most significant features of agrep that are not supported bythe grep family are 1) the ability to search for approximate patterns;    for example, "agrep -2 homogenos foo" will find homogeneous as well     as any other word that can be obtained from homogenos with at most     2 substitutions, insertions, or deletions.    "agrep -B homogenos foo" will generate a message of the form    best match has 2 errors, there are 5 matches, output them? (y/n)2) agrep is record oriented rather than just line oriented;  a record    is by default a line, but it can be user defined;    for example, "agrep -d '^From ' 'pizza' mbox"    outputs all mail messages that contain the keyword "pizza".    Another example:  "agrep -d '$$' pattern foo" will output all    paragraphs (separated by an empty line) that contain pattern.3) multiple patterns with AND (or OR) logic queries.       For example, "agrep -d '^From ' 'burger,pizza' mbox"     outputs all mail messages containing at least one of the     two keywords (, stands for OR).    "agrep -d '^From ' 'good;pizza' mbox" outputs all mail messages    containing both keywords.Putting these options together one can ask queries likeagrep -d '$$' -2 '<CACM>;TheAuthor;Curriculum;<198[5-9]>' bibwhich outputs all paragraphs referencing articles in CACM between 1985 and 1989 by TheAuthor dealing with curriculum.  Two errors are allowed, but they cannot be in either CACM or the year (the <> brackets forbid errors in the pattern between them).  Other features include searching for regular expressions (with orwithout errors), unlimited wild cards, limiting the errors to only insertions or only substitutions or any combination, allowing each deletion, for example, to be counted as, say, 2 substitutions or 3 insertions, restricting parts of the query to be exact and parts to be approximate, and many more.agrep is available by anonymous ftp from cs.arizona.edu (IP 192.12.69.5)as agrep/agrep-2.04.tar.Z (or in uncompressed form as agrep/agrep-2.04.tar).The tar file contains the source code (in C), man pages (agrep.1),and two additional files, agrep.algorithms and agrep.chronicle,giving more information.The agrep directory also includes two postscript files: agrep.ps.1 is a technical report from June 1991 describing the design and implementation of agrep;agrep.ps.2 is a copy of the paper as appeared in the 1992Winter USENIX conference.Please mail bug reports (or any other comments) to sw@cs.arizona.edu or to udi@cs.arizona.edu.We would appreciate if users notify us (at the address above)of any extensions, improvements, or interesting uses of this software.January 17, 1992BUGS_fixed/option_update1. remove multiple definitions of some global variables.2. fix a bug in -G option.3. fix a bug in -w option.January 23, 19924. fix a bug in pipeline input.5. make the definition of word-delimiter consistant.March 16, 19926. add option '-y' which, if specified with -B option, will alwaysoutput the best-matches without a prompt.April 10, 19927. fix a bug regarding exit status.April 15, 1992
