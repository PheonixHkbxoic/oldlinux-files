This is 'duonly,' a program which post-processes the output of du to produce
a listing of the size of what's actually in each directory, instead of what's 
in the directory and all it's subdirectories.

I find it really useful to locate the directories which need to be pruned when
I get low on disk space.

Ex:
  du bigstuff | duonly | sort -n | tail -10

gives ten fullest directories.
