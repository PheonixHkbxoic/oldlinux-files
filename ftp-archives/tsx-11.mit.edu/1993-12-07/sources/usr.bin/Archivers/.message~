Note: If you are coming from a non-US or non-Canadian site, you do not
have permission to retrieve the file "zip10c_src.tar.Z"; please fetch
"zip-src.tar.Z" instead.  

"zip10c_src.tar.Z" contains cryptographic code, and all "cryptographic
materials", including a Captain Crunch Decoder Ring, are considered
*munitions* and requires an export license to export them out of the
20 or so countries which have signed the COCOM treaty.

That's right; thanks to the crazy lawyers and politicians, trying to
export cryptographic code without a license is the same as smuggling
guns.  Go figure.
