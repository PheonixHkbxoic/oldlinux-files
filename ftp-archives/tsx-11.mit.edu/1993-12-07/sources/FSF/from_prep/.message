*** NOTE ***
The files in this directory are out of date, for the most part.  They
are here to satisfy Richard Stallman.  Do not downloda these -- get the
latest versions from ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu or sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/gnu
or ftp.uu.net:??? or some other gnu mirror.  This is *not* a mirror, but
is here because of binaries available elsewhere on this site.
