Hi,

I have released, with the cooperation of Rob Hooft, the new DLL readline
library (sources as distributed with bash-1.13.4). Included also is readline
linked bash and ftp binaries. The version of gdb-4.11 I have previously
uploaded may be also used with this dll.

All preliminary tests have indicated that backward compatability has been
retained.

Enjoy
