Here is LILO, LInux LOader, by Werner Almesberger.  If you get
lilo.10.tar.z you do not need CHANGES, INCOMPAT, or README, as
they are included in the lilo.10.tar.z files.   README contains
simple documentation for using linux, and lilo-[tu].ps.z provide
a large treatise on the subject of booting. They are good reading
as well as good documentation on LILO...
