 the basic, standard TeX stuff has been moved into the SLS subdirs
   (ie ../SLS/t[1-3], etc) see  SLS.tex.files for file lists
 I compiled the binaries with gcc-2.3.3, 4.3 libs (xdvi and 
     mf require the 3.0 X libs)

NOTE: more recent binaries, etc. are in the packages in the Milieu
subdir.

 for mf graphic support, in your .Xdefaults file, add:
    mf*height: 480
    mf*width:  640
   or whatever you want (to change the default origin position,
    edit plain.mf and make a new format)
 
 Printer support: texbin.tpz contains a laserjet driver (source: 
                  ftp.wu-wien.ac.at pub/src/Typeset/dvi2xx)
                    for PostScript, Rokicki's dvips is best
                    (ftp labrea.stanford.edu or neon.stanford.edu
                      for source and support files)
                  - for ur convenience, i've included dvilj package
                    and dvips package.

REFERENCES:
      Gentle.tex.Z   good intro to Plain TeX (included texdoc.tpz )
      Knuth's The TeXbook/The MetaFontbook are std. refs, there are also
        many good introductions and comprehensive textbooks around,
        look in your library or bookstore (I recommend ``TeX for
        the Impatient'')
 
 comp.text.tex is the usenet group for TeX. 
 A FAQ and site list is avail at: cs.nyu.edu in dir ~ftp/pub/tex
 
 i'll try to answer questions about TeX and MetaFont, both as typesetting
utilities and as programming languages in their own right.
