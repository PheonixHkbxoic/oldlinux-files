   milieu.tz contains what passes for documentation for now. 
   readme.txt.z is an ascii version (unedited output fm dvi2tty)
     send "bug" reports to tdunbar@vtaix.cc.vt.edu

  the binaries here (and in the SLS tex archives) are based
on web2c-5.851d. that package is for TeX 3.141 and METAFONT 2.71
 i have updated to TeX 3.1415 and Tangle 4.4, see the diffs.
i've also made a few changes (bugfix in openinout.c, prompt
in mf, paths) from the std distribution.
 i see no need to recompile for newer c or X libs. 
 the actual TeX and METAFONT programs are changing very little nowdays-
Knuth has pronounced them complete. thus the Linux TeX archives are 
not apt to change frequently. (the main area of activity is the 
forthcoming LaTeX 3 macro package, but that has nothing to do with
compilation, etc for Linux. rather ftp to pip.shsu.edu and get whatever
macro packages you need)
 nevertheless, i like to think the binaries here are the most uptodate
anywhere (for any os). if that's not the case, let me know.
