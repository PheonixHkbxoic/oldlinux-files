util-usrbin-2.0.bin.tar.gz

     This is a distribution of all those (Linux-specific) programs that
     "belong" in /usr/bin:

     banner cal chsh clear col colcrt colrm column hexdump last logger
     look mesg od script strings ul uuencode uudecode whereis

     Man pages are included for all of the programs.

     This release is the logical successor of utila-1.5, and contains many
     new versions.  Of note: passwd was moved to util-bin
