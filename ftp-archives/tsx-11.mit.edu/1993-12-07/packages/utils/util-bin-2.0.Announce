util-bin-2.0.src.tar.gz
util-bin-2.0.bin.tar.gz

     This is a distribution of all those (Linux-specific) programs that
     "belong" in /bin:

     domainname ed hostname kill ldd login more newgrp passwd setterm wall
     write

     Man pages are included for all of the programs.

     This release is the logical successor of utilb-1.3, and contains many
     new versions.  Of note: domainname, newgrp, and passwd are new.
