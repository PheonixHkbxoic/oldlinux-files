I've just sent you the diffs for InterViews 3.0.1 to get it compiling under
linux.  A readme is included, along with three extra files.  Two are to
overcome the 14 character limit of the minix file system and the other
one is required for the configuration.  Hopefully I've explained it properly
in the readme.  I'll try to send the libraries mentioned soon, however I
was hoping X11 v2.0 would come out before then.  A logical description for
InterViews would probably be "A user interface toolkit for X", just in case
you have no idea what it is.  I have not included the original distribution
as it is 3+Mb compressed, however it can be obtained from
interviews.stanford.edu among other places.  If you require any further
information feel free to e-mail me.

Roger.

iv301libs.tar.Z

This contains the InterViews 3.0.1 libraries compiled for linux.  These are
in case people don't have the 24Mb of virtual memory available to compile
the libraries for themselves.  It was compiled with GCC 2.2.2d7 and used
the header files from X11v2.0.  It contains a small readme which tells
people where to place the files.  The original distribution as well as the
diffs are still required should they wish to make use of the toolkit.
If the libraries are just being used to link the two example files they can
basically go in /usr/lib.

iclass301.tar.Z

This contains the .a file which can be linked with the X11 and IV libraries
to create the executable.  This is the InterViews class browser from the
3.0.1 distribution.  It is very useful for scanning through C++ classes.
The manpage and a small link script are included.

idraw301.tar.Z

Same as above except that this is the InterViews drawing editor.  It still
has a few problems with fonts, but it seems to be stable enough for people
to try out.

Just a related note on iv301diffs.tar.Z.  The configuration file changed
with x11v2.0.  Instead of #include <linux.cf>, "linux.cf" should have
#include <x386.cf>.  There may also need to be some changes for the paths
as the libraries also moved from x11v1.1 to v2.0.
Could you perhaps please add another readme or something to the previous
tar file so people are aware of the differences between x11v1.1 and v2.0.

Thanks,
Roger.

Roger Scott <u906400@bruny.cc.utas.edu.au> uploaded binaries for
the (excellent) drawing program called idraw about a month ago.

The two files, idraw301.tar.Z, and iv301libs.tar.Z, are in the
incoming directory but have not been made available for public
use.

I am not sure if Roger notified you of what the files were, but
in case he didn't, idraw is an excellent object-oriented drawing
program in the spirit of MacDraw.  It is supplied as a demo
with Interviews (a C++ class library for developing X
applications).  However, idraw is quite usable on its own.

Unfortunately, compiling Interviews and its demo applications
requires 50 MB of free disk and 24 MB memory so building it 
is beyond the resources of many people.  Thus I think it would
be of great benefit to make the binaries publicly available.

The file is called idraw301.tar.Z, and iv301libs.tar.Z is needed
to link it properly.  It was created under X v2.0 and GCC
v2.2.2d7.

I think an appropriate location for the files would be:

  /binaries/usr.bin.X11

Thanks for your help.

Hi Ted,

Please move it to the appropriate place.

Thanks,
