Overview
--------

	This is the Linux binary distribution of XFree86 1.3, a port of X11R5
to x386 architectures. It is a basic distribution, compiled and packaged with
the following environment:

	linux-0.99.10		required for runtime
	gcc-2.3.3		required for compilation/link kit
	libc-4.4		required for runtime
	gzip-1.1.1		required for installation


Packages
--------

	The distribution was made by breaking up the full distribution into
a collection of smaller, more-or-less independent gzip'ed tar files.

	xf86-1.3-bin.tar.gz  6.3Mb  basic runtime binaries
	xf86-1.3-kit.tar.gz  3.0Mb  server link kit
	xf86-1.3-man.tar.gz  2.7Mb  manpages (useful for installation)
	xf86-1.3-pex.tar.gz  2.9Mb  PEX binaries
	xf86-1.3-prg.tar.gz  3.0Mb  programmer tools, libraries and includes
	xf86-1.3-xfn.tar.gz  2.2Mb  extra fonts (75dpi and Speedo)
			     -----
			    20.1Mb  total required space


Installation
------------

	If upgrading, save the old copies of /usr/X386/lib/X11/Xconfig,
and any modified xinit or xdm files, in /usr/X386/lib/X11. These can be
merged back into the tree after the installation is completed.

	The distribution can be installed directly into / or onto another
partition. It will unpack into a subtree rooted at usr/X386. If unpacking
onto another partition, make the symlink from /usr/X386 to there.

	After unpacking xf86-1.3-bin.tar.gz and xf86-1.3-pex.tar.gz, either
move /usr/X386/lib/*.so.? to /lib or add /usr/X386/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

	Read all the documentation provided in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc,
especially the section on video mode computation, and the manpages,
especially XFree86, which describes the syntax of /usr/X386/lib/X11/Xconfig,
used to configure the server.

	Move /usr/X386/lib/X11/Xconfig.sample to /usr/X386/lib/X11/Xconfig,
or modify your existing one to conform to any new syntax. This part is
tricky, but the documentation provided gives clear instructions.

	If you decide to run the monochrome server, change the symlink
/usr/X386/bin/X to point to XF86_Mono instead of XF86_SVGA.

	If you're running with shadow passwords enabled, you will need
to obtain new versions of xdm and other programs, that have been compiled
for shadow password support.


Execution
---------

	The server requires a free VT on which to run. A free VT is a
virtual console that has not been opened by any process, like shells or
getty. If necessary, change your /etc/inittab (or equivalent) to turn off
the getty on one virtual console. If there is no free VT available, the
server will fail to start.

	For best operation, run the server in a standard 80x25 virtual
console. The font restoration code attempts to handle other cases, but
is not able to do the job completely for certain special SVGA modes.

	The first time, run "X 2>OUT" to try the server, redirecting
error messages to the file OUT. If the server fails to start, or the
screen blanks but no X screen appears, check the file OUT for errors
in configuration. Once the server runs properly, the clock and chipset
entries can be placed in Xconfig for faster and more reliable startup.

	Normally, the server is started with the command "startx", which
runs xinit. Xinit starts the server and any clients specified in your
local .xinitrc. Alternatively, the server may be controlled by xdm,
which allows multiple sessions and remote server connections. For more
information, check the specific manpages.
