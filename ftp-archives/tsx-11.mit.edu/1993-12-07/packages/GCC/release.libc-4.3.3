This is the official release of the Linux C library 4.3.3. You have to
install the source code of 0.99 pl5 or above to use it since there are
some changes in kernel. You have to use 0.99 pl 5 or above kernel to
call bsd flock (). You also need gcc 2.3.3 or above to use it.

High Lights:

1. new fast malloc and some memory leak should be fixed.
2. new tools 2.5 for building the shared library, required for the
   the Linux C library 4.3.3. It is in pub/linux/GCC/src. Don't use
   tools-2.2.tar.z. It has bugs.
3. new ld in binutils.tar.z and image-4.3.3.tar.z.
4. a bug in regex fixed.
5. strtod is fixed.
6. new IEEE 754 functions in math library, check <math.h>.
7. many bugs in stdio/iostream are fixed.
8. much more.

Please read ChangeLog for details of the bug fixes and changes.

You can get this package from tsx-11.mit.edu under pub/linux/GCC. The
file names are inc-4.3.3.tar.z, libc-4.3.3.tar.z, inc-4.3.2-4.3.3.tar.z,
libc-4.3.2-4.3.3.tar.z, image-4.3.3.tar.z and extra-4.3.3.tar.z.

NOTE: All the stuff previously in /usr/etc/inet or /etc/inet must be in
      /etc now. If you don't know what you are doing, please do

	cd /etc
	ln -s ./inet/* .
	ln -s /usr/etc/inet/* .

There are also i486 binary versions in ./486.

This release is compressed with gzip 1.0.3.

The file list:

1. inc-4.3.3.tar.z

  The header files for 4.3.3.

  cd /usr
  gzip -dc inc-4.3.3.tar.z | tar xvvof -

  The header files in inc-4.3.3.tar.z are not complete. You have to
  install the kernel source for the rest of the header files. Please
  get the version mentioned at the beginning of this release note.
  Suppose you install the kernel source at "/foo/bar/src", you should
  do as root

  mkdir -p /usr/include
  cd /usr/include
  ln -s /foo/bar/src/linux/include/asm . 
  ln -s /foo/bar/src/linux/include/linux . 

2. libc-4.3.3.tar.z

  Source code for 4.3.3.

  cd src
  gzip -dc libc-4.3.3.tar.z | tar xvvof -

3. inc-4.3.2-4.3.3.tar.z

  Change of the header files from 4.3.2 to 4.3.3.

  cd /usr
  gzip -dc incc-4.3.2-4.3.3.tar.z | tar xvvof -

4. libc-4.3.2-4.3.3.tar.z

  Change of the source code from 4.3.2 to 4.3.3.

  cd src
  gzip -dc libc-4.3.2-4.3.3.tar.z | tar xvvof -

5. image-4.3.3.tar.z

  The static/stub libraries, shared image, crt0.o and ld. To install
  it, as root do

  cd /tmp
  rm -rf ./lib ./usr
  gzip -dc image-4.3.3.tar.z | tar xvvof -
  cp -av ./lib ./usr /
  cd /lib
  ln -sf libc.so.4.3.3 libc.so.4

  If you have an early version of libc.so.4.3.3 installed, you may have
  to play with it, like
		  
  cd /lib
  cp libc.so.4.3.3 /tmp/libc.so.4.3.3.old
  ln -sf /tmp/libc.so.4.3.3.old libc.so.4
  mv libc.so.4.3.3 old.libc.so.4.3.3

  before you unpack image-4.3.3.tar.z.

6. extra-4.3.3.tar.z

  libmcheck.a, libg.a, libc_p.a, libgmon.a and gcrt0.o. To install
   
  cd /
  gzip -dc extra-4.3.3.tar.z | tar xvvof -

7. ChangeLog

  Change log for the Linux C library.

Please fix the file permissions after you install it.
