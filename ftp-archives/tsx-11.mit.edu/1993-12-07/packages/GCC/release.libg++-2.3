This is the binary release of the GNU C++ library 2.3 (libg++ 2.3) for
Linux. You have to install gcc 2.3.3, and libc 4.3 or above to use it.

You can get this package from tsx-11.mit.edu under pub/linux/GCC. It
is compressed with gzip 1.03.

Iostream is the part of the Linux C library. We have put the basic
iostream into the jump table version of shared library. The iostream
in libc.sa is experimental. Please give it a thorough test and report
iostream bugs to me and Eric Youngdale (eric@tantalus.nrl.navy.mil).
If you need more than what we put in libc.sa and cannot get it working
with jump table, please use the static libraries, i.e.,

	gcc -static xxxxxxx [-lg++]

gcc -nojump will not work any more.


The file list:

1. libg++-2.3.tar.z

  libg++.a, g++-include and genclass. It is libg++ 2.3. To install

  zcat libg++-2.3.tar.z | tar xvvof -
