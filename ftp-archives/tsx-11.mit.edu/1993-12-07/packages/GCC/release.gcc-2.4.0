This is the Linux binary release of gcc 2.4.0, built with
gcc-2.4.0.tar.z. You have to use 0.99 pl8 or above to run it. You have
to have the Linux C library 4.4 or above installed to use it.

You can get it from tsx-11 under pub/linux/packages/GCC.

This release fixed lots of g++ bugs in gcc 2.3.3. If you are using g++,
please use this one. The function templates should work now.

WARNING:
 1) I have added support for domainname stuff in kernel. The next
    release of gcc will need that. I have sent my patch to Linus.
    If it is not in the kernel source at the time when the next
    release is made, I will provide a kernel patch for that.
 2) Object C is in this relaese. But it is untested.
 3) Please apply the patch below to kernel if you haven't done so.
 4) libgcc.a and libobjc.a under /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i[34]86-linux/2.4.0
    are compiled with debug turned on. They will be linked if -static,
    -g or -pg is used during linking. libgcc.a in /usr/lib is compiled
    with debug turned off.

The file list

1. a-gcc-2.4.0.tar.z
   Cpp, cc1, cc1plus, protoize, unprotoize and version dependent
   header files. Protoize and unprotoize are untested. To install

	gzip -dc a-gcc-2.4.0.tar.z | tar xvvof -

2. b-gcc-2.4.0.tar.z
   Object C stuff. Untested. To install

	cd /
	gzip -dc b-gcc-2.4.0.tar.z | tar xvvof -

BTW, please fix the file permissions and ownerships.

To use the old one, please do

gcc -V xxxxxx # xxxxxx is the old version number.
