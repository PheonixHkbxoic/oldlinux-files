his is the release of the Linux C library 4.2. You have to
install the source code of 0.98 pl5 to use it since fd_set is changed
and it needs <linux/ioctl.h>. You don't have to use 0.98 pl 5 kernel.
But 0.98 pl 4 kernel is necessary. You also need gcc 2.3.3 or above to
use it.

Since kernel now has the 387 emulation, we don't need soft math library
anymore.

I was told this shared image work with older kernel (newer than 0.97
pl4). I have put libnet.a and librpc.a back into libc.a.

Please get the latest binutils.TZ from tsx-11.mit.edu if you cannot
get your binaries linked with the shared libraries. Starting with this
release, I used a new structure for libraries.  The different versions
of each library, i.e., static, jump table and classic shared library,
are in the same directory, /usr/lib.  To illustrate, if the library is
named foo, then the static version is libfoo.a.  The jump table version
is libfoo.sa and the classic version is libfoo.ca.  The new `ld', which
is in binutils.TZ and on the third disk of the Linux Base System on
tsx-11.mit.edu, searches for the jump table library by default.  You
can overwrite it by adding -static or -nojump to `ld' or 'gcc'.  The
jump table and classic versions are not compatible with each other.
The static library should be used as a last resort. You can rename your
old shared libraries, notablely Xfree386, to fit the new scheme. The
script should look something like that:

----------
#!/bin/sh

cd /usr/X386/lib
for l in shlib/jump/*
do
  s=`basename $l .a`
  mv $l $s.sa
done
for l in shlib/nojump/*
do
  s=`basename $l .a`
  mv $l $s.ca
done
----------

Please make sure it works right before you run it.

You can get them from tsx-11.mit.edu under pub/linux/GCC. The
file names are image-4.2.TZ, extra-4.2.TZ, gxx-2.3.TZ, inc-4.2.TZ,
jump-4.2.TZ and libc-4.2.TZ.

Please read ChangeLog for details of the bug fixes.

The file list:

1. image-4.2.TZ

  The shared images and libraries. To install it, as root do

  cd /tmp
  rm -rf ./lib ./usr
  tar xvvofz image-4.2.TZ
  cp -av ./lib ./usr /
  cd /lib
  ln -sf libc.so.4.2 libc.so.4

  If you have an early version of libc.so.4.2 installed, you may have
  to play with it, like
  
  cd /lib
  cp libc.so.4.2 libc.so.4.2.old
  ln -sf libc.so.4.2.old libc.so.4
  mv libc.so.4.2 foo

  before you unpack image-4.2.TZ. The iostream is in libc.so.4.2. But
  you have to use -nojump to use it since the external interface of
  iostream may change in the future.
  
2. extra-4.2.TZ

  libg.a and libc_p.a. To install
   
  cd /
  tar xvvofz extra-4.2.TZ

  libg.a is very big. I usually do

  cd /usr/lib
  ln -s libc.a libg.a

  since I usually do not debug the C library this way.

3. gxx-2.3.TZ

  libg++.a, g++-include and genclass. It is libg++ 2.3. To install

  cd /usr
  tar xvvofz gxx-2.3.TZ

  Iostream is in libc.a. To use it, you have to use -nojump
  or -static in your LDFLAGS.

4. inc-4.2.TZ

  To use the 4.2 header files, do

  cd /usr
  tar xvvofz inc-4.2..TZ

  /usr/include/asm and /usr/include/linux may be wrong. Please make
  a right symbolic link to each of them according to your Linux kernel
  source tree.

5. inc1229-4.2.TZ

  Change of the header files from 1129 to 4.2. It is in the testing
  directory.

  cd /usr
  tar xvvofz inc1229-4.2.TZ

6. jump-4.2.TZ

  There is also a file called jump-4.2.TZ for building the shared
  image for the C library 4.2. Please install image-4.2.TZ first since
  you need libgcc.a in it. The has been changed a lot thanks to
  dje@sspiff.cygnus.com (Doug Evans).

7. libc-4.2.TZ

  The source code of the Linux C library 4.2.

8. libc1229-4.2.TZ

  Change of the source code from 1229 to 4.2. It is in the testing
  directory.

9. ChangeLog

  Change log for the Linux C library.

10. inc-4.2-fix.TZ

  Some fixed headers failed to make into inc-4.2.TZ but are needed.
  To unpack it:

  cd /usr
  tar xvvofz inc-4.2-fix.TZ

Please fix the file permissions after you install it.
