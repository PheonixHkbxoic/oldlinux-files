This is the binary release of the GNU C++ library 2.4 (libg++ 2.4) for
Linux. You have to install gcc 2.4.5 to use it. Please don't use it
with gcc 2.3.3 or 2.5.x.

It is on tsx-11.mit.edu under pub/linux/pakcages/GCC
and is compressed with gzip 1.03.

Iostream is the part of the Linux C library. We have put the basic
iostream into the jump table version of shared library. The iostream
in libc.sa is experimental. Please give it a thorough test and report
iostream bugs to me and Eric Youngdale (eric@tantalus.nrl.navy.mil).
If you need more than what we put in libc.sa and cannot get it working
with jump table, please use the static libraries, i.e.,

	gcc -static xxxxxxx [-lg++]

gcc -nojump will not work any more.

If you want to compile libg++ 2.4 yourself, you can get the source code
libg++-2.4.tar.gz from any gnu ftp sites like prep.ai.mit.edu:pub/gnu
or ftp.uu.net:packages/gnu. You should ignore iostream part and use the
one in the Linux C library 4.4.4, which is under testing. The Linux
patch for iostream in libg++ 2.4 is libg++-2.4.diff.gz on tsx-11.mit.edu
under pub/linux/pakcages/GCC. This patch is in the Linux
C library 4.4.4.

The file list:
