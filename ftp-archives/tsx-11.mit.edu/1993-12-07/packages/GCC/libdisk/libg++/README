Most of the files in ./usr/g++-include/gen are gzipped.
After copying them to your hard disk, do

	cd /usr/g++-include/gen
	uncompress *
 
Iostream (cin, cout and cerr, etc.) is in libc.a. There are
partial stubs for iostream in the jump table. But they are
kind of experimental. If you have any problem with it, you
you have to do

	gcc -static -o foo.o foo.cc

linking with static library. At the same time, please send
me a bug report.
