Don't forget to make/fix two symbolic links for /usr/include/asm and 
/usr/include/linux from your linux kernel source code. As an example,
if your kernel source is under /usr/src, you should do:

    rm -rf /usr/include/asm /usr/include/linux
    ln -s /usr/src/linux/include/asm /usr/include
    ln -s /usr/src/linux/include/linux /usr/include

I didn't put libg.a on the libdisk since it is too big, about 2 MB.
Please get extra-4.3.3.tar.z from your favorite Linux site or
tsx-11.mit.edu under pub/linux/GCC.

I also gzipped /usr/lib/libc_p.a. You have to do

	cd /usr/lib
	uncompress libc_p.a.z

before you use "gccc -pg xxx".
