The file "gvpscsi.patch" contains patches relative to linux/68k
0.05pl1 which add a SCSI driver for the GVP Series II SCSI controller.

Obviously you have to be able to compile the kernel in order to take
advantage of these patches.

Thanks go to Ralf Baechle for creating these patches.

This driver should be integrated into the kernel for the 0.06 release.
