NOTE: I am going to rebuild this directory with the most up-to-date
      versions of the Amiga tools for 680x0 linux development.  They
      will be tarred and/or gzipped.

dd.lha              - executable and source for a AmigaDOS version of the
                      Unix tool "dd".
fixed_ld2.lha       - newest version of the linux "ld" linker
ixemul.library      - latest (?) version of ixemul.library
linuxgcc.lha        - gcc:compilers/linux/2.2.2 directory with linux
                      development tools
linuxtools.lha      - some useful binaries (I don't remember what!)
make-3.63.lha       - binary and sources for amiga version of GNU make 3.63
pdksh-920711.lha    - Amiga binaries and sources for ksh clone.  Used when
                      compiling 680x0 linux on the Amiga.  Install as bin:sh.
setpath.rexx        - An ARexx script I run from my s:user-startup after
                      setting all paths.  This sets up the PATH environment
                      variable for use by pdksh (bin:sh).  Put it in REXX:.
                      The last line of my s:user-startup is "rx setpath".
