This archive contains the linux/68k v005.3 version of:

vmlinux   - the linux/68k kernel
bootstrap - the Amiga bootstrap program for linux/68k.

The differences from 005.2 include:

 - More bug fixes which should hopefully allow those with A2091 Hard disk
   controllers to use their controller from linux.
   The bug fix is cleaner now also.

Source patches for these changes are available in the sources
directory.
