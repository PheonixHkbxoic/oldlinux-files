filesys.gz              - A gzipped file system image.  This is an 880K
                          image, which can either be loaded as a ramdisk or
                          copied to a floppy (using something like the flat:
                          handler).  This is a root file system image,
                          containing a "sh", "ls", "cp", "mkfs", "mount" 
                          and a few other programs.  If one of the supplied
                          SCSI drivers works on your system, you should be
                          able to "mkfs" a minix filesystem on a hard disk
                          partition, mount the partition off this root
                          filesystem and copy files to the partition.
