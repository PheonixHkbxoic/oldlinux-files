Welcome to the 680x0 Linux archive.

Please note that transactions in this directory are logged.

The 680x0 Linux kernel is not complete.  It is not really useful for
anyone other than those who are willing to work on kernel development,
due to the lack of disk drivers other than a ramdisk driver.

The only system it runs on at all so far is an Amiga equipped with a
68030 processor.  It does not currently support the 68040.  It will
never support the 68EC030 processor, due to the lack of a memory
management unit (MMU).
