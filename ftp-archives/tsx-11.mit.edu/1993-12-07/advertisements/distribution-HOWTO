TIPS:
   Read the copyright information before distributing any material for
   profit.  Linux, GNU, and most other support software with linux is
   freely distributable, but there are some restrictions you should make
   yourself aware of.

   Before adding a listing or making a purchase, read the FAQ's of the
   misc.forsale and misc.forsale.computers.d news groups.  This may help
   you avoid common mail-order mistakes.  Advertisers in each catagory
   are  listed in reverse order of ad size, with some exceptions.  I
   make no attempt to endorse any particular distribution or vendor.

Subject: SLS (Softlanding Linux System) 
Status: RO

The new version of SLS (Softlanding Linux System) is now available on tsx-11.  

Features of this upgrade include:

 - Network installation from 3.5" disks
 - Linux 99 alpha p12
 - libc 4.4.1 and gcc 2.4.5
 - net 2 support
 - XFree 386 1.3 (with shadow xlock and xdm)
 - Tcl/Tk  (this replaces the IV libs)
 - rebuilt versions of idraw and doc
 - First cut of Windows3 API (based on Tk)
 - mailx
 - Quotas
 - Eric Youngdale's ELF support for SVR4 binaries
 - national video font support
 - the new mitsumi driver
 - ifs and loop fs
 - selection
 - clean up of man pages and duplicate binaries, etc
 - fixed version of bash
 - enhanced installation

Also a set of boot time configuration options have been to the kernel, such 
as forcing the hard drive params (for PS/VP) and forcing the net card,
and busmouse params.  The install program automatically sets up lilo
with these parameters at install time.  Lilo now uses the root partition 
rather than the boot partition.

The SLS install program, doinstall, now fully automates installs, including
setting up swap, running "fdisk", and using "mke2fs" automatically, if you
omit the parameters.

The syssetup script has been extended so that it now sets up your tcpip
for your hostname, ipaddr, nameserver, etc.  Mail is now setup with
this info, for internet based nodes.

Subject: Debian Channel Created
Organization: The Debian Project
Keywords: debian distribution development mail list channel
Status: RO

I'd like to announce the creation of the DEBIAN channel on the linux-activists
mailing list.  To join, send mail to linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi
with the following as the first line of the message body: 

	X-Mn-Admin: join DEBIAN

For further instructions on using the mailing list please refer to the Linux
FAQ.

What is "Debian", anyway?
=========================

Debian is a brand-new kind of Linux distribution.  Instead of being developed
by one isolated individual or group, Debian will be developed by its *users*
in the tradition of the Linux kernel and other critical components of the
Linux system.  In this way I hope that it will eventually develop into a
powerful yet flexible product just as Linux in general has done under the
same development philosophy.

Debian Linux is currently in ALPHA.  It is not yet available in a public
location; however, if you feel your contributions could include early testing
and improvement, then I invite you to join the DEBIAN channel and then
to mail me for the location of the distribution.  Please mail me at
imurdock@shell.portal.com with a subject of "request", and include in the
body of the message a brief description of what you have to offer the Debian
project at this early stage.  If I tell you where to find Debian Linux before
it is released publically, then I *will* expect you to participate.  Do *not*
think of this as a way to get the distribution before anyone else. 
 
I invite all interested to join the channel and become a part of the Debian
project.  As soon as Debian is made publically available the channel will
become the center of communications for the project: bug reports, discussion
concerning developing and improving the distribution and the organizational
center of development in general.

For the latest Debian Linux announcements, finger imurdock@sage.cc.purdue.edu.

Thanks,

Ian

Subject: MCC Interim Linux
Status: RO

Introduction
************

The MCC interim versions of Linux are designed to allow people who
are not Unix experts to install a version of the Linux operating system
on a PC.  The installed system should be self-contained, but easy to
extend.


What are the MCC interim versions of Linux?
===========================================

When Linux version 0.10 first appeared in the autumn of 1991, it was
released by Linus Torvalds as a pair of floppy disks, known as the
"boot" and "root" disks.  Linus himself released several utilities
which did not fit on these disks.  Eventually quite a number of
contributions were available.  Software distribution was rather
chaotic, and you needed a lot of effort to collect a complete base
system.

The Manchester Computing Centre (MCC) is a part of the University of
Manchester, supporting computing at the University, at UMIST (the
University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology), and at
several other British universities.

We began to make Linux available by anonymous ftp in November 1991,
and we released the first MCC interim version of Linux (version 0.12+)
the following February.  This version made use of ramdisk code written
by Theodore Ts'o to mount a virtual root disk at boot time from the
kernel floppy.  (This type of distribution was used earlier by Andrew
Tannenbaum to distribute his operating system MINIX.)  With version
0.99p8+, we abandoned the ramdisk-as-root and adopted a combined
bootable root disk.  The first combined root disk was created by H J Lu
(who made essential use of Werner Almesberger's LILO software).  Unlike
H J's bootable root disk, the MCC disk does not contain an executable
shell.

Very shortly after the first MCC interim version of Linux appeared,
other people released similar versions: Dave Safford's TAMU releases
and Martin Junius's MJ versions were eventually followed by Peter
Macdonald's massive, comprehensive SLS releases and H J Lu's small base
systems.  What distinguishes the MCC versions from these others?

Since its first release, MCC interim Linux has included basic
utilities, the GNU C compiler, and the sources to the current kernel
release.  The software included in MCC distributions comes from a wide
variety of sources, but we try to make sources to all of it available,
though not as part of the distribution.  MCC interim versions aim to
provide a stable base system, which can be installed in a short time,
and to which other software can be added with relatively little effort.
Every binary file in an MCC distribution has been compiled under that
version of the kernel, by that version of `gcc', is linked with that
version of the libraries, and has been tested to some extent.  The only
exception to this is the GNU C compiler and libraries, which we take
directly from H J Lu's distribution.

We install this version of Linux on small 386-SX machines for our C
and Unix courses, and we need to be able to install it on twelve
machines in about one hour.  We also distribute this version of Linux
to our clients in Manchester.  We make no attempt to include a wide
variety of packages, or large packages such as X386.  The emacs and
info packages were added to MCC interim Linux only because we have been
using them for our courses.  People who want a distribution which
contains nearly everything should get the SLS versions, which are about
five times the size of MCC, and quite comprehensive.

Our versions are called "interim" because they are not intended to be
final or official.  They are small, harmonious, and moderately tested.
They do not conform to everyone's taste -- what release does? -- but
they should provide a stable base to which other software can be added.

This version of Linux is prepared to allow you to upgrade an existing
system, as well as to install a complete new system.  The limitations
are mainly that partitions must contain minix or ext2 file systems: ext
and xiafs file systems are not supported in the installation, though
they can be mounted from the installed system with no difficulty.
Upgrading an old system looks just like installing a new system, except
that you don't need to run `mkswap' and `mkfs' before installing.
Instead you should run `fsck', which you can do from the boot disk.
Old binaries are deleted, except for some old libraries, which may be
required by programs which you have acquired from somewhere else.

Text files, especially the configuration files in `/etc', are more
of a problem.  We don't want to throw away the old files, which you may
have spent some considerable time polishing, but we must install new
configuration files, or else the system may not boot properly, or may
work badly if it boots at all.  For this reason, the installation
creates a special directory named `/backupdirs'.  In this directory it
creates subdirectories such as `etc', `etc/lilo', `root', and
`home/user'.  Any old configuration files which might be overwritten
during the upgrade are moved to these directories before the new files
are installed.  After installation, you may cautiously compare the new
files with the old ones, and incorporate your personal preferences into
the new files.

You must be particularly careful with files such as `/etc/inittab'
or `/etc/rc', since mistakes in these may prevent the system from
booting, or cause serious problems while the system is running.  It is
a good idea to read the man pages for `init' and `inittab' before
making any changes to these files.  A number of other `rc' files are
created in `/etc' during the installation; these are described to some
extent in `/etc/inittab'.  See README.adapt


Copyright and conditions of distribution
========================================

Software today comes under a wide variety of copyright restrictions,
and it is important to know what conditions apply to the software you
use.  The software in MCC interim versions of Linux, and other software
which can be added to it, is copyrighted in a variety of ways.  In
general, all of it is available to be used by anyone, and the source to
all of it is available as well.  If you intend to use Linux or any of
its parts for commercial purposes, you should get the source files and
read the copyrights contained in them.  (A list of the sources can be
found in Acknowledgments.)  Most Linux software falls under one
of the following categories:

GNU copyleft
     The GNU General Public License applies to the Linux kernel, to the
     GNU C and C++ compilers, to all utilities distributed by the Free
     Software Foundation, and to many contributed utilities.  This
     copyright, also known as a copyleft, is designed to ensure that
     the source to software is available, and that you can give away or
     sell copies of the source and of compiled binaries.  There is no
     warranty, but you are obliged to notify anyone of any changes
     which you have made to the original.  You are obliged to publish
     on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and a disclaimer of
     warranty.  Works derived from copylefted works must be released
     under the same terms.  The terms are specified in the GNU General
     Public License, which is available by anonymous ftp.  See
     README.ftp

GNU library license
     The GNU library license applies to the GNU C++ library and to all
     works that must be linked with this library.  This allows
     commercial binaries to be supplied in an unlinked form, so that
     purchasers can link the binaries with other versions of the
     library.

BSD copyright
     The BSD copyright applies to all source from the University of
     California at Berkeley.  Source may be reused freely, but it
     should contain a notice to the effect that all or part of the
     software was developed by the University of California at
     Berkeley.  Moreover, the name of the University may not be used to
     endorse or promote such products.

MIT copyright
     The X Window System, version 11, is copyrighted by the
     Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and `X Window System' is a
     trademark owned by MIT.  Most of the source for this software was
     developed by the MIT X Consortium, and is covered by the MIT
     copyright.  This is similar to the BSD copyright in permitting
     free commercial use of MIT code, subject to the inclusion of
     similar notices giving credit for any MIT code used in the final
     product.

Public domain software
     Some programs in this distribution are in the public domain.  They
     have no copyright attached and can be used in any way without any
     obligation or restriction.

Subject: Getting MCC Interim Linux
Status: RO

There are two ways at present by which you can get a copy of MCC
interim versions of Linux: by anonymous ftp, and by visiting MCC.  The
latter method is available as a service only for students and members
of staff of the University of Manchester and of UMIST.


Getting MCC interim Linux by anonymous ftp
==========================================

MCC interim versions of Linux are released on ftp.mcc.ac.uk
[130.88.203.12] in the directory `/pub/linux/mcc-interim'.  In this
directory there are subdirectories `dos-utils', which contains some
commands which you may need if you install Linux from DOS, `0.99.p10+',
which contains the current release, and `old', which contains one or
more older releases.  The current MCC release is also available from
sunsite.unc.edu [152.2.22.81] in the directory
`/pub/Linux/distributions/MCC', and also from nic.funet.fi
[128.214.6.100] in `/pub/OS/Linux/images/MCC-interim'.  Other sites
sometimes maintain mirrors of the current MCC distribution.

The directory `0.99.p10+' contains the current `README' files and
the file `BUGS+WARNINGS', which contain important information.  (The
contents of all of these files have been incorporated into the present
document.)  It also contains the following subdirectories:

`images'
     This contains the gzipped image of the bootable root disk.  `gzip'
     is the GNU compression utility.

`packages'
     This contains the packages which are optional parts of the MCC
     interim distribution.

`extra_kernels'
     This contains additional kernels which may be installed as if they
     were packages.  You should not install more than one of these
     kernels.  They contain no support for SCSI or XT disks, and one of
     them contain no support for NFS or networking.  All three MCC
     kernels contain maths coprocessor emulation code, and support for
     IDE hard disks and for the minix, ext2, msdos, and proc file
     systems.

    boot
          SCSI, XT, NFS, networking.

    ide
          No SCSI, no XT, no NFS, no networking.

    ipide
          No SCSI, no XT, networking and NFS support.

`extra_packages'
     This contains packages which for one reason or another have a
     secondary status.

    emacs,
    elisp
          contain a cut-down version of the `emacs' editor, which we
          use in our courses at the Computer Centre.  A more complete
          version, which is compiled with support for X windows, is
          available by anonymous ftp.

    locinf
          contains info files which I did not wish to include in the
          main distribution; these describe `gcc' and how to port it,
          `cpp', some of the odder parts of `emacs', and other subjects.

    manpages
          contains unformatted manual pages.  The formatted pages are
          all that most people need, and they are already contained in
          the other packages.

    maps
          contains the available keyboard maps.  It is not needed for
          US or for UK keyboard maps, which are included in the base
          package on the root disk.

    patches
          contains the patches which, when applied to the corresponding
          source files, produce the sources compiled in the current
          release.

`source_files'
     This contains the source files which were used to compile all
     binaries in the current distribution.

After you decide what you need, you may transfer those files in
binary mode to any machine which supports ftp.  The bootable root disk
must be gunzipped and copied to a high density floppy disk, either 3.5
inch 1.44 Mb or 5.25 inch 1.2 Mb, of the sort which can be used to boot
the PC on which you intend to install or upgrade Linux.  If you have a
Linux system which you are upgrading, you may put a formatted floppy
into your 0 drive (which DOS calls `A:') and give these commands:

     fdformat /dev/fd0H1440                 (for 3.5 inch disks)
     fdformat /dev/fd0h1200                 (for 5.25 inch disks)
     gunzip boot-uk.z
     dd if=boot-uk of=/dev/fd0 bs=18432     (for 3.5 inch disks)
     dd if=boot-uk of=/dev/fd0 bs=15360     (for 5.25 inch disks)

If you are installing Linux on a machine which already contains a
version of Linux, you may wish to put the MCC packages in a directory
in the existing file system.  MCC interim versions at present support
only the minix and ext2 file systems.  The kernel will not allow you to
mount older ext or xiafs file systems.  The packages you wish to
install should be in a single directory, and they must have the same
file names (in lower case) as they do in the MCC distribution
directory.  You may put all the packages in a DOS directory on the same
machine, or you may copy them to floppies.  The MCC interim
distribution prefers DOS-format floppies, though minix or ext2 floppies
will work as well.  DOS format floppies will hold more, and will not
produce spurious error messages during installation.

If you are installing from DOS, you need commands which will gunzip
the disk image and copy it to a disk.  The commands `GZIP.EXE',
`RAWRITE.EXE', and `RAWRITE3.COM' can be found at `ftp.mcc.ac.uk' in
the directory `/pub/linux/mcc-interim/dos-utils'.  Transfer
`GZIPxxx.EXE' and one of the `RAWRITE' commands in binary mode.  (The
version number `xxx' is currently 123.) The command `GZIPxxx.EXE' is a
self-unpacking archive, which creates `GZIP.EXE' and a documentation
file.  Documentation for the two `RAWRITE' commands can be found in the
`dos-utils' directory with the commands; you should normally transfer
documentation files in text mode.  After unpacking `GZIP.EXE', you
should give the following commands:

     FORMAT A:
     GZIP -D BOOT.GZ
     RAWRITE
     Enter source file name: BOOT
     Enter destination drive: A:
     Please insert a formatted diskette into drive A: and press -ENTER- :

The program `RAWRITE3' is screen-oriented, and may work rather
faster than the older `RAWRITE'.

If you are installing Linux on a system which already contains a DOS
partition, you may find it convenient to put MCC packages in a single
directory on that partition.  You can also copy them to DOS format
floppies.  As explained above, the file names must be the same as in
the `packages' directory, though under DOS they will, of course, be in
upper-case.  If you get all packages, they will fit on floppies as
follows:

   3.5 inch high density floppies:

       disk 1     base, flex, gpp
       disk 2     bison, gccb, info
       disk 3     gcca, gdb, gprof, kermit, tcpip
       disk 4     gawk, groff, linux, tar

   5.25 inch high density floppies:

       disk 1     base, info, tar
       disk 2     bison, gcca, groff
       disk 3     gawk, gccb, gdb
       disk 4     gpp, kermit, tcpip
       disk 5     flex, gprof, linux

In the latter case, the final disk contains enough space for one of
the extra kernels, or for anything else you wish.  In either case the
maps package fits on the final disk as well.  If you wish to get all of
the extra packages and kernels, you can fit them on floppies like this:

   3.5 inch high density floppies:

       disk 1     base, gawk, gpp
       disk 2     elisp, gcca, tar
       disk 3     gccb, info, patches
       disk 4     groff, linux
       disk 5     bison, emacs, flex, gdb
       disk 6     locinf, manpages, tcpip
       disk 7     gprof, ide, ipide, kermit, maps

   5.25 inch high density floppies:

       disk 1     base, info, tar
       disk 2     bison, gcca, groff
       disk 3     gawk, gccb, gdb
       disk 4     gprof, linux
       disk 5     gpp, kermit, ipide
       disk 6     elisp, flex, tcpip
       disk 7     emacs, ide, maps
       disk 8     locinf, manpages, patches

This system allows you to create your own packages, which can be
installed along with mine.  They must be gzipped tar files with the
extension `.tgz'.  Each package is unzipped and untarred in the root
directory.  If it contains files `install.setup' and `install.clean',
these are executed as shell scripts respectively before and after
untarring the archive.  If you wish, you may include a file
`install.info', which is copied to the screen during installation.  The
MCC packages all contain a file filename`.crc', which must have the
same basename as the `.tgz' file, and which has been generated with the
command `brik -Gb'.  If such a file exists, the installation uses it to
verify the included checksums after `install.clean' is executed.

You may omit any packages you wish.  Obviously, you cannot recompile
the kernel unless you also install gcca and gccb.  Bison, flex, gdb,
gpp, and gprof are also of little use unless gcca and gccb are
installed.

The default kernel in the boot disk contain all SCSI disk drivers
and XT disk drivers in the kernel as distributed by Linus Torvalds, as
well as networking, NFS, and kernel maths coprocessor emulation.

It is also possible to install MCC interim packages from a directory
on a remote machine which can be mounted on your Linux system using NFS.
To do this, you must have a supported Ethernet card.  You must already
have networking software installed and configured.  If necessary, you
can install the base and tcpip packages from a floppy disk, get the
networking software working, and then install other packages.


Getting MCC interim Linux from the MCC shop
===========================================

MCC interim Linux is available from the MCC shop to members of the
University of Manchester and of UMIST.  You can buy a set of diskettes
containing the bootable root disk, all the packages, and the two
optional kernels with no SCSI support.  See above in this file, where
these optional kernels are described.  You can also obtain a free copy
of the printed documentation for MCC interim Linux.

                   MorseNet Subscription Package


Thank you for requesting information about MorseNet Flat-Rate Usenet and Email.
This package describes our services, rates, capabilities, and service expansion
schedule. At the end you will find a ASCII form which can be filled out and
returned to us in order that we may process your subscription request. You
may print this form, fill it out, and mail it to us. If you wish faster 
service, we recommend filling it out online and emailing back to us.
_
From now through September, 30th, all new accounts have the activation fee
and first months subscription fees waived. So, for the first month, you can
enjoy our service for absolutely free. There is no continuing obligation and
you can cancel it at any time.

INTRODUCTION
------------

MorseNet is a service offered by Morse Telecommunications which provides
dialup Usenet News and Internet Email feeds on an economical flat-rate basis. 
With a current daily average volume running between 60 and 70 megabytes, Usenet
is an unparalleled source of news and information. Operating as a massive,
distributed bulletin board, topics ranging from Alterative lifestyles to
Zoological information are available for reading and open discussion. Some
of the more popular areas offer both source code and programs for many popular
computers including the IBM PC and Compatibles, Apple Computers, Sun
Workstations and many other systems.

Through our service, you may choose to receive some or all of these groups
for one low, monthly subscription rate. You choose which groups you want, and
those which you do not want. The information you receive is entirely at your
descretion and you may change your feed characteristics as often as you like.


WHAT IS REQUIRED?
-----------------

At a minimum, you should be capable of running the UUCP file transfer
protocol. This will be enough to allow you to receive Internet Email, although
you may want to augment your software to include more full-featured mail
programs and/or newsreading software.

To receive Usenet News, you should be running a version of Usenet News
Software. Again, if you're running Unix, you may already have the software
required to process newsfeeds, although this isn't always included on Unix
systems. Unix versions of all popular news reading and processing systems
are available on MorseNet.


WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE THE PROPER SOFTWARE?
-----------------------------------------

Versions of UUCP and Netnews software for several popular computers are
available at no charge to MorseNet subscribers. With your subscription,
you may elect to receive a starter UUCP disk for your system type. This will
enable you to establish a link to our system in order to download the Netnews
software and other utilities you might desire.

For PC's we provide FSUUCP, precompiled and ready to go. You only need 
configure it to go online. For Unix sytems, we'll send you the latest version
of Taylor UUCP, in source form, which will need to be compiled and configured
for your local system.

Please note: All utilities we offer subscribers are either public domain 
or shareware. We provide these programs as a convenience to you so that you
may get online with a minimum of fuss. Some of these programs may require
that you pay the respective authors for their continued usage. Please read
the documentation that accompanies each package for more details.

We do not sell these applications. By the same token, we don't want to
get into the habit of supporting them. However, we understand that for many
sites the initial learning curve associated with establishing UUCP links can
be considerable. Therefore, we will offer *some* assistance in order to help
you get online. Contact us if you have difficulties.


SUBSCRIPTION RATES
------------------

We offer two types of subscription, with either having the option of
Internet Email or Internet Email Plus Netnews. Our rates are as follows:

Type Account		Email Only	Email & Netnews
Student (1)		 $5.95/Month	$12.95/Month
Personal Account	 $9.95/Month	$19.95/Month		
BBS (2)			$19.95/Month	$39.95/Month
Corporate Account	$29.95/Month	$79.95/Month

(1) You must provide us with a photocopy or fax of a valid student
    identification card to qualify for this low rate.

(2) For BBS's with less than 500 users.


All accounts offer the same, flat-rate, no connect-charge, unlimited
amount of service. Corporate accounts allow an unlimited number of users
to access our services. To qualify for student rates, you must fax or mail
us a copy of your school identification card or other suitable documentation.


REACHING US
-----------

You can connect to our computers via our direct dialup lines in the 516 area
code. In September we plan to offer additional POPs (Points of Presence) in
the 718 and 212 area codes. Service to additional areas will follow as
required.

Additionally, we are investigating several other means of communication,
including the use of either Compuserve or GTE Sprint's packet networks. This
will allow us to offer local dialup numbers in most of the country to those
sites wishing to save on telcommunications costs. 

All of our modems offer connections from 300 to 14.4/Kbps. While it is entirely
feasable to use 300 baud for Internet Email, you should bear in mind that 
Netnews volume can be substantial. You should have at least a 9600 baud or
better modem if you plan to take anything more than a token newsfeed. Most
sites receiving substantial feeds use 14.4/Kbps modems.


PLANNED UPGRADES
----------------

In November, we plan on installing a dedicated 56K/bps link to the Internet.
This will allow an ever quicker turnaround time on news and email than that
presently available.

Late September will see the inauguration of our MorseLink Service, dialup,
interactive Unix accounts with access to Netnews and Internet Email. The
later inclusion of Internet connectivity will add FTP, TELNET and other 
popular services to the compliment of features available. Watch for more
announcements on this exciting development. This will also be a flat-rate,
"as much as you want", type service.

All Linux software is freely available on the Internet and on many
BBS's.  You may FTP Linux from the Internet sites TSX-11.MIT.EDU or
SUNSITE.UNC.EDU.  Unless otherwise stated all Linux software is
Copyright under the GNU GPL.

We do *NOT* simply install SLS, TAMU, or one of the other freely
available distributions and ship you the result.  Your kernel is
custom configured to your hardware.  Your XServer is custom configured
to your video card and monitor.  Many minor system configuration files
are correctly set up for you.  All of our binaries work.  We include
free software not usually part of any of the standard Linux releases.

		     Notes On Hardware Selection
		     ----- -- -------- ---------

If you're considering purchasing a machine from us, you might be
interested in the reasoning behind some of our hardware choices.

We use only Teac floppy disk drives.  We've had enough problems with
other brands of floppy disks that we think the slight extra cost for
Teac drives is well worth it.

Other SCSI controllers besides the Adaptec are cheaper.  However, the
Adaptec controllers work.  They're supported by every PC OS, and we've
never had any trouble with them.

The Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 Plus with the 17" Nanao F550i is our
favorite video card/monitor combination.  It's slightly more expensive
than the ET4000 card, but the S3 801 chipset gives better performance,
and it doesn't take a local bus slot.  We find running X11 on any
monitor less than 17" cramped.  (But maybe we're spoiled.)

			     Who Are We?
			     --- --- ---

We are a small software development company that discovered that
purchasing generic x86 hardware running Linux for software development
was often more economical than purchasing workstations from Sun, DEC,
HP, or IBM.  However, we discovered the hard way that purchasing and
configuring a Linux or commercial Un*x system is not a task for the
novice.  You need a combination of Un*x guru and PC hardware guru.  We
decided to put our experience to use by selling pre-installed
configured systems.

If you're considering purchasing an x86 machine to run Linux, or a
commercial Un*x, we suggest you look at the September 1993 and October
1993 issues of SunWorld.  They decided to install and review 4
different commercial Un*x variants.  It took them a month to do all
the installations.  We've installed MicroPort, Interactive, Linux, and
several other variants, and the people at SunWorld are right - it's a
painfull process.  Save yourself the pain by purchasing a
pre-installed system from us.

Subject: LINUX+386BSD CDROM; Trans-Ameritech
Status: RO

	NOT JUST ANOTHER LINUX + 386BSD CD-ROM.

Trans-Ameritech presents LINUX SLS/Slackware AND 386BSD and MULTYMEDIA CD-ROM.

A new Linux CD-ROM is available! But not just Linux. Also 386BSD and more.
Here is a brief summary of why we think this CD-ROM is the best.
As the price of only $30 puts it in the same price category as the JANA 
product, I'll base my comparison on it.


We provide 2 versions of SLS distribution - a very stable 1.02 and the new 1.03
and also the SLACKWARE distribution! Linux installs directly from the CD-ROM
on almost any hardware configuration.

1. The Trans-Ameritech Linux CD-ROM is not just a mirror of some ftp site. 
In addition to the full SLS distributions we supply a "live" image of a 
configured system. This is great if you don't want files that are not used 
very often to garble your hard disk. One example is manpages - use them 
directly from the CD-ROM. Same applies to emacs lisp files, info files etc.
How many fonts do you need? Have them all! Space is no problem.

2. Uncompressed sources are available for instant reference.

3. Several versions of the Linux kernel are provided precompiled to cover 
different hardware options including drivers for Sony-31A and Sound Blaster 
CD-ROMs.

4. Patches to support sound cards are included. Take this compiled kernel IF 
YOU WANT. If not - use a small kernel with no unused ballast.

5. Install Linux directly from the Sony-31A or Sound Blaster CD-ROM drive as
well as standart SCSI and Mitsumi types.

6. We are running Linux on several PCs to make sure that our configurations
really work. We don't wait for official SLS release for certain extra drivers
and utilities. If they work here, we include it as an option on the CDROM.

7. For your convenience a full recent distribution of 386BSD *NIX is provided
on the same CD-ROM.

8. Some space is dedicated to what takes too much room on hard disks - 
sounds and pictures. They are usable with the Linux sound/gif tools and under 
MS-DOS too!

9. A few choice MS-DOS applications are included in the assumption that the
majority of Linux users run DOS occasionaly. Or use it from dos-emu!
Most of the MS-DOS stuff comes from the SIMTEL20 archive. Naturally only part 
of it made it to the first CDROM. However the new releases will include other 
files from SIMTEL20, GARBO etc. So if you subsribe to the Trans-Ameritech 
Linux+ CDROM, you will not only get updated Linux, but over a year you will get
the full SIMTEL20 collection as an extra bonus.

10. Trans-Ameritech is a well established company with efficient organization
to guarantee on-time printing and shipping of this product. There will be a
significant discount if you subscribe for future releases.

But the best part is that YOU will decide what to put on the next edition!
We'll count votes and provide most popular software on the next one.

Credit card orders are wellcome. Call Trans-Ameritech at (408) 727- 3883.

Subject: Linux CD-ROM bimonthly; JANA Publishing
Status: RO

Hello,

I have been getting a lot of questions on the low cost Linux
CD-ROM I am doing. Due to the large volume of E-Mail I am sorry
that I could not give individual answers, So I have made the
following FAQ which should give answers to the most common
questions, if you have any more questions please call me at
1-800-363-2083.

What is Linux CD-ROM bimonthly ?

        Once every two months you will get a CD-ROM with Linux and
Linux related software, SLS, comp.os.linux.* archives, FAQ's
etc. This project was started so people without net access or
slow connections to the net can obtain Linux. The first disk contains
about 150 Megs of Linux related software including the 0.99pl5

Will this CD-ROM work on my drive ?

        If you can read your a CD-ROM from Dos then you can use this CD.
This CD is in ISO 9660 format. To install Linux you have to copy
some files from the CD to floppy disks and then install.

How many subscribers are there ?

        At present about 200 but we are growing very fast. Also we have
about 300 subscribers in the NeXT computer side so we are not a
fly by night company.

How much does it cost ?

One sample issue U$25.00
One year subscription U$59.95
Two year subscription U$99.95

If you purchase a subscription you will get 6 CD-ROM's a year.

Do you ship to foreign countries ?

Yes, if you live outside of US or Canada then One sample issue
will cost you U$29.95 and subscription will cost you an
additional $20( So one year is = U$79.95 ) per year for air-shipments.
Payments should be made in U$ cheques or in International Money Orders.
We do not take credit cards at this time.

Why should I subscribe ?

With each subscription you will get the updated version of
Linux. Also new Linux related software and comp.sys.archives.
Also we are selling you a subscription(6 CD-ROM's) for the
price of what others charge for one disk :-).

How can I order ?

        E-Mail me your address and phone number and I will put a disk
on mail for you. Once the disk arrives you can send us a cheque
or money order. If you don't like the disk then you can send it
back to us too but no one has done that so far.

When will my CD-ROM ship ?

        All orders received before 10th April 1993 has been shipped,
any orders after that will ship on 30th of April 1993. Shipment
is done in bulk to save on postage.

Do you provide technical support ?

        Nope, we are not selling Linux, we are just a distrubuter. Our
job is to get Linux in your hands on a affordable way. If you
have technical questions, then you can find them in the FAQ's or
on the comp.os.linux  group. The disk contain information on how
to install Linux on your system.

How can I submit software ?

        If you are on the Internet, you can submit Linux software which
you have either written or ported by uploading it to the FTP
archive site tsx-11.mit.edu.  After you upload it, please send
mail to ftp-linux@tsx-11.mit.edu.  Software thus uploaded will
generally be included in the next CD-ROM.

PS : No flames please, at this low price I can't place a ad on BYTE or
PC Mag and still make a bug so I have to use the Net :-). Also tell your
friends about this CD-ROM

ANOUNCEMENT FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE!

* As of June 20, 1993 if you order the entire set of the SLS, you will
  receive printed documentation of all 152 pages of the Frequently
  Asked Questions!  You will also receive printed copies of all other
  necessary text files.

* The shipping and handling costs changes from $10.00 to $15.00,
  all other costs remain the same.

* Before you mail your order "finger tguez@jade.tufts.edu | more" to 
  see the latest annoucement and pricing.

* So don't waste your time downloading 30MG+ of data, it doesn't worth
  your time and energy!  And now that you also get 152 pages of printed
  documentation, why should you fish around 300+ messages a day tring 
  to get answers to your questions, when you can just sit back, relax
  and read at your leisure.

  Besides what is a better way to reduce the traffic on comp.os.linux?


Linux is free and can be obtained from numerous ftp sites such as
tsx-11.mit.edu and sunsite.unc.edu under GNU license.

Downloading the entire SLS with a 9600 baud connection takes about 8
hours, and with a 2400 baud connection about 20 hours.  Instead of
wasting all this time and energy order the entire SLS on disks for a
modest price:


	US$1.5 	copying charge per disk
	US$1.2 	per 3 1/2 disk
	US$1.0 	per 5 1/4 disk

	US$15.0   Shipping and handling 


Your *TOTAL* price (includes shipping costs)       
Series		#Disks		(3 1/2)		(5 1/2)	     
a		4		$25.80	  	$25.00

(all prices are in US$, not including Tax if in MA)

Of course one can order individual disks, series or any combinations.
Prices may change at any time without notice.  Please add 5% tax, if in
MA.

To order:
		Mail a check or money order in advance 
		for the	entire sum, and receive the disks
		UPS or by AirMail, as appropriate.

NOTE: All disks are verified *twice* before they are mailed.  All
shipment leave us within a week with a blue UPS label (2nd day air) or
Air-Mail, as appropriate.


	When you order please include:
	
	1) Your name
	2) Phone number, (and an email address if possible)
	3) a UPS deliverable address
	4) The type of *boot* disks you need 5 1/4 or 3 1/2
	   (note: only disk a1 is required to boot)
	5) The type (5 1/4 or 3 1/2) of non-booting disks
 	   you would like.

	Please mail your order to:

		ATC, Computer Science Dept.
		31 Memorial Dr., P.O.Box 504
		Avon, MA 02322
		
		Please make check payable to ATC, Computer Science Dept.
			
		Questions can be addressed to:
		 tguez@jade.tufts.edu
		

	Also available is our SLS accessory disk which contains
	all the necessary utilities to setup partitions, setup
	up sls to boot from HD (easily), and a few more
	invaluable dos/linux utils that do not come
	with the SLS and are certainly necessary to complete
	the integration: $1.5 copying charge, $1.0 for 5 1/4 disk
	or $1.2 for 3 1/2 disk.

        When a new version of the SLS is available, you may
        send back your disks to receive a copy of the new
        version.  You will only be charged with a copy charge
        of the usual $1.5 per disk updated.  If any of your disks
        becomes defective by the time it reaches us, we will
        replace it for you with the usual $1.0 for 5 1/2 or $1.2
        for 3 1/4 for each defective disk.

	Do not waste time downloading something of that size,
	order it-- it's worth it.


Comments:  
1) Any GNU software is freely distributable.  Hence, if you
want to divide the cost among several friends and use the same
installation disks, then that is perfectly legal and a nice way to
save money!

2) We don't simply download.  The system is installed on a 486/50DX
16MB machine and on a 386/16SX 4MB machine to make sure that the new
release is stable.  If not, we fix things to make it more stable and
useable.

		        Version 1.0
		     September 9, 1993

  Announcing Version 1.0 of the Linux from Nascent distribution on
cdrom in ISO9660 format with Rock Ridge extensions.

  Linux is a freely distributable Unix(R) compatible operating system
for the IBM(R) 386/486 PC and compatibles written by Linus Torvalds
from the University of Helsinki, Finland.  It was developed by a
unique world-wide collaboration of programmers over the internet, and
is covered by the GNU General Public License.  It is a modern, high
performance network operating system, much like ones used for years on
engineering and professional workstations.

  The Linux from Nascent cdrom is an entirely new distribution of the
Linux operating system, and includes over 400 mbytes of source code,
binaries, and documentation for Linux and applications.  The Linux
from Nascent distribution features:

* cdrom demo account
* dos install script to create boot and root floppies directly from cdrom
* automated root, swap, and package installation from cdrom
* simple user account and network administration scripts
* Linux 0.99.12 plus net-2 networking
* extensive online documentation and manuals
* network printer support
* X Window System(TM)
* OpenLook(TM) 3d window manager
* SCSI disk and tape support
* TeX(TM) and ghostscript word processor and viewer
* Ingres database management
* GNU C compiler and utilities
* GNU emacs, vi clone text editors
* sound and graphics support
* Over 100 high resolution images translated from Kodak PhotoCD(TM)
* magic, spice, and chipmunk electronic design tools
* GNU Chess, Shogi, pooltable, xpilot, flight simulator, ...
  
  The Linux from Nascent application archives have been organized
using a consistent makefile interface; the vast majority compile and
install without modification.  Each archive comes with an associated
notes file that lets you browse collections of archives to see what's
available, along with its current status.

  Version 1.0 is only $89.95 plus shipping and handling, and comes
with an 30-day unconditional money-back guarantee.  If after 30 days
you aren't completely satisfied, return the cdrom with your receipt
and the purchase price will be refunded to you.  In addition, there is
a one time BACK TO SCHOOL SPECIAL: save 25% off the purchase price,
good now through the month of September 1993.  Registered owners of
Version 1.0 of the Linux from Nascent cdrom will receive email
support, and a 30% discount off a future release of the cdrom.

  A listing of the contents of the cdrom as well as a current copy of
this announcement and order form may be obtained via anonymous ftp at
netcom.com:/pub/nascent.  An order form is also included below.

Subject: Getting SLS on CDROM and floppies; Softlanding Software

         Announcment of the SLS 1.04 CD-ROM

The second SLS CDROM begins shipping this week from Softlanding.
Quarterly holders and preorders should be receiving their copies within
the next 10 days or so.  Following is a description of what
SLS 1.04 contains:

 - Linux 99p13 (with SB and Panasonic CD, ifs, quota, and loop)
 - sound and joystick patches
 - gcc 2.4.5
 - libc 4.4.2
 - XFree86 1.3

Whats New
---------

Aside from a great many updates, additions and bug fixes over the last 
release, this new version of SLS has enhanced the number and types of 
installation and operational configurations.  This is due, in part, to 
recent changes in the Linux kernel.  These changes mean that binaries run 
from NFS or CD mount points can now make use of the same memory saving features 
of the kernel (such as shared text and demand loading) that harddisk
resident software enjoys.  Even shared libraries can now be executed from such 
mount points.

Consequently, as of release 1.04, the SLS CDROM supports execution
from the CDROM, either in whole or in part, directly or indirectly.  
In the same vein, the 'a' series in SLS now forms a small 
stand alone system of about 12 Meg that includes the networking stuff.  
This allows a local minimal installation to use a remote mount,
(either NFS, CDROM or a local partition) while having all of the features 
of a full installation.  Contents of the minimal installation
include enough so that the user is not crippled if the mount point
is not available (say the CD is not available because you are listening
to Bach, or due to a network outage).

The core of SLS is still comprised of the collection of packages which fit 
onto 30 - 5.25 inch (or 25 - 3.5 inch) disks.  

Structurally the major change is to the /usr directory, whose contents can 
now be considered to be read-only.  Writable components have been
moved to /local, and soft links to /local established in their place.
For added flexibility, /usr/local has been left empty, so that locally
installed packages can be maintained separately from the SLS distribution.

Installation Options
--------------------

As before, SLS can be installed using a number of methods.  The presence
of the floppy distribution not only ensures installability from unsupported
CD drives, but also aids in sharing and redistribution.  Installation 
options now include:

 a) Install directly from CDROM
 b) Install from CD, over the network (3.5 boot only)
 c) Install /install/* packages, over the network (from 3.5 boot only)
 d) xcopy /install directory to a DOS hard drive for installation
 e) Copy the /install/* packages to a DOS floppies
 f) tar the /install/* packages to Tape for installation
	
The directory /install contains the directories of packages, organized
for 5 1/4 inch floppy: one directory per floppy.   The directory
/install.3 contains the same, except organized for (25) 3 1/2 inch floppies.
Additionally, /install.all contains all packages, not organized into
subdirectories at all. (Note: contents of install.3 and install.all are
all just links so as to not waste CD real estate.  In fact, this uses
only around 5% of the space on the CDROM).  The procedure for floppy installs 
is simply to copy the contents of each directory to a floppy.  The exception 
being a1, which not a directory, but rather a boot disk.  This can be 
put on floppy using RAWRITE.EXE under DOS.

Primary Operational Modes
-------------------------
The primary operational modes include:

 1) bootdisk as root and mounting CD on /mnt
 2) CD as root, with no writable file space
 3) CD as root, with a small (600K+) ramdisk
 4) CD as root, with a partition mounted on /local
 5) mini install (~12 Meg) and mounting CD on /mnt
 6) mini install and NFS mounting remote CD on /mnt
 7) mini install and NFS mounting remote SLS on /mnt
 8) full install

To use 1 above, the bootdisk now includes a demo login, that sets 
up a few things for you, mounts the CD (or partition or NFS mount),
and then drops you into X windows (either Xview or FVWM) where you can run
most anything you like, from Andrew to flight simulator, picked off
of menu selections.

Although options are pretty restrictive in 2 above (simple things such as
vi, syslogd and df won't work without a writable filesystem),  3 provides 
a functional CD based operating environment that requires no disk space, 
and uses less than half of the RAM for ramdisk that the bootdisk install does.

Despite the freedom from disk commitments of the above, it is likely
many will decide to use installation options 4 or above, partially
because a network or CD is not always available, but also to 
avoid giving up any any RAM to ramdisk requirments.  There is also
the need for some swap space.  

Swap space aside, the minimal
install can easily be reduced to far less than 12 Meg by some judicious 
pruning (although this will increase dependency upon the server).
But since the definition of essential will vary from individual to individual, 
a more likely scenario is that often used packages may end up being copied from 
the server to the local partition.  For example, having vi and the user files on
the local partition means that work need not stop if the network/CD goes away.
The process of upgrading can also be far less traumatic.


CDROM Contents
--------------

The binaries on the CDROM are a superset of the SLS 1.04 floppy installation
(with some modifications peculiar to the CD environment, in some cases).  
The standard SLS install comprises: 

	Programs such as spreadsheets, drawing, LaTeX, and doc (a WYSIWYG).
	Language support: Assembler, Lisp, Pascal, Fortran and Perl.
	GNU compilers: C and C++ with development libraries.
	Communications: uucp, mail, news, tcp/ip and nfs.
	Source code: for kernel and other important components.
	Documentation: Megs of man pages and info files.
	X-Windows: X11R5, XView/OpenLook and Tcl/Tk.
	Over 600 utilities.

The total system weighs in at just over 100 Meg of disk space, not
including swap and user file space.  

Given it's greater capacity however, the CDROM contains additional
binaries, including things like ObjectBuilder/Object Interface, 
Andrew, image processing software like ImageMagick, Objective C, 
Postgres, and a dozens of games like Flight Simulator and Xtank.

For source code, a listing of the two main source directories, 
/usr/src and /usr/src/Xapps, which contain the bulk of the source 
on the CD, is appended to the end of this message.

------------

SLS is available on floppies, or QIC150 tape, or with full source on CDROM,

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                                           7 October 1993

        SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA--Yggdrasil Computing, Incorporated is now
shipping LGX, a multimedia PC UNIX(R) clone competitive with Solaris
and Windows NT.  The 680-megabyte system includes the Postgres
database, the "Andrew" multimedia document system, seventeen optional
software packages, complete source code, and most importantly,
numerous features designed to make LGX easier, and therefore cheaper,
to install and maintain than other operating systems.  These
ease-of-use features include a manual with illustrations of what the
screen should look like at each step of installation, plug-and-play
operation, an easy-to-use installation mechanism, graphical "fill in
the blanks" control panels for easy system configuration, and other
enhancements.

	LGX is named after three of its principal components: the
Linux kernel, the GNU software suite, and the X window system.  LGX is
free software, so no license fees are necessary for LGX development to
be done by in house programmers, consultants, or anybody.  The LGX
manual lists support vendors, and Yggdrasil also offers such services,
including a 900 number for instant help with Linux-related questions.

	Yggdrasil is greatly indebted to the many free software developers
whose efforts have made this release possible.  As a token of appreciation,
any author of anything in LGX can get a free copy.  Other major contributors
to the Linux community and Operators of free Linux BBS's or Linux FTP sites
can also get a free copy.  For everyone else, LGX costs $49.95.

	For more information or to order, call 24 hours a day toll
free (800) 261-6630 or (408) 261-6630, or fax (408) 261-6631, or send
email to yci@netcom.com.  All individual direct sales orders received
before 6PM Eastern/3PM Pacific are shipped by an overnight delivery
service.  Reseller inquiries welcome.

Laboratories.

HIGHLIGHTS

	LGX is the first operating system distribution to include
Carnegie-Mellon University's Andrew system for processing documents
with embedded images, hypertext links, spreadsheets and other media.
Other document preparation facilities include TeX, groff, and the
"GhostScript" PostScript clone, all with X windows previewers.  For
editting files, LGX includes vi and two multiwindowing version of the
emacs text editor: FSF Emacs 19.19 and Lucid GNU Emacs 19.8.

	LGX now includes the ImageMagic viewer for JPEG, GIF, and TIFF
images, in addition to the MPEG video player that was in the LGX beta
release.  The X windows configuration script now supports resolutions
up to 1152x900 non-interlaced for sufficiently fast video cards such as
the ATI Ultra Pro.  Sound support has been expanded with the adagio
program.  General multimedia support has been expanded not only with
the inclusion of the Andrew system, but also with the addition of the
metamail system for processing multimedia mail.  The news reader and
the mailer have been configured to automatically invoke metamail when
they display MIME-format messages.

	LGX is also the first operating system to include Postgres,
the new remote database system developed at the University of
California, Berkeley to succeed Ingres.  A programming interface
between Postgres and the popular Tk/Tcl X windows toolkit for rapid
graphical interface development is included.  Tk/Tcl is similar to
NeXTStep, but runs under the industry standard X Window System.  The
version of Tk/Tcl is new and corresponds to the langauge described the
forthcoming book by Tk/Tcl's author, John Ousterhout.  Other X windows
programming toolkits include Xview for making OpenLook(tm)
applications, the InterViews C++ X windows toolkit, and the standard
MIT X windows libraries, including Xlib and Xt.  A version of Motif
that can be installed from the LGX graphical control panels will be
available soon.

	LGX's software development environment now includes software
quality tools such as DejaGnu for automated testing, the GNU Coverage
Tool to verify test coverage, Gnats for bug tracking and its graphical
user interface, TkGnats, and the Revision Control System and the
Concurrent Version System for maintaining source trees.  Of course,
the development environment also includes the GNU ANSI C and C++
compilers, the GNU debugger, GNU make, byacc, flex, and the GNU binary
utilities.

	Other features of LGX include "calc" mode for manipulating
mathematical equations in emacs, ethernet TCP/IP networking, UUCP,
the inn news transport system, and new additions to the games library,
including asteroids, battle zone, chess, mille bornes, othello, pool,
shogi, solitaire, tetris, and Connect Four.

EASE-OF-USE FEATURES

	LGX not only contains lots of software that no other
operating system distribution has, but also has numerous ease-of-use
features that have been engineered into LGX to make unix(r)-like
operating systems accessible to more people, and to reduce
installation and maintenance problems.

	LGX is distributed on a plug-and-play CDROM with a boot
floppy, so it can be started by just turning on a computer with the
CDROM and boot floppy inserted.  LGX will detect what kind of CDROM
you have and will automatically use it.  At each step of installation,
the system prompts the user with a paragraph or more of explanation
and provides sensible default responses when possible.  The LGX manual
provides supplemental information and screen snapshots of each step of
installation, including configuration of X windows.  After
installation, LGX's "fill in the blanks" graphical control panels make
it easy to configure the ethernet or the printer, make a boot floppy,
install optional software packages, or do a number of other system
configuration tasks.

	LGX's ease-of-use features extend beyond software configuration.
For example, if you do not have a sound card, LGX will automatically
use the built-in PC speaker to play sounds.  If you do not specify a
filesystem format when you mount a disk, LGX will automatically
determine and use the correct filesystem format.  If a non-postscript
printer has been configured with the graphical control panel, the
"lpr" command will automatically invoke GhostScript to process any
Postscript file sent to the printer, so the printer would as what
would happen if the printer had PostScript built in.  The default
window manager, fvwm, is configured to enable many of LGX's features
and online documentation facilities to be invoked from the root menu.
The twm window manager is also configured with the same menus, and
fvwm has menu entires to switch to other window managers.  All of
these facilities make the facilities of LGX more accessible to users.

	For more information or to order, call 24 hours a day toll
free (800) 261-6630 or (408) 261-6630, or fax to (408) 261-6631.
