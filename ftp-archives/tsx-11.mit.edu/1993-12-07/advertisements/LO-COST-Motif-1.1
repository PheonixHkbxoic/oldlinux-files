OSF/Motif 1.1 is finally available for Linux.

The distribution is BINARY ONLY and is NOT FREE because of OSF licensing
policy and royalty payment scheme.

I have organized the following distribution tree:

    bin:
    mwm*	uil*	xgen*
    
    include:
    Mrm/	Xm/	uil/
    
    lib:
    X11/	libMrm.a	libUil.a	libXm.a
    
    lib/X11:
    XKeysymDB	app-defaults/	config.Motif/	system.mwmrc
    
    demos:
    Imakefile	 hellohebrew/	motifburger/	mre/		widgetView/
    Makefile	 hellokanji/	motifburint/	periodic/	xmsamplers/
    dogs/	 hellomotif/	motifgif/	periodickanji/
    fonts/	 motifanim/	motifshell/	uilsymdump/
    
    xgenDemos:
    Example	Xgen.intro	dp.xbm		mtn.xbm
    README.EX	address.list	gnu.xbm

As you will probably have noted I have included all the demos released
by OSF and one non OSF applications; it is xgen, a very usefull tool
for creating graphical frontends to shell scripts or other Unix programs;
xgen was written by kurt@zorro.cecer.army.mil.
As I discover Motif based applications that are freely redistributable
I will include them in the release. There is no such thing as run-time
or development version; everything is included.

Everything is ready to run; you just have to load it on your Linux machine.
The obvious prerequisite is that you have a working X11 on your system.

The size of a gzip-ed tar distribution is about 7.5M. No OSF documentation
is included due to it's size and to the fact that it is easier to 
purchase the Prentice-Hall books than printing it. Anyway if you really
want the original OSF PostScript docs we can make arrangements for including
it.

At the moment I have used three mediums to distribute the product
	1) QIC-24 tape
	2) ftp
	3) floppies (tar or DOS)

The first two (tape and ftp) are preferred due to the effort required
in producing floppies. The ftp method is probably the fastest since
all I need is a temporary account on your machine in order to upload
37 files of 204800 bytes each. From my location to any machine with a IP
address and a reasonable connection the transfer typically takes from 30
minutes to an hour.

The cost of OSF/Motif for Linux is $150 + POSTAGE. I can accept VISA
and Master cards. In case you choose a ftp distribution there is no postage,
but I will charge you a fixed $10 to cover my phone costs.
The postage costs for tape or floppies depend greatly on the destination
and the speed required. Simple AIR MAIL to USA is about $15, express mail
to Germany is DM 32 and a comparable price to the rest of Europe.

I can offer email, fax, phone (the order represents preference) support 
for initial installation problems.

All the development was done using Linux SLS 1.01 on a 386 machine so
this should be a pretty standard platform.
