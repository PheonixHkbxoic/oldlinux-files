                INSTALLATION SUPPORT SERVICES


	Mountain Alternative Systems offers a full range of Linux
services.  These services are setup for novice users who are new to
Linux and possibly new to *nix in general.  All newbie questions are
answered, and no one is flamed for not looking in the FAQ. 

	Our purpose is to reduce traffic in the news groups, and help
unsophisticated computer users who would become frustrated with trying
to download Linux and figure it out on their own.
