		       Installed Linux Systems
		       --------- ----- -------

Complete Un*x-clone systems featuring Linux pre-installed and custom
configured for your system.  Linux is a free Un*x-like implementation
authored by Linus Torvalds.  As shipped from us, Linux has many of the
features of commercial Un*x implementations and more.  When you buy a
system from us, you get a complete, running Linux system tuned exactly
to your system.  Your kernel is compiled with exactly the support you
need for your hardware.  Your X11 server is configured precisely for
your video card and monitor combination.  WE KNOW LINUX!  Why spend
hours downloading and swapping floppies?  Why spend hours tuning your
XConfig to your video/monitor combination?  Why spend hours reading
FAQs to figure out what hardware and software combinations work, what
Linux release to try, and how to install it?  We give you a machine
that is ready to run with a complete, tuned Linux installation.

		     Notes On Hardware Selection
		     ----- -- -------- ---------

If you're considering purchasing a machine from us, you might be
interested in the reasoning behind some of our hardware choices.

We use only Teac floppy disk drives.  We've had enough problems with
other brands of floppy disks that we think the slight extra cost for
Teac drives is well worth it.

Other SCSI controllers besides the Adaptec are cheaper.  However, the
Adaptec controllers work.  They're supported by every PC OS, and we've
never had any trouble with them.

The Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 Plus with the 17" Nanao F550i is our
favorite video card/monitor combination.  It's slightly more expensive
than the ET4000 card, but the S3 801 chipset gives better performance,
and it doesn't take a local bus slot.  We find running X11 on any
monitor less than 17" cramped.  (But maybe we're spoiled.)

			     Who Are We?
			     --- --- ---

We are a small software development company that discovered that
purchasing generic x86 hardware running Linux for software development
was often more economical than purchasing workstations from Sun, DEC,
HP, or IBM.  However, we discovered the hard way that purchasing and
configuring a Linux or commercial Un*x system is not a task for the
novice.  You need a combination of Un*x guru and PC hardware guru.  We
decided to put our experience to use by selling pre-installed
configured systems.

If you're considering purchasing an x86 machine to run Linux, or a
commercial Un*x, we suggest you look at the September 1993 and October
1993 issues of SunWorld.  They decided to install and review 4
different commercial Un*x variants.  It took them a month to do all
the installations.  We've installed MicroPort, Interactive, Linux, and
several other variants, and the people at SunWorld are right - it's a
painfull process.  Save yourself the pain by purchasing a
pre-installed system from us.
