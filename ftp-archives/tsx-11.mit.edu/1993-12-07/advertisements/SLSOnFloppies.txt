Linux is free and can be obtained from numerous ftp sites such as

together by Softlanding Software and is also GNU software found in
tsx-11.mit.edy (among other places).

hours, and with a 2400 baud connection about 20 hours.  And yet others
do not have Internet connection at all. Instead of wasting time and
energy order the entire SLS on disks for a modest price:


        US$1.5  copying charge per disk
        US$1.2  per 3 1/2 disk
        US$1.0  per 5 1/4 disk
