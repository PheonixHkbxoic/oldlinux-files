EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                                           7 October 1993

        SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA--Yggdrasil Computing, Incorporated is now
shipping LGX, a multimedia PC UNIX(R) clone competitive with Solaris
and Windows NT.  The 680-megabyte system includes the Postgres
database, the "Andrew" multimedia document system, seventeen optional
software packages, complete source code, and most importantly,
numerous features designed to make LGX easier, and therefore cheaper,
to install and maintain than other operating systems.  These
ease-of-use features include a manual with illustrations of what the
screen should look like at each step of installation, plug-and-play
operation, an easy-to-use installation mechanism, graphical "fill in
the blanks" control panels for easy system configuration, and other
enhancements.

        LGX is named after three of its principal components: the
Linux kernel, the GNU software suite, and the X window system.  LGX is
free software, so no license fees are necessary for LGX development to
be done by in house programmers, consultants, or anybody.  The LGX
manual lists support vendors, and Yggdrasil also offers such services,
including a 900 number for instant help with Linux-related questions.

        Yggdrasil is greatly indebted to the many free software developers
whose efforts have made this release possible.  As a token of appreciation,
any author of anything in LGX can get a free copy.  Other major contributors
to the Linux community and Operators of free Linux BBS's or Linux FTP sites
can also get a free copy.  For everyone else, LGX costs $49.95.

        For more information or to order, call 24 hours a day toll
free (800) 261-6630 or (408) 261-6630, or fax (408) 261-6631, or send
email to yci@netcom.com.  All individual direct sales orders received
before 6PM Eastern/3PM Pacific are shipped by an overnight delivery
service.  Reseller inquiries welcome.

HIGHLIGHTS

        LGX is the first operating system distribution to include
Carnegie-Mellon University's Andrew system for processing documents
with embedded images, hypertext links, spreadsheets and other media.
Other document preparation facilities include TeX, groff, and the
"GhostScript" PostScript clone, all with X windows previewers.  For
editting files, LGX includes vi and two multiwindowing version of the
emacs text editor: FSF Emacs 19.19 and Lucid GNU Emacs 19.8.

        LGX now includes the ImageMagic viewer for JPEG, GIF, and TIFF
images, in addition to the MPEG video player that was in the LGX beta
release.  The X windows configuration script now supports resolutions
up to 1152x900 non-interlaced for sufficiently fast video cards such as
the ATI Ultra Pro.  Sound support has been expanded with the adagio
program.  General multimedia support has been expanded not only with
the inclusion of the Andrew system, but also with the addition of the
metamail system for processing multimedia mail.  The news reader and
the mailer have been configured to automatically invoke metamail when
they display MIME-format messages.

        LGX is also the first operating system to include Postgres,
the new remote database system developed at the University of
California, Berkeley to succeed Ingres.  A programming interface
between Postgres and the popular Tk/Tcl X windows toolkit for rapid
graphical interface development is included.  Tk/Tcl is similar to
NeXTStep, but runs under the industry standard X Window System.  The
version of Tk/Tcl is new and corresponds to the langauge described the
forthcoming book by Tk/Tcl's author, John Ousterhout.  Other X windows
programming toolkits include Xview for making OpenLook(tm)
applications, the InterViews C++ X windows toolkit, and the standard
MIT X windows libraries, including Xlib and Xt.  A version of Motif
that can be installed from the LGX graphical control panels will be
available soon.

        LGX's software development environment now includes software
quality tools such as DejaGnu for automated testing, the GNU Coverage
Tool to verify test coverage, Gnats for bug tracking and its graphical
user interface, TkGnats, and the Revision Control System and the
Concurrent Version System for maintaining source trees.  Of course,
the development environment also includes the GNU ANSI C and C++
compilers, the GNU debugger, GNU make, byacc, flex, and the GNU binary
utilities.

        Other features of LGX include "calc" mode for manipulating
mathematical equations in emacs, ethernet TCP/IP networking, UUCP,
the inn news transport system, and new additions to the games library,
including asteroids, battle zone, chess, mille bornes, othello, pool,
shogi, solitaire, tetris, and Connect Four.


EASE-OF-USE FEATURES

        LGX not only contains lots of software that no other
operating system distribution has, but also has numerous ease-of-use
features that have been engineered into LGX to make unix(r)-like
operating systems accessible to more people, and to reduce
installation and maintenance problems.

        LGX is distributed on a plug-and-play CDROM with a boot
floppy, so it can be started by just turning on a computer with the
CDROM and boot floppy inserted.  LGX will detect what kind of CDROM
you have and will automatically use it.  At each step of installation,
the system prompts the user with a paragraph or more of explanation
and provides sensible default responses when possible.  The LGX manual
provides supplemental information and screen snapshots of each step of
installation, including configuration of X windows.  After
installation, LGX's "fill in the blanks" graphical control panels make
it easy to configure the ethernet or the printer, make a boot floppy,
install optional software packages, or do a number of other system
configuration tasks.

        LGX's ease-of-use features extend beyond software configuration.
For example, if you do not have a sound card, LGX will automatically
use the built-in PC speaker to play sounds.  If you do not specify a
filesystem format when you mount a disk, LGX will automatically
determine and use the correct filesystem format.  If a non-postscript
printer has been configured with the graphical control panel, the
"lpr" command will automatically invoke GhostScript to process any
Postscript file sent to the printer, so the printer would as what
would happen if the printer had PostScript built in.  The default
window manager, fvwm, is configured to enable many of LGX's features
and online documentation facilities to be invoked from the root menu.
The twm window manager is also configured with the same menus, and
fvwm has menu entires to switch to other window managers.  All of
these facilities make the facilities of LGX more accessible to users.

                files, and a program to mount the CDROM are installed.
                Because CDROM drives are slow, the system is sluggish
                at startup, but becomes more responsive over the course
                of several minutes of use as commonly used files become
                cached in RAM. 

                RUNTIME: (27 megabytes): The kernel, configuration
                files, file utilities, and a tiny X window system are
                installed on the hard disk.  Other system programs can
                installed individually or run from the CDROM when it is
                mounted.

                COMPLETE: (235 megabytes):
                Everything except the non-kernel sources is installed on
                the hard disk.  Source code for the kernel is also
                installed on the hard disk.

HOW TO GET MORE INFORMATION

        The anonymous FTP area netcom.com:pub/yggdrasil contains more
information, including an "ls -RC" listing of the CD's contents,
reseller information, and copies of the manual in texinfo, DVI and
postscript.  If you want to view the DVI version of the manual with
xdvi, you can go to the table of contents with the command "84g".

        You can also request information by phone by calling 24 hours
a day toll free (800) 261-6630 or (408) 261-6630.  You can also fax
to (408) 261-6631, or send email to yci@netcom.com.  A fax server with
information on LGX will be available shortly from (408) 946-5080.
Request document 5491 ("LGX-1").


HOW TO GET A FREE COPY

        Yggdrasil is greatly indebted to the many free software
developers whose efforts have made this release possible.  As a token
of our appreciation, any author of any software or documentation in
LGX can get a free copy, which includes the CD, manual, and boot
floppies.  Operators of free Linux BBS's or Linux FTP sites and other
major contributors to the Linux community can also get a free copy.
We request that Linux BBS operators and FTP sites carry the LGX
announcement in the appropriate forums, however this request is
optional.


HOW TO GET A COPY BY TOMORROW

        LGX costs $49.95.  If you live in the United States, the
shipping and handling charge is $5.  All individual direct sales orders
from within the United States received before 6PM Eastern/3PM Pacific
are shipped by an overnight delivery service for delivery the next day.
To place an order, call (800) 261-6630.

        For international orders, next day service is not available
from Yggdrasil, although some resellers may offer it.  Shipping for
international orders is $10.  To place an international order, call
(408) 261-6630, or fax the order form to (408) 261-6631.


SUBSCRIPTIONS

        LGX is released quarterly.  Update subscriptions are
available and start with the release following the release that is
current when your subscription order is received.  For example, an
update subscription ordered today would begin with the Winter 1994
release.  Prices for update subscriptions are as follows:

        1 year (4 releases)             $ 99.95
        2 years (8 releases)            $179.95
        3 years (12 releases)           $249.95


UPGRADE PATH FROM THE BETA RELEASE

        If you mail the LGX beta CDROM, the LGX beta manual, both LGX
beta boot floppies to Yggdrasil before November 1, 1993, you will
receive a $10 discount on your order of the LGX Fall 1993.  You must
include your order and a check in the same package with your LGX beta
release.  If you buy the Fall 1993 release from a reseller or if you
bought the beta + 1st production release subscription, you can place
an order for an update subscription in this way instead.  Again, this
offer expires on November 1st.


TECHNICAL SUPPORT

        You can report bugs for free and we will try to make updated
lists of bugs and fixes publicly available in a timely manner.  In
addition, LGX has a 30 day unconditional money back guarantee, so you
are never at risk of being stuck with a system that you cannot use.

        In the past, we have had a substantial amount of requests for
technical support of a tutorial nature.  For example, callers often
want somebody to talk them through the installation process or have a
question which they could find the answer to by reading through
online documentation, but for which they could find the answer faster
by calling technical support.  Clearly, if an operating system as
powerful as LGX is going to take over the world, such a service must
be available.  On the other hand, in order for this service to scale,
it has to pay for itself.

        Therefore, we have established a 900 number in the United
States for general Linux technical support.  You do not need to be
using LGX or to be an Yggdrasil customer to use this service.  You can
call us with your questions not only about LGX, but also about
anything else related to Linux.  We cannot guarantee to know the
answer to all questions, but if we cannot answer your question, we
will try to point you in the right direction.  We will try to keep
your call as short as possible, but please be realistic in your
expectations of how long it takes to look up anything or to find the
right person in the office to answer question.  It will probably cost
you about $20 for a typical straightforward question.

                1-900-446-6075 ext. 835 ("TEK")
                $2.95/minute, USA only
                10am-noon,1:45pm-5pm Pacific

        The LGX manual lists vendors offering support services related
to the Yggdrasil Linux/GNU/X distribution.  If you or your business
would like to offer a service related to LGX, send a description of
your business and contact information to yggdrasil@netcom.com.  There
may also be an advertising section in the production release manuals
if there is interest.  It would be nice to have a longer list of
support vendors to disseminate in the publicity for the production
release.  If you have ideas for cooperation that you'd like explore,
please get in touch.
