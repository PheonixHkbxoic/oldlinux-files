TSX-11 does not yet have a mail server --- I'm working on it....

If you need mail service, please try the mail server available at
sunsite.unc.edu.  Mail ftpmail@sunsite.unc.edu for more information.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To upload stuff --- please use the directory /incoming.  It is
world-writable, but not world-readable, so you (or anybody else) will
not be able to see stuff which you drop there until we move it to the
proper place the directory hierarchy.  

Please send mail to ftp-linux@tsx-11.mit.edu after you leave something
there, so we can pick it up as soon as possible.  Get and read the file
/incoming/README for more *important* information on how to submit files
to the tsx-11 archive.
