	Here is a description of the stuff in this directory:

aha152x-*:
	SLS boot disk with aha152x support - this is something like a
pl13q kernel - pl14 contains this driver, so there is no need to grab this
if you have pl14 or later.

bench-*.tar.gz:
	Benchmarking code to determine how fast the buffer cache really
is and to help identify bottlenecks.  Runs as user mode program with
large parts of the kernel source code used.

buslogic.tar.gz:
	Driver for buslogic cards.  These will also work with the
Adaptec 1542 driver, but using a driver specific to the buslogic cards
has a few advantages.

cluster*.tar.gz:
	Patches to improve disk performance by clustering adjacent
buffers - we can do more scatter-gather this way.  There are a number
of other performance enhancements in here as well.

file.c:
	Used to determine file fragmentation.

in2000:
	A driver for the in2000 cards is in this directory.  It is not
very good yet (slow, and it crashes), but it might get you up and
running.

mt-st*:
	A program to control scsi tape drives (perhaps some non-scsi
tape drives as well, if the ioctls are the same).

pl14-patches:
	Patches to pl14 for one thing or another.

scsiinfo*.tar.gz:
	Program to query a scsi device for operating parameters,
defect lists, etc.  An X-based interface is availalble that requires
that you have Tk/Tcl/wish installed.  With the X-based interface you
can easily alter the settings on the drive.

sraw*.gz:
	Program to benchmark raw scsi I/O rates bypassing the buffer cache.
