ni5210-driver for Linux-net-2 by MH

Read the *.c headers for more informations

warning: the install-description is not for newbies :-)

If you set IE_BUS_SIZE to IE_16BIT and remove the ni5210_probe - function,
the driver should work without changes with the AT&T-Ethercard.
(without the ni5210probe you have no autoconfig, so you have to set all
important values like IRQ,SHMEM,IOPORT)
