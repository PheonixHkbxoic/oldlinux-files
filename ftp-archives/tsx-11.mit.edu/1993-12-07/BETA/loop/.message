NOTICE: If you are not FTP'ing from the U.S. or Canada, please DO NOT
get any files from this directory.  The current U.S. government
regulations assume that only U.S. programmers are intelligent enough
to write cryptographic programs, and so therefore prohibit the export
of cryptographic software.

In point of fact, the DES software contained in this directory was
developed outside the U.S., so if you are FTP'ing from outside of U.S.
or Canada, you can obtain copy of this software without violating U.S.
law by FTP'ing it from nic.funet.fi, in /pub/OS/Linux/BETA/loop.
My apologies to any inconvenience resulting from this crypto-fascism.
