Loop devices, version 0
=======================

Loop devices can be used to mount regular files, to put more than one
file system on a disk partition and to provide transparent data
encryption.

Note: This implementation differs from my old loop devices that are
      also found in some distributions of SLS.

Installation
------------

Create the device entries in /dev:

  for n in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7; do mknod /dev/loop$n b 12 $n; done

Apply the patch to your ALPHA 0.99pl10 kernel source:

  cd /usr/src/linux
  patch -s -p1 <lo.patch

If you want to use DES encryption, download the DES module and add it:

  cd /usr/src/linux
  gunzip <des.tar.z | tar xvf -
  rm kernel/des.o

Rebuild the kernel:

  make depend
  make zlilo		# or something like that
