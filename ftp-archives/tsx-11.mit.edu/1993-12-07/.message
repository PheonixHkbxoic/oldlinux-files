Welcome to the Linux FTP archive!

To get started, cd to the docs directory, and get and read the files
INFO-SHEET and META-FAQ.

The SLS distribution is in packages/SLS/
The GCC distribution is in packages/GCC/

In general, if you are looking for a file and can't find it in what you
think is an obvious place, get the file find-ls and search through it,
probably with the grep utility.  You may alternately get the file ls-lR,
or, to find a file that was recently uploaded easily, the file ls-ltR.

If you have something to upload, please cd to /incoming, and read the
message you get and the file README in that directory.
