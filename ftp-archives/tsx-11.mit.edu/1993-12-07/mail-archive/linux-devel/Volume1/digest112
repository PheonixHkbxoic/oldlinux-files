Is this a problem when you have a talk session going on your Linux
box? Have you tried recompiling the talk daemon itself?

Yes, both talkd and talk have been recompiled and put into place.
I just got the "real" pl 13, though, and it does seem to work just fine.
How odd that the intermediate kernels didn't work.....

Anyone know of a fix for this?  Why did it happen?  The file system has
been fsck'd, many times.  It comes up clean every time.  I have bombed
the system, but the drives get fsck'd upon boot up everytime (in other
words, I don't the filesystems "dirty")

I, too, am seeing timeouts with two SCSI disks and a Tandberg 3600 tape
drive. All are internal with the Tandberg at the end of the chain and 
terminated.  Unfortunately, I'm also seeing 'in2000_abort' with the alpha
version of the IN-2000 driver and the partition table on the second
330 meg drive (where linux lives) is trashed. I can't even do an fdisk write
without hanging the system.

I see a couple of problems.

The minor problem that everyone will have to learn how
to use it, rather than just those who don't know how to config things
now.  Perhaps its easier to learn, but perhaps not.

The real problem is that it doesn't do anything more than simply
supply a new syntax for having data on the system -- it has no
facilities for verifying whether the data is valid or reasonable
or any links and cross dependency and consistency checking.  Rather
than the simple name-value pair syntax, you really need a better
way of specifying active components.

You mention programs to generate the real files
that things use from the meta-config files, but I don't see how
they would be much different from a program which provides a general
config editing and validation framework, with plug in modules to
provide the syntax and validation rules for specific files.

The only difference with this is the need for a parser as well as
a generator rather than just having the same input format for all
files.  If you edit /etc/passwd, it parses it, allows editing in
a standard way, then validates and writes it out.  This is much
safer, since other tools that manipulate the files work well.  For
example, passwd/useradd/usermod/userdel can be used to deal with
the password file and can work with anything else that uses
/etc/passwd as the common ground.  Basically, the file that everything
uses *must* be the actual source of the data so that things remain
consistent and managable.


>Here's my current design for the configuration file format:
> [...]

Ignoring the problems noted above,
this seems to be a little limited (and way too MSDOS for my taste :-).

Perhaps adding more typing would be helpful.  The file can be
considered to be a list of entries, each entry having a defined
shape.  Each element of the entry has a type, rather than assuming
they're all strings.  It could also be useful to have a heirachical
form, so the file is a list of entries, and entries themselves can
contain lists.  This would allow /etc/group to be neatly encapsulated,
rather than having some other form of representing lists in strings.
Rather than explicitly typing things, they can be typed by the
form they appear in the file.  For example uid=10, uid=0xa, uid=012
are all numbers, uid="foo" is a string and uid = { 1, 2, 3, "pop"}
is a list.

An example of /etc/group:

# This sets the default shape of the list, rather than having
# to explicitly list all the names for the values.
# Values here are default values, otherwise they are
# manditory entries.  They may be introduced with types
# meaning they must be entered with those types.
default { name, gid, passwd="*", list people }

# The entries follow
{ "root", 0, , {"root", "bin"}}
{ "wheel", 1, people={"root", "jeremy"}}
{ gid=15, people={"fred", "jim", "bob", "jeremy"}, name="users"}

The initial syntax part is useful, since it shows people exactly
how they rest of the file should look.  It may not be used in
the actual parsing, but allowing the parser to have such information
makes it much easer to write simple scripts to deal with the
semantics of the file in question rather than just the syntax.

You perl script includes the parser in the script that generates
the passwd file, or at least knows about passwd files.  This is
what I hope to avoid with a more general syntax for the general
config file format.

Your proposed syntax means that the program that has to understand
the file needs to put more work into understanding the output
of the simple parser, and makes it harder for the user to
understand what's required in that form.  This has always been
my complaint with windows .ini files, because I can never tell
what they key value in the [] means, or how it can be modified.
It doesn't help that it takes on a new meaning depending on the
file its in.  It also seems quite limited, in that it doesn't
seem to have a mechanism for lists within lists (subsections in
its terminology).

Such a thing already exists, but not with loopback devices.  I
wrote "userfs" which allows processes to be mounted as a filesystem.
The process so mounted gets complete control over what other
processes see in the filesystem.  It would be possible to implement
a filesystem to generate config files other sources, or provide a
general configuration management facility to manipulate other config
files and do appropriate actions.

This doesn't need much in the way of new kernel code other than
another filesystem type which is quite small and much more general
than this.  Everything else happens outside the kernel.

It's available on tsx-11 in .../ALPHA/userfs.

        Why is there trouble with running multiple copies of dosemu?  Why

        Also, will there ever (can there?) be a dosemu which supports
