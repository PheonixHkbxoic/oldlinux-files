I am experiencing programs with this driver as well. The source for it

Looks like this driver is just plain broken...I'm going to be hacking

I really wish I could find this problem too. I've fixed a whole load
of other lockup problems with the kernel and things are in general looking
better. The big problem I'm having needless to say is that I can rcp
giant files between the machines I test with and have never a glitch. I've
posted a couple of patches to the net channel to fix yet more tcp bugs,
and I hope to receive a collection of other fixes from elsewhere soon. I 
really want this bug (and the SLIP bug) buried forever before pl14.

Anyone having tcp lockups can they please mail me config details and try
the pl13p + patches stuff if they have time. Hopefully if a few brains
can be pointed in the right direction an answer may emerge.

As to a tcp rewrite. I intend to do this if nobody else offers. But it
will take time and we really need the tcp fixed to go with everything else
that seems to be working so nicely and falling together so well. Mostly thanks
to the work of all the people who are contributing chunks to the code. When the
code is stable - then the time to rewrite tcp will come, as udp, raw and
packet have been overhauled already.

I had a lot of problems with the IN2000 driver working at all until
I called up Always and ordered the upgrade kit. A bit expensive perhaps
but the driver works most of the time. I am using it along side my
Maxtor IDE drive so I can lay to rest those concerns. However, I find
the IN2000 driver is still a bit slow for executables and deadly for
swap files and partitions. I would probably try experimenting more
except for the lack of free time and the fact that I don't have any of
the documentation means I would be groping through the dark.

Are you really serious?

COBOL == Completely Obnoxious Boring Obsolescent Lanquage

There are NO happy COBOL programmers (an obvious oxymoron).

Actually, I really should not be so sure that this won't be done.
After all, there's a GNU ADA project, so why not a GNU COBOL project
(other than requiring lots of anti-nausea medication).

I downloaded tcl7.0b3 and tk3.3b3, followed the instructions, and had 
(as I recall)  **zero** problems.  I have little ***x experience, and almost no
c/make/imake/config experience, so I didn't bother posting anything.  I figured if I
could do it, it probably didn't need a post. I've since added the BLT and xpm (pixmap) 
extensions, with only a few problems.  I've added tkSteal, too, but haven't tested 
it yet, so I don't really know if it works.  BTW, IMHO, tcl/tk is GREAT! Kudos to John O.

Yes, I'm completely serious!  COBOL is not as obsolescent as some may (like)
to think.  It's in use worldwide in thousands of businesses, just like 
FORTRAN is in use in thousands of engineering, space, and scientific
establishments.  COBOL is generally the preferred language for business 
programming.  Not to mention the fact that many of the businesses around
today have most of their software written in COBOL.  And, yes, I do know
MANY happy COBOL programmers. :)

Subject: re_comp/re_exec bug in libc?
Date: 4 Nov 1993 00:09:52 GMT

The following program shows a bug in either re_comp() or re_exec()--I
don't know which:

main() {
  char tab[20], resp[20], *c;

  sprintf(tab, "%c\\[?1;2c", 27);
  sprintf(resp, "%c[?1;2c", 27);
  if((c = re_comp(tab))) {
    puts(c);
    exit(1);
  }
  if(re_exec(resp))
    puts("match");
  else
    puts("no match");
  exit(0);
}

This program should print "match", but it prints "no match".  This
problem with re_comp/re_exec causes usc.edu:/pub/qterm-6.0.tar.gz not
to work properly.

     And people wonder why Linux is not taken seriously...don't you
understand?  If you expect to be taken as a serious alternative to a
commercial OS you can't laugh in your "customers" face when he asks if you
support xyz.  The truth is that a lot of people of real programs written in
COBOL.  For all SCO's weakness, I bet it has native COBOL, Fortran, C, C++,
Pascal, and Ada compilers that work.

These are high-priced, non-GPL boot PROMs.  May I assume that this is a for-pay

The net/inet/CONFIG file has been moved to drivers/net/CONFIG, but look for it
to be deleted in the near future.  Device drivers are now selected with the
top-level 'config' program, and the other parameters set by the CONFIG file
are now (or should be) either probed for or set at run-time.

Subject: Printer problem with pl13p
Date: 4 Nov 1993 06:48:38 GMT

I compiled Linux 0.99pl13p to try it out and noticed one odd thing.
It did not release the print jobs what ever I tried to do, it just
complained that the printer is off-line (and it sure was not). I did not
have time to test it very long so I just booted the official pl13, and
all was ok.

I think pl13p works quite fine in other respects, but I really wonder
why it complained the printer being off-line. I think there is something
in centronics driver of Linux as I sometimes lose jobs when the printer is
off, so that was my main reason to try pl13p.

Kimmo

PS. I wonder why Linux takes only one job to queue (from Silicon Graphics)
if it is sending to printer. I mean that it does not multitask very
well when it is sending stuff to printer. I have noticed that this is 
also a problem with ISC...

        If users have such privilaged access to a machine that they can
boot DOS then there is no way that you can prevent them from accessing
the disks, in some form, leading to securinty breaches.
        What stops them from using bootb to boot LINUX and mount the
root file system as on a subdirectory, then modify the passwd files?
