Date: Wed, 24 Nov 1993 10:36:38 GMT

I'm having a problem with XFree2.0 and Linux during
installation.

I can't get X to start.  I've set my monitor "modes"
correctly.  X just trashes my screen - the system
still responds, but I can't see what I'm doing.  I
have to reboot.  I've been working on this for a
whole week.

I have a Gateway 2000 Local Bus 486 with an ATI
ultra pro with 2MB of VRAM.  First I installed
linux.  Then I updated it with XFree86 2.0

I've read the documentation in depth many times
over, but to no avail.  I'm using Monitor modes
that work for other people.  I'm using the Mach
32 driver and "Clocks" data from the list provided
by Wexelblat in that release.

Any Suggestions?  Here's the only possibility I can
think of:  In Clock entry number seven, there is
a "Ext" in the field for that clock.  That is in
the clock figures for that card (in the Wexelblat
document) a "Ext" exists in the seventh field.
I can find no reference to this other than it means
"External" something or other.

What is this "Ext"?  A keyword for the Xconfig file?
I tried that.  If I put "Ext" in that spot, X
chokes on it - ditto "External" and "-1", etc.
If I fill that spot with "0.00" X will start up
and trash the screen.  WHAT IS THAT SEVENTH
CLOCK ENTRY?

HELP??

Thank YOu.

Hi, Andrew!

I alas cannot help writing such a beast, but I can offer to BETA-test,
if you decide to take up the challenge.  I currently have Linux and Dos
on my 2 IDE drives, and a SCSI (Trantor T130(?) ) card for my cd-rom.

I received clarification on this from someone at OSF.  What you say is what
he said.  When I reposted what he said, he chided me for sharing a private
communication.  If this is true, which I now assume it is, I don't
understand why people from OSF have not publicly posted this clarification.
They have posted others that basically support the confusion.  The problem
is that the different conditions do not seem to be in any logical
relationship.  It is indeed fortunate that they have relieved academic sites
of the record-keeping requirements.

Don't get me wrong.  I also cite Mosaic as perhaps the single most important
distibuted net app.  What I need right now is someone with an academic
license for Motif to compile a version for SunOS 5.3 with term sockets
enabled, if anyone has it figured out yet.

Subject: Problem: SIGHUP and su command
Date: 22 Nov 93 09:44:41 GMT

I've here a serious problem. I discovered it, while I was logged in a
Linux-Mailbox, where I administarte the news system. After I executed 'su -
news' I got a 'NO CARRIER'. I wasn't able to log in again. The mailbox
sysop discovered, that the su process was still running, blocking the ttyS1
device.

I examined the problem on different versions of SLS (1.02, 1.03), different
Kernels (99.8, 99.11, 99.13, 99.13q) and with different shells (tcsh 6.03
and bash 1.12.1). I found the problem in every combination I tested.

I show it here for SLS 1.03, Kernel 99.13.

1) tcsh 6.03
   o Login under my user in virtual console 2 and su - to root.
     Both processes are tcsh.
=====================================================================
# ps -jax -t2
 PPID   PID  PGID   SID TT TPGID  STAT   UID   TIME COMMAND
    1    68    68    68  2    71  S      100   0:00 -tcsh
   68    71    71    68  2    71  S        0   0:00 -su
=====================================================================
   o Now I send a SIGHUP to the process 68 and look for the su process.
=====================================================================
# kill -HUP 68
# ps -jax
    1    71    71    68  ?    -1  S        0   0:00 -su
    [ other processes deleted ]
=====================================================================
  o The process is still alive, but doesn't have a controlling terminal.
    But when I switch to the virtual console 2, I discover that there getty
    and the -su are reading from it.

2) bash 1.12.1
  o The same procedure doesn't produce the problem.
=====================================================================
# ps -jax -t2
 PPID   PID  PGID   SID TT TPGID  STAT   UID   TIME COMMAND
    1    96    96    96  2    98  S      101   0:00 -sh
   96    98    98    96  2    98  S      102   0:00 -su
# kill -HUP 96
# ps -jax
  [ no -su process ]
#
=====================================================================
  o Doing the same with starting a command (ls -F -l | less ) in the -su
    process produces the problem again. 
=====================================================================
# ps -jax -t2
 PPID   PID  PGID   SID TT TPGID  STAT   UID   TIME COMMAND
    1   105   105   105  2   143  S      101   0:00 -sh
  105   142   142   105  2   143  S      102   0:00 -su
  142   143   143   105  2   143  S      102   0:00 ls -F -l /usr/bin
  142   144   143   105  2   143  S      102   0:00 less
# kill -HUP 105
# ps -jax 
 PPID   PID  PGID   SID TT TPGID  STAT   UID   TIME COMMAND
    1   142   142   105  ?    -1  S      102   0:00 -su
 [ other processes deleted ]
#
=====================================================================

It seems to me, that one reason is, that a TIOCSPGRP is possible without
signalling the current foreground processes like -su, that they are now in
background and cannot read anymore from the terminal. IMHO the read call
has to be interrupted with a SIGTTOU signal. But the code in tty_io.c and
tty_ioctl.c isn't so clear to me, that I can easily fix the things up. Some
fast hacks I tried didn't solve the problem.

I tried the same under SunOS 4.1.2 with tcsh 6.03 and couldn't discover the
problem there. So I think it isn't a problem of the shells, like someone
suggested in response of my last posting. He proposed that the shells
should call vhangup(). It would work, but I thought, that Linux should
support all free UN*X software with no major changes.

I hope, that somebody will find a solution!

Ciao, Uli

There's a neat command that doesn't seem to be as well-known
as it should be: jot. It's really just a wrapper around a `for'
loop with printf support added. For example
% jot 5
1
2
3
4
5
% jot -s '' -c 10 65 
ABCDEFGHIJ
% jot -w 'foo%d.bar' - 30 50 3 
foo30.bar
foo33.bar
foo36.bar
foo39.bar
foo42.bar
foo45.bar
foo48.bar

If I didn't use Perl for most scripts, I'd really miss jot.

 I'm not an expert at all, just trying to be helpful to locate the problem you
 have with two machines of different sex talking to eachother.

 This morning I posted the problem about the definition of gethostbyaddr() being
 probably (IMHONEO - non expert opninion) wrong. Check out my post... Could this
 be the cause of a linux box and a SUN box not talking to eachother ?

I'm also wondering about the advantages TCL/TK can have over a well
designed UI class framework in any object oriented environment (except
saving the effort of learning an OO language).

Having a look at Tcl scripts they seem not to be much smaller or
easier to write than aequivalent Smalltalk samples. I personally prefer
C++ but this is not the place for another ST/C++ flame war ;-)

Again, why should one use TCL/TK instead of an OO framework?
Can anyone enlight me?

: HELP??

I'm using the same card. There are some points to mention if
you got an ATI ultra pro: 
- The clocks line is different for the different makes of cards.
  The card (i.e. the driver) didn't complain, but you didn't get the
  expected resolution. Check which line works for you.
  (Check carefully. You get funny results if you don't)

- You couldn't set the Virtual Resolution to whatever you want; instead
  it has to be multiples of ( sorry. didn't remember. ). But for my card
  (Same as yours; one of the famous not-for-sale OEM cards ) did
  'Virtual      1400 1200'
  work well. (This isn't the whole 2MB, but the next multiple would be 
  far beyond 2MB.)

- With my card, I could use a clocks line without 'Ext' entries in it.
  If you didn't, replace them with '0.00'. Should (?) work.
  Or get another clocks line.

- And of course, the well-known 80 MHz barrier: The card DID support clocks
  up to 135 MHz, but the XFree86 Server DIDN'T. Complains are useless.
  ( I heard about a patch to change this. Check comp.os.windows.i386 for 
  it. I think it wouldn't last long. There seemed to be LOTS of ATI ultra 
  pro sold. )

My card worked ( after the few minor adjustments ) quite well.
Hope this helps

P.S.: Be careful with your card. 2 of our 3 card got blasted after 2 months.

I read someone mentioning earlier, that Richard Stallman (head of GNU
and major writer of GCC) said something like (sorry, I remember this -
I do not have a copy of that message):

        "A pentium is only a fast 386.  GCC already supports it."

Yes, we would like an -m586 optimizing option.  But we also like a
processor, which we can afford.  Right now, Intel tries many legel
issues against their competitors.  Their goal is to be the only
producer of fast 386 compatible chips.

The 486 is still overpriced.  When you take a look at the prices
of AMD, they aren't much cheaper.  Probably AMD agreed to not
start a price war and Intel agreed to stop the legal war.

If Intel started licensing the Pentium tomorrow, it is very likely,
that GNU started to work on a -m586 option.

The problem is the cost of the terminal servers. An 16 port MicroAnnex

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't this lead to the following
reasoning:

If I write some freeware Motif software and want to distribute 
the statically linked version freely, I just send the sources
to somebody with an academic site license who makes the binaries
and puts them onto some ftp-server. Or is there a clause in the
license that only locally developed software is covered ?

Anyway, if this is valid, I don't actually need my friend with the
license, for the binaries I generate, and those he can generate are
probably identical, so nobody can tell who made them.

Thus one is inclined to reason that from all free motif apps, which 
come with source, a freely redistributeable static binary can be made.
IMHO the technicallity of actually compiling it at (for example)
NCSA is irrelevant. 

This leads me to the following suggestion to OSF:

Make the distribution of statically linked binaries royality-free,  
as long as the sources of the application is also distributed with
the binary.

This policy should not affect commercial software, for I hardly
get the sources for them. But it would allow the continuing developement
of free software based on Motif.

Comments ?
