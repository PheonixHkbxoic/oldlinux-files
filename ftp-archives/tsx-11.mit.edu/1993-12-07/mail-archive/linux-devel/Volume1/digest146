Obcourse this misses the point that you are free to patch your own driver
into Xfree86.  If you want to write your own BIOS driver for Linux, great.
Test it out, if it improves performance, increases speed, or has some
other advantage upload it to an ftp and all the Linux community will
appreciate it.

Hi!

  I'm a bit of a newbie to the Linux world and I wonder if some
  kind soul could help me with this problem:

  I'm currently writing a program that needs the page fault
  handler (SIGSYSV) to obtain some speed. But the program needs
  some extra data like where it was trying to write or read and
  if it is possible, set the single step trap.
  Could someone help me to find out how I can do this?
  (Don't blame it on bad code! I'm counting every clockcycle :)

This scheme doesn't have to have anything to do with the X Free 86 code.
All it needs to do is write a locally correct XConfig file.

Whether I'd trust the information or not is a different matter. How
would it get the monitor bandwidth for example.

        Is this a dead end ?

I just got my new PC! After specifically asking for an Adaptec 1742
controller (to run linux), they sent me a 2742(T) instead (thank you).
The SCSI-HOWTO says this is not supported, so I guess I'm in the position
of writing this myself. Could someone give me a few pointers on how to
proceed? I've done some work on the SCSI driver for my Amiga so I have a
vague idea how these things work. Not being able to run linux from a 
hard disk would seem to be the chief impedement.

Maybe even someone will tell me 'Hey, I'm almost finished doing this very
thing!' :-)

I have an idea i've been thinking about, but, not wanting to be shot down
by some hot fingered netter, have kept silent.  but it's related to this 
thread, ... so

Since the makers of video cards generally always write a windows 
driver, would it be possible to write a program to extract the 
neccessary code from a windows driver to make it work with Xfree?
This wouldn't have to be incorporated into the Xfree program 
itself, but could be used to make just the driver portion, which
could be linked in.  Could this work?

This is what OS/2 actually seems to do.  Is has you run a command called
"svga on" in a dos window, where it traps the writes to ports and keeps
track of what it did to go in and out of all of the vesa modes.  It then
uses this information to set its svga modes itself.

Of course I may be totally wrong (I just figured this out by playing
with it), but it seems to be what it is doing.

This would allow someone to write a driver that would read similar files
and output the same commands to the same ports to change video modes. 
Might even be a way to pick up ideas on new cards.

        I have been thinking about just this thing. I would use OB/OI
as it seems fairly easy to use and it would be good to show some
support for the product. 

        Each of the sections could be written and then merged into a
main utility. If it's designed carfully, if should be extendable as
well. As for the compile time stuff. Once the gui is set, it could be
compiled into a *.o files and then linked with the code for
maintaining the files.

        I think it would be good to have it very flexable. For
example, with UUCP automatically figuring out which type of config
files you are using and offering a conversion option to one of the
others. That way the user is offered a list of systems, they pick a
system (or add a new one) and get options to either clear/delete it,
or edit it's 'capabilities'.

Subject: signals ?

I am porting a big piece of software (isode-8.0) to Linux and am stuck
on configuring the signal-related portions.

ISODE refers to SIGEMT, which isn't declared in any Linux include files.
[Stevens, Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment] states that SIGEMT
is an implementation-defined hardware fault, which is present in SVR4 and
BSD4.3, but not POSIX.1. Is it true that Linux implements BSD signals,
and if so, why isn't SIGEMT provided?

A related query concerns the file signal.h which says;

    [ #define's of various SIGxxx's deleted ]

    /* Most of these aren't used yet (and perhaps never will)
     * so they are commented out.
     */

    #define SIGIO     23
    #define SIGPOLL   SIGIO
    #define SIGURG    SIGIO

    /*
    #define SIGLOST
    */

Is it just SIGLOST which is not used (and does `used' mean `implemented')
or are SIGIO, SIGPOLL and SIGURG also not `used'?
What is the meaning of these three signal types anyway?
Why are they defined as the same value? - this implies that Linux doesn't
distinguish between them.

If anyone can shed some light on these mysteries I will be most grateful.

Yeah, that's what some other programs do too, like ColorView by
Millenium Technologies (shareware viewer for DOS.)  It 
configures itself completely automatically every time I
run it (it doesn't use a config file though), and finds 
all my resolution x color combinations all the way 
up to 1280 x 1024 x 8bit.

Now I don't know how to do automatical configuration 
ike that, but I hope there are people out there who do  :-)

Subject: Elite16 software setup details?
Date: Thu, 7 Oct 1993 07:27:23 GMT

I'm running Linux 0.99.p13 with an SMC EtherCard Elite16.  The WD8003
driver comes up correctly, but my board mysteriously reconfigures
itself to use the BNC port instead of the AUI one.  Oddly enough, I've
been running the kernel non-stop for at least 24 hours without any
problems -- the config change only happened after I warm-booted the
machine for the first time since I installed p13.  I'm able to configure
the port (and make it stick) under MS-DOS, but when I boot Linux, the
setting reverts to the default (BNC).

Does anyone have the details of software config for the Elite 16?
Better still, has anyone written a config program under Linux?  Please
reply ASAP, as my machine is also the newsserver for my company.

Thks much for any info!

Subject: Simplified loadkeys - ALPHA release
Date: 07 Oct 1993 10:59:07 GMT
Reply-To: B.A.McCauley@bham.ac.uk

Many people (including myself) have noticed that many of the control
and alt keys on the UK and US maps do not "Do the Right Thing(tm)"
fixing the *.map files would be laborious (I tried it), so, as
promised here are some patches for loadkeys so that your map files can
look simpler and still DTRT (like this):

   auto keycode   7 = six              asciicircum     
           control = Control_asciicircum

Instead of this:

   keycode   7 = six              asciicircum     
           control keycode   7 = Control_asciicircum
           shift control keycode 7 = Control_asciicircum
           alt     keycode   7 = Meta_six        
           shift alt keycode 7 = Meta_asciicircum
           control alt keycode 7 = Meta_Control_asciicircum
           control shift alt keycode 7 = Meta_Control_asciicircum

[Meta_Control_asciicircum is not actually reconised by loadkeys at
present]

The new loadkeys hopefully retains full compatibility with old map
files.

I'm still working on the keytables.5 and *.map files but here are the
patches for the programs in case anyone want to alpha test them. When
I'm done I'll send the whole lot to Linus in the hope that it will
become the ``official'' version.

Very likely.  I don't think there is any general way to do what is being
discussed.  Where the BIOS stores the actual video parameters is completely
up to the BIOS, and there is no standard, as far as I know.  Hence I don't
think it can be automated.

It is possible to determine this by disassembling the BIOS and finding
where the tables are located, but I consider this an ethically questionable
practice, so I have never done this.  What I have done is write some
DOS-based programs to extract register values for a given mode.  This
has served to allow me to develop a relatively successful set of generic
modes, which will be included with XFree86 2.0, along with a new document
on how to get up and running.

Basically, we have modes that should provide a working, if not optimal
(in size and positioning), set of 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, etc
modes for any monitor.  I think.  Some very old, or esoteric fixed-frequency
monitors may not work with these modes, but there has been no case
where someone on the XFree86 beta team wasn't able to get at least
one working mode at each resolution from the set.

The idea is to get people up and running, and then let them tweak
size, position, refresh rates, etc, based on the detailed documentation.
