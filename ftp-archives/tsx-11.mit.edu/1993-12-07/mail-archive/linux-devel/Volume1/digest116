I don't know if it's just a local problem, or what, but it seems
my text didn't appear in the message... I'll try again.


Hello,

I was wondering if anyone has been working on developing the HPFS filesystem
for use under Linux.  I'm an OS/2 & Linux advocate, and I'd like to be
able to mount HPFS partitions at one point in time.

If anyone has been working on this, I'd really like to know, because I'm
considering working on it myself.  

And if anyone can point me to information on the HPFS, I'd appreciate it.
(I've already found the HPFS.doc in pub/linux/info on tsx-11.mit.edu)

Thanks muchly!

- Mark

Intelligent boards are normally proprietrary designs with drivers
provided by the vendors.  If the vendors don't see a potential market
to pay for the effort to write, distribute and maintain linux drivers
there won't be any.  Unless, of course, linux is modified to be able
to use sysvr4 driver files or someone writes a binary translator from
coff/elf to whatever linux wants.

A possible alternative would be to use an ethernet terminal server.  The
cost of these tends to be a bit higher than ISA multi-port cards, but
the ability to connect to different machines might be worth the
difference, especially if you don't have the driver you need for a
directly attached board.  Is anyone using one of these or a Netblazer
with linux?

(I have to get some more programming experience too,
>but that's beside the point :)  ).  Thanks in advance,

How about writing software to make a DOS PC operate like a two-serial,
two-parallel port terminal server?

If the contents of /config are merely symlinks to the actual configuration
files, then I really don't have much of a problem with it.  Those of us who
don't need /config can then simply remove it and be done with it.

If there's any single standard that needs to exist with respect to config
files, it's the use of a comment character.  Most things can use '#' at
the beginning of a line to indicate a comment.  I suggest that everything
be modified to deal with that.

Then you include sufficient documentation in comments to enable novice
admins to get a handle on what they're doing when they look at the file.
This, of course, is for system configuration files that don't have a
specific application that uses them.

Application configuration files should be managed by the applications
themselves when at all possible.  What knows better what it's looking
for than the application?

If applications are made responsible for managing their own configuration
files, then the responsibility for knowing about configuration files will
be distributed appropriately.  Any other "solution" simply adds unneeded
complexity to what's already there.

People who come from the MS-LOSS world don't seem to realize that the
reason Unix is more complex to administrate is that Unix is a more
complex system!  Furthermore, how can you effectively manage a system
if you don't know how the pieces are supposed to work?  Configuration
files give you a clue about how things work.  Knowing about them is an
advantage.

I do admit that there are some configuration files for which a front-end
editor would be really useful.  Sendmail.cf comes to mind.  :-)

Yup.  Grab the latest e2fsck; you can find it on ftp.dcs.ed.ac.uk in
pub/sct.  I don't know whether it has appeared anywhere else publicly.
Previous versions of e2fsck did not always correctly check the free
block/inode counts for the last block group in a filesystem.

Or the line is actually something like

and gcc tripped over the unmatched single quote, which ANSI compilers are
apparently allowed (supposed?) to do.

It not really very difficult, but you might be more confident starting with
the new 0.99pl13 kernel.  It already has entries in net/inet/Space.c for
"eth0", "eth1", "eth2", and "eth3".  You can either edit the "eth0" and "eth1"
entries directly and then build a new kernel, or build an unmodified pl13
kernel and set the ethercard addresses using LILO.  The boot-time parameters
would look like:

lilo-prompt:  linux  ether=11,0x280,eth0  ether=10,0x300,eth1

Where the first ethercard is at 0x280, IRQ11 and the second at 0x300, IRQ10.
An alternate line is:

lilo-prompt:  linux  ether=eth0  ether=0,0,eth1

Which tells the kernel to autoIRQ and autoprobe for the second ethercard.

I believe you can also make this automatic by putting the correct lines in
/etc/lilo/config, and running 'lilo'.  Check the manual for LILO 0.12 or later.

Wait a minute here, you completely misread the message and needlessly flamed
me. Ouch, ouch, ouch, put that out.  In no way am I advocating obfuscicating
any code.  I think Linux device drivers should be as clear as possible while
remaining concise.  I'm talking about _loadable_ device drivers, where an
object code module is distributed seperately from the kernel, and can be
loaded into the kernel at the user-level after the kernel has booted.  If
Linux 1.00 has that as a standard feature we will likely see a considerable
number of proprietary device drivers.

>I liked Minix, where I could add a driver stub in an hour or
>two because the code was easy to read, and laid out well.

I did write a network device driver stub, and a number of people have used it
to start writing ethercard drivers.  I'm not trying to establish any "job
security" or power trip here: it's in my best interest to have other people
write the device drivers.  I just want to benefit from the availability of the
source code.

Please, save your flames for those people that post "I know the FAQ said not to,
but I bought a Diamond card anyway.  Where is the patch."  They will someday
be posting "My object-only loadable device driver doesn't work, help me!"

    I'm half and half on it... for myself, having a separate /conf to hold
system-specific files on the root partition makes managing multiple machines
much easier... the entire root partition is the same on each machine except for
/conf (or /config or whatever you want to call it).

    But as far as distributions go, I think the files ought to be in standard
places.  Probably over half of the Linux community are single-machine owners  
with no need for a /conf, and as the above person mentioned, most people with
unix experience tend to like to start out with files in standard places and 
customize as they go.

I use linux on a monochrome Packard Bell daily for 2 years now.  Installed with no problems.
X runs fine (in mono).  An external monitor works fine also if I switch to it during the bios
bootup, i.e. before you see the "LILO loading ..." message using a key on the PB for that.
My problem is I want a bigger hard disk. 80 megs ain't enough.  Anyone know where I can

   I run the mono server of XFree version 1.2 on my Compaq LTE386s/20

I am running (now) XFree 1.3 in (grayscale) color on Compaq LTE line
