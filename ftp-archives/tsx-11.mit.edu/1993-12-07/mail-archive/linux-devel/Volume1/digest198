Xircom is known for not releasing programming information.

Even if they change their policy you are unlikely to see a driver from me.

I heard rumors that you must know the author personally, and perhaps even
bestow gifts upon him, before he'll tell you how to become an alpha tester.
Even then he expect you to send in good bug reports and fixes.

I've also heard that he worked from an old 82586 databook, and later read the
Crynwr driver rather than trying any longer to find the right people at Intel.

I've checked the SLS package, and I haven't found the alpha EtherExpress
driver there.  Bummer, eh?  I guess we'll have to look elsewhere for it...

Neat.  Except all the modern SCSI disks have at least 32K of on board
cache, so the next request should come from the DRIVES cache.  The 1G's
I'm getting now come with 256K of cache on board.  Rotational latency
problems should be minimal / not a factor on a drive like this as it
will ALWAYS be buffering a whole track.

IDE will generally _always_ beat scsi in a raw thruput test, at the
expense of about 4 times the CPU overhead.

Hey, if someone at MIT calls an implementation poor, it's got to suck.

Eric, are you *really* sure, that SVR4 fsflush does *not* write all dirty
buffers back to disk, even if you

    1) wait long enough (eventually much more than 30 sec. when
       enough mem/buffers are free) and
    2) you don't produce new dirty pages in the meantime ?

There are two reasons, why I hate sync every 30 seconds:

    1) It produces a load peak every 30 seconds (has already been
       discussed in this thread).
    2) It writes temporary files (e.g. during compilation)
       to disk, even if the whole file fits into the buffer cache
       and the file will be removed 1 minute later. Bdflush with an
       LRU strategy would write other (old) blocks to disk instead
       and the temp file would no longer exist, when its buffers were
       old enough (This example assumes, that you have a machine with
       lots of memory).

Subject: which (proc-) ps output shows the real memory usage?
Date: 29 Oct 93 15:20:53 GMT

I'm using 0.99pl13n at the moment with a recent procps (0.8 ?).

I ever wondered why  'ps ux'   and  'ps mx' show different memory
statistics. Here an example:

# ps ux 
USER       PID %CPU %MEM SIZE  RSS TTY STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root         1  0.0  1.3   44  200  ?  S    23:58   0:00 init auto
root       259  0.0  2.4  232  360  ?  S    00:08   0:26 xntpd
root      2073  5.0 1755.2 1735 261676  ?  S    08:56   0:57 X :0

# ps mx 
  PID TTY MAJFLT MINFLT  TRS  DRS SIZE SWAP  RSS SHRD  LIB  DT COMMAND
    1  ?      66     37    8   88  372    0  372  276  320  11 init auto
  259  ?      52     40  116  148  544    0  544  292  324  11 xntpd
 2073  ?     275   2982  520 1720 2852    0 2852  380 1444 208 X :0


Note the different numbers for SIZE and RSS.

What happens with RSS for my X server (this is XFree86-2.0 S3 server
which maps the 1MB video frame buffer at address 0x7c00000 via mmap(2))?
When I disable the frame buffer mapping, 'ps ux' shows a reasonable 
RSS number.

Any explanation and/or fix?

Thanks,
Harald

Yes, this is EASY.  Mount your DOS partition in Linux.  Make it your
HOME directory. :-)  Edit any number of files with emacs.  Reboot to DOS
and your files are still in your DOS directory.  I do this ALL THE TIME!
This is a silly thread.  There is no 'unix filesystem', there are several
filesystems: minux, ext, ext2, xiaf.  By thinking ahead only slightly, you
and arrange to have all the files you share between Linux and DOS always
live on the DOS partition.  (Use ln -s if you want!)  I think you can
even mount DOS so that cr -- cr/lf converstion is automatic.

With difficulty. If someone was sick enough they could write a dos
file redirector that used the BIOS to do disk i/o and itself implemented
the relevant linux fs you were using (minix/ext2 or whatever). From a 
programming point of view you would have to be really deranged to do this.

It's hard to believe so many people responding to this thread can be
this thick, and even after it being re-explained.

What he's asking is how to access the Linux filesystem FROM DOS!

I don't know of a way, you'd have to write a Linux filesystem driver
that runs under DOS, and I don't know that one exists.

That is not what Christian is asking.  He wants to be able to grab a
Linux file when the machine is running in DOS/Windows mode.  Right
now, the only way to do this is to reboot in Linux mode, log in, do
the copy, and the reboot in DOS mode.

Yes.  I created a text file in emacs on the Linux disk, and now, when
I'm running Quark under Windows, I want to import it.  How do I get it?

I really don't want to start a flamewar here, because it seems to be such
a senseless waste of human life, but....

I've been using and programming on different platforms and in different
languages for a long time.  It's not like I just started using and programming
computers yesterday.  I've always realized how important it was to know that
the computer was supposed to be my tool, and not the other way around.
If it's useful, and saves time under a general situation or otherwise, why not
implement it?  


The reaction to this situation reminds me of the old MS joke:

Q: How many MS employees does it take to screw in a light bulb?
A: None.  MS redefines darkness to be the industry standard.

Now I don't want to throw any names out or anything, but who in this community
has taken that attitude with regards to this problem, and who has not? :)

I would've thought it would be morally repugnant for most Linux developers
to realize they had the same ways of approaching problems as MS employees.

Hear that MS?  You've got a bunch of recruits ripe for the picking... :)

A simpler idea (if someone wants to write it) is to make a DOS 
equivalent of mtools, but in reverse.  That is, a set of DOS programs 
like "lls" (linux ls), "lcp" (linux copy), etc. that can access a linux 
partition an read the files there.

In fact, I stumbled across a partial implementation of something like 
this.  There's a set of programs to read a minix-floppy from DOS on the 
simtel mirrors, in the dskutl dir.  As I recall, I got a copy from 
oak.oakland.edu:/pub/msdos/dskutl/mindos11.zip.  I didn't look too close 
at it though, because I don't use minix-fs anymore.
