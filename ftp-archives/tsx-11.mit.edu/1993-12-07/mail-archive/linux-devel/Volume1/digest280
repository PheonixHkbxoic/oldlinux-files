Date: Wed, 1 Dec 1993 05:31:24 GMT

I have a laptop (Gateway Handbook 486DX2-40) whose external floppy
drive is still on order.  While I'm waiting, I'd like to try installing
Linux on it.  Although I've been able to create a Linux partition and
install a boot redirector MBR that can reach either partition, I
haven't been able to put the Linux bootdisk, which normally boots from
the floppy, in a place where the boot redirector can reach it.  I'd
like to copy bootdisk to the beginning of the Linux partition.  Does
anyone have a .exe that copies a file to a partition?  I.e. the
functionality of Unix's

        dd if=myfile of=/dev/hda2

There is a Linux-related DOS utility, rawrite.exe, which comes close,
but can only write to floppies, I need to write to the hard drive.

I'm not sure which is the bigger puzzle, how to do this or why why
neither DOS nor Norton utilities offers such a basic and easily
implemented capability.

Well the 3c501 code has suppoert for promiscuous mode, and if a card built
in 1984 supports it I should imagine everything would. (Don't get this card,
though - it is slow and jams on occasion. Like often.) Other cards which are
supported in promicuous mode appear to be:
Allied Telesis AT1700 (at1700.c)
Intel EtherExpress (eexpress.c) (not yet I think)
AMD LANCE (lance.c)
Whether the other cards don't have it, or the drivers just don't use it I
don't know. Can't see why a card wouldn't have it, sounds like a useful
feature to me.
Note I think these features are new to the 0.99.14 kernel, and I have
no idea at all how one accesses the incoming promiscuous packets.

Date: Wed, 1 Dec 1993 06:28:25 GMT

Does any body know what effect deselecting a printer (by pressing the
button on the printer) should have on the fault line? The code in the
linux* kernel assumes that if the printer is off line then it will be
active, but my printer seems to leave it alone, unless it is out of paper.
This is my gut feeling as well. This means I don't get any messages when
the printer is off line. Any body got some hard documentation?
(My printer is an OKI Microline 380 - the manual says about the fault
line: 'When the paper end is detected, this signal changes from high to
low level.' This seems to be exactly what happens.)
( For kernel hackers: the culprit is line 143 of lp.c - to make it work
for me I just add a check for LP_PSELECD as well.)

Thanks very much,
        David Monro

But they do :)
With norton utilities, you can do it an easy way: open your file in
DiskEditor (or in nu, if you have version 4.5, which I personally 
prefer to later ones), and choose Tools/Write/Physical sector. If
you'll choose starting physical sector right, you'll be Ok. If you
don't know how to choose starting physical sector, probably you do
not want to do it anyway ;)
With plain vanilla DOS, you can do it a hard way: re-read your
debug manual (hint: pay special attention to r and w commands ;), and
you'll see how to do it...

Does this mean that the 3c501 is supported by Linux?
When I looked in the supported hardware I saw that only
its 16bit brother (3c503 or similar) was in the kernel
device drivers.

For a project course, we have to program a robot moving through an unknown area.
We want to program two independent processess, one for drawing a world model
(map) and one to navigate through this map toward the goal. Nobody of us has had
much experience with Linux or shared memory before.

We think that it would be best to put the map into some memory shared by both
processess. Does anyone have any suggestions/documents or some sample code using
shared memory with Linux?

Linux has shared memory support.  Answer "yes" to the question, whether you
want IPC support, when configuring your kernel.  As far as I know, both
DOSEMU and POSTGRES use it.  (Well, I know it for sure for the latter).
Get either source, and have a look at it.

This should be in the "Welcome to the comp.os.linux hierarchy"
posting that Matt posts regularly (to many, or is it all Linux
groups).

1. You talk to your system or news admin.  I don't think the volume
   can be too big for that to be the reason.
2. If #1 fails, you might try joining the ANNOUNCE channel on the
   linux-activists@niksula.hut.fi mailing list.  Short canned
   instructions follow.  Please don't join if you can read it
   via news, because niksula is overloaded as it is.

You can join the mailing list mirror of comp.os.linux.announce (if you 
don't have USENET access) by sending mail to

        linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi

with the line

        X-Mn-Admin: join ANNOUNCE

at the top of the body (not the subject).  Sending an empty mail to

        linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi

will get you help on using the mailing list (including instructions
on how to leave).

Subject: 0.99pl14: scsi slow?
Date: 1 Dec 1993 12:27:14 GMT

Hi there

Yesterday, I upgraded to the new kernel version 0.99pl14. (I have installed
Slackware 1.1.0). As I have read in the announcement, there has been some
work on the scsi-drivers. So, I tested the performance of the new version
using bonnie (posted on the net some days ago). This is what I got:

with Adaptec-Driver, pl13:

The new version seems remarkably slower, at least in sequential block IO.
Is this due to some 'improvements' of the new driver, or what's going on?
Anyway, the performace isn't very well at all (the drive is a 512Mb SCSI-2 
Fujitsu, Buslogic BT-445s controller), allthough you don't really recognize it
when working due to the good cache of linux (I have 16Mb RAM)

lpcntl should be on tsx-11 and/or sunsite.  I have a copy here.  (---Except
that in pl13 the driver stopped working for me in IRQ mode.  !@#$%^* PC

Good grief!  This brings back memories of undeleting files on a HD using DEBUG
and DOS 1.1! (Or was 2.0 the upgrade for HDs?)  does anybody else remember
