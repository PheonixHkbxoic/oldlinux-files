Not everyone is able to get another phone line.  Some of us live 
in university housing that doesnt allow for such things.

Umm. Actually, the idea behind it was that I could use it. ;)

So they're removing 386BSD from agate.  Big deal.  You can get 386BSD from

I don't know what interface the BICC and WD MCA cards use so I can't comment
on them. There is also the 3c529 from 3Com.  It would work with the 3c509
driver if I wrote the MCA-specific probe code for it.

If someone cares about this they should probably write to Linus and ask him to
put "CONFIG_MCA" into the 'config.in' file, and set a global variable like
"int MCA_bus;" in init/main.c.  If those existed I might put in the MCA
ethercard probes when I update drivers.  (Of course the new code would be
completely untested, since I try to avoid buying gratuitously incompatible
hardware like MCA.)

POSIX 1003.1 (B.3.2 Process Termination) says that previous
drafts had tried to distinguish between things like
`normal termination', `simple abnormal termination'
and `abnormal termination with actions' but gave up
and dropped the distinction from the standard. It goes
on to say

      The implementation-defined actions usually include,
   in most historical implementations, the creation of a file
   named core in the current working directory of the process.

After mentioning the problems of dumping cores from suid/sgid
processes, it goes on to say:

   Despite the silence of the standard on this feature,
   applications are advised not to create files named core
   because of potential conflicts in many implementations.
   Some historical implementations use a different name than
   core for the file, such as appending the process ID to the
   filename.

So it looks like POSIX doesn't affect the choice of what to do.

Now, that is not very polite, period. 

If someone wants to get this package, he can take any 
site that holds the comp.sources.unix archives and look 
for volume 26 for db-1.6. Thanks to Mitch Dsouza
for this info. An example of such a site would be :

Subject: Why does abort() trash my stack frame
Date: Fri, 5 Nov 1993 12:01:06 GMT

Calling the abort function inevitably leaves a stack frame which
gdb can't decipher. Does anybody know about this behaviour ? - or better
still have a fix for it. It's very annoying, as a program gets to an
assertion which is supposed to stop everything so you can do a post
mortem, but instead you get a useless stack frame.

sigh,
