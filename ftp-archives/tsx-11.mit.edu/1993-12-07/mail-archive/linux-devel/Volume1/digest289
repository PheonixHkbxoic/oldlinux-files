Attention UNIX/PC System Administrators!

I would like to have some general/specific opinions from people
who read this newsgroup and would have any advice or comment (from 
experience) on any of the following:

              LINUX
              386BSD
              FreeBSD                 <---- these are not listed
              NetBSD                        in any prferential order.
              Minix
              or any other

I am soon to start a project wherein I need to install one of
the above onto a 486DX2 VLB with a 430Mb IDE HD,
16Mb RAM, an SMC ethernet card, and a VGA monitor. (I'll change
any specific item(s) if necessary, but this looks like the most
likely setup.)

I need to know which is the best route to go and *your* opinion
as to why.  I am also curious as to ease of installation, compatibility
with third party software packages, etc. - anything one can think
of that's important.  I am not looking for FAQs; I have downloaded
most already.

The primary, initial, function will be to set up eMail accounts,
running sendmail and some POP mail daemon. (POP is used extensively
here.)

Please send your responses to me: ryan@magnet.fsu.edu.  If you post it to
the board for some reason, please cc a copy directly to me so that I
don't miss it.

Thanks in advance.
Joe Ryan

Yes, there are people working on it.  There is a floppy patch out there which
seems to work with 1.72 MB floppies, though I can't personally vouch for it.
There is a longer-term effort by myself and Sam Chessman to completely rewrite
the floppy and floppy controller code with the intent of better performance,
supporting ED (2.88MB) floppies and floppy tapes, and to make it all much
more maintainable.  I have the fdformat code too, but it is very DOS-oriented
and is useful mostly as a reference.  I expect we will try to stay compatible
with the DOS fdformat.

If you want to actually work on the effort, let me know.

That would not address quite a few issues. There is no way to find out
when to quit. Each volume cannot be independently recovered without
having to go through earlier volumes etc.

The only workable solution is to create separate archives for each
volume. This will not address the <= 256 bytes slack space
requirements to be sure (incidentally, I have a couple of shell
scripts which minimize the slack to the extent possible by
re-arranging the components of an archive--- works only with files
smaller than the volume size.) Another problem which is not addressed
by this method would be files larger than volume size...  but as has
been suggested elsewhere in the thread, that can be done too, albeit
somewhat artificially. Elizabeth's restriction about recovery from
different scripts will not be met, but not a serious problem, IMHO.

First of many thanks to mosaic developers for sharing with us a
very, very useful and nice application.

Perhaps, someone could write a nice summary of this discussion to 
a popular Unix Magazine. I think is time that we elevate this to 
a more public forum - that is if you care for your beloved Unix/X/Motif.

Personally, I find the motif license structure crippling to the FreeBSD,
NetBSD or Linux efforts.

Yes, I have a home network built around 2 of them, both running 0.99.14. I
use a 486DX33 as the main machine, and a 386sx40 as a secondary. The 386
has only 20Mb of harddisk under linux - 5Mb root 5Mb swap, 10 Mb for local
binaries (mostly network daemons and X servers). It mounts /usr from the
486. The 386 is used as a remote X display, it has my printer attatched to
it and also has a mpu401 midi card installed in it. I get around 40k/s
transfer rate with nfs, about 70k/s with ftp, and it works pretty
reliably. Yesterday I spent about 10 hours working on the 386, including
remote compiles, nroffs, gs etc, and got less than 30 kernel messages -
one was an unwxpected interrupt and the others were all bogus (short)
packets. Since I paid AUS$2.00 each for the cards, I am very happy with
them. So thanks very much for writing the driver!

Hi you out there,

I'm just reading more and more about ftape and the problems people have with
it. I also know that the author burnt his hard disk some time ago (?). But
does anyone know when there will be further developed stuff? I would really
like to be able to restore my backups :-) (well, sometimes it works, but
often the tape has bad blocks and ftape writes just "through" them ;-( )

Why do people have so much trouble figuring out attributions?  Mario did *not*
wrongly attribute to you something that someone else wrote.  Take a look at
the above.  Notice that there is one attribution mark before each line of your
article that I'm responding to, two attribution marks before Mario's, three
before Glenn Pinkerton's.  Your article that Glenn Pinkerton responded to
would have 4 attribution marks before it, but no lines with that many marks
in front of them are to be found.  Thus, what you wrote did not appear at
all.  The text you think is being attributed to you was (correctly) attributed
to Glenn Pinkerton.

Perhaps you (and others who claim misattribution of their articles) should
understand how the news followup algorithm works before claiming that someone
wrongly attributed someone's text to you.

Sorry for putting you on the spot, but this is the second time in the past
few hours that I've seen someone make this mistake.

        LGX has the Inherited File System built in, but IFS had bugs

If they are determined for 100% emulation, then is there anyone doing serious

End of line spaces are insignificant in *any* language you care to
name (okay, well maybe RPG* is an exception and there are probably
others); it's useful to ignore these for any reason.

They also have the distinct advantage of having to translate a
syntactically simple language (relative to C with its gazillion
operators).  That, and the huge base of existing scientific Fortran
code, explains why Fortran compilers were the first kids on the block
to have built-in parallelization.

I've upgraded to 0.99pl14 a few days ago. Just now, I ran dosemu49pl3
and there seems to be a bug somewhere that causes the keyboard to become
inresponsive when I switch back to the VC running dosemu (the screen was
blanked, and Linux seems inresponsive to what I type. This problem has
happened more than once in the past). I had no choice but to press the
reset switch on my PC. After this, I get the following warning everytime
during boot up:

EXT2-fs warning: maximal mount count reached, running e2fsck is recommended

I ran e2fsck but no error was reported. This warning doesn't occur
when I boot with an older 0.99pl13 kernel. Anyone please explain how to
fix this?

        Thanks.

Savio Lam.
