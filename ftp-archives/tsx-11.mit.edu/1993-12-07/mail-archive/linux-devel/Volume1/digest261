Right.  And for every one of your "real world experiences", we can

Use SuperProbe.

This is why the VESA/generic modes are provided.  The server will tell
you the clocks for all except the programmable boards (where you tell
it, so that doesn't matter).

Please.  Do you know of "voodoo economics"?  This is "voodoo engineering".
Monitor timing is NOT appropriately solved by a Monte Carlo method.

Which shows how little you (or whoever wrote this Xconfig) knows about 
LCD displays.  LCD displays are FAR more sensitive and prone to failure 
than CRTs are.  Just a few seconds at an incorrect clock speed can
completely destroy an LCD.  This is part of why XFree86 doesn't really
support laptops.  Programming LCD controllers is HARD, very hard.  The
only laptops we do support are those who derive their LCD timings from
CRT timing programming (about half of the chipsets).  When's the last
time you spoke with an engineer who makes these chipsets?  I have.

In fact, there is, in general, exactly ONE set of timing numbers that
is appropriate for a given LCD configuration, and NO OTHERS.  The
chipset will emulate other video modes by programming shadow/auxilliary
registers to change what actually gets displayed.  This is for real
LCD-controllers, not CRT-emulation controllers.  The latter are sensitive,
but not quite so sensitive.

We have.  It was posted to the net.

Both methods are crap and dangerous.  However, one is based on real
science, and the other is voodoo engineering.  I would prefer to trust
my monitor to science.

No, Dirk's attitude shows terrible disdain for people who think they
know more than the people who actually work with the code every day of
their lives, work with the hardware, work with the users, etc, etc.

BSDI's X configuration program does EXACTLY the same things that 
README.Config does, except wrapped in a shell script rather than hving
the user fill in the form.  I had intended to do that for 2.0, but I
ran out of time.  So I wrote it all down, step by step.

You will find that all of the commercial X servers provide a bunch of
generic modes and nothing more, as their stock configurations.  Some
of them give you the flexibility to do other modes by hand if you want.

>4. The real "crap" in my opinion is the belief that the existing manual

No one ever said it was completely safe or correct.  It is based on
science, however.

I am convinced, however, that the generic video modes in README.Config
with XFree86 2.0 are 100% correct and applicable to any multisync
monitor and most fixed-sync monitors.  All you have to do is pick the mode
from the table that matches you monitor's capabilities (640x480@60Hz, 
etc), put that in your Xconfig, and you will have a stable and usable display.
Which can then be tuned using the methods in VideoModes.doc.

I challenge anyone to show me a multisync monitor for which there is no
working mode in README.Config for each of the spec'd resolutions of the
monitor (640x480@70Hz, 800x600@60Hz, 1024x768, etc).  I don't think you'll 
be able to fail, if you READ and FOLLOW the simple steps in that document.
Which, BTW, are based on experience and engineering, and not Monte Carlo
methods.

We'd get a lot farther if all these people with all their brilliant
ideas would examine the engineering involved rather than arbitrarily
dismissing what it is that the people doing the engineering are providing.

>dave safford
>

I'll take it a step farther - XFree86 will not support users of 
distributions that provide non-approved configuration methods in place
of our provided ones.  For XFree86 2.0, that means that if you use
other than Xconfig.sample and README.Config to configure your video
timing, you must obtain help from the provider of your distribution,
not from us.  We will work with you on bugs in the servers or other
components, but we will not assist you with your timing problems.

This is not to say that the process can't be improved.  We are doing
everything we can in our limited amount of available time to get things
as good as they can be.  Which is why I spent 3 solid days developing
README.Config, based on several hundred pages of register dumps from
several dozen video boards.  I.e. it was done scientifically.  We
are still looking for better ways; we have some ideas, and perhaps
XFree86 2.1 will have a better scheme still.  Anyone who has a better
idea should discuss it with us first, or take the responsibility for
supporting users of their mechanism, without our involvement.

If this account is accurate it is very disturbing.  It says that NCSA
is not complying with their license when they distribute Xmosaic
statically linked binaries without a notice that users are required to
have a Motif license.  They can comply by including such a license,
but anyone who uses such a binary on  a computer without a Motif 
license will be liable to suit by OSF.  The fact that NCSA has an
educational license is only relevant for their INTERNAL use.

In particular, academic and commercial institutions who are very careful
about subjecting themselves to liability will be unwilling to use Xmosaic on
any CPU without a Motif license.  This must include nearly all Suns in
existence today.

Yup.  Two problems here.  I forget (bad quality control here!) to
change the bootstrap program to unconditionally allow a 68040 now.

Also, it looks like the code I put in to allow you to continue has a
stupid logic bug in it so that it will *never* continue.

You have a choice.  You can either get the kernel source, apply the
following patch and recompile the bootstrap program, or wait for me to
upload a fixed version of the "bootstrap" program.

Actually, you have a third choice.  You could patch the machine code
in the "bootstrap" binary to skip the 68040 check.  I don't know how
many of you are willing to try to do this.

I'm a relatively newcomer to un*x (since I came to U. of waterloo) but I got the slackware 1.10 distribution recently.  Even though I know nothing about unix administration, and I don't even know C language, I managed to get Xfree86 2.0 running on the same sitting session as the insertion of the linux boot floppy.

I flipped through FAQ's and documents, and I found an 800x600 generic 56 hertz
video mode in a table, and copied it in the configuration for Xfree86.  It booted up with that familiar "X" mouse cursor and background (as to the terminals I use at school) and exited, but after editing some .xinitrc file in root directory, it seems to work fine now and intuitively in OLWM..

This is contrary to a friend of mine who spent frustrating days with the SLS
distribution, trying to get Xwindow to run!

(Now after 7 years of programming experience with 4 languages except C, I think it's time for me to learn some! That's one reason why I installed linux - to give me some incentive :)

According to all my documentation, the behavior you described for ESC [0m
is indeed correct. In order to turn off the reverse/bold/underline while
keeping the color, I believe the correct procedure is to reissue the escape
with color commands i.e. ESC [0;3?;4?m. While there is nothing to keep you from

I disassembled the bootstrap program as you suggested, Hamish..
I changed the byt at offset 0x0d72 from 67 to 60
(this changes a BEQ to a BRA, skipping the code you highlighted)

OK... so the boot progresses, and then the screen clears, probably
as expected, but then NOTHING happens.

I'm running bootstrap like this:

bootstrap -r filesys

... filesys, bootstrap and vmlinux are the only linux things I have in
my system - I don't have any special partitions, but I would have
expected more than this on the linux screen?

But how does the remote system know what colors you have preset?  I cannot
even get Linux man to respect respect the color setting because less uses ^[[m
to turn off the character attributes.  What standard are you referring to?

Basically there is a low level routine to add/delete only 1 line.  Multiple
lines are implemented by calling this routine in a while loop.  This is very
inefficient and is noticeable.   I will rewrite this a post the patches.

I think, we should stop blaming each other. We all have to thank the
Xfree developers for this very good package. BUT: Like most of all
freeware, it sometimes seems to be made for freaks and gurus, not
for Mr. Normaluser. We get hundreds of calls for help every month.
I would say about 60 % DO have trouble configuring X-Windows.

If we want Linux to become an alternative operating system even for
non gurus, we have to find a simple and bulletproof way to get graphics
working. Remember, the usual user doesn't have netaccess and just wants 
to plug and play. The usual user is not interested in the details of his 
graphics board or display.

I'm a system- and networkprogrammer. I'm not to deep in graphics - so my 
question would be: Where is the problem to start  X and use cursor up 
or cursor down until there is a usable picture? 

Like tuning in a tv channel ... ?
