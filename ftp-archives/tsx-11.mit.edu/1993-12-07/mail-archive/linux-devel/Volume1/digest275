I agree.  It is slow in the sence that it wastes alot of cpu time.  Just
because you have a fast computer, you do not want to waste all the cpu time
with a GUI.  Motif is overly bloated

Many of them were writen with a GUI tool.  These GUI tools, although very easy
to use, yeald very hefty programs.  I have seen a 35Meg motif binary (striped).

True but the Mac just has a set of guidlines to follow in programming.  That
is all that is needed for X as well.  People are starting to reffer to the
Motif GUI guide already.  It is not that hard to meet the basic GUI guide
lines with any tool kit.  I have seen several programs writen with only Xlib
that have a nice look and feel.

I am looking for Public Domain / 'Copyleft' drivers for GPIB.
Does anyone know if such a thing exists yet ?

Specifically I am looking for a driver/ drivers for Linux, but
failing that any source code that could be hacked would help.

Assuming no such code exists, I am setting out to write it, 
and release it under the GNU copyleft. If anyone is interested

OpenLook was even /worse/ an alternative, since it was only SUN who owned the

Does anyone really think for a minute that some startup company won't

I'll speculate it will be about 6-12 months before you'll be able
to buy such a library.  This is probably why OSF is now trying to
be more agressive in enforcing their copyrights --- they don't have much
time before their current sole-source status is gone.

Mostly they set it to the lowest common denominator, and give you a horrible
little program (often called vmode.exe), that has obscure options to tell
things to use a higher refresh rate for a particular resolution.

You aren't really missing anything, apart from the VESA modes that are listed
in the xconfig docs somewhere incluide the 'standard modes' so you can start

Perhaps someone would like to substantiate heresay with some factual data. 
At my prior employer I used Motif to develop a "real-time" status display 
to monitor ground equipment. The programs responded instantaneously and
repeated profile analysis showed that the negligible amount of CPU that 
they did use was not in Motif. I would characterize Motif as anything but 
slow.

You obviously haven't tried to program in the raw Xlib, Macintosh,
Presentation Manager, or Windows environments.

I sincerely doubt this had anything to do with Motif. The whole library
is ~500k on a Sun SPARC. Even if your link editor pulls in every last
module in libXm, libXt, and libX11, (statically linked) the libraries
only contribute ~1.5meg, unstripped. That 35 meg came from somewhere
else.

And in any case, while you might be able to do it with Linux dosemu, you can't
do it *portably* with *every* *ix that XFree86 runs on.  XFree86 is NOT Linux-

But it's probably also unrealistic.  I would venture to guess that most
of the free software out there is written by folks who either already program
professionally (developers) or hope to in the future (students).  These folks
are very likely to be using (or learning to use) Motif, simply because it's
become the "official" standard.  In their SPARE time,
these good souls are willing to give back to the community by developing
public domain software.
In essense, you're asking them to also spend their time to develop with one
of these "free" toolkits so you don't have to worry about licensing issues!

The software is free, for crying out loud.  If you don't like the developer-
imposed requirements for building/using the software - don't use it.

That's for sure. To go into detail: The output electric voltage of the 
horizontal transformer is directly proportional to the horizontal frequency
in _most_ designs. If you operate the monitor at a horizontal frequency that is
too high, the probability of high voltage breakthroughs on the output side of
the transformer or even in the secondary coil is very high. Those damages are 
irreparable. You have to replace the horizontal transformer after such an
event. Now guess you have purchased a not-too-expensive taiwanese monitor more
than half a year ago. You you think that any vendor will be able to supply the
correct transformer type? If you don't believe the power of the high voltage,
simply open your running TV set and touch the back side of the monitor
tube (NOOOO, don't do it!!). The voltage is higher than 15000 Volts which 
approximates the operating voltage of electrically powered railways.

This risk is much less when you buy an expensive, high-quality, microprocessor
driven monitor such as the modern EIZOs. Those will try to detect risky
frequencies and shut off the high voltage. But, however, even EIZO warns not
to operate the device outside of the specs, and _no_ vendor will warranty
repair a monitor with a burnt horizontal transformer. 

Hope this helps to clear the discussion. Do _not_ blindly check for horizontal
frequencies by walking through an Xconfig that you don't fully control. 
Immediately switch off your monitor when you see stripes or strange displays,
but at last, this has been written in the FAQ already.

Thanks again the XFree86 team for their work.

Ciao,
hm

You could start by looking into CAP (Columbia Appletalk Protocol).  I
run it under SunOS 4.1.1 and am happy with it.  It provides Appleshare
file server functionality as well as allowing Mac's to print to any PS
printer that the Unix machine knows about.

I don't know if it's been tried under Linux yet.  Here's the CAP faq:






CAP FAQ
=======
Last update:
Mon Aug  3 02:10:07 EST 1992


> What is CAP ?

The Columbia AppleTalk Package (CAP) implements the AppleTalk protocol
stack on a variety of UNIX machines.  The main applications provide an
AppleShare 2.0 compatible server (aufs), a LaserWriter Spooler (lwsrv)
and a program to print to LaserWriters (papif).  The latter can be used
to talk to EtherTalk LaserWriters, LocalTalk LaserWriters used on Dayna
EtherPrint cards or on a LocalTalk/EtherTalk gateway.  There are also a
number of contributed packages bundled with CAP (see cap60/contrib).


> What extra hardware is required for CAP ?

On a SUN or ULTRIX machine, CAP can speak Phase 1 or Phase 2 EtherTalk
packets using packet filters based on the Stanford ENET model.  Where
available, CAP can also use Kernel based AppleTalk or run the UNIX
AppleTalk Bridge (UAB) to act as a gateway.  On other UNIX boxes you
need to have a gateway that can translate IPTalk packets.  Suitable
candidates are Shiva FastPath, Cayman GatorBox or Webster MultiPort Gateway.


> What machines will CAP run on ?

The CAP Configure script has specific support for the following
Operating Systems:

        sunos - SUN SunOS
        ultrixnn - DEC Ultrix 1.2, 2.0, 4.N
        irix - Silicon Graphics IRIS/IRIX
        aix - IBM AIX System V
        hpux - HP HP-UX 8.0
        uts - Amdahl UTS
        aux - Apple A/UX 2.0
        encore - Encore MultiMax BSD
        pyr - Pyramid (BSD Universe)
        next - NeXT/MACH
        dynix - Sequent Balance
        newsos - Sony NEWS
        bsd - BSD 4.2, 4.3


> What is the current CAP version ?

CAP is at version 6.0 with (currently) 125 patches to be applied, most of
which add extra functionality to the original.  To determine the current
patch level of your sources, check the cap60/README file for a line of
the form

        o CAP Distribution 6.0, Patch Level 125, July 1992


> Where can I get CAP ?

CAP can be obtained by anonymous FTP from

rutgers.EDU             src/{cap60.tar.Z,cap60.patches/*}
munnari.OZ.AU           mac/{cap60.tar.Z,cap.patches/*}
gatekeeper.DEC.COM      pub/net/appletalk/cap/{cap60.tar.Z,cap.patches/*}

src.doc.ic.AC.UK        mac/multigate/{cap60.tar.Z,cap.patches/*}

Please choose an appropriate site and an off-peak time for the transfer.

The patches are available individually or as the files "patches.1-75.tar.Z",
"patches.76-100.tar.Z" and "patches.101-125.tar.Z". Additionally, for new
users, a partially patched source file is available as "cap60.pl100.tar.Z"
(the file cap60.tar.Z is unpatched).


> How do I apply the patches ?

To make the process of patching easier, you should get the 'patch' utility
written by Larry Wall, it is normally archived at sites that archive
comp.sources.unix in volume7/patch2.  If you can't find anywhere closer
it is on munnari.OZ.AU.  CAP Version 6.1 will be 6.0 with all the patches
applied and updated cap60/contrib packages.  It will appear when the number
of patches stabilizes.

For each of the patches, run 'patch -p < cap60.patch0NN' from the top level
cap60 directory, for example, in csh

                foreach i (cap60.patches/cap60.patch*)
                patch -p < $i >>& /tmp/patches
                end

and check the /tmp/patches file for patching errors (should be none).
To remove the *.orig files that patch leaves behind (containing the original
version of the file), run 'make spotless' from the top level directory (note
that spotless also removes all makefiles so gen.makes needs to be run to
regenerate them).

Sigh. Using the patch program to apply patches requires a minimal amount of
time and energy.  Taking time to install the patch program will pay off for
CAP and other program updates.

It took just 3:11 to apply 75 patches to the raw CAP tar source.  The extra
overhead is the time to FTP 3 files, cap60.tar.Z, patches.1-74.tar.Z and
cap60.patch075 and uncompress them.  The total time spent on this ... 8:02.

> Is there a version of CAP available that supports Ethertalk Phase 2 ?

Phase 2 support was added in CAP 6.0 patches 25, 28 & 35 for SUN NIT, ULTRIX
4.n and SUN enet driver respectively.

The UNIX AppleTalk Bridge (UAB) is the EtherTalk gateway.  It can handle
multiple ethernet interfaces and gateway between them.  This is its primary
function but it can also be set up to provide CAP services.  But ...

UAB is *currently* Phase 1 only.

The original method of achieving this was to removing read permission from
the data fork of the Application (make it non-zero length if the file is
empty).  The current method involves using the Application Manager added in
patch number 61.  Either of these methods can be circumvented by users who
are either knowledgeable or determined.

CAP uses DDP checksums by default, the checksum code in the Phaser III PXi
and the Apple Personal LaserWriter NTR incorrectly calculate the checksum
value and the packet is dropped. The programs aufs, lwsrv, papif, atis,
atlooklws and tlw now support the -k option to disable CAP checksums on a
per-program basis. To disable CAP checksums completely, add the following
lines to the m4.features file, rerun gen.makes and remake CAP.

# + DONT_DOCHKSUM no DDP checksums (Tektronix Phaser III PXi & Apple LW NTR)
define(`specialcflags',concat(specialcflags,` -DDONT_DOCHKSUM'))
#

No other code changes are necessary.

You need to obtain the net_common.o and pfilt.o patches from DEC.  Do not
turn on the ifconfig copyall (stop-gap measure previously suggested on the
net).  Do not define ULT42PFBUG in m4.features.

This means that something has been allocated the UPD port 774 (768+6)
by 'portmap'. You can check this with the command 'rpcinfo -p'.

There are two solutions, break 'start-cap-servers' into two so that aarpd
and atis is started before portmap. Alternatively, and preferably, install
the NIC assigned port numbers into /etc/services. See the doc in the file
cap60/doc/install.ms for more details.

The ENET drivers use devices of the form enet0, enet1 etc. Replace the
string "le0" with "enet0".
