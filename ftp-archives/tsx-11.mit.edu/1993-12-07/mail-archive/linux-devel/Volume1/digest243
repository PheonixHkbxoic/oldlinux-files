I tried this for grins and it does work under SunOS 4.1, but there is
a delay of between 1/2 and 1 seconds between the microphone on machine
A and the speaker on machine B.  I assume that this is due to an I/O
buffer somewhere that is getting filled before the data goes out.  At
8000 bytes/second there must be a 4K or 8K buffer somewhere.

If I can scrounge up another microphone I'm going to see if it works
full duplex.  Can one process have /dev/audio open for reading and
another process have it open for writing?

Yea, I know, I should get a life.

I have the same card, and after speaking with the people who sold me my
system, they said that even with the 1542 driver you're still getting
the full speed performance. The reason is that the BT747 loosely emulates
the 1542, but does full busmastering transfers. I did some iozone timings
and discovered that was more or less true. Of course, none of this is
very scientific.

I'd love to know more about this board. It seems to have trouble talking
to a CD-ROM player I bought (SCSI-1, IBM PS/2 box, I forgot the actual drive...)
Linux boots and the BT747 detects the drive, but accessing it generates
tons of timeout messages (in the SCSI sense values)...

One of the reasons rawrite is slow is that it only writes 3 sectors at a time,
probably because that's a safe limit for all drives. I changed my copy to write
a whole track at a time without errors. Makes for a great improvement and I use
it as a DOS dd.

        I expect that your binary is statically linked *to the Motif

I would be the last to deprive Linux of any source of amusement.
However I think it's useful to tabulate the expected bogomips for each
processor type and speed.  I think one of reasons to continue printing
the bogomips figure is for people to verify that their machine is
properly configured.  We've caught a system that was inadvertently
running with reduced clock speed.  For this to work, we had to know
roughly what the expected bogomips figure was for that processor type.

        As I have said before, I do not find it surprising that the Bustek
EISA boards in the 1542 emulation give much better performance than the 1542.

        Anyway, there is a native driver for BusTek boards under development,
and very soon people will be able to try both and see what the actual
difference is.

        The sense buffers can be decoded and they provide a lot of information
about what might be going wrong.  Lots of timeout messages from a cdrom can be
a symptom of a number of things.  You might want to check:

* Bus termination.
* Flakey scsi cable.
* You are not overloading the power supply on your system.
* Thumbprints on the cdrom.
* The laser head is clean (you can get special cleaning discs).
* The SCSI mode page for error control is not set up to retry read errors.

-Eric

With very inexpensive power supplies that come with clones like what I have,
running too many things at the same time can result in a lot of data errors on
a cdrom. Unplugging some unused things seems to help quite a bit (actually at
the moment I have an external power supply connected to my cdrom).  I do not
have a good sense of where the actual problem lies - it could be noise coming
through because of poor filtering, or it could be cheap power connectors that
do not make good contact.  I used to have an NEC drive that would
intermittently give me all sorts of trouble, but when I put in a Dell box with
SVr4 it has started working like a champ.  The Texel drive that I replaced the
NEC with is also giving intermittent errors.  Anyone have a 300W Dell power
supply for sale? (-:

In reality, though, what will happen is the the developer will pay the royalty,
and the end-user will also pay it.  Developers will not exert the effort to
have different pricing, or to verify anything.

You fill up your disk with huge executables and spend all of your memory and
cycles drawing pseudo-3D art-deco borders around every linear displayed
feature.  How a button drawn this way is supposed to be easier to click on
than one drawn with normal lines (a la Xaw) is beyond me.  I also don't see how
something like an xbiff is easier to use when its screen area is doubled by
the abovementioned borders.

I predict that the same thing will happen as has happened with "DCE".  It will
be so expensive that nobody will buy it, and it will be similarly ignored.

In my message, I was talking about the allocation of fragments on
the disk.  Piercarlo Grandi seems to be talking about "the really
terrifying details of the consequences of the FFS fragmentation scheme on
incore buffers".  I'll agree that I was terrified.

Again, look at The Design and Implementation of 4.3 BSD for the
details of allocating fragments.  It's all in Section 7.7.
Here's a brief rewording that summarizes the interesting facts.

If a file system has a reasonable amount of space, disk allocation
is being optimized for time.  In this case, the first fragment of
a file is allocated on a best-fit basis.  That is, the system tries
to find an isolated fragment for this file.  When the file grows
into a second fragment, the old and new fragment are placed in
the first two fragments of an empty block.  The file can grow
six more fragments until a new block is needed.  Each time, the
file uses all eight fragments of a block, a new block is allocated
for the next fragments of the file.

If the file system is pretty full, disk allocation is being optimized
for space.  In this case, fragments are allocated on a best-fit
basis as the file grows.  Obviously this can involve a lot of
allocating and de-allocating as the file grows.

So, once again, when allocating fragments on a disk using the
"fast" file systems that descended from BSD:
        Files CAN use multiple fragments.
        A 42k file WILL consist of 8 full blocks and 2 fragments.

I remember reading related posts some time back.  It seems the danger
is for people without multisync monitors.  Multisync monitors are reported
to be safe in that they can not be driven beyond safe operating limits.
Non-multisync monitor CAN be driven outside safe limits.  This can 
quickly result in blown fly-back transformers!  Bummer!

My multisync happens to be NEC, but I believe other non-NEC multisyncs
should be OK (safe)...

Still, next time I eagerly install the latest and greatest Linux
(Slackware) I will 1) use my current Xconfig as a go-by and 2) look
at /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt.

Subject: Re: How many BogoMips on a Pentium?
Date: 20 Nov 1993 18:47:12 GMT

I tested a Pentium for a week at my job.

I didn't write down the bogomips cause it wasn't worthwhile to do this,
since it is just a timer setup routine for some devices (QIC-80 come to
mind).

What I did do was benchmark it in other ways.  I was looking to see if it
was a worth while processor for a future machine.

Things I did:
        dhrystone
        compile of the kernel, 99pl13 clean
        news expiration (harder to watch, since the systems were a litte
                different)
        compiles of the same packages concurrently

What were my results?
        dhrystone               Pentium 35% faster
        compile of the kernel   Pentium 22% faster
        news expiration         Pentium 2-7% faster (clean disks versus
                                        other system)
        compiles concurrent     Pentium 23% faster

These are from the top of my head.  It was faster, but not as much as
a person would think.

Configurations of the machines were basically the same:

        486-DX50, 8 megs RAM, 256K cache, WD IDE drives (340, 170)
        Pentium, 8 megs RAM, 512K cache, WD IDE drive (170)

I think I am going to run another test again, using basic same configs
but using the same exact drives (dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdb :) so
that things like fragmentation and layout of the filesystems can be
reduced.

My conclusion:  It was fast, but not worth the extra cash to spend on
        it.  The concurrent compile was the best I could do at multiple
        users using the machine, since my machine runs multiple users
        here at home all the time, I had to try to get the pentium to
        the same area of usage.
