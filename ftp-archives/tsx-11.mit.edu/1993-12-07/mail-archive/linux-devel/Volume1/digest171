Ugh, that monstrosity from AIX. I've heard it is a real pain, and
always in the way.

Maybe the menu package that SLS co-opted for itself, maybe that could be 
set-up for system administration. Much better idea.

Subject: Other Yggdrasil problems (Was: Can't install Yggdrasil - a workaround found.)
Date: Mon, 18 Oct 1993 00:07:54 GMT


There are a couple of other problems with the Fall Yggdrasil CDROM.
I've forwarded them to Yggdrasil (and Rik Faith), but I thought I'd
post them here in case anybody else is having problems.

    1.  The install script (INSTALL/install) doesn't handle the case
        of no swap.
    2.  fdisk crashes if the drive controller returns an unexpected
        disk geometry (which makes it difficult to install!).  Also, If
        the first drive in a system has more partitions than the second,
        the fdisk -l performed by the install script pads out the
        partition listing of the second drive with the partitions
        detected on the first.  Potentially confusing for newbies.

Also note that /etc/init expects reboot to be in /usr/bin, but it's
located in /bin.

Of course, to fix these, you'll need a minimal development system -
either an old linux installation, or a cd-dependant install on an
existing partition.

And some nitpicking:

    3.  If you boot from the supplied floppy, the demo won't run on
        an 8Mb machine (insufficient mem).  Should be mentioned in
        the manual somewhere.
    4.  It would have been nice to have included a more recent poeigl,
        and Miquel van Smoorenburg's SysV init (instead of the dated
        one in admutils).
    5.  No selection-1.5 (kernel support, but no program).
    6.  Kernel recompile requires IN2000 support, but a quick
        #ifdef CONFIG_IN2000/#else/#endif fixed that.
    7.  asteroids needed a patch (XGrabKeyboard in plot.xwin.c) before
        I could use it - now I don't need to go to the arcade :-)!

Great product, tho.  I'll probably like it even better when I get
around to cleaning out my disk and installing it.

Although I don't have access to any scanners apart from the GS4500, I wrote
the code such that the scanner detection routines can be added to a table,
and made the interface sufficiently generic (ie, really simple) that it
shouldn't be too much of a pain to merge multiple scanner drivers.

The output from the scanner device is raw pixel data.  There is program
included with the scanner driver that converts this data into a PBM file,
so to view a picture is as simple as:
        testscan | xv -

Of course, this presupposes X.  If you don't want to use X, save the output
of testscan in a file, and manipulate it as you like.  I belive there is a
program in netland that allows viewing pictures using vgalib, so it should be
possible to convert the PBM file into a format that the viewer understands.

Low on my list of things to do is add scanner support to xv and xpaint.  It's
not a high priority because the current way of scanning a pic (testscan > junk)
is simple enough.  If the scanner driver gets more widely used, and there are
requests from users, I might up the priority.

Sounds suspiciously like Solaris 2's /devices directory.  /dev consists solely
of symlinks to the real device nodes in /devices.  The difference being that
Solaris 2's device probe only takes place if you "boot -r"; otherwise, the
original contents of /devices is retained.  ("boot -r" also takes care of
maintaining the links from /dev to /devices, and of creating pseudo-device
nodes such as ptys.  The latter would be unnecessary with a proc-based
mechanism; Solaris 2's /devices is solely based on the result of a hardware
probe.)

[ Suggestion to remove /dev deleted ]

How about all the software out there that currently expects/uses things
in /dev?  I.e. terminal stuff that looks for /dev/tty, etc... etc...  
Granted, all that stuff can be ported/recompiled/reconfigured, but do 
_you_ want to handle that?  (Note: if /proc/dev is an exact mirror of
the way that /dev looks right now, perhaps a symlink would work?  perhaps 
not *shrug*)

Shared memory interfaces, like some ethercards and SCSI controllers, sit in
the 640K-1M region.  Caching those regions will result in, uhmmm, "a marked
decrease in system performance" ;->.

I _would_ like to see the X server running with caching enabled there -- could

Reply-To: johnsonm@SunSite.unc.edu (Michael K. Johnson)

The Linux Kernel Hackers' Guide (the KHG), one of the Linux
Documentation Project (the LDP) books, is now officially in "BETA".
It is still very limited in scope, but hopefully is more useful to
people interested in the Linux kernel than the earlier releases.

It will be of use primarily to people trying to write device drivers
and to people trying to write extensions to the proc filesystem.  The
memory management stuff is a little out of date, but I am waiting to
work on that until the memory management is sorted out, as it appears
to be in a state of flux.

It is available as both tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/docs/LDP/khg* and
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/LDP/kernel-hackers-guide/*.   The
source is available in a tar file, and there are also PostScript and
DVI files available.  I am not yet providing ASCII, groff, or any
other type of output format, and I will not worry about providing any
of those formats until the KHG is reasonably stable, most likely.

Date: 18 Oct 93 05:17:56 GMT

Well if you've been reading any of the linux newsgroups you are aware
of the raging debate going on about the quantity and types of questions
to the newsgroup comp.os.linux.development. I decided to start asking
folks who post questions on c.o.l.d and c.o.l.admin why they put their
questions there. I've done this simply by E-mailing a survey question
to the original poster and saving the replies. Maybe we can use this
info to make some intelligent decisions about how to manage questions
in the linux hierarchy.

Here is the summary so far. Anonymous of course. I have been indiscriminate 
of the type of question posted. Every new question that has been posted to 
c.o.l.d or c.o.l.admin I've send a survey to. This is about 5 days of 
summaries. I plan to continue my survey and post a cumulative summary
every week or so. All followups to this post should go to comp.os.linux.misc
so as not to stir up any more traffic in the other groups. I've set
the follow to c.o.l.m.

Please feel free to comment on the contents of this. I've asked the
respondents if they minded an anonymous summary and no one has objected
so far.

First the survey E-Mail:
==========================================================================
Hi,

I can't help on your problem. I'm conducting an informal survey. I wanted
to know why you posted a question to comp.os.linux.development when the
comp.os.linux.help group is specifically for questions?

It's no problem to me and no flame to you. I'm just trying to gather info
so that I can intelligently respond to folks when they ask me this 
question. There is a big debate going on in the linux newsgroups over this 
topic.

Also I wanted to know if you objected to an anonymous summary of your 
answer at some later time.

Thanks and waiting for your reply,

Hi Byron,

well before posting this message to *.admin I thought about where to
post it. I was not not sure if to post it to *.help or even to

instructions for installation of xarchie, which said it UDP-ports

Hi Byron,

I believe I can post for requesting help in c.o.l.d because
I have problem with gcc and profiling, and I need profiling
to do development under linux.

Do you understand the term development only kernel hacking or those
who attempt to do that or who already contributed a lot
to LINUX, e.g. Linus T. ?

The compiler is one of the central part of an OS, maybe my request
points out a general problem, a feature leak and so it is of common 
interest. Due to this it is not only a help request !
Just remember it went fine with gcc 2.3.3.

Hope, You means the same thing as I do, with profiling I surely
do not mean .profile for bash (actually in discussed in c.o.l.help)
but execution profile of a program at runtime, how often a function 
was called and how much time it consumed.

Because you ask me to post to c.o.l.help and in the context 
of the actual discusion on c.o.l.d (see "Questions are permitted on c.o.l.d")
I feel very confused, sad and a bit ill about that what is going on
and due to this you receive this flame like reply.

BTW, I am the one of many who voted for the c.o.l.* and 
believe to know where questions should be posted to.
Before my posting I already investigate lots of time to find
out what are missing, I compliled gcc my self and check every
files to find out if I could generate the needed files myself.

Hope, You will be aware by judging what should belong to c.o.l.d
and what not.

Sory, You will receive this email with a bit delay. My own 
private host is connected via uucp, I use to call out only 
once a day for emails and news.

If you can, your help will be greatly appreciated.

Ah... Reason for posting to c.o.l.d. Seemed to be the best place to ask 
on a question about development of hardware...

I wasn't too sure about posting it myself, which is why I made it short and 
simple.

        Didn't notice the group .help, and frankly wasn't looking if an
admin group exists for a specific OS then I use that because it tends to
be the place most of the expertise is.

> [Survey Deleted]
Pure sfortune...I do not know very well quotas or nfs handling, so
errounesly I thought that this limitation was caused by the
nfs-software of linux not enough advanced. About 15 minutes AFTER I
posted the article I discovered that this is in fact normal behaviour
and NOT a Linux-problem :(

 Becuase password problems are an administrative issue, are they not?
 If the .admin group is NOT for administrative concerns, then perhaps
 it should be rm'd.

> [Survey deleted]
Simply because I was under the impression that development also referred
to applications development under Linux. And I was under the impression
that the help group was more oriented towards user-type questions,
such as network setup, Xwindows setup, etc., etc.

I thought my question was a pure administration problem - not installation
or bug problem.  It is sometimes hard to tell apart then one uses
c.o.l.misc...  :)

Subject: Re: Dos + Linux 2 Controllers

> [ Survey deleted]
Because, at least to me, this seems like an ADMIN type problem.  The Help
group would seem to be one where people would ask "how does 'ls' work" or
what file do I edit when I want aliases to be recognized upon login?
Aren't questions about administration type problems supposed to be asked
in an admin group?

I don't believe that you will be able to gear all the questions that people
will ask to a certain news group just by posting "post only discussion about
X here" because possibly people, like me, may not read these messages due
to time/work whatever.

BTW: Should ALL linux questions go to linux.help?  This seems rather 
unreasonable.

> [ Survey Deleted ] 
No problem.  The reason for this post in c.o.l.d was basically because of
topic.  This particular group was created for communication on system
development issues (kernel, file systems, device drivers, difficult porting,
etc).  Since this question concerned the development of a particular fs
support, I posted it here.  Simple enough? :)

AS to the c.o.l.h vs c.o.l.h... c.o.l.h is for general help, ie, 'how do I
get such and such a program to work?', 'why am I getting this error?',
'how can I make this compile', etc, etc.   Any issue that relates to
LINUX DEVELOPMENT belongs in here (c.o.linux.development :).  There are in
fact some questions that may fit into both groups, as they have a fine
overlap area.  Unlike c.o.l.a there was no condition stating that no
questions of any sort would be allowed in c.o.l.d when we voted/split.  It
is my personal opinion that questions definately contribute to the
developmental process, so long as they are appropriate.  

As to the occasional 'off-topic' posts that end up in c.o.l.d.  I just
don't read them, or if I do, I respond via email.  There is no
reason to generate even more garbage in the group.  'off-topic' is not
defined (defining it in a weekly post of some sort would be a good idea),
and therefore opinions will vary. 

There will always be a stray post or two (or three, or four), especially
with new lnux users every day.  There is no reason to discourage these new
users with 'flames', or irk your fellow c.o.l.d reader with more off-topic
posting.  Simply moving off-topic discussion to other c.o.l or private
channels will maintain efficiency.

Yeah.  I wasn't exactly complete about the above.  The sequence I use to get
mounting/umounting to work properly and reliably is:

    umount /dev/sdbx
    [remove media]
    </dev/sdb
    [kernel detects disk change, returns error on read]
    [insert media]
    </dev/sdb
    [kernel detects disk change, tries to re-read partition table of new media]
    mount /dev/sdbx
