I'm not sure I understand what the full issue here.  Here's what I know
for sure:

I can successfully run the binary version of Mosaic 2.0 (based on Motif
programming) distributed by NCSA on a stock Solaris 2.2 release (e.g.
no Motif at all).  The results of ldd and file are:

gaea [100] % ldd `which Mosaic`
        libc.so.1.7 =>   /usr/4lib/libc.so.1.8
        libdl.so.1.0 =>  /usr/4lib/libdl.so.1.0
        libucb.so.1 =>   /usr/ucblib/libucb.so.1
        libc.so.1 =>     /usr/lib/libc.so.1
        libw.so.1 =>     /usr/lib/libw.so.1

        libaio.so.1 =>   /usr/lib/libaio.so.1
        libintl.so.1 =>  /usr/lib/libintl.so.1
gaea [101] % file `which Mosaic`
Mosaic:       Sun demand paged SPARC executable dynamically linked

which tells me that no Motif runtime libraries are needed, nor is Mosaic
statically linked.

What I don't understand:

Where/why should OSF get a payment for my ability to run Mosiac?  Is this
example not allowed by the Motif licensing agreement?

I thought Motif programming eventually resolves to low level X calls,
so you only need Motif if you want to compile Motif-based code.  If all
the calls are resolved down to the level of X-based code, why does
distribution of something like Mosaic require Motif licensing on the
runtime machine?

Thanks for any enlightenment.

This would be alright Rick, IFF it were not for the rather unfortunate
decision of the Mosaic team to develop with Motif.  When I raised an alarm
on the use of Motif several months ago, Marc Andreeson (sp?) justified the
choice on ease of using the widgets, but excused the choice by pointing out
that Mosaic would be available statically linked for most significant
platforms at NCSA.  The Linux crowd have been posting statically linked
versions of Mosaic on sunsite and other sites for some time now, even with
builtin term support I believe.  Mosaic is perhaps the single most important
free Internet application and the modal way of acquiring it is to ftp it
from one of these sites, already statically linked.  If the statements about
license fees for every distributed copy are true, then those of us who have
been getting Mosaic this way will be cut off.

This has always been my greatest reservation about OSF and Motif.  I don't
like the look and feel, but the way in which Mosaic users are now
potentially being held virtual hostages is really too bad.

As far as I understand the article, that is a bad problem. The old standard
(ISO Pascal) is the only *standard*. Most modern Pascal implementations do
have random access files with names determined during runtime, bitwise
logical operators, more or less useful strings and a module/library
mechanism. But all these extensions are not standard. They differ between
Turbo Pascal. VAX Pascal and HP Pascal etc. All these things are
standardized in ANSI C.  

BTW, thanks to the portability of C, there is a widely portable Pascal-to-C 
     translator that understands most Pascal dialects.

   As a practical matter, Motif applications are generally compiled

   would not need a royalty payment. Furthermore, they would not be of

   There is not much that the OSF can do to police and enforce this policy,
   however, they don't have to - it is self enforcing since statically linked

The original statement was not strictly true either.  All of the Motif
1.2.2 developers' kits that I have used (MetroLink on Linux, IXI and
SunSoft on SPARC) have a license that allows the distribution of
binaries statically linked with Motif libraries.

  Hi,

Subject: Some ideas and reasons for a more modular kernel.
Date: Tue, 16 Nov 1993 17:10:32 GMT

This is just some rather loose ideas about devices-as-tasks which may
be useful.  I'm sorry I haven't had time to make this into a coherent
proposal.

Reading the Kernel Hacker's Guide, I noticed a comment about the
monolithic Linux kernel.  I can't recall the exact details, but it
expressed doubt as to why anyone would want a non-monolithic kernel.
Here's an example of why I'd like device drivers to be tasks -- at the
user level if possible.

(Please note that I'm a great fan of Linux -- it works really well,
 but I'd like to think there isn't any monolithic design bigotry, only
 pragmatism.)

Suppose I want to implement a compressed file system.  There are
various ways of doing this -- the most obvious would be to add stuff
to the ext2fs, but this isn't a very modular approach and so the
results aren't very flexible.

A better approach would be to create a new block-special device which
compresses blocks opaquely and is ignorant of any file-system
structure imposed apon it.

I should be able to create such a device as an extra layer on top of
an existing block-special device.  For example:

  $ cbd hdc1 /dev/hda1 &
  $ ls -l hdc1
  brw-r--r--   1 richard    ...   hdc1
  $ mkfs -t ext2 hdc1
  ...
  $ mkdir spong
  $ mount hdc1 spong
  $ ls spong
  lost+found

I'm assuming several things here:

  - users can mount their own devices anywhere they have access to
    (and why not, provided they are mounted nosuid?)

  - the cbd (compressed block device) is a process which somehow
    creates a block special device and deals with the mapping between
    hdc1 and hda1

The latter assumes that the kernel can `call' the cbd process to
service read/write/seek requests just like a device compiled into the
kernel.  The interface for this isn't clear to me -- I've only just
started thinking about this -- but I'm sure it's fairly simple.

And why stop there?  The other devices could be provided by tasks with
IO privelege -- hard disk, floppy disk, serial ports, you name it.

Just some thoughts.

This all sounds suspiciously like the way the AmigaDOS operating system
does things. Why doesn't more of the serious programming world start
to realise what a superb machine and OS this is rather than thinking
of the Amiga as a games machine?? :-( (Or a video workstation...)

Statically linked Motif binaries are simply too large to be of much value.

There is not much that the OSF can do to police and enforce this policy,
however, they don't have to - it is self enforcing since statically linked
binaries are just not practical.

True! Damn me, I forgot about tcl/tk. Well, somebody has advanced the

No, they are surely not. What I understand is that up until 1.1.x the
OSF implementation of Motif did not require runtime royalties; since
1.2.x it does.

My understanding is that since 1.2.x a royalty is due for each copy of
a program containing OSF Motif object code; static linking no longer
exempts from the royalty.

Some people here have posted to the effect that static linking does not
require a royalty, which was surely true for 1.1.x, but one stated that
no royalty is required specifically as of 1.2.2. I am not sure as to the
latter point.

In any case OSF Motif is not the right environment for free sw (and
cloning it is a rather boring and long task); any of the alternative
libraries mentioned in the discussion is free sw itself.

I wish that AT&T/whomever made OOLIT/MOOLIT free sw, now that COSE has
made them redundant.

A final note: XView may be out of fashion, but the library itself is
highly portable, it is relatively well debugged, the API is rather
convenient, and there are lots of free sw that use XView. Probably it is
one of the two top APIs, with Athena. However Tcl/TK perhaps deserve
taking over.

Is it possible to read multi-session CDs with any of the existing

Please keep in mind that there is a vast amount of different Motif
licences available from OSF. I got them all some time ago, and I
remember it's possible to buy a licence agreement which includes
issuing new Motif licences. Such licences last 12 months and cost
$3.000.000, if I'm not too wrong. I believe Metrolink et al. has such
a licence and that they're allowed to make some (small) modifications
in the new licences they issue.
