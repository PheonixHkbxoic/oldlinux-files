  We made new version of LXBoot (which is boot loader for Linux).

It is,

(1) fs name base seeking
      LXBoot understands Linux's file system. Then LXBoot seeks kernel by 
    fs name. And you can select kernel before booting.
(2) easy to install
      LXBoot has a installer. It works automatic.

I don't think that it is too good of an idea to have the idle process
do I/O.  Then, it wouldn't be guaranteed to be on the ready queue.
Instead, bdflush would be a replacement for /etc/update.

        Indeed this is true.  The idle process has cs==USER_CS as well, so
it might be unable to do some I/O tasks anyway.

>Instead, bdflush would be a replacement for /etc/update.

        I do not view it as a replacement, I view it as a more specialized tool
that would respond dynamically to the system requirements.  In my mind both
would continue to exist, but they would be doing somewhat different things.
The bdflush (fsflush on our SVr4 machine) would not write all dirty buffers,
but would endeavor to keep the top of the free list supplied with clean
buffers.  Thus it would not always write everything dirty in the buffer cache,
but only perhaps the first 500 dirty buffers.  The update task could
continue to sync every 30 seconds, and would serve a slightly different
purpose.

About two weeks ago I posted a request for help on finding a VAX Fortran 
to C converter for linux.  I recieved many helpfull replies from people 
directly involved in this area.  Unfortunantly our hard drive crashed and 
all of the replies and names and contacts I had gathered were lost!  

If you sent me a reply, I would greatly appreciate if you could reply to 
me again.  There is a good possibility this could lead to contract work, 
or a project leading to a VAX Fortran to C library/utility.   I am 
particulary interested in the fellow who is working on the GNU Fortran 
compiler, and the company that makes Fortran to C utilities, and really 
any one else who replied.  Thanks,

Subject: Summary: Questions in non-help groups
Date: Thu, 28 Oct 1993 22:39:06 GMT

My effort has petered out after a couple of weeks. I received a few basic
classes of responses:

1) "I think my question is appropriate for the group."
2) "There is too much traffic in c.o.l.help."
3) "I post where the gurus are."
4) "I wanted more visibility/faster response."
5) "I didn't know."

In addition from my observations many of the groups are write only becuase
the same questions come up over and over and over again. If posters just
scanned the last week of messages, much of the time they would find an
answer and would not have to post. Also many questions/answers can be found
in the FAQ's and HOWTO's. People don't read them much of the time.

It seems to me that this a bad situation and it's not going to get any better
because the querants don't do any basic research before posting. After
running this survey for a couple of weeks my conclusions are the same:

1) Don't answer inappropriate questions.
2) Direct people to the correct answers (HOWTO, FAQ, whatever).
3) Redirect questions to comp.os.linux.help.

Comments welcome. Survey responses upon request. Followup to c.o.l.misc only.

Later,

No.

Isode does its best to cope with systems that are lacking in places. You can 
get round the lack of async - it's just a case of knowing which signals to 
undef in the config.h file. That at least gets you an isode library that pp 
will compile against (which is what most people want I guess). Mind you pp 
has problems of its own, mainly related to what seems to be overzealous 
freeing of malloced memory which our malloc doesn't like at all...

        There are currently *no* x86 ports of linux available from
Transarc, as of a month ago, according to their sales staff. (I heard
of someone outside of Transarc doing an Intel SVR4 version, but it was
never made into a product.) So that chops out a whole class of
hardware.
        As for NFS gateways: well, there is at least authentication
code for them (which is free, it was written at MIT without using
Transarc code) but what's the point of authentication if read-write
access is likely to toast files? The NFS gateway is marginal for
read-only use, but unacceptable for read-write use, and as far as I
know it doesn't work on that many server architectures (it doesn't run
under DEC Ultrix, for example, even though the AFS server code
does...)
        AFS is really neat, and hopefully the DFS spec will be as free
as the NFS one was (and good enough to implement from) so that there
will be interoperating use. I've heard that this is intended.

Let me add my voice to this cry.  I have an IN2000 and a drive that

seem to work.  I'm willing to alpha or beta test and I'm very curious

Subject: What's wrong with a DOS to Linux disk access?
Date: 29 Oct 1993 00:50:18 GMT

        I'm not very good at programming, but I'd be willing to try helping:
I think some one should write a program in DOS to access the linux partitions.

Everytime I've seen someone ask about accessing Linux disks from DOS, they're
smashed down, with few reasonable responses, even though this is a reasonable
question.
        It makes sense. Not every one who uses DOS and OS/2 are wizzes at
setting computers up. Letting them get to DOS partitions from Linux was
a natural move, especially to help them move (sort of a one-way trap!).
However, There will be many users who _won't_ move completely over to
linux. It is important that we help these people make use of Linux to 
the max. SO lets write a simple program to let them read the linux
partition. It can't be too hard, it doesn't have to be super hi-tech.

        Prefered: Something like the doublespace system device, it loads
        via com or sys file and adds a 'virtual drive' to the system.

        Acceptable: Menu driven acces to the disk. Like MacSee. (i.e. not
        very elegant.)

        I'm willing to help, but I have no idea how to write either of these
and am only a begginer in c. (Just enough to install the delta-ipc to get
dosemu .49 running on kernel pl13 :)

        So anyone willing to help or I suppose to even point me in the right
direction, just speak up.

Sorry about that, I think it's reasonable too, but I'm not about to
actually work to be able to do it.

I don't have code, but I know it will be a small job if anyone wants
to do it.

I wrote one last last summer ('92).  This was before LILO and I
forgot to download shoelace when I first installed linux, so I wrote
my own boot loader rather than boot from floppy all the time :-)

The important subroutine could load an arbitrary file off a Minix
partition into the first meg.  It was about 600 bytes and took a
long night to write in assembler.  It was on the boot block of my
boot partition for a long time, but now I use LILO like everybody
else.

I don't have it any more, I think.  It might still be on some old
DOS backup, but since I deleted DOS just a few weeks later I'm not
sure I ever backed it up.  Doesn't matter, it was so small.

It's tuesday that's the problem.  It seems the creater of TERM UN-intentionally
left some type of bug in the code that caused term to bomb on oct 26. 

The fix: simple either get the patch that's floating around or pick
up term108 from tsx-11 or sunsite.  (I don't know if they're there yet
but they should get there sooner or later)

        Um, I'm not sure why this is necessary?  I can transfer files both ways
without a problem from Linux.  I just mount the MSDOS file system as

        I would tend to think that a DOS reader would be of limited utility,
at best.  Am I missing something?
