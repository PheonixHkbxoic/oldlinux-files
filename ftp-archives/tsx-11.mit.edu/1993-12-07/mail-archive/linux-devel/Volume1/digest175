        Was that a PC drive, or (as I remember) an Atari drive, or something 
else? I thought PC drives were not breakable through software. The only things 
breakable through software I know of are monitors and some IDE drives.

        But I could be wrong...

How unusual am I here... Before I even GOT Linux I read through the FAQ
from beginning to end, making mental notes of the concepts (not actually
trying to understand it all, but noting what's there), and I also read
comp.os.linux for a month and saved what seemed like helpful articles!

What do people have against reading? A little investment of time
now gives you a brief overview of topics you may not be ready
to fully delve into now. 

I would *much* rather read documentation straight through than 
try and follow some convoluted menued method (be it info or anything
else). Hypertext links make it handy but for me, multiple menu levels
just obscure the actual useful info. A mail server would be handy
to grab snippets, but you might miss out on something useful.

Come on, the Linux FAQ is big, but not THAT big.

I agree too. Enough people want this feature to make it worthwhile, and it 
is a real waste to have to repatch every new kernel (why re-invent the wheel?) 
It would be nice to be able to have standard fonts like xterm supports in the 
kernel, plus custom fonts. For example: 

¾

shows up as a 3/4 symbol on an xterm. It would be nice if it could on
Linux too. Also, we wouldn't have this (M-x, o-with slash): 

ø

show up (as do many other characters), as a square box. (Linux has
more character codes that give a square box than I know what to do
with! ;P)

It would be really nice, since the VC interface is so nice to work
with as is, to be able to not have little problems with special
characters.


P.S. Sorry if anyone can't see the 8 bit characters in the post above... ;)

One other note...

tpqic02.* assumes that the drive supports a "set density" command.
There are drives that don't; indicated by getting an "illegal command"
status back whenever the drive is opened.  An example is the Teac
150mb data cassette drive.

To work with those drives, you'll have to ifdef out the code that
tries to issue a "set density" command. The obvious ifdef is the
flag TP_HAVE_DENS (or something like that) from tpqic02.h.

Subject: bug in fcntl record locking?
Date: 19 Oct 1993 17:52:14 GMT

I think I've found a bug in the record locking portion
of the fcntl function.

For example:
=============================================================
all locks are read locks

process A                       process B

fcntl(get lock for region X) 

                        fcntl(get lock for region X)

fcntl(release lock for region X) [1]

                        fcntl(release lock for region X) 

fcntl(release lock for region X) [2]
============================================================

Invocation [1] of fcntl returns an error value, while
invocation [2] returns 0. Obviously this should be the other
way around.

It seems that fcntl can't find its own locks and remove
them if there is another process which has locks on the same 
file.

To solve the problem I've changed lines 284-288 of fs/locks.c
from
=============================================================
        before = &filp->f_inode->i_flock;
        while (   (fl = *before)
               && caller->fl_owner != fl->fl_owner
               && caller->fl_fd != fl->fl_fd)
                before = &fl->fl_next;
=============================================================
into
=============================================================
        before = &filp->f_inode->i_flock;
        while (   (fl = *before)
               && (caller->fl_owner != fl->fl_owner  /* changed */
               || caller->fl_fd != fl->fl_fd))       /* changed */ 
                before = &fl->fl_next;
=============================================================

Since the lock_it function is hard to decipher and I don't know
too much about kernel data structures I don't know whether my 
fix is correct. It works for me, though.

Cheers,

Jan den Ouden

ps. i had to change the locks removal function too (line 182)

Take a look at Solaris 2 (SunOS 5.x) from Sun.  This exact idea was
explained by the Sun people at the UKUUG conference in December 1993
at Oxford.

This has the drawback that you can't force your vendor to supply a C
compiler.  You don't need to rebuild the kernel so you don't need to
have a compiler to do it.

Signal 11 is a Segmentation Violation.  From here, it looks like either
there's a problem with the libraries writing outside of process memory
space, or Seyon doing this with the new libraries as opposed to old.

There's one thing people are forgetting in this discussion of a
dynamic /dev... What about device file ownership and permissions?
Now, I can set my modem to be owned by group 'modem' and give it
group read/write permissions, since I can just chown/chmod the
device file, and it stays there.  This would not be possible if
the device files are recreated every time on boot.

Also, on ISA PC's autodetect doesn't usually work, and some manual
configuration is required in the rc scripts.  This also needs to be
taken into account!
