Get the newest kernel if you want to play with this one: it can be found
on nic.funet.fi: pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus.  As of now, the latest
version is ALPHA-pl13h.tar.gz, and contains (among other things) the
latest NET2debugged stuff and some other patches.  It's reportedly
slower on networking than before, but hopefully stable. 

The ALPHA-pl13h kernel should also fix one long-standing problem where
the machine hangs when swapping heavily under some circumstances.  It
seems the buffer cache simply ran out of buffers and everything waited
for more buffers to magically appear.  As it happened, this miracle
never does occur, so everything just grinds to a halt. 

Note that there aren't any patches for the newer kernels: I did some
source tree re-organizations which will make patching rather
uncomfortable.  Thus only full sources until after pl14.

Date: 21 Oct 93 13:05:18 GMT

Hi,

I find it's a good idea to get "named" core dumps for each image but the 
current naming convention in pl13 isn't that good since

- you can't find and remove all core.* files (some people call source 
  files core.c or core.h 
- it could crash your source if you have an image called 'c' with 
  a source module called 'core.c' :-)

whats amout using 'core' as file name extension (isn't used yet), so
finding *.core sould be more secure and collisions with soures wouldn't
occur (if your file system supports enough characters in file names for
imagename.core).

here my quick patch as an first example

It does mean that you cannot claim conformance to the spec if there
is a verification test suite that you have not passed. Generally,
these kinds of verification suites cost tens of thousands of dollars
to have run. You can claim compatibility with conforming implementations,
however. That compatibility is what I'd be looking at.

Subject: Need help with boot block question
Date: 21 Oct 93 13:33:27 GMT

I'm stumped, and I'm hoping someone out there can help me out.

I'm trying to build a partition boot sector for my hard disk.  My boot sectos
gets loaded by the master boot record and runs just fine so long as I hard-code
hte cyl/sec/head to get the rest of the bootstrap from within the boot sector.

But there are boot sectors that work without hard coding this info, and it's a
definite advantage to avoid doing so.  How can a secondary boot record learn
either of the following:

        1. The head/cyl/sec that it was loaded from
        2. The partition number that it was loaded from

The DOS call to find the boot drive doesn't help.  I'm not running DOS at this
point.

Thanks for any help you may have to offer - if you reply by mail I'll summarize
back to these groups.

Is such a project possible, if it does not already exist?

Is it something that people would want if it does not already exist?

If it does exist, where can I find information on it (either the product,

You find a file called obstack.c (*or something like that) ! You have to type
following line in the beginning:

#undef __GNU_C__ 

(or something like this, You will find a #ifndef __GNU_C (?)
later, please check for that !)

The reason: 

GCC assumes the obstack-functions to be in the GNU library. But in Linux libc,
they aren't !

With this undef, it works for me !

If I'm not mistaken, the spec requires that the code be based on USL's
code (somebody swung a sweet deal), and therefore to be called "UNIX"
you still have to pay royalties.

Other than that, it's mostly just XPG4 or SVID3 compliancy (forget which).

You are using Slackware, don't you ?

Just change in the file: /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.4.5/include/syslimits.h

the line:

#include_next <limits.h>

Sorry for the crosspost, I realized later on, that this newsgroup might be more

Hi !

I posted a question in this newsgroup about a C-Browser-Tool and got many
answers! Thanks to all of you for you effort !

Unfortunatly, noone was really satisfactory (also the couple of mails regarding
XCoral) !

So I began to write a browser-Tool for Linux. My intention is to provide a tool,
which can tell me the following things:

for functions:
- where is it defined
- which parameters does it have
- which functions does it call (normal/library)
- by which functions is it called itself
- which global data does it use
- which scope does it have
- print a call-tree from this function (including/excluding functions,
  and special library-calls)

for variables:
- which Type
- which scope
- where is variable defined
- where is it used (which function/module)
- where is the type defined

[...to be continued ...]

This tool should be able to produce listings but should also be interactive, so
you can enter a function and you get all the information shown in a window. This
might be useful for analysis of unknown C-code !

How should it be done:
You need a parser for C, which should be as close to the GCC as possible. Well, I
took the one which is provided by GNU and patched the GCC (2.4.5) itself ! While
parsing a C-File, GCC produces a Browser-File, containing the needed information
in an easy-to-parse way. I've choosen a tagged ASCII-format, since it can be
processed through various Un*x-tools !


What's working allready:
GCC does produce this browser-file (still buggy, of course), and I have a
flex-Programm called "calls", which tells me the functions, which are called by a
specific function.

I need people, who are willing to contribute to this project. Maybe, in a final
state, it will be a kind of CASE-tool, at least for reverse-engineering unknown
C-Code. I am a little short of time right now, so they might have to make most of
the work by themselfs !

What is needed now are people, who are experienced in writing
user-interface-programs with a lot of interacitivity. If it would be in X11, I
would appreciate it too !

I am not willing to make a public release, unless there are some useful tools
present ! Comments are wellcome, but if you want to contribute, you need at least
30 Meg free disk-space to compile the GCC 2.4.5 sources !

O.k., that's enough for now, please email me if you're interested.

I agree, I have the same problem in pl12. core.[ch] is EXTREMELY
