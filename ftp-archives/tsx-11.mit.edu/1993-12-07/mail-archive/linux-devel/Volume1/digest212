I can't help you with anything freely available for Linux, but I can
point out that both ACU-COBOL and RM/COBOL for DOS work fine under
Linux's DOS emulator.

I'm curious to see what justification he could have for running MS-LOSS at
all!  Besides, while running Linux you can mount the MS-LOSS filesystem
very nicely and do your copying when you have easy access.  If you're
really desperate to run MS-DOG you'd better have your head examined.

Of course, if you're strung out for Windoze, you have got _real_ rocks
in your head.  If you wait for WINE you can probably scrub your DOS
partition FOREVER.

OK, _which_ Linux FileSystem?  MINIX?  EXT?  EXT2?  XIAFS?  It's
really MUCH easier to access the DOS filesystem from Linux than
any other direction.

Neither MS-DOG nor WINDOZE have a functional immune system.  If you
look up the term "security hole" the MS-DOG is second only to the
Macintosh finder.

As to the guy who just bashed DOS over and over. Get a life. If you can't 
live in world with DOS and system 7, then move to the deserted island of
your choice. DOS and System 7 are legitimate OS for many things, even if
they aren't the best. I prefer Linux, but I still have a lot of DOS
software, and have to use a MAC and IBM DOS machines as a part of my
job. I wish you'd take you attitude else where...

This is because abort is a library function and the default shared
libraries are compiled with -fomit-frame-pointer which makes debugging
impossible.  I think it will work if you link with -static and I know
it will work if link with -g AND have a real libg.a installed.

However, you can get pretty good results even with shared libraries by
including your own abort function defined like this:

int abort(void)
{
        *((char *) 0) = 0;
        exit(1);
}

There is a COBOL compiler for the PC which was written by a man dying of
AIDS. He placed the compiler (and source; I am almost certain of this) into
the public domain before he died. Could this source be used? I have no
experience writing compilers, so I don't know all of the nuances, but I would
think that this would be a good place to start. It is available on 
programming BBS systems under the name COBOL650, and a newer version called
COBOL700. The 700 version was his work in progress. The 650 was the last
stable version.

Date: 5 Nov 1993 19:25:17 GMT


Guten Tag!

Unfortunately, while debugging various pieces of code, I really that my
debuggers -- gdb and ups -- demand the sources of libc when libc calls,
like printf or whatever, are reached.

I can pass it by using "next" instead of "step"ping into the call. However,
it's not very comfortable. Moreover, I always get a disturbing little "beep"
for each call with a missing source.

My libs are from image-4.4.1.tar.gz (or so) from the GCC directory on sunsite.

So: what I am doing wrong? 

Thank you in advance! Any information will be appreciated!

Hello,

        Does anyone have or knows of a patch to use DTC 2270 VLB IDE

it does not even need one.  Under dog, DTC provides a yucky

(Entering the thread at random, from my perspective)

Justification:  I'm a developer, people pay me lots of money to work
under MS-DOS and Windows to develop software for them.  The fact that
I prefer Linux makes no difference, they still want Windows software.

At least I managed to persuade them to use Linux for the
communications server.  (LOOK!  A _real_ application! - well, soon)

I tried that.  As soon as I fix my floppies, I have to put DOS back
on, so that I can develop some more.  I like getting paid.

True.  But _someone_ had to write the code in the first place, and if
it can be done one way, it can be done the other.  And, as has been
pointed out so many times before, if they have physical access to the
machine, there's really no sure protection.  They can always boot from
a boot floppy.

This isn't an issue.  If I can get to your Linux machine, I can get to
anything on the disk.  Insert MCC bootdisk/Slackware bootdisk/HLU's
bootdisk/SLS bootdisk, reboot, and WHAMMO!  Instant root access.
I can even fsck the disks if I want, just to be nice.

Remotely, Linux is (potentially) just as safe as any other UN*X.

ROFL!  Lucky you didn't turn the clock back (on both machines) or you
would be left with salad a-la-linux. :)

I went through a similar experience:

o On Monday, term was working fine.
o On Tuesday, term stops working.

What I did:

o Run term on both ends.  Didn't work.
o Run term on both ends again.  Didn't work.
o Give up.

Admittedly, I wasn't quite as thorough as you, but I acheived about as
much as you did. :)

Subject: mouse under VC?
Date: 6 Nov 93 07:41:34 GMT


        Greetings. [yuck] I'm using Telix (in messydos) and a tiny TSR
        that allows me to use the standard mouse to cut&paste in any 
        text application - and I was wondering how I would go about
        writing one for Linux... The mouse program that comes with X11
        works in text mode so I don't see why that wouldn't work. It
        would be nice to be able to cut&paste this way between VC's but
        I have no idea (or time) for that. Anyone have a program that
        does this? If not, I think it would VERY USEFUL to have this
        feature for Linux... 

        Take care.
        
        P.S. I had a documented problem (and someone even sent me a fix)
        that ls would barf if any file/subdirectory of the msdos fs had an 
        ascii character above 128 in it. I, of course, have a sys[Alt-251]op 
        directory on my msdos partition that is a 10MB tree - which I
        could not access because ls was ignoring it...

        Just wondering if that fix made it into the latest release?
