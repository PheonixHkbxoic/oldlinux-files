Well you can disable floppy booting, and password protect the CMOS setup
routine, so they have to resort to taking a screwdriver to the case and 
shorting out the CMOS info ;-)

One method of controlling access to files is to implement a login feature
in the 'LTOOLS' (for lack of a better name) package, which would work in
the same way as /bin/login - prompt the user for a password, encrypt it
and compare it against the entry in /etc/passwd.

This could be called whenever the user tries to access a protected file
(bit of an overhead), or once, the first time LTOOLS is called after a
reboot.

BTW, I had a go at implementing something like this a few months ago - the
resulting program is _very_ ugly (like 'compile-the-inode-into-the-program
ugly'), but it will allow you to read a file (once you know its inode ;-)
from an old extfs.  If anyone wants a copy I can email it to them...

IMHO its a problem with the non IEEE conformance of the default linux libs.
Please install libc-4.4.4 and use the -mieee-fp when linking. (Its documented
in to release notes.)

Then you shouldn't get any SIGFPE's any more.

Okay, okay, so I'm following up my own post %-&

I had some things to add...for those who asked, here's a quote from
the AFS manual in my office:

"Transarc and AFS are registered trademarks of Transarc Corporation".

That's all I noticed..there may be more, but I was in a hurry (one of
those days)....I think that's it, though.

Just in case one of my previous posts was missed, I noted that where I
work there are about 1000 NFS-mounted workstations accessing a couple 
dozen servers running AFS....doesn't seem like the translator is *that* bad.

>>The only people that appear to like AFS are system management folks, since

Other people who like AFS are the ones who like the ACLs, which are 
*completely* independent from unix file protections.  

And, one more time, to make sure everyone sees it:

 I think that before I go any further in this thread I have to state that I 
 got in this thread to answer some questions and offer a perspective based on
 my experience with AFS.  Though it might seem like it to you, I have no
 stake in the propagation of AFS.  I'm just a reasonably satisfied user.  I
 say 'reasonably' because I've yet to be completely satisfied with *any* 
 network, AFS, NFS, DecNet, you name it.

Are you sure ?
They (a company in the states, I don't remember their name, but a friend of mine
told me, yesterday) are still shipping the Linux CD-ROM including 386BSD !

They say: CD-ROM release "September 1993" !
On the CD-ROM there is talk about the "Tiny BSD" floppy, etc. pp.
So, my friend did ask me where to get this floppy disk, yesterday !
So, why did they put this DEAD OS on the CD-ROM ?
Just because there was space left on it ?
But, without trying to think about the other OS's like FreeBSD and NetBSD ?
I told my friend to keep-off of the 386BSD stuff on the disk. The problem is,
getting the other *BSD OS's is not as easy, yet, especially in Europe.

OK, I agree to remove the 386BSD stuff from agate... if the space is used
for the newer and much more stable versions of the OS's I mentioned above.
On the other hand, I am running 386BSD even without the latest patch kit
and have no problems. That's why I am still running it. I am doing
development with X11R5 now and I don't want to spend another week just to
get almost the same development environment back that I have now.

I will switch to FreeBSD or NetBSD whichever is around at the time I will do
the switch. For now, I can't decide whether I want better serial drivers
for my high-speed modem (pro FreeBSD) or use wabi (which might run on NetBSD,
first) and other BSD 4.4 related software (pro NetBSD).

Just my two cents worth to this strange series of articles.

I did use agate... in the past to get some files. Now, I won't use it anymore
to get files for 386BSD. Either I have all files I need or I will switch
to a newer OS.

Norbert.

There is a company in the UK distributing a single CD with 386BSD, NetBSD & Linux (v0.99.10)

the company is Takelap systems on 0291 650357 email info@ddrive.demon.co.uk

As for will BSD die, that really depends on how many people use it, i.e. us

Above could be the cause of the paging bug.  My case is that I run
Linux 0.99pl13 (standard kernel) with libc jump 4.4.2 on an Intel
386DX25 with 8 MB interleaved memory, no 387 & 10 MB swap.  Exercised the
machine hard with large back-ground C compiles, XFree86 1.3 running +
1 or 2 copies of Emacs 19.19A going (all at same time) a few times in
the last few weeks.  Have not noticed problems recompiling the kernel
in similar sort of situations with machine under load.

I would like to know if there is any faults in the above reasoning.

Hope this helps

Matthew

I suspect the problem is with the NET-2d(ebugged) code which has been
placed in the 0.99.13[a-p] kernels.  I have been experiencing this
problem every since I began testing Alan's modifications to the net
code.  I have yet to see rcp work correctly with the new net code.

The problem only seems to manifest itself between two versions of the
NET-2d(ebugged) code.  What appears to happen here is that the machine
from which files are being copied from hangs with the rcp -f command
stuck in the rcp_read routine.

I haven't had time to figure out exactly what is happening.  From what
I hear on the NET channel the tcp layer is somewhat in shambles.  I would
guess that this is where the problem is coming from.  There is talk about
the need for a complete re-write of the tcp layer, perhaps this will
ameliorate this problem.

I was hoping that someone else would address this problem.  It would appear
that 0.99.14 will be unusable for us if the net2d(ebugged) code is the
basis for the networking.  Luckily 0.99.13(stock) is meeting our needs
quite well.  Helpful hints and suggestions are always welcome.

I'm looking for a lock daemon. I've tried archie, and mainly located
a very large number of clocks :-)

Reason: I'm using PCNFS, and would like to share filespace. The only
sharing mechanism it knows is via a lock daemon, and the only
alternatives to sharing are to mount the filespace read-only (useless)
or without sharing (dangerous).

So - got source (or binaries - I'm desperate) to a lock daemon? The
only stuff I can find is in the form of patches or compiled Sun
binaries.

Any clues appreciated.

I got it (db-1.6.tar.gz), but I haven't tried it yet. I don't remember

If there exits any newer version or anyone it working on it I'd like

But isn't there a phone prefix you can type in to disable your call waiting?
If I remember it's *80 or *70 or something like that.  Seems a little easier
than righting a new term client.

I think this is one of the major features planned for SLAP, the
replacement for term.  Another feature is that you will be able to use
two modems for a single TCP/IP connection and get double the
throughput.

I haven't heard any news about when slap will be ready for testing.
