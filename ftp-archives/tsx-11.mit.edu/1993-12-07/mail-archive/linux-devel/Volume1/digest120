The ipc calls are now in libc. There is no longer a separate `libipc'.

The problem is not that there's no software. The problem is that vendors
typically don't say how to talk to the card on the I/O port level.

Given that information, people could write their own drivers and you don't
have to publish anything.

Further, what do you mean "your source code"? The code on the card? Not an
issue. The one for accessing the card from Unix? Would be neat to have,
but not absolutely necessary given I/O port level documentation. In fact,
I don't understand why you couldn't release that code since presumably
the code you want to keep proprietary is the firmware on the card.

It's not possible because your driver accesses kernel data structures and
routines which change name / size depending on the options the kernel is
compiled with, eg. C vs. C++.

I have to see this nonsense at work 8 hours a day. SSSTTTOOOPPP it. It's
simply bullshit.

You can give a simple error message, that should be enough. Why this idiotic
%EXTFS-E-EDSKTRSH text. I hate VMS for it.

This text is totaly obsolete.

Subject: Linux Slowly Dying Off?
Date: Thu, 23 Sep 93 15:50:08 GMT

I remember back to the days where a new SLS was comming out every three
weeks, the news groups were filled to the point of breaking with new 
updates and the project was full speed ahead.
  I hope not to start any crap (to put it mildly) with this, but I think
that we (you) have a great product going here and I don't want to see it
dying out.  I have introduced at least ten people to the Linux system and
they love it.  We wait patiently for a new update and quickly grab it.
We all also dab a little in fixing bugs, but times are tight.
  I hope that we can rejuvinate our love for the project and continue full
speed again!!! 

I believe that the Wine project is a great idea, and it will get many a DOS/
Windows user over to the Linux system.  I hope also the the dosemu project
will liven up a bit (160+ days since an update!?!?!?) since that will drag
the rest of my collegues over to the system (they can't live without their
Star Wars.)

Keep it goin' guys!!!!!

Sincerely,

From: jonb@specialix.com (Jon Brawn)
Subject: Intelligent Serial I/O: DIY
Date: Wed, 22 Sep 1993 22:02:32 GMT

I had an illuminating email exchange with Johan A. Grape at Dartmough College,
Hanover, NH.

The basic idea was that instead of trying to craft drivers for already existing
(expensive) intelligent I/O boards, why not design an intelligent I/O board
that uses easily (cheeply) available components, and have a linux device
driver for it covered by Copyleft?

What is an Intelligent I/O board?

Usually, a board with a processor and some RAM on it that is used to offload
some of the work from the host '386/486 processor. The code that the I/O
processor executes performs much of the common line discipline functionality,
sush as tab expansion and convertling line-feed to carriage-return,line-feed
pairs on output. Really good ones also perform input processing. They usually
have enormous buffers (compared to 8 or 12 character FIFOs).

Who would want to do this sort of work?

The design of the board could be undertaken as an EE project, and the driver
as a CS project. The aim would be to come up with a *cheep* solution rather
than the most technologically advanced solution (it would be hard to compete
with the RISC processor based solutions the big I/O vendors are using).

What sort of hardware is needed?

The sort of technology I had in mind is 16450/16550 UARTs, some RAM and an
Intel 80x86 processor (easy availability of development tools), possibly with
some LEDs for debugging purposes, on an ISA host card (yep, ISA has
sufficient bandwidth), arranged to give a dual-ported interface allowing
both the host '386/486 and the I/O processor access to the RAM and the UARTs.

What about the software?

Well, there are at least two pieces of software, the Linux device driver, and
the code that runs on the I/O processor.

At least two?

Yep, the third piece of software is a configuration/management tool (or set of
tools) that are used for a super-set of stty functionality (enabling the
marvelous [but non-standard] features of the board, locking settings etc.),
with possibly some rather nice program to help with configuring getty, uucp,
SLIP, and other delights, helping to reduce the number of ``Help! uugetty ate
my CPU'' type postings to the comp.os.linux.* groups.

There is also an installation issue - if the driver isn't included in the
normal kernel (but I don't see why it shouldn't be) then it will need some
installation software [and boy, am I glad I'm not writing it].

This has nothing to do with Linux.  You might want to ask the same
question in comp.std.c, and they will probably explain to you why it
is better to have the preprocessor work on tokens, not arbitrary text.

(The preprocessor used to work like you seem to want it, but even
before the standardization there were different approaches.  The
standard mandates the token-based approach.)

Simon:

The same problem occurred to me. It seems that the standard libc.a should 
have the ipc routines included; therefore; all you'd have to do is to remove 
the flag -lipc from the makefile at the location where the linking occurs (I 
think that this flag is somewhere in the LFLAGS definition, but I'm not 
sure).

For me, however, this didn't work. It did produce a program and shared 
library, but a defect one..  Sadly, I can only use dosemu with the old Linux 
version (pl10), where it has to be linked explicitely with a libipc.a.  The 
problems I have with pl12 is that Dosemu comes up, but that the keyboard is 
dead..  no matter which flags for dosemu itself (raw or not raw keyborad IO) 
are used.  The error log prints messages like, "shmget(): function not 
supported" etc..  

Any suggestions on this, how to make dosemu run with pl12? I'd be much 
obliged..

Karel.

I quite agree with this suggestion, although I'd use slithgly longer
prefixes ("Info:", "Warning:", and "ERROR:", perhaps).

What about making all merely informational bootup messages optional?
That would make the bootup screen less cluttered and it would be
easier to spot problems.

Well, I think that the total traffic of the col.* groups put together
is about the same as the old col, with maybe a little less noise.

But as for new SLS's often, you're confusing one _distribution_ with
the OS.  The Slackware distribution has been updated (to 1.03?  Or
some such) just recently.  The Debian release is soon to come, and I
think I saw a note about the upgrade of Tamu.

The kernel is still being enhanced -- pl12 is less than a month old
(out of alpha) and pl13 is in alpha.  The work on net stuff seems to
be proceeding.  Wine and Slap are going on "behind the scenes."
(Perhaps some of the traffic you're missing has moved to one of the
Channels..)

It's still going -- I really doubt that anything could hurt Linux at
this time, except an possibly the simultaneous destruction of all x86
chips in the world.  (Of course, there's the 68K port...)

I doubt any degree of development will allow me to run Xwing or Dune
II while I render in the background (At a decent speed for both.)
What we really need is people writing good shareware games to run
under Linux, using svgalib or the like.

(Anyone want to send lots of mail to people @idsoftware.com telling
them they should make DOOM run under Linux in a native fashion? :-)

But seriously -- Is anyone out there writing games for Linux?  Games
are the only thing that my DOS partition from becoming /usr2....
Surely something of at least the quality of Apogee's "sixteen colour
platform game, for the sixteenth time.  But we *did* change the
sprites" series of games is possible... 

(And just think:  In one year's time, CFV on comp.os.linux.games... It
should happen!!)

What's a computer for besides games?
