Subject: New Ultrastor 14/24/34 driver uploaded.
Date: Thu, 23 Sep 1993 18:16:53 GMT

        I have uploaded a new version of the [1,2,3]4f Ultrastor driver to
tsx-11 in pub/linux/ALPHA/scsi.  The file is called ultrastor-1.11c.tar.z.
There have been a few changes and bugfixes - the most difference is that
Caleb Epstein reports that the 24f now works reliably, where previously under
the same conditions the kernel would die a horrible death.  Also, there is no
longer a separate version of scsi.[c,h], or hosts.[c,h], and this should drop
right in to 0.99pl13.  It will probably drop into pl12 and maybe even pl11.

        I would like people to try this and ensure that it actually works
properly.  Caleb and I have both made some minor changes while away from our
Linux boxes, and in theory there could be problems, but this is unlikely.  It
is especially important for people with the 14f and 34f to try this and make
sure that everything is stable because this version will go into the
distribution kernel if no one reports any problems.

Subject: ISO: Ultra 34F SCSI driver for SCO UNIX 2.0v2
Date: Thu, 23 Sep 1993 18:41:27 GMT


I have a Tri-Star 486 DX66 ISA VLbus machine with an
Ultrastor 34F SCSI controller.  I want to install SCO UNIX 2.0v2 on it
but Ultrastor only has a driver for SCO UNIX 2.0v4.  I was going
to see if their Ultrastor 14F driver for SCO UNIX 2.0v2 would work
but they said it would not work because that version of the
14F driver relies on the WD emulation which the 34F does not have.

Has anyone written a Ultrastor 34F device driver for SCO UNIX they 
would be willing to share?  Even if it is not for 2.0v2, it might
be easily adaptable for 2.0v2 (I imagine it would be fairly simple
to adapt Ultrastor's 2.0v4 drvier but they will not give me a
copy of their source code :(, only the specs on their driver).
Maybe one of the Linux 34F driver developers has also worked 
with SCO UNIX?

Has anyone written any kind of SCSI host adapter driver for SCO
UNIX?  Can you give me an idea as to how difficult a task it is?

It's not dying off... not at all. It's simply stabilizing. Things aren't
changing as rapidly, which is a sign of maturity.

Believe me, we're running at 105% maximum warp, captain, and I'm not sure
that this ship can take any more.

Granted, there are some projects that have fallen by the wayside, but I don't
see that as a general trend.

These type of issues have been already taken care of by the syslog
mechanism.  Perhaps we could add a severity field to printk so that
the interface between the kernel and syslogd can be more useful.

Subject: Qtronix tape drive problems
Date: 22 Sep 1993 21:44:48 GMT

I'm trying to get a Qtronix TDB-250F QIC-80 tape drive to work with
linux. Kernel is 0.99.12, the ftape-0.9.6 with the accompanying
modules package is installed. When trying
mt -f /dev/ftape rewind

the results are like this:

ftape-io.c (_ftape_open) - drive wake-up method: Colorado DJ-10.
ftape-io.c (ftape_report_operation) - timeout on Acknowledge.
ftape-io.c (ftape_report_operation) - timeout on Acknowledge.
ftape-io.c (ftape_report_operation) - timeout on Acknowledge.
(...hundreds of these)
ftape-io.c (_ftape_open) - report_error_code failed.
ftape-rw.c (ftape_flush_buffers) - flushing write buffers.
ftape-io.c (_ftape_close) - calling ftape_abort_operation.
ftape-io.c (_ftape_close) - rewinding tape.
ftape-io.c (ftape_report_operation) - timeout on Acknowledge.
ftape-io.c (_ftape_close) - disabling drive.

During all this the drive whirs back and forth.

So no "unknown drive type" or "unknown vendor id". Any suggestions
about what could be wrong?

When I call a function from gdb, I always get

        writing register number 10(0): I/O error.
        Unable to restore previously selected frame.

This is with pl12 and either gdb 4.8 and 4.10.pl1.

I hear that the problem does not exist with pl11.

Does this happen to anyone else?

You did remember to enable the ipc stuff from /etc/rc, didn't you? If not,
get the latest ipc patches as they inlclude docs and the ipcs program.

I'm working on it. What it is is a text-mode window library that supports
colors and exotic keys (ALT keys and Function keys). Curses was way too 
primative for the display layer, so I had to write my own library which
takes advantage of today's modern consoles (but still supports the old
dumb terminals).

One of the things lacking is mouse support, but I was planning on doing
exactly what you have already done; i.e. use the xterm mouse tracking
method. I will be looking very closely at your work.

As a method of testing this windowing library, I am also developing a nifty
system administration tool that everyone has been complaining Linux needs. It
is lightly based on the SMIT utility found on AIX, but much prettier.

Keep your eyes peeled here for future announcements as I progress. 
Unfortunately, the amount of time I have to spend on Linux work is small.

I believe there is a *free* manual, but it's from Motorola, and it only covers
the MPC-601 processor, not the entire PowerPC system.  

It gives tech details, instruction sets, timing diagrams, pinouts, etc for 
(hopefully?) those wishing to (dirty word, ahead) clone the MPC-601?  At the
very least it should give _more_ than enough detail for programming the low
levels of the processor.  

Now for the rest of the system, guess it's back to big blue... :(

        /conf is a mistake.  If all the binaries are moved out of /etc
into /bin and /sbin, depending upon what they are (as is a standard unix
practice these days) then that leaves /etc with... guess what.  Config
files.  Since /conf and /etc now have identical contents, it makes little
to no sense to have both.  If one should be eliminated, then, IMHO, for
lack of any better reason, why not keep the one that is used on every unix
system out there, instead of the one that's new and unknown?

        BTW, this issue has been addressed at length on the linux FSSTND

        /conf actually makes this HARDER in an NFS environment.  Think about
it.  If you NFS mount a package (X11, say) should you have to keep separate
copies of the default twmrc and xinitrc on every single system's root
partition?  Now, Xconfig is a special file, it has hardware dependencies in
it, and NEEDS to be kept separate.  But the software configuration files
don't.  Configuration files should be kept in directories with the packages
that they go with, so that when you mount the package you get the config
file at the same time.
