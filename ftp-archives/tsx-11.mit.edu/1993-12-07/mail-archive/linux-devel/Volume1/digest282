The Mac has much more than "just a set of guidelines".  It also has a set
of toolkits and standard resources that the guidelines refer to.  The
guidelines don't say, "put this kind of shading on the title bar of a
window"; they say to use one of the standard window types, and the Window
Manager automatically puts the usual shading on.  The application doesn't
have to draw pull-down menus; this is handled automatically by the system,
so all menus look the same.

These toolkits are analogous to the UI libraries that are in use in X and
MS-Windows programming.  Unless you make it relatively easy for programmers
to follow the guidelines, you'll never get uniformity.

The command "tunelp" does that.
I found it in ~/sources/sbin/tunelp-1.0.tar.z  on major mirror sites:


tunelp(8)          Linux Programmer's Manual            tunelp(8)

NAME
       tunelp - set various parameters for the lp device

SYNOPSIS
       tunelp  <device> [-i IRQ | -t TIME | -c CHARS | -w WAIT |
       -a [on|off]]

Yes, and I agree with this approach.  It is the only sensible
way to do things; when adding any new feature you have to
consider the cost of coding it versus the benefit (number of
users * what each gains).

All I'd like to see is the XFree86 team dealing with OS
variations the same way they deal with hardware variations.

I am sorry for this mistake; I had (mis)read 05/93 for the release of
1.2.0, and 03/93 for the announcement of COSE. This looked highly
suspicious... :-) But in fact 1.2.0 was out in 05/92. Too bad. It looked
like a nice conspiracy theory.

I am still very curious as to what possessed OSF to impose runtime
library royalties (from somebody, not necessarily the developer) when
1.2.0 was released.

Nowadays runtime library royalties of any sort are really, really rare;
not even considering the good example set by Sun who _donated_ the XView
source, I am still hard pressed to think of any major library, under
_any_ popular OS, that requires a runtime binary royalty from _anybody_.

Somebody mentioned Microsoft Cobol. Well, I am impressed. :-)

Hi folks,

I just runned  0.99pl14 + ext2fs-0.4 and lost the contens of at leat
one ext2fs filesystem directory. 

Here my history:
cd pov
ls
cd sources 
ls
emacs Makefile
CTRL-Z
man gcc
fg
(in emacs make -k with unspez. errors)
("  "     exit emacs with CTRL-x CTRL-c) 
ls
(and the dir sources was empty)

running e2fsck could not get any wiped out files back.

Because I have a lot too lose, I synced and booted the more stable 0.99pl13r.

Happy fixing ----- Gero.

...or running with a card-vendor-supplied driver which only provides Workplace

Dear sir, perhaps it would be interesting to note that free sw authors
make their sw free instead of proprietary sw they enjoy having their
creations as widely used and distributed as possible.

Given this rather reasonable assumption, many free sw authors would
rather, if at all possible, avoid restricting usage of their sw only to
those that have licensed a proprietary library.

As of now a free sw author doing a Motif dependant program restricts the
use of his program to those that have bought Motif in one way or
another; distribution of binaries, which are a very convenient form of
free sw distribution, and used to be possible without exceptions under
1.1.x, has become rather risky for all those involved.

Frankly a lot of free sw authors, e.g. those in the US government, or
many of those at Universities, develop free sw full time.

Given this, and that in any case widespread adoption is a goal of many
free sw authors, warning them that by using Motif they seriously
restrict the popularity of their sw is useful. Making free sw depend on
proprietary technology is something that should be avoided, if
feasible. The ultimate judge of this is the author: to them to balance
the various issues. (besides OSF/Motif is, according to many, a poorly
done thing, and things like Tcl are also more interesting and a "better"
learning experience).

It is my concern that any prospective free sw author know the
consequences of using OSF/Motif; since runtime binary royalties is a
practice that has all but disappeared in recent years, I had myself not
even imagined that OSF/Motif requires them in many/most cases.

I was rather startled to learn of this, especially as this was
introduced as of release 1.2.x; I had even misread the date for the
release of 1.2.x as 93 instead of 92, when I looked it up, as I was
under the misconception that this was a rather recent development. Some
other people, who develop Motif applications routinely, were also
startled, 18 months after to fact, to realize that OSF had changed their
policy.

So, I am not trying to make the free sw authors work harder for me; I am
trying to make it very clear that if for whatever reason they choose
Motif a significant segment of their potential audience will not enjoy
their creations (until Notif is ready, if ever). To them the choice.

   Does any body know what effect deselecting a printer (by pressing the

This is *implementation defined*.

   This is my gut feeling as well. This means I don't get any messages when
   the printer is off line. Any body got some hard documentation?

on-line/off-line gets interpreted differently by different vendors, as
far as I can tell.

   (My printer is an OKI Microline 380 - the manual says about the fault
   line: 'When the paper end is detected, this signal changes from high to
   low level.' This seems to be exactly what happens.)
   ( For kernel hackers: the culprit is line 143 of lp.c - to make it work
   for me I just add a check for LP_PSELECD as well.)

The problem with all the error detection is that some printers do one
thing, and some another.  It's rather annoying.  I tried to come up
with a sane set of errors when I was re-writing the printer driver,
but no matter what I did, some beta tester had problems with it.  I
finally left it like it is, with the option to abort or not abort on
error.  I'll try to remember to take another look at this code and see
if I see a better way about it now, but I can't promise anything.
It's gotta work on everything...

Should I add another ioctl for doing something when the printer goes
off-line?  Mail me with your suggestions...
