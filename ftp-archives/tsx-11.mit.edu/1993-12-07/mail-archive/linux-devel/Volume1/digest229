Date: 15 Nov 1993 18:11:46 GMT

Hi,

I am working on a simple project, and I need to turn the terminal in raw
mode for a few lines of code.  I'd like to do this from inside my code,
rather than from a system(stty raw) call.

I was trying to use "stty(1, tty_settings)" (where tty_settings is type
struct sgttyb), but I haven't had much success with it.  I found the
needed structure in <bsd/sgtty.h>, but I haven't found the actual stty
and gtty function calls.  On my Ultrix box, they're in <sgtty.h>.

Does anyone know how I can perform the equivalent "stty" and "gtty"
calls without shelling to the system?  (Perhaps an ioctl?)  Any help
is much appreciated!  (Oh, I know about curses, but I want to use that
as a 2nd to last resort -- last being "system (stty raw)".)

Date: Mon, 15 Nov 1993 18:52:47 GMT


Hi,

I have one of the many mice from clone makers that can emulate Microsoft or
Logitech. It has 3 buttons for Logitech mode, but default mode is Microsoft
and drivers don't recognize the middle button. 
cat /dev/mouse proves that the middle button does generate something even in
Microsoft mode, so it should be trivial to modify the driver. Before I do it I
would like to know if someone has done it already.

I can't seem to compile 0.99.13 with the 2.5.2 gcc that came
with the slackware release.

I get something to the effect of "conflicting definitions of panic".

Is this a problem with the old version of 0.99.13 (release), not 0.99.13r
or anything, or a setup problem, or what.  Or is this problem unique?

Apologies if this is a FAQ.
(Oh.  I also tried it with the new version announced on the GCC channel.
After putting stdarg.h back in the includes, I got the same problem).

Please email me at neudorf@piapot.usask.ca, so as not to flood the group.

Subject: How do YOU have TERM set up?
Date: Mon, 15 Nov 1993 20:39:21 GMT

Well, I finally got Linux working on my machine. Now, I'd like to set up term.
I played around with it a bit, and was reading the man pages, and realized how
easy it seems to be for people to clobber your personal machine if you allow
logins from the world at large. So, I was wondering how other people have set
term up to work for themselves. If I get enough information, I'll see if I can
set up a TERM-HOWTO to go with the other HOWTO's. To that end, I would ask if
people tell me not only how they set term up on their machines, but why they
chose their setup, and what benefits/problems they've noticed with it.

Also, I'd like to know if anybody has managed to set up term so that it is
virtually transparent on their machine (ie - you can ftp, telnet, e-mail, read
news, etc through the term link).

I am hoping to be able to put together a package, or set of documentation, to
make this procedure easier for everyone. If such a package already exists, I
have not found it yet. And I apologize if it does exist, and I'm wasting
everyone's time.

Anyway, let's go to it! E-mail responses to the address in my .Sig.

Hi,

you could use the ioctl functions:

ioctl(fildes, TIOCSETP, argp)

instead of stty(fildes, argp)
and

ioctl(fildes, TIOCGETP, argp)

instead of gtty(fildes, argp)

There is no "right" window manager.  

The window manager I happen to use is fvwm, which I hacked so it would
accept the token "NoDecorations" in the rc file. 

It just so happens that Motif runs as well with fvwm as with any other
window manager.  It was designed by people who run mwm, but any other
manager will work.

Nope. It's because the GCC 2.5.x compilers have become more strict about
the use of "volatile". For a couple of reasons (including this one), I've
decided to drop back to gcc/g++/objc 2.4.5 as the standard compilers for
Slackware. I had no problems with them, and only upgraded because several
users had expressed interest in the new 'long double' type provided in
the 2.5.x compilers. I will continue to keep the new compilers available in
another directory for those who want to use them.

Another factor that influenced this decision is that libg++-2.5.1
apparently shouldn't be compiled with libc.4.4.4, and g++ 2.5.x shouldn't
be used with libg++-2.4. 

I did get 0.99pl13r to compile with gcc 2.5.2, though. You need to make it
use the other format in the header (there's a conditional for the 'panic'
define).

        A stub will appear in pl14.  It will not do anything, but you can take
it as meaning that ultimately someone will probably get around to adding it.

        No this is fairly old information.  Linux now currently loads all
ZMAGIC binaries and shared libraries through the mmap interface.  Currently you
cannot have MAP_SHARED and PROT_WRITE on the same page, but someone is working
on this.

Surely you remember that old saying:

        C combines the Power of Assembler Language
        with the Ease of Use of Assembler Language.

Actually, even Pascal (or Modula-2) would be a better commercial
language than C.  Also, never discount Business BASIC interpreters.
For instance, a Business BASIC (for example Thoroughbred's) supports
a 4GL (IDOL-IV) with a procedural language that looks an _awful_
lot like COBOL.  If SCRIPT-IV won't do the job, you can always
downshift to BASIC.

Of course, getting Thoroughbred to do the port may be a little difficult.

        Hi, I just received my BusLogic BT-747S.  So far, I have only
gotten it to work under the AHA-1542 driver in the kernel, and it
doesn't seem to work when I have only AHA-1740 support compiled in.  As
far as I know, the driver for 1542 probably isn't taking full advantage
of the EISA speed (10-33 Mbits/sec!!!), so is there a possibility to
hack the existing driver for one that takes full advantage of BusLogic
card?

thanks,

Pleeaase, someone do this!!! You could make me (and probably some other
people) very happy when enabling to use Texas on Lunux!

I've rewritten some library classes (collections and a string class) to
be useable with Texas. In combination with our Xm++ it is an ideal
development environment!! I'm currently writing a lot of small
applications and everything runs great - but only on SUNs... :-(.

I already posted a call for help in this topic when starting with Texas
a couple of months ago. But my projects eat up > 100% of my time so I
couldn't join the Linux-Activists to learn about kernel development - how
it was supposed by most of the replies.
Maybe this time the article is read by / forwarded to a kind person who
is already familar with the kernel....

Subject: rawrite.exe is too slow
Date: 16 Nov 93 10:54:47
Reply-To: Ulrich Windl <c9524@rrzc1.rz.uni-regensburg.de>

Yesterday I made a Linux boot disk (my first). I noticed that rawrite is
quite slow; it also requires that the destination disk is formatted.

There's a program (written by me) called D2D (disk-to-disk copy) taht can be
found on garbo.uwasa.fi and its mirrors. The directory is /pc/demo for some
mysterious reason (should be /pc/diskcopy). My program work similar to
rawrite.exe, but it can format disks, and it is faster.

Short description of the required steps:
1) Initial creation of the correct image
 - create a Linux boot disk
 - create a comment in let's say "c:\boot.txt"
 - use "d2d A: C:\A1-3inch.d2d /c@c:\boot.txt /b1.4M" to create an image of
   the boot disk with a comment in it.
2) Make your boot disks (it's best to make a lot of them (say 3))
 - use "d2d c:\a1-3inch.d2d a: /3 /vs" to create 3 boot disks. "/vs" makes
   a smart verify (either (format and verify, write) or (write, verify)).
   Formatting will happen if it is required. You will be prompted before
   overwriting DOS disks. You may insert a subsitute for bad disks.
3) It's thinkable to distribute Lunux file systems via images (one disk at a
   time)
Enjoy!

I've found a bug in the init program of the Linux boot disk:
Once if you have called "init" (without arg), you can never call init with

Of course not a very serious bug, but there must be something wrong...

Well, i think the point of rawrite is to be able to create disks from
images obtained by using the standard Unix "dd" command.  Besides, why
would you ever need rawrite after the first installation of Linux? :)
