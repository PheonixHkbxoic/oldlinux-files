No (and you have most-likely already been through this), don't use Motif for
anything...It's

        - Ugly
        - Slow
        - Difficult (read impossible) to program
        - Licensed

Why
        - Does there need to be a workstation interface "standard" ?
        - Does it need to be Motif (as it seems to be by default)

Maybe I'm just stupid for not buying into OSF's plan (and what's so
"open" about them anyway?)

Just waiting for GNU to come out with an interface spec... :-)

We're trying to set up a cluster of PC running Linux here at the
University. We started out with SLS 1.03, and have upgraded the kernel
to 0.99.13s, libc to 4.4.4, and installed the binaries from the
yp-linux package (the lib-source in yp-linux seems to have been folded
into libc by now). gcc is 2.4.5.

Okay, so things are working great for an hour or so. Then we get
things like:

> bash$ ypmatch kjetilho passwd
> yp_match: clnt_call: RPC: Timed out
> clntudp_create: RPC: Port mapper failure - RPC: Timed out

NFS still works. ypbind is running, and gets answered every minute by
the NIS-server. ypwhich works correctly.

However, portmapper produces a lot of zombies (we've mostly tried
/etc/portmap, not /etc/rpc.portmap, but the latter has not been any
better).

I've tried to kill all net-related processes, rm /var/yp/binding/* and
restarting them (ie. portmap, inetd, named, ypbind - almost anything
except init and getty :-)

I've looked at NYS, but it isn't near a finished state. Peter Erikson
suggested I replaced yp-linux code (partially) with NYS, but this
isn't trivial, so that would be my absolutely last option.

So... Are anyone using NIS on their Linux-machines? Any clues to
offer?

I'm still fuzzy on one thing with BIOS/Windows drivers vs. XFree86 drivers.
I understand the part about how the guy who writes the BIOS driver knows
everything about the video card.  What I don't get is how he knows about the
monitor which is connected to that card.  After all, what we're really 
talking about here is blowing up a monitor.  So these BIOS modes/Windows
drivers, do they just set the video timing for the lowest common denominator
for a given mode (i.e., 640x480 @ 60hz) or is there some way that they can
detect that the monitor can do 640x480 @ 72hz?  If they're just setting the
lowest common denominator, why don't the people who want to make easy X
installations just write a simple script that checks how much video ram the
user has on his machine, and based on that, offers him a choice of the 
standard modes (i.e. 640x480, 800x600 & 1024x768 for 1M), then spits out an 
Xconfig for that mode, using the lowest common timing parameters.  People
who know what they are doing can always compute better modes for themselves.
Or am I still missing something?

It's false to assume that sufficient information is available to do

PS/1, typically comes with ABSOLUTELY NO TECHNICAL INFORMATION/SPECS AT ALL!!!

The only way I was able to get it running XFree86 at all was to assume that
because the label on the monitor said it was built in Korea,  that maybe
it was a Samsung monitor, and the Samsung numbers from modeDB.txt

The human readable version is non-binding (legalese for "I could not
care less") and in any case it is rather complicated in itself. There
are many cases, and the differences in wording among the cases are
subtle, and so on, even in the human-readable license. FUD is not

Anything that the market will bear is *fair*. It is however curious to
observe that:

        1) I cannot remember any other major library that requires
           runtime license fees at all, ever. If you link an application
           with any USL/Sun/Microsoft/Borland/whatever library there is
           absolutely no need for neither the developer nor the user to
           pay a runtime license fee, or to check complicated legal
           documents for circumstances where the fee may not need to
           be paid twice.

        2) No runtime license fees were due for statically linked
           binaries, up to and including version 1.1.x even if for some
           strange reason the OSF made and still makes a distinction
           between dynamic and static libraries, even in 1.1.x, but
           given the option of static libraries, it was not so
           important.

        3) The rather extraordinary requirement for runtime library
           royalties on each machine running an OSF Motif application
           has been introduced with 1.2x, just about at the same time
           COSE adopted Motif and OSF found themselves with no
           significant competition, Sun and AT&T being vanquished.
           
p> Summing up, life's too short to bother using OSF Motif for free sw.

Mike> If the intention is to give away multiple use of something thats
Mike> not yours for no renumeration to the owner it certainly is...

This is disingenuous hypochrisy: I am not arguing that OSF's
intellectual property should be in any way misappropriated by free sw
developers. Insinuating that any such intention exists is just slimy.

What I am advocating is exactly the opposite: I am arguing that the best
attitude to OSF's intellectual property is not to bother with it, which
is the safest way to avoid any possible infringement on their new and
rather complicated and extraordinary license terms, on the part of both
free sw developers and free sw users.

A good argument has been raised that NCSA are infringing on their
educational OSF license by not advising or requiring their users to pay
OSF a runtime library royalty, if they haven't already, before _running_
NCSA Mosaic. Amazing subtlety. NCSA has mainly targeted workstations
whose vendors have got platform licenses from OSF, so they are
relatively safe there.

I note that every other library vendor that I know is happy enough with
royalties on software developer's kits, not on runtime library bits and
pieces incorporated in products. They have no problem with developers
giving away multiple use of something that's not yours.

The OSF has a different policy? Their privilege. Nobody has any
intention to steal anything from the OSF. Just forget about them and
their curiously timed new license restrictions.

Mike> If you were a commercial vendor you would have or purcase from a

One interesting aspect of things not mentioned in some draft I have seen
of the human readable version of the Motif license term is the _price_
of the various license alternatives. In particular the price of an FD
license and the royalty fees. I understand that the prices are rather
interesting.

In particular, given that as you say a commercial sw developer has now
to get an FD license to distribute products if he switches from 1.1.x to
1.2.x, the adoption of Motif by COSE has perhpas been celebrated by the
OSF with what amounts to a very, very steep increase (something trivial
like 2 orders of magnitude) in the real price of a Motif SDK.

Gcc 2.5.5 has been released. But my binaries require libc 4.5.x, which

gcc 2.5.5 and libc 4.5.4 in two days or so. If you are on the bleeding

        Ahhh, but here is the rub. OSF now has a MONOPOLY on THE GUI for
        UNIX based systems. There is no other alternative now that
        OpenLook has been defeated. If you want to sell a product in
        to the UNIX(tm) market you MUST use OSF Motif L&F, you have NO
        other choice. Historically MONOPOLYS are usually bad news for
        everyone except the MONOPOLY itself. This is the real issue here.

        Until there is another source for the L&F which the industry has
        deemed necessary for UNIX products you are stuck in the traditional
        proprietary trap. Not surprising since the founders of OSF were
        masters of proprietary entrapment of end users... B^(.

        Hopefully a Free implementation of the L&F will come out in the
        near future to provide a "balance of terror" so to speak against
        OSF's wild and wacky licensing.

        I still can't believe the industry was suckered in to swallowing a
        proprietary L&F for something as fundemental as a user interface. B^(.

        OSF must have borrowed Micro$oft's marketing dept. for this...

Subject: Definitive OSF Motif Licensing Terms
Date: 29 Nov 1993 19:19:04 GMT


Hello Everyone.

Over the past couple of weeks, I've seen an enormous volume of 
mis-information regarding OSF/Motif's Release 1.2 licensing terms and 
royalty requirements on the network.  I am posting this to reiterate the 
actual Release 1.2 licensing policies and correct the misinformation.  It's 
in layman's terms.  (Any discrepancies between this message and the license 
agreement are unintentional; the license remains the final authority.) 

This posting is long because Motif is being used by lots of different kinds 
of developers under a variety of licensing circumstances.  I invite anyone 
with issues, questions, or problems concerning licensing to contact me 
directly at crow@osf.org.  I will also be happy to ship to anyone who sends 
me their snail-mail address a full copy of the OSF/Motif Release 1.2 
License and a summary sheet that explains the key points of the License 
agreement in non-lawyer language.  

It is critical for Software Developers to clearly understand their 
available options in developing applications and system tools using 
OSF/Motif Release 1.2 and beyond.  With this posting, I will review the 
options Software Developers have in delivering their Motif-based 
applications, license requirements and when royalties are and are not due 
OSF.  All of the comments below are pertinent to OSF/Motif Rel 1.2 and 
beyond (if you have questions on earlier Motif releases call me).  The 
terms described below are not new, but have been true since the 
introduction of Release 1.2 nearly two years ago.

For purposes of this discussion, the working definition of a "Runtime Copy" 
of Motif means any subset of routines from the "libXm" or "libMrm" library 
files in object code form statically linked within an application program 
and executable only with that single application.  If you use any other 
portion of Motif or dynamically link these library files in object code 
form to the application program then you are not using a Runtime Copy of 
Motif.

End User Options
================

End users of applications that bind in a Runtime Copy of Motif should 
follow the terms of their licenses with the suppliers of those 
applications.  If a prerequisite Motif license is necessary, then an 
application developer is required to put that in their terms with you.  If 
you are required to obtain a Motif license prior to your use of a 
particular application, then please contact a Motif software supplier.


Software Developer Options
==========================

Here are the options Software Developers have, depending upon how they've 
licensed OSF/Motif.

1) The Software Developer uses a copy of Motif to develop the application   
   and ships only the application code without Motif code.  The assumption 
   is that there is already a Motif shared library on the target system 
   with which the application can run.
    
     License Reqs.:     No source code license required.
                        Object code license required, at a minimum.
     Royalty impact:    No royalties are required from the developer because 
                        no actual Motif code is shipping with the 
                        application.

2) The Software Developer statically binds in the Motif "Runtime Copy" (as 
   defined in the license supplement).  Applications are shipped with Motif 
   "Runtime Copies".

  There are three variants:

  A. Developer is Not a Source Code Licensee of OSF/Motif.

     License Reqs.:     This is by far the most common method of 
                        distributing OSF/Motif based applications.  The 
                        developer has licensed an object code copy of Motif 
                        from an OSF/Motif Full Distribution licensee.  The 
                        application distributed by the developer may be 
                        installed on any system, whether or not the system 
                        already has a Motif license.  
     Royalty Reqs.:     No royalties will be due OSF in this instance.

  B. Developer is a Full Distribution Rights Licensee of OSF/Motif or has a 
     University Site License.  

     License Reqs.:     The application distributed by the licensee 
                        (developer) may be installed on any system, 
                        whether or not the system already has a Motif 
                        license.  
     Royalty Reqs.:     No royalties will be due OSF in this instance.


  C. Developer is a Limited Distribution Rights Licensee of Motif. 

     License Reqs.:     (i)  Licensee may only install the application on 
                        internal systems that are already licensed for 
                        Motif.  In the event that the application is 
                        installed on an internal system that is not 
                        licensed for Motif, then Licensee must license that 
                        system for Motif and pay OSF the appropriate object 
                        code royalty under their Limited Distribution Rights 
                        License.  
                        (ii) Also, whenever licensee distributes their 
                        application externally with the Motif Runtime Copy,  
                        licensee must require that the purchaser install 
                        the application only on Motif licensed systems.  
                        This requirement must be clearly indicated on the 
                        application software license and packaging.  The 
                        Software Developer owes no royalties to OSF 
                        themselves, however the end user may be required to 
                        obtain a license from a Motif software supplier 
                        (and that supplier would then owe OSF a royalty).  The 
                        Motif license is the responsibility of the end user 
                        of these applications.
     Royalty Reqs.:     There are no royalties due OSF for the Runtime Copies 
                        themselves, but a Motif object code license (at any 
                        release level) must be paid for each system on which 
                        the application runs.  
                        Under item i, licensee must license a copy of 
                        Motif for each internal system that is not already 
                        licensed for Motif. They can do this under their own 
                        Limited Distribution Rights license, or by purchasing 
                        a license from a Motif software supplier.  
                        Under item ii, if the End User system is not already 
                        licensed, then the End User must purchase a Motif 
                        license from a Motif software supplier.

3. The Software Developer ships a royalty-bearing copy of Motif with their   
   application (essentially anything that falls outside the "Runtime Copy" 
   definition in the license supplement).  

   Again, there are three variants:

   A. Software Developer is Not a Source Code Licensee of OSF/Motif.
 
    License Reqs.:     The developer has licensed an object code copy of 
                        Motif from an OSF/Motif Full Distribution licensee.  
                        The application distributed with a royalty-bearing 
                        copy of Motif by the developer may be installed to 
                        any system, provided that the developer's Motif 
                        object code license with their Motif supplier allows 
                        it.  
    Royalty Reqs.:     Royalties are due OSF in this instance.  The 
                        OSF/Motif Full Distribution licensee (supplier) who 
                        licensed Motif to the Software Developer pays OSF.  
                        The supplier's terms with the Software Developer 
                        determines what the Software Developer, in turn, 
                        pays the supplier.

  B. Software Developer is a Full Distribution Rights Licensee of 
     OSF/Motif.  

     License Reqs.:     OSF/Motif Full Distribution rights are required only 
                        if object code copies are shipped EXTERNALLY.  A 
                        Limited Distribution or University source license is 
                        adequate for INTERNAL use or INTERNAL distribution 
                        of royalty-bearing copies.
     Royalty Reqs.:     An object code royalty is due for each of these copies 
                        of Motif.  The royalty rate will be based on the 
                        volume options selected by the licensee 
                        (developer).

  C. Developer is a Limited Distribution Rights Licensee of Motif or has a 
     University Site License. 

     License Status:    The developer may only distribute INTERNALLY 
                        royalty-bearing copies of Motif.  
     Royalty Reqs.:     An object code royalty is due for each of these copies 
                        of Motif.  The royalty rate will be based on the 
                        volume options selected by the licensee 
                        (developer).


One more note: If developers have multiple object code copies of Motif from 
different sources, then the license terms under which a Motif object code 
copy was created apply to that copy and only to that copy.

Again, I invite anyone with issues, questions, or problems concerning 
licensing to contact me directly.

I wouldn't have noticed unless you mentioned, but indeed the same happens
on my machine...
