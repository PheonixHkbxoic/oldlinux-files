Yes, but comparisons like this are useless, becuase, though washing
machines do run at different speeds, how fast your washing machine
cleans the clothes varies depending on the load and what kind of
clothes you want cleaned. The MIPS (Million Insoluble Particles per
Second) removal rate is different between dark and light loads, hot
and cold wash, hard and soft water, etc. So let's not get silly , ok? :-)

Big Flame Thrower on :-)

Check out SimCity Demo for what tcl/tk is capable of.
BTW: At work I developed a mini network management platform all based
in tcl/tk/snmp/expect and it works like a charm.

I say that is far easier to develop X oriented apps using tk than
Motif and save an order of magnitute of develpment time and
size of the application.

Subject: Linux and Mach 3.0
Date: Mon, 22 Nov 1993 18:36:44 GMT

Hi there!

        I'd like to know if there are people interested in porting Linux on
Mach 3.0 and, if we succeed in porting Linux to Mach 3.0, if there would be
people who would be interested in using it.

        I know the idea is not new. (Although I don't remember having seen
any discussion on that in the news.) I ask those questions in order to
create a development team to work on the project and to be sure it won't be
useless to work on that project.

        Now, on the philosophical side. I know that Linux on Mach would be
slower than Linux alone. IMHO, microkernels are the next step in OS
egineering and I don't think IBM, Apple, USL, Chorus... would spend so much
money on them if it wouldn't be important. Moreover, multiprocessor systems
will be more and more common in the future and by porting Linux to Mach we
would gain multiprocessing capability. It would be also possible to run
Linux and other OSes a the same time. (Yes, I know it would require some
kind of synchronisation between the OSes). 

        BTW, if there is no interest in that project, I will still try to
make Mach 3.0 boot and install a server. If I succeed, I will volunteer to
help finishing Hurd.

I configured my CTX 1561 multisync monitor on Friday night. By
saturday morning, my monitor was dead. Something caused it to keep
popping the fuse. 

I *WON'T* use the Xconfig.1M file when my replacement monitor arrives.

Do you take it seriously enough to not piss off those people who are

I read this as "We [academic institution without profit intention
behind - or correct me if I'm wrong] are mainly interested in support
for the broadest user base of *commercial* systems." Surprise...

But what really makes the reader sad and angry is the following "and
those people who don't want to buy Motif are, anyway, better off with
DOS and Windows." Has this Windocentristic narrow-mindedness already
hit academia?

You may be right a thousand times [which can well be doubted], but
this doesn't excuse the "justification" given above. NCSA is making
excellent products and your , but don't tell me that if I'm just a
poor student with an old 386 and no extra $$$ to spend on software the
right thing for me is MSWindoze.

I read in a german newsgroup from Dirk Hohndel, that even 
multisync monitors could be affected, because not all models
check the frequency first.

Hi

I'm also interested in this (DECnet and Linux). I've very limited knowledge
about it, so if there's someone who knows more, plese share with us.
The problems I know of :
        1. Eth addr : DECnet (Pathworks for DOS at least) modifies the card's
        eth addr, while Linux NET code uses the hardwired one. For this reason
        (seems to me) that DECnet and tcpip CANNOT run simultaneously on the
        same card.
        2. multicast addr : DECnet uses it, but unimplemented in actual NET
        code (as I know)

So its impossible without a major change in networking kernel code...
But if there's development on this, please let me know

Not to be flippant since I use free software regularly, but what exactly does
anyone lose by "piss[ing] off those people who are interested in *free*
software"?  Free software doesn't provide employment, and maybe that isn't a
problem for you, but there are lots of unemployed people here who have other
things to do than write software on their own dime.  In short, no one is
_entitled_ to _anything_.

>But what really makes the reader sad and angry is the following "and

Where was this?  I can't find this quote anywhere.

Why not?  Either write it yourself or get together with others who will but
don't tell me I'm obligated to give you free software simply because you
don't have the ability to pay for it.  Anyone who writes free software is
donating large amounts of their own time and expertise.  Be thankful for the
ones that are left, but don't criticize the ones that can no longer afford
to do so.

Hi,

I received a few e-mail requests for the ftp site for SimCity so here it 
goes :-)

Excerpt from the README file:
"
AVAILABILITY:
        Multi Player SimCity is available directly from DUX Software, and
via anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net (192.48.96.9), in the directory
"vendor/dux/SimCity".  You may freely copy it, and play the fully
functional game in "demo mode" 
"


Yet, another power tcl/tk app is tkined a very cool network management
platform. Capable of monitoring and displaying graphs on multiple 
systems and with the  tcl/snmp extenstions you  can generate snmp queries
or set snmp variables.
It has a primitive  Discovery application to help you layout your network.
It is very cool and the total size of the scripts its less than 300k.
I forgot where I got it from, if you are further interested just
post on comp.lang.tcl

From my PC running NetBSD system, using the sample network topology map,
I was able to generate snmp queries to their Cisco Routers. 

        Go Build A City,
        Amancio
