in the SLS distribution there is a file called p2c which converts Pascal
to C which you can then compile with gcc, it can ( apparently) be configured
to translate Modula-2 but i think you need to write some cobversion headers
for the Libraries etc and the code may need some hand-modifying before the C
code will actually compile !!
 i could not actually get it to translate any Modula-2, although it was fine
for loads of Pascal stuff. one of the demos it some woth, is a 60K or so, basic
interpreter !
i dont know where to get hold of it ( except with the SLS full install !!)

Reply-To: twilight@rwb114.rh.psu.edu

I have just gotten then new rplay sound programs to run on my system, and an
anoying feature is that foo.au plays fine, until the last 5 sec of the .au
file, then it stops playing until rplay closes the /dev/audio port.  Is
there a audio_flush call that can flush the buffering of this port, or can
we make one?  I am not familiar enough with the sound code to decifer this
out.  But I think a small call should do it.  Could anyone help me.  Email
would be fine, and I can post the answers if nessesary.

.99 pl 13,  gcc 2.4.5, libc's 4.4.2

Any other info can be supplied easily.

Thanks in advance.

One thing to keep in mind through all this refresh timer hacking
is that (I believe) capacitance in DRAMs varies with temperature.
It may be a good idea to do the tests at different temperatures,
and set the refresh timer to something with a reasonable safety
margin.  I think higher temperatures result in less capacitance,
meaning a higher refresh rate is required.  Be careful, or the
day your cooler dies may also be the day Linux dies. :-)

Hi, thanks to all who helped in my previous questions. I got another one:
is there an utility available for cross-referencing function calls, 
to build procedure call trees? I used to have some utilities like 
xref (cref?) with DOS, anything equivalent for Linux?

I have now downloaded the real driver along with the new version of modules.
This now seems to work quite well with pl13. Indeed I just removed all the  
tracing and comments and managed to do a full backup of my root fs.

              ...It rekons about 3Mb/min also...                            
                                                                            
HOWEVER... hardware compression seems to be disabled....!                   
           these figures relate to software compression.... using;          
           tar cvfz /dev/ftape /                                            
                                                                            
This generated much stopping and starting at some points... ie; the         
tape drive is faster than my machine's compression. Hence the data thruput  
could be increased using a 486/66....!                                      
                                                                            
While backing up, I put a SLIP connection up to internet.. I still got      
GOOD throughput on a NEWS download with no apparent ill effect on the tape  
drive... so timing/interrupt wise the driver seems great.                   
                                                                            
In general the source (and performance) of the driver is pretty impressive. 
Hence, I see no point in continuing with my driver.                         
--I can tar to/from the drive, but have done none of the bad sector/ecc     
work.                                                                       
                                                                            
There seem to be only a few outstanding points from what I've seen & heard; 
1) Ability to switch on/off hardware compression                            
2) More testing of ecc/bad sector handling                                  
   --I saw 2 ecc messages I wasn't too sure of                              
3) Size could do with reducing                                              
4) De-module it and send it to Linus for pl14... 

I will try some more tests... I quite fancy writing a backup program much
like the DOS based software that comes with the system....

Sorry, I should have specified my question. I was working with
Sun workstations under SunOS 4.1 for a certain time and was not 
aware that others weren't :-(

I meant 'loopback mounts' in the sense SunOS uses them: the only
possibility to mount directories into a 'chroot' environment
because symbolic links don't manage to do so for obvious reasons.

The correct syntax is:
  mount -t lo [directory] [mount-point]

The ambiguity of 'loopback' is confusing, though. As far as I 
know, this has nothing to do with loopback networking or even with
NFS. 

Sorry for the confusion. The question should read, is anybody working
on the implementation of SunOS-like loopback mounts?

   I can see why someone might not want to wade through the FAQ.  In all, the
   FAQ is over 500k in size!!!  This is about the size of a paperback novel, I
   think.  OF COURSE people aren't going to want to wade through the FAQ, and
   for good reason: there's a lot of it to wade through.

        It's really funny to see some of the people around here scream at
someone to read the FAQ when their machine will not work and possibly 
they cannot get it on their news machine.  How they are expected to RTFM
when the FM is on a dead machine is beyond me.  Of course, those of us
who know how can get a Linux box to boot somehow or boot from a floppy
and mount even damaged filesystems to get at our files.  Some cannot.

        Also, too many people around here don't seem to realize that some
of us don't have news at our site.  Screaming for someone to post to
another group when they CANNOT is pretty dumb.  My sysadmin refused to
install news and I just recently have been working on running GNUS under
emacs (alas... our quota is so small... and GNUS is SLOW AS HELL).  For
a long time I had no access to news at all.  I downloaded the archives
and paged through thousands of lines every week when I started out with
Linux.  I had time to do it so it was no big deal and I learned a lot by
reading all that mail.  However, lot of users out there fall into 
categories like:

* poorly connected
* very little time to RTFM, read news, absorb data, etc.
* have anal-retentive policies at their site which affect their relations
  with the outside world.
* Have very little money which directly affects the first catagory

So, basically it is OK to say RTFM and such but we really need something
better for some people.

I think Kevin's idea about a FAQ server is good but I thought we already
had one.  Do we?  Seems like it was at UNC.

I know I wrote this ("Welcome to c.o.l.*" in news.answers), but I don't 
think I believe it. This was the charter of the newsgroup, and it seemed
like a good idea at the time. But I don't see any reason not to cover
Linux-specific user-code development here. Yes, theoretically, there's nothing
specific to Linux. But we all know that people use Linux and develop certain
apps for Linux that we would not otherwise be seeing; there is a certain
fervor asociated with developing applications for Linux specifically.

I would like to open discussion on "allowing" applications development
and porting discussions on c.o.l.d. But I know that it's sure to cause
another dreaded flamewar... :)

Richard, 

Your, or my length of presence on the network is irrelevant. The fact of the
matter is the whole purpose of the "net" is the exchange of information, and
in my opinion, you have lost sight of that.  I have no doubt you are a clever
fellow, and I fully understand that other less clever folks upset you by
asking questions they most surly can find the answers to themselves. But
statements from you like: "the Morons who post... have no place in these
groups, or society.." I must once again say I find it hard to believe that in
saying such you feel that this will encourage a new user to go read a FAQ?  do
you actually believe this?  - hardly. 

So Richard, Before you get yourself in a big huff, and fire off some cleverly
worded, witty response designed to put me in my place and show everyone who
the real net wiz is, let me save you the trouble. I know you are not going to
change your opinion, nor am I likely to change mine. I guess we each see the
net in a different perspective. I am sorry I even took the flame bait in the
first place. I recognize your right to your own opinion.
