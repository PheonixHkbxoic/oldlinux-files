I agree! If we could port the freeware Motif apps (most notably, xmosaic), to 
use Athena widgets, it would end a lot of these sticky problems. Plus, I 
find the motif look and feel to be "cheesy" sometimes. (twm {does this use the 
Athena widgets?} is nicer than mwm, as far a I'm concerned).

The Athena widgets come standard with X, (and free), it would make things 
much easier if people used that! (not only less copyright problems, but 
no additional libraries that are not standard with X would be needed, taking 
up space)

Here come another myth. Not all Multisync monitors are safe, there are several
reports of frying Multisync monitors. The more intelligent multisyncs do not
turn on the tube until being sure which frequency they are syncing at the moment
and  until verifyiong that this frequency is within specs. These monitors can
very easily be fried , too. There have been reports of fried multisyncs, so this
is not only some theoretical blabla.
You can drive nearly any monitor 10% over specs (at least any I have seen yet).
Even this may damage your monitor, multisync or not. Furthermore there are 
multisync monitors with holes in the sync areas (i.e. syncing capability from
30kHz-40kHz and from 50-60kHz e.g.). You have to be very careful with those, as
they often have good specs for any resolution, but will stumble over low refresh
high resolution modes.

:>My multisync happens to be NEC, but I believe other non-NEC multisyncs
:>should be OK (safe)...

There is no such thing as safety if you do not take your pocket calculator
and multifly these Xconfig numbers to see whether they are good for your
monitor. It is not TO hard to multiply two or three numbers and compare 
the resulting numbers with the specs of the monitor. So this step must be part
of ANY Xconfig setup.

Well I happen to *like* the Motif look and feel.  I don't use mwm, but
I like to use Motif apps.  I think using the Athena widgets would take
away much of the slickness of Mosaic for X.  Motif is the standard.
We just need a free implementation of that standard.

"too large" for what?  He said they were "too large to be useful,"
which is obviously incorrect because there are thousands of people out
there like me who get use out of it.  You must get use out of it too,
otherwise why would you have it on your disk?  Plus, it's a lousy 2
megs.  Big deal.  Once you get a bunch of images going, it can easily
take up an additional 2 megs or more.  The gcc dir on my system is
around 12 megs, and it's probably about that much on your system too,
assuming it wasn't "too large" for you.

There is another solution, spend a few days making your own tools. I did
this for my current job, I didn't want to add the Motif license fee to
the cost of the product, and didn't like the look of athena's widgets.
The salary they paid me for that week has already been paid for several
times in saved licensing fees. 

Don't believe the "don't reinvent the wheel" stuff. If your making a
product that you plan to sell or give away many copies of, it generally
makes sense to build your own wheel you can use over and over again for
free.

Subject: How I got the atdisk2 patch to work on a GW2000 4DX2-66V.
Date: 21 Nov 1993 00:28:41 -0800

Hi all,

  Well for the longest time I've trying to get the atdisk2 patch to work
  on my Gateway 2000 4DX2-66V system.  It has taken some tweaking and a
  kernel upgrade, but I have it working now.  Well, sort of.

  I've upgraded my kernel to Linux 0.99pl13, and I used the atdisk2-0.6
  patch on the new kernel.  The atdisk2-0.6 patch has a diff file for
  the pl13 kernel.

  My system's 3 IDE hard drives are:

        1:  C:   /dev/hda    MSDOS           Western Digital 340M
        2:       /dev/hdb    Ext2 (Linux)    Western Digital 340M
        3:       /dev/hd1a   Ext2 (Linux)    Conner 80M

  The Gateway comes with 2 IDE interfaces built into the motherboard.
  Thus, I didn't have to do any hardware modifications to a IDE
  interface card.  Gateway uses IRQ 14 for drive 1 & 2, and uses IRQ 15
  for drives 3 & 4.

  I tried following the atdisk2 instructions on specifying the HD1_TYPE
  hard drive specifications, but it didn't work.  My boot up always
  became stuck with the OS reporting a Sync error.  So, I played around
  on getting my hd1.c hd_geninit routine to obtain the drive information
  from my system's CMOS.  I copied the CMOS code from hd.c and did not
  define a HD1_TYPE in my linux/config.h file.  At first I received a
  bunch of errors and a stuck boot up again.  Next I moved the BIOS
  pointer up 16.  (BIOS += 16;)  I recompiled and hey, it worked, or so
  I thought. {P.S. I did try multiples of 16 added to the BIOS pointer,
  i.e. 16, 32, 48, & 64, but none worked.}

  Well, it does; it just that I'm getting the BIOS specs on drive 2 for
  drive 3.  When I do a fdisk on /dev/hd1a I get a max of 1010 cylinders.
  The Conner 80M only has 251 cylinders.  Well, I think at least I have
  access to the drive.  Thus I fdisk a partition with 251 cylinders and
  make a Ext2 file system with 82828 blocks.

  If anyone knows the correct offset on the Gateway's Phoenix BIOS for
  the second AT interface, drive 3 & 4, please let me know.  If anyone
  wants a copy of my hd1.c file, E-Mail me a note.  Use the Internet
  address in my sig.

  Good Luck...

Subject: Linux Kernel Buffer questions...
Date: Sun, 21 Nov 1993 10:09:55 GMT


I have been using Linux for a while now (using the Slackware
distribution currently) and I have a few questions about how
the kernel operates.  Mainly requarding the use of memory as
buffers.

The first time I booted Linux I was surprised to see that I 
only had 450K free memory out of 16MB until I looked and saw
that the rest of the memory was being used by kernel buffers.
As I require more and more memory, I see that Linux frees
up buffers for me.  Now regarding this procedure, I have a few
questions:

#1.  If I load up my machine (ie Xwindows+30 Clients+compiles+etc)
     and I run out of regular memory (ie, > 16MB) and start to swap,
     is there a minimum amount of memory withheld to use as a buffer
     or do I completely lose my buffers.  Is there a way to configure
     the minimum amount of free buffers to be allocated?

#2.  Assuming I kill all the processes from #1 and return to a shell
     and a few daemons (basically an Idle state) what method is used
     to return the new free memory to buffer memory?  Or do I ever
     get it back?

#3.  What are the buffers, buffering? I've used SCO and it lets you 
     individually configure various buffer memory, ie Inodes, Disk blocks,
     TCPIP buffers, etc.  

Mainly I curious to how the buffers recover from high to low load 
transitions and vice-versa.  If I turn my machine on an let it run for
3 weeks without a reset, assuming I periodically log-in, run a large
number of processes and memory and then log-out until the next day or
whenever; 3 weeks down the road, will I still be seeing the same 
performance level that I did when I initially booted the machine?

Of course Helmut is 100% right, There are lots of brandname montors that you

The problem with the Xconfig file this thread is about, is that you cannot
use your calculator on the modes therein, as it uses 1 2 3 ... for clock
names so that you don't know which clocks really are used.
People blindly cycling through the modes risk their monitor and their
graphic cards. The fun part is, that tou may find a mode that looks nice and
stable, and running this mode for a week will kill your card and your
monitor. This is not theoretical bla bla, I can prove that this is true.

This means, that even if you want calculate whether you are save, you
cannot, and even if you find a stable mode, it may fry your card.

People PLEASE stop using this file (and carefully analyze the modes you
found using it)

That's the way to go. Look at modeDB.txt and use your calculator.

Everyone that has a good mode (within the specs !!) for a monitor NOT in
modeDB.txt, please send it to me or David Wexelblat so that we can include
it in the next release of modeDB.txt.

perhaps it`s possible that you may have 'limit coredumpsize 0' in your
