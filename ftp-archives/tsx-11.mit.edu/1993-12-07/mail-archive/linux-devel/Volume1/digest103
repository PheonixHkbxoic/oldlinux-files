*DON'T!*

I think that there is at least one strong reason against using /config:

Compatibility. For example, literature.  I'd hate to buy a book on Unix and
then not be able to apply any of it to Linux because we're extra special!
Also what about packages written for other Unix systems.  I, for example, got
mightily confused when I tried to configure net-2 under SLS.  I used the
nutshell series books which, of course, don't mention anything at all about
/config.  I suggest sticking to either BSD, Sys V.3 or Sys V.4 in what we do.
I don't want to have to beat on stuff that I download from internet sites
just to make it fit into a completely nonstandard Linux configuration scheme.

So don't use it.  I didn't see a suggestion that it *obliterate* existing ways
of doing it....

Anyway, the biggest problem is that it doesn't handle configuration files
which are scripts.  I sent Russell my startup.nos from JNOS/Linux as a case in
point :-) but it applies even more so to shell scripts....

Why not just make a /config dir, with symbolic links (ln -s) to the 'real'
config files.  That woould solve the whole problem of compatibility w/
the 'regular' un*xs, and as well, would make it easy for the non-gods to
set up the system.

In my experience, the multitude of completely different ways that 
different things get configured confuses novices.  Bringing all of the
config files into one directory is only a start, because it doesn't
deal with the fact that each is changed in a different way.

I'd like to think so, but my boss and co-workers are still at the "multiple
(cmdtool) windows, neat!" stage.  I'm the only one who does *any* X
programming --- and all of it at home; nobody at work is interested.

gcc hasn't the faintest idea how to switch to a different TSS... some things
*must* be done in assembler for that reason.

Date: Fri, 17 Sep 1993 03:38:45 GMT

Does anyone know if the rlogin and telnet that come with SLS Linux
1.03 have signal handling problems (e.g. I hit ^C to kill a process
remotely, instead, my rlogin/telnet is killed!)? Its driving me batty!
This is with bash 1.12.1 that is on my system.

I suspect it's the telnet/rlogin binaries (and probably with ftp, but
I don't remember testing for this behavior with FTP.) I'm using them
over a 14.4 SLIP link.

Yes, I believe this is more or less correct- the docs cover IPX and the
what is neccesary to implement a Netware client (i.e. connecting to
a server)- something less than full documentation, but more than just 
IPX.  Of course this is all based on hearsay on both sides- perhaps
someone should inquire to Novell or COSE, exactly what is available and
how much $$ it costs?

It seems to me that since a script has to be written anyway to
translate from the /config entry into the actual file in /etc or
wherever, that it would be much cleaner to have this script read and
write the actual file directly, and do away with the file in /config
which is just redundant anyway. This would also eliminate the issue of
loosing changes done directly to the config file if the entry in
/config is later changed and the script run. Something like SMIT in
AIX, I think, although I haven't used AIX enough to be sure if this is
what it does.

 there is also Wafe, which is Tcl+Xt+ (Motif or Athena) available from 
 
    ftp.wu-wien.ac.at:pub/src/X11/wafe/*
    
 it was published in the Jan93 Usenix conference in San Diego. The newer wafe versions
 (>96alpha) come with Hypertext support (using the HTML widget from XMosaic). 

 a linux version of wafe 0.95 built with the Athena widget set, plotter widget set and 
 drag and drop library is on sunsite.

Specifically, you need to RTFM.  In the most recent releases, the guys
doing the libraries have significantly improved the quality and clarity of
their docs to the point where you can really simply follow what they say
and you'll be ok.

Here's excerpts from the original lib4.4.1 announcement and instructions
that you should follow verbatim.  They worked here on my SLS1.02 system to
let me upgrade the libs...

Just do *EXACTLY* what they say and you'll have no problems.

(there's lots of stuff ommitted in the following.  Please grab all the
docs from the tsx-11.mit.edu directory for the complete stuff...)

[======================= attachment ========================]

You can get this package under pub/linux/packages/GCC from
tsx-11.mit.edu. The file names are inc-4.4.1.tar.gz,
inc-4.4-4.4.1.tar.gz, libc-4.4.1.tar.gz, libc-4.4-4.4.1.tar.gz,
image-4.4.1.tar.gz and extra-4.4.1.tar.gz.  Also binutils.tar.gz and
binutils-1.9l.tar.gz.

[... VDS note - you only need inc-4.4.1 and image4.4.1 to upgrade libs...]

1. inc-4.4.1.tar.gz
 
   The C/C++ header files for 4.4.1.
    
   cd /
   gzip -dc inc-4.4.1.tar.gz | tar xvvof -
         
   The header files in inc-4.4.1.tar.gz are not complete. You have to
   install the kernel source for the rest of the header files. Please
   get the version mentioned at the beginning of this release note.
   Suppose you install the kernel source at "/foo/bar/src", you should
   do as root
                    
   mkdir -p /usr/include
   cd /usr/include
   ln -s /foo/bar/src/linux/include/asm .
   ln -s /foo/bar/src/linux/include/linux .

5. image-4.4.1.tar.gz

  The static/stub libraries, shared image and crt0.o. To install
  it, as root do

  cd /tmp
  rm -rf ./lib ./usr
  gzip -dc image-4.4.1.tar.gz | tar xvvof -
  cp -av ./lib ./usr /
  cd /lib
  ln -sf libc.so.4.4.1 libc.so.4
  ln -sf libm.so.4.4 libm.so.4

  If you have an early version of libc.so.4.4.1 installed, you may have
  to play with it, like

  cd /lib
  cp libc.so.4.4.1 /tmp/libc.so.4.4.old
  ln -sf /tmp/libc.so.4.4.1.old libc.so.4
  mv libc.so.4.4.1 old.libc.so.4.4.1

  before you unpack image-4.4.1.tar.gz.

6. extra-4.4.1.tar.gz
 
  libmcheck.a, libg.a, libc_p.a, libgmon.a and gcrt0.o. To install
 
  cd /
  gzip -dc extra-4.4.1.tar.gz | tar xvvof -

I ran it with arguments "+1000 666 50" for 7.5 hours on my 386DX-33 and
it didn't crash Linux (0.99pl12). It would have been longer if not
because of a storm caused the machine to reboot. Later, I tried it again
starting from "+2000 20000 100" and it "crashed" at "+2000 20356 100". I
can still switch VCs so maybe it's not really a crash. I tried it once
more from "+2000 20300 100" and it "crashed" at "+2000 20357 100".
Again, I can switch VCs without problems and the system is still
responsive to keystrokes but only very slowly (a few minutes per
keystroke). There was not too much disk activities, so I don't think the
slowness was caused by swapping.

Savio Lam.
