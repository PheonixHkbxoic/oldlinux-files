Seems to me that the whole discussion is missing one of the basic
principles behind the tool approach. Combine to extend instead of
duplicating code. Multivolume backups can be handled with existing
tools--- /bin/sh, ls, xargs, tar, gzip etc. spring to mind. A little
creative use of existing tools can get you far more mileage from the
system than writing monolithic monsters that do everything from backup
to fixing you coffee (not that the last bit wouldn't be welcome :)

Offhand, I would say that I have come across less than a dozen "new"
feature which I found truly useful and could not be (almost) trivially
implemented using "conventional" tools.

Ladies and gentlemen: homework assignment. Please go back and read
Kernighan and Pike's book "The Unix Programming Environment." And
digest it. Please!

Yah, with a workstation on my desk, its fine.  However, its widgets do tend
to redraw themselves entirely, say, rather than just the part that gets
uncovered.  Nothing quite like running a Motif app over a SLIP connection
with a line speed of 9600 (or even 38400, for that matter).

But that's neither here nor there w/regard to using it for free software.

YUURGH!  I've heard this mantrated ten or fifteen times and the
more I hear it the sillier it sounds.

Of course XFree86 isn't Linux/BSD-specific.  Of course there are
three or four people out there running it on old Esix 3.2D
boxes that don't have decent commercial X support and are in
Madagascar so they can't download Linux from the net or have it
mailed to them by JANA because the lemurs would break the CD case.
Of course.  And I'm not saying this is wrong.

But saying "we refuse to add this feature because it wouldn't
work on Esix 3.2D" is like saying "we refuse to support
acceleration because it won't work on the ET4000."  It's
dogmatic and silly.

I appreciate the good work that the XFree86 people have done,
but it pisses me off when political termites like this eat
their way into a good project.

  i can second that from my experience with Wafe (tcl binding for Athena and MOTIF)
  where i measured the  savings form C/Motif and C/Athena. The GUI part shrinks typically 
  by a factor 6 to 10 depending on programming style etc. The debugging time is much shorter
  since memory allocation bugs, the tedious XmString handling etc. are done on a much higher
  level (in wafe) and not in the application level. Of course, if the non-gui part of an application
  is large, the saving is less. For runtime efficiency of the GUI part, you won't notice a difference.

  Wafe can be obtained from ftp.wu-wien.ac.at:pub/src/X11/wafe/*;  both the Athena and OSF/Motif
  version of wafe support Mosaic 2.0's HTML widget (i've written an Athena (Xaw3d) port).

yes the file was 35 Meg but the machine it was run on (a sparc 2 64 Meg Ram)
needed 200 Meg swap to run it.  There were alot of menues and lists.
The program did have a large pixmap compiled in but not THAT large.

You don't have to ditz,  you can ditz.  That's a major difference.
The ditzing is normally done by the application programmers.  However,
users,  if they have the desire and knowledge,  can customize tehir
own setups.  That is not available to MSW and MAC users where you get
what someone else decides you want.  Of course,  really clever
applications have GUI interfaces to guide you to the right customizing
choices.

Where this flexibility really comes in handy is when you have to
adapt someone else's applications to fill a need in yours.

select() is not POSIX at all.  I presume you are talking about
bug-compatibility with BSD (which doesn't return the amount of time
left of a timeout).  I remember there being a trivial workaround to
make this work with programs who assume more than what the spec allows
(the Linux select() is perfectly to spec, as far as I know); maybe the
compatibility code can be put in the standard library and a #define
can be put in, say, bsd/select.h or whatever.

O.K. Rajappa, while we're doing our homework, here's some for you:
Given a directory "stuff" which contains 35 files, avaeraging 2-3 Mega
bytes in size, and given a device "/dev/fd0a"; a 1.44 Meg floppy drive,
design a shell script that will put these files onto a series of
disks. We must then be able to retrieve these same files with either
the same or another script. 

There must be less than 256 bytes of dead space on any disk, except
the last.

Then, compare the space usage, and execution time of these scripts as
compared to GNU tar or other multi-volume archivers.

Also consider these results if it had been 35,000 files across several
4 gig tapes...

It's called Wine and a status announcement was just posted to

The easier way is to add the following line to config.in:
    bool 'Auto-detect serial IRQs' CONFIG_AUTO_IRQ y
then you will be able to choose that option at config/compile time.

The reason its use is discouraged is, as I understand it, because
poking around at the ports to determine serial IRQ has an ill effect
when certain ethernet boards are installed.  The preferred method is
to use the "setserial" program in rc.local to configure the serial
hardware correctly on each machine.

Subject: Some questions from an new user...
Date: 30 Nov 93 18:46:31 GMT

I have just (like last week) installed SLS 1.04 on the following hardware:
        Apricot XEN LS-II PC, 16M ram, 500M disk.  The system has an onboard Sony 
                CD-ROM, Adlib sound system, Cirrus controller on the local bus,
                and ethernet.
After a few initial problems, I was able to get Linux up and running and I am
impressed.  Now its time to ask a few questions:

1)  Ethernet
In order to get networking up, I have installed an SMC card.  However, the XEN
an on-board ethernet interface based on an Apricot 596 ethernet controller.
Has anyone out there had any experience writing a driver for this beast??

2)  CD-ROM
I am continually experiencing read failures on the CD.  In particular, if I
attempt to do something like a grep or find, the CD will eventually go
into a read/retry loop from which it never returns.  Is this a known problem??
Do I need to tune/path the CD fs code??

3)  Releases
For my information, how are Linux releases numbered??  I see references to
113/114/115; my release comes up with SLS 1.04.  Is there a simple 
relationship??  

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Many Thanx (in advance)

This is really incorrect.  AT&T and Sun developed OpenLook.  There were
several toolkits available.  The main one developed by Sun was Xview, which
was contributed, *SOURCE* and all, to the X consortium.  Anyone who wanted it
could get the source and port it to the X/UNIX platform of their choice.
Xview is included with XFree86, along with the OpenLook Window Manager and
the Cmdtool/Shelltool terminal tool.  All of the things that are available
in source code that are coded with Xview work, except those things that
depend on Sun's DevGuide application generator.  People also ported Xview to
DEC Ultrix and HPUX.

What WAS proprietary to Sun was the XNeWS extension that they called
OpenWindows and the toolkits that used the NeWS side of this, such as TNT.

I hope the prediction of clones is correct on time.

Actually Sun and AT&T bid OpenLook, but the whole point of OSF was to put
roadblocks in front of Sun and AT&T.  HP, DEC and IBM recognized the threat
of the new juggernaut.  Motif was chosen partially because of its
resemblance to the OS/2 windows and HP's OO addon to Windows (what was it
called?).

Sun not only had checked with Xerox, they had cross licensed with Apple for
the Mac stuff (trashcan icon, etc.).

Remember OSF really stood for "Oppose Sun Forever" according to Scott
McNealy.

Give to Notif.  Maybe we can get them to put round and oval buttons in as an
option.  I too like the cleanness of the looks of OL, but we could still
have some of the OL L&F with the Motif API.  I sortof suspect COSE will
inject some OL'ness into Motif.
