I recently got a copy of Sendmail 8.6.4 and compiled it (with only
minor difficulties)...and now I'm having some trouble getting a config
file that will work...does anyone have a sendmail 8.6.4 config file I could
use as a guide (the machine concerned uses SMTP and has a direct Net 
connection)....

any help ?

As we in the un*x world know, better does not necessarily mean
acceptance, and SQL is considered the standard, these days.

I have just installed the yp-linux binaries on a machine at work. I had
problems as well (this was on a Slackware 1.1.0 installation) until
I backed libc down from 4.4.4 to the libc.4.4.2 included in the yp-linux
binaries. Being new to linux, I don't know what problems the reverting
to the slightly older libraries will cause... I haven't seen any yet.
I have the libc.4.4.4 sources, and the NIS routines are definitely 
there, but I haven't tried recompiling them yet (the documentation

I'm not sure why you posted the same message twice, but anyways would
something like JETNET work?  It should compile with f2c and seems about
one of the most intelligent neural network code I've used.  If you like
I can look up the e-mail address so you request the latest version.

Make minix isn't what you want, make sysv is.  At least, that's what I used

When Relational Technology (as it then was) first added SQL, I believe they
simply translated the SQL to QUEL.  The two problems that are instantly apparent
are that you would need to add the UNION operator (QUEL's only notable
deficiency in my view), and SQL views are virtual tables possibly including
duplicates, while QUEL views are re-writes of the WHERE clause.  It need not
be too hard to tackle either of these problems though.  But building a native 
SQL engine would be a huge job if you wanted to keep the optimizer.

Having said all that, you really should try to master QUEL--especially the
aggregate functions.  It could be a religious experience.  QUEL is elegant,
concise, subtle and powerful.  SQL is none of those things.  QUEL is also
FAR easier to learn, so if you have already mastered SQL you've got what it
takes.  C. J. Date's "A Guide to INGRES" has a fairly good QUEL tutorial.
See the incomparable INGRES FAQ on comp.databases.ingres for details.

Buzzt!  You lose.

Ingres is our main production base in my department, and there isn't
anyone here who would rather use QUEL than SQL.  My guess would be
that the choice of whether to use QUEL or SQL would be determined by
personal preferences, portability, and availability.  

(and, yes, we DID buy Ingres (back in the days when you purchased it
from Ingres)

 What would it take to implement scroll-back on tty output?
 That is, the user could scroll back on the screen output by hitting
a certain key, such as PgUp.

 Would it have to go into the kernel, or could it be hacked into
a shell, similar to the way the program "screen" has a 
scrollback buffer?

There is limited scroll-back on virtual consoles.  Basically, pressing
shift-pgup and shift-pgdn (default key mappings) let you access other
parts of the circular video buffer.  Switching VC's will lose scrollback
because it resets the buffer.

A more complete implementation could be put in the kernel, but I'm
not sure the benefits would be worth the bloat.  I can usually get
the same effects using pagers when I need scrollback.  Other
approaches are to run a shell under GNU Emacs or screen.

Ahhhh, but this is the crucial aspect of the problem: as a rule OSF want
people to pay for copies of their _runtime_ system too, while everybody
else is content with being paid just for their _development_ system.
This is *fair*, oh yes, and brings in profits, oh yes.

Unfortunately runtime royalties are considered hideous by users and
developers, for both practical and administrative reasons; while nobody
really questions development system costs, for commercial sw.

Thus in practice runtime royalties have all but disappeared: but for OSF
and a very, very few others, commercial companies make their profits
selling the development systems (SDKs), and often for very low prices
too; then applications developed with those can be freely distributed,
and no royalty is due on the libraries used by those applications,
whether they are shared, static or whatever. Even Microsoft, who are not
noted for being nice to people, don't require runtime royalties on
virtually all their libraries (Microsoft Cobol has been mentioned as an
exception).

If you need to pay for an SDK, free sw diffusion is impeded but not
tragically: some kind soul will buy an SDK, do a binary, and distribute
that with the sources for the people who don't need, or cannot get, the
SDK. But if runtime royalties enter into the picture, things get much
murkier.

It is perhaps *fair* to force people to buy a full SDK if they just want
to run an application, or make the developer pay a royalty on each
binary installed, but it is hardly nice, by today's standards.

Developers and users have said no to this.

So, as of today, it is generally true that if you develop an
application, you pay your dues on the SDK, not on all and every copy of
the application you give out. Except for OSF/Motif, that is, in
many/most cases.

With 1.1.x the OSF had a limited, but still barely tolerable policy:
they did not want a royalty, ever, on statically linked binaries. Now,
with OSF/Motif 1.2.x, in most/many cases, and rather complicately
defined too, runtime royalties are there also for statically linked
binaries. Too bad.

Hello, I am student enrolled in a course called System Engineering.  The course's objective was to set up an electronic network to allow companies to share information.  We have many companies that are interested in participating but we have had some trouble finding the proper communication software to run our network.

The following are the requirements for our network:

- full graphic interface between PC and VAX mainframe with normal phone line

- VAX architecture might be too old and we do have the capacity to upgrade to
  a new system architecture which will be able to handle our demands.



- PC remote station must be able to execute mainframe programs example :

                 - ANSYS
                 - UNIGRAPHICS
                 - MATLAB
                 - XMATH
                 - ALGOR
                 - etc
                 
- menu driven software

- cost minimal; remote station must be able to use this network with minimal cost for
  upgrade

- screen sharing capabilities (real time and transmission rate > 2400 baud) 

- file transfer must have choice of common communication protocols


So far we know of :  PC-X
                     VISIT from Northern Telecom ( cannot be accessed from a                            remote station not having VISIT software)

                     
Any recommandations to what kind of commercial or public domain software we should use will be appreciated.

Yesterday, I recieved a reply to address the comp.os.linux.* groups for help and it also mentioned that the software requirements I need may be meet by a software package called XFREE ?  Will it, if so where can I get some information on it ?


Thank you,

Marco

This is a harmless warning.  Grab a copy of the new (0.4 or later)
e2fsprogs from tsx-11.mit.edu or ftp.ibp.fr in /pub/linux/BETA/ext2fs.
The "mount count" was implemented in ext2fs as a response to public
demand; the filesystem can keep a count of how many times it has been
mounted so that you can force it to do an fsck every so many mounts.
e2fsprogs-0.4 has an e2fsck which understands these counts and can
reset them.  There's also an fstune program with which you can change
the number of mounts between auto-fscks (or disable the feature
completely).

Cheers,
 Stephen.
