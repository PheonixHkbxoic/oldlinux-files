Subject: Linux boot sequence and vga video modes
Date: Fri, 1 Oct 1993 06:04:06 GMT


As the readers of comp.windows.x.i386unix might recall, I have this
old Matsushita 19" color monitor that used to be on a Sparcstation 2
that I'm trying to get working with my ET4000 card.

I'm typing this message to you from said monitor on said pc running X.
I was able to get the right cable and the right numbers for the
monitor from vgaset (starting from numbers obtains from the back of an
envelope so I wouldn't fry this monitor).

Now for my question.  I'd like to get it working in text mode, if at
all possible.  The montor seems to sync at a few different places, so
I thought I'd go hunting for one with vgaset.  I don't think it will
be too hard to find or fabricate one.  This will leave only the
power on self test as the only part of the system that I have no
control over and will settle for garbage here (I'll hook up a
multi-sync monitor if I need to see this), or even having my display
completely off.

Assuming for the moment that I can find one, I need to know about
Linux's boot process.  Does Lilo set the vga mode?  If so, then can I
hack lilo to always use my oddball settings and know that the Linux
kernel will not change it?  If I do this, how will XFree cope?  Will
it be able to restore the settings that I booted up at?  If not, is
there a vgaset-like program that I can feed my numbers to?

Finally, am I crazy for doing all of this just to get an older, rather
finiky 19" color monitor to work?

Many other window systems than MS-Windows have screen saver hooks, in
one form or another.  In X it is possible to have a screen saver now,
but the cost of the screen saver is rather high, or requires that your
process is running on the same machine as X is, and even the latter
isn't foolproof.

Hi there, I've found the script below causes a general protection: 0040
kernel panic error under 0.99pl13. I'm useing a 486DX66 VLB, with 8MB 
ram and 16MB swap.   There is a whole page of kernel output between 
general protection: 0040 and kernel panic.  If need be, I can write it
down and mail it.  However, I suspect this is not a hardware problem,
so others should have no problem producing the same error.

Using p2c is all very well, but it's still not the same as a real

A real Pascal compiler for Linux would be very nice...

Didn't panic on my machine.

This does get me lots of find: no such file or directory, unless the script
is located in /.

After a while (and moving the script to /) I do run out of processes
(and get find: cannot fork: try again a whole bunch).

Are you that paranoid about finding duplicate files?  I'm sure there
are less scary ways to do it, but frankly it's not very high on my list
of things to think about right now :)

Anyway,  the point is that it didn't crash on my pl13 machine.

Yes it is run from root..., but that shouldn't matter if you specify its full
path when running it.  Also I don't see why you should run out of processes
when only two are running at any given time.  Are you sure you copied it 
exactly?  

>Are you that paranoid about finding duplicate files?  I'm sure there

It seems like the simplest method to me.  I accidently destroyed
most of symbolic links with "makehole", so I wanted an automatic 
way to recreate them.

>Anyway,  the point is that it didn't crash on my pl13 machine.

Since posting, I tried the same script (with minor translations) under
tcsh.  Under tcsh it works with no problems, so maybe this is a problem
with the version of bash that came with SLS1.03 instead of the kernel
as I originally thought.  I hope someone who knows what "general protection:
0040" means replies.

Anyways thanks for trying it.

                             Bill

P.S. Since it sounds like this isn't a kernel problem I'm moving this
thread to comp.os.linux.misc.

That's not so clear.  In practice it turns out that most characters
are output.  And under most situations lots of them get put into one
packet.  Terminal servers can often be set so that if you're doing
high-speed input several characters get put into one packet.  So
interrupt load for high-speed I/O is less with TCP, unless you've got
a smart serial card with big buffers.  It's not clear that in any case
the TCP processing is that great.  We've had on the order of 25 to 50
users on Suns for years via TCP, without any noticable sign of
trouble.  A modern 486 processor is about as fast as the processors
used on those Suns, and I think Linux' TCP has if anything less
overhead.  (We're not talking about Berkeley's latest hand-tweaked
TCP/IP code, but SunOS.)  I'm inclined to think that TCP protocol
overhead is not going to be enough to cause trouble, and that if
you're comparing against fairly stupid serial cards, the system impact
will be less.

 do have to agree with others that there is a need for a version of
Rawrite for OS/2.  The current version for DOS will not run in a
DOS-box.  I really don't want to have to load DOS every time I want to
Rawrite a disk. 

This may be a signal of laziness on my part.  I havn't been able to get
a decent D/L under a linux serial-term program.  (My problem)  So I use
OS/2 as my communications package.  (I ran into the Seyon won't let go
problem and havn't used Seyon since.)  I'll go do some learning now...
excuse me for being lazy. :-)

It may, if the tape is interfaced via the floppy controller, but
you'd have to try it.

I however am not sure if Mountain Filesafe (which is what I have) will
be supported by ftape or some other driver, since although it claims
QIC-80 compatibility, in reality it is hooked up with a special (presumably
proprietary) interface card (which can make a big difference in I/O
performance compared to QIC-80).

So - question time - anyone have a similar model tape drive they
have (or want) to kook to linux?  Would writing to Mountain saying I
want to run this thing outside of DOS make any sense to them?

Has anyone gotten this modem of archive tape to work with Linux.

I've gotten it to work with my amiga before I sold it and now want to use it
with my linux box.  It has SCSI60 sticker on it and it is a 60 meg drive.

After hooking it up to my linux box, it is identified properly by the SCSI
code.  Howerver, I am unable to give the tape drive any mt commands.  The 
light on the tape drive comes on and it just sits there.

Can anyone help me out.  My system and set up are as follows.

Motherboard:  486DX/66
SCSI:  Adaptec 1542b
Memory:  16MB ram , 20 Meg swap
KERNEL:  99.99pl11 or pl13 (have both available)
SCSI and SCSI tape are configured for the kernel.

        How strange, I was under the impression that you had deleted
        /bin/sh altogether, substituting it with csh.

        For some reason, this test does not do what you want, resulting
        in a fork loop and abovementioned panic. Change it to

                        if [ X$1 = X ] ; then

        and it should work. Nevertheless, don't you think you can do
        this less expensively?
