Very close.  The time limits are set by the higher-level code (sd.c),
not the PAS-16 driver; the driver is honoring a limit which is too low
for the operation being performed.

When you commented out the PSEUDO_DMA flag, you forced the NCR5380.c
driver core to use PIO (programmed I/O) for all of the data transfers to
and from the disk.  PIO is relatively slow... I was getting only 50-80
kbytes/second transfer rate on a 386SX with an NCR5380 in PIO mode.

If the upper layers of the file and I/O system attempt to write a large
group of buffers to disk, the block-driver code in sd.c will often
try to do this as one big SCSI write using scatter/gather.  If you try
to flush, say, 500k bytes of new filesystem datastructures out to
consecutive blocks on disk using a single scatter/gather write, the
operation will take several seconds to complete.  If the write takes
more than 5 seconds (the 300-tick timeout specified in sd.c) then the
PAS16 driver will time out and abort the request.  Due to the nature of
the handshaking code in NCR5380.c, this will probably hang your system.

>I wonder 
>      1) if anyone can tell me how to correct the problem.  

Possibility 1 - increase the TIMEOUT value in sd.c to a larger number.
Increasing it from 300 to 3600 will increase the write timeout from 5
seconds to 1 minute, which should be plenty.

Possibility 2 - change the code in sd.c so that the timeout value is set
to a base minimum (300 is fine) plus an increment for each sector being
transferred (2 or 3 seems to work well).

Possibility 3 - the PAS-16.h file (or whatever it is properly named) has
an entry in it which is #included into a table in hosts.c.  One entry in
this table is the scatter/gather control value.  It's probably set to
SG_ALL (255) which enables some pretty big scatter/gather operations.
Setting it to SG_NONE will completely disable scatter/gather;  this
should fix your problem but is more severe than necessary.  Try setting
it to a value of 10 or 20 or 30;  this will enable scatter/gather
operations but will limit their size to a range which will complete
within the 5-second timeout limit.

Possibility 4 - figure out why pseudo-DMA isn't working correctly, so
you can re-enable it and get your transfer rate up out of the basement.

The timeouts are specified by the upper-level code (in this case, sd.c)
and it'd probably be best to tweak them there.

It's a combination of high-level (block-buffer flushing), mid-level
(sd.c timeout setting), low-level (scatter/gather limit) and hardware
(the fact that pseudo-DMA isn't working).

The failure of pseudo-DMA operations to work properly _might_ indicate
an IRQ conflict, or that the PAS-16 isn't jumpered to support SCSI IRQs
but the driver thinks that it is.  If the driver believes that IRQs are
enabled, it will tell the drive that disconnect/reselect is supported.
If the drive choses to disconnect during a SCSI operation (e.g. during a
read), and if the card doesn't support IRQ properly and thus fails to
"hear" the reselection interrupt, then operations will tend to hang.

The files you're looking for are scsi/sd.c, scsi/NCR5380.[ch],
and scsi/pas16.[ch]

These are the silliest arguments I've heard yet.  Even ignoring NCSA's
actual funding situation, you are completely off base.

First, as I've explained previously, the decision to use Motif was
deliberate and made on the basis of our intention to create stable,
high-function application code on top of common, vendor-supported
system-level software.  Motif is OBVIOUSLY, OVERWHELMINGLY the GUI of
choice on high-performance Unix/X workstations, and every major vendor
is now supporting it.  In fact, if we had NOT gone with Motif, I'd say
you would be able to make the argument that we were squandering
hypothetical said taxpayers' money by not basing our hypothetically
taxpayer-funded tools on stable, high-function, common,
vendor-supported libraries and spending resources dealing with the
effects of such a choice rather than on new and useful results.

Second, the community we were aiming for with the X version of Mosaic
-- people using common high-performance workstations with standard
system-level software, particularly to do scientific computing -- is
virtually entirely satisfied with our choice of GUI *and* with our
software (as, btw, is the National Science Foundation itself; c.f. the
head of NSF's Supercomputing 93 keynote address).  We have clearly and
overwhelmingly fulfilled our obligation to said hypothetical taxpayer:
100,000 satisfied target users served, and climbing.

Third, given the above, it's just your lucky day as someone either
outside or just on the edge of said target user community that we both
(a) make the source code for the X version freely available for you to
either port to the GUI of your choice OR to freely compile and use as
you are able, AND (b) supply a Microsoft Windows version of Mosaic
that AGAIN hits its target audience -- the vast majority of
386/486/Pentium users -- dead on.  We are pleased to be able to offer
you such a wide array of possible ways to benefit from the results of
our work, and we hope that we are thereby able to improve your life.

Fourth, if the above still doesn't make you happy, tough luck.  It is
not possible for you to draw the blanket conclusion that "we work for
you" and therefore must do everything you say, just because we may be
funded with public money.  The DMV, though funded with public money,
is not obligated to grant you a driver's license; a police officer,
though funded with public money, is not obligated to let you off the
hook when you're going 95 MPH; the Supreme Court, though funded with
public money, is not obligated to find in your favor in a given case.

Summary: we are doing our jobs; we are responding to the needs of our
target audience; you do not get to tell us what to do simply because
you are a citizen and we are (partially) publicly funded.

Freeware developers appreciate constructive feedback, but they don't
appreciate demands from those who choose to use their software.  From
my experience, expectations of users are too often presented to the
developers in the form of demands, and often rudely.

I think your use of "customer" to describe the users of free software
is inappropriate.  What exactly is the "peril" producers face?  That fewer
people use their software?  So what?

Are you speaking as a user of free software or a developer?

I can't believe I'm getting dragged into this, but isn't it time that some
people grew up around here.  The above is nothing more than a childish
taunt IMO.  

Perhaps we need some positive feedback to Marc, Rob and Eric to balance the
negative crap they've been getting recently.  Thanks to all of them for
providing some excellent software, and for dragging the HTTP and HTML
protocol suite into a damn fine system.  I make no contribution to their
financing whatsoever, being a UK person, and still they let me use the fruits
of their time and effort at no cost, and provide a friendly and useful 
support function whenever things do go wrong.

I love Mosiac, and the NCSA httpd, and I hope all this crap doesn't put them
off futher development.  If you don't like the way Mosaic is developing,
bugger off and find another browser.  

Thanks NCSA people!

It's about time that I updated the old ``LDP Manifesto'' to get this
information out. The I&GS is ``complete'', in that everything is
there, but as with anything is going through a constant revision
process. The SAG, NAG, and KHG are available in various stages of
development. The User's Guide is the only one lagging behind (nudge
nudge, wink wink) but I would hope to see something within a couple of months.

Writing books is a very slow process, because it's such a large task.
When writing the I&GS (around 150 pages now) I spent 25% of my time
writing new material and 75% of the time rewriting old. In fact, the
last couple of chapters are extremely terse because they didn't go
through that extensive rewrite process (yet)--- I wrote them both in a
weekend.

I'm in the process of `rewriting' the I&GS, and the next release (real
soon now) will include information on getting and installing "any"
release of Linux---that is, it won't be SLS-specific. However, the
more general you get, the less specific you get. Therefore, the next
version of the book will rely on the various distributors
having a set of complete instructions for installing just that
release. I know that not all Linux distributions have this, for
instance, SLS's "installation instructions" are limited to a set of
cursory README files that expect the reader to know what's going on.
What I may attempt to do is produce an "Installation HOWTO" for each
major Linux distribution (at least, the ones available via
FTP---CD-ROM and mail-order distribution usually come with fairly
complete instructions) and provide that as a supplement for the I&GS.
So, in order to install Slackware, you'd grab the I&GS and the
"Slackware Installation Supplement" that provided Slackware-specific
stuff and expected that you'd read it along with the I&GS. 

The problem is, I don't have the resources or time to download and
install each of these Linux distributions to see first-hand what it's
like. What I would like to do is gather a small group of
volunteers---say, one or two for each distribution---to help me write
these documents. The docs will be short and simple, more or less
step-by-step instructions on how to install the software, with the
background ideas being relegated to a document like the I&GS.

If you've installed a release of Linux (recently, and other than
SLS), and would like to help me write an "Installation HOWTO" for that
particular release, please mail me. Essentially each document will be
a modification of the current Installation-HOWTO for that release, and
shouldn't be very hard to put together. Maintaining such a document is
a different matter. I'm hoping that the individual distribution
coordinators would be able to maintain these documents after they're
written.
