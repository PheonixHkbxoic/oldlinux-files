We thought of that first, but we were told that a) Test period for 3 months,
and we (the higher powers) are not sattisfied you are off the net and
b) You (us, running the machine) pay the traffic even if the users don't pay
you.

So we wanted to be sure users pay ahead of using their money, in the future
when we perhaps have more moolah to play with we might choose to go the cleaner
way.

        I FINALLY discovered why people are drawn to MOTIF! Like the PC
        world it came out of, you have to ditz with it's equivelent of
        a config.sys for hours or days in order to get it to work right!

        What FUN is it if your Window system or OS has good defaults that
        work right out of the box?!?!

        I need to correct the use of L&F to API. As people have pointed out
        there are L&F alternatives but they do not appear to have the same
        API that COSE has apparently decided the UNIX industry should use.

        I disagree that OpenLook was worse. OpenLook was a L&F, OLIT, XView
        and whatever Sun actually called it's version were implementations.
        In my somewhat loudmouth opinion the Motif API is a piece of garbage
        relative to the OpenLook alternatives.

        The ONLY reason MOTIF(tm) has gotten anywhere is because it looks
        and behaves like, Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeech, Windows. That is the
        only reason it was accepted by the industry, certainly not for it's
        memory leaking technical merits. The humorous part is that Motif could
        still be subject to Look and Feel infringements if some legal beagle
        gets antsy. At least Sun double checked with Xerox to make sure it's
        L&F was clean...

        Anyways, I hope a Free version of the API built from PUBLICALLY
        AVAILABLE documents will become available soon. It's embarrassing
        that the supposed "Open Systems" industry chose a proprietary, single
        source vendor for the user interface of "Open Systems"; sigh.

        Actually, using a Free toolkit would simplify things the most. Why
        would I want to spend MONEY on a project that is freely redistributable?

        Why would I want to have to worry about if end users have a runtime
        license or not?

        Why would I want to be FORCED to link statically, and thus create
        even a BIGGER monster, in order to dodge this restriction or that?

        Using a Free toolkit would solve all the problems; no questions to
        get answered at all. If someone can ftp the freely redistributable
        code they should be able to ftp the freely distributable toolkit.

        If there is a Free version of something available why bother with
        a commercial version? Support? Support for most commercial applications
        is a VERY unfunny joke. Every forum I've seen, USENET, compu$erve,
        Delphi, Prodigy ALL offer better support than most commercial vendors
        and now commercial vendors even have the gall to CHARGE for lousy
        technical or end user support!!! At least with for-charge car,
        electronics or services warrantees I feel like I'm actually getting
        something for my money...

        At least with freely redistributable code you can either 1) Fix it
        yourself, or 2) have a decent chance of actually getting it fixed
        in less than a commercial 6 month time frame.

        It was chosen for 2 basic reasons:

        1) It looks like MS Windows
        2) It wasn't submited from those "evil anti-christs out to rock the

        Hmm, the Motif apps I've seen are slow on the SAME PLATFORM vs their
        OpenLook, either Sun or AT&T OLIT, conterparts.

        twm has the virtue of not filling your screen with crap by default,
        you have to explicitly tell it to. OpenLook and Motif are the
        other way around.

        OLIT always struck me as being more straight forward than all the

        Good thing they have the whole net and Cygnus helping them out or it
        might take even longer. At least the net provides a better Alpha test
        platform than alot of the commercial companys have.

     Certainly the library is not all that large, but the library size has
little to do with the actual amount of memory used at run time.  

     I do not have the exact numbers available, but I recall that the Motif
list widget (in 1.1.x) used an exorbitant amount of memory.  I did a project
that used very long scrolled lists (30 k lines).  These lists would take up
6 to 8 meg of memory in the list widget itself.  (I haven't tried this with 1.2.x
so maybe its fixed now.)

     So, the impression of Motif being bloated is not completely off base as 
far as I am concerned.  It wouldn't take alot of long list widgets that the 
gui builder creates to add up to 35 meg.  The program that I worked on which
included these long lists routinely ran at 20 megs.

     Just my 2 cents worth.

This is also with a local console.  The network load becomes very apparent
with motif if you are useing a remote computer and have a heavy  ether load,
or a PPP link.

I didn't write that motif was difficult to write in, but I have writen Xlib, 
XT, Mac, Motif, OpenLook, Xview, and suntools programs.  Motif is not
particularly harder than any of the rest although I think the docs are a bit
harsh.  I do much prefer Xlib though over the others, although Xview is very
easy to come up with a quick easy application that looks nice.

I will not debate this point much as I did not look at the source code for
this program.  I think almost everyone has seen how much larger a motif
program is than an Xlib or Xt program that does the same.

        NetBSD is aimed at more architectures than just Intel. Currently
        it supports SPARC, Intel and Motorola m68k with Sun3, sun4, Intel,
        Amiga, Mac and other machines. It appears it's end goal is to
        provide a universal UNIX-like OS across as many platforms as possible.

        The other BSD's and Linux appear to be concerned primarily with Intel
        although there is an m68k Linux port(s) under way.

        Hmm, was this runtime or load time sizes? Up until the current release
        Motif had/has a tendonsy to leaked memory like a seive. B^(. This was
        especially painful on small PC systems running SCO or Interactive
        although it would eventually be a pain on Sun's, HP's and RS6k's.
