This "pleasant" little news article is for all those out there who felt the need
to gripe and complain at the Mosaic for X authors for daring to use Motif in a
program they then gave away free.  If you are not one of these people, or
don't like harsh language, read no furthur.

This note in no way reflects the opinions of NCSA, the U of I, or the Mosaic
developement team.  Just my personal little rant and rave.




What the hell is wrong with you people!?!  Ok, there is this really neat new
software that everyone is using, but YOU can't use it because it uses Motif
and you don't have Motif.  This pisses you off, and you complain; I can see that.

If you don't mind looking like a class A idiot, you might even complain to a
public news forum.  But what the hell is wrong with you morons who DEMAND that
it is your right, and the responsibility of the programmers, to give you programs
that you can use for free on whatever platform you happen to have chosen?!

............. <- that represents about 3 pages of profanity I just typed and
                 deleted, aren't you glad I spared you that?

1)  You want to use free software?  You have no rights, period.  You take what
    you can get, that is all.

2)  Truth to tell, I don't like OSF and their licensing policies either.  But
    unlike you, I'm not an idiot who just sits around and blathers about how
    awful OSF is while doing nothing myself.  I put lots of work into the first
    release of the HTML widget used by Mosaic 1.2 to ensure that it was completely
    compatable with other Widget sets.  Did a single one of you bozos write any
    free code that used that widget?  No.  Idiots!  So now you rant on and on
    about how you can't use Mosaic 2.0, because it uses Motif whine whine whine.
    Have any of you looked at the code?  Marc and I are damn good programmers, and
    that means the code is pretty easy to understand and modify, even to complete
    neanderthals like you.  What, you can't program!  Then you are back to number
    1, with no rights at all, and either get used to using what exists, as opposed
    to what you want, or throw out your computer and just become a couch potato.

3)  Just to prove to myself that I'm not wrong, and the net really is filled
    with idiots, I sat down to do a quick hack of Mosaic to use the Athena
    widgets.  Results:  it took 10 hours to have a very basically functioning
    version running.  10 hours, that is probably less time that it takes most
    of you morons to just find your fingers when you sit down to write drivel to
    the net.  But no, did one of you whining worthless bits of flatulence even
    TRY to make something useful for yourself, and the rest of your fellow
    nincompoops; not a chance.

4)  So here is my Christmas gift to you.  On ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in 
    /outgoing/ebina you will find the source of the hacked Mosaic
    (Mosaic2.0-Xaw.tar.Z) and a sparc binary (Mosaic-sun-Xaw.Z)

5)  Needless to say I will ignore all questions and bug reports about this
    silly hacked version.  It is just proof of concept (or proof of idiocy).

6)  Huge thanks and Kudos to Gustaf Neumann, who is a GOD!  Gustaf DIDN'T
    whine, he actually modified the Mosaic2.0 HTML widget so it would compile
    with both Athena and Motif.  His patches will find their way into future
    releases of the HTML widget source to make it even EASIER for the rest
    of you worthless whiners to make a non-Motif version if you so choose.

This a Motif header file for the Motif version of the widget. I have not
been able to determinbe whether or not this file can be distributed
freely. Anyway, it still requires the Motif libraries. If you don't have
these then try commenting out the -DIS_MOTIF_WIDGET in the Makefile.
This should build a widget subclassed from Core.

   Some one ports Elk?  I'm tring.

   It can dynamic loading *.o once, but when a module calls other C
function which was dynamic loaded, then core dumps.  To call Scheme
function(written in C) is good. Then to run examples/xlib is OK, but
to run examples/xt is bad. 

   Another problem, When I linked Elk statically and to run examples/xt,
then the Elk says `inheritance ...', why ?

I think this was badly needed.  Thank you.  I have wondered how you
folks at NCSA had kept your composure (in public) up to now.
For years I have been using software provided freely by NCSA,
and have been very grateful for all of it.  I'm continually amazed
that you can keep providing it.  Thank you for that, as well.

Recipients of free software have no right to expect anything, except
perhaps, absence of malice.

May it be a long time before I see a Subject header with the word 'Motif'
in it.

Subject: Lots more stats in /proc aka /proc/loadavg
Date: Mon, 6 Dec 1993 14:55:21 GMT

I have written patches to Linux to include 

        o       /proc/swapavg (number of pages swapped per second) 
        o       /proc/bufavg (number of disk reads and cache hits).  

They both have 1, 5 and 15 minute decaying averages, like loadavg.

My questions are:

Does this sound useful to other people, and would a plethora of other
similar statistics soon appear?  Should I make a separate /proc/stats
directory and put the statistics there, add some more stats (what would
be good?) then post the diffs?

In fact, this note DOES speak for NCSA and the Mosaic development team. Your
savage, petulant and whiney posting gives great reason for concern over the
status of the Mosaic project in fact. When you've grown up you'll realize that
your outburst is highly innapropriate.

NCSA is not some private corporation, you do realize this don't you? It is
paid for by the taxpayers money and should be responsive to the needs of the
community it is intended for. If those people (your underwriters and audience)
are complaining, you need to hear that and respond. If you want to do your
own thing then start your own company with your own capital. In the meantime
you work for us. 

There are very valid reasons that we don't want to spend our money having
people like you develop for a platform that will require us to spend even
more money on Yet Another Library. There may be reasons that you feel you
need to do so anyways... These should be communicated effectively and without
insults of the type you sling about to your paying customers/clients..

Come on, this requires exactly TWO calculations:

        Hsync = (dot-clock in Hz) / (Htotal)
        Vrefresh = (Hsync in Hz) / (Vtotal)

Where Htotal and Vtotal are the 4th numbers from the horizontal and
vertical groups, respectively.

I disagree.  I think was rude and served only to vent his spleen at the

It's called "self control", and it seems to be in short supply at NCSA.

I agree.

Hogwash.  The producers are free to ignore their customers desires at their
own peril, but users are free to ask for or expect whatever they want.  (If
they don't get what they expect, they're also free to stop using the
product, find one that does meet their needs, hack the code, etc.)  It's
called "feedback", and most implementors appreciate it even if they 
can't make everyone happy.

It didn't. The acutal idea is from a comp.unix.shell FAQ or
some such posting which I read over a year ago and I just

Yes - I'm interested. I've always wanted a BSD like 'vmstat' command,
but there isn't one (that I'm aware of) for Linux. Anyone out there writing
one? I haven't got the time.... anyone 'ported' vmstat... ??

Maybe you could write one which uses the /proc info, instead of reading
a kernel data structure.

Anyone?

Statistics are lots of fun, and it may be interesting, how swapping
activity gets high, when you start gcc under X windows, with only
4 MB of RAM.  However, xload may gets slow displaying the results,
because it is involved in paging itself :-)

Other interesting things would be (my point of view):
- a monitor of buffer cache hit/miss ratio.
- a monitor of buffers getting dirty


Every of these slows done the kernel, though.  If possible, add

        #ifdef CONFIG_EXTENDED_STATS
        ...
        #endif

around your code.  You can use the patch command to do this for
you.

>Should I make a separate /proc/stats
>directory and put the statistics there, add some more stats (what would

I would not bother about where you put them in the /proc tree -
people will tell you, if you made a bad choice.  Please leave
/proc/loadavg where it is, because several programms expect it
there.  If you create a /proc/stats directory, you could make
/proc/stats/loadavg be the same as /proc/loadavg.
