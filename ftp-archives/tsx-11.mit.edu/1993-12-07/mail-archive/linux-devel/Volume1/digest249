Here is how I understand streaming tape drives.

Every controller/drive has X memory for a buffer.  Now, if this buffer
is filled, the controller sends a "STOP!" and tells you AFTER all the
data is written to start again.  Once the data is written, the controller 
stops the drive itself waits Y time (milliseconds I believe) and starts to
rewind the tape back for a running start for the next read/write command.
[Note: this happens only (usually) if no commands are executed in those
Y time periods].

As you can guess, THIS IS bad for performance.  It doesn't matter HOW
big your buffer is (in the computer).  Your software and the controller
MUST sync themselves so this "back tracking the heads" doesn't
happen very offen.  I have an algorithm for this very thing floating
around my roon [Lord, help us find it :)].  I believe you can find it
in the "Software: Experiences and Practices", July '93.

Hope this helps,
Dan

P.S.  If you can convince tar how to sync like this, I'd be interesed in
knowing.  (Note: I do not have a tape backup system so I can't write
the software to do this..... :)

Does windoze boot from a floppy, too?  You want to query your card
about its graphics mode settings, and these can only be achieved
by switching it into that mode.  For example, my ET4000 card came
with a driver for windows.  Installing it was lots of work.  Without
installing it, windows just gets you standard EGA, 640x480 and 16
colours or something like that.

But DOS supports a semi-standard interrupt to switch VGA modes.
Semi-standard, because not all cards support all modes.  We could
write a small DOS executable, which allows to switch the modes,
and then call a "safe registers" function when you like a certain
mode.

This register values could then be printed out in a format suitable
for including into the Xconfig file.

I got the Bustek BT742A, which is the BT747S predecessor.  Anyway, I
don't think there is such a thing such as enhanced mode on the
BT742A, like what the Adaptec AHA 1742 has.  I does have a 32-bit
addressing mode which requires software switching to.  The 32-bit
addressing mode allows the mailbox structure to be 32-bit (4 
gbytes addresses) instead of the standard AHA1542B 24-bit mailbox
address.  IMHO, the BT742A is an exact clone of the AHA 1542, except
that the speed is very fast.  I don't think there will be any speed
increase when it is switched to 32-bit addressing mode.

Are you able to get this drive working under DOS?  You may want to
give Buslogic tech support a call.  I think there may be some hardware
incompatibility there.

You will no doubt find that full-duplex using this method will be unworkable.. 
The one second delay will be fed back into the microphone, sent to the other
machine, fed back into the microphone etc etc etc.. until you get some very
annoying sounds. 

I think radio really is your best option.

Then we must assume you haven't ``seen'' the Motif spec.  The are dozens 
of things in motif that aren't in Athena, not the least of which are
lots of widgets that have no counterpart in Athena, and traversal.

Unless your definition of ``accomplish'' is to ``completely reprogram and
then accomplish''.

Nope, but my ET4000/W32 (and every other ET4000 card I have ever seen) comes
with a program called DMODE, which can be used to set the mode. When I
installed OS/2, it called this program to allow me to set the refresh rate.
After the program terminated, OS/2 read the registers and saved them for 
later use ...

Subject: DLL under Linux
Date: 22 Nov 1993 12:20:37 GMT

Hi Linuxers,

Does anyone know how to make dll libraries under Linux
(such as lib!@@!.so.#.#)?

If you read the Makefile produced by xmkmf and imake
you can see the following line:

DLLBIN = /usr/dll/bin

and gcc would be called with '-B/usr/dll/bin' but I can't find
this special feature on my disk (neither on nets!).

You can find an example of this in the distribution of
libXpm-3.2.#. The author uses /usr/dll/bin!!!

Help,
Gildas.

But please don't forget that these staticaly linked executables do
not only need more space on disk, but also need more virtual memory
when executiing. And this means a lot more swapping, if the user does
not upgrade main memory capacity. That is going to be especialy a
Problem e.g. on Suns with 16 MByte running Solaris 2.x on on 4-8 MByte
Linux systems.
If you have a graphic library which is shared, you can easily add features,
increasing the size of this library. All the code is shared between all
processes using this library. This makes the "look and feel" of all
applications hopefully better and consistant. But if you have to think
of memory, you will double check every feature before including it. Let's
take the open look text editing widget as an example: This widget has a
popup menu on the right mouse button with all the function of a text
editor (load, save, cut, paste, find, ...). You will find these functions
in every application using this widget. So, if you have a find & replce
dialog box in a text editor, you can, for example, load the replacement
string from a file, you prepared before. A nice feature, if you need it,
but you normaly would not implement this feature.
So I would prefer using one probably large, but shared, library
implementing the widget set instead of using libraries reduced to the
absolute needs of the application. The user, who is familliar with the
"look and feel" of the widget set will thank you.

There are also lots of features in the Athena set that have no counter
part in Motif!  It depends on the application as to which might be easiest.

Personally, I prefer to use Tk.  Its easier, smaller, faster (adverb

What about the ones who can't afford to lay out $10k every two years to buy
a spiffy new, faster workstation?  You must not have to use diskless
Sun 3/50's, but lots of people do.

The real point is that it isn't affordable.  Binary-only releases have too
