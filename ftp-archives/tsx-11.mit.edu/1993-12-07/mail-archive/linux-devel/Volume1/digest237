I believe someone at CMU developed an ftp file system which might work with
ftp+term.  I keep thinking I will look at it but have had no time.  I
believe it may have been posted to one of the source groups.

Can someone give me a value I could feed to ioctl to put the vga card
into bios mode 12 (640x480 with 16 colors)?  The header file I have just
says something like "should add more VGA modes"...

Not practical?  We use nothing but statically linked Motif binaries on many of our projects.

It needs to go in as a block device driver (that is, in
linux/drivers/block).  You could probably use ramdisk.c as a model; it
is only 180 lines to it is easy to understand.  Call it ems.c or
something like that.

The swap devices are used in the order swapon'ed.  Hence, make sure
you swapon your /dev/ems before /dev/realdisk.  If you use swapon -a
it is in the order specified in the fstab file.

First of all, I do not have Linux yet, but am paying attention because
I intend to buy a machine that I will install Linux on.  That said...

If you have two programs, `play' and `record', which do the obvious
things from standard input and from standard output (respectively),
and you want to talk at your machine "beavis" and have it come out on
another machine "butthead", all that you need to do is:

beavis% record | rsh butthead play

and it will work.

In fact, if /dev/audio (or the equivalent) can be `cat'ed to/from it,
you can just do this (without even the record/play programs):

beavis% cat /dev/audio | rsh butthead cat \> /dev/audio

Note the needed `\' character.

The latter is what we do on our Sparc10's at work.

If there is no `rsh' program on Linux, something is really wrong.

Remember, in UNIX (and by extension, Linux) one should never write a
program when a long string of filters will work.

Device drivers at the user level turn out to be a really bad idea
due to context switching.

You sound like Fred Van Kempen.  Some things need to be optimized,
notably devices and interfaces (such as file systems and the network
layer).

Boy, what a marvelously bad idea.  I don't suppose /tmp sprang to mind,

   Actually, this is the correct behavior, since the function in the
inhertied class hides the initial definition in the base class. As the
previous poster said, this can prevent  many problems and helps you to
explicitly define what you want in cases where the potential ambiguity can
lead to wrong decissions by the compiler (if you let it decide).

   This will help you avoid potential bugs, and your code will also be
cleaner.

It is not the money (well, that too), it is the freedom.

Motif is not free software, which mean it is not possible to

There are at least a few systems out there which seem to have
implemented loadable drivers successfully.  Can anyone comment on
QNX's or MACH's loadable devices ?  

Also, there was recently a discussion on comp.unix.internals about
implementing network drivers as user processes.  The results published
(in a paper to which I no longer have references, sorry) seemed to
achive at least acceptable, although not stellar performance.

Those statically linked binaries may or may not be practical, but the  
continue to be a reality on many implementations of Unix that do not
yet have a dynamic loader.  They will also remain in around for every
software vendor that does not want to rely on not knowing what version
of X and Motif the customer is running. (There is nothing worse than
spending man days on a customer problem to only find out that they are
20 patches behind the rest of the X world.)  

Statically linked images will continue to be around for a while.

And as one person in the founding X/Xt community once said - all
dynamic load implementations are broken, its just a question of how
badly.

Ehmmm...
I dunno, but I remember it beeing the other way 'round. Statically linked
is ok to distribute under the OSF license. Dynamically linked binaries are
taboo. 

I am sorry for adding another rumor, but I can not find the license right
know. How about posting the current one (and *if* it has changed the old
one) here for anybody to read/interpret? 

Some time ago there was a thread going on about the GPL and what it *really*
means. Everybody got really hyped up for nothing.

How about some *real* information?
