I would suggest that MIB is not at all desparate about this, since the
solution, for him and other, already exists. Why should he change
anything if he doesn't want to?
I would also suggest that having a simpler user interface is fairly
important, so long as the features being added are appropriate.

Because the feature as you suggest it is annoying and inefficient. If
I am archiving things that I know are larger than the media I am
writing to, I don't particularly want to make a bunch of small chunks,
and attempt to figure out where the tape is going to end in relation to
the chunks when the program can figure out where it ends on the fly
and make just one break in just one file.

Maybe I am just not as clever as you, but I fail to understand how
this would be a great deal more efficient or coherent than the way it
is being done now.

But Fortunately, you're in luck!!! This code is under the GPL, so you
can take it, rip out the multi-volume stuff, and put in the splitter
support, and release it! 

I know I'll be looking forward to it!

Yuk Foo.

This is a typical Unix Laziness.  It seems to me were talking about a
Statically liked binary of less than 100K in either case.  The
intelligent thing to do would be to COMBINE the programs into one.  I
mean face it.  Were talking about some pretty simple concepts with
different options, but basically they are dumping information onto some
medium in a combined format.  What other types of tools will need
"Multi-Volume" support pray tell?  I'd like to see a SINGLE binary hard
linked to pax,tar,cpio, and whatever else that handles _all_ of the
issues that may come up, INCLUDING compression & the like.

There is also no law that says a SINGLE binary cannot call
(transparently) other system routines, NOR are there any laws against
building archive routine LIBRARIES callable from 'C' either.  The only
problem with the former is that a single binary may not be distributable
on it's own and the latter may swell your binaries slightly.  I'd still
bet a single binary for _all_ exchange formats would take less _space_
than multiple binaries with dependent filters and such.

Finally there is the issue of maintenance.  It is a pain in the ass to
maintain multiple binaries, ESPECIALLY when there are defined
interactions between them (Can you say libc.so.XXXX).  A slight change
in one section of your pipe and _NOTHING_ works anymore.  Swell.

Here is what I would like to see:

C library functions for gzip style compression, perhaps as a stream
filter:

FILE *f;

FILE gzip_fopen(char *name, char *mode);
int gzip_fclose(FILE *stream);

and function for memory block compression too:

/* returns new size */
long gzip_mem(void *target, static void *block, long *size);

Once the _library_ is standardized you eliminate duplicate coding
efforts, and changes to non-shared libraries won't affect already
existing binaries.

Hmmm,  Maybe something _I_ could even accomplish.

Hi,

   I may be the only person telneting to a Linux box so perhaps I am the first
to notice this problem:

   For some reason, ^J (newline) is ALWAYS getting mapped to ^M^J on output!
That is, watch:

The file `junk' is supposed to display as:

line 1
      line 2
            line 3

The `\n' char is getting mapped to `\r\n'!!!  This problem only manifests
itself if I telnet into the linux machine and it does not occur on the
console.  It also does not occur if I telnet to other Unix machines.

This problem is driving me crazy!  I am running Linux 0.99.14 but I
experienced the same problem with 0.99.13.  I looked in the man page for
telnetd.  It talks about the CRMOD bit being set. Perhaps that is a clue.

Thanks again.  Other than this, my Linux system is working like a dream.

I had some problems with pl14 and the e2fs-progs that were advertised
around here a day or so ago. I had to reinstall anyway and this time left
the e2fsprogs stuff in the box. It seems to be running fine using the pl14
kernel and the e2fs stuff from the Slackware release that had pl13r in it.

The problems I had related to e2fs telling me constantly about bits that
were already clear.

Subject: Do any PC or Amiga SCSI adapters use the  NCR53c700 (nee 710, etc)
Date: Thu, 2 Dec 1993 06:26:27 GMT

I'm currently developing a Linux SCSI driver for the NCR53c700/800
series of SCSI chips.  

For some of the features I'll be supporting (ie, different synchronous 
speeds used for different targets), the code for the NCR53c700 and 
NCR53c700-66 is hackish and I don't like it (Ie, I need to halt the 
SCSI SCRIPTS(tm) processor, interrupt the host processor, have the host 
processor twiddle bits, and restart the script).  

The newer chips (the NCR53c710, 720, 810, and 820) have a more 
reasonable microcontroller on board, with an ALU, the ability to read and 
write chip registers, etc. which will let me handle most of the ugly 
situations (the different synchronous settings for different targets, 
SAVE POINTERS / RESTORE DATA POINTER messages, etc) within my SCSI SCRIPTs
(tm). 

So, If there are PC or Amiga SCSI boards using the NCR53c700 or NCR53c700-66
rather than the newer chips, I'll make an effort to provide alternate SCSI 
SCRIPTS (tm) for those chips and to keep the extra intelligence in the Linux 
code needed to deal with them.

If not, I won't waste any more time keeping my code compatable with the 
NCR53c700 and NCR53c700-66.

It's possible to autoIRQ on a parallel port only if you can control what's
hooked up to it.  To sense the interrupt line you must "twinkle" the interrupt
and see which line the interrupt comes in on.  

On the ISA bus undriven interrupt lines float high, and interrupts occur on a
low-to-high transition.  Interrupt lines can be "shared" (in a mutually
exclusive sense) by having the device isolate it's interrupt input from the
with a "line driver".

With some devices you can clear the interrupt sources, enable the interrupt
line driver to drive the IRQ line low, and then disable the interrupt line
driver to let the IRQ line float high and generate an interrupt.  But for this
to work you need some way to clear the interrupt source, but you can't
reliably do that unless you know something about what's hooked up to the
printer port.

For a concrete example, my 'ATP' pocket ethernet adaptor driver can autoIRQ
the printer port but that same code wouldn't be reliable without the device
hooked up.  (You could still try it of course, but the driver would have to
be ready to fall back to polled-I/O if it failed.)

Yes, the 3c501 probe could potentially confuse other devices, but the same is
true for most other device probes.

If you are asking how to make the 3c501 probe a range of addresses, it's
simple: just add the additional addresses to the list at the start of
el1_probe().  I put only 0x280 on the list because (1) that's a common
ethercard location*, (2) the 3c501 can be jumpered to any 16 byte I/O region
and probing them all _would_ cause havoc, and (3) who would use a 3c501, let
alone more than one?

* 0x300 is the other popular ethercard location, but SCSI drivers like to hang
out there too.

Are you actually using a 3c501 with Linux?

I've never heard of this chip.  What does the motherboard manual say about the

The kernel is numbered "pl1"... up to (currently) "pl14".  The "pl" stands for
Perfect Linux.  Some people jokingly prepend "0.99", but that's only an inside
joke.

The 3c503 would be insulted to be called the brother of the 3c501.  While
the DP8390 controller used on the 3c503 board has a few bugs, the 3c501 is
more like a bug surrounded by a board.  And the worst part is that 3Com
products are built so well that the 3c501 boards _just_won't_die_.

An amusing story: locally someone has a "power machine".  It's a EISA DX2-66
with 64M of memory, a SCSI-2 controller, a huge disk, a big monitor, etc.
(Just the memory for this machine costs significantly more than the fastest
Linux box I work with.)  What did they use for the network connection?  A
3c501 that was sitting around.  That's like putting $30 tires on a Ferrari.
(Of course, this box is hardly ever used.)

Not in the LEAST bit accurate.

        I just tried to follow your history step by step on my 0.99pl14 +
ext2fs-0.4, and I have no problem. Are you shure, that there is nothing else
wrong here?

   2) The Software Developer statically binds in the Motif "Runtime Copy" (as

     There are three variants:

     [...]

     B. Developer is a Full Distribution Rights Licensee of OSF/Motif or has a 
        University Site License.  

        License Reqs.:     The application distributed by the licensee 
                           (developer) may be installed on any system, 
                           whether or not the system already has a Motif 
                           license.  
        Royalty Reqs.:     No royalties will be due OSF in this instance.

Guess what?  Everyone who implied otherwise over the last couple of
weeks has been DEAD WRONG.  Congratulations, all.
