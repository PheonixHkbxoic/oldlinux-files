I know of CAP.  I looked at the source that we had (pre 60) and it only
supported the Ethernet port as far as I could tell.  Also, it seems
that it only handles EtherTalk phase 1 and not phase 2.

I may be seriously mistaken, but this is my last checking.  I think
it is high time I take a look at it again.  Perhaps a port to Linux
could be a fun thing to do.

Amen....

In the midst of this totally insane discussion and despite the fact that the
OSF lawyers are the most difficult people to deal with in my professional
career (well maybe except for the accounting people at CA), I would like to
make a few simple points:

Mosaic is an exceptionally well designed application and is almost perfectly
targeted. It is impacting our world in ways more important than all the
previous free stuff that computer weenies -- including me 8-) -- have done,
used, etc. I applaud the work done at NCSA and hope like hell it continues.

In terms of their choice of Motif, there was simply no other rational choice.
In the GUI world it isn't good enough to have a good look and feel, it has to
be the same look and feel as the other tools you use. Almost every commercial
tool for X11 is Motif or going to be Motif. Anyone who suggests that this was
a poor choice has no grip on the thousands of "just plain users" that folks
like me have to consider.

I do not want to depend on somebody's spare time project designed with the
highest priority on eliminating any possibility of a royalty. I want a well
designed application built to fit in with everything else that I have to use.
I believe that I can depend on Mosaic and the information system strategies we
are taking will depend on Mosaic. Keep at it guys...

Guys, this is getting really lame.  Check the names of the groups you

it ever did).  I suspect people in the rest of that oversize list of

Can't you guys take this somewhere else? This "discussion" is turning into
a contest of wills.

To the TAMU INSTALL users:

  YOU ARE NOT GOING TO WIN. GIVE IT UP.

  You can not dictate to some one else what they must or must not do. If you
don't like XFree86 in the manner that it is offered, then get the X11R5
sources, and make your own package. Then, you may do your own server
implementation and have it do your own auto-configuration.

  You have made your REQUEST to the XFree86 group. Unfortuntely, it was not
accepted. It is very doubtfull that it will ever be accepted by the current
set of developers. Accept it as fact of life.

To the XFree86 people:

  Please do not judge all users of your package by a vocal few. Recognize
that every group of users (for any piece of software/hardware, whatever) has
a few who believe that their way is THE ONLY way.

  However, recognize that people will use the script. It is not in your
ability to prevent them from doing so. You have stated the reasons why it is
not a good idea. That is as far as you can go. Please let it drop there.

So you think that I am silly and way off base because I don't want
to promote a "closed" propieratory GUI and you want to counter
by saying "tough luck". Perhaps we should step up the heat to
a higher management  level where we can carry a more intellectual 
and perhaps meaningful discussion.

Actually, one of the points that I wanted to make is that your
so called project will have been a bit more expensive to carry
out with Motif if you didn't enjoy the university's motif license.

Look I like mosaic if it means anything to you.

So go back to your "ivory tower" and keep on writing "beautiful"
Motif programs.

The key words here are "as defined in the license supplement", which
uses a quite different from what most people would consider.  Only
certain of the Motif libraries are considered "runtime copies"; the
other ones are called "royalty-bearing copies" or something like that.

Sorry for taking so long to get the final word out.  I had an
overwhelming number of responses, mostly me too's.  So here's the
problem:  CAP relied on the Bekrkeley Packet software, and must operate
in the promiscus mode.  This means that all packets must be looked at,
and not filtered by the Net2 code.  (If I'm wrong on this, e-mail me. 
This is what I got from about 20 messages)

Well, it looks like Linux needs the Berkeley Packet filter added.  This
has to be done by someone who knows the kernel and the networking code.  

CAP (Columbia Appletalk Package?) also could stand some enhancements. 
Mainly, Ethertalk phase 2, and TCP/IP to Ethertalk routing.  This would
let Linux be a gateway from the Mac world.


For those interested, I have CAP (patch 140) working on NetBSD 0.9, but I
have to use the CISCO router as the gateway.  This has to be specified in
both the Mac clients and NetBSD, but it's no big deal.  If the routing
function is added to the CAP code, the CISCO would not be needed.


Thanks to the many folks who responded, I will try to send personal
messages when time permits.

(Do we need to go through this tread again...?)  The kernel has code
for handling a single information filesystem.  Since its initial
purpose was to aid debugging by showing process statistics, it was
named to "process filesystem" and mounted on /proc.  Then someone
thought about adding system-wide statistics, and realized a lot of the
same code could be used, so he added it to the same file system to
avoid unneccesary kernel bloat.

Besides, having a single mount point gives users less opportunity to
be "creative" and screw things up.  There is already a lot of programs
who have /proc/... as a hardcoded path which fails if you mount it on,
say, /sys.  Imagine four or five info-filesystems, all which can break
a program if they are mis- or unmounted.
