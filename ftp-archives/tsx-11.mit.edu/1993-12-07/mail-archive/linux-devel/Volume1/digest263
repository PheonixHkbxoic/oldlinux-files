I'm planning a computer system and will want to have Lunix, with source, 
Xfree, and a reasonable set of development tools available.

How much disk space should I have?

Have you thought through your request?
Let's take a specific example: GNU diff.
It has many features that traditional diff doesn't.
Which of these features would you remove, and why?

Well, I've never seen a monitor get fried by teeaking with the monitor
settings.  I have seen OS/2 and other pieces of software do this trick to
calc frequencies.  Under this logic, we should all quit using OS/2 and

Err no, ( maybe at Uni sites tho )

Still, End user Motif packs are relatively (?) cheap and you get a 
license whenever you buy one.
Quantity purchasers will get price breaks depending on the number they buy
( and it may be that its cheaper to extend and existing Site/Educational 
license or something )

In the UK, academic institutions can join the CHEST scheme and for a ( fixed ?)
yearly fee get unlimited licenses.

I believe Sun are negotiating with OSF for a platform license after which case
you will be able install any motif linked app on the platform they've paid for.
( same as for IBM and HP platforms now ).

Its not ideal but it seems reasonably fair.

Perhaps this is an avenue you have already explored, but have you retrieved
the man pages from sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/docs/LDP ?  I have found
this and the LDP publications a very very good source of information and
IMHO, far better written than the documentation produced by some commercial
Unix vendors for their high priced and (again IMHO) less functional *nix
implementations.  But then, if one pays $5000.00 or more for a *nix system
then one also purchases the privilege to complain about the documentation?
I personally LIKE having the source to go to to find out what's really going
on and where I have misinterpreted something!

        To all the developers and LDPers goes my unending praise and 
respect for their knowledge and efforts.  It is most appreciated.

        Sincerely,
        Mark

Just enough to break things... I've seen it happen.  Some color terminals *do*
do it that way... and some broken programs assume the terminal does it that
way... and *both* have resulted in garbled screens.

But how can a program do the *right* thing?  Is there an ESC sequence that
returns the default attributes?  Take `less', `most', or any other paging
program, for example.  How can it be fixed so that the colors of the screen are
properly restored when it exits?  It gets its information from termcap and
termcap says use ^[[m to turn off bold.

Do you see any line like

        -lXaw.5 => /usr/X11R5/lib/libXaw.so.5.0 ?

So you see, twm does not use Atena Widgets.

The real Problem is _NOT_ using Motif or Xaw. Motif offers the minimum of a
GUI consistence, Xaw is small and fast, but there is not a trace of the
consistence, that make a GUI easy to use. Take a look at several Xaw applications.
There is a horrible mix of concepts, how to use these programs. If these programs
have a menu bar, sometimes there are single buttons in it, sometimes there are
pulldown menus. If you take a look on xfig, you can see an application, which is
not intuitive to use at all. There are no selection tools, but all the editing
funtions are implemented modal (like in ACAD). Who the hell should know how
to use this application? This is _not_ only the fault of the programmer of xfig,
but also the fault of the missing toolkit concepts we (the programmers) can follow.
The are e.g. Open Look Application Style Guidelines, that describe the concepts to
follow when building an application. The knowledge of these concepts, which are almost
the same on _all_ GUI's including MS-Windows, Macintosh, Openlook and Motif, is not as
known to the programmers as the knowledge how to produce a window with buttons in in.

The only think I can hope for is the inclusion of an usable widget set or class library
in a future release of X.

Mario

P.S. I know a lot of people who are using xfig. So I know, this program is not useless.

Well, it is about the difference between the libxx.sa.y.z and libxx.a files.
But there are lots of symbols in these files. So you have to cut of these
symbols when you want to compare.

Of people who do serious software development one should expect this

Isn't it ironic that prices of the OS are dropping, but soon everyone
will be forced to spend more money on a tiny part of the system,
the Motif widget set, than on the rest of the GUI (the rest of X11 is
free) and even than on the rest of the operating system. I think this
is unacceptable.

For large institutions and companies, who used to be the traditional
users of Unix/X11, this $400 doesn't make much difference; but for the
mass market for personal use it does. If you want to see MS-DOS etc.
replaced by an open operating system then a (commercial) Motif cannot
be part of it. This might cause a market-failure for desktop Unix and
thus give leave the desktop to MS-Windows or its descendants while
there is a real chance now to change this.

This is the good point of view.

If an electronic set (Monitor, Video generator, washing-machine 10 BogoMips),
made to be used by any end-user, can be destroyed just because you turned
the wrong switch, then it is ill-designed.

If, for example, the components of an oscillator may burn over some frequency,
then first this oscillator should not be adjustable to it, and even if it
is, some protection must stop the power before any problem occur.

That is just how, more than 20 years ago, I have been teached electronics 
engineering... Things have changed now... Good things: We have fantastic
integrated circuits. Bad things: There are more and more Mac Donald's 
"restaurants" here France :-))

Imagine your TV-set destroyed just because you tried to display
an NTSC video tape on a PAL monitor: This is  what happens^H^H^H^H^H may
happen  whith XFree86, and the PC-Compatible hardware.

Translate this to a software point of view: Imagine a function to get
characters from the keyboard in your program, allowing to enter some values
which makes your program  hang...

        XFree86 is a really great software.
        The Tamu Xconfig file is an intelligent approach for helping people
        to get XFree working.  

        In my opinion, neither the people from the XFree86 team, neither the
        people from the Tamu config are responsible for destroying any
        hardware.

Ok, I know that the kind of software programming done whith the video cards
in XFree is like adjusting whith a screwdriver or a soldering iron, on the
other hand. Don't start a big thread and don't flame me by mail, It costs
me a lot of money...

I  just wanted to say that most of us accept 'hardware bugs' which are
never discussed, in the equipment we all PAY, and at the opposite we blame
the FREE software authors as soon as we don't like something in their work...

BTW, this thread should be moved in a more appropriate newsgroup I think now...
