Subject: X windows speed for XPutImage
Date: Thu, 11 Nov 1993 03:36:40 GMT

I keep running into serious problems with the speed of XPutImage
in X windows under Linux. I've checked the socket code in the kernel
and don't see anything blatantly wrong so I'm assuming its in the
X server or the libraries.

Symptoms:
 You write a 600X700 image at one time and wait several seconds
 for it to transfer to the X server, which then puts it on the screen
 in one second (slow video card). 

 You break this up into a bunch of individual writes and things
 work about twice as fast, but now your dealing with the communications
 overhead of 200 writes :(

Do any X people know what would cause this problem, and/or how to fix it?
I'm tempted to hack in larger socket buffers in the kernel, but thats
a silly way of solving it (and a waste of memory).

Subject: Maximum I/O thruput formula for a generic system?
Date: Thu, 11 Nov 1993 05:22:54 GMT

How would I go about finding out the maximum data thruput of a system based
on information from the hardware?

For example:  If I have a system the has foo harddrive with N ms access time and
T transfer rate, a bar bus type with BT transfer rate, Z MHz 486, etc.  

What is the theotritical Max data thruput?

I have an application brewing that will require a CONSTANT data thruput of 
of approx 1.77MB/s overall.  (with all system functions included)

I have an app that will be sending data out an I/O card at 177Kb/s.  I want to
read in data from another source (like a SCSI tape backup) at about 900K/s do
some processing and ship it out the 177K I/O port.  The 177Kb/s cannot be 
stopped, paused, or slowed so all the other transfers have to happen 
interleaved with the 177Kb/s stream.    

I read somewhere that the ISA bus rate is between 8MHz and 12MHz depending
on the system.
If one assumes that you can achieve 1/8 of the bus speed in Ave thruput then 
my system might be possible.  Is 1/8 a good assumption?

I realize that the above reads like ramblings of a someone that dosen't
really have concept of what he is doing and that's cause my idea is 
still taking shape.  

If any of you system gurus think you can help me come up with a good method
of estamating the ave thruput of a system then please e-mail me.

ufs IS BSD-FFS (at least as far as I know).

It looks to me as if the linux superblocks have to contain some
additional information about file sytem type etc. So I think it would
require some major restucturing of the fs code to have a linux-BSD-FFS
be compatible with ???BSD or SunOS.  And there might be a problem with
sector sizes and inode types.

With some reverse engineering the NetBSD file system utilities like
tunefs, newfs and fsck compile nicely on linux, though.

Crossposted to comp.os.linux.development, maybe someone there knows more
about this?

Subject: tty_io.c:copy_to_cooked
Date: 11 Nov 1993 11:25:46 GMT

Well, I'm tired and lazy, and so I asking instead of working it out
for myself..

I'm writing a tty line discipline (for networking), and I'd like to
offload a fair amount of work a user level daemon.

I'd planned to have the tty start up the line discipline, have the
user mode daemon start reading, and then the discipline will only pass
up what it can't handle...

Now, questions:

Is there a clean way to find out (from outside tty_io.c) if there is
any data in the write queue? Basically, I want to know if anything is
currently being sent. A cursory glance seems to indicate looking at
the write queue head and tail pointers is the way to go..

Is simply filling in
        ldisc.read = read_chan;
        ldisc.handler = my_handler;
and the having my_handler() invoke copy_to_cooked() on any data it
doesn't understand legal? will it do what I want? (i.e. only give the
user mode that data I don't understand?) I'm fairly sure this'll work,
but I'd like a 2nd opinion.

filling in
        ldisc.write = my_writer
means my_writer() will get invoked when ever the user mode calls
write()?

Lastly, anyone got any idea what sync serial devices look like from
the software end? (i.e. ISDN type stuff?)

I'm not that big of a programmer but I was wondering if it would be possible to

have 1001 times wanted to go to an xterm and type something like:

then go click my mouse on a window and have it appear on "the.other.machine" and

Is this possible?

Since I had some old benchmark software for testing the speed of writing
image data to a X display I thought I would run it on my linux box. The tests
write 256 x 312 and 798 x 936 8 bit pixel data to a a X window using one
XPutImage call. The results where 0.1156 and 1.85 seconds. My setup is
a 33 Mhz 486 sx ( Dell 433s/L ) with an ATI graphics ultra pro using
Xfree 2.0 Mach 32 accel setting. Maybe later today I will take out the
ATI card and test again using the ET4000 on the motherboard, my feeling
is that this may be faster for image transfers. If anybody would like to
try their setup with the benchmark code I would be willing to email you
the two programs and a makefile.

How about a linux box with n serial ports and ethernet, no console, no 
anything but act as a terminal server. I remember working with Bridge 
terminal servers that were just dedicated unix boxes. They booted off a 
floppy as I remember.  We used 'em to avoid trying to put >256 ports on 
a VME box - which was about as attractive as 30-50 serial ports on a 
linux box. Probably cheaper than buying a terminal server - anyone know 
what they cost these days? What would a floppy only, ethernet, and no 
console linux box cost? Of course I don't know if linux out of the box 
can run without the kbd and console, but then...

I had the exact same error messages (well I don't know if they are
exact, but they look pretty damn close) anyway I had similar messages
when I was most recently compiling 0.99.13, and my guess is that you
untarred 0.99.13 over an existing source tree of the linux kernel (as in
over the source tree /usr/src/linux found in the SLS release, and maybe
others).  What I did was untar 0.99.13 into a completely new source
tree, and compiled it from there.  No problems from that point on.

Why only eight?  I'm currently using two modems and a serial line,
having told one of the modems to use com3 (I forget which int.)  So at
least 24 should be possible, and probably 32.  No?
