CSI m           restores the terminals rendering attributes to defaults.
                This is standard.

CSI 8 ]         stores the current rendering attributes as defaults.
                This is unique to the Linux console driver.

The normal way to define colors for a virtual console is:

setterm -foreground <color> -background <color> -store > /dev/tty??

This is equivalent to the command sequence:

CSI 3 <color> m CSI 4 <color> CSI 8 ]

CSI means the command sequence introducer, ESC [

Check out the setterm man page for more info.

if you've got an IDE-Interface, that answers on any new IO-address, it's
quite possible to connect more IDE-Drives, but no more than two at one
Interface! (btw. every OS can access them with drivers for the new addresses)
Nevertheless, I've never seen an interface with changeable IO-addresses
and the interfaces with possibility connecting 4 IDE-drives are so expensive
that you might better buy a scsi-controller...

A soon to be release derivative of 386bsd will cost $40 for the CDROM 
and that includes X,gcc,kernel, tcp/ip,etc.. -- a fully functionable
system but of course is not going to have Motif.

Also Linux has a CDROM distribution -- they are advertising on the
latest issue of Byte and I am pretty sure that it does not have
Motif -- The Linux SLS CDROM distribution is also very low cost.

Both Linux and 386bsd CDROM distributions are cheaper than MS/DOS and 
Windows 3.1.

It is pretty safe to assume that is going to take a major effort
to provide motif for the masses and that we will most likely have
to either develop a Motif clone or deploy a new graphics standard.
Actually, Motif is just a component a good GUI builder is also 
needed for all of us. The equivalent of Visual C++...
Fortunately, ParcPlace has donated a binary distribution of uib to
both Linux and 386bsd. Yes, I am aware that there are commercially
available GUI builders;however, they just don't compete in terms
of cost to the full development systems like Symantec or Visual C++.

Since, Windows/NT requires more resources than the Unix systems now 
is the time to strike :-)

Perhaps with X11R6 things will get better...

Hmmm... Actually, something like Multi volume I/O is a good thing, in
my estimation. That's like adding cruise-control to a car for long
trips.

The point I am trying to make is the need to avoid feature that are
added strictly because it is a popular pipe.

One example would be to add a pager to tar for the -t option, so you
don't have to pipe the list through a pager. Maybe this is an extreme
example, but I can definately see it happening.

One must endeavor to ascertain a program's popular function, and code
within that boundary.

Tar(1) is for archival storage managment and backup. Ar(1) is for
library function archive management. It would not be appropriate for
Ar to deal with tapes, except on an abstract level (i.e. as a file
like /dev/rst0).

Cat(1) is a file movement program. It should not add to files, and
there is some question as to whether it should change them as in -e or
-v, but since it is traditionally used to display short files to the
user on terminals that might not accept > ASCII 127 characters, or
might freak out on < ASCII 32 characters, it is perhaps appropriate to
modify their display.

Any others? And what should a kernel do?

The termcap entry is wrong.  To turn off bold the sequence is \E[21m.  The use
of \E[m is a "bug" which is propagated for compatibility with older programs.

\E[21;22;24;25;27m turns off all attributes without affecting colors.

Note also that terminfo specifically describes the "sgr0" capability as
resetting background and foreground colors to the default for the terminal,
so the behavior of \E[m is appropriate for "sgr0".  ---But doesn't agree with
what most termcap-based programs expect for the equivalent operation.

That's right, Eric. As for the 1542C, you can stop the boot process with
CTRL-A to enter the adapter setup. This looks quite similar as the EISA setup
for the 1742A as far as negotiation and device interrogation is concerned. 
You can choose synchronuous transfer separately for every device. That's not
possible with the 1542B *sigh*.

Well, the DSP3160S should like it because it is a SCSI2 device. But, alas, 
even with the 3160 I didn't get more than:

I think he's saying that multi-volume I/O should be a separate filter instead
of an option added to tar, dd, cpio, etc.  Which makes sense; that way, if you
want to use some other program to read or write the tape/floppy/whatever, you
can use the filter to get multivolume I/O instead of having to hack it into
the program or trying to force tar/cpio/whatever to do what you want.  (Of
the programs mentioned, dd makes the most sense for a multivolume filter
because it's already a filter for modifying I/O, e.g. block sizes.)

>Cat(1) is a file movement program. It should not add to files, and

Um, no.  "cat" concatenates files onto its standard output stream.  "cp" and
"mv" are file "movement" programs.

Actually, this usage is something of a holdover from the days when a "tty" was
a KSR33...  It's appropriate for e.g. "more" or "less" to do this, though.

>Any others? And what should a kernel do?

That one's hard to call.  What a kernel should do depends on the market you're
aiming for; business users tend to need a lot more special kernel routines
than academic and research folks, which is one reason why SVR4 is so much
larger than V7 and (earlier?) BSD.  I tend to get into conflicts over this,
because while I myself prefer the minimalist approach, things which I can see
being provided as user mode daemons in the minimalist approach have a nasty
tendency to become major bottlenecks unless kernelized when the environment is
200 users querying a multi-million-record database...  (That last is going to
become a problem when Mach 3-based kernels start pusing into the DP arena.
If you wondered why Microsoft didn't make NT a true microkernel, now you
know.)

How do I change that "||" to a "&&" in binary, being a smaller change

Unless, of course, you want features in a multi-volume tar that can't
be implemented by using a filter, such as having a table-of-contents
on every volume so you can still recover after losing some of them,
especially the first one. Or, say, being able to mount just the
volume containing the one file you want to restore. Or being able to
compress the archive, have one bit flip in the first volume, and still
restore most of it.

You can pick great examples of things that should always be filters,
but industrial-strength full-featured multi-volume backups isn't it.

I don't see what the big difference is between calling the
enumerate lines program "enumerate" or "cat -n".  So a few
hundred more bytes of text get mapped, big deal.  Cat is
probably already mapped and "enumerate" probably isn't.

Nor do I see the problem with typing
"yes '' | awk '{print NR}' | head -100".  Why should I care
that its inefficient as long as it finishes before I can
release the enter key?

I'm getting cynical in my old age...

Dumb cards for 8 or 16 ports are available, too.

As for the connectors: My Fourport-clone uses an "octopus" cable, I
guess 8 ports could be done with RJ45-jacks, for 16 one will need some
kind of expansion box.

Err, sorry miscommunication there. I was going to say display, but I
think of "more" or "less" for that. I am referring to all such
programs which read a file and send it to stdout.

I am curious, what kind of kernal routines do business users use that
academic types wouldn't?

Beyond the database thingy mentioned above, isn't most of the rest
pretty much standard? 

As a side note, how efficient is Mach with disk access, compared to
other things?

It seems to me that businesses ought to consider hiring programmers to
make totally custom kernels if their business relies on fast
transaction management. Most of the computers can be standard boxes,
but the critical server should have the transaction requests built-in
to the kernel, along with the duplication and redundancy code for
safety and robustness. Then all you need is an extremely standard way
of making queries, and maybe a fast box with 512 Megs o' RAM. Not to
mention MUCH better magnetic media speeds.

Anyway, on with the show...
