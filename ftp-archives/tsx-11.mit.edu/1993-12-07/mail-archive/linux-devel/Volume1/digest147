I need to find out the programming details of the interface to the
Trident 8900CL video board.

See, I'm trying to interface the card to an old monitor that maxes out
at 62 Hz vertical - and the card comes up at 70 Hz.  All I want to do
is to write a little boot-time utility to click the dot-clock down one
notch, which should solve the problem.  Or maybe there are
other, simpler solutions I haven't thought of?

If somebody can either provide me with this info, or point me at it
(source files are fine) I would appreciate it.  

Please respond in email - probably not a subject of wide interest.

Yes, but there is still one major problem. We have to separate the
functionality from the user-interface, because we cannot use X alone.
To many users do not use X because of lack of memory - these are most
likely to be happy to use such a tool like we want to write.

I think we have to provide a curses-interface as well - how this can
be done we should discuss.

My thinking is like: use virtual-functions (late binding) to have the objects
communicate with the user with the apropriate methods for the selected
user-interface. 

ParcPlace have done this with Motif/Openlook - why
should we not add a curses-layer?

But we have to avoid blowing up our task to unsolvable complexity, this
is what makes me uneasy :)

Yes, this is what I wanted to do with the usermaintanement-stuff which
should use shadow-passwd-files and add the gui-fields if shadow is
detected - but as well work without and not bother about shadow-features.


Maybe we should create a mail-channel for this topic? If enough users
and developers are interested...

Please let me know...

Mhm, now that I read just another load of follow-ups, I think it would be 
good to create a language as someone proposed.

This would describe screens, and actions, acting on curses and X in the
same script...

The advantage is clear: many users can contribute their configuration-
scripts and do not have to bother to much with the userinterface.

Only - this I think I cannot do - it is to big a task. 

If someone can do such a great thing, I think I would retreat to using
the language creating some scripts - if not, I think we should stick
to the OI/uib-stuff.
While xview is nice, I think OI is much more real
ObjectOriented - and it is more easy to provide two userinterfaces
using the same functionalitycode with true objects...

It's a gcc 'feature'. 2.4.5 is a bit better about it. Since you should be
loading bitmaps and cursors not compiling them in I think it serves you

Trying to build secure setuid tcl/tk programs is not fun nor do I consider

OI/OB is a little slow with 8M of memory, granted, but there are some
simple things that can be done to improve compile times.  First, you
can compile things -O rather than -g.  Odd as it sounds, this causes
much smaller binaries to be produced and is a net win in terms of
time.  Second, if you just include those .H files from the classes you
need it will also improve compile time, since cpp will spend less time
spinning its wheels.  Finally, if you run fewer, smaller X things it
will be faster because g++ tends to like large images.

One problem is that uib generates files that include all of OI
(OI/oi.H) by default.  If you hack these, it takes quite a bit less
time to compile the stuff.

Many times you don't even need to bother to recompile anything.  If it
is an interface change, nine times out of ten, you just save the .cf
file and you are ready to roll.  Sounds like a big win to me.

I'm in the process of uploading oimem.tar.gz to tsx-11
packages/OI/contrib right now to show what I mean.  This is a quick
and dirty memory monitor that I wrote to show how quickly you can turn
these things out (my brother asked for it one morning, and he had it
by that afternoon).

I've found this entire discussion very ironic, since the first thing
that I did when I started at Solbourne in the OI group was to start
work on some system administration tools.  I'd love to see what you
folks have in mind.  If someone could drop me a .cf file, I'd be happy
to take a look at it and give my feedback.

I'm looking for ways to reduce the compile times of the OI library
when using g++ on Linux.  I noticed the #pragma interface in the g++
man page and was wondering if that would help.  Have people out there
tried the #pragma interface/#pragma implementation stuff with g++ and
Linux?  How much faster are compiles?  How much smaller are binaries?
Is it generally worth the effort?  What sort of % decreases in size
and speed of compile should I expect?

It's for things just like this that I wrote a patch for Linux
to implement secure setuid shell scripts.  The `tclsh' shell doesn't
appear to have any security problems (although I've only read the man
page, not the source), so secure tcl programs don't sound too hard
to me. [I don't have enough experience with tk to comment about the
security of tk programs.]

Reply-To: reynolds@biner.horizon.com

We are running Linux SLS 1.03 on a 486 PC and are having the following
problems:

1) Shared memory in linux

Does anyone know if shared memory works under linux?  I am making
calls to shmget(2) and get errno=13 which reads "Permission denied".  
I do not have the "normal" shared memory tools (eg ipcs) available
under SunOS which would help me out if it is a permission thingy.

2) Undefines in /usr/include/bsd include files

I am including a file /usr/include/bsd/sgtty.h, and it has the define..
                #define ioctl   bsd_ioctl
However the compiler complains that bsd_ioctl is an undefined symbol.
I cannot find where it is defined anywhere in /usr/include.  In fact, the
ONLY reference to it is in /usr/include/bsd/sgtty.h (see above). 


Any help on the above problems would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

Subject: Use of gdb for kernel debugging: an idea
Date: Thu, 7 Oct 93 19:28:33 GMT

        I had posted before that I have used:

gdb /usr/src/linux/tools/system /dev/core

        on a kernel compiled with -g in order to examine kernel
variables. However it couldn't modify them; i.e. if I did "set foo=5"
it would say "Cannot access memory at 0xbar", where bar equals &foo.
Now could one patch gdb to instead of doing a direct write, instead
lseek on /dev/kmem (is this right, or should one use /dev/mem), and do
a write(fd, &value, sizeof(value)), where value is the value being
assigned to the variable? Would this be really hard?

Hi, what sorts of debuggers are available for Linux, besides gdb? Anything

Are there any docs besides the man-pages and internal help of gdb, on how
to use gdb, something like a FAQ?

What sorts of tools are there for inspecting the insides of core files. 
Anything that reads the core file through, and prints out a summary report

I'm trying to create the following structure:

struct foo {
  unsigned char a; // 1 byte
  unsigned b : 4; // 4 bits
  unsigned c : 4; // 4 bits
  unsigned long d; // 4 bytes

For a total of 6 bytes. Unfortunately, gcc is insisting on aligning
the various fields to at least two bytes (a and b/c are being aligned
on word boundaries, I believe).

This wouldn't be a big deal if THE GCC MANPAGE LISTED THE 80X86 OPTIONS
FOR GCC!! 
 
I refuse to declare it as a character array because the bloody compiler
is supposed to do this kind of thing for me.  

So, could someone who knows please email me the appropriate option or
suggestions?

Thanks.

Okay, that's strike one.  SIGSEGV is the "Segmentation Violation"
signal, meaning you poked your nose where it doesn't belong.
This isn't necessarily a page fault; it could be a literal
segment violation (limit or permissions, like writing to CS).
If you dereference NULL in a QMAGIC binary, or write to memory
outside your brk, *then* it'll be caused by a page fault, but
it won't be a page fault handler.  Page faults are serviced by
the kernel, with no intervention from the user process.

If you were in the kernel, you would read CR2.  Since you're not,
it's not a valid question.
