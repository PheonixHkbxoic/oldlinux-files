In your opinion.  I haven't seen anything that I like more.  NeXTStep,
Macintosh, Xaw, Xw, etc. all included.  I believe Motif was chosen
from several dozen (maybe more?) entries to the OSF.

I don't know what you mean by that.  Most of the Motif applications I
have seen have been much faster than OpenLook applications, although
the Motif Window Manager seems somewhat slower than twm (which I'm
definitely willing to live with since twm sucks rocks).

Maybe for you.  I dunno, I've been doing X programming for a couple
years now and have never found it very difficult (although deciphering
documentation can sometimes be a pain).

Try setting the shadowThickness resource.  Setting it to 1 and setting

Prepend it and have the filter strip it.  (See also the 3B1's "gd" driver.)
That way tar could even be modified to use a (DOCUMENTED!) scheme to detect
the header and run the filter automatically.  ---Or omit the header entirely
and just stream it.  It only causes problems if you pick up in the middle that
way, and tar/cpio/whatever can't handle that anyway.  (Note that, unless the
support is *truly* integral to tar or cpio, you can't handle this case:  the
first block of a non-initial volume is liable to be part of a file, not a tar
or cpio header.)

Maybe some do; in that case it could just as easily be via a separate monitor

This is for non-real-time systems.  Real-time implies reading it as it comes
in and possibly processing it.

I can confirm that; my mother bought a PS/1, and I was horrified by the lack
of specifications.  I have no idea whatsoever how to configure her monitor.

Of course, since all she's running is the preinstalled MS-Windows, she doesn't
have to worry about it.  *That* is how the industry manages it...

Reply-To: DUVAL@ELPP1.EPFL.CH


Hello world,
        I got 0.99.14 compiled and saw that the ip.c had ip defragmentation
installed.
        I have sucessfully used a PCNFS client called NFSShare from a mac
to connect to a VAX and SUN etc, and found that the only problem with the
rpc.pcnfsd's that I found for Linux was that the blasted piece of software
for the mac did its best to send the largest packets you have ever seen (8k+)
whenever the file to be transfered was bigger than a single packet. This
packet was send fragmented and up to now, Linux blew.
        Now, things ARE better, but it replies that it "refuses" to allocate
8045bytes "at the moment" and only gives say 4000bytes in the kmalloc call.
        So, again my software doesn't get through Linux.

So my question:
1)      should I get into the kernel routines and allow for more memory to
        be set aside for kmalloc.
2)      should I get into the net software and allow more buffers

        or what ??

If anyone has any bright ideas, please yeild them up. small files transfer ok
and it would be real nice to see the whole thing fly...

This is where the generic modes in README.Config came from (except the
VESA modes, which came from the official VESA documents).  Writing a 
GENERIC mode grabber is a pain in the ass.  Just as for my comments
above, writing a mode grabber for a specific chipset is fairly simple;
writing a generic one is difficult.  It's something somebody should do.
I don't have time.

If it's false to assume that it can be done manually, then it's false

Both.  All of them have lowest-common-denominator modes.  They also
often read jumpers or switches to know how to do higher ones (e.g. the
"Set this switch if your monitor is capable of 48kHz horizontal sync",
as one of my cards says).

You're missing something.  Specifically, README.Config.  This is exactly
what these modes do.  We don't have a script because I ran out of time
to get one written.  So I wrote a document enumerating what my script
would have done if I had the time to do it.

But the other thing you're missing is that this problem is the entire
reason VESA came into existence.  (a) SuperVGA modes and (b) monitor
timings.  All the board vendors had the same problems we have with
odd hardware.  So VESA timing specification were invented.  The timings
in README.Config will work on 100% of modern multi-sync monitors, and
likely on 90%+ of older monitors.

There's also the fact that XFree86 gives you the flexibility to do odd
modes.  When's the last time you saw an SVGA card in DOS or Windows
actually use all of its memory and give you an 1152x900 display?  I've
never seen it.

>-Doug
>

My challenge still stands.  I challenge anyone to show me a modern
monitor (say, made since mid-1991) for which there is no working mode
in README.Config for all of the specifications of the monitor.  I'm
willing to bet that no such monitor exists.

Note that this doesn't necesarily apply to fixed-sync or multi-frequency
monitors (i.e. ones with multiple discrete sync frequencies, rather
than ranges).  I would expect that the vast majority (80-90%) of these
are configurable from the modes in README.Config.

You've also seen the software put up BIG HAIRY NASTY disclaimers about
damaging your monitor.  At least, all the ones I've see do (ATI, #9,
Orchid).

As was pointed out in another message in this thread, people seem to
be far more willing to accept damage from things they've paid for than
from things they got for free.  An interesting observation, anyhow.

                386bsd 0.1 --Public release by William Jolitz who was
                             originally one of the principal architects
                             at BSDI.
                        FreeBSD  -- Public release by the original patchkit
                                    group for 386bsd-0.1
                                    I think that Walnut Creek CDROM team up
                                    with the FreeBSD group to pull together the
                                    CDROM distribution.

                        NetBSD   -- Public release by another group which 
                                    has a slight different goal. For intance,
                                    there is a NetBSD amiga port group. This
                                    group tends to be more technically
                                    aggressive. It too will have a CDROM.
                                    Currently, NetBSD has dynamic shared 
                                    libraries similar to the sun os mechanism.


Both FreeBSD and NetBSD are organized effforts to bring bsd technology to
the masses.
                
        Hope this helps,
        Amancio

But isn't this exactly what a blessed API standard is supposed to
eliminate?!

I wish I knew; the entry for xterm's function keys is a bit screwy as well (or
at least the terminfo one is; hello, Zeyd...).
