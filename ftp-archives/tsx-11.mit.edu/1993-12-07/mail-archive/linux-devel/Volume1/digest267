Subject: Found slow socket bug :)
Date: Sun, 28 Nov 1993 19:49:44 GMT

I've always been wondering why drawing large areas on X windows with
XPutImage was very very slow. I finally found the answer and its a
bit icky:

Every read and write call calls verify_area, which in turn checks
every page in the area by calling do_wp_page. Lets say you want
to write 1M through a pipe, each write will write at most 4K of
your buffer (likewise for read). This results in calling do_wp_page
atleast ((1M/4K)^2)/2=62500, in reality it is probably much higher
since 4K is not generally written at once.

I put in a check which only calls verify area when the object in
question is not a socket, I then fixed some verify areas already
in the socket code to return an error in the event of bad memory.
I got a significant speed up (factor of 2 or 3) of drawing big pixel 
images as a result.

I'm going to send the patchs to Linus but it got me thinking about
verify area. And I have a few questions:

Is verify area used to prevent paging inside of the calls (something
which would fail for very large writes or reads), or only for checking
the area?

If so would it be possible to make a version of memcpy_tofs/memcpy_fromfs
which would set a flag telling the memory managment code to cause it to
return an error code in the event it accesses bad memory? I think this
might have a big effect on the amount of overhead in the kernel.

How do you run the kernel profiler?

It is very disturbing for one major reason: the conditions for Motif
licensing require a lawyer or an expert system to figure. They gist of
them though is that they are designed to make it very hard/impossible to
legitimately distribute sw containing any bit of OSF Motif code without
somebody paying the OSF a runtime library fee.

There are zillions of special cases; I also understand that if one cares
and has money the OSF might sell them a license with ad-hoc
conditions.

All in all, as of Motif 1.2.x, it is a fair statement that the runtime
library attracts a royalty, in most cases, or all cases save for
internal use at an academic institution.

Summing up, life's too short to bother using OSF Motif for free sw.

And if I were a commercial developer I'd be way of doing OSF Motif for
any platform that does not come with a bundled runtime license.

Contributory infringement, perhaps -- but I cannot imagine the OSF being
so dumb as actually going after UIUC for this. Their lawyers probably
should spend their days imagining way to simplify their license instead;
or goin back to the 1.1.x terms (statically linked libraries should
_never_ attract any sort of royalty fees, which is the industry
practice).

I'm not 100% certain, about what is going on, but some facts:

The kernel should avoid to produce page faults while in kernel
mode.  Just think, you were in a routine, all interrupts
disabled, and produce a page fault, so you need to read some
sectors from swap space.  What if the disk uses an interrupt
to signal that the data is there?  It won't get delivered,
because interrupts are still off.

As far, as I know, 386 chips even have problems of reporting
page faults while in kernel mode at all.  They don't regard
the write protect bit, for example.

In other words: don't produce page faults in the kernel.  Therefore,
verify_area() is called, before any user supplied area is accessed
in the kernel.  It swaps in all relevant pages.

However, system calls often can't do all their work in one run.
If they have to wait for something (data from hard disk, or for
a pipe buffer to empty, etc.), the kernel switches to other
processes.  If they request memory, the kernel may have to do
swapping again.  Worst case is, that the area, which we just
confirmed to be present with verify_area() is swapped out.

In other words: repeat verify_area() after any sleep (whether caused
by sleep_on(), get_inode(), etc., etc.)

: Huh?  How can Mosaic's functionality *possibly* depend on pseudo-3D art-deco
: borders around everything?

Lots of Mosaic's `functionality' is heavily based on the HTML widget,
written in Motif, and the gui code, also written in motif.  The
networking code and WWW support is seperate, and pretty much directly
stealable (the www code is most likely taken directly from CERN, with
perhaps some bugfixes here and there).  Looking at the code, it seems
easily modular enough to do a port to another widget set, given that
you're willing to rewrite the widget and gui code.  Good luck; I'd be
glad to see someone do it.

Seriously, though, I think that the choice to use Motif was a
reasonable one, given the conditions.  Remeber that when the choice
was made different licensing restrictions were in place.  As for the
other choices, I don't believe XView is better, based on personal
preference (I strongly dislike many elements of the Open Look
interface) and what I hear from a friend who's trying to get it to
build on some non-sun platforms recently (but I don't find it hard to
imagine similar things about Motif).  The Athena widgets are not and
were never intended to be a `real' widget set - it was created as an
example set, and used for some of the `basic' clients.  It was always
their intent that other `real' widget setws be developed. (at least,
that's what they say about it now. :-) Tk may someday be ready, but
`someday' certainly isn't today - the last release (3.6) came out less
than three weeks after the previous one (3.4 - if there was a 3.5 in
between that I missed that only makes things worse) and is changing
rapidly - for example, 3.4 had a bug that caused it to try to parse
the comments in it's resource files.  :-)

Don't get me wrong - I think tcl and Tk were really neat toys a while
ago and are fast becoming really neat tools (things like the tk
toolkit effort will certainly help this), and I use them myself, but
they aren't yet ready for the kind of things Eric and Marc are doing
with Mosaic (maybe in tk4.0, sez the author of tkWWW).  As for the
Athena widgets, I imagine someone could come up with something that
does most of what Mosaic does, and it would probably be faster, too,
or at least use less memory), but I'm dubious as too how successfull
it would be, given that Mosaic is so much more popular than things
like Midas, Viola, tkWWW, and all the others...

What really *needs* to happen (and will, eventually, sinc eI'll do it
myself if nothing else (and it'll be slow and poor and silly and look
like it was written by someone who doesn't know how to write toolkits,
'cause I don't :-)) is a free Motif clone.  There is a person on one
of the linux lists talking about organizing just such a thing, and he
is reportedly getting a strong response, so there's hope for a better
first cut still. :-) If you're interested in this and you can't find
the address in the linux groups/list (c.o.l.developement, I believe),
then drop me a message and I'll try to find the address and send it
back to you.  In the meantime, I hope people can stop flaming about
what toolkit NCSA choose to use for the work they give out for free
and concentrate either on making better products, either out of Mosaic
or tkWWW or whatever, and if you think that means porting WinMosaic to
SmallTalk and using STDWIN as the GUI, then go for it, and if you
think that means working on a free Motif clone, then definately go for
it. :-)

Intel runs a Plug-n-Play forum on Compu$erve... I'm not sure what they
have out there.  From what I've heard, Intel has done the Plug-n-Play
ISA spec and is supposedly working on the PCI one for Microsoft to
include in their next OS.  For the Chicago betas out now, you have to
use Intel's software to pre-configure it.  The industry papers seem to
indicate that the official released of Chicago will have everything
all builtin.  

So... as long as the windows software is aware that you want to run
your old Procomm version then it would not do anything non-compatible
with the IRQs and addresses.  I have a feeling that they don't have
this big scoreboard and AI to figure out how you would want to
configure your SW, so fully expect to have to manually tell the
configuration software to stick with AT compatibility as much as
possible to be able to use your non-plugplay aware software.  At least
with the newer programs, you should be able to do weird stuff like put
COM ports all over the place and even share IRQs on EISA boards (to
some extent).  I also heard that VESA is coming out with a way for
new monitors to actually talk to the PlugnPlay software so that the
monitor and video board can work out the best setting for you... I can
hear the software now... "Dave, I'm afraid that I can't allow you to do
that.  You would prefer the 1024x768 resolution with 68Hz refresh. It

Subject: Re: PCI support
Date: Mon, 29 Nov 1993 03:35:13 GMT

Here is the semi-standard response I give to people who ask me about
the PCI machine I am typing this on.

The motherboard is a noname Taiwanese brand.  It has the Intel Saturn
82420 PCI chip set.  The onboard SCSI controller is the NCR 53C810
PCI-SCSI I/O processor.

The BIOS is by Phoenix.  It had some problems with CMOS updating, and
sometimes confuses drives A and B.  The new version of the BIOS seems
to fix this.

Linux does not recognise the SCSI chip so I put in a Future Domain
TMC-1680SVP ISA SCSI-2 controller.

I have 16Meg RAM.  The processor is a 486DX2-66.

The VGA card is a noname Taiwanese board.  It is a 2Meg S3 86c805
32bit PCI card.  It supports 1280x1024x256.  I have a NEC 5FG monitor,
but still run in 1024x768 because I can not get a mode that looks good
at 1280x1024.  XF86_S3 supports the card well (I used to run
XS3-0.4.4), and seems to recognise the 2Meg of RAM.

Sometime soon someone who hacks SCSI drivers will get one of these
SCSI chips and the onboard one will work.

As far as performance goes - the machine goes like sh*t off a shovel.

- Dave

PS. The best way to get a good machine without going bankrupt in
Australia is to go for a Taiwanese clone.  This machine cost ~ $8,500
here (including 500Meg 9.5m/s SCSI-2 drive, NEC 5FG monitor).

Guess what?  It's a HARD problem.  If there were a simple answer, don't
you think we would have released it a year and a half ago when we
started this?

IF we picked a specific set of supported boards and supported monitors,
then we could do things trivially by table look up.  But you folks
want us to support everything known to mankind.  The generic problem
is hard, perhaps impossible, to solve.

Don't ever think there is any correlation between a BIOS or a Windows
driver and what we have to do for XFree86.  The folks who write the
BIOS or write the Window driver:

        a) Only have to worry about one board.
        b) Know EVERYTHING there is to know about that one board.

Because it can damage or destroy your hardware.  Since you don't know
this stuff, accept the answer from those who have been immersed in it
for almost two years now.  It is relatively rare.  But it DOES happen.

You're trying to equate a receiver with a generator.  Or are you referring

Jeez, DO IT BY HAND!

Hsync == Dot-clock/Horizontal-Total
Vrefresh == Hsync/Vertical-Total

Yeah, I guess we could make the server print that out.  Probably should.
But this is 3rd grade math here.

We've experimented with this idea.  The problem is that users won't put in
the right information, and then they'll think they're fine, but things
will die.  For example, this TAMU Xconfig.1M.  It has clocks of

        1 2 3 4 5 6 7...

How on earth can the server verify based of something like that?  This,
specifically, is why I think Xconfig.1M is garbage and hand calculation
isn't, given that both can lead to damage.

Right.  So blame your hardware vendors.  Don't blame us when we do everything
in our power (which isn't much) to prevent this happening.

Well, the monitors are evolving.  Most, if not all, current monitors
simply shut down the display if it gets too far out of spec.  So it's
being dealt with.  THe problem is the bazillions of older technology
monitors out there.

Gee, I've NEVER seen software that does something like that... :->

Thank you.

No, it's not.  It is not at all intelligent.  It is horrifically stupid
to, knowing that it is possible to overdrive the monitor, to allow the
user to send RANDOM timing values to their monitors.

However, in a court of law, the XFree86 way is far more likely to survive
a lawsuit than the TAMU way.  Science is ALWAYS better than randomness
when physical damage is possible.
