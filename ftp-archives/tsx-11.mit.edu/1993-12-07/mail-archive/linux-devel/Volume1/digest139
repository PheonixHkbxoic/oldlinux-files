In many ways I may be the most inappropriate person to respond to this and in
many ways I may be the most appropriate to respond.  You see, I've not yet
installed Linux but a friend is collecting the diskettes for me to do so.  My
lack of patience may get me to fork over a CD instead though.  Especially since
I think what he's gotten is Slackware pl12 and pl13 is now available :-)

That is neither here nor there though.  Linux has enormous appeal.  It is 32
bit, apparently gives good performance without rediculous equipment costs, has
lots of support, is FREE, etc.  I myself look forward to it eagerly.  I also
do not believe that it is dying or perhaps even slowing down.  My friend has
been pestering me to try it for quite a while and I'm just now giving in.
PC Week recently gave it a good review in the Lab Notes section.  Adds for CD
Roms with Linux seem to be appearing left and right (although an important 
issue will be whether users will rally around one major free Unix or spread 
their support amongst several (Linux, BSD386, Minix, Xinu, etc.).

Even though the original posting has so far elicited few responses and nicely
restrained ones, I'll will myself risk stirring up a little controversy.

I don't think it really matters.  Linux is not significantly different from
any other Unix I've seen so far (with the possible exception of NeXTStep).  It
is nowhere near anything that an end user would ever consider installing.  Let
me describe a system that would "play in Peoria" to you.

        It:
        1) Boots from a floppy and presents a character mode interface (in
        color if available) for the beginning of the installation process.
        2) X is provided as a normal part of the installation process.
        3) A graphical file management/browsing utility is provided that is on
        par with that in Windows, the Mac, or NeXTStep.
        4) An installation of Unix, X, and a basic set of tools is on the order
        of 60MB or less, not the 90 that is apparently the current norm for
        Linux + X.  This may be due to software development tools being
        installed as a matter of course, which "of course" doesn't make sense
        in an end user OS.  They would be in a separate package.
        5) Some basic utilities are provided (again X based) to do: a personal
        schedule, rolodex, simple WYSIWYG word processing (on the level of the
        original MacWrite or Windows Write), painting and/or drawing, a
        calculator, clock, etc.  All should look like they belong together on
        the same screen.  The effect should not be an attempt to see how many
        completely different widget sets we can use.  The whole collection
        should also be passably attractive with a 3D look or other adornment.
        6) There should not be 17 different installations from as many
        different vendors.  The user doesn't want to have to conduct a poll to
        find out which Linux to get.
        7) Reasonable attempts to set things up in such a way that the user
        does not have to be a Unix expert or even be really familiar with it
        at all in order to run his/her own machine in a single user type
        environment.
        8) Etc.  Obviously, all of these things imply that someone is going to
        magically unfragment all of the different releases, make choices of 
        apps that already exist or have to be written without pissing off more
        than 50% of the target audience...

Anyone reading the above may well say, "Geez, that's not Unix.  If you don't
like the way Linux is today then go run Windows 3.1 or wait for Windows 4.0
if you have to have multitasking and 32 in a reasonable memory area."

"Unix is about choice and if you want a choice of 13 different window managers
for your GUI then you aren't going to get that from "any color so long as it's
black" Windows.  If you want to be totally restricted in the way that
everything works, looks, etc. go pick a commercial operating system."

I think that would miss the point terribly.  Unix is powerful and neat.
Unfortunately very few will ever get to use this neat FREE system outside of
the few who are up to setting up and administrating a current Unix system.  A
number that pales when compared to the 25 million Windows licenses that will
soon be out there.

Lucid, GNU, and Epoch have all been both innovating and adopting the others'
innovations --- in fact, Epoch is being folded into Lucid now.  Lucid and GNU
will stay separate, because they have different intents (Lucid added features
specifically for use with their C++ code browser product).  I don't see this
as a problem:  it's "competition" of another sort (different "markets", if you
will) but doesn't prevent either innovation or adoption of good features from
the other versions.

The same can be said for the Linux distributions.  I'm not familiar with the
Yggdrasil distribution, but MCC and SLS/Slackware are for different audiences.
SLS and Slackware are in "competition" of a sort:  Slackware started out as
SLS with bugfixes and has since evolved into what is intended to be a "better
SLS" (now we're waiting for SLS to follow suit...).  I can't speak to NCSA
Telnet because I haven't used it.

(Hey, let's start a *real* flame war in tcp-group, Russell:  ask the same
question there about all the different NOS versions!  :-)

Well, this has nothing to do with linux, but... :-)

I was chatting with a company about getting one of those
Maxspeed smart serial boards for my BSDI/386 box.  They
told me that 4 ports running with 16550's at 115k used
approximately 96% of the cpu.  The same load test with
the Maxspeed used less than 1% of the cpu on the same box.

In theory you proceed as follows:

        Find a place for the additional code
        call ld -A mainprogram -T address -o tmpfile extrafiles.o
        read tmpfile
        call the entry-point (which you can get by adding -e to ld)

There are some more details to know.  My advice: pick SWI-Prolog from
swi.psy.uva.nl and study pl-load.c.  It is not bug-free: due to some
problem in ld (I think) you cannot link an executable that uses
library functions that are not already part of the mainprogram.

Subject: NFS experience and minor bugs
Date: Sat, 2 Oct 1993 13:48:12 GMT


Hi,

I'm trying to set up a number of linux machines for students.  These
systems should share user-files and some applications using NFS.

NFS seems to be stable. I've compiled some big packages over NFS and
ran (large) applications with the binary loaded over NFS.  No
crashes while trying to get the system down on heavy load for
over a day!

Versions: SLS 1.03, 99pl13 kernel with net-2d(ebugged) and new
rlogin.   Hardware: 486/33, 8MB, NE2000 clone ethernet.  Server:
SPARC/SunOs 4.1.3.  Heavy loaded network.

Sofar great!  Now the minor bugs:

        * Calling fsync() on a filedescriptor pointing to
        an NFS mounted filesystem fails.  I discovered this
        bug while running CVS on an nfs mounted filesystem.
        I unserstand why (NFS needs no fsync), but the system
        call should return success.

        * Doing a chmod on the (SunOs) server is not seen on the 
        Linux client.  Only after umount and mount the change
        became visible.

        * There might be a group access bug: in our system, the
        root directory under which the staff's home directories
        reside are accesible only by root (owner) and group
        (protected) to which all staff members are registered as
        a secondary group.  Despite copying the group and passwd
        files from the SUN to the Linux box, I could not access
        these directories.  Only after granting permission to
        `other' I could get access.

        Thanks --- Jan

Archive-name: linux/announce/intro
Last-modified: 8 August 93


                 Welcome to the comp.os.linux.* hierarchy!

Background
=========================================================================
        This posting is an introduction to the comp.os.linux.* hierarchy 
        of USENET newsgroups. 

        Linux is a free implementation of UNIX for 80386/80486 machines 
        covered by the GNU GPL. Most of the development of the Linux 
        kernel has been done by Linus Torvalds, an internationally 
        reknowned UNIX wizard from Helsinki, Finland.

        For the past two years or so, the newsgroup comp.os.linux has 
        grown be one of the most popular groups on USENET. Late in 1992, 
        a CFV for splitting comp.os.linux was posted; the only group which 
        passed was comp.os.linux.announce, a moderated newsgroup for Linux 
        announcements and patches.

        Six months later, during the summer of 1993, another CFV for 
        splitting comp.os.linux was posted. The voting period for the 
        comp.os.linux reorganization results ended at 23:59:59 UTC on 
        4 August 1993 (4:59PM US Pacific Time, 7:59PM US Eastern Time.) 
        The results are as follows:

        comp.os.linux reorganization results - 1842 votes

         Yes   No  : 2/3? >100? : Pass? : Group
         ---- ---- : ---- ----- : ----- : -------------------------------
         1692  135 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.admin
         1741   90 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.development
         1647  177 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.help
         1660  155 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.misc


        Because of this split, the newsgroup comp.os.linux will be 
        deleted on 11 November 1993. The new newsgroups will be created 
        on 11 August 1993. This posting describes these newsgroups, 
        including comp.os.linux.announce, which will remain entact.


General Policy
=========================================================================
        The general policy for the Linux newsgroups is simple. Who sets
        the policy? We all do. All of us on USENET are interested in
        communicating openly about a number of topics. That's why we
        have USENET. If you want the Linux newsgroups to work for you,
        a few suggestions:

        * Read the Linux FAQ and follow the newsgroups for some time 
          before posting questions. This is very important. comp.os.linux 
          suffered from HUGE amounts of noise and traffic because much 
          of the growing readership never bothered to READ the newsgroup;
          they only posted questions.
          
          The same thing will happen with the new newsgroups unless you 
          read the FAQ (found on sunsite.unc.edu in the file 
          pub/Linux/docs/FAQ) and read the newsgroup for some time before 
          posting questions. Chances are, your question has already been
          recently answered, and a simple browsing of the newsgroup
          will answer it. We suggest using a threaded newsreader such as
          "trn" which will allow you to browse and mark articles by 
          subject, so you don't have to read each and every article in
          each newsgroup.

        * Crossposting between the Linux newsgroups is STRONGLY 
          discouraged. If you do crosspost questions between Linux 
          newsgroups, expect to be flamed to oblivion. The reason we
          have a newsgroup split is to categorize discussions into 
          separate newsgroups. Crossposting negates this effect. 
          If your posting cannot fit into ONE of the newsgroups
          c.o.l.admin, c.o.l.help, or c.o.l.development, then you 
          should post it to c.o.l.misc. 

          The one exception is for announcements. Occasionally, an
          important announcement (such as this one) will be crossposted
          between c.o.l.announce and one or more of the other c.o.l.*
          groups. These announcements must be approved by the .announce
          moderator; see below.

        * Reply to questions via e-mail if at all possible. While 
          discussion in the newsgroups is encouraged, if someone is
          asking a simple question to which the answer is well-known,
          there is no reason to post the reply. Don't assume that 
          the person posting the question actually reads the newsgroup
          or will even note your followup if they do. Reply via e-mail
          unless the reply is of general interest. 

        * Don't flame newbies. Over the course of the past few months,
          the Linux community has developed an oversensitive ego and
          a reputation for being unfriendly towards newcomers, mostly
          because of unwarranted flaming by a handful of righteous 
          individuals. If someone posts, saying, "Hi! I'm new to
          this group! What is Linux?" (which will inevitably happen
          as the new newsgroups are propagated), DO NOT FLAME THEM.
          When someone sees a new newsgroup pop up within "rn", they
          are justifiably curious about the new group and probably
          don't know that well over 80,000 people who know EVERYTHING
          about Linux read the group. Right? 

          Instead of being rude, you can send a polite note to the
          poster, saying, "Hello, Linux is a free implementation of
          UNIX for the 386 and 486. You can get the FAQ from 
          sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/docs. Let me know if I can
          be of help!". That's all. Not difficult, eh? You can even
          save your stock reply in a file and simply send form-letters
          to newbies if you wish. But there is very little point in
          flaming or ever being rude. It goes against everything that
          Linux can and should be. 

          Just remember that nobody knows everything---not even Linus---
          and that you were a newbie once, too. :)


comp.os.linux.announce
=========================================================================
        Comp.os.linux.announce is a moderated newsgroup for Linux 
        announcements and source patches. The purpose of this group was
        to get all of the ``important'' Linux information out of the
        regular newsgroup and into a place where all Linux users could see
        the important announcements without having to wade through a 
        jungle of other postings. So far, this group has been very 
        successful. 

        The moderators for this group are myself (Matt Welsh, 
        mdw@sunsite.unc.edu) and Lars Wirzenius (wirzeniu@cc.helsinki.fi). 
        We will be sharing the moderator duty, and backing each other up 
        to make sure that postings to this group will be approved as soon 
        as possible after they're submitted.

        Submissions to this group should be mailed to the address:
                linux-announce@tc.cornell.edu

        If you have any problems or questions about c.o.l.announce, please 
        send mail to the moderators at
                linux-announce-request@tc.cornell.edu
        Or simply mail us directly. This is not a request address for 
        mailing list subscription; see below.

        A separate posting details the guidelines for submitting to this 
        group.  I plan to approve just about anything that's posted to this 
        group, except for questions or discussions about Linux. So, please, 
        post away.  :)

        There are also archives of comp.os.linux.announce available at a 
        number of Linux FTP sites: check 
                sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/linux-announce.archive

        There is a mailing list mirror of the comp.os.linux.announce 
        newsgroup; to join, send mail to
                linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi
        With the line
                X-Mn-Admin: join ANNOUNCE
        at the top of the body (not in the subject). Approved postings to 
        c.o.l.announce will automatically be mailed to this mailing list 
        channel.


comp.os.linux.admin     
=========================================================================
        This newsgroup was created simply to thwart the unique newsgroup
        acronym "c.o.l.a", previously used by c.o.l.announce. However,
        this newsgroup is also used for discussions and questions about
        running Linux systems, either in a single-user or multi-user
        environment.

        Clearly, there is no large distinction between c.o.l.admin and
        c.o.l.help. However, .admin should be mostly used for discussions
        about RUNNING Linux, not USING or PROGRAMMING it. Unfortunately,
        especially with Linux, the line between system administrator and
        system user is very fuzzy. In short, we anticipate c.o.l.admin
        to be mostly about questions with installing, setting up, and
        configuring Linux systems, as well as other discussions relating
        to system administration. 


comp.os.linux.development
=========================================================================
        c.o.l.development, or "c.o.l.d" for short, is a newsgroup for 
        questions and discussions about Linux kernel and systems-level 
        development. Please note that this is a newsgroup about 
        development OF Linux, not development FOR Linux. In other words, 
        c.o.l.d isn't for questions about programming or porting software 
        to Linux. Instead, this is a newsgroup for discussions about 
        developing the Linux kernel itself, including writing device 
        drivers, adding new features, and so on. In addition, discussions
        about development of shared libraries, and other essential 
        systems-level projects, are welcome here. 

        Hopefully, this newsgroup will embody some of the content and
        scope of the linux-activists mailing list channels such as GCC, 
        KERNEL, SCSI, and NET.


comp.os.linux.help
=========================================================================
        Comp.os.linux.help is perhaps the most general of Linux 
        newsgroups. It is for any general user, programming, or 
        setup questions and discussion about Linux. If your question
        is about Linux development, post to c.o.l.development. If
        it is about system administration, post to c.o.l.admin. 
        However, if your question is of a more general nature, such
        as "How do I set up Linux for use with an NE2000 card?",
        c.o.l.help is your place. 

        Remember that you should not crosspost between .help and
        other Linux newsgroups. This means that if you are asking for
        help in .development, that's fine, but .help is for those
        questions which don't fit into .admin and .development.


comp.os.linux.misc
=========================================================================
        This group is the canonical ``catch-all'' for discussions and 
        questions which don't fit into the other Linux newsgroups.
        While c.o.l.help is generally for questions, c.o.l.misc is for
        discussions of a general nature about Linux, such as setting up
        a file hierarchy standard, questions about Linus' personal life
        and virtual beer, and the inevitable flame war. Again, it should 
        be noted that crossposting between c.o.l.misc and other Linux 
        newsgroups is strongly discouraged. If your posting or question 
        does not fit into ONLY ONE of the other Linux newsgroups, post 
        it to .misc.


Comments
=========================================================================
