   I'm speaking only for myself here, of course,
   but I believe 3Com advises against installing a 3C501 in a new system,
   mostly for the same reasons Donald has discussed.
   You probably won't be happy with the 3C501 in your Linux box.

Yup.  That would be like using a CGA for your video board.

Sure he has, he just didn't remember..  I emailed him about it a long time
ago..  I've got it running between AIX 3.2 on an RS/6000 and Linux 0.99pl9,
and I've been running it for almost a year..  Every facet of it works: shells,
redirection and X- no hitches at all.  The key to compiling is to use 'bsdcc'
if your system has it installed, and add -lbsd to the link command lines in
the Makefile.  Also, instead of running it with the "< /dev/xxx > /dev/xxx"
as suggested, use "-v/dev/xxx" instead.  Personally, I use a modified version
of Michael's 'autoterm' script, and I don't need the -v at all.  If all this
is correct, the last step is to set the escape characters correctly- always
start with 0-31 and 128-159, this will escape all control characters, you can
then start trimming this list down once you get the connection working.

I offered binaries for AIX a while ago, and only one person took me up on
my offer..  If you want binaries or my source distribution, email to:
clau@acs.ucalgary.ca.

As an aside- if you worked for IBM up here in Calgary, I would have said
that your problem was because you worked for IBM- I don't know about where
you are, but up here, because of IBM's emphasis on OS/2 for its PC products,
99% of the IBM support engineers don't know anything about AIX/Unix, except
perhaps that IBM sells it.. ;-)

Yes.  The PAS-16 boards are built arround a second sourced NCR5380 SCSI 
chip, which is supported in my NCR5380 driver - you just have to write 
a few macros which tell the lowlevel driver how to interface with your
board.

Unfortunately, while people have been able to tell me the addresses
used by the PAS16 for the SCSI chip, nobody has been able to tell
me the mapping used - the NCR5380 has eight registers, although there
are only five registers allocated in the PAS-16 port map.  Also, no 
one has any idea how the pseudo-DMA port works, how the watch dog for 
it works, and what happens to NCR5380 interrupts.

What has to be added to Linux in order to support PCI?

Most new PCI motherboards have an on-board very fast SCSI controller using the
chip 53C810PS from NCR, so a new SCSI device driver for the 810 that supports
32-bit DMA (removing the silly ISA 16MB DMA limit) would be fine.

What else?

Subject: Xmosaic utility Collage wants IPPROTO_TCP, struct linger ?
Date: Sun, 26 Sep 1993 19:30:09 GMT

        Having so much fun on Xmosaic, I thought I'd try to compile the 
collage program. It starts by wanting a dtm package compiled. When I try to
compile it, it wants some defines like IPPROTO_TCP, and a struct called 
linger. Since my *nix here is Linux, I am wondering if there is some place 
where these defs, etc would all be laid out for my viewing. Otherwise would
someone know these anyway?

Thanks in advance,
JES

I'm trying to install ftape-0.9.6 into SLS 1.03 and having a lot
of problems.  SLS1.03 has 99pl12 plus a patch (pl12a.cdif), which
I applied.

Compiling a kernel off SLS sources (before doing anything with ftape)
worked O.K.  and produced a bootable kernel.  SLS already seems to 
have applied a modules patch, BUT their source for the modules utilities 
doesn't compile, and I wound up compiling using ftape's makefile for
modules & it's sys.awk,  but SLS's sources (don't ask!).   The modules 
test with sys_hello worked.

Then I applied ftape's patch to mem.c in chrdev by hand (the piece of
code to allocate a buffer), since modules was already patched in and
I didn't want to screw it up.  I also added a few symbols to 'ksyms.lst',
including '_ftape_big_buffer'.  However the kernel I got from this falls over
when booting ("can't handle kernel paging request").  Any ideas?

I'd be interested to know about any difficulties you had when
installing, or if there is any wierdness in SLS that I should know
about.  Is there any point in my getting 99pl12 from some ftp site,
and are there any patches I need to apply to it?  What would I lose/gain
by going to pl9?

Please do.  The more the merrier.  

There are at least 2 BBS packages currently under development for Linux plus
a BBS programming language.  Join the LINUX-BBS channel on the linux
activists mail server.  There isn't much going on, but that would be the
best place for discussions.

Subject: Re: No smart serial boards???
Date: Sun, 26 Sep 1993 19:08:37 GMT

I heard rumor that there is a Linux driver for Digiboard multiline cards.  Is
this true?

As for whether people are willing to spend "real money" on high-density
serial cards for Linux, the answer is YES!!!  A lot of shoe-string
businesses are now made possible by Linux, because in the past you had
to have US$10,000+ worth of hardware and software to run any
meaningful Unix-based dialup service.  Now you can do it with a $1000
486 box.  Adding an $800 multi-port card is not that big of a deal.
Especially now that multi-port cards are coming down in price.

You can run 8 ports on a Linux box using the low-cost STB 4-Com.  The
cost is $110 per four-port card; comes with a quad 16550 chip, full
modem and flow-control signals on all ports.  If you want more than 8
ports, though, either you need more computers or you need a smart card
whose device driver doesn't yet exist.  The prices cited in an earlier
posting on this thread are a bit out of line, by the way; I've found
prices in the range of $25 to $75 per port.

The way to convince hardware vendors to support Linux is to have a lot of
people call them up saying "I run Linux and I would buy your product if you
had a driver for it."
