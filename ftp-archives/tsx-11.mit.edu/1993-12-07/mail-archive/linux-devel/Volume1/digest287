   Can NCSA please put a statement asserting that its distribution of

   those binaries?  The text of Darrell Crow's message would be a nice
   start, but I think more would be desirable.

   Why do I ask this?  Out of caution.  Once before I have been involved
   in a situation where distribution of code resulted in a major legal
   squabble.  I would really rather that this never happened again.
   It can waste many human-years of time that we cannot afford.

   As a system manager at a UC, I might be held personally responsible for
   the existence of any software which should not legally be on our systems.
   This is true even if some random user obtains the code.  For this reason
   I would like to see explicit statments from NCSA regarding the binaries.

Good God, folks, the binaries as we currently distribute them are
legal, and binaries as we may distribute them in the future are legal.
If they weren't legal, we wouldn't be distributing them, so it makes
no sense to have a notice that "hey people, we aren't breaking any
crime" in the distribution directory -- NO sense.

   I think much of the uproar could have been avoided if there was some
   kind of definitive statement and explanation from NCSA.  

In the first place, we would not have been distributing illegal,
unlicensed, or otherwise evil binaries.  That we were distributing
binaries is and has been itself a statement.

In the second place, I did in fact make a clear statement in this
forum some time ago that our university license covers what we do and
what we plan to do in the future.  Possibly my article did not make it
to your site; possibly you have forgotten it; possibly you are
ignoring it.

   For example, about half way through this long discussion Eric Bina
   posted that Mosaic binaries are made with Motif 1.1.4 which has a
   different license than 1.2 and following.  As a binary only user I
   had no (easy) way of knowing what version of Motif was linked with
   my binary.  This was very helpful.  Of course it raises the
   question of whether there is a committment or intent to continue
   supporting binaries using version 1.1.4 indefinitely.

It is irrelevant.  As holders of a university license we can
distribute 1.1.x and 1.2.x binaries equivalently.  This should be
clear now.

   This licenseing issue is a potentially difficult one for many people
   and a definitive statement, perhaps including the licensing terms
   imposed by NCSA for their binaries, would be much appreciated.

The licensing terms for Mosaic, in the broad sense (what you can and
cannot do with the binaries and the source code), are covered by the
copyright statement, which is both online and in the source
distribution.  Information on specific licensing questions should be
sent straight to us and will be dealt with on an individual basis.

I have a number of Linux machines running here, mostly using the 3c509 card. However,
my home machine, which I sometimes bring in to work, is now fitted with a 3c501.
I have found the performance of this card to be adequate, but not on par with the 509.
It is also reasonably reliable. Anyone using this card would be well advised to change
the debug level (search for EL_DEBUG) to 0, and thus avoiding the annoying timeout
messages which appear every so often.

Unfortunately, with this new kernel, syslogd is now reporting all of  its log messages
to the screen. Temp fix is not to run syslogd. Oh well....

 Keep up the good work Donald.

University Ingres for Linux had been out long before the IPCALPHA

Postgres uses normal System V shared memory, which is allocated

To be crass and followup my own article, the difference between
pl11 and pl14 seems to be that ftruncate on pl11 updates atime,
but on pl14 it doesn't. So I guess 11 was wrong and 14's right!

I don't ``spend MONEY on a project that is freely redistributable.''
I create some systems for my own use. For this, I use software that
is available here anyhow, this includes freeware _and_ commercial
software like Motif. Some of my systems may be of interest for
others, so I distribute them. But I didn't do them for distributing,
I did them for _me_ or for our working group.

If the others don't have the software I used (which are prerequisites)
-- bad luck. It's simple, isn't it?

   We're trying to set up a cluster of PC running Linux here at the
   University. We started out with SLS 1.03, and have upgraded the kernel
   to 0.99.13s, libc to 4.4.4, and installed the binaries from the
   yp-linux package (the lib-source in yp-linux seems to have been folded
   into libc by now). gcc is 2.4.5.

Whoever handles YP for Linux should get in touch with me: there's some
bug fixes and a serious change that you *really really really* want!

First of all, there are a couple of bug fixes. You should get the new
code and merge the changes (which, last I saw, is not going to be
easy: whoever made the code in Linux saw fit to change the formatting
of most of the files.) There are some important fixes.

The change causes the /var/yp/bindings files to be the same as with
Sun NIS.  This is a good idea for future binary compatibility: if SVR4
binary emulation is added to NetBSD or Linux, we would like those
binaries to talk to YP correctly. (Heh. Or SunOS -- that is actually
my main concern at the moment -- since NetBSD/amiga can run SunOS sun3
binaries today.)

(The Linux and NetBSD YP code should also be compatible, so that if
NetBSD ever gets a Linux binary emulation mode that YP still
functions..)

   I've looked at NYS, but it isn't near a finished state. Peter Erikson
   suggested I replaced yp-linux code (partially) with NYS, but this
   isn't trivial, so that would be my absolutely last option.

I have no idea what NYS is. What is it?

Oh and please, a request: The code that I wrote is simply called `YP'. It is
not called `NIS' -- as far as I know `NIS' is a copyright/trademark/whatever
of Sun. `Yellow Pages' is a trademark of British Telecom, but `YP' is NOT
a trademark held by anyone. So call it what I call it -- just plain simple
`YP' (YP is not an acronym for anything, except perhaps "Yucky Poo!" )

Licensing restrictions are important.  They make people nervous.  If
NCSA's pronouncements on licensing are limited to "this forum," i.e.
Usenet, then we are probably doomed to repeat this thread every six to
nine months.  That, at least, has been my experience on Usenet groups.

Important issues, especially complicated ones, where confusion and
misinformation are possible, keep coming up.  A clear definitive
statement from NCSA, quoting relevant OSF licensing policies, would be
of great value for all the reasons listed by other posters.

An individual developer's opinion posted to a Usenet group is much 
less valuable, and is probably of no use at all six months after it is
posted.
