This mail message is to announce the start of the development of the

        NOTIF : No Tisnt osF

This is going to be a Motif clone hopefully eventually conforming to
Motif 1.2 PD specification.

There is a hell of a lot of work to do on this and initially I am going to start
hacking up some of the more trivial bits of Motif and eventually start work
on the more complicated infrastructure.

I make absolutely no guarantee that any of this is going to be useful or
workable, but hopefully different people can take over the project
in whole or in part as time goes by.

I have been watch comp.windows.x.motif and comp.os.linux.development and
seen so many of you rant and rave about OSF, and you may have seen
my previous post.

This project will be totally free and may or may not be included in
commercial projects without fee, except for possible thank you
notices.

I know that an existing free-motif mailing list has been started and
maybe the author of that can contact me (at the address below) when
he is ready, and maybe the internet side of things can be offloaded
to someone else.

AIM:
The aim of this project is to produce a plug-compatable Motif 1.2
library with no deviations. No attempt at a superset of functionality
will be attempted until possibly late in the game when the system
is beginning to stabilise. (One notable exception is the FileSelection
widget which may take on a MS-Windows common dialog box foramt, becuase
the Motif/OSF FileSelection dialog box is such a load of garbage).

Anyway, anyone wishing to contribute source code or ideas can email
me at:

        fox@crisp.demon.co.uk

Anyone wanting to voice opinions (pro or con) can either email me
or post to the appropriate newsgroups. If enough interest is
generated then maybe we can create a comp.windows.x.notif newsgroup.

My initial aim is to start collecting an infrastructre for this project.
By this I mean: consider <Xm.h>. This is a huge include file and
needs to be replicated; simply typing it in from scratch with
all the function prototypes is a huge undertaking without even
writing any code! Therefore, I will attempt to start putting together
a <Xm.h> and some of the smaller functions. (The first is the
XmColor functions).

Since this is PD and since I am undoubtedly not going to be paid for
this, the timescales are going to be long! I may not even bother to do
much for long periods of time.

My interests in this project are these:

1. The Unix world needs a cheap good looking functional GUI. Something
   which exactly answers the clammerings of the Linux hackers and is free.
   This helps to put MS into the ground. (Although given that the
   OSF Motif implementation is pretty huge, 10MB+ of code?) then 
   Notif is probably eventually going to be as big or bigger.

   (Notif will be commented well hopefully).
2. I want to learn more about widget programming. (I have a fair amount
   of experience in X, and consider myself to be pretty good, but am
   not at all happy with implementing geometry managers; so this is
   my chance to fulfil that ambition).

3. Fame! Well why not. I want to be known as more than the CRISP 
   author (who most of you havent heard of!)

I have a heavy workload without doing Notif, so only directly email me
if you think you can contribute code or point me in the direction
of bits of source which you think would be to my advantage.

All other posts should be to the newsgroup which I can then read in my
leisure and not bother about having to respond to.

There was a silly bug in the __asm__ stuff I wrote for 13s that made gcc
optimize away an important part of the paging-init tests: this is fixed
in the final pl14 which I uploaded to nic a couple of hours ago.  The
announcement hasn't shown up here yet, but I assume somebody will get to
it sooner or later: in the meantime I'm including the announcement here. 

                Linus

===== pl14=announce =====

Linux 0.99 patchlevel 14 is available on nic.funet.fi in the usual place
(pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus).  There are no diffs relative to pl13, as
too much has changed (the directory structure changed and the sound
driver was added).  Diffs relative to the last ALPHA version (13t) are
in the "pl13-ALPHA's" subdirectory along with the actual ALPHA versions. 

The changes to pl13t are rather minor: most of them are just more printf
format fixes to make gcc-2.5.x happy (Chip Salzenberg).  Only one very
minor bugfix which made pl13t not notice the WP bit on a 486. 

It would seem to be a good idea to use gcc-2.5.x to compile the kernel,
as that seems to fix at least one known bug in earlier gcc versions.  I
hope that pl14 will be even more stable than pl13 has turned out to be,
and especially the networking code seems to have become much more
dependable.  Thanks Alan & co. 

Changes to the last official release (p13) are too numerous to mention
(or even to remember), but they include NTP support, updated SCSI and
networking drivers, >16MB swap area handling, added sound support,
read-only HPFS filesystem, memory management cleanups (especially
cleaned up mmap() some more).  Also, pl14 contains updated ext2fs code,
along with minor fixes (especially concerning the time values) in other
filesystems, and fixed unnamed/named pipe select() semantics. 

The reorganizations include moving all device drivers to a subdirectory
of their own (linux/drivers), centralizing the major number handling
(<linux/major.h> etc...  Possibly cleaner and/or easier to keep track of
different drivers.  Finally, the first 4kB of physical memory is no
longer cleared on bootup: tytso reports that this feature now enables
some portables to use the power-saving features under linux.  This could
also be useful for the DOS emulator to check where the interrupt
pointers pointed at startup.

        Gosh, you'd have to actually have read a FAQ to find out that
SLS stands for Softlanding Linux System.  No one explains it because
everyone expects anyone could find out with little effort.  Its in a

Change 'distribute' to 'run' and you've got it.  As I undersatnd it
the prohibition is on unlicensed use ( from the point of installation) 
rather than distribution and making the 'user' aware of the
requirements as negotiated when you made the choice of what form of
license to buy.

This seems *fair* to everyone ( OSF and users and developers ).
If you dislike it yio can always not distribute any licensable
OSF code with your app.

Unless you pay for a license to someone who has the requisite distribution

but by no means impossible to get cheaply.

I would write a new diff program from scratch, which had a single
output format which was easy for humans to understand and for software
to auto-process.  I'd write a matching patch.  I'd bundle them
together and call them "GNU delta".

Options I'd consider keeping from diff would be -b (all whitespace compares
the same) and -i (case insensitive compare).

Options in diff which are a complete waste of time are:
 -t (expand tabs on output)
 -e (produce an ed script)
 -f (produce an ed script, only backwards, so you can't actually feed it
     into ed and have it work)
 -n (another variant of -e)
 -h (do it badly)
 -l, -r, -s, -S (hacks to save you from using a shell script and/or the
                 find command)

The -w (ignore all spaces) option is also completely stupid, unless you
happen to be using a language where spaces aren't syntactically
significant, like... umm...  er...

Oh, and anyone who uses diff -D ought to be taken out and shot as a
warning to others.

That's just for SunOS diff.  God knows what awful features GNU diff
has in it.

As to what a better output format would look like, here's one
possibility: it's output from PVCS's VDIFF program:

   complex.cxx (07 Sep 1990 15:35:16)
           complex2.cxx (29 Nov 1993 15:14:42)

I'm not saying this is wonderful, but it's clearer to me than a

Precisely. So if you want a non Motif client use one of the 5 X11 clients that
do not require Motif. There is an existing Tcl browser - TKWWW. Why don't

Tough. Ain't life a bitch?


I think that people should recognise that a lot of the work the NCSA people do
go in answering the rather less than reasonable requests. Like the people who 
fail to get Mosaic to work because they don't have TCP/IP running, the people
who have a broken C compiler, the ones who want it all rewritten in BASIC for
the acorn atom, the ones who didn't realise that the tar file had to be
transported in BINARY mode etc... 

Releasing PD software has a hell of a lot more to it than simply writing it.
I think that the least users could do is to try to make their comments 
constructive rather than destructive. Like suggesting the priority they would
put on extensions, suggestions about how to implement extensions which
simlify matters etc.


Perhaps Marc and co could save themselves some time with a "common problems"
page on the web... Then anyone who had problems building Xmosaic could simply
zap the page off to find out where they are going wrong :-)

Fortran? You try not putting spaces in the first eight (or whatever, it's been
a long time since I used anything as archaic as Fortran) columns of a fortran
statement. I'd say that was pretty damn syntactically significant, wouldn't you?
I mean, the entire language is so utterly brain-dead that one misplaced or
forgotten space brings your entire bloody program crashing down around your ears.
You try putting in a space as a line continuation symbol, and see what kind of
nervous breakdown that gives your compiler
What about common blocks or no global variables, or implicit typing, or
logical gotos or ....

No, I'll restrain myself, otherwise I could go on all day.
