Subject: Q: crond
Date: Sun, 7 Nov 1993 08:51:10 GMT

Hi,

I have a little problem with the crond. 

I use the SLS103 distribution of the Trans-Ameritech CD, but tried the
Yggdrasil demon that comes with their old CD, the SLackware one and
the vixie-cron sources.


I use the batching and compress to email (smail3.1.28). This involves
making changes to smails configuration to put the mails in a spool
directory and run a job once in a while to pipe all the files trhough
compress into uux. 

I noticed at some stage that some messages were sent twice or even
three times.

I checked smail's script (/usr/local/lib/smail/util/cbsmtp.sh), but if
I run this manually it works just fine.

I run top in one window and change the times in the crontab and find
that I have two crond running. Hmm, check rc and rc.local, they only
start crond once. I thought may be crond just started another copy
because because the flock system may have worked not too well. Reboot
the system.

Now I run top for even longer and see occasionally something like
this:

  PID USER      PRI NI SIZE  RES SHRD ST %CPU %MEM  TIME COMMAND
   20 root      29   0   72  108  204 S   0.0  1.4  0:16 /etc/crond
 2107 root      29   0   72  108  204 S   0.0  1.4  0:16 /USR/BIN/CROND
                                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note the Upper Case. 

I compiled the vixie-cron sources and get about a thousand :-)-O
zombies while it is running.

Is this known behaviour? Has this been fixed? Where do I get the fixes?


greetings, el


ps: I don't get c.o.l.help due to noise vs signal ratio and my feed is

If this isnt already a FAQ it should be - ter1.0.7 stopped working
recenly due to the exact thing you just described above.

The solution? Grab term 1.0.8 from you favourite linux ftp site
and all problems will be solved..

Hope this helps...

Granted.  Of course, I've seen places where PL/I has replaced COBOL.

When I did COBOL programming (both on MainFrames and even SCO XENIX)
I didn't enjoy it.

For instance, the Automated Bonds System for the New York Bond Market
is written in FORTRAN rather than COBOL;  the FORTRAN compiler for the
UNIVAC 1100 generated better code for the application and was more
easily written to process the (almost) free-form order messages.

I had a lot of fun going through audit tapes using NOSC Pascal for the
1100...

While COBOL is good at what it's good at :-) I don't see a long future.
Unfortunately, COBOL is _really_ designed for mainframe use and BATCH
mentality.  The "terminal" specific stuff has used what, on a mainframe,
is the "operator's console" (i.e. ACCEPT xxx FROM CONSOLE).  This makes
COBOL programs rather environment specific.

Of course, all my mainframe work was batch work (I date back to the days
of card readers) so my attitude shows my age (or is it my age shows my
attitude?).

Don't take me _too_ seriously.  I still think that COBOL's days are over;
new programs should be written in a more useful language (but NOT "C":
C combines the power of assembly language with the ease of use of assembly
language).  Ada, despite DoD backing, almost looks competent, and, at
least, there IS an FSF effort to support Ada (GNAT).

For NEW programs, I'd discourage use of COBOL.  For programs that already
exist that you want to maintain, I'd suggest retention of the existing
platform (like LPI COBOL on SCO UNIX/XENIX).

Are you sure you aren't confusing it with drug use????          :-)
(Sorry but my attitude is _not_ easily adjusted).

COBOL is a GREAT lightning rod to start/sustain a flame war.

I suspect that a LEX/YACC - based compiler would be possible (I don't
know about desirability, though).

Maybe you should consider a DOS COBOL compiler and run the application
through DOSEMU...                                               :-)

Subject: Sudden lockups when overloading a socket?
Date: 7 Nov 93 16:44:13 GMT

Hi,

        My system lockup completely when I am using slip and X11 during 
heavy transfer. I can not always reproduce the crash, but in the linux
pl13 src it say:

REMAINING KNOWN BUGS AND PROBLEMS:
...

+ Sudden lockups when overloading a socket?
  This seems to occur with X11 sessions (as per Linus Torvalds, 05/28/93)
  and has its origin in the new timer.c code...


I wonder anybody else experience the same problem, and is there some 
patches to fix it? 

Thanks

Date: Sun, 7 Nov 1993 18:25:07 GMT


Greetings all,

 I am hoping that someone here can help me with the problems I'm
having with LINUX.  My primary problem is that I cannot rebuild the
kernel.

 I am having other problems, too, but these may clear up if I manage
to rebuild the kernel properly.

 It's difficult for me to check/post-to this news group (plus it
costs $$'s), so I'll try to be really verbose and give all the
information one might ever need to fix the problem.

 Fundamentally, trying to get a kernel that will support the 24F
(and for the 34F, for my roommate's new PC), has proven to be a
chore.  The sources I've obtained won't compile (see below)!

HARDWARE INFO (of note):

      AMI 486DX/33, EISA
      Diamond SpeedStar/1MB (ISA)

      UltraStor 24F (EISA)
      2 HD's (Both are SCSI-2, Addr's 0, 1),
      2 FD's (3.5", 5.25"),
      NEC-84 CD-ROM

BOOT SEQUENCE:

   OS/2 2.1 Boot Manager boots, selects LINUX partition.  LILO boots
   to the /dev/sda3 (180MB ext2).  Applicable contents of the LILO
   config file are shown.  Note that the "/Image" is an SLS 1.01
   version of the kernel that I'm booting, "/zImage" is the SLS 1.03
   version I actually hacked on enough to manage a compile/load (but
   won't boot).

            boot = /dev/sda3
            install = /etc/lilo/boot.b
            delay = 100
            compact

            image = /Image
                root = /dev/sda3
                vga = 3
                label = 1

            image = /zImage
                root = /dev/sda3
                vga = normal
                label = 3


KERNEL SOURCES:

   I had been running SLS release 1.01 for a number of months (it took
   me a while after I first downloaded to get an US-24F boot image so
   I could install).  At this point, I could rebuild the kernel
   without problems, using the 1.7 version of the UltraStor ALPHA
   code.

   Then, in August, I grabbed the SLS 1.03 files from TSX-11. I also
   grabbed the UltraStor sources and I found they would not compile.
   I *think* that the UltraStor sources that I got with 1.03 would
   also not compile.

   In any event, I tried again this weekend -- I grabbed new files off
   of TSX-11 yesterday:

      /pub/linux/sources/system/linux-0.99.13.tar.gz
      /pub/linux/ALPHA/scsi/ultrastor.tar.z
      /pub/linux/ALPHA/scsi/ultrastor-1.11d.tar.gz

   I re-installed them in the above order, and then ran:

      cd /linux
      make dep
      make clean
      make zImage

   The compile failed under the "linux/kernel/blk_drv/scsi" directory,
   with the following errors:

   At this point, I added the following line to "scsi.h":

      #define MAX_SCSI_HOSTS        10

   And the compile completed successfully, but with the warnings shown
   above (implicit declaration & format stuff).

   So, I installed the new kernel "zImage", ran LILO install and tried
   to boot to this kernel. It died with the following errors on the
   screen:

DIRTY DISKS

   Another problem that I see is with the root filesystem "CLEAN" flag.
   I'm using the EXT2 file system on a ~180MB partition for the root
   disk, plus I mount three FAT16 partitions, and use one swap partition.

   The problem is that whenever LINUX boots (*), I see a warning to the
   effect of this:

       warning, mounting dirty filesystem, running e2fsck is recommended

   Even when I've shutdown by running "halt", or even if I've run the
   commands: "cd / ; umount -a ; swapoff -a ; halt".

   The only way I've managed to get around this is to enter run-level 'S'
   first, then MANUALLY do a halt.

   And furthermore, "init s" within a script causes that script to be
   terminated -- so I cannot setup a simple way (for novices) to cleanly
   halt the system!




Any help will be appreciated,
(Response by e-mail is preferred),

IDE drives C and D. D is just a bunch of data so is of no consequence.
Presently I have my C drive (245 MB) partitioned at 60 for OS/2 and the rest

I want to also add the Linux partition on the Boot Manager.  

Could someone please give me some insight ...the FAQs are not very

PL/I replaceing cobol... Ick...
Doing lots of business applecations, I wish i could use cobol as

I think this is the crux of the matter, Cobol has not kept up with the
times like fortran has... if some adaptions could be made to it, it
might find it self being used for more new applecations.
overhauling the compiler to generate better code wouldn't hurt eather
:)

I think this is good counsel....
