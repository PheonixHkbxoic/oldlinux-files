The QIC02 drivers in the kernel do not work very well for the Everex EV831
and EV833 controllers which are QIC36. They sort-of work, but the select
density command certainly fails.

I am waiting for some programming information on the Everex controllers so
that the QIC02 driver can be made to recognise them properly.

Subject: Accessing disk volumes using ROM-BIOS calls
Date: Wed, 20 Oct 1993 12:24:14 GMT

I know this is slightly off topic but my spies tell me this may be the best
place to ask: I need to access a DOS volume using int 13h (I can't use DOS
since it won't be present at the time), but am having some trouble since int
13h ignores logical volumes and partitions and the like.  I've been told that
some Linux software can do all sorts of clever things with access to different
partitions etc, but I don't have Linux and I'm not really keen to FTP
multi-megabytes of code just to find the 100 lines which show me how to do it.
 
What I need to do is, given a logical partition and sector number in that
partition, translate it into an absolute head, track, sector value on a
physical volume which can be used in an int 13h call.  If anyone knows of code
to do this (I presume that, for example, any fdisk-clone would have code to do
this), please let me know.
 
Apologies again for the inappropriate posting - this problem is slowly driving
me nuts, so you can blame it on that :-).

But your Favorite Tools rely on /dev.  Many many applications assume
that the bit bucket can be found at /dev/null, e.g.  Many others
assume /dev/tty exsists.  Uucp type packages assume that the lock info
in /usr/spool/uucp/LCK.... refers to /dev/....  And so on.

If you really wanted to, I suppose we could move everything to proc,
and then symlink /dev stuff to proc stuff, but I can't even imagine
why that would be good.

Also, /dev files must be available on bootup, so you don't want them
on a mounted fs.  My /proc is mounted.

Not _requiring_ a compiler to rebuild the kernel is an advantage.
Because you don't have to have disk space taken up by a compiler, or
spend the time to run the compiler, it means that you can reconfigure
things on a system that has a smaller disk, and quite possibly do the
reconfiguration much quicker.

Not everyone wants, or needs a compiler.  Especially on every machine
they have.  

I am sure that Sun removed the need for the compiler so that they
could unbundle it and make more money selling the compiler separately.
I can't see anyone using this logic for Linux or BSD, but that doesn't
mean the end result is wrong, or undesirable.

Somehow I can't foresee either the Linux camp or the BSD camp taking such a
worry seriously.

Or, for that matter, the Sun camp.  gcc2 binaries for Solaris 2.x are freely
available and work better than any pcc-based compiler anyway.

This presumably means that Linux could be referred to as a real Unix
system, not a Unix clone, if it can be made to pass the tests.  Cool.

(I'd be delighted if this were done, partly to cool the jets of those

That does not mean that we can't claim to meet the spec (if we already
do or will eventually), just that we probably won't be calling it
"Unix".  I don't think it is something that we should worry about too
much, especially if it will impair Linux development (real
development, i.e. the kernel).

Not the fs structure, even DOS machines can have the same filesystem
structure as a Unix machine.  Novell (previous owner of the UNIX
trademark) gave the trademark to the X/Open consortium, who allows its

Yes, I saw that patch. Unfortunately it assumes the extra drives are behind 
IRQ 15, which is not the case here. Yet there's hope, I've had some success 
in debugging the DOS driver.

Apparently the card uses something that's called EATA standard in Ralph Brown's 
interrupt list to access drives 2 and 3. This means it uses commands F2 (read) 
and F3 (write) and F0,F4 for something else when writing port 0x1F7. The drive 
seems to be told in 0x1F1, where standard cards tell the WPCOM. 

Using this information I patched the kernel to accept up to 4 drives with IRQ14,
and upon bootup it did indeed see my 3rd drive and correctly read the partition 
table. It even showed the partition information with fdisk. Unfortunately, the 
HD code got caught in reset-loop shortly afterwards - I don't know how to reset 
the 3'rd drive.

Does anyone here know something specific about this EATA standard?

I've been almostly completely away from the linux crowd for ~6 months:
minor apologies if these things have been addressed before.


Before I get started with the ld issue, here's a patch for compiling
the kernel with gcc, not g++ - some of the .S's in 0.99pl13 use "//"
comments.

Next, I'm encountering an anomaly in compiling the kernel with a
cross-compiler; it seems the kernel sources expect one behavior from
ld, while the GNU ld I'm using (right off prep), its man page, and the
SLS gld man page, all seem to indicate something else is to be
expected.

This is what I'm seeing:

These would appear to be the relevant sections of the "stock" GNU ld
man page:

     -Tbss org

     -Tdata org

     -Ttext org
          Use org as the  starting  address  for-respectively-the
          bss,  data,  or  the  text  segment of the output file.
          textorg must be a hexadecimal integer.

     -T commandfile

     -Tcommandfile
          Equivalent to -c commandfile; supported for compatibil-
          ity with other tools.

     -c commandfile
           Directs ld to read link commands from  the  file  com-
          mandfile.  These commands will completely override ld's
          default link format (rather than adding  to  it);  com-
          mandfile  must specify everything necessary to describe
          the target format.

          You may also include a script of link commands directly
          in  the  command  line by bracketing it between `{' and
          `}' characters.


What exactly is intended with "ld -T 100000" in the kernel sources?
It looks like an offset for text/data/bss or something, but I know not
which.

Nice sentence. :-)

You already have it. All the needed documentation is there - "encrypted"
within the DOS-Driver.
Take a good disassembler and make it readable. :-)

sbpcd.c came that way...

At ftp.gwdg.de:/pub/linux/cdrom lies some general info about the MSCDEX
interface - that will make understanding your disassembly a little bit
easier.

Greetings ... Eberhard
