Woah! :) I didn't think that many people would respond to our previous
post but thinking that we're the only ones with the problem was
probably foolish :)

Here's the deal, we just fired up the system locally on our machine
and will be seeing how it's running, and if all goes well, we'll
release an alpha later on. Currently it's very customized, as in, the
idea of what is 'local' and what is 'overseas' are hardcoded, as well
as the costs.

The inetd stuff are a pain as well, as they are run as root initially
but all other connections are working.

Currently the user pays XX amount of money and they can use the
network 'till it runs out and then all further xmits/receives are
refused (unfortunately even close/ack packets, don't bother flaming me
btw) so we'll have to extend it to have a mode of operations where it
simply accounts for packets.

Hopefully in the near future we can release our code in a working
state :)

Yours,

Kef

Agreed. The use of color or shades of grey in motif is awful. Some weeks
ago I saw Motif for the first time. I was supporting the port of a MS-Windows
application using a portable C++ library to a unix box using motif and the
same library. We used a greyscale X display. And I had problems to see wether
the radio buttons were pressed or not. But fortunatly, when we delivered the
software, the client had an X-sever software for a PC, which was not able to
allocate some colors needed by motif. So motif switched back to B&W and the
radio buttons were fine ??? (and we did not have the problem of explaining
our client that it was his own wish to use motif).

The next thing I noticed was, that all the dialog boxes had to be resized.
This is not the fault of motif, but of the programming style in out application.
But it is an indicator, that the decoration around buttons,... needs a lot of
space on screen. We probably will have workstations with 30" screen soon.. :-)

>What's a "selection tool"?

A lot of application using a GUI are editors. An editor works on objects.
In a drawing application there are e.g. line, arc, text objects (any many more).
The basic concept in almost every editor is selecting the object(s) to edit _first_
using a selection tool, and modify it _afterwards_.
Some applications have a rich set of selection tools. First there is the arrow. This
tool clears the current selection and the object cliced upon is the new selection.
Sometimes this tool is also capable of selecting a range of objects (e.g.inside a
rectangle). There are tools to expand the selection or to deselect some objets
currently selected. And sometimes there is a tool to (de)select only a specific
object contained in a grouped object.

I don't like these thinks in Open Look too. But the regulations in style
guidelines are far more than that.

Have you ever read the Human Interface Guidelines for the Apple Macintosh?
Go to your local bookstore and take a look at them. You will be surprised,
what the application developer can do to make the application "feel" better.
There are regulations about the use of color, what to write on the label of
a button, the order of the buttons in a dialog box, the use of keyboard
shortcuts, ... Some of these regulations are easy to follow, some are not.
And if I, the user, am used to using applications, that follow these regulations,
I am suffering from applications not following these regulations.
MS-Word on the Macintosh is a good example of a program violating the
Human Interface Guidelines. But if you have a Mac, you can fix a lot of
these violations. (But you do not have ...., I know, and this is the reason,
why I use a Sun anyway.)
And allmost all of these regulations are explained. I know it is easier to
follow regulations, when knowing why.

The GUI is implemented by the applications running on a specific OS. But
the applications, that are bundled with this OS, can show a lot of the
GUI, the OS designer had in mind, when construction the OS. And a lots of
the GUI is implemented in the kernel parts and not coded inside the
applications.

There is no need for any button, shade or anything else on output only
applications like a perfmeter or a clock.

You probably can see, that I am critical to all GUI implementations I have
seen. And this is the point. We all know that 3D shades do nothing to make
applications easier to use. But they do nothing to make them worse exept
wasing some CPU power. But wasting CPU power is very popular :-). We should
better discuss the thinks _missing_ in the widget sets and GUI implementations,
because this can trigger someone to implement the things missing.

And there are a lot things missing in almost every GUI I know, especially the
ones we can use on unix boxes.

You apparently haven't thought about it at all.  The reason that
multi-volume support needs to be in tar is so that later volumes can
be complete archives, and (except for the file split between volumes)
can be read without needing context from a previous volume.

If you just take the output of tar and split it into volumes (with,
say, split) then you are more susceptible to failures.  Unless, of
course, you teach split about tar format.  

The same argument goes for cpio.

I don't know of any multi-volume support in dd, nor any reason for it,
nor any plans to add it.

So, who is in charge of correcting the termcap entries for Linux?  It seems
that I now have to hardcode escape sequences into my programs.

Also, is there anyway to get the default color settings?

... and one such comment is: dear free sw developers, please don't use
OSF Motif for any new programs you write:

1) There are complicated licensing issues that can cause problems to you
   or to us, and that reduce the potential for usefulness and widespread
   adoption of any free sw that depends on OSF/Motif.

2) There are free sw alternatives to OSF/Motif; among them Tcl/Tk, the
   favourite, and then Interviews and, even if disliked by many, XView.

It's just not worth the trouble writing free sw that uses OSF/Motif.

That's simple _and_ constructive.

That wouldn't replace GNU diff, since GNU diff must be as

You are of course free to produce an incompatible program,
but my advice is to call it something other than `diff'.

Look in the GNU diff manual, under `Line Group Formats' and `Line Formats';
they should let you tailor your output along the lines you describe.
Obviously, the default diff output format cannot satisfy everybody;
so, for people like you that want some other format,
GNU diff has some ``creeping features''.

What happens if a file is larger than available tape?

MVS supports multivolume physical sequential datasets, i.e.  one dataset
(which normal people call file ;-) can extend over several disks or
tapes.

MVS also supports tape labeling, i.e. you can identify a tape to
the operating system.

Both can be very useful for backup, IMHO.

GNU tar currently doesn't make it easy to restore only a piece of a
file, in this or any other case.  So, you would need all the tapes
with the file on it.  But, if the media doesn't fail, then things work
fine.  This is just a case where GNU tar doesn't increase reliability.

I posit that this is an extremely rare case.

   MVS also supports tape labeling, i.e. you can identify a tape to
   the operating system.

As does GNU tar; see the --label option.
