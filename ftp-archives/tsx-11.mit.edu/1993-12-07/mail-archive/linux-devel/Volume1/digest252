RLIMIT_NOFILE is a parameter in the SunOS include file sys/resource.h
which is currently value 6.  It is used in calling {get/set}rlimit
to get or set the current value for number of open files per process
currently allowed.  

In linux sys/resource.h, it includes linux/resource.h.  In linux/resource.h
there is a parameter RLIMIT_OFILE which has a value of 8.  The function
getrlimit is defined in sys/resource.h.  From the asm source in kernel/sys.c
it looks like this is what I would expect to see.  What you should be able
to do is define RLIMIT_OFILE=RLIMIT_NOFILE.  I don't have the source for
olvwm so I don't know exactly what should be the correct fix for Linux.
However, from what I can tell, this should fix your problem.

If anyone has anything to add, I'll listen.

Can we stop this TCL/TK is better than Motif thread?  I see them as
being orthogonal products.  TCL hasn't the feature set nor the
elegance to be considered "suitable" for large application development
work.  Do people advocating TCL know the benefits of Object-Oriented
Design?  Sorry 'send' just doesn't cut it for me I'm afraid.

I will accept that TK is suitable for whipping up prototype (abeit,
throw away ones but maybe that's actually an advantage. :-))
applications or relatively small applications that require little maintenance. 
A very good one that I use regularly is Tkman by Tom Phelps.

I'd certainly be interested in a discussion of the merits of TCL/TK
mixed with C++ though for application development.

Personally I'd like to see a tklib written in C or C++ rather than
relying on tcl bindings.

The microsoft mouse protocol only supports 2 buttons, it's not a
software problem. I don't know about a special logitech protocol.
I think to use all 3 buttons the mouse has to run in mouse systems mode.

I'm not quite sure what to make of this.  It cuts if for most of the
major software vendors in the world.  The only real difference between
NCSA and Frame or Interleaf or SAS is that NCSA doesn't charge you any
money.

And it seems to cut it for Mosaic in particular.  At least, it seems to
have managed to be quite popular in spite of this limitation.

So they can count on a significant number of their user base being able

Because its ugly and lacks widget features that Mosaic almost certainly

This is just as true for Athena, Tk and /bin/sh for that matter.

I'm not much of a fan of Motif (I prefer the looks of Open Look and the
XView toolkit personally) but Motif is almost certainly the wave of the
future.  As more and more of the commercial workstation vendors (who
make up the lions share of the market despite the popularity of linux)
ship a Motif environment as their default user environment more and
more applications writers (commercial and freeware) will begin using
it.

Efforts would be much better spent getting a motif-clone project going
(GNU leitmotif?) than beating on NCSA for using a popular toolkit that
they like to develop software that they aren't charging you for or even
forcing you to use.

Subject: status report 0.99pl13r and sound driver 2.1
Date: Tue, 23 Nov 1993 01:29:13 GMT

Experience with Xboing 8.1 with linux 0.99 patch 13 and sound driver 1.99.9
was that Xboing lost count of remaining bricks after 5 or 6 screens on the
average.

Recompiling linux 0.99 patch level 13r and naturally sound driver 2.1, since
it is included with patch level 13r, and NOT recompiling anything else,
Xboing now did not lose count of bricks until screen 30 in one case and other
cases I actually lost the game before Xboing lost count of its bricks.

I am sending this to comp.os.linux.development, not comp.os.linux.help as
I do not need help --- just reporting that 0.99pl13r has "fixed" something.

BTW: X11 still crashes with signal 11 about once every two or three hours.
I understand this problem is only with the ET4000 driver.

It would have stood a chance of an initial implementation if I hadn't

   Another use would be encryption.

Yep.  That's the beauty of the scheme.  You can tack in just about
anything you can think of that a driver-driver could do.

   Encrypted swap anyone?

;-)

   While I think this is good for a RW file system, inode and other
   metadata could be stored compressed on a read-only file system.

Is metadata really very compressible?  I suppose that there are a lot
of zeros in inodes, but inodes are relatively small, and would still
be on different blocks, and you might loose as much space overhead to
storing the compressed inodes as you gained from compressing them.  I
can't say without real data, but until someone shows me numbers, I
reserve the right to remain skeptical...

Better yet, lets make sure that Motif will not dominate the GUI. What
customers want is a Motif *look and feel*, they don't care how it is
implemented.

For several commercial projects I used Tcl/Tk instead of Motif. The
customer was happy with it because it looked as it should.

They were surprised when I told them it was made with use of a public
domain GUI package. But more and more also the commercial world
recognizes that there is very valueable and high quality public
domain software, and at least those I worked for were quite
enthousiastic about it because it meant they could run the software I
made not only on workstations that had already Motif installed, but on
any other too.

What does this have to do with anything?  Since when are Marc and his
programming pals oblidged to give us their programs at all?  What if
NCSA just said, "Hey guys, we need us a cool WWW browser, can you guys
just whip one up a second?  This is for internal use only."  Would you

What makes me sad and angry is the way people criticize the excellent
efforts of others, freely given with no request for compensation.  

I can't afford Motif on my linux box at home either, but I'd rather be
able to get everyone I work with fired up about W3 than to just play
with it at home over a 14.4K modem.  Where I work all we have are,
suprise, commercial systems.  The Sun's run X, and the PC's run
Windows.

Actually my first mail message was a half-truth ;-) I've already implemented
sendmsg and recvmsg as library calls on to send and recv. The problem is
finding the standard for the format - it works fine between Linux machines, but
between Linux and, say, SunOS, it falls flat! I'm going to look into this when
I get a chance, I was only really checking to see if someone else had already done
it (saves me time and effort! :-) It also seemed strange for these two primitives not
to be implemented as everything else can be implemented as library calls to these.
Thanks anyway,
Mark.

First of all, people shouldn't lust after "EISA ethernet power", at least
until they start running 100base*.  A bus-master AMD PCnet/ISA LANCE board
should usually outperform a slave EISA ethercard.

Secondly, Linux is already getting "EISA ethernet power".  I've written a
driver and been working with glee@ardnassak.math.clemson.edu to get the Ansel
AC3200 working.  Earlier I worked with Aaron Monfils, aaron@aaron.cps.edu, to
get the EISA version of the 3c509 working.

But you are well on your way: you've already gotten documentation, and that
can sometimes be the hardest part.  If you'll mail the basic information I'll
look over it and give you an estimate on how long it will to write a driver.
I've even been known to stay awake until the driver is written, but I won't
promise service like that.
