The PCI bus seems to be the most promising bus system for Intel PCs.
Now, the first boards, graphic cards and SCSI adapters are on the market.

If you are interested in examining what modifications to Linux are
necessary in order to get full performance on PCI bus boards,
you'll need the specification:

  PCI Local Bus Specification  
  Production Version 
  Revision 2.0 April 30, 1993

It may be obtained from:
 
  PCI Special Interest Group
  M/S FG3-15A
  5200 N.E. Elam Young Parkway
  Hillsboro, Oregon 97124-6497
  (503)696-2000

Order from +1 800 433 5177; manual is $25 + $7 s/h.  VISA/MC.

Has anyone already tried to run the current Linux version on
a PCI board, yet?

           Anyone seen this, or know of a fix? It's a bug somewhere
   (funny how the numeric value of Meta-DEL is 0xff :-) 

The same thing happens with the binary distribution of emacs-19.19
when used in text mode ("emacs -nw").

        This caused me a good hour and a half of head scratching before I
figured out that was what was happening in my code. I had lines like:

#ifdef FOO
#include <xyz.h>
#else
WHOOPS! - I can't compile on this machine because you are missing xyz.h!
#endif

        I always just assumed that it would strip out anything between the
#ifdef'ed code if it was not going to be included, but noooooo they have to
try and parse it anyway. Seems like a Bad Idea (TM) to me...

        You don't need loadable device drivers for this to happen. All you have
to do is ship the *.o files for people to be able to create proprietary
device drivers. This is how it is done under SCO Unix, which does not do
dynamic device loading. This hasn't happened to Linux yet, so I wouldn't worry
about dynamic loading making the situation any worse.

It was mentioned elsewhere in this thread that, yes, OpenWindows and OpenLook

Date: 22 Sep 1993 22:20:48 GMT

Hello Fellow net-users,

I would just like to remark that the net-2 patches found on sunsite under
/pub/Linux/system/Network/net2-debugged-tcp.tar.z really work wonders for
me.  My system (pl 12, 13 alpha, and 13) really wasn't stable at all under
any kind of net load, but the new patches really help my system stay up
under normal usage.  Take a look:

[1] % uptime
  6:14pm  up 17:47,  2 users,  load average: 0.01, 0.06, 0.02

and I've been hitting the net fairly hard trying to crash the machine
(it didn't crash 17:47 ago either, just rebooted after applying patches).
This would have been unthinkable without these patches--a simple repition
of "tcpspray" commands would eventually bring it down (after approx.
100 or so such commands in a row).

Oh, my hardware: 386-40, 20 meg ram (but with kernel 16 meg limit due to
the ethernet card drivers), Boca AT1500 compatible card, nothing else
special.

Thank you, Swansea University, for making my net stable!

By the way, can anybody direct me to the newest telnetd and rlogind?  I
realize that I should get them for pl 13, but I have been unable to find
any kind of new sources for them....

These programs should be using as many "standard" routines as possible, 
such as getpwent(), getpwnam(), and getpwuid().  Granted, I understand 
that POSIX et al doesn't define useful operations on the user database
like setpw*(), but such functionality could easily be defined from following
either the spirit of the existing interface convention(s) and/or something
that borrows from, say, SVID where it is clearly defined.

This has the obvious advantage of allowing subsequent changes to be as
painless as possible by encapsulating all the changes to the interface
library, eg: lib*.a.  Many folks will recall all the "fun" that 
was had when installing the new SysV release that introduced the "shadow
password files" -- lots of code stopped working because it was directly
dependent on the contents of "the second field of the colon-delimited 
file /etc/passwd."  The "x" or "!" or "*" or <whatever> was less than 13
bytes and highly unlikely to match anything you could possibly use as a
password... :-)

Let's adopt one of the famed "dozens of standards" that exist and code 
to it.  That way the addition of ACLs and auditing will go smoothly. :-) :-)

Does anybody have a cross-compiler running under Linux to generate
Motorola 68k code?  I don't quite have the disk space right now for
all the GCC source code and objects.

On a related note, is there such a beast as a software Motorola 68k 
simulator, like Spim for MIPS R2000?  I tried a few different archie
searces without any luck.

   Yup.  That's my assessment as well.

Rather than have you guess, I'll come out and say it: I've
administered Unix machines before, and I *still* have a hard time
with it.  I'll learn how to set up a program, get it going, then have
to start learning all over again when I come back to it a few months
later with a new version.

   If there's any single standard that needs to exist with respect to config
   files, it's the use of a comment character.  Most things can use '#' at
   the beginning of a line to indicate a comment.  I suggest that everything
   be modified to deal with that.

   Then you include sufficient documentation in comments to enable novice
   admins to get a handle on what they're doing when they look at the file.
   This, of course, is for system configuration files that don't have a
   specific application that uses them.

Absolutely!

   People who come from the MS-LOSS world don't seem to realize that the
   reason Unix is more complex to administrate is that Unix is a more
   complex system!  Furthermore, how can you effectively manage a system
   if you don't know how the pieces are supposed to work?  Configuration
   files give you a clue about how things work.  Knowing about them is an
   advantage.

   I do admit that there are some configuration files for which a front-end
   editor would be really useful.  Sendmail.cf comes to mind.  :-)

IDA Sendmail is your friend here.  But it's not *too* friendly if
only because the documentation and the configuration file are split.

The way I look at it is, *don't* create a man page for a
configuration file.  Instead, put the documentation into the comments
in the file.  That way, you've got the documentation right there when
you need it.

 Now, with the new groups created, the traffic in comp.os.linux is

 So, why not keep the old comp.os.linux group around until at least
version 1.0 of the kernel is released, for historical purposes?

gee, I personally don't see it being a problem.  First off, they'd
have to complain.  Second, they'd have to take it up with Michael,
and he's in Australia.  Third, they'ed have to win.

Words that are in the common domain are exempt from this kind of thing.
term is just simply too generic for someone to trademark.  It'd be like
General Motors trademarking "auto" or something....

no way, no how will it stick.
