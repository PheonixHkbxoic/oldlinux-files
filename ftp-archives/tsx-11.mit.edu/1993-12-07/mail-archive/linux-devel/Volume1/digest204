Strange. I have 8MB with 16MB swap and IDE. I compiled the kernel with
X11 running and without it, many times, with and without other
activity (causing paging). I've never had this problem (also never had
sig-11). Now that I hear it happens so frequently with some people I
think it must be a hardware problem.

Sucks for you, maybe.  Also, I've only seen the quoted opinion of *one*
MIT user in this forum.  Are there more who spoke up?  If not, does this
person speak for AFS users at MIT?  Also, what version are you running on?

I have about a dozen or so cron jobs that AFS has never broken for me (in
terms of startup).  Some of them are real network crunchers, which really 
shouldn't matter, of course, but the fact remains that I do this night after 
night after night.  I think your problem lies elsewhere.  Maybe you could 
explain why you think AFS is to blame.  I'd be interested in this, if only 
to be aware of what might happen.

I'm not sure that I've ever tried this...probably haven't.  I think my
mail has always been on a local (disk) spool when I read it.

This could be a purely economic decision.  If Transarc doesn't think that
there's a big enough market to justify r&d costs, (I have no way of knowing 
this, of course), then I can't blame them.  After all, they are a *commercial*
enterprise.  They have no mandate to supply support for what they might
consider a niche market, which massively parallel computers might qualify
as in their view. (versus the distributed computing environments they do try 
to sell to)

>(perhaps you are an exception?) users developing non-system code HATE AFS.

The one real problem I do have *is* with the backups, as the extra load tends
to slow down my nightly jobs quite a bit.  I really have to slam the network 
to get some of them done as it is.

I could probably find you dozens, maybe even hundreds of users who have no
more qualms about using AFS versus NFS where I work.  I can't unequivically
promise this, but I think I could.  (if I felt like taking the time....I
have too much else to do to think about compiling a survey like this)

I think that before I go any further in this thread I have to state that I 
got in this thread to answer some questions and offer a perspective based on
my experience with AFS.  Though it might seem like it to you, I have no
stake in the propagation of AFS.  I'm just a reasonably satisfied user.  I
say 'reasonably' because I've yet to be completely satisfied with *any* 
network, AFS, NFS, DecNet, you name it.

Subject: SIGFPE when running ppmforge -clouds (pbmplus toolkit)
From: morpheus@entropy.linet.org (morpheus)
Date: Mon, 1 Nov 1993 23:37:35 GMT

When attempting to run the ppmforge utility included in the pbmplus
toolkit (10Dec91), it aborts with a Floating exception after the
initialization.  This is happening on a 486/33, 0 cache, 8mb ram, pl12 and
13.  It does NOT happen on a 386sx/33 with 4 meg and no fpu.  Assuming
the problem is not with the setup on the 486, maybe this is a kernel
problem?  If someone else with a 486 (dx) could check if ppmforge works
on their machine it would narrow down the problem, anyway.  It's definatly
possible it's my fault (ie, I misconfigured something).  I'm sorry I
haven't had time to do more research, but this problem has been in the back
of my mind for more than a month and I haven't gotten a chance to do
anything with it, so I figured I'd just post it.

The commands that get the exception are ppmforge and ppmforge -clouds,
ppmforge -night works fine.

If all three commands work on your 486, please just send me mail to that
effect and I'll shut up.

core.tex, core.dat, core.doc, core.texi, core.info, core.texinfo,
core.tar, core.tar.gz, core.wars, core.is.better.than.ram

And so on.  The current rule is simple: don't have a file named
core anywhere (except as the name of a core dump).  Any more
complex rule will get people in trouble at least slightly more
often.

I just compiled the latest (13p) kernel and the problem appears
to have gone away (here's hoping!).
