 Seems to me that currently not that many people know about the LDP.
 The Linux Documentation Project. I had several replies by mail asking
 what it was and where to get it.

 The LDP currently has currently 5 *ALPHA RELEASES* going. 

 - the Linux kernel hackers guide
 - man pages for system calls
 - the installation and getting started manual
 - the network administrators manual
 - the system administrators manual

 For me these have been already a treasure for finding information. Please,
 don't only read them, evaluate them also and let the authors know what you
 like and don't like, i.o.w. help them getting these manuals become better 
 then any *NIX manual I've ever seen. (thanks Lars, Matt, Michael, Olaf and
 the man pages team...)

 The documents can be downloaded from the "normal Linux ftp sites". Look
 in the alpha directory or in the docs directory for another directory
 called LDP. 

 On sunsite.unc.edu you will find them in the directory
 pub/Linux/docs/linux-doc-project together with the 
 manifesto and README.

 To come back to the /proc question. In the Kernel hackers guide there
 is a *fairly* complete /proc section. I think Michael is awaiting input
 from other wizards to complete the section...

 In hope this has helped a bit...

I would hope that industrial-strength backups use write checks and
error-correcting codes, so that you can restore _all_ of it, not _most_.
Do you think the writecheck and ecc filters should be part of tar too?

You are confused. What I suggested was a way in which GNU tar's 
multi-volume support could have been _implemented_. How could it be 
any more annoying or inefficient than the existing code? It'd work the
same from the user's point of view---same option, same speed.

The differences are (1) it would require at most twenty lines of code
and (2) it would produce tar files which could be extracted with non-GNU
versions of tar.

(This is of course only a side issue. I was reacting to Mike's comment
about the complexity of GNU tar's multi-volume support. Such complexity
is entirely unnecessary.)

I agree. Certainly, if you want this feature, then you want a program
to do the work for you.

But should it be the tar program? No.

It makes no sense to load down tar and cpio and pax and zip and zoo and
so on with code which you could write _once_ and put into _one_ tool.

Yeah, brilliant. What happens when thirty different programs like this
are running on the system? Boom, three megabytes gone---provided you
can fit each of your monster applications into a mere 100K.

I prefer to see each utility written in terms of a few small tools. The
thirty programs might become thirty small wrappers around twenty common
tools. Even if all these wrappers and tools take 25K each, the total is
only a megabyte.

Two megabytes of RAM saved. Call it $100 per machine.

The memory waste also translates into sluggishness: you have to wait
longer when you first start up a 100K application than when you first
start up a 25K wrapper around common tools which are already in memory.

Code duplication is _not_ the intelligent thing to do.

The reason that multi-volume support may need to be in tar is so that
a file can be bigger than a volume.  If each file are smaller than a volume,
then you can make each volume a complete archive by simply using tar
multiple times.  A script/program could partition the files that are
to be archived into sets that would fit on single volumes, and then
invoke tar for each set.

Never heard of links??? You just link the 30 proggies together and all you is
30 directory entries and 1 copy of the program. And when you run it the 100k is
loaded up and the text shared between al the people running it..

Hoiw about you just have 100k of text, and (say) 5k of data per instance of
your 'huge' 100k program so a total of 250k, even smaller still.

But if the 100k thing has already been loaded by the other 29 users, then it
won't take any time at all to get it into memory.

True, either use a shared library, or binble the prorams together.

Incorrect.  Such files are probably very large, which means that the
filesystems they are on cannot be assumed to hold both them and the
split versions.  As a result, you cannot use such a scheme for file
which might be used during the archive; since the crucial use of
multi-volume support is backups, this is a significant lose.

To boot, this would require a great deal extra disk activity; not
necessarily a speedy proposition for such large files.

And, the code to do all this would be considerably larger than the
small amount of code in tar to deal with it.

Subject: HD timeout/reset
Date: 2 Dec 93 04:59:42 GMT

Hello,

 Starting when I upgraded my kernel to 0.99pl12 I began to see these messages:

    HD timeout
    HD-controller reset
and
    Floppy: unexpected interrupt

 The first one happens only during *some* hard drive accesses. I've noticed
that it doesn't seem to matter if it's a read or a write.

 The second one happens at random times. There does not have to be any drive
access (hard or floppy) going on.

 I'm the only one logged into this machine, so it can't be being caused by
another user doing something....

 Let's see, system stats:

   386DX40 Cyrix processor
   8 megs of RAM
   Maxtor 7345 IDE hard drive   (345 Megs)
   Generic IDE/Floppy controller
   Currently running .99pl13r  (Slackware 1.1.0 install code)

 Anyone have any ideas what's causing these messages? The one about the floppy
unexpected interrupt isn't that bothersome. But the HD timeout stuff makes me
a little nervous. I'm afraid that it's going to cause me to lose some data at
some point...

     Suggestions anyone?

Now that I take a carefol look, I see that the 'l' to represent 'patch-level'.
I tought it was a '1'.  FYI SLS 1.04 runs a pl13 kernel.

A couple of other questions.  How do I get tin to compile.  I tried the
distribution from SLS; it claims that if a 'make minix' it will work.  Not
so.  Is there a better distribution??

On the CDROM front, my drive keeps crapping out.  This is a real pain - is
there an improved driver in pl14??

Is there an easy place to access key and xmod maps for a UK keyboard??

Many Thanks,
Al

Indeed not. But I do not consider hard linked binaries as duplicates. Neither
does the system (in regards of text size that is).

However, having siad that, I do still prefer the original UNIX philosophy of
lots of small tools that can be put together in an enormous variety of
fashions.

If it is that little used, would they notice if you appropriated it?  Or how
long would it take to swap the goodies from it into the case of your
less-powerful machine and put the 386/25SX or whatever in that case? (unless
your Linux machine is at home, which would maybe raise a lot of questions).

        Hi.  I am looking for a couple of things.  First, I need ld.so
version 1.3.  I have the 1.1 which comes with Slackware, but I want it
fo X.  Also, I'm looking for GCC/GXX 2.5.4 or 2.5.5.  The pl14 of the
kernel recommends compiling with it, but I see it on no site.  Oh well.
Ay help will be appreciated.  Thanks,

Ken Geis
