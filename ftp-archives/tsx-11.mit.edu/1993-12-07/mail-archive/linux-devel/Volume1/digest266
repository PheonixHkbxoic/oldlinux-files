This makes me think of a problem I have with synchronous/asynchronous
(although a PC hardware newsgroup might have been more appropriate):
I can enable synchronous negotiation with the 1542C's built in
software. My drive says it supports 10MB/s transfer in synchronous
mode (5 in asynchronous). So I try to set synchronous negotiation and
set the transfer speed at 10MB/s for the 1542C. But when I do this, I
get a memory parity error during booting and the system hangs.

Does anyone know if I should be able to do this?

        Xenix, and can run the "real" one.

        the linux kernel, probably less than 200 lines of code.

I looked at the book, it stated 64 bit memory path, and it required that
I use 2 36bit simms to make a bank, which kind of fits the spec for 64
bit wide.

Hope this clears up the disbelief.

Like, uh, tar-1.11.2??? And again, if you achieve multivolume I/O with
a separate filter, how do you get the other programs to respond
intelligently when the user tries to untar something without the
filter? 

On the other hand, it WOULD be a great idea to have a multi-volume I/O
lib for storage packages, so that it would be consistant.

While I use cat in that manner, I also use it to show small files,
such as a menu, or a help screen... I also use it to look at small
files of indeterminate format, so I don't have to have less clear my
screen, or deal with more.

Speaking of which, does RAID need to be supportted in the drivers, and
if so, is anyone in the GNU, Linux or *BSD world working on it?

I am curious as to how useful a microkernel arch. is to Real-time
applications. I would think that being able to talk very directly to a
A/D converter would be very useful.

I question the need for "big iron" or at least the big iron we have
seen. At the heart of many of those giant boxes has been the
proverbial walnut sized brain. But I do agree that the current crop of
bad euphamisms is cause for laughter. 

I think that the hardware that is about to hit the market will help
the problems quite a bit, but it's going to cause a lot of MIS
managers to start hiding all the computing magazines from their
bosses, to cover up premature decisions. (I feel sorry for those

Just wondering if anyone knows if the RCV Fifo's on the 16550A are
enabled in linux?  

I'm running pl13 and was tracing through the code (no special reason)
and noticed that I don't ever see the rcv buffers of the 16550A enabled.

Is this an oversight and was it intentional?   

By glancing at the code a little it doesn't look like it would
be too hard adding the code to enable the rcv fifo's.

Any thoughts? Anyone.

The 1542C (nee CF) will only transfer 5M/sec across the SCSI bus, 
so you may or may not gain anything depending on how good the 
Adaptec asynchronous implementation is.

>set the transfer speed at 10MB/s for the 1542C. But when I do this, I

As expected.  ISA is virtually allways good to 5M/sec, anything 
above that is pushing it.  Double that and you're out of spec. 

Note that the transfer speed set in the setup program is the 
Adaptec -> host system DMA speed, and is a totally separate 
issue from the Adaptec -> target speed.

I read that PCI performs run-time configuration.  Wouldn't this mean
that things like I/O addresses and interrupts might be different
between restarts, if PCI cards are added or removed?  Wouldn't
this be potential trouble for an OS that was designed for ISA?

Which makes me wonder: is the ISA Plug-n-Play spec publicly available?
How hard would it be to support?  Is PCI automatic config anything
like it?

Subject: /dev/audio in Sound 2.0
Date: 28 Nov 1993 14:19:08 GMT

I've replaced the 1.0 sound driver with Hannu Savolainen's 2.0 driver in
my Slackware 0.99.13 kernel. When cat'ing a long .au file into /dev/audio,
after approximately 1 minute it slowly begins to garble.  By the end it
seems to be playing 1/2 second segments completely out of order, or delayed.
It is noticable at the end where it should end in silence; instead there is
silence followed by a 1/2 second segment from the song that sounds correct.
On the other hand, cat > /dev/audio worked PERFECTLY in 1.0; I never even
noticed the DMA clicks until I got 2.0.

I have a PA *STUDIO* (A superset of the Spectrum, I believe).  I compiled
a partial driver, with SB and PAS support only (Digitized Speech and
FM support, no MIDI, 65536 buffer).  It seems to find the card; it certainly
makes noise.  However, /dev/audio1 and /dev/dsp1 don't seem to work,
so I may have made a mistake or my hardware isn't compatible.

Output of /dev/sndstat:

They are enabled on the 16550A but not the 16550.  Have a look in serial.c

i got the same problem yesterday, while compiling elm pl23. after fidling

Programs like tar might incorporate a mechanism to run the filter themselves
(compare the "z" option to GNU tar for compression).  The difference being
that the filter is still an outside program; you don't need to duplicate the
code for GNU cpio or dd or for some other program, and you can upgrade the
filter without having to upgrade cpio, tar, dd, etc.

Small files, maybe... but in that case I want it uninterpreted anyway.  For
indeterminate format files I *do* use paginators... because random binary
characters can screw up your terminal (or xterm) rather effectively.

Not so far as I know.  The point is to plug in a RAID array in place of an
external disk, and let the array's firmware do the work.

I have my doubts... "real-time" implies that the task talking to e.g. the A/D
converter can do so uninterrupted.  Which means you've shut down every other
task on the system... and a lot more things are tasks in a microkernel than in
a monolithic system.  If what it's trying to do is capture data at high speed
and write it to disk, it's got a major problem if the disk driver and/or
filesystem are separate tasks which are blocked by the higher-priority real-
time task.

I think you missed my point:  it's not CPU power that mainframes provide, when
it comes down to it; it's I/O.  Faster buses will help (including both CPU-
to-controller buses like PCI and controller-to-device buses like Fast&Wide
SCSI-II) but there are also issues like making DMA general enough that any
device can access any section of memory on demand or multi-porting main memory
between the CPU and the devices.
