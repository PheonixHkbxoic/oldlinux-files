Xview was a toolkit designed to aid the transition from Sunview to X.
It's difficult to impossible to port to some systems, so I've heard.
Alan is right when he says Motif==>Xview is the wrong way to go.

Interviews is *not* part of R6. Perhaps you're thinking of Fresco? Fresco
is not Interviews. Fresco is an entirely new implementation.

Well, it's close. Since I'm not in the business of quoting OSF policy I'll
suggest that it's all covered in the Motif source license, which you can 
get from OSF.

The problem is that ncurses is still a moving target. The extensive use

   I have recently learned on these screens that the Motif library
   implementation by OSF is now distributed with a license that requires
   royalty payments for every _binary_ distributed that contains parts of
   the OSF Motif runtime libraries (when the binary is for a machine for

I think this has been that case for quite a long time. I believe
binaries with statically compiled in functions still can be freely
distributed.

Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Perhaps this is a johnny-come-lately sort of posting, on an already well
known point, but the subject matter is important enough that it
deserves repeating, if that's the case.

I have recently learned on these screens that the Motif library
implementation by OSF is now distributed with a license that requires
royalty payments for every _binary_ distributed that contains parts of
the OSF Motif runtime libraries (when the binary is for a machine for
which a Motif license has not already been paid, if I understand it
well).

This effectively means that all those that want their sw to be generally
free should stop using the OSF Motif library, and those that already
have done so should convert their code away from requiring it: there is
no alternative to OSF's Motif implementation for all of the free OSes
that are currently so popular (I don't know of _any_ other commonly
available library with an API ompatible with that of OSF's Motif
implementation).

Note that this new license restriction makes Motif based sw hard to
distribute *only* on freeware operating systems: most commercial OSes
nowadays are sold bundled with a runtime Motif license, so there is no
need to pay OSF a runtime library royalty when distributing a Motif
binary for say an IBM or HP workstation (and soon, thanks to COSE, for
Sun too).

Therefore all authors and prospective authors of free sw should avoid
using Motif:

  their programs will not be distributable in binary form for any free
  OS (BSD, Linux, Mach 3.0, and so on), and using source distributions
  will require the purchase of a rather expensive (when compared to the
  royalty paid by a manufacturer to bundle Motif on all their machines)
  full Motif package, if available.

There are several alternatives to Motif:

  * the XView library, donated by Sun, is rather high quality and easy
    to program into.

  * the Interviews library, for C++ programmers, is also very high
    quality and easy to program for, and rumour is that it will become
    a standard part of X11R6.

  * the venerable Athena widget library is standard with most all X11
    packages, and there are several high quality high level widgets
    available in the Free Widget Foundation collection, which cover
    the functionality of the more sophisticated XView/Motif/Interviews
    widgets.

  * if you really want a Motif Look&Feel, there are libraries that are
    not sold by OSF which have a different API and less restrictions.

  * perhaps you might consider using wxWin, a freeware library
    with an API that is independent of the windowing system used.

Finally a personal note: I think that this decision of the OSF is ill
considered; I am hard pressed to think of *any* supplier of graphical
libraries of any sort that requires the payment of a royalty on every
copy of a program using a runtime library.

Runtime library royalties have not been a common industry practice for
many years now; they were quick to disappear in the early eighties
(largely thanks to Borland).

It is also interesting to note that this significant tightening of the
license terms seems *designed* to hurt *only* the development of free
sw, and of free OSes: the OSF Motif l&f and implementation are an ever
more popular industry standard, and virtually all workstation
manufacturers already supply a (very cheap to them) Motif runtime
license with every copy of their proprietary OSes.

Perhaps the OSF founders feel threatened by Linux, now that the
ATT/USL/SUN axis is vanquished?

One piece of good news is that OSF has made the spec public, meaning
that they've given the green light to anyone who wants to clone it
(no risk of look-and-feel lawsuits).  If it really turns out that the
whole world is going in Motif's direction, perhaps it's time for a
Motif cloning project.

You've omitted one of the best alternatives, Tcl/Tk, which is very close
to the Motif look and feel and far easier to program.  It's also free
software.

>Perhaps the OSF founders feel threatened by Linux, now that the
>ATT/USL/SUN axis is vanquished?

It's possible, since it seems that now that Sun is on board, all
commercial Unixes would have the fee already paid.

One question is whether the new fees are retroactive (can they be?).
Do they apply to those who bought the MetroLink port of Motif to Linux?
If so, then it would appear that the Mosaic binary sitting on the Linux
archive sites is now illegal, as would be any other free binary that
contains Motif for Linux.

There's a mosaic+term binary up at sunsite.unc.edu.  It's Xmosaic 1.2

Ncurses is still a (very) moving target; creating a shared library would
freeze its entry points and data structures while it's still in development
(bad idea).  (I'm still debugging some of the direct terminfo-level code,
since I have programs which use it... so far with very little success.  And
yes, I've been corresponding with Zeyd about it.)

I imagine it is looking at location zero where it finds

You are right, of course. Sorry I was too hasty in posting my comment :(.
What I failed to realise was that XtSetValues passes a well-defined
character string which is converted into the data structure reference by
means of the resource table within the widget.

BTW the reference to 75 pages of documentation for XmList comes from
"Designing X Clients with Xt/Motif", Jerry D Smith, Morgan Kaufmann
