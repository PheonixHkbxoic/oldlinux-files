If Motif is an example of 'commercial quality', I'll take the non-
commercial stuff any day. Motif has lots of bad code and bugs. Since
we have a Motif source license, I have been able to actually check and
see.

"there is a difference between commercial quality software and free stuff" ?

How about:
"there is a difference between free quality software and commercial stuff" ?

That's just as true. 
I prefer:
 - fast response to bug-reports.
 - being able to fix bugs myself if I'm able and need it.
 - getting my bug fixes back into the master version.

The third point is difficult-to-impossible with commercial software.
With free software, it's *always* possible, and most often very easy.

Grrr... I was talking of people at an *academic* site who don't have
to make their money out of software since they are paid anyway...

Grrr again... I *never* said this. I was just criticizing NCSA for
their decision to base Mosaic on Motif although not forced to do so.

Appreciation of free software doesn't exclude the possibility to think
of other solutions (i.e. commercial ones - although I won't buy a
commercial WWW client, or C compiler, or whatever, I can well think of
reasons to do so), but it doesn't exclude the possibility to criticize
either.

Actually twm is just Xlib based. Twm does make use of some functions in 
the Xmu library. Some functions in Xmu in turn have some dependencies on 
Xt, but SunOS style shared libraries can't discriminate at the level of
granularity necessary to avoid pulling in Xt unnecessarily. Observe that
with SVR4 style shared libraries that Xt is not pulled in:

   I read this as "We [academic institution without profit intention
   behind - or correct me if I'm wrong] are mainly interested in
   support for the broadest user base of *commercial* systems."
   Surprise...

Let me spell it out.  We have a certain amount of resources and we
want to provide free software to the largest number of users in the
most stable and reliable way possible.  The logical thing to do, given
those constraints, is to base the software on what the *vast majority*
of users have on the machines sitting on their desks as supplied by
their vendors -- if it's an X-based Unix workstation, that's Motif,
and if it's an Intel 386/486/Pentium, that's Windows.

Please note: I have nothing but respect for people who prefer wholly
free solutions -- GNU, Linux, tk/tcl, etc.  I have nothing but respect
for those products themselves, and I benefit from a number of them
every day (most notably, GNU Emacs and GCC), for which I am grateful.
However, that still doesn't change the reasoning in the previous
paragraph.

   But what really makes the reader sad and angry is the following
   "and those people who don't want to buy Motif are, anyway, better
   off with DOS and Windows."

I never wrote, or said, that.

   NCSA is making excellent products and your [sic], but don't tell me
   that if I'm just a poor student with an old 386 and no extra $$$ to
   spend on software the right thing for me is MSWindoze.

I'm not telling you that.  We can't provide for every conceivable
configuration of system with the resources we have available and still
meet our requirements for broad-based stability and reliability.  We
provide free software as best we can in such a way that a very large
number of installed systems can run it, and we hope it makes some
people happy -- that's all.

My perenial search for people experianced in the area of subnet to
subnet routing for a linux box pl 13, with two NE200 ethercards in it.
System now operates with out self destructing, but does not forward
IPs from one card to another, inspite of a careful routing scheme..

Anyone else using Linux for routing?
please respond to this group or hgja@odin.cc.pdx.edu

I have a Linux pl13 machine that has two ethercards in it. One is connected
to the campus backbone, and the other is connected to my local LAN
(14 MACs, 6 Windows, 2 netprinters).  They are seperate subnets (campus
side is .72.0 and the LAN side is .155.0.  So either side can login to the linux host
but neither side can tunnel through the host to the other side (ip forwarding).

Any suggestions?

Many thanks... in advance.

I do not want to start a "ext2"/"xiafs" fight. I'm just wondering, is
there a specific reason that there is no fsck for xiafs? Or has everyone
just decided that it's unnecessary because of ext2? What about Frank Xia, 
did he plan to do a fsck and then quit? 

I'm not looking for someone to convince me to run ext2 (I *DO* run ext2)


Also, if for some reason I'm extremely misinformed and there is a fsck

I use a 2.0 Gb DEC SCSI-2 harddisk with an Adaptec 1542C on a 486DX33 and I
get only 600-700 kB/sec (using iozone). I don't know whether this is
`normal' and what kind of settings could improve this performance. The
performance as it is now is not faster than my IDE disks.

I remember some discussions on the SCSI/KERNEL channel about improving
SCSI performance in Linux. I don't know what the current status is.

Do they really?  How much more?  I thought that the only difference in
memory usage between using shared and static libs was roughly the size
of the .sa file.  Is this incorrect?

[...consistent graphic library...]

Yes, that's wonderful.  I agree that a consistent LAF is a very Good
Thing.  However, having a shared library to facilitate this might not
always be the best way.  Consider applications for which you do not
have source.  What if for some reason you get your new version of this
super cool shared graphic library and it breaks those old apps?

That is correct.  I've had personal experience with this.  My first monitor
was blown by playing with random mode lines.  The mode I found seemed to
work, but shortly destroyed the monitor.  Even multisync monitors have a
frequency range they designed to operate in.  The difference is that normally
the frequency range is much wider, and the damage is not as major if you do blow
them.  Also manufactures are more likely to replace them if you do blow
them while they are still under warrentee.  At least Gateway replaced mine
with no questions asked.

Have you told that to your commercial vendors?  They certainly seem to
think they "cut it".  My copy of FrameMaker is a tidy 4.6 megs,
dynamically linked with only libc and libdl.  Budtool is a trim 3.7
megs, and it's statically linked.  These apps "cut it" every day for
us, and I'm sure they cut it for Frame and Delta's other customers
too.
