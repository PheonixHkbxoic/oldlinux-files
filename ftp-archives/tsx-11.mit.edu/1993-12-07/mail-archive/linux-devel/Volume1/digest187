Im looking for the last mail message that went out the astronomy update for
Linux. I have recieved a request for information about IRAF and SAOimage
which I saw on the last astronomy update. I don't seem to have it in my mail
archive though. Could someone please forward that to me again. Thanks,

Take a look at how many programs hack around /tmp_mnt to get filenames right.
For that matter, GNU Emacs and a few other programs contain hacks enclosed in
`#ifdef ALTOS' to cope with the old Altos WorkNet (@machinename/path/to/file).
And other magic hacks in `#ifdef APOLLO' for their old `//machine/path/to/file'
hack.  (Also note that both path schemes have been dropped by their respective
companies....)

You don't want to create magic roots:  too many programs know that root is /
and blow up if they discover any exceptions.  (GNU Emacs will grow pathnames
without limit unless hacked, because it's trying to get one that starts with
/.)

(On the other hand, you also want to avoid magic paths that turn into virtual
filesystems; consider what DOS does with a path starting \DEV\...).

Hi,

Have there been any attempts to write a NTFS (Windoze NT file system)
for Linux. If not so, is there any reason like not being able to get
the specs, or is it just that no-one has takn the trouble to do so.

Thx,

        This is not really true.  At boot time it looks to see if a unit is
ready, but in general the TEST_UNIT_READY command is not used to detect the
media change all by itself.  It is true that if the unit is not ready that we
assume a media change is taking place, however.

        The scsi standard requires that whenever media is changed that the unit
report an error with a CHECK_CONDITION status and the UNIT_ATTENTION in the
sense data.  The host is supposed to interpret this as a media change, and can
then retry the command.  This is the first line of defense for detecting a
media change.  Anyway, on my CDROM, disk change is automatically detected
whether or not you attempt to use the disc without a disc in it.

If only a decent version of the kernel for solaris 2 was available. Tried
piggybacked data on a syn|ack tcp frame to it. Watched solaris2 acking an
rst frame with a wrong sequence.. I think Linux might well be ahead on
the networking side too!

THe problem is its very hard to write a quick script that removes every
8 hour old core dump and checks it is a core dump by sizes, legal values
magic numbers and offsets. If someone writes a little c program 

isacorefile [filename]

Then the script isn't too hard.

This won't work at all.  The root fs is mounted by the kernel, not by some
rc script, and it's a special case because it's not mounted on some other
directory somewhere (which means that there's no reference count to increment).

The killer problem is that you have to be able to fsck your root fs, but you
*can't* unless /proc is mounted, and you can't mount /proc without the root
fs being writable, and you *don't* want to write to the root fs until you've
checked it.

Of course, you *could* have a "/dev/root" device with a special major and
minor number (say, 0 0) which the kernel understands as being the device
file for the root fs.  This would have to be a real device file, not a
symlink.  Then your scheme would work.  :-)

Okay...but how do you open() a filesystem when given just a major/minor
device number?  Is there some system call which can do this?

Wouldn't it be easier to use 'file' and write a magic entry for core
dumps in Linux?

We just went through that in the nos-bbs mailing list.

Guess what?  Piggybacked syn+data is contrary to the protocol spec:  how do
you send data when the maximum data size hasn't been negotiated yet?  BSD
TCP/IP sends data and blindly assumes the other end is all set up to handle
it, despite the fact that, so far as the protocol is concerned, the connection
is not yet fully set up and data is illegal.  And I know of two TCP/IP stacks
which adhere to the spec *to* *the* *letter* and therefore reject piggybacked
data on a SYN or ACK SYN packet.

Subject: IDE/interrupt latency patch
Date: 24 Oct 93 16:32:27 MDT


Quite a while ago, Linus was trying to improve the interrupt latency
problem in the IDE driver.  What he discovered is that some braindead
drives required interrupts disabled for long intervals.  He changed
the driver to work with even these drives.

I saw a patch to enable interrupts more often during transfers on the
net digest.  I was wondering if someone could point out where the
patch can be found.  

ALSO, I'd like to hear success/horror stories from people who try the
patched system on their hardware.  From what I understand, the
"non-compatible" list should be short.  Perhaps the kernel could have
an obscure macro to enable the improved latency?  (obscure so it would
only be changed by people willing to take the chance that they'll
discover their drive is one of the braindead).

thanks

This is a bug in your init. I can't speak for simpleinit but a SYSV init 
should run all the sysinit jobs as soon as it comes up and before doing 
*anything* else. The sysinit jobs typically run something like /etc/bcheckrc 
which is responsible for checking the integrity of the system (fscking root 
for instance) and performing hardware and related setup (setting the time 
for instance). Only *after* running the sysinit jobs is init allowed to 
consider the system useable.

  If your init doesn't obey this rule then it could, potentially, be nasty. 
If you have moved to mounting root read only you should simply never get 
reboot logged in wtmp (since it isn't writable). If you *haven't* moved to 
mounting root readonly (does SLS do this by default?) then init is writing 
to a potentially damaged filesystem before you can *possibly* fsck it! Your 
init needs fixing.

  Incidentally there *is* another init, the one in the bootsys package. 
Bootsys is old and buggy now - I saw no reason to continue trying to make it 
work on every distribution since none seemed interested in using a working 
SYSV model. Bootsys now forms the basis for the Purple Distribution 
available from my BBS (+44 734 590990) and others in the UK.

Not with linux - but I know that when I made some files 'tidier' in just
this manner in a multinet file on a vax is happily decided to change the
base of my numbers ( from decimal to hex I think I recall ) and I had
problems all over the place. 


SO its either a common bug, or correct ( though unexpected ) behavior. I
go for the latter.
