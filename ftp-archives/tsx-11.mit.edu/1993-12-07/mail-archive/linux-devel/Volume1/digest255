Ok,

Quick question folks, I am looking for something that will allow me to
support call-ins and dial-outs for synchronous 3780 protocol (EBCDIC).

Yes, I know this is a weird one, but the office is considering using a
linux box to automate transmission of batches to an IBM, and that's the 
only thing that can be used--can anybody help?

Do you think 100 expr's (and 100 test's as well if you are using
Ultrix) is more efficient? (Yes, I hear you, use Perl.)

(and that's essentially how GNU cat is implemented)

Granted, but your optimal cat won't be cat! Actually, I'd be more
concerned about the -e and -v switches if I were you. And -n comes
from BSD, not GNU.

Design your own set of disparate/disjunct programs and release
them. Don't expect us to suffer incompatibilities due to aesthetic
reasons (yes, I _do_ think that's what they are).

Keep in mind that 24 ports would take up 6 card slots and 32 would take up 8
card slots.  For example, on the 386 here at work we have 6 card slots total,
so a good maximum is really about 16 lines (with another slot for a multi-I/O
card and yet another slot for the monitor).  It should be possible to design
cards that would handle, say, 8 lines per slot, but from what I've seen they
typically use 4.  Depends a lot on the external connectors, too.  The mini-
dins used by my current card really couldn't squeeze 8 onto a single slot.
Someone said that used terminal servers aren't too bad nowadays.  I'm looking
at setting up a private network (probably starting with only around 4 to 8
lines, but eventually hoping to get bigger) and am wondering how cheap is
cheap?  :)

Says who?!  Where I come from, cat did block-by-block copies using stdio; cat
-u did block-by-block copies using read()/write() (and was so much more
efficient that I got into the habit of using -u always; some versions of cat
avoided stdio altogether and simply ignored -u).  It was only when someone
decided to adopt the stupid BSD "cat -n" nonsense that cat ended up being
inefficient all the time.

[[sarcasm on]] But then, since BSD did it it's obviously both "oh-so-true
Unix" and the only correct way to do it. [[sarcasm off]]

Perhaps they won't because there is no Imakefile...

Anyway, they are in the contrib directory of ftp.x.org just like other

Subject: Linux and Notebook Hotkeys
Date: 23 Nov 93 22:04:28

I am currently running Linux 99.12 on an MSDOS-free Samsung NoteMaster
386SX/25e and have been happily through quite a few kernel revisions.
I was wondering, however, what Linux does to make all of the special
buttons on my system stop working? 

For example, there is a button near the power switch which puts the
notebook into SUSPEND mode -- it works while LILO is waiting for
input, but then stops as soon as LILO begins loading Linux (even
before the kernel is uncompressed).  Is LILO at fault?  I know that
this feature is built right into the BIOS, since there is no DOS on my
system to use it, and it works fine immediately after LILO has
started.  Does Linux bypass the BIOS?  Some of the special buttons
seem to work (ie. the simulated internal mouse), but most (ie.
switching from CRT to LCD) do not.

I am no Intel hacker -- my previous system-level experience is with an
Atari ST -- and would be grateful for any information or advice on
this subject

After approximately 24 hours, the system clock slows down
about 40%.  The sytem clock is accurate for the first

I have the same problem with the same configuration. However, I suspect that
the slow buffer cache in pre-0.99pl13q (at least) kernels is guilty as well. 
As far as the Adaptec is concerned, I think that it should start synchronuous 
transfer as soon as the appropriate jumper is set. At least I didn't find any
hint in the ~/scsi-sources. Eric ?

OK, but as stated earlier in this group, the issue was discussed already

CDE will probably be optional the first year or so. But once it has
stabilized, it's a no-win to have two lines of development: one for
CDE and one for <whatever-other-desktop-you-have>.

I would expect the main CDE developers (Sun, HP, IBM, SCO, Novell/USL)
will standardize on CDE, and make their current desktops/environments
optional, unsupported software.

Hello Folks,

I recently updated from Linux 0.99.8 to kernel 0.99.13. 
Compilation and installation worked fine, but I found out that my
serial line cua1 where the modem is attached does not work. The mouse 
works fine however.

When I try to cu or kermit, it always says 'all ports busy'. There 
is no lock file in /usr/spool/uucp and with the old kernel it works
fine.

I would be glad for any hint. Please respond by e-mail too

or C... if it is often used, and speed critical, it doesn't belong in
shell scripts for end use.

Regardless the -n option has a tenuous place, given the original
design philosophy. The other options of cat deal mainly with how
characters are displayed, which is basically reasonable. I might have
a small dispute about the blank line compression, but that can be done
with a minimum of additional coding.

Anyway, the cat -n example was just that: an example. It was not
suggested that cat -n was GNU's doing, we were talking about
tar-1.11.2

>Design your own set of disparate/disjunct programs and release
>them. Don't expect us to suffer incompatibilities due to aesthetic

Please correct me if I am wrong but isn't the line numbering option
quite new? I certainly don't remember it from other systems I have
worked on, though most of those have been SYS V/BSD hybrids, so I
might have been looking at the wrong one...

Also, I question that it is just aesthetics. I'm sure most of us have
seen programs that were once simple and efficient, that later became
complex behemoths, possesing perhaps much power, but being quite slow
about the functions they originally performed...

To extend an analogy, adding the line counting option to cat is like
installing a line paiting rig on a corvette. It's a great car, and
it's still fast, but when you turn on the line-sprayer, you have to
slow a bit so the paint is thick enough.

Admittedly, cat -n is probably much faster than pr -n or something
with expr, but again, C...

You raise a bit of a valid point though... I have often thought it
would be nice if there was a {for i in 1...100} sort of construct, for
creating and numbering files.

Is there a way I have missed, aside of the yes|cat|head trick?

You are all clearly talking through your, uhh, never mind.

Anyway, GNU cat, when given no options (other than -u, --version, and.

And, in fact, so did BSD cat.

Subject: Socket implementation in Linux 0.99pl13, Fred !
Date: Wed, 24 Nov 1993 09:03:32 GMT

 Hello,

 I was scratching on the surface of my knowledge about
 sockets. Last night, I tried something out and have 
 some remarks from that experience...

 A few notes, maybe the author(s) can give comments on
 this, I have especially Fred Van Kempen in mind. His
 initials were on the man pages.

 1) In netdb.h *and* in the man pages, the gethostbyaddr
    is described to take as a first parameter, 

    const char *addr

    Now, for the call gethostbyname, this looks OK for me.
    I *could* be wrong, but isn't this supposed to be,

    const struct in_addr*

    for the first parameter ?

 2) In fact, I was trying to get the socket++1.5 library
    going on Linux, after some minor changes (not having
    gnu 2.5.x library yet...) and the change in the netdb.h
    file as described in 1), all compiled flawlesly. During
    testphase however, 2 system calls seemed to be missing:

      recvmsg 
      sendmsg

    Questions are, will they eventualy be implemented and in what
    timeframe? Is there a way to work around these calls with 
    functions which are indeed implemented?
    I did notice in the manpages that Fred wrote that it (recvmsg...)
    currently applied only to BSD, as of Linux 0.99pl11 this was
    still not implemented.

  If someone could shed some light on this, that would be nice...
