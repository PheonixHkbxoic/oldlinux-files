> I don't understand.

Okay. I'll explain slowly.

1. There is no need to extend the tar format to handle split files. The
splitting information can be carried in filenames, _as if_ the user had
physically replaced a big file FOO with a directory FOO containing lots
of little files FOO/0, FOO/32768, etc.; here FOO/n means ``FOO starting
at byte n.''

2. The same FOO/n format happens to handle sparse files as well. Bonus!

3. My understanding is that GNU tar uses incompatible format extensions
to handle split files and sparse files. That's pointless. It means that
somebody failed to _think_ before implementing the features.

4. GNU tar also has literally hundreds of lines of code to handle split
files and sparse files. The vast bulk of this complexity is unnecessary
and could be replaced by a much simpler, shorter set of mechanisms.

5. Finally---to get back to Brandon's point---the split file and sparse
file handling doesn't belong in the tar program per se. It would not be
difficult to write a separate program which handled those functions and
hooked nicely into GNU tar. One advantage is that you would not have to
repeat all the same handling in cpio. Another advantage---probably even
more important---is orthogonality. Only one program would pay attention
to sparse files, for example, so you'd only have to change that program
if you wanted to take advantage of some system feature to handle sparse
files more efficiently. Or the user could even substitute his own tool:
maybe he wants to handle sparse files, split files, _and_ tjkyrq files,
whatever those are.

I said _different_ programs.

Oops, no, now I see the light. There _are_ no different programs. This 
one monster application puts together the compression and archiving and
splitting features _so well_ that _no other programmer_ will _ever_ want
to put the same features into a _new_ program.

Is that what you're saying?

Back to reality. There is, believe it or not, more than one monster
application in the world. For the same reason that _you_ throw _your_
set of small functions into _your_ big program, _other_ people throw 
_their_ sets of small functions into _their_ big programs. The result,
as I said, is thirty different programs, each eating a hefty chunk of
memory.

They use the BIOS.  Pretty trivial when you're running under DOS.  Or they
use the native Windows graphics drivers in place of the MIT-supplied
framebuffer.  Or both.

Next question?  And it bloody well better not be "Well, why doesn't
XFree86 do that?", because I'm godawful sick and tired of answering that.

Ever here of 'modeDB.txt'?  The database that I've been maintaining since
before XFree86 and Linux were a dream for anyone?  The one that's included
in every single XFree86 release?

How about the new 'AccelCards' database that comes with XFree86 2.0?

Both of which are referenced in the XFree86 documentation.  Silly as that
might seem.

   What split versions?  If all files are smaller than the space on an
   archive volume, you do not have to split any files.  You take a list
   of all files to be archived and their sizes, and solve a knapsack
   problem.  Tar is then invoked multiple times, each invocation being

   archive volume being created.

It is precisely the case of files that cannot fit that I was
considering.

  I find the documentation for the FD macros to be a little skimpy (Comer
"documents" by giving one example, albeit a very nice one).  Here's my
question:  xbattle has a line "if (FDSET(blah,&blah))" in it, which works
fine on SunOS, but fails on Linux.  The SunOS FD_SET is:

  ((p)->fds_bits[(n)/NFDBITS] |= (1 << ((n) % NFDBITS)))

where the Linux FD_SET is:

  __asm__ __volatile__("btsl %1,%0": \
        "=m" (*(fd_set *) (fdsetp)):"r" ((int) (fd)))

  Now, the SunOS FD_SET may be evaluated, but gcc 2.4.5 doesn't think the
asm version can.  None of the documentation I've seen really mentions
whether anything other than FD_ISSET has a return value.  This may be a
simple question (replace the "if(FD_SET())" with "FD_SET(); if(FD_ISSET())")
but it might be nice to see the documentation explain this a little better.
This would of course be the Linux documentation since we're not going to
change either SunOS or Comer's book.  It's also interesting that this
works on SunOS.  Fluke or feature?

problem.  Tar is then invoked multiple times, each invocation being

It may be more efficient to deal with it all in tar.  I am not disputing
that.  The nit I was picking was with the assertion that you need to change
tar so as to make each volume be a complete archive.  Since that can be
achieved without changing tar unless there are individual files that are
too large for a volume, it seems more correct to me to say that it is the
support of large files that requires the changes to tar.

The only congratulations go to OSF for having introduced runtime
royalties in most/many cases, and in such a complicated fashion that
in order to know whether your copy of a binary is legitimate without
paying royalties one needs to:

  1) obtain and understand a rather complicated set of license
     conditions

  2) determine whether the copy is statically or dynamically
     linked, and with which libraries.

  3) find out which library version was used in the copy.

  4) ask the developer of the copy which license *they* have got.

To me it is this that looks DEAD WRONG.

It's not suprising that several people were confused.

What about the OSF reverting to the way simpler and more common 1.1.x
conditions (no runtime royalties if statically linked, period)?

What about using libraries for which the problem simply does not arise?

Can NCSA please put a statement asserting that its distribution of
the Mosaic binaries is legal into the anonymous ftp server next to
those binaries?  The text of Darrell Crow's message would be a nice
start, but I think more would be desirable.

Why do I ask this?  Out of caution.  Once before I have been involved
in a situation where distribution of code resulted in a major legal
squabble.  I would really rather that this never happened again.
It can waste many human-years of time that we cannot afford.

As a system manager at a UC, I might be held personally responsible for
the existence of any software which should not legally be on our systems.
This is true even if some random user obtains the code.  For this reason
I would like to see explicit statments from NCSA regarding the binaries.
The only statement I see there now is this:
> Note further that we may stop distributing any of these binaries at
> any time.

This rather cryptic message does not soothe me.  It leaves me wondering
if, perchance, the distributions might cease because of legal actions.
So I ask mereley that NCSA give me some documentation that I can put
in front of the lawyers noses should the police come to arrest me.

I was wondering if there is any standard in Linux for making application
distributions.  So far the only de-facto standard I have seen seems to 
be the one used by Slackware/SLS disks.  Allthough useful I think it is missing
a couple of key features.  Namely being able to handle upgrades of existing
software.  (So users configuration files and not overwritten) Also version
control.  I could be installing an older (obsolete?) version of a program
and don't know any better.
 
What do you guys think?
