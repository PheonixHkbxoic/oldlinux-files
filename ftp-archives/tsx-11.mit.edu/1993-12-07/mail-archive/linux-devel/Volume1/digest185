Yes, it's still very much on the list.  It took me longer than expected to get
the documentation from At-Lan-Tec, and the documentation turned out to be a
assembly code packet driver.  I'm about 2/3 (rough estimate) of the way
through understanding the device.  It would have been done long before now,
but I keep getting distracted by writing drivers for boards with better
documentation (although with Intel parts, "better documentation" is strictly
relative).

Right now my "todo" queue is
EtherExpress, 3c507     Very complicated. I have early alpha versions that
                        need to be debugged.
At-Lan-Tec, Z-Note      I've written the probe part of the Z-Note driver, and
                        tiny bits of the At-Lan-Tec driver.
AT1700                  Maybe...

After writing these drivers I'll probably be spending all of my free time with
code maintenance and answering questions -- that already consumes a
significant portion of my Linux hacking time.
