What I don't understand is:

Why didn't they use tk/tcl toolkit?  It has the ease of Motif programming,
and it is free!

I vote tk/tcl to be the toolkit of the choice.  If you have never looked
at tk/tcl, it is the time NOW.

O'Reilly will be coming out with a tc/tkl Book in the early '94 (it is
written by a professor at Brekeley whose name has escaped me.)  I have
seen a draft of the book, and this book is *good*.

Is there any chance for Mosiac to be rewritten in tc/tkl??  :)  <I know it

We seem to caught in a battle of duelling OSF representatives.  In response
to my posting about the possible difficulties this might pose for the
distribution of Mosaic,  I received the following from David Brooks at OSF:


In article <ellis.753644883@nova> you write:
  Mosaic is perhaps the single most important

I forget if I sent you mail about this before, but if I did I have to amend
it.

First: static bound copies attract no royalty or license fee; what is true
in general is that the target system must itself be licensed to run Motif.

Second: since NCSA is covered by an academic source license, they are
exempted from the requirement that the target system be licensed.  Hence,
any pre-linked copy of Mosaic can be used anywhere, under the current
rules, even with Motif 1.2.x.

If you require any more information please call Darrell Crow or Cathy Betz
at OSF (crow@osf.org and betz@osf.org, but 617-621-8700 preferred).

The (main) problem with 'modern' Pascal is that it's very nonportable.  Also,
is the size of an array still part of the declaration, having the effect
of enforcing name equivalence?  I also have to wonder if it's still in 
effect a 'one-pass' language, as per the old visibility rules.

Hmm - the books I know most about are not from O'Reily but from Addison
or Prentice.  The father of Tcl/Tk - Dr. John Ousterhout has one of the
two books, and he is going through Addison-Wesley.

I am not currently at liberty to mention the other books relating to

Here are the patches I made to Mosaic-2.0 to get it to working under
Linux. I think I mentioned this to the person in charge of net2Debugged
as well. It patches around Mosaic 2.0 trying to do non-blocking I/O on
a connect to a socket. Apparently, it works okay when doing normal blocking
I/O on the socket as well.. 

The patches are tiny. They just #if 0 out two small patches of code. 

It would be nice to get HDF compiled under Linux to get linked in, but HDF
requires DTM, and DTM uses sendmsg(), which Linux doesn't have yet. I wish
I was more savvy in network programming to be able to program around sendmsg()
but my attempts to fail about 50% of the time :( 
There was somebody who did Collage for Linux, and I asked for their patches, 
but all I got was a brush off from them ????? (Collage is a wrapper around
HDF mainly).

Hey people: get a clue!  BogoMips are _not_ a measure of system speed.
They are a measure of how quickly a processor does a loop that does 
nothing.  They are used by device drivers when they have to wait for
very small periods of time.  Reporting your BogoMips is about as useful

So, I'd like to hear if anyone out there has experienced trouble with

They are all saying exactly the same thing, which is what I had written
in my first report, that the Motif runtime binary licensing terms have
been signficantly tightened recently.

This is just disingenuous doubletalk -- it says that you need not pay
the royalty _twice_, not that you need not pay the runtime royalty,
which is due in every case, whether the binary is statically or
dynamically linked. It is also rather hard to avoid paying it twice or
more.

The runtime royalty has to be paid (unless the binary is distributed by
an educational license holder or the version is < 1.2) _always_; the one
choice is as to who pays it: the end user by purchasing for every one of
their machines, or the developer by paying it on every (first) binary
installed.

As I explained at length in another article, the distributor of an OSF
Motif application must choose to either pay the royalty on each and
every copy that is _installed_ (not merely distributed), or ask, each
and every time, for documentary evidence that the royalty has already
been paid for the intended end user machine. How probable it is that a
distributor would bother doing so is left to the reader to guess.

Also, in neither case the binary can be put up for anon FTP, because
distributors has a legal obligation to keep auditable records that prove
that the royalty has been paid, either by them or by the end user, for
each machine on which the application binary is _installed_.

All this if the binary incorporates a library version > 1.2 and is not
distributed by an educational licensee:

A big problem is that the Mosaic binary for Linux is not distributed by
NCSA, but by somebody that has a normal binary license (purchased from
MetroLink; but I have fuzzy recollection that perhaps MetroLink have
managed, by paying a large sum to OSF, to be allowed to offer the old
license terms on the new libraries).

There are also a number of other Motif freeware applications whose
binaries, if any, are not distributed by entities holding educational
licenses; note that the exemption from paying a royalty is given not to
educational institutions, but to educational license holders, and a
rather small percentage of educational institutions have bothered to get
an educational Motif license -- and they should not get one, because as
soon as they get one it will be risky for them to develop, if they ever
wanted, an OSF Motif clone.

All told, I reckon that the OSF move, and Brooks's explanation of it, is
amazingly hypocritical.

I don't see any good reason to use OSF Motif for free sw; most free sw
authors don't want to hire a lawyer to check they are complying with
OSF's new restrictive runtime binary royalty policy and an accountant to
keep track of how many royalties are due for copies installed on systems
for which the runtime binary royalty has not been already paid.
