        That's not a bug, that's a feature!

        A leading zero means interpret as octal, a leading 0x is hex,
else it is decimal. Also IP addresses can be less than 4 dot separate
parts. It is really a very flexible system (more than most will ever
need). For example:

0x7d.25.02401   ->      125.25.5.1

        Although the first form is really wacko, its legal. Not to
useful, but in some cases IP addresses are rendered as 0xHHHHHH (H=hex
digit), and it is nice to be able to use them.

        I'll admit though, the install script might want to remind users not 
to pad though.

P.S.    Take a look at source to inet_addr(). That shows all the forms
accepted.

P.P.S   127.1 is a convenient alias for the loopback.

The deal is that, since USL-derived Unix is not completely compliant with the
1170 API (nobody's *ix is as yet, I think) USL-derived Unix is "grandfathered"
for a period (something like a year) to continue to be called Unix despite
being non-compliant; after the year's up, if they haven't passed the
verification suite they're not Unix any more.

:-)

I don't see any manpages or info files for gas on my system, but doesn't it
have an option to pass the assembler source through m4?  That should be at
*least* as capable as TASM.  (I'm certainly making it jump through enough

Hello All!

Can anybody supply any exact information on kernel functions that have deal with
 interrupts and timer? We are writing character device driver for telex card and
 such exact information will make our life easy. At least, I can look at lp.c an
d serial.c and so on (that is what I do now), but I prefer exact info.

Please reply to: igor@petre.odessa.ua

Thanks!

P.S. Sorry if this is a FAQ question, but I don't see any FAQ on writing drivers

New ideas are great ... it's usually the implementation that screws things
up and leads to the dreaded BLOAT.  This is true of any large project.
Once you start adding features and *improvments* you reach a point where
you just need to scrap the whole thing and start over.  Yes Unix is old
but compared to the alternatives it is still "state of the art".

If it's a new OS you're after, it's probably better to start with a clean
slate  -  a full redesign.

A free Plan-9 anyone :-).

I can't comment too heavily here; suffice it to say, it will introduce some
bad synchronization problems unless it's done in the kernel (read atributes
in the FS).  Access requires VNOPS mods.

A/UX supports resource forks internal to the FS, not add on files.  The
directory manipulation of resource forsk is not allowed; they come and
go with the data fork.

This should have been 1.44M; the 800K's are the ones that *can't* be read.

Subject: Problem with time recorded in wtmp on reboot
Date: 23 Oct 1993 08:40:40 GMT

There is a problem with how the time is set in linux when the system
reboots.  The way it currently works is that the kernel reads the
hardware clock, ASSUMES it to be in universal time and sets the 
linux clock to it accordingly.  Then init records the time in wtmp,
and after that sources /etc/rc (which should fix the time using the
"clock" command, according to whether the hardware clock is kept on
local or universal time).  This causes incorrect behavior, for like
in the following scenario, with the example being at GMT-0400, and
with sysv-init:

root logs in at 10:00.  Reboot at 11:00.  While rebooting, the
kernel sets the system clock from the hardware clock, so the clock
is now four hours slow (since the hardware clock is in LOCAL, not
universal, time).  last will report that root was logged in from
10:00-7:00 (21:00), when in fact root was logged in for one hour.
It will record reboot at 7:00, source /etc/rc (which sources
rc.local which has the clock command), then record runlevel change
at 11:00.

I haven't checked the behavior of simpleinit in this case, but I
imagine that it would do the same.

Obviously, the clock needs to be set properly before init writes
to wtmp.  There are a number of different approaches, but it seems
best to me to make init run a script that will set the clock
properly BEFORE writing to wtmp.  This file could be called rc.clock.
ALL the different flavors of linux init would need to do this.
(Is there anything other than simpleinit and sysv-init?)

Then, the kernel need not set the time at all, it can just start it
at 0 (Jan 1, 1970, or whatever it is) and that way init must be
configured correctly to explicitly specify whether the hardware
clock is in local or universal time.

Another option would be to have the kernel configured to know
whether the hardware clock is in local or universal time, but
then it needs to have this configuration info hardcoded in it
(or passed in by LILO maybe), and it needs to fiddle with
zoneinfo, etc.  --> kernel bloat

Are you sick and tired of recompiling everything every time 
you make even a small modification to your kernel config file?
I know I am.  The following patch makes the command "make clean"
completely un-nessissary in most cases.  Here is what I patch:

  /usr/src/linux/.../Makefile
     --> I've modified make dep to use "::" instead of ":", so files will
         recompile when the source files are modified or touched.  As far
         as I'm concerned this should have been the output from gcc -M to
         begin with.
     --> I've modified make clean to remove core.* files, instead of core.
     --> Rules that are configurable by "make config" or an option in the
         Makefile (such as RAMDISK) are now dependant on the Makefile.

  /usr/src/linux/Configure
     --> autoconf.h keeps the same date even when you modify your config
         options.  This avoids rebuilding everything that includes autoconf.h
         needlessly.
     --> I also modify "Configure" so to touch files that use any of the
         options you change.

So far I've only tested this on my own system with the hardware I have install-
ed.  If you have any comments feel free to e-mail me.  I'll be waiting about
a week or so for bug/problem reports before I submit this patch to Linus.

                                           Bill

P.S. This patch requires "sed" and "grep".  If this is a problem both
these commands could be replaced with less efficient shell scripts.
