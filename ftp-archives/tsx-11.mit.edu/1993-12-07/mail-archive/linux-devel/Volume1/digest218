   There isn't an explicit mi/ and md/ split, but I don't think that's a real
   barrier.

   Yes, this is a major advantage.  You'll be able to directly use much of memory
   mapping and management code.

Well, actually you might want to check out the ongoing MC680x0 ports of Linux.
The Hardware dependent/independent parts are somewhat better seperated, if

        This followup probably doesn't belong here, but . . .

Are you using selection?  If so, dosemu doesn't tell the kernel it is
using graphics mode -- which is what stops selection from accessing the
mouse when a tty starts X.  Try killing the selection process BEFORE
you start dosemu.  Alternately, I posted a patch to the MSDOS channel 
which fixes this, but I'm waiting to see if it introduces any new
problems.

Hi there!
I am trying to disassemble the DOS device driver for the LMS CM-205
CD-ROM in order to write a device driver for Linux.
If anyone has information on the drive interface and the commands, I would
be pleased to hear from you.
I am waiting to get my hands on a logic analyzer to monitor the IO addresses,
at the moment the information I could gather is a bit vague, still.
The default IO address range on the bus is from 0x340h-0x347h.
The registers at 0x340-0x343 are read only registers, 0x342 is the data
register. 0x344-0x347 are write only.
Well, if there is anyone who can contribute a command list and detailed
description of the registers before I get the logic analyzer, I would be
very pleased to hear from you.
Thanks,
Carsten

The problem is not your PC.  The problem is with the serial port on the
SunOS host.  The PC's UART (regardless of FIFO) will never lose bytes
on OUTGOING data (at least not with a correctly programmed serial
driver).

Hi.  I've got my Linux machine mounting my DOS machine.  On the DOS

When I'm on the C: drive, sometimes I do an 'ls' and it tells me that it
cannot find certain directories, because they don't exist.

Also, when I mount the CDROM, I can 'ls' the directoreis and see the files
and cat them out, but 'pwd' returns an error.

Any ideas?

You are right, there is a problem whith the system include files (not the
program ones), I just hacked features.h  to define:

#define __CONSTVALUE    __const
#define __ptr_t void * 

This is a very bad hack, just to have the program compiled !
It is better to try to find the bug in the system include files if you 
have time, or wait for the next version :-)


You also have to modify the ${LIBDB}:  rule in the makefile, to just use
ar and ranlib proprely under Linux.

I'm presuming that you want to attach that many modems to 1 machine. For 
multiple machines you can possibly use 4-6 networked machines with STB
4Ports such that each machine has 8 modems attached.

But all attached to 1 machine is an interesting project. Current DOS/Windows 
based solutions I've seen have external controllers of some sort and of course 
custom programming. Muy Expensive.

Hardware seems to be the biggest obstical followed closely system overhead.
The typical hardware serial port structure for the PC can't support that many
serial lines. More like 8. So this project would require some custom hardware.
Obviously a shared interrupt line is a must.

System overhead would have to be reduced from the current 3-5 percent per line.
This can be done with lower interrupt rates and bigger buffers.

If I had the opportunity to do my own system I'd do something like this:

- Drop a custom parallel card with a single interrupt into the PC
- The card would interface to an external controller (I'm biased to the
  68K family but maybe a AMD 29200 family controller might be better suited
  to the task).
- Interface the controller to multiple serial chips. I'd probably pick
  the Cirrus Logic CL-CD-180 octal UART. While it only have 8 byte
  buffering, having 8 UARTS per chip makes the design more compact.
  BTW that is with full modem control, XON/XOFF and special character 
  recognition.

Anyway that's my thoughts.

Not anymore - even if most of the ACCEPT/DISPLAY verbs are platform speific,
they are normally easy to port ( and it is pretty easy to write a compiler
taking brand "X" cobol with screen handling and producing brand "Y" cobol.

It depends on the COBOL compiler. Some of them are generating pretty fast

For commercial programs, 4GLs seem to be the fastest development platform.

Here's an idea... how about getting a terminal server (an easy 12-14
hpone lines there), and an ethernet card for the Linux box, and going
from there?  Sounds liek it work, though terminal servers (liek the
Xytel) costs some $$$'s, but it woudl probably be less expensive and
easier to maintain than a bunch of different boxes answering 8 lines
each.

I can see it now... '/dev/ttyzz'!  Ack!  :)
