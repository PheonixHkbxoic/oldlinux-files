So you drop back to just "core" if the name is too long.

Ten-character program names are too bothersome to type anyway. ;-)

Please use "diff" correctly, i.e.
% cd /usr/src/linux
% diff -c boot/setup.S.old boot/setup.S

though personally I find diff -u more readable.

Why are you creating extra tables for "amibios" instead of using the existing

Subject: GCC crashing Linux: kernel bug
Date: Sat, 30 Oct 1993 22:40:40 GMT

WHY IS THIS IN THE DEVELOPMENT GROUP?

After much discussion in the .help and .misc groups, and after
hearing from other users with this problem, I am convinced
to the best of my ability to determine that this is a 
Real Linux Kernel Bug. As such only the developers of Linux,
who properly understand the kernel, have a snowball's chance
in hell of resolving it, and resolving it is important if 
we are to create a stable 1.0 release.

ABOUT THE PROBLEM

For those just tuning in: gcc, and no other program I have found,
sometimes crashes my linux system. Other executing programs then fail as 
soon as they try to do anything involving access to pages not in memory,
as far as I can tell. 

THE FAQS, MA'AM

Yes I have swap space. Yes it is turned on.
yes I have run top. Yes I see swap being used, in large
quantities even. No it doesn't crash every time. No I'm not
talking about thrashing- there is NO disk activity once the
crash sets in. My machine does thrash with other memory-
hungry programs, but they *don't* crash the system.

When I had 4 megs this was a daily occurrence. 

When I went to 8 megs it *almost* went away, but it still occurs,
infrequently. More memory = less often, not never.

File system damage is a frequent result (files here and there
get mislinked and munged, and fsck finds this after I reboot).

Another user contacted me and informed me that he has experienced
the problem too.

I am running .99pl10, which includes gcc 2.4.5.

I don't have any humungous static arrays being initialized.

I used to think that using -pipe stopped the problem, but
I just caught it happening with -pipe a minute or two ago.

ISN'T THIS A PROBLEM FOR THE GCC DEVELOPERS?

Nope. A bad user program in a proper virtual memory operating
system like Linux should never crash the system, no matter
how stupidly it behaves. Also, I use the same release of gcc
regularly on other OSes and never experience this problem.

SHOULDN'T YOU SHUT UP AND BUY MORE RAM?

I already have bought more RAM, and it does indeed help
(enough that my Linux system is now stable enough to 
develop software on). But that's not the point. Consider
that other users may be put off by the bug and not be willing
to take the leap of faith of throwing extra silicon wafers ($$)
in their grey boxes. Consider also that a bug like this
simply doesn't have a right to live.

SO WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO ABOUT IT?

The user who contacted me tells me that Linus acknowledges it but considers
it very hard to nail down and debug. I beg, humbly, but ON MY
LOUD ROCKING KNEES PRETTY PLEASE, for somebody who understands the
kernel to knock their machine back to 4 megs and do a series
of gcc compiles of various files until they catch it happening.
With 4 megs it shouldn't take long at all. Seems more common if
you're running X (but still happens without it- there doesn't
seem to be any absolute requirement that there be a certain
amount of resources called upon).

In the same vein, I would like users with 4 megs, or who are willing
to physically reduce their RAM to 4 megs for the experiment,
to try the test even if they aren't kernel gurus, to answer
the question as to whether it occurs only on a few machines or
on all machines at least when knocked back to 4 megs.

BOY ARE YOU GOING TO LOOK SILLY WHEN WE DEMONSTRATE THIS IS
JUST DUE TO SOMETHING YOU DID WRONG IN YOUR CONFIGURATION.

No, I'm going to be very happy if you can demonstrate that.
I want to fix the problem, not score ego points. I have posted
to comp.os.linux.development as a last resort after
exhausting other avenues, and also because, if I'm right
about the kernel bug, it is indeed a development issue.

  Does the Linux scheduler support fixed priority for "realtime"

not find anything.  Any comment is greatly appreciated.

Subject: Re: GCC crashing Linux: kernel bug
Date: 31 Oct 1993 02:19:35 GMT

In response to the guy with the GCC crashes, I am running
the alpha-f release, and still having the problem (instead of a hard
crash, gcc announces a "fatal sig-11").  You didn't mention
what disk hardware you are using.  I'm using an ultrastor 34F, and 
Linus has indicated that things are still being worked out in the
scsi code.  I would suggest to the developers at large that it IS a
low-level disk problem since it only seems to happen when the system
begins paging.  Most of the time I get the sig-11 message, but occasionally
I get a hard crash.  Also this only happens with GCC.  Any GCC folks out
there think of any system call GCC may use that would be uncommon in other
software?  I have also had a few crashes when using xv-3.00 when loading
in too many images.

A further note:  GCC typically will compile a full kernel if it is the first
task after a fresh boot.  Let the system work awhile, though, and give
it up.  Indeed, the longer it sits, the shorter the time it takes to get
the "sig-11".  Sounds like something is "unwinding" inside.

Hope someone finds it.

Well, that's why there is supposed to be such a thing as 'limit coredumpsize 0'
which doesn't work at all...it seems that almost every program ignores it
anyways... :(

Sorry, I don't have time to do so. These days, I'm trying to build the Mach
3.0 mk under Linux and config keeps dumping core at me. Now, that problem
could be related to yours.

        I've checked, rechecked, rerererererechecked the damn code. I've
build the executable with odemake. I've also build it by hand with diverse
combinasion of compiler and liker options. I've added some code to print
the program activity on screen. I don't understant why it keeps crashing on
a simple malloc call. I thought it might use too much RAM and added a swap
file to be sure, but it still crash. I also checked to be sure the program
didn't try do dereference NULL pointers. If the problem isn't in the code,
then it must come up with a precise sequence of malloc and free calls.

        I'll still check the code. I don't like to say that a program
doesn't work because of the compiler or the OS. (Well, sometimes it
happens.) If I find the problem is with the kernel (which I strongly
doubt), I will let you know.

        I believe I can confirm this bug.  I was recently trying to use 
Linux on a four-meg system, and it seemed to work well.  However, I was
totally unable to compile any sort of large application, even though I 
had defined 12MB of swap space.  Gcc would inevitably crash when trying to
compile the kernel, though how long it would take is questionable.  The error
I got was SIG 11, Segmentation Violation.  About half the time, Linux would
become unstable afterward and I had to shutdown immediately.  I never, though,
lost files because of it. 

        I upgraded to 8MB and *most* of the problems went away.  I've narrowed
the problem to swapping; gcc will *only* crash when it sucks enough RAM to
cause Linux to start swapping to disk.  If I use swapoff before I run gcc, 
I can compile the kernel perfectly.  

        I'm on a 386-40 with 8MB (now), using a 200MB Conner IDE.  It's a 
localbus system, but the HD controller isn't yet VLB.  I'm unsure of the 
brand name of the motherboard, but it does use the AMI BIOS.  

        I'd be willing to do any experiments the Linux authors think would
be useful to help isolate this; it rendered Linux totally unusable to me in
4M, and compromises system integrity on occasion even now. :(

Hi,

I have been following the linux newsgroups for some time now,
and despite postings to other groups, I have not been able to
determine what work is being done about the IBM PS/2 kernel support.

I would greatly appreciate if someone would POST an "official" update
about the subject, since many of us linux-less PS/2 users are
stranded.                                               

In addition, I would not mind working on it myself if someone would
give me some pointers on what specifically needs to be 
fixed.

Yep. Fortunately it's quite easy to upgrade to the Minix file system
with a maximum file name length of 30 characters. No need to compile in
new filesystems, same reliability etc.

.core adds only 5 characters to the executable name. There can't be a
lot of programs with names longer than 9 characters, so you might be
able to live even with the 14 char limit.

I didn't think it was a big deal which form was used

in the future I will take tastes into account.

I added the redundant lines because I wanted to avoid headaches for the
kernel maintainers, because if for some reason there was a change for
the Orchid Farienheit 1280 drivers, they would also affect the modes for
the AMI BIOS.  It is misleading to use the Farienheit 1280 line because
any changes to it would break the AMI BIOS support, creating another fix
patch for the kernel maintainers.  If you'll notice, there's a similar
line, except with the 0x55 and 0x54 modes switched that would work equally
as well.  I don't think the setup code is memory resident after the kernel
loads, so its really not that big of a deal anyways.
