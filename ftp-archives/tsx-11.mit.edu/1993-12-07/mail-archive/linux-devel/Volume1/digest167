There is also a Modula2-To-C translator called mtc available at:
        ftp.karlsruhe.gmd.de (hope i got that one right :)

The upcoming Modula-3 implementation from the DEC Software Research Center
will also support Linux (and there is a Modula2-To-Modula3 converter) which
might be the better variant.

2) The continuation of "flame" wars

    A little curtesy goes along way - Please try 'r'eplying via mail rather

I'm using a DC-2031 with MCC-interim .99p10+ and it works *great*.  This
IDE/floppy cache controller is for the ISA bus.  I'm running my ISA bus
at 16MHz.  The Promise Technology DC-2031 has an onboard ROM that integrates
the controller into the system on power-up, in other words the ROM is the
driver.  I don't know if this would be true for the DC-4030; but I believe
it is.  Otherwise you would need software drivers for DOS, OS2, etc.

A simple way of speeding up gzip is to compile with the options:

-O6 -m486 -funroll-loops

You could instead also have -funroll-all-loops.  It tends to give you 
5-10% improvement in speed, at the cost of a bigger binary.

What hardware compression?  It is my understanding that CMS uses Stacker's
chipset for compression, and it is on the optional controller card.  The
above hardware (Stats:) don't show the optional card.

I have used my old ST238R quite heavily and have not experienced
problems like this. On one occasion I had my partition table set
incorrectly and that resulted something like you had above. So, my
advise is for you to check out the partition table parameters, fsck the
fs, check the controller configuration (no overlapping IRQs or port
addresses) etc.

(I have nasty locking problems when using the XT disk for kernel
compilations and swapping, though.)

Subject: Can't install Yggdrasil - a workaround found.
Date: Fri, 15 Oct 1993 19:07:56 GMT


Hi gang,

I couldn't install the Yggdrasil CD-ROM due to read errors on my CDU31A drive.
So I borrowed a TOSHIBA SCSI CD-ROM, but found problems too.

The scsi driver uses INQURY command to determine device type.
The CD-ROM drive claims to be a DISK (type 0x00) rather than a ROM (type 0x05).
If I later mount it using /dev/sdc (I have 2 "real" scsi disks) it works, but
I still can't install Yggdrasil, because it tries to mount cd-rom as root and
doesn't give me a chance to fool the system.

So I made a simple patch to the kernel's scsi driver that works for me and 
probably will not break anything else. I don't check for Vendor field, 
because as far as I am concerned, every device that have a name starting with
"CD-ROM" should be forced to TYPE_ROM.

Here is a patch for 0.99 p 12. Yggdrasil is based on p.13, but I need to 
install it first!

        I just got and compiled tcl 7.0/tk3.3 . Now, I try to build a
shared library for it. I got tools 2.9, followed the instructions given
in the documents, everything went smoothly but when it comes to running

please tell me the trick?

BTW, I've also tried building shared library for svgalib081, but 
"getsize >jump.vars-new" gives _graph_mem size of 0? What's wrong?


        Thanks in advance.

Data compression dramatically increases the capacity of your tape drive.    
With data compression you can store about twice as much data on each mini   
tape. No special tape formatting is necessary.                              
                                                                            
Compression Rates;                                                          
                                                                            
Two types of compression are available. Choose OPTIMISE SPACE for STANDARD  
HARDWARE and software data compression, which reduces the size of the files 
backed up by about 50%. Choose Optimise time for high speed software data   
compression.                                                                
=========================================================================== 
Under DOS I can quite happily say OPTIMISE TIME.                            
                                                                            
Please tell me, reading this what do you think?                             
                                                                            
If I can't get more that 120Mb on a tape, me-thinks CMS could go bankrupt   
vary shortly....

Hi, I heard that Linux is being ported to the Apple Macintosh.  I
wonder what is the current status?   Thanks for any info.
