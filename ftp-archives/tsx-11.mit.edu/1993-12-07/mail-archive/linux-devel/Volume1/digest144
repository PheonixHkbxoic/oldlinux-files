Has anyone out there tried ftape with a Mountain QIC-80 style tape drive? I have the 330MBmodel with the Mach-2 tape controller for hardware compression, and Im afraid I won't be able to use the drive with Linux. ANy comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I have recently installed Slackware 1.04 (great package) get it. But I 
am no smail expert. My machine name is holly.can.com (and holly.uucp).
Yes my machine has to take email to others within my domain and forward
it to my uucp neighbors. I have a smarthost defined at van-bc just a uucp
call away. And I have two downstream feeds (ve7lad.can.com or ve7lad and
provar.can.com or provar) If mail comes in to my machine it should be
should put it into their /usr/spool/uucp/provar and /usr/spool/uucp/ve7lad.
Which would make sense. (they would call me and pick up their mail)
But it does not, it just gives it to my smarthost. This is very frustrating.
Also if I type mail ve7lad!bj or provar!root  it still gives it to the smarthost
If you have any suggestions please email. I am desperate for advice.


thanks

There is a system call called 'clone' which provides multi-thread 
capability.. however is is very experimental and not recommended.

If you'd checked FSF status reports you'd have found that Lucid and FSF were
exchanging information and code.  As for why it took so long, FSF wanted Emacs
19 to work somewhat differently from Lucid; they could share some code, but
the internals are dissimilar --- FSF had to develop the internals themselves
instead of using Lucid's code.

Well, the answer is that it depends.

With most serial ports, you have to do character at a time I/O.  The
character at a time is rather slow due to interrupts, etc.  Most
ethernet cards you can send an entire packet at once w/o needing to
send it a byte at a time due to DMA transfers.  So network connections
can be much faster than serial line connections and use less machine
resources.  Or have times changed so much that serial cards now do DMA
transfers on inbound traffic?

For example, I know that our main server marvin could handle about 20
active logins before it started getting a little slugish, while stan,
our modem server machine didn't really like to get about about 8
active logins before it started getting a little slow.  Granted,
marvin and stan were both Solbournes running old old old releases of
the OS (this was about 3 years ago I made these observations).

Just because telnet uses a whole ethernet packet doesn't make it slow.
There is more to speed than the raw number of bytes that you need to
get from point a to point b.

Subject: Handling of FP exeption
Date: 6 Oct 1993 08:35:15 GMT

While trying to port the POV raytracer to Linux, I had a serious
problem with floating point execptions.  POV is able to handle and
correct certain errors, but it need four pre-defined constants.
Unfortunately I was not able to find them in any of the Linux include
files.

Therefore I commented out the execption handler.  POV now works most
of the time, but hence the error handler is missing some pictures blow
the program up with "floating point execption".

This is the piece of code in question:

 struct exception *x;
 {
     switch (x->type) {
       case DOMAIN:
       case OVERFLOW:
        x->retval = 1.0e17;
        break;

       case SING:
       case UNDERFLOW:
         x->retval = 0.0;
         break;

       default:
         break;
     }
     return (1);
 }

Any hint if and where I can find definitions for DOMAIN, OVERFLOW,
SING and UNDERFLOW will be greatly appreciated.

Please respond via email because I am not able to follow this group at
all times.

Funny.. they never took that long when I built xview programs in 4Mb. Unless
you are using UIT and C++ in which case they take all day in 8Mb too. The
good thing about xview is the final binaries are fairly nippy and also the
xview toolkit is so easy to use compared with Xt that you get results much
faster. (Oh and it looks pretty).

What about the security issues. Setuid functions within a tcl/tk program
are a bit tricky. Also many people don't have room for all the tcl/tk stuff
on disk, its not that tiny - mind you nor is xview.

I'd vote xview

Just a little. Bits of kernel get very confused when you mix clone and
shared memory calls. Especially blocking calls that wake up half way through
to find the other thread has 'removed' a chunk of memory 8-)

Most modern computers have enough cache or hide the ram refresh time by
interleaving it into the proccesor accesses so that it is irrelevant. Its
not the kind of patch I'd recommnd to anyone anyway.

I guess your fears are right, since ftape is developed for QIC-80 tape
drives connected to standard floppydisk controllers (Linux hackers correct
me if I'm wrong). Special tape controllers may or may not work, dependent
on their compatibility to FD controllers.

If you are interested in partial backups of your Linux system (eg. packages
or some subtrees) I cannot help you, but if you are interested in an
image backup of your whole Linux disk/partition you may consider the
DOS device driver RAWDISK.SYS I released two weeks ago for such purposes.

RAWDISK.SYS maps an arbitrary part of your harddisk (given by a start-
and end cylinder) into a regular DOS file. This enables you to use
your DOS software delivered with your tape to select this file for backup
and thereby doing an image (sector-by-sector) backup of the HD area.
Since RAWDISK.SYS uses PC-BIOS INT13h, it is usable for a broad range
of harddisk types, although this interface limits its usability to drives
with less than 1024 cylinders.

You may get it by anonymous ftp from:

Part of this is very possible, unfortunatly it is very difficult for any

to have. To run something like UNIX, the user _must_ have knowledge of his
hardware, and how to configure/operate it.

:       2) X is provided as a normal part of the installation process.
This will probably never happen. XFree needs to know exactly what hardware
you have, and what scan rates to use. The could be cured with a BIOS call,
but unfortunately for this, the BIOS is completely shut off and ignored. 
This could be solved with a new kernel system call for setting the video
mode, but that would be completely unportable. XFree is not made _for_
Linux, it's made to be ported to (theoritically) any Unix-like 32 bit OS.
Every one of these OS's would need to have this unprotable video kernel
call for this ugle scheme to work.    

:       3) A graphical file management/browsing utility is provided that is on
:       par with that in Windows, the Mac, or NeXTStep.
This sounds great. All we need is for someone to donate time to make it
(not an easy task). We may even be able to convince a 3rd party vendor to
produce one, but then we would have to pay for it.

:       4) An installation of Unix, X, and a basic set of tools is on the order
:       of 60MB or less, not the 90 that is apparently the current norm for
:       Linux + X.  This may be due to software development tools being
:       installed as a matter of course, which "of course" doesn't make sense
:       in an end user OS.  They would be in a separate package.
This sounds very reasonable. The basic kernel + minimal user utils can fit
in under 8meg. There are also 'lite' versions of X. 60M or less is
definately possible (but including user apps would definately make it bigger)

:       5) Some basic utilities are provided (again X based) to do: a personal
:       schedule, rolodex, simple WYSIWYG word processing (on the level of the
:       original MacWrite or Windows Write), painting and/or drawing, a
:       calculator, clock, etc.  All should look like they belong together on
:       the same screen.  The effect should not be an attempt to see how many
:       completely different widget sets we can use.  The whole collection
:       should also be passably attractive with a 3D look or other adornment.
Sounds good in throey, but this requires much programming effort.
painting, calculator, and clock are available, but a 'nice' user interface
with the other apps you mention aren't there yet. Programmers and
organization are what's needed...

:       6) There should not be 17 different installations from as many
:       different vendors.  The user doesn't want to have to conduct a poll to
:       find out which Linux to get.
Impossible. Almost everything here is free. Everyone has the right to do
what they want with Linux so long as they don't go against Linus, GNU, and
all the other hard Linux workers wishes. If someone makes an excellent
easy to use super-duper system, people will find it. 

:       7) Reasonable attempts to set things up in such a way that the user
:       does not have to be a Unix expert or even be really familiar with it
:       at all in order to run his/her own machine in a single user type
:       environment.
:       8) Etc.  Obviously, all of these things imply that someone is going to
:       magically unfragment all of the different releases, make choices of 
:       apps that already exist or have to be written without pissing off more
:       than 50% of the target audience...
Almost all OS's require that a person have some clue as to what's going
on.  

I'm not trying to flame anyone here at all. All of these are great ideas
except for one thing - Unix is not DOS. DOS cripples the abilities of your
machine. Even DOS is a nightmare to configure properly to get the most use
out of your system. The other big factor is that all this Linux stuff is
free.  That means that the only real reward people get for their
programming effort are their names highlighted on ReadMe pages, and flames
from people when it doesn't work. Free doesn't pay the rent, so
development is often slow, tedious, fustrating, and undirected. The only
way that a 'nice' solution for UNIX/Linux/BSD will happen is if some PC
distributor pre-packages the OS and apps for you and supports what they sell.

I don't think Linux is dying off....the rate of increasing new
installations may be leveling off though...

OS's like Univel, Linux, 386BSD, Mach will never be simple for end users
to install and operate. Free OS's will lag behind commercial ones due to
the lack of money. It is unfortunate, but true. Programmers for free OS's
strive for solid _basic_ functionality - the more you glom onto crap, the
less usable a system is. Unfortunately, this means that ease of use, easy
installations, and cute interfaces are not high on the priority list. The
only thing we can all hope to for short-term is for other groups to
develop good free applications (or at least reasonably affordable ones)
and for us to improve documentation.  Linux and other OS's will come around
eventually, but I'm still in favor of getting end-users to learn something
for a change.  If people are interested in getting away from MeSsy-DOS and
Windoze then they should expect the have to learn new concepts, and be
curious enough to dig around and find what they need.
