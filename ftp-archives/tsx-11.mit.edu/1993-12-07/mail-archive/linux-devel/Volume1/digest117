Symbolic links from /config/* to the original locations would be a good thing. It doesn't bother the people how know where things are, but gives new sysadms
a simple place to find config files. I DON'T like symbolic links from places
to /config (from /etc/hosts to /conf/net/hosts). 

What is THE right /config dir structure?

        /config/net
        /config/X
        /config/host
        /config/mail

Does anything belong in /config ie. config files or just directories.

BTW /etc/ probably started out this way.

Subject: Disk Drivers in Amiga version
Date: Wed, 22 Sep 1993 10:36:08 GMT

Please could I implore the Amiga Linux developers to support the IDE disks
which all new Amigas have. NetBSD only supports SCSI and even then
only a few SCSI interfaces work with it. I guess as Linux on the PC
works with IDE disks it is likely that the Amiga version will too??

I was hoping to run NetBSD on my accelerated A1200 but as I can't 
I'll have to wait for Linux.

Heres hoping..............

This is a good idea.  A friend of mine who works at Microsoft did this
for their OS/2 (blech!) linker.  Of course, there are all kinds of
really nifty things you can do once you start feeding back profiler
data into the compiler and linker...

Actually; I think you should take that a little further and change *all*
system errors to the following format:

%<subsystem>-<severity>-<symbolic> -- <english explanation>

So you would see errors that look like:

%TCPIP-F-EINVAL -- Invalid Argument.
%EXTFS-E-EDSKTRSH -- Lost track of Inode. Filesystem Trashed.
%EXTFS-W-ENOINODE -- Couldn't find free inode. You may have trouble later.

Then you could go a little further and modify all the console logging 
so that console messages look like:

%%%%%%%%%%%  OPCOM  22-SEP-1993 09:17:09.24  %%%%%%%%%%%
Message from user "news" on mynode.my.domain
Expire: no permission on history.
%NEWS-F-EPERM -- No Permission.

Subject: An OPTIONAL /config 
Date: Wed, 22 Sep 1993 16:17:34 GMT


1. Obviously, the /config set-up will NOT replace any standard UNIX
configure files. It is meant ONLY to provide a front-end to let
newbies/UNIX innocents get [insert desirable state here] without
having to study the man pages for hours to figure out some trivia.
People who know "what's up" should be able to disregard it with no
loss. There should be an easy way to propagate the "/config" setups,
but they should not be "it".

2. As far as I am concerned, a *scary* number of linux boxes are
hooked up to the net. I would like to see "simple security" --- easy
ways for them to get correct setups because they'll never have any
clue about obscure sendmail holes [or whatever your favorite Net-bug
is]. (And please, don't pretend that a standard linux setup (a.k.a.
"I just installed NET-2 myself...") is going to end up properly
configured. Maybe not even if they do RTFM ;-)

Subject: Ricoh GS-1 generic SCSI host adapter
Date: Wed, 22 Sep 1993 16:59:37 GMT

Does anybody out there have any information (jumper list, programming
guide, etc.) or drivers for a Ricoh GS-1 generic SCSI host adapter?
This is an 8-bit PC adapter based (as usual) on the 5380; it has an
on-board BIOS and an 8k SRAM.  The design dates back to 1988, the board
I have was built in '90 or '91 I believe.

I bought it surplus, without documentation.  My goal is to figure out
enough about it to get it to work with Linux.  MS-DOS support would be
an extra win if it's possible.

I'm trying to chase down somebody at Ricoh who might have information
about it... no results so far.

This is an updated copy of /usr/lib/makewhatis (from slackware 103),
which seems to handle hyphenations better, as well as working better
(for me) with many of the slightly non-"standard" manpages on my system.

I didn't write it, and my name ain't on it.. I merely modified it.

I still don't get it.  The way I understand it is:

  /config is supposed to be a series of (say) shell scripts that are
  used to parse the various files in /etc so that sysadmin tools for
  newbies are easier to write.  The programs in /config won't really
  be run directly, because the excellent sysadmin tools will be the 
  interface of choice for newbies and hackers can still use /etc
  directly. 

What does this gain us?  The sysadmin tools should not be reading
directly from /etc but rather calling the access routines in libc.
For example if we want to look up a hostname, a call to
gethostbyname() is much preferred to parsing /etc/hosts because it
will allow NIS, NIS+, or DNS lookups to be made instead of only using
local files.

I say that good sysadmin tools should be written to assist newbies.
These tools can safely be ignored by hackers who would prefer to muck
around in /etc directly.  However this /config stuff is just extra
baggage that we don't need.

Required.  ANSI-conformant compilers must issue a diagnostic for
code containing syntax errors, such as the above.

NB. The -traditional or -traditional-cpp flags to gcc will
    allow it to compile the above sort of code.
