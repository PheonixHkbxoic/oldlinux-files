There are alternatives to OSF/Motif to get the Motif L&F.  How about

        tcl/tk  (free)
        OI      (free on Linux)
        Galaxy

Now all these may not implement all the features (or the bugs) of OSF/Motif
so your mileage may vary as to whether or not they're useful.  The point
being is that the L&F is independent of the OSF/Motif code.

    Thanks for the quick reply and fix, this works great.  For those
    who haven't been paying attention to the ether-net how-to (I'm guilty), 
    it has changed 100% from the August version.

    Sadly, this change does not seem to fix the problem.  I have tried this
    in conjunction with 3 different machines (all using at1500) on each patch
    level from 13s -> 14.  The lockup still occurs.

    Since there is the workaround, and 13r runs very well if you don't want

    incorporate the functional auto_irq.c ?

I have a modest question.  What is it that's preventing any of these
Linux releases from being version 1.0?  Is there a particular ideal
that isn't yet realized, a particular the feature set that has not yet
been met?  Or is it just that the idea of releasing the big ONE-DOT-OH

Ah, the OSF doesn't have a monopoly on the look and feel.  The OI
toolkit has had it for years (and there are no runtimes).  OI, for
those who don't know, is a C++ X toolkit that implements both OPEN
LOOK and Motif and is available on a wide range of platforms.

To be fair to the competion, there are other toolkits as well that
have a Motif look and feel as well.  OSF's Xm isn't the only game in
town.

Subjective.  I happen to agree with you but its still subjective.

>       - Slow

I doubt it.  You may have a slow X server or slow hardware or a slow
Motif application (or a slow Motif window manager, which is just another
application).  I've seen and heard nothing to suggest that the Motif
toolkit inherently makes your applications slow.

>       - Difficult (read impossible) to program

I can't really argue this since I've never tried to write a Motif program.
But the various applications out there seem to argue against this.

>       - Licensed

That's certainly a drawback...but its a drawback for a lot of things.  Are
you suggesting people shouldn't write applications fro UNIX since its
licensed for example?

It would be nice if the technology were free.  That isn't an absolute
necessity in my opinion...especially as its cost becomes bundled in with
the cost of most commercial OS offerings.

>Why
>       - Does there need to be a workstation interface "standard" ?

Because users want it.  They hate having to learn an army of different
applications, each with a different convention for mouse behavior and
so on.

The Mac didn't get popular because of its speed or (at least initially)
the wide variety of applications.  It got popular because once you learned
to use one application (including the finder) you had stored up a wealth of
knowledge about how other applications would behave.  Consistency, more
than any other factor, made the Macintosh.

>       - Does it need to be Motif (as it seems to be by default)

It doesn't "need" to be Motif.  Their only serious competitor, though,
was Sun with Open Look and they have, for better or worse, conceded
defeat.  And Motif support is specified in some significant percent
(don't have the numbers to hand) of bid specifications for new systems
and software...in other words, purchasers have been asking for it for
whatever reason.

>Just waiting for GNU to come out with an interface spec... :-)

A couple of years ago it might have been possible for FSF (the GNU
people) or some other body to come up with a specification and 
implementation and gained some significant support.  By now it
is probably too late though it may be worth a shot.

I think one way of approaching the problem might be the way OS/2 goes
about it.  When you install and configure OS/2, it opens a
(full-screen, of course) DOS/real mode session, in which it calls the
BIOS to set the modes (which most, if not all BIOSes let you do) and
then reads the timings directly off the video board.  Such a probing
program should be a lot safer since it gets the video timings from
BIOS, and the BIOS video timings are usually safe (although maybe not
optimal, but it's better than nothing).

Such a probing program may or may not be practical to implement in a
Linux VM86 session; if not it could always be constructed as a
self-bootable floppy (just so we don't require DOS!).  A floppy could
store the timing data on the floppy itself from which a program could
restore it and convert to an Xconfig file.  A program that spawns a
VM86 task probably could get the data via some form of IPC.

And BREAK SELECT AGAIN!  It's silly to have a system with
everything broken perfectly to Posix spec, except for select().  

The way to handle this is in the C library - leave the old
select entry in the shared libraries so as not to break binaries,
leave the old system call as linux_select(), and for new
compiles alias select() to a library routine that provides the
Posix behavior by calling linux_select().

This may seem like trivial nitpicking, but Linux is good enough
that this is now a serious problem, and the longer we wait to
fix it the worse it will get.

Date: Tue, 30 Nov 1993 01:42:52 GMT

I believe that there is a bug in the new 0.99.14 kernel's makefile.
Apparently the symbol KERNELHDRS is defined but never used, so none
of the sub-makefiles (and thus the programs spawned from them) have
any earthly idea where to look for the include files. The quickest
solution to the problem seems to be appending "-I /usr/src/linux/include"
to line 77 of the main make file. That is the line which defines
the symbol CC. 

Hope this helps someone,

We are currently waiting for the networking code to stabilize.  Fred
and Alan are doing intense development on the network code, but many
crucial features are still only available in rather unreliable form.
We are getting close, to be sure, but once the network code is good I
think everyone will agree it is time for 1.0.

Part of the reason is that 1.0 marks the point where we are telling
everyone that Linux is ready for public consumption, not just if you
are willing to tinker with it.  If you *are* willing to tinker with
it, the version number shouldn't matter.  Probably a lot of people
will look at Linux 1.0 and make a judgement (pro or con) for Linux
once and for all, and we'd like it to be pro.

As for me, I am a happy tinkerer who manage three networked Linux
systems, two of them NFS-linked together, and one SLIP only system.  I
am *very* happy with it.

True; however, as you point out, many libraries are not released under
LGPL.  I thought the LGPL experiment was not considered successful,
and FSF was not planning to license anything else under it.

I don't follow this at all.  Mark is merely saying that vendors are
generally in business to make money and therefore are happy as long as
they get some.  The FSF, on the other hand, is in "business" to
promote its ideology of how software should be, and you can't just pay
for the rights you want.  Which of these is more restriaining is a
topic I would not like to see debated, but it's pretty clear that each
has its restrictions and its benefits, none of which have anything to
do with armed robbery.

UIL is inherently slow.  Or at least, it slows an application down.
The next time you detect a "slow" Motif app, check to see if there's
a .uid file that goes with it.

Some folks choose not to use UIL...

Nope, this isn't the announcement of a driver for it, just some

I can say for SURE that it won't be hard to patch Linux for this drive.
Here's why.
The drive works FINE with my Yggdrasil LGX Beta release (Spring '93 i
*think*). I was somewhat surprised to discover this after having the drive
fail to work with the Yggdrasil F93 LGX release. I discovered this by
accident (stuck my old beta boot disk in by mistake).

I don't have the technical knowledge to fix the driver myself, or I would.
I hope this helps someone else do it.

A better solution is to simply add the required symlinks in
/usr/include/{asm,linux} to /usr/src/linux/include, as documented

Some one is writing a driver, although it's not even in pre-alpha yet.

If you're interested in ALPHA testing, your best bet is going to be
