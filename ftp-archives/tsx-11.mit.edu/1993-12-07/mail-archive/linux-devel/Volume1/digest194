Simple question, in the subject line.

- The thing is, what with my recent purchase of a decent 486, if RARP's
working, I'll volunteer to hack rarpd & tftpd into working order...

I happen to know this place I can get really cheap suns (8-), and the
prospect of running xkernel on one or more old 3/80s around the house,
is REALLY enticing.  8-)

Some aspects of 2.88MB support are in the pl13 kernel (and it hasn't changed
much in a while).  However, they do not work (failures when trying to read).

In order to clean up the floppy driver sufficiently to support 2.88MB drives,
and also to permit floppy tape support, Sam Chessman and I are completely
rewriting the floppy driver.  It is a big task, stay tuned...

Anyone who wants to help, let me know by e-mail.

Hi Linux hackers,

        I am wondering if there are any drivers available for the
Xircom PCMCIA ethernet card around? or does the current ethernet
driver support that (I don't think it will, but I will ask anyways).
If someone have any success using that card in their notebooks, I
would like to know how.. thanks a lot!!

Hello, SyQuest users!


I have a Toshiba T1900C Laptop and I am attempting to connect a SyQuest drive
for 105Mb 3.5in disks, supplied by Spin Peripherals Inc., to it.

So far, I only have the SyQuest drive, and the Mac driver (which is useless for
me!)


I wonder if anyone has any advice on the following queries:

a) Is there any way to format the SyQuest (105Mb) for DOS/LINUX? If so, 
where can I get the program?

b) Can anyone recommend any PCMCIA SCSI adapters so that I can use the SyQuest
with DOS/Linux?


Thank you very much indeed in advance for your help.

I think this is what SVR3 called the "buffer dribbler" or bdflush. It is
tunable in that you can configure how often it runs and what percentage
of the buffer cache it scans for dirty buffers. If you set it to 30 seconds
and 100% you get .... sync()!

I played around with this quite a bit under Motorola's SYSV/88 SVR3 system.
I will, if/when I get time, hack this into linux. I will let you know what
comes out.

Not so easy to give an exact error msg when the system is totally down
:-( I  enabled user-quota, let    my  incoming uucp-call  login,   all
working.  When the uucp-commection is ended, the system locks up! This
means I still can switch between various  vc's, but if  I try to login
on one,  the  password prompt  doesn't come. In   logged in sessions I
cannot type anything.  Even the "AltGr-Roll" Key  to  get the register

Without activated qouta, no problem at all. The uucp has a normal user
id to logon, something above 400. So this isn't the  source of error I
first thought of.  My Qouta-Patches were  for pl12, which  is what I'm
using.   I have some  other  patches incuded,  too. Like  the last IDE

BTW: The starting poster gave a patch to  qouta which actually removed
one bug  here:   Until now I   couldn't umount  some partitions,  they

Subject: Re: ugly name for core dumps (core.imagename) -> patch for "img.core"
Date: 27 Oct 93 17:00:50 GMT

This discussion has already taken place in the BSD/386 mailing list
(some of the participants included ex-CSRG members).
Conclusions (according to my recollection):

    1 - 'name.core' is better than 'core.name', but now is a little
        late to change things.
    2 - 'core.name.pid' is dangerous. The reason to use 'core.name'
        instead of 'core' is not to make it easier to discover which
        program has dumped core (use file(1) for that) but to prevent a
        core from some daemon to overwrite other cores. The problem
        with 'core.name.pid' is that a daemon launched from init or
        inetd that always dumped core could fill the root partition.
        And if you want to be sure that no core is overwritten the
        proper way would be something like 'core.name.time_in_us'
        (pids wrap around after ~30000).

For BSD/386 someone has made a "commitee solution" patch.
With this patch the behaviour is selectable when the kernel is configured.

Later on you have statistics that state that only in 15% of cases a

WHAT? It has to *scan* the free list for a buffer? Cannot it just take
the first buffer and run scared? WHY? :-) :-)

Searching the free list? Just Say No.

Michael> A much-vaunted 'free list' doesn't help if it's empty.

But at least one does not have to scan 15,000 entries (which costs 50ms)
on the 'free list' just to discover it is empty.

Also, scanning for a clean buffer is very, very bad -- this victimizes
clean buffers in preference to dirty ones, and is a no-no. Ideally the
free list, and indeed the whole buffer cache (and no 'free list' should
exist, perhaps), should be sorted in some definite order, say LIFO, and
the get-me-an-empty-buffer logic should choose the buffer to reuse
solely on the basis of its expected reaccess profile. Easier said than
done, perhaps, but given that people are willing to muck around with
this, it would be nice that it were done "right".

BTW, even with the current design, a suitable heuristic might be: if a
suitable buffer is not say within the first N (N perhaps between 50 and
100) withing the free list, just allocate new space. But perhaps this is
an expensive operation.

Subject: [Q] Comtrol "Smart Hostess" serial card under Linux?
Date: 27 Oct 1993 21:28:57 GMT


Greetings,

   I recently picked up a Comtrol "Smart Hostess" card (older rev A card)
and am hoping to get it working under Linux.  I've looked through the FAQ,
HOWTO's, Device lists, etc and I see that the Smart Hostess isn't currently
supported under Linux.

   My question is: is anyone working/planning on getting a Smart Hostess
(or any other Comtrol serial card) up and running under Linux?  There seems
to be a fair amount of techie/programming information in the User's Guide
so I would imagine that it's in the realm of possibility.  (I've done a
fair share of hardware & low level software development -- it's mostly a
matter of finding the time to write the driver :-)

   Does anyone run a Smart Hostess card under any other operating systems?
(Yes, I know this is a Linux newsgroup, but I'm looking for any/all info :-)

   I also have some Smart Hostess specific questions.  I've talked with
the folks at Comtrol (they were *very* nice and *very* helpful).  They
answered some questions, but most of the stuff they have is for the newer
cards or newer versions of older cards (I think the "Smart Hostess" is up
to revision F -- I have rev A circa 1985).  They are going to try dig up
some info about the rev A card and ship it off to me, however I am curious
to know if anyone is running this older card, how it performs, etc...

   advTHANKSance.

AFS specs exist.  The code would have to be written from scratch,
based just on the specs.  Sounds kind of like the kernel of a certain
operating system kernel we all know and love.  That is, it can be done.

> AFS sucks anyways.  Use NFS :-)

Theoretically, AFS is more powerful than NFS.  AFS has lots of cool
design features.  I would talk about the implementation, but I'm not
really in a Transarc flaming mood right now.  Maybe later.

> AFS would be better than NFS, but I don't see what is the point of trying

AFS _is_ used.  At my little college, almost all files are in AFSland.
I want to be able to access those files from my Linux box.  (Many of
the public workstations are Solaris, so you can see how important my
Linux box is to me.  :-)

> You can probably get by with the AFS to NFS translator.

Now I'm in a Transarc flaming mood.  The translator sucks!  It erases
random files, it crashes often, it's slow, it's truncated my RMAIL
file to zero bytes several times...  It's really quite bad.

> And why are they locked out?  AFS is available for a variety of

They are locked out because some people (like us nutty Linux users)
want to put non-AFS supported systems on networks containing mostly
AFS-supported systems (like my schools campus network).

Fine, so it should be reimplemented.

The point of this message is: I'd really like to see a freely
distributable AFS client, and if anyone out there is working on one,
I'd be more than happy to help test and (in my copious spare time)
develop it.

I recently installed linux version .99.6 with xfree86 1.2.  I had problems
getting my microsoft inport/bus mouse working.  I checked the source code
and noticed that the irq level was hardcoded to 5. I powered down  my
machine and configured the mouse at irq 5 and now the mouse works.  The
problem is that it is way to hypersenstive. I tried using xset m without
sucess.  I noticed that when linux would come up my machine would
recongnized 4 different types of bus mice. So a re-built the kernel with
make config with only the microsoft bus mouse enabled.  My keyboard came
upin danish, so I had to edit the Makefile to configure it to be a north
american keyboard, recompile and reboot.  Now my keyboard works fine, X
comes up and the darn mouse is still hyper-sensitive.  Now when I try to
do a ctrl-alt-backspace my monitor goes crazy. Should I upgrade to another
version of linux and xfree86 ?  Someone else had the same problem with
their mouse and recompiling the kernel fixed the problems.  For those of
you that have linux and X working properly with a microsoft bus mouse,
what version of linux do you have and what version of xfree86 do you have ?
I don't want to have to spend big bucks on a commerical unix/os for my pc
