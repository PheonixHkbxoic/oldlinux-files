Tried exactly the same.  I've got no network at home, but we're trying to
get the network stuff going at the University.  Even using the loopback
net, just `rlogin myself' followed by logout crashed the system without
any message!?  At least that works on plain pl13.  Now I trust that the
inet-D package is debugged, but how does one get it *properly* linked
to the kernel?

The first thing I want are *reliable* remote running X11 applications.
The second thing I want is nfs.  NIS would be the greatest!

Has ANYONE every gotten "term" to work between Linux and AIX?

I configured term with no problems but when I run the utility programs, 
they just hang.  I sent a note to the developer.  He said that he has not
had any luck nor heard of anyone that got it working correctly.  So, how

I'd prefer the following:

- forget about /conf
- write programs (or just one) that have a good user interface (menus,
  context sensitive help, and whatnot) and that allow the user to
  manipulate the so called configuration files (/etc/passwd,
  /usr/lib/uucp/Systems, /foo/whatnot)
- let scripts be as they are now, i.e. they have the ability to 
  include comments, and they need to be edited with an editor (because
  of the required flexibility)

This would have the good effect that it is 100% compatible with the
rest of the Unix world (or as close to that as possible), and, if the
user interface program is done properly, it can be used with other
systems as well (all the world's not a Linux, if you know what I
mean; those other systems might have good ideas for a lot of stuff,
and I don't have to point out that the more users you have, the more
testers you have, and the fewer bugs you have).

Subject: SYSV to Linux porting issues
Date: Thu, 23 Sep 1993 21:34:21 GMT

I have been porting a large library of routines dependent mostly on System V,
and have some questions to ask and some problems to mention (hopefully the
problem report will help others).  I am using the latest Slackware
distribution.  First, the questions:

1. Does anyone have implementations of the plock() or lockf() routines?
   They seem to be missing.

2. Has anyone out there hacked f2c to add the %val() intrinsic function?
   It is a VMS extension which allows passing arguments by value.  A very
   useful feature, and a very common extension.

3. Is it possible to access the process file system using the standard
   ioctl names?  I can't find PIOCPSINFO and its cousins anywhere.

Now, the report:

1. The System V IPC functions shmget, msgget, and semget do not act the
   same way on Linux when zero is specified in the "flags" argument.  While the
   documentation says that the permissions are set to the low 9 bits of
   the flags argument, in actuality the permissions do not get changed when
   zero is specified.  Instead, the permissions which were set at resource
   "creation" are used.  For software that relies on this feature, suddenly
   you get "shmget: no permission" errors.

2. The shmop call apparently does not always return zero when it succeeds.
   Code which checks for zero thinks it failed, even though it did not
   return -1 and it really did succeed.

3. The /usr/include/sys/shm.h file should include <linux/page.h> before
   <linux/shm.h>.  The SHMLBA definition is based on a name in page.h.

I guess that's it for now.  Overall, the port has been going very smoothly,
but there are just some rough spots.  Thanks to anyone who can provide any
assistance.

If you simply use procmail as the default mail-delivery agent, it will do

This is basically the same as what I suggested, with the exception that
the translators are built in to one utility program for each configuration
file.  You run the utility, it translates the file into an "easy" format,
the user edits it, and it saves back the original file.

What I suggested is also 100% compatible with the rest of the Unix world,
too!  There would be nothing preventing anyone from porting it to other
systems.  The advantage of having files in /config (or elsewhere if you
prefer) is that you can deal with SETS of configuration files which are
loaded with redundancies.  If you make one change that affects three
other config files, then when you "compile" your changes, all the
appropriate files will be changed.  This ensures consitency of all the
config files on the system, something which your method doesn't give.
This seems a significnat advantage to me.

Not me. The first try (compile out of the box) lead to total failure.
Several posts in the linux newsgroups suggested using a bsd-like
environment (compile with bsdcc, and link with -lbsd before any other
library). That makes at least term itself work under AIX, enough to
handle exactly one trsh connection. I have also tried compiling with
gcc instead of the AIX c-compiler, no improvement. I gave up, since
there are enough other computers with non-broken operating systems
around (I now run term to a Sun running SunOS 4.1.2 with no problem)

There are reports on the newsgroups that AIX's non-blocking serial IO
is broken. I don't remember any single post with someone claiming to
have term working under AIX.

Note that AIX is a very "fuzzy" operating system, with many version,
many subversions, and then with literally thousands of PTF's (patches
in IBM-language) which can be optionally installed, so success on one
AIX machine does not mean that it will work on any other machine. If
anyone really has term working, please post:
- The exact commands used to compile and link the program
- The version of AIX used
- When AIX was installed
- ALL (and I mean ALL) PTF's which have been applied to this AIX.
My above experience is with AIX 3.2, and I'm too lazy to track down
the sub-version and the PTFs (we have probably installed hundreds),
using cc, bsdcc, and gcc 2.4.5.

Note: AIX makes Linux's (and SLS's) system of releases and patches
seem civilized.  AIX is one completely f***ed up operating system, in
my not-very-humble opinion.
