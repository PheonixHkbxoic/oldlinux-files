I refuse to believe that anyone who knows QUEL would rather use SQL

tell us you know QUEL but actually LIKE SQL?  Frankly that defies

On the other hand, if you are just saying SQL is "standard" and widely

ho-hum; you and me both.  But that does not contradict Zeyd.  QUEL is 
the better language--it's not popular, but it IS better--and no one
would rip it out of University Ingres to put SQL in, because (I 
conjecture) no one using University Ingres is going to be concerned 
about maintainability etc. and the virtues of QUEL are manifold and
manifest.

So, Buzzt yourself, and thanks for playing.

   I've seen this question at least twice within the last couple of months, but
never an answer: has anyone ported rpc.lockd over to Linux?  Or developed a
workable substitute?

   Sun's PC-NFS package can mount UNIX filesystems on PCs, with optional
file locking support, if the remote server has rpc.lockd running.  For now, it
doesn't appear that you can mount Linux directories on a PC, IF any of the PC
applications require file locking.

Ouch!!!!!!!!! That means that if someone decides to implement it, there will 
people rallying against it?! I sure hope not! Maybe make something like that 
configurable.

I don't like to see development discouraged.

I myself and a friend have quite a few things we would like to see in Linux. 
Things like raw devices, async I/O, etc, etc. Things that would make Linux 
a more complete operating system. We (and other contributers), would be 
willing to implement stuff ourselves, but certainly not if it isn't going to 
be in the main kernel distribution.

Hacking something into a kernel to get a feature I need is acceptable.

(I am willing to implement features I need/want. I am not going to just sit 
back and whine and do nothing useful. I can understand developers frustration 
at those type of users.)

But:

Hacking something into every kernel that comes out to get a feature I need is 
_NOT_ acceptable!

In other words, please give us small-time developers a chance to contribute. 
It will make us all much happier and Linux much better. If it works, let it 
go into the kernel, unless there is a _very_ compelling reason to do 
otherwise. If it is questionable, just put a config option to enable it.

This is _NOT_ a flame, merely a suggestion.

`xdm' set's $PATH to a strange default value.

That's all i found out till now (2:20AM).
Tomorrow I will go on ( so don't flame if i forgot something)
Is there somebody who knows more? let me hear!

Hehehehehehe. Actually, I have thought about it, and it would be
relatively possible to add a few device drivers to emacs, and maybe
some system calls, and you could just have your bootblocks point
straight to the emacs binary.

Might even make it a little faster. It can already be used as a shell...

Agreed. On the other hand, I can do without the days of memories too
small to handle a medium sized data-set.

My goal in memory size has always been to be able to have the entire
Manhattan phonebook in memory, as well as the OS and my favorite
programs... We're almost there...

Hmm...Is this little lifesaver documented anywhere (other than the

like it?  I took a quick look through my documentation collection,

Date: Mon,  6 Dec 1993 00:09:00 GMT

Gidday Fokes.

As a MsDos user who had problems himself with installing Linux I figured
it wouldn't be a bad idea if somebody wrote basically a Installation and
Command Reference Book for new Linux users. I've started work on it
already and was wondering what people would want in a book like this. I
mean we've no doubt all gone out and brought Unix books and found that
some of the commands just don't apply and spent the next day trying to
find something remotely similar.

Okay - so you're going now after working it out but wouldn't you rather
have had a quick reference book of some type. If you're like myself you
probably didn't even know about the FAQS. Okay myself I seem a bit denser
that the average user but I didn't have access to the Internet at the
time. I wouldn't want anybody else going through what I did to get started
with Linux, Would you?

Well I've made a start on a reference book but I've a few questions to
ask that you can answer that would help make if easier for people in the
future to go to Linux from Dos or Os/2. Your help with this would be
greatly appreciated.

1.   What commands do you think would be of most benefit to the new
     user and how involved would you want the commands?

2.   What type of format would you want the book arranged in and a few
     reasons as to why? What sort of chapters would you find useful.
     ie Installing Linux, Linux Commands etc.

3.   Would you want if taylored to suit a specific brand of Linux ie
     Yggdrasil, Sls etc or just in general with references to each
     specific brand of Linux.

4.   How about a Dos Command/Linux Command equivalent section? Would
     you find this useful if you knew the Dos command and could just
     look up the equivalent Linux command.

5.   How about a list of available software for Linux with info like
     where to get it and what it does. Great advertising for you
     software authors out there. If you want your software included in
     this Email me at Davin.George@f370.n771.z3.fidonet.org along with
     a description of the software, version number, any specific
     requirements ie needs SLS 99.13.25 and the filesize and where it
     can be obtained from.

6.   Any specific topics you'ld like covered in detail ie Installing
     and Running UUCP etc.

Okay so this is going to take a while to do so I allowing for it not
being finished for about 18 Months. If you a know a specific topic or
subject backwards and would like a bit of recognition for it Email me.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Date: Sun, 5 Dec 1993 23:13:33 GMT

Some days ago I upgraded to linux-0.99pl14 and ext2fs-0.4a
After some reboots and one e2fsck (maxmimal mount number reached ...)
I noticed, that one directory has been completely lost.
Notice, that I've shut down the system correctly every time, and it never
crashed.
There was only one real checking from e2fsck in startup phase because
of the maximal mount number, but it only reported me about some error
in the bitmap (sorry i can't recall that one exactly, but it was something
about a free entry marked as used).

Where is my directory ?
Fortunately it's been something reconstructable.

If the directory is not there anymore, at least e2fsck should be
able to find it and put it into /lost+found.

Any pointers ?
(Note: After this happened, I reconstructed the whole system from tape,
       which I've backup'ed 2 days before)

It seems that if called from xdm xterm has some tty-settings which are

Subject: tcp header checks?
Date: 6 Dec 1993 08:40:54 GMT


Hi there,

I'd like to report a small problem I've been having with (C)SLIP
using linux 0.99pl11-pl14.  This might be a problem with the way tcp
packet headers are assembled (although I don't have a clue really
since I haven't read the source or know even the faintest details 
behind it).  Anyway here's the problem:

CSLIP is working perfectly when I turn on the error correction capability
of my modem - a 14.4k Zoom.  (error correction being either v.42 or
MNP5).  However, when I start up (C)SLIP without error correction,
after about 10 minutes of plug and chug, the computer freezes and/or
reboots.  Again, this does NOT happen when I turn on error correction.
My best guess is that the problem arose because of some random line
noise creeping into the phone line.  Anyway I reported to my school
sysadmin this problem I was having - he reported that it was probably
they way linux did tcp packets, and that random line noise was 
doing something nasty to the OS.  He also reported that SunOS way back
when had this exact same problem - without error correction, the kernel
went berzerk with bad packets via line noise.

My problem is this - shouldn't random noise be ignored and packets resent
without freezing/rebooting the kernel?  I wish I could pinpoint what the
problem was but I can't since I have no xp with net code in any way.

Now you ask, why use CSLIP with no error correction?  Because response time
is WAY WAY WAY better WITHOUT error correction (reduces my ping times
by 100-120 ms && takes me under the 200 ms mark for 64 byte pings).
You can actually get work done without error correction (in my opinion).
Correction added too much latency times making the text jumpy
and bothersome.

My setup now: Linux pl14 386 33 12 megs ram 16550AFN com2 (modem).
but problem existed from pl11.

Using 1.72M floppy disks (and other formats).

Under Linux 0.95 and 0.96 I patched the appropriate drivers,
and boot boot code. This is not necessary under Linux 0.99p13.

If a 1.72M 3.5" floppy is wanted ,
( 2 sides, 82 tracks/side , 21 sectors/track  = 3444 sectors / 1722 Kb):

        1) format the disk under DOS (with fdformat)
           (It should be possible to format floppy disks
            under Linux with fdformat, but I don't have the
            correct parameters.)

        2)
        # from the shell or in /etc/rc or /etc/profile ... :
          setfdprm -p /dev/fd0 3444 21 2 82 0 0x0C 0x00 0x0CF 0x6F
        #  mounting floppy on /drv_a with msdos file system.
          mount /dev/fd0 /drv_a -t msdos

It is also possible to create and mount a minix filesystem 
(14 or 30 char. filenames).

I have tried creating an Ext2 filesystem on a floppy, but
the overhead is to big on smaal devices, so I wouldn't
recommend this.
