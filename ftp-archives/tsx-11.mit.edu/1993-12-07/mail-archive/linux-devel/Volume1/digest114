I run the mono server of XFree version 1.2 on my Compaq LTE386s/20
notebook.  It installed with no problems.  I tried Xega but its font
support seemed kinda clunky and I can live with mono for now.  I can't
switch to an external monitor as that is done through software and I
haven't gotten around to finding the necessary BIOS call...

But, XFree on an LCD does exist and, for me, was trivial.  Your milage
may vary.

As I said, it contains AT&T code and thus CANNOT be posted to any major
archive sites!

SLIP currently needs the tty interface, thus the current Linux SLIP won't run
directly on ISDN unless the tty interface is reorganized.
Routing IP packets through the PTY interface is horrible. In fact, I'd like
to avoid going through a PTY for straight ISDN logins too if at all possible.
Not everybody can or wants to do TCP/IP over their ISDN link.

So telnet does this too, now?  I'm running 0.99pl9-2 and it drives me
batty with rlogin, but telnet does OK.  This is over ethernet to
SCO unix.  The ^C problem has been mentioned in other posts, I had

Putting my pompous^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hprofessional head on again, let me explain:

Hardware:
        Physically speaking, at the level of electrons and things,
        there is no reason why intelligent serial I/O cards can't be
        installed in a machine running Linux.

Software:
        There is no reason why a driver for an intelligent serial I/O
        card couldn't be written: drivers have been ported to such
        hideously different environments as SCO Unix, Microsoft Windows
        NT, IBM AIX 3, MS-DOS, ... so it is by no means impossible to
        imagine this happening.

Cost:
        Financially, we start getting into an area whereby people get
        a little reluctant to pay $1500 for a 16 port I/O solution when
        most of their kit was free. Example prices of Specialix I/O
        solutions:

    Dumb:
        I/O4    AST four port look-alike                        $   300

    Semi-intelligent:
        I/O8+   Semi-intelligent 8 port card                    $   495

    Intelligent (Z280 CPU + dumb octal UARTs)
        SI/4    Intelligent 4 port solution,
                host card + 4 port module                       $   795
        SI/8    Intelligent 8 port solution,
                host card + 8 port module                       $   995
        SI/16   Intelligent 16 port solution,
                host card + 2 x 8 port modules                  $ 1,495
        SI/32   Intelligent 32 port solution,
                host card + 4 x 8 port modules                  $ 2,495

    Intelligent (Z280 CPU + intelligent quad UARTs)
        XIO 8   Intelligent 8 port solution,
                host card + 8 port module                       $ 1,145
        XIO 16  Intelligent 16 port solution,
                host card + 2 x 8 port module                   $ 1,795
        XIO 32  Intelligent 32 port solution,
                host card + 4 x 8 port module                   $ 3,095

    Intelligent, distributed modules (T225 Transputers, intelligent UARTS)
        RIO 32  Distributed 32 port solution                    $ 3,995

        RIO 128 Distributed 128 port solution                   $13,595
        RIO 512 Distributed 512 port solution                   $54,380

    The other intelligent serial I/O card vendors all have products with
    roughly the equivalent performance/price ratios, some are better, some
    not as good, but most are in the same ballpark figure (suprise)

Legal:
        Legally, there are real problems. The GPL's restrictions are so
        severe that most companies are *unable* to release drivers for
        their products, simply because of the uncertainty of the legal
        position wrt the GPL. [I think I mean GPL - that rather savage
        horned and toothed software license that Linux is covered by].

        If the requirement is that software source is made available,
        then there is *no way* that most of the I/O vendors are willing
        to do that. I have been toying with the idea of writing drivers
        for the I/O8+, SI range and XIO range, however, I am always
        put off by the software license. We aren't about to publish our
        source code.

Support:
        When you call us with a support call, it costs us real money to
        answer the call. Each person who calls us up prevents one member
        of our support team from (i) helping someone else (ii) writing up
        a report of problems already seen, (iii) finding workarounds and
        (iv) going to lunch.

Politics:
        It's very hard to justify writing device drivers for an operating
        system that is either unknown or regarded as being a hackers toy
        by management.

I am perfectly willing to write device drivers for Linux for Specialix I/O
cards. Unfortunately, they would probably never get out of our door. Can
anyone answer the following question for me:

        I would like to distribute just a binary of the driver with a small
        C file to get it included into the kernel. Is this possible within
        the confines of the Linux software license restrictions?

[ IF you think you are going to answer this question, you first of all need
  to convince me you know what you are talking about - I don't want opinions
  from 18 year old freshmen, I want facts from people who are actively 
  involved in the FSF projects].

If you really want to hang many ports off of a Linux box, I offer you the
Specialix MTS (Modular Terminal Server). The Modular Terminal Server is a
high performance, flexible and secure method for businesses to expand TCP/IP
networks. MTS allows terminals, printers, and modems easy access to resources
of a TCP/IP network. The modular design of MTS enables from 8 to 32 users to 
be linked to the network.

Access to the TCP/IP ethernet network is made via either thin or thick
ethernet.

8 Port RS232 MTS        $1695
8 Port Adaptor          $ 650

So, for a 32 port terminal server, $1695 + 3 x $650 = $3645

As you can see, more expensive than direct connect serial I/O, and also
much less efficient (= greater system overhead) because of having to invoke
the mighty TCP/IP stack software for every character typed by the user!

Hi, All,
        I have Tcl 6.7 and Tk 3.2 installed on a Linux box.  Now I'm trying

I got the following error messages:

I have been researching into the problems with Tandberg 3600 tape drives. 
Apparently, they were originally designed to IBM OEM.  They are not SCSI-1
or SCSI-2 devices.  They are SCSI, but they are not true to the SCSI-1 or
the SCSI-2 specification.

Numerous people has been having problems with Tandberg 3600 drives,
because they don't handshake correctly.  I contacted Vidar Mortensen of
Tandberg Data in Norway:
Kjeisasvelen 172
P.O. BOX 133 Kjelsas
N-0411 OSLO, Norway    fax + 47 22 95 13 55 phone 47 22 18 90 90
email:  vimo@tdata.no

He informed me of the following:

 Your Tandberg 3600 firmware (U06 or U07) are IBM OEM versions. Tandberg made 
 this firmware after IBM spesifications.

 You can upgrade your firmware EPROM to either standard SCSI-1 or SCSI-2. The 
 version numbers are:
 
         Standard SCSI-1    -07:06
         Standard SCSI-2    =08:15  (Supports Windows NT)
 
 The price from Norway is NOK 350 (approx. US $ 49) + NOK 150 for freight and 
 handling. You can send your order to me.
 
===========================cut  =====cut =======cut==================

Well, I think a whopping 70 dollars for an EPROM upgrade was way too rich
for my blood.

I asked if I could get it within the US, he said:

Alternatively, you can connect our US Branch, and ask their prices.  The
address is:
Tandberg Data, INC.
2649 Townsgate Rd.
Suite 600
Westlake Village, CA 91361
voice (805) 495-8384

I don't know how much it is from the US Branch for such an upgrade, but I
would most certainly like to know if anyone finds out.

        Shame on you Don, that is no reason for having bad or
confusing code.  A standard, published interface definition should be
a MUST for ALL the code.  Linux includes the code for the hacker, and
hobbiest. The petty, self-centered people who might put out
object-only distributions be damned. It would be nice to stop them,
but I seriously think that easy to write for, crystal clear, well
documented code will do _much_ more to help the Linux/GNU/FreeWare/ShareWare
cause then stopping a few petty people. The people who really care
about Linux and what it stands for won't 'buy' object-only things. 
Look at how the Diamond products are shuned now, even though they
could be supported, because of Diamonds proprietary attitudes. I
think that The learning curve for Linux code is getting
outrageous. People new to Linux have a hard time following the code,
writing and 'playing' with it, and that hurts the cause.

        Your statement sounds almost like the old programmers
job-security adage "keep it confusing so they won't fire me". 
Personally I see this is proprietaryism in another guise. It's end
result is to just shut someone out of a 'market'. I use this code, as
do others, and I can't follow alot of it because there is no standard,
published interface definition for just about anything.  I'd rather
see clean, easy to use code (and have to withstand a few self-centered
fools), then have to wade through the confusion that the code is
becoming. I liked Minix, where I could add a driver stub in an hour or
two because the code was easy to read, and laid out well. I didn't
have to be a Minix source-code guru to do it, with Linux you do :(

It is very handy when reinstalling/backing up a system. Unix wizards
who don't like this directory can still directly edit the files in
/etc and other directories without using /conf.

The Linux/PRO distribution I'm using has got directories in /conf for
X11,net,mail,news,uucp.
