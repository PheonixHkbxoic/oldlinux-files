Subject: Linux 0.99pl9 (SLS 1.01) and 3Com EtherLink 16?  Any hope?
Date: Sat, 25 Sep 1993 00:16:59 GMT


Hello, Linuxers!!

I just purchased a new Ethernet card for my 386DX/40 clone.  It is a
3Com EtherLink 16, a 16-bit ISA Ethernet card with both an AUI port
and a BNC connector.

I'm running Linux 0.99pl9, as distributed with SLS 1.01, and would like
to get Linux running using this card, so that I can start building my
dream of a home Ethernet network.  I would like to use the BNC connector,
since I've got other devices that use ThinNet cabling.  However, I do have
a transceiver that plugs into the AUI port, so I can use that if needed.

A few questions:

(1) Is there a driver for this card, for Linux 0.99pl9?  If so,
    (A) Where can I get it? (FTP site)
    (B) How do I install it? (if it's not obviously documented in README)

(2) If there isn't a driver for 0.99pl9, is there a driver for 0.99pl10 or
    any of the other newer versions of Linux?
    (A) If so, where can I get it?
    (B) How do I install it? (if it's not obviously documented in README)

(3) If there isn't ANY driver for this card...
    (A) Is this card sufficiently compatible/similar with another type of
        network card, that I can use the driver for that other card?
    (B) Where can I get it, and how do I install it?
    (C) If no drivers that exist will work, is there any hope of MAKING a
        driver for this card? (i.e. are the spec's available, or is it a
        case like with Diamond video boards, where they won't release the
        info necessary to program it)

Please respond to me here at dburr@sbanet.netmail.com.  THANK YOU!!

When people say "IP networking", they are talking about the whole suite of
protocols including UDP, TCP, ARP, ICMP, telnet, ftp, and often NFS, rexec,

Doesn't work. The object file structure as used by Linux and virtually every
other Unix system in existence is such that there's no clear boundary between
procedures. Thus the linker cannot reorder them. It would be able to reorder
object files but I don't think that buys you enough.

It might be possible to convince gcc/ld to use a better file format, though.

Most mail-delivery agents will do it for you, you simply have to tell

Subject: fixed in.ftpd
Date: 25 Sep 93 06:00:18 GMT

I've uploaded a fixed copy of in.ftpd to tsx-11.  Since their incoming
is not visible, I've also put it in

      athos.rutgers.edu:/pub/linux/ftpd.tar.z.

The only difference between this and the net-2 version is that this
fixes a bug causing "data connection: illegal seek" when sending data
over a slow link.  Source and executable.  (The makefile and order of
a couple of includes had to be changed because of differences in
include files and libraries between when net-2 was issued and now.
While it's built with shadow password defined, I have no idea whether
shadow passwords actually work or not.)

Somebody mentioned having fixed this already.  But since they didn't
feel moved to give us the fix, and I was getting fed up with not being
able to get files from my Linux server, I decided to fix it myself.
(By the way, one could argue that the bug is actually in the kernel.
However I'd rather have ftp working for the moment, and the change
should be harmless even if the kernel is fixed.  The problem is that
write on a network connection may not send all the bytes the user
asked for.  I'm inclined to think that unless non-blocking I/O is set,
the kernel ought to block until it has sent everything.  ftpd was
coded to treat a short count as an error.  Interestingly, ftp is coded
to handle short counts.)

I'm speaking only for myself here, of course,
but I believe 3Com advises against installing a 3C501 in a new system,
mostly for the same reasons Donald has discussed.
You probably won't be happy with the 3C501 in your Linux box.
The data sheet is marked "(obsolete)" on 3Com's Developers' Order Form,
and the board is not part of 3Com's program for sending free Technical
Reference Manuals to people who need them.
The decade-old things are nearly indestructible, but that's about all they've
got going for them any more.

I hope you find our *modern* boards equally sturdy, and I want to hear
about it if you don't.  The Network Adapter Division design team sincerely
appreciates the *excellent* feedback we've got from the Linux community.

A waste of time and i-nodes. Today certainly many people have
got books and read articles about Unix, so everyone has a good idea,
where the system files are and what has to be inside ...

What about the people who install Linux for educational reasons ?
In work they have to deal with real Unix Systems and the 
files in /config don't help much in other Unix environments.
So don't confuse people with unnecessary additionally files and
formats .... It's better you learn one stanmdard. It helps you more
in later work ...

I think the few system files one have to know (/etc/passwd /etc/shadow 
/etc/group) are not more difficult than MS-DOS config.sys trickeries
if you have to handle lots of cards and drivers.

- in my eyes - better proposals:

        1) keep it simple ... keep things as they are.
           It worked over twenty years.

        2) Do more useful stuff....
           There are many online manual pages missing in Linux.
           Or there are manual pages, that looks for me as not fitting
           the program releases in Linux....
           That's the real stuff new users need ! 
           Up to date man pages ... Not new config files !

        3) Write a working sysadm shell, that allows people to easily
           add or delete users ... or other wanted things.

But please don't fill the filesystem with uneccessary things.

In another thread some weeks ago we discussed filesystem standards
for Linux. Soon we get SVR4 binary compatibility. Let's work on
those things to make Linux look more like the new SVR4 standard.
Really more important in my eyes.

Things like that are in my eyes as meaningless and disturbing
as the again and again starting discussions in german newsgroups
about German Umlaute and those who think it's more comfortable to 
read Gl"uckwunsch than Glueckwunsch.

But although syslogk is started in /etc/rc.local it shows the initial
startup messages beginning with console and serial stuff ...

        Console: colour EGA+ 80x25, 8 virtual consoles
        Serial driver version 3.96 with no serial options enabled
        tty00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16450

Isn't that good enough ? Seems to be, that the kernel is buffering
or holding these messages as if waiting for a tool like syslogk ;-)

BTW: how does it realy work ? syslogk logs messages that are 
already displayed when the utility itself wasn't started ...

It does, indeed.  As you guessed, the kernel is buffering the messages
so that they can be logged to a file.

> Isn't that good enough ? 

No, because they're still printed to the console.  The point, the only
and single and simple and easy to understand (or so I thought; I
obviously need to work on my writing skills) point, is that I would
prefer if there were fewer noise messages printed during bootup,
preferably so that only messages that require my attention are
printed.

I know it does.  But I, personally, would prefer not to see some of the
informational verbosity at *boot* time.  Afterward is a bit too late; it's
already scribbled noise all over the screen :-)  This is not merely a
frivolous request:  the later informative messages can cause previous
possibly important information to scroll off the screen.  I had this problem
back when I was trying to diagnose a problem which turned out to be a mis-
addressed SCSI drive --- I had to boot in 50-line mode and it was only just
*barely* enough to retain the SCSI probe information.  If I'd needed to see
anything from before that point I'd have been in trouble.

(Yes, I can get it after the boot... if the message at the start of the boot
isn't what causes a panic late in, or after, the boot.  Makes it hard to
diagnose some problems....)

>BTW: how does it realy work ? syslogk logs messages that are 
>already displayed when the utility itself wasn't started ...

Console messages get written into a 4K ring buffer as well as to the screen.
The first reads of the log after an open return the entire contents of the 
buffer; subsequent reads only return new messages.  See the definitions of
sys_syslog() and printk().  (The code for /proc/kmsg just invokes sys_syslog()
to do the work, at least in 0.99pl9.)

This, BTW, is what makes keeping message levels difficult:  there would have
to be "magic cookies" in the log to indicate the start of a new message and
its log level.  And, as has already been noted, there's no way at present to
indicate the start of a new message, so potentially *all* uses of printk()
would have to be examined and changed to implement message boundaries and
levels.

Hmm, and then there's the 8/16 bit problem... which some 8-bit cards avoid by
not using A0. 

Time to redo the Linux tty handling so that such a card, with driver,
fits into the kernel in the first place...
