The way I did it was to use dd to capture the first 100 sectors or so of
the partition that contains the Windows swapfile (Make sure the only thing
on the partition is the swapfile) to a file. The on Linux shutdown I
restore this information to the partition. Windows just needs the signature
at the beginning of the swapfile to be happy.

From the Linux side I have to mkswap on boot up, then restore at shutdown.

If this isn't in a FAQ it needs to be. I see this every couple of weeks.
Remember always read the FAQ if you have a question. Since many people are
probably using both DOS/Windows and Linux it is a save bet that questions
of this nature have already been asked.

Xsysadmin - this is what I want to write, only I think there already is
a lot of code outside? 

Please contact me if you are working on something similar, have done something
alike or have something stuffed away which did not work to well...

I would like to make a LinuxConfigurationtool for
        - usermaintainement (incl. shadow-support)
        - uucp
        - smail
        - cnews / tin
        - internet
        - cron
        - printers

I do not know whether it is a good idea to put this all into one program,
especially since many people should contribute to this program - I cannot
do it all alone. 

I will throw myself at the user-maintainement-stuff first.

The tool I would like to use for this task is the ObjectInterface/ObjectBuilder
of ParcPlace (tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/packages/OI) since it has good
documentation in paperform :-) and seems to be good c++.

Otherwise I would say: xview3?

Any Ideas - sources - to contribute?

Someone wanting to contribute a real nifty icon ?

Pray tell me why the following doesn't work:

#include <stdio.h>

int
main()
{
        printf("#groups: %d\n",getgroups(0,NULL));

To the best of my understanding (see unistd.h) this should print out the #
of concurrent groups for the current user, but it always prints out just 0.

I have been useing this drive for QIC-02 + linux now for 6 months
no problem... But i am curious about the jumpers on the drive
i have never moved them..
but:  what does  RP0 and RP1 do ?? these jumpers are the only
ones on the drive and are located near the 4 pin power socket.
marked RP0 and RP1 and have 2 positions  0 and 1
So anyone know what these jumpers are for.??
Also i have another drive
same as above but it has the QIC SC400 type of card mounted below it.
some one told me this card has scsi connections to it.. I did not
belive it.  i think this card has to have the SC402 Host adapter
card to make the connect between the PC hostadapter and the card mounted
in a box under the drive.. together makeing the drive a 5.25 inch full
height. box.
Any info on any the above Please
Barry..  btitmars@esoc.bitnet

I agree with you 100% on your observations and comments.
I would also add that Linux folks will say you are free to build your
own Linux package that is a system like you want.  Why hasn't someone done it?
It has no benefit for the people who would develop it. 
It would only benefit naive end-users, who are seen by many Linux people as 
a lower form of life.  Such end-user software is developing by paid programmers
who would rather spend their time doing something else.

Linux was developed by hackers for use by hackers. 
If others find it useful, then they are lucky.

The problem with OI is speed (or the lack thereof) even with 8MB.

xview sources could take a day to compile on a 386-33/4MB.

Here are some ideas for you:

(1) Use separate programs (or data files) for generating the user screens
    to allow add-on packages to add new screens, and simplify debugging.

(2) Realize the screens using an interpreter, to make it easy to add
    new data files (or fix buggy ones), but be careful to implement
    the interpreter efficiently to minimize user-visible delays.

(3) Provide both an X and text implementation of the interpreter.
    (The interpreter would be useful even if X is not available.)

(4) Design a language for the interpreter that:
(4a)  Can be interpreted efficiently
(4b)  Uses a declarative form to describe screens
(4c)  Lets screen fields have "input rules" and "actions"
(4d)  Allows an action to affect other fields by name
(4e)  Simplifies use of existing tools as part of an "action"
        (i.e. can run a shell command and save its exit status)

These ideas may sound similar to USL's "System Administration Package"
(sysadm) because sysadm uses data files interpreted by the "Form and
Menu Language Interpreter" (FMLI).  Note, however, that FMLI fails
in areas 4a, 4d, 4e, and is generally just a slow implementation.
The FMLI language design makes it difficult to express: the intended
evaluation time of each component, the appropriate substitution and
quoting of temporary strings, and changes to other screen components.

The design of the screen description language is central to the
success of any interpreted user interface like this.  There will be
many forms and menus to write, so the language needs to be expressive
enough to make the job easy for the authors of all those screens.

My experience has been that a declarative form is good for describing
the overall contents of a form or menu, and a procedural form is good
for describing the actions associated with the various events that can
happen to a field (selection, modification, enter, exit).

There are two languages I can think of that one might use as a
basis for designing the screen description language (SDL):  

Lisp:   Has several advantages, but is unfamiliar to most people.
        It is easily interpreted, and can easily be used for
        either declarative or procedural forms of expression.

Tcl/Tk: I am not very familiar with Tcl or Tk though I gather they
        are interpreted procedural languages.  I have doubts about
        how effectively these could be used for declarative form.

Perl:   Same problems as Tcl, I guess.

Does anyone else have experience with interpreted languages for
screen/form/menu description?  What has worked well for you?

I remember seeing a package called lwp for Linux. Look at sunsite.unc.edu
around the /pub/Linux/devel or libs directories. I think this is mostly
user-level, so threads are not done in the kernel that I know of.

Really?  Seems to me that if the GNU folks had really adopted the

Hi all,

I am in need of a multiport serial card (at least 4 ports that share an
IRQ).  I can't seem to get any of the boards listed in the Linux Hardware
list locally.  I can, however, get a few Boca models at reasonable prices,
and am wondering if any of them will work with Linux:  

BB-1004         4 ports
BB-1008         8 ports
IO2BY4          4 serial, 2 parallel
?????           6 serial (same price as 2BY4, so probably a similar card)

The one I am most interested in is the 6 port card (it is less than the
BB-1004).  

These boards are all special order (they don't sell enough of them to keep
them in stock), so it is important that I know that it works with Linux
before I order.  

Thanks!
