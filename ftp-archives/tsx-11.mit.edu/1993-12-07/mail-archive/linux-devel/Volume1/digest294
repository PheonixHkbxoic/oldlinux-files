It didn't. The acutal idea is from a comp.unix.shell FAQ or
some such posting which I read over a year ago and I just
reproduced the main point the FAQ made in the posting.

Hello Linux developers!

I would like to know wheter there is anybody trying to build a Linux to
Novell Netware (say spx ipx Protocol) linkage?
Such is offered by Novell's Unix-Ware and enables Unix-Ware users to use
Novell Partitions without the need of special filesystems (like nfs) on
this partitions.
It would be helpful to me to get answers (also) per email to

Well, this isn't exactly true.  Have you ever tried to run Windows
software without buying Microsoft Windows?  Sure, if someone
uses Windoze all the time then there's no problem, but what about
the people who just need it for that ONE application.  In that
case it would be cheaper (if it were an option at all) to just pay a
little runtime royalty for that program.

At any rate, I won't be buying Motif or (if I can help it) using
applications that require a runtime licence.  Just like with
any commercial enterprise, OSF has the right to determine
their licencing schemes, and the users have the right to not buy it.

Hi all,

        I have an experience to use Linux SLS 0.99 release 1.03 to
install with a 3COM Ethernet driver, but I fail and can not can
the eth0 interface driver.

        I have no problem with the older release.  Can anyone
has experience to install such a driver with release 1.02 and tell
me how to solve this problem.

        BTW, I am using VL bus with Cirrus Logic display adaptor.
Which older release support this adaptor and ethernet adaptor.

Thanks a lot

Exactly the sort of (common) mistake non-nested attributions like what
you see above are supposed to reduce.  Some folks dislike them - like
every other religious issue, people have TOHO (their own humble
opinions) - and that's cool, but its usually pretty easy to figure out
exactly what text is being attributed to what person.

Oh, and for one implementation of non-nested citations in an Emacs
environment, see Supercite (1/2 :-).

Neal> Recipients of free software have no right to expect anything, [
Neal> ... ]

I agree completely with you; I am a free sw author myself. But there is
a huge difference between "expecting" and "suggesting": and all the
trouble about the !@#$ OSF license is about making it very obvious to
free sw authors that if they choose Motif some/many people will not be
able to enjoy their work because of highly unusual and perhaps startling
licensing restrictions on runtime binaries.

Free sw authors remain free to use OSF/Motif, and for that matter to
write free sw that cannot be ported to anything else but Windows 3.1, an
even more highly proprietary environment; but some do care about wider
enjoyability of their work, and some/most perhaps had not realized that
in some/many/most cases OSF/Motif now requires runtime binary royalties,
unlike 99% of other libraries on the market.

After all the noise and shouting, I hope that free sw authors know about
the consequences of making their work dependent on OSF/Motif. They
remain free to choose either way, and will still get loud cheers if they
make their works dependent OSF/Motif, but even louder cheers if they
don't.

Apart from making everybody aware of the extremely unusual licensing of
OSF/Motif, two positive effects have been achieved: there is now a
project to make a library compatible with the OSF/Motif API, and some
good folks at NCSA or otherwise have, in some case out of spite :-> (see
the article that started this thread), proved that a well written
program need not be _that_ dependant on any specific toolkit API.

Incidentally, I did not mention this before, I am sorry: another free sw
author has done a generic, simplified toolkit API library called wxWin;
it offers the usual facilities provided for by most toolkits, and can be
compiled to support OSF/Motif, XView/OpenLook or Windows 3.1; I don't
have any personal experience of using it, but the demos look impressive
and I have been told it is rather solid, and more bells&whistles are
being added.

It would seem to me a rather reasonable alternative to the leading
contender in the contest for toolkit of choice for free sw, Tcl/Tk.

Here is the leaflet describing it:

========================================================================

*****                  Announcing wxWindows 1.50                  *****
***** A Free C++ GUI toolkit for Motif, Open Look and Windows 3.1 *****

>>> wxWindows is a toolkit for developing Windows 3 and
    X applications from the same body of C++ code.

Since the source is provided, wxWindows allows the programmer to add
features as needed. For many programmers, however, wxWindows should be
adequate for a range of applications.

>>> Uses include:

* development of applications for delivery on both X and Windows

* development on one platform for delivery on another

* single-platform development, as a high-level wrapper around XView,
  Motif or Windows

>>> Included in this fourth release:

* Simple-to-use, object-oriented API

* Graphics calls include splines, polylines, rounded rectangles, etc.

* XView-style programmatic panel/dialog item layout

* Support for menu bars and status lines

* Toolbar class

* Pens, brushes, fonts, icons, cursors, bitmaps

* Easy, object-oriented interprocess comms (DDE subset) under
  Windows 3 *and* UNIX

* Encapsulated PostScript generation under UNIX, Windows 3 printing on PC

* Virtually automatic MDI support under Windows

* Support for Windows 3 printer and file selector common dialogs, with
  equivalents for UNIX

* Under Windows 3, support for copying metafiles to the clipboard

* Programmatic form facility for building form-like screens fast,
  with constraints on values

* wxHelp hypertext help system, accessible from applications

* Optional interface to NASA's CLIPS, so an interpreted GUI-building facility can
  be included in wxWindows programs, or used stand-alone.

* All source

* Several examples

* Comprehensive reference manual, with reference in wxHelp form

>>> Requirements:

* On PC, Microsoft C/C++ or Borland C++ 3.1 (sorry, no Borland makefiles yet)
* On UNIX, XView 3.1 or Motif 1.1 and GCC/G++ (or compatible compiler, such as
  AT&T C++)
* Under DOS, maximum 8 MB of disk space, including object files

>>> Where to get it

wxWindows is currently available from the Artificial Intelligence
Applications Institute by anonymous FTP.

FTP to skye.aiai.ed.ac.uk (192.41.104.6), log on as `anonymous', and
give your user ID as password. Change directory into pub/wxwin, change
transmission method to binary, and get wxwin150.tar.Z (UNIX) and/or
wxwin150.zip (PC).  Both archives contain the source code for both
platforms, but only the executable demos for the specific platform
(UNIX and Windows respectively). The demos are available separately as
demo.tar.Z (or wxwindem.tar.Z) and demo.zip (or wxwindem.zip).

wxWindows is expected to be uploaded to the CICA Windows 3 archive at
Indiana University (ftp.cica.indiana.edu), and the British HENSA public
domain software archive (pdsoft.lancs.ac.uk).

>>> Installation

See install.txt.

>>> Bugs, etc.

wxWindows, like most other software, has the occasional buglet. I
would be grateful for bug reports (even better, fixes) though I can't
guarantee to do anything about them. Future releases of wxWindows are
likely to be more stable and more complete.  Meanwhile, do send me your
enhancements, and I will try to incorporate them in future releases.
Here are some ideas for contributions:

* more Xlib wrappers
* an enhanced, editable text subwindow for Windows
* an Xt-like constraint algorithm for laying out widgets
* a Mac version

>>> wxWindows discussion forum

There is a mailing list for users or potential users of wxWindows.
Send a request to wxwin-users-request@aiai.ed.ac.uk to subscribe
the mailing list.

>>> In the pipeline

* Better clipboard support
* A Windows NT version
* Automated GUI testing facilities
* DevGuide to wxWindows utility (user contribution)
* Text-only CURSES version (user contribution)

Marc> Are you completely clueless?  From Darrell Crow's recent posting:

I think _you_ are being clueless: one must pay a royalty on _all_ cases
where the runtime is distributed in DLL form (unless the target platform
is already licensed) alongside with the application, which incidentally
the most convenient/common method, and in all cases but the two you
mention when the runtime is distributed to third parties statically
linked with the application.

With OSF/Motif the _rule_ is that somebody pays a royalty for runtime
binaries; there are _exceptions_ to the rule. This is what I read in
David Brooks as quoted by R. Stewart Ellis:

>>> On 19 Nov 93 17:52:42 GMT, ellis@nova.gmi.edu (R. Stewart Ellis)
>>> said:

Brooks> licensed to run Motif.

This I (now) read as: "in general" someone must pay a royalty (not
necessarily the developer); there are exceptions, and all these
exceptions involve programs linked with static libraries only. Darrel
Crow summary of the OSF/Motif library says the same thing -- and I am
not surprised, the goal of OSF seems to get a royalty on every seat for
which OSF/Motif is installed; this is standard industry practice, but
for applications/SDKs, not for runtime libraries.

The tightening of the rules I wanted to warn people about is that in
1.1.x _all_ cases of distribution including static libraries _only_ were
exceptions; now "some/many/most/who knows how many" cases of
distribution involving static libraries require royalties too, so the
exception list is significantly smaller (fortunately it is now certain
that NCSA Mosaic binaries for most/all platforms falls within the scope
of an exception).

For 99% of other commercial libraries out there the rule is one need not
worry about exceptions to rules, as no royalty for runtimes is due
_ever_; you buy an SDK, and that's it.
