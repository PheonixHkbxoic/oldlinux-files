Come on now.  The idea behind term is that everyone can use it.  
That is why it allows usable x-window connections at 2400 BPS,
can use 7-bit lines, and doesn't require you to be root on the
machines you use it on.  You could argue:

Get a slip connection  with a decent modem...  But then that defeats
the idea of doing the most you can with the money/resources you already
have.  I think it is a good idea, and if I actually worried about 
recieving phone calls, I would right such a beast before resorting
to paying the phone company:  $100 for installation of a new line
and $20 a month for the luxery of the extra phone line.  Maybe 
your budget can handle that, but mine can't.

  This message makes no body to happy. Your message has no effective answer.
Many hacker don't like COBOL, but COBOL is used many appications.

  I know V-LSI CAD system written in COBOL.
  I know compiler written in COBOL.
  I know basic OS utility written in COBOL.
  I know expert system kernel written in COBOL.

  RMS wants Gnu COBOL compiler. But no one do it, then Gnu has no COBOLs.

  I'm tring it, but it is very hard.

Indeed, Micro Focus COBOL runs under AIX, HP/UX, SCO on all manner of
hardware, not to mention those other operating systems.  While their
compiler is written in COBOL (shock!), it is one of the more efficient
COBOL compilers available (double shock!!).

So maybe a COBOL compiler could be the real killer application to
put Linux on the map.  There are a mind-boggling number of batch-
oriented mainframe applications about to be rightsized.

I'd be very interested in seeing them make their product available
for Linux.  I would also be interested in hearing if a free compiler
project is or might be happening.

Another good point -- if they can physically boot a floppy then they
can also boot a rootdisk and have full access to your Linux partitions
anyway.   

So having this driver doesn't give them anything they don't already
have. 

Although one could say that a nice feature for a "read linux files under
dos" utility would be the requirement of a linux password! :-) (yes,
I know, for that to work it has to be able to read the filesystem in the
first place, blahblah) but again, having physical access to the machine
gives much easier ways to get to your system than getting around the
above scheme. Requiring a password would at least stop the merely inquisitive
(say, your 8-year old son).

Subject: 16550A handling in serial.c
Date: Thu, 4 Nov 1993 18:05:44 GMT

I'm afraid I'm not much of an expert in these things, but I bought a 16550A
serial card in the hope that it would improve term connections via an X25
gateway to my SunOS host.  The old 8250 chip copes fine at 19200 baud on this
serial connection, but drops characters at any higher speed, but ONLY on
outgoing data (the CPU is a 486/33 and presumably copes with the interrupts).

However, my 16550A is no better!  :-(  I am still limited to 19200 baud.  I
fiddled with the X25 PAD and SunOS stty parameters until I was blue in the face
to get a clean line, but I'm fairly sure I have a clean line anyway.  No joy.

I posted to comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware about it, and someone said "The 16550
isn't activated"

So I thought I'd look at the kernel sources.  I noticed that startup() in
serial.c activates the FIFO with an 8 byte trigger, but only if it's a
16550A (why not a 16550?).  Now my rc.serial does indeed correctly set
/dev/cua2 to a 16550A.  /dev/cua0 and /dev/cua1 are still on the old 8250.

So presumably the FIFO *is* activated?  Or is the chip itself not working for
some reason?  Is there some other reason why I am getting this one-way
corruption?

Thanks for any help.

Tim.

Subject: RPCGEN for Linux?

Hey folks,

I posted this to ...linux.help before. Let's see if I can get a response here.

Does anyone know where to get 'rpcgen' for Linux. Or do I have to go out and
build it from scratch. I'm still working with .99pl6, so I'm not sure if it
comes with newer distributions. Someone had to use it before because I've 
noticed that some of the files in the sources are stubs files generated with
rpcgen.

Thanks in advance,


Dave

Hi, I can say absolutely the same as Matthew concerning the problem,
but a week ago the situtation was for me as bad as the initiator of
this thread wrote. On my system (486 8MB 33MHz, vanilla pl13), it was
quite impossible to do a kernel compilation after some 10 minutes of
uptime. Always gcc complained about a sig 11 error.

BUT things changed, without spending any money on it. What I
did, really desperate, was that I just opened the big grey box where
the computer sits in (as they say ;-), took off the 8 SIMMS , and
noticed that although all of them have 3 chips, all of them have
70ns access time, but 4 of them are made by SAMSUNG, and 4 by
some noname-brand. After setting in the SIMMS again, but switching
the two banks, i.e, putting those from bank 1 now into bank 0, and
vice versa, the problem with the SIG 11 errors totally disappeared.
Now I have reached a continous uptime of ~3 days, and gcc doesn't
mutter any more. Right now I compiled the kernel again, just
for experimental reasons.

CONCLUSION: there had been real memory errors (bad contact in 
the SIMM sockets?), and now after my "surgery" the RAM is
in good contact with the rest of the board. Hope that holds.
Ah. BTW, the no-name SIMMS seem to have a thinner board, 
and only silver contacts, not golden ones, as the SAMSUNGs have.
Maybe that affects the quality of the contact in the socket.

Really hope that its ok now for ever,
        because LINUX is the best OS I ever had at home...

Probably not.  There are already some killer COBOL compilers
for the PC, one of which was written by an NYU faculty member.
It is not something you can just knock off.  Unless you have a

I posted this to comp.os.linux.help and didn't receive any replies. Since then
I have performed some more tests and the results of those tests make me more
concerned, so I am placing this in front of the developers in the hopes that
if I have discovered a bug, it can be nipped.  Obviously a bug this serious,
if it does exist and is not specific to my hardware configuration, should have
been uncovered before, but ...

I discovered the problem on my system while copying the emacs-19.19 files from
/usr/spool/uucppublic on my primary disk to another file system on my secondary
disk.  After I copied the files I found they were corrupted. This happens
about 95% of the time I perform the operation.

This is what I have done to isolate the problem.  Rather than copy the entire
set of files (the emacs-19.19-A package), I first tried copying separate files.
What appears to happen is that most of the time the individual files copy
fine producing uncorrupted data, validated with cmp. Successive copying of files
appear to corrupt the earlier copied files.  Unmounting and running
         e2fsck -frv /dev/hdb1
on the filesystem, normally produces a clean check.  Once in awhile the copying
of the files will produce a "block already free" error and then e2fsck will
detect and correct the file system problem. After the repair the files are
still corrupt.

I was willing to hazard a guess that the results I am seeing in copying the
files one at a time has something to do with the file system cache, i.e. the
first cmp I do hits the cache, the cache is flushed during second copy, the
second cmp actually reads from the disk, but .... I ran tests where I copied
the emacs-19.19-A.bin.tar.gz file, validated with cmp, unmounted the file
system, remounted, validated again with cmp, copied the el.1of2 file and then
validated the bin file again (third time), and it was bad only on the third
comparison.

The corruption when viewed with cmp -l on the source and destination files
shows a curious pattern.  I have yet to see the least significant three bits
differ, glorious octal output from cmp you know.  I do see most of the
differences in the most significant octal digit, sometimes in the middle.  The
bits in error also seem to always be cleared bits on the destination.

After first noticing the problem and some initial testing, I low level formatted
the drive.  The only difference this produced was that some sectors that mke2fs
was already finding were marked bad during the format and mke2sf -c didn't find
any bad sectors after the low level format.  (The computer had been in service
for 4 years running SCO Xenix, without problems, until the upgrade to linux
anyways, :-) ).  The errors ocurr in different places on each copy. 

I would suspect bad sectors on the disk if it weren't for all of the movement
the data has gone through and the history I have with the disk.  I would be
interested in hearing from anyone who has any good ideas on this as far as
better bad block testing (better than mke2fs -c) and a reasonable method to
determine the disk or file system blocks occupied by the corrupt file. If I
could easily determine the disk blocks that contained the errors I could
mark those as bad either until everything worked cleanly or until it became
an absurd procedure, i.e. marking 1000 blocks bad on this disk would seem
rather absurd to me given the history of the disk.

Thanks for any help you may offer,
Todd
