Bill, I've been using gdb 4.9 since 0.99.8 and it still works fine
with 0.99.12 on my system. Perhaps, the best solution is to get gdb
4.9. The sources (all 5 megs worth) are on prep.ai.mit.edu in
/pub/gnu. It compiles cleaning on a Linux system.

It must be something the xcalentool "porter" did as a special.

Subject: Need help compiling uSystems C libraries
Date: Thu, 30 Sep 1993 03:13:26 GMT


I am a second year computer science student at University of Waterloo
The course is on Concurrent programming and we are using uSystems
libraries for C.  To take off the load from main machines we would
like to take some work home.  The question is , has anyone , or
is it possible , or where can i get help in compiling uSystems.
Supposedly all I need is the Linix to pass a sigcontext to the 
signal handler so the time slicing would work.
                                        DAREK
        dpdabrowski@undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca
        North 1, Rm 301, Village One, University of Waterloo
        (519)725-6875, (416)247-0784 

Here is some information from Peter Buhr creator of uSystems.
================================== CUT HERE ================================
>From plg.uwaterloo.ca!pabuhr Tue Sep 21 17:52:01 1993

The last time I talked to Linus, I told him what I needed to get the uSystem to
compile on Linux, which was passing a sigcontext to the signal handler so the
time slicing would work. If he has added that to Linix, the uSystem should port
easily. I don't have access to a Linix system so I can't check.

The uSystem is available free of charge to students using it for their own
personal use, which includes doing assignments.
=========================================================================
I would like to announce, to any interested parties, the availability of
Version 4.4.3 of the uSystem (pronounced micro-system), a library of C
routines that provide light-weight concurrency on uniprocessor and
multiprocessor computers running the UNIX operating system.

Version 4.4.3 has bug fixes from version 4.4.2, which was made available on
Nov 13, 1991.


Fixes:

1. Fixed more bugs in the non-blocking I/O routines. Will it never end
folks?

2. Fixed problem with UNIX suspending and resuming of a multiprocessor
application.  *All* the UNIX processes resume after the application is
restarted.


Additions:

1. Added user context data support.

2. Port to IBM rs6000 and HP (M68k and PA).


Changes:

1. The uSystem is not distributed with dmake. You must acquire dmake
separately. (see instructions below)


The uSystem requires at least version 3.8 of dmake, which is available by
anonymous ftp from the following location (remember to set your ftp mode to
binary):

        plg.uwaterloo.ca:pub/dmake/dmake38.tar.Z

Execute the following command to unpack the source:

        % zcat dmake38.tar.Z | tar -xf -

To build dmake, edit the variables in file ./unix/startup.h.  The variable
MAKESTARTUP must specify the location of the startup.mk file, which
contains all the implicit recipes.  This file is placed at the top level of
the source directory after dmake is built.  If dmake is not being installed
in a public location, set the value of MAKESTARTUP to
{dmake-source-path}/startup.mk.  After setting the MAKESTARTUP variable,
execute the command "make" in directory dmake to determine what
configurations are available.  A list of possible configurations will be
printed.  Once dmake is built, add the executable to your command path.


Version 4.4.3 of the uSystem can be obtained by anonymous ftp from the
following location (remember to set your ftp mode to binary):

        plg.uwaterloo.ca:pub/uSystem/uSystem.tar.Z

The distribution file is in compressed tar format. Execute the following
command to unpack the source:

        % zcat uSystem.tar.Z | tar -xf -

The README file contains all the installation instructions. Good luck and
happy concurrency.

A postscript version of the uSystem manual is available in the same ftp
directory as the uSystem, called uSystem.ps.  It contains a copy of the
uSystem documentation that has been formatted for 8.5x11 paper using LaTeX
and then converted to postscript.  This has been made available because
some people have had problems LaTeXing the documentation that comes with
the uSystem distribution. Normally, it is unnecessary to retrieve this
file as the uSystem comes with the reference manual.


The uSystem runs on the following processors: i386, MIPS, M68K, NS32K, VAX,
SPARC, RS6000, HP-PA. The uniprocessor uSystem runs on the following
vendor's computers: Apollo, DEC, MIPS, SEQUENT, SGI, SUN, ENCORE, IBM, HP.
The multiprocessor uSystem runs on the following vendor's computers:
Sequent Symmetry and Balance, Encore Multimax and SGI.


The uSystem requires at least GNU C 2.3.3. The uSystem will NOT compile
using other compilers. (Don't even think about it!)

There is a Software-Practice and Experience paper about version 4.1 of the
uSystem in the Sept 1990 issue.


This version of the uSystem may be the last release. Except for small
additions and bug fixes, development work on the uSystem is largely frozen.
Currently, all our efforts are directed towards uC++, a concurrent dialect
of C++. uC++ supports all the features of the uSystem but all communication
is statically type-safe.

Possibly.  I had anguished over this a couply of months ago, and finally
came to the conclusion that it was not worth it.  The reason being that
although you could switch one of the adapters from IRQ15 to IRQ14
(preferably the MFM, IDE's I think expect to be allways be on IRQ15).
You can do this by either switching a jumper on your controller (consult
your manual/dealer/techie) or by physically cutting the card-edge
connector that would have gone to IRQ15 and move it to another vacant
IRQ.
 
 Even if this works out great, there is no guarantee that it will work
 under even DOS.  For Linux you will probably have to specify somewhere
 in the kernal itself the two IRQ's and their corresponding address and then
 recompile the kernal--->tough (I think).  IF you are running OS/2 though
 I think there maybe a driver so you may be in luck.  

 Well if you get any of these to work PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAASE!! let
 me know.

 Good luck.

The SLS 1.03 Boot Disk does not recognize the harddisk.

Under DOS, CheckIt "recognizes" a hd type ESDI/SCSI/UNKNOWN...

Is there a chance that there will be a driver for that mystery type
harddisk in the (near) future?

Maybe you are trying to use BSD or SYSV signals. Linux uses POSIX
signals. They are slightly different from both since no one could
agree that BSD or SYSV signals were good enough for the standard.

See?  MS-Windoze actually contributed concepts to X-Windows!

What I find amusing is that MS-Windoze has only proven itself as a game

Wouldn't it be simpler to do as Stephen Tweedie (or was it Remy
Card?) proposed, and go to 16-bit major and minor numbers?  Old
8+8-bit device numbers could still be read from inodes without much
trouble by the file systems:  Anything with the upper 16 bits
cleared to 0 is an 8+8-bit inode and converted to a 16+16-bit device
number by the file system immediately after reading it.  The main
drawback is that filesystems that have written to by new kernels
couldn't be read by old kernels (unless the file systems translated
16+16 to 8+8 when writing an inode, but that wouldn't always be
possible).

I should hope so too.

Intelligent I/O started (before) when people were running Xenix on '286
machines. In those days 8 UARTs was a real load. Nowadays...

...Well, anyway, the leaders in the Serial I/O game aren't really playing
at the 8 port end of the market anymore. The upper end is somewhere in the
512-1024 ports range at the moment (we offer 512; I think one of those other
companies now offers 1024 ports, and of course we're all planning for the
future...)

Of course, Linux will never be able to support that number of ports until
the tty subsystem gets a thorough overhaul. There might even be other issues
buried deep within the philosophy of the I/O subsystem that makes it an
impossible situation.
