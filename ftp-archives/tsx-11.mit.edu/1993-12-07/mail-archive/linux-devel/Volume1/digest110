   The X server hacks are only for Linux.  I'll mail diffs to
   anyone who asks...

I got this effect by making /dev/mouse a link to something like
/dev/null or /dev/zero.   As others have pointed out, you can
set up the function keys in twm and other window managers to
allow work without mouse.

I second this request.  Changing the "standard" filesystem layout to
something unique to LINUX would mean we could no-longer say that LINUX
is "just like a typical Unix" ... and would make it less desireable for
many of us.  I, for one, want what I run on my home machine to resemble
what I use in the real world ... ie. right now, when I use LINUX on my
home machine, it's not much different (aside from display resolution and
system speed) than the Sun IPX sitting on my desk at work, at least on
a basic level..

Agreed...
I run a minimal 99pl12, a stripped XF86_Mono, term 1.07, fvwm, xclock, and
about 4 rxvt's very comfortably as long as I do all the "real" work on my
workstation at school.  I see very few page faults with this setup, but as
Brandon notes, this is about as far as 4 meg will go -- I eagerly await lower
memory prices so I can upgrade my laptop.

Here's what I would do if I had the time --
        - reconfigure X to remove all the extensions, reduce the number
          of statically allocated window records, chop out a few of the
          lesser used mfb routines (e.g., mfbarc, etc)
        - find a minimal shell, I currently run tcsh, this thing is huge,
          and so is bash

Regards,
-Todd

p.s. here's a tool us small memory types could use -- run gprof on
an executable, recording the frequency of time spent in each executed
procedure for a "typical" usage of the program, then feed this information
back into "ld" so it could order procedures in the text in decreasing order
of frequency of time executed.  This would minimize the internal fragmentation
found in allocated pages, thus maximizing the utilization of allocated
physical ram pages.  I suspect the typical program's working set size would
decrease dramatically.

        Just wondering if anyone out there is working on locking() type
functions for Linux. I am trying to port some database code, but with
no real file/record locking it is (as you can imagine) quite difficult.

        Is there any protection from a malicious network user who bombards a 
machine with fragments that never come to be a full packet? E.g. someone who 
intentioally fragments a packet and sends all but one of the fragments to 
the victim machine, and keep doing that until the victim machine runs out of 
TCP/IP buffer space? That could be a problem.

Linux already has locking functions. see flock(3) and fcntl(2). It doesn't
have locking() itself, however.

Date: Mon, 20 Sep 1993 00:47:25 GMT

I download the patch and ups2.45, but the compililation has many errors.
The most ones are MAX_PATH not defined.  I check it is actually
MAXPATHLEN,  include <limits.h> donesn't help.

Another error is <stab.h> not found.  I remember someone mentioned it
is compiled ok w/ the patch.  Can those people upload the compiled version
to a site or mail me a copy?

Thanks.


PS: my gcc is 2.4.5 from slackware 1.02.  I think it shd be the update verison.

Hello,

Has anybody else gotten their "talk" program to work after upgrading to
pl13alpha?  talk will lock up after one person types a lot and allows
the other to type one or two characters.  I have fetched talk from 
sunsite and recompiled it, yet it behaves the same way as my old binary.

I am using pl 13 alpha (the latest one on funet.fi) with: SysV ipc,
tcpip, AT1500 net drivers, 16 meg limit (becuase of the net card's 
driver), math emulation (386-40), and no kernel debugging.

Does anybody know if it's a problem with the ipc or tcp/ip code?

Thanks for any input.

Billy L. Williams, Jr.
