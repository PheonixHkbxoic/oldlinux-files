installled ok, but I cant mount the CD, floppy, or dos partition.(after

I get "mount: Unknow error 26240".

I'm running the mono server of XFree86-1.3 on my Librex notepad using the LCD
screen with no problems at all.  Early versions of the kernel needed a patch
to get psaux port working.  Will check pl13 soon since the code has been
changed.

Yup, it's not free. I cancelled the article and sent one without

Don't blame the 1542c for this - either you omitted the fs type option on
the mount command line, or - more probably - the mount point does not exist.
In any case, you seem to have a very old version of mount, with cryptic
messages like that. What's this doing in c.o.l.development, anyway ?

Subject: Multiple Man pages
Date: Tue, 21 Sep 1993 11:35:42 GMT

I have had a problem where my Slackware installation put multiple copies
of man pages into the man directories, these files are a mixture of 
.n, .n.Z and .n.z. For some commands this meant that I had three man pages
for one command. When I type 'man command' I get the page displayed three
times, not on !!

I include a small perl script I wrote which takes the piped output from an 
ls and will select the most useful of the man pages and remove the others.
The priority I have selected is
        plain manpage least useful
        compressed manpage next useful (.Z suffix)
        gzipped manpage most useful (.z suffix)
I use the fact that the output from ls is sorted into this order as the 
basic assumtion for the script. So if you cut it out and call it 'cleanMP'
then execute 'ls |cleanMP' in each of the man directories.

Let me know of any problems etc.

# ---- start of file ----
#!/usr/bin/perl

$old_command = "";

while (<>) {

        chop;

        if (/(.*)\.[1-9n]/) {

The Copyleft only applies to software that has been copylefted. What you
write can be distributed any way you want. It probably would never make
it into the official kernal distribution, but there is no reason
why you can not write it and distribute it as you say.

On the other hand there are many advantages to the copyleft. If you do
distribute the source code, the public could make bug fixes for you.
You might be able to sell alot more of those multi-port serial cards
if folks new that the drivers were freely available.

Good luck.

Subject: Re: What do people think about /config?
Date: Tue, 21 Sep 1993 11:56:34 GMT

I think that the /config idea spurs from unix sysadm
suddenly becoming a job for every PEECEE owner now
that linux is around.  I can't help but think that 
it is a really bad idea to differ from the standard
unix filesystem.  With hopes of getting some commercial
software ported to linux and a general acceptance of this 
as a _solid_ OS, I have to vote against.

/etc only contains the configuration files and executables
that are used for sysadm tasks.  Why is there talk of 
mixing X related app-defaults files, and everything with
this in another directory?  It just makes things even more 
cluttered!

I have been running linux > than a year as my only os.  I
really do not spend much time on the /etc related files,
and it is really a one time task to set it all up.  Mostly,
specifics for various applications are modified until I
like them in the home directory of me as regular joe user.
When things become good enough, they are moved into 
the respective configs.  If you go changing everything all the
time all the other users of your system are going to get
_really_ pissed.

IMHO: Leave it like it is.

Best regards
Johan

Subject: emacs19 from MCC M-^? causes suspend?
Date: 21 Sep 93 14:24:55

I've been using MCC-0.99.10+ (real easy to install, and great for
laptops, as it is easier to notice you need something and get it than
to notice that you *don't* need something and throw it away...) and it
comes with a terminal-based emacs-19.15. I've discovered that if I hit
Meta-DEL (attempting to delete the previous word) emacs19 will
suspend, and then when I foreground it, the tty modes are wrong (it's
in line mode, for example...) Using ^X^Z and fg'ing works fine.
        Anyone seen this, or know of a fix? It's a bug somewhere
(funny how the numeric value of Meta-DEL is 0xff :-)

I need to build a Gateway between thin and tp-Ethernet. 

In the HOWTO's was written that you should simply add an "Eth1"-Device in Space.c 
to install a second Ethernet-card. This doesnt seem so easy to me and I can't see 
a way to do this.

Is there anybody hwo has done this before or has an idea how to realize this ???

Here some technical informations:

Intel - 486 mainbord
8 Mb RAM
two SMC16 cards (running under DOS but not yet under Linux)
Now running SLS1.03 and linux pl.99.11

sigh. what you've *all* (well, the 20 or so in the thread as I see it
here...) missed is that "crashme" is a particular program, that
probably didn't crash Linux because it hits bugs that are common on
OS'es for RISC-based machines...
        It's been posted to the net a few times. It grabs a block of
memory, fills it with random garbage, masks (or handles?) all of the
signals, and jumps into the garbage. Older versions of DECMIPS Ultrix
would panic; I think SunOS 4 did too...
