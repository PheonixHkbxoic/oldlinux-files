Subject: crc error during install
Date: 21 Nov 1993 20:27:31 -0500



I am trying to install 0.99.13 version of SLS linux and found out 
following problem.

I tried almost a hundred times of my installation, but the install
program kept giving me "crc error" from gzip, or tar: "skipping to next
file header. stdin: invalide compressed data-- crc error".

This error happens in different files each time, even through I used
same disk for installation.(i.e: my installation file on a2-a4 are 
the same during different installation.)

I suspect it's communication chanel noise corrupt the file. But I tried
to download them from different sites, at different time. Also, I tested
them out under my SUN os account, before I downloaded them to my PC. 
The files turned out OK in my SUN os account, and I could use gzip
and untar to uncompress file without problem under DOS without any
problem. However, it turned out
the other way when you use "doinstall" under linux(I booted linux
using a1).

I would appreciate if any kind soul can give me a suggestion of what the
problem is. 



--eve

p.s. It's not hardware problem either, because I once successfully installed
the minimum and it works for two days.

Subject: no SIGHUP on process termination?
Date: Sun, 21 Nov 93 18:22:40 GMT

Hello,

today I found out, that obviously the kernel doesn't send a SIGHUP to
all processes in a session group, as it should do. The actual problem
was that a serial port wasn't closed after leaving a login bash with
a running background job. The background processes, which didn't terminate
due to the missing SIGHUP, kept the stdin/out from getting closed by
sys_exit(). That meant that uugetty wasn't able to open the port again,
and thus that port seemed to be dead for dialins. I tracked the problem
down to kernel/exit.c, which reads:

        /*
         * This loop does two things:
         * 
         * A.  Make init inherit all the child processes
         * B.  Check to see if any process groups have become orphaned
         *      as a result of our exiting, and if they have any stopped
         *      jobs, send them a SIGHUP and then a SIGCONT.  (POSIX 3.2.2.2)
         */
        while ((p = current->p_cptr) != NULL) {
                [...]
                if ((p->pgrp != current->pgrp) &&
                    (p->session == current->session) &&
                    is_orphaned_pgrp(p->pgrp) &&
                    has_stopped_jobs(p->pgrp)) {
                        kill_pg(p->pgrp,SIGHUP,1);
                        kill_pg(p->pgrp,SIGCONT,1);
                }
        }

Why is it that SIGHUP gets only sent to stopped jobs? What happens if I
remove this line (e.g. the call to has_stopped_jobs)? Does anybody know
of a solution to the problem?

gero.

Yes... yes.  

This loadable driver thing has been talked about before, and people just
said, "there is this module thing on the QIC-80 directory."  There has
been no move of it into the standard kernel distribution.

So, how about it, Linus?  This could make a lot of device drivers happy.

While I think this is good for a RW file system, inode and other

Date: Mon, 22 Nov 1993 07:39:07 GMT

Good morning.

I am something of a newcomer to the *nix world, and I hope someone can
help shed some light on how the operating system handles this sort of thing.

To take a hypothetical case, we have two commands, and we want the output
of one process to be used as input to another, so we invoke them like so:

        cmda | cmdb

and that should sort of hook stdout for cmda to stdin for cmdb, if I understand
this at all.

What happens if cmda is generating output much faster than cmdb is consuming
it?  Is there an upper limit to the amount of data linux will buffer?  How
is this determined?  Can it be changed?  One of the projects I am now involved
with has the strong probability of creating a great deal of data and doing so
much faster than the second process can hope to cope with it.

Can anyone point me in the right direction to substantiate system behaviour
under these conditions?  I would hate to have it all come screeching to a halt
after months of work...

If you don't want to consume the extra bandwidth in the news, replies would
be most welcome at broy@umrgec.eec.umr.edu.

Thanks for reading my plea!

Subject: Re: Dont't use Motif for free sw: it now requires runtime royalties!

Hi guys. Thought I would chuck in and add my sentiments to this
whole affair. I am the author of the editor CRISP and have been following
this Motif license issue with absolute and total disgust. It seems to me
the OSF has held to ransom the whole of the computing community in
a manner as distasteful as Microsoft with there 'DOS/Windows' royalties
on PCs sold.

The OSF has seriously disadvantaged small and PD software developers
to the extent that OSF & Motif are to be treated as the Nazi's of the
computing community - i.e. you get shot in the head if you are not
a member, dont have the right amount of $$$'s, dont have that 'Aryan' look
about you.

I am willing to be totally flamed for this, but the evidence I see
presented by OSF employees shows this:

        As a software manaufacturer you must ensure that sites you
        are selling software to are either Motif licensed or
        you pay a license on behalf of the customer.

        Static/dynmic linking do not come into it.

This is total pig shit.

As a pretty experienced X11 programmer having developed CRISP to run
using Athena, Motif, XView, Windows/3 and OLIT, I am therefore
proposing to either offer my services to implement a PD Motif
library from scratch or help in the implementation of one if
a group is already getting the ball rolling.

Jeeze, next we'll have Microslush copyrighting the ADD instruction
and we'll all be figuring out how to write programs without subroutines.

Is this the 20th century or am I just dreaming.

No. It was introduced by W. Almesberger and you should be able to find its
sources in any ALPHA directory (at least you should be able to find it at
tsx-11). But as far as i know, Werner has not updated the patches for the
recent kernel releases, so a patch might stall.

No, this is not what I'm saying though it sounds maybe a good idea :-)
Linux on PC's is wonderful and most of all gives you compatibility with
the wider world of UNIX machines; you can develop software for UNIX/X
and then run it on SGI's HP's or whatever if that's what you need to do.

What I'm saying is that the Amiga has a superb operating system with very
fast task switching; it is properly multi-tasking like UNIX yet requires
minimal disk space/memory, etc. to run (how many UNIXes do you know which
can be run on a 512k machine with on 880k floppy drive?). Obviously more
memory and a large hard disk makes the system more useable. I imagine
the reasone for wanting Linux on the Amiga is the same as wanting it on
a PC; for compatibility with bigger machines.

I was simply pointing out that the original suggestion of devices as
tasks was not a bad idea and that it has been done elsewhere; I'm not
saying AmigaDOS is perfect (it doesn't have virtual memory or task protection
though VM is available as a third party product). Indeed, I'm planning
to buy a Linux PC in the next month for compatibility reasons though my
Amiga will remain my main working machine.

   [...] the rather unfortunate decision of the Mosaic team to develop
   with Motif.  When I raised an alarm on the use of Motif several
   months ago, Marc Andreessen justified the choice on ease of using
   the widgets, but excused the choice by pointing out that Mosaic
   would be available statically linked for most significant platforms
   at NCSA.  The Linux crowd have been posting statically linked
   versions of Mosaic on sunsite and other sites for some time now,
   even with builtin term support I believe.  Mosaic is perhaps the
   single most important free Internet application and the modal way
   of acquiring it is to ftp it from one of these sites, already
   statically linked.  If the statements about license fees for every
   distributed copy are true, then those of us who have been getting
   Mosaic this way will be cut off.

Responding to both this post and others...

(a) Our academic site license lets us distribute free,
    statically-linked binaries of Mosaic compiled with Motif 1.2 all
    we want.  We can distribute dynamically-linked binaries of Mosaic
    compiled with Motif 1.2 as well, as long as we don't distribute
    the Motif libraries themselves along with the dynamically-linked
    binaries (which we would't).  Please don't argue with me on these
    points unless you're an OSF lawyer, as they are -- so far as I
    know, and based on conversations with OSF folks -- facts.  And
    remember, Motif 1.1 was even less restrictive, and is still widely
    used (our own Sun binaries, for example, are linked to 1.1).

(b) EVERY significant workstation vendor has committed to Motif, and
    everyone but Sun has been shipping it for quite some time.  (Sun
    is apparently finally getting around to shipping it as beta
    software to some Solaris customers, and will have it out in force
    early next year -- it is damned annoying that they've stalled on
    this as long as they have.  But that's Sun.)  

    Motif is the closest thing there is to a de facto interface
    standard on Unix workstations.  (Athena does *not* count, and
    neither does tcl/tk -- flames will be ineffectual as we take
    Mosaic too seriously to base it on anything not directly supported
    by the majority of hw/sw vendors out there.  And besides, there's
    already a fine tcl/tk browser.)

    No, Motif isn't free, and it doesn't come with Linux and similar
    systems.  All I can say is that for Mosaic for X's target user
    base, the vendors have it covered, and for the user base of which
    Linux is a part (Intel 386/486/Pentium), we're developing Mosaic
    for Windows.  Not a perfect solution, but it does give us broader
    coverage than any of the imaginable alternatives with the
    foundation of vendor-supported technology on each platform.  Also,
    don't get me wrong -- I love the idea of running Mosaic for X
    under Linux, and will probably be doing that myself in the not too
    distant future; remember, all it really takes is someone with an
    academic site license for Motif and a Linux box to make a binary
    everyone can use, or donate us a development system and we'll do
    it.

Cheers,
Marc
