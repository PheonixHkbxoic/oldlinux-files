However, I did go on to say that you might get away with it if you had enough 
CPU time and your ethernet happened to be quick enough. This will mostly be
true for small systems on fairly fast networks - you can even get mpegs
working quite well on the CL's DECstations on occasions (ie. the middle of
the night!). Now try playing an audio file whilst running three or four
compilations, an mpeg, and editing a file in emacs - a real-time OS would
probably either do it or return a 'scheduler can't comply' error or warning -
UNIX will just slow down, breaking the audio and video streams. You can do 
this kind of thing under UNIX, and you will usually get away with it under 
low system load, but to rely on it working is not advisable at peak times -
on my machine, at least (*)! A BBC micro or an Archimedes running RISCOS, which
provides (essentially) non-preemptable single-tasking would be better for this -
MS-DOS would at least be reliable (inasmuch as you can call MS-DOS reliable!).
 Of course, you'd also have to use some kind of reliable network, such as a
direct ethernet connection between the two machines (ie. with nothing else
using the net) if there was a possibility of network slowdown :-).

 That said, I was answering a question the poster hadn't asked - sorry!

Ok but if its concerning pentium's i'm very interested! So if linux does boot
on your pentium hot rod, then why don't you give us your Bogo Mips number.
I expect it to be the same number as a 486 DX2 66 MHz (35.5 or so).
But of course no shame to linus, because at the moment there's  even
no commercial OS on the market that boost's the power of the pentium.
So we just have to wait for the 100 MHz version to get 51.5 or something
like that reported as the new record.

I don't know about those, but a loadable device drivers package does exist
for Linux.  It's called "modules" and can be found on tsx-11.mit.edu in

It would seem that the core size limit now defaults to zero.  In order to fix
this, you need to put "ulimit -c <size_in_kbytes>" in your /etc/profile (if
you're using bash) or the equivalent command for your shell in whatever place
would be appropriate.

Since the core size limit is a per-process value, I know of no way to change
it on a system-wide basis other than by hacking the kernel or hacking init.

Yes, it does, and pleeze don't start this discussion again. Hunting Bogomipses

Try including <sys/param.h> and changing RLIMIT_NOFILE to NOFILE.
Oh, and use -DSYSV in the CFLAGS.
I assumed it was just a definei for the maximum number of files
that could be opened, I didn't check real hard, but I've used
the binary that I compiled as a result for months without a problem.

Hey,  who needs Ma Bell?  lets just talk over our modems and the
internet :)   Toll-Free?

Well,  I guess I'll have to post again... seems I answered this a
while ago but it never appeared on the net :(

11Khz is very very very good audio,  we don't need that.  I think that
the goal should be *understandable* speech over the net and that
shouldn't be too hard.

Now for the class:

8Khz is what the Telephone company uses in its *entire* digital
transmission and it is what makes up the basic building blocks for the
network.  8k * 8 Bit = 64000 bps  which is standard 'toll-quality'
"hear a pin drop" audio,  We can get away with much less.

We will be transmitting speech over the net not music so you need to
think of frequency ranges of human speech.  I believe (don't have the
book in front of me) that human speech is ~300hz - 4kHz, now in order
to digitize ananlog accuratly you need 2x(max Hz) sampling rate,
anything more than that is overkill  so 4kHz * 2 = 8K samples
(Telco...)

I have heard 16000bps audio before and it is understandable with a
nasty echo,  I can deal with it, I think most people can.

In order to get 16kbps you need to cut the sampling rate and the bits
sampled in half  (4kx4)  this will accuratly reproduce 2kHz audio
which is a little higher than most Male voices,  This will *not*
affect Male voices too much, Female voices will on the other hand go
down the tubes.   I think the sampling rate should be adjustable.

Now,  I think UDP packets will work,  they have alot less overhead and
we don't really need the packets at the same time,  frame slipping
(packets out of order) sounds like static to the ear, it will kill a
modem but voice doesn't matter too much.  As long as we can get the
packets lined up ok,  If it becomes a problem I think we can add a
32-bit packet counter and have the receiving end hold onto an early
packet for a second to see if one that belongs before it will come in.

I have know idea how big the buffer is for a Sound Blaster (tm) but I
will assume 1k ,  we therefore would need to send 1k packets 16 times
a second.  I think a CPU can handle this and the network can definatly
handle it  (you can send 155 Toll quality voice channels on 1 10 mb
ethernet).  I think we should set up a bufferin size optimal to the
network transport layer (1k, 4k) in linux and buffer the incoming
packets.

I don;t see any reason why linux couldn't handle 16k/s through the
net.

Now, If we had a sound card that did compression -or- added some sort
of huffman-encoding or fractal compression scheme in the process we
could boost the sampling/bit rate and still not affect performance.

Remember 16k is *not* that bad at all, it is understandable...

-Hope this helps,

If you want any more help let me know...

I have received informal confirmation as to this, from some OSF guy and
from an OSF licensee that has consulted his company's legal/marketing
people.

As of 1.2.x statically or dynamically linked binaries using the
OSF/Motif libraries involve the payment of a royalty to OSF, in all
cases, without exception.

There are two ways to pay such royalty: the end user pays it by
purchasing his/her own copy of the OSF/Motif runtime package, or the
developer distributing the binary pays it for each copy included in the
binaries distributed.

For most commercial OSes the 1.2.x runtime libraries (and royalty) are
bundled in the cost of the OS license, so the developer need not pay the
royalty again; thus a developer need pay a royalty only for every copy
of an OSF/Motif application that is distributed for an OS (like any free
OS) for which an OSF/Motif runtime license is not bundled in, or if they
don't have proof that the user has purchased their own copy of the
OSF/Motif runtime.

If the end user has not paid the runtime royalty either by buying it
bundled with the OS or by buying it separately, the developer may avoid
paying the royalty only by continuing to use the 1.1.x libraries.

Which is what I had written in my original article in a more succinct
form, BTW.

Subject: Always IN-2000 abort after kernel load.  BIOS error?
Date: 19 Nov 1993 16:32:51 GMT


I am currently using an Always IN-2000 SCSI controller with an
AppleCD 300 to try to install the Yggdrasil CD distribution.
After loading linux, it sees the IN-2000, configures it for, say,
IRQ 15 and port 0x200. Following an IN-2000 prompt it says
  IN2000 abort
and the screen fills with garbage. I have heard that IN-2000 has
recently upgraded their BIOS and perhaps I have an older card. 
Does anyone have any suggestions? Incidentally booting from zImage
in tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/ALPHA/scsi/in2000 gives the same 
error as the Yggdrasil boot disk. Flipping dip switches to change
IRQs and ports hasn't helped yet either, although I haven't tried
all possible configurations.

Thanks for any and all help!

Ethernet really provides more than enough bandwidth for even multiple 
simultaneous bi-directional audio streams.  Unless you want to transmit CD
quality sound today, 11Khz is more than acceptable for voice communication.
I'm pretty sure ITR uses an 11khz sample rate.  Even the slowest ethernet
around runs at about 2Mbps.  You only need about 4kbps for half duplex
voice communication, 8kbps for full duplex, and this is without any super
fancy codecs, although I think ADPCM is probably warranted.  Most ethernet
that has been installed in the last several years runs at 10Mbps, and gives
you even more bandwidth.  Summary: just about any ethernet will do.  Even
on systems with alot of traffic, you can usually grab 4kbps worth of bandwidth
and if you can't, the network needs to be upgraded.  Now if you can't because
one hundred people are doing bidirectional voice over your physical layer,
that's another matter entirely. :)

The only reason you would ever need to use a real-time OS for something like
this was if you absolutely, positively couldn't have one bit of data out of
a meg worth of data come in one second later than it was supposed to.  I
don't think anybody was asking that question, except maybe you.  My
ears just aren't that good to sense a one bit difference in a sample a
couple of minutes in length. :)

:  Of course, you'd also have to use some kind of reliable network, such as a
: direct ethernet connection between the two machines (ie. with nothing else
: using the net) if there was a possibility of network slowdown :-).

It's interesting that you say this, as before you stated that you didn't
think ethernet was capable enough(passage quoted earlier).

Now biderectional video _and_ audio?  I don't know, haven't thought about it
too much, but I think that would be more of an I/O bus limitation on most 
machines than a limit of the physical network- or UNIX.  An OS can't grant
a machine with more abilities than it is physically capable of. :)

Full screen bidirectional near-lossless video and audio.  Hmmm. :)
You might need one hell of a CODEC, and apparently the IETF is testing it.
The CODEC is really needed not so to provide the capability that one such
session could exist over 10MB ethernet, with low traffic, but that
multiple such sessions could be running, and you could run bidirectional video
and audio over _2Mbps_ ethernet, with the proper codec of course.
