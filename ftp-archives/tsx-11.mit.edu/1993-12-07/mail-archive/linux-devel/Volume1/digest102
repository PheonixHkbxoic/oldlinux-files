I am trying to get Linux up, I have a DTC 3280AS SCSI card, works fine under
dos/os2/windows/SCO Unix.  The SLS kernal does not recognize it.  Is there a
driver available?  If not can some one give me some clues on how to use the
SCO drivers or build my own.

Very greatfull to all help.

David

PS The DTC 3283 (?) I have been told is recognized as an Adaptec but it
looks like the 3280 is different.

Sorry, I misread.  This idea may have some merit, in that people who
wanted to could blow away /config (like we have blown away /conf :).
It kinda seems "bloaty", but if it can be made optional I guess it
wouldn't kill anybody.  I still don't like it, but like I said, if
I can ignore it then I'll probably be able to deal with it :)

I am still apparently missing the point as to why an "ordinary user"
would want to (or be allowed to) change config files though.  But the
whole idea doesn't seem nearly as evil as it did the first time I read it :)

That's me. There are some minor compatibility problems right now (basically,
once you install the BSD stuff, programs compiled under it won't run on
"normal" Linuxes) and interrupt latency is really horrible for some reason
or another (somebody wanted to enhance the cli()/sti()/restore_flags()
macros to find those problems), card support is still almost nonexistent,
and there's a memory hole somewhere which shows up when using SLIP -- 
but the basic stuff works and is in production use on subnet.sub.net.

Hi y'all,

I am collecting a list of software packages that people have installed
and used successfully under Linux/X. I am interested in hearing about
installations and other tips that Linux-cummunity might want to know.
I hope to consolidate this in the form of a "FAQ" ...

Things in particular:

        Name of software (and what it does).
        Location and what files are needed ....
        Source available?
        How big is the source? The binaries?
        Does it have printed docs?
        How about Online Docs? Man pages?
        How much memory is required for it?
        Hints and tips when re-compiling, installing, configuring or
                using the package
        Idiosyncracies and bugs
        Comments

I have not found a good source to go to when looking for software
packages to perform given tasks ... for example, I started to look 
for a PD Neural Nets package and had to go rummaging through all 
sorts of stuff to find what I needed (after I looked through the
nnet-FAQ). It would be helpful to have a list of packages that
you could flip through to find what you needed relatively quickly 
by doing a name/subject search!

Please mail Comments, suggestions, etc to me at

                           sundaram@cps.msu.edu


Thanks in advance

sure.. how about a network monitor/analyser.  A program that monitors and

figure why their tcp/ip isn't working.

It is a GREAT! idea for the following reasons:
1: it reduces the potential errors from typos and simple oversights
2: not every user has a sysadmin guru living next door to go and
ask.  The suggestion that users should keep their systems inoperable because
they should not attempt to learn is beyonf counter-productive. 
User-specific programs don't exist for almost all the the important apps
listed below
3: tcp/ip, nfs, mail, news and uucp alone accounts for over 30 config files, much of which is duplicated.

It should also have the capability to add 'configuration sets' where by a
user can add additional config files, or a developer can ship the apps
config-set with the app, so all a user has to do it add the set to their
config util, fill in the missing blanks and go!

FTP Software 'confedit' utility is a good example of what you are talking
about, including config-sets and help.  Unfortunately, FTP's implementation 
is so crippled it is useless.

DO IT!

Yes. Here are some excerpts from correspondence last April with Chet Ramey,
author of bash 1.13.cwru.

=============================================================================
Chet,

I noticed a problem with my mail. My MUA (elm) calls the MTA
/usr/lib/sendmail (smail) in the following way (I wrote a /bin/sh which
logs
all parameters):

/bin/bash -c '( (/usr/lib/sendmail -oi -oem "devet@win.tue.nl" ; /bin/rm
-f/tmp
/snd.03447aaa) & ) < /tmp/snd.03447aaa'

The /tmp/snd.. file contains the body of the mail. When using bash 1.12 the
body gets included in the message, but when using bash 1.13cwru I get an
empty body: the contents of the /tmp/snd.. file does not get read by
sendmail.

Any ideas how this can be solved?

Arjan

A background job running in a non-job-control environment gets
/dev/null as stdin.  Posix specifies this, and qualifies it with the
statement that explicit redirections override this implicit one.  The
command to which the `&' is applied has no explicit redirections; the
redirection is applied to the subshell created because of the ( ). 
This redirection happens before the shell that runs sendmail and rm is
forked. 

Consider the difference between this command:
        cat > ./ppp < /etc/printcap &
and this one:
        cat > ./ppp & < /etc/printcap

As a consequence of the /dev/null rule, the first results in a copy of
/etc/printcap in ppp, while the second leaves ppp an empty file.

If you change the command elm runs to something like

/bin/bash -c '( (/usr/lib/sendmail -oi -oem "devet@win.tue.nl" ; /bin/rm
-f /tmp
/snd.03447aaa) </tmp/snd.03447aaa & )'

it will probably work.

This is a case where bash is not `bug-for-bug compatible' with sh.

Chet
=============================================================================

The fix suggested is present in the latest version of Elm (2.4.22) and
maybe even earlier. So upgrade your Elm. Because of a bug in bash 1.12
this Elm `bug' does not show up when using bash 1.12 as /bin/sh.

Bash 1.13.cwru was not the only shell which had problems with this Elm
`bug'. My report also solved the problem for BSD people using Elm and ash
as /bin/sh.

I think this would be a good idea if it would also take current files
from /etc and /usr/lib and create the files in /config, also.  I
could see a lot of problems from people accidentally nuking all their
conf files with an error in the /config file...

"Small pieces?" Yeah, and how.  Look at this gem, pulled from

#define switch_to(n) {\

Also take a look at the #define REMOVE_FROM_MEM_QUEUE(queue,nr)

While I'm perfectly comfortable with the status quo, this sounds
kind of nifty, and certainly less icky than modifying all executables
to look for config files in /config instead of their standard
locations, or setting up hundreds of soft links.

I think the best way of going about this would be to make the basic
/config system available as a package, then encourage developers
to make scripts available for their products, if necessary.

I do have to question the usefulness of using /config with the password
and group files, however.  There are a large number of commands which
modify these directly (useradd, chsh, chfn, etc.).  If a user changed
his login shell with chsh, for example, and then added a new user by
using the /config files, his shell would revert back.  I don't think it's
a good idea to confuse things further by having two versions of these
commands, either.

I think that this is not only wonderful for the Linux user/developer
community, but furthermore I think it demonstrates a superb marketing
strategy!

Now, how many of you would have spent upwards of $2000 to purchase
OI/OB for your home computer?  I didn't think so!

Now, how many of you, having been given the chance to use and
learn OI/OB at home for free, will convince your company to buy a
multiuser license for the workstations at work?  Great!  Everyone
wins, the Linux community, you, your employer, and ParcPlace.

Is ParcPlace a publicly traded company?  Is so, what's the ticker
