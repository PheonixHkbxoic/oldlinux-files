   You apparently haven't thought about it at all.  The reason that
   multi-volume support needs to be in tar is so that later volumes
   can be complete archives, and (except for the file split between
   volumes) can be read without needing context from a previous
   volume.

   If you just take the output of tar and split it into volumes (with,
   say, split) then you are more susceptible to failures.  Unless, of
   course, you teach split about tar format.

No-one suggested that split was any good for the job, and indeed
people were (to my mind) implying that something which knows about tar
files should be there to do the job.  The point is that, for 99% of the
time tar is run, there is going to be absolutely no need for
multi-volume support, and therefore multi-volume support should be in
a separate program which doesn't get loaded every time tar is run.
And before you say 'demand loading', bear in mind that the code for
multi-volume support in tar would more than likely be well mixed up
with the rest of the code for tar and would be paged in regardless.

Basically, if you want cat (or tar, or whatever else) with added
functionality, then you should either not call the enhanced program
'cat' or enhance the program by external means (filters or whatever).
Having said that, I like using GNU tar simply because it's the only
way I can get the multi-volume and other enhanced support it supplies.
However, that doesn't mean that I think it's the right way to supply
the added functionality.

Subject: Can LINUX kill IDE drives?
Date: Wed, 1 Dec 1993 00:46:08 GMT


I aplogise for posting a question to this group instead of
comp.os.linux.questions, but if the answer is YES, then it should
probably be addressed here.  Also, please email replies to
"wpd@bdl.era.com", as I do not have regular access to this account in
order to read news.  Finally, I have had some difficulties posting this
message, so it may appear more than once.

Now that the disclaimers are out of the way, let me tell you what
happened.

I recently purchased a Quantum 240M IDE drive and installed it as a
slave to my MAXTOR 120M IDE drive.  Since I bought this expressly for
the purpose of running LINUX, I immediately installed the Yggdrasil Fall
Release on /dev/hdb2 and started to play.  (I set up a 16M swap partion
on /dev/hdb1).  A few hours later, /dev/hda1 failed as I was trying to
mount it as a DOS partition.  I was pretty bummed, but I assumed that it
was just one of those unfortunate coincidences.  I ordered an
out-of-warrantee replacement from MAXTOR and repartitioned the 240M
drive as two 120M drives and continued with DOS on one partition and
LINUX on the other.  Everything was working fine with this arrangement.

When the replacement drive appeared, I installed it, again as the master
drive, and repartitioned & reinstalled LINUX on partitions on /dev/hdb. 
Very soon thereafter, my machine started to have problems finding one or
both of the disks after it booted.  I fiddled & futzed, and finally
settled on using the Quantum drive (240M) as the master and the MAXTOR
drive (120M) as the slave, with a small 1M partition on the Quantum
drive that had AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.sys pointing to everything living
on drive D:, the MAXTOR drive.  That worked well enough, but I wasn't
too thrilled with the solution.  Since my local computer salesman knew
that I was unhappy with this arrangement, he offered to swap the 240M
Quantum drive with a 240M MAXTOR drive in the hopes that the problem was
somehow related to vendor incompatibilites. 

Now comes the scary part.  I made the swap, tried installing LINUX on
the 240M MAXTOR drive as a slave, and at one point during the
installation, I heard a noise that sounded like a Warp Engine failure
from a bad Star Trek episode.  (Seriously, it sounded like something was
literally applying the brakes to one of the drives).  I shut the power
down as quickly as I could and, when I turned the beastie back on, sure
enough, it could not find one or both of the drives, depending on its mood.

I have managed to get the thing running again.  (I'm not too sure how,
but I tried various combinations of master/slave relationships between
the drives as well as position on the drive cable and eventually things
started working again).  I am now running DOS only on both drives and
they seem to work fine.  I have run all of the disk diagnostic programs
I can find and have not seen any errors, but I am afraid to try
installing LINUX again.

FInally, the question...
Does anybody have any idea what my problem might be?  Can anyone point
me in the direction of IDE specs. so that I can try to track this down
myself.  I would appreciate comments on this matter.  Please mail
replies to "wpd@bdl.era.com".  I hope to have more regular access to
news soon, but I cannot easily follow this group.

I'm having a problem running nfs...
I run the rpc.ugidd and rpc.mountd but when I go to run rpc.nfsd I get this
line:


Cannot register service: RPC: Unable to receive; errno = Connection refused
unable to register(NFS_PROGRAM, NFS_VERSION, UDP).


why?  It won't run nfs and I can't mount anything on the net without it.

someone said that the fact that I'm running Net2Debugged might be the problem.
How do I go to the regular Net2?   I tried this with pl13q and now with pl14.

I understand it's included in a current draft standard... and, so far, POSIX
has specified its existing behavior (in every *ix except Linux).  Since it's
not final, it may yet change... but if it becomes a final standard as is,
Linux will be noncompliant.

Well, you can already buy any of a number of Motif-compatible libraries, 
and none of them seem to be threatening OSF/Motif.  There is an extremely
high value in having a standard API.  

A major factor in Motif's victory over OPEN LOOK was that there were three 
competing APIs for OL- XView, OLIT, and tNt.  So, not only did developers 
need to choose between OL and Motif, but if they selected OL, they had to 
go through still another evaluation to pick which OL toolkit to use. Uuugh!

I haven't seen OSF to be any more agressive now than in the past in regards
to licensing, royalties, and such...

I think you considerably underestimate the number of non-Linux-using
XFree86 users, and the various factors which will keep them non-Linux-
using.  That's not to detract from Linux's wonderfulness--it's just an
observation of the circumstances many of us live under, and our widely
varying needs.

IMHO, you're the one being dogmatic by insisting that XFree86 be viewed
solely from a Linux-side perspective.  What you are saying is that
XFree86 should set up its video modes under Linux in a way completely
different from other systems.  That's a major shift, and I don't think
the added utility merits the grief of reworking that entire mechanism
and the resulting divergence of code.  Acceleration was a different
matter, with much wider potential impact, and utility which extended far
beyond ease of system setup.

In other words, there is a balancing act which the XFree86 team has to
perform, between effort, resources, and utility.  Rating each of these
factors involves considerable judgement, so there is bound to be some
controversy.  But in the XFree86 team's work I've seen so far there has
been a common thread: expand the number of platforms where XFree86 works
while keeping the OS- and hardware-specific variations to the minimum
consonant with reasonable performance.

As to the question at hand, I'm surprised that Curtis hasn't suggested a
middle course, one which doesn't hinder the Linux folks from making good
use of their systems' capabilities: develop a utility which uses dosemu
to set up BIOS video modes, probe them, and output corresponding modeDB
entries.  That way, XFree86 won't have to carry a lot of Linux-specific
code.  Furthermore, it doesn't tie Linux users to the video modes
implemented in their BIOS (assuming they know what they are doing in
tweaking their timings).

This seems a lot more reasonable than attempting to browbeat the XFree86
team into adding such a feature to the server.

OK, I had it wrong.  Here is the correct patch to "make jiffies ticks".  As
