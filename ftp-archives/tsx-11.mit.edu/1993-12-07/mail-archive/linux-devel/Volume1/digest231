Hi all,

A few questions and please pardon my ignorance, if I inadvertently show some  
:-).

Is there in the public domain (or GPL) a CORBA compliant ORB (and related  
technologies)?  

Is anyone working on one that they intend to place in the public domain?  Do  
you want some help? 

Is there any ORB-like technology that could be made into a CORBA compliant ORB,  
that anyone knows of?

I might be interested in starting (and/or coordinating) some kind of project in  
this area, if anyone is interested.  I have Linux at home and would probably do  
this work on it.  If a project of this nature were started what would you do  
and how would you do it?  What technologies would be necessary? etc...

Any ideas and/or flames welcome.

Please respond by e-mail and I will summarize if there is interest...

Thanks!
Bryan

Too bad that it's the wrong answer.  The BusLogic EISA and VLB controllers
have an enhanced mode, but it is not the same as the Adaptec 174x enhanced
mode.  The native mode of the BusLogic controllers is the same as the
Adaptec 154x.

The BusLogic enhanced mode is a lot nicer, too.  You don't have to change
EISA config to change modes; your driver simply puts the card into enhanced
mode.  According to the SCSI driver developer at Microport, adding support
for the BusLogic enhanced mode was absolutely trivial, compared to the
work involved to get the Adaptec working.  Suffice it to say that my
Microport SVR4 box boots with Adaptec 1542b code on the boot/install
floppy, then reinstalls an enhanced SCSI driver that switches the board
into enhanced mode automatically (the enhanced driver, which supports
154x + BusLogic, Adaptec, and DPT enhanced SCSI modes, was too big to fit
in the floppy-boot kernel).  With an Adaptec 174x, you would have to
shut down and reconfigure your hardware to get into enhanced mode.

Runs like a bat out of hell, too.

Don't forget about Motif-derived widgets. Let's say you would subclass 
XmText to handle multiple fonts. If we don't want to break such things,
we must at least name our structures ,internal functions ... like Motif does.

One might argue about that. : e.g. RowColumn has about 300 kB of source.

Subject: Time frame for GCC 2.5.2?
Date: Tue, 16 Nov 1993 19:45:44 GMT

Is anyone working on bringing all the necessary libraries, etc.
up to a level where it is safe and sane to move to GCC 2.5.2?

I'm developing a C++ GUI toolkit that would be greatly improved
by the fixes made to templates in 2.5.2, but I gather that
it's not particularly safe to build the current libc and
libg++ of Linux with 2.5.x. Right now I use an incredibly
heinous hack to avoid building an enormous library with
a bazillion redundant template expansions.

Still, I don't want to move to 2.5.x until others can and will
generally do so, because the toolkit is of little use if
most people won't have the necessary tools to build it properly.
I understand Slackware just moved *back* to 2.4.5 because of
the problems mentioned above, so I post this here as a plea
to system builders to upgrade the affected subsystems to
the necessary level.

Has anyone gotten sento and recvfrom to work with a SOCK_PACKET socket?
I'm having some problems figuring out there interface to the
socket and sentto/recvfrom calls for this socket type.

I'd appreciate any information at all. Source code that actually
uses them would be most appreciated.

Subject: Linux Modem Server 2.09beta1 available for Beta Testing
Date: 17 Nov 1993 09:49:58 +1100

Linux Modem SERVER version 2.09beta1

Now available for BETA testing.

AVAILABLE:

yarrina.connect.com.au:/tmp/mdm/mdm-2.09-beta1.tar.gz

WHAT IS IT:

A replacement for GETTY/UUGETTY.
Handles dialins/dialouts on your Unix System with the DUEL TTY system

FEATURES:

*EASY* config files.
Much better logging.
Debug modes where you can see all the data being sent/recieved
while initialising.
Multiple configs, one for each line.
Specifically for HAYES compatable intelligent modems.
Fully UUCP aware, will allow UUCP or EMSI mailers to dial out
correctly, and also allows Termial Packages to use the line.
(Eg Xcomm, kermit, minicom, Seyon).
DOESN'T NEED or USE LOCK FILES!!
Has support for 57600 and 115200 speeds.
Can be used with High speed Constant speed modems or with
variable speed modems.

COPYRIGHTS:

Please read COPYING for more details on the licence of this product.

MISC:

**PLEASE** DON'T send this out with any changes, send me patch
files if you fix or modify anything, and I will release
it with your patches, and recognition of the patch.

It is designed to do what uugetty does not.

Compiling and Installation

just type 

make install - To make and install the files
make - To make the binary

To make the program, and install the files.

I use GCC 2.4.3, with 0.99pl12 kernal.

Edit the Makefile to select what log file you want to use
and if you want device logging.

-DDEBUG will send a lot of information to the logfile and
the logging device, but is recommended until you are sure
everything is working.

There are a few config files that are used, the main GLOBAL
configuration fileis in /etc/default/modem.

It is used for all lines, unless a seperate config file is present
which will overide any options.
Have a look at this file for details of the options.

To make a seperate config for a different tty, just make a tty?? file
in the /etc/default directory with the overiding commands in it.

an example is in /etc/default/ttyS1

Which is loaded for the modem server on ttyS1

Command line parameters :-

/etc/modem tty speed login

eg:

/etc/modem ttys1 2400 bbs

This will Initialise the modem at 2400 baud. (Configuration files
can override this option). and will login as BBS when connected.
If you leave the login option blank, it will execute login
to allow the user to login as normal.

TODO: 

Option to make it shut the speaker up at certain times..
Send a "WAKEUP" to the modem ever half an hour or so..
(Eg AT|) to make sure the modem has not died.
adding mtmp for keeping the current speed/rel of a connected tty.
dialin server type support (Like a real annex) :)
probably plenti of other nice things...

If you have any probs, additions, fixes mail me

Subject: Xmosaic + term ?
Date: 16 Nov 1993 20:10:34 GMT


Hi all,

I tried running Xmosaic on a decstation over 9600 baud modem with term.
While it worked, it was hopelessly slow.

What occurred to me that perhaps I could run Xmosaic locally on my
linux box, and it could use the term channel to fetch the data.

I'm a newbie on Xmosaic, and have not really done my homework,
but it seems to me that at least in principle this should work.

I believe that Xmosaic is built on top of motif widgets, so I won't be
able to compile it - I'm just asking if anybody has done this thing
already.

Thanks,

Harri

PS. Where can I find Xmosaic binary for linux?

Subject: How many BogoMips on a Pentium?
Date: 16 Nov 1993 20:23:00 GMT

Hi,

Just to satisfy my curiosity:

If you have booted Linux on a Pentium machine, how many BogoMips did you
get?

For the record, my Intel 386/33 gives 5.99 BogoMips.  I hear Cyrix 486DLC40
should give around 13.  What about other processors?


Thanks,

Harri

PS. Why would anyone think I have a moment of idle time in my hands :)
But still, these things hold a certain fashination for me, must be
like the thing how fast a car can go from 0 to 100; important to
some people.

Subject: term: any filesystems over term?
Date: 16 Nov 1993 18:38:09 -0500


I've been using term extensively (both from my home PC and from my
laptop... the PC only dials in to one place [the office] but the
laptop connects to various places [the home pc, the office, another
office at MIT where I volunteer...] so it's a bit more convenient and
reliable than SLIP...) and find it very useful. In particular,
termtelnet, termncftp, termxmosaic are very nice to have. (I even run
uucp over term, but that's a scary [though secure] kludge that you
really don't want to try :-)
        Anyway, the one thing I find missing is remote filesystem
access. tupload is useful, sure, and emacs ftp-find-file probably
works ok with term-ftp -- except that I don't usually have an ftpd on
the remote machine (and I haven't yet seen RMAIL work with
ftp-find-file :-)
        Has anyone done anything like this before? If you assume that
the client need only work on the Linux side, you could use the linux
user-process file server support on this end, with another program on
the other side. You might want to do some clever caching, but reliable
access, even if slow, would be a good start.
        I probably won't have a chance to implement anything like this
before Christmas (by which point I'll probably have an ethernet card
anyway :-) so I thought I'd toss out the idea to see if it caught
anyone's attention. (I'd certainly be willing to provide some advice
and suggestions via email, perhaps even alpha-test.) Any takers?
