I think any possible damage to monitor will not be caused by inappropriate
selection of the dotclock itself, but by the combination of the dotclock
and the horizontal and vertical division ratios.
It would be a big help when the server (or some auxilliary utility) would
display the resulting horizontal and vertical frequencies for each mode, so
they could be verified against the monitor specs.

My monitor has a small LCD display which can display the H and V frequencies,
and it automatically switches off and displays "Out of Range" when they are
inappropriate.  But not all monitors have such a feature, and manual
verification of the setup would be eased by display of the frequencies by
a program.

An automatic configuration program should be able to display the resulting
frequencies, and possibly the user should be asked to keyin limits on H
and V frequencies acceptable for his monitor.  (in text mode, of course :-)

That's what it is supposed to do on an ANSI terminal...
If you don't like it, write to ANSI (or DEC who seems to have originally

There are a lot of things that would be more convenient about attribute

Actually, nothing happening is somewhat expected, too.

Remember that the 68040 part of the kernel has not been tested at all
(because I can't test it).  There are probably all sorts of bugs
lurking in there

This is correct.

Sure, if we had any expectation that the 68040 code is working
correcly the first time.  I didn't have any such expectation.

For us to get this working, someone with a 68040 has to take the bull
by the horns and *DEBUG* the kernel.  I can't do it.  I can *help*
with advice, but I can't debug it.

This requires that they be able to recompile the kernel, with all the
kernel development environment installation that this implies.

As a start, a terminal attached (through a null-modem) to the serial
port will get information indicating how far the kernel initialization
got before some error occurred.

Not quite, QNX 4.2 has been shipping for a couple months now.  It ships 
with the Watcom v9.5 Pentium optimizing compiler, and is itself, compiled 
from top to bottom with that compiler.  :-)

To Linus's credit, he needs a GCC that does Pentium optimization.  Hopefully
one will happen soon.

The problem is that cycling through various video modes looking for one
that works makes it VERY easy to put you into a video mode that your monitor
can't handle, thus possibly damaging it.

It can probably be shown statistically that this method is no more dangerous
than calculating usable values. (lies, damn lies, and statistics) However,
I would be cautious about recommending this method to other users, after all,
if someone blows up their monitor (exaggeration) because of something that
I recommend, well, whose fault is it? Even with a loud disclaimer, if I
distribute this method as a safe and easy alternative to doing the numbers
by hand, well, the waters are a little murky if it doesn't work.

I apologize if the above paragraph doesn't make as much sense as I intended
it to. The bottom line is this: if improper Xconfig values damage a monitor,
there are only so many people you can blame:

1. The XFree86 team.
        This is unlikely. These people are wonderful programmers and I have
yet to see any claim against them substantiated.

2. The manufacturer.
        Providing incorrect information is certainly possible but is probably
not very common and most likely due to typographical error.

3. The user.
        Provided that the "officially" recommended methods of finding
Xconfig values is used, (and done correctly) there should never be any
damage caused by the user. If there is, perhaps you can place blame on the
XFree86 team, but it's unlikely that a bug causing just YOUR monitor to
fry would go unnoticed long enough for it to happen.
        If you go cycling through video modes willy-nilly, the possibility
of damage becomes significantly greater, and the blame can be placed on
whoever came up with the video modes. (because none of the video modes except
VESA standards can be "guaranteed" safe.)

I personally wouldn't want to be responsible for the latter, but I don't
personally care how you get your Xconfig numbers. But, if you're not using
the XFree86 recommended method, don't try to blame them unless you can prove
conclusively that there's a bug in the code.

Hear hear!

My complaint is that the GNU project is _accelerating_ this process by
producing old tools with many, many, new `enhancements'.  Stop it!

I find multi-volume IO very useful, for example.  But don't add it to
tar, dd, cpio, etc.  Think first, and make a new tool for the purpose,
and keep it simple.

I also think there's a problem here in understanding the difference
between a professional opinion and a personal preference.  Too many
people seem to love software that is neat and clever without
considering the wider implications.  There are basic software
principles which are being ignored: simplicity and elegance are not
just a matter of aesthetics, they are a matter of efficiency.
Efficiency is a matter of economics!  Imagine if each individual
component of your system required a tenth of the memory and ran twice
as fast.  Imagine if you were using really simple and solid tools
whose documentation took you only minutes to absorb.

I'm getting responses along the lines of `why not write it yourself?'
I dream about it.  However, I'm paid to put my skills to use for the
direct benefit of my employers.  Again, here I have a professional
opinion and a personal one.  I make decisions, the consequences of
which I won't enjoy, but which I know will benefit my employers.

I'm sorry I ever mentioned cat.  cat -n is the classic example of a
feature which unnecessarily complicates a tool.  My postings are not a
critique of cat.

_Obviously_, GNU aims to be compatible with BSD and POSIX, and so it
must have cat -n as well as lots of other lunacy.  However, GNU is
compounding the problem by adding lots of _new_ features as well.

I get the same experience for the binding of tcl to Motif that I did:
the short code, the quick development cycle, etc, come from using tcl,
not from Tk. I have dropped a 7000 line C/Motif program down to 700
lines of tclMotif. Not a bad saving! [tclMotif is on ftp.x.org under
/contrib/tclMotif*.Z]

Yes, this is a bug I introduced in pl13s.  It should affect only the new
">16M" LANCE driver -- the other drivers are started after time_init() in
main.c as they used to be.  The autoIRQ code assumes that "jiffies" are
ticking, and goes into an infinite loop when they are not.

A work-around is to explicitly specify the LANCE IRQ so that the autoIRQ code
isn't run.  You can do that with a boot time parameter -- see the ethernet
HowTo for details.

A source code fix is to use my new autoIRQ code on
ftp.super.org:/pub/linux/pl14/auto_irq.c
which changes a '>=' to a '>' so that zero timeouts don't depend on jiffies.
(This change in my private version is why I didn't notice the problem.)

The right fix is for me to actually write my planned autoIRQ code, which
reads the 8259 IRR and timer directly instead of installing interrupt handlers
and spinning on 'jiffies'.

I have DEC's Terminals and Printers handbook from 1987 in front of me.
According to it,

     CSI Ps ; ... Ps m

is `select graphic rendition' (SGR).  For `0' as a parameter, it simply says
``All attributes off''.  I can see that foreground/background color can be
considered an attribute; however, were colors considered when the standard was
introduced?

Perhaps, but I wonder how many problems one would encounter if the
interpretation of just this particular escape sequence were changed.

The reason I am wondering about this issue is because I the next version
(0.94-3) of my JED editor will support colors on Linux (default being white on
blue).  I would like to restore the forground/background colors when the
editor is exited or suspended.  I found an ESC sequence that does not touch
the colors but the termcap entry for console is not consistent with this
escape sequence.  This is the root of `less' messing up the color of the
display when viewing man pages.
