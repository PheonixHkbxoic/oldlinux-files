                 Welcome to the comp.os.linux.* hierarchy!

Background
=========================================================================
        This posting is an introduction to the comp.os.linux.* hierarchy 
        of USENET newsgroups. 

        Linux is a free implementation of UNIX for 80386/80486 machines 
        covered by the GNU GPL. Most of the development of the Linux 
        kernel has been done by Linus Torvalds, an internationally 
        reknowned UNIX wizard from Helsinki, Finland.

        For the past two years or so, the newsgroup comp.os.linux has 
        grown be one of the most popular groups on USENET. Late in 1992, 
        a CFV for splitting comp.os.linux was posted; the only group which 
        passed was comp.os.linux.announce, a moderated newsgroup for Linux 
        announcements and patches.

        Six months later, during the summer of 1993, another CFV for 
        splitting comp.os.linux was posted. The voting period for the 
        comp.os.linux reorganization results ended at 23:59:59 UTC on 
        4 August 1993 (4:59PM US Pacific Time, 7:59PM US Eastern Time.) 
        The results are as follows:

        comp.os.linux reorganization results - 1842 votes

         Yes   No  : 2/3? >100? : Pass? : Group
         ---- ---- : ---- ----- : ----- : -------------------------------
         1692  135 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.admin
         1741   90 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.development
         1647  177 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.help
         1660  155 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.misc


        Because of this split, the newsgroup comp.os.linux will be 
        deleted on 11 November 1993. The new newsgroups will be created 
        on 11 August 1993. This posting describes these newsgroups, 
        including comp.os.linux.announce, which will remain entact.


General Policy
=========================================================================
        The general policy for the Linux newsgroups is simple. Who sets
        the policy? We all do. All of us on USENET are interested in
        communicating openly about a number of topics. That's why we
        have USENET. If you want the Linux newsgroups to work for you,
        a few suggestions:

        * Read the Linux FAQ and follow the newsgroups for some time 
          before posting questions. This is very important. comp.os.linux 
          suffered from HUGE amounts of noise and traffic because much 
          of the growing readership never bothered to READ the newsgroup;
          they only posted questions.
          
          The same thing will happen with the new newsgroups unless you 
          read the FAQ (found on sunsite.unc.edu in the file 
          pub/Linux/docs/FAQ) and read the newsgroup for some time before 
          posting questions. Chances are, your question has already been
          recently answered, and a simple browsing of the newsgroup
          will answer it. We suggest using a threaded newsreader such as
          "trn" which will allow you to browse and mark articles by 
          subject, so you don't have to read each and every article in
          each newsgroup.

        * Crossposting between the Linux newsgroups is STRONGLY 
          discouraged. If you do crosspost questions between Linux 
          newsgroups, expect to be flamed to oblivion. The reason we
          have a newsgroup split is to categorize discussions into 
          separate newsgroups. Crossposting negates this effect. 
          If your posting cannot fit into ONE of the newsgroups
          c.o.l.admin, c.o.l.help, or c.o.l.development, then you 
          should post it to c.o.l.misc. 

          The one exception is for announcements. Occasionally, an
          important announcement (such as this one) will be crossposted
          between c.o.l.announce and one or more of the other c.o.l.*
          groups. These announcements must be approved by the .announce
          moderator; see below.

        * Reply to questions via e-mail if at all possible. While 
          discussion in the newsgroups is encouraged, if someone is
          asking a simple question to which the answer is well-known,
          there is no reason to post the reply. Don't assume that 
          the person posting the question actually reads the newsgroup
          or will even note your followup if they do. Reply via e-mail
          unless the reply is of general interest. 

        * Don't flame newbies. Over the course of the past few months,
          the Linux community has developed an oversensitive ego and
          a reputation for being unfriendly towards newcomers, mostly
          because of unwarranted flaming by a handful of righteous 
          individuals. If someone posts, saying, "Hi! I'm new to
          this group! What is Linux?" (which will inevitably happen
          as the new newsgroups are propagated), DO NOT FLAME THEM.
          When someone sees a new newsgroup pop up within "rn", they
          are justifiably curious about the new group and probably
          don't know that well over 80,000 people who know EVERYTHING
          about Linux read the group. Right? 

          Instead of being rude, you can send a polite note to the
          poster, saying, "Hello, Linux is a free implementation of
          UNIX for the 386 and 486. You can get the FAQ from 
          sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/docs. Let me know if I can
          be of help!". That's all. Not difficult, eh? You can even
          save your stock reply in a file and simply send form-letters
          to newbies if you wish. But there is very little point in
          flaming or ever being rude. It goes against everything that
          Linux can and should be. 

          Just remember that nobody knows everything---not even Linus---
          and that you were a newbie once, too. :)


comp.os.linux.announce
=========================================================================
        Comp.os.linux.announce is a moderated newsgroup for Linux 
        announcements and source patches. The purpose of this group was
        to get all of the ``important'' Linux information out of the
        regular newsgroup and into a place where all Linux users could see
        the important announcements without having to wade through a 
        jungle of other postings. So far, this group has been very 
        successful. 

        The moderators for this group are myself (Matt Welsh, 
        mdw@sunsite.unc.edu) and Lars Wirzenius (wirzeniu@cc.helsinki.fi). 
        We will be sharing the moderator duty, and backing each other up 
        to make sure that postings to this group will be approved as soon 
        as possible after they're submitted.

        Submissions to this group should be mailed to the address:
                linux-announce@tc.cornell.edu

        If you have any problems or questions about c.o.l.announce, please 
        send mail to the moderators at
                linux-announce-request@tc.cornell.edu
        Or simply mail us directly. This is not a request address for 
        mailing list subscription; see below.

        A separate posting details the guidelines for submitting to this 
        group.  I plan to approve just about anything that's posted to this 
        group, except for questions or discussions about Linux. So, please, 
        post away.  :)

        There are also archives of comp.os.linux.announce available at a 
        number of Linux FTP sites: check 
                sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/linux-announce.archive

        There is a mailing list mirror of the comp.os.linux.announce 
        newsgroup; to join, send mail to
                linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi
        With the line
                X-Mn-Admin: join ANNOUNCE
        at the top of the body (not in the subject). Approved postings to 
        c.o.l.announce will automatically be mailed to this mailing list 
        channel.


comp.os.linux.admin     
=========================================================================
        This newsgroup was created simply to thwart the unique newsgroup
        acronym "c.o.l.a", previously used by c.o.l.announce. However,
        this newsgroup is also used for discussions and questions about
        running Linux systems, either in a single-user or multi-user
        environment.

        Clearly, there is no large distinction between c.o.l.admin and
        c.o.l.help. However, .admin should be mostly used for discussions
        about RUNNING Linux, not USING or PROGRAMMING it. Unfortunately,
        especially with Linux, the line between system administrator and
        system user is very fuzzy. In short, we anticipate c.o.l.admin
        to be mostly about questions with installing, setting up, and
        configuring Linux systems, as well as other discussions relating
        to system administration. 


comp.os.linux.development
=========================================================================
        c.o.l.development, or "c.o.l.d" for short, is a newsgroup for 
        questions and discussions about Linux kernel and systems-level 
        development. Please note that this is a newsgroup about 
        development OF Linux, not development FOR Linux. In other words, 
        c.o.l.d isn't for questions about programming or porting software 
        to Linux. Instead, this is a newsgroup for discussions about 
        developing the Linux kernel itself, including writing device 
        drivers, adding new features, and so on. In addition, discussions
        about development of shared libraries, and other essential 
        systems-level projects, are welcome here. 

        Hopefully, this newsgroup will embody some of the content and
        scope of the linux-activists mailing list channels such as GCC, 
        KERNEL, SCSI, and NET.


comp.os.linux.help
=========================================================================
        Comp.os.linux.help is perhaps the most general of Linux 
        newsgroups. It is for any general user, programming, or 
        setup questions and discussion about Linux. If your question
        is about Linux development, post to c.o.l.development. If
        it is about system administration, post to c.o.l.admin. 
        However, if your question is of a more general nature, such
        as "How do I set up Linux for use with an NE2000 card?",
        c.o.l.help is your place. 

        Remember that you should not crosspost between .help and
        other Linux newsgroups. This means that if you are asking for
        help in .development, that's fine, but .help is for those
        questions which don't fit into .admin and .development.


comp.os.linux.misc
=========================================================================
        This group is the canonical ``catch-all'' for discussions and 
        questions which don't fit into the other Linux newsgroups.
        While c.o.l.help is generally for questions, c.o.l.misc is for
        discussions of a general nature about Linux, such as setting up
        a file hierarchy standard, questions about Linus' personal life
        and virtual beer, and the inevitable flame war. Again, it should 
        be noted that crossposting between c.o.l.misc and other Linux 
        newsgroups is strongly discouraged. If your posting or question 
        does not fit into ONLY ONE of the other Linux newsgroups, post 
        it to .misc.


Comments
=========================================================================
        If you have questions or comments about this document, please
        direct them to mdw@sunsite.unc.edu. Flames to /dev/null; cheques
        and money orders to Linus Torvalds. Thanks.

A few things..

1: You have to make your modem answer the line..
  Eg Set ATS0=1

2: init should be the only program to invoke mdm
   So.. if your running a BSDish init, you add this to your inittab

ttyS1:vt100:/etc/modem ttyS1 2400

(Note.. the 2400 line is not used.. but it needs it anyway..
it's traditional for gettys)

Subject: 99.13 kernel buffer usage ?
Date: 17 Nov 1993 20:03:57 -0700

Recently, I downloaded & installed the stock 99.13 kernel from tsx-11.
Running TOP under this kernal while loading the system, I note that
buffer space grows to a maximum of ~11,600k on my 16mb system.  Once
it does this, however, the buffer space never deallocates for use by
other processes.  

Just last night I did a test case where I:
  compiled a kernel
  backed up my /usr partion to a tar.gz file
  etc.

Checking TOP after this confirmed that ~12,000 k was used in buffer
space. 

I then did a couple of 'sync's, and let the system sit for 10 minutes.
After the wait, I whipped up a quicky test which alloced 12mb of space in
512k chunks, and alternately filled them with random data and memcpy'd
them about.  

Monitoring the system while this was running showed that the buffer
space never fell below 11,600k.  Instead, my program (for the first
time in a while :) ran mostly in swap.

Can anyone give me apointer why this might be so ?

My system is a 486dx/50mhz (not clock doubled) eisa/vlb 16mb ram 14 mb
swap with an adaptec 1542, wd ethernet, and Gravis soundcard.

Thanks,
-- Pat

ps.  I'm not (yet) a kernel hacker.  This is from lack of time, not
lack of ambition or skill. :( Ie - hints about areas to look at aren't
a loss, just slowly responded to.

Why? To build installation disks from another distribution when the first
worked very poorly.  I got so D'ned tired of waiting for disks to build
that I almost spent the time to rewrite it.  I _think_ the problem is that
it writes a sector at a time instead of a track; at least, stuff that I
have written in the past that wrote a track at a time seemed much faster.

It's already been done.  It's transparent of the physical layer of the network
(although Linux doesn't have drivers for cards other than ethernet).  It uses
tcp/ip, I think.  It's called radio and it was in one of the comp.sources
groups a long time ago.  I've seen it demoed on both NeXTstations and Sun
Sparcstations.  It works great.  I think you're basic error here is that you
think real time bi-directional voice takes more processor time and network
bandwidth than it actually does.  You'd only need a sample rate of about 11khz
tops, for decent quality voice.  If you used the new mpeg audio compression 
scheme you could probably make it work with CD quality sound too.

The bottomline is that if you're hardwired it's workable, feasible, and there's
code out there.  If you want to do it over a modem... wait a bit people are
working on it.  But neither unix nor ethernet, nor the sound hardware itself
hold the machine back from this capability in theory or in practice.

[ Article crossposted from comp.os.linux.help ]
[ Author was engels@darkstar ]
[ Posted on 18 Nov 1993 08:15:06 GMT ]

I tried to compile xvtdl5.0 with gcc using Linux (Slackware 1.10). I
could solve some problems concerning the compilation, but now I can't
solve a linking problem (I'm relatively new to Linux and gcc).

The linker doesn't find the libraries libl and libintl. If I remove 
these libraries from the gcc-line, the linker can't find _compile and
_step. The lines in the C-source seems to be

(void) compile(regex_str, regex_buf, &regex_buf[MAXPATHLEN], '\0')

and 

step(s, regex_buf) 

s is a char* and step is defined as int.

So my question is: where can I find these libraries or are these functions
in other libraries ?

Btw: the compiler couldn't find regexp.h, so I replaced it with regex.h.
Maybe that's a clue.

Btw2: I know that I can find xvtdl at sunsite, but I got a segmentation 
fault with that version.

Thanks for any hints

Indeed; I have a (rather over-expanded) A500 at home.

I also have a 486dx2/66 running Linux.


The Amiga KERNEL (not the DOS part) is a beautiful mix of assembler and
C and heaven knows what else, providing the sorts of facilities that
microkernel nuts drool over: the shared libraries (of which the
executive is one), user level tasks, (sort of) lightweight processes,
communication between processes is done via a *fast* message-passing
technique utilising shared memory, etc...

I've hacked thru it with a disassembler. It's really nice.

Until you realise that there's no real concept of "user space" and
"system space" - no nasty context-switch driven boundary between the
user's programs and the kernel data space. No "sensible" and
transparent memory protection.  That's why it can go so fast.

It's also why any user level program can take out the entire system.
It's a fast microkernel, 'cos there is no memory protection.


In any OS design where you have to create "walls" around your progams,
operating systems where you have to protect the hardware ports and
kernel memory for security's sake, given a choice between between
monolithic and microkernel, you have to select for your needs:

Monoliths are fast, with strong boundaries between dodgy user programs
and your "perfect" kernel code. They're hard to extend on the fly.

Microkernels are flexible and easy to extend into user space, but if
you still wish to implement the distinction between user and kernel
code, you're stuck copying stuff back and forth across a notional
boundary. Part of the hassle can be alleviated by using a 3-tier system
like Solaris, but not all of it.

Both suffer from bloat - at least with monoliths, a clever programmer
can reuse the code. Microkernel bloat comes from having too many
modules needed to achieve a single end, eg: in a protocol stack.

If you want to pass a message from a->z in a microkernel, you'll do:

        a->bcd->ef->ghi->j->klmn->opqrstuv->wxy->z

- needing all of the intermediate modules to achieve this end. The
equivalent monolithic driver goes:

        a->z

- admittedly, if ever you want to intercept your microkernel message to
implement a NEW protocol stack, you can reuse a lot of the modules:

        a->bcd->ef->ghi->j->klmn->ABCD->Z

- whereas the monolithic programmer must add another driver:

        a->Z

Which is better? Don't ask me... it's a matter of whether you really
*need* the flexibility of a microkernel architecture, and all of those
nifty hooks it gives you, or whether you will just want something that
runs your applications, fast. 

In some cases of the latter instance, even DOS will suffice.

Make your own choice.

Subject: 8-bit EMS as Linux swap space?
Date: 18 Nov 1993 08:32:53 GMT

Ok, I have a (very old) 8-bit EMS card w/ 2mb of ram on it (too slow to 
put in anything else, besides, I have nothing to put it in).  What I 
would like to do is configure it as a ramdisk (instead of the standard 
ramdisk that is part of linux and resides in main ram) and then make it 
the first swap space, supplemented by my hard disk (I have only 4mb of 
main system ram,and a slow hard disk so this would REALLY help)

I've programmed the thing directly under you-know-what to be a disk cache 
(yes, WITHOUT the help of EMS.SYS or equiv.) so that part of the picture 
is no prob for me...  My question is where in the kernel do i need to 
patch to allow this to happen and how hard a job would that be?

Also, if I make multiple swap drives, is the system smart enough that I 
can specify the order they are used in??

Thanks much for any info,
