Groan.

I thought it was already apparent from this thread that the people at NCSA
know what they are doing.  How do they manage that?  Because, instead of
trying to gain all wisdom on the net, they actually contacted OSF and asked
questions.  You know the technique: want the answer to a question -> ask.
Not speculate.

The license is a contractual document.  It's not particularly complex, as
such documents go, but interpreting it isn't in my sphere of expertise.
If you have a question about it, we recommend the following steps:

        1. Obtain one.  Read it.
        2. Formulate specific questions.  Call OSF.

What's particularly frustrating is that Marc and Eric actually took care to
abide by the license, and it's they who are being unjustly charged with
non-compliance.  Anything you get from them is legal.

Having said all that, our business management people have (as you know by
now) prepared an accessible summary of the license.  I'm sorry it has taken
so long; it is not easy to produce an accurate summary at the speed
demanded by the net (this whole thing started on November 17).  But it will
appear on the cited newsgroups Monday.

Remember, if you read the summary and still have questions, please, please
follow steps 1 and 2 above.  This is my first posting in this thread, and I
hope my last.

Why not take advantage of this info?  Since I don't have a manual for
my monitor, I used the tseng3.exe program distributed with SVGAlib to
get the register settings used by the drivers that came with my video
card.  Then, I configured SVGAlib to use those register settings and
used a modified version of vgaset to give me the timing values for
each SVGAlib mode.  Voila!  I was finally able to get 1024x768 to work in
non-interlaced mode.  This method probably won't work for anything
fancier than an ET4000-based card, but then people with fancier
equipment probably have manuals too.

None of which has anything to do with the Motif toolkit.

I don't resent paying for software, but I *do* resent paying outrageous
amounts of money for software.  It costs *thousands* to get Motif sources,
and *thousands* to keep up-to-date with them.  It also costs hundreds to buy
someone's pre-built stuff, which always has stupidity hardwired into it,
like expecting to live in /usr/lib/X11.

You'll at least have to add a flag to the header of the file, which
means changing the format of any storage program, which might be o.k.
for cpio and tar, but maybe not dd. I do like the idea of the filter
being separate, but they would need to be released as a suite, so

Personal choice. I'd stick that one up to a poll.

Ahhh. I thought perhaps a cool controller would send a specific

I have seen a few A/D board that had large caches, specifically so you
can just dump it once and a while, as cpu time permits. Then it's just
a matter of making sure the dumps are atomic, so you can stop slowing
down the card. The card itself would apparently switch to another
bank, or maybe do a trailing edge write vs. a leading edge dump. In
either case, not having continuous access can be dealt with. However,
having more direct access to the card can mean smaller caches needed,
thus reducing cost, and maybe larger dumps because of less overhead.

Tell that to Frame, which apparently maintains disjoint source trees for

Sigh.  IT'S A BLOODY WINDOW MANAGER.  Does EVERYTHING have to cover half
my display with pseudo-3D art-deco borders?

If I *ever* find the guy who introduced this misuse of "GUI" ...

How can pseudo-3D art-deco borders around everything POSSIBLY make an
application easier to use?  A button is a button, regardless of what stupid
decorations are around it.  In fact, the Motif toolkit can make an application
*harder* to use because the stupid borders swell the window size so much
that your windows end up obscuring each other more.

Mechanism, not policy.  Write a style guide if you want, but this is in no
way an inherent quality of the toolkit.  I see motif programs with buttons
(ximagemagic) and motif programs with menus (frame).

>If you take a look on xfig, you can see an application, which is
>not intuitive to use at all.

Agreed, although it's a lot better than it used to be.  Fault the author,
not the tools.

>There are no selection tools

What's a "selection tool"?

>The are e.g. Open Look Application Style Guidelines, that describe the concepts to
>follow when building an application.

They would appear to state that menu buttons work oppositely from the entire
reset of the world, and that applications not have a quit button.

>the same on _all_ GUI's including MS-Windows, Macintosh, Openlook and Motif

None of those is a GUI because nothing can *be* a GUI.  You mention a
window system, a window system/OS merge, a specification, and a toolkit + window
manager, respectively.

Gee, I've gotten lots of work done with Athena & Xt clients for years.  Xmeter
isn't hampered by not wasting half its area on shading; nor would that shading
help xpostit, xcalc, xkal, dclock, xpostage, or xterm.

Like the apparently-undocumented feature of having to define a symbol called
STRINGS_ALIGNED to get it to work on Sun 4's.

I'd say that cost and quality are just plain orthogonal.  Strictly speaking,
Sun's OpenWindows is commercial, yet lacks the working imake that X11 from
MIT gives you for free.  Sun's rpc.mountd dumps core if the domainname is
null.

Which you can get with some free stuff, but certainly not all.  I've never
had much luck at all with commercial vendors.

Unless you're a mega-mega-customer.  I've never been one.

It varies.  The authors of gnu emacs and microemacs, for example, are
respectively fickle and downright unresponsive.  The authors of "pixmap",
though, have been responsive to me.

One of things that bothers me about both 386BSD and Linux is that there appear
to be a near infinite number of variations, and nobody will so much as
explain what "SLS" is supposed to mean.

I've been hoping for this for years, but it hasn't happened yet.  I'm sure
that the existence of one would spur the OSF to make incompatible changes
more often, like the existence of third-party memory vendors has apparently
spurred Sun to make every new machine take unique memory.

This is one problem, but not the one that 'verify_area()' tries to
handle.  In order to avoid problems like the above, you simply have to
compy the stuff to kernel memory before using it: interrupts and device
drivers may never use user-memory directly. 

>As far, as I know, 386 chips even have problems of reporting

But THIS is the problem.  The i386 is "broken-by-design" (it's a
"feature" in intel-speak), and the verify_area() call is needed to check
that any area we are writing to isn't shared with some other process (on
a 386 this would otherwise change the memory of the other process as
well, as the paging unit doesn't work correctly). 

>In other words: don't produce page faults in the kernel.  Therefore,

No, 'verify_area()' doesn't try to swap anything in: it just check the
present pages and makes sure they are writable.  It also does some very
minor range-checking (makes sure that the address given is in the user
space area)

Note that with the newer ALPHA-kernels, linux checks at startup if the
processor can correctly handle the WP bit (you should see a message like
"This processor honours the WP bit even while in supervisor mode.  Good"
at startup).  If the processor does this (ie a 486 or newer), most of
the verify_area() checks are never done.

After just spending several hours on getting Motif 1.2 to run on a sun386i with
SunOs 4.0.2, I'd have to say they did a *DAMN* good job.  99% of the code
compiled straight up.  And what didnt was covered by define's that were
CLEARLY explained in the README file accompanying the distribution.

To Everyone:

It's getting mighty annoying hearing people whine about "I dont need
pretty 3d borders"  If that's all you think Motif provides, you certainly
need a clue or 42.  Motif provides MANY MANY tools and widgets that just
arent available under the so called "standard" MIT toolkits.  Gimme a break
Athena was written expressly as an EXAMPLE toolkit so others would create it.
Motif is an *excellent* one.  If you dont like it, fine thats your right,
but stop bitching because NCSA decided to use it in software that YOU NEED
NOT USE!  There are 14 Other browsers out there gang, and if they dont
suffice right your own damn browser.

I applaud the efforts of Eric Bina and Marc Andreeson in producing Mosaic for
X, if I had been charged with the same task, I certainly would have chosen
Motif as well.

I feel much better now, (climbing off the soapbox).
