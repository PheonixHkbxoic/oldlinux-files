By the time you get done, you're going to have something that only
remotely resembles unix.  Many people may not care, but I suspect

I have similar problems with ftp to non unix systems. I tried the combinations 
of Clarkson University FTP and QVTNET on the DOS side, and FTP and XFTP 
on the linux side. I do not get a directory at all from any side in the 
combination of DOS/UNIX or UNIX/DOS server and client. FTP to other UNIX 
systems works without any problems. I use at present the kernel 0.99pl11 and 
net-2. With my previous system 0.99pl9 and the old network programs, I could 
make ftp transfers between DOS and UNIX.

Primarily ease of maintenance and ease of development. Small pieces of code
are assembler (eg tcp checksum, and bits of the IDE driver now). For most
things the difference is tiny if anything because gcc is a good compiler
and people like Linus seem to spend hours peering at the compiled output
from gcc fine tuning the code in C to give the best assembler!

It also means that Linux can be ported (eg the ongoing A3000 port).

I have both the parallel port sound driver, and the new pc speaker

(output only of course.)

Basically, If I got the sound patch to Xtank, would it work with these

Weeks at the least, months at the most.  That's as much as I can say
without talking to Ian himself.  It is NOT vaporware.

How's that for vague?  :)

Really, though, unless you want to wait a while you should go with something
else.  Keep track of the stuff you add so that when Debian comes out you can
just back up your local stuff and then reinstall it after you reinstall Debian.

Fine, but there are a lot of other things in /etc.

   Basicly I find it a bad idea. Users should not edit config-files

That's kind of elitist and exclusionary, isn't it?  If we're gonna
make just another Unix, only very low cost, why bother?  Why not make
it easier to use at the same time?

   Users without that knowledge should use spesific programs to

What program would you use to edit /etc/passwd?  /etc/bootptab?  /etc/inittab?

Nononono!  /config/passwd is used to *create* /etc/passwd.  And
anyway, if programs are using getpwent, then they don't even have to
know the format or name of /etc/passwd.

   By the time you get done, you're going to have something that only

   most would just as soon not see that.

Hackers can still edit /etc/* and ignore /config.

   And so would everybody else.  Not good for newbies at all, and even old
   unix hackers would have to relearn a bunch of stuff.

Nononono!  The only person who needs to write a program is someone
who's adding another type of configuration file to /config.  And, the
program can be written in any language, so long as it's executable.
Shell scripts, awk scripts, perl scripts, C programs, whatever.

Ordinary users can just edit the files in /config or run the config
program.

    This can't be true. Anything between an #ifdef and an #endif should
not be parsed if it's not defined. 
    According to A 12.5, in my K&Rv2, any text following an #ifdef that
evaluates zero is discarded. I quote: 
    "Text controlled by inactive arms of the conditional is ignored,
except for checking the nesting of conditionals" 
    Maybe strict_ansi has to be turned on.

  Are there any plans in making the floppy patches, for extra

I think this would be great.  I edit config.in by default, also; in fact,
I use my 'fast' machine to compile specific kernels for other machine(s).

It would be nice to

Subject: true device driver?
Date: Thu, 16 Sep 1993 17:48:51 GMT

We have some specialized cards that we have installed in our Linux
PCs. We've created the drivers and they work fine. Now the question
is this:

We're using user mode code to drive these cards, and not true
device drivers. Could somebody give me their subjective impressions
about how much faster they think converting this code into a device
driver code would make this? I realize that running this as a device
driver would let it bypass all operating system checks because it'll
run at privilege level zero. I'm not really looking to be bombarded
with statistics about x86 clock counts at one privilege level over
another, I know those already. I'm just trying to sound out the
subjective impressions of anybody who has done it this way: ie.
started out with user-mode code (using the /dev/port construct), and
then ported it over to a true device driver. I'm not even too 
concerned about whether the driver that you ported had the same
performance requirements that ours does, as I said, ours is working
fine as just user-mode code, we're just after a bit more speed.

What I'd like to know is what experiences others have gone through
when porting it into a true device driver? For example, were you
satisfied with the speed increase? Did the speed increase solve
any compatibility problems? Did it create any compatibility problems?
Did you feel the effort was worth it? Etc.

If you would have cared to read the rest of the article you would know
better. The meaning of these files are to construct the normal config
files (like /etc/passwd) from the /config ones. There are not much utilities
that _write_ to the config files. /etc/passwd is a notable exception,
and you have to replace those utilities _anyway_ if you decide to
go from normal to shadow passwords...
