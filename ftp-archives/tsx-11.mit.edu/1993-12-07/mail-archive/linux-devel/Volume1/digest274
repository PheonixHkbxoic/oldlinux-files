This shortsightedness means that you end up writing multi-volume support 
for tar and writing it _again_ for cpio. Duplicate. Duplicate. Bad. Bad.

You have to extend tar. Fine. It wasn't perfect. Why don't you think for
a few minutes and come up with a flexible extension that _lets_ you keep
multi-volume support in a separate program?

Give tar an option to print, on whichever file descriptor, a sequence of
numbers saying where the file should be split. Give your file splitter a
way to understand this sequence. Poof, problem solved.

UNIX makes it so easy to avoid writing the same code again and again and
again. Why don't you take advantage of that?

Morning all,

    I'm relatively new to this group, and have a couple of questions:

    Does anyone know if drivers for any of the following exists for
    linux:

    Ethernet: CNet CN300E 16 bit ethernet controller
    SCSI:     COMPRO LaseMate SCSI interface

    The latter is a part of a lasewave soundcard, Soundblaster
    compatible and the sound-drivers detect it sucessfully, but
    the SCSI inteface is not detected.

    Thanks in advance for any help.

that is close, then manually edit the Xconfig removing all unwanted lines and
tweak for 'best fit'. 

It took 10 mins of work on mine, and never took more than 15 on any of them.

Mine has been running fine for weeks now. (TTX (CMS/CTX) 14" monitor)
It's been proven fine for NEC, AAMAZING, as well as Compaq and Mitsubishi's

I will continue to use it and offer to set friend's systems up with it.

You should really look into using wbuild 2.0 to create the widgets
for NOTIF.  The widgets come out of it self-documenting, and it
creates all the unreadable boilerplate C code for you.  It can
be gotten from the FWF at a.cs.uiuc.edu:/pub/FWF.

Highly recommended.

Good luck, Paul!

If some of the effort which was invested in writing articles for the
'Don't use Motif...' threads had been spent for your project, you would
have the clone nearly finished :-)

You'll read your name here on the wall when it is running.

It seems that many people dislike Motif - ok, they should produce their
applications in the way they want, but is it really necessary for them
trying to prevent others from using Motif?

I think there are a lot of developers (like me) who want to use it on
commercial AND free systems being able to reuse their object classes and/or
knowledge. I think if it is possible to make a free clone of such software
it should be done.
Trying to set up a different 'free standard' is always a disadvantage
for people having to live with both, commercial and free systems.

Linux/386BSD are good examples how people can benefit from such clones.
(Of course, some guys prefer completely different free OSs, I'm lucky
not having to read 'Don't use Unix...' in the news every day.)

I'm not wondering any more that Microshaft can make $$$$$ - their
stuff leaves no such decisions to the developers!

Do you think that it's not necessary to have at least ONE standard GUI
development environment (whatever it is) available on EVERY Un*x/X system
for writing commercial AND free software?
Ok, then prepare to install Windoze-NT on your SPARCstation....

    The fee doesn't need to be paid twice - but it should be paid
    once which is what OSF is (fairly) after.

So,  OSF changed their licensing to try and get something closer to a  per

Why extraordinary - OSF want to be paid for anyone using their code.
Shared libraries are inherently multi use. Its reasonable that if you have or
want to distribute such a library you pay for its use for the system you're
installing it on.

This is totally bogus, M1.2 licensing started with M1.2.0 which predated COSE,
Sun/AT&T et al by at least a year.

Oh Really ? Did you got it RUNNING ? If so, I'd be HIGHLY interested in the
port of the /dev/nit or /dev/enetfilter for linux.

Sorry for the sarcasm. Until now I didn't see any way to get it ported to
Linux because it needs network devices that operates in promiscous mode,
i.e. that fetches all packets on the network and not only the packets addressed
to it. From what I've learned, Linux Network Code didn't support it yet.
And I'm not sure if it does it ever, since it is a hardware function and the
common cards didn't support this feature.
( I'm not sure of this; any corrections are greatly appreciated since it tried
to get the ethertools packages compiled; and failed until now ... )

Date: Tue, 30 Nov 1993 12:43:42 GMT

I know, sounds crazy, but I have several machines with different setups,
and it is a pain to have to hack lp.h and build separate kernels for each
one. (For example on one machine I have lp0 on irq 7, lp2 on irq5, but on
another I have lp1 on irq 7 and lp2 on irq12. And yes, it has to be that
way. It is also subject to change quite often when testing things.)

On a similar note, why is CONFIG_AUTO_IRQ (for the serial ports) not
available as an option at make config time? It seems I have to hack it
into serial.h, or am I missing something? Once I do, it works perfectly.

Any idea how to test if a 3c501 ethernet card exists at a given address?
Then one could scan a range of addresses like the other ethernet drivers
and not have to hardwire it to a particular setup. At the moment it simply
checks if the first 3 bytes of the prom are the ones 3com uses, and then
checks for the IRQ. This could cause havoc if another another board
existed at the adresses tested I should imagine.

Any ideas?

That is the problem in a nutshell.

So can we take it that the Hurd will have the same approach?  Try to
provide a superset of all the features found in POSIX, BSD, System V,
v7, and so on and so on and so on..?

No wonder it's been delayed.
