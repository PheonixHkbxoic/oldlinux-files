In the August 9th issue of LAN Times there is an advertisement from
Accton Technology Corporation.  They are advertising a special offer
(while supplies last) for their EN1651 MPX 16-bit AT bus ethernet
adapter.  You can purchase up to two of these adapters at the
evaluation price of just $29 each.

These ethernet adapters are NE2000 compatible (which means they'll
work under OS/2 just fine).  The offer is good in the United States
and Canada only.  Add $5 for shipping and handling.

This is a perfect way to set up your OS/2 workgroup -- a pair of these
adapters will cost only about $60.  Add IBM's TCP/IP for OS/2, the
NE2000 driver from ftp-os2.cdrom.com, and you've got a two station
small network.

To order, or for more information, call 800-926-9288 or 510-226-9800
or FAX 510-226-9833.  When you order, be sure to tell Accton you are
using their adapter with IBM OS/2 2.x.  (They can use that information
in future product planning.)

Looking for Token Ring?  In the same issue the Andrew Token Ring
Adapter Card is advertised at $199 (first card only).  It is a 16-bit
AT bus 16/4 adapter.  Offer ends September 30, 1993.  To order call
(800) 328-2696 ext. 372 in the United States.  Elsewhere call (708)
349-5440 or FAX (708) 349-5673.  In Europe (only) call (44) 734
894689.

You can still keep a DOS partition for games on your computer :-)
But for software development a Unix like environment is infinitly
easier. No 640K limit, no 64K segments, no destroyed FAT tables
after program crashs, memory mapped files etc.

Date: Fri, 13 Aug 1993 17:23:50 GMT

I have just made from scratch upgrade from SLS 1.02 to 1.03. All network
stuff worked well under 1.02. The SLS 1.03 was the latest version with
fixes at Aug.12 10 a.m., which included the fix for rc.net.
Nothing works now. One of the problems I
am getting at an unspecifed time is:

eth0: transmit timed out, TX status 0x3, ISR 0x17.
eth0: Possible IRQ conflict on IRQ5?
eth0: Resetting the 3C503 board... 0x708=0x0 0x706=0x2 0x705=0x49...done

As you see I have a 3c503 Etherlink II/16 card which is recognized 
during the initial boot. The connection is thin-net.
The computer is DELL 486P/50. I can telnet, ping and ftp to myself.

Subject: Does linux work with 1542c BIOS enabled?
Date: Fri, 13 Aug 1993 17:50:20 GMT


OK, I've read all the FAQs I can find, but....

Trying to boot with the a1 disk (both SLS1.02 and 1.03) gives me
the following:

aha1542_out failed(1) : Configuring Adaptec at IO:330, IRQ 10, DMA priority 7
aha1542_out failed(1) : aha1542.c : interrupt received, but no mail.
scsi0: Adaptec 1542
Adaptec 1542scsi : 1 hosts
aha1542.c : interrupt received, but no mail.


The BIOS is enabled with the >1Gbyte extension on (I've got the Maxtor 
P1-17S).

With the BIOS turned off, the boot disk recognizes the drive and CD-ROM,
boots OK, but fdisk reports overlapping start/end blocks of the partitions
on the hard drive - presumably because of the >1Gbyte extension formatting
which is turned off with the BIOS.

I've tried most, if not all, combinations of DMA/IRQ/IO port/1542c settings
to try to get the thing to boot with the BIOS on...

Is anyone using the 1542c with the BIOS enabled??  Any ideas???

Is there any reason to write the proposed Word Processor as a stand-alone
program.  I say this because, from what little I have seen of emacs, it seems
to be a very flexible basic editor with a lot of potential for expansion.

Perhaps it would be better to write the WP as a set of advanced functions for
emacs and interfaces between emacs and other packages, like teX and graphics
interace packages (curses, etc.)

Just a thought from a Linux newbie...

As for my experience, I can confirm that the system I run - the most
important applications are UUCP based mail/news and TeX - is
rock-solid.  Currently I have Linux 0.99.9 installed, but I'm using it
since 0.11 or so and never had stability problems. Once I got it to
run, it always kept running.

My advice on configuring a system is: Use only known good hardware,
i.e. check the compatibility list before purchase even if some may find
this over-careful. (I think it over-careful myself but if reliability
is the main concern...) IDE disks are best wrt. headache-less-ness
(and cheapest, btw.)
And use only known good software, i.e. the second-newest kernel
release after having scanned c.o.l. for the most frequently reported
problems.

I doubt this is the problem; it typically gets this failure once every 10
seconds or so, and I don't believe update accesses the disk that often.
Like I said before, while data is coming into the modem, no acknowledges
appear to go out (I am looking at the TX/RX leds).  Acknowledges are only
transmitted after the sender stops sending, presumably due to lack of
timely acknowledgements.

Recently I upgraded to the SLS 1.03 distribution, and noted that I have trouble
killing getty processes.

The situation that I have encountered is as follows:

        - I initiated a getty process, by re-initializing.

        - I then commented out the getty process in my inittab.

        - I then to attempt to "kill -9".

It seems that the problem is with the patch level 11 kernel.  HAs anyone else
expierenced this problem?

That's a major problem IMHO *because* it's so trivial. Code that uses
non-standard signals like SIGBUS should be braced by #ifdef's, in case
they are not defined. Unfortunately, SIGBUS has been around on Un*x
since version 7 and most people consider it standard (but it is not,
as far as I know, required by POSIX).

The quick fix: Append
#define SIGBUS 7
to /usr/include/linux/signal.h (before flaming me away now think about
the ratio of importance of such headaches while porting vs. the
unimportance of the fact that this does not match the kernel signal
generation) or add -DSIGBUS=7 to your compiler options.

Hello. I have just finished installing SLS version 1.03 which I got from
tsx-11.mit.edu. I must say that i have only one problem. My problem is:
I am missing little programs such as 'prompt' and 'hostname'. When I installed
SLS, I got no error messages as to what I was installing. All I would like to know is in which disk are these utilities kept (eg A2)
and in which file so I may get these programs. X-windows, TeX and everything else I installed worked fine. Oh, and one other question. What did the installationmean when it asked for a patch disk during the creation of the boot disk?
Thanks....

Subject: Re: Why would I want LINUX?
Date: 13 Aug 1993 18:52:52 GMT

A couple of good reasons:

1. I'm familiar with Un*x anyway, and I like the way things are done
with it. In fact, I think the Un*x simplicistic approach to OS
services provides an overall appearance that is superior to most other
OSs. This is a reason for Un*x in general.

2. I like to run several things at once, i.e. when I've started a long
compiler run I want to be able to switch to another window or console
and continue work on another thing. This is a reason against MSDOS,
since as far as I know all multi-tasking add-ons for it are brain-dead
and a gross waste of resources. (Yes, I know this from experience.)

3. I like the genuine GNU Emacs. It runs best on Un*x. (For the
record, back when I was using DOS I've got stuck to that wonderful
Freemacs even when the first version of GNU Emacs for DOS came out but
didn't work due to a collision with the memory manager. The next Emacs
that I tried was under Linux...)

4. I need to run mail and news, the software for which being available
for Un*x in a sufficient number of nice and stable versions.

5. I need a decent application development platform. Un*x combined
with powerful tools such as the abovementioned GNU Emacs and the
obligatory make, RCS et cetera provides IMHO the best that you can get
for less than megabucks. And GCC is surely one of the best compilers
out anyway.

6. I need to run TeX, and I've tried the DOS version compared to the
Linux version on the same box - the latter is *much* faster (esp.
metafont) and uses less space, so another good reason to abandon DOS.

7. I am neither able nor willing to spend big bucks on software when I
can get good material for less. :-) Especially not since Linux is
actually the best OS you can get for the 386 class of hardware, if you
consider things like speed, memory usage, availability of software,
even support (from friendly net.people etc.)

8. Finally, yes I have some experience with computers and are one of
the "fix-problems-myself" types. I'm not sure whether Linux fits well
to newbies (but Windogs doesn't either! Read the chapter in the manual
about memory management.) But installing and maintaining Linux for
others could make a good business :-) (and a "better", not in the $$$
sense, business than selling proprietary software that is obsolete as
shipped.) You see, I support the GNU idea.

Graphics work fine, and serial communications are good enough for a mouse,
depending on your mouse driver (some seem more finicky than others).
I think that some versions of Quicken need the "/k0" switch to work.

>Does the mouse function under DOSEMU?  Is the screen in color or B&W?  Can

If you use console or VGA mode, the screen is in color.

Make sure you have the latest version of dosemu (0.49).

>exec 3>&1 1>&2

This may be the problem statement. Here's a fix I got from Chet Ramey:

=============================================================================
I found it (we had fixed this a few months back, which is why it's not
reproducible in current development versions).  Your gdb guy was close,
but was looking at the wrong thing.  He is correct in that gdb manages
something differently from dbx, but that thing is file descriptors, not
memory.)

Bash uses file descriptor 3 for reading the script, because that's the
file descriptor returned by open.  When the Configure script uses the
`exec 3>&1' construct, the bash code doesn't know how to handle it,
because stdio doesn't allow swapping file descriptors associated with
FILEs.  Bash does ahead and does the dup2, duplicating fd 1 onto fd 3.
The stdio FILE still has file descriptor 3 associated with it,
and tries to read from it, which results in the script attempting to
read from stdout when it goes back for more of the script. 

I have appended a patch with code from the current development version
of 1.13 that fixes this.

sh and ksh have always done something like this with the script fd,
moving it to a file descriptor out of the user-accessible range (which
has traditionally been 0-9).  The bash problem is harder, since
Posix.2 says that all file descriptors are user-accessible (e.g.,
10>/dev/null redirects file descriptor 10, rather than file descriptor
0 as sh and ksh do).  There are no descriptors that are `off-limits'
to the user, so this patch adds a dup2 to getdtablesize() - 1 and hopes
for the best. 

The original 1.12 code worked in gdb because gdb uses fd 3 for its own
purposes, so it is open when bash is run, and therefore not used when
bash opens the script file.  (The file descriptor returned by the open
is 5, in my case.) This leaves file descriptor 3 free for use by the
`exec'.

    Why would you want to use something that slow (floppy) as the
root filesystem? Are you planning on making an install system for
some linux software? I`m not positive as to how LILO does it, but
when booting the a1, it says it's loading the ramdisk (I think)
Does anyone know if it is using the ramdisk as the root? It
doesn't look like it if you type "mount" or "df", but it acts
like it during the install.

First, the spec does not provide a way for a card to identity the kind of
device it is (modem, network, etc).  As far as I can tell, a generic enabler
just has to know the manfucaturer/product name for every device it wants to
support, so it can tell what driver to attach to it.  Alternatively, it could
make an educated guess based on the ports and memory ranges a card wants
mapped, but that seems like a rathole.

Second, not all cards adhere to the spec.  The AT&T Paradyne Keep In Touch
Modem, for example, does not work when a correct value is written to Config
Register 0 and the appropriate IO ports are mapped.  I don't know why, and
AT&T isn't being helpful.

This points to the third problem, which is that the PCMCIA Standards document
is not complete.  There seems to be a number of tuples that are not
documented.  Perhaps full members get that information, but I can't afford to
spend $1,000+ on it ($250 was already more than I should have had to pay).

Bravo! I'm new to Linux, but shortly I'll be buying a new
computer and would like to move up and out of the DOS world. I'm
considering Linux and, as ordinary writing (not typesetting) is
my main function, the availability of a near- or pure-WYSIWYG is
about #1 in my list of concerns. If moving to Linux means trying
to compose on something using EDLIN-style front-end-- even if
it's 'better'-- then I'll stay with WordStar on DOS.

However, if TeX is so great, why not have a couple or more
front-ends for it, one for ordinary writing, one for
spreadsheets, another for drawing, and others for communications,
database, typesetting, writing/editing source code and pics,
sound, video and whatever. If all such applications could write
to the same file, you would have the kind of true
interoperability most users are seeking in WindHose. (Of course,
this set of projects would require the source code to TeX; is it
PD-available? Like I said, I'm new here.)

I await your kind and informative responses.
