The only two method I am aware of for running X windows across a phone
line (which sounds like what you want. Presumably you want
applications you run to have windows on your screen?) are

        Slip: find a very fast modem, and a friendly sysadmin.
                I have neither.
        Term: This is a user-level program that does error
                correction/compression, and multiplexing across
                a serial line. One of the side effects is allowing you
                to run X across the line. You will want a fast modem.
                grab term from sunsite.unc.edu:/somewhere(??) or
                tartarus.uwa.edu.au:/pub/oreillym/term/term107.tar.gz

You may want to mention, that if you hit the reset button,it
willnot reset your ethernet board (if you have one)
you MUST power off. (go figa')

Hey guys.
I have 3 sco boxes and one linux box here at work.
They are both fine products, let's give the argument a break.

(however, I have to mention, that linux is what I can afford
to have at home :)

the above message was my machine's

figures, my machine couldn't sync, and my
ps -a | more came back with "No more processes"
e2fsck came back with "Nice Try"

Obviously I have a virus.
does anyone know what releases it is in?
I have SLS 1.0 (0.99 ker)
I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER SOFTWARE other than that I have
written myself so it had to come from my SLS release.
(which came from a bbs)
thanks folks.

Sending your credit card numbers through the mail is a bad idea, unless
you encrypt it with Jay's public DES key (so he can decrypt it with his
private key.  But I don't know if he has a key, so it's probably a moot
point).

The reason is that a mail route often involves some uucp store-and-forward
portion.  While your message is stored, it is potentially accessible by
others.  Not something you'd want to entrust your credit card number with.

It's probably a bad idea to send your credit card number anyway, unless
you encrypt it with Jana's public key first (again, they probably don't
have one, so the short answer is: don't bother.  Use the phone instead).

Subject: Missing function IPPROTO_TCP in latest p12 kernal ???
Date: Sat, 21 Aug 1993 08:26:41 GMT

After upgrading to the latest SLS with the latest p12 kernal from
the p12A, I encounter some problems in compiling programs including
some TCP code.
 
I got the termftp.tar.Z from sunsite and got a working binary with
the p12A source, however, latest p12 source won't finish the compilation.
Sorry I have forget the exect function code, but the it ends with some
undeclare functions.

The other program that is nntplink3.1.0.tar.gz got from cs.columbia.edu,
the program ends at tcpconn.c with a undeclare function of IPPROTO_TCP,
however with p12A source I don't see the complain and got a final working
binary. 

I'm sure it is the source problem 'cause I have tried to use p12 source with
lib441 and lib442 , no matter how I switch the lib and inc files,
the compilation only works with the p12A source code.

I hope I am not doing any thing wrong here, I only want to get a working
source for my C.

Subject: Lilo and OS/2, help!
Date: 21 Aug 93 09:02:22 GMT

I installed SLS on a logical drive (/dev/hda6). OS/2 bootmanager is on
/dev/hda2. I could not boot from hard drive. After I chose "linux" from
bootmanager's boot menu, only "LIL." appeared and the PC hang. Could someone
post a simple instruction (step by step if possible). I couldn't find it in
Linux-faq and Lilo-faq. I used to boot linux from boot manager via shoelace.
Thanks.
PS I changed partition's ID to "Linux Ext", that is my linux's root partition.

SO far the winner in our evaluation appears to be the new PC Xware from 
NCD. Get the XREMOTE option in order to run it over a modem. You
can use the window manager on the Unix machine (say OpenLook),
use Microsoft Windows as your window manager, or use the NCD window 
manager. This program runs under Windows. The NCD window manager has selectable 
Motif or Windows look/feel. It allows focus to follow the mouse pointer.
There is a phone directory and the ability to store modem setups for
calling different locations. It also has VT320 terminal emulation for the initial
login.

Other programs are Humiingbird's eXceed/Xpress and eXodeus (White Pines Software)
with the XREMOTE option.

X-windows is great. We use ZyXELs at 19200. They work well. Turn off error
correction for best performance.
