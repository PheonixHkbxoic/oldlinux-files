Please, not here!  This thread generated enough noise on comp.sys.intel,
why are you trying to start more flame wars about ibm vs mac?  My site
does not have the new newsgroups yet, so I still have to wade through

First, a little background:

Just about every piece of Linux documentation I have ever read (most
of it, including the new guides) such as The Linux FAQ and The
INFO-SHEET mentions SLS again and again.  So, the first time I
installed Linux, I went with SLS 1.02 (note: I haven't installed X
because I don't need it).

SLS was buggy, and I mailed Peter MacDonald a number of bug reports
concerning: file permissions, binary repeats, missing descriptions in
the install procedure, old versions of gzip, tar, emacs, everything.
I don't know what the effect of mailing them all since I never heard
back, but when 1.03 came out all of these problems were supposedly
fixed and when I helped a friend install with 1.03 it was the same
thing as before . . . buggy, cryptic installation, lousy
documentation, I could go on for hours, but I'll spare you (I'm
certain you've all seen the amount of posts on c.o.l. about bugs and
SLS 1.03).

Anyway, next time when I re-installed (to update gcc and libc) (with
1.03), there was a problem and it would not work for some reason.  So,
I decided to try out MCC.

For people who have tired of this long post I'll make it plain and
simple so you can go on.

** MCC is a wonderful installation package. **

MCC makes sense, it really does.  Let's compare SLS and MCC a little:

task/item       SLS 1.03                MCC 0.99-p10+
========================================================================
breakdown of    by disk (i.e. a1-4,     by package (user puts files
installation    b1-7, each composed     on disks in similar manner
files           of tgz files having     to SLS, but each tgz file is
                unrelated files put     a package like emacs, or gcc.)
                together.)

documentation   a 2 page faq            a formated (TeX, dvi, ps, ascii)
                a sheet on DOWNLOADING  installation guide that goes into
                several other pages     depth and covers _every_ aspect
                ownership of main FAQ   of installation and starting
                (no extra information   up a Linux system.
                there though...)

ownership of    yes                     no
the main Linux  there were 66 lines     there were only 15
FAQ             with "SLS" appearing

                note: does this really
                belong in the main
                FAQ when it is in
                the install docs?

installation    read the documentation  in addition to the documentation,
procedure       and sparse comments     this is a dummy-proof and mistake-
                not totally automated,  proof procedure that asks before
                but almost there in     it does and confirms along the
                the new version.        way as you install with LONG
                                        paragraph-sized comments.

size in disks   (A through C which      8 disks (this is including the
                corresponds to MCC)     extra packages)
                14 disks

time & speed    2 to 2.5 hours          1 to 1.5 hours
(after putting
it on disk)

popularity      undeserving, the        low, but higher among more
                de-facto standard???    experienced users.

who makes it?   Softlanding Software    Manchester Computing Center (sp?)

age of          old.  Emacs-18.59       new.  Emacs-19.15
software        gzip 1.0.x              gzip 1.2.3
                old tar 1.1             recent on just about everything

========================================================================

I'll put it like this, if you have any amount of experience with Unix
or even a good amount of experience with computers in general, use the
MCC installation, it is a blessing.  If you don't and you feel that
you can do SLS easier, install it, play with Linux for a week or two,
and THEN install MCC.  You'll be happier if you do.

Please don't flame me.  I've installed Linux a (small) number of times
on several systems and I doubt that I'll touch SLS again.

I truly wish that the Linux community would give the MCC-interim
package the spotlight that it deserves (and perhaps a piece of the FAQ
the size of SLS's chunk!).

The only drawback to using MCC is that it lacks a X-windows
installation.  If you doubt that you can handle installing X on your
own, maybe SLS is for you.  Then again, maybe not.

X-Disclaimer: All views are my own unless expicitly stated otherwise.

There seems to be an inconcistency in the sls disk b7.
At 10 aug a file zbfix.tgz was added to disk b7. The file diskb7 in not
updated. the zbfix file should probably contain the fix for the problem in
rc.net but it contains an empty rc.net file.
I got my distribution from a mirror site of TSX-11.

Subject: Linux Destroys 486 (?)
Date: 13 Aug 1993 07:45:25 GMT

Hello Folks,

I was trying to install Linux on my brother's Highscreen 486DX/33.
For weeks it didn't work until I changed some stuff in the setup
(disable some Cache and Shadowing).

Then the a1-disk booted and Linux worked fine.
Before installing the whole SLS Package I rebooted DOS to take a look
at the integrity of the Package disks.

Result: Nothing moved and the message "HDD controller failure" appeared.
I rebooted with a DOS 3.3 (never trust 4.0 and over) system disk.
Result: The same but also with "FDD controller failure"
I rebooted Linux.
Result: "FDD controller failure, HDD controller failure"

This State would not change despite the following attemps to repair it:

-Disable everything but A:-Floppy and reboot
-Load BIOS Defaults into CMOS setup
-Load Power-On Deafaults into CMOS setup
-Reset CMOS by short-circuiting it and Load Defaults
-Press down numeric "0" at bootup (AMI-BIOS-Feature)

What did work, was the controller, when I built it into another
Computer (286/10).

Does anybody have similar experience with problems like that ?

Some technical Data:  486DX/33 by Vobis Highscreen, AMI-BIOS, 4MB RAM
                      purchased October 92, Worked alright so far

Subject: Emacs-19.17 under SLS 1.02
Date: 12 Aug 1993 23:34:22 GMT

Compiling Emacs-19.17 worked all right for me, after one of two modifications:
        1) compiling libipc (the "delta" version--isn't that out of date
           for kernel .99pl9, which came w/ SLS 1.02??)    --or--
        2) telling emacsclient.c and emacsserver.c to use the socket routines
           rather than the libipc routines (changed a #if defined...) and
           telling make not to link libipc at all...

Either of these two methods produced the same result:

1) ran fine from the shell w/o X running, but

2) running it from X hard locked the entire system (no kbd response, no mouse
motion, no switching terminals, killing the X server, switching video modes,
nothing--BRS).  Nasty.

Any ideas?  I thought it would be the libipc routines until not linking them
produced the exact same result...

BTW, kernel .99pl9, X-Free 1.2.  (I've heard 1.3 is slower--what's the final
word?)

Any help or comments would be appreciated...  Would it be easier to just
move to SLS 1.03?  :)

At least part of the NFS server code was broken in pl10 and maybe pl11.
pl12A seems to work, as I've had my BSDI 1.0 system mounting the home
filesystems from my pl12A linux box for several days now with no
problems.  (Honestly I don't really know if the problem was fixed in
pl11.  I just noticed that it was fixed in pl12A.)

Subject: The Daily Posting - what to do with it ?
Date: Fri, 13 Aug 1993 00:37:27 GMT

Now that the group has split the daily posting I have been sending out
for the past n months needs reconsideration.

My position at the moment is as follows, but I'd like some feedback
here (comp.os.linux.misc) and discussion on this.  In the meantime
I've turned the daily off.

1. I don't expect that col.development and col.misc will need a daily.
I hope not, anyway.  If they do we can cross that bridge later.

2. col.help is almost certain to need one - pretty much along the same
lines as the current one, I should imagine.  Should I wait to see what
develops or start posting immediately ?

3. c.o.l probably needs a regular posting reminding people to switch
to the new groups.  Matt - are you handling that, or shall I crib from
your announcements in cola and add another line to my crontab ?

4. The Supersedes line.  About two weeks ago I stopped putting a
Supersedes line in the daily, as I got the impression that a
significant number of people were subscribing to c.o.l, reading the
first few (hundred!) articles in the backlog, and then giving up and
posting.  Many newsreaders (especially primitive ones which are more
likely to make them give up quickly) will show the articles
(more-or-less) in order, and thus they never see the daily.

Is this happening ?  If it is, is it worth the extra disk space (3K *
expiry time) and time skipping (if you don't have a killfile) ?

5. I really don't know what to do about col.admin.  I argued and voted
against it because I felt it was too ill-defined; unfortunately the
situation being what it was any group on the CFV was almost certain to
pass.

If someone can come up with a clear, short rule that I can write down
which a poster can use to determine whether col.misc, .admin or .help
is the right group I'd be interested to hear their ideas.

6. Remember that the daily has to be kept short.  It's already a bit
on the long side; I don't want to add more material - on the contrary,
I'd like to remove some.  I don't know what, though :-).

All comments and advice - here, or by email - gratefully received.

Followups redirected out of comp.os.linux - at last there is a
newsgroup where this discussion won't get swamped.

Greg,
    Thanks for the tip.  However, this combination of hardware works fine
