This sounds like the cards are being run at too high a bus frequency.
If you can alter your BIOS settings to slow down the bus it should go
away.  Many pc cards cannot run reliably at bus speeds over 8MHz
(AT-clock).

Followups redirected to comp.os.linux.help, although a hardware group
is more appropriate.

Upon execution of rc.net I get warning of "old style IOCTL called"
from /etc/config.  This is followed by messages about "nfsd cannot
register service. RPC unable to send; errno = Network unreachable".

I do NOT currently have any type of ethernet board installed, but would
like to have the tcp/ip services available so that I can work on some
socket code.  I've upgraded a SLS distribution to PL10.  Any attempt to
use telnet/ping/ftp/etc results in "network unreachable".

Any kind sole have some ideas for me?  I'd sure appreciate someone telling

serious socket development?  I didn't see network-dev-support tools anywhere

Date: 15 Aug 1993 13:47:17 GMT

Now that I know how to get kermit to use zmodem (thanks for
the hint), the only other thing kermit needs is the ability
to look like a vt100 terminal when in the connect mode. The keys
in kermit are transparent by default. I have tried setting up
my console as vt100 before entering kermit, but that doesn't affect
the keys that are sent out. The set character-set command doesn't
have a choice vt100, and the dec-international key set doesn't
look like a vt100 terminal at the other end.

Is there any way that the cursor keys on my keyboard can
appear as vt100 terminals at the other end?

Thanks.

The current Linux parallel driver knows how to use the interrupt, but it has
to be enabled.  You need to get the lpirq package to enable it, or write your
own program to use the LPSETIRQ ioctl.

Not in this case, the tape number bounces around too much and you have to know
the entire sequence to figure which tape to use. I just marked the numbers in
on a calendar.

Not exactly my limits, since the scheme came from the AT&T dump manpage
(System III era).  But you are correct, it requires that everything fit on one
tape.

I do weekly full backups with GNU cpio.  GNU tar backups have one fatal flaw:
the owner and group are apparently encoded in ASCII and looked up in
/etc/passwd.  If you ever need to restore your system from a backup from a
bootable rootdisk, you lose your ownerships....  I didn't exactly get caught
there, but the last upgrade of my SLS-based system (I may switch to MCC next
time, since SLS remains un-upgradeable except by heroic measures) I restored a
tape of my local changes while running from the a1 disk... everything ended up
owned by root.  grrr....

I don't bother with dailies at present, since all I have time to do on a daily
bases is news and mail and neither needs to be backed up all that desperately.

Subject: Problems compiling Xboard 2.1 pl11

Hello, all.  I've been dutifully trying to compile xboard using the gcc2.3.3
compiler and have been experiencing difficulties.  Exciting output like the
following results:

It seems that there's a problem in that flex generates an input function and a
yyunput function, and parser.l contains its own versions of these functions
which get included in the parser.c file.  Now, I've tried making changes to
rip out either copy of each function, and while I get an executable xboard
program, it hangs right after it's run(the board comes up, and it just sits
there: I can't play, I can't even select menu options).  I've acquired and
compiled gnuchess4.0p62, and it(gnuchess) compiled with no difficulties.
My linux configuration is straight SLS (acquired about a month ago).

Any help would be appreciated,

Frustrated,

Subject: re: cc1 got signal 11

we've got similar problems here, also a: 'ld: not enough virtual memory'.
and YES! the problem really was overheating the computer!!!
because the disk got so hot, the contents of libg.a where screwed,
and an entry there appeared very large 1888...0 bytes or such,
and of course xmalloc() from ld would fail. we turned off the computer,
and after it cooled down, tried to compile again. NO BUG! anymore.

we will try to
a) save the disk contents when it is cold
b) get the disk to operating temperature
c) format the disk again when it has reached operating temperature.
d) restore the backup.

probably that will help!

you additionally have to get pcnfsd.c running on your machine.
pcnfsd.c is available from ftp.vax.com (vax.ftp.com ?) , i forgot the

a) #include <shadow.h> instead of pwd.h
b) mkdir(pathname) has to be changed to mkdir(pathname,dir_more)

True for now, but if Linux *remains* not-for-idiots, in the long run it
will be left in the dust of its more idiot-forgiving competition, and
Linux will become for-idiots-only by default, along with sundry
masochists and nostalgia buffs.

Slackware's painless installation is one step in the right direction.
A Linux-or-better that you can drop into any computer as easily as
today's easiest shrink-wrapped packages is most definitely worth
keeping in mind as a long-term objective, even if it's impractical to
make it one of this year's targets.

You cannot append to a QIC tape except at End-of-Media. Tar cannot do
this because it means appending *after* a filemark. In essence you cannot
overwrite a QIC tape.

A QIC tape has an erase head that covers the entire width of the tape.
On some drives you can overwrite on the first track, on others you
may not be able to do this.

Subject: why Linux does not like SIGBUS

hi.

try the following small programm:

>   *l=12345;

what will happen ? on Linux, nothing. on Sparc, you will get a SIGBUS.
SIGBUS is the signal which reports improper alignment of data to the
process, i.e, a long has to be aligned on (how many??) 4 or 8 byte boundary.

the 386/486 CPU does! have an option to enable alignment checking, this is
set in the CPU-flags, it is the AC bit. the reason, why one would like to do
alignment checking is the speed of load operations, loading a long on a non
byte boundary takes additional memory cycles. I'm curious if Linux does
alignment checking too? (can someone answer this?), and just has no SIGBUS,
or if it does no a.c., then I'd be interested how many apps. would die :-)

a very quick and dirty fix I use for the SIGBUS is to say: -DSIGBUS=SIGKILL
when compiling sources. (i try have sources unmodified...)

Subject: can't pos to c.o.l.a...grr [ANNOUNCE] wu/ftpd


hi,

i recieved a fix for an error for wu-ftpd. some clients had problems recieving
the full buffer size, which then produced an "Illegal seek" in the server
side. This is now fixed, thanks to Barry Titmarsh <BTITMARS@ESOC>

I have tested the fix with the Macintosh, where I got the error before.
Right, it wasn't there anymore. There are, however, still errors.
When using NCSA/cutcp on the client side, the data-transfer isn't even
initiated. (Using a Sparc as client did work). I'm not perfectly sure if
this is an tcp protocol-error ... (or not yet implemented ip-optins ?)

The other way, using Linux as client and NCSA/cutcp as server did work.
(Yes this is possible, try the ALT-T key when logged into somewhere, you
can ftp to your own PC...)

I have put the source on the host/directory/file

wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at
/pub/linux/ports/wu-ftpd-2.1a.tar.gz             (dated Aug-15, 18:32)

Please report back when you find bugs.
If no-one find bugs, i will put the port on tsx or nic.funet,
and let it register in the software list (lsm)

greetings, Herp (ircadmin@irc.uni-linz.ac.at / herp@wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at)

PS: don't forget to alter src/pathnames.h, since this only reflects my
private configuration. you might instead want to use the standard /etc
