Hi !
As far as I know, there are two implementations of Prolog for Linux :
XPCE/SWI-Prolog for Linux : (X11-Interface)
           ftp site:       swi.psy.uva.nl (145.18.114.17)
           directories:    pub/xpce        (PostScript documentation)
                           pub/xpce/linux  (Linux binaries)
                           pub/linux/lib (libraries)
XSB can be found in : sbcs.sunysb.edu : /pub/XSB/XSB.tar.Z

The chances of linux ever running on a 68000 system are low to nil.
The chances of linux running on a 68030 or 68851/68020 or 68040 system
are pretty high.

Most of linux is already running on a 68030 system; the kernel, that
is.

I have a Sun IPX with 32mb alongside a Linux box on a 486DX2-50 with 16mb,
and I'd say for most things, the performance is very similar, and for
some things Linux seems considerably faster.  Disk operations, for some
reason, on the Sun seem quite a bit slower than they are on the Linux system.
Both have reasonable SCSI disks, the Linux box has an Adaptec 1542B and
a Toshiba 877mb drive, the Sun has their standard 422mb drive.

I got the SLS disk label files by Chris Johnston and they look great. I
decided to get some avery 5196 labels to print them on but the local
office supply store said they cost $49 per box! I'd like to use the
labels but it's not worth $49 to me. Does anyone know of a place that
will sell them by the sheet or would anyone be willing to sell
pre-printed labels?

I tried to contact Chris about this but could not reach the right
machine from here.

Does this zImage file mount the correct root partition?
the easiest way to make sure is to use rdev and tell this kernel image
what the root partition is:

rdev zImage /dev/hda1    <- for example if your root partition is /dev/hda1

rdev can also tell the kernel where your swap is and what video mode to go
into at bootup.

rdev -s zImage /dev/hdb4   <- set swap space to be /dev/hdb4
rdev -v zImage 3           <- use video mode 3 (-3 is the flag for query)

There is also SWI-Prolog from Amsterdam I think, which compiles just like XSB

The SAME goes for me. There were a few articles describing this symptom
but none helped (me). I played around with almost every file in
/conf/net. I am using pl12 from the slackware distribution. The 'funny'
thing is that before that I upgraded everything by hand from an old pl9
to pl10 and the net-2 distr. and I got my net working within half an hour.
I saved my etc and conf files before installing the slackware and
restored everything in single steps carefully thinking about each change,
but: no way!
I also changed the order of the lo and eth0 configuration, but it did
not help.
ifconfig shows that eth0 is up but every route regarding eth0 yields to
the message mentioned above.

Thanks,

Andreas

Sure. I have M$ 2-button inport busmouse on irq 5 (it was in irq
2 when I installed X, but I had to change it to irq 5).

First, you need to compile a new kernel which supports inport
mice, if you don't have one, and reboot with that kernel.

Second, create a device for your mouse. I have it named as
inportbm (as Linux devicelist suggests) and /dev/mouse is a
symlink to it.

crw-rw-rw-   1 root     root      10,   2 Jul  2 22:28 /dev/inportbm
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root            8 Jul 20 05:34 /dev/mouse -> inportbm

Last, edit your /usr/X386/lib/X11/Xconfig file, especially mouse
settings. Here are appropriate lines from my Xconfig:

# Mouse definition and related parameters
#
Busmouse        "/dev/inportbm"
SampleRate      200
Emulate3Buttons

Now you should be ok and you can try out your X windows.

Subject: seyon v. minicom
Date: Tue, 31 Aug 1993 22:46:00 GMT

hi there,

i have been trying to change from using minicom to seyon since the later
seems to offer better interface in X (i am running Linux + XFree locally to
a remote Sun Sparc). but i found it is impossible to use sz and rz with
seyon. i have read all the README files + FAQ.Seyon + man pages, played
with .seyon/protocal file etc. i have tried everything i know (by the way, 
many thanks to Dawood@eng.warwick.ac.uk for some very good tips) but i still
get nothing working - always complains in the remote Sun that it waits for
me to send either rz or sz at the modem program! in the mean time, i could
not do anything at seyon command panel since it's locked and shows something
like 'another process running' or smething similar.

i wonder is there anybody who has got sz/rz working with seyon, under
linux? if not, i guess that i just have to stay use my old-trusted
minicom, with some inconvenience ;-( but at least it works.

any comments?

As far as i know there are efforts made to port Linux to

I use Seyon 2.14b under Linux 0.99.12 and have no problems with sz/rz.
Here are the relevant entries from my protocols file:

        "Upload   (Zmodem)"  "$cd $HOME/upload; sz -w 2048 -o -b" y
        "Download (Zmodem)"  "$cd $HOME/download; rz" n

I have it automatically cd to directories I created for file transfers,
then run sz/rz.  The sz options are what I found works with the machine
I usually call - they may not be right for other machines.  They are:

        -w 2048    Restrict window size to 2048 bytes
        -o         Disable automatic selection of 32 bit CRC
        -b         Binary override; transfer file without any translation

Here's what I have in .Xdefaults:

        Seyon.autoZmodem:       True
        Seyon.autoZmodemAction: ShellCommand("$cd $HOME/download;rz");Beep();
        Seyon.modems:           /dev/modem

Whatever happened to "Can't find libBlah-x.y.z error"?  It would be a
lot more enlightening than just a segv-core-dump. (Yes, I just checked
this thread out when I decided to test the copy of Emacs that comes
with SLS Linux 1.03. I'm off to snag the X1 disk now...)
