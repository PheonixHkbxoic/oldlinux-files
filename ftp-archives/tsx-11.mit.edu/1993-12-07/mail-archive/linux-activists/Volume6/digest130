                                 Linux Meta-FAQ 


        This is the Meta-FAQ for Linux. It is mainly a list of valuable 
        sources of information. Check these sources out if you want to 
        learn more about Linux, or have problems and need help. Lars 
        Wirzenius (wirzeniu@cc.helsinki.fi) wrote the first version of 
        this document, and it is now maintained by Michael K. Johnson 
        (johnsonm@Sunsite.unc.edu). Mail me if you have any questions 
        about this document. 

        NOTE: Filenames in this article are for the tsx-11.mit.edu ftp 
        site (see below for names of more ftp sites). Files are usually 
        located in similar places on other sites. The names are relative 
        to the directory /pub/linux/ on tsx-11. 


        What is Linux? 
           Linux is a clone of the UNIX operating system that has been 
           written entirely from scratch. It has no proprietary code in 
           it. Linux is freely distributable under the GNU Public 
           License. It only works on IBM PC compatibles with an ISA or 
           EISA bus and a 386 or higher processor. See the FAQ for more 
           exact hardware requirements. The Linux kernel is written by 
           Linus Torvalds (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi) from Finland. 
           Most of the programs running under Linux are generic Unix 
           freeware, many of them from the GNU project. 


        The Linux FAQ 
           A collection of common problems and their solutions. Answers 
           many questions faster than the net. Stored on many Linux ftp 
           sites (docs/FAQ/) and rtfm.mit.edu, the general archive site 
           for all FAQs. 


        Linux newsgroups 
           There are several Usenet newsgroups for Linux. It is a good 
           idea to follow at least comp.os.linux.announce if you use 
           Linux. Comp.os.linux.announce is moderated by Matt Welsh and 
           Lars Wirzenius. To make submissions to the newsgroup, send 
           mail to linux-announce@tc.cornell.edu. You may direct 
           questions about comp.os.linux.announce to Matt Welsh, 
           mdw@tc.cornell.edu. 

           The newsgroup comp.os.linux.admin is an unmoderated newsgroup 
           for discussion of administration of Linux systems. 

           The newsgroup comp.os.linux.development is an unmoderated 
           newsgroup specifically for discussion of Linux kernel 
           development. The only application development questions that 
           should be discussed here are those that are intimately 
           associated with the kernel. 

           The newsgroup comp.os.linux.help is an unmoderated newsgroup 
           for any Linux questions that don't belong anywhere else. 

           The newsgroup comp.os.linux.misc is the replacement for 
           comp.os.linux, and is meant for any discussion that doesn't 
           belong elsewhere. 

           In general, do not crosspost between the Linux newsgroups. 
           The only crossposting that is appropriate is an occasional 
           posting between one unmoderated group and 
           comp.os.linux.announce. The whole point of splitting 
           comp.os.linux into many groups is to reduce traffic in each. 
           Those that do not follow this rule will be flamed without 
           mercy... 


        Other newsgroups 

           Do not assume that all your questions are appropriate for a 
           Linux newsgroup just because you are running Linux. Is your 
           question really about shell programming under any unix or 
           unix clone? Then ask in comp.unix.shell. Is it about GNU 
           Emacs? Then try asking in gnu.emacs. Also, if you don't know 
           another group to ask in, but think there might be, politely 
           ask in your post if there is another group that would be more 
           appropriate for your question. At least the groups comp.unix. 
           {questions,shell,programming,bsd,admin}, and 
           comp.windows.x.i386unix should be useful for a Linux user. 


        0.1 Getting Linux 


        0.1.1 Linux FTP sites 

        A more complete list of Linux FTP sites is in the Linux 
        INFO-SHEET (docs/INFO-SHEET). The most important sites are 
        listed here; please see the INFO-SHEET for a site nearer to you 
        (there are many mirrors). 

           textual name             numeric addr    Linux directory
           =======================  ==============  ===============
           tsx-11.mit.edu           18.172.1.2      /pub/linux
           sunsite.unc.edu          152.2.22.81     /pub/Linux
           nic.funet.fi             128.214.6.100   /pub/OS/Linux

        These sites are the main ``home'' sites for Linux where most 
        uploads take place. There are many mirror sites; please use the 
        closest (network-wise) site to you. 


        0.1.2 Linux on BBS's 

        Zane Healy posts (around the beginning and middle of the month) 
        a list of BBS's that have Linux available for download. Try them 
        if you can't FTP. This list is available by ftp as docs/bbs.list 
        at tsx-11. 


        0.1.3 Linux on physical media 

        Linux is distributed on floppies by at least Softlanding 
        Software (910 Lodge Ave, Victoria, B.C, Canada, V8X-3A8, (604) 
        360-0188) for USD 3.25/disk. This is mostly the same SLS 
        distribution that is available via FTP (see below). The diskette 
        distribution is mostly meant for people who can't FTP. SLS is 
        also now producing a CD-ROM of the SLS release. 

        Marco Scheibe (mykee@cs.tu-berlin.de) and Gert Doering 
        (gert.doering@physik.tu-muechen.de) will copy Linux (the 
        complete SLS distribution, including X, possibly other things as 
        well) for you, if you send them diskettes and return postage. 
        Contact them via e-mail first. 

        Yggdrasil Computing is producing a CD-ROM with Linux. Currently 
        a beta version is available (beta referring to the fact that the 
        contents are still evolving) This is a completely new 
        distribution, not SLS. A complete listing of files is available 
        via FTP from netcom.com in directory pub/yggdrasil. There is 
        also a manual and other information there. Contact 
        yggdrasil@netcom.com or call (510)526-7531, 9am-5:30pm, 
        California time. 

        Also check advertisements/* at tsx-11 for advertisements of 
        other ways to get linux, including a list of people that will 
        make copies for you at low prices. 

        If you know of other distributors, send me a note! 


        0.1.4 Commercial networks 

        GEnie mirrors most of tsx-11 and sunsite (including SLS). 
        CompuServe has only very limited very old Linux archives. 


        0.1.5 Mailservers and such 

        The trickle server TRICKLE@AWIWUW11.BITNET, aka 
        TRICKLE@AWIWUW11.EARN, aka TRICKLE@AWIWUW11.wu-wien.ac.at, send 
        mail to one of these addresses with a body consisting of /HELP. 


        0.2 Linux distributions (aka ``releases'') 


        Linux is distributed by its author only as a kernel. Other 
        people have put together ``distributions'' that can be used. 
        These distributions pair the kernel as released by the author 
        with software, to make a complete working package. Most releases 
        include application programs as well as system software, 
        providing ``one stop shopping'' for Linux. 

        Jim Winstead and H.J. Lu maintain the boot and root disks. These 
        two form more or less the ``official'' release. It is fully 
        functional, but only has the bare essentials. The filenames are: 
        images/bootimage-xxx.Z and images/rootimage-xxx.Z (xxx stands 
        for the version number). They're also hard to install for 
        newcomers; I'd go for the SLS release (below) if you're new to 
        Linux and want all of the goodies. 

        The SLS (Softlanding Linux System) release is rather complete 
        and has more or less all of the software you could possibly want 
        for any Linux system. This release is what most new Linux users 
        with large hard drives will want to install: it's fairly easy to 
        do and since most people have used the SLS Linux distribution, 
        if you have any problems there are many people out there who can 
        give you help. The SLS release is updated periodically, with 
        ``full'' updates taking place occasionally. You can find the SLS 
        release on tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/packages/SLS/ and fine 
        mirrors everywhere, including SunSite.unc.edu and 
        wuarchive.wustl.edu. 

        If you would like a smaller, tighter, and cleaner distribution 
        of Linux with fewer frills and fewer programs, try the recently 
        re-incarnated MCC-interim distribution. You can ftp it from 
        ftp.mcc.ac.uk. It is designed for very quick installation, and 
        comes with very good and complete installation documentation. 
        Also, almost every binary in MCC is re-compiled for each 
        release, which means a better working system in general. 

        H.J. Lu (the Linux GCC maintainer) also has another set of 
        disks, including a combined boot and rootdisk, and some 
        additional disks with more programs. This package assumes you 
        are already familiar with Linux, and at least some of it may be 
        incorporated to the work of Jim Winstead. See directories 
        packages/GCC/rootdisk and packages/GCC/basedisk on tsx-11. 


        0.3 Linux mailing-lists 


        Used mostly for discussion between developers of new features 
        and testers of pre-release versions. See addresses in the FAQ. 


        0.4 Documentation for various programs 


        Many programs come with some sort of documentation, often in a 
        file called README or something similar. It is a VERY good idea 
        to read them with care. It is boring to see (and answer) 
        questions that are answered in the documentation. 


        0.5 Keeping track of current releases 


        New releases, programs, and ports are usually announced in 
        comp.os.linux. finger torvalds@klaava.helsinki.fi to get some 
        information about the current kernel (often long!). See also the 
        next item. 


        0.6 The Linux Hardware Compatibility List 


        Posted occasionally to comp.os.linux.announce, and found on the 
        major Linux FTP sites (tsx-11:docs/compat.list). This list lists 
        some of the devices and hardware that Linux currently supports. 
        It's useful for anyone wanting to purchase or upgrade their 
        system. Be aware that it cannot be complete, as there is more 
        hardware out there than Linux users can own.

This isn't weird its correct POSIX/SYS5 behaviour. The ability to ignore
child signals is an invaluable tool and saves messy code picking up dead

Date: 14 Aug 1993 03:23:30 +0300


I have not encountered any errors with zmodem, but noticed another odd
thing. I use 2400bps internal modem with pl10 and it works nicely, in
general. However, after uploading (and maybe downloading, too, I'm not
sure) the serial line becomes jumpy. When I'm back in my kermit session,
text from the remote host appears in chunks of about 128(?) characters,
a bit like on a slow compressed line. Everything still works, no
characters are lost, but it sure is a bit annoying and probably
indicates a bug in somewhere.

I have also noticed that fast spurious character burst (e.g. lifting the
phone accidentally off the hook while the modem is in use) often lock
the serial line completely. Kermit just hangs when trying to access it.
Rebooting the machine fixes that (while not affecting the modem) so the
problem is surely in the device driver.

It won't be ground wires.

The problem is that the telephone line is not well balanced.  If
it were there would be only common mode induction from external
fields and that would be balanced out.  The first thing to suspect
is that the local "house" wiring isn't twisted pair.  Non-twisted
pair should only be used for very short distances (like the 6'
from the modular jack to the phone).  If the house wiring is old
"quad" wire, which isn't twisted, then it should be replaced.
Same if it is "satin ribbon".  If the wiring is in fact twisted
pair then the indication is that a staple has shorted it to
something, it is kinked somewhere very badly, there are long stub
runs that aren't used, there is a bad connection, or there is a
short to ground or some other conductor on one side.

Your screwdriver might be of some help, but the voltmeter and the
scope just aren't going to help you test telephone lines.  You can
continue to believe it will if you want, but people in the
business of testing telephone lines don't use them.

And I will continue to try correcting whatever misinformation
you wish to post on the subject...

The netmask is not needed with pl12, as the kernel gets it right now. 
But it won't hurt, of course. 

>/etc/route add 127.0.0.0

The 127.0.0.0 route is probably useless. 

>/etc/route add 127.0.0.1
>
># Set up the Ethernet connection(s).
>/etc/ifconfig eth0 ${IPADDR} netmask ${NETMASK}

When you set the netmask by hand, you should also set the broadcast
address to make sure they match: you should probably add

BROADCAST="129.115.10.255"

and add "broadcast ${BROADCAST}" to the ifconfig line.

>/etc/route add ${NETWORK}

Do you have the network address in your /etc/networks file? Add a line
like "Cnet 129.115.10.0" to your /etc/networks (or name the network
anything you want, naturally), so that the route command can find out
that you are adding a network route.  This is also why you want to use
libc.so.4.4.2, as the 4.4.1 libc will mess up the network addresses (it
will think 129.115.10.0 is a B-net, and mask it out to 129.115.0.0). 

>/etc/route add ${IPADDR}

Shouldn't be needed.  The network address should cover this case. 

>/etc/route add default gw ${GATEWAY} metric 1

This should work once you get the network route set up correctly.

One thing to check for in cases like this is what arguments the shell
actually uses for the "chdir()" call: it might be using the empty string
(or even the NULL pointer), both of which probably work under BSD to
give the "current directory", but it doesn't work that way under linux
(and is not supposed to).  "ftpd" has a similar problem when using
"mget/mput" for the current directory.  One good way to check this out
is to use "strace" on ash. 

There may be other use of "BSD features" that break under POSIX (and
thus linux), which may explain why the problem cannot be seen on the
NetBSD platforms.

This is wrong. Loopback should be configured to 127.0.0.1 and not your
IP address. Use

        /etc/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
        /etc/route add 127.0.0.1

to set up your loopback device.

At least the eth0 broadcast and netmask doesn't match: the broadcast
addrss implies a B-class network, while the netmask is for a C-class
(probably correct - subnetted).

Your "network" route is in fact a host route judging by the flags (the
'H').  Add the network to your /etc/networks so that 'route' will set up
the correct routing (but see caveat about libc-4.4.1).  Assuming you do
indeed want a C-class network, your /etc/networks should have at least
this line

=====
network 131.155.110.0
=====

See earlier for correct loopback setup.

The ifconfig is correct (assuming you set the right ip, netmask and
broadcast addresses: in your case these should probably be
"131.155.110.55", "255.255.255.0" and "131.15.110.255" respectively). 
Check the broadcast define. 

>  /etc/route add default gw ${GATEWAY} metric 1
>  /etc/route add ${IPADDR}

The route commands should be written as

   /etc/route add ${NETWORK}
   /etc/route add default gw ${GATEWAY}

The network route has to be added first (to tell the kernel how to get
to the gateway), and the network ("131.15.110.0" most probably) entry
has to exist in the /etc/networks file.  After that, the output of
ifconfig should look something like this:

! lo        IP ADDR 127.0.0.1  BCAST 127.155.255.255  NETMASK 255.0.0.0
!           MTU 2000  METRIC 0  POINT-TO-POINT ADDR 0.0.0.0
!           FLAGS: 0x0049 ( UP LOOPBACK RUNNING )
! 
! eth0      IP ADDR 131.155.110.55  BCAST 131.155.110.255  NETMASK 255.255.255.0
!           MTU 1500  METRIC 0  POINT-TO-POINT ADDR 0.0.0.0
!           FLAGS: 0x0043 ( UP BROADCAST RUNNING )

and 'route':

! Kernel routing table
! Destination net/address   Gateway address           Flags RefCnt    Use Iface
! default                   131.155.110.xx            UGN        0      0 eth0
! network                   *                         UN         0     43 eth0
! loopback                  *                         UH         0      0 lo

Note that the above 'xx' depends on whatever gateway machine you
specified, and that I wrote it without actually testing it out: I'm not
at my linux machine right now.  But hopefully it should give you some
idea. 

Also, your IP address implies a B-class network (255.255.0.0), but you
seem to be subnetted to C-class (255.255.255.0).  Sadly, this is one of
the things that the 4.4.1 libc gets wrong, and the "getnetbyname()"
function will mess up your network address (it will truncate it to
131.155.0.0 instead of the 131.155.110.0 found in your /etc/networks). 
The only solution is probably to get the 4.4.2 library (which hasn't
been released yet, ugh) or to recompile 'route' to fix this some other
way to overcome the library bug (adding a 'net' keyword or even
hardcoding it orwhatever to specify a network address instead of using
/etc/networks and the buggy C library). 

Hope the above helps,

                        Linus

it depends heavily on your Linux installation. I you have a patched
gcc, params.h and an libipc.a on your system, a number of the patches are 
not needed. If however you have a clean SLS/Slackware distribution, they
are all needed (at least, for me).

Try SOX to convert your .au-files in whatever you want. I prefer the
WAV-Format. For playing .WAV-Files try my WAVplay/-record utility :-)
