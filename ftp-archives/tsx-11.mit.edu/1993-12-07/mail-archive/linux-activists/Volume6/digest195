1) symlinks are easy to spot at a glance in file listings. hard links
are indistinguishable from identical copies of a file unless you have
an excellent memory for inode numbers and use the -i option to ls.

2) not all of us only have one filesystem.

Both symlinks and hard links have their place. Given the choice
I almost always choose symlinks for reason #1. I take it you choose
hard links. Why the prejudice?

There are other, cheaper cdroms with gnu sources. We bought one
from Walnut Creek for $39 which included X11R5 and the GNU stuff.
I don't think you can beat that (about the cheapest storage for
the stuff per meg you'll find :-)).

Subject: NFS Mounted as root???
From: levinson@vax.sonoma.edu
Date: 1 Sep 93 17:09:21 -0800

I have the new SLS distribution (1.03) and was wondering about a few things
that I did not see or could not find in the FAQ or release notes.

First of all we have on campus a system that has alot of hard disk space, but
the workstation I want to install LINUX onto does not have enough hard disk
space to install the basic distribution.  What I am hoping to do is just use a
boot disk and have the remote hard disk mounted as type nfs, and have linux
resume booting that way, if possible have the remote disk mounted as root.


If such instructions exist in a FAQ, please direct me to the information, or if
someone has any information about doing this, please let me know via private
mail.  I remember someone posting a message about this quite some time ago.

Thanks!
Eric

I can't speak for Jon, but I prefer hard links because

(1) if you remove the "wrong" end of a hard link, you can put it back; hard
links have no "wrong" ends.  Remove the wrong end of a symlink and you're left
with a dangling symlink and no real file.  Why should I have to check, when
hard links do the "right" thing already?

(2) different programs treat symlinked directories in different ways,
resulting in LOTS of confusion.  Yes, some shells which do this can be
configured.  But does *every* program that cares about pathnames *really* have
to check for symlinks and for configuration information on how to treat them?
My experience says they must, or else Bad Things can happen; my sanity, and my
preference for "clean" implementations, say "Gack!!!".

(3) Similar to #1:  try symlinking to more than whatever depth the kernel's
been configured for and watch things break.  And sometimes you can't rearrange
the symlinks to fix it, if you insist on using them.  Frankly, I think
loopback NFS mounts are a cleaner way to handle the cases that have led to
this in my experience.

Subject: ftp dies, film at 11
Date: 2 Sep 93 01:39:00 GMT

I have a problem with ftp over ethernet running a pl12 kernel and the
following ftp binary:

-r-xr-xr-x   1 bin      bin         59579 May 10 08:37 ftp*

If you just fire it up and run normally, it will transfer fine, but take
the following scenario, assuming you're already logged into a remote host.

mget *
get user.doc.tar.gz?

OOPS, forgot to set binary mode, so I type a Ctl-C

Continue with mget?

If I type a N here, the system goes off into space and writes a core file
of whatever size it can, until it runs out of disk space.  Even if it fails,
it shouldn't get that confused, right? :-)  If I type a Y, I get a 
segmentation fault and a normal 70-80kb core file, I could live with that.

In addition, even without this scenario, I have had several total lockups
with ftp in normal operation, after running and logging out normally, I'll
come back later and find the machine totally dead.  I can run for days, but
if I use ftp, it's curtains many times.  I have a friend that's installed
the even newer net-24 stuff, but he's still having problems, so I haven't
moved to it, is this a known problem?  It seems to be a kernel problem,
since it gets confused as to where the memory it's dumping is, is this
a valid assumption, or am I all wet? :-)

I'm confused by the confusion here.  The ps command apparently told
the original poster what he needs to do.  He needs to add the following
line to his /etc/fstab and reboot or just do a 'mount /proc'.  The
line is:

/proc           /proc           proc    defaults

I have that in my /etc/fstab and it works fine.

Subject: net-2 with pl12, problems with X
Date: 1 Sep 93 17:34:18 GMT

I got the pl12 Kernel from the SLS-distribution and set up a new
kernel with the 3c509 Driver from Donald Becker.

Most net-services are working (ping, telnet, rlogin, ftp) and ok
but I'm not able to get a proper X-Connection.

After entering "xhost +" on my machine I can open a X-Window from
a remote machine but the window always stays black and nothing happens
. 

The same behaviour shows in the opposite direction when trying to open an
X-window on a remote machines X-server from my machine.

The remote machines in this special case are Sun-Sparc-Stations with
Openwindows runnging.

this isn't one of the "alpha diffs" but a short patch that Linus 
mailed to the activists list.  (I hope nobody that this is the one

this).

Subject: Small patch to pl12
Date: Wed, 18 Aug 1993 00:29:10 +0300


Here is a truly small patch to pl12 that should hopefully fix some
problems: the first actually being a possible lock-up under some
circumstances.  The other patches are just added checks in mmap() to
make MAP_SHARED + PROT_WRITE type mmap's fail gracefully (instead of the
unpatched behaviour where the mmap returns successfully, but the
mmapping doesn't actually work as it should: linux doesn't do write
mappings yet). 

The uuencoded stuff is the same patch, just in case your mailer eats
whitespace (actually, the patches are so small that they are probably
easier to add by hand anyway).

I did something similar.  My Linux box only have a 40MB IDE drive
in it, so I put the bare minimum on it first, then mounted a partition
off my Sun, which has a 1.2GB drive, then put some symblic links in
key places (/usr/lib/gcc-lib, /usr/lib/uucp, etc..) to point to
directories in the mounted partition.

It's been working great for about a week now!  8^)
