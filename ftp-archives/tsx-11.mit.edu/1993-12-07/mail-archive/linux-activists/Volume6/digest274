This is not so surprising. Presumably you mean the doc that comes as part 
of the InterViews release. InterViews uses floats to store *all* of its 
internal measurements, so a coprocessor is necessary for all but the most
basic of InterViews-based programs.

I program using InterViews on a couple of PCs using Linux and Dell SVR4, 
have found a coprocessor to be a prerequisite.

I think, maybe, it could be, im not sure if it is,


                look in /etc/motd
                or another /etc textfile.

The discussion lately has been about the Promise Technologies card
(PT-2033).  They apparently promised drivers for OS/2 by the end of
October.  Without the device driver or the on-board BIOS the card
performs just like a normal IDE card (16-bit).  With it I have seen
transfer rates at 4MB/sec, without just standard 1MB/sec.  I did have a
problem with it working in an early VLB machine though.

I am running it under OS/2 2.1 with no problems, except that it is
operating in straight 16-bit mode; just waiting for the drivers to run
it in 32-bit mode.

Hope this helps

Subject: [A]: RAWDISK.SYS bugfixed version 1.1
Date: 29 Sep 93 15:44:45 GMT


I'm announcing the bugfixed version 1.1 of RAWDISK.SYS in this newsgroup,
because I know a lot of people with tape drives not supported (either by
type or by using older kernels etc.) are using this DOS device driver for
backup of their Unix disk/partition.

RAWDISK.SYS v1.1 is available by anonymous ftp from:

ftp.uni-duisburg.de: /pub/pc/misc/rawdsk11.zip
login: anonymous,  password: e-mail address


Version 1.1 of RAWDISK.SYS (raw disk device driver for DOS)
fixes the following two bugs:

1. DR-DOS's CHKDSK complains about an illegal drive for RAWDISK.DRV.

2. Successful restore of a backup was prevented by version 1.0 under
   certain circumstances:

   if the program you use for restore (ie that writes to the disk via
   RAWDISK.SYS) wrote an updated directory entry first before reading
   the FAT to get the available bytes on the drive, RAWDISK.SYS returned
   a virtual FAT indicating a full drive. This prevented successful
   restore.

Both bugs are fixed.

BTW, RAWDISK.SYS is a DOS device driver, that maps an arbitrary
portion of a harddisk (given by a start- and endcylinder) onto a
logical DOS drive. The HD area is accessed (read or written)
through a regular DOS file. Logical drive administration areas
(bootsector, FAT and rootdirectory) are totally virtual, hence
no additional HD space is required.

sorry for the inconvenience,
Juergen

If I do "rlogin linuxbox" it requests a password, even though I set up

Some days ago I posted to c.o.l.admin an article named "SECURITY HOLE in SLS"

I realized that rshd did not correctly check the shadow password file.
Is this a similar problem?

Subject: NFS won't mount on .99pl12

I am having problems with NFS.  WHen I boot off the boot/install disk (SLS

it contains .99pl12) and I make a .99pl12 boot disk, and reboot, I cannot mount
the NFS drive.  I get the following:

mount clntudp_create: RPC: Port mapper failure - RPC Unable to send

.99pl12 does detect the ethernet card which is a 3c503.  If I reboot with the
boot/install disk, I can mount and work with NFS.  Is there something I need to
change?  rc.local and rc.net runs without reporting any errors.

Please help.   Please respond via private e-mail

Several machines (all should) check the permissions on the .rhosts file.
Make sure it is only readable by the owner (ie r--------).  You may
ALSO have to add the foreign host to linux's /etc/hosts.equiv.
Note that sometimes you have to give full domain names and userids in these
files.
