An alternative would be to get hold of Gert Doering's mgetty-sendfax
package which is presently in version 0.13 but works well for dial-in
& dial-out on the same line. This package also has the advantage to
be capable of sending & receiving faxes :-)

I hit this problem when compiling some very LEX dependant code.  My
solution was to produce a modified version of flex.skel that gives
a behaviour more like lex.  It's imperfect, and slows flex down a
lot, but it does work as far as it goes.

Mail me if you want a copy.

Xterm is a window package that emulates both vt and tek modes.
it does not need to be modified to accept cursor commands, that already works.

It can also be used to access otehr machines, eg. run kermit from an xterm
window.

You can even run another xterm on the remote machine, use the term package,
term and txconn.

You should have told them when you ordered that you wanted a <insert
brand here> controller.  We routinely buy from gateway and have run
ESIX Sysvr3.2, Dell UNIX, and Unixware with no problems.  We just tell
them we want an Adaptec SCSI controller (which is cheaper than the
SCSI controller they usually ship) and have no problems.  Maybe things
were worse a few years back, but they are very responsive now.

Interesting.  I met a man at the post office < 1 yr ago who was
shipping a gateway back.  I asked him what the problem was.  Turned
out he was installing an upgrade to his system and was on the phone w/
gateway tech support.  Well, since the tech didnt tell him to shut off
the power before working on the machine....  he fried it.  Gateway
replaced the machine for nothing.  He was returning the dead one.  
again, maybe things were different a few years (> 2) back.

Actually I think the proliferation of mainstream OS's in recent years
has helped open the eyes of many vendors.  Now that they realize that
dos is just a program loader and people want REAL OS's they are
starting to wake up.  

Also, one final note.  Dont just say 'ship me a computer' if you know
of some components that dont work w/ your app (or insist on components
on the tested list).  Most companies will work with you (and in the
case of the SCSI controller - save yourself some money) and if they
wont, go to someone who will.  I am sorry you had a bad experience.  I
think that you are the first person I have ever heard complain about
them.  

One final final note ;).  I own a 486dx gateway notebook.  I asked
them if it would run coherent.  They said nope, it wont run any UNIX. 
Sure enough, coherent would not boot.  BSD386 (or is it 386BSD .. the
free one) though that my modem card was a ethernet board and hung. 
Linux installed right away and has been running fine ever since!  You
cant expect them to test their systems with EVERY OS out there.  I
suspect if they told you it would run unix, they meant SCO unix..
after all, isnt that the only unix for pc's! ;)

Yea, but with windows you get graphics.  With EMACS you get a shell,
LISP interpeter, ad nauseum.  ie a bunch of shit you don't really need

Is there some tip?

My doubt is

I just installed my linux system and i tryed to mount a
linux disk, after the mke2fs command.

But when I mounted the disk I get a message:

kernel does not support xiafs.
How can it be?
After doing a mount (no parameters) the system showed
xiafs disks mounted!

And i can even mount dos disks!

Thanks in advance

Yes, Mule is running on Linux.  But we have to run Mule on X to
display multi-lingual text.  And more, we Japanese need to run
Kana-Kanji conversion server to input Japanese.  All three waste a lot
of memory. :<

Since my Linux environment is a notebook PC (less memory, monochrome),
I don't want to run X.  Say, I want to handle frame buffer directory.
(sorry, as I'm not acquaint with PC, the term may be bad.)

Lucky for me, I've been on vacation, and had enough time to hack. :) :)

I wrote VGA monochrome device driver at resolution 640x480.  I named
it /dev/vga640x480x2 (still less than 14 letters ;-).

I append the patch to 0.99pl9 at the last of this message.  I guess
you could apply this patch to another version of the kernel.

To use this, apply patch and re-compile the kernel, and make new
device (major # is 13), and choose good minor #.

Well, I have a problem with this code.  When using graphics, and
anothor process outputs text to console, it corrupts the display.

Someone, please teach me, how to avoid this problem.

Thank you.
