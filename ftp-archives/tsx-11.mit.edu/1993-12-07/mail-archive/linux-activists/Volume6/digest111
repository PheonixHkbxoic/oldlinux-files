Stop! My ethernet card doesn't load anything from the host, that's why
I said a custom ROM. How did you get an "absolutely diskless" system to
load anything from anywhere. I want to do this, and have no better way
to ask the question, after the motherboard BIOS boots and sees that
there are no disks, what tells it to go read stuff off the net, and how
do you program in the boot disk address if you don't have some custom
flash RAM or a burned EPROM, or something.

|       normally start "/etc/init" as "first job", (the purpose
|       is to spawn other jobs (getty, update, cron, etc...)).
|       Now, as the excutable files are on the host accessible
|       only via NFS, you need to have a little utilities
|       doing all the mount and AFTER calling "etc/init" execution.

If someone else understands how the boot code gets executed, please give
me a clue. I don't know a better way to phrase this, there's got to be
custom ROM *somewhere*, no? The BIOS looks for a floppy, sees none,
looks for a hard disk, see none, and then every BIOS I've tried says
something like "no bootable disk." How do you get it to read the net???

  Ummm, I don't think so. The flexible users gravitate to the best tool
for the job. That means that some people with years of experience in
troff and scribe are now using WYSIWYG, because it generates the same
output faster for some tasks.

  If you use a markup language for hours every day doing complex tables,
then maybe you can visualize how they will look (aesthetically, not
physically) without a format and view cycle. I admit I can't, because
most of the stuff I do just doesn't use that much complexity. Fiction,
articles, and simple four font documentation can be done on almost
anything, but when you start doing sidebars, wraparound illustrations,
etc, most people either do it a lot or require at least one format and
view. And from watching people who do it for a living, a lot more than
one, because they're able to notice subtle things to fix.

  I judge my tool by how quickly I can do a satisfactory job, and that
pretty much leads away from markup for complex pages.

| - Different jobs have different levels of complexity and therefore require
|   different tools to accomplish said jobs effectively.

  That's more in line with my thinking, the complex stuff is easier to
do once in a while with a nice human interface instead of "remember this
arcane sequence of commands."

| - Some folks have the time and energy to invest in deep understanding of
|   complex software. Some folks would rather die than crack the manual.

  The rich and poor have an equal number of hours. The output per hour
is productivity, and whatever works is the right way to go. You could
write directly in PostScript (once in a while), or fill in the bitmaps
with adb if you like arcane stuff with "real control," but most people
just want to get it done. In fact, most Linux people would rather write
code than documentation, and it sure shows.

| - There's always a tradeoff between power and complexity.

  Um, only partially true. WYSIWYG makes it easier to do stuff like a
multi-column table with hyphenation in one column, multiple type fonts,
and left vs. right justification in various columnns. Doing this in
troff or TeX is time consuming (I'm not sure I can do it in TeX at all).
I mention this because I recently had to do it, and with WYSIWYG it was
easy. Other stuff I do in troff, and I used to use scribe a lot,
although I'm forgetting to make room for new things.
| 
| The bottom line is that there is no simple single solution to the problem. Both

| They generally fall at opposite ends of the power/complexity line.

  Other than saying I see no correlation between a top of the
line WYWIWYG and lack of power, I see a high degree of
correlation between memorization required vs. ease of use.

| Let me know what you think.

  I personally think the need is for a native X based open
systems WYSIWYG with power and ease of use comparable to Word
for Windows or Word Perfect. Things like making a few paragraphs
double columnn should be select and click on the columns. Fonts
should be menued. Headers and footers, footnotes, indexing and
table of contents should be as easy as (a) highlight the text,
(b) click, (3) enter the level (for TOC).

  You should be able to do outlining, of course, and move
sections by drag and drop. Embedded graphics (from Xfig??) and
equations should be a full part of it, and not by 500 chars of
multiply nested parens and keywords.

  Too many people in this group speak as if WYWIWYG is still at
the state of _Electric Pencil_ or the CP/M version of Wordstar.
The market has voted, ease of use is in. Microsoft got big by
giving people stuff they liked to use, not by technical
excellence. If Linux is going to be anything but a hobby, it
better offer what people find productive, and not with the
attitude of "we techies know this is shit, but we offer it to
you dorks who are too dumb to use this complex and arcane
stuff."

To be sure you follow what I said, *all* of the boot sector must be
below 1024. If you are installing a small boot partition and then trying
to create the other partition running from Linux after installation, I
can't help. If you're trying to do this from an installation floppy,
thaere's a possibility that you are using the BIOS for disk i/o, and
getting the problem.

I've done 4-5 of these by putting in the boot partition and then doing
the rest of the partitioning from a running system. No problems with
1224 cyl, I have a bunch of old Maxtors.

Date: Fri, 13 Aug 1993 23:40:33 GMT


    Is it just me, or does the new 2.4.5 run slower and use a lot more
memory on a 386 than 2.3.3 did. I just got 2.4.5 and the pl11 kernel
tree to upgrade, and gcc took over a half hour to compile compared to
2.3.3 taking around 20. Also, the memory usage for 2.4.5 was over a meg
more than usage under 2.3.3. I never saw it swap on  my 8 meg machine
when I ran just gcc, now it goes abnout a meg into swap.
    To see if this was because the new kernel was using g++ (my first
suspician) I installed the pl99 tree and recompiled it. Same results.
Way slower and swapping. 
    Is this the result of the 486 compile of gcc? Is it really this much
less efficient now on a 386, or is it a major change in the way gcc
works that accounts for this speed and memory use?

Larry,
You will not find anyone interrested in Linux inless you charge for
it, then you find yourself with an OS that is just like every one else.
I own SCO, Coherent and Linux, and I use HPUX
I can tell you, the biggest difference between them all!
Is that LInux is free, and it is on the cutting edge of development.
(with this many people working with it, with their hearts mind you,
(since they are not paid) Linux is the cutting edge, and all that
you want from OUTSIDE VENDORS will come from inside developers.

Both Computone and Stallion are offering Development Kits for the
drivers for their boards.  Why don't you purchase one and develop
the drivers for these boards?  You could then do what hundreds of
other generous programers do, and share the information.


... In fact, pick Stallion, I'm going to do the Computone soon.
