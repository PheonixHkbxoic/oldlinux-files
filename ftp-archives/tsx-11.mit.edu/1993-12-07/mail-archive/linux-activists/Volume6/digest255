Yes it comes with the SLS 1.03 package. It runs under XView 3.0 and its
called workman. So start up openwin and look in the mouse menu under
XView binaries. works great! check it out.

I get the same kind of behavior on my SLS 1.01 release.  The compiler screws up
sometimes, especially if it has been compiling lots of stuff.  I just reboot,
and things then compile without errors as expected.  My guess is that the 
page faulting system is buggy, especially since I also sometimes get messages
about bad page tables, etc.  This happens on both a .97 kernel and the 99 1.01
kernel, and with different CPU's (386sx and 486sx), different memory (8mb, 16mb)
and disks (IDE and ESDI), so I think its a software problem and not hardware related.

Well not exactly. There is the p2c pascal to C translator. It converts
pascal to C and there is a C library with many of the builtin pascal
procedures and functions. I just tested it. It translates from pascal
(many dialects including Turbo, HP, UCSD, and Berkeley Pascal) to a C
program which can be compiled with the -lp2c library.

Hope this helps,

I've been using a TMC-1680 since last October. No problems. 

Perhaps the kernel you use hasn't been configured for Future Domain 
support? I think it's possible to make such a kernel...

Ahem. This seems to be a misunderstanding. If you have an 8-bit Future
Domain host adapter like the TMC-850, then, yes, configure the Seagate 
8-bit driver.

But: if you have a 16-bit Future Domain adapter like the TMC-1680, then
you should, of course, configure the Future Domain driver (it's called
the Future Domain driver, so this should be easy).

My TMC-1680 has a ROM on it; I see no reason to remove the ROM just to
go 8-bit.

Yes use workman.

It is really quite a very nice package (albeit in OpenLook), I sent patches to
the author for linux which I believe are in the source of the latest version,
it should be just a case of:

xmkmf
make

There is an old version binary on  tsx-11 in the BETA/cdrom directory. Also
there is xcdplay which doesn't really compare.

It is not in sunsite: /pub/Linux/Incoming.  Where did you put it in?
I also check apps/comm, it contains the 1.4 b version, dated 1992.

I just installed the SLS 1.03 on a 386-40 with 4 megs of RAM.

I had nearly no problems installing the system, and the machine now
runs just fine (including internet access and all).

BUT, whenever i su and want to reboot the machine, the system hangs 
itself without any reason or error message...

eg, i su and use the reboot command without any parameters, the machine 
hangs. (no errors,...)
shutdown -r now does the same.

anyone got an idea???

I vaguely remember this from my first installation.  As I recall, the
mail directory, /usr/spool/mail, had bad permissions.  Make sure that the
group is mail, and that the mode is 775.  If that doesn't help, try
passing a message directly to /usr/lib/sendmail (a link to smail) and
see how it's processing the message:

/usr/lib/sendmail -t -d9 <<EOF

OK, 

To all of you who still can't get Linux to recognize your Future Domain
1680 SCSI card...

Try booting off of the SLS 3.5" A1 disk.  The 5.25" install disk doesn't
include 1680 recognition in the kernel.  I guess SLS either forgot to
update the kernel or didn't have room for all of the goodies on the
5.25" disk.

However, I switched my floppy cables around, booted the 3.5" A1 and
viola!!!  It recognized the 1680, my SCSI hard disk, SCSI tape drive, 
but fails on my CD-ROM (another problem...)  With the TEAC CD-ROM
disconnected, everything works great.

I hope this helps some others.  It seemed so absurd when I thought of
booting the other disk [they wouldn't have different kernel versions on
different sized distribution disk?] but it works.

Later,
Gregg

I know of this driver too, I even tried it around the middle of
the year, but was somewhat disappointed. So I decided to write
the *DOS* driver to circumvent the potential problems ftape had
at that times, because I wanted to be able to backup my Linux HD
(I heard recently, that the last version ftape-0.9.6 should be
much more stable and reliable than earlier versions, but I
can not install it until I'll upgrade to at least 0.99pl12)

For now I'm able to take complete snapshots of my system (or at
least of my root partition) and are able to boot immediately after
restore. Something that is of some interest to me is exchanging
different free Unix OS's (ie Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD) on the same
partition in around three quarters of an hour via tape (or even shorter,
if I zip the complete partition into a file on our Novell server :-)

In terms of QIC specs you may be right (I don't know them), but
I used the term in the usual common sense to denote the type
of tape drive I have. But to clarify another point: I did not
write a QIC-xxx device driver for DOS, but a driver that maps
an arbitrary portion of my disk (my Unix partition) into a regular
DOS file, which I am capable to compress and backup using my
Central Point Backup Software delivered with my IOMEGA tape drive
(this gives me an image backup of my Unix partition in QIC-80
format, to be exact) or using any other useful DOS program and
storage medium (see paragraph above).

back,up & away

Subject: Setting active partition on second hard drive
Date: Fri, 24 Sep 1993 01:56:44 GMT

Hi everyone,

    I have two hard drives: Westen Digital 340MB as master, Maxtor 130MB
as slave.  I was considering using the 130MB dive to run linux on while 
leaving the 340MB drive solely DOS.

Question: Can I make the linux partion on the 2nd drive the active partition?

I tried to do this with fdisk (with both drives having DOS partitions) and 
it said that only partions on the first drive can be made active.

Does this mean that I am unable to run linux on the 130MB drive because 
I can't make it the active partion (short of physically swapping the drives).

Admittedly I haven't delved much into linux, so I don't even know if this
makes a difference.  But if I have to have the linux partition on the first 
drive (the 340MB), I'll have to backup and repartion the whole thing (yuck!).
I'd really prefer to keep my O.S's on separate drives if possible.

Any info is appreciated.

Thanks,

Tim
