Try :
 int key;
 while (!kbhit()) {};
 key = getch();

I not sure whether you have kbhit() and getch() but there should be some
other similiar functions.  I am using Borland C++ 3.1 for DOS but these
functions are usually standard.  I have them in STDIO.H and CONIO.H.

Hope this helps,

Hiya Netters:

Since I can't post to c.o.l.a., my announcement goes here. Icmake 5.02
is out. I just uploaded it to tsx-11.mit.edu, so it might take a while
before it's moved to pub/linux/sources/usr.bin. The old version, 5.01,
should still be there. In the meantime you might want to get it from
beatrix.icce.rug.nl, directory pub/unix. Also, the file icmake.doc has
been updated.

New features: more built-in functions for string handling. That's all,

Cheers,
Karel.

[Rest of colorful diatribe :-) deleted]

Try the "book" in /pub/Linux/docs/LDP/install-guide on sunsite.unc.edu

In its (approx) 150 pages, it explains much of how unix works to the
newbie like yourself.  I enjoyed it, and I've been working with unixes
for about 8 years.

Failing that, I noticed that the local bookstore now contains at least
2 dozen books about unix.  The only ones that are missing are "Unix for
Dummies," and "I Hate Unix."  (Though, I'm sure they're due out any 
day now. :-) )

If you have trouble finding the book, or need more information about
getting it, or what ever, feel free to email me directly.

It is stilled under testing. Join the GCC channel if you want to use it.
Be prepared to compile it yourself. The first patch for 4.4.2 was released

You took the words right out of my mouth.  WABI could be a later add-on,
but full ELF and COFF are major and Unix native enough. That plus good
documentation and administration tools and the concept is complete.
It would appear this may not be too far away at the rate things are changing.

First off, I was not using fvwm v0.92, I was using v0.93.  This is when the
problems of the mysterious dashes and system crashes started occuring.  As
soon as I upgraded to v0.94, the problems disappeared.

By the way, it is a good idea to keep a logbook for your computer.  Make
entries with a date and time.  Include all modifications, upgrades and
problems.  It makes troubleshooting a lot easier, especially when running
such a rapidly changing OS such as Linux.

[ My reply to pschen. And retraction ] 

I've confused two different development efforts. The WINAPI stuff allows
you compile windows sources and it substitutes X calls for the Windows calls.
That's what's in the SLS/Slackware distributions.

The WABI stuff will allow you to run Windows Binaries directly. Again from
what I understand there will be an equivalent to a Windows DLL that will
translate windows calls to X calls dynamically. 

Now before you go off jumping for joy:

1) WINAPI is in pre-alpha.
2) The WABI folks aren't talking. I have not seen any software yet.
3) We're talking Windows only. Linux's job is not to emulate every OS on
   the planet. It's just that there is such a huge body of DOS/Windows
   programs - that being able to run them without leaving Linux and to be
   able to run other programs while DOS/Windows programs execute is a useful
   tool. 

====================== Personal opinion time =============================

I personally prefer Linux based tools and programs to DOS/Windows programs.
Unix code is generally cleaner - more readable - and has calls I know and
understand.  WABI is useful because there are a few useful Windows programs 
that required a tremendous amount of programming effort, only has the binary 
available and doesn't have a Linux equivalent on the horizon. WABI will 
execute those binaries. 

So I'd advise in the meantime to just keep a partition available with all of
the DOS/Windows programs that you absolutely must have. Migrate everything
else to Linux.

Incidentally I was cleaning out my DOS partition last night. I found about
13 Meg of stuff (out of 21 Meg) that I'd either moved to Linux, or didn't need.
And now that I have DOSEMU running (Yeah! That's a program to jump for joy 
about...) I can run the few DOS applications my wife uses from Linux.

Life is good.

I experienced several problems when upgrading from fvwm 0.92 to 0.93.  The
problems included system crashes and mysterious small horizontal
line segments that would appear on the screen (a symptom usually attributed
to a bad graphics card).  All the problems were solved after I downloaded
and compiled fvwm v0.94 from sunsite in /pub/Linux/Incoming/.

By the way, fvwm is a great program.  Thank you, Rob Nation!

Yes.  It's doing 16 bits of math at a time and using carry/borrow flags

Hmmm.  I'm having this problem and seemingly many others are.  I've
tried variations of 'fstab' entries and still no joy.  The 'du' program
also fails because 'mtab' is empty.  If I manually mount another device,
a DOS partition for example, then 'du' works but STILL doesn't show my
root partition '/'.

Somebody mentioned to me that there's something in the /etc/rc which
is zapping 'mtab' but I haven't had time to check that one out yet.

In any case, there's something a few of us are doing wrong - can anyone
help?

        Wait...we are asking for 1.0 of the kernel, not the 'packages'
that are being distributed.  I agree with what ppl are saying would be
nice to have completed for 1.0, but don't lump documentation/adminstration
