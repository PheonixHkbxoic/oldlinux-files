I was experiencing strange dropouts until I found out that
cron was calling uucico over the same tty.  Poof.  Now the
slip sessions stay alive for about 12 hours--haven't solved
that yet (I kill cron's PID when in slip).

Yeah your right.  Also WABI (or Wine) will require XWindows and that is not
part of standard Linux.  How far away is ELF and COFF?  Is there a mailing

Hi Linuxers,

I just got a new copy of gcc-2.4.5 and source code of the pl11.
After having done the installation of gcc-2.4.5, I realised that 
I have an extra directory: /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-linux.
The question is whether I need to keep the old gcc stuff under
the i386-linux.  I really like to clean it up so as to save 5.1 
meg disk space (another poor Linux user  ;-( ).

Your answer is very appreciated.  Please send answer directly 
to my address or the corresponding interest parties to reduce
the network load.  Thank you in advance.

Who said the version format has to be 0.X.Y?  The current (Aug. 17)
kernel version, I believe, is 0.99.12.1.  Thus I don't see why we

Date: 18 Aug 1993 06:34:10 GMT

Hi netters,

A few days ago I asked a question about networking with the pl12 kernel.
From the news I understand that I'm not the only one with problems. I tried
to use the latest SLS 1.03 release which includes the latest (final) pl12
release of the kernel. 

I received all kind of hints of how to organize my /etc/rc.net
startup-file(s), but none of these worked and my routing remained broken.
There are some suggestions left that I didn't try (yet):
* Using the 4.4.2 library (Linus), which is however still in the alpha
  phase (see comp.os.linux/53589).
* Using a different /etc/route (Jon Tombs in comp.os.linux/53653).

Right now I installed the Slackware 1.01 release (from nic.funet.fi), which
still includes the earlier version of the kernel (pl12 ALPHA of Aug 7 if I'm
correct). With this package my networking worked without any major probles.

For starters, I would do the tar command as "tar cbf 128 /dev/nrmt0 ."
but that's not the question ...

I don't really think you need to write an eof mark, just space to the end,
but that's not the question either ...

I guess the answer to the question is that when you use mt, assuming
you don't have your TAPE environmental variable set, if you don't specify
anything with the "-f" option of mt, then it's going to use a device name
compiled in.  You might be able to tell what this device is by using
strings(1) on the mt binary.  It's probably /dev/tape, and /dev/tape
is probably a symbolic link to /dev/rmt0 or /dev/st0, and anytime
you do an operation on one of these devices (major 9, minor 0) the
tape rewinds when the operation is finished.  Now is you specified
/dev/nrmt0 (major 9, minor 128) like you do with tar, then it wouldn't
rewind.

In my opinion it really doesn't matter if it is called Linux 0.99 or 1.0 or
Linux Supra or whatever. The only thing that matters is to have Linux as
stable as possible. If Linux is compared with all those other PC-Unix systems
currently available, you should call it Linux 99.0.

        The timer is hard wired.  That is, in-hardware is where

Do yourself a favour and grab the ncurses library. This is fully
curses compatible, and supports color for terminals (like the console)
that can produce it. Also included is a manual text file describing
the use of the ncurses library (your Nutshell book will do you fine
though).

Look on sunsite.unc.edu. Grep through INDEX.whole in /pub/Linux for
it's location.
