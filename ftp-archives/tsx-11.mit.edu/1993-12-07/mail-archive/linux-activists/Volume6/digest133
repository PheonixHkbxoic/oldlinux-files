Yes, that is true.  Sometimes it is hard to separate the two, though.
What I was trying to say is that WABI seems more like a package "add-on"
while ELF & COFF seem to be more a part of the kernel and base "unix"
unit.  Let me correct my posting by agreeing with your statement.

Date: Tue, 17 Aug 93 20:19:57 GMT

I just tried backing up my system using cpio to a remote tape drive.
While backing up a DOS partition, many files produced 'truncating
inode number' messages.  Are these harmless?  I did a quick test, and
an archive of a few of these files seems to be otherwise normal.

I'm using the cpio included with the Slackware 1.01 release, which
appears to be GNU cpio 2.2

Subject: Help: SLS1.03 Xwindow ...

Since I cannot access c.o.l.h at this time, I decided to post my question here:

I installed SLS 1.03 last Saturday. Everything went Ok during disk feeding :-)
However, when I started X-windows, vitural memory got exhusted so quickly even
with only 2 or 3 applications running.

To get one purticular X-app up when vitural memory runs out, I have to exit
X and restart it. When I switch back to Linux text-mode, I saw a few error
messages indicate 'exceeded vitual memory...', and the last error was alway
an interrupt error.

My system has 8M RAM with 10M swap space created for Linux. Is there any
configuration work needed here?

Thanks in advance!

I have the same problem.. I thought it was kernel/net-1 stuff so I upgraded
to net-2 source (which I compiled) & .99PL11 kernel.. I still get network
unreachable.. (no other warnings..)

I've hacked apart the kernel and it is failing in tcp_connect when it

added a few more lines.. BTW who was the wise guy who added all the

Just some historical notes about version 1.0.

At the time of 0.12 (feb '92) we talked about the next version as 0.13.
But Linus jumped to 0.95 instead. His explanation was that we were 
getting close to version 1.0. The expected date for 1.0 at that time
was May '92. Originally he wanted to call it version 1.0 as soon as he 
could run GCC on it. This he achieved with 0.10 I believe. The list of
excuses of putting off 1.0 contain amongst others: a real login, SCSI
support, better memory management, virtual filesystems, better memory
management, shared libraries, networking, better networking, etc.

I don't believe in this mythical Linux 1.0 anymore. The last time
Linus said something about 1.0 was around december last year. Since
then I have seen him mentioning it. And besides, I don't see why we
can't have Linux 0.99.999 :-).

Actually, RTFM will show

where pathX is the full pathname of the file of interest.

Yeah, zcat isn't truly intelligent.  Try `zcat < /dev/rmt0 | tar tvf -`.
Of course, if you are at all familiar with GNU-tar, then you would use
`tar tvfz /dev/rmt0`.

One serious complaint I have about the NetBSD shell is that they threw out
the builtin "test" and "expr" that Almquist had put in.  Anyone know why
they did so?  It also had a builtin "catf", as quoted from the man page:

   HISTORICAL NOTE
       Early versions of UNIX had a program which was very similar
       to catf.  It was named cat.


Maybe they disliked his sense of humour so badly that they dropped the
other builtins too.....

Also, I miss a "type" command.

Well, I see.  I can imagine how funny it must be to jam the book
into that little diskette slot.  (so it will boot)  :-)

=======Personal Opinion follows, hit 'n' now if you already hate me========

I do think that Unix is coming to the masses.  Once the "* for Dummies"
books start, people simply assume that they should know something about
the topic, and that everyone else must already be using that product
and they must be the only one on the planet who doesn't know how everything
works, etc.  So the only question is: will Linux be there for the 
masses?  Yep, because of one thing: IT'S FREE.  People will put up
with a lot for that kind of price.  

Sure there are a lot of problems now, but in the next few years, I 
wonder who'll be left?  Windows? NT? OS/2? or some Unix variants?  
Probably all of them, but those with some flavor of Unix will be better 
off -- more connected to the rest of the world, more able to use
the free software out there, more everything.  Linux is doing a
lot to move quickly in that direction, even with all the problems
people are having now.  It's exciting.

Now, the real worry I have is this:  Bill Gates is no dummy.   Say he
reads this group. :-)  He is immediately convinced by the above (brilliant)
argument, and dashes off a check to Linus for $2,000,000 in exchange
for the rights to sell Linux.  (MS Linux).  Linus, being a poor
student with lots of debt, agrees, snaps up all his code, and 
sues anyone who uses it, (with Billy's help, of course).  Suddenly,
MicroSoft and Billy are worth (more) billions of dollars, and the rest 
of us have to purchase shrink wrapped programs!

Oh, I'm sorry, that was the story about MS DOS, my mistake :-)

> reachs c.

Oh, Linux is just gathering momentum for a jump. As everyone knows,
there are two version name space/time continuums: the development
version name space and the production version name space. In these
continuums different natural laws apply. We shall call these
continuums D-space and P-space, respectively.

In D-space v (version) will approach C (complete version) as E
(development effort) approaches infinity. The natural laws in D-space
are well known and well documented.

In P-space the situation is more complex as v has no direct relation
to development effort (E). This implies that P-space lacks definition.
Thus, a need to impose some structure on the behaviour of v arises.
P-space is commonly defined with the equation v = M(t) (the management
function), which varies v as a function of time.

A very popular equation is M(t) = C * (t^2 + 1)^E', where E' means
"negative development" and is calculated as follows: E' = 1/E). This
quickly escalates even the most rudimentary bug fixes into major
versions. Of course, every management function differs in some ways
resulting in an infinite number of P-spaces (witness SLS, SlackWare
and MCC, for instance). One natural law applies in all P-spaces,
however: v will always be greater than C.

It may seem that the transition from D-space to P-space is extremely
difficult, not to say impossible. Fortunately, this is not the case.
It is well known that D-space and P-space completely overlap each
other. All that is required for a transition between the continuums
is an alteration of perception. One merely has to cease thinking that
one resides in D-space and imagine oneself a merry inhabitant of
P-space. 

The transition between D-space and P-space can be extremely traumatic,
however. This is mainly because during the transition there is a
split-second of utter chaos, as v crosses C (no-one in their right
minds buys software with a version number of 1.0!). Another thing to
remember is that v can change drastically, when jumping from D-space
into P-space, if not enough (positive) development effort has been
spent. As development effort approaches infinity (and v/D-space
approaches C), v/P-space approaches C from the other direction. It is
very important to match v/D-space and v/P-space withing an order of
magnitude.  Otherwise the transition trauma will result in a massive
loss of end users.

And there we have the explanation. Linux is getting ready to jump into
P-space and is at this very moment gathering the necessary momentum to
avoid excessive transition trauma. I suspect we will come out in
P-space at a version of 3.0, or so (with C being 1.0, of course).

I hope this cleared things up. I also hope you enjoyed reading this.
