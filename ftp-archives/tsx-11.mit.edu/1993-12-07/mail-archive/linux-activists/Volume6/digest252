           So far everyone with problems with XFree 1.3 has had
           a Tseng chip, either ET4000/ET3000 and pl12.

That is news to me.  I am running p12 with Xfree 1.3 on a Tseng Labs ET4000
and zero problems (except my monitor is $500 short of being ideal... :-).
I know several others with the same setup, no problems.  Only people I
know who had problems were with Trident, ATI, and some kind of Paradise
card.

           Is there anyone who has it working reliably with these
           video chips??

About 6 months ago I ran the LINPACK benchmark on my 486DX50 Linux box
at home and Sun IPC at work.  Don't hold me to these numbers, but as I
recall the 486 was about twice as fast as the Sun when f2c and cc were
used to compile it on the Sun, and the Sun was about twice as fast when
f77 was used to compile it on the Sun (there is no real f77 on Linux to
which to compare, of course).

Also, in the last week I found that compress/uncompress of a large file
took about 4 seconds on my Linux machine (after the first instance, which
obviously had to copy the file from disk to memory and took 18 seconds)
while it took 8 seconds on a Sparc 10 at work.  This may be due entirely
to the fact the the Linux machine is a one user machine, and the Sparc
has a lot more going on -- plus the file server is in the next building.
All these times are measure with wristwatch accuracy, by the way.

Has anyone been able to get Metro-X Motif to work with
SLS 1.03?  Linux Systems Laboratory claims that it will work
with SLS 1.03.  When trying to run mwm, I
get an error message saying that the system can't exec:
libXm.so.1 improper format.  

Has anyone been able to make it work?

        I'd like to say that I've been almost happy with it
at 38400 baud.  I suuceeded in running the Andrew Demo over a 
term line in less that the hour alloted for it, so it's not
that bad.  I've had to wait longer for X updates on a Sun3 and
a heavily loaded LAN.  Also, I've been able to run crossfire 
(an Ultima like game over a direct serial connection 9600 baud) and
it was playable.

Well, here at the office, we've had 4 machines: One 386-40, 8 MB of
RAM, one 486-66, 16 MB of RAM, one Sparc-10 with 64 MB of RAM and
one Sparc-2 with 32 MB of RAM.

The 386-40 ($1000) will process Usenet news about 2x faster than the
Sparc-10 ($20,000).  Of course, this is entirely due to the super fast
Linux I/O.  Processing news is all disk access, and the IDE drives blow
away the sun SCSI-2 drives.  Unfortunately, the Sparc-10 is faster for just
about everything else.

The 486-66 ($3000) runs 10-25% faster than the Sparc-2 ($7000) for CPU
intensive activities (compiling, crunching numbers, Xlife, etc.)  For I/O
things (xli on Xwindows) it completely blows the Sparc-2 away.

Now, I'm kind of biased.  I personally believe Sparcs are junk, and that
a 40Mhz motherboard with a 386 is just as good as a 40Mhz Sparc motherboard.

Subject: recompile kernel?
Date: 22 Sep 1993 16:55:31 -0400
Reply-To: mitchell@sosc1.sosc.osshe.edu

I'm having problems with a com port and I suspect that the autoprobing
for my 3c503 card may be resulting in an irq conflict. I get a
spurious interrupt message after reboot and I can't setserial or stty -a
cua1 or ttyS1. So I fixed the base address and irq for the 3c503 card
in the net/inet/CONFIG file to 0x250 and irq5.

My question is: Do I have to recompile the entire kernel to implement
this change?

I've been having problems with SLIP too and read in the NET-2-FAQ that
the problem could be caused by compression. So I deleted the compression
flag in the CONFIG file and recompiled...(it didn't fix the problem) but
again, do I have to recompile the kernel? Since it takes about
1 1/2 hours to do (on a 386/25), it takes a little longer to hack a
fix. :-0

Thanks!

Since there are several persons working on my systems, lately we tried out 
sending mail via elm. It turns up, that mail can be sent from everywhere to
user root but no other user can receive mail. All the docs don't seem to talk
about probs on local systems but only about routing while messed up in a net-

What do I have to do to make the other users known to the system ?

I started to look around for Ethernet-Cards, too. And what I found out is the
following:
On the one hand there are NE2000-cards available and on the other hand they sell
what is called NE2000-compatible-cards. The first difference one sees is the price:
The later ones only cost about 100 Marks here in Germany, while the first cost up
to 600 Marks.
Now my question: Will those chaep cards really work with Linux? Has anyone any 
experiences?

Any help will be good help! thanx in advance...

Get ftp.gwdg.de:/pub/linux2/doc/ldp/khg.ps  - it is a possibly somewhat

Subject: More SLS 1.03 problems. Kernel make breaks.
Date: Wed, 22 Sep 1993 21:54:28 GMT

I have just installed SLS 1.03 retrieved from tsx-11.mit.edu on the
afternoon of Sept 17.

I had the same "noise" problems others have noted (e.g. TeX install
complaining because some files are directories or some such...)
however, the real problem comes when I try to rebuild the kernel.

I have a 3com ethernet controller connected to a thickwire network. I
am used to the fact that the ec503 driver is built for the thinwire
conenctor, and needs the EL2_AUI symbol turned on. (That's ok, most
Linux users probably want the thin instead of the thick wire, and I
have no problem rebuilding kernels... until today, that is...)

make config -> with "y" to most questions...
make dep
make zImage

and when it gets to tty_io.c

tty_io.c: In function `int tty_select (struct msdos_inode_info::inode*, struct ifs_file_info::file*, int, struct select_table_struct*)':
tty_io.c:1420: Internal Compiler Error.
tty_io.c:1420: Please submit a full bug report to `bug-g++@prep.ai.mit.edu'.

This was a "clean" build of SLS onto new partitions, not an upgrade of
an earlier version.

This is the first SLS release where I haven't been able to do at least
a kernel rebuild. I have tried to just use gcc rather than the c++ mode, but
that causes many more problems. I have tried a few different 'make config'
runs trying small vs large kernels, (though tty_io.c shouldn't be affected
by much that can be done with make config) and am out of ideas.

I can still get stuff from the net via a Sun (though the Sun's floppy is SOOO
slow...) if needed.

Any suggestions??

And I have just found another interesting wrinkle, doing another make zImage
doesn't change the problem, but REBOOTING does. It compiles tty_io.c
with no problem and proceeds for a few dozen more files until it
breaks again in the same way. I am now on my third reboot and the kernel
is getting compiled slowly...

What sort of memory does gcc have between runs that is cleared by a reboot???
