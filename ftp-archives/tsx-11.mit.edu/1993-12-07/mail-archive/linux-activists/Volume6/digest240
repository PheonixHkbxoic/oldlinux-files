   Does the fourport support (AST fourport card) exist for the
   kernel 099PL12? What are the right settings for the kernel?
   Thanx for any hints.

Yes; from the INFO-SHEET:

0.3.3 Supported hardware:

        Other hardware: SoundBlaster, ProAudio Spectrum 16, Gravis 
        Ultrasound, AST Fourport cards (with 4 serial ports), several 
        models of Boca serial boards, the Usenet Serial Card II, several 
        flavours of bus mice (Microsoft, Logitech, PS/2). 

You will need the setserial version 2.01 to get the AST Fourport serial
ports to be configured (in /linux/sources/sbin on tsx-11.mit.edu).
Configure the AST Fourport cards in enhanced mode, not in compatible
mode, and use separate IRQ's if you have two Fourport cards --- although
the Fourport docs claims that two Fourport cards can share an IRQ, I've
never seen it work.  I generally use IRQ 5 and IRQ 2 for my two AST
Fourport cards.

                                                - Ted

To which my response is a plain and simple "Eat shit and die."

XFree86 is worth what you paid for it.  When you start coughing up some
money, then, and only then, do you have any right to bitch.  Don't take
our work and heap ridicule on us because it doesn't meet your standards.
If you don't like it, do something about it.

Anyone wanna guess how much of my time and money is spent on doing XFree86
things that are of absolutely no use to me personally?  I've spent at
least a couple thousand dollars on equipment, software, databooks, etc.
I spend 30-50 hours a week, on top of my job, on XFree86.  Most of it
fixing other people's problems, documenting things I already know how
to do, and worrying about configurations I will never see.

On top of this, I'm in the process of changing jobs, moving, AND trying
to keep XFree86 2.0 on track so it actually ships.

I DON'T need this bullshit.

This is on a direct serial link.

yes well I just wish someone had tole me that when I posteed to news

yeah i tried all sorts of signal fidling with signal and sigaction, all with
no luck, so eventually I had a hard look at the source and found where there was 
a chance the child would exit before the connect completed and made it so 
it wouldnt exit until the connect was completed - seems to work fine now..

thats a bit of a worry, cause quite often, my syslogd decides not to work and I have

Subject: Linux, BUS Mouse, IRQ problem...Help???
Date: 18 Sep 1993 06:26:25 GMT

    I have a slight problem and short of installing SLS all over again I am
seeking suggestions on how to address this problem.
    I installed SLS 1.02 on my gateway VLB-33 a few months ago.  I got everything
up and running after a few agonizing weeks of troubleshooting (finding a Xconfig
that worked with my ATI GUP).  At the time, I had a bus mouse installed using
IRQ 5.
    I recently upgraded my system with an additional hard drive, a fax/modem (int, IRQ-3)
and a sound card (IRQ 5).  My bus mouse has now been relocated to IRQ 4.  I have been able
to get Linux up and running again even though the physical drive it was on became
drive #2.  But Xwindows crashes when I call it up and it appears the hardware change
(from IRQ 5 to IRQ 4 on the bus mouse) is the cause. I do not want to reinstall the
whole package if there is a better way.

***  How do I update the kernel to reflect the hardware change described above?  ***

The more people they know are interested, the more likely they are to do a port.
Besides, IMHO, Maple is a better package than Mma.  Let them know you want a port

Ok, here is more info from my original post.  I have a TEAC CD-50 
CD-ROM drive attached to a Future Domain 168 SCSI card and am 
running SLS 1.03. (p12)

I found the kernel config option to disable SCSI CD-ROM recognition
and recompiled and installed this new kernel with that option off.
Now when Linux starts up with the CD-ROM drive _DISCONNECTED_ it 
reported the following SCSI verification:

scsi0:
        detected 1 hard disk, 1 tape drive


When I started up with the _original_ kernel and the CD-ROM drive 
_DISCONNECTED_ it reported this SCSI verification:

scsi0:
        dected 1 hard disk, 1 tape drive, 0 CD-ROM drive


Now the kicker...  Under EITHER kernel with the CD-ROM attached, I get
the following error sequence.  NOTE:  this happens even in the 
kernel that has SCSI CD-ROM recognition disabled!

Why does this happen even when I have SCSI CD-ROM verification
turned off in the kernel?  Shouldn't the generic SCSI CD driver
at least let it pass through, even if it can't work with this
device?

Any assistance will be appreciated.  I need to run my internal
CD with OS/2 and DOS.  It isn't really needed under Linux, so 
if I can totally disable it, that's OK.  I do have the CD option
set to 'n' in the config.in kernel file, so what's up?

Thanks,
