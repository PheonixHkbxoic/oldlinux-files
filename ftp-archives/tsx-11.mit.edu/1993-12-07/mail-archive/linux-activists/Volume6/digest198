Quick f*ing around with the McDonald Release and get Slackware for God sake!
People spend more time installing SLS than they do actually using Linux.

Go to ftp.cdrom.com /pub/linux/slackware and get Slackware!

Slackware will automatically install for Boot Manager and will boot Linux
directly from the boot manager.

SLS is good in it's place, as a proof-of-concept type of thing. Give it a
couple months and it'll be history.

I think its a Unix thing where when a filesystem gets filled to almost
full, only root can use more disk space than this limit. Probably to
give root a little bit of room to squeak out whatever you will have to
do to free up some disk space. Its either that, or you lost some
blocks in some accident somewhere sometime. :)

Subject: Need help with dial-in.
Date: 2 Sep 1993 21:25:13 -0500


Hello,

I'm trying to get a dial-in line working on my Linux system.  I am running
version 99pl9.  The modem is an external US Robotics Sportster 14.4.  I have
installed getty_ps.  The problem I am seeing is that the modem will answer
but 1) the modem will send a few garbage characters to the remote system,
2) It will not receive any characters from the remote system and, 3) it
will hang up on the remote system within a few moments of connection.  I
am not sure how I need to configure the system to make this work right.  I
have read the serial faq, however I am still not getting it to work.

So, I would appreciate it if someone who does have such a dilal-in working
would send me a copy of their /etc/inittab, /etc/gettydefs, /etc/default/*,
/etc/rc and anything else that may be pertinent.

adTHANKSvance

Personally, I just have an alias in my .tcshrc that sets pwd as an alias
for `echo $cwd`.  This not only solves the problem, but it's faster and
more efficient than having a separate binary to use.
(pwd isn't a builtin in csh or tcsh on any system I've been on, only in
sh or bash or whatever.)

I am experiencing problems getting X up on my 486/50.
Using SLS 1.01 (Linux 0.99p9), 8 meg RAM, 212 meg HD, Trident 1 meg video
card, Microsoft bus mouse. The mouse works fine in DOS.

/dev/mouse points to the correct bus mouse driver and Xconfig is set up for
the bus mouse, but X pukes and says that it can't open the mouse.

Is there a problem using Microsoft bus mouse ? Should I switch to a COMx
mouse ? Thanks for any help.

Reply-to: James.F.Hall@uwrf.edu

Please don't flame... This ISN'T the irritating question answered again and
again for newbies...

If this topic has already been discussed, my kill filter must have skipped
over it.  Sorry if so...

--

I have two 16-bit machines I use as footstools and doorprops in my computer
room, and I was wondering if I will ever be able to do anything more
constructive with them.  Would it be possible to 'port the Linux OS over to
the lower PC's such as 8088's and '286's?  I know that a GOOD multitasking OS
requires a '386 or better, but could a NON-multitasking Linux be made
available?

Sure, that would also imply supporting the 360k drives, and assume no graphics
(which automatically takes out a lot of periphery software, btw, so smaller
hard drives will still be ok).  I think there would be some support for a
project like this if it could run reREASONABLY ell on a 10MHz box with, say,
2Mb memory.

Maybe it's possible to replace the 'tasking with 'swapping: putting one job to
"sleep" (ala Mac Multifinder) while you go to another.  'Swapping is used on
Dos 5.0's DosShell.

Not to kick a dead horse, but it should be possible to weed this 16-bit OS
down to <30Mb disk space -- that is, if anyone else thinks this would be a
good idea.

Discussion on the net about this would be interesting for all, but if you
really want to email me, my address is at top and bottom.  Flames will be

Date: Fri, 3 Sep 1993 03:56:49 GMT

I was having HD controller problems with my 40mhz 386DX box for the
past two weeks.  Every 2-6 hours (depending on usage) the thing would
freeze up and say "HD controller reset" for no apparent reason, anyway
I took it apart today and think I've fixed the problem: Cables.

My HD ribbon cable was stretched tightly from the controller to the drives.
Jiggling the cable slightly would cause one of the drives to click off,
spin down, click on suddenly, and spin up again.  The amazing thing is that
Linux 0.99pl12 went right on a ticking.  Most of the time it didn't even
choke... just crashed once in a while.

Anyway, I ripped out the floppies, rearranged the drives with no cable
stretching, and everything is okay dokay now.

: the OS/2 Bootmanager directly. So try one of the following
: two ways.

: First: Install OS/2 with Bootmanager and then install LILO.
: Use LILO to start Linux or the OS/2 Bootmanager. Then use
: the Bootmanager to start OS/2 or DOS.

: Second: Install OS/2 and Linux and use LILO to boot OS/2,
: DOS, or Linux. Both ways worked without any problems. 

: To my mind the second way is preferable, because you only
: need one bootmanager to start. No switching through LILO
: and the OS/2 Bootmanager.

: Give it a try. If you encounter problems send me an email
: and i will try to help as good as i can.

Hmm... long time ago, as I was 31 (now I'm 31 1/2 years old) I didn't
unterstand to configure lilo in the right way. So I configured it to write
its bootsector to my Linuxpartition, so it was bootable. After then I
reinstalled the OS/2 bootmanager with OS/2 fdisk and added the Linux entry.
It worked well!

In the meantime I became a old man and unterstand the secret of LILO and use
it instead of the OS/2 bootmanager, and I won 1 MB of disk space.

Subject: [HELP] tar and compression
Date: Fri, 3 Sep 1993 07:18:41 GMT

Hi Wizzes:

I know that my question is not relevant to Linux, but please help me out if
you can. I failed to find a suitable (unmoderated) newsgroup for GNU utilities
or for GNU Tar.

The question is this. I'm using GNU Tar 1.11.2, and I don't seem to be
able to get the compression working when making tape backups to a remote unit
(i.e., across the net, indirectly using rsh which is started by tar).
The typical error messages are, "can't close device (128,-1)" or "IO error".
Another distressing one is "tar (child): archive at EOF not at block
boundary".

Any suggestions? The strange thing is, that backups without compression seem
to work ok.. but whenever attempting compression with either -z (gzip) or -Z
(compress), the child program tar, which reads the data back from the
compression program, seems to go haywire (or for that matter, possibly the
compression program goes haywire).

Any suggestions are welcome -
Karel.

Not quite true. I'm currently using a Diamond Speedstar PRO/ISA (the one
with the GDC5426 chipset), and it works great under Xfree86 1.3 on
Linux p12. Without tweaking the clock programming whatsoever.
My Xfree is a plain 1.2 with the color server and shlibs replaced by the
one's from 1. (still waiting for my Jana CD to completely install 1.3 :-( ).

It takes more than the 640x480 resolution too. I can use it up to 1152x865,
this depends a bit on the monitor however, 1152x900 complains about to little
memory on the board to support this resolution.

Even returning to text mode from different resolutions work good. BTW the
revision level of the BIOS on the Speedstar is 2.04.


Please note that I'm not supporting or approving of Diamond's policy in any
way, but in this case it works (and fast too).

Just my $0.02,

Arthur

The supported boards might work. There are two possibilities : 

- A board (up to 4 ports or so.) can set an IRQ per port (the STB can do this)
  This means you loose an IRQ to each serial port configured.

- A board might share interrupts. The kernel then polls a flag register (or 
  each connected port) to determine which port generated the interrupt. The
  kernel supports this (p10 and up ???) for the standard DOS (yuck) COM ports.
  To implement you need to kludge around with diodes to make a wired OR so
  one IRQ doesn't blow out the other IRQ (check the postings from a few day ago
  it contains a diagram on how to do this).

A last word :

Be carefull when buying a BOCA board. Some models don't support all necessary
hardware signals (CD is missing) so they can't be used comfortably for dial-in
access. They might work with terminals though.

Just my $0.03,

Arthur

Could anyone please inform me as to what documents are complete for Linux. So far
I have got gs.ps version 1.0, and I'd like to say that it is very good, well done
Matt and all who were involved.

What manuals are complete apart from gs.ps and what manuals are planned ??

If you could help in providing a spec on the best documentation for Linux, please
do.

Thanks
Paul (PAZ).

SOme of the doc files I have are in the *.tex format. I used latex to produce a
dvi file ...... so now what do I do to this !!! I would like ps output.

This may seem very silly to many people but I have never used dvi or latex to 
produce docs.

Help needed.

Paz....

Linux seems to be cheating somehow - this took only 14 seconds on my
machine, without accessing swap. And my machine only has 8MB of Ram, so
there is no way to have both arrays in at the same time. Maybe linux just
shares the pages with "copy on write"?
