Dear Linuxers,

I just received the messages as I start my net.rc :

  eth0: bogus packet size: status = 0x0 nxpg=0x0 size=0x0
  eth0: bogus packet: status = 0x0 nxpg=0x0 size=0x0
  eth0: mismatched read page pointers c vs o.

and it repeats endlessly.
Would anyone tell me how to set my ETHERNETCARD?
It should be wd8003d and the set for NCSA is 0x60 0x3 0x300 0xc800

Thanks a lots !!

Sincerely,
Aurona

Strange thing. I am tring to get my modem to work at 57.6, but
I need the "setserial" package found on various sites. The version
I found is 2.02, but they are different sizes at each site. And guess
what, I can't seem to get them to work.. Has anyone else had this problem?
And does someone have a vesion that works I could grab?

Subject: Setting up IRQs on an STB 4-Com
Date: Tue, 24 Aug 1993 03:37:39 GMT

Recently I bought an STB 4-Com card.  This unit works very well under
Linux, and provides four high-speed 16550 serial ports with full modem
control at an unbeatable price:  US$110 retail at your local Computer
City or other outlet.  (I'm not sure how widely available this device
is but it was easy to find around here.)

Here's my question:

According to the docs, the unit can be configured to share IRQs.  It
can also be configured to allow installation of two units in the same
chassis (unfortunately the I/O address choices are limited so you can't
go beyond 8 ports).

I'm already out of IRQs the way things are now, one IRQ per port, so I
can't add a second card.

Is it possible to configure a Linux box to run two STB 4-Com cards?

A side comment:  I had to edit kernel sources in order to get two of the
ports running.  There is a hardwired table in serial.c which didn't
have the right information for this board; if a lot of other people are
using this board maybe I should contribute conditionals to some future
patch level of Linux.  (Unless there's effort currently under way to
make this table more dynamically-configurable after bootup.)

regards,
-rich

This should NEVER happen! (unless I'm mistaken) I believe ERESTARTSYS
should never be returned to user programs. Certainly -512 for failure
instead of -1 is very strange. You might have actually stumbed upon a
kernel bug. You siad you were using pl10, perhaps upgrading might help.

Please excuse the following message, it's important. 
Re: JAPANYES (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au  in: pub/nihongo)
Allusions made in the film RISING SUN about a Japanese economic war against 
America are basically true. If you don't read the book, at least look at the 
following article: 'japanyes' "Does America Say Yes To Japan?" (revised 3rd ed
v072593/short vsn) on INTERNET FTP: monu6.cc.monash.edu.au  in: pub/nihongo

Before flaming, please consider reading the article. Most readers who would
have ignored/flamed this come away convinced after reading it. 

JAPANYES provides a frightening yet fascinating detailed overview of the 
Japanese industrial machine. It shows how Japan practices "business is war" 
to target & destroy U.S. industries. It is a very moving piece filled with 
many referenced & disturbing examples.

You can get 'japanyes' 3 ways:
1)FTP monu6.cc.monash.edu.au (login: anonymous) Its in directory: pub/nihongo
  as: japanyes
2)The article has been posted in its entirety in soc.culture.usa & sci.econ

Subject: Networking in 0.99P12
Date: Mon, 23 Aug 1993 23:27:29 GMT


Does networking work with the latest version of the SLS distribution or should
additional files be installed before it will work? I just installed the latest
version (which includes linux 0.99P12) on my old linux box and now there is
no networking to speak off. The symptoms are:

    linux box is LINUX
    another unix machine is OTHER

    on LINUX: ping LINUX works fine.
    on LINUX: ping OTHER doesn't work.
    on OTHER: ping LINUX works.

    on LINUX: telnet LINUX works fine.
    on LINUX: telnet OTHER doesn't work at all.
    on OTHER: telnet LINUX doesn't work for about 5 minutes then it works.

    Linux box cannot contact name server

My hardware is nothing fancy - just a plain old 486/25 box with a Western
Digital ethernet card.

I had a look at the faq but it seems to be referring to an earlier version
of the OS. I assume that the net-2 code is included in this distribution of
SLS.

I wondered if it may be related to the tcpd stuff which seems to have been
included. I changed the entry in inetd.conf so that for telnet connections,
it would start telnetd without bothering about tcpd but guess what, when I
telnet into the LINUX box I get the message:

    /libc.so.4  (DLL Jump 4.3pl3)

    connection closed.

Now that's strange... or is it? I also tried setting up the hosts.allow
and hosts.deny files when the tcpd stuff was there but that didn't work
at all.

Is there a version of linux of any age with working network code? I think
the last version I saw which actually worked was about 0.99P4. Ever since
then there seems to have been problems of one kind or another with the
my machine and the network. Can I get the net-010 stuff from tsx-11 and
install it as the faq says? I thought about this but I think maybe the
kernel I have is newer than the net-010 stuff so perhaps that isn't a good
idea. Would it help anyway?

If anyone can help I would be most appreciative

No. /dev/tty refers to the controlling terminal of a process.
Here's an extract from Ultrix tty(4) because I'm too lazy to
give a complete explanation at the moment.

     When a terminal file is opened, it causes the process to wait until a
     connection is established.  In practice, user programs seldom open these
     files; they are opened by getty(8) or rlogind(8c) and become a user's
     standard input and output file.

     If a process that has no control terminal opens a terminal file, then
     that terminal file becomes the control terminal for that process.  The
     control terminal is thereafter inherited by a child process during a
     fork(2), even if the control terminal is closed.

     The file /dev/tty is, in each process, a synonym for a control terminal
     associated with that process.  It is useful for programs that want to be
     sure of writing messages on the terminal, no matter how output has been
     redirected.  It can also be used for programs that demand a file name
     for output, when typed output is desired and it is tiresome to find out
     which terminal is currently in use.

/dev/hda is still buffered... Linux doesn't have raw disk devices.  I haven't
yet figured out why there's so much resistance to adding them.

You don't understand my problem fully. I don't want to run one X-Server
with my Hercules and my S3, but actually two X-Servers, one for the Hercules
and one for the S3.

But i think, i know the source of the problem, but that doesn't help me much
in the way of a solution. The culprit, i think is XS3, which is derived from
Xfree1.2, which isn't able to handle virtual Terminal support.

uname -m returns i486 if the kernel has been compiled with CONFIG_M486
(ie. the -m486 option has been used with gcc). Code compiled with
-m486 is still compatible with 386s (only affects instruction
scheduling optimisation). Maybe it would be better if the -m string
was set to i386 or i486 dynamically at boot up time?

Hi !

I'm currently running Linux 99pl10 and having problem with the mouse.

I have and ATI VGA wonder card with a microsoft bus mouse attached to it.
The mouse work perfectly under DOS without and driver. In the Xconfig
file, I set the mouse as follows: Microsoft "/dev/mouse". When I start
X, it tell me that I'm using a mouse of type Microsoft on device 
/dev/mouse, so X detect the correct hardware. The problem occur when X
try to open the device, it give me the following error:

cannot open mouse: no such device.

I verify that /dev/mouse exist, in fact it's a link to /dev/bmousems.
I also recompile the kernel and verify that the microsoft (and the others)
driver are part of the character driver (chr_drv.a).

Did anybody have ever seen this problem, or someone give a direction
to look for.

Hello,

        After upgraded to Slackware, tracker 3.10 doesn't work any more.
After displaying "noname.mod: 0/12" and it stays there without starting
to play the song. Moreover, runtime commands like "q - quit", "> - fast
forward" must be followed by an <enter> before it will have any effect.
It seems that the program is always waiting for key press without doing
anything else. Anyone knows why?

BTW, I am using 0.99pl11 with sound driver 1.99.7 and I can use str to
play mod files. Tracker worked well with these versions before I upgrade
to slackware.

        Thanks.

Subject: Problem finding ethernet device
Date: Tue, 24 Aug 1993 12:32:13 GMT

I have recently installed SLS 1.03 with libc-4.4.2 and can't get any
networking capabilities.  The original boot on disk a1 reports no
ethernet devices found, but I guess that is looking for the WD80x3 card so
it is not a big deal.

My card is not a WD, so I have gone to .../linux/net/inet and edited the
CONFIG file and uncommented the appropriate lines.  Actually, I have also
used the 3c509.c driver in this directory in the Makefile, and used a Space.c
file with this device listed as eth0.

My kernel compiles without a hitch using make config, make dep, and make.

Q1:  Do I need to copy the zImage file anywhere after compiling in the
     /usr/src/linux directory ?

I have tried the fixes Linus posted in this newsgroup to no avail. That is,
I tried:
/etc/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
/etc/route add 127.0.0.1
/etc/ifconfig eth0 128.143.10.112 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 128.143.10.255

That last line gives me a long list of errors like:

SIOCSIFADOR: Invalid argument
SIOCSIFFLAGS: Invalid argument
SIOCSINETMASK: Invalid argument
SIOCSIBRDADDR: Invalid argument

and ,of course, the Network unreachable message.

ifconfig eth0   <-yields->   eth0 unknown interface.
I assume this is the root of my problem.

I can ftp and telnet to 127.0.0.1, but I don't think that says much.

Please help.  You will make a friend for life.

Fellow Linux users:

I recently posted an article listing some of my problems with getting
my nonWD80x3 ethernet card functional with SLS 1.03.

A better idea would be to find an instruction set for configuring SLS
for an alternate ethernet card available to the whole community.  Since SLS
comes with TCP/IP software, I am not installing net010 yet.  I have 
read the NET-2-FAQ, but it is specific to the net010 software.

Does anyone with the expertise to configure and re-compile SLS to work
with another ethernet card have such a set of instructions, or is anyone
willing to document the process?

I will follow this news group, but e-mail is welcome.  I will summarize
any e-mail responses.  Thanks.

        If you are using ms-dos 6.0 or IBM dos 6.1, you can use the
multi-config setup(Very easy, see your dos manual). Then you simply need
to have a program on your dos partition called bootlin.com (Available at
various ftp sites) wich will boot your linux image as one of the menu
options.  This is particularly usefull if you already have multiple dos
configs and don't want users to have to go through two menus.  It also has
time outs etc, on a very easy to use menu system.

        If your not using 6.0 or 6.1 then I would have to agree, LILO is
pretty easy to set up and use.

Subject: Problem installing pl10 to Yggdrasil


     In the process of upgrading my Yggdrasil CD system,  from pl7
to pl10, Im having problems login as root and some other users.
The pl10 kernel compiles clean (after setting links, etc... as
suggested by the pl10 README), and Im able to boot from a floppy,
which has two Lilo boot options: using a root floppy, or the
existing hard drive root.
     It comes up OK with either root filesystem, but when I use the
existing disk root filesystem, I can't login as "root", "guest", or
other users that I've defined.  Interestingly though, I can login
as "demo" and run the whole X-windows demostration sequence !!
     Is this a problem related to old or modified versions of the
login program in the Yggdrasil distribution, or a problem with file
permissions ?? Help !
     Any ideas are greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance !!

     Alex

Date: 24 Aug 1993 09:48:41 -0400

I have some hardware configuration questions. I am configuring my system to
run Windows NT, linux and Windows 3.1. I currently have this system

        486 DX50 ISA
        340,245 IDE drives
        ATI Ultra Pro 2M
        off brand sound card
        Mitsumi cdrom
        CMS 250 tape drive

The off brand sound card and Mitsumi will be removed.

My questions have to deal with the additions I am planning on making. I 
would like too add an Adaptec AHA-1542C SCSI controller and a Toshiba
TMX-3401 cdrom. Please give answers, helpful hints, opinions and/or
experiences with adding these to my machine.

I am considering the 1542C to allow me to add SCSI devices as I can afford it.

If have have other suggestions on equipment that I should look at before
buying, please let me know. 

I am also considering adding a SoundBlaster Pro 16 ASP. Is this board 
supported by linux and/or NT.

My main concern is trying to stay compatible with all 3 of these operating
environments.

Another concern is conflicts between the hardware I currently have and 
hardware I am going to add.

I would also like some good places to buy these items from or best prices
that you've seen lately.

Sorry if some of this info is in faqs but 6 classes and 2 jobs keeps me busy.
Any and all advice will be appreciated.


P.S. Anyone have any suggestions on switching to a EISA motherboard.

Subject: Dos mounting
Date: 24 Aug 1993 13:54:31 GMT

Hi out there.   I'm having a little problem with mounting my
Dos partition on /dev/hda2.  I did a mount -t msdos /dev/hda2 /msdos.
And it gave me an error message :

  VFS:  Can't find a valid MSDOS filesystem on dev 0x0302.
  mount: wrong fs type, dev/hda2 already mounted, /msdos busy, or other error

When I did a fsck it gave me a message :

   fsck: bad magic number in super-block

Is there anyone out there that might have an idea to how to fix this?
Or maybe how to go about solving this problem?  Thanks in advance if
anyone can help me.

Cuong

P.S.
