Though the 38400 swap-out works fine, I'd rather keep the real 38400 and use
a low one instead.  I mean, I still have a Radio Shack modem that speaks only

Hello,

I had the same problem. T solve it: just disable the three options in the
Adaptecs BIOS that give you a warning when enabling them. I am using it

I'm trying to get fvwm 0.94 (and 0.93 for that matter) to run on my
machine. The setup:

 Kernel: 0.99pl8-3 from SLS 1.01 distribution
Patches: selection 1.4, ipcdelta, mmap

fvwm 0.92 run fine under X1.2. But since I've swapped up to X1.3 I
have not gotton anything to run. twm works fine.

This is the message I get:

fvwm:  can't open display ":0"

I just pulled down 0.94 from sunsite's linux Incoming directory. I used
the no options binary and I compiled the binary myself from the sources.
No Luck.

Any suggestions?

It potentially is nicer, but I did give dump a try when running 386BSD (it
was the first thing I tried for backing the system) but it proved unusable,
because it spawns a new child task for each floppy.  It worked OK for a
while, but when it got to about disk 15 or so, the system was beginning
to thrash. :(

Also I don't really see the distinction between different dump levels in
the dump utility (perhaps one can elaborate on this) - I see two different
backup stategies, namely a full backup, and an incremental one, which is
easily derivable from (for example) touching a file in /etc after the
full backup, and using find -newer to get filenames modified since the
last full backup.

As a former user of DOS, and a current user of Linux (and for about
ten months or so, a user of 386BSD, which is another alternative for
a free Unix-like OS) perhaps I can add something to the messages you've
already gotten.

I've run DOS for years, but for sometime have really wanted to use Unix
instead.  When the Intel 80386 came out, I figured it might be a decent
platform for it.  Finally I was able to purchase a modest 386(SX) system,
and considered some versions of Unix (commercial ones) but they were much
too expensive.  Then I found out about Linux and 386BSD.  FWIW, I put
386BSD on first because at the time it was easier for me to obtain (thanks
to an 'installation party' at a local PC/Unix user meeting).

Mostly the reasons for running Unix as opposed to DOS are because it
can do multiuser/multitasking, has virtual memory, and there are literally
hundreds of utilities and useful programs that form part of the base
operating system.  If you wanted similar utilities for DOS, you'd have to
go looking for each one separately.

I did use Desqview and Windows on the 386, prior to using Unix, and
it was sort of OK, but as a user of Turbo C and MSC for DOS, I wanted
to get it to handle some of the more advanced hardware features of
a 386 processor.  (After all, I did pay for it, and I might as well
get to use it).  Sometime later I was able to get the GNU compiler for
DOS (the DJ Delorie port) but it didn't work well, and in particular I
couldn't get the math emulator to work at all (at the time, I didn't have
a coprocessor, but I've got a Cyrix one now), and it wouldn't run with
QEMM installed, so I had to boot up from a special floppy.

Speaking of Desqview, I wanted to add something.  DV has extremely
primitive task-switching capabilities compared to Linux.  DV also
has to add multitasking on top of a single-tasking OS, whereas Linux
is built from the ground up to do that.  For example, in DV I don't
have very much control over priorities - each application gets interrupted
every 18 times a second, and about all you can control is the priority
of background vs. foreground tasks.  In Linux (and on Unix systems in
general) you can control priorities in a variety of ways, and the system
is set up to dynamically adjust priorities based on need.  As a result,
I can do things like ray tracing in the background, and still use the
system in the foreground or on another virtual (or real) terminal -
something that would be difficult to accomplish on DOS.  I did try this
under DV, and the foreground response time was so slow as to be unusable.

Also, I began to notice that increasingly things wouldn't work with my
DOS configuration, and I ended up having to do lots of adjustments to
config.sys and autoexec.bat (as well as the windows stuff) in order to
get a program to run well.

Linux, while possibly more difficult to use in other areas, makes this
no longer an issue.  Also since I got 4 megs of RAM, I'd like to use them
_directly_ (in the so-called 'flat' mode) rather than getting at them with
EMS, XMS, Extended, DPMI, VCPI, or any other kludge that people come up with
to get at it.  

Since Linux has its own GCC (featuring not only C and C++, but Objective
C as well) and since it's free with the base OS (which is also free) one
need not run BCC or the other DOS compilers.  GCC has several advantages
that one will not find on the DOS compilers, such as the lack of memory
models (memory is memory is memory anyway) which lets you do things like
malloc() as much RAM as you want.  (Incidentally, I was thrilled when I
wrote a simple program that allocated two megs of RAM and it worked.)

Also it optimizes very well for the 386/387.  DOS compilers can't even
come close.  (I did look at MSC 7.0, which at one time purported to
add 386 code generation, but they ended up taking it out.)

As far as applications go, linux does have a DOS emulator that more or
less works.  New versions can even run highly graphical games like F19
and probably the Sierra games, as well as character based applications
such as Word Perfect and Quicken.  (With sufficient RAM and swap space, 
and a sufficiently fast processor, one can run easily multiple instances
of the DOS emulator, each running a separate application.  Early versions
of OS/2 only had one "DOS box" and I doubt it could run as many applications
as the DOS emulator can now.)

And it also has lots of other applications that will run directly. There
is a great wealth of fre programs out there that will compile without 
much modification (zero in some cases) that once compiled, work on 
Linux.  In addition to the standard utilities there are systems like troff
and ghostscript (troff is a text markup language for document processing,
ghostscript takes Postscript output, runs it, and derives a bitmap that
can print on a dot matrix or laser printer), and TeX which serves well
for some word processing tasks.  (I get comparable output with TeX and
ghostscript to Word 4 Windows, BTW.  Also I used Publisher's Powerpak, 
and for some strange reason, equations in documents, while looking OK
on the screen, always came up using different characters on the printer. 
Of course this works right in TeX and/or eqn, an equation preprocessor
for troff.

Subject: Xfree bug in Linux, or hardware problem???
Date: Sat, 14 Aug 1993 19:52:39 GMT

I have been suddenly experiencing a problem in Xfree86 under Linux, and I'm
not sure if it is a software bug, or a sudden hardware failure.   Here is my
system:
        Insight 486DX-33 ISA, 64K cache
        8 MB RAM
        IDE drive controller / IO card
        130 MB Seagate HD (124MB DOS / 6MB Linux swap)
        170 MB WD Caviar HD (170 MB Linux ext2fs)
        SoundBlaster Basic v1.0 (IRQ7)
        14.4 K baud internal modem (COM2)
        Logitech busmouse
        Diamond SpeedStar 24 (not X) graphics card
        TVM MediaScan 4A+ monitor
        SLS 1.02 with the following upgrades:
                kernel pl11
                GCC 2.4.5
                libc 4.4.1
                fvwm 0.92
                Xfree 1.3

I have been running with this configuration for a while now, but just
recently I've been experiencing the system hanging, especially while
running kermit or Seyon with Xfree running.  Also, I've been getting short
horizontal line segments scattered in my xterm or on the root window, or
both.  (Aren't these usually a symptom of a bad video card?)  Refreshing
the screen does not work.  I would only say that these problems might be
related, only because they started happening at the same time.  Is this a
bug in Linux or Xfree, or is this a hardware problem?  (or both?)

Thanks.

PS:  I run Xfree in 1152x900 mode using the freq program with the line:
freq 62000 2

Be aware, however, that some braindamaged OSes (I know of SCO, don't know
what the other commercial Unixes do) _do_ use that flag after booting,
so if you want to boot both SCO and Linux from one HD you'll have to
mark the SCO partition as active and install LILO in the MBR.

I know that. Ralf's article says "clear the partition table" 
and that's exactly what the above command does.

Yes, I have tried the above command -- formatting a disk initializes 
all blocks with hex 5A or some such and the Linux fdisk doesn't like
that at all.

Actually, several of us are keenly interested in seeing this
happen.  But the set who are interested and the set who are equipped
to do anything about it are disjoint sets.  :-(
I've seen a "pre-alpha" driver but its author asked me not to
advertise it till he gets the bugs out.  Sure wish I could help,
but I just don't know enough about the higher layers to know what's
supposed to be happening.  I suspect it drops things because the
2K frame buffers are too small for a high-latency OS if you don't
use the predictive interrupts.

Of course, we pay more attention to what our customers demand.
We log customer calls.  There have been *zero* calls logged by 3Com Customer
Service requesting a Linux driver.  *That* is why there is no Linux
driver in the 3Com Network Adapter Division "New Product Funnel".
It is exactly the same reason why there is no CP/M-86 nor OS9 driver there.


>any way, I wouldn't worry too much yet.
>Evern Cryer has not come up with a driver for the 3c9.

Crynwr has a DOS "packet driver" for 3C509 in some kind of assembly language.
I took a quick look and couldn't make any sense of it.

As far as I know, we are up to date with SCO.
Some of the newer ones (eg. the current ODT) are on our BBS but not on
Etherdisk.
For what SCO product don't you have a 3C509 driver?
Have you asked 3Com Customer Service where it is?

What about transferring to DOS floppies for exchange of files between
(unconnected) machines? It is not necessarily true that another machine
with floppies is on the same network.

By the same token, why bother supporting serial ports or parallel ports
or anything that can be hung off a SCSI controller? You don't need a
floppy controller if you have a SCSI-based floppy drive or floptical,
and you don't need the serial/parallel card if you have a SCSI-based
serial/parallel multiplexer unit. For that matter, it is also possible
to get SCSI-based ethernet interfaces.

That is NORMAL behavior (see manual.doc). By default input is in cooked mode,
which means it waits for a whole line terminated by <enter> and allows you
to erase characters, etc.

There are two alternative modes:
cbreak() which will allow you to read one character at a time, and
raw() which is the same but you can't use signals (^c, ~z, etc) you have to
trap them yourself).

What is the definition of stability?

The likelyhood of libncurses.so being a drop-in replacement for libcurses.so
is extremely remote. Both curses.h and ncurses.h make extensive use of macros
to hide implementation details, which means that the set functions supplied
by each library is different.

I'm not sure how much of a problem this is likely to be. Not that many programs
depend on current shared curses library. If they do they should seriously
consider recompiling with ncurses.

BTW, are you aware that tcdrain() is broken on Linux. tcdrain(1) gives an:
argument invalid error. This also messes up with pcomm.
