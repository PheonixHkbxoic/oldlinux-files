Actually the bug is in free() and only happens in for the builtin font.

I am looking into the problem and I suspect will have patches and/or should
be fixed in the next libc (>4.2.2).

To get over this temporarily you can do any *one* of the following.

1) Perform these steps where you extracted the xdaliclock source. This will
   give you a shared executable with static versions of only the affected
   (broken) functions.

        % make xdalicock.o
        % ar x /usr/lib/libg.a free.o malloc.o morecore.o
        % gcc -s -o xdaliclock -L/usr/X386/lib xdaliclock.o \
                free.o malloc.o morecore.o -lX11 -lXext

    malloc.o and morecore.o is only required to resolve references in the
    debugging version of free.o. If you dont believe me try writing a simple
    function free.c with the lines
        free (c) {};
    and then compile and link with only xdaliclock.o and free.o

2) Don't use the builtin font. I.e. take out the -DBUILTIN_FONT from the
   Imakefile and then do

        % make clean; xmkmf; make

3) Start xdaliclock with a font other than the builtin

        % xdaliclock -fn 10x20

4) Comment out the line in load_builtin_font() (approx line 341) in
   xdaliclock.c which says

         XDestroyImage (image);

   which esentially calls free(). This does _not_ seem to cause memory leaks.

Hope this helps

Mitch

Subject: pl12 SLOOOW!

        Hi linuxers!

 Few days ago I've upgraded pl12 from pl10. When I compiled it, I've
added few drivers for devices which I decide to buy (tapes, CD-ROM,
SCSI, etc). Now I see that my new kernel works very slow. So:

 1) Should I remove all these drivers?
 2) Should I remove an FPU-Emulation? ( I have a 486DX50, but I
    added an FPU-EMU)
 3) Should I set limit to 16 Megs? (I have just 8 Megs)

 Any other ideas?

 Thank you,
Eugene

I take it it is clear there are two messages here:

   Then next time you boot, ps should work.  In the meantime do:
   mount /proc /proc -t proc

and a rather confusing error message because /proc isnt mounted -

I have SLS 1.03 with linux 0.99pl12 and on my system the cmd line mount 
works fine. I fact I find it better to do the mount in /etc/rc as

mount -a -nonfs   <<< or something similar, I cant remember the exact flags

This mount everything except nfs mount filesystems which cant be mounted 
as the daemons havn't been started yet.

(I hope this isn't too trivial to bother posting but this is my first posting so

Forget about trying to read Mac 800k disks, they use Group Code Recording
and variable speed which a PC controller/drive cannot handle. The 1.4M disks
use the same MFM coding and sector structure as used on PCs.

I gather that there are several packages around for DOS that will do exactly
what you want (ie read & write Mac disks), but I don't suppose you will find
source code ;-)

I am sure that the format for Mac floppies is in Inside Mac, I only have
vols 1-3 which of course do not include HFS (heirarchical File System) disks !
What you need of course is the description and data stuctures for HFS disks.

I would guess that HFS is described in IM vol 4 (the Mac Plus update) where
HFS first appears. There may be something in vol 5 (SE & II family) or Vol 6
(System 7).

One other thing, I think Apple have now discontinued Inside Mac (which was
getting somewhat BIG) in favour of a collection of volumes covering specific
areas - like 'everything to do with file systems and files in one volume' -
but I can't remember what they are called.

I had a similar problem a while back.  My file system kept getting full and
I couldn't understand why.  Of course, I blamed the new kernel I had just 
installed ;-) but it turned out that because of an error *I* made in the
networking software my system logs were just filling up with error messages.
I was literally watching a partition size shrink using a repeated df command. 
Check in /usr/adm for any really large files. I had like 3 or so 20 meg files.
Just a though...

Hi, I just bought myself a 486/33 VLB with VLD IDE Hard disk controller. I have
realised that I may need a SCSI controller if I decide to by a CD player 
(since most are SCSI, unless I find one that I like that isn't (BTY, are there 
any?)) and a tape backup, maybe another hard disk (SCSI?). I heard smewhere 
that there are IDE/SCSI VLB controllers on the market.  How do they compare to 
just VLB IDE or VLB SCSI in terms of performance and reliability? What is the 
price? Are there any that are supported by OS/2 and/or Linux? Thanks for the

Hi Folks, I'd like to know if anyone out there is running Linux with the

using text I'd love to know. I have a problem with a kernel panic in
swapper, I've played around with the card configuration and I suspect
the problem may be related to the card. Any info would be much appreciated.
Oh so why do I think it may be the card, well I sometimes get a memory
location associated with the panic, this can be outside the range of memory
actually installed (I've tried altering that to see if I had duff simms),
but its usually in the range of memory used by the card. Anyway thanks

Have a look at the X Server binary. They run setuid root , i.e. even though
you are starting them as a normal user, they run with root permissions.
If you don't set the setuid bit for the X Server, you can't run it as 
non-root.

I just downloaded the SLS distribution from tsx-11.  I can boot the A1 disk
just fine, but I invariably get the message "scsi: 0 hosts found" during
the boot, and fdisk says it can't open /dev/sda.

I've tried putting the card into IDE emulation mode, but then I get a
message about "more than 16 heads, probably due to non-standard
translation, blah blah blah, abandoned" and fdisk won't read /dev/hda.

I haven't tried killing the DOS partition and setting the card to IDE
emulation and 16/63 mapping.  I doubt it'll work, and whether it does or
not, I'll be faced with having to restore my DOS files from 90+ 3.5" backup
disks.  I am hoping that some wise and kindly sage out there can tell me
how to make that unnecessary.

And yes, I have RTFMs, all umpty-seven of them.  Nothing seems to bear on
this particular problem.

Thanks in advance for your help.

is there a way to install SLS on a disk other than the boot as my /dev/fd0
is a 5.25 drive I understand I need to create at least the boot disk a1 on
5.25 but is there an easy way to get a2- and b1- and c1- installed from
the non boot... or as an option from a partition... I can fudge the space
to stick the disks on a dos partition or peferably a smaller ext2 partition
is it easy to install them from one of these?  Thank you for any replys
hopefully I will be able to it tonight....
