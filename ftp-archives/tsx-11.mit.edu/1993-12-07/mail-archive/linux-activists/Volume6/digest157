Greets,

Could anyone help with the following?  I recently installed
two 3Com 3c503's (EtherLink II) in my two PCs, one running 
pl 11 and the other pl 12.  "host1" is a 386 running the 
pl 12 kernel and "host2" is a 486 running the pl 11 kernel.
Both machines are using the NET-2 suite which I ftp-ed from 
tsx-11.

Here is what the network looks like:

+------------------------------------------------------+
|        T.B.C=========================C.B.T           |
|          |                             |             |
|       +-----+                       +-----+          |
|       |host1|                       |host2|          |
|       +-----+                       +-----+          |
|                                                      |
|   T: 50 ohm terminator (connected directly onto B)   |
|   B: BNC "T" connector (connected to 3c503)          |
|   C: end of cable connector (solderless variety)     |
|   =: RG-58 solid core coax cable (for thinnet)       |
+------------------------------------------------------+

Each machine exhibits different problems when booted.  My
original intention was to use the 386 (host1) for a gateway/
nameserver for the already overworked 486 (host2) machine.

When host1 boots, it detects the 3c503 card but does not 
report its IRQ.  host2 does detect the card and reports the
IRQ it is using.  The jumpers on both cards are set to the
same configuration: MEM @ dc00, I/O @ 300.  The IRQ for host2
is 9.  I suspect the IRQ for host1 is 5 but am not really all
that sure.

When running, any attempt on host2 to use eth0 (ie. ping host1) 
will result in the following message, which is continually repeated
every so often:

eth0: transmit timed out, TX status 0xe, ISR 0x0
eth0: Possible network cable problem?
eth0: Resetting the 3c503 board 0x708=0x10 0x706=0x2 0x205=0x49... done.

The "possible network cable problem" is perhaps the most alarming 
since I built the thing not really knowing what I was doing but
using "common sense" and some 2nd hand information.  

As for host1, any attempt to use network software (such as doing a
"finger @host2") will result in a message similar to this:

finger: tcp/finger: unknown service 

So I hope you can see that I can't tell whether its a hardware or
software (or both) problem.  I could provide copies of my /conf/net
files (if that would help) but their contents parallel pretty
closely the suggested entries in the NET-2.FAQ.


Thanks for reading this,

Subject: SystemV FS and Xenix FS - need testers
Date: 22 Aug 1993 20:18:32 GMT

Hello all,

I have kernel patches that allow Linux to access (read/write) disks
and/or partitions of the following filesystems:
  - Xenix FS,
  - SystemV Release 2 (286) FS,
  - SystemV Release 4 (386) FS,
  - Coherent FS.

They are on ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de [129.13.115.2] in directory
/pub/linux/sysvfs/ , for 0.99.10, 0.99.11, 0.99.12 separately.

I have been able to test SysV and Coherent FS on floppy disks, and
Coherent FS has been reported to work on hard disk partitions.

Before these patches can be included into the standard kernel, they need
some testing, however. Please test it and report your success (or failure)
to me. Does it work? Does it produce kernel printk() warnings? Does
the other OS's fsck complain about what my code did to your disk?

Date: 22 Aug 1993 16:44:01 -0400
Reply-To: shendrix@pcs.cnu.edu (Shannon)


        For some reason, my vi editor has started having problems with
stdin.  If I select a range of text and perform any operation on it, the
results are put into the buffer but the first line is always:

stty: standard input: Invalid argument

No big deal, I just delete it.  Thing is, something I have done has
started this (at least I think so).  I'm running .99p12 kernel (non-ALPHA)
and this problem existed on .99pl9 (suddenly, just one day I got up and...)
.99p11 too.
 
        My current plan to go get vi sources and compile them to see if
maybe the binary just doesn't like something on the system.  If anyone
knows the REAL reason let me know because other than recompiling I have
no idea.  Plus, even if the recompile works I would like to know what
caused this to happen for learning purposes.

Hello guys,
  I am using getty( getty_ps) to watch my modem line but still cannot

  My modem connect to ttyS1(com 2)
  I setup it up according to the serial-FAQ.   
  The modem is inited but it does not answer my phone call.
  I have the following entries in my /etc/default/getty.ttyS1

  I have check that getty is watching my modem but it does not answer

  I try to type garbage in the getty.ttyS1 and there is no error

  Could someone tell me how to make it work?

Date: 22 Aug 1993 21:50:09 GMT

I just sprang for a 1 GB Hewlett Packard disk (C2247) and I can't
get Linux to fdisk/format it. When I try to do anything with
fdisk, I get...

        You must set heads sectors and cylinders.
        You can do this from the extra functions menu.
        Command (m for help): 

Fdisk does see the drive and I can mount the DOS partition.
I'm clueless as to cyl/heads/sector settings (calls are in
to the vendor and mfgr).  However, the FAQ is ambiguous as
to whether the provision of this information will actually
solve the problem.

Also, when the machine boots, Linux recognizes the Future
Domain controller (1680) but it says something like
"Selection Failed" in the bootup chatter.  Also, there are
two other IDE HDs on this machine.

Gag!

Help me please, even if all you know is the
cyclinders/heads/sectors settings.

Thanks,

If you're using a csh-like shell, check your shell initialization files
(.cshrc, .tcshrc, /etc/csh.cshrc, etc.) for the command "stty" - it
prints the message you indicated if stdin isn't a terminal.  If you
find any, put a condition around them, as in this example:

    if ($?prompt) then
        stty erase ^H
    endif

Csh will leave the prompt variable empty if stdin isn't a terminal, so
the stty command would be skipped in that case.  Be sure to make the
check before you've set the prompt yourself.

Emacs is not a word processor/

Pounds shillings and pence

It all makes perfect sense/

Actually, if it gets the job done, and it makes you happy, why should you
care if it "doubles" your memory/resource usage. WFW and Windows is about
the same size as X/Emacs anyway... But Emacs is not a word processor, why
should it do word processing? (I haven't seen a major Emacs mode that does
it yet... it would probably be like WP on 18.5x... I haven't run Emacs V19
yet...) MS-DOS/Windows is not an operating system, why should anyone run it on
their computer?

Subject: Problems with Trident 8900CL chipset and DOSEMU...
Date: Sun, 22 Aug 1993 22:47:57 GMT

Howdy again!

I'm having trouble getting the dos emulator to work properly.  I've
searched through the FAQ and didn't really find anything about using
dosemu.  I've searched through the dosemu info files.  I've also
experimented and experimented and experimented and I'm sure it must be
something simple I'm doing wrong.

I believe my problem centers around my Trident video card which is
using the 8900CL chipset.  I believe this because commenting out the
video section makes things work, but with no decent graphics.  Even
just taking out the "graphics" keyword seems to make it work - but
still with no graphics (naturally).

I simply boot the system off the hdimage of the C: drive which comes
with the dosemu system.  Then I use the .sys file that comes with the
distribution to have a D: drive which is my normal DOS partition
mounted at /dos2.  I have the Trident card I mentioned above, with a
486 board and 4 megs of RAM with 16 megs of swap.

When I get it booted it'll come up with the Trident banner and then
lock up without even giving me a DOS prompt.  The area of the screen
where it locks up varies but when it does it (always), I never get a
DOS prompt.  I do get messages while in DOS trying to use graphically
oriented programs that say "new unknown video int 0x1012" and when
trying to start it it gives and error message and lists 'port 0x3f8'
along with a memory location.  Those come when I take out the graphics
keyword or just comment the entire video section out.

Has anybody gotten this emulator up and working correctly with a
Trident card using the chipset I have?  I know the chipsets given were
the et4000 and another Trident chipset other than mine but I'd imagine
there's gotta be a way to get this to work with graphics.  I've also
tried using the vgaon program and I get the same results, it just
locks up after the Trident banner.

If I didn't want the wifty MS-DOG graphics, everything'd work just fine.

If anybodies gotten this emulator to work with the same type of
Trident chipset I have, I'd appreciate any help... I'm enclosing a
copy of my config file.  If somebody see's anything with it, please
let me know...  I've tried everything I know (admittedly not much)...
Thanks again in advance...

I have Linux 0.99PL10 and GCC V2.4.5 installed on 386 with 4 MB ram and
8 MB swap partition.  GCC crashes almost always when it swaps to disk,
this happens after some 400 kB of swap space is used.  Funny thing is,
that GCC works if system is heavily loaded (some 1-2 MB is already used
for swapping before I run GCC).  
 
Other programs don't crash, when they use swap partition.  So I don't
think this is a hard disc malfunction.

Such a manual does exist, or at least pretty close to it. The Linux
Installation and Getting Started guide was just recently released by Matt
Walsh. He worked very hard on this book and came up with IMHO a very good
piece of literature to get newbies on their way. You really should check it
out. It is available in .ps, .dvi and stantard text mode. You will find the
book on tsx-11.mit.edu in the /pub/linux/docs/LDP directory (also available
on other known linux sites and mirrors). It goes through all the basics and
a general intro to unix and linux operation. It really is a fine book.

Looking for a SCSI local bus controller card that is compatible
with LINUX, any suggestions?  DTC?  I have looked at the compat.list
but don't see any local bus SCSI controllers on the list, are
there any that run in a compatibilty mode (say adaptec 15x, 17x)?
