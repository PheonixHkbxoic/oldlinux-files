Thanks for the exposition of casts; in the code in question, it wasn't
relevant.

:>>    switch ( (unsigned int) *(rpkt->dat+1) & ~1) {
:>>rpkt->dat is char*, it fetches the char into AL, then masks EAX and
:>>switches on that... leaving the upper 24 bits of EAX as garbage... so
:>>the switch always fails.

:This description conflicts slightly with itself.  `Masking EAX' makes
:the upper 24 bits *not* garbage, if the upper 24 bits are masked away,
:but not if only the low order bit is masked away.  I am not
:particularly conversant with Intel 80x86 assembly, but no sample
:compiler output appeared anyway.  I suspect that the compilers in
:question make `char's signed, so this means:

Sorry for the poor wording, I should include a larger code sample...
and "masking EAX" wasn't clear... Essentially, what the above is
turned into is
        EAX <- (rpkt->dat+1)            ;; EAX is a 32 bit register
        AL <- fetch char from EAX       ;; AL is the lower 8 bits of EAX
        EAX <- EAX & ~1                 ;; this is what I meant by
                                        ;; "masking EAX"

No sign extension occurs. The compiler used the lower 8-bits of AL to
hold the char value from the buffer, then "magically" used the whole
word as if it contained the value. Sign extending or zero extending
would have been fine -- but (rpkt->dat+1) == 0x1803f7, *(rpkt->dat+1)
== 0x3, ((unsigned int) *(rpkt->dat+1) & ~1) == 0x180302... which
isn't correct by *any* interpretation of the C language.

To reiterate, this was under SCO 3.2v4.0 and ODT 2.0... Thanks to my
complaints here, I'm now aware that some bugs of the above type have
been fixed, and that many of the other problems I had have also been
dealt with in the past year -- so I'll see about getting a newer
release (if it fixes the problems, I should be able to convince my
customers to upgrade as well.)
        Thanks for all of the commentary, especially the calmer and
more polite ones :-)

Tell us a little about what's on the CD!  What kernel is it?  Is it a SLS release
or what?

I've upgraded to a new SLS, or rather started all over with a
new one.

I have everything from the old version saved of tape. Further, I have
the disk space to dump that tape out. 

What is the easiest/best way to restore/recreate all the users &
user_specific files to the system? Sure, I can build run useradd, one
by one, fiddle around as needed, but I have to think There Is A Better
Way. What is it?

It is exactly libm.a did. It retuns NaN. Depending on your default 387

just out of curiostiy, can anyone give me an estimate of the relase

Hi, everyone,
    Could someone help me on the following problem?  
    I upgraded the kernel from PL12 alpha to PL12 release (8/15).  After the
compiling the kernel, the network does not works any more.  On every 'route'
command except adding 127.0.0.1, it gives the following error message:
     SIOCADDT: network unreachable
With the alpha version, everything runs fine, finger, telnet, ftp, X-windows
etc.  Any clue or suggestions?  
    Thanks.

   PL12 is stricter about routing. Darcy Bose's info works for PL10 and 11 only.

   The missing piece in all of this is the route to add the network. I'll use
   your numbers from the ifconfig:

   ifconfig eth0 131.155.110.55 broadcast 131.155.110.255 netmask 255.255.255.0
   route add 131.155.110.0 # this is the important one. It adds the net.
   route add default gw 133.155.110.X 1
   # add the loopback devices as specified.

Perhaps this works fine for some folks, but it doesn't work at all for me...
I have the following set up for eth0 (which is a WD8013)
  eth0      IP ADDR 128.155.48.100  BCAST 128.155.255.255  NETMASK 255.255.0.0

my NETWORK is 128.155.0.0 which adds without a complaint, i.e.
 route add 128.155.0.0
does not give any error messages back...

I try adding my gateway, i.e.
  route add default gw 128.155.X.X 1
and get "Network is unreachable" (well, I don't use the X's, they are actual numbers
which I would prefer not to reveal)

I try adding my machine, i.e.
 route add 128.155.48.100
and I get "Network is unreachable"

Apparently linux.99p12 doesn't like Class B networks at all...a minor comment is
made about this in the announcement, and it also mentions this is due to a bug
in 4.4.1 library, and that we should use Libc-4.4.2. One minor problem, WHERE
CAN I GET THE #$*&!$ library ? I've checked tsx-11, sunsite, and nic.funet.fi,
all to no avail...talk about frustrating!!!!!

Help????

I think the problem is Linux's weird behaviour when SIGCHLD is set to
SIG_IGN, child processes can mysteriously disappear in this case.  You
should make crond set SIGCHLD to SIG_DFL (which also means ignore the
signal) instead of SIG_IGN.

Here are my patches for the NetBSD version of ash, they also fix some
other bugs and add the pdksh test builtin.  For the Linux C library
you may need some additional patches.

I'd say that linux should be released as 1.0 when the networking code
becomes rock solid.  Net-2 is a drastic improvement (if one can get
it installed at all that is).  Everything else about linux is rock
solid, in my opinion.  Maybe in a couple of monthes, all the difficulties
people are having with Net-2 could be worked out.  Then, I'd call
it version 1.0.

Any guesses as to how many patch levels 0.99 will go up to?

Gene

It is good to have at least one machine with a decent 17" color monitor and
and graphic's accelerator card such as base on S3 928 or S3 801 chipset..

The price of these cards have dramatically drop over the last year.
You can get an S3 805 VLB for about $120 (S3 805 is the Vesa local bus
version of the S3 801) . What you get is near sparc II graphic's performance
and in the case of the S3 928 superior performance running on a 486DX266.


VLB cards are a cheap alternative for EISA and depending upon the board
manufacturer can allow more than 32MB of memory. There are also 
scsi VLB cards.


Cheers,
Amancio

"Nolinear" should only be needed on machines with S3 805 chipsets. This is
because unlike all other known vga chipsets the video framebuffer isn't at
0xA0000. What address it actually uses, nobody knowns (well the designers of
your card should know).  I hope in the future to be able to find the video
ram by poking all possible addresses, but so far this hasn't met with much
success.

>My Sparc 10 at work is still faster, but not by much.

The gap is narrowing.

I disagree.  The version number is no closer to 1.0 than it was last year.
It is still infinitely far from 1.0.  The *software* may be getting
pretty close to 1.0, but the version number is still infinitely far.
