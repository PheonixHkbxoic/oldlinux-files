You'll have to modify the kernel and/or 'C' libraries and/or compiler
to do the right things.

Need some help in determining the necessary settings for my video
hardware in my Xconfig. Here is my hardware:

Monitor
=======
GoldStar Model 1453 Plus VGA Monitor
Horizontal Sync:  31.5   35.2   35.5   kHz
Vertical   Sync:   56   60   70   87   Hz

Video Card
==========
manual has 'VW1001' on its cover.
diagram in manual shows chipset as being 'WD90C11'
the labels on the diskettes that came with the card say 'PARADISE 1C
VGA'.

I've looked in the database, but there are no references to 'PARADISE'
or 'Western Digital' (which is what the 'WD' in WD90C11 stands for,
right???)
The card has 512K of video memory.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I hope you are very good in intel386 and i860 assembler.
This is the first thing you have to port, and this is very more difficult
than porting the C-sources.

If you are not very good in both assemblers, start with learning them.

The current generation certainly know "Sonic", "Nintendo" and "CD-ROM",
but seem to missing out on home micros and the joys of programming in
BASIC :-), like when I had a CBM64 and BBC.

Consequently there are more students going for IT and business computing,
and generally software application, and less for software development disciplines.

But a hell of a lot of people don't want to understand them, they just want
to be able to *use* them. The point is that there is a *big* difference between
using and understanding. In the end people want to use applications to help
them do their job better, and are not concerned with the underlying o/s.

It's a catch-22..., software developers want everything to
be consistent 'cause it makes our job easier and more productive, while actual
people who use the applications want them to do different things different
ways. How do you get round that one ?

If people really want to understand the o/s eg. Linux, then take the
time to find out, mostly by playing with it. You can't document something
which essentially requires you to make the mistakes to actually understand
why you're doing something a particular way.
But then you could also need to know C programming, how and why memory
is there, how and why processes swap, what the processor does in what
order, how the processor is fabricated, electrons, etc...

It all comes down to finding a level of understanding which you are
comfortable with. 

There is no complete easy-to-understand guide to computing, you've got
to build up knowledge over considerable amounts of time by reading *everything*,
magazine articles, technical manuals, new-user-guides, etc.
Same goes for specific things like Linux.

Someone said the computer jargon should be minimised...
Ok, you try doing maths in plain English with all those stupid symbols
removed. Annoying isn't it ???

it's fundamental, so people in the industry know what you're talking about...

ie. Intel 486DX instead of "that black plastic box made by Intel with a
    chip inside with a cache and a floating point unit, and is the
    successor to the one before which didn't have..."

gimme a break...

Shouldn't this be in comp.os.linux.psychology ? sorry,
right, how do you install LILO ?  :-) :-)

No problem. Getting the FAQ is a good idea though. It's in rewrite right
now. However there have been a few HOWTO posting floating around the news
groups. They may have some helpful info. Also if you can ftp you can get
useful FAQ info from tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux and sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux.
These are the primary US archives for Linux stuff.

It's not that hard to compile povray for Linux.  In the
system-specific file, (unix.c or xwindows.c), one must comment out the
matherr() function by placing comment marks (or #if 0, or whatever) at
the start and end.

No alterations of the Makefile are needed.

If there's interest in having a POV binary available, I would be
willing to upload one to Sunsite in about two weeks (Until then, my
access is limited without FTP).

Hello Linuxers!
I tried to change den polling printer driver to an interrupt driven.
I changed following:
struct lp_struct lp_table[] = {
      { 0x3bc, 0, 0, LP_INIT_CHAR, LP_INIT_TIME, LP_INIT_WAIT, NULL, NULL,},
      { 0x378, 7, 0, LP_INIT_CHAR, LP_INIT_TIME, LP_INIT_WAIT, NULL, NULL,},
               ^ here from 0 to 7

      { 0x278, 0, 0, LP_INIT_CHAR, LP_INIT_TIME, LP_INIT_WAIT, NULL, NULL,},
};

And now: it doesn't work,of course, if it would work I wouldn't post this
:-)
lpc says daemon is running and printing, but my eyes and my ears say it's
not printing.
If I change back to polling with cntl?? /dev/lp1 0, printing works again.

Any hint?

Domain SCSI adapters are the same for both ISA and microchannel.

The FAQ should not say that Linux does not support microchannel.  It

Hello Dave,

I'm the guy who posted the 209 Meg Seagates.
I saw your post to c.o.l that you saw some Adaptec 1540B's advertised
in Processor Magazine for $100.00.  Could you please post the
name of the Advertiser and their phone number.  $100.00 is a great 
price right now (and I have been searching for 2 weeks
now for them) so if you can give us a source for $100.00 that would be
great.  (Personally I doubt that they exist today).  I have seen
other posts on various newsgroups by people who saw Ads of this sort
but when I finally found the source the Adaptecs didn't exist (either
they were all sold out or something like that.  The funny thing was
they *ALWAYS* had something more expensive in stock that I could
have.  They may very well have once existed (if you got one from them
at that price they certainly did).  However, my experience with Ads of
this sort is that they usually have a very limited quantity and they
are using that *LOW* price to get people to call.  When you call they
don't have the Adaptecs but they have something they can upsell you.
So I will be VERY suprised if they really exist.  In any case,
it shouldn't take more than a few minutes to page through some of your
old Processor Mags or even your most recent edition.  That way you can
save all of us alot of headache in searching.  BTW, if they aren't
advertised in the most recent edition they are probably all gone.
Thus, if you threw out all of your old ones or misplaced them you can
just look in the most recent edition.  If they still exist at that
price an advertiser would be crazy NOT to advertise them in the most
recent issue since it would bring in hundreds of new customers.  If its
not in there just let us know and we will know that they aren't
available at that price any more.

Thanks For Your Help.

Sincerely,
Dr. John V. Jaskolski

P.S.  This is what I love about the Internet and the Linux Community:

Yeah, I can't figure that out either.  Boy, if only there was a

The difference that you see (about 40K) can be due to the fact 
that linux allocates space to put information ABOUT the file system
buffers in. Thus you'd expect around 32 bytes times 2500 more buffers =
80k more memory allocated.... (I don't know the actual size of the
buffer_head structure, maybe it`s 16, and my calculation simply comes
out correct, or maybe just after boot you used to have around 1200
buffers more than is indicated when you type free. The buffer_heads
are never freed. They simply take up a little memory, and you'll have to
live with that. It won't be more than just a few kilobytes (Never more
than 1/256 of your total memory).)
