Folks,

        I just put in the ALPHA IN2000 SCSI driver into my Linux 0.99
pl12 kernel and I have a problem with interrupt request assignment.
According to the IN2000 documentation, I should set up the card for
no-interrupt if I wanted to use MSDOS 5.0+ for multiple (more than 2)
disk drives.  The IN2000 driver expects an interrupt to be assigned to
the card for use in Linux.  Since it is desirable to be able to access my
SCSI drive either from MSDOS or from Linux, I am at a loss.  I certainly
don't want to have to open up box to flip the DIP switch every time I
switch between MSDOS and Linux.

        Is this a problem altogether with SCSI drivers, in that MSDOS 5.0
requires the controllers for additional disk drives not to use
interrupts, whereas UNIX systems do want them to have separate
interrupts?  Does MSDOS (or BIOS SCSI drivers) use some kind of
timer-based polling mechanisms in its support for 2+ disk drives?  Is
there some kind of solution that would accomodate both mechanisms without
me having to open up the box to flip the switch?  Obviously, other SCSI
controllers may have software-programmable interrupt assignment so that
this manual switch may not be needed.  However, I am using the IN2000...

        All responses are appreciated.

        I am a new Linux user and have just installed Linux on 
my machine.  I have an ATI Wonder XL24 video card and have used
the clock settings suggested by the documentations.  However,
I am currently using the VESA video modes for my ADI Microscan
4E monitor.  It has a vertical refresh rate at 70Hz at 1024x768
and would like to utilize this.  Does anyone know what available
mode settings are there for this monitor.

        Secondly, I was playing around with OpenWindows yesterday
and found that after running OpenWindows or TWM and exiting back
out to the operating system, my video is lost.  I get a bunch of
vertical white lines across my screen and cannot see anything.
  
        If anyone has any ideas on resolving these two problems,
please EMAIL me at jchiang@ee.ubc.ca.

Hi !

..when I rsh commands between my 2 LinuX boxes I notices some programs
complaining 'bout wrong pathes/directories...

I think the problem can be put in one line:

        rsh nepal echo $\HOME $\PWD

which gives

        / /home/yeti

as output...
(not really, as /home/yeti is linked back via NFS to my other machine and
the real output contains the expanded link...)

But $HOME should give /home/yeti (or my personal link)...

What's wrong, where should I search ?

bye
    Ulf.

Hi again...

Sorry --- I forgot some lines 'bout my software running here...

..it's Slackware 1.1.0 on both machines...

..maybe that''s a hint...

Bye again

David Jeske, jeske@ux4.cso.uiuc.edu, back in October suggested that he was

current status however.

Subject: Some Problems Installing SLS 1.02
Date: 2 Nov 93 20:16:13 GMT

Hello:

        I have finally gotten my machine to a working state! What follows 
are some problems that I encountered, that may or may not be unique to my
machine (386-40DX, 4 MEG RAM, 340 MEG HD)

        I first installed SLS under one partition and quickly decided that 
I liked linux enough to warrant getting rid of OS2-1.02, along with its boot
manager, which were taking two of my four available partitions. Therefore, 
I was now able to create a separate /, /usr, and a swap partition instead
of a swap file. Upon installing with doinstall /dev/hda2 /dev/hda3 /usr,
and answering to the option that would do a full install, I ran out of space
on /root, and /root/usr. What I had to do was a mini install, followed by a
sysinstall -series <series>. This worked just fine and all of my packages are
installed so far with the exception of Xwindows. 

        Secondly, after having everything installed, and beginning to do a 
make on various packages, ie: elm, smail, cnews, etc, I kept hanging on a make
no matter how small, some makes had taken all night! I had done a 'free'   
command, but someone had told me that there may have been a bug that free was 
reporting erroneous info. So I ignored the Sawp: 0 0 , messages given by free.
My /etc/fstab read (the first column) like this:

                /dev/hda2
                /dev/hda3
                /dev/hda4
                proc

        With the above and when I did a mount -a a, I was informed that their
was no swap space avail, remedy with the following: <blah blah>. I changed
the fstab to read like this:

                /dev/hda2
                /dec/hda3
                proc
                /dev/hda4

        Now when I did a mount -a, all of my memory showed with a free command
and mounted right away!Seems weird to me, but just thought I should mention
this to all of you.

Hi:

        I have managed to sucessfully install SLS on my 386DX40, on two
partitions. However, / was 15% full and /usr was 100% full when I did a  
df. I created / with 80meg, /usr with 90meg. So I began to do another
initial install deciding to give / 50meg, /usr 120meg. When I do a mke2fs
on my first partition, everything is fine, when I do the same on /usr,     
partition /dev/hda3, I get the following msg upon completion:

mke2fs: Unable to find a block for inode table.

        When I try to do a doinstall /dev/hda2 /dev/hda3 /usr, I get this
message after it starts to install its first pkg:

Installing faq...tar:could not create usr/local/lib/menus/FAQ.z: not a directory

        I am stumped, it appears as if my filesystem is full?, but I am begin-
ning from scratch. Do I need to do some type of format before I start over again? 

        BTW, I have tried also creating my swap device before and after my 
doinstall /dev/hda2 /dev/hda3 /usr routine, with mkswap -c /dev/hda4 15180.

        I am changing partition id to Linux EXT (selection 83) for 
/dev/hda2 /dev/hda3, and Linux swap (selection 82) for /dev/hda4.

        I would appreciate all help. BTW I did read the install guide, which
was very helpful (thank you Matt, let me know if you need a hard copy in ps
format?). Hopefully I can resolve this matter soon so that I can get back to
installing elm, uucp, smail.

Help please ;-(
