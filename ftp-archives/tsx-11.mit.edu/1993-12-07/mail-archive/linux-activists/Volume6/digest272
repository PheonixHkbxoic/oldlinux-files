Starting with the recognition that WP is available on the widest range of
systems, which gives it a tremendous headstart, it has a number of serious
problems.  I have seen signed postings from a guy who used truss on SVR4 to
observe wp opening a config file 500 times while it was starting up.  This
is consistent with the startup speed under X.  Also WP fails totally to
understand how X and UNIX printspooling are supposed to work.  If you bring
up a dialog box on the X version and then dismiss the box, it repaints the
entire screen a couple of times rather than restoring the save-under
region.  This is a dismal failure and really gets in the way of trying to
use it.  Three of us here with a total of over 20 years of UNIX experience
still cannot get WP to print to all of our lpd printers after dozens of
hours of effort.  That has been real productive.  I now have the port on all
my printers set to disk.  At least I can print from the shell after I save
them.

The one thing that makes me support WP is that I can use it over a terminal
and trade docs with the Windoze or DOS or VMeSs users.

This is like saying a Ferrari is a wagon (they both have wheels and someone
can ride in both).  Term allows you to set up a socket over a modem
connection that looks like the sockets that allow all sorts of network stuff
to take place such as telnet, nntp,ftp, irc, and even X (tcp services but
not udp services, so no NFS or talk).

Also like a Ferrari, it is very powerful but occasionally kinda cranky.  I
would not characterize it as robust.  I use it several hours a day.  I now
have 4 xterms on my home machine (a SPARC) displaying stuff running on the
Sun server at school.

Subject: [Q]'s Gateway/1542/Linux/Tamu problems ?
Date: 29 Sep 1993 02:01:12 GMT

Hi, ia have a couple of questions on the following config:

PC: Gateway 3SX-33 (386-33) 4MB RAM
    Adaptec 1542 
    1 SCSI Drive

OS: LINUX: TAMU.99p12 release 

Partitions: 1=DOS; 2=Swapfile (type 82); 3=Linux ext2fs (type 83)


1)  What is the proper device configuration for the "PS/2" style
    microsoft mouse that comes with the Gateway for X ? 
    I used the following lines in my Xconfig file

      ps/2    "/dev/psaux"  
      emulate3botton

    despite these settings, I get no mouse activity.. (frozen X) :( 

    I have also tried a 3 button logitech serial using /dev/ttys0.
    this results in a pointer locking up in the upper left corner 
    of the screen.  Arrg 
    
2)  [TAMU]: Where is the "mouse" utility advertized to be in 
    /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/v1.1/tst/mouse ??? Unless the Installation
    guide is wrong, I did not have such directory ! is there a site that
    carries this utility ?

3)  I have installed bootactv and LILO on the system and I cannot boot from
    the harddisk.  LILO is installed on partition 3 (/dev/sda3 ext2fs) 
    
    When booting, the boot [1-4]: prompt says:
    Invalid ! 
    
    when partition 3 is selected.  I have tried different combinations
    of partitions, and can't seem to get around this.  The only way I can
    boot is using the disk (LILO) and <Shift>  boot:harddisk root=/dev/sda3 
    Suggestions ? 
    

I have been through most FAQ's I could find, and the is not much
on TAMU specific problems. (I whish there was :) I also saw a few
people having boot problems with 1542, but their problems seemed different.

Thanks (in advance)

I too had a problem on two machines dying at the adlib sound card message.

novell ne2000 card. The other was a no-name black box 40 mhz 386 with an
adaptec scsi card and a _novell_ne200_card_. NONE of the adresses or irq's
appeared to conflict. I solved my problem by changeing the novell card to
use 300h and irq5, (supposedly a non-standard setting, but it works).
The troubleshooting was vexing..different kernels..6 mchines...differnent
versions...screw with the hardware jumpers...sleep at last!

I have:
        - 33 MHZ TI 486 DLC with math copro
        - 4 MG RAM
        - UN-1072 I/O Card (Serial,parallel,game,hard disk, floppy)

My problem:

        On booting from the boot floppy I select the ramdisk option
from LILO.  It goes on identifying my hardware and then states that
INIT: Version 2.0 is booting.  The boot at this point hangs.

There is local echo on the console, and my function keys for virtual
terminals seem to work, but I do not get the SLS login prompt

Help ?

Automated?  You mean you want something else to put the floppies in?
GNU tar is supposed to handle multi-volume archives, so it's as automatic

Certainly sounds like memory problems to me, try removing 4mb of RAM and

Is there anyone out there who has actually gotten the trantor SCSI alpha

recompile the kernel, all steps are done and I can verify the new code gets
compiled, AND I forced the code to look for my board at $CC000 and expect
no IRQ. BUT although this is done I get no recognition of the SCSI card. 
I assume that including the generic SCSI in addition to the T128 Alpha

I need advice on how to install Linux (basically), and I also need a

I'm also a newcomer to the Linux world, I've had it installed for five
days now, and a lot of that has been spent on Kermit and term.
What I want to do is attach a socket at uni to a socket on linux, or
more specifically, to a login prompt.

I've got term going fine, so that I can trsh back and forth. Then I tried
to use tredir to connect the sockets setup. So from uni I did
        tredir 12345 23
thinking that this should attach the remote port 12345 to my telnet
port. Also I tried 12345 by itself, hoping it would just create a login.
When trying to connect from uni, (telnet <local> 12345) I get
a connection but then nothing happens. Is there something wrong with
my telnet connection? It works just fine when I telnet localhost 23
from home.
Also, when I trsh back into linux, some characters (in particular line
feeds) don't get through. According to the man, I can set up my
~.term/termrc file to escape these characters. How do you do that?
Is termrc executed before an rsh is set up or what?
Also, after I run tredir, my trsh dies (freezes). Is this supposed
to happen?

Yours, in an effort to avoid suid trshs,
Craig.

Those benchmark are funny. I think they highly depend on the
application used.

Those who compare Usenet news unpacking will
have a winner with linux. SUNOS is does synchronous file
creation, not linux. This means that if you creat a large number
of files, linux will goes faster than sunos, which sync the directory
to disk for each new file. SUNOS will be more reliable however.
Off course, this is apple and banana.

One real life test I am doing often is zip and gzip of large
file. The ELC (33 mhz sparc) is about twice as fast as a 486dx33
(both with 16 megs ram). gzip is 30% faster on the Sparc.

On a 486 66, zip is about the same speed, but it seem that SUNOS
I/O (SCSI) is faster than IDE I/O on Linux. Much faster, so to
crunch about 40 megs of DOS .obj file is 50 % faster on a Sparc ELC
than the 486 66.

Again, I guess it hardly depend of the type of the application
you are using.

One thing that really suprise me, it that people are getting
better benchmark on Linux for floatting point. This is difficult
to believe. Linux as little to do here. A 486 is not a screamer
for floatting point ... by far. Benchmark publish by Unix Review
show that a Sparc Classic outperform a 486 50 everywhere by almost
2 except on some integer test where the sparc was sligtly
slower. For disk I/O, the Sparc was much faster. They used a High end
486 50 PC with retail for about the same price as the Sparc.

Just more confusion I guess!
