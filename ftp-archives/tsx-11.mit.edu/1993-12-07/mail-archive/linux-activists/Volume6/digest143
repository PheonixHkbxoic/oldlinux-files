        That's neat. I've got a shared machine (lilo kicks in dos
(w/FTP Software tcp)+windows, linux, SCO, and shortly Solaris x86 and
UnixWare...) and just found out that UnixWare *only* supports
programmed I/O on the 3c503. If you're jumpered for shared memory, it
can't even *find* the card...
        I'm still going to hack up an external switch on the jumper so
I can toggle it when I want to run UnixWare. Supposedly they're trying
to get better drivers for the next release (around 1/1/94?) but for
now, they just can't handle it. (*all* of the other os's currently on
the machine work fine...)

The Compudyne Subnote does use the Databook TCIC-2/N controller; the
nice people at databook are actually on the net, and answered my
randomly directed email by dropping technical specs in the mail and
offering to send some tools to work from. I should have them any day
now. I do know that the Databook controller is very different from the
Intel one, it uses a "register indirect" rather than a "memory window"
model. Still sounds like it will be easy to code for once I have the
data.

Your easiest option is probably to use SOSS (on an FTP server near you...)
that was created for almost this purpose. 

Its intent is to provide NFS service to enable UNIX boxes to mount Netware
volumes. 

The result is this:

        1. You need a dedicated DOS box to run SOSS. This machine will 
           need to be logged into the Netware server as supervisor.

        2. You will in fact run tar on the Linux box which has mounted
           the Netware volumes via the SOSS box.

Hope this helps.

Thanks for the information, but it now appears that wasn't the problem

SLS 1.01 with no problems, but SLS 1.03 wouldn't work well.  I installed
repeatedly with different options, but always got some file system
problems.  I tried e2fsck -fvat and it couldn't or wouldn't fix some of
the problems.  I finally got a good installation by using Slackware
instead of SLS.  I even tried it twice to make sure I didn't just get
lucky, but Slackware looks stable on my system where SLS had continuous
file system errors.  I have no idea why the difference, but I am not
going to try SLS 1.03 again on my system.  Now I just need to get the
networking and X setup again.

I use BSD/386 from BSDi - it's based on the BSD Net-2 release.
It costs $1000 with source ( $595 ish ) without and is proving
to be a reliable system. I'm pretty sure it will run on a 
Gateway box - BSDi has a 60 day no questions asked for a full
refund warranty if is does not. You can ftp to bsdi.com, there's
are hardware compatibility file in there listing system configs
people are actually using.

If I were to recomend BSD/386 as highly as I would like I would
probably get flamed for using the net for commercial purposes!

[ NB - my only relationship with BSDi is that of happy customer. ]

That's not it. In a VT100 emulation, say kermit, you can't resize your
window, the mouse does nothing on the remote machine and you can't open
several xterms. Sure, you need to install a (tiny)x server on the remote
system (but that's not a bad idea, I think).

Subject: netmask problems ?
Date: 19 Aug 1993 23:18:24 +0300


I am trying to configure a linux machine (lx99pl12, net2: from SLS 1.03)
to see the ethernet, and I have problems with the way it sees the network.

My ethernet data are:
IPADDR=147.52.128.90
NETWORK=147.52.128.0
ROUTER=147.52.128.92
NETMASK=255.255.254.0
The netmask is as above, with the last (non zero) number 254, not 255.
I think this is what makes things go wrong (especially on the "route add")!
Has anyone used linux with a netmask consisting of not only 0s and 255s?
Are there any pointers what to do, to hook the machine to the network?

Here is an example of the problems I have:

"ifconfig eth0" gives:
eth0      IP ADDR 147.52.128.90  BCAST 147.52.129.255  NETMASK 255.255.254.0
          MTU 1500  METRIC 0  POINT-TO-POINT ADDR 0.0.0.0
          FLAGS: 0x0043 ( UP BROADCAST RUNNING )

"netstat -rn" initially contains only the lo interface:
Kernel routing table
Destination net/address   Gateway address           Flags RefCnt    Use Iface
127.0.0.1                 *                         UH         0     86 lo

but "ping 147.52.128.90" works.  Why?  Where does it find the route?

Now the real problems.
"route add 147.52.128.0 eth0" responds "SIOCADDRT: Network is unreachable".
Why ?  The network is there.  If I remove the /etc/networks file and I
use the same command, it adds the line (marking is as a host):
"netstat -rn" gives:
147.52.128.0              *                         UH         0      0 eth0
127.0.0.1                 *                         UH         0     86 lo

I tried a different (and wrong) netmask:

# ifconfig eth0 down
# ifconfig eth0 up
# ifconfig eth0 netmask 255.255.255.0 147.52.128.90
# ifconfig
lo        IP ADDR 127.0.0.1  BCAST 127.255.255.255  NETMASK 255.255.255.0
          MTU 2000  METRIC 0  POINT-TO-POINT ADDR 0.0.0.0
          FLAGS: 0x0049 ( UP LOOPBACK RUNNING )

eth0      IP ADDR 147.52.128.90  BCAST 147.52.255.255  NETMASK 255.255.0.0
          MTU 1500  METRIC 0  POINT-TO-POINT ADDR 0.0.0.0
          FLAGS: 0x0041 ( UP RUNNING )
The netmask address (and broadcast address) is wrong, it ignored
the one given and used the class B netmask.  I correct it using
"ifconfig eth0 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 147.52.129.255".

"route add 147.52.128.0 eth0 ; netstat -nr" gives
147.52.128.0              *                         UN         0      0 eth0
127.0.0.1                 *                         UH         0     87 lo
and I can telnet to 147.52.128.* hosts, but not to 147.52.129.* hosts,
as expected.
Again, it does not accept connections to networks (like "default", or
whatever is on the /etc/networks file).
This approach is the closest to a workibg solution, but the netmask
is wrong and the visible network is not the right one.  Again, I cannot
send anything to hosts not in my subnet.  What should I do ?

If you have any suggestions, please send me mail or post.

thanks in advance

it a different chip), and if it is supported (or compatible with

I tried the card and I could not run XFree (neither autodetecting

Subject: Setting IRQ or Networking with PL12
Date: 19 Aug 1993 22:36:06 +0200

Hi,

I've just started with Linux downloading SLS 1.03.
When /etc/rc.net performs:

  route add xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
      
I receive an error message:  

  SIOCADDRT: Network is unreachable

After verifying all (hope) /etc files concerned, I've taken closer look
at the screen messages appearing during system start.

Among other lines I've found:

  plip0: configured for parallel port at 0x3bc, IRQ 5.
  plip1: configured for parallel port at 0x378, IRQ 7.
  plip2: configured for parallel port at 0x278, IRQ 2.

and below:

  eth0: WD8003-old using IRQ 9 with shared memory at 0x80000-0x81fff


My ether card is WD8003 compatible (tested previously with PC-NFS) and
may be set up for interrupts range 2-7. Currently it is preset for IRQ 5.

  1. As I cannot change setting to IRQ 9, should I recompile the kernel?
  2. Is IRQ 9 above a result of some kind of autoIRQ or the driver was forced
     to this interrupt number and I should force it now to IRQ 5 (for example)
  3. What about plip using my preferred IRQ 5 - how to disable or change it's
     setting? And also what about IRQ 2, why plip uses it while there is
     a 8259 cascade (IMHO)?

Somebody can say: try it!   No way - some header files are missing in
latest SLS distribution. Up to now I'm aware of stdarg.h and float.h.
I don't know more as `make dep' do not want to go further.

Another thing: stddef.h is not visible to `make dep' (gcc) even if I have
famous symbolic links to /usr/src/linux/include/linux and ...asm.


Thanks in advance for your suggestions, hints.

Please answer directly to me. I don't want to oversee the response.

After many trials, I finally got UUCP mail working on my system.  Mail/mailx 
works fine, but when I try to reply to a message sent to username@mysite.UUCP
it batches a file to my smart host username@mysite.sea.wa.us!  I know that
this address is part of the original configuration (SLS release), and I
have edited my config files to reflect my site's information instead -but
it still does it.  Any ideas/comments are much appreciated.  My config
files are as follows:

---
/usr/local/lib/elm/elm.rc
 
#
#------------------------ global elm.rc file ------------------
#
# this expects any global aliases in /usr/local/lib/elm/aliases.text
#
# the following might have to be used to run on another system
# see the Elm Reference Guide for details
#
# you probably also want to set the visible_name parameter in
# /usr/local/lib/smail/config if you use smail3.1.28
#
# this is the unqualified hostname
hostname = midland.UUCP
#
# this is the local domain
hostdomain = .UUCP
#
# this is the fully qualified hostname
hostfullname = midland.UUCP
#
editor=vi
 
---
 
/usr/local/lib/smail/config
 
#
hostname=midland.uucp:midland
#
postmaster=mbrinkho
#
trusted_users=root:uucp:mbrinkho:daemon
#
# domains we belong to
visible_domain=midland.uucp:uucp
#
# who we're known as (fully-qualified-site-name)
visible_name=midland.UUCP
#
# who we go through (UUCP Neighbor)
smart_path=mmedia

Well I got one response from mikek@apl.washington.edu who said the following:

I have done this and hopefully the problem of portmap zombies will
disappear :-)

Try putting 
  ALTLOCK=cua1
in your /etc/default/uugetty

According to the getty manpage:
        ALTLOCK=line
              Uugetty  uses  this  parameter  to lock an alternate
              device, in addition to the one it  is  attached  to.
              This  is  for  those systems that have two different
              device names that refer to the same  physical  port;
              e.g.   /dev/tty1A  vs.  /dev/tty1a,  where  one uses
              modem control and the other doesn't.  See  the  sec-
              tion on UUGETTY for more details.  The default is to
. 
. 
. 
       While  waiting  for carrier detect, Uugetty will check for
       lockfiles every  30  seconds.   If  lockfiles  are  found,
       uugetty  will  exit,  and init will respawn another getty.
       This allows the modem to be  reinitialized  after  another
       process has used the modem.


This oughta work for ya...
