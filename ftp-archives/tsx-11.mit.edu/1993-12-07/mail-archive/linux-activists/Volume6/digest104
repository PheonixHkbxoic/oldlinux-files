I don't know if this is your problem or not, but there is a problem
in the rc.net startup file with SLS 1.3.  Specifically, the "route"
command no longer supports the device parameter.  I found this with
the SLS test release, because my system locked up shortly after
booting.  By *properly* calling route, my system lived.  All I had
to do was remove the $IPDEV parameter from the first two route calls,
and the "lo" parameter from the last one.

ALSO:  There are bugs in the kernel file route.c.  I've sent some
early, minor changes to Ross Biro and Fred N. van Kempen (are these
still the right people?  Did you get them?).  I've gone further,
though and made some major changes to handle non-octet netmasks
(our netmask here is 255.255.252.0), and also to fix some other
routing problems.  Who gets these?  Ross and Fred?

Good hunting,
Rick

All,
        I am trying to get X-Windows to work in 1024x768 (256 colors). It works 
to a point, but the screen is offset to the left side (about 2 inches) and I
cannot move it over to the right with monitor contols.

I have a Commodore 1960 multiscan monitor.  Here are the specs for the Monitor:

                RESOLUTIONS: 1024x768 (can be interlaced)
                             800x600   720x400
                             640x480   640x350

                COMPATIBILITY: 8514/A      VGA
                               Super VGA

                SYNCRONIZATION
                        HORIZONTAL:   31.5/35.5 KHz
                        VERTICAL:     50 ~ 87 Hz

                BANDWIDTH:   45MHz

                DOT PITCH:   .28mm (?needed info?)

        I want 1024x768 non-interlaced and 800x600 configurations, but since I
do not quite understand the VideoModes.doc, could someone help me here? It
would be a great help and to the fact I will be showing Linux (hehe) to ISU's
Director of Computer Resources and faculty (?nervous -- a tiny bit).

Subject: X hanging with net-2 SLIP
Date: 13 Aug 93 02:54:11 GMT

I'm running linux 0.99pl11 with net-2 stuff and Xfree 1.3.  I'm able to get 
a SLIP connection up and running and it works fine.  I can also run X and 
telnet into a remote machine, and then run remote X applications on my local 
(linux) X server.  This works fine most of the time, but then sometimes when 
I'm trying to run an X application off the remote machine, my server will 
hang.  I can't even exit the server with the CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE.  I've found 
no pattern as to when my system will hang.  I can run Xgas and Xneko remotely, 
and sometimes even Matlab.  However, sometimes my server will hang while 
receiving large volumes of data (I can see my modem's RD data blinking).  
Also, when I exit X and return to text mode, the characters are all messed up. 
Thanks for any suggestions.

        If you have patches to allow "non-standard" (i.e. with field values 
that are not either 0 or 255) netmasks, please post or make them available for 
upload, or send them to the current TCP/IP developers (but you still might 
want to make an alpha version available for those that need it now).

P.S. I don't think Ross Biro is with Linux TCP/IP anymore. I'm not sure 
who is. From what I heard, net-2 is still a little rough around the edges, 
this is because it is so new, but it should end up being better than net-1 was, 
since it is a new start.

P.P.S. Can we have net-2 renamed? It sounds that "other" net-2, from BSD...

P.P.P.S. what does linux do if one uses a strange netmask? Panic? Hang? 
Route packets wrong? (possibly treating it as a class A, B, or C)?

If you read the documentation, it says that you can only make the

   Sunando send me his sources and I must say this version of ash works quite
   well under Linux after using Sunando's new Makefile (the original Makefile
   was absolutely unusable under Linux).

   It runs indeed configure scripts very well except it cannot do `cd .' :-)

   It has however some serious bug (I think): many shell scripts from INN and
   smail use commands in backquotes (`date`). When running these scripts from
   the command line, they work fine, but when run from crond they hang at the
   first `...` command, consuming 100% CPU time. This is also the case for
   /etc/rc scripts. I started using debugging traces but haven't been able
   yet to find the problem.

Apparently this happens only under Linux:

$ cat > t
#!/bin/sh
pwd
cd .
pwd
set `date`
echo $1
$ chmod 755 t
$ t
/usr/home/oleg
/usr/home/oleg
Thu
$ 

   When this bug has been fixed, ash will be a good (and small: 66K) /bin/sh
   substitute for Linux.

   I'm at home now but tomorrow I'll try the find out who the current
   maintainers of NetBSD's ash are so I can report the bug.

Not true!  I have Linux running on a Compaq Contura 4/25, and there are no
problems with the power management.  If the hard disk spins down, you get a
diagnostic message ("Unexpected hard drive interrupt") but no problems occur.
The message can be compiled out of the kernel or directed to an unused VC.
Even the hibernate feature, which saves memory to disk and powers down the
machine, works with Linux (though I do a 'sync' first).  I have tried
hibernating in the midst of X Windows, and return as advertised right were I
left off.

The only management issue on my laptop is how I can manage to pare down all
those MS Windows applications, drivers, fonts, .INIs and .PIFs to achieve a
bare-bones installation while still maintaining compatibility in an emergency.

P.S.  The Contura is the only notebook I have seen with the ~` key (a Unix
essential) near the 1, instead of next to the !@#$%^&* space bar.

I have had some sudden crash with 99p12-Alpha lately.

I am mostly logged into my machine via a vt100-terminal attached to the
serial-port, and lately, sometimes when I wrote/read news/mail the machine
stood still.

Due to the screen-saver I did not see the cause, so I turned it off, and
oh wonder, there was no kernelpanic-message nor anything...

Now, when I left it alone for an hour, there was a message on the screen
 Aug 12 16:55:08 (none): --MARK--

this was there twice, and "last" reveiled that there was noone logged into
my machine, so it must have come from within...

I have the scsi-diagnostics-routines compiled into the kernel as offered
by the make config.

How can I track down this problem?

Well that's actually pretty easy to fix I think; you just have to change the
middle two numbers of the horizontal data (ie the first set of four numbers).
To move the display left decrease them, to move it right increase them. To
move it two inches will take quite a big change though.

FYI, I just installed SLS 1.03 and grabbed emacs-19.18 from off of the net.
With that setup I had to do the following:

After running the configure command:
remove the -lipc from the Makefile

I commented out the line CTOR_LIST in src/emacs.c /* Maybe better to undef it as above? */
#define HAVE_MKDIR and #define HAVE_RMDIR in src/sysdep.c (I think that was the file)
#define HAVE_FREXP in src/floatfns.c (again as above)

run make

It will puke when xmakefile in the src directory tries to link in -lipc again.
So, remove the -lipc from xmakefile and it should be just fine now.

(I hope that's all of them.)
