Subject: help newbie with setting up "ps" command

Linux users:

I just installed linux on my PC.  Many of the basics seem to work
fine: vi, sed, awk, who...  but when I attempt to monitor processes
with the ps command  I get the familiar message that I have to mount
/proc.  The system tells me to make sure /proc exists (and it does) and
to add the line "/proc /proc proc defaults" to /etc/fstab  (which I did
and then rebooted.  But... when I "ps" I get the same message.  Can
one of you solve this mystery for me.

Also.. what is the /bin/hostname file about.  On the bootup disk
I get one that has a bunch of non-ascii stuff and I get a hostname
of "softland"; my installed LINUX is missing this file.  Can I make one,
and how do I do it?

Lastly...  And this question demonstrates my lack of attention span for
reading documentation...  What terminal programs are available in the
basic set-up?  I would like to dialup my university account thru
LINUX (kermit or z-modem file transfer available) on my internal
"hayes compatible" modem.  

thanks in advance for any help (or flames...)

This is the problem I think; you can't run the colour server with only 256k 
of video RAM... (well that's not quite true, but you certainly can't run it at
a useful resolution).

Does the mono driver work?

But when rebooting, it hang during the SCSI probe.  I had the AHA 1542B

Are there many applications (word processing, spreadsheet, utils, database

   I'll bet the problem is that while the directories have u+rwx
permissions, they're not actually *owned* by the users in question.

   Do a 'ls -al' in the /home directory and see who the owners are.
If they're not correct, then use:

   chown user directory

and
   chgrp group directory

and you should be OK.

Free UNIX clone for 386/486 class machines. Source code available. POSIX
complient.

>  Will it run MSDOS/WINDOWS  and/or MAC software? 
DOS - Has an emulator (DOSEMU) runs most non protected mode programs. Not
      read good for games.
WINDOWS - WINE is the Linux Windows Binary Executive project. Very young
          with no Alpha release yet
MAC - Not that I know of.

Yes. Not at the same time of course. There are several boot loaders that
will allow you to choose which OS to boot.

>  What are some of it's strengths and weaknesses?  
Strengths - many
Free. Source available. Uses many of the common hardware devices on PC and
a few of the not so common. XWindows. Very stable. Has TCP/IP networking and
the shared filesystems (NFS) and printing that comes along with it. Can
mount and manipulate MSDOS files systems.

Weaknesses - few
Still late Beta so changes fast. Cannot yet run Windows binaries or COFF
files from SCO. Any others folks? Lacks a real WYSIWYG word processor but
the DOS emulator can run WordPerfect.

Not really (check out doc31),yes,yes,yes,yes.

> Because of it's name, I imagine it's similar to UNIX.  Is this correct?
No. It is Unix.

>  Will most UNIX programs run on LINUX? 

Source compatible with most SYSV and BSD programs. Most things compile
with minimal modifications.

> Is it a developer's OS?
Is UNIX a developers OS? GCC, GCC+ and OBJGCC are all available. There are
Fortran and Pascal translators. It has all the typical Unix utils like
editors, perl, and whotnot.

> Does it support GUI?  
Xwindows 11R5. Also MGR from Bell labs is supported.

Subject: Using/Starting Xwindows [help]
From: ph9991ha@uwrf.edu (James F Hall)
Date: 24 Sep 93 13:12:38 -0600

I have posted before on my problem with Xwindow, and I got a lot of
good advice pointing out that my vga card just doesn't have enough ram
to support X in color mode.  (Thanks for the help!)  I'm still happy
with X in mono, but I can't get it work.  I guess I need further help.
:-)

When I startx, I get into X, but it's all a series of vertical lines.
No shapes resolved.  I guess I can run my mouse, though, because the
lines change brightness when I move it.  Can't get out of it without
physically resetting the computer (oh no!).

Basically, I just need to get X running so I can actually see what's
there.  ;-}


Other Info: 386DX machine, with 1.03 SLS disks, installed full base +
X, 80Mb hard drive is 70M filled (10M free), 8Mb physical ram, no swap
set up by me the user.  Card is identified as VGA WONDER V3, with 256k
ram (I won't dispute this as it is -very- old.)


I keep notes on all I do to my system (for the benefit of others), so
here is my xchanges.txt file:

=================================< xchanges.txt >====================

Important changes made to my system for X:
==========================================

Updated 9-24-1993

1. I created a file .xinitrc in the home directory to run X.  Followed
the man page on startx to see what should go in it.  One line in file.
I am specifying the twm manager (I use twm at school):

    /usr/X386/bin/twm

2. Following advice, made a soft link between files so I could run X
as a mono program (X's fatal error says card does not have enough vga
ram on it.)  Command:

    #  ln -sf /usr/X386/bin/XF_Mono /usr/X386/bin/X

3. X gives a fatal error that I'm not specifying a server.  Added
xserverrc (with a single line) to the home directory:

    XF86_Mono

Date: Fri, 24 Sep 1993 18:54:06 GMT

I'm posting this as a sort of a "test balloon"...!

Our high school science club may distribute Linux on floppies as a means of
raising money for projects.  What we're thinking of is that instead of buying
the floppies from us, people might be interested in renting the disks (in
order to make copies of them) at a low rate.  Something like this:

You send them $40, and they mail you the base distribution of the most recent
Slackware package.  You copy the disks, and mail them back in a prepaid box
of some sort, within say two weeks, and they refund $20.  Ie. you get Linux
for $20.  Other parts of the dist would also be made available, as might be
other packages if the response is good.

If you'd like to get Linux cheap, and help out a relatively worthy cause,
could you please drop me some email?  (I'm the advisor to the science club,
in case that isn't obvious!)

The following is a artical on news by g9wayne@cdf.toronto.edu :

There are numerous ways of dialing out from any Unix box, including Linux.
I use kermit(1) to make the initial connection.  It has good vt100
emulation, and is a basic command-line communications program.  There
are others that are more "graphical" under X, like seyon, but I've never
used it.

After I make the connection with kermit, I always exit kermit and start
term(1), which allows me to have multiple virtual connections over the
modem, and to run X programs remotely.  For example, I can run xmaple
or matlab remotely, over my modem.  There is also reportedly a version
of oot running under Linux.  Ask Prof. Holt for more info.

If you installed kermit and term on your Linux box, then this is how you'd
do what I just explained.

linux$ kermit
kermit> set line /dev/cua0 # or whatever you terminal line is
kermit> set speed 2400     # or your speed...
kermit> connect
at
OK
atdt9787239    # wait...

CONNECT

PACX....
SERVICE?  cdf

eddie.cdf login: g9wayne
Password:

[login message...]

g9wayne@eddie> term -s2400

[now get back to kermit command mode, or exit kermit]

kermit> !term -s2400 </dev/cua0 >/dev/cua0 &
kermit> quit
linux$ trsh    # start a remote shell
g9wayne@eddie> txconn      # start up remote X server.


Then you can go to another Linux screen, or linux xterm, and type another
"trsh", and you'll have two shells running on eddie.

Get, install, and read the docs for kermit & term for more info.

[For those of you not running Linux at home, other people will have to help
you, I can't.]

Oh how demented we are here :-) :-) :-)
Call me a defender of what we like, choose to use, and meets our needs
nicely.  Tex, as seen by the original poster (and by many), really IS a
text formatter, not wordprocessor.  He didn't mean the posting to sound like
a slam.  I'm still waiting for COFF in Linux so I get buy WP for home......

Date: Fri, 24 Sep 1993 18:51:02 GMT


        Hello all, 

        I was just at work and found some old DEC Depca Ethernet cards. 
        Considering these are older 8 bit ethernet cards, and all we 
        use at work is the newer 3com cards, I asked the ole boss, "
        eh, we using these....".......Needless to say, I go two Depca
        ethernet cards free (and could probably get 10 more if I wanted 
        them..)

        Question is, I have not even attempted to setup TCP/IP with these
        guys, and I figured before I even try, I would ask if anyone 
        knows of any problems that I might encounter. Or will I still 
        have to shell out $160 bucks for 3com cards. 

                                Hopefully the reponse I get will be
                                , "they work great!"... Thanks all.
