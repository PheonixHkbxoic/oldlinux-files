I didn't say bash had a problem with quoted file glob characters, only case
patterns.  I was replying to a comment that bash expands variables in double
quotes by specifying the difference between variable expansion and filename
expansion and suggesting an example to show the difference.

(Do I *really* have to write every message as if everybody needs *all* of the
background from the beginnings of Unix on???  Sheesh.)

Subject: [PATCH] non-blinking software cursor for pl12 (& pl11)
Date: 13 Aug 93 23:35:37 -0400

[Please note: I'm posting this to comp.os.linux and comp.os.linux.misc
 for the sole reason that some people may not have the new newsgroups
 available to them yet. In the future, I will only post updates to this
 patch (if they become necessary) to comp.os.linux.misc (it doesn't
 seem to fit in anywhere else).]

Greetings:


Appended to this file is an updated and much improved version of my
software cursor patch for Linux 0.99 pl12 (I was going to hold off on 
releasing this until pl12 became official, but I wanted to get it out
over c.o.l before it bit the dust). This version incorporates
a fix for a really nasty bug and a few major overall improvements.

This patch should also apply cleanly to pl11 (although the hunks may
be offset slightly). Users of pl10 and earlier can also use this patch,
but you will have to edit several pieces in by hand.

Changes:
=======

- Finally eliminated the 'stray cursor left hanging around after
  screen unblanks' bug. For real this time. Honest. :)

- Completely re-did the software cursor code in set_cursor().

- Added a #define called SCURSCOLOR to set the software cursor
  color at compile time.

Features:
========

- With this patch, the standard hardware-generated 'blinking underline'
  cursor is replaced with a software-generated non-blinking block cursor.

- You can switch back and forth from software to hardware generated cursors
  at any time using a VT-200 style escape code.

- Each VC's cursor is maintained seperately: you can have half your VCs
  using the software generated cursor, half of them using the hardware
  cursor, or any combination in between.

New Features:
============

- The cursor color can be chosen at compile-time. Possible colors are white,
  yellow, magenta, red, green, cyan, blue and black. The default is white,
  which should accomodate monochrome display adapters as well as VGA or SVGA
  color ones. White seems to be a good, all-around default and I recommend
  using it, but if you have a color video adapter feel free to experiment.
  Whatever color is chosen will be retained across all VCs.

- The cursor color remains the same regardless of what foreground/background
  colors are selected. The only exception is if the cursor color and the
  background color are chosen to be the same: in that case the cursor will 
  appear black. (This is a feature, not a bug: the code in set_cursor()
  will never allow the cursor color and background color to be the same
  since that would make the cursor 'invisible', not to mention useless.)

Before anyone asks:

I am *not* planning to make the cursor color switchable at run time unless
an angry mob comes after me and demands it. It would be feasible to add
yet another escape code (or codes) to handle this, but I can't see any
real advantage to it myself. If enough people show interest in the idea,
however, I might be persuaded to give it a shot.

Configuration:
=============

There are now 3 #defines that control cursor behavior:

#define NOBLINK 1
#define HCURSTYPE 0
#define SCURSCOLOR 112

If NOBLINK is #defined, all VCs will default to software generated cursors
at boot time. If it is #undef'ed, they'll default to the usual hardware
cursors.

HCURSTYPE controls the size of the hardware cursor. 0 is a full-sized
blinking block. 13 is the standard blinking underline. 15 is off (invisible).
(Note that 'invisible' mode won't do you much good unless you're psychic. :)
I have it set to a block instead of the usual underline just because it
looks neater when switching back & forth from a blinking to non-blinking
cursor. I never liked the stupid little flashing underline anyway, which
is why I got into this mess in the first place. ;)

SCURSCOLOR sets the software cursor color. The default is white. Legal
values are:

  0     16   32    48   64  80      96     112
  black blue green cyan red magenta yellow white

Note that setting the cursor color to black will actually work, only
it will appear white on a black background since the code is smart 
enough to prevent the cursor form accidentally becoming 'invisible' due
to a bad choice of screen colors.

You can switch from software to hardware generated cursors on the fly
using a VT-200 style escape code as follows:

        <ESC>[?33h     switch to hardware cursor
        <ESC>[?33l     switch to software cursor

I have learned (thanks to nation@rocket.sanders.lockheed.com) that there
actually aren't any escape codes defined for this sort of function in the
VT-200 command set, however the codes I have selected do fit in the pattern.
This makes them non-standard but harmless so long as nothing trips them
by mistake. Note that even if you #undef'ed NOBLINK, you can still switch
a VC to software cursor mode with these escapes.

Installation:
============

This patch is a gzipped and uuencoded context diff against 
/linux/kernel/chr_drv/console.c. To apply it, extract the attached
uuencoded file to /linux/kernel/chr_drv/noblink.uu and do the
following:

# uudecode noblink.uu
# gunzip noblink.dif.gz
# patch < noblink.dif

Check for complaints from 'patch'. If it bitches about some hunks being
offset by a few lines, that's fine. If it rejects some of the patch, you'll
have to apply the rejected hunks by hand. Once you are sure the patch has 
been applied correctly, edit console.c and set the #defines as you prefer, 
then build your kernel. 

As always, questions, comments, complaints, flames, suggestions, bug reports,
bug fixes, or large sums of cash are welcome and encouraged.

Share and enjoy!

Ok, Ok, I've got a question.  Now this is nothing personal
against Mr. Monroy or anything, this article just solidified it.
Ok, the question....
Why the hell do I care if my floppy disk drive is 100% optimized
as long as it can read the stupid disks?  I personally have ZERO
interest in using floppies for *ANYTHING* except the bare minimum
necessary to boot my stinkin' PC!  What's wrong with a SCSI tape
drive?  These floppy attached ones are nothing but trouble!
They may be great in the single-tasking DOS world, but seem like
a real pain in the multi-tasking world.  Buy a stinkin' SCSI
tape drive if you're *serious* about backing up your machine!

It seems like a waste of bandwidth to flame/counter-flame over
some vapor-code from a blowhard (seemingly) that simply speeds
up something that we don't want to do anyway.
I'd think all this raw coding talent should be spent on more
significant things, for example, Mr. Evans' amazing interrupt/serial
code.  There is a perfect example of spending that extra effort
and yielding *SIGNIFICANT* improvements at the kernel level rather
that wasting time on seldom used drivers (as compared to kernel 
routines).

Anyway, just my $.02 (or maybe $5.00) worth.

IRETs,

-Andrew

Reply-To: rwb114@cac.psu.edu

A few days I posted a request for suggestions on tape drives 
for use under Linux.  Here are the responses I received
(unfortunately there were only two).

I'll just quote their responses directly since they are short:

#1:
I'm running a Wangtek 5150 ES (150/250 MB) via an Adaptec 1542B.
My disks and a CD-ROM are SCSI, too. I backup my Linux and DOS
partitions with a speed of 6MByte / minute under Linux 0.99 pl6.

Germany.EU.net nearby in Dortmund transferred part of their software
to two 250 MB tapes which I could easily read. And I have read an old
DC-600 archive.

Of course, the Adaptec is not a cheap SCSI controller, but consider
buying it or the EISA version now for the next disk(s) (SCSI for
performance and other reasons). If you want to have _only_ slow devices
on the SCSI bus, any cheap but reliable controller will do.

#2:
You can either go for SCSI, or shop around for a used QIC-02 tape, I've
picked up Wangtek 5150's with controllers for as little as $130, they'll
do 250mb uncompressed, and a lot more if you compress.  They will use
either 6150 (150mb) tapes or 6250 (250mb) tapes.  I've used both, and
the only problem with SCSI is you'll have to pick up a host adapter,
that will normally make the SCSI solution a bit more expensive.

[end responses]

The answer is closer to "yes, I'm using it right now".  (Actually it's
a 3c509, the ISA version.)

Before you get too excited:
        I'm probably the only one running it -- certainly I'm the only
        one running the latest version ;-).

        It's not even close to the beta test stage.

        I seem to be getting some packet corruption (with back-to-back
        packets?).

        The driver should work with the EISA version with minimal changes,
        but I have neither an EISA machine nor a 3c579.

There is a freely available MS-DOS NFS server called SOS/SOSS.

But many people want a free MS-DOS NFS client implementation.  That's
unlikely to happen:
        It wouldn't promote "the state of the art" in computing, in
        fact it would do just the opposite.  Some people would summarize
        this as "it wouldn't be fun to write".

        The support burden would grossly overwhelm the code writing effort,
        since MS-DOS applications are notoriously ill-behaved, and people
        tend to blame free software when something doesn't work.

        It requires very intimate MS-DOS knowledge to write, which only 
        comes with having money and "major software company" muscle.

        Every new version of MS-DOS would break it.

        Acceptable commercial versions are readily available.

Someday, perhaps, the Linux "dosemu" virtual machine will be good
enough that some people will use it just to replace PC-NFS.
