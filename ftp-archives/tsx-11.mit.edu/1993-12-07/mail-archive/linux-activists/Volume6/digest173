I bought a plain 486-33 made in Taiwan using an ETEK chipset, with 256K
cache, back in April of '92. I ran UNIX on it (Consensys SVR4), and have
had NO problems WHATSOEVER that are hardware related. Adaptec 1542B,
Diamond SpeedSTAR Plus (or ATI Ultra 8514A), Maxtor Panther, Exabyte,
etc. etc.

I run the Adaptec (strapped) at 8MB/sec DMA transfer speed with no
problems (that is, if the driver doesn't set it to 5). 

There is NO way to set things like wait states, or bus timings using the
BIOS. I can enable cache and such, but nothing as intricate as a 80386SX-33
I saw recently.

I wonder if there are bugs in the BIOS somewhere, and just never reported
because nothing was pushed to the limit like UNIX does. I don't mean that
UNIX uses the BIOS at all, I mean during booting, it may set some values
to far-off values.

I'm wondering what a DX-2 would do for my system - maybe break it? I'd
rather just add another 80486-33 (I have two of these vanilla motherboards)
and NFS mount everything.

I had the same problem at first.

Try searching for Maxima. Look for it with archie, since I don't
remember where it's at.

Maxima's a math program written in Clisp. It's really good and
does a whole bunch of things Derive can't.  It's not as easy
to use though.

I've had similar problems with gopher and other programs.  The problem
was solved by making sure that named was running correctly.  For some
reason these programs seemed to require it.  Of course, the real
problem may be that host.conf was misconfigured.  See the net-2 faq

Idraw will not run from X-windows because of this error. Out of

Only 2 windows open, and an xclock.  Only 6 gettys are up.

I tryed compiling pcomm using ncurses, and when I started it,
the only thing it did was to print the message

        couldn't open file.

This highly informative message comes from ncurses, so in desperation
I grabbed the ncurses sources from tsx-11, made & installed, then made
the ncurses, *NONE* of which work at all.

Are there known problems here, or am I doing something wildly wrong?

Ok, I just tried it on my system (486/33, 0.99.12, one scsi-, one ide-drive).
Using AHA1542B with Maxtor 7213S and noname IDE-card with a new WD 425MB disk
(called piranha, i think).
Here the numbers:

SCSI:
date ; time dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null bs=131072 count=512 ; date
Thu Aug 26 11:52:59 GMT 1993
512+0 records in
512+0 records out
0.010u 27.150s 1:22.49 32.9% 0+0k 0+0io 2pf+0w
Thu Aug 26 11:54:21 GMT 1993
(approx. 800KB/sec)

IDE:
date ; time dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/null bs=131072 count=512 ; date
Thu Aug 26 11:54:56 GMT 1993
512+0 records in
512+0 records out
0.050u 39.460s 0:52.57 75.1% 0+0k 0+0io 2pf+0w
Thu Aug 26 11:55:49 GMT 1993
(approx. 1236KB/sec)

As you can see, the IDE-disk is much (~50%) faster than the scsi-disk.
BUT (repeat BUT) also note that the adaptec stresses the system far less
than the ide (27 secs vs 39 secs system (kernel) time) !!!
So I would think the adaptec isn't that bad and should get better in comparison
as system-load rises for it consumes 50% less system-resources than the ide.
But then again, a big cache can scratch it all :-) (having 16MB ram) so you
won't see a big difference unless you have to write big (8MB or more) files
to disk fast.I would also think that scsi would win over ide if you are using 2
or even more disks as the adaptec can handle that much better.

So if you have the chance (and money) go for scsi and much ram and wait a be
patient: things will get better for scsi (thanx drew, eric et al.).

BTW: Has anyone tuned the scsi-drivers ??? I used to get much lesser
(~500KB/sec) throughput using 0.99.10 (but even that was better than the first
(0.95c+) scsi-drivers (~200KB/sec) :-))) (those were the days ...))

Hope it helps ...

I have similar problems. My machine doesn't crash, but just freezes. It
seems that the gcc (or actually gas) halts waiting for disk I/O. Other
processes still run, but when they need to access disk they, too,
freeze. If I'm fast enough, I can break the compile with ^C, but on
other occasions, nothing but booting helps. Even if I van break out with
^C, the next compile usually freezes, too. I usually try to start up
more processes or reboot to clear up the situation.

My environment is 0.99pl10, 486DX33, 4MB RAM, 4MB swapfile, XT-disk
(/dev/xd).

>Other programs don't crash, when they use swap partition.  So I don't

I usually have this problem with gcc, too, (and for several gcc
versions) but I don't think it's gcc that's in fault. It just happens to
access the disk in some particular pattern that manages to stir up some
race problems in kernel.

Well we're in the same boat. Because of a couple of equipment grants from AT&T
We have over 50 cards at the Atlanta University Center where I work. I 
contacted Donald Becker who was extremely helpful and pointed me to Micheal
Hipp who has written a NI5210 driver. According to Russ Nelson (the DOS
packet driver GURU) the Starlan Cards and the NI5210 cards are very
similar ( due to the use of the Intel 82586 Enet controller in each). So
my colleagues and myself picked up a copy of the NI5210 driver and started
hacking on it. Unfortunately we've run into a stumbling block where the
driver checks the shared memory in the card. The starlan card doesn't
register its memory to the driver to the driver installation fails.

We'll be working on this for the next week or so. Since there seems to be
a little interest if and when we get it working properly I'll gladly post
the info.

Later,

BAJ

[rest deleted]

Try 'strace pcomm'  when you want to check what's *really* going on..

I had the same problem for an ncurses based program.  strace gave me:
open("/usr/lib/terminfo/x/xterm", RDONLY) = -1 (No such file or directory)
write(2, "couldn't open file.\n", 20couldn't open file.
) = 20

Seems like ncurses wants an unknown terminfo file.. probably something
that has to be installed.

Subject: 99pl12 memory leaks?
Date: 26 Aug 93 20:59:00 GMT

Can anyone explain where my memory goes after I run a few applications,
then run free and ps again?  All the stuff that's running seems to be
identical size, yet I'm missing over 100kb when I subtract buffers and
free from the total after running X windows.  Of course, I've also noticed
that the numbers are 40kb off right after I boot!  If I subtract 13096
from 15196, I come up with 2100, so far so good.  Now, if I subtract the
1368 shared code from the 2100, I only have 732 left, but I have 772 in
buffers.  Do I misunderstand what I'm seeing here?  Are some of the 
buffers considered "shared"?  Here, the disparity is 40kb, but after 
running X and returning, the same programs show up when I run ps, but 
the disparity is over 100kb.  One reason for asking this is I believe
the 99pl12 kernel with the single patch that appeared in c.o.l.a. has
some sort of memory leak, I gradually lose memory, and after running 
for about 24 hours, if I try to tar to a tape drive, I will crash almost
every time.  I can reboot and all is well, tar and the tape work fine.
I also had the kernel run wild last night and fill my drive up with a
core file while trying to do some work on a Sparc workstation under
X using rlogin.  The core file ended up being 142 megabytes before
it filled that partition, then I was finally able to exit and clean
things up.  I was able to do an e2fsck and fix a couple of problems,
then I deleted the 142 megabyte core file, and all seems well, but
I'm not "brimming over with confidence". :-)  Has anyone else seen
stuff like this?  As I understand core files, there's no way I should
get one like that unless the kernel had it's tables screwed up somehow,
is that not correct?  Is there anything I can do to help isolate this
problem?  Since the way I discover it is usually a total lockup, it's
hard to do any diagnostics at that point. :-(  Here's the info before
and after running X, FWIW.
