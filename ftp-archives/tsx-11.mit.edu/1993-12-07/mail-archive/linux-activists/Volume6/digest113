        Let may say first that your post has merit and is a positive
contribution to the WP debate, unlike most of the drivel on other threads.
That being said, isn't there a channel for discussing this and if so, isn't
it a better forum to discuss those ideas?

PS. If there is no channel, then, IMHO, the level of traffic related to
this topic justifies the creation of one.

        Somehow the idea of using Linux or any GNU stuff in any commercial
        software is inherently dangerous. What if you inadvertently
        used code from the GNU source code, or worse unwittingly
        used one of GNU's source libraries (refer to bison skeleton files
        for an example!). This would mean the ownership of the entire software 
        you delivered to your customer is not obvious without actual
        inspection of the code. Somehow, I feel the FSF will be defending
        their copyight on this, othewise they lose their copyright.
        Sounds like trouble to me. Besides, when customers hear
        about this, they will certainly say: thanks, but no thanks,
        we will pay <insert unix/dos software house name here> the $$$ bucks, 
        but at least we know we own the software.

        But maybe I am wrong...:-) It would certainly be nice
        to be able to write shareware software for linux.
        At least shareware is reasonably priced unlike
        commercial stuff, and I think that is in GNU's spirit.

        If these issues are resolved, then linux would have
        a chance in the commercial arena.

I think there is a WORD channel for this.

   One thing I have been worried about many of the posts is the
priorities that many people seem to base their design on.  It seems
some people pick their favorite underlying format/language and then
try to figure out how to get the WP to use/manipulate that.  I
think that the main priority should be on one thing, usability.
By usability I mean the design of the UI + the speed of the system
as a whole.  I hate sluggish systems!

   I want a WP that is near WYSIWYG, and is very usable.  I don't
care if it uses OO design extensively, or if it's native format
is TeX, ps, *roff, or anything else.  A totally separate conversion
program would suit me just fine.

   The OO approach may help with embedding other things in the
document, however.  But again, if it means being too much
slower, I don't care how elegant the code works.

   Now here is where I cop out and say that I don't have any
time to devote to this ;-)  Oh well, I will be graduating in
a few weeks so after that, who knows?

Well, I knew I'd be in a dilema whith so many newsgroups: where do you
post bugs ??

Description:
============
Impossible to read files which are nested in the 5th level 
directory (or more).

Example:
========
% mount -t iso9660 /dev/sr0 /mnt
% ls -l /mnt/usr/X386/lib/X11/xinit
total 3
-rwxrwxrwx   1 root     other          92 May 12 20:45 YMTRANS.TBL
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     other         696 Feb 12  1993 xinitrc
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     other          21 Feb 12  1993 xserverrc
% cat /mnt/usr/X386/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc
cat: /mnt/usr/X386/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc: I/O error
% 

Additional Details:
===================
- ls works fine.
- cp returns the same error
- more does not do anything (returns the prompt).
- files less deeply nested work fine.

Hardware & Software:
====================
- TOSHIBA 3401B Internal CD-ROM
- adaptec AHA1542-C SCSI controller
- SLS 1.02 linux 0.99-pl9
- CD used is SLS distribution.

Disclaimer:
===========
It's not in the FAQ (version 1.18), I read it all ;-)

Thanks:

In advance to all those that will reply!

Date: 14 Aug 1993 02:55:43 -0400

I'm in the middle of FTP'ing Linux from ftp.cdrom.com, and in the
dir for Linux, there is a Gzip.taz file, which is a compressed tar file
which has a /usr/bin/gzip path in it.  I know this is gzip, but which
disk do I put this in? The files that are in the a? dirs are .tgz files,
so I guess the install program needs gzip to decompress all the files.

  Hi!
     I have installed Linux (0.99.11 from tsx) on my lab PC. Its a 486, 
     with a 2400 baud Fax Modem and an ethernet card.
     I want to use this PC as a SLIP server to connect to other machines
     on the net from my home computer.(since I do not have access to a 
     SLIP server :-()
     I looked around in the FAQs and found nothing to configure the
     Linux box as a SLIP server(except a mention that it could be done).
     The SLIP code with the distribution doesnot compile either.
     Please point me in the right direction.
     Thanks in advance,
     Chetan.

Subject: NFS mounting mail directories
Date: 14 Aug 1993 04:31:56 -0000

Hi...

        First off, excuse the major cross-post, but it all seemed to
relate...

        I'm running two Linux machines on the Internet right now,
on a 'sub-net' (right term?) consisting of three machines (the
two Linux, and a Unixware, which acts as our gateway machine).

        Users on the system have access to either a menu interface
on the Unixware machine, or the Unix-shell on one of the Linux
machines.  What we would like to do, but so far have been unable to,
is nfs mount the mail directory from Unixware to Linux.  

        The Linux machine is running pl12, the newest GCC and
libraries, smail 3.1.28, and elm 2.4 pl22.  The Unixware server
is also running smail3.1.28.

        Nfs-mounting the directories are easy...keeping the mail
from being screwed up is hard.  basically, we need to do the following:

        1 - if a user is reading email on the shell system, his mailbox
            has to be locked in such a way that new incomig doesn't get
            'lost'.  What I've noticed so far is that if the user is
            in the process of reading mail and a new one comes in, it
            gets added properly...if a user is in the process of exiting
            elm (our only mailreader for now), and a new mail comes in,
            the new mail will get lost (this is between hitting 'q' and
            either hitting 'y' to delete or getting to the prompt...
            basically, while it is rewriting to 'opened' mailbox to
            the spool directory)

        2 - a user in the shell sends an email to a 'local' user, and
            it writes it to the 'local' mail spool directory...what
            happens if *both* smtpd's try to write to the same box
            at the same time?  is there/should there be a lock from
            one smtpd?

        I think those are the two major issue confronting me.  Now,
from my limited understanding of this, I think that there is supposed
to be a C-function that will do the file locking over the NFS mount?
Is this correct, and if so, is it available (working) under the newest
Linux kernel?  Even more specific, is it a kernel function?  The only
thing that comes to mind is 'flock()'...heard it mentioned at one
time in relation to this...'configure' for elm finds flock, but
says it won't use it *shrug*

        If anyone has any ideas, either of how to do this, or where
to find more information on how to do this, it would be much appreciated...

Thanks...

I tried two days to install SLS 1.03 on a PC with a Future Domain TC 885 and
NE 2000 compatible card and a AT-Disk.

The problems are:

- the FD-Card has an Floppy Support using IRQ 6 ( or if working together with
an
  IDE-Card IRQ 5 (Jumper F1))
- The SCSI-part of the FD-Card can use IRQ 2-5 and 10-15. If you use IRQ 5 it
  possibly might work.
- My SLS Bootdisk A1.5 was preset with an IRQ of 5. No other IRQ worked. If you
  want to change this, you have to change the IRQ definition in the Kernel
  lookout for seagate.c
- Do not use the IRQ 5 for any other card. You might get problems. I had to
  work at net/inet-installation in the kernel, becaues the IRQ-Autodetect
  for an HP-Card found the Future Domain Floppy IRQ at IRQ 5 an thought it must
  be an Ethernet Card. But it was a wrong guess. The system went away. I had to
  reboot.

A simple solution for your problem might it to change the IRQ of the Future
Domain Card to IRQ 5 (so it worked with SLS 1.02 a1.5 dated 3rd of August)

I booted my system with SLS 1.03 and a1.5. The only problem at boot-time
I had regarding the ATI card, is that the Text-Color changed to yellow.

ln -fs libc.so.4.4.1 libc.so.4

This will force (-f  = if file exists, overwrite it, so be very careful
to not get the syntax backwards!) the linkfile libc.so.4 to be created
pointing at libc.so.4.4.1.

(BTW is this a FAQ?  Is this in the release notes for the libs?)

Another BTW:  what's libm used for?  I never hear of anyone having
problems breaking the libm link... it's always the libc link...

need Xconfig and a driver.  I have no idea how to install them. I have
never seen "unix" until I installed this.  But it looks alright, just
gotta get them windows!

Any help?  I looked on tsx-11 and all I found was a badly outdated doc
