Could someone out there please tell me if Linux SLS/SLW has any problems with   the 486SLC/DLC processor that goes unnoticed on an Intel.

Thanks

You can't unmount a drive that is currently being used - that is, has
open files, or a shell is sitting on that drive - eg. someone is in /usr

I have linux with SLIP, etc. running on a Cyrix 486/40 laptop.  No
problems that I can attribute the the processor.  I did have to
disable the co-processor functions and use the emulator, however.
No biggie.

Subject: hangup booting kernel (486)
Date: Mon, 23 Aug 1993 07:36:02 GMT

Hay Linuxers,

since a few months I try to become a Linux user but without any succes.
Whenever I try to boot Linux from the A1 disk I only get:

  LILO Loading Ramdisk
  Press <return> to see SVGA-modes available or <SPACE> to continue
  Uncompressing Linux: check - work - done.
  Now booting the kernel

after this only a dreadful silence remains, the screen doesn't respond and the
keyboard is dead too. The only thing that gets the computer going again is the
reset button. In order to make sure that my copy of SLS was ok I tried it
on a Laser 386. On that computer Linux was up and running in no time. So my
copy must be alright. After this I tried changing my CMOS but that didn't
help much. Now, after trying every patch since patchlevel 8, changing the CMOS,
checking the IRQ's, learning about UART chips, etc, I'm becoming quite
desperate. Below I have included my current CMOS setup and a hardware 
description produced with MSD for your information. I hope you can help me out
on this one.

  Thanks in advance,

    Huub van Dam,

Since when did my 386 machine upgrade to 486. Anybody know why ?

Can someone out there please pass me or at least direct me as to where to get

Subject: what causes "Invalid compressed format"?
Date: Sun, 22 Aug 1993 22:03:13 GMT

Can anyone tell me what causes the following:

Loading....................................
Uncompressing Linux...

invalid compressed format

 -- System Halted

I've been able, from using a base SLS 1.02 system, adding in
gcc-2.4.5/include-4.4.1/libc-4.4.1/image-4.4.1/net-2 binaries/
getty_ps 2.0.7, to compile and load .99.p10 and .p11 with no problem.

However, I seem to consistantly get this error when trying to boot off
of a compile .99.p12 released kernel.  I've compiled this on a system
that has 16 mb of ram, 8 mb of swap file, and to a 3-1/2" disk.  I'm
using a 80486-25 mhz machine that has 2 esdi drives, ultrastor 12f
esdi controller, and adaptec 1542c scsi card/archive 525e tape
drive.

From reading the "README" file, the only thing i haven't done is
pull down a new version of binutils.  (not sure what version
is needed).  Any help/suggestions would be helpful.

Subject: How to run XS3 and X386mono(hga) simultaneous
Date: Mon, 23 Aug 1993 10:27:40 GMT

I want to run two X-Servers (XS3 and X386mono( on a hercules card))
simultaneously. However, when i start the second Server, it starts up fine,
but clears the screen of the other X Server. It doesn't matter, whether
i start XS3 or X386mono first. Has anyone an idea how to solve this problem?
