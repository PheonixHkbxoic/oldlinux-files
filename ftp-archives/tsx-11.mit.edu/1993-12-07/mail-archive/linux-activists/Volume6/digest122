           Somehow the idea of using Linux or any GNU stuff in any
           commercial software is inherently dangerous. What if you
           inadvertently used code from the GNU source code, or worse
           unwittingly used one of GNU's source libraries (refer to
           bison skeleton files for an example!). This would mean the
           ownership of the entire software you delivered to your
           customer is not obvious without actual inspection of the
           code. Somehow, I feel the FSF will be defending their
           copyight on this, othewise they lose their copyright.

Nahhh.  You don't lose copyrights by not defending them -- you're
thinking of trademarks.

           Sounds like trouble to me. Besides, when customers hear
           about this, they will certainly say: thanks, but no
           thanks, we will pay <insert unix/dos software house name
           here> the $$$ bucks,  but at least we know we own the
           software.

Obviously that's only a problem if you're developing proprietary
software.

   Crynwr has a DOS "packet driver" for 3C509 in some kind of assembly language.
   I took a quick look and couldn't make any sense of it.

        IOZONE: Performance Test of Sequential File I/O  --  V1.16 (10/28/92)
                By Bill Norcott

        IOZONE writes a 8 Megabyte sequential file consisting of
        16384 records which are each 512 bytes in length.
        It then reads the file.  It prints the bytes-per-second
        rate at which the computer can read and write files.


        Writing the 8 Megabyte file, 'iozone.tmp'...14.020000 seconds
        Reading the file...35.060000 seconds

        IOZONE performance measurements:
                598331 bytes/second for writing the file
                239264 bytes/second for reading the file
   ------------------ 8< snip ... snip 8< ----------------------------------

   The deficiency in reading the data really looks a bit dramatic. I
   hope the AHA-driver's author is reading here right now and will have
   a look to the driver-code, in order to improve this reasonably.
   The above comparision-chart can help to see what's normal for an
   AHA-1542B on an ISA-Bus.

My programming experience says that you should obtain the code for another
CD drive and modify it. I have seen the code for the Mitsumi drive 
which under DOS also uses the mcdext driver, and it seems much
simpler than a DOS device driver (the Linux driver).
Pointer: the Linux Mitsumi driver is on sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/kernel
/cdrom/mcd*

Good Luck!

In addition to setting the ISO9660 option, you need also to include the
driver for your type of CD drive, and to mknod a special file for it.
If your driver is not SCCI, you have to find a suitable driver, as
only SCCI drivers are standard in the kernel.

I use the same setup except for your controller. Anyway, the Archive is
linked to /dev/*rct0. Therefore, prep an empty tape by putting a
single file on it. I.e.:
find / -mount -name any_single_file -print | cpio -ocv -O/dev/nrct0
tape wfm
tape rewind
tape unload

The nrct0 device is the no-rewind device.

Next, using /usr/lib/sysadin/cbackup, I create unattended backups
this way (using a script):
cd /
/usr/lib/sysadmin/cbackup 3 -K525000 /dev/ftp /dev/nrct0
tape wfm
cd /
/usr/lib/sysadmin/cbackup 3 -K525000 /dev/home /dev/nrct0
tape wfm
cd /
   .
   .
   .
tape rewind
tape unload

My parameters above for cbackup may not be just quite right, but
I'm not at my site right now. If you need further help shoot an email
my way - address below.

Subject: Frustrating Installation Problems with SLS and Slackware
Date: Mon, 16 Aug 1993 05:23:56 GMT

Hi Linuxers,

I am trying to replace the 0.99pl9 SLS on my ELSA box with the latest
SLS, but encounter problems.
At boot, I got the message: dl0 D_LINK pocket adaptor... probed failed at 
0x387.  Is this a problem?
I tried many times to install the a disks, but failed.
I got smoothly to disk a4, and was asked to insert a newly formatted disk
for creating a bootdisk.  But /dev/fd0 was shown to be "write protected".
Any idea??

After so many frustrating trials, I grabbed the Slackware, I encountered
the same above message at boot.  But this time, I could not do:
doinstall /dev/hda2 . I got "segmentation faults (core dumped)" and
could not proceed any further.  Any suggestion???

I took home the SLS a disks and tried them on my 386 laptop.
I had the same message at boot, and was able to go smoothly through
the installation, with bootdisk created.!! BUT throughout the installation
I had only half of the messages displayed on the top half of the screen, 
and I installed the SLS blind-foldedly, i.e., guessed what were asked to do;
half of the messages were not seen.!!

Helps will be gratefully appreciated.

Cheers, nyeo

Yes, I am using Kermit for a long time now to access VAX computers.
Below are the key definitions that make a PC pretty much like a VT100.
There is only one problem, the PC doesn't have as many keys as a VT.
The keypad section misses one key in the column Enter, + and -,
and the NumLock and / are hard to redefine. To make up for those,
I use the Insert, Home and PageUp keys from the 6-key block
between the numeric pad and the main keyboard as the PF1, PF2 and
PF3 keys respectively. Other VT keyboard files often use
alt-F or shift-F keys for VT function keys, but that is very hard
to use on VAX editors.

By the way, I just found out that the new versions of Kermit:
C-Kermit5A for Unix and MS-Kermit 3.13 for PC can transfer files
as fast as zmodem, which for me eliminates zmodem. No tricks needed
to run zmodem under kermit any more. The latest issue of Kermit News
(free, to be requested at Kermit@Columbia.edu, to be mailed (paper !))
reports speed tests where Kermit outperforms zmodem. My experience
sofar is 90 % of zmodem's speed. For max speed, you need to do some
special settings on BOTH ends of the Kermit transmission:
 SET WINDOW 3
 SET RECEIVE PACKET-LENGTH 1000 (also SEND, of course)
 SET CONTROL UNPREFIXED ALL
 SET CONTROL PREFIXED 0 1 129
but all this assumes that you have a clean connection with 8 bits data
and that no terminal server chokes on control characters.

The new versions of Kermit for PC and Unix are on: ftp.cc.columbia.edu.

Another reason to abandon zmodem is that I am not convinced that
it is free software. I have seen notices in the source of sz and rz
that it is free to try it for 30 days. Kermit is as free as Linux,
and is also very sophisticated. It can handle very difficult
communication problems, and is now also fast.

Okay, here is the take file for VT100 keys:

Discovered the reason for the hang - I'd just installed INN 1.4 on it and
was trying to create a history file from scratch just before I gave up for
the day. Apparently there have been reported cases of Suns hanging
(identical look - nothing works but a hard reset) when makehistory ran.

At least the hang doesn't look like Linux's fault now :-)

Thanx to all of you who replied to my various questions.

Such is the nature of Linux, I suppose.

These answers do raise a few extra questions however:

1) What's the difference between /dev/ttys0 and /dev/cua0 (= /dev/modem)
2) Is there a list of _Stable_ versions of various programs, and their locations?

Below is a summary of the answers I received, for those who said "Mee too!"

---- cam:
I get this and ignore it.  I think you have to do a fsck while the
file system is unmounted.  (BTW, I know I shouldn't really ignore it but
I know the fs isn't corrupt!)

---- doolitt:
I can't figure that one out either.  If you get an answer, would you
e-mail it to me?  The noise level is still quite high, and I might
miss it if you post it.

---- peterc:
Yes --
        e2fsck -rv /dev/???

to repair the disc, as well as check it.

Anyway, with pl9 if you're using ext2fs for the root partition, it
doesn't unmount root at the last, so you'll get the message again next
time round.  Upgrade to pl12, and use the latest bootutils, arrange to
boot with a readonly root and check it then.

---- bam:
No it doesn't go away. Not unless you get pl10 or pl11 and bootutils.

---- peterc:
You need to configure named.

---- bam:
The net stuff in pl9 was highly questionable your best bet is forget
it and get pl10 or 11


**** ME:

---- doolitt:
Emacs is probably fine, but it might be trying to shared-link to the X libraries.
Do you have X properly installed on your machine?  If not, there are binaries
for emacs around that do not require it.  Sorry to not be more specific.

---- peterc:
Known problem -- the emacs distributed with SLS is broken.

**** ME:
>I can't do anything with the /dev/modem device, as it claims that the device
>is in use all the time. I can, however, use the /dev/ttyS1.

---- doolitt:
Sometimes permissions on the serial ports get messed up.  Check that out.

---- peterc:
I don't know what /dev/modem is -- is it the same as /dev/cua0? (Yes)

---- bam:
My soulution to this is usually ```rm /dev/modem'' and forget it.
Giving ttys multiple names causes trouble with lockfiles.

**** ME:

---- cam:
get getty_ps2.0.7b if you want to do logins via modem - also get the
serial FAQ.  If you have problems then talk to me, as I've done it.

No - you can't monitor what is going on with the serial line via the
consoles.  That would require modifying the kernel.  This was discussed
on c.o.l a while back.

---- doolitt:
I haven't tried modem access, but I hooked up my old 286 as a terminal.
You need to modify /etc/inittab (and then get the init process to reread
it by doing an "init q" as root) to tell it to run "getty" on that terminal
line.  You may also need to monkey with /etc/gettydefs, check the man pages if
it doesn't work right away.  I recommend against letting modem users login
as root (better to force people to use a real name and then su to root),
but if you have your heart set on it you need to tweak the CONSOLE line in
/etc/login.defs.

---- nygren: 
You can get Linux to wait for a serial port logins with the getty command.
(I haven't tried this with Linux, but it should work on most UNIX systems).

Try:

getty /dev/modem

(It defaults to 9600 bps, I think).  You will have to set the modem to
auto answer first...  There may be a better solution, but....
---- peterc:

Set up getty on /dev/ttyS[01] (whichever you plug it into).  In
/etc/inittab.  (depending on which version of init you're using).


As far as I know you can't then monitor the output.
---- bam:
I wish I knew. I got this to work with my old 2400baud modem but since
I've upgraded to a fast V32bis modem I can't get Linux to answer the phone.

I launched this flame with the advise of using an oscilloscope and am
sorry that I probably missed some of those hilarious replies. Could
somebody send me a summary, and I am also interested in the joke
of testing cables with a scope.

I haven't heard of the poor guy with the modem problem. Has that been
solved, and did I guess right with the grounding problem?

(Could we start a series like CAR TALK on public radio with guessing
problems and fun answers?)

About using an oscilloscope on the phone: the ****OBVIOUS**** solution
is to hook up the scope BEHIND the isolation transformer. That's the
point where the modem chip gets the signal, and what the modem chip
sees can the oscilloscope see too. Nothing magic. Doesn't take me
25 or 30 years to come up with. And if you think it is too hard to clip
the probes on the pins of that submicron PC board, open up a (junk) phone
set and measure there. No fancy equipment.

yes, it's a handy device called a 'floppy disk' :-)
basically you set the image on the floppy to look on the right disk and
partition for the / level and you're all set.

Leave the floppy in, boot linux,
take it out, boot of the primary disk

incidentally, you'll need far more than 40 MB for Linux to do anything
reasonable.  Hell, you should have a 16 MB swap partition.  I'd suggest
you partition the 1st disk into two DOS pieces, then mount the second
half of the big disk as a dos partition and stash things there.

Some time ago, we approached the manager of a little computer store near
UCLA and convinced him to install Linux on the PC clones he sells to us.
This eliminates the work and risk involved in the purchase and assembly
of the correct hardware components then configuring Linux for them.  All
we do when we get the machine home is plug it in and turn it on.

I posted this story a while ago in this newsgroup and got several requests
for the name and telephone number:

                20/20 Technologies
                Computer Systems & Peripherals
                1786 Westwood Boulevard
                Los Angeles, CA 90024

                Tel: (310) 441-8855
                Fax: (310) 441-8869

They also have a toll free number 1-800-486-2020 for long distance callers.
You will want to talk to Moujan Ahouraian and tell him that Bob Tisdale
told you about them.  I have no connection with 20/20 Technologies other
than as described above.  I do know several satisfied customers including
myself.  I have found their prices to be competitive with local vendors
and they claim that they can match any ADVERTIZED price.

I hope you find this information useful, Bob Tisdale (edwin@cs.ucla.edu)
