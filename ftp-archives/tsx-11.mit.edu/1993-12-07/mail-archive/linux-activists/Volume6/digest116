Not quite. Ncurses doesn't use a separate terminfo lib but actually implements
it internally. This makes libterm totally incompatible with ncurses. I'm
working on termcap emulation in ncurses, that way you only need to link with
-lncurses to get terminfo/termcap/curses.

Subject: SLS 1.03 - Problem with NFS install with  5 1/4" disk. Can't mount
Date: 14 Aug 1993 22:33:36 GMT

I'm trying to install SLS 1.03 via NFS. I'm using a1.5 since the machine
only has a 5 1/4" disk. The boot goes ok, the 3com 3c503 card is detected 
at 0x300, int5, c800. I log in as install and set the new ip and routes.
I also put in the address of the NFS server and the directory (A Sun running
4.1.1). At this point, Linux fails to mount the NFS directory. I know 
it says try several time, and I did, many times. No go. I then logged in
as root, and tried a manual mount. Still no good.

I see the updated SLS has a new 3 1/2" disk with NFS fixes. Does the 5 1/4"
disk require some fix before it can do a NFS install? I was able to install
fine from a mounted DOS hard disk, with the same disk.

Subject: Weird floppy behavior
Date: Sat, 14 Aug 1993 22:24:07 GMT

I got a new computer recently, a 486DLC with an "FA3" motherboard.
I put Linux on the hard disk and it worked quite nicely until I upgraded
to 8 megabytes (from 4).  For some weird reason, the floppy drive
didn't work.  When I tar'ed something onto the floppy and untar'ed it
elsewhere, I got a bunch of garbage.  Also, I couldn't boot off of a floppy
(so I didn't suspect Linux).   When I took out four of the 1x9 SIMMs,
everything went back to normal.  Weird.

So I stuck back in the SIMMs, and recompiled the kernel with LAST_DMA_ADDR
in /usr/src/linux/kernel/dlk_drv/floppy.c equal to 4 megs instead of 16 megs
(so no DMA transfers would occur above 4M to or from the floppy).  Now,
surprisingly, the floppy drive works under Linux but I still can't boot
off of it, unless I go back down to 4 megs.  Isn't this weird?  Has anyone
heard of this happening?

(I did try the classic `all possible permutations' algorithm on the CMOS;
it doesn't matter whether the external or internal caches are enabled; the
problem is the same.)

 I have used these with Linux and SCO Unix.  I have had no problems to date,

Subject: [Q] Problems with LILO ...
Date: 14 Aug 93 10:32:00 GMT

Hi,

i have got severe problems installing LILO. During the last
two or three weeks i installed the SLS distribution of
Linux (1.02 & 1.03) on several computers, all equipped with
standard IDE-Controllers and always had the same problem.
After successfully installing all disks of the distribution
i tried to install LILO to boot DOS or Linux from
harddrive. But two attempts out of three failed to work.
Either LILO complains about something like an unknown boot
signature or it seems to install correct but after a reboot
i get the message invalid partition table (seldom) or it
starts up writing "LI" (not "LILO") to the screen and then
it hangs (often).

I do not know what i am doing wrong. Has anyone experienced
similar problems and knows what to do about it?

Does anyone know wether there is a possibility to repair a
LILO boot-sector? Up to now i always installed the whole
beast again, hoping it will work. Okay, usually after two
or three attempts everything works fine, but this method
is rather frustrating and time consuming.

If you need more information on my hardware or the way i
installed the package please email me.

It would be nice if anyone has got an idea. Thank you.

Bye, Holger ...

When dump and restor were written and subsequently Berzerkeleyized, find
didn't understand -newer.

The other reason had to do with a "tower of Hanoi" (so called by the "dump"
manpage; actually, it was a geometric progression) backup schedule which
arranged for a series of progressively older tapes:  at one tape per dump
level and the dump levels alternated according to a binary sequence (1, 2,
1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 5, ...) you get (assuming daily
backups):

        1 week on 4 tapes
        2 weeks on 5 tapes
        4 weeks on 6 tapes
        8 weeks on 7 tapes
        16 weeks on 8 tapes
        32 weeks on 9 tapes
        64 weeks on 10 tapes, which is the limit.

Tape # N (starting from 1) corresponds to dump level 10-N, which is why 10
tapes is as high as you can go.

This can save your *ss if something from half a year ago needs to be restored
from tape for some reason.  (It happened to me once.)  But, from the same
period, keeping track of what tape/dump level to use on what day is a bit of
a problem, because days/weeks/months just don't fit into powers of 2 too well.

Subject: Slackware Enet and kernel compiling problems
Date: Sat, 14 Aug 1993 23:56:14 GMT

Well Slackware is getting better. 3 complete installations in 4 days after
the first 3 hour bout with the network installation. A couple of problems
though in the ethernet and kernel compiling areas. The Configuration:

Machine: 50 Mhz 486 VLB, 220 Meg IDE HD, 8 Megs of RAM, WD8003E Enet card
         8 Meg swap partition.
  Linux: .99PL12 Slackware 1.01 distribution. Just installed and unchanged

Ok. First the Enet problem. The WD8003 card works fine with DOS packet drivers
and worked fine on the previous SLS 1.02 installation. When I fire up the
card using ifconfig I get error along the line of

eth0: Bogus packet ... size = <fff3>
kmemory: cannot allocate buffer size 65533

over and over and over again until I shut the card down.

I read a couple of days ago that turning off the packet forwarding would
take this problem away. So I dug into /linux/net/inet/ip.c and commented out
the define on packet forwarding. I then went to the top level, did an make
config, make dep, make clean, make zImage. Well disaster stuck because
the kernel won't compile. I get internal compiler error in places like
init/main.c and kernel/chr_drv/keyboard.c. I though it might be a swap
problem (because the first time I ran the make I didn't have the swap
partition attached -- and when I attached it top showed some swaping) but
even with the swap attached and about 1.6M of it used I get errors.

Do I have a bad gcc2.4.5? Is there anything else I should look at.
My machine is fairly useless if the net is disabled. I'm typing this using
DOS ;-(.

Any help greatly appriciated.

They were posted on August 11 and should all have appeared around the same

system/news administrator and request that they add them.

Unless they follow news.groups, they will probably ask you if you are

This much I know is not true in general... I compile the kernel at least
a couple times a day! :^)  

I noticed a new .99pl12A went up on nic.funet.fi, and I'm integrating
that into the Slackware distribution right now, along with improved
setup of the ethernet card for NFS installs. There will be some other
new things as well, including a new E series with emacs 19.18.

Take care,

Subject: NN thrashes .newsrc file (esp over NFS)
Date: 15 Aug 1993 00:26:51 +1000

I noticed this problem while running NN over NFS. Every time I go to a new
group NN rewrites the .newsrc file in its entirety. I am running NN 6.4.18.

I've been running NN locally for years and never noticed it. I can guess
then that it isn't a problem when done locally.

However if I run it over NFS I can hear the disk thrash at the time of
writing. Moreover, it takes longer. A looping shell script (doing a
regular ls -l .newsrc) shows the file growing.

NFS is a stateless protocol. Does this imply that my server (Sun 3/60 running
SunOS 4.0) biod must open and close the .newsrc file many times?

The client is a Linux box. I have heard that Linux only supports small
block sizes (rsize=1024,wsize=1024). Does this contribute to the thrashing?
My .newsrc is about 32k long.

Finally although I appreciate Nn's motive in keeping my .newsrc up-to-date,
surely this effort is wasted. Wouldn't it be more appropriate to update
the file every 5 minutes and on exit only?

Nick.

                 Welcome to the comp.os.linux.* hierarchy!

Background
=========================================================================
        This posting is an introduction to the comp.os.linux.* hierarchy 
        of USENET newsgroups. 

        Linux is a free implementation of UNIX for 80386/80486 machines 
        covered by the GNU GPL. Most of the development of the Linux 
        kernel has been done by Linus Torvalds, an internationally 
        reknowned UNIX wizard from Helsinki, Finland.

        For the past two years or so, the newsgroup comp.os.linux has 
        grown be one of the most popular groups on USENET. Late in 1992, 
        a CFV for splitting comp.os.linux was posted; the only group which 
        passed was comp.os.linux.announce, a moderated newsgroup for Linux 
        announcements and patches.

        Six months later, during the summer of 1993, another CFV for 
        splitting comp.os.linux was posted. The voting period for the 
        comp.os.linux reorganization results ended at 23:59:59 UTC on 
        4 August 1993 (4:59PM US Pacific Time, 7:59PM US Eastern Time.) 
        The results are as follows:

         1660  155 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.misc


        Because of this split, the newsgroup comp.os.linux will be 
        deleted on 11 November 1993. The new newsgroups will be created 
        on 11 August 1993. This posting describes these newsgroups, 
        including comp.os.linux.announce, which will remain entact.


General Policy
=========================================================================
        The general policy for the Linux newsgroups is simple. Who sets
        the policy? We all do. All of us on USENET are interested in
        communicating openly about a number of topics. That's why we
        have USENET. If you want the Linux newsgroups to work for you,
        a few suggestions:

        * Read the Linux FAQ and follow the newsgroups for some time 
          before posting questions. This is very important. comp.os.linux 
          suffered from HUGE amounts of noise and traffic because much 
          of the growing readership never bothered to READ the newsgroup;
          they only posted questions.
          
          The same thing will happen with the new newsgroups unless you 
          read the FAQ (found on sunsite.unc.edu in the file 
          pub/Linux/docs/FAQ) and read the newsgroup for some time before 
          posting questions. Chances are, your question has already been
          recently answered, and a simple browsing of the newsgroup
          will answer it. We suggest using a threaded newsreader such as
          "trn" which will allow you to browse and mark articles by 
          subject, so you don't have to read each and every article in
          each newsgroup.

        * Crossposting between the Linux newsgroups is STRONGLY 
          discouraged. If you do crosspost questions between Linux 
          newsgroups, expect to be flamed to oblivion. The reason we
          have a newsgroup split is to categorize discussions into 
          separate newsgroups. Crossposting negates this effect. 
          If your posting cannot fit into ONE of the newsgroups
          c.o.l.admin, c.o.l.help, or c.o.l.development, then you 
          should post it to c.o.l.misc. 

          The one exception is for announcements. Occasionally, an
          important announcement (such as this one) will be crossposted
          between c.o.l.announce and one or more of the other c.o.l.*
          groups. These announcements must be approved by the .announce
          moderator; see below.

        * Reply to questions via e-mail if at all possible. While 
          discussion in the newsgroups is encouraged, if someone is
          asking a simple question to which the answer is well-known,
          there is no reason to post the reply. Don't assume that 
          the person posting the question actually reads the newsgroup
          or will even note your followup if they do. Reply via e-mail
          unless the reply is of general interest. 

        * Don't flame newbies. Over the course of the past few months,
          the Linux community has developed an oversensitive ego and
          a reputation for being unfriendly towards newcomers, mostly
          because of unwarranted flaming by a handful of righteous 
          individuals. If someone posts, saying, "Hi! I'm new to
          this group! What is Linux?" (which will inevitably happen
          as the new newsgroups are propagated), DO NOT FLAME THEM.
          When someone sees a new newsgroup pop up within "rn", they
          are justifiably curious about the new group and probably
          don't know that well over 80,000 people who know EVERYTHING
          about Linux read the group. Right? 

          Instead of being rude, you can send a polite note to the
          poster, saying, "Hello, Linux is a free implementation of
          UNIX for the 386 and 486. You can get the FAQ from 
          sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/docs. Let me know if I can
          be of help!". That's all. Not difficult, eh? You can even
          save your stock reply in a file and simply send form-letters
          to newbies if you wish. But there is very little point in
          flaming or ever being rude. It goes against everything that
          Linux can and should be. 

          Just remember that nobody knows everything---not even Linus---
          and that you were a newbie once, too. :)


comp.os.linux.announce
=========================================================================
        Comp.os.linux.announce is a moderated newsgroup for Linux 
        announcements and source patches. The purpose of this group was
        to get all of the ``important'' Linux information out of the
        regular newsgroup and into a place where all Linux users could see
        the important announcements without having to wade through a 
        jungle of other postings. So far, this group has been very 
        successful. 

        The moderators for this group are myself (Matt Welsh, 
        mdw@tc.cornell.edu) and Lars Wirzenius (wirzeniu@cc.helsinki.fi). 
        We will be sharing the moderator duty, and backing each other up 
        to make sure that postings to this group will be approved as soon 
        as possible after they're submitted.

        Submissions to this group should be mailed to the address:
                linux-announce@tc.cornell.edu

        If you have any problems or questions about c.o.l.announce, please 
        send mail to the moderators at
                linux-announce-request@tc.cornell.edu
        Or simply mail us directly. This is not a request address for 
        mailing list subscription; see below.

        A separate posting details the guidelines for submitting to this 
        group.  I plan to approve just about anything that's posted to this 
        group, except for questions or discussions about Linux. So, please, 
        post away.  :)

        There are also archives of comp.os.linux.announce available at a 
        number of Linux FTP sites: check 
                sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/linux-announce.archive

        There is a mailing list mirror of the comp.os.linux.announce 
        newsgroup; to join, send mail to
                linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi
        With the line
                X-Mn-Admin: join ANNOUNCE
        at the top of the body (not in the subject). Approved postings to 
        c.o.l.announce will automatically be mailed to this mailing list 
        channel.


comp.os.linux.admin     
=========================================================================
        This newsgroup was created simply to thwart the unique newsgroup
        acronym "c.o.l.a", previously used by c.o.l.announce. However,
        this newsgroup is also used for discussions and questions about
        running Linux systems, either in a single-user or multi-user
        environment.

        Clearly, there is no large distinction between c.o.l.admin and
        c.o.l.help. However, .admin should be mostly used for discussions
        about RUNNING Linux, not USING or PROGRAMMING it. Unfortunately,
        especially with Linux, the line between system administrator and
        system user is very fuzzy. In short, we anticipate c.o.l.admin
        to be mostly about questions with installing, setting up, and
        configuring Linux systems, as well as other discussions relating
        to system administration. 


comp.os.linux.development
=========================================================================
        c.o.l.development, or "c.o.l.d" for short, is a newsgroup for 
        questions and discussions about Linux kernel and systems-level 
        development. Please note that this is a newsgroup about 
        development OF Linux, not development FOR Linux. In other words, 
        c.o.l.d isn't for questions about programming or porting software 
        to Linux. Instead, this is a newsgroup for discussions about 
        developing the Linux kernel itself, including writing device 
        drivers, adding new features, and so on. In addition, discussions
        about development of shared libraries, and other essential 
        systems-level projects, are welcome here. 

        Hopefully, this newsgroup will embody some of the content and
        scope of the linux-activists mailing list channels such as GCC, 
        KERNEL, SCSI, and NET.


comp.os.linux.help
=========================================================================
        Comp.os.linux.help is perhaps the most general of Linux 
        newsgroups. It is for any general user, programming, or 
        setup questions and discussion about Linux. If your question
        is about Linux development, post to c.o.l.development. If
        it is about system administration, post to c.o.l.admin. 
        However, if your question is of a more general nature, such
        as "How do I set up Linux for use with an NE2000 card?",
        c.o.l.help is your place. 

        Remember that you should not crosspost between .help and
        other Linux newsgroups. This means that if you are asking for
        help in .development, that's fine, but .help is for those
        questions which don't fit into .admin and .development.


comp.os.linux.misc
=========================================================================
        This group is the canonical ``catch-all'' for discussions and 
        questions which don't fit into the other Linux newsgroups.
        While c.o.l.help is generally for questions, c.o.l.misc is for
        discussions of a general nature about Linux, such as setting up
        a file hierarchy standard, questions about Linus' personal life
        and virtual beer, and the inevitable flame war. Again, it should 
        be noted that crossposting between c.o.l.misc and other Linux 
        newsgroups is strongly discouraged. If your posting or question 
        does not fit into ONLY ONE of the other Linux newsgroups, post 
        it to .misc.


Comments
=========================================================================
        If you have questions or comments about this document, please
        direct them to mdw@tc.cornell.edu. Flames to /dev/null; cheques
        and money orders to Linus Torvalds. Thanks.
