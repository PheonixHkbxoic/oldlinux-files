Joe creates a backup of the file called (filename)~ (note the tilde) if this 
backup is not owned by you (i.e non root user) then joe is unable to edit 
the file as it can't overwrite the old one.  the fix is to 'su' and change 
the ownership to the user of the original source file. 

BTW there are later versions of Joe on world.std.com with a lot more 
bells and whistles.

I agree that _compiling_ a new kernel isn't complicated - unfortunately
the README doesn't tell how to _install_ the new kernel. Just copying to the 
old kernel place doesn't work, I guess, and specifying a new kernel at 
boot-time only works if you have lilo enabled to let you select another kernel,
so what's the proper solution (except for changing the lilo configuration)?

Often this is because of filesystem and/or buffer cache overhead.  If you
want a rough estimate of the raw speed of snarfing data from the disk, try
something like:

        time dd if=<raw disk device> of=/dev/null bs=1024k count=100

Then divide the resulting time by 100 to get the raw Mb/sec.  I would
expect to see 1-2Mb/sec for SCSI-II, and 2-3Mb/sec for Fast SCSI-II.

I've found that the numbers I get doing this are within about 10% of the
equivalent test under DOS (which, being so simplistic, is a relatively
good way to find out just how fast you can pull bits off the drive).

As an example of how much poor filesystem coding can effect this, I get
about 200k/sec through an SVR4 UFS filesystem (I think that's the right
number), using a 486/DX50 EISA with a BusLogic 747S Fast SCSI-II host
adapter (in enhanced mode), and a Micropolis 2112 Fast SCSI-II drive.
A friend running exactly the same hardware, but with the UnixWare Veritas
filesystem is seeing something like 1.6Mb/sec.  The 'dd' test produces
comparable results on the two systems.  Yielding us to leave the blame
squarely on the shoulders of UFS.

Did anybody notice that lilo won't boot dos 5. 

I have tried a good number of times with different configurations

The boot error message is:
Non-system disk or disk error.
Replace and hit any key when ready.

However, dos 5 still boots if I activate the dos partition

1 possible way.  Get the loop device sources & start hacking.
(A loop device allows you to mount a regular file as a filesystem.)
Implementing the compressed filesystem will probably be easier in
this way. && less risky.

Just make sure to check your hardware. This can save lots of fiddling. Also,
the devices ttyS1, ttys1, and cua1 all talk to the same port, and each has
its own virtues.
One more thing. You might need to set the CLOCAL flag in order to communicate
via serial cable. To do this, either use agetty , which supports a CLOCAL flag,
or, you can set this in your inittab/gettytab.
Hope it helps.

In addition to serserial, a fine program indeed, you can have the kernel
auto-configure the serial lines at bootup. I'm not sure why this feature
is undocumented (comments, please), but it has worked for me for some time
not without problem. You can either change the Configure script to include
a question about configuring serial lines, or add a line to 
/usr/include/linux/autoconf.h. in either case, the line you want in there is
CONFIG_AUTO_IRQ. in the config script, have it ask you if you want it, and
use the above. In the include file, define CONFIG_AUTO_IRQ 1 will work.

 8 meg ram
 101-keyboard
 1572f 15" monitor ATI ultra pro w/1 meg Video ram
 intel satisfaction 400 internal fax/modem
 laserjet 4 hanging off parallel port
 scanjet IIc w/its "little" controller card. I think its pseudo SCSI.

 Description of problem:

 I grabbed Caleb Epstein/John Carr's UltraStor 24F patched image to ALPHA-pl11
and put it onto the Slackware 1.01 a1 disk. (I had to move a couple of files off
onto a 5 1/4" dos floppy then mount it and create links to the files. - floppy
disk space problems). This worked fine cause it now sees the 24F. I created the 
fs (mke2fs) on /dev/sda2 and also created two 16-meg swap partitions (/dev/sda3,
/dev/sda4). This too worked fine. I then popped in a2 and started doinstall /dev/sda2.

Now the fun begins, a2 loaded in fine, NO PROBLEMS. I then put in a3 and hit return.
It stated loading in files ok, but....then the disk locked up, the led stayed on, and
the device driver spewed out about a dozen lines of info. It began with:

  SCSI host 0 timed out - aborting comand 0a
  06m: 0:5f280 ICM 0:5f280
  ultrastor ports: abort 4
                    .
                    .
                    .
                   abort 0

This went on about 3-4 more times before I decided to seek some help.
The first time I enabled both swap partitions, the second neither swap partition,
the third time the turbo button switched to 33Mhz from its original 66Mhz, the fourth
time I booted dos/windoze ok then tried doinstall again from a booted a1, same problem.

Description of solution:

HELP! HELP! HELP!

Is there a solution to this problem besides buying another controller such as adaptec?
That is NOT an option, I must work with this 24F!

 At this point, I AM DESPERATE FOR HELP! I need a patched image from someone/somewhere.

  Thanks,

  Bob.
