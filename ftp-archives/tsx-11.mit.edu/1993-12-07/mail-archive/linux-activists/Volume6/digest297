Hello netters,

Not sure if this is the appropriate place for this question.  We received
a 9 track data tape.  The tape was backuped from a Data General system. 
After two weeks' struggling, we got noting but funny binary code.  Is there
any way to retrive the data from tape?  Many thanks!

  The documentation that comes with it says that vgatest
must be setuid root.  To do this, type (as root)
'chmod 4755 vgatest'

if you're using OI (or thinking about it), get the manuals. $60 total
gets you a @250page user guide on uib and more importantly a >1000page
OI programmer's guide that is very well written (from my novice
point of view). professional, not the pr common with dos stuff; 
besides being a tech ref, includes nice little examples. 
 where i work, we're downsizing; i plan on oi being my main
development tool. btw, in the oi ref, page Notes-2, one can read:

"OI runs on SunOS, AIX-RS/6000, HP-UX-HP9000/700, IRIX-SGI, Ultrix-DEC,
Linux-i386; it has been ported to a few other platforms as well."

that oi is free on linux is important to me; that it is not free on
the other systems that my company uses is not a problem-they're used
to buying software!

I had a look at SLS on tsx-11.mit.edu site about two weeks ago
it wasn't on 0.99pl13 then.. it might be now.

However I have got my Linux box up and running with what was then the latest
SLS distribution (1.03) with these helpful notes from various comp.os.linux
contributors

Here they are with bits edited out and with some annotations (enclosed
in **   **):
===========================================================================

Some Hints for tcp/ip-Networking under Linux 0.99p12
With many thanks to Gerhard Schneider who showed me the right way.

** I didn't look at this much - thought I'd come back if neccessary**
** It wasn't - my SLS seemed to have most things set.              **

** I did set up a few things on my own however, these were         **
**                                                                 **
** 1. /etc/hosts file                                              **
** 2. /etc/host file                                               **
** 3. /etc/rc.net - this needed one important change which wasn't  **
** documented, but judging from several posts did cause some       **
** trauma, (probably due to newbies like myself who have no idea). **
** Getting back to the change - basically, you have to ensure that **
** the if config command gets the right parameters, particularly   **
** the correct id name of your network driver (in this case eliii) **
** For example my ifconfig line read something like this:          **
**                                                                 **
**      ifconfig $IPDEV 127.0.0.1 up netmask 255.255.255.0         **
**              where IPDEV was set to eth0 and needed to be eliii **

1) It is essential to use /lib/libc.so.4.4.2 (4.4.1 does not work!)
   In general you should use the Slackware Installation package -
   ***but*** libc.4.4.2 can (up to now) only be extracted from the
   SLS installation.
2) Your router has to be within your netmask area.
   for example:
   network netmask  router              netmask
   128.130.4.0      128.130.4.1         255.255.255.0       ok
   128.130.4.0      128.130.6.1         255.255.255.0       won't work      

3) You need a network entry in /etc/networks
   for example:
mynet 128.130.4.0

4) Example of rc.net or rc.inet1

MYNAME=`/bin/hostname`

# Attach the loopback device.
/etc/ifconfig lo localhost
/etc/route add localhost

# Set up the Ethernet connection(s).
/etc/ifconfig eth0 ${MYNAME} netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 128.130.4.255
/etc/route add mynet
/etc/route add default gw 128.130.4.1 1

============================

[...]
                3c509 --
                        A new card for 3Com. It should be cheap and have
                        excellent performance. The drawbacks are that it
                        _requires_ very low interrupt latency, and it isn't
                        rated for bus speeds greater than 8Mhz. The driver is 
                        written, working, and included in pl12. But it
                        seems to triggers a Linux TCP bug, so it's not built
                        as part of the default kernel.

                        There is also an alpha version of a Linux 3c509
                        diagnostic and EEPROM setup program, but for now
                        users that don't like the defaults should use the
                        MS-DOS EEPROM setup program.

[...]

============================

...as for setting it up, well I have a few old posts here that describe 
how it is done, but as they are *almost* two weeks old, and hence out of
date. Besides, there have been some bug fixes since the pl12 driver, and
alpha pl13 has changed some of the ethernet device names, so if you can't
figure out how to use the one in pl12, I'd wait for pl13

*************************************************************************
** This (below) basically summs up what I did - 90% working after this **

I've just got the SLS 1.03 from tsx-11, the installation went fine, then I
follow the instruction from previous posts. 

(1) uncomment the line of 3c509 in config.in.
(2) add  CARDS   := $(CARDS) -DCONFIG_EL3 in /net/inet/CONFIG file
              **I added the D ^here in the above line**
              
**At this point I took note of another article (from Donald Becker the ** 
**guy who wrote the 3c509 driver) he said ...                          **

The 3c509 driver is still in alpha test, and potential users are expected to
know how to solve problems like this.  You'll have to add '3c509.o' to the
OBJS line in the Makefile.

You should probably take the opportunity to upgrade to 0.99pl13, or at least
fix a minor bug: in pl12/net/inet/3c509.c around line 512 change '0x3ff' to
'0x7ff'.

** I did this (i.e. made the changes to 0.99pl12) and then resumed the **
** steps below                                                         **

(3) make config, answer y in 3c509 option.
(4) make dep
(5) make zImage

** It took a while, a problem I believe that is reduced in 0.99pl13      **
** because the c rather than c++ compiler is used to compile the kernel, ** 
** 0.99pl12 was the first to use c++ I think.                            **

** I include this from a happy follower of Donald's advice because I like it **

Minor bug be blowed.  I just now made this change and converted my new
$170 3c509 from a useless tongue-tied Walter Mitty to a productive
silver-tongued Walter Cronkite.  It had been locking up when
transferring files bigger than the order of a kilobyte (had been
meaning to ask about this), which this fixed.  Thanks!

*********************************************************************
** Finally here's a few notes from Donald Becker                   **

I still consider the 3c509 driver as being in alpha test, but it's included in
the pl13 kernel.  Just uncomment the 3c509 line in config.in, run 'make
config' and compile as normal.

The beta version of 3c509 driver won't be out for a while; I plan on doing a
re-write to use predictive interrupts.  It's likely the I'll get the EISA
3c579 probe working and tested before then, so there might be interim release.

BTW, net-2debugged has no relation to the 3c509 code.

Finally, I'll be on vacation in Colorado for the coming week, so don't feel
offended if I seem to ignore bug reports.

Subject: Re: Help: SIOCADDRT error running /etc/route in NET-2
Date: 8 Oct 1993 14:40:56 GMT

Hello all,

I think that I can give some insight to this SIOCADDRT problem.
The rc.inet1 adds the default route to be your own IP addr. This is the
line that gives you the error. I am a sysadmin for a Sun network here and
we don't add the the route for the local machine IP address. ie each machine
does not add it's own address as a route. All of the clients of the server's
add the server as a gateway. One route. All of the servers add the router
for the network and all of the other server's.
Correct me if I am wrong but route only gives you a route off your wire.
that should be all that you need is the one route to get to the gateway.
Enclosed is a little map of our network to make things make sense.

The only suggestion that I can make is that term should not be run in 
the background on your linux box or the sun.  when I shell to kermit
to start term, i use
        !term <>/dev/cua2

and haven't had any problems.  Hope this helps!

What Linux needs is the idea of "priviledged" libraries.  In other
words, if a certain library call has "root" access then the kernel
will allow it access to things like the VGA card ports.  IBM
mainframes have this kind of idea and it's pretty neat.  The reason
IBM did it was so programmers could access parts of the system without
bothering the operators and yet they didn't have total access to the
machine.  It's a good compromise that doesn't hurt security that much.
Of course, I doubt this is easy nor is Linux likely to get it... but
it's still a neat idea.

   Surely there is a better way.. Someone just has to make it up.

Use a program like asroot which will run a command as root for any
user.  Of course, the root user specifies exactly which commands can
be run with asroot (some versions... even the parameters).  I guess
you'll just have to trust yourself... :)  This program and variations
can be found here and there... I cannot remember a specific place right
now.  Anyway, you just place an "asroot 4755 $(TARGET)" or something
like that in your Makefile and you should be just fine.

Subject: Pass Through Video in Linux, X?
Date: 8 Oct 1993 14:58:55 GMT

Hi all.

I've recently had an oppurtunity to check out several boards that make use of
VGA boards' "feature" or "pass through" connector.  Such devices include TV
receiver boards and Creative Labs' "Video Blaster".

These devices are really very nice, but not enough to justify running DOS,
much less Windoze, which is where they all run :)

So, my question is this: has anyone considered/attempted/wriiten a driver
for any of these devices?  What I have in mind is TV in an X window :)
I don't figure that anyone has done this, so I am willing to try and do it
myself, but I have no experience writing drivers or X stuff (kind of leaves
me out in the cold, I know... :)

If anyone who has more experience in this kind of stuff than myself would like
to come along for the ride, I'd be very appreciative!

Finally, *YES*, I know this is a very silly endeavour indeed.  Yes, I know
that the socially redeeming value of TV in X is little to none.  So, please,
direct any flames to /dev/null.  That's where I'll put them anyway :)

Thanx!
