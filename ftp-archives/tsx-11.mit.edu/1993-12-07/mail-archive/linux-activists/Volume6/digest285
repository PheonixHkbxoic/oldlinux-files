AHHHHHHH!

If I see one more post asking, "What is Linux?  Will it run on my
SuperTurboZippy 386-16?  Is it Unix?" post, I'm going to become violent.
Since the people who post these things obviously don't have the common
courtesy to actually *READ* the Linux groups before blindly posting,
perhaps we should do them a favor.  Everyone should collect a complete
set of HOWTO's, and whenever one of the above questions appear, send them
to the poster.

Cripes, I'm only 26 and I'm already complaining about the young
whippersnappers who don't have a clue about politeness. :-)

Date: Fri, 1 Oct 1993 13:49:17 GMT

Hi,

I've got a backup of all my Coherent stuff that I'd like to load
into Linux. The backup is in the Coherent cpio format on a diskette.

The trouble is that I can't load it into Linux. There's a difference
between Coherent's cpio and others because I can backup and restore
a diskette that I made only with Linux in the Linux cpio format.

I purposefully used cpio to back up my stuff because the manual said
that it's more portable than tar, however, I've never had trouble with
tar before.

I can't reinstall my backup to Coherent and used a different format 
because Coherent isn't on my hard drive anymore.


Thanks in advance,

First of all You should read the FAQ and the documentation that comes with
lilo. Everything I will tell You can be found there.

The default Boot-image is the first one that appears in the /etc/lilo/config.
In Your case Your config should look like:
---- begin /etc/lilo/config ---
boot = /dev/<Your Boot-device (probably Your 1st HD, i.e. /dev/hda)>
prompt
delay = <what time do You like?>
message = <Your message file with path >
compact
other = /dev/<Your DOS-partition (probably /dev/hda1)>
        table = /dev/<Your bootdevice (probably /dev/hda)>
        label = <Whatever you want, maybe "Dos"?>

image = <Where is You Linux Image? mine is "/zImage">
        root = /dev/<Your Linux-partition (probably /dev/hda2)>
        label= <Whatever You want, maybe "Linux"?>
--- end /etc/lilo/config ---
Don't forget to do a "sh /etc/lilo/install" whenever You alter either Your 
config-file or one of the images.
Hope that helps,
Joerg

I am looking for a SCSI controller which is compatable with Linux.  I
would like the least expensive available which will give reasonable
performance.  Anyone know (or own) such a beast?  I am purchasing a
second disk for Linux and would like to buy a SCSI rather than IDE.

Hello there:

        When I was installing the Linux (SLS 1.03) on my 486/33 DX, I got the 
following warning message on the screen:

Math coprocessor using exception 16 error reporting

I just can not figure out what it means, because everything seems running ok
after I finish installing the Linux (Main base system + X11). 

        Any help or suggestion will be very appreciated.

It's not a warning, but an informational message telling everything is
all right, things are working as they should and everything is really
splendid.

ftp to tsx-11.mit.edu.  In /pub/linux/ALPHA/scsi there are some scsi
related patches.  The One for Pl13 MAY include the 1522 support.  If not, in
that directory is an aha1522 directory that has the 152x driver in it.  I
believe the current package only includes a patch for Pl13.

I didn't realize that your having heard of a product was the definite
proof of it's existance.  Unfortunately for you, Island Draw, Write
and Paint are not unknown.  They've been around in the Unix market for
a number of years. I don't know where you've been, but if you're just
crawling out from under a rock that's your problem, not the rest of
ours!

:-) Have a nice day.

Don't woory, this is just the report, that you _have_ a coprocessor (in your 486) and that
it uses an error reporting scheme via interrupts.

I do not know whether it is a good idea to put this all into one program,
especially since many people should contribute to this program - I cannot
do it all alone. 

I will throw myself at the user-maintainement-stuff first.

The tool I would like to use for this task is the ObjectInterface/ObjectBuilder
of ParcPlace (tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/packages/OI) since it has good
documentation in paperform :-) and seems to be good c++.

Otherwise I would say: xview3?

Any Ideas - sources - to contribute?

You may obtain the driver from tsx-11.mit.edu in the ALPHA/scsi 
directory.  It works beautifully under my SLS 0.99p12 system and our
thanks go to Juergen Fischer.

I believe he released it for folding into the next release, but I do not
know if it made PL13.

I need to find out what my options are for a SQL RDBMS would
be for the following operating systems: OS/2, Windows NT, 
Novell or a PC based Unix.  

I have the following server requirements:
        1) Must be able to support up to 300 users.
        2) The users will be dialing into the system via a
           high speed modems.
        3) Portable to different operating systems.

The client requirements are:
        1) The client software will be running on a PC using
           Windows 3.1.
        2) GUI will be developed using Borland Object Pascal,
           so the client SQL side needs to be available for

If you have any suggestions, I would be appreciate it if you would

summarize if others are interested in this information.

First off, lets move this out of comp.os.linux (a dying group). I'm moving it
to comp.os.linux.misc (not .help, this is a legitamate bug)

Second, while the above _WORKAROUND_ will work, it is _*NOT*_ the proper 
final solution. The proper fix is for X to be compiled so that the SIGHUP 
signal handler is either not one-shot, or is reset, so that X doesn't just 
exit on the second SIGHUP. It seems X is expecting BSD signal handling, 
and is getting POSIX.


Again, this is a serious _*BUG*_ in Xfree86 which must be fixed if Xfree86 
is to be useful in production enviornments and to be considered reliable, as 
opposed to just a toy. It wil be considered a toy by those that need a 
_working_ system, unless _KNOWN BUGS_ eventually get fixed.

Luckily, when I mentioned and fixed the kernel bug with kill -0 pid back in 
0.98pl0, it was made part of the kernel for 0.98pl1. I hope the Xfree86 
people will be as responsive to this problem has Linus was with the kernel.

P.S. Don't say: "Why don't _you_ fix this bug too?! Not unless you will give 
me a free 1GIG hard disk."

I wouldn't be so frustrated, if the people in charge and those on the 
newsgroup acknowleged this is a bug, instead of pretending it is okay. 
A bug is a bug, whether you admit it or not.

I've got a client here that runs TCP and NFS on a 8 MB Partition of a 20 MB
Drive in a 386SX with 4 MB of ram.
