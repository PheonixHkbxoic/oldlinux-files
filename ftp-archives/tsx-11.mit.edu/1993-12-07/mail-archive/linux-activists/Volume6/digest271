Kindly keep your personal and unproductive comments to your self.  We find
the software to be extremely productive, flexible, cost effective, and
open.  Perhaps you two should tell us which wordprocessors you use and like
so others can say yours suck.  

Also, perhaps you should enlighten us as
to a better wordprocessing system under Unix?  Framemaker isn't bad, but
TERRIBLY expensive.

Currently xfree86-2.0 is still using the standard vga 6 bits per color 256
color (8 color plane) mode. There was talk of getting 8 bits per color (for
the ramdacs that support it) before 2.0 but I don't think this is so likely
now - but this is slightly of the subject.

To get > 256 colors on an ISA based card then first we require somebody to
port the MIT newcfb 16 bit framebuffer code to the SVGA banked video model.
This is pretty nasty although quite possible. I would expect that a "wait for
2.2" would probably be more accurate time scale. To do 24 bit would require
writing from scratch the framebuffer code. The MIT newcfb code has support
for 32 bit but not 24 bit packed pixels which is unfortunatly what almost
all SVGA cards use (the expection I know of is the S3-928 cards with the
BookTree ramdac which can do 32 bit truecolor - possibly the ATI mach32 can
aswell).

Subject: Re: PC for linux
Date: 28 Sep 1993 19:49:49 +0200

Hello,

well, what follows is my opinion and not an order :-)

Oki, there are some things that this PC *must* be:

- It must have a processor 386sx/16 or higher (intel, amd .. whatever)
- I think you must have at least 2 MB RAM
- A Harddisk bigger than 20 MB (for basic systems)

You will not get very far with these minimum requirements. I would suggest
you get a 486dx or dx2. A 386 can do it, too, but as you will need to
compile a lot with linux (kernel updates all the time), you better go for a
486, since 386 are not much cheaper. For memory: get 8 MB if you will not use
X windows and 16 MB if you want to. You can run X with 8 MB (even with 4 I
heard), but it won't be very pleasant. Harddisk: get at least a 245 MB drive,
IDE or SCSI. Get SCSI if you want to use several disks, cdroms, scsi tapes
or if you simply want to ensure you can move the HardDisk when switching to
another computer system (which will support scsi for most cases). Note: IDE
drives are not slower than scsi ones (well, depends on what model of course).
Monitor: get at least a 15" model .. I would go for a 17" monitor, which is
ideal for 1024x768. The video card: get an accelerated one. Linux runs
with most cards, X with many. I would suggest an S3 chip based cards, since
they offer good speed at good prices. Avoid diamond cards (well, not all are
bad, but you won't get into trouble hopefully without a diamond card).
Especially don't buy a viper: this one is fast, but will maybe never get
drivers in Xwindows. I'm using an orchid VA vlb, and it gives me great speed
under Xwin (there are a *lot* of other nice S3 cards, the best are the S3 928
based ones). Floppy drives: at least a 3.5" drive. Buy a 5.25 drive only if
you need compatibility to your friends 5.25" disks or similar. Then, get a
mouse (needed for Xwin or selection, a cut'n'paste "driver" for terminal use).
Linux supports many mice, even bus mice.
Note that I didn't cite a minimal konfiguration, but with this system you
will have no problems originating from hardware. An estimated price would
be ranging from 2000 to 3000 US$, you may even find it for less (also for mor
:)). If you need more details, send me a mail or ask people on #linux in IRC.
Hope I helped you a bit.

Philippe

PS: I would not buy anything less than the above :) It's more expensive at the
    start, but you won't regret it.

Subject: **WARNING: EXPO computers won't work with TCP/IP, NCSA, Linux, ...

   A few netters reported networking problems with EXPO computers. It
seems that Expo Computers Inc. is not committed to making their computers
compatible with LINUX, TCP/IP, etc.  Here is a summary of my telephone
conversation with one of their Tech-Support people:

  1.  Expo Computers are not guaranteed to work with Linux, TCP/IP,
      NCSA software.  The only network software they tested are:
             NOVELL, Windows/NT
  2.  Expo computers uses 8-bit SIMM and 8-bit Cache.  They will NOT
      exchange 9-bit SIMM and 9-bit Cache for you even if this is
      highly suspected to be causing the problems.
        **NOTE**  8-bit SIMMs are usually used in MACs.  Very few 486
                  PCs use them.
  3.  EXPO computers are designed for the general public ONLY, NOT for
      scientific/computing people.
  4.  EXPO Computers Inc. will not do any exchange if the machine is
      not working with TCP/IP, LINUX, NCSA.  In other words, they
      will not do any exchange if you are running into problems with
      software which is not tested by their lab.

If you don't consider the above appropriate, please either email me or
call Dan Swanson at (800)-288-3243 (Tech Support). I will forward any
comments from the network community to EXPO Tech and post their response
later.

Thank you very much for your support.  If you are also having problems
with an EXPO computer, please send me your name, phone number, and Email
address.

Not only macs, but just about every workstation on the market as well. 
In fact PC's are the only machines that I know of that have a parity bit
anymore.  If you think that 8-bit SIMMS are causing you problems why not
get a good memory checker (like QAPlus or testext) and run it for a few
hours.  I strongly doubt that the simms are causing you any problems,
and if they are most simm manufactures warrant their stuff for life now.

I agree with the rest of what was said though, and I would agree that if
the above is true that people shouldn't buy their machines.
