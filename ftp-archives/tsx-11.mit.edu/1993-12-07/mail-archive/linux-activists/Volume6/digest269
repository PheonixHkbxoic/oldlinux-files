=====================================================================

        NOT JUST ANOTHER LINUX + 386BSD CD-ROM.

Trans-Ameritech presents LINUX SLS/Slackware AND 386BSD and MULTYMEDIA CD-ROM.

A new Linux CD-ROM is available! But not just Linux. Also 386BSD and more.
Here is a brief summary of why we think this CD-ROM is the best.
As the price of only $30 puts it in the same price category as the JANA 
product, I'll base my comparison on it.


We provide 2 versions of SLS distribution - a very stable 1.02 and the new 1.03
and also the SLACKWARE distribution! Linux installs directly from the CD-ROM
on almost any hardware configuration.

1. The Trans-Ameritech Linux CD-ROM is not just a mirror of some ftp site. 
In addition to the full SLS distributions we supply a "live" image of a 
configured system. This is great if you don't want files that are not used 
very often to garble your hard disk. One example is manpages - use them 
directly from the CD-ROM. Same applies to emacs lisp files, info files etc.
How many fonts do you need? Have them all! Space is no problem.

2. Uncompressed sources are available for instant reference.

3. Several versions of the Linux kernel are provided precompiled to cover 
different hardware options including drivers for Sony-31A and Sound Blaster 
CD-ROMs.

4. Patches to support sound cards are included. Take this compiled kernel IF 
YOU WANT. If not - use a small kernel with no unused ballast.

5. Install Linux directly from the Sony-31A or Sound Blaster CD-ROM drive as
well as standart SCSI and Mitsumi types.

6. We are running Linux on several PCs to make sure that our configurations
really work. We don't wait for official SLS release for certain extra drivers
and utilities. If they work here, we include it as an option on the CDROM.

7. For your convenience a full recent distribution of 386BSD *NIX is provided
on the same CD-ROM.

8. Some space is dedicated to what takes too much room on hard disks - 
sounds and pictures. They are usable with the Linux sound/gif tools and under 
MS-DOS too!

9. A few choice MS-DOS applications are included in the assumption that the
majority of Linux users run DOS occasionaly. Or use it from dos-emu!
Most of the MS-DOS stuff comes from the SIMTEL20 archive. Naturally only part 
of it made it to the first CDROM. However the new releases will include other 
files from SIMTEL20, GARBO etc. So if you subsribe to the Trans-Ameritech 
Linux+ CDROM, you will not only get updated Linux, but over a year you will get
the full SIMTEL20 collection as an extra bonus.

10. Trans-Ameritech is a well established company with efficient organization
to guarantee on-time printing and shipping of this product. There will be a
significant discount if you subscribe for future releases.

But the best part is that YOU will decide what to put on the next edition!
We'll count votes and provide most popular software on the next one.



You can order by phone (408) 727-3883 or by FAX (408) 727-3882.
Our address is:
2342A Walsh Avenue
Santa Clara, CA 95051

Shipping overseas (as in UK and Germany) is $6.
Shipping in US is $5.
Pay by cheque or credit card.
COD in continental US is $6 extra if you want it.

The price for a single CD-ROM is $30. 
California residents, please include tax.

We plan to make a new release every 3 month. Subscription price is $20 per CD
for a total of $80 for a year.

Slightly on a tangent, free reports only 13800 K total on my 16 M
machine. Its .99pl10, btw.

Does anyone know where did the rest go (I know that 1 meg is kernel text
plus IO space; I'm still missing at least a megabyte?)

Included in hte kernel:
SYSV IPC,
ext2, minix, dos,
no SCSI,
inet,
no soundcards.

Thanks,

BTW, I read I have to enable IPC during boot. How?

        We want linux installed as a gateway, but we are having problems with the second
        NE2000 card. Linux boots ok, but only detects the first card and seems to stop
        searching for others. Both cards are well configured (had been tested under MsDos to
        avoid IRQ conflicts and other configuration problems). It seems that we should add
        a second array for the second card in /linux/net/inet/Space.c, but how should we call
        it to make the kernel know of it? Thats the way to do both cards work?

        Any help will be apreciated.
        Please reply by email preferably. Thanks!

I don' think IBM will tell you about their machines, as an example take
the Micro Channel Bus, Linux won't run on MCA bus machines, because
IBM won't tell "us" how to program it.

This is not to speak badly about IBM, but to warn you that 

the only machines hat aren't 100 % IBM compatible is IBM machines,

and the don' tell YOU about their secrets.

Many times more?  First of all, the IPC is a three-year old target, with the
same processor as the SS 1+.  You can probably get either one with 12M (max
with 1M simms)on the IPC or 16M on the SS1+, with a 16" color monitor and
200M disk for about $2200-2500.  This gives you enet, SCSI, sound and a
monitor that is about the size of some "17 in" monitors I was looking at the
other day at a PeeCee store.  On most benchmarks this system will be
somewhat faster than a 386/40, but faster by a factor of three than a PC
system with a generic Tseng 4000 svga card.  If people want to compare
486dx2/66 machines, lets make sure they are compared against Classics or
LX's.  These machines comes with a minimum of 16M.  They also include sound,
enet, faster SCSI, so lets put those on the PC.  They may also come with a
minimum of 400M disk, but I am not sure.  Last I checked the Classic was
available at an academic discount price of about $3300 with the 15"
monitor.  The LX with a 16", I believe 32M of memory, and a 400M disk was in
the low-to-mid $4000 range.  I believe these computers would outperform the
high-end PC at about the same price with comparable features at comparable
price.  Raw speed is not the only issue, however.  On many tasks it will
take you a long time to pay back the investment of time it takes you to port
or find a ported version of a package that compiles out of the box on a Sun.
Linux is a wonderful thing, but if you want access to all the free packages
on the net, SunOS 4.1.3 still provides an edge and the costs are comparable
for comparable performance.  Also with SunOS on SPARC you never have to deal
with IRQ's, DMA conflicts or base address conflicts for your enet, asynch,
parallel, mouse,sound and video adapters.

>P.S. I am sorry about your computer, time to upgrade rather than get angry.

No need for most tasks, unless he is like the DOS heads I know who want the
latest hardware so they can do one thing at a time faster.  I still find a
386/16 with 8M, slow RLL disk, 8-bit enet and standard ET4000 video adapter,
running SVR4 (slow) to be preferable to a faster PC running Windoze or DOS.

ez was ported by Michael O'Reilly, the author of term, who might argue about
how easy it was.  He uploaded it to sunsite about 2 weeks ago.

As far as I know, no support for greater than eight bits color depth
is supported by Xfree, and will not be in the next release.

However, I think that sometime in the future this capability will be
supported.  (I saw one comment that said, basically, "Wait for 2.1")

Since joe, jove and emacs are all insert-mode editors that understand
^F,^B,^N,^P,^A and ^E, I would arrange them like:

vi--elvis-----vile-----------------------joe-------------jove---------emacs

(I left out uemacs on purpose because the last couple of versions I tried
did idle-waiting and mucked with the permissions of the files I edited with
it.)

In the above scheme joe would be (sorta) emacs-like.

Hi everybody!

As I already mentioned I asked Island for a port of their quite powerfull
office software package "Draw, Write, Paint" to Linux. It contains a
Wordprocessor, a program for creating Images and another for vector
grafics. I think it would be the right thing for everybody who is
locking for a standard software package. 

I got an answer some minutes ago. They know Linux, but at the moment they
have no plans to make a port. This may change if they will see a real market
for a Linux port. 

Now it is your turn!!! Please send me an E-Mail if you are pricipially willing
to bye a package like "Draw, Write, Paint" for Linux. 

I want to show that there _IS_ a market for commercial Linux software. Please
don't dissapoint me :-).
