Hello.
I have SLS 1.0, version 0.99.pl6-29
running on a HP Vectra, and an Adaptec 1542B Scsci hOst.
I have a 3com 503 Ethernet board.

Any attempt to access the network, other than loop back,
gets Network is unreachable.
It seems to be identifying my board ok, it sees my
address, i.o and shared memory, it uses my IRQ of 2,
My IP address is configured correctly,
HOWEVER!
I have no access.
I noticed that I don't have a /dev/eth0 or /dev/eth_if
as described in the FAQ.  Should I have?
Should the make Config have created one?
Do I need to create one?

Note, I did read that just because your card works under
Dos, it doesn't mean it isn't broken.  For the record
it has operated under Dos and SCO recently.  What's more,
Dos is running (with FTP) with the same IRQ settings, so
I do not believe it is a conflict.

Thanks for any help anyone can provide.


... Sincerely, Derek

Hi, Flame me if this is a FAQ. But I just spent an hour looking at the
faq for linux and the one for networking. 

Anyhow, my question is:

Can Linux talk to any DOS or OS/2 type networks, specifically IBM token
ring? 

I will summarize and post the answers (if any).

Simple (& probably dumb) question:

Can I mix OS's in the extended partition?  I want the partitions
like:

Can I do it & whose 'fdisk' should I use for which bits?

Over the weekend I installed SLS 0.99pl6-26 series A, B, C, and D
(T and X to follow this week).  Everything went well especially
considering it was my first experience with FDISK.  (When you say
"ok delete the partition", it's gone in a flash!!!)  I have a couple
of questions:

o       The only cron I could find was crond in /usr/bin/.  I created
        a crontab (crontab -r (no crontab -e?)) and started crond.  All
        I got were zombie then defunct crond processes?

o       Is there a "logger" command or c-call for the syslog?

o       setterm settings seem to be lost when I do the "man" command?

o       Any recommendations on where and how to clean up /tmp and shell
        history data?

o       After I finish my installation and stabilize the configuration I
        will learn how to compile the kernel so I can upgrade.  Do I
        have to apply all patches (in sequence?) from 6 on?

o       Are there any database packages that work under linux?

My previous setup was DOS 5.0 and DV/X.  So far this is much more interesting,
seems faster, and is definitely multi-tasking rather that something exotic
sitting on top of DOS.  DV/X, however, is a very nice package, probably the
best release 1 package in my experience.

Thanks in advance,

That's not right! 0.100 < 0.99!

Anything from .991 to .999 would be more appropriate.

But since only 2 digits of resolution have been used on kernel versions I
figure 0.99pl13 -> 0.99pl99 -> 0.99pl100 (why not?) -> 1.00

There are several reasons for this:

(1) These programs are intended for use on any *nix-like system.  As a result,
they aren't precompiled for *any* system.  DOS, on the other hand, is for PCs
and nothing else.  (I hope nobody's stupid enough to believe that an NT binary
for a PC will run on an ALPHA AXP....)

(2) Compile something for SLS and it might not be able to work under MCC
because of hardcoded pathnames to system files.  Eventually this will settle
down, but for now things can move around.  Which leads to:

(3) Linux --- the whole system, not the kernel (most especially I mean SLS)
--- is still early beta, if that.  Do you know of anyone (aside from Microsoft
and its favorite vaporsystem) who tries to pass off an early beta as a
finished system?  Most of the discussion of Linux as the future operating
system of choice is intended to discuss specific areas in the current
early-beta version that need to be addressed before it can happen.

It rewinds because the default device for mt is /dev/rmt0, which is
the rewind device.  If you really want to do mt weof, say "mt -f
/dev/nrmt0 weof", but see below, since this is rarely needed.

The kernel will automatically write an eof on the tape when tar closes
/dev/nrmt0.  At that point, you can issue the second tar command and
it will create another file on the tape.

%One thing to check for in cases like this is what arguments the shell

Most likely, Linus is right. I had the same bug under Minix. The fix was:

diff /net/bsdsrc/net2/bin/sh//cd.c ./cd.c
217c217,219
<       if (chdir(p) < 0) {
---

>       if (p[0] != '\0' && chdir(p) < 0) {

Maybe we should create a news group comp.unix.development.portable to create, 
port and maintain utilites that run on multiple various (unix-like) operating
systems. (As an example, I recently ported the BSD make to Minix. I probably
has to fix the same things as in the port of pmake that was announce recently).

  I haven't been following this thread, but I had the same problems with

sz and rz and recompiled them and the problem went away.  If you'd like
to have the particular rz/sz package that I have then let me know and

Hi, hackers.

    I have problem in using minicom came with SLS 1.03. After the cursor
reach bottom of the screen, all following text is displayed at the bottom
line rather than scroll up. That's frustrating. I use virtual console and
term for minicom is set to vt100. I also set the Unix host dialed in to
vt100 or vt102.

    Second, I download the source for pcomm and try to compile it with
"make install", but gcc complain header <linux/ctypes.h> not found.

    I check linux is a link in /etc/lib or somewhere? How do I resolve the
reference path problem?  As far as I know, <> include file refers to 
default include directory.

Talk to you later.

All the best.

Subject: [Q] Why SLIP Drop Out?
Date: Tue, 17 Aug 1993 12:26:20

I have SLIP running reasonably well here using 0.99pl10 with some of
the
newer patches (am not at the system right now so can't be more
specific
than that right now), and everything seems to be running well except
...

Every now and then the SLIP connection just breaks and drops out for
no
reason.

The connection will stay up for hours, and then drop out in the
middle
of a session ... other times it will drop out with no one online ...
other times it will drop out three or four times in a half hour and
then
will stay up all night and all the next day.

Whenever it does drop out, I do a "ps gx" and "dip -v slipparm" is
still
shown as an active process.  I have to kill it and then restart it
(I'm
sure there is an easier way to restart it but haven't looked deeply
enough into the readmes and man pages to figure it out).

Has anyone else seen this problem?  Would the newer versions of the
kernel (pl12 or whatever) have anything in them to fix this or
address
this in any way?

Other than that one thing, SLIP is working very well here indeed. 
But
that one thing is creating big headaches.

Please respond either here or (preferably) via e-mail, and I'll
summarize any e-mail responses for the net.

Only if you assume that version numbers are floating point numbers.
Not all people assume that.

1.0 -> 1.1 -> 1.2 -> ... -> 1.8 -> 1.9 -> 1.10
is a perfectly natural sequence.  If version numbers were floating
point numbers, 1.10 would be the same as 1.1.

Personally, I prefer to have each dot-delimited part of a version
number treated as a non-negative integer.

There s no kbhit(), you need to call cbreak() before you call getch() this
