Hello...I'm using 0.99p11 and I've set up the appropriate ftp subdirectories
and permissions as per the man pages. Now I have a few questions:

1) when I log into the ftp server using ncsa's ftp program, I don't get
any login information other than the standard login, password prompts.
Where do I tell linux to issue a welcome message when somebody uses
anonymous ftp?

2) I have moved ls into the /home/ftp/bin subdirectory as per the man
page, but when I issue a 'dir' command from the remote ftp client, I
get the following message:

/bin/ls: can't load library '/lib/libc.so.4'
        No such library.
Transferred 65 bytes in 0 seconds(0.063 Kbytes/sec)
226 Transfer complete.

I tried installing links to libc.so.4 in /home/ftp/bin, but that didn't work
and the permission for the links in /lib are set to 777...
what am I doing wrong?

Thanks!

I setup the ftp lastnight.   /home/ftp becomes the root directory.  
Therefore find where lib lives in the real system, and copy the file there 
in the /home/ftp area.  ie:  /home/ftp/lib/libc.so.4  No special permissions 
were required, although I made everything read only except for pub.


Remember, the ftp server sees /home/ftp as /
If something wanted /bin/xxx, it is actually looking in /home/ftp/bin/xxx

I haven't examined the Linux internals in sufficient detail but found 
/dev/tty used in SVR3. There, /dev/tty is simply an alias for the com
device into which one has logged. 

Even if one has redirected stdin and stdout, a program can access /dev/tty
and be able to send output to or get input from the user screen. If a program
needs to use io control instructions to turn off echo for password entry
or to set raw mode for an editor, it need only point to /dev/tty.

Problem is, some programs are able to open either the original tty or
/dev/tty in an exclusive mode which makes programs fail when they attempt
a reopen via the other name. On SVR3 it only affects my console, occurs
only after a reboot and goes away after the system has been running for a
while. 

Perhaps a kernel hacker in the audience can tell us where the semaphore is
that locks each tty device.

I think he (like so many people) is not realizing that the
"used" column = "really-used" + "buffers", and that the buffer
space will mostly be freed as processes need it.

If it were up to me, I would have the free column represent
"unused" + "buffers that can be reclaimed" (is there a fixed minimum
which will always be allocated for buffers?) and stop all this
confusion once and for all (although it is interesting to watch
that free number once in a while to see if it ever really gets
to 0).

Are you talking about slave mode DMA using the AT chipset DMA channels?
I assume you are... it would be nice to get a driver that used that
capability.

Now I'd really like that... My WD Caviar (170 and 340) drives are quite
fast enough now, but I'd love to see scatter-gather & DMA support in the
drivers.

OK. It seems that the technical problems encountered by the group trying
to develop a driver for FDC based tape streamers are unsurmountable, for
the moment at least, so I'm looking elsewhere for a backup system. During
my search I came across the following (affordable?) solutions:

- SCSI based Sankyo tapestreamer for about $450. 250 MB capacity.
- SCSI based Archive ""          for about $600. 525 MB capacity. (includes
  an Adaptec SCSI controller, which I don't need).
- IDE based Summit tapestreamer for about $350. 300 MB capacity.

has anyone used these gizmos (un)successfully with LINUX?

        First, thank you everyone for your responses.  They were helpful and
were able to get me on the road to a more speedy solution.
        As you will see from the comments below, there are other things for
PC/TCP/IP than Sun's PCNFS.  Most attractive seems to be Beam & Whiteside's
package which, if you are a largish sight, might be cheaper because of
their bulk rate discount.  The Wat package also seems to be quite good,
except that it doesn't do NFS.  
FTP software also offers a good package, and, for an extra fee, they do
offer NFS.  
        The most useful piece of information was, by far, the pointer to
comp.protocols.network, where, there was an entire FAQ addressing this very
subject.  If you cannot find it in the news archives, mail me and I will
send you a copy.  
        Thank you again for your help and I hope that this summary is useful.

Note that the comments below are unaltered (except for deletion of some
lines) and are in no particular order.
If you requested a copy of this response via private electronic mail, then
it is en route.

From: vanepp@sfu.ca
Myself I would have a strong look at Novell (especially if these are only
PCs and not Unix boxes as well). The Novell clients and servers are 
designed to run on PCs, not Unix semantics molded to fit DOS. The Novell
stuff can run on old machines (such as XTs) that would have trouble 
supporting PC-NFS. We have converted from a mainframe to Unix around two
years ago, and run something like 21 Novell servers around campus (there
are around 2000 machines about half and half Macs and PCs out there).
Much of our Unix printing goes via lpr to a Novell server that then 
spools it to one of 6 HP3si laser printers spread around campus. The
current growth industry in our machine room is not the Auspex NFS file
server (at some 24 gigs) but rather a Netframe running Novell that is 
currently at 5 or 6 gigs, and is going to jump to 10 or 15 gigs over
the next year or so. We thought about exporting the Auspex file systems
out over the backbone, but performance and security concerns stopped us.
It looks like the customers are voting with their money for Novell, and 
we are lagging along behind.

Hello!
I've been evaluating Sun's PC-NFS (version 4 and 5) for the last couple of weeks here at Ericsson Radio System. The result is that it do work, but you might want to check out other possibilites.
With PC-NFS installed you can use network connected printers / harddrivers without any problems at all. The harddisks are used just like a local one, ie d: etc. And the same goes for the printers. The installation is quite straight forward. The software is windowised (except the installationprogramm), and it makes it quite easy to use.
I hope that this gives you some kind of usefull information regarding PC-NFS.
Please do *not* reply because this is my last day here (going back to school...)!

Yes!!!!  I have done this at a number of places of work.  Personally, I have used SUN's PC-NFS, and FTP's, and even as we speak I am looking at Novels LanWorkPlace(LWP).  I have heard bad things about WallenGongs (a year ago), I can not think of any others off hand, but I know there are many!

I think this is the may to go, especially if you already have UNIX around to act as servers.  (Personally, I would not by into a single vendor (NOVEL) when you can by into a standard that many companies are following)

Just something to think about.

We use PC-NFS with a 486 server running SCO-Unix.

Yes, network drives can be made to look like a local drive.  It's also
simple for individual users to set up their network directories as local
drives, which saves a lot of typing :-)  E.g. g: rather than f:\usr\fred\me\

The only problem I've had has been in renaming network directories from
DOS.  The various utilities/commands that do this seem to create a Unix-
style link, so you end up with two apparent directories (old and new)
but only one copy of the files.  When you try to undo the problem (e.g.
by "removing" one of the directories [which means deleting the contents
first of course]) you end up with *no* files in the remaining dir :-(

You can usually get around these problems by logging on to the server
in Unix and doing any necessary directory maintenance from there (i.e.
using the Unix mv command to make the new directory from the old
structure).  The normal DOS md, rd, cd, commands work OK; the only
problem is in attempting to *rename* directories.

Cheers,  Ian S.

Currently, we use Wollowong's Pathway package, you need to packages:
Access (this is the TCP/IP) and the extra NFS package. I don't
remember how much they cost, but it's a low cost. They also sell the
software for the Mac and the Vaxes with VMS so you can use NFS in all
your machines!

Well, personally I like Wollongong's software, it works with the
drivers of clarkson, has SLIP support, remote printing, file sharing,
and it's easy to install. It ocuppies about 20-25k of RAM with all
options enabled.

Hope it works,
Miguel.

Maybe if you have enough money you could think about banyan vines.
It's very easy to maintain, but it costs $$$$$. Or you can try to use
lantastic or the very cheap little big-lan. (only 99$ for one network)
I hope this may help.

Assuming that I understand what you were asking for, Fou might look into 
Banyan VINES.  It is a good stable system (it is based on Berkley UNIX and is 
more stable than Novel) that is fairly cheap.  My site is sunning on a VINES 
network and we are quite pleased with it.  You also can have it running on a 
SCO UNIX platform.  If you have any questions/requirements let me know (I 
didnt see your original net posting).

Take a look at FTP Software. Their PC/TCP package includes Interdrive,
an NFS client *and server* for DOS and/or Windows.

From: combssf@salem.ge.com (Stephen F. Combs)

Brian,
        Here at GE Drives we use Sun's PC-NFS (co-existing with 3COM 3+Share),
and FTP Software's FTP-TCPIP package w/nfs support.  Also available is
Beam & Whiteside's TCP/IP-NFS package (I don't know what the product name
is) which we have used on a couple of machines (again co-existing with 3com)
The FTP product we use is version 2.2 and runs on top of Novell's IPX
(dual protocol stacks, Novell apps talk IPX while FTP apps talk TCP/IP)
Thanx,

I had a very similar problem, except that lpr worked fine when I was 
the root user.  I first suspected a problem with permissions, however
after setting those up according to the LPR FAQ, lpr still would not
work for anyone but root.

A little poking around in the /etc and /usr/bin files revealed that there
were two different copies of lpr.  The copy which worked resided in /etc,
the other in /usr/bin.  I don't know if there was a reason for having
the two copies, but I after I moved the "good" lpr from /etc into
/usr/bin (in the path of normal users) the print spooling system worked
as it should.

>and recompiled it, after which lpr/lpd works. So what's up with Slackware :-?
                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Is having two (different) copies of lpr an oversight, or is there some
(subtle) reason for this?
