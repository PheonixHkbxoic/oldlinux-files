Hello,


This might be asked before, but I can't read this newsgroup - so please
give me an answer if you can.

I have tried to use the high speed floppy mode (1 MBit/s), which
is already implemnted in the newest kernel release (0.99pl11).
Unfortunately, I don't know what values I have to put in for the two
gap's (see linux/kernel/blk_dev/floppy.c file_type[]).
Can anybody give me the correct values?
 
Please send any answers/suggestions to:  max@pre-soft.de

Absolutely true. I run Minix on a 25 MHz 386 with 8MB RAM and it runs
just fine. Even though the VM-system doesn't support shared text (don't
even speak of shared libraries) even X is usable (as long as you don't
try to run xv and gcc at the same time while editing something :-).
With 16MB it would be just bliss.

I used to run a System III Unix (PC/IX) on an 8MHz 512k XT. It worked
fine. I even did most of my C development under PC/IX, because the C
compiler was so much faster than MSC under DOS. Unix isn't a resource
hog (although Berkeley and AT&T did their best to make it one :-),
although many applications (especially X programs) are.

Hi Linuxers:

Just a semi-rancid joke to help you pass the day. You need the tcsh
to run this; it won't work for bash users. So, if you do use bash:
just startup a (temporary) tcsh and try it out.

At the prompt, type:
        %blow
The % is necessary. Then watch for the output....

The DX2/66 is within the VLB specifications because the VLB uses the 
external frequency of the processor (33Mhz). We use one DX50 and three DX2/
66 computers and we found, even without a clock, that the DX2/66 is faster

As usual, you can't just make this generalization.

There are many different things that can bottleneck a system. Once
you have "enough" memory, adding more doesn't improve your system's
speed at all. Enough means enough that you don't swap in normal use.
For me that has been 16 meg. I can't see me going over 16 unless someone
gives me some for free. Well, perhaps the idea of "get as much as you
can afford" is correct after all, since most people would cringe at
$600-$800 for more than 16M.

However I do agree with you that 8 is better than 4. The unfortunate
thing about 8 is that with most motherboards that means filling all
of your 8 simm slots with 1m simms -- then if you want to increase
that, you have to get rid of your 1m simms. In some cases it may be
worth paying a premium for a motherboard with a more flexible memory
configuration (in my case, I found a buddy who wanted to buy a system
and swapped memory with him in order to upgrade from 8 to 16M). 

For the purposes the original poster had described, 8M is plenty
and 4M is probably sufficient.

Subject: Probs with SQ-01 SCSI / SLS 10.3
Date: 30 Aug 93 15:11:18 GMT

Hello Linuxers!

I've installed Linux SLS 1.03 on a 486-PC which works fine.

After installing the Seagate/SyQuest-SCSI-Host-Adapter SQ-01 to add
a Quantum LPS 105 MB (works under DOS), I can still boot Linux (with
LILO), but I can't boot the SLS A1 Bootdisk.

I always get the following error:  Error 0x04

When I recompile the kernel and allow ST-01/ST-02 support, the
SQ-01 Host-Adapter is correctly found (as a ST-01) and the SCSI drive
is found, too. But then the following message appeares:
"scsi host timed out - aborted"

Who has an idea about that which could help me?

Mainly the error beeing unable to boot the SLS A1 disk seems very
strange to me, as without the SQ-01 there are no problems..


Please send your hints, suggestions, etc. via EMAIL (as I don't read
this group every day...) and maybe as a follow-up, if there were others
with the same problem.

Thanks for your help!

     Holger

For Linux users only...

I have an Adaptec 1742 SCSI controller with a Wangtek 5150ES QIC
streamer.  I am trying to use the tape under Linux with only some
(useless) success.  I would like to hear from anyone who is
successfully using this equipment combination.  PLEASE get in touch!

Problem in a nutshell:

  mt -f /dev/rmt0 status         FINE
  mt -f /dev/rmt0 fsf            FINE
  tar cvf /dev/rmt0 .            FINE

  tar tf /dev/rmt0               HANGS!
  tar xvf /dev/rmt0              HANGS!

With the last couple of commands the tape turns for about 1 second
and then stops.  The system locks.  The message (ow two!):

SCSI Unit 2 timed out - Command aborted

appears.  Unit 2 is indeed my tape.

Can somebody PLEASE help?

Please contact me directly on: KKEYTE@ESOC.BITNET

I have a 80486/33 EISA board with a normal local bus slot - no vesa

X11 performance is _very_ bad when having disk i/o (nn, relaynews).

Ok, perhaps better using some of the S3 Chip based Vga boards as the 
Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 ?! It certainly improves X11 performance a lot.

I wouldn't suggest using a local bus card in connection with
an Adaptec SCSI controller which does DMA busmastering.
I have here a ET4000 local bus card for testing. The cpu has
to wait, if the SCSI controller does heavy disk/DMA activity,
therefore X11 graphic output has to wait, too.
Then when you have lot's of X11 window/scroll activity, the
cpu does exclusively access to DRAM.

I have the certain feeling, that local bus video cards and 
a scsi controller acting as bus master handicap each other !!!!!

8 Mb is the absolute minimum ! better 12 or 16 MB !!! Really.

Subject: oleo 1.5 hangs m/c 8-(

Hi,

I compiled up oleo 1.5 (from prep) after doing a straight configure and
two small tweaks, (PATH_MAX and random). When I run it it hangs my machine.

This is entirely repeatable.

Hey, - I'm having quite a few hangs here with pl12 *and* I have Linus'
patches in...

I've had it suggested that I have a hardware memory problem, - but that
seems unlikely to me. 

Any thoughts wonderful folks?

regards

Derek Jones.
