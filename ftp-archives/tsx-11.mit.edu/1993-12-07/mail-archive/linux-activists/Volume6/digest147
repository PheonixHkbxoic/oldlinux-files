Subject: MetroLink Motif/Linux::Some Resource files not traced::Help
Date: 20 Aug 1993 10:26 EST

Hai:

I have MetroLink Motif installed. Everything seemed O.K
but, I observe the following problems:

        Some X applications (xterm etc.) find their
        resource files (in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults directory)
        but xman does not see its file.

        I observed this problem only when I found my own
        application was not tracing its resources.

        Is there something that I am missing?

        XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, XAPPLRESDIR
        are set as follows

        /usr/X386/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N
        $HOME/app-defaults/%N
        $HOME/app-defaults

I appreciate someone giving me some insight and help

Thanks

No, there are not drivers for the SCirrus chipset in the TI. There ARE

You're right, but that's not what I'm talking about.  As it was
explained to me, the BSD folks want the binary itself to be as
small as possible, to fit on extremely small root partitions and
take up as little space as possible on boot disks.  For this they
are willing to sacrifice some speed.

Nay, Xfree1.3 doesn't support OAK cards, because OAK didn't lean their specs.
Last month they sent the specs to the Xfree team, and they're supposedly
working on an OAK driver. Nevertheless, I wouldn't expect it to be out until
the Xfree2.0 release (currently in early beta). Don't know when would this be,

Probably IOZONE is not the most interesting benchmark here. What's
likely happening is that first the IOZONE writes the 8MB file into the
buffer cache, at least partially, then 'sync' starts writing it out, and
while this is going on IOZONE rereads the file.

The *only* accurate way to test effective read and write rates is:

1)      mkfs an empty disk partitions

2)      mount the filesystem
3)      write the file to the filesystem a longer than total memory;
        fsync
4)      umount the filesystem

5)      mount it again
6)      read the file from the filesystem.
7)      ummount the filesystem

You should time the time from the start of writing to the completion of
fsync in step 3). Also, step 4) is essential.

This said, the ext2fs filesystem does not give the optimal bandwidth
(even if I think it is better than the BSD UFS, as it is less
complicated); it has mainly two defects: the allocation strategy becomes
suboptimal with full disks, and, more worryingly, it does not do dynamic
(at read/write time) clustering, which is the worst defect.

I also think that looking for runs of 8 free blocks is not a
particularly effective static (at allocation time) clustering strategy,
bu without having a look at the block addresses for a few files it is
hard to be sure.

If anybody feels like investigating this latter point, it is very easy
to instrument fsck so that for each file it reports the runs of absolute
block addresses it occupies. This would make it easy to gauge how
effective is static clustering.

I cannot remember well, but perhaps dynamic clustering would require
some changes in the strategy routine of the drivers. If not, adding it
is probably a two minute change: just figure out whether accesses to the
file are being sequential, and if so preallocate and then read/write
ahead/behind N (where N may be fixed, say 8-32, or variable) blocks
instead of 1. If this is done supporting large blocks and fragments
thereof becomes useless.

Subject: SCSI doesnt find my hd in Linux

hello,

i have a problem with the SCSI driver. it doesnt recognize my harddisc.
configuration:
OS-version: linux-pl12, aug-15 (without the net22 patches)
Controller: Seagate ST02:
HDs:  a) ST-296N
         jumpered at address 1
      b) CDC 94221-5 59780015480 , cly: 1515 head: 5 sect: 47
         CDC = control data
         jumpered at address 0

I have already been able to read/write the disc:

a) took the disc and put it in a Sparc. no problem.

   using the sun-monitor command "probe-scsi" reported all attached

   SCSI devices; and that's where I got the disc description from,
   (the string saying CDC 94221-5 ....)

b) took the disc, and put it in the PC.

   low-levelformatted it (with debug;g=c800:5)
   used dos/fdisk to generate a partition on the CDC
   used dos/format to generate a MS/Dos filesystem
   did a copy a:*.* c: , which worked okay.
   a "dir c:" showed all files on the CDC disc being present.

c) when I boot Linux, only the SCSI Adapter is recognized.
   the SCSI Disk is NOT recognized, it says:
   scsi: 1 hosts.
   scsi detect 0 discs total.

Even when booting the machine , the ST02 BIOS will report that there IS
a disc present. I think, the problem is in the SCSI driver in Linux.

On the other hand, when I connect the ST-296N disc, this disc wil be
recognized, but still the CDC disc will be missing.

Summarize: worked with Sparc, worked with MS/Dos, did not work with Linux.
I think the problem could be in the SCSI device driver...
Can anyone tell me where to start searching for the bug ?

Greetings, Herp

A printed installation guide that's well balanced between terseness and
completeness.  The remainder of the documentation is all online, as man pages
or other document files... not to mention the sourcecode itself.  If you can,
go for the CDROM distribution, as you can put the disk online and have all the
goodies up for perusal without soaking your hard disk.

If you've ever admined a BSD'ish machine before, you'll not have much trouble.
If you haven't, then I suggest you troll the bookstores for a book on 
system administration in a BSD'ish environment.  That and the man pages should
take care of anyone.  I don't have a good book recommendation off the cuff,
though.

Right, (actually I would recommend to put it in /tmp in this case) but
it should be recommended to NOT run term as root. Reason? This would
give the root on the school machine root on your home box as well
(actually anybody who can access the socket).

Or have I missed something important here? Perhaps an option to term
to deny trsh connections would be nice (you still can get in via trsh
and telnet, but then you have to provide the proper password.)

Okay, this probably is not going to help.  But, if anyone can give
some advice I'd really appreciate it.

I have a piece of software that runs great under SunOS 4.1.2 but
every time I try to run (after of course recompiling) on Linux
I get a segmentation fault.  I have tried to debug this
code to no avail.  Bascially, it appears to be a moving bug, the
code that I get the annoying sig-11 is nothing special, either
some assignments (pointer copies), or a function call.  Again,
I said this thing moves based on how I try to debug, (I have tried
gdb, and the old fashion way of printf's).  I can of course comment
out the call, and the code runs appropriately (minus what the function
was supposed to do).  Tried to trace the function back to the beginning
and of course did not see anything useful.  Basically, its beginning
to look like a bug in either the compiler or the OS (nahhh, its got
to be in my code somewhere, but why would it work without a hitch
on a sun).  As I said if someone can tell me that there are or 
are not bugs in the compiler/os... or what to look for, or just
give me a word of incouragement...
