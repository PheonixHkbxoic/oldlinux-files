   Don't you mean that aligning data on word boundaries will make the
data access faster?  I don't see why *checking* for this alignment
would speed things up.
   Seems like that there is a choice to either align your data or
not, but why enforce one way?  If you want it to be faster than
align!  I think that gcc does align on word boundaries in all of the
normal cases.

The version supplied by SLS is old, plus it looks like it doesn't have terminfo
entry for vt100 (which is the cause of your problem).

You can try getting 0.7.3 from netcom.com:pub/zmbenhal or wait a week or so
for 1.8 to come out officially.

Subject: 99p12 - SLIP and DOS-ka9q anyone?
Date: Fri, 13 Aug 1993 23:37:00 GMT

Hello,

I tried today to connect my linux via SLIP to an i286 with
ka9q, but somehow I did not succeed.

I do not know to much about ka9q, most of the documentation refered
to the packet-radio-stuff, and so...

I managed to get something onto the wire from both sides, I tested it
with terminalprograms each.

(connected via nullmodem)

Only a ping never got ansered as far as I could see, and ofcourse nothing else.

On ka9q I took pk0 as device, on linux it is sl0.

On linux I did:
dip -t
remote 1.2.3.4
port cua1
speed 38400
mode SLIP

On ka9q - as far as I remember - I did an 
attach asy 0x03f8 4 pk0 2048 1500 4096 38400
(I do not remember the exact syntax).

Doing a ping on ka9q did come back immediatly without answer - only
the local ip got a positive res=55 or something...

What Do I have to do to get the beasts running together?

What have I done utterly wrong?

Every help welcome, please mail me.

Cheers, Michael Will

From experiences with bash 1.12 I know that also Configure scripts (e.g.,
the one from trn) and INN's shell scripts are also *extremely* good in
exercising Bourne-compatible shells.

I'm hoping someone can help by e-mailing the patch level 10 for

FAQ say I need the newer library which in turn the FAQ says
I need linux.99pl10.   I only have access to uunet archives

p9 and p11.  SO, I'd really like p10.  If some nice soul could

Subject: Problem compiling wih gcc from SLS 1.03
Date: 15 Aug 93 21:11:05 GMT


I am having problems with gcc 2.4.5 installed from SLS 1.03. The compiler
complains about not being able to include stddef.h from within stdlib.h.
stddef.h resides in /usr/include/linux, but the precompiler does not
include this path when searching for header files.

If I then specify -I/usr/include/linux on the compile line, stddef.h does
get included correctly.

The next error is that float.h does not exist anywhere. This is also
included from within stdlib.h.

If I create a dummy float.h and try to recompile, I get a syntax error in
stdlib.h complaining about wchar_t being undefined. This is supposed to
be defined in stddef.h but isn't.

I have reinstalled the full c series to see if that fixed the problem; it
didn't.

Have I done something silly, or has anyone else had the same problems ?

Thanks in advance, Mark.

Under UNIX, usually the last 10% of the disk is reserved for root.
On most filesystems, performance suffers considerably if it is over
90% full.  So, when df reports 100%, that is 100% of the user portion,
not of the whole filesystem.  

As root, you can write to the last 10%, if you really have to.  It is
advised that you delete or compress something, since using up the
reserved portion of a filesystem is a risky practice.

Subject: My boot floppy doesn't work (yes, I read the FAQ)
Date: Sun, 15 Aug 1993 21:56:16 GMT

I have SLS 1.01 and it installed fine. I have been trying to upgrade to
linux-0.99.pl11 (and at the same time libc-4.4.1 and gcc-2.4.5). Yesterday
I got everything compiled ok, and did a make zdisk to copy the pl11 kernel
to a floppy. I tried rebooting using this floppy and I got the message:

VFS: Insert root floppy and press ENTER

So, I pressed enter and got:

kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root

Using HJ Lu's rootdisk, I could boot linux and mount my hard disk. I looked at
the zImage of the new kernel and it specified the root disk as the floppy
(that's what I specifed as ROOTDEV in the Makefile). I tried changing it using
rdev to my hard disk (/dev/hda2) and then copying that
to the floppy, but all it did was reboot the computer right after Loading.....

Apparently I'm missing something, and section III.18 of the FAQ is not any
help.

BTW: I tried using the old /Image but that didn't work either.

Could someone tell me how to boot from a floppy to Linux on my /dev/hda2 ?

Thanks,

Subject: disk corruption with e2fs
Date: Sun, 15 Aug 1993 22:58:22 GMT

Over the weekend my Linux system hung :-(

As in completely - it lost its ethernet connectivity, I couldn't log in on
any of the consoles, etc. In the end I closed my eyes and hit the Reset
button (owch!). Upon coming up, it screamed about having lost a tonne of
files, and threw them into /lost+found (it was the root partition that was
hit). Over 30Megs to be precise <:-((. That's what's odd - there is _no
way_ most of those files were open (even for read) when the crash occured
- it's my area where I compile things - and if I wasn't using it, then it
wasn't in use.

Anyway, things look really messy now, my /etc/fstab file has now become
/etc/fstab/ (a directory!), and when I re-created a lost directory,
everything in it got mapped into lost+found as well! (as in when I started
deleting files in /lost+found, it started deleting files create _since_
the crash). 

So it looks like I'll have to remake that partition. (BTW, my system does
a "e2fsck -a" at boot - like several people have suggested - but the man
page says "use with caution" - should I really be doing something else?).

Anyway, my question is - is there an "official" way to deal with such
occurences. If anyone has come up with a half sure-fire way of recovering
from a crash without going through what I did, could they Email me the
details? I'll summerize for the Net as I'm sure we'd all like to know :-)

Forget about trying to read Mac 800k disks, they use Group Code Recording
and variable speed which a PC controller/drive cannot handle. The 1.4M disks
use the same MFM coding and sector structure as used on PCs.

I gather that there are several packages around for DOS that will do exactly
what you want (ie read & write Mac disks), but I don't suppose you will find
source code ;-)

I am sure that the format for Mac floppies is in Inside Mac, I only have
vols 1-3 which of course do not include HFS (heirarchical File System)
disks ! What you need of course is the description and data stuctures for
HFS disks.

I would guess that HFS is described in IM vol 4 (the Mac Plus update) where
HFS first appears. There may be something in vol 5 (SE & II family) or Vol 6
(System 7).

One other thing, I think Apple have now discontinued Inside Mac (which was
getting somewhat BIG) in favour of a collection of volumes covering specific
areas - like 'everything to do with file systems and files in one volume' -
but I can't remember what they are called.

Reply-To: teffta@engr.dnet.ge.com

Has anyone tried to compile xdaliclock under Linux?

I got v. 1.05 and compiled it; it just apparently did nothing. I 
started it up in gdb and hit control-c and it appeared to be "stuck"
at a select() call. So I used -DNO_SELECT as suggested in the Imakefile,
same result.

I wanted the debugging symbols so I compiled with -g... and it worked!
I seem to remember that this forces static linking so I tried -static
instead of -g and it continued to work. 

While I should be satisfied that it works, it is about 10x the size
it should be. 

So, has anyone else run into something like this?

I'm using gcc 2.4.3, kernel pl11, libc 4.4.1. It links with libX11.so.3.0.1
and libXext.a.
