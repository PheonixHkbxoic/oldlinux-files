Subject: Backup in Linux
Date: 1 Sep 93 13:15:36 GMT

I'm trying to backup the hard drive. I've followed all the instructions (I
think) that are in the FAQ AND also for the backup program, but I just can't
get it to work.

Here is how I'd LIKE to do it:

        Back up the entire HD with my Linux partition so that if it ever
crashed, I could just restore it without having to install the entire 
system.

I've tried using cpio and tar. It seems tar would be better. The only problem
is that when it tries to write to my floppy (a 1.44 meg drive), it says 
"tar: only write 0 of 10240 bytes to /dev/fd1H1440".

After that, tar stops and doesn't prompt me to insert the next disk. I want
this to span floppies.

The command I use is:

tar cvf /devfd1H1440 /

My A drive is 1.22 meg and my B drive is 1.44. The HD is a 197 meg partition.

If anyone has a solution, I would appreciate it. I've just about tried
everything and I still can't get it to work.

Subject: Updating ISC to Linux or not?
Date: Wed, 1 Sep 1993 13:22:33 GMT

I am currently running ISC 3.0.1 on nitro.pp.utu.fi and now I got an
upgrade offer to Solaris 2.x. However, I have been thinking not to go
on with either but move to Linux instead. Is it worth the trouble - if
any?  Are there any specific caveats that should be considered (in
either of the systems)? At least the Linux sure seems promising
considering what other people and the FAQ tell about it.

There is one open question about Linux, that I know of. I have a bit
uncommon components in my system, specifically, I am using a Mylex LNE
390 EISA 32-bit ethernet board. I looked through the FAQ and the
compatibility list of Linux, but found no entries about the Mylex
ethernet boards. Are there any chances that Linux would support the
LNE390? If Linux does support it, I will seriously consider Linux and
probably at least try it before going with the Solaris.

What do you call media cost ? A CD is very cheap ... but I doubt
that the "media cost" for the gnu source CD is less expensive
as ordering their Linux ... or are they distributing the gnu
source CD as "presents at media costs ?" ;-)

I have rewritten the whole filter part, to avoid printer mismatch.
Because: When I try to print a ps file, which crashes gs, then it
leaves the printer in an insane state. Sometimes you have to eject
the paper from the dj500 manually (pushing Reset and/or FF button).

Another part ... reading the first line of print jobs is only ok,
if you have Ascii Text. Printing 'binary' data could confuse the
printer, since the read/echo construct doesn't work correct in all
cases ....

Then I wanted to make the auto-recognition-file-type part 
better for later enhancements ....
The big difference is, that the newer filter writes the print
job into a temp file. Now the command file is used, to determine
the file type. Now you can convert, filter, ... etc ...
the tempfile ... until you get what you want ...

Have fun !

Is there anyone who had compiled tsipp3.0?
I've problems with linking tsipp. There are some missing functions

It seems to be only a small mistake, but I'm not able to find yet.

I am considering using Linux on my system. At present I am using DOS6.

My spec is as follows.

486/66 VLBus
8MB Ram
ET4000 Local Bus display
15" Multisync

Can I buy a second harddrive and install Linux onto it as D:. Once both C:(dos) and
D:(Linux) are present in the CMOS, can I select on bootup which to use. If this is
possible, how do I do it?

I am downloading Linux 1.03 at present onto 30 HD disks, is there anything else I should get for the system as well.

Could someone please give me a general landmark for Linux on the above spec, compared to a Sun Sparc II or equivelent.

ANy other information that you might have on Linux, software, development, special
features, etc etc please let me know.

Thanks Paul (PAZ)

Thank for all the replies and for the benefit of newbies (like myself) I am
posting the solution:

I created a user id: useradd -m tom

but I forgot to : passwd tom 
which adds a password to the shadow file (and probably other stuff) and from
there it worked.  I also found that the -m parameter for useradd is extremely
useful because it creates the users home directory and changes the ownership.

Thanks for all the helpful replies.

I can't get 'ps' to work.  When I go to run it I get:

Make sure that a directory /proc exists, then include the following 
line in your /etc/fstab file:
/proc   /proc   proc    defaults
Then next time you boot, ps should work.  In the meantime do:
mount /proc /proc -t procps.c:/proc/uptime: No such file or directory

I have reinstalled the system from scratch and am receiving the same error
message but when I boot with the SLS - a1 disk ps works fine.

Any suggestions?

This is actually incorrect.  Try putting a line like this in /etc/rc:
/bin/mount /proc /proc -t proc

Works for me.

just alias pwd in your .cshrc or .login as follows

        alias pwd 'echo $cwd'

that's what pwd is on our 5500 Unix system here at BSU, and that's how I
get it to work both on the 5500 AND my Linux system at home on my 386

Avery labels cost around $35.00 at a store like Office Max,
but a non-Avery alternative can be ordered through MEI/Micro Center
(1800-634-3478) for around $10.97 for a pack of 70 sheets (680 lables)

Subject: binaries for converting GIF ==> bitmaps?
Date: Wed, 1 Sep 1993 16:53:00 GMT

Apologies if this is the wrong group, but I'll make it quick.  Are there
any binaries (or linux-fixed sources) for converting GIF images to X
bitmaps?  What about windows bitmaps to X bitmaps?

Thanks
