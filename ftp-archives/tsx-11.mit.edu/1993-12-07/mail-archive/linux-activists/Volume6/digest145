I would love to get that much from them.  I have been trying to get one of
their CD's for my BBS for about 4 months now (having sent at least 8 e-mail
messages and calling the voice phone number they used to advertise).  I
don't have a fax machine, so I haven't tried that.  I even received some
mail from Jay saying my CD was on the way (about 2 months ago).  The
strangest thing I got back from them was an empty e-mail message.  

Hey JAY, if you read this, get in touch with me.  I know quite a few people
here in Edmonton who want your CD.  If you send me a CD, I'll advertise for
you on my BBS, or even be your Edmonton distributor.  You aren't reaching
your greatest audience--those who don't have net access.

That Yggdrasil group seems to have disappeared, too (at least I haven't
heard anything about their final release CD).  The beta CD I have doesn't
have an image of tsx-11 or sunsite, so now that the version of linux on it is
old, the disk is kind of useless.  

The SLS CD is just too expensive, even with Peter's $200 for a 2 year / 4 CD
subscription.  Maybe if one came out every 3 or 4 months instead of every 6
months, I would consider it.  

Does anyone know if there is a wuarchive CD-ROM that has a recent image of
the Linux mirror there?

   As long as everyone is expecting 1.0 'real soon now', the developers working
on things have a much greater (psychological) incentive to "get their patches 
in" or "finish up that driver" before 1.0!  If we went to 0.10 (or 1.0), it 
would be easier for a developer to say "Well, I'll get it in the next patch-
who cares about making sure it works in version 0.1 or 0.11?"  There's plenty
of time to fix that bug later!  As it currently is, you send in your code to
make sure that your feature is included (and stable) for the imminent 1.0
version.  After all, 1.0 could come out within the next month or two!

Reply-To: simmons@EE.MsState.Edu

Due to errors in the installation of the news software on
my system, the return address was incorrect on my last
message.  This address should be correct.
Here is the original message:

When I try to initiate a SLIP connection with a terminal server,
DIP gives me a "SETD: Invalid argument" error when I attempt
to "mode SLIP".

I am setting the remote, port, and speed commands correctly.
(and also the local).

I have the terminal server set to always give me my machine's
IP address, and the terminal server prompts me that SLIP mode
has begun.  The terminal server is an Annex, set to handle
compression.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Date: Thu, 19 Aug 1993 23:24:00

Thanks to all who replied to my question about the best
books to buy to teach me how to program in C for the Linux
environment.

The one that some people recommended, and the one I'll
probably go with, is "C Programming in the Berkeley UNIX
Environment" by R. Nigel Horspool. Prentice Hall, Canada.
(ISBN 0-13-109760-1).

According to Patrick J. Volkerding:

"This wonderful book leads you through all the features of
C, including pipes, sockets, and other goodies as they apply
to interfacing your code with existing UNIX utilities, and
taking advantage of the TCP/IP capabilities you've got. Lots
of the stuff like header files, libraries, and pipes and
such get a pretty light treatment in most C books that don't
specifically target C for UNIX. This book is only 300 pages
long, but covers more stuff than any other one book I own."

Several people also suggested "The UNIX System Administrators
Handbook," as well,

Another suggestion was Richard Stevens' "Unix Network
Programming", which "describes the interface from C to
unix-system calls, such as socket(), sendto(), recvfrom()"

Thanks again to all ... one or more of the above is sure to
teach me what I need.

This has been discussed before at length.  Linus answered this question for
someone within the past few months.  After several people posted guesses
about what could be wrong, he asked the original poster to check his CMOS
settings and turn on caching above 16M.  In that case, it worked.

You should try that first.

If that doesn't help, you don't have a large enough cache tag RAM and will
need to upgrade it.  Some really cheap motherboards are not capable of
caching above 16M, in which case you will be better off without the extra
4M you just added.  You can already see the disadvantage of having any
uncached memory in your system.

Has anybody reported other problems with Linux/X11 on the Travelmate?
