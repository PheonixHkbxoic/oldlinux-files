Speed has nothing to do with your problem.  I suspect that it sin't
actually a problem, in fact.  Because of the way linux caches, free
memory almost never goes down as long as there is still real memory
available.  When you start swapping, old stuff will be removed from
memory, but newer old stuff will remain, still using most of your
memory.  It's harmless, and probably increases your performance.  Don't
worry.

Date: Wed, 25 Aug 1993 20:53:17 GMT


I am a current Linux user who does not wish to copy 30 diskettes again!
I have SLS 1.02 now and want to install 1.03, but this time I would like to
put the SLS distribution which I retrieved via ftp, on my Sparc 2 at work,
onto a tape (QIC-150 format) and install the new SLS at home with this tape.
There is no mention of how to do this in the install-guide-1.0.txt.

CAN THIS BE DONE?

I know that I must still have disk a1 on a floppy to begin the installation
procedure. What must I do to put all of the other SLS disk directories and
their related files onto a tape? Do I just use tar? Do I put all files into
one directory then use tar?

Help would be greatly appreciated.

Here is a quick partial solution.

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define PATH_MAX   256

main() { char buf[PATH_MAX]; puts(getwd(buf)); }

To compile & install do the following (as root):
cc -o pwd pwd.c
cp pwd /etc/pwd
chmod ugo=rx /bin/pwd
chown root /bin/pwd
chgrp roo /bin/pwd

Does anyone know where to find PATH_MAX? Shouldn't it be in unistd.h?

WARNING: 
This program will fail if you do something like this:

mkdir foo
cd foo
rmdir ../foo
/bin/pwd

Since I don't know what pwd is supposed to do in such cases,
someone else might kindly tell us (I guess it should return
a non-zero exit status).

I know, but still I think this is much 'more raw' than writing really

The values reported by iozone are almost guaranteed not to be exceeded
for physical i/o to normal files, so low values are good for proving
that your i/o system is poor.  It's high values that are usually
meaningless (they usually mean that part of the i/o was non-physical).

Read speeds much lower than write speeds are probably caused by
insufficent read-ahead by the file system.  This problem is often masked
by read-ahead by the controller.

That's only when DMA is being used, and since I have problems with the

        Wait a minute.  We shipped a fix for this problem at least

anybody else out there with an older revision who needs the Mitsumi

Subject: Re: Problem with EXT2
Date: Thu, 26 Aug 1993 06:24:09 GMT

I'm using SLS v1.02 (0.99.p12) and I seem to get consistenly recurring
filesystem corruption only if I use 'screen' (virtual terminals).

I get lost inodes, lost blocks, corrupted directory entries (once I even
ended up with a directory whose first two entries were both '.', even
e2fsck could not correct this, had to use mke2fs to fix), and once I even
had a .tar file magically aquire the status of a directory, lost it all.

As nearly as I can tell so far, this only occurs after I have run 'screen'.
I have tried two different versions, with and without setuid root, and even
with unprivledged ownership of screen, and have experienced corruption each
time.

Now I am trying to stay away from ever running screen, and see if the problem
goes away.  If not, I'm clueless.  If so, I'd suspect something odd about
fifos.

If all is well then, next I'll hack the Makefile to use sockets instead of
fifos and see if anything changes.

I frequently use my system via wyse30 in another building (hardwired) and
not being able to use screen is most annoying.  Corrupted filesystems are
far more annoying however.
