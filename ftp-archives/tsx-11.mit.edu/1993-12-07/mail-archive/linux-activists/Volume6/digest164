Subject: HELP, Linux mounts fs and goes to sleep!
Date: 24 Aug 93 12:42:21 GMT


Now here's a problem:

I have tvo hard disks in my system disk1 is a 245Mb and is used for DOS/Windows
disk2 is 125Mb and is used for (you guessed it) Linux.

I boot Linux from a floppy.

I don't know exacly what happened but it is eather me changing some configuration
or it's when I borrowed a CD and installed it. It insisted on beeing called
'disk D' (in DOS of course, I never booted Linux while the CD was installed)

the next time I booted Linux I got (when it was about to mount /dev/hdb1):

HD controller timeout (well I know for sure that this msg is NOT due to  
HD controller reset    me, changing some configuration :)
HD controller timeout
HD controller reset
...
...
...
      
I booted from the A0 disk and ran 'e2fsck /dev/hdb1' without a single warning 
message.
I mounted the disk under /mnt and everything seemed OK.
I placede a line in the beginning (after #!/bin/sh) of the /etc/rc file
saying: echo 'Starting rc' > /dev/console
but the text never appears on the startup screen :(
So it seems that it never gets to run the /etc/rc file.   

When I now boot linux from a floppy as I have always done it mounts /dev/hdb1
and then goes to sleep (appears to). if I type something on the keyboard it
appears on the screen. And I can reset with C-A-del without a prob (without
a message also).
The last lines of the text that appear if I boot from floppy are:
 
EXT2 warning mounting unchecked file system ....
[EXT II FS 0.3 93/04/22, bs=1024, fs=1024, gc=14, bpg=8192, ipg=2000]
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem)
Linux version 0.99.pl9-1 (root@softland) 04/27/93 00:02:59

Does anybody know what Linux is trying to do after it mounts the file system ? 

I could of course just reinstall Linux but I figure I will propably learn more
from reading the replies and fixing it myself (don't you just love this place?) 
:)

Oh yeah, and Linux 10.0 will be running 10 times as fast as Linux 1.0

btw, do you think linux1.0, if there ever is one, will be bugfree ? (just look
at sunos5.x) if you want version 1.0, simply patch tools/version.h

Nope.  All block devices under Linux are buffered.

I don't see any resistance.  Just because Linus hasn't done it doesn't
mean he won't let them in.  Everyone's busy.  Would you write them?
It shouldn't be too hard.

Not that they're all that useful anyway: speed tests and mkfs/fsck are
about the only uses I can think of, but I'll be happy to hear of
others.

You don't need a different Boot manager; LILO will work exactly the way you
need it to. You have to configure it to use prompt/timeout instead of just
delay. You can even have it display a custom prompt from a file. On My system,
the boot looks like this:


LILO

Enter "msdos" to boot MS-DOS or Windows NT.
or just wait 15 seconds and Linux will boot automatically.

LILO:

Subject:  Xfree 1.3 on ATI Ultra XLR
Date: Tue, 24 Aug 1993 16:50:10 GMT

I am running Linux .99pl11 on a Gateway 2000 4DX2-66V.
It has a ATI Ultra XLR card, with 2MB of VRAM and RAMDAC,
connected to a 17 inch Nanao Flexscan F550i color monitor.

Xfree 1.3 runs fine at resolution 1024x768, with a 1024 x 1024
virtual screen size.
Upon startup X reports: "amount of RAM on Video adapter: 1024k."
When I try to increase the virtual screen size, X reports
that there is not enough RAM. After setting "Videoram 2048"
in Xconfig, larger virtual sizes are allowed, but the screen gets
messed up if something is moved into the lower portion of the screen
(it re-appears on the top).

I guess my questions are:

(1) Is it possible to take advantage of the 2MB VRAM and RAMDAC under
     Linux/Xfree ?
(2) Is it possible to get a screen resolution of 1280x1024, non-interlaced
     (as advertised for the card) under Linux/Xfree ?

The card and monitor works as advertised/specified under Windows.

Here are some pertinent excerpts from my Xconfig file:

Any help, and possible settings for Xconfig for this card/monitor setup
are greatly appreciated.

Subject: Dummy IRQ questions (WRT 3c503 ether cards)
Date: Tue, 24 Aug 1993 17:07:52 GMT


Hi guys,

I hate to admit this, but I've never really understood the IRQ
scenario.  

I have two hosts, both using 3Com 3c503 EtherLink II cards and
often, the kernel reports that I have a possible conflict on 
IRQ 5.  Since I bought these boards 2nd hand, I don't think I
have the full docs for them.  

Can anyone offer some assistance here?  Specifically the info 
I seek is:

1) general desc of what IRQs are

2) what I must do to the 3c503 cards (jumpers??) to get them on
   a different IRQ so that they do not conflict.

3) how I can tell what the IRQs are for the other boards in my
   machines.


Any help on any of the above would be greatly appreciated!

Subject: Linux (not X) with Viper
Date: Tue, 24 Aug 1993 17:56:44 GMT

After much BS, I will receive a gw2k system packaged with the Diamond Viper.

I had specifically requested the ATI XLR, but I understand that ATI messed up 
some shipment or something, and my system is already a week late.  The only way
that I can get the system in my hot little hands is to accept the exchange 
for the Viper (albeit temporary).

I was wondering if I would experience any trouble running with Linux.  I 
would just like to get started with it until I get the ATI card, and I was 
 wondering if there are any specific programs that I can't run with the Viper 
card.  Also, can I run X in mono-VGA or something with the Viper?  I would 
assume this is stretching, but one of the most exciting things for me about
getting my new computer is that I could have Linux, and now not only have I
had to wait an endless age, but if I can't run X I will be real happy :(

Hello!
        I am using 2 diff modems to attempt to enable dialins and cannot
seem to get things to jive.
        I have a U.S.R. Sportster 14.4 and a Cardinal 9600.
My /etc/inittab enrty is:
        S2:456:respawn:/etc/getty ttyS2 19200 vt100
My gettydefs cascade from 19200 to 300 as follows:
        19200# B19200 CS8 # B19200 SANE -ISTRIP HUPCL # login: #9600
The modem string I'm using is:
        at E0 Q1 V0 S0=1 &C1 &S0 &D3

        It appears as though only a very few can get in. Most of time
the carrier is droped on them before they even get a chance to login.
        I have changed the string several times to no avail =;-(...
does anyone have _ANY_ ideas on this at all??? I'm going nuts!

I found that changing the DTR-drop-detect-time setting on the modems
helps a good deal.  Increasing the time, that is.  Here's what happens
when someone logs in:  (Someone PLEASE correct me if I'm wrong)

(The following also depends on how you have things setup in your getty
defaults files..)

getty opens on the serial lines.. .this raises the DTR on the modems.. making
them alert.
getty is waiting for RING or something of the sort.   
once getty gets this... it closes the serial line, which drops the DTR on
the modem, which (depending on how the modem is set) hangs up the connection.
then it reopens the serial line (or the cua line depending on your settings)
and runs login... etc.

I don't know why getty open, closes, and then reopens the serial line, but I'm
positive that that's why it hangs up.  So I use ATS25=<big number less than
255> to change the DTR timeout value.   You might check your modem manual
cuz I'm not sure it 25 is the right S register.  I'm going from memory here.

I hope this helps.

Subject: PS/2s are not all microchannel!! Does Linux work on these?
Date: Tue, 24 Aug 1993 16:57:24 GMT

The FAQ says "Linux doesn't work on microchannel machines"
(fair 'nuff) "This basically includes all true blue PS/2s"
(Wrong!  The high end of the PS/2 range are microchannel,
but all the low end stuff (upto the model 40) are industry
standard ISA (ie. PC AT) buses.  I have a PS/2 M40.  It
definitely has an ISA bus.  (Why can't people follow this?
I'm forever explaining to well meaning support personel
that PS/2 does not always mean microchannel).

I installed the latest release of Linux SLS on my PS/2 M40.
Rather, I tried.  After detecting nearly everything correctly
(right down to the soundcard) it tried to read my floppy disk
(which it identified correctly), but then it barfed trying to
read sector 2, the driver recalibrated, then it tried 4, and
0, reporting a 'floppy I/O' error each time.

Question: Is it microchannel that Linux can't handle, or is it
the advanced BIOS in these machines that can handle multitasking
at a BIOS level?  The FAQ says microchannel, but I'm starting
to think it is making an unhealthy generalisation.

Question: Has anyone got Linux working on a PS/2??  Say not and
I might have to write my own OS after all....
