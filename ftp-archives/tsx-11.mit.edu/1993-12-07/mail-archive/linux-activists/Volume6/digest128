Subject: Serial logins break in pl11&12
Date: Mon, 16 Aug 1993 23:33:02 GMT

Hello - I was wondering if anyone might be able to shed some
light on my problem:
currently I am running pl10, and I have two nullmodem cables
attatched to com3 and com4 to provide logins to two people
elsewhere in the house.  This works fine with pl10, I have the
cables wired so that DCD and DSR are held high by DTR and
the CTS is provided by the remote equpiment (kinda one-way flow
control). Anyhow- it works fine.

Fine, that is, until I use a kernel >pl10.  What happens under
pl11 and pl12 is this - Initially after reboot, the serial lines
have getty running on them and the remote user can log in (all
is good), however, the first time init has to respawn one of the
serial port gettys, it only gets about the first 3 letters of the
issue file out before it dies & is respawned again.  Hence, init
stops respawning it cause it happens to much.

Does anybody know what changes have been made to the srial drivers, 
or possibly what else might be the cause of my serial port gettys 
not to work after the frist go?  

I have recompiled getty (getty_ps107b) with the new kernel includes
and that doesnt appear to help, I thought possibly it could be a
problem with init, but everything else seems to work fine.

Any help/suggestions greatly appreciated.

                                Simon.

Well, for future reference (it won't help you now), it is advisable
to have a separate partition mounted on /home cause you really never
want to update anything in user accounts.  It also helps greatly if
you save all the config files in /etc and some of the others (such
as Xconfig).  Then you can normally just drop them into the new
installation (look at the new files to see if anything has changed first).

What I have been wondering is how to keep the changes that I make
(such as adding other binaries (or new versions)) in /usr/bin,
/usr/local/bin, etc...  I think that the inherited file system may be
able to help here, but I have not had time to get the docs for
it yet.  Anyone have any experience with using it this way?


Please keep followups in c.o.l since I do not yet get the
new newsgroups.

because, from the system programmers point of view, it offers the whole

Dos. A 486/66 or 486/80 is probably as fast as Sparc 2, too.
compare the DOS int 21h functions to the functions of unix/linux!

The only way to access a Double Space drive is with doublespace. If
you do not have it loaded (such as under Linux) you will see a few
files including one big file. This file is where your directory tree is.
Double Space converts this (decompresses it) on demand to show the
directory tree and present the required file.

I suppose you could fiddle with the DOSemu to get access to it.
Otherwise, you are out of luck.

        You don't need a special modem. Just a fast one with, preferably, V42bis,
for some, kind of acceptable, compression. If you can get a 14400 baud modem, and 
a slip server with similar modem, (meaning V42bis, 14.4 kbaud) then you are all
set. From personal experience, I can say that, the faster, the better.

        Linux for the moment, simply represents one of the most fertile areas, for
development and experimentation. Since the OS itself is still under heavy
develompent, it is not recomended to be used by "computer users" (No offence,
please). If you have the hacker in you, then you will use Linux, and you will
help develop the Windows and dos emulators so that you can run your favorite
programs. Otherwise, you can simply stick with MSDos, and Windows. After all, I
used to use programs like yours before I started using linux. (Borland C++, JPI
Modula-2, Turbo Prolog, MsWord, etc...), but ever since I switched, I found my
self being confortable using gcc and pals, LaTeX, and many other, of the hundreds
of programs that are there to use. I know how you must feel. You feel settled
with the programs that you use, and it seems imposible to change your
environment. I felt the same way a year ago, but , believe me, it only took a
single week to get adjusted to Linux's (Un*x under development that is)
environment.

Don't worry, be happy:

xboard-3.0 is going to be published during the next days.

I've tested it under Linux and it compiled and ran
without any problems.
You only need to define -DFLEX, but this is mentioned
in the INSTALL file, too.

I hope that xboard will finally be included
in the next SLS and Slackware distributions.

: I have 8 megs, I'm choking back the tears.  Try running X, emacs, a compile or 2
: and Xtank and watch it swap!

My apologies if I have already mentioned this; at the moment I am running
Linux, X386, XView, olvwm, an xterm, a clock and Seyon. I often run xv and
gcc. My computer: a 16MHz 386sx with 4 megabytes of RAM; Linux has 50Mb of
disk space plus 8Mb swap space.

Sure it isn't as zippy as, say, a DECStation, but it is very usable. OS/2 2.0,
by comparison, thrashed constantly, took 30 seconds to draw a window and
periodically switched into text mode to display the "No swap space; do not
ignore this message" error message. 

OS/2 lasted a total of one day before I nuked it. Linux, however, appears to
be much more efficient and usable (perhaps it's because of the tried-and-tested
UNIX formula) than OS/2, and probably than Windows/NT. Once the DOS emulator
is improved a bit (I/O handling added, direct console I/O in text mode and
direct [as opposed to xterm-based] display in X) and the Windows emulator is
released (apparently they have it loading and relocating Windows binaries),
Linux will be able to give IBM and Microsoft a run for their money.

This discussion has come and gone in comp.os.linux.development. Linux is
Linux is Linux no matter what platform it's running on. Therefore there
shouldn't be any separate newsgroups.

The reason you don't see anything is because the 68K port is not far 
enough along to have any kind of traffic but development traffic. So 
look in comp.os.linux.development for 68K stuff.

Oh and in answer to you first question there must be a discussion period,
a monthlong vote with a 2/3 majority and over 100 yes votes. Also after
a failed split you must wait at least 6 months before the next call for
discussion about another split.

Since the linux hierarchy has just added 4 new groups last week (August 11th)
you won't get a lot of support for any additional ones.

Later,

Xfree86 version 1.3 and below dosen't support S3.

XS3 supports and runs quite happily on both localbus and isa chipsets.  The
only exception is the localbus S3 805 cards.  Until recently linux didn't
allow access to the framebuffer address on these cards. Therefore access to
the video ram was done via an IO port (the Vendor "nolinear" keyword). This
slows pixmap copies down somewhat but is still quite fast.  
 Whether xfree86-2.0 will be able to reliable find and use the video ram
still remains to be seen - but the "nolinear" option will always be
available for localbus S3 805 based chipsets.
