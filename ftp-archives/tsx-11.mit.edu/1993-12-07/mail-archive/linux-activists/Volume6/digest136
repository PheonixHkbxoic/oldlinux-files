I assume in first instance you meant "ms" to be microseconds and in
the second instance it means milliseconds. Regardless, your timing
numbers are way to high and conflict with your later estimate of
a max thruput of 5 MB/s.

I always assume that a DMA /transfer takes four or five cycles (depending
whether it's a zero wait state device and/or how quickly your memory
controller recognizes the DMA request from the device). Therefore, on
a 10MHz bus that's about 500 nsecs per transfer, not 3 usecs. And 64KB
would take atleast 35 milliseconds, but since the CPU gets to use the
bus inbetween each byte transfer figure 70 to 100 msecs typically.

My guess is that a 10MHz bus probably maxes out at 1 to 1.5 million
transfers per second and might go as high as 2 to 2.5 million transfers
per second if you put the CPU to sleep.

Date: Wed, 18 Aug 1993 09:39:46 GMT

I am really impressed with the startup messages, using syslogk I can see all
that wonderful info from the SCSI startup code and diagnose all sorts of
problems. What I would now like is a utility which will list all of my IRQ's
and what it thinks is using them (if at all). Currently on my OS2 2.1 machine
I can use the Microsoft diagnostics utility (MSD.EXE) to do this, the output
window looks something like this:

I can of course use a boot disk with MSD on it, but I would then have to
find the SCSI drivers ... So is there anything I can use on Linux, once
it has booted to give me the above info ??

Thanks.

I asked a similar question on Monday and got some suggestions for
which I am grateful, but...

I would like to learn how to compile the kernel.  For example, I
would like to disable the 3-finger boot.  I read in a FAQ how to do
that.
o       Do I to apply all patches (in sequence?) from 6 on?
o       As I apply patches would a change like the one to C_A_D be
        undone?
o       If I recompile the kernel and later get a new series A, how
        do I install it?

For an SLS installation:

Look for a directory /usr/lib/timezone or /usr/local/lib/timezone.
In the directory you should find a file called "time.doc".  It will
tell you how to set up the timezone information.  If you can't find
the files/directories, look in /install/installed and check to see
if you installed the timezone package.  If you haven't, then you
better do so if you really want to succeed!

Ahh! But here is where Linux *does* have an advantage.  Each of us who
does know how to compile things, and will develop/port software, will
take advantage of it, and (more or less) freely share the result.
I can see 100,000 computer literate people packaging up Linux with
their favorite software, and handing it out to 100 friends each.
That is something that is illegal with MS-Windoze.  This "plan"
nets Linux 10 Million users!  (but only 100,000 USENET subscribers :)

I wouldn't fear this.  You can't stuff the genie back into the bottle.
So much of the source is c, and the concepts of the assembler fraction
are so sound and out in the open, that Linux will have a tremendous
positive effect on freely-distributable operating systems forever.
Nobody will ever be able to un-spend all the effort Linus et al. have
put into this project.  Now any (ambitious) cs student with a big hard
disk can take the Student Project RISC of the Month and port a real OS
onto it.  (Based on my experience, this will be much easier after the
first port, like the one apparently in progress for MIPS architecture,
because that port flushes most of the machine dependencies into the
open.)

I think the GNU version numbering scheme system is simplest after all

major.minor.patch

where each field is a nonnegative integer.  At least I think this
is the scheme they use; perhaps it's documented somewhere.

So I don't understand why SLS has to be "1.03", which implies a
two-digit limit to the second field, and why there have been so
many version of 1.03 rather than 1.3.0, 1.3.1, and so on.  (This
is just an example; I'm not picking on SLS in particular.)
