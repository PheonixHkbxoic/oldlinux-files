Hello again...

I posted a query a little while bach about my Future Domain card
not being seen by Linux, and I sorted this last night thanks to
the pointers from Martin (you know who you are ! :-)

This leaves me with two outstanding questions. Now I've added the
latest TMC-950 ROM configuration to the file, it ought to be added
to the kernel distribution (after testing of course) - How do I 
arrange this ?

Secondly - and more important to me, The Seagate SCSI disk I've attached
is not being detected at bootup. The screen reports 1 scsi hosts with 
0 disks 0 tapes and 0 cds. The drive is a VERY old 300Mb ish device 
which may be missing from a config. table somewhere. Clues please ?

Thanks,

Steve.

I have a problem (dont we all)

I am designing software on a Sun Sparc 2, in c and I am using cc to compile it.
It comilies fine in work, but when I take the source home and try to compile it
in Linux with gcc I get the following problems.

Im using gcc -ansi - traditional

In the following code, claimline is an array, s_time is type Double

            if (claimline[i].tra_det.s_time != NULL)

On the sun I can compile this code and the process of checking a double for NULL works
fine. But in Linux using gcc I get an incompatable data type error. 

I know that I could just write

            if (claimline[i].tra_det.s_time != 0.0)

and this would work, but if possible I just want to tell gcc to ignore and allow these such statements.

Please can someone tell me how to get around this problem with gcc.

Thanks for the help. Paz

You have to use bootutils found in sunsite.unc.edu, read the README
carefully, don't forget to mount your filesystem read-only *AFTER* you
installed bootutils proberly (with rdev or, better, put 'read-only' in your
/etc/lilo/config and rerun lilo).
This problem dosn't apear in SLACKWARE, there are the bootutils properly
installed.

Hi, I hope somebody can help with a problem I have loading Linux.
I have been given a series of Linus disks but I can't even get the boot
disk to run. When I boot the computer from the disk, it checks for comms
and printer ports. It then checks the SCSI Bus and reports the
following:-

Future Domain: BIOS at ca0000; Port Base at 140 using IRQ 5
Future Domain: SCSI Bus Reset
Future Domain: IRQ 5 Requested from kernel
scsi0; Future Domain TMC-16x0
Future Domain TMC-16x0 scsi driver version 3.5
scsi: 1 hosts
scsi (Future Domain): Abort Phase=2; target = 0 comnd = 0x00 pieces = 0 size =
 256
IMR = 0xdfd9
IRR = 0x0000
ISR = 0x0000
scsi Status    =  1
TMC Status     = 43
Interrupt Mask = 29
scsi (Future Domain): Abort Phase=2; target = 0 comnd = 0x00 pieces = 0 size =
 256
IMR = 0xdfd9
IRR = 0x0000
ISR = 0x0000
scsi Status    =  1
TMC Status     = 43
Interrupt Mask = 29

At thios point the system hangs with the HD light permanently on but
there doesn't appear to be any disk or other activity.

On the SCSI bus I have 2 hard disks, a Toshiba CD-ROM drive and an
Archive Viper Taper Drive. Both access lights illuminate briefly when
the disk first runs but go out and don't come back on again.
The BIOS is by AMI and is dated 6/6/91.

I have been given two different boot disks (by the same person) and they
both stop at exactly the same place and the second disk was tested
before given to me to try.

Any clues or hints will be gratefully received.
Please reply direct as I don't receive this newsgroup regularly.

Well not exactly. As Howlin' Bob explained it to me that while EDIT uses
the normal BIOS keyboard driver for regular operations, it switches to
the INT 16 KB driver when it pops up a menu. Why? Nobody knows. Two ways
to get it to work:

1) Do the multiple keystrokes very quickly. That way it never gets to
   the second driver.
2) Turn on the kbint option in the config file. However this is unstable
   at last report.

I personally use a version of vi for DOS.

May not be an issue, (since I don't quite understand /proc)
however my fstab is:

/dev/sda1  /   ext2  defaults
none       /proc  proc   defaults

maybe it is because you are looking for device /proc while
mine is stated that there is no device, and just use the directory.
oh, and I am glad to see someone else use the ext2 filesystem
(and not the Linux extfs)
I like the results, and it hasn't crashed yet!

Usually, /etc/securetty contains a list of all consoles that permit root login,
and by default it only contains the local console(s), I mean Alt-F1/.../F4, not
the virtual ones used when telnet-ing.

Hi, there

        only a few words on the diffs between SQL and QUEL (from a theoretical
point of view :-):

        -1-     SQL's query parT is mainly based on the so-called
                RELATIONAL ALGEBRA, a set
                of operators manipulating the relational tables, loosely
                speaking. This operator set is made up of the

                - Projection (SQL: SELECT) "get only specified columns out of
                        the target table"
                - Selection (SQL: WHERE) "select some lines (tuples) out of
                        the target table, matching a given predicate"
                - Join (SQL: FROM/WHERE) "append the columns of two tables,
                        connect those tuples matching a given join
                        predicate"      (called THETA-Join)
                - Union (SQL: UNION) "do a set union on the tuples of two
                        target tables of certain uniform layout"
                - Minus (SQL: ---) "do a set difference, like above"
                - Rename (SQL: SELECT renaming) "rename the column names
                        of the target tables" (useful for Joins)        

                :-( SQL does not implement the full relational algebra!!!

        -2-     QUEL is based on the RELATIONAL CALCULUS, theoretically as
                powerful as the ALGEBRA mentioned above. QUEL queries are made
                up of a Projection and Selection part, giving you all and
                m o r e  oppurtunities than SQL!!! Not as readable as SQL's

                        SELECT
                        FROM
                        WHERE
                        
                blocks but more powerful. QUEL is the choice of the early
                Ingres and Postgres implementors, overridden by SQL only for
                marketing purposes.

So get INGRES/POSTGRES and do QUEL-querying... It's the right thing :-)

This definitely qualifies as a FAQ. I've answered this question 4 times
this week and twice today. Is this question in a FAQ list somewhere?

As a security measure root logins are only allowed on secure TTYS. The
entry for these is found in the file /etc/login.defs. The entry can be
a colon separated list of ttys or a file containing the list of ttys.
In most default set of secure ttys are limited to the virtual consoles.
Therefore you can't log in as root either via telnet or via a serial port.

Please Note: This is a FEATURE! It's good security not to be able to log
in as root from anywhere. Any time you really need root acces you can log in
as a normal user and su to root. Oftentimes this prevents malicious access
from intruders and su forces the superuser to remember he/she is now root
and that you can now cause major damage to you system. I'd advise folks
unless there is a really good reason to have outside root logins, just
leave them alone.

I have recently installed the latest SLS release of Linux on my PC.
I've hacked and hacked and can't get:

1. lpr to print anything. I can redirect files to /dev/lp1.
   They get printed.  I managed to change the ownerships and
   permissions of lpc, lpd, and lpr.  The daemon is around
   as ps -x shows.  But it doesn't seem to get files to
   my printer.  BTW lpq shows the jobs queued.

2. X Windows to do anything. I have the listed video card and
   the 17" NEC 5FGe.  Can someone running this configuration
   send me some help (i.e. what I have to do to get this stuff
   to work).  Can I use the drivers that come with the system.
   My understanding is that they don't take advantage of the
   accelerator hardware.  BTW when I do a startx, all I end
   up with vertical lines and the cursor at the bottom of the

Looking forward to any light which can be shed on this.

README.term:
This package is a conglomeraton of ftpd-diku sources with
and also without the patches for shadowed passwords.
Both sources have been modified to use term calls rather
than inet calls to create data sockets, and as such should
allow you to enable incoming ftp connections via a tredir'd
link.  The limitation being that ftpd-term cannot support
passive mode ftp connections, which basically means it wont
work for people using the termftp or ncftp-term clients wanting
to connect.  This is a bit of a bummer, but really cant be
helped.

how?

firstly, decide wether you use shadowed passwords and
cp the appropriate Makefile.xxxx to Makefile

Make sure you have term's client.a and client.h somewhere
and that the directory where they reside is correctly
stated in the Makefile.

If you are using shadowed passwords, you also need one of
the shadow 3.2.2 object files 'valid.o' so make sure the
path to where that is, is also correctly stated in the
Makefile.

ok apart from these things, the setup is pretty much
exactly the same as for normal ftpd, so I shall leave
you to your own devices as far as setting up the package
goes..

how to enable via tredir?

remote% tredir {some-local-port} localhost:21

will pretty much have you setup & ready to go, and
someone can then telnet to your term machine by:

*** ANONYMOUS FTP

Because anonymous ftp does a chroot to the ftp users home directory,
some problems arise when ftpd-term tries to open the term socket and
cant find it due to the root being changed.  To overcome this, do the
following..

work out where term puts its socket file ('socket' is the filename)
- usually in some users directory, possibly roots. eg:
/home/root/.term/socket

if the ftp account's home directory is /home/ftp
then we need to make a directory
/home/ftp/home/root/.term
where /home/ftp/home and /home/ftp/home/root are mode 710 (rwx--x---)
and whos ownership is root.{group of ftp user} (usually 'other')

then, *after* term is up and running, make a hardlink of the socket in the
new directory:
ln -f /home/root/.term/socket /home/ftp/home/root/.term/socket

and bob's yer uncle. (hopefully)

IF, however, bob isnt your uncle and things become hasslesome and you
cant work out what the hell Im blabbing on about, please feel free to
email me, or find me on irc (nick: Mcv) and have a yarn.

Comments/etc greatly appreciated.
