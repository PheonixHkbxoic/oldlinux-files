Argh!  I found the FAQ posted in the very next newsgroup I read
here!   :-)
(comp.os.linux.announce)

However, if anyone can answer any of those specific questions
I asked, then I'm all ears!

Thanks  (and sorry I opened my big mouth two minutes too soon :)

     There's no such thing as nethack 3.10; if that's 3.1.0, then
throw it away and get 3.1.3, the current version.  If it's actually
3.0pl10, then throw it ever farther away. ;-)

Date: 10 Nov 1993 04:40:01 GMT



Hello,

I have already figured out the Video Mode table values for my monitor in the
Xconfig file.  However, I do not know what chipset to use for my VGA card.

I have an Ahead V5000 16-bit Video Card. Does anyone know if XFree supports
this card? And if so, what chipset should I specify in the Xconfig.

I should add that a sticker labelled "AVGA" appears on a chip on the card.
Please any help would be appreciated.  I thank you.

Cobra.

Subject: SCSI woes
Date: 10 Nov 1993 00:55:34 -0500

 I am attempting to install Linux on my 486-66 Unisys that has an Adaptec SCSI
controller built onto the motherboard. Unfortunately, the boot disk does not
recognize this controller. I would like to get hold of code, if possible, to
recompile the scsi drivers to recognize my controller. But it seems a bit of a
catch-22 that I must have Linux installed in order to do this. Perhaps I am
wrong, but I had not been able to find appropriate code. Also, I wouldn't have
the first clue about how to create a bootable disk.
 Secondly, I cannot reach "sunsite" to send e-mail! Wrong backbone, apparently
we're restricted.

Subject: General linux questions
Date: 10 Nov 1993 06:54:25 GMT

Hello.  I have a few questions, which are somewhat unrelated.  As
a precursor, I am completely new to Linux, and as such, know nothing
about it but what I have been able to gather over the last 5 hours
or so over the net.

First, for descriptive purposes, I have a 386/33, 8 megs RAM, a 240
meg hard disk, a Promise caching IDE disk controller with 4 megs RAM
on it, a Diamond Speedstar Pro video board, and a Cabletron 10baseT
ethernet board.  Standard other components -- a bootable 1.2M 5 1/4"
drive, a 1.4M 3 1/2" drive, Logitech mouse, etc.  I have a 17" high-
refresh Philips color display.

Now, first of all, will Linux run on this system?  I read somewhere
over the last 5 hours that Cabletron E21xx boards are not supported
or usable with Linux... if that's the case, then I have to stop here,
since that's what's provided by Columbia to me.  (I can always buy
myself a real board, though...)

Second of all, will I be able to run X-windows (from what I can
understand, Xfree386) at 1024x768, in color?  Unfortunately, I don't
know what kind of accelerator is on the SSPro, but maybe someone out
there does, or has it running with Linux.

Third, what would be the "best" flavor of Linux to run?  From what I
can understand, SLS is the most comprehensive... should I start off
with it, and tailor it to my needs?  I've administered a Sun workstation
before, so the tailoring part shouldn't be that difficult, but I am
just wondering if SLS is the best place to start.

Lastly, where should I try to get a hold of the Linux distribution of
choice?  I have FTP access directly from my PC, so I can bring stuff
in at relatively high rates of speed; the question is if it would be
better worth my time/money to just buy a distribution.

Thanks A LOT in advance for any help.

It's possible to do real Unix for the 286, rather than a clone Unix.  It's
not clear why anyone would want to do this (I've used System V Release 3
on a 286, and it is not a pretty sight...).

Subject: Re: Linux performance??
Date: 10 Nov 1993 08:55:59 GMT

Being a user of both (Linux and Win3.1) I would either way argue that
Linux is faster, due to the fact of true 386/486 performance. However
SOME applications MIGHT run faster under DOS/Win3.1, especially those
who are very CPU intensive (and thereby hogs 100% cpu under
DOS/Win3.1), but in normal use I find using Linux faster. Also there
now exists accelerated video drivers for both Win3.1 and Linux/X, and
I'm happily running Linux/X with opaque drags and things - real cool
(I'm using XFree2.0 with ATI GUP LocalBus). Normally it is not only
the absolute speed that counts, you should also consider what you can
be doing while your computer is doing something else. In the
DOS/Win3.1 I normally have no choice, if I do some CPU intensive work,
I just have to sit and watch, drink coffee, read the paper etc. With
Linux/X I can actually start some CPU intensive job, and start working
on my next task, like finally writing that e-mail reply..

However I still boot DOS/Win3.1 whenever I need to do WordProcessing
and Spreadsheet calculation, because I have found no suitable
applications for these things under Linux/X (I'm not into
"programming" documents, like under Emacs/TeX). I've also heard about
other commercial software running under X in general, but there is no
guarante that these have or will be ported to run under Linux/X. Also
I believe that the software prices for "professional/commercial"
software running under Unix/X is more expensive than their DOS/Win3.1
equivalents. 

One last thing to consider is what you actually get. With Linux/X and
the GNU packages that comes with it, you get a _lot_ of software for
free (including a lot of compilers, utilities, editors, window
environment). And if your going to hook your computer to a network
running TCP, you might also consider Linux/X since it usually offers
what most workstations currently offer in the user environment (which
with a few exeptions means X).

I've grown up with DOS/Win3.1 and in the beginning I found the switch
to Linux/X very hard, mostly because I had no experience what so ever
in the field. Also I've done quite a bit programming under DOS/Win3.1.
Now I've finally taken the big step and started using Linux/X for
real, and I must admit I like it better and better. However for
writing reports and creating big spreadsheets, I keep booting
DOS/Win3.1. Hopefully this will not last forever.. Just my $.02 .

if you want to risk you'r card there might be another posibility:
write the clocks you get on satrtup directly to the Xconfig. then edit the 
line 110 to somethin else and change the 135 to 110. i don't know if this
is true for the s3 server, but you can fool the mach8 servre this way.

Well, complain to the author(s) of these files - you should find the 
email-address in the header. We had similar problems when compiling
99pl12 which I duly reported to the author. The standard path to those
two files should be 
        /usr/src/linux/kernel/blk_dev/*.c
Regarding your messages
something has been changed compared to our problems.
It looks like different configurations (with/without Soundsupport)
are not handled properly. 

Tell your prob to the author since feedback is very important to detect
hidden flaws in released kernel. Since I don't have the pl13 sources 
I can't advice you how to circumvent this prob.

The shadow rsh is buggy, as evidenced when you look in /usr/etc, and find
"in.rshd" and "in.rshd.unsecure". The latter is the original shadow(?) rshd,
and has MAJOR security holes, like:

rshd 127.0.0.1 -l root "any command you like"

works for ALL users. This horribly buggy version is still used in SLS.
Anyway, I did some hacking to the source to make it more secure, but now
it only works for users with no password. Kind of like boarding up a
broken window, but it was about all I could do for it.

The source as I left it is somewhere under /pub/linux on ftp.cdrom.com. If
anyone has any luck fixing it, please let me know. It's quite short, but I
just don't have the network programming know-how to make it work.

So what do you guys think, should I just ditch the whole shadow thing like
MCC does?
