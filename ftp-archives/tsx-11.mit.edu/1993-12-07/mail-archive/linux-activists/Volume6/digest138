Hi, everyone,
    I finally resolve the following networking problem with PL12:
        SIOCADDRT: Network is unreachable.
by hard coding the network address into 'route.c' and recompile it.
The following is what I did.
   1. get the source code net-010.tar.z.  This file can be found in
tsx-11.mit.edu or sunsite.unc.edu
   2. after unarchive the package, edit the file 'route.c' and assign
a long integer X to np->n_net before the line:
        in->s_addr = htonl(np->n_net);
Assume the network address is aa.bb.cc.0, then X = aa*256^3+bb*256^2+cc*256.
   3. recompile 'route'
        make route
   4. subsitute 'route' in /etc with this new one, and that is it. Of
course, one may save the old 'route' before replace it with the new one
since this problem will be corrected by a new version of libc (4.4.2 ?).
    Thank those people help me to resolve this problem.

        Hello all quick question.  I have compiled several programs under
the version of MCC I am using (Linux 0.99PL10).  I can not however, get
any type of communications program to compile properly.  Minicom simply
locks up after loading( I have checked the config over and over.)  Pcomm
gives me a couple of errors and drops back when I try to run it. So does
ecu.  Maybe it is just me, or do I have something set up wron in linux
itself.  btw. I did run mincom when I was running HLU.  I can run
ckermit5( am right now) which came compiled with MCC.

the source line can be printed out right after the call to md_assemble() in

Subject: Re: Unix close for 486 - commens requested
Date: Wed, 18 Aug 1993 18:03:26 GMT

It's possible to have too much machine.  I'm sitting on a 
Gateway 2000 4DX2-66V that was purchased to run LynxOS.  Its got
a fancy VESA local bus, fast hard drive, zippy video card, and
runs Windows 3.1 like greased lightning.  It can't even load Lynx
though, because...well, nobody really knows.  If I cripple the 
machine by diabling cache, turbo, IDE block mode, etc., it will
sometimes boot Lynx, but usually not.  

It's interesting (to me anyway...) that in the newly formed LynxOS 
mailing list where this issue has been discussed a bit
no one has reported problems with plain vanilla ISA bus machines.
Further, the June '93 issue of Byte magazine reported on "fast 486 machines" 
and their ability to run SCO UNIX -- several of them had problems similar to 
mine, and in at least one case the solution was to cripple the machine 
as I've had to do.  In my case, a generic '486 would have been better than
my whiz-bang clone-of-the-month special, at least for running something
other than MS-DOS/Windows.

But if you don't have SLS?

I did it by finding timesrc.tar.Z ? somewhere on nic.funet.fi, finding
no docs, and dredging up what I had to do from my memory of an older
SLS installation.

Basically -- once you have the stuff in /usr/lib/zoneinfo or
/usr/lib/timezone(?) then

cd /usr/lib/zoneinfo
ln your.time.zone localtime             (e.g. ln US/Eastern localtime)
ln your.time.zone posixrules            (e.g. ln US/Eastern posixrules)

run date & clock to set your CMOS clock and you're done.

Note: the above may be wrong... I don't have the docs anymore, and I
don't know if they're anywhere but but the SLS installation.

This (and the other) performance is incredibly low for SCSI I think.
On ext2fs with simple IDE I get:

  Writing the 16 Megabyte file, 'iozone.tmp'...
  45.050000 seconds
  Reading the file...31.670000 seconds

  IOZONE performance measurements:
          372413 bytes/second for writing the file
          529751 bytes/second for reading the file


which is the same as the SCSI results. When I still used xiafs the
numbers were even a bit higher (400/550 for r/w).

I would expect almost 1MB/s with SCSI.

Date: Tue, 17 Aug 1993 06:02:30 GMT

Many programs that get into overflow on most machines show 'NaN' in
their output, as should be. But on Linux (0.99pl10) such programs
terminate with an SIGFPE, alas.

Can that be prevented, or is there a reason this behaviour is such?

Has something changed in this respect?

Use SETSERIAL Version 2.x. Linux can't install the serial ports at the boot-up.

Date: Wed, 18 Aug 1993 18:47:23 GMT




I would appreciate any help and appologinze if this topic had been covered 
before, but I've been trying to compile Radiance for a couple of days now..

I've been trying to compile Greg Ward's Radiance program using Linux 99pl11
and GCC 2.4.3 and can't get working binaries.

After reading all of the docs and tech notes, I'm pretty sure my problems
are related to the Gnu compiler and linker.

I've tried compiling the program with the -DBSD option set and I changed the
Rmakefiles to include -I/usr/include/bsd and linked with -lbsd.  

Many files gave linking errors such as: _frexp not defined in text segment.
I gather that there frexp, malloc and bcopy were redefined.  How do I
compile Radiance without going through and renaming all of the redefined
library functions?

Also, the file tty.c (in src/rt) has many SIG* statements that gave
compilation errors (undefined statement error?).  


Thanks in advance for the help.

    As awful as this may sound, I'd like to install Linux on a Model 60 that 
we have lying around at work.  I have two questions ...

    First, can Linux run on an MCA machine ?  The boot disk couldn't find 
the ethernet card, but instead identified three different sound cards...none 
of which are installed.

    Second, Linux's FDISK couldn't find any of the partitions on the 
machine, though I had set up three <excluding DOS>.  I figured this may be 
due to the fact that the drives are ESDI. Would this be the case ?

I^m looking for people who got mbox up and running on their Linux boxes.

I managed to compile, but there are a few minor flaws I^d like to rid myself
of:

Mail (internal and uucp) seems to be screwed up. The calls to sendmail for
aliasese etc. do work, but messages end up in nirwana.. or in my mailbox ,
with funny numbering... in fact all have the number -10737.. and are
therefore quite inaccessible :)

News works, but I cannot read certain newsgroups, though the hierarchy was
explicitly put into mbox.h (NEWS_MININUM)...

How have you handled new user logon??

[Sorry, fellow Linux-ers, but this refers mainly (2:3) to the implementation
under Linux... ln -s /dev/flame/in.coming /dev/null , pls]

        This does the trick, ignores aliases (i.e. always returns the

This is well and good.  But how does one join the GCC channel?  It
