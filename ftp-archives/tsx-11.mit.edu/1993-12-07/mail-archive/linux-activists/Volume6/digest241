I am receiving File table overflow errors on my system since I installed
a bernoulli 150.  It accesses the drive fine but when I try to open
applications I get a file table full and the program dies.  Has anyone
ever seen this error?  I couldn't find it in the five million pages of
FAQ's spread all over my basement.

Thanks,
Tom Bilan

Subject: SCSI AHA 1542C & booting?
Date: 18 Sep 1993 20:53:06 GMT

Hi!

I have played around for a day installing SLS1.0.3 on a 486dx50 with
4 megs, adaptec 1542C and a SEAGATE1096N (80 meg) hd.
I tried every possible combination of dos/nondos prim/ext partitions,
but the system won't boot in most cases. The bootup seems to hang
in the middle of SCSI detection, and I dont have a clue why or a different
HDadaptor to find out. Sometimes on a reboot after a floppy boot it workes
but not after power-on. Any hints about that?

thanx

Subject: NET2HOWTO-CONFUSE-YOU
Date: Sat, 18 Sep 1993 14:45:57 GMT

Hello,
        I have been using Linux for a while now. Have 3 machines running
99.9 and just decided to upgrade to 99.12 to take advantage of the NET2.
        So I backed up and did a NEW install (NOT a patch) of 99.12
        All went GREAT! All installation was smooth (except for the creation
of a mucked-up fstab).
        Got the net back up and running in less than a few hours, everything
is fine until I went to the NET2-HOWTO.
        NOTHING seems to jive??? There is no /etc/rc.d/rc.inet.1 or 2
nor is there any of the config files referred to in the FAQ.
        Also on this new system there are links like:         /etc -> ./
and all sorts of links to /conf/net which does not exist at all!
        As I said all is well but I am really confused as to the conflicting
info. Is there a "FRESH-INSTALL-FOR-NET2-FAQ" or something somewhere??
        Any help or hints as to what is going on would be greatly appreciated.
                                                        Thanx,

Alsn, first of all your return address bounced when I responded to you
privately, so I am responding on the newsgroup.

Thanks for your info, however when I include the CLOCAL line in my gettydefs,
even the patched kernel gives me the respawning too fast error.  What I did is
create a new entry called direct:

direct# B9600 CLOCAL ISTRIP CS8 ...

and in my inittab I have it do a getty direct /dev/cua0

Is this the proper way to do it?  I cannot find any MAN pages on it.

Also, where can I get all new man pages?  I need to completely delete and
re-install my man and cat pages cause some stuff is in a totally different

it be sunsite.unc.edu?

Instructions on how to do this exist already. I can't remember the 
directory, but it's somewhere amongst the Linux-doc-project on
sunsite.unc.edu if memory serves me correctly, and is called something 
like 'ibm-power'.

If you really can't find it, I have a copy somewhere and I'll mail it

Hi, 

I've learned the hard way that the SGI machine at work takes only 150 mb
tapes.  I first purchased a 250 mb tape, but too many read-write errors,
so I went back to the store and purchased two 150 mb tapes.

How can I write a script so that tar backs up my laptop's entire 200 mb hard
drive onto the two tapes.  

thanks for your suggestions,

Has the VT switching code for Xfree1.3 been perfected yet?
It mentions in the README that it has some problems with 
non 80x25 VTs.

When I was using Xfree1.2 I could switch to my VTs with no
problems.  But now using 1.3 I get a garbled display when I quit
or switch to a VT.

If not fixed, does anybody know a program which will correct
an incorrect video mode?

Subject: Linux filesystem over multiple hard disks?
Date: Sat, 18 Sep 93 20:41:25 GMT

This may be a FAQ, but I haven't read the most recent FAQ yet.

Can someone tell me if Linux will create one logical filesystem over
multiple physical hard disks?  In other words, if I have 2 40 MB hard
disks can I configure Linux to mount one 80 MB filesystem that would
span the two hard disks?

Type to ya later...
Dave
