Well, it seems that there is something curious around there, I also get
this return value. The code for me, has nothing to do whith "/dev/tty" and
I use the ordinary getty, which does an open(the_dialin_device,...

Everything works ok whith dialin, and dialout programs. Except whith uucico
from Taylor-uucp 1.4, (kernel 0.99pl12. and alpha)
I don't remember when this problem appeared, probably whith this locking
devices, because before pl12alpha/pl12, the getty was killed immediately after
the uucico call, (because sys_errlist[512] core-dumps...) and init was
immediately respawning it proprely.  I remember a thread about this I think...

I have no time to trace that, I just looked quickly to MY problem :-)
And this is what happens:

        The getty does "open("/dev/ttyS1", ...  .At this time the open()
        call blocks until carrier detect, this is the correct behaviour
        of course.
        
        Now, uucico use the corresponding dialout device, and calls any
        hosts proprely. OK, No problem. Uucico exits.

        Getty is always on the blocked open(). Correct.

        Now, somebody calls, the modem answers and carrier is raised.
        Normally the open should be now effective... It is Not !
        open() returns -1, and errno is set to 512 or 513, I don't remember
        the exact value. (I think it is 513, interrupt problem).

        Getty tries to syslog the error:
                error("/dev/%s: cannot open as standard input: %m", tty);

        Unfortunatly, sys_errlist[ 512 ]  fatally core dumps, and the getty
        exits, and the user connected is immediately disconnected.
        
        The next dialin, after the respawn of a fresh getty by init, is
        correctly processed.

This problems occurs ONLY whith UUCICO dialing out, whith other programs like
MINICOM or personnal stuff the dialin/dialout works OK for me, and has been
working ok for a long time...

So, there is a problem either in uucico, either in the serial drivers, perhaps
in the two pieces of code... And only whith them together. The LINUX serial
devices work proprely whith other dialout programs, and this uucico code works
ok under 386BSD and Sparc stations...

But errno set to 512 or 513, this is true, I have seen it and I can reproduce
it here when I want for now... Curious...

Subject: UDP traffic > port 1000
Date: Thu, 26 Aug 93 06:25:41 GMT

I've recently installed Slackware 1.01 (all of it) and compiled
xarchie-2.0.8. After I modified /usr/include/sys/param.h to include
/usr/include/linux/limits.h, the compile went off without a hitch.

The resulting executable works fine for one query only, provided
it results in a short answer. For the second query, or after receiving
about 20 lines, Xarchie gets a timeout and never recovers.

I then compiled udp.c and discovered that UDP traffic > port 1000 is
blocked on my system. Would this be the problem? If so, what do I
do about it?

H means host, N means network. You don't get N because your
route command gives your host instead of your network address
(and furthermore, you need an entry for it in /etc/networks.)

>FYI, I comment out rc.net and do:
>/etc/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1

>/etc/ifconfig eth0 128.143.10.112 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 128.143.10.0

broadcast should be 128.143.10.255 (unless you're running
Linux on a very old Sun :-) However, the main problem is...

>/etc/route add 128.143.10.112

You've just tried to add a route to your host instead of
a route to your network. Linus' explanatory posting says:

>The route commands should be written as

In other words, you need to replace the above with
/etc/route add 128.143.10.0
and make sure (as he says elsewhere in the posting) that
/etc/networks has an entry for your network, e.g.
network    128.143.10.0

*Then* add the gateway...

>/etc/route add default gw 128.143.10.254

With a little help from the net I was able to print the labels
and they look GREAT! Thank you Chris.

The solution was to write a small program and replace all CR with LF
and then I could edit the file and put %% in front of the line
with the keyword "lettertray". Then it printed OK.

Hear, hear... The pre-previous poster is saying that those who cannot 
pass the course in literary criticism  should not be allowed to "wield power"
over technology. I would rather argue that those who *do not understand*
technology should *not* wield power over it, and my belief is that there are 
more of the later than those of the first.

I understood from your reply that you cannot communicate ideas about computer 
in English without using technical jargon, and so it would be hard for you to 
"write a book" in layman English... I don't think it is so difficult. After 
all you did write most of your response in tech-less English. And it was about
computers, and it was not too difficult, was it? I think that most books for
non-initiated in the Computer Wisardry lack a certain progressive teaching 
of the terminology.. Once that terminology is taught, one can get very 
precise in their books, and be fairly certain that the reader would 
understand... but maybe Computer Science is too young to have a stable 
terminology, and besides who would want to read an OS manual for the first
to last page? It is a complex matter, and there are many things that should
be done. Like, why not teach some of the jargon to kids, so when they grow up
it would become an integrated in their language (if it is not already) and
understood that a hard disk is not a floppy in a hard case. 

If things continue progressing as thy are, which they most likely will, the 
gap between those who understand computers and those who do not will become 
wider. And even in the new generation that gap will remain, even though 
people will not be as scared to use them (due to more powerful and easier 
to use Operating Sytems), because there will be relatively few people in the
society who will be taught to understand them. Personally I look at Linux 
as an excercise, a very good one, that will teach me (and many other people)
how to run, make and operate a good system. I will probably teach a lot of us
how to make OS user friendly, be it through good manuals, or other important
ways. Because I think of Linux as being an excercise on a large scale
I think its accessablity to "outsiders" will be limited for a while ( I am 
not excluding a possibility that Linux will not go beyond that). Advances 
in technology always lag in real life applicatons.

16M is the maximum single swap file or partition size. You can have
multiple such files or partitions, however.

My four year old already operates Linux/Xwindows/twm tolerably.
He certainly is not ready to install and troubleshoot it, but
give him time.  He can log in, type "startx", create and delete
windows, exit, and logout.  His favorite programs are roach, paint,
and gas.  Here therefore knows about pull-down menus, can read
"OK" and "Cancel", can operate slide-bars (he taught my wife to
use the center button for these), and probably some other things
I am not aware of.  The nice thing about Linux, as opposed to
MS-DOG, Windoze, or Macintrash, is that I _don't_have_to_worry_about
him_trashing_anything!  The worst he can do is fill up the disk,
or delete his .twmrc by accident (I keep a spare copy in my
directory).  My two year old did trash my CMOS once by cycling
the power and banging on the keyboard too fast.  I am thinking
about hardware solutions to the power problems, and I am glad I
wrote down the CMOS settings when I first installed the computer!
