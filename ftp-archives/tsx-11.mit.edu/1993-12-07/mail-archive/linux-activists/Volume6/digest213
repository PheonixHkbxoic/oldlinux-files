You might want to try the shutdown from utile14.taz.  I had the same problem.
I had SLS1.01 with pl11.  Bootutils works as stated with the shutdown 
mentioned above, e2fsck 0.3, and the stuff in the bootutils package.

BTW, I don't remember where utile14.taz is.  It IS in one of the archives,
tsx-11.mit.edu, or sunsite.unc.edu.  I'll look it up if you can't find it.

        It is the round trip time for the packet to make it to and back from 
the indicated host. It is helpful in showing how the delays add up over a

        For a real fun try, try traceroute to nic.ddn.mil. You'll see just how

Hi,

I've been trying to track down FAQs and I think that I have them
within the sights. But they're in FINLAND. I rather not burden
the net. I know sunsite has them, but from my host  I can't FTP
or TELNET... just mail.

So is there a US site for FAQs etc. which accepts email logins?

If you know of one, for the sake of the bandwidth, please let me
know. Additional details (like relevant subdirectories, key
files, etc.) also greatly appreciated.

Wouldn't this, however, be an argument *for* getting a 486?  I am just
wondering, as I have heard that UNIX on a 486 should conceivably run
better because the 486's hardware, especially if it has a local bus,
accesses peripherals, especially the hard drive, much more
efficiently, so that users are not as affected by others using the
drive...

Subject: NFS & Linux
Date: 9 Sep 93 01:22:00 GMT

I'm interested in anyone's observations on NFS with Linux.  I have Linux
on a 486DX2-50 and a Sun IPX on the same network, a DOS machine running
PC-NFS 4.0 is used to access both.  Running Norton's SI 6.0, I get
pretty decent read & write performance from Linux, 178kb read & 100kb
write speeds.  Accessing the Sun I get 300kb read and 14kb write!  What
is going on with the Sun?  Why such good read performance and such lousy
write performance?  Is there any optimization that I can do to get Linux
a bit closer to the read performance of the Sun?  I'm not interested in
getting Linux's write performance to match the sun, BTW. :-)

Date: 9 Sep 1993 03:22:04 GMT

Hi!
I just sucessfully installed linux in my pc. Thinks seem to be working
well. However, when I tried to compile a program using gcc, the compiler
starts swaping to disk and takes forever (10min+; actaully I abort the
compilation because it was taking too long). The source code for the
program takes about 60kbytes of disk space, and my computer have 4Mbytes
of memory. I compiled the same source using djgpp under dos without
problems.

Is this situation normal, or do you think something is wrong in the
setup? Can I do something to improve the situation? Any help will be 
greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
manuel

Its not a Unix shell, its a "BBS-Shell".. (which is what I'm working
on, user logins exec a perl script instead of a shell... by the way,
work was slowed down since I upgraded to SLS 1.03, and a 1M TVGA8900CL
card... :))

This is a problem, I haven't figured out an easy way for the BBS to
create new accounts on the fly. I guess it may have to do something
like check for a specific login name or something. That's something to
look into, in the future.

No matter how fast the drive and controller, RAM will always be

One can get the evaluation copy of NeXTStep/486 for $300.  This is the
user's AND developer's versions.  Quite a bargain IMHO.  (Tho not as
big a bargain as Linux :-)  The catch is that this eval version cannot
ever be upgraded, but still for a $300 price tag, maybe it's worth a
look.  NeXT's phone # is 1-800-879-6398.  I do not work for them nor am
I in any way associated with them.  Heck, I don't even own the software
yet.  Just thought others would like to know.

[SIG removed]

        We've just gotten Xircoms at our dorm (like 2 days ago) at
UIUC.  Unfortunatly, even after the ifconfig shows it all right the
routering configuration just won't work.  plip0 (or 1 on most other
machines) just doesn't want to connect to our router.  For example,
on one of the machines we have isr0041 (domain urh.uiuc.edu), the boot will
ifconfig plip0 128.174.30.50 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 128.174.30.255
but for the life of me, we can't get the IP packets to work right.
The gateway is 128.174.30.1 and the net is 128.174.30.0... 

Is it just that Xircom adaptors are too lame to work?  We've had
routing problems with pl12 with other cards too..
Any help would be appreciated.
