Except that if you use amd, or any type of links to nfs mounts, that won't
tell you where you *really* are.

Something like this will work, tho:

        #include <sys/param.h>

        main () {
                char cwd[MAXPATHLEN];

                printf ("%s\n", getwd(cwd));
        }

To whom it may concern (ie the slackware guys):

I recently attempted to install slackware (1.02) via nfs using the
setup script.  There seems to be a problem, in the script the
following variables are set (the names may not be exact, I don't have
the script infront of me...):

Refer to the NFS section of the stup script...

SOURCE_MOUNTED= -source_mounted   #non-null
REMOTE_PATH=/disks/fatt1/slackware #received from user
REMOTE_IPADDR= XXX.XX.XXX.XXX      #ip no. of the NFS server
DISTRIBUTION_SOURCE- /INSTALL/mount$REMOTE_PATH
SERIES= -sets AEFX

ok, with these set, the script mounts the dir with slackware source on
/INSTALL/mount:

mount -t ext2 $REMOTE_IPADDR:$REMOTE_PATH /INSTALL/mount

Now pkgtool is sent with the folloing flag:

-source_dir $DISTRIBUTION_SOURCE

Expanding DISTRIBUTION_SOURCE gives the following:
/INSTALL/mount/disks/fatt1/slackware


ERROR!!

should be:

-source_dir /INSTALL/mount


Sorry for the "wordiness" of this, I am very tired.

 Hi, I am a novice on Linux stuff.  I have succeeded installing Linux except
X-window.  I have very hard time on doing this.  I would greatly appreciate
if someone give me an advice on installing X. (I read FAQ but it was not
really helpful for my job)  My system configuartion is
as follows.

    VLB 486DX2-66 with  ET-4000/w32 Video card (Hercules Dynamite)
    140M space HD space for Linux.

My question is,

  1. I have diskettes for SLS x1-x10. Someone said use XFree86.  
     What is the difference in between?

  2. I've downloaded XFree86 on my workstaion however, it was too big to
     store in 1.44M floppy diskettes.  I've no idea how I can bring those
     files to my PC. 

Thank you again.

Try out bootutils-0.1 (to be found on every good ftp server) and follow the
instructions. The umount included there will cleanly unmount all the mounted

Subject: DG62x5 chip set? FAX? DAT audio?
Date: Tue, 7 Sep 1993 23:21:59 GMT


I got my first Linux machine 2 years ago; it had 386SX-16, 2M (well,
1.6M), 42M disk and was a serious pain to get working under Linux.
Consequently, I got my new one fully loaded.  It is:

Sager 8200, 486DX2-66, 16M, 340M disk, 10" active color

I also got the docking station for it:

2 VESA slots, 2 ISA slots, SCSI 1 controller

Here are my questions:

1.      Linux and X run really well, but not in color.  The VGA chip
        set is not recognized by X.  It is a DG62x5.  Does anybody out
        there have a Linux X driver for this chip set?

2.      I have ordered a PCMCIA 14.4K FAX/modem.  Is there any Linux
        software that understands sending/receiving FAXes?  What I
        would want to send is mostly stuff done with groff.

3.      I want to get some additional goodies for the docking station:

        a) A good CD ROM drive
        b) A good audio I/O board
        c) A good backup tape drive

        What does Linux understand?  I have an audio DAT recorder; can
        any of the audio boards talk in 16-bit 48K (or 44.1K) digital
        audio data streams?  Also, if I got a DAT drive for backup,
        could that also write audio DATs?  Is there any Linux software
        for any of this stuff...?

Thanks.

Subject:   problems after installing SLS from TSX-11.MIT.EDU

Hi.  I have previously installed Linux at home and decided to install the
newest version that is at TSX-11.  I erased my old disks a2 throught X10.
FTP in:  

1) I looked for RAWWRITE before erasing A1.3  It is not where I remembered it
   I thought it was in the SLS directory.


After grabbing everything and xcopy to the disk:

2) I split my hda into part 1 dos, part 2 swap (19635blocks) mkswap reports
   20Meg swap bult.  But when I swapon /dev/hda2 it reported only 16 meg 
   swap added.
 
3) Started to install.   Error message on disk A4 was
  "gzip123...TAR could not link usr/bin/zcmp to usr/bin/zdiff file exist."
   
3) After install went well I logged on as root and typed menu.  I get most 
   of the menu but the part that is the bottom right bar with quit to exit 
   is garbage.  I have downloaded everything again and reinstalled, even 
   wiped the partition first.  Still get all of the same messages.

4) When I startx it tells me that "fixed font can not be found" and the 
   server dies.  

I have a 386DX-40 with only 4 Meg ram, two IDE drives. One Quantum 114 Meg
and a segate 170 Meg drive.  I know X is not supposto run like this but the 
memory is to be on order soon.  The rest is critical for me to use this box
as a demo for my class work and my boss is intersted in UNIX to.

I hope to get this going soon.

That's not the case with SLS1.02 and uucp didn't change in SLS 1.03.
I'd suggest you turn uugetty off in inittab until you get outgoing calling
working, then add uugetty back.  If it breaks then, you have a uugetty
problem.

Used to be that you needed -x4 for it to work but I think that's fixed
now.  I'm not certain what the minimum is with Taylor1.04 or if there

it isn't.  Unless it's your real UUCP neighbor, it shouldn't be in there

Subject: Shutdown doesnt unmount
From: levinson@vax.sonoma.edu
Date: 7 Sep 93 20:26:59 -0800

Okay.  I got BOOTUTILS and installed the new mount, umount, rdev and fsck.  I
noticed that if I did a shutdown now, and when the system goes to single user,
I type umount -a, then reboot all is well (VFS doesnt say it is mounting
unchecked filesystem and e2fsck skips its check)

However, any other shutdown command does not unmount root.  Is there a newer
shutdown command?  I tried creating the file /etc/brc and placed

umount -a

in it, but still no luck.  It looks like shutdown does not run umount.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

There is a PC virtual machine for running MS-DOS and applications
("dosemu"), but using DMA and interrupts is Right Out.  While it's
possible to translate an IRQ into a user-level signal, that won't be
fast enough for the kind of application you are talking about.  And
there are major difficulties dealing with general DMA in the
user-level address space of 'dosemu'.

You can write a Linux device driver, and then hack that into the PC
virtual machine, but once you start you'll probably end up rewriting
your entire application in Linux.

>(3) If the DOS emulator currently won't handle these situations, is there
>    work underway to address this, or am I hoping for too much from Linux?

It's too much to expect to be able to run an arbitrary MS-DOS device
driver under Linux, or any real OS.  You have to deal with virtual to
physical page mappings, physically contiguous pages, DMA boundaries
and limits (64K, 128K, 16M), wiring down pages, and a slew of other
issues just to make DMA work.  Some device drivers also depend upon
software timing loops, being able to turn off interrupts, and
accurate, unimpeded access to the system timer chip.  None of these
are compatible with the scheduling fairness and protection expected of
a general purpose operating system.

The SLS NFS installation is very easy to use, you just answer the questions
and go get a cup of your favorite beverage.  If you answered the
questions correctly, you'll have a Linux machine when you come back.

I have a shell script that patches up locale-specific things like the
timezone file and machine name.  This script keeps getting smaller, so
Peter must be doing something right.

You must find a site that permits anonymous NFS mounts -- anonymous
FTP isn't enough.  There are a number of them around, but they don't
advertise it. 

On a related note, there has been some discussion lately about having
the boot system on multiple disks.  This is a bad idea -- it was a big
win when Peter managed to get the SLS boot system on a single disk.
It's far easier to hand someone a single floppy and a few IP
addresses, and say "here is everything you need" than to loan them a
few boxes and ask them to waste an hour swapping disks.
