   Or, if you don't want to have to bother rebooting twice:
1. go into emacs.
2. M-x lisp-interaction-mode
3. (make-symbolic-link "/usr/lib/libc.so.4.3.3" "/usr/lib/libc.so.4")
4. Hit CTRL-J
5. Voila - fixed

At least, thats how I fixed it when I did the same thing.

To some extent, "ease of use" is a valid gripe.  As someone else pointed out,
Linux has gotten to the point where non-computer types want to use it *because*
it is as capable as it is.  These people, unfortunately, don't know Unix or
their hardware the way they might need to in order to do the installation.
Furthermore, they might not be able to learn Unix (lack of resources) until
they've got Linux up and running.  Chicken and egg problem.

I'm not at all saying that this is an easy problem.  Hardware configurations
are so variable in the PC-clone world that coping with a particular
configuration is essentially a shot in the dark.

So I understand the frustration of people who have problems installing
Linux on their system.  But help is on the way.  I plan on getting into
installing Linux for a fee, providing tutorial services, etc., to anyone
in the area that's willing to pay me for it.

Having ported a number of things to System Vr4, I can tell you flat out that
porting to Linux is *easier* than porting to "the Real Thing".

I've even played with BSDI some, and found porting things to it to be
comparable to porting things to Linux.

Some people seem to be having problems even with that.  I've never played with

Obviously if you run enough CPU-intensive things, your system will bog.  But
you should try doing all those things under System Vr4.  You might be lucky
if your system doesn't crash on you under those conditions.

Yup.  Some things will just bring any Unix box down, e.g.

I agree.  But how many secretaries are going to be compiling things?  Most

Such applications, if written properly, should be easier to use (and faster,
and more efficient, etc.) under Linux than under DOS or Windoze, if only
because Linux is a *real* operating system, not some kludge put together
by MicroSloth.

Let's nip this one in the bud. GNU's FREE software is not about money. It's
not about ownership. It's about access. The basic jist of the GNU copyright
(left. whatever) is that if you sell or give away a piece of code under the
copyright that the person you sell/give away the code to has the same level
of access to the code you do. So if I'm a contract programmer and I build
a system based on Linux (whose kernel incidentally is copyrighted by Linus) 
and I sell a system to a client, my responsibility is to give the client
the same level of access to the GNU software that I have, namely source
code.

The objective is not to prevent the sale of software but to prevent the
closed "It's mine and you can't see/have it" attitude that most software
companies have.

BTW the GNU copyleft only gurantees access. The developer is not obligated
to send the source code with the system, only to provide access to it if
requested and to make sure that the client understands that they have access 
to the source.

Also if you write your own piece of code from scratch without using anyone
elses code then it's yours and you can do that you want with it. BTW is
there a lib yet for linux that's GNU "safe" yet? Meaning you can like to it
and not provide source code?

And finally a question. What exactly would a client do with software they
"own" as opposed to GNU software? They can use it. They can sell it. The
only thing they can't do is prohibit anyone they give/sell it to the same
level of access the "owners" have.

And lastly ;-) The reason I don't think the GNU copyleft makes a whole
bunch of difference is that the clients generally don't have the technical
ability to do anything with the source code if they had it. They why they
hire us in the first place.

In the end it really doesn't matter. What matters is to have good reliable
code that does the job and good technical support so that clients can get
things done. That's what people will pay for.

Actually it's really simple. Make your favorite file system on the floppy.
Fill in the directory structure witth the required utilities and put a
kernel on the disk. Install lilo on the disk (/etc/lilo). Set up the
lilo config file to boot from /dev/fd0 and mount it as root. Run lilo
and voila! bootable floppy.

I'd love a good explanation of using a ramdisk as root though.

First: When you are upgrading the libraries use "ln -sf" to make
the new link. If you anyhow manages to get the libraries AFU
sash is a good help. It might be a good idea to install sash
today, you never know what happens tomorrow :-)

sash is found on: sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Shells/sash.tar.z

From the man page:

SASH(1)                                                   SASH(1)


NAME
       sash - stand-alone shell with built-in commands

SYNOPSYS
       sash

DESCRIPTION
       The  sash  program  is a stand-alone shell which is useful
       for recovering from certain types of system failures.   In
       particular, it was created in order to cope with the prob-
       lem of missing shared libraries.  You can also use sash to
       safely upgrade to new versions of the shared libraries.

       Sash  can  execute  external  programs,  as  in any shell.
       There are no restrictions on these commands, as the  stan-
       dard  shell is used to execute them if there are any meta-
       characters in the command.

       More importantly, however, is that many  of  the  standard
       system commands are built-in to sash.  These built-in com-
       mands are:

            -chgrp, -chmod, -chown, -cmp, -cp, -dd, -echo,
            -ed, -grep, -kill, -ln, -ls, -mkdir, -mknod,
            -more, -mount, -mv, -printenv, -pwd, -rm, -rmdir,
            -sync, -tar, -touch, -umount

I am trying to do some C programming under Linux.  I am having trouble with
a particular routine I am pretty sure it's in the ncurses library.  What am
I trying to do is the following.

Print some text, then have the user input *1* character of information.
getchar() only works if you hit carriage return. I want the user to just hit
one key on the keyboard and then have that keystroke returned to the calling
part of the program. Sort of like an inkey function in BASIC.

My C is a little rusty, so please email me with any info to help solve this
problem.  I am also then interested to see what command syntax I need to use
to cc (what -l options do I need to use?)

Thanks,

The rdev command comes to the rescue! It allows you to change the root
device, select a swap, set the video mode, and build a ramdisk. I gather
it operates on the kernel itself.

To expand on your example on the kernel you copied to the floppy:

- Mount the floppy (say on /mnt)
- run the command: rdev -r /mnt/Image 1440
  This creates a ramdisk that the root is loaded into. Use 1200 for a 1.2
  Meg floppy.

Now when the floppy is booted it'll create a ramdisk and load the entire
floppy into it. Access is FAST! but be aware that any changed will only
be reflected on the ram disk. If you want to change something on the
floppy you have to mount it and change the files on the mounted disk.

Now on to the next topic - separate boot/root floppies - I needed to
do this for the Slackware distribution because I only had a 1.2 Meg boot
floppy disk: (thanks to hartnegg@sun3.ruf.uni-freiburg.de (Klaus Hartnegg)
for the info)

1) Build the boot floppy by copying the kernel to the formatted floppy using 
   the dd command: dd if=/Image of=/dev/fd0

2) Now set up another floppy with a file system. Fill it with the necessary 
   utilities but WITHOUT A KERNEL! LILO is also not needed. This is the root 
   floppy.

3) Back to the boot floppy. Run the following commands with it in the drive:

   rdev /dev/fd0 /dev/fd0
   rdev -r /dev/fd0 1200
   rdev -v /dev/fd0 -3

   These command set the root floppy to fd0, creates a ramdisk for the
   root floppy, and sets the video mode to ask for a mode respectivly.
   
4) OK the setup is done. To boot with your new system put the boot floppy
   in the drive and reboot. The floppy will load the kernel and ask for
   the video mode. When it does this swap the root floppy in. Now the
   ramdisk will be created and the root floppy copied to it.

I think that SLS/Slackware should be distributed like this. I know it kinda
a pain to have to rawrite 2 floppies instead of one. But it'll give the
installation disks enough space to include useful items like an editor
and the netstat and ping commands (for Slackware at least).

Now I have a couple of questions:

1) I was able to create my root/boot pair from hacking up the A1 disk
   int the slackware distribution. But I needed a 1.44 3.5" floppy to
   do it. Is there any way with normal tools that I can access the a1disk
   file as a filesystem? I know the loopback driver can do it but it
   requires a kernel patch to a pl11 kernel or higher which can't be
   easily done when you don't already have a kernel that high.

2) How do you use a boot/root pair with a video system that has only
   one video mode?

Yes. When you run doinstall just specify whatevery partition you want
as root (and usr if it's a separate partition) on the command line.
Type the command by itself to see the possible options.

Also you'll need to set up LILO yourself unless you're using the OS/2
Bootmanager.
