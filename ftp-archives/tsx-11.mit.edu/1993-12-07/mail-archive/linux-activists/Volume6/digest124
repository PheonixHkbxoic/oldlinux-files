Here's a concrete suggestion for a word processor. In brief:
* Uses Tk/Tcl
* Object oriented. Separate parts (tables, multi-column, whatever
you fancy) can be written completely separately by anyone and dropped
into a central kernel.
* Allows export as TeX, PostScript, raw ascii or whatever else
each object can cope with.
* I volunteer to think about the central kernel and the associated
`easy' bits: fonts, justification, headings and so on.

Here are the details: fairly simple but fairly powerful, I think,
and allowing the `distributed programmers' approach which is the
hallmark of a lot of Linux hacking.

Tk/Tcl: I came across them a few weeks ago and am extremely
impressed. Easy to get started with; rapid prototyping
(everything can be a script and the performance is fine even
with scripts bound to mouse motion events); can recode anything
in C (possibly C++ too) if wanted.

Have a central kernel which is basically a geometry managing
widget and deals with a few global menus. It copes with vboxes
and hboxes just as TeX does and manages widget children (perhaps
with glue in between). It can start off as a hacked version of Tk's
packer or canvas. Each `part' of the document is an autonomous
instance of a widget. Once the cursor is in a particular widget it
`does its thing.' Standard text and text justification can be handled
by Tk's text widget, appropriately configured. These text widgets
already allow tagging of arbitrary ranges of characters with tag names
and then configuring per tag name with font, relief, colour and so on.

The interface between such a widget and the (word processor) kernel
requires things like the following:

Widget to kernel: How big am I? How big can I get? The user is
searching for ..... and I haven't got it. Please pass on the
search to the next widget up/down/left/right. The user is trying
to move the cursor out of me. Please pass on the focus/cursor to
the appropriate widget. Please add an entry ... to a global menu
and call me back when it's used.

Kernel to widget: Resize to such-and-such size. What formats
of data can you export? Export your data as ascii/PostScript/TeX...
User requested ... from a global menu that you registered.

It's this interface that needs specifying and extending. Once
that's in place, anyone can come along with a Tcl script file
and say: "Put this file in directory /usr/local/lib/tkwp" and
the next time you fire up your word processor you'll have
such-and-such new facility.

As I've said, I'll do some thinking about this and see what
sort of facilities this kernel needs and how closely it ought
to follow TeX's ideas of vboxes and hboxes (glue and all?)
Since I am fairly good with TeX and know how excellent its
text layout algorithms are, I definitely want the ability to
export any reasonable document straight through TeX.
A separate `object' (or configured text widget) to allow raw
TeX commands to be included in the document is trivial to add.

Comments welcome.

Subject: networking with pl12
Date: Sun, 15 Aug 1993 22:45:14 GMT

I am having problems networking with patch level 12.  My setup worked
with pl11 and libc 4.4.1, now I can't get it to work with pl12 and libc
4.4.1 or 4.4.2.  The ethernet route commands come back with `network
is unreachable.'  If I tell Linux to use netmask 255.255.0.0 (which is
wrong for my network), then I can get things to work for a while, then
they break after a few minutes (e.g., telnet sessions get rudely
disconnected).  Here is my routing rc:
---begin Dan's rc---
#! /bin/sh
#
# rc.inet1      This shell script boots up the base INET system.
#
# Version:      @(#)/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1  1.01    05/27/93
#
# Author:       Fred N. van Kempen, <waltje@uwalt.nl.mugnet.org>
#

MYNAME=`/bin/hostname`
NETMASK="255.255.255.0"
 IPADDR="129.115.10.31"
NETWORK="129.115.10.0"
# utsa2
GATEWAY="129.115.3.253"

# Attach the loopback device.

/etc/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1 netmask 255.0.0.0
/etc/route add 127.0.0.0
/etc/route add 127.0.0.1

# Set up the Ethernet connection(s).
/etc/ifconfig eth0 ${IPADDR} netmask ${NETMASK}
/etc/route add ${NETWORK}
/etc/route add ${IPADDR}
/etc/route add default gw ${GATEWAY} metric 1

# All done.
---end Dan's rc---

I know pl12 is supposed to be more `strict' about routine, but I don't
know what that is supposed to mean.  It looks to me like I am doing things
right, but I must not be since things aren't working.  Any suggestions?
I'd like to move permanently to pl12, but I need the networking stuff.
Thanks!

Subject: [Q] Can't do networking with SLS 1.03
Date: 16 Aug 1993 11:18:04 GMT

I still have problems getting my network going with the latest SLS 1.03 release
(disk a1.3 dated Aug 12). In doinstall I select option 5 for NFS-install and I
specify my IP-number, network number, etc. My NFS-host is on the same subnet.
It looks as if the network configuration is OK (no errors or warnings), but 
the NFS-mount doesn't work:

! mount clntudp_create: RPC: Port mapper failure - RPC: Unable to send

My ifconfig and route look like:

! lo        IP ADDR 131.155.110.55  BCAST 131.155.255.255  NETMASK 255.255.255.0

! network                   *                         UH         0     43 eth0
! softland                  *                         UH         0      0 lo

I don't think the latter is correct !!!

After that I installed Linux from my hard disk, but I still couldn't get the 
network going. ifconfig and route give similar output as above and NFS-mounts 
give the same error.
I can ping to localhost, but I can't ping to any other host. From the other 
side, if I try to ping to my PC from e.g. an RS/6000 I don't get a reply, but 
now a host with IP-address 0.0.192.31 shows up in the arp-table of the RS ????

I also tried the hints of Darcy Boese in comp.os.linux/53085:

  /etc/ifconfig eth0 ${IPADDR} netmask ${NETMASK} broadcast ${BROADCAST}
  /etc/route add default gw ${GATEWAY} metric 1
  /etc/route add ${IPADDR}
  /etc/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
  /etc/route add 127.0.0.1

but now the first two route commands complain about "network unreachable".

I give up. Any hints ???????

Hi Folks !

I us EXT-2-FS on my Linux-Box and i'm happy with it.
But yesterday, i connected my Box via Ethernet (WD8003) and the pl9-Kernel
to another box (NE200, pl9), and ...
after working about 1 hour with nfs etc. and then checking my filesystem
there were lots of errors (bit-set etc.).

Is this a known bug ?

The semantics of a cast are actually quite simple.  The result of a cast
is the same as if the cast had been an assignment to an unnamed temporary
variable with the type given by the cast.

Thus:

        char ch;
        unsigned char uch;
        int i;
        unsigned int ui;

        i = (int)ch;            /* equivalent to: i = ch; i = i; */
        i = (unsigned int)ch;   /* equiv.: ui = ch; i = ui; */
        i = (unsigned char)ch;  /* equiv.: uch = ch; i = uch; */

There is one additional touch.  A cast typically means: `I, the
programmer, know that there is something slightly fishy about this
assignment.  I put the cast in to force a specific conversion sequence,
so please do not warn about it.'  This makes casts `more legal' than
assignments in many cases, and makes them the only permitted (if
implementation-defined) way of converting between integers and
pointers, or different kinds of pointers.

In article <EICHIN.93Aug9160931@tweedledumber.cyGNUs.com>
eichin@tweedledumber.cyGNUs.com (Mark Eichin) writes:

This description conflicts slightly with itself.  `Masking EAX' makes
the upper 24 bits *not* garbage, if the upper 24 bits are masked away,
but not if only the low order bit is masked away.  I am not
particularly conversant with Intel 80x86 assembly, but no sample
compiler output appeared anyway.  I suspect that the compilers in
question make `char's signed, so this means:

  - Fetch 8 bits from rkpt->dat[1].
  - Sign-extend the result to a full `int' (16 or 32 bits, depending
    on the compiler and/or model).
  - Convert that to `unsigned int' (no change in representation,
    but values that used to be negative are now considered to be
    large positive numbers).
  - Take away the low order bit.

[output from sample program by Keith Smith, truncated radically by me,
 to show the value that results from a `char' that has been set initially
 to 0, 1, 126, 127, 128, and 255:]
>0 / 0
>1 / 0
>126 / 126
>127 / 126
>128 / 4294967168
>255 / 4294967294

These results are exactly as expected on a two's complement 32-bit
machine with signed `char'.  128 becomes -128, which is then interpeted
in unsigned arithmetic as 2^32-128 or 4294967168.  255 becomes -1, or
2^32-1, or 4294967295; masked with &~1, it becomes 4294967294.

The intention was almost certainly to do:

        switch (*(unsigned char *)(rpkt->dat+1) & ~1)

or, equivalently:

        switch ((unsigned char)rpkt->dat[1] & ~1)

An egregiously stupid compiler may generate slightly better code for
the first version.  Personally, I think the best solution might well be
to change the type of the `dat' field of *rpkt to `unsigned char', so
that the expression can be written as:

        switch (rpkt->dat[1] & ~1)

but there may be other considerations that would make this inadvisable.

Here's an entry I made to the Obfuscated C Contest that got turned down.
It's a complete "units" program.  I'll not include the unittab (since I haven't
written a useful one), but it'll work with the standard Unix /usr/lib/unittab.

I'm sure Linuxers can throw together a non-copyrighted unittab.

I hereby put this program in the public domain, freely copyable.

Perhaps I should take this thread a little more serious.

It should be in alt.dcom.telecom or comp.dcom.telecom, but on the
chance that those who have posted do not have access to the
appropriate groups I'm not going to redirect follow ups.  I would
suggest that anyone who has more questions or wishes to debate the
subject should post to one of those groups and get this out of the
linux group.  (Email is fine too...)

We have lost the attributes here, which may be just as well.  I'm
marking which statements I made:

That may be an "OBVIOUS" way to connect the scope, but then what do
you do?  Do you have any idea at all what you should see?  Or what
you shouldn't see?  How are you going to know if what you see is
good, bad, or indifferent?

I have an extreme amount of experience in the use of scopes for
circuit analysis and trouble shooting, and in analysis and testing
of telephone lines.  I can't interpret what you would see on a
scope in any useful manner for testing telephone lines.  And
neither can you.

The scope gives an instantaneous view of voltage vs.  time, but
that doesn't relate to the specifications for a telephone line.

Neither noise nor signal levels can be measured with a scope.  Put
four equal level non-harmonically related tones on a telephone
line and measure that with a properly balanced and terminated
scope.  Then remove two of the tones.  What difference are you
going to measure on the scope?  The power level just changed 3 db,
but the scope isn't going to tell you that.  (It will...  but if
you are sharp enough to know how, I'll give you a problem where it
will do exactly the same thing, and the level on the line *won't*
change 3 dB on a proper test setup.)

If you try measuring noise with a scope there is a little matter
of spectral distribution (C message weighting) and peak to average
ratios (a minimum of 12 dB, which is for gausian distribution).
If your scope doesn't have facilities to handle that, it can't
be used for accurate measurements.

Telephone line parameters are not specified in terms that can be
measured correctly with a scope.  It might be very interesting
to look at, but there is no way to relate what you see to the
specifications for a telephone line.

Hi all,

is there a working multiusercard (8) RS-422 and a driver under Linux??

Thanks

And getting support could still be a problem.    By being available as
sources there can exist many variants, if it were not compiled
completely stock.   And it does seem to go through more variants than
any commericial release.    When having a problem with any supported
product, if you are behind on release revs the typical reply is
something like "so many things were fixed since xxx.xx you need to
upgrade to see if this problem still exists.  If you still have the
problem after upgrading, please call back".

How can you be sure the end user is using the, as you put it ' generic
Intel binary ' ?
