Since we upgraded to the 0.99pl11 kernel and the net-2 software,
gophering goes very slow on our machine. The 0.99pl12 kernel does not
help. Before - with 0.99pl9 it was very fast.

In detail: We have installed the gopher1.12 with the patches from
sunsite.unc.edu. A gopherd is running on our machine. In the gopher-directory
there are 7 files in total. The prOur gopherd uses port 70. Now calling the
goph client freezes the screen with Retrieving Directory... at the right
bottom. Only after 3 minutes the gopher directory appears. Selecting
directory entries or descending to subdirectories has about the same delay.

Has anybody the same problem? Does gopherd work fine with the net-2
software? What is the fix?

The gopher users at our institute are vanishing ... PLEASE HELP!

Date: Mon, 23 Aug 1993 12:19:47 GMT

Sorry if this is a FAQ, I've checked out all the FAQs I could
find and there weren't any references to this, but there
are so many FAQs :-)

I have a hayes compatible modem on /dev/cua1. Dialing out
with "cu" or "uucico" work fine. But dialing in doesn't
work. I have a uugetty process on the line specified in
/etc/inittab and this shows up in the process list. If
I start a call-out program then when I exit that then 
the uugetty dies and another is spawned as is supposed to
happen. In /etc/default/uugetty.cua1 i have 

WAIT=RING
CONNECT="" \rATA\r CONNECT\s\A

RING is generated which I verified with kermit. But
for some reason uugetty fails to see it. The modem 
is configured *NOT* to auto-answer which I guess is
right since uugetty is supposed to see the phone
ringing and pick it up itself with the ATA. (I did,
in frustration try configuring for auto-answer, but
this just resulted in getting a connection but an
unresponsive connection.) Can anybody help me or
point me to a FAQ list that I overlooked. 

Thanks a lot.

I didn't believe you could even have the two cards in the same machine.
The s3 provides full hercules compatability - and by doing so uses the same
io addresses as the hercules. You are getting a lot of IO address clash,
I'm not aware of anyway to tell the S3 to disable the hercules io ports.

You need XBoard 3.0. It compiles (and works fine) on Linux.
There you do a -DFLEX and the Makefile will use Flex without any Problems.

Xboard 3.0 is beta and the author asked me, not to copy it myself to others,

I tend to agree with your list in part. I still *feel* that with what

If something in the current code is suboptimal no amount of redesign work

I've recently started running Linux on a 486DX2/66 VLB motherboard with 
an Ultrastor 34F controller. So far it has been completely satisfactory.

NB: If you plan to use an SCSI tape drive, be sure to use the
ultrastor driver that comes with the pl12 kernel. Older versions have
a bug effectively prevents anyone from reading from a tape drive.

        I hope this helps.

Date: Mon, 23 Aug 1993 13:23:29 GMT

I have installed SLS1.02, and un X as installed (color). With both
twm and olvwm I have a problem with garbage that is left on the
screen and with strange scrolling behaviour within xterms. The garbage
consists of vertical lines, the strange scrolling behaviour is shivering
text.

Since this happens with both wm's I guess the server is to blame. Am I
right about that? Is there something I should do to make it go away,
e.g. installing a newer version of SLS or X-server?

Some data:
Compaq Prolinea 4/33 w. 8MB
Eizo VA41 (ET4000) VGA card
Eizo F550i monitor

By the way, does anyone have a good mode db for the above combination?
I need entries for as big a display that is possible with 512k, and

The problem isn't anything in Hardware, the configuration works fine under
DOS. This is to be expected, since it's a feature long used by many AUTOCAD
drivers to show the text in/output on the hercules monitor and the drawing 
on the VGA monitor. If i remember correctly, i had even a linux configuration
with two Xservers running, when i used my vga card, but i removed the 
hercules card, because it halved the Performance of the VGA (that's an ISA
problem, which doesn't occur on local bus boards). What i want to say is, that
it is probably an XS3 problem??

This rather cryptic message is telling you that your disk image
isn't of the correct format.  However, it looks like you're trying
to install a floppy disk image "diskimage" as a hard disk image,
because dosemu doesn't try to autosense geometry on a disk image.
Are you sure you're configuring it properly?  Please re-read the

This is getting to be a FAQ.

If you're using a Trident chipset under the standard 0.49 release,
you need to add this line to your config file:

ports { 0x42 }

This has been fixed in my current version of dosemu, but there
isn't really enough new material to justify a new release.
Furthermore, it's not yet stable.

Hi there... I'm a bit of a newbie to Linux and want to install a new Ethernet
card (an AT1500T) and use TCP/IP.  I managed to edit rc.net (to change 'eth0'
to 'le0' for the driver), but it's still not sensing it - seemingly because
the ethernet address is wrong.  I know there's a configuration program, but I
forget the name (the one that runs when you use the boot disk during
installation).  What is the name of this program, and, if I successfully
change the address, should that be enough to have Linux recognize and use
TCP/IP successfully on that device?

fsync() wasn't in the kernel until fairly recently... if it's there now.  I
don't know if it is or not, though patches have ben floating around for
several months.  (eventually sunsite will quit dropping the connection on me
and I'll finish ftp'ing a current system...)

Another critical assumption is that the cache is flushed all at once.  If it
does it a block at a time to free up space for the next buffered write, (e.g.
one physical write per buffered write), performance will suffer because of
buffer management overhead as well as because of the physical write time.

I haven't looked to see what Linux is doing, but since I'm (as I said above)
on an outdated kernel (0.99pl9; the buffer code got rewritten in 0.99pl10 and
later) it wouldn't prove much anyway until I finish upgrading.

I'll try to answer this question by way of laying my own confusion bare,
then perhaps (hopefully) others will answer with vehement objections or
agreement, and we'll become even more confused (errr, I mean enlightened :)

SLS by Peter MacDonald is the 'de facto' Linux Distribution. Others include
Ygggdrsl(my spelling may be  slightly wrong), MCC (minimal size and content)
and perhaps another or two.

Slackware is based on SLS and attempts to repair many of the problems in
that release. Things like duplicate binaries, out of date (often criticaly)
programs (like gzip, fer'instance) and otherwise tries to be quicker on
supporting new kernel releases, drivers, etc... Basicaly a leading edge 
SLS based distribution.

Alas, this brings problems as well as benefits. Since it's based on SLS,
it in some manner trails it as well as leads it. When Peter releases a 
new SLS release that has significant updates (like 1.03) this would seem
to prompt a quick reponse with a new slackware release. I don't think this
happens though, so todays Slackware release may be yesterdays leading,
cleaned up distribution... But you can hold your breath waiting for a 
Slackware release.

Slackware seems, due to it's strong ties to it's SLS base to be lacking a
character and reputation of it's own. This, primarily, is why I don't use 
it. I recognize the problems with SLS, and wish that the Slackware person
(people?) would join efforts instead of creating Yet Another Distribution.

Lately Peter McDonald (now I've spelt his name both ways, so I'm only half
wrong) has taken issue with the Slackware use of his SLS installation 
scripts (this and the work to ensure a proper port of the various programs
contained within constitute the SLS 'product' The whole leviathan GNU GPL
religious war has found great fuel for flames here...

Then there is another character who has announced the immiment availability
of YAD (Yet Another Dist...) but who plans to start from scratch and meet 
at least the high standards set by SLS and and purportedly advanced by
Slackware. This I gotta see, meanwhile SLS is my watering hole for which
I am most grateful.

Everything can use improvement.

I sent the following message. If we get any more posts like this I suggest
we ALL send polite messages like the one below.

P.S. My apologies for wasting even more bandwidth but after the 5th such 
     message I got annoyed.

P.P.S I just realized it's a guest account. Maybe a message to postmaster or
      root might be more appropriate.

Excuse me,

Would you please either post meaningful information or get the f*ck (as you
put it) off the newsgroup. You're just wasting bandwidth.

Thanks,

Craig,
        how did you managed to get OAK 037 256k to response to a clock
of 32.5 ? I've been threshing with mine Linux came out and the only
luck I have is to start up in 132x25 text mode before switching to a
clock of 56 (I can't believe it myself. Sometimes, it even go to 72 !)
to run 800x600 mono.  Can you give me a tip on this 32.5 stuff ?  I
prefer the 80x25 mode when I'm working in text...

Happy hacking !
