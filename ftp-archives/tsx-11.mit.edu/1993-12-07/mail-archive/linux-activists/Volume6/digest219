        Hello folks!  I have dosemu 0.49 working on my machine.
I've gotten it boot up from my diskimage from my floppy
drive.  It has also got a hdimage which is now the C:
drive.  But I want to be able to directly access my hard
drive which is on the partion /dev/hda1.  I was looking at
the helpsheet that trys to explain how to make a hdimage and
so forth but it didn't really give me any clue about how to access
the hard drive.  Maybe I'm just not seeing it.  I've been working
on this for quite some time now.
        So if there is a very kind person in this newsgroup that
can help me out or give me any clues as to how to approach this,
I would appreciate the help a lot.  Thanks in advanced.

Date: Fri, 10 Sep 93 19:41:20 GMT

I am in the midst of installing Linux on my 486 system and 
I run into the following problem:

After installing disk a2 of SLS v1.03 without any problems,
it dies on a3 and a4 with the following messages:

(a3) base       stdin: invalid compressed data--format violated

For specifics, I have a 486dx33 w/a 234 MB IDE HDD and 4 MB RAM.
I am installing off of 3.5" floppies.  The hard drive is configured

blocks.

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.

I don't know of any free ones.  Quarterdeck was claiming this time last year
that DESQview/X-286 would be out Real Soon Now, but I don't know if it ever
actually came out.  Other than that, all your options require MS-Windows...

        Roy,

        I just did what your about to do :).  I put the slackware
        release on the second ide drive.  Apart from not being
        able to create greater than 70MB Linux partitions, everything
        went OK.  I use OS/2, so I use the Boot Manager from that
        to boot up Linux and it is working OK.  I can't speak for
        LILO.

        So far the Linux looks quite impressive.  I hope to have
        some more time today to play with it and get things setup.

I have ported hunt along with many other bsd games.  Andy Teffta has ported
several bsd games himself.  We put everything together in a bsd-games package.

It can be found on sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/games/bsd-games... and
tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/[sources,binaries]/usr.games/bsd-games...

The current port of hunt still is not perfect, but if you have problems
with it, let me know.  Maybe we can figure it out.  (I have the email address
of one of the co-authors.)

I read in one of the Linux intro read.me files that Diamond video cards
are not supported by X windows for linux.  This is because Diamond
Systems will not release the information?  has anyone pursued this
information?  I have just ordered the Diamond Viper w/2mb VLB, and was
hoping it would be compatable with linux.  Will I be able to run
X-Windows in a non-SVGA mode sucessfully? Or will the card not work at
all under X-windows?  Anyone happen to write a driver?
Please respond soon, because if I am going to change the card, I should
do it in the next day.

Thanks!

Ultrastor 34F SCSI, SCSI-2, local bus controller.

Less than 4months old. latest bio chipset 200080.006 (not the
earlier buggy version, which has problems with MS-DOS)

Worked perfectly with DOS, Linux (but it is supposed to work with OS/2,
SCO and other commercial UNIX systems).

In original packaging, with all software drivers (one floppy disk) and
documents included. (just one brochure)

Paid $279 +s/h from DC Drives.

Price reduced to $180, and I'll pay shipping.

Hi,
        I just installed SLACKWARE 1.0.3 on a Comtrade EISA/VLB 486/66 with 2
ide drives,
Mitsumi CD-ROM drive and Sound blaster 16 card.

        I did a full install of everything and the boot floppy was created. But
when I boot
from this floppy I get:

                Loading.....................................
                Uncompressing Linux
                CRC Error
                System Halted


        I have rebooted from the distribution "bootdisk" and successfully
mounted the
partitions created on the ide drives during the installation process.
Everything on the
ide drive partitions seems ok.

        I also tried to run lilo to enable booting from the hard disk instead of
the floppy
but I get:

                can't open device: /tmp/dev.0

        There is a block device created dev.0.
        
        What, if anything, can I do to fix this problem.
        
        Thanks very much for any assistance.

Is there a C++ translator for linux like CC which translate C++ source
code to C source code? CC uses cpp, cfront, and cc for preprocessing,
syntax and type checking, and codegeneration respectively.

I don't see any utilities like this for linux. The reason i need CC is
for debugging code with UPS which has just been ported to linux. I've gotton
very used to UPS and would like to keep on using it. I've debugged
C++ code generated with CC with UPS and its harder than straightforward C
code but its still better than xxgdb IMHO. UPS cannot debug C++ code
generated by linux C++ compilers. It crashes every time one wants to
access a class. If CC for linux does not exist then are there any other
debuggers other than xxgdb, xgdb for debugging using X11?

Thanks

The problem is that some NE2000 clones have an always-active dataport
that traps probing drivers, and the new CDROM drivers aren't careful
about where they probe.  There should be a work-around in pl13.
