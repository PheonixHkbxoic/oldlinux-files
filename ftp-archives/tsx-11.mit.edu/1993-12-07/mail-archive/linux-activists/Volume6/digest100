This may be a moronic question, but I'm askin' anyway.

I have the NET-2 package, which says it is for kernels 99pl10 or above, and
SLS 1.03 is 99pl11.  In the SLS RELEASE notes it says "net-2 support".

Does this mean that I do not need to install NET-2 because it is already 
in there, or does it mean that it will support NET-2 without any additional
patches?

I am asking because I tried to install NET-2 last night on top of SLS 1.03 
and I noticed that most of the links set up by NET-2 in /etc pointed to non-
existant places. So I blew away the installation and decided to wait until
I hear from the net first.

thanks

I found out if I use the old libc.so.4.3.3 it works, but if I use
libc.so.4.4.1 it gives me the IOT trap/Abort error.  Then I got the 
new version of mount, to see if it was an incompatibility problem
but it hasn't been updated since my version.  any idea what is cousing
the problem?

Date: 10 Aug 93 13:56:13 GMT

A while ago I asked people who were interested in paying to join
a Linux Users Group or consortium to send messages to say so.
OK, well after a week or so, I've gotten about 20 responses.
Not a very impressive response level.  I suspect that those outside 
of the USENET community might be more willing to pay, but one of the
main benefits was to make hardware vendors believe that Linux was worth
some of their time.  Apparently, it's not. :-)

If anyone's interested in a more complete summary, I can put one 
together & mail it to you, but it's hardly worth anyone's time.

In the event that you're interested in such a group but didn't 
notice the message, send mail to this account linux@relax.des.edu
& say that you're interested & how much you'd be willing to pay yearly:
1,2,20,50 / year ($US).

Subject: ttys0/ttys2 IRQ conflict (?)
Date: Thu, 12 Aug 1993 17:10:28 GMT

I've encountered a problem in Linux I though it was beyond... the 'good old'
shared IRQ conflict for serial lines. When I set up two getty's for ttys0
and ttys2, neither of them works... Or very very slow, with response times 
going to 25 seconds... or characters are eaten.
The problem is consistent for both kernel 0.99 pl 9 and pl 11. I though 
Linux was capable of handling this IRQ conflict a lot better than MS-DOS.
BTW, all chips are recognized as 16450's, and the kernel has no serial
options enabled. 
So.... does anyone know how to solve this ? How I can install 4 serial lines
and get them all working ? maybe some patches are needed... (there was 
hardly any difference between the serial.c from pl 9 and pl 11 anyway).

Many thanks in advance (got a demo this monday...)

Subject: EVE customization of EMACS...
Date: 12 Aug 1993 17:54:08 GMT

Hi everybody,
I have a question on customizing emacs. We have VAXes in the office
and I use EVE for editing, with the EDT keypad option (there
are three customization options in EVE; vt100, edt, wps).
Anyway, I'm so addicted to it, that I can't get started with emacs
at home. When I asked for emacs in the office, or
in the department for that matter, I got the
EMACS=eight meg and constant swap. Now, keep the flamethrower
off, I think that this may have been once upon a time,
and, being a bona-fide person, I do believe that there is merit
in learning emacs, although the facilities I need from my
editor (learn, find, cut/paste, and the like) are all superbly
implemented in EVE. Is then there any way I can readily customize
emacs to look exactly (or almost) like EVE with the EDT keypad?
I hope from that point on I will be able to slowly learn
its details (it is not intuitive you know; see discussion on
wordprocessors). When I tried to customize it myself (there is
an edt customization file in the linux distribution of emacs,
but it is outdated; goes back to 87 or something)
it wasn't quite the same, and I had enough of meta- and ctrl-
to make me want no more. By the way, is this true, that for
virtually any command I give I need to push two keys simultaneously?
Almost never happens in EVE. When I need PF1, I don't have to
hold it down, just punch it. 

My ultimate goal is to learn emacs and be able to use its power,
which currently I only suspect. This article should probably have
been directed to the emacs newsgroup, however I do not follow
that one. If there is a way to do close emulation of EVE, then
please let me know how; otherwise I will need to work on it
when I have more time myself.

                              Thanks,

                              Ioannis


PS:Please, flames and long threads only if necessary :-)
   It's just that I'm new to emacs.

Subject: x8514 servers and ps/2 mouse
Date: Thu, 12 Aug 1993 17:37:53 GMT


Hello,

We are running SLS 0.99PL10 with NET-2. The box has an ATI Ultra Vantage and
a PS/2-style mouse. 

We have been trying unsuccessfully to get an X implementation working on this
system. The problem seems to be the PS/2 mouse support - specifically, the
PS/2 mouse is supported with Xfree86 (although the video card isn't), but not
with either X8514 or X8514scale servers (where the video card IS supported.)
We can start the Xfree86 server and get munged video, but a working mouse.

Using 'strings' on the different server binaries verified this - the string
'ps/2' only appears in the Xfree86 server.

We have tried calling this mouse anything that's supported - Microsoft, Mouse
Systems, etc. and have called it quite a few other things 8-) but cannot
get it to work with either of the X8514 servers. 

It works fine under DOS and Windows 3.1, using a Logitech driver. 

Does anyone have any ideas on adding ps/2 support to x8514 or x8514scale?


Thanks
Jon

Have a look in an archive near you.  There was a units program posted
on July 22nd to comp.sources.misc (Volume 38, Issue 61, units/part01).

I can't have had much problem compiling for Linux, since I can't remember

Subject: 486 Doesn't boot LINUX SLS v1.02
Date: Mon, 02 Aug 1993 23:31:00

Ok,
I mentioned my problem in an earlier message but everybody
asked me to elaborate the issue. So here goes:

SYSTEM:
    486 System board using: AMI BIOS dated 06/06/92
                            486DX Processor at 33MHz
                            16MB (4x4MB SIMMs 70ns)
                            ISA BUS
                            SYMPHONY chipset
    ET4065 (ET4000; 64k colors) Video card without IRQ2
    Multi I/O with: 2x serial (I/O and IRQ standard)
                    1x parallel (I/O and IRQ for LPT1)
                    Floppy drive with 3.5" and 5.25" drives
                    IDE controller
        ST1144A (type 47; Cyl: 1001; Heads: 15; Sector: 15)
    Soundblaster2 (I/O: 220; IRQ: 2)
    NE2000 (I/O:300; IRQ: 5)

SoftWare which failes:
    SLS v1.02 kit (v0.99 pl8)
    LINUXpro (v0.99 pl11) (Fred van Kempen's toy)
    MCC Interim release

Software which works:
    SLS v1.01 kit (v0.99 pl6)
    HLU bootdisk (v0.99 pl7)

I tried at first with all cards installed:  FAILED
    All I got was LILO telling it was booting. Then LINUX
    loading the RAMDISK. Then LINUX loading and
    uncompressing. Right after the message
        Booting LINUX
    my system freezes.

Ok so somebody sugested to play with RAM shadowing ROM
and so on. And so I did. Well I got just as far as
a line telling me: console: colour

The chips involved my systems are:
CPU:        A80486DX-33
            L2523562
            SX729
            INTEL (M)(C) 1989
1:          SYMPHONY
            SL82C461
            A29987.1
            1161 C_9246
2:          SYMPHONY
            SL82C362
            2222220 JAPAN
3:          SYMPHONY
            SL82C465
            4L02F2237
            JAPAN 9243EAI
keyboard:   NEC
            (c) 1988-1991
            DISA 4236  297
            9224M7028

Main Memory:    4 SIMMs of 4MB with 9 chips at 70ns
    (The manual says 80ns would be fast enough)
Cache Memory:   9 chips of 32kx8 at 20ns
    (for 33MHz 20ns would do according the manual)
And there is a jumper which tells me:
    ZERO WAIT STATE CACHE WRITE HIT
this could also be place as:
    ONE WAIT STATE CACHE WRITE HIT

Problems occur even without the NE2000,
without the SoundBlaster,
with another Video card,
with an original 8042AH.

The system has been stripped to the bone just to see what is actualy causing the problem. Any item I couldn't do without has been exchanged by stuff from my 386SX (yep, even the keyboard and controller) EXCEPT for the systemboard itself, the RAM and the CPU.

I have no way of exchanging any of these yet.

If any one has cured a simular problem please specify faulty equipment and what part it has been exchanged by to fix it. Please specify as much as possible.

I hope to start a Systems query on the NET next weeks. I will make a sort of an approved hardware list so any future decisions can be made according this information. And we might even be able to put pressure on manufactures.

Thanx for your time,
Hugo.

Hi,

Does anybody have patches to het Emacs 19.18 compiling. This version
fixes a lot of the bugs, but does not compile out of the BOX. I tried
the suggestions somebody posted yesterday, but they were not enough.
To be more precise:

        fixes mentioned on news:

                . include <limits.h> in buffer.c
                . define HAVE_FREXP in floatsfns.c
                . undef CTOR_LIST in emacs.c

        fixes i noticed:

                . undef HAVE_MKDIR in sysdep.c

        something i have not fixed:

                . a LLOOOTTTT of wornings when linking temacs.
                  it can't seem to find anything at all.

I am using Slackware 1.01 (pl12).

        I have spinup patches that I have been sitting on for quite some time.
I am waiting for someone to try them out and evaluate them before I send them
in to be included in the distribution kernel.  The patches are kind of old, but
will probably go in to a recent kernel without too much trouble.

Well, you are right, "porting" to Linux should not require lots of
rework in the code, or even a recompile.  On the other hand,
"supporting" Linux means that you need to test your releases on it,
make sure the documentation is updated and having the support staff
not say things like "Linux?  What the !$#@ is that?  Try running on a
different operating system".

This is still a major hurdle to overcome, but _if_ Linux gets is a
significant install base, then I think it will happen.  I don't see
anything fundamental about Linux that would stop it from happening.

They could also do 720K.  I developed a driver for the DEC Rainbow for
the 3.5" low density floppy so I could drag between home and work.

I was able to bring up the SLS 1.03 (p11) on my machine w/o an
ethernet card w/o any problems related to the network stuff.

Reminds me of a comic I once saw.  He said there should be a $5 charge
for being stupid.  Anybody could collect at any time.  So, if you see
someone being stupid, say "That'll be $5 for being stupid."  If they
pay it, charge them another $5.... :-)

Well, the patches that I have were originally for the pl5 kernel and I
had to hack them for the pl8 kernel.  I went directly from the pl11
kernel on SLS 1.03 to p12 after finding out that the tape drive was
effectively useless.

The p12 ALPHA kernel of Aug 8 seems to have the patches to get tape
drives working with UltraStor 34F's.  This alone is a good reason for
going to p12a.

I never did forward port the p8 patches to p11, and have no idea if
they would work or not for p11.

Date: 12 Aug 1993 15:32:20 -0400

I have a really old 386-16 with 2 megs of RAM.  Unfortunately, 384K is
shadowed, so all I can use is around 1.5MB.  This is not enough to get the
kernel to boot.

Is there any way I can force it to boot in that little RAM?

Problem is that it's very hard to get the programming documentation.

If you can get the documentation, I'd love to get a copy from you...

I have a ZyXEL modem, and I want to use it, and modgetty as an

darned slow compared to Linux.

Just use the shell escape at the kermit prompt and use i/o redirection

Okay, I'm running Linux on my PC at home, and I want to compile Angband
for it.  Now, looking at the moria ftp site (ftp.cis.ksu.edu) all I
found was the source for Angband 2.0.  Now, I've heard it mentioned
several times on r.g.m that there is a version 2.4 frog-???  Is this
something completely different.  Is it just a bunch of user patches?
What is it?  But more importantly, where can I get it?  Also, will this
version compile with Linux v0.99pl11?  Is there any special type of
patch file that I can get to make it compile under linux otherwise?

So many questions.  Hopefully someone out there can help me.  Thanks in
advance...

I don't know about cua2, but I have had a similar problem with all the
X versions I have tried.  I seem to be able to use /dev/cua0 fine but
/dev/cua1 always shows up as "in use" when X is running.  This even though
my Xconfig clearly states I'm using a busmouse, and the mouse works fine.
I have /dev/mouse linked to /dev/atixlmouse or whatever it's called.

You can check for this problem by running kermit in one VC, then trying
to start up X in another VC.  In my system X will fail to start, stating
it failed to initialize core devices.  It seems that X always holds
/dev/cua1 open, no matter what Xconfig says.

Does anybody know how to fix this problem?  I really would like to be
able to use both serial ports while in X.
