Subject: UPDATE: Can only run X as root
Date: Fri, 27 Aug 1993 15:15:01 GMT

I still cannot get X to run except when logged in as root.  People
have suggested I 'chmod 4755' the following:

XF86_SVGA
xload
xterm
xinitrc
Xconfig
SuperProbe
sample.twmrc

I have done this.  I still get the X-background and my mouse moves, but
no xterms, or menus. I have copies of xinitrc, Xconfig, and sample.twmrc
in my home directory as .xinitrc, .Xconfig, .twmrc with suid root, also.
Everything works fine when logged in as root. I also have /usr/bin/X11,
/usr/X386/bin, /usr/X386/lib/X11, and /usr/openwin in my PATH of
.xinitrc and .profile.

Here is where the result of startx 2>2.out differs for the two situations:

when logged in as myself:

VGA256: SpeedUp code selection modified because virtualX != 1024
PEXExtensionInit: Couldn't open default PEX font file  Roman_M  
(that is the end - I then hit cntl-alt-bsp to exit X)

when logged in as root:

VGA256: SpeedUp code selection modified because virtualX != 1024
PEXExtensionInit: Couldn't open default PEX font file  Roman_Msun3: command not found
xterm:  unable to open font "*-fixed-bold-*-*-*-15-*-*-*-*-70-*-*", trying "fixed"....
waiting for X server to shut down xterm:  fatal IO error 32 (Broken pipe) or KillClient on X server ":0.0"
xinit:  Unknown error (errno 0):  Client error.
ining.
      The connection was probably broken by a server shutdown or KillClient.



It appears the problem is with opening the xterm, but it exists in my
path  and has suid root!!!  Any hints?

I'm commenting on an old article, but then I've been away for some
time.  I'm not commenting on the general topic in this thread (i.e.,
to what extent, if any, Linux should be usable by various kinds of
newbies and novices).

Thanks for the compliments.  The answer to your question is that they
should either learn Postscript (this might not be the preferred
alternative), print it out or preview it, or get another copy in a
format that they can handle.  Unfortunately, I have only been able to
provide the source code (plain text, except with some embedded
commands for the layout program, LaTeX), DVI (a formatted, but device
independent format), and Postscript.  When I made the first public
release, I didn't have the tools to do other formats; I still don't,
but I will get them before I make a new release (don't ask me when,
'cause I have a habit of not meeting deadlines just to be nasty).

Unless something goes terribly wrong, then next release of the SAG
will also be provided in as a plain text file (formatted for 66 lines
per page, 80 columns, with form feeds between the pages), HP Laserjet
codes, and Epson codes.  I think this should cover most people's
output options.

IDE drives are also capable of using DMA, and also feature a "multiple mode"
for moving several sectors to/from the drive in a single operation.

The linux device driver currently does not seem to utilize either feature,
but with enough of us looking and poking about, it shouldn't be too long
before it does.  Then IDE drives will *really* fly, and with greatly reduced
kernel overhead, too.

Subject: How to cut/past w/ xterm & two button mouse?
Date: Fri, 27 Aug 1993 16:18:00 GMT

Hello,
        I am currently running the latests SLS version of Linux and X on
a 386 pc.  I have (more or less) got everything set up correctly and,
being a newbie, you all should be thankful that I have not bombarded
the net with newbie questions before now.

        One rather annoying feature of my setup, however, is that
I don't seem to be able to cut and paste between xterms with my
microsoft (2-button) mouse.  As I understand it, one can paste using
button 2, but I have no button two.  Also, I have no way of brining
up the vt10x menu since this operation requires ctrl-mb2.  How can
I change this to, say, utilize either both mouse buttons clicked at
once (I have tried this to no avail) or something else?  

I have looked in the xterm manpage as well as the FAQ's for linux and
X.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.  Please mail.

One more thing, have you checked that all the directories leading up to and 
including `/usr/X386' have permission 755?  If so, then, also check that the 
directory `/usr/X386/lib/X11/fonts' exists and it and the directories under 
it have th mode 755.  There should be at least one directory under
`/usr/X386/lib/X11/fonts' called `misc' with fonts in it, and possibly a few 
more, such as `75dpi', `Type1', and so on.  If all that is true, then check 
the `FontPath' statement in your `Xconfig' file to see that they point to 
existing directories.  From the error messages, it looks as if xterm cannot 
find any fonts at all.  The first message about the PEX font file is 
probably not important, I used to get it too.  Then I got the server link 
kit and relinked a server without the PEX option and the video drivers that 
I did not need.  This gives you a smaller executable too.

  By the way doing `chmod 4755' indiscriminately is probably not a good 
idea.  This is especially not recommended, and does not even work, with 
shell scripts.  It is true that if you are running Linux on a stand alone 
pc, there is much of a security risk.  But there is still the possibility 
that you might indvertently do some real damage when logged in as an 
ordinary user, just because the wrong program was setuid root.

Subject: Networking problem
Date: Fri, 27 Aug 1993 16:57:25 GMT

Hi...

I have a problem.  I installed SLS 1.02 (or whatever - the pl12 one.) and
networking just will NOT work for me.

I'm trying to get it to talk to an SVR4 (ESIX 4.0.4) box with a 3C503
card in it - I've tried both 3C503 and NE2000 in the Linux machine - it
recognises both cards just fine, but won't do anything with them.

pinging the localhost on each works fine.  pinging the network fails -
on SVR4 it just reports 'no answer from polgara' (polgara is the name of
the linux box).  garion (ESIX) is setup as 95.0.0.1 and polgara as
95.0.0.2.

ping on polgara comes up with 'Possible IRQ conflict on IRQ 9' - there is
not.  Detaching the network cable during a ping produces the 'Possible
network cable problem?' message, then it goes back to 'Possible IRQ conflict'.

(This is with the NE2000.)

HELP!  Please...

(BTW:  The ESIX end appears to be ok - it'll talk to the Novell 3.11
server ok.)

Maxima is a sort-of public version of Macsyma, originally developed at MIT.  It
is the oldest of the computer-algebra systems, so to call it a DERIVE-clone
is a bit off.

The version available to us seems to have at one time been a licensed product,
but the company who sold it apparanetly is out of business.  Thus, it is 
by default available.  People who market CAS programs get a bit touchy about
that, understandably.

It really is a powerful program, though.  It has some features even Mathematica
and Maple lack.  Try integrate(sqrt(a + x^2),x); .  It askes you for the sign
of a.  

This version is a bit out of date, when compared with commercial releases.  
There are a few bugs no longer present in the commercial product (one I know of
relating to the branching problem in integration).  But, it is really quite
powerful, and it IS the only such product available under linux.

It's also not as hard to use as the previous poster suggested.  There are  no
menus like Derive has, but the language is similar to Maple.  If you get
stuck, try 

describe(whatever_you_are_trying_to_do);

You'll get a bunch of choices.  That is, sadly, the only real help available.
