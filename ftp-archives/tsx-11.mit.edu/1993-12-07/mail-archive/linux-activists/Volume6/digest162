I'm trying to set up my Linux box to allow ftp and telnet logins. According
to the inet.conf file, inetd is trying to start tcpd. But I don't have an
tcpd! Can somebody tell me where to get it from?

Also for Alexis: the serial-FAQ is at sunsite.unc.edu in the
pub/Linux/docs/faqs subdirectory. It's a great FAQ, but the thing that
confuses me is that it says to disable all messages from the modem (E0
and Q1), but then the getty.xxx files say to use

INIT="" ATZ\r OK

If the messages are disabled, getty will never get the OK. Also, note that
some of the later modems have 2 possible configurations that ATZ can reset
to. You need to make the line ATZn....

I'm using one line as dial-in and dial-out. After much experimenting, I
decided to us uugetty (from the getty_ps pacakge) and set my modem up
to auto answer. So far I can dial in ok and I can dial out using Kermit. If
you need more specific file configurations, e-mail me.

Hope this helps and thanks to the guys for writing all of the documentation!

None of the OS's this is posted to actually *use* the BIOS except during

Just so, I think: floppies can get dirty, maybe slight mis-alignment.
Retrying is as good a way as any to deal with it.

The release notes for Microsoft Xenix/86 (about 1987!) points out that
some DMA chips can only handle one DMA channel at one time.  (Also that
some 8250 UART's don't have working interrupts.)

This is where the magic bit in the MiscOutReg comes into play, Jon.  All
SVGA cards that I know of provide full Herc backwards compatibility.  And
CGA, too.  If the MiscOutReg is set to color mode, then the mono ports
are disabled, and you can use a herc along with the SVGA.  Similarly, if
you set the MiscOutReg to mono mode, the SVGA can coexist with a CGA
card.  This is how the two-headed mono server works (the SVGA mono
mode is actually 16-color mode, with only one bit-plane turned on).

But the bottom line is that what he wants to do is impossible.  Or at
least a rediculous amount of work.  The problem is that IBM, in its
infinite wisdom, has the bit order backwards between the packed-pixel
and bit-plane modes.  An X server can't support two bit orders.  So the
only way to get things to work would be to swap all the bits around for
one screen on the other.  No, thanks.  Not today.

Date: Mon, 23 Aug 1993 22:31:31 GMT


I believe that /dev/tty is a pseudo device used to open any free
tty (is this correct?).

I have the same problem under Linux 99.PL10 on my laptop.  The process
works fine on my desktop unit though.

The actual problem occurs on the open call (per ptrace)   

open("/dev/tty", RDONLY, 666) = -512

-512 is the error code ERESTARTSYS.  I think that in this instance there is
a problem with the locking mechanism between /dev/cuax and /dev/ttySx.

Perhaps someone with more knowlege and a little free time might be able to
explain the problem or fix it.

In the meantime I suggest you replace the /dev/tty entry and use /dev/cua1 
instead of ttyS1 as your tty for getty.

Can this machine run Linux?  If so, how much does linux cost and where do
I get it?  Finally, does linux come with X11r5?

8MB memory, can expand to 128MB if necessary
3 EISA slots
3 ISA slots

What does DOS mean at all?  Is the main word "disk" or "operating system".
In the case, it was "disk", this is what DOS is: it is an system to operate

Date: Mon, 23 Aug 1993 23:49:28 GMT

Has anyone out there in the wonderful world of the internet
managed to configure a NetBlazer as a SLIP server for Linux?

So far, I can get dip to connect at 14400bps, then the NetBlazer
seems to send a stream of crap and then hangs up.  I have made
sure that my settings are 8n1 when dialing up, so I don't think
it is anything as simple as a parity problem.  Also, both ends
are using Telebit T3000 modems, so I don't think that is a 
modem compatibility problem. My guess is that the NetBlazer is
expecting another NetBlazer to dial up and is trying to send
and initialization string, but I don't know how to tell it
otherwise.

If you have had any experience with NetBlazers let me know,
I am *very* interested in getting this working soon.

I had the same problem last night after installing the new (8/19) SLS
1.03 (pl12+ ?).  I tried to recompile to remove all of the extra
drivers.

I hacked a fix for it--it seems that some of the ifdefs are munged
in the fs Makefile.First, look in the Makefile in /usr/src/linux/fs.
Look for:

     ifdef CONFIG_QUOTA
     FS_SUBDIRS := $(FS_SUBDIRS) quota
     endif

Comment out the "ifdef" and "endif"--there's a routine in the quota
subdirectory which must be defined whether quotas are used or not.

Now go to /usr/src/linux/fs/quota and edit sys.c.  At line 95, a
dummy version of "sys_quotactl" is defined for use when quotasare off.
The function definition is munged-- it should be

    extern "C" int sys_quotactl(int cmd,....

and NOT

    int sys_quotactl(int cmd,....

(see the declaration of the "real" function at line 39.)

I think this is what the authors intended, and it gave me a working
kernel without quotas.  Sorry I couldn't provide a diff--I didn't
bother to save the original files.  (It's only 3 lines anyway).

Hope this helps,

Carl

Subject: Problems
Date: Tue, 24 Aug 1993 00:54:41 GMT

I am running .99pl12 w/o that extra little patch, on a WYSE 386/25 with 4MB and a 512K video
board, also with Net-010 network software.

In mounting an NFS drive, when I try to mount it it gives me:
'rpc mount: RPC: Authentication error; why = Invalid client credential'
The machine I am trying to mount has the filesystem exported to everyone.

In starting X, under root (twm) it comes up and as soon as I click to place a client on the
screen my machine reboots and and it reboots with memory read errors in the memory check.
Rebooting again clears the memory errors.

In starting X, uder user1 (olvwm) it comes up with the virtual desktop and when it tries (i
assume) to put up the clock (only client in .xinitrc) it hangs and the machine locks up.
Up until it hangs the keyboard and mouse are repsonding fine

In starting the NFS daemons, my kernel route table gets hosed and no netting (telnet or ftp) will work.

Any ideas on these problems?  I could really use the help

Thanks,

    A more accurate measure of the scsi code, IMHO, would be to use code
which would use scsi read and write instructions to do real low level
i/o, removing all other variables.

    I ran the above test and got 103 seconds, with a 386/40 and a Maxtor
120 HD. A test for scsi i/o should not be affaected by processor speed,
should it?

Should not be hard to write. Something like

  buf=malloc(16*1024*1024);
  fd=open("/dev/hda",O_RDWR);
  /* start timing */
  ...

  do 4*1024 times:
  read(fd,buf+p,4096); p+=4096;

  /* measure read-speed here */
  ...

  p=0;
  do 4*1024 times:
  write(fd,buf+p;4096); p+=4096;
  
  /* measure write-speed here */



By the way, don't forget to set the mode of this program to 01755,
link it statically, and do not use a swap-file in your system that is
located somewhere on /dev/hda :)

I won't try this until I have a tape-drive.
