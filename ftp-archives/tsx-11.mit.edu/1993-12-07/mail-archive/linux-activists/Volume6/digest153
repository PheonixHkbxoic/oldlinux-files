Subject: dip bug & fix
Date: 20 Aug 93 09:03:33 MET

Hi, I tried to mail this to Fred directly (waltje@uwalt.nl.magnet.org), but
it came back twice, so I thought I might as well post it, because I am
leaving for vacation really soon:

--- begin message
Hi Fred,
we have a little slip-network in our flat and my roomneighbour is using
linux with your slip-stuff, and we could not get the line to run in
anything but 2400 or 38400 Baud. My serial card can only do 115200,
19200 or less, nothing inbetween.
When using 2400 Baud, dip actually set the port speed to 2400, using
anything above 2400 like 4800, 9600 or 19200 baud set the speed to 38400.
Well, I looked into it and found a little bug in net-010/dig/serial.c!
You accidently ORed with the original again, so your & ~CBAUD was useless.
Here are the diffs:

--- snip
*** serial.c        Wed Aug 18 20:40:08 1993
--- serial.c.orig   Wed Aug 18 20:40:08 1993
***************
*** 244,248 ****
    }
    if ((baud = set_baud(speed)) < 0) return(baud);
!   tty.c_cflag = ((tty.c_cflag & ~CBAUD) | baud);
    if (ioctl(tty_fd, TCSETS, &tty) < 0) {
          fprintf(stderr, "dip: cannot ioctl(%d, SETS): %d\n", tty_fd, errno);
--- 244,248 ----
    }
    if ((baud = set_baud(speed)) < 0) return(baud);
!   tty.c_cflag |= ((tty.c_cflag & ~CBAUD) | baud);
    if (ioctl(tty_fd, TCSETS, &tty) < 0) {
          fprintf(stderr, "dip: cannot ioctl(%d, SETS): %d\n", tty_fd, errno);
--- snap

That was the reason why the port was not set to the correct speed.
When using a Modem you normally don't notice that, because most modems
don't care, what speed they are used with.
--- end message

In case Fred reads this: thanks for dip, it works great now.

Sure. The original PC had 8 interrupts. It used the 8259 interrupt
controller that has 8 inputs. When the AT and the ISA bus was released 8
more interrupts were added by cascading a second 8259 to the first. But
to do that one of the original interrupt lines had to be replaced. INT 2
was chosen. But since INT 2 was on the original bus and still needed to 
exist it was moved to the INT 9 slot. So on the ISA bus INT 2 replaces INT 9.
Quick picture:


Old 8 bit PC Bus

INT 0 -->|----|
...      |8259| -> 8088
INT 7 -->|----|

ISA PC Bus

INT 8 -->|----|   INT 0 -->|----|
INT 2 -->|8259|-->INT 2 -->|8259| -> 80[234]86
INT 10-->|    |   ..... -->|    |
..... -->|    |   ..... -->|    |
INT 15-->|----|   INT 7 -->|----|

Is Linux structurally less likely to play host to a virus?  I know
that MSDOS viruses probably won't work on a Linux system, but what
kind of measures are going to be neccessary when/if Linux becomes
very popular? 

Just an interesting thought....

Oh, and on a spurious note, there has got to be a better way to handle 
floppies.  Last night I overwrote one disk directory with another, all
because I switched disks without remounting.  Am I missing something?

Two options:

1) Floppy - Just dd the new kernel to a floppy using the command.
   $ dd if=/linux/Image of=/dev/fd0
   - use zImage if you do a make zImage
   - You may need to run rdev to set the proper root device and video modes

2) LILO 
   - Move the kernel to /. In fact I think you can put it anywhere. 
   - Goto /etc/lilo and make sure that you have an image entry with the
     filename of your new image. You can have multiple image entries just
     in case you want to keep your old kernel around until you've tested
     your new kernel out.
   - Run ./install in the /etc/lilo directory.
   - As always you can press any of SHIFT/CTRL/ALT/LOCK keys at the LILO
     prompt and pick the image to boot.

Hope this helps,

The byte filesystem benchmarks on our main work machine (Adaptec 1542B) are about
even between SCO and Linux running ext2fs. This disappointed me because
SCO _isn't_ that hot on filesystem peformance. On the other hand Linux is

 I have problems with dialing in on my own linux-box. As recommended

   I just installed a 387SX into my 386SX-25 system running Linux 0.99pl9,
which was loaded from SLS 1.01. Now ghostscript gives me the error message
"Floating point exception" on Postscript files that used to work, and still
run fine on my Postscript printer.
   I tried re-compiling the kernel (scary!) setting the CONFIG_MATH_EMULATION
flag to "no" in the config.in file - still no luck. (BTW, the new Image file
is almost twice as big as the old file - what happened?)
   I also tried re-installing SLS 1.01 from scratch. I recall an older SLS
asking me if I had a co-processor - this version didn't ask.
   Do I have to re-compile ghostscript? I didn't see a "numeric co-processor"
flag for gcc in the man - is there one?
   Other programs run fine (idraw does run significantly faster!), and the
(MSDOS) program that came with the 387SX says it's installed correctly.

   HELP!

I'll be giving it a try this weekend and can let you know if I was
successful.  I just bailed out of the 386/NetBSD whirlwind because those
in control of the code could not get the fixes for the 34F controller
pushed through the update pipeline in a timely manner.  I waited for over
six months and never got a kernel that would boot and recognize my 34F.

I'm giving Linux a try because of this.  I hope it works.

A: PENTIUM. Does anybody know whether or not linux will work on a
Pentium machine? (I might get one next month but I should know
beforehand, if possible.)

B: TELNET PROBLEMS. The configuration is as follows: linux box: 386/40
with copro, 2 AT-HD (120MB/250MB), Color Image VGA, Ne-2 ethernet
card.  To this an AT286 (20Mhz, some VGA, 20MB HD, NE1000, MS-DOS5) is
connected via Thin Ethernet cable. On the DOS side there is a packet
driver (LSL.COM and NE1000.COM) and a Kermit 3.12. Those two machines
are the only ones in that "net" (but there will be more).

  Under linux 0.99pl9 there were only little problems with a garbled
terminal under EMACS (probably due to unsufficient terminal
padding). Under pl10, pl11, pl12a with the new net software it takes
painful 2.5 minutes to establish the telnet connection, :-( After that
everything is OK and running with no problems at normal speed. Can
anyone tell me what the hell my computer is doing during those 2.5
minutes ?????? (Someone's using the AT so it would be nice if this

C: LPD. It simply doesn't work and I don't know why. I've included
it in the rc script but all printing jobs report something like "no
daemon present". Starting it again by hand doesn't help either.
The queued jobs will only be printed after restarting linux.

However, one can *not* include lpd into rc and then start lpd for
every printing job again (after that job). Any clues?

D: EDITING X-FONTS. I'm in need for X-fonts (cyrillic, slavic etc.)
which I might want to adapt anyway. Does there exist X-font packages
for slavic languages and/or an editor for X-fonts?

Linux is immune to MS-DOS and BIOS viruses.  It is *not* immune to boot-sector
viruses, because they do their dirty work before Linux or any other operating
system can get control.  (However, if it installs itself at boot time but
expects to do something when triggered by a BIOS call, it won't activate under
Linux.)

As for Linux-specific viruses:  notwithstanding a claim I saw this morning,
viruses per se are unlikely.  It looked more like an out-of-memory condition
to me; "Try again" is most probably EAGAIN, which indicates insufficient
system resources --- memory --- to perform the requested system call.  An
older System V I used to use would say "Fork failed" in that case.

Anyway:  patching code into a *ix binary is a bit trickier than for a DOS
binary.  COFF and ELF binaries are even harder (hint, hint!) because they tend
to get sticky about page alignment.  Have a look at unexec.c (available with
emacs and several other programs) for an example of what it takes to make
valid executables under various *ix versions.

But the term "virus" is usually tossed around rather loosely --- while viruses
(by the strict definition) are unlikely but not impossible under *ix, worms,
Trojan horses, etc. aren't unlikely at all.  Consider the Internet Worm.  The
distinction is that worms and Trojans don't patch existing programs; they are
separate programs.  Linux, by virtue of multiuser security, provides some
protection from these in the form of access restrictions based on user and
group IDs, but if such a program is run by the "root" user there isn't much in
the way of protection.  (There would still be some protection at least if
there were no /dev/mem, /dev/kmem, or /dev/port, but "root" has pretty much
free run of the system.)

You're missing proper change line support in your floppy drive... there isn't
a whole heck of a lot that an operating system can do about it otherwise
without slowing down floppy access a *lot* (e.g. by checksumming the entire
floppy on every access).  Hack-arounds have been discussed, but they are
either expensive or unreliable.

Subject: SLS 1.03 /usr busy, umount fails
Date: 21 Aug 1993 12:56:30 -0500

I have recently upgraded from SLS 1.02 to 1.03. I found that
the /etc/syslogd program was a source of umount reporting
that /usr was busy and it is unable to unmount it. Even after
killing syslogd and virtually every other process, I still
had the same problem. After preventing the startup of
syslogd, the problem seemed to go away. Now I find that it
happens every now an then. Running openwinows may be another
cause. I always cd to / before attempting a umount.
Has anyone else experienced this? What is the root cause?

Please reply via email or to comp.os.linux as our feed has
not yet started providing us with comp.os.linux.admin, etc.

Thanks!

When I run any xterm, be it color_xterm, fastscroll-xterm, or regular xterm,
the popup menus come up funny.  Only the top 20% of them are shown and the
rest of it just doesn't exist.  These are my xterm resources:
