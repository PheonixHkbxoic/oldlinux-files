Well, are you sure that mgetty 0.13 is running? In older versions, this
was common (well... that's what you get if you use unbuffered one-byte
read()s for ease of implementing), but in 0.13 the fax reception stuff
has been changed to use buffered read()s.

With the old unbuffered reads, it was very likely that data is lost, but
with 0.13, I have tried receiving a five-page fax while the system load
was at 5 (!) - and no lost any data at all (on a 386/40).

Does your port use a 16550? Which port speed do you use for fax
reception?

>I seem to have noticed that even during

That will not do any harm, since only the direction *to* the modem is
postprocessed by the serial driver.

One problem *may* be that you use a fairly old linux version, I think in
the serial driver had been a lot changes since then, improving reliability
at high speeds.

Subject: Help starting a printer daemon and ....
Date: 16 Sep 93 05:16:14 GMT


I have finally set up SLS 1.03 on my machine with Ultrastor 34F after
recompiling the kernel w/o soundcard support.  Now I have some other
questions.

1. I can't seems to start a printer daemon.  If in lpc I try:

lpc> start lp
lp:
        printing enabled
lpc: connect: No such file or directory
        couldn't start daemon
lpc> 

   What did I need to set up?  I've created a dir /usr/spool/lp1,
which was listed on the printcap file.

2. Running X with my Cirrus logic card and it freezes the system after
   logging in and out with xdm couple (mostly like the second) time.

3. Always get error message while starting up during rc.net.
   Something about invalid syntax, etc.
   I have a standalone machine, but I want to be able to telnet back
   to my own machine.  Telneting to localhost work.  But telnet to
   'machine name' conplain about network unreachable.

Any help will be much appreicated.  Please respond with email to:
rngai@oracle.com

Thanks,

I re-ftp'd the newer X4 disk of the slackware distribution and used the

Sorry to was the bandwidth but maybe someone out there has this problem

Does Linux support any display controllers in the 1280 x 1024
resolution mode? I'm especially interested to know if the QVision 1280
controller from Compaq is among the supported ones (with this
resolution).

Thanks in advance,

>6) Save and compress the swap partion to a file:

you don't actually need to save the WHOLE partition.  there are a 
number of DOS utilities that can tell you where the start of the 
data is on a partition.  save all of the sectors up to that one, 
and that one also. (for example: I had a setup where the fat took 
the first 23 sectors, so I saved 24, using
        dd if=/dev/hda4 of=/etc/dos.swp bs=512 count=24
    and
        dd if=/dev/hda4 of=/etc/linux.swp bs=512 count=24

    of course, the first dd was done after setting up the windoze
    swap file, the second, after running "mkswap" on the 
    partition.


>/bin/mkswap /dev/hda4 5967

becuase I also saved the first set of sectors when the partition 
was set up for linux, I restore with

        dd of=/dev/hda4 if=/etc/linux.swp bs=512 count=24
    instead.  faster than mkswap

I did something similar, then realized that, if using the sysvinit 
package, I was being silly.  If I had to do it again (different 
setup now, don't do stuff like above currently), I'd just modify
/etc/brc to look something like:

---
#!/bin/sh

PATH=/bin:/etc
export PATH

dd if=/etc/dos.swp of=/dev/hda4 count=24 bs=512

echo Unmount filesystems...
umount -a
---

NOTE: the "count=24" was for a PARTICULAR situation.  try using 
norton disk editor, or a share/freeware program called "fat", or 
something similar to figuire out what the number for your system 
should be.

hi...
first of all, thanks to everyone who helped me with the swap-disk prob.

here goes another FAQ question(?)
I couldn't find this in the FAQ.

I keep getting this message during boot time.

EXT2-fs warning: mounting unchecked file system, running e2fsck is recommended
[EXT II FS 0.3c, 93/08/05, bs=1024, fs=1024, gc=17, bpg=8192, ipg=1592}

I ran e2fsck several times but...
I am still getting this message...
what's the problem?
is this normal? and do I have to run 'e2fsck' every time I boot Linux?
any comments are welcomed.
Thanks..

Subject: strange unix socket behaviour (term gurus read too pls)
Date: Thu, 16 Sep 1993 05:42:34 GMT

Hello - I just set up the alpha 13 kernel to see if it would
fix up my unix socket weirdness, and it does - but only for a while?

just after a reboot I can 'netstat -x' and see the status of all the
af_unix connections, however, eventually (after running some term clients
usually) doing a 'netstat -x' produces a segmentation fault and a register
dump.  The seg fault happens in unix_get_info (from memory).

The reason Im concerned is that Im trying to modify the ftpd-diku
sources to work over a term connection.  It works fine, except that 
exenually (sooner or later) the 'connect' system call in terms
'open_unix' function catches a SIGCHLD, gets interrupted and the
program segfaults.  Under pl13 it takes lonmger for this to happen,
but it still does.

ok heres a little scenario for you:
before: netstat -x works fine
from remote I ftp into my tredired box
do a few dirs, then after about 5 or 6 -"425 remote server has closed connection"

debugging output from ftpd:
socket(PF_UNIX, STREAM, 0) = 13
connect(13, AF_UNIX(//.term/socket), 16) = -1 (Interrupted system call)
 - [SIGCHLD]
write(12, "connect 4 Interrupted system cal".., 34) = 34
close(13) = 0
 - [SIGSEGV]
 + [SIGSEGV]

result from netstat -x now
ahh.. well it erm still works at the moment ... hmm

ANYHOW - does anyone have any ideas what the SIGCHLD is doing and why it
causes that bit of code to seg fault?
also - if I put a loop around the connect, so that if it fails, it tries again,
it just loops indefinately, trying.

any help that anyone has to offer is muchly appreciated...

Don't do this! All you need to do is to include CLOCAL in your gettydefs.
This turns off the carrier detect and hangups in software. Much easier -
and it works for other Unices too.

I have to recommend maxima over the others mentioned in this thread.  It'll do
more than you asked, but does what you ask better than anything else in 
linux, w/o the hassle (IMO) of calc/emacs.

Here is a simple sample session

(some stuff deleted -- like when I make a mistake)

(C3) expand((x-1)*(x+2)*(x^2+1));

                              4    3    2
(D3)                         X  + X  - X  + X - 2
(C4) factor(x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 2);

                                             2
(D4)                       (X - 1) (X + 2) (X  + 1)
(C5) integrate((sec(x))^5,x);

                                                      3
      3 LOG(SIN(X) + 1)   3 LOG(SIN(X) - 1)      3 SIN (X) - 5 SIN(X)
(D5)  ----------------- - ----------------- - --------------------------
             16                  16                4            2
                                              8 SIN (X) - 16 SIN (X) + 8
(C6) diff(tan(x),x);

                                       2
(D6)                                SEC (X)
(C7) describe(limit);

  0: LIMIT(exp,
  1: TLIMIT(exp,var,val,dir)
Enter a number, or a Maxima list of numbers,  all or none:0;

LIMIT(exp, var, val, dir) finds the limit of exp as the real variable
var approaches the value val from the direction dir.  Dir may have the
value PLUS for a limit from above, MINUS for a limit from below, or
may be omitted (implying a two-sided limit is to be computed).  For
the method see Wang, P., "Evaluation of Definite Integrals by Symbolic
Manipulation" - Ph.D. Thesis - MAC TR-92 October 1971.  LIMIT uses the
following special symbols: INF (positive infinity) and MINF (negative
infinity).  On output it may also use UND (undefined), IND (indefinite
but bounded) and INFINITY (complex infinity).
LHOSPITALLIM[4] is the maximum number of times L'Hospital's rule
is used in LIMIT.  This prevents infinite looping in cases like
LIMIT(COT(X)/CSC(X),X,0).
TLIMSWITCH[FALSE] when true will cause the limit package to use
Taylor series when possible.
LIMSUBST[FALSE] prevents LIMIT from attempting substitutions on
unknown forms.  This is to avoid bugs like LIMIT(F(N)/F(N+1),N,INF);
giving 1.  Setting LIMSUBST to TRUE will allow such substitutions.
--More--
Since LIMIT is often called upon to simplify constant expressions,
for example, INF-1, LIMIT may be used in such cases with only one
argument, e.g. LIMIT(INF-1);
Do EXAMPLE(LIMIT); for examples.

(D7)                                 DONE
(C8) limit(sin(x)/x,x,0);

(D8)                                   1

This even shows how you can get on-line help, using describe();.

This is not as small a program as you might be looking for, but it sure 
does what you need, and you can figure out how to use it reasonably 
easily.

For graphics, use gnuplot.

Uhh... I've ported GNU utilities to System III (HP-UX 2.1 actually), 
and it wasn't that difficult.

Getting back on topic here, I was actually hoping for a Refridgerator
emulator for Linux.  It would be greate to not have to get up from the
computer in order get a snack and having somewhere stick old software
projects so the stay nice and fresh would be nice.  Just think of the
possibilities if you could use it over a network!

the OSes our customers run, test our drivers, run
benchmarks, etc.

I want the Lab to install Linux and check it out.  But
I can't make a business case for doing it without knowing
how big the Linux market is.  (All of Unix is only about
5% of our market.)  How many people run Linux,
on how many machines?  If you think you know or have a way to
measure, I'd like to hear from you.  Thanks.

(BTW, I got my dial-up logins working by switching from
bash to pdksh.  Don't know why bash doesn't like my modem,
but I like ksh better anyway, and my users don't care.
Thanks to everyone who offered advice!)
