Thanks to all the people who responded to my previous query, however I have
another query.

It was suggested that this was an X-installation fault, so I wiped off my
complete X distribution and reinstalled it.

Color Xterm still failed. Perhaps someone could send me owner and group
listings for all of the relevant /dev entries ?

Thanks.

Chris.

The above copy of the file is way out of date -- it is from January.
The August version can be found in
   ftp.uu.net:usenet/news.answers/pc-unix/software.Z
Also, it is not true that it "discusses all these... in detail."  All it
says about Interactive Unix is that it is SVR3 and that the FAQ's author
considers it uninteresting.  All it says about Solaris 2.1 is that it is
"just released."  All it says about NeXTStep is that it is "scheduled for
beta release in 4th quarter '92."

I agree with the other things you said but I can't agree with this one.
Games under Unix/X11 suck raw eggs.  The day I delete my DOS partition
is the day I can get X-Wing, Prince of Persia II and Wing Commander for
Linux/X11.

I use TeX (actually LaTeX) too, but I don't think having the choice of
WYSIWYGs would hurt, some people actually prefer that.

He probably meant MKS Tools.  It's a DOS package that gives you Unix-
like utilities like cp, mv, grep, vi, etc. and sells for $300.  ;-)

We had this flamewar last time :-(  Emacs is just too big and has too much
baggage.  I even suggested starting with a cut-down emacs and was rejected.
I think it's safe to say that this is a no-go.

It's been tried --- check out VorTeX.  It doesn't work too well in practice,
unfortunately.  TeX doesn't finalize a page until it's formatted most of the
next page, which complicates things enormously.

We discussed this in the last c.o.l word processor discussion.  Interviews has
one glaring fault:  it's designed on the assumption that infinite disk space,
RAM, and CPU cycles are available.  The current design we're looking at uses
much of the same structure as Interviews but assumes it will run on a much
more modest system.

Yes. Any WP system that's built on top of another system will have to carry
all the baggage of the system it's built upon. A WP is heavily used enough
and important enough to a system to require it to be built from scratch.
However any devlopment tools designed for building applications (like
ObjectBuilder and tcl/Tk) would be muchly helpful in the process of building
the application.

Better to design and write from scratch. That way you can develop an 
application with its own personal set of problems. ;-) ;-) ;-)

Stephen Tweedie has (almost) put together such a package for ext2fs.  it
didn't quite work out of the box for me, but it might for you.  It includes
a modified mount and some example code to put in your /etc/rc.  You
need a shutdown/reboot that unmount all your partitions upon shutdown,
and a kernel that can handle "unmounting" the root partition (which
really means re-mounting it read-only).  You also need to have LILO
or rdev make sure the kernel boots with your root partition read-only. 
0.99pl10 and pl11 can handle all this, I think.

The end result is that proper shutdowns set the "clean" flag of the ext2fs.
Crashes do not.  When you boot, /etc/rc invokes e2fsck, which notices that
the clean flag is not set, and does its magic.

When it's done, /etc/rc remounts your root writeable, mounts all the other
filesystems, and continues.  There's really no need to reboot, unless I'm
missing something.  A read-only filesystem is quiescent, so there's no
danger of conflict between e2fsck and the kernel.  Remounting the
filesystem should make sure the kernel and disk images of the filesystem
stay in sync.

I do hope SLS incorporates this functionality.  Oh, by the way, the 
package is called bootutils-0.1.tar.z (or something like that) and
can be found on the major archives.

I proffered this suggestion myself about a week ago. However someone posted
something that was even more interesting: object based format. What I got
from it is that a document will be kept as a collection on objects. The user
can manipulate the objects using some kind of front end and some back end
tools can convert the object collection into whatever format you want: TeX,
PS, SMGL, whatever. Imagine a set of linked objects with one object per 
paragraph for example. If you can to change the font of the paragraph just
send a font change message (or method call) with the font to change to and
BOOF! the whole paragraph changes it font. Moving stuff around is as simple
as changing the linkages between the objects. If you move text from one
place to another the object where the text was gets a delete message and the
object where the text is to go gets an insert message. You can have text
objects, image objects, spreadsheet objects, what have you. It's a totally
cool concept (wish I'd though of it myself).

There's a WORD channel that folks can join. I haven't yet because I can't
afford to get involved in it right now. PhD work you know.

Later,

BAJ

On the Gateway NOMAD, this does not seem to happen. However, the initial

Use "useradd" instead of "adduser".  Some of my menus also are

You need Berkeley's "pmake" to use the supplied makefile.  I ported pmake

I found *something* that behaved like this very quickly: I sic'ed C-news
on ash.  :-)  C-news has this wonderful ability to expose the bugs in
any Bourne-style shell you care to name.   :-)

Indeed.  I wonder if it's the only bug, though.  Probably not...

Yes, that should be adequate.  I don't run X myself, but 8 meg, and a swap file

Get the 424 meg drive if you are interested in developing things for Linux.
120meg is more than adequate, if you don't run X. :-)

[ I'm starting a policy of cross-posting to c.o.l and the appropriate
  new newsgroup with the followup to the new newsgroup. It gives initial
  visibility but directs the discussion to the appropriate news group. ]

I'm enjoying Linux so much that I'm starting to think about having more
machines at home. The kiddies need one and it would be kinda nice to
have a machine downstairs where I won't seem like such a hermit to my
wife and kids ;-)

To that end I'm wondering what would be the least expensive usable
hardware configuration. This is what I'd like to be able to run:

- Linux (obviously)
- X windows
- Networking/NFS

NFS is important I think because I'd like to have my machine be a central
server and other machines be clients. 

So I throw out the challenge: What is the least expensive configuration
that'll do what I want.

Here is my first crack at it (I almost forgot the video! ;-):
$100.00 - 33 Mhz 386sx motherboard
$120.00 - 4 MB of memory - Net bought of course ;-)
$115.00 - 14 inch mono VGA monitors
$ 80.00 - 40 Meg IDE drive - remember most of the software will be NFSed.
$ 40.00 - Case and power supply - This is a cheat. A local dealer is
          getting rid of some large AT size cases with 200 W PS.
$ 35.00 - Generic VGA card - only running the monochrome server.
$ 30.00 - Ethernet Card - Buy 3 on the special offer floating on the net.
$ 25.00 - 101 key keyboard
$ 20.00 - Multi IDE card - 1 parallel - 2 serial - 2 IDE
=======
$565.00 + Tax or shipping.

What do you think? Of course for $45 more I can get a 40 Mhz 386 motherboard
with 128K cache.

Has anyone done this. With the relatively minicule cost of PC hardware and
the wonderfullness of Linux I don't see why some folks don't have a machine
in every room of their house ;-)

Later,

BAJ
