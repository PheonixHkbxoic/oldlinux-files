I am trying to run a gopher server under Linux (based on the latest SLS 
package), but all gopher servers I have tried (Minnesota and gn) give the same 
error message: "Cannot determine the name of this host". This seems a bit 
strange since the server is told the name of this host in the makefile. Could 
someone give me a clue? Am I making some silly mistake?

sorry, didn't read right, had some trouble installing lilo on several

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once corrected to `same partition', this is still a non-trivial
assumption. I have separate root, /usr and /home partitions and 
so do many others I expect, so hard links will not work.
Furthermore, for safety and security I would recommend that
anyone setting up an anonymous ftp area try to separate the
environment as much as possible from the real environment.
In particular, if a user within the restricted file system
manages to write to and trash the library then, with your
setup, all other users are taken down too because the library
in the (unsafe) ftp area is (a hard link to) the real library.

It is a difficult job to make a secure part of the filesystem
available widely (witness the recent security holes with
ftp daemons of all origins and the even more recent security
problems with many gopher server setups.) I wouldn't tempt fate
by placing real (hard links to) libraries in there too.

Subject: KA9Q question
Date: 31 Aug 1993 17:09:06 GMT

I know this isn't a ka9q section but one of you Linux guru's have probably
experienced this...(besides until I get Linux working with SLIP here I'm
forced to use ka9q)

I have ka9q logging successfully into a ppp connection and I can telnet, ftp,
etc... BUT the terminal emulation is messed up.  Whenever I do any commands 
that clear the screen (i.e. more) it clears the screen before waiting for a 
keystroke, thus I get text...whammo...clear screen.

The SET command reveals that my terminal is a sun !#$@#

I did a setenv TERM vt100 and it took it but I don't think ka9q uses a full
VT100 emulation because the same problem persists.

Has anyone experienced this?

Thanks,
Tom Bilan

It is called XSB and runs out of the box (on my Linux system that is).

Subject: Re: linux slow > 16mb RAM?

I'm running a '486/33 with 20 megs of SIMM RAM.
While for other people, compiling a kernel takes 15 to 20 minutes (Something
like that), it takes my machine over an hour and a half.  BTW, these 'other'
people are also using '486/33 or slower machines.

Any suggestions for what I could/should do?  SHould I just pull 4 megs and run
at 16 MB?  Is there something I set somewhere to correct this problem?

thanks,

I think you should add the name and the address of the gopher server into
the /etc/hosts file.

A answer from our nameserver:

(ganter)~#nslookup gopher.uiuc.edu
Server:  fstgds01.tu-graz.ac.at
Address:  129.27.2.3

Name:    vixen.cso.uiuc.edu
Address:  128.174.5.58
Aliases:  gopher.uiuc.edu

I hope it helps!
