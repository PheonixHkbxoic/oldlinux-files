I did a warmboot.com for the Linux .99P2 floppy disk. It started to load
then hung at this twice repeated line: SCSI host 3 timed out - aborting
command.  Some other error lines in order of appearance but not
neccessarily sequential where:  SCSI3: unexpected interrupt
SCSI0: Seagate ST-01/ST-02
detected SCSI disk.sd0 at SCS3, id 0 lan0
SCSI:detected 1 SCS1 disk 0 tapes 0 CD-ROM drives total

This floppy successfully booted and loaded the whole Linux.  So, what's
the problem on my computer?  Does SCSI mean Scuzzy drive?  Does Linux have
a problem with that?  Anyone got a patch or fix?  Here or email would be
appreciated.

This is correct. Of course there are Unix clones for the 286 (Coherent and SCO
come to mind). But by the time you've bought the pieces to make it close
to a Linux systems you'll have spent several hundred bucks. Best bet is
to upgrade your motherboard probably. You can get a 386SX40 for $99, a 386DX40
for around $140, and a 486DLC40 in the $225 range. Remember to add about $140
for 4 megs of DRAM (minimum needed to use Linux Effectively). So for less
than $300 you can have the hardware for Linux as opposed for the software
for the 286.

I have a dream of having cheapie Linux boxes all around my house in a network,
so low end Linux compatible hardware is my specialty.

Can anyone quote a price for SCO or Coherent with TCPIP+X?

 Correct me if I am wrong...
 I thought you could run any unix application under linux ( or so
 a friend tells me ).  If so, I have a couple of suggestions.
 For word processing, there's IslandWrite  -  although it has its
 little quirks at times.
 And then there is WingZ for spreadsheets.  And I heard Improv was
 also a good application to use, but I haven't had any first-hand
 experience.

Assuming that you have the printer setup such that lpr works, you can
add the following line to $(HOME)/.preferences, to get previewing to
work via ghostscript.  The PrintCommand stage uses lpr, so if you have
your PRINTER environment variable set, it should work: 

PrinterType: ps 
PreviewCommand: grops | ghostview - 
FormatCommand: cat /tmp/%s.n | gpic | gtbl | geqn | gtroff | 
PrintCommand: grops | lpr -h 

These are fair;y general preferences, so if you want them to apply to
everyone using your system, add them to /usr/andrew/lib/global.prf.

I have downloaded version 3.10 from nic.funet.fi which

straight from the box for linux. I unfortunately have
very little knowledge of c programming.

The problem occurs right near the end of te compile,
when it gets to the machine specific stuff in
src/Makefile. I get the following error message--

Error: Definition of symbol _ospeed (multiply defined)

I know that it has something to do with the LIB
variable, but changing them does not help.

If anybody knows what this means and can help me out,
please do as I am desperate.

Thanks in advance,

   So today our Sys admin comes and pulls off the ethernet connection

   using the IP which was assigned to it.
   Could it be some program is spitting out the illegal IP ? I am not

   and ftp.
   I am not too familiar with the Network stuff and am clueless as to

Subject: Linux questions (need FAQ - where?)
Date: Tue, 9 Nov 1993 23:37:53 GMT


Hi all!

I'm seriously considering installing Linux here, and I'm
wondering if anyone could tell me a few things.

First, my hardware:
    - 386DX33 with a 387
    - 8Mb RAM
    - Trident 8900C video card
    - 42Mb and 212Mb hard drives
    - internal USR 14400 modem (on com3/irq5/0E38)

1.  Is there an FAQ available for ftp?  Where?

    The rest of these questions are likely to be to be answered
    by the FAQ, but I'll ask them anyway...

2.  Exactly how much hard drive real estate does a full install
    (WITH Xwindows) take?

3.  What software does it come with (word processors, etc)?

4.  What limitations does it have with running DOS applications?

5.  Will I be able to use Borland C++ in a DOS box?

6.  Will I be able to use a boot program so that I can easily run
    "pure" DOS?  (ie, have DOS on my 40Mb HD, and Linux on the
    second 212Mb).

7.  What is the latest version of Linux?  Any serious problems with it?

8.  Will it compile "normal" unix C/C++ programs without any
    problems, and will C/C++ (and even scripts) developed under
    it compile OK on a mainframe (SUN, version 5 I think)?

9.  Will the comms program(s) that come with it (I hope!!) be
    able to properly handle my "non-standard" internal modem?
    Is there a version of Zmodem available for it?

The reason for all this is because I have to do some serious
programming work, for both DOS and UNIX; I particularly need to
learn about programming with Xwindows resources, and what better
way to do this than to have it here at home?

I want to put linux on my 2nd 212 HD (currently partitioned
80/40/40/40Mb), and leave dos on my 40Mb HD.  However, I doubt
that this will be enough, so I will likely need to consider
leaving another dos partition on the 2nd HD.  Hopefully I will be
able to afford another larger HD to replace the 40Mb in a few
months).

Thanks for any help.

Cheers
Tony
