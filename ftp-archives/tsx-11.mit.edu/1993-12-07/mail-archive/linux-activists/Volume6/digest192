Try much fast than a sparc2, for some things at least.

I wrote a little program to test memory copies, which copies
a 4Mb chunk 64 times.   It takes 54s on a mildly loaded sparc2
and about 10s on a very lightly loaded linux dx2/66.

i.e. a $4000 machine way outperforming a $25000 machine :-)

Of course, all benchmarks are lies and this program particularly
so.

Here's the source.
Invoke as:
        time ./memtest 4194304 64

Please email me comments on this program if any.
It's from an idea of Piercarlo Grandi's;
I've reproduced some mail from him on this subject:

  Now I'll have to track a mem test program down and also some standard
  figures for my machine (dx2/66, 16Mb ram, 256k cache).  Presumably
  they're available for dos on the net somewhere, I might knock one up
  myself for Linux.
 
Just a simple loop (define two 2-4MB arrays; memcpy between them 64 times)
will do. I get 256MB copied in 14 seconds with my 486DX@33, which is more
or less equivalent to a SUN SS-10 or a DEC 5000/200, in other words rather
satisfactory. I would surmise that you should get about the same; after all
clock doubling does not affect the speed of the memory subsystem. Tip:
enabling write back caching helps...

Subject: Setting up user accounts
Date: 1 Sep 1993 04:32:55 GMT

I couldn't find adduser in my SLS distribution so I am trying to add users 
via useradd.  Right after I add them, I see their names in the /etc/passwd
file but I cannot log in!  The passwd file is set for -rw-rw-r-- and
there is no /etc/nologin file.  I know I am missing something relatively
easy because I haven't had this problem in previous installations.

I even set up /etc for drwxrwxrwx but nothing.  

I'm getting a "Login incorrect" error message. 

Whe I played around with the /etc/shadow file I got to log in but it told
me my password had expired and was going to let me change it but then said
I couldn't, the password was locked.

Thanks,
Tom Bilan

Try looking up the DOS command append (I think - it could be join), but

First off, I've already read every FAQ list I could get my hands on,
but I still don't know the answer to this (seemingly) simple question:

        Does Linux support any non-SCSI backup tape systems?

The reason I ask:  I'm looking to purchase a (low-cost) PC system on
which to run Linux.  SCSI controllers aren't exactly low-cost, however.

Please email replies; I'll post a summary if there's sufficient interest.

After you've created the user with useradd, use the passwd utility to set
the password of the newly added user.  Let's say you did a 'useradd tom',
then issue this command 'passwd tom xyzzy' for example.  Now the password
is set for user 'tom'.  NOW you can login as 'tom'.

Try xtrekII the next generation also called Netrek. There are binaries for

Ok, for all those who don't like to read README's. Look at the Imakefile
and you will file a line that says
#define HAVE_XPM.
Because you obiously don't have this library, you will have to out-comment
it to disable colored icons.

Preview of Version 0.5.0:
===================
The next version, release date end of this month, will use tar files as
restricted filesystems (only an extract operation will be allowed. It will
also include a package-builder for tar, tar.Z and tar.gz files (with drag&drop
of course).
The missing two operations of the file-menu will be filled with some life
and for all that are not sure if they want to delete files, it will use a
userdefined directory as trashcan.
There have also been a lot of little bug-fixes, especially for these
weird multi-selections, and I am now using iconbutton and iconwidgets
instead of the former, very bad looking construction.

Another good one is SWI-Prolog.  Available from swi.psy.uva.nl

This has lots of good features.  It can be run in an emacs buffer very
nicely, and If I remember correctly there is also an X interface. (That

Perhaps the problem is here: try to delete all password-info from /etc/shadow
and remove all stuff after the password; the entry should be like the
root-entry. Then there will be no expire at all; if the password is not given
in /etc/shadow You should be able to login only with Your User-Name.
Try !
If it's working, You should read 'man shadow' for understanding what useradd
has done wrong !?
