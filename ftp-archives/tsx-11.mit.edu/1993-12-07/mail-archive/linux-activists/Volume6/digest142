Yes, off the platter, maybe. But there's a long way between the Linux
VFS and the disk platter (eg. ext2fs, buffer cache, sd driver, SCSI bus,
disk controller) which complicates things somewhat. Try iozone with
the NO_DELETE option on an unused disk partition to get a lower-level
view of things.

I've searched through the FAQ and it's either not there or I missed

been ported to Linux.  This would be a big help as I'm about to take a

Date: 18 Aug 93 20:14:27 GMT


        Hello,

        Well,  looks like I have a problem >:( !

        I have a Priam RLL drive/controller with the following:

                Cyl     hd      sec             Approx MB
                1224    15      26              238

        These above values were used and placed into CMOS
        and I ran DOS 3 -> DOS 6.0 (w/dblspace) and had
        absolutely no problems with it.  Until....

        I ran the `fdisk' program after booting LILO, and
        fdisk returned the partition status:

                Cyl     hd      sec
                932     16      32      ????

        Well, I proceeded from there and tried to setup a
        DOS partition, and a Linux partition....

        Rebooted, and ran mke2fs.

        Well folks,  looks like I'm doomed at this point.  I got
        all sorts of problems, too long to list here and it really
        went beserk!  I thought, well no problem,  Ill just put
        things back to where they were, and solve this problem later.

        I then decided to read the Priam manual, and in it states:
        "Do _NOT_ use any other disk programs as 'fdsik', (and others)
        ... and you must use Priam's programs: edisk..."

        Ahhhh...  I don't even have it!  The person I bought it from
        never gave it to me!!!!

        So,  Is there any light at the end of the tunnel?

        Any suggestions, help, comments is appreaciated...  if
        it turns out that I cannot use this drive for Linux
        is there anyone out there who wants to trade/buy it cheap??


        Sigh...

I'm not sending this message as a plug, I don't work for the company anymore,
but I recommend Continental Computer Systems computers.  I've worked
extensively with them and I have had very few problems.  The systems
are specifically set up for SCO unix and odt, primarily SCSI, but If you
call them up and tell them what operating system you want to run, usually
they can recommend what changes need to be made, and set it up properly.
Sometimes they'll even find the OS you want and load it for you, depending
what the OS is.  I know they do SCO and Interactive (occationally) and they
have just started playing with NeXT step.  After I stopped working for them
I took care of some their field service contracts around New England so I 
feel I can honestly recommend them as reliable.

but ... as the saying goes ... that's my opinion.

oh and BTW, almost every computer they are putting out these days is a
486/50 or stronger.  they have been working with corrollary (SP?) for
awile, but those are REALLY expensive.

if anyone has any questiona about them, I'd be glad to give you their
number and such (and the name of a salesman I actually trust).
The only catch is that I'm going to be out of town for two weeks, so
I won't have access to Email or News until around the first or
second of September.  if you're interested though, please feel free
to mail me, and I'll answer as soon as I return.

  Sorry to hear about the suicide part.  As I remember those first
  versions of DOS, (1.1 is the first I remember using), $12,000 was
  a fair price.  Billy and crowd made significant improvments, and
  after all, Billy was able to get IBM to re-sell it.  The original
  developer wouldn't have seen even $12,000 if he'd try to do it without
  Bill and IBM.

  Thanks for the local folklore.

  I should just mention that the story is folklore; the guy might still be

Steer clear of MIT C-Scheme: it's a dog. I'd recommend using at SCM
together SLIB. SCM is usually between 10 & 50 times faster than MIT C-Scheme
(for interpreted code, of course). This is what I use.

Another speed demon is Scheme48. Didn't someone get this running on Linux?

You might also check out Elk and Scheme-to-C. It's my recollection that each of
them had some kind of Linux support, but in both cases it was distributed
as "untested".

And then of course there is SIOD and UMB Scheme should compile cleanly, but
SCM is faster and more complete than both.

I don't know whether VSCM or BIGLOO will run on Linux.

Hope this helps.

Numerous people from this newsgroup have asked me to post here whenever I
find an excellent deal on something that might be of interest to the
general community.  I *DO NOT* intend to post items of this sort
regularly here.  Rather, I will usually post *ONLY* in the .forsale
newsgroups.  This is a worthy exception because it is an absolutely
awesome deal.

 (Please note that many people have already bought tape drives
 and CD-ROM drives from me.  I have a list of testimonies that I can
 E-mail to anyone on request.  A few are provided at the end of this post.)

 Quite a few people have asked me if I can get any other equipment for
 the kind of prices I have been getting the tape drives, CD-ROM drives
 and modems for.  The most frequently asked for items have been SCSI
 controllers (to go with the tape and CD-ROM drives) and hard drives.
 (I now have some *BRAND NEW* Adaptec 1540B SCSI controllers for $120
 each.  I will be posting these to the .forsale newsgroups shortly;
 but if you want one you can call now.)  The following is an
 *EXTREMELY* good deal on some brand new 383 Meg Seagate SCSI hard drives.

 The description follows:

 I have a few *BRAND NEW* 383 Meg Seagate SCSI hard drives.
 These drives went for $450.00 regularly.  I
 will give these 383 Meg drives away to anyone who wants one for $260.00 each 
 (THESE ARE BRAND NEW).  Call me immediately if you want one because I
 will give them out on a first come first serve basis and THEY WILL GO
 FAST.  If you think it is too late and they are already gone call anyway
 because your call will put you in line for one if I can get any more. My home
 phone number is (617) 246-3634.  My wife's name is Julie and she can take
 down your order info..  I am there in the evenings.  If neither of us
 is there you can leave a message on our machine and I will call you
 within hours of your leaving a message.  I will return *ALL* calls.
 If you can't reach me then send me E-mail reserving a drive and
 give me a phone number you can be reached at.
 Now you can afford a decent sized hard drive and *YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PAY
 ALOT FOR IT!!!*

 These are Seagate ST-2383N SCSI Hard Drives.  They were manufactured
 by SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY and they are high quality (University quality)
 drives.  These drives are internal 5 1/4" Half Height Drives.  They
 are vastly superior to most of the non-SCSI hard drives out there.
 They will work with *ANY* SCSI controller.

 These Seagates are brand new, still in the box, and come with
 *EVERYTHING*. They come with docs, and everything necessary for installation. 
 It is a complete package.  When you get your drive you will have all that you
 need to use it.  They are 100% guaranteed for 30 days.  If you get one
 and you don't like the way it matches your wallpaper simply return it
 for your money back *NO QUESTIONS ASKED*!

 I will be shipping out 25 of these in the next week or so.  I need to
 pay the cash up front to my brother. (He is the industrial reseller I
 am getting them from.)  He will acquire them and I will
 ship them out.  One way of doing this would be C.O.D..  However, this
 would require my coming up with over $6500.00 up front and waiting for
 money to come back to me.  Since I cannot do this payment C.O.D. is
 not possible.

 I may be able to take your credit card for these.  My home phone number is
 (617) 246-3634.  You can call me *ANYTIME* up until 2:00 AM seven days
 a week.  My wife, Julie, is home during the day (so she can take your
 order then) and I am home in the evenings.

 I repackaged my Seagate, went to UPS, weighed the package, and found out
 the cost of S&H.  I asked them for worst case S&H in the continental
 U.S. (i.e., California).  S&H with insurance for $350.00 plus tracking
 would cost $10.00 from Boston to California.  That is what I will
 charge everyone for S&H.

 These drives also work perfectly with Linux, BSD, and other Unices for the PC.


 I WILL GIVE THESE OUT ON A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS.  FROM MY
 EXPERIENCE IN THE PAST, MY E-MAIL WILL BE CRAZY!


 If you are going to pay with a check or money order:

 In order to acquire a Toshiba make your payment or money order for $270.00
 payable to:

 Dr. John V. Jaskolski

 send it to:

 Dr. John V. Jaskolski
 Suite #307
 95 Audubon Rd.
 Wakefield, MA.

 E-MAIL me confirming exactly what you want and in what quantity and
 indicate how much money you sent in your payment.

 Sincerely,
 Dr. John V. Jaskolski

 P.S.  The Specs follow:

 I am always looking for equipment that is dirt cheap.  I especially
 like prices that are around 50% less than the cheapest price around.
 I decided to go with these since the price is right (You
 can't get 383 Meg SCSI hard drives *ANYWHERE* for $260.00).  They
 provide industry standard performance *AND* they work with everything.
 Also, these drives are *BRAND NEW*! No Non-SCSI hard drive even
 comes close to the quality of these drives.

Don't expect to find the sources to UNIX lex.  I would imagine that it
is still subject to a USL copyright.  Flex is a superior product
anyway:

1) It reads most lex files (gwm is a notable exception).
2) It can output ANSI C and C++, not just K&R C.
3) It's scanners are almost always faster than those produced by lex.
4) It is free.
5) It has cool features like exclusive start conditions that can
   reduce stress and simplify your life.

By now everyone probably knows that for many (most?) people networking
in pl12 doesn't work - they can't create routes and without routes
there's not a lot one can do. Everyone has probably also heard that
libc-4.4.2 fixes this.

Well it doesn't - not for me anyhow. I still get the dreaded "network
unreachable". I've double checked the card parameters in my pl12
kernel and they are the same as the ones in my pl11 one. 

I'm back on pl11 to post this.
 
Help!
