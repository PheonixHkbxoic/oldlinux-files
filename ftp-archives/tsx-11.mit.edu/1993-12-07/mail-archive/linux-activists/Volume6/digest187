Hi, 

here's a couple of lines from a recent netstat -a running pl12 and SLIP to a 
Sun...

Active Internet connections
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address          Foreign Address        (State)
udp       -1 -7842048 *:631                  womble:nfs        ESTABLISHED

Some *wierd* numbers => overflow somewhere....?

This is in a kernel I have re-built, but its basically the pl12 kernel with
Linus' memory patches and the drivers I need.

Any ideas?

regards

Subject: Incoming telnet connections to pl10
Date: Tue, 31 Aug 1993 11:35:28 GMT

I am at present writing a kingd of chatting programme which relies on
incoming telnet connections to port 3333 on this machine.

However, tests have revealed that after about 25 or 26 incoming connections,
the system starts complaining about fork: try again.

I wonder - Is there any way to increase this limit ? Ideally 64 incoming
connections would be preferable.

Perhaps the problem is because all of the connections are via the loopback
device ? Maybe it would be alleviated if they were external connections,
except I have no way at present of testing this as I am not on an ethernet
yet.

Subject: How to make the latest libc-lite?

I have libc-4.4.1 source code and was trying to make libc-lite.4.4.1
when I got the following error message:

make LITE=true
        :

Reading configuration files from ./jump/libc.lite
/usr/dll/bin/mkimage: no source file for symbol '_rpc_createerr'
make: *** [build.lite] Error 1

I have successfully compiled libc.4.4.1 and libc.so.4.4.1 from
this source.

I want to make the latest libc-lite to put on a root floppy, and
I can't find libc-lite.4.4.1 in the archives on sunsite or tsx-11
as an image.  Some of the programs on the floppy were compiled
using libc.so.4.4.1 and emit a warning that the library's minor
number is behind.

I'm not really concerned about getting the latest libc-lite
immediately because things still work, but eventually I'll probably
have to get a later version of it than that which came with my
SLS 1.01 distribution.

I have linux-0.99.10, gcc-2.4.5, and lib[cm].so.4.4.1 (from
image-4.4.1).  If someone could give me a little help I'd 
appreciate it.  Thanks.

  Above tape drive works right outta the box ...

        - assure SCSI-Tape-Support is configured into your
          kernel (assuming that you built it yourself)

        - have the tape drive switched "on" while booting the machine
          (otherwise it is not seen on the SCSI-Bus and refused to be
          used later. You may switch it "off" after it was recognized)

        - ln /dev/rmt /dev/rmt0
          ln /dev/rmt /dev/rmt8
          ln /dev/rmt /dev/rmt16
          ln /dev/rmt /dev/tape   (for the 'mt'-command)

  ... you're done -- just use it and have fun!

I'm trying to set up printing on my linux system (SLS 1.03), but the "lpd"
daemon won't run.  If I start it, it simply exits immediately. My "printcap"
file just says:

    lp:\

        :sd=/usr/spool/lp1:\
        :mx#0:

The directory "/usr/spool/lp1" does exist.

Whenever I try to print I get:

    lpr: Connect: No such file or directory
         couldn't start daemon

The device is OK - copying a file to /dev/lp1 print it OK.

Could someone help please?

Jeez.  Simple:  using FDISK, set ONLY the disk with lilo as the active

Date: 30 Aug 93 23:08:28 GMT

Hi,

I'm trying to get the Silicon Graphics machines at work to back up my
entire Linux harddrive (200mb) on this TI laptop.  I'm running pl9,
with the d-link drivers added in the kernel.  I purchased a d-link
pocket adaptor, which when used can access the net at work and let the
SGI mount the harddrive.  Using NFS to read the laptops drive works, but 
when we issue the command for the SGI to copy the laptop's harddrive
to the tapedrive, we get the following message:

UDP: send: lenght 2092 > mtu 1500 (ignored)

does anyone know what this means, and how we can straighten
things out? 

As soon as the laptop can reliably let it's harddrive be backed-up to a
tapedrive, then I'll feel much freer to carry this machine aroundand not
worry about losing the OS.

Yon need to use the rz and sz functions within seyon. They exist under
the transfer menu. Usually the program has auto z modem enabled so you
dont need to type rz when receiving data. Also make sure you have the
correct versions of rz and sz for both hosts as I have found some of
them give rise to problems such a yours.

Well Linux has a lot of pieces. Newest versions on the street (to the best
of my knowledge) is a follows:

Kernel: 0.99pl12
   GCC: 2.4.5
GCCLIB: 4.4.1 ( with 4.4.2 to be soon released. Alpha version in SLS 1.03)
   X  : 1.3
ext2fs: 0.3

>where can i find the files (all of them).

All of them can be found in the latest distributions:

1) Slackware - latest version:1.01 1.02 to be released within a couple of
               weeks with a completely rewritten installation and management
               suite.
2) Debian - A much talked about initial release of a new Linux distribution.
            Supposed to be out on the street in a couple of weeks.
3) MCC - I think the pl12 kernel version has been added. 
4) SLS - 1.03 has everything. Lots of reported bugs and bug fixes in the last
         2 weeks.

Main US Linux sites:
tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux

I think the original kernel distribution site is nic.funet.fi.

Hope this helps,

Dialins with flexfax are possible, I've been running it for ages.
Add this line to config.cua1:
