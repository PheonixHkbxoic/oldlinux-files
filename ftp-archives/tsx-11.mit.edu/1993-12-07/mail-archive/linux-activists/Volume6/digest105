No, no quatifiable results, sadly.  However, I have run 386BSD (for about
10 months prio ro installing Linux), and on my hardware, FFS does feel a 
bit faster than even ext2fs.  My first choice was Minix fs, and that was
dog-slow compared to FFS.

Until MS-DOG ate the partition table, I had a rather good setup - in fact,
during the ten months, I only lost one file due to improper shutdown/startup
procedures.  Seems to me the FFS is quite robust.  
Its use of frags can be disoncerting to some; primarily, after a rather
long time in use, the filesystem degrades to the point where holy small files
can be put on the system.  For exaple, even if df shows something like 3 megs
free, one can't write a 3 meg file - one can only write smaller files totalling
3 megs.

One thing I would like to see in SLS is a real etc/rc startup procedure that
runs e2fsck upon boot, and if the file system gets modified by it, reboot.

One other reason that one would want to use Linux:  Lets say you are a contract
programmer, and your client needs a program to do a particular thing.  In many
cases, it doesn't matter what operating system it runs on, just as long as it
works well.  Assuming you are an experienced Unix programmer, and prefer to
work under that environment, then you could develop the program to run under 
Linux, and have the advantage of having full source to the operating system so
you can tweak it to your needs.  It also gives you the ability to charge for
support and upgrade services.

Your system probably has a Compaq AVGA or QVision chipset.
The current AVGA support in XFree86 1.3 was written
for the LTE Lite/25c which has the AVGA chipset with
512 Kb of video memory and 3 clock frequencies
(25, 28 and 41 MHz). I got 800x600 on an external monitor.
QVision is said to be upward compatible with AVGA
so that should not be a problem.
The driver assumes 512 Kb of video memory which
clearly is insufficient for 1024x768 resolution.
You could override this with your Xconfig.
But I really don't know how to get any other clock
frequencies. So your refresh rate would be rather low.

Subject: Xview3L4 update?
Date: 13 Aug 93 05:25:16 GMT

Is there an update to the xview3l4 package from tsx and sunsite??  I really
like the package and the demos, documentation etc.  Sun has had a newer
release but It's not ported to linux as far as I know.  Anyone working on it?
Can I help?  Want to work on it as a project?

I tried to install it and it worked well but I couldn't compile any of the
UIT examples.  (Yes OPENWINHOME was set)

I managed to fix most of the Makefiles, but they had obvious errors like:

C++FLAGS = -I$(OPENWINHOME)/include/uit -I$(UITHOME)/include/c++ \
          -L$(UITHOME)/lib  -L$(OPENWINHOME)/lib

Why -L stuff in the C++flags instead of just includes???

display: display.o
        g++ $(CCFLAGS) -o display $(OBJECTS) $(LDLIBS)

display.o: display.cc

Notice there is no line to tell the makefile to compile display.cc with the
C++FLAGS arguments?

So when you compile you get:
$ make
g++    -c display.cc -o display.o
display.cc:10: BaseWindow.h: No such file or directory

The include file isn't found because $(G++FLAGS) wasn't used.

Is there something I don't understand here?

This isn't the only case it seems EVERY makefile is broken, and some
of them are machine generated which complicates fixing them.

Any hints, pointers towards newer packages, etc appreciated, I'll post
results if necessary.

ncurses is supposed to be compatible with SYSVR4 curses. Most uptodate OS's
have one but it is usually buried in the cellar (/usr/5lib). ncurses is by
no means tied to the 386, only POSIX, ANSI C, and SYSRV4 definition of curses.
the upcoming version 1.8 (yes up from 0.7.3) has support for Linux, 386BSD,
BSDI, ULTRIX, HP/UX, and SunOS.

Subject: SLS 1.03 and SMC Elite
Date: Fri, 13 Aug 1993 06:22:10 GMT

Dear Linuxers,

I have got two big problems with SLS 1.03. 

1. Installing via NFS:
I did not get the install via NFS working. 
The error issued is something like
"clnt...RPC mapping failed" 
This seems to be a problem encountered by 
others too. Maybe there is a solution ?



2. Getting SMC Elite (8bit) working
Even if I get it installed (using the DOS HD) there
are still problems with networking:

        a. With the given zImage, e.g. ping correctly
           replies to other hosts, but if invoked under
           linux, it never receives anything from anywhere..
           (even with the correct network settings in all
            the varios /etc/files)


        b. After recompiling the kernel (just skipping all
           the not needed SCSI, Soundcard, etc. stuff),
           during execution of the rc.net, the error 
           SIOCADDRT is reported (I assume it comes from
           the invocations of route in the rc.net). The
           network in this case remains unreachable. :-((


Any help would be appreciated


        Thanks

                Michael

Date: Thu, 12 Aug 1993 16:42:54 GMT


I  have a net-2 problem.  I can ping my machine, try to telnet out and
in to no success.  Telnetting in gives tells me I connected to my
machine, gives me the escape character but just stalls there.  Pinging
to my box works fine, pinging to an outsider times out.  Pinging to myself
gives a network unreachable error.  When my machine runs ifconfig at
boottime, I get a message about the usage of ifconfig, I hope this is
normal.  In my /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 I have something like

/etc/ifconfig eth0 ${IPADDR} netmask ${NETMASK} broadcast ${BROADCAST}

Telnetting to loopback does not work.  So what would cause me to be able
to try to telnet out but get a network unreachable for trying to telnet
to myself?

I am using Linux .99-10, running on a 486DX-33 with 4Megs ram, 6 Swap,
an adaptec 1542B at I/O 330 and IRQ5 I believe, and a SMC Elite 16 Plus
( WD 8013 ), at I/O 280 and IRQ10.  The changes were made to the 
configuration files as specified before recompiling the kernel.
Pinging to the box says I am on the net.  Trying to telnet to the box
causes problems on my box, once caused my box to lock up.  Telnetting
out just times out.

Subject: Mac only a toy!
Date: Thu, 12 Aug 1993 22:01:01 GMT


Hello Mac and PC Clone Worlds,

I am a PC Clone user due to my intense interest in the UNIX operating
system thus causing me to use my 486 Clone to run Linux.  Unlike other
PC bigots, I do realize the Macintosh is pretty much like a Lexus
if it where a car, where our Clone PC's would be a Chevy (not Vette either).
I can appreciate the Mac interface (even though I like command lines
at my fingertips), the Bus Design (Nubus, Nubus90), and just
the overall aestatics of the machine itself.  The consistency
across most applications is most pleasing, along with the Finder.

I am a CS major.  And to any of my friends who want to run MS Word at
home, spreadsheats, etc.  I always recommend a Macintosh, because
I always get tired of answering peoples questions 100x, telling people
they have to reboot _when_ Windoze locks, and how to do this and that
in MS DOG, why they need to add this to config.sys, what autoexec.bat
is.

This weekend I had the opportunity to be in the presence of one of my
friends I tend to watch sports with.  He was replacing his 386sx clone
and going to a new computer.  He was talking of getting a powerful 486
, and even mentioned the Pentium.  (He's just one who uses wordprocessors,
mostly computer illiterate).  I said:  " you really should get a Mac",
he replied " a Mac is only a toy, I'm getting a 486 ".
Many of my other friends are hard headed also, even after I tell them
that it does not matter whether you use word 5.0 for mac or word 2.0
for PC's, that a file is a file, and the Mac is generally a better
tool for the job they want to do.  They all want 486's.
One person I talked to about getting a Mac said if they gotten a Mac
they wouldn't learn anything about computers.  As if typing a line
in config.sys is learning about computers.  As if ctl-alt-del is
learning about computers.  As if using Windog on top of DOG is learning
about computers.  The Macintosh is what these people need, they need
to worry more about doing their job, then worrying about things they don't
need to know.  The can insert a new video board in their Mac, have it
automatically configure and work, even network their Macs with ease. They won't
need to learn addresses, IRQ's, etc. because they really don't need to know it.
If they want to learn it fine, but that should be at their own perogative
and not a requirement.

We know the reason why many use the PC-Clone at home:  big business buy
PC-Clones, Games are made for PC-Clones.  People want to use the apps
at home that they do at work, or that the business world uses.  Business
world runs these apps on PC-Clones, so people want the PC-Clone.
I'm sure it's been reiterated over and over, but Apple needs to really
try to penetrate the business world.  Convince the business world that
their productivity can be increased by using this Machine, that this
Machine is reliable with a OS that is consistant and clear, that
it is easily configurable, and that a file is a file.  That yes you can
have your PC, and your Mac, and it doesn't really matter whether you
run Word on your Mac or PC.  Then software developers need to do the
same thing.

My suggestion for the PPC is to avoid windog's, and go with system 7+
with maybe a UNIX command line, maybe have dogs compat just to get people
over to the machine to run a real OS.

Just my suggestions.

Don't flame me either, I do like my 486 and LOVE Linux.  But DOG and WINDOG
can go, I don't need to play no games either.  I'd rather make my own,
(come on LINUX guys Lets do it).  But I would really Love to add a Mac
to my family, maybe a Powerbook, maybe a Mac II with an '040 accelator in
it, or maybe one of the Centris's.

There now termcap eqivalents to most terminfo capabilities, but like you said
a bit too late. If one doesn't mind the lack of functionality of bsd curses
by all means continue using it.

        To be completely correct, I should say there is no "burst" mode
        for the DMA, but it does take over the BUS (hence CPU can't do
        anything).  The period for this (refresh )is no longer that the
        time needed to read 64k of memory by the DMA.  Although a scheme
        could be devise where only the address lines get strobe, and
        this might be enough.   I don't know enough about RAM and the
        refresh to tell you anything more than I've read.  Hence, why
        I am posting these messages to see if someone else has more
        information.

I now suspect the BIOS.

(BTW, I tried different cables too)

Here's my BIOS info. Anyone else got the same and had a1 boot?

EC&T-1155-030389-K8

msd.exe gives the BIOS ID bytes as: FC 01 00

Any help appreciated.

         More annoyance on the problem with the DMA/RAM refresh
         ------------------------------------------------------
 
                Some facts from:
                 "IBM Personal Computer Troubleshooting and & Repair
                  for the IBM PC, PC/XT, and PC AT"
                  by Robert C. Benner
 
        p.51    Refresh begins when the OUT1 signal from the
                8254, programmable interval timer (U34),
                sends a DMA request signal (DRQ0) to the
                DMA controller (U35).
 
        p.106   DMA RAM refresh occurs on timer channel 1
                66,287 time per second causing a Refresh
                signal every 15 microseconds.
 
        p.111   Each DMA request line is an individual asynchronous
                channel input used by the peripheral circuitry to
                obtain DMA service.
 
        p.121   Refresh is accomplished by performing a memory-access
                cycle at each of the row addresses within a bank of
                RAM every two to four milliseconds.
                (1000 microseconds in a millisecond.)
 
 
        The new FDC driver is reading a 1.44 meg diskette in
        about 1 minute 30 seconds.  There are 2880 sectors on
        a diskette of this size.  2880 divided by 90 seconds
        is 302 sectors per second.    66,287  divided by 302
        is approx. 219.5 refreshs per sector transfer.
 
        The lower harmonics for 66,287 are
 
        index   refreshes       in time period (fraction of sec.)
        1.      33,143 +-1      .5
        2.      16,571 +-1      .25
        3.       8,281 +-1      .125
        4.       4,140 +-1      .0625
        5.       2,070 +-1      .03125
        6.       1,035          .015625
        7.         517 +-1      .0078125
        8.         258 +-1      .00390625
        9.         129          .001953125
        10.         64 +-1       [good reason to stop occured]
 
        A sector transfer occurs every .195361 +-.0000001
 
                I reported 5 to 10 failures in a transfer.
        This equates to 1 DMA failure for every 288 sectors for
        10 as the total, and 1 in 576 for 5 failures total.
 
 
                At index 9 you will see .001953125, which is
        very close to 1/100 of the time between sector transfers.
        So 1 in 12,900 +- 10% RAM refresh can collide with a
        FDC transfer.  The worst failures I've seen to date occur
        1 in 300 sectors.  The numbers say that I should get 1 in
        100 failures approx. from a collision on DMA requests.
 
                Is this in line with the facts?
 
                Note I did not consider code execution time, sector
        to sector dead time, head seeking latency, or any of the
        other time variables.
 
        The major variables are:
 
                1)  RAM refresh cycle time
                2)  Context switch time
                2)  FDC sector transfer time
                3)  FDC code execution time
                4)  FDC track seek time
                5)  FDC sector start time
                    (time before actual sector starts)
 
                6)  any device with a harmonic of .1935
 
 
                If this is really a problem can it be solved?
 
                Yes, I think so but, the "isa_dmaxxx()" calls will
        need a failure mode.  BTW, this is an improvement to the
        RTC (Real-Time Control).
 
                What will need to happen is the 8254 (PIT) needs to
        be inspected for the time remaining to the DRQ (DMA ReQuest).
        This can be done via the "Counter Latch" command.
        An available duty cycle of 90% seems to be appropriate, but
        a smaller duty cycle will need to investigated if this is
        not enough time to avoid the collision.
 
                Calculations for a better time might be had from
        Bruce Evans in Australia, since he is using arm scheduling
        for the FDC driver on Linux.  Arm scheduling, by him, seems to
        be a description of an optimization technique using
        schewing(sp?) or interleaving.  He should know approx. how
        much time each sector transfer takes and how long from the end
        of a read till the start of the next read.
 
        CONCLUSION: The available duty cycle from the DMA should be
                    about 3 times the amount of time for each sector
                    transfer _and_ the counter time remaining should be
                    no less the time needed for a complete sector read.
 
            NOTE:   The read-a-track may have to have a disable option
                    for 386bsd.
 
 
                Last thing if this does not work, I have not Idea One
        on what to do next and will drop this investigation.
 
 
        What follows can in just before posting this.

You probably already know this, but:
 
There used to be a bug in some of AMD's DMA controllers. I don't remember what
the bug was (I knew what it was about 3 years ago). Fastback used to check
for the bug when you installed it; I don't know whether it still does.

Subject: SLS 1.03 and route
Date: Fri, 13 Aug 1993 07:06:12 GMT

I am attempting to get SLIP up and running on my machine, so I 
have attempted to merge the document for NET-2 with the setup 
supplied with SLS 1.03, and the following happens:

rc.inet1 reads:
#!/bin/sh
#
HOSTNAME=`hostname`    #  tesla.nas.nasa.gov
/etc/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
/etc/route add 127.0.0.1
#
# end

When /etc/route is executed I get the message "SIOCADDRT: Invalid argument".
What is the scoop with this and how to I remedy it?  I think it would be
at least nifty to be able to ping myself or telnet to myself.

thanks again for your net.support
