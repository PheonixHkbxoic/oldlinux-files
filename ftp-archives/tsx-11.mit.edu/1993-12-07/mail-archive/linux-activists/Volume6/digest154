I believe that tsx-11 allows you to do a 'tar SLS' (in the /pub/linux/packages 
dir) and get the whole 36 Megs as one big tar file.  Maybe it was sunsite. 
I did it once about 8 months ago, before bode.ee.ualberta.ca started
mirroring SLS.

I've been trying to work on a rahter interesting problem:

Say I've got 10 386's with only a single high-desnsity floppy drive, and I
wanted to nfs mount an entire operational filesytem from a single linux
server, would it be possible with a single bootdisk? (Basically I'd like
to run everything on the pcs via nfs.) Is this possible? 
Each machine has it's own ip address si I'd like to have all the abilities,
like telnet, ftp, etc. I guess it'd be like these computers were dumb
terminals, but not so dumb, as they would do all the work instead of the
single server doing everything. Has anyone had any success with such a
situation? Someone posted long ago about diskless nfs booting, if they
could respond would be much appreciated as I've lost their post.

OK, Now, Hook up 2 FAST SCSI disks and 2 IDE Disks and run the same test
simultaneously on both disks.

Next, Run a background job that EATS the CPU at the same time with only

I tried posting to comp.os.linux.help but got no response. Sorry
to keep this channel open. It would seem that the dosemu0.49 should
run out of the box since the /etc/dosemu/config file is interpreted
at run time. Not so. After loading up diskimage I get a never ending
sequence of:

SYSCALL ERROR:38 function not implemented in file mutex.c
expr=semop(sem,semoa,1)
line 52 or 79.

I tried several tweaks of the config file and I do get the time/date
prompt but it ends there.


When I do compile dosemu0.49 by: make config, make dep, make install
I get an ld error since the lib ipc can't be found( this is SLS 1.03, the
latest on tsx-11). I read an earlier post that I should just drop the
-lipc from the ld statement, and the make install goes through. However
the emulator then just hangs, as if it were waiting for input and never
sees the keyboard.

I got the earlier version of dosemu to run, but this one seems to be
a giant step backward. Any clues for the clueless?

It's definitely possible. I mean the distribution floppies can mount and run 
programs via NFS. I also read that NFS has been fixed so that shared libs
can be done.  So build a boot/root floppy (or use a distribution one)
and mount /usr and /etc from the server on boot. You may want to to set up
a link from /etc and /usr to somewhere local on the floppy.

A couple of issues:

- Swap. You think HD is slow wait til you try over the network.
- Root on floppy. Very slow. You could put it an a RAMDISK.

How much memory do these 386's have? You'd probably not want to have to 
swap and you would like to have a RAMDISK root. 8 is good, 12 is better,
16 or better is best. But for the cost of 16 Meg of memory you can just
buy a 340 (or much smaller) Meg HD.

It may be usable with 8 Meg of memory and a RAMdisk root. But I'd test it
first.

Hope this helps,

Get my networking root/bott disks from ftp.robots.ox.ac.uk in
/pub/linux/ox-usr/rootdisk. This is exactly what I have used it for.
Currently I've given up with putting the kernel on the root disk and use a
separate boot and root disks. If you remove scsi, math emu, support for all
but one ethernet card etc, then you can still fit a kernel and all the
networking binaries you need on a single floppy.  

Previous to linux-0.99.pl12 the lack of nfs mmap made this pretty pointless,
but with my nfs mmap code in pl12, you can indeed run X on a networked PC
without touching the hard disk. With the kenel removed there is even enought
/tmp space to use gcc (but with $TMPDIR on nfs it is faster).

The SLS boot disk (a1.3) locks up with my system when I have my
network cards installed (a ne2000 compatible).  The version of the
boot disk is the one current as of this message.  

The point at which this locks up is the 8390.c test.  I remember
reading a while back about this problem, and the fix was to 
remove the card, recompile linux with only the ne2000 support.
However, I don't like this, I was hoping not to have to rip
my machines apart when installing linux-SLS for the first time.
Any better ways, like is there a real fix out there yet?
(Oh to clarify, yet removing the card recompiling and does
solve the problem).

This seems to say that your kernel doesn't have SYSV IPC support
compiled in.  What version of the kernel do you run?  I recommend
0.99pl12 *with* SYSV IPC enabled.

I've had no replies to my email, in fact the last communication I
had from them was a couple of months ago asking for contact details so 
that I could be listed in the 1.0.x documentation as a distributor.  

I have not sold any Yggdrasil CDs since running out of stock around
six weeks ago, and the people who have ordered since then have been
advised that I'm not supplying until a new version arrives.

According to Walnut Creek, the new Yggdrasil CD is expected at the
end of this month, but "be prepared to be flexible about it."

Date: Sun, 22 Aug 1993 01:16:47 GMT


Ok, here's the long and the short of it: I have a crappy old
40Mb MFM drive onto which I have already installed a previous
version of linux.  LILO was able to make the drive bootable
at one point but recently I tried again with the pl 12 kernel 
and LILO was no longer able to boot everything up.

At first, LILO stalled after printing out "LIL-", then after
some hacking around, it printed out just "LI".  Yuck.  So
this README tells me that in both cases, the disk geometry
is wrong.  It also says something about "moving" boot.b and
map, which I don't understand.

(BTW, where can I find the technical overview as mentioned 
in the LILO README?)

Anyway, the important thing here is that on line 643, there
is talk of a DOS program called DPARAM.COM.  I tried looking
for this program but was unsuccessful.  If anyone could
provide me with an ftp site and directory, I'd be grateful.

Could it also be possible that LILO is not getting the correct
disk geometry from the kernel?  Considering this is an MFM
drive and all...

Agreed, but normally the existence of a cache gives you numbers that are

Listen, the point here is simply that some people are wondering if the
SCSI performance is all the way up there *or* if it could be improved.
Natually they are comparing notes. The problem is only that nobody
can agree on the correct way to measure performance. Iozone is certainly
not perfect, but gives you a relative measure if compiled correctly.

Again, nobody (I hope!-) is whining. I am subjectively happy with the
disk performance, but after having seen some people with IDE presenting
numbers that beat the sh*t out of my setup with an Adaptec SCSI controller
I am certainly motivated to look into the matter a bit further.

On my system (486/33, WD1007V ESDI controller, one 10 Mb/sec (35 sectors/
track) drive formatted with 1:1 interleave, another 15 Mb/sec (54 sectors/
track) drive formatted with 2:1 interleave), the standard Minix fs is much
faster under Linux than a highly tuned ufs under 386BSD (tuning actually
didn't help because of deficiencies in the driver and slowness of the
controller).  The only real advantage that ufs might have is less
fragmentation over time.  However, the standard 386BSD wd driver can't
keep up for writes of contiguous sectors, so the default values of 4 msec
for 'rotdelay' and 1 for 'maxconfig' have to be used to get decent
performance for writes, so all files are laid out with discontiguous
blocks.  In effect they suffer from 2:1 fragmentation immediately.

ufs enforces an implicit fsync on directory operations.  This makes
creation and deletion of files 10-20 times slower than under Linux
and negates many of the advantages of having a disk cache.

Standard 386BSD suffers from a tiny disk cache.  It can easily be 50
times smaller than the Linux cache on Linux systems with plenty of
memory.

I've read that the log-structured file system turned out to be not so
fast compared with ffs when one old bug and some implementation details
in ffs were fixed.  Both the bug and the implementation details have
to do with contiguous blocks not being handled right and/or used
enough.  The reason that the symple Linux fs's work so well is that
they only attempt a simple contiguous layout, and some Linux drivers
can handle contiguous blocks at full speed.  The reason that some
people say that the simple Linux fs's are slow may be that some Linux
drivers cannot handle contiguous blocks at full speed :-).

I have numbers for iozone on unfragmented file systems.  Linux is 1.5
to 2 times faster because there is no 2:1 hit from the layout policy.  
This is not very interesting.

I've been thinking about writing some simple real-world tests.  Perhaps
something involving unzipping untarring and deleting multiple copies of
the gcc sources many times.

The 3c509 driver is still in the alpha stage.

The 3c503 driver has been working for about nine months.  It's not the
fastest ethercard around, but it's from 3Com.

The 3c501 driver once worked (for about three minutes), but was never
released.  The hardware is too brain-damaged to use on a modern network.
Analog: you wouldn't expect Linux to run on an 8088...why expect
networking to work with an 8088-era ethercard?

Or you could go into /linux/kernel/chr_drv/serial.c and add this to the code:
    #define CONFIG_AUTO_IRQ

This will make the kernel automaticaly detect the IRQ of the serial ports.
