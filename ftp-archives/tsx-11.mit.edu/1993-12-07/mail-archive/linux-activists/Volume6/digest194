NO, LINUX WILL *NEVER* SUPPORT QIC36 !!!!!!

But Linux just might support the controller you have to plug into the PC
that supports QIC36.

There are controllers available that look like a QIC02 interface to Linux.
The controller has a QIC36 interface connector to the drive side. I have
been using that for quite some time under Linux. 

So, buy the Wangtek (good drive if you get it cheap !) and get either
an external SCSI to QIC36 controller and use the setup with your
SCSI controller or get a (hopefully supported) QIC02 controller that
works with your drive. 

In any case: YOU NEED A CONTROLLER with your drive.

   I have the same Problem here. The Serial driver did not found the port
   tty03. If I configure the hardware of the modem to use tty02 the serial
   driver detects the port and everything works ok.
   But if the modem is configured to use com4 it is not found.

Both of you are probably using a Cheap Internal Modem which doesn't use
a true National Semiconductor UART --- it's using a cheap ripoff UART
instead.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of hardware manufacturers
around who have done this, so the serial driver is written to try very
hard to find a modem, even if it isn't using a fully compatible UART
chip.

The problem is that the I/O address for COM4 conflict with the I/O
address for the 8514/a video boards, and the "try really hard" method
for detecting serial boards screws up people who have 8514/a video
boards.  So the serial driver only tries the less-intrusive methods of
detecting the UART, which don't work on the above-mentioned Cheap
Internal Modems.  (Earlier versions of the kernel, such as what SLS is
using, do try really hard even on COM4 --- but that was before owners of
systems with 8514/a video boards started complainingh.)

The solution?  Use the setserial command.  This will allow you to
configure your modem on COM4, even though the bootup detection code
couldn't detect it.

Right!  At home I run SCO Xenix on a 386 box that does just fine.  On my
desk at work is an Intel 310 (a 286 machine with Multibus) that runs a bit
slower with Intel's version of Xenix 286.  It's slow mainly because the
disk is slow.

Memory sure makes a difference.  When I had only 4 MB at home, the LPI
FORTRAN compiler thrashed the disk some, and my big programs thrashed it
a LOT.  With 8 MB, there's still some swapping -- still more memory would be
still better.

Last year I was working on a group of 6 or 8 people on a Sun, and things
improved greatly when we went from 32 to 64 MB on that machine.  Everybody
there was using X and running 8 or 10 windows at once.

I think your formula is exactly right: use LOTS of memory, and fast disks.
Don't worry about the other stuff.

I have a 100 meg hard drive that I totally dedicated to linux yesterday
but when I paritioned it, I received a message that said I couldn't use
some 85000 blocks of this partition.  I found the message in the FAQ list
and it said to ignore it.

Anyway, all I have on there is the SLS a1-a4 disks and maybe another 2 meg
of stuff I've collected in the last 24 hours.  Not even near 100 meg (we're
talking light years away from 100 meg).  

I was d/ling something to my terminal (because DIP isn't working yet ?!@#)
and I ran out of space.  df /dev/hdb showed:

Filesystem      1024-blocks     Used    Avail   Capacity  Mounted on
/dev/hdb        109823          109474    0        100% 

After running fdisk /dev/hdb and displaying the partition table I have:

/dev/hdb1         1       1     832    109823+  83    Linux Extfs

I think I'm going to compile my own FAQ for newbies from a newbie perspective
because I have a new problem about every hour :)

I am curious on how you make a bootable RAM version of Linux.  I know it
can be done because the SLS boot disk does this.  It seems to copy the floppy
to RAM disk device when booting the kernel which in turn frees up the floppy.
Is the SLS boot disk build source on the net?  If anyone can answer these
questions, please send me email.  Thanks.

it keeps giving me errors.

Another thing: I only have half of my man pages.  I can't even man fdisk
because it isn't there.  Isn't the SLS a-disk distribution putting these

        There are two options: LILO and bootlin.  I suggest bootlin, because
        it does not mess w/ the boot sector on your dos drive.  I can

I have a bj-200 and I have it set up to print postscript and such and it works
fine. (I just use ghostscript to make the output file, and then cat it to 
/dev/lp1 most of the time.)

I have a problem thoguh, I recently tried to print a rather large (64) page
postscript file. There WAS enough room on the HD for the whole output file.
When it finished I did a "cat /tmp/out > /dev/lp1" but the output was mushed
in a weird way. It was "scattered" all over in the horizontal direction.
The text was unreadable. I took the same postscript file and printed it on a 
NeXT with no problems.

any ideas?

I am using the bj10e mode at 360x360, and I successfully printed two of the 
"example" ps files right after this happened, and they worked fine. (then
I tried the big one again, and it was the same)

anyone else had this problem

Well, since people reading this thread seem to be knowledgeable about
printer setups I was wondering if anyone would mind critiquing this.
It works but I just want to make sure that I'm not missing anything.

Oh, also, one BIG question, running 0.99PL12 I have a problem that if I
boot with the printer on (a Deskjet Plus) the printer locks up and
refuses to respond to any panel commands (even reset) and when trying
to print something to it Linux responds with "lp0 off-line".  I then
have to power the printer off, write something to the printer (e.g.
echo "" > /dev/lp0) and then everything works fine.  If the printer is
off when I boot it works as well.  The printer used to work under
0.99PL10 (and 9) but was recognized as lp1 then.  Has anyone
encountered this problem?  And does anyone have a fix?  It's not a
major problem, just annyoing.

The machine "ryouga" has the following printcap
        lp|akane:sh:rm=akane:sd=/var/spool/lpd:mx#0:

The machine "akane" has the following printcap
        lp:sh:lp=/dev/lp0:sd=/usr/spool/lp:mx#0:if=/usr/lib/lpf:

and /usr/lib/lpf contains

#!/usr/local/bin/perl

# They want us to pass the thing through unmodified (with control chars...)
# Assuming -c is first argument, probably not a good assumption but that's
# what the stuff in the printing-FAQ assumes.
if ($#ARGV && @ARGV[0] eq "-c") {
    print <STDIN>;
    print "\f";
    exit 0;
}

# See if we want to do postscipt magic
sysread(STDIN, $buf, 2);
