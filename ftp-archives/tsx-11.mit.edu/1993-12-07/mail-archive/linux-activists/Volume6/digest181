Date: Sun, 29 Aug 1993 00:05:25 GMT

        Hello, 
                I have been a linux lover for about 6 months now, running
        on a 386/25. I recently puchased a 486/66 with 4 meg of RAM, and
        wanted, of course, to use Linux as my primary OS. Anyrate, now 
        when I boot (off the SLS a1.3 disk) I get to the video selection 
        part and hit space, but nothing happens (I have waited for 10-15 
        minutes with nothing happening)...

        I have read that I might need to slow down my machine, and tried
        to boot without the turbo off, but to no avail. I heard that some
        higher speed computers have trouble with Linux. Anything you
        guys might think of might help... Thanks!!!!

This is because the xdm you are running does not have shadow password
support, and for some reason your passwd file has blank password
fields when it really shouldn't, even when your system uses shadow
passwords, for precisely this reason.

First, put * in the password fields in your /etc/passwd file
which will prevent this problem with any other programs not
compiled with shadow password support.

Second, get xdm-shadow-bin.tar.z from sunsite:/pub/Linux/X11/xutils
or your favorite other spot.

YIKES!  I don't think you want to copy the libraries around, why not just

TR>space will mostly be freed as processes need it.

I don't think I'm confused, the difference continues to widen.  Let's
take my latest numbers...

                     Right after a fresh boot
             total       used       free     shared    buffers
Mem:         15196       2104      13092       1368        776
Swap:        16380          0      16380


          After 24 hours of running with moderate activity
             total       used       free     shared    buffers
Mem:         15196       6884       8312       1084       3516
Swap:        16380          0      16380

The way I see it, used and free should add up to the total, and they
do.  Shared is just a count of how much is shared I guess, but it's
included in the used count, as is buffers.  If I subtract buffers from
used right after booting, I get 1328, however after running 24 hours
with X and networking active, I do the same calculation and get 3368.
If you can explain the disparity in the numbers, please do, because I'd
sure like to understand where the memory is apparently going... :-)
If I'm missing something basic, I'm all ears, but it sure looks to me
as if memory is evaporating.  BTW, the free is run each time with nothing
but a single virtual console active and logged in, and a ps each time
shows the same tasks with the same memory allocation, so I'd expect the
memory used exclusive of buffers to be similar, certainly not 2 megabytes
different!

The real problem is that the soft link /dev/swap, which shouldn't be there,
and has subsequently been removed, was being used erroneously in the 
dd or mkswap command.  Some (well meaning I'm sure) soul posted posted or 
mailed these bad instructions to the poor individual involved.  I suppose
mkswap could be enhanced to preform the "dd" stage automatically, if
a block device was not supplied, and such instructions added to the 
mkswap manpage.  Then again, the FAQ does describe the correct procedure.

   You need to include stdlib.h so that you get the correct prototype for
atof.  As it is now, atof is implicitly defined to return an int.

I will also buy a caching controller and graphics accelerator cards with

So which will give the best performance DX50 or DX266?
Or should I choose a 33/40 DX that is within the VLB specifications?

I know Linux at the moment doesn't support many accelerator cards.
I would like to know what cards are to be AVOIDED, and which cards are to be
implemented in the future.

Is there any performance comparisons between these various cards anywhere?

I will buying the machine in the UK and would like to hear from anyone who has

Subject: Re: Problems with PAS-16
Date: 29 Aug 1993 04:12:20 GMT

This happens on my machine when the bus gets too loaded down (I have an ISA video card,
and this often happens even when CPU load figures are rather low).  Playing music on the
PAS-16 often uses more bus bandwidth than doing so on the SB because the PAS16 supports
stereo sound up to 44.1kHZ, with 16-bit samples, while the Soundblaster supports only
mono 8-bit sound at (I think) 20kHZ or so.  The 16-bit bus of the PAS16 helps some, but
can't compensate completely for the increased data xfer rate.

If your BIOS/chipset supports it, try increasing the AT bus clock rate as much as your
system can tolerate; I'm running mine at 13.5MHz or so with no problems, but I did have
to remove an older XT multi-IO card that couldn't tolerate the faster speed (it would
lock up the computer on boot).  Many BIOSes have an entry in the setup program where
you can specify the factor by which to divide the CPU clock to get the bus clock; set
this number as low as possible (i.e. 33MHz / 2.5 instead of 33MHz / 4).  For an AMI
486 BIOS, this option should be in the "advanced chipset configuration" page.  You might
also be able to set this through a jumper on your motherboard.

If you're playing MOD files, also use 8-bit sampling instead of 16-bit (it makes
negligible difference, since the original Amiga chipset had only 8-bit sound).  Switching
to monaural mode or decreasing the sample rate will also help (at the cost of poorer
sound quality).

This usually only happens in X-windows because of the increased video-related bus traffic
when in graphics mode... switching to a VLB video card should fix this problem, though
I've never tried it.  (I'm using a PAS16 on a 486-33 w/ISA video).

: Hi,

: i have tried successfully two ways to use OS/2 and Linux
: together. But it seems to be unpossible to boot Linux from
: the OS/2 Bootmanager directly. So try one of the following
: two ways.

No, it's not impossible to directly start Linux from the Boot Manager.  Here's
my setup and a THIRD way:

   Device Boot  Begin   Start     End  Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hda1           7       7     836  161850    7  OS/2 HPFS
/dev/hda2   *       1       1       6    1157    a  OPUS
/dev/hda3         837     837     916   15600   16  Unknown
/dev/hda4         917     917     918     390   81  Linux/MINIX

/dev/hda2 is the Boot Manager.  Note that the Linux partition is only one
cylinder in length as I only use the boot sector as the actual partition re-
sides on the other drive on my primary controller.

Here's  my /etc/lilo/config file for my system:

boot = /dev/hda4
install = /etc/lilo/boot.b
delay = 100
compact
image = /etc/images/Image
        label = linux
        root = /dev/hdb1
        vga=normal
image = /usr/src/linux/Image
        label = linux-test
        root = /dev/hdb1
        vga = normal

What you do is fill in the blanks as above, where "boot" is where you want to
put the boot sector, in my case, it's the one-cylinder partition.  You CAN
put it in the boot sector of your actual Linux partition, however.
Fill in all the other blanks as appropriate.  Use OS/2's FDISK to add the
Linux partition to your Boot Manager list.  Then, lay down the boot sector un-
der Linux, but NOT AS THE MBR!  You will foul up OS/2's MBR, or more appro-
priately, whatever MBR which happens to be there if it's not LILO's.  You need
to relay that MBR down using something like MS-LOSS's FDISK /MBR option.

: First: Install OS/2 with Bootmanager and then install LILO.
: Use LILO to start Linux or the OS/2 Bootmanager. Then use
: the Bootmanager to start OS/2 or DOS.

You do not need to put the LILO boot sector as the MBR; you can use the boot
record of ANY of your Linux partitions, even your swap partitions. Werner
is a very bright guy; he designed a VERY good package, and documented it well.
Read the docs after I printed them once, and it shows the thought he put into
designing LILO.  Hats off to you, Werner!

: Second: Install OS/2 and Linux and use LILO to boot OS/2,
: DOS, or Linux. Both ways worked without any problems. 

This way will work also, especially if you want to boot
OS/2 from the second hard disk of your system; the docs/
READMEs give it in more detail.

: To my mind the second way is preferable, because you only
: need one bootmanager to start. No switching through LILO
: and the OS/2 Bootmanager.

Not always true.  What if you change your mind?  However, another idea you can
use is that you can use LILO's multiimage capacity to test kernels under de-
velopment.  Just choose Linux from the Boot Mananger menu, then use LILO to
boot the appropriate Linux image you want to run.  This way, if you found that
you fucked up on one of your patches and kills the system, you have a backup
image to fall back upon.  My LILO configuration file says as much.

: Give it a try. If you encounter problems send me an email

Subject: bad spots
Date: Sun, 29 Aug 1993 04:47:05 GMT


Hi, folks,

        I have yet another silly puzzle.  I use Linux to write to a MSDOS
file system to back-up stuff (using tar and gzip).  In one instance, I
hit a disk error indicating sread failed on dev 0340 sector 352745.  I
leave the file being produced to hold down sector 352745 as a bad spot.
Unfortunately, the file already has a size of 23 Megs by this time.  I
figure the bad spot is probably only a few Ks.  Since the bad sector is
effectively marked, I can create other backup files with no problem.

        So I go to DOS and run the Norton utilities.  The "Disk Tools"
have a capability to manually mark bad clusters.  I use the "Disk Editor"
to examine the disk and sure enough sector 352745, in cluster 44033 is
bad (the editor warns that perhaps the drive was not formatted when I hit
this sector).  Then, when I go to "Disk Tools" to mark the cluster, the
tool indicates that the cluster had ALREADY been marked bad!!!

        First, if indeed DOS had marked the sector bad, why would Linux
use it?  Doesn't Linux use the same badspot marking mechanism as DOS?
Second, regardless of how DOS and Linux mark spots, how can I make the 23
Meg file smaller so that only sector 352745 would be held down by a file
I'll make inaccessible via permissions?  I would suppose that the sector
would be towards the end of the 23 Megs, since that's when the backup
fails.  I'd hate to waste 23 Megs just so that I don't keep banging head
against this sector.  Interestingly enough, though, I seem to be able to
"dd if=badfile of=/dev/null" without any errors.  How come?

        Thanks for any suggestions in advance.

Make sure that you're pointing to the right image, and also make sure that the
image either knows or the LILO configuration knows where your root parition
lives.  Note the following:

boot = /dev/hda4
install = /etc/lilo/boot.b
delay = 100
compact
image = /etc/images/Image
        label = linux
        root = /dev/hdb1
        vga=normal
image = /usr/src/linux/Image
        label = linux-test
        root = /dev/hdb1
        vga = normal

"boot" is where my LILO boot sector resides.  Wherever "root" occurs, that
tells LILO to load the kernel and mount "root" as "/".  To make doubly sure,
you could rdev your kernel to point to your root partition.

: Thanks.

Anytime.

: PS I changed partition's ID to "Linux Ext", that is my linux's root partition.

That won't help.  You could use ANY ID, just make sure that it's one that MS-
DOS or OS/2 would recognize.  In fact, you could use 0x81 as your partition ID
even if your partition is an extended FS one.

Since you mention SLS, when Lilo comes up press the shift to get to the lilo 
prompt. Once there give the "kernel" to boot with, ie floppy, ramdisk etc.
Now also add something to the effect vga=normal. THat should skip the 
video mode question and should boot the kernel up. This happened to my machine
when I got it. Some people suspect non-compatable keyboard controllers.
