Right now (XFree86 1.3) you can run X mono.  Wait till XFree86 2.0
(hopefully end of October) and there should be support for the OAK
067/077 according to the announcement.

If you're worried about permanently allocating 32k of memory instead
of only when the driver is open, then, by all means, just allocate it
when the driver is opened and free it upon close.

Date: 2 Oct 1993 17:55:16 -0500
Reply-To: asif@crystal.demon.co.uk

I've just installed the latest version of Linux using the conventional method
of floppy disks. I have one IDE hard drive and one SCSI hard drive which is
supported by an Adaptec 1542B. What I did was to create one partition on the
IDE drive for Linux to boot up on. I then created another partition on the
SCSI drive to put the home directory onto. When I finished installing Linux
I booted up from the floppy disk which was created during the installation.
When Linux came to the point of initallizing the Adaptec 1542B the system 
just hung up and there was a message saying 

                Internal Error scsi.c 966

I've checked that the following information was correct on both my card and
the setup on my machine. [ IO:330  IRQ:10  DMA:5 ]

I have no idea what could be the problem.

Please could you mail me back at asif@crystal.demon.co.uk and not via the
newsgroups as I haven't got NEWS setup yet.

Thanks.

Subject: How to run /etc/lilo/install after kernel rebuild...
Date: 3 Oct 93 03:56:18 GMT

How do I rerun lilo so the kernel I just compiled will boot right?
I assume lilo is the problem: i compiled a new kernel and now it
goes into infinite reboots.

When I run the 'make zlilo' to compile a new kernel, it makes one, but
has trouble running lilo, saying ./lilo: No such file or directory.
Even when I run lilo install from the linux compile directory, I still
have the problem (see below) Why? Then, when I go to the /etc/lilo directory
itself, the dang thing now says it wants command line arguments. None
of this is documented: it is not in /etc/lilo/README, it is not in
LILO-FAQ. I simply need to know how to get the new kernel to
automatically boot.  On other systems, it's easy. Make new kernel,
copy over, reboot.  With lilo i have to spend half a day only to
figure out that when it is going into infinite rebooting cycles this
is a *feature*, not a flaw. Please help, anyone.

Take a closer look at the files under /usr/local/lib/smail ... especially
the 'paths' file; be sure to include both, your hostname w/o domain AND your
hostname with your domain ... see the example for details.

You also should edit the config-files for elm (elm.rc etc.) to suit your

The above should do it for _local_ mail ...

I'm currently using two 'LANcard' Ethernet Adapter (NE200 compatibles) ...
which cost me abt. 80.- DM/each - for my needs, they are fast enough; I dont'
really need those fancy WD80x3-cards :-)

Networking with my other computer is working like a charm ... setup was easy,
connections are stable and pretty fast.

Seems like it's enough, to choose 100%-compatibles ... or ones, that are tested
within TCP/IP-networks.

Using Donald Beckers eth-driver, it is working now since 0.99pl4 (now pl12) w/o
any problems (thank you for this btw!)

Just ask your dealer, if you could try them and bring'em back in case they 
won't work - should be no problem ?

No it doesn't - while there is an audio driver for the PAS16 in the
distribution kernel, there is no SCSI driver and the SCSI side of the
card is *not* detected.

From the SCSI HOWTO : 


Section 3 : Hosts

Subsection A : Supported and Unsupported Hardware
Drivers that are being developed, but aren't publically available 
PAS-16 (based on my NCR5380 driver, works if booted with a CD in
