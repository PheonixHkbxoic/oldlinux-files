No. Because these install programs will be used for many different types
and configurations of machine their kernel takes the "kitchen sink"
approach of including all the drivers for SCSI, Ethernet, CDROM, and
the like. D_LINK is a parallel port Ethernet adapter. The probe checks
to see if the adapter is attached. The failure indicates it isn't. Life
goes on as if nothing bad had happened ;-)

Dumb question but was the floppy you inserted write protected?
If not then you probably have a problem with your drive.

Hmmm. That sounds like when you booted you picked the incorrect video option.
Usually when the video option comes up, I press space to get 80x25 EGA.

By the way. Make sure you get the latest distribution. I wouldn't advise
installing anything less that a PL12A kernel. If you install anything less
then you'll end up having to upgrade soon anyway because much of the software
compiled out there presume you have a PL11 kernel or higher, 4.4.1 (soon to
be 4.4.2 according to Linus) libraries, X 1.3, and GCC 2.4.5. So install
SLS 1.03 or Slackware's high distribution. The have all the lastest tools.

PL12 is stricter about routing. Darcy Bose's info works for PL10 and 11 only.

The missing piece in all of this is the route to add the network. I'll use
your numbers from the ifconfig:

ifconfig eth0 131.155.110.55 broadcast 131.155.110.255 netmask 255.255.255.0
route add 131.155.110.0 # this is the important one. It adds the net.
route add default gw 133.155.110.X 1
# add the loopback devices as specified.

Hope this helps,

Rev rate is 300rpm - same as MOST 5.25 drives.   HD 5's can go 360, but
usually this is 'emulated' by upping the xfer rate from 250kbit/sec to
300kbit/secs.  (That went back to the old 8" SD rate of 250kbit/sec at
360rpm for 1.2 megs).
 
The 3.5" data rate is 500kbit/sec for HD.  Remember that there are a
lot of bytes used up by track and sector numbering and a few bytes for
pad at the end of the track to make up for differing rotational speeds.

No need to try to work backward.  These are standard hardware specs.

Subject: bug in libm.a arcXXX functions
Date: Mon, 16 Aug 1993 14:46:24 GMT
Reply-To: jay@vnet.ibm.com

I've hit a bug with the arcXXX functions (e.g. acos(), atan(), etc.) in
libm.a.  The following program dumps core:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

void main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        printf("%lf\n", acos(9));
}

The cause appears to be the acos() function, which should be setting errno
to EDOM and returning.

This is with kernel .99pl12 from the latest SlackWare release.  I wasn't
sure where else to post this (is libm.a from GNU?  Should I post to
gnu.gcc.bug ?)

As far as I know, Linux does no alignment checking, for the
abovementioned reason. Therefore (and this is the more problematic
point, IMHO) it doesn't define SIGBUS.

Unless either the apps or your compiler are badly broken, you won't
notice it at all.

I'm using -DSIGBUS=SIGUNUSED as this is the number (7) that is usually
given to SIGBUS on other systems.

Hi,
   Well I finally got my network working, so I figured it was time to open a 
new can of worms. I am trying to set up my Linux box as a nameserver. We 
have a class-c network that is "inside" another class-c network. That is we 
are connected via a router to another network that is actually connected to 
the internet. They of course have a nameserver, and I have managed to get 
our NS to pass queries on to that one, but not to the outside world. 

I've 
checked the net and net-2 FAQs(most of their documentation seems to assume 
you _don't_ want to set up a namesever), referred to available man pages, 
and the like, checked C.O.L., subscribed to Linux-Activists(couldn't figure 
out haw to post tho...), tried a bunch of different configurations, and I'm 
still stumped. 

Any gurus out there have the answer to this one? Am I posting 
in the right place?  

Thanks in advance,

Stephen Hathaway

Subject: 'fstab' Problem

Configuration:   466 50MHz EISA
                 SCSI disk

Having just installed Linux (complete set - from SLS) I notice that
the 'df' command fails to read the mount table (/etc/mtab file).  It's
true - the file is empty, but surely my root partition should be mounted
at system start up and that should show at least??  If I mount something
else, like a DOS partition, 'df' then works and shows me that partition.
Why can't I see the root?  If I do a 'mount' I also see nothing.  I note
that the /etc/rc does a 'mount -a' which should be enough.

On my Sparc station, 'df' produces (extract):

Filesystem            kbytes    used   avail capacity  Mounted on
/dev/sd0a              21799    7777   11842    40%    /
venus:/usr            228998  117796   88302    57%    /usr
/dev/sd0h              94519   43246   41821    51%    /local

Which shows that my root partition ('/') is mounted on /dev/sd0a, or
the first partition of the first SCSI disk.  Why does this not show
on Linux - or is something wrong?

Any help???

Can someone confirm the following procedure for installation of the SLS:

  1.  Create a partition for Linux with DOS or OS/2 'fdisk'
  2.  Boot Linux from floppy
  3.  BEFORE installation, mkfs the partition(s)
  4.  Perform installation

Do I create the logical partitions (i.e. those in the extended partition)
with DOS or Linux 'fdisk'?  The FAQ says that partitions MUSTN'T be
created by Linux fdisk if OS/2 is going to be used.  Does this also apply
to the logical partitions?

Yes, this can be ambiguous.  A good example being the modem card I have
here.  I can find out a lot about the card, except for 'I am a modem'.
A modem driver can usually sniff out enough to guess, but I suspect some
implementations check the product ID info to be sure (if they do it at all).

Hmmm.  Just for grins, I just REMOVED the "nolinear" line from my Xconfig, and

There are no know fs-corrupting bugs in ext2fs.  There were a couple
of races in the ext2fs directory handling code in linux-0.99pl9 which
is now fixed (but xiafs and extfs still have the problem).

This sounds like a data corruption problem rather than a filesystem
bug.  I think there was at least one NFS-related memory corrupting bug
which was in 0.99pl9; I would suspect that this is where your problem
came from.

Cheers,
 Stephen.

That depends on your OS. There is a command in SCSI-2 that does this.
On SunOS 4.1.3, I use "mt -f /dev/nrst0 eom" or "mt -f /dev/nrst0 fsf 999".
GNU tar comes with a corresponding command, if you have UNix but no
mt command.

More than likely your root entry in fstab is messed up.  Some versions
of SLS 1.03 glitched on the install, and make an entry for "/root"
instead of "/".  You should fix the /etc/fstab file by hand, reboot,
and most of your problems should go away.

More explicitly, the entry should look something like:
/dev/hda2       /       ext2    defaults

Or to make groff more complete. Producing Postscript output wasn't
possible using SLS 1.01 since the DESC tables are missing.

This should be possible using sysinstall if I read the help output....

usage: sysinstall -all                * install everything: base + X11
       sysinstall -special C          * install the C set of disks
       sysinstall -install pkg.taz    * install a specific pkg file
       sysinstall -remove pkg         * uninstall a pkg
       sysinstall -disk DISKNAME      * install pkgs on disk DISKNAME
       sysinstall -instdev INSTDEV    * device to install from
        .....

There is no binary compatibility ... or am I wrong.
Why switching to another standard, if the current method is ok ?

What could be done better in Linux would be a fixperm utility/packaging.

If you think so you must be right ...

Hmm. Do you have source code?

I've written a bunch of compatibility routines which should help.
(More about these next week.) Unfortunately they depend on the C
preprocessor to do part of their dirty work...

Hi,
  Iam trying to set up Linux ( SLS distribution 1.02) to login from a serial 
port. Ussing the information in the FAQ to set a getty up on /dev/ttys1 I
get the login that should be on the serial line comming up as a secound login
on screen1. What am I doing wrong ? I would very much appreciate hearing from 
any one who could supply me details on how to do this properly.
Best Regards
