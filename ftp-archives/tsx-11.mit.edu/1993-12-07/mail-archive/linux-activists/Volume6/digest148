Somebody on the net gave me a tip about a book, believe it was on
i386 assembly language programming, but said it was a good expositon
of the features of the 386 architecture and how they might be used
in an operating system.  Now I can't seem to find the message, and
I haven't been able to find the book with no more to go on than the
vague description above.  So if you recognize yourself in this posting
please write me again.

Right.  The 'getnetbyname()' bug concerns any subnetting, as the
libc-4.4.1 routine will force the subnetting by looking at the IP
numbers irregardless of what /etc/networks say.  So if you have a
C-class network with a B-class or A-class IP number, the library routine
will incorrectly strip out the low 16/24 bits, which will obviously
result in "some problems".  The fact that this worked somewhat in
previous kernels just shows *how* lenient they were (but they also set
up incorrect routes, which led to problems sooner or later on most real
setups). 

As has been pointed out, SLS has the 4.4.2 libs (a pre-version, but I do
understand Peters reasoning - better one certain bug less even if there
are potentially new bugs), which fix this problem.  Also, you can
actually re-compile the 'route' binary and link it statically against a
good version of 'getnetbyname()' which will also give you a working
route.  Others have posted how to do this (it's essentially changing a
"#if 1" to a "#if 0" in the libc sources).

Hi John, what I would say is that if you live out on the bleeding edge
of hardware technology, it's probable that you will run into difficulties.
At least this has always been my experience.  I think it is because the
commercial software must always play catchup to the accelerated capabilities
of the hardware (since you can't really test on it until it's already
here) and software engineers cannot or do not always anticipate conditions
which will exist a couple years down the road, when the project they're
working on now will actually be released and being used in the field...

I'm not sure about LynxOS, but I can speak to what may be going on with
the SCO systems.

} and their ability to run SCO UNIX--several of them had problems similar to 
} mine, and in at least one case the solution was to cripple the machine 
} as I've had to do.

On SCO UNIX System V/386 Release 3.2 Operating System Version 4.0, and SCO
Open Desktop Release 2.0 systems there is a loop in the Adaptec 154x driver
("ad") and Adaptec 174x driver ("eiad") which can execute too quickly on a
fast machine (many 486/66DX2 and some 486/50DX machines).  The driver asks
the adapter whether it is present, then checks 131,072 times for a response.
The check executes faster on "fast" machines, and can time out before the
host adapter responds.  When that happens, the operating system assumes that
there is no adapter present.

SCO provided fixes (SLS unx365 for UNIX 3.2v4.0 and 3.2v4.1 and SLS oda366
for Open Desktop 2.0) for this, and fixed it in the current releases.

You could also "cripple" the machine during installation, and then patch
the kernel afterwards so that you could boot and run at full speed.  I
know of no other problems with "fast" machines on SCO systems other than
this--do you recall which version(s) the Byte folks were using in their
report?

I don't think it's possible to *ever* have too much machine, you just
need somebody who is able to catch up when the iron sprints out ahead. ;^)

I'm not really the expert, but here's a whack at answering your
questions:
ctwm - offers color icons, a 3-D look to window decorations
       (appearance is completely non-motif, similar to twm though)
       and has a virtual desktop with a "rooms" concept, ie, you have
       two completely separate desktops, each of which is the size of 
       your physical screen.
tvtwm - looks just like twm, but there's a pager which offers, I
        think, a single, really big desktop, which you can move around
        in. No attempt a 3-D appearance.

vtwm? I think I may have heard of this, don't know anything about it.

olwm - the openLook window manager. Pretty big, I think. Significantly
       different than twm in appearance. Has a margninally 3-D look on
       the window borders. No virtual desktop.

olvwm - olwm with a virtual desktop. Don't know how the virtual
        desktop works.

fvwm - Smallest of the bunch, has motif-ish 3-D appearance, a single
       big, virtual desktop, in which you can move by whole
       screen-fulls, or in smaller amounts (user settable). Color
       icons. At release 0.94, still has bugs. Release 0.95, of course
       will fix most all of the problems that have been reported.

I've seen someone else mention a problem with the release 99pl12 kernel,
and I believe I've stumbled over a bug in it as well, semi serious, because
it causes a hard crash.  The easiest way to make it happen is to run 
X-windows and start opening Xterms, at about 9 or 10, a hard crash occurs.
I don't have this problem with the 99pl12 Aug 8 ALPHA, or 99pl11, so it

I know it's bad form to reply to your own messages, but I fixed this with
the new patch that was issued for the release pl12, so anyone running with
this version should CERTAINLY apply this patch!  The patch appeared in
c.o.l.a a couple of days ago, but the description didn't seem to be urgent,
I guess reading comprehension classes are in order for me, because it was
urgent! :-)

Maybe you should have studied the source ?
Here is a clipping from the comments in iozone.c :

Why should the filesystem be unmounted ? Is there some sync'ing needed which

Is it just the fact that the BSD UFS looks more complicated to you that 
you don't like it ?

Surely there are room for improvement in the BSD UFS 
(as used in 386BSD/NetBSD/FreeBSD) , such as the clustering changes
Larry McVoy made at Sun, or the LFS work done by Margot Selzer.

One thing I like about BSD UFS is the robustness. I am usually not scared 
from turning of the power on a live and kicking fs.

This is a trifle unfair.  The DT RLL controller absolutely sucked,
and had you gotten any other controller, the OS would have installed
just fine.  We were bitten by the DT (from Gateway) as well, and
eventually wound up ordering Adaptec SCSI or "plain Jane MFM" cards/drives
in them and having very good success. (their IDE madness had not yet begun)

The DTK uses odd ROM locations and is a very atypical and flakey device.
This site has run ESIX 3.2-D (pretty close to your ISC) for years without
burping on the same vintage hardware from Gateway. Not using a DT of course.

We have also had this sort of problem with their tech support, DOS and
Windows are their sole area of familiarity.  However, we have at times
insisted on their taking back and exchanging components that have not worked
in our applications-- and they have done so willingly once we explained
our testing process.

We recently found an "occasional" problem between the cache controller on
a DX2-66V and an Ultrastor SCSI controller.  Two phone calls and the
Ultrastors became Adaptecs and our Netware servers are on-line. Truth to
tell, the tech did not believe our conclusions-- but they did do the swap
and credit us for the difference in price, which was what we asked for.

Esix (now at R4) seems to like Gatway hardware, and has installed flawlessly
on various successors to the original Gateway I removed the DT from.

It has been years since the DT RLL controller was even offered by Gateway,
so I am guessing that you haven't seen their recent products.  I personally
don't like their "integrated motherboard" products (for repair reasons);
but by and large Gateway makes a very solid product in their "large chassis"
desktop and tower-case configurations.  For DOS-weenies they bundle all sorts
of hand-holding software, Windows, Excel etc. and things work (mostly)
right out of the box.  For me (Unix and Netware) the Micronics based sytems
have been very solid, good power supplies, preconfigured with big SCSIs
(and Adaptecs:-), ethernet cards etc.  I've been quite satisfied.

I just use the products and get decent value for the money.

Subject: SCSI Performance (Yet Again)
Date: Fri, 20 Aug 1993 15:13:57 GMT

I keep seeing bitching and moaning about "poor SCSI performance" during
reads with all kinds of hand waving and inconsistent numbers.

Please-  Remember something called a Buffer Cache?  If you've got a 16MB
box, up to 6MB can be (and, if no programs take up the space, will be)
the Disk's Buffer cache.

Sure, it can take < 30 seconds to write a big 8MB file and 45-50 seconds
to read it, since the write() system call merely delivers it to the buffer
cache;  the read() call may have to wait for the disk to come around before
it returns to the user.  If you watch the little disk intensity light and
time it, the numbers should be about even.

Linux's performance is EXTREMELY respectable against $CO.  I'm not even
counting Bang for the Buck, either.

Remember that the buffer cache can be VERY BIG on a Linux system and that
this will screw up any attempt to measure performance on a disk drive.

Of course, if we had raw drives, we'd be able to get better numbers...

This is what I do.

If you want to keep your old kernel while adding a new one:
 - Move the new kernel to your root directory under a different name.
 - Make a new entry in the lilo config file for the new kernel image.
      (use the old one as a template, just change the image name
       and the symbolic name used by Lilo)
 - Run Lilo

To just replace your old kernel:
 - Copy new kernel over old one
 - Run Lilo

Note that the step that most people miss is re-running Lilo.  Lilo
has to do things like set the root device in the image, amoung other
things.

Here is my /etc/lilo/config.  I have lilo installed in the MBR of
