yeah, i tried it and still couldn't figure out how it works.
to be more precise, there are seven fields in the trnasfer button

regular_zmodem_dl
regular_zmodem ul
graphic_zmodem_dl
xrz3D
SEND - zmodem
RECEIVE - Reg. Zmodem
RECEIVE - Xrz3D

how these fields work? i read the man page and it didn't seem to
explain this. my interests are to receive a file from the remote host
and to send a file from local to remote. how do i give the file names
and can i define a path (download and upload path on both ends etc).

many thanks for any help.

There are no others :). Did you really think someone who is going to

bit all over? Only Microsoft could do such a thing.

Hmmm, I have a GW2000 that has Phoenix BIOS on it.  While Linux has no
trouble with it, my MS-DOG dislikes it extremely.  MS-DOG won't boot
unless the BIOS performs a memory check first.  I've talk to GW and they
haven't a clue. (I keep getting the grunts or trainees.)  So, I'm not
sure which is the problem.  My view now is that both BIOS's have
problems. Both work but they have their quirks.  It seems that even
after 15+ years the Intel based PC's are still beta products.  No wonder
businesses curse them and hackers love them.  Don't get me wrong, my
GW200 486-66MHz is a real nice system.

Summary: base your puchase on memory, disk space, cpu speed,
         accessories, service, then the BIOS.

Note: I'll agree on the SCSI recommendation, but because it allows for
      more devices than the other drive formats.

Date: 30 Aug 1993 23:51:27 -0400

I acquired a Compaq 386/20 with a bad cache RAM. Finally found out which
chip is bad and as soon as I get a new one, I'll have a spare computer.
It's got a 130MB HD and 6MB RAM, but only mono/cga video, so it's a good
candidate for a Linux box. How well does Linux coexist with Compaq quirks
such as cache, variable speed, etc? What's the best text to grab for a
newbie intro to Linux? I'm familiar with using Unix, having taken classes
which involve it, but not with sysadmin.

  Yes, you can, but you'll have to set up a DOS extended partition, thus 
creating a D: (or what ever the letter is after your last current DOS drive.)
Example:  If you currently had only a C:, you would have to make the second
partition D:..  There's no way to link two partitions together under dos..

Main memory (not including SWAP) shortages come very often when X is lunched.
Does someone had gcc's "Internal error.." when kernel reconfiguration with
X was lunched (or with other mein memory shrtage) ?

I think this is kernel's bug, not gcc's bug.
How do you think about this problem, everyone ?

Yes.  What you'd have to do would be to delete the linux partitions using
the linux "fdisk" from the install floppy disk, then create a DOS partition
in the resulting space using DOS "fdisk".  The only real thing to remember is
to use the "correct" fdisk for the partition type.

The point is that ftpd does a chroot(2) and then can't see
the libraries whatever sort of links you use. You either need
to have copies of your shared libraries under ~ftp or else
only ever put statically linked binaries under there.

        I just got a Canon BJ-200.  It's nice.  I know nothing about 
configuring a printer.  I tried the suggestions in the recent post regarding
a BJ-300.  What I get is...

        lpr: connect: No such file or directory
        jobs queued, but cannot start daemon

        Please help!  I get this message after quitting ghostscript or when
I try to lpr anything.

        I know ghostscript can output to it.  I did it in MS-Windows(please
forgive me)

Thanx in advance

Hello, Linuxers!

I'm looking for drivers that support the Irwin Accutrack series tape
drive.  Unfortuneately, SCSI is out of my reach, and at present I have no
means to backup my HD under Linux.  I could use floppies, but at present
I'm trying to avoid that.  Tape drives spoil ya pretty quick. :-)

Any information on this would definately be appreciated! :-)
