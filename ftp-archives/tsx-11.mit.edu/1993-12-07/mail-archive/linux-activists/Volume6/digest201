Subject: dip w/ SLIP: error
Date: 3 Sep 1993 22:02:18 GMT

I finally installed my system so that it doesn't bleep errors at me for at 
least 2 minute intervals so now I'm trying to get SLIP up and running.

I'm using the NET-2-FAQ and following the directions for a dynamic SLIP
connection.  

Everything looks good up until I have to key in the local and remote addresses.
The FAQ says to type:
DIP> local xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 
DIP> remote xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

but local and remote are not keywords in my version (old or new?).  I found
that there is a command called get so I do:
DIP> get $locip xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
DIP> get $rmtip xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

         ^^^^^^ I hope these are the equivalent of the local and remote cmds.

It eats the commands and then I'm supposed to type:
DIP> mode SLIP

Which then gives me the error:
SCICADDRT (<--spelling): Network is unreachable  

Does anyone know of this error and how to fix it.

Thanks,
Tom Bilan

Subject: Question about hostname
Date: 3 Sep 1993 22:18:51 GMT

I have a problem in setting my system's hostname. I recently installed
 the net-2 utilities, which include also a new version of /bin/hostname.
 It should set the site's name found in /etc/HOSTNAME when called
 as "/bin/hostname -S" in rc.local at boot time. 
 What happens is this: hostname reads the name correctly from the
 file, tries to do a "gethostbyname" system call which fails
 (Errorcode in h_error is 0) and gives a message: 
hostname: unknown host MY_NAME
 
 Also all programs that make use of gethostbyname will fail --
  "dip" for example exits with "MY_NAME: Error 0"  

I first installed the net-2 utilities under 0.99pl11, then updated to
 pl12. I tried both binary and source version (gcc 2.4.5,libc 4.4.1)
 My /etc/hosts seems to be set all right, according to the rules
 given in it. (Of course I did "hostcvt.build".) Using the old 
 /bin/hostname together with 0.99pl8, everything worked fine.  
 
  Can anyone please give me a hint?
        Thanx, Ron

I thought I had a pretty good idea of what "doesn't work" meant but
I wasn't sure so I didn't answer before. It could possibly be one
of these:

1. The file as we all know is too big for a 3.5" floppy. But it seems
   he has this in hand if he used gnu tar with the M option, as he
   implies. If not... split seems it should work with binary files.

2. We don't know whether he ftp'd in binary mode or not, but
   of course if not, the resulting tarfile will be corrupted
   before copying it to floppy.

I actually like trying to be a bit psychic sometimes. But like you say,
better questions get better answers.

Often, while researching a problem in order to post a question to the
net, I find out the answer myself. Imagine that!

Subject: MS Inport mouse...
Date: 3 Sep 93 17:58:11

When I saw the recent discussion of MS InPort busmice I decided I would give
the one that was lying around the office a whirl.  Needless to say I 
thought everything would go fine when I rebooted (after rebuilding the kernel
with ms bmouse support) and got the message of MS busmouse detected and
installed... Well, no.  My /dev/inportbm was c 10 2... but if I cat 
/dev/inportbm  or try running the mouse test program on it I get Device or
resource busy.   This is with the card set up on IRQ 5 (I don't think anything
conflicts with that, I pulled the soundcard and still no difference) and it set
to be the primary inport device.  I've tried it in different combinations of
jumpers (normal/xt, primary/secondary) and none get any farther than this.

What should I do?  Is this just not going to work?

Thanks in advance,
-Matt

It's the infamous shadow password effect again. You will need to compile
the pop server with shadow passwords enabled (I don't run pop, but I'd
guess it would be adding "-DSHADOW_PWD" to the Makefile).

If you are unsure that lack of shadow passwords support is at fault, as
root edit your /etc/passwd file and change a (non-root!) usercode password
to "" (i.e. userocde:*: --> usercode::). If you can login via the suspect
protocol with a null password - then shadow passwords is the culprit.

Subject: Installing on 24F
From: towen@kansas (tom owen)
Date: 3 Sep 93 20:03:18 EST


Help, I'm trying to install linux on a 486 that uses an UltraStor 24F
SCSI card to controll a 525 Mb hard drive.  When loading the loader
reports that it can't find any SCSI hosts or drives.  When trying to
do a fdisk, it reports that it can't open any devices and the install
script reports that the system has no drives.

I have modified the disktab file to reflect the appropriate values....
heads, sectors, cylinders, offsets, device #, but this was no help
either.  The system still reports that there are no SCSI devices or
hosts.  I am using SLS 1.03, which installed beautifully on my laptop,
but need help with the SCSI device.  Any Help would be appreciated.
Respond by either posting to this group or E-mail to:

this would be a goal of mine, but it's hard to realize, in fact, for
several reasons, the biggest of which is if you're a developer in
the middle of europe (like Markus Wild, mw, the person who's the
amiga port's "person", is) who's actively hacking on the code,
it's a *PAIN* to have to edit/hack/commit every little change over
a non-fast link...

for binaries, perhaps; the reason it's not been done so far is that
there's no real FTP maintainer.  (i guess i am, but i've better
things to do than track down "random" software releases...)
also, lamp does *not* have an unlimited amount of disk space...  8-)
