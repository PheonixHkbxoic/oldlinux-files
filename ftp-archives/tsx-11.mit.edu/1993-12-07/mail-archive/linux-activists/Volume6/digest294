Yes, but there is still one major problem. We have to separate the
functionality from the user-interface, because we cannot use X alone.
To many users do not use X because of lack of memory - these are most
likely to be happy to use such a tool like we want to write.

I think we have to provide a curses-interface as well - how this can
be done we should discuss.

My thinking is like: use virtual-functions (late binding) to have the objects
communicate with the user with the apropriate methods for the selected
user-interface. 

ParcPlace have done this with Motif/Openlook - why
should we not add a curses-layer?

But we have to avoid blowing up our task to unsolvable complexity, this
is what makes me uneasy :)

: system (or add a new one) and get options to either clear/delete it,
: or edit it's 'capabilities'.
Yes, this is what I wanted to do with the usermaintanement-stuff which
should use shadow-passwd-files and add the gui-fields if shadow is
detected - but as well work without and not bother about shadow-features.


Maybe we should create a mail-channel for this topic? If enough users
and developers are interested...

Please let me know...

Mhm, now that I read just another load of follow-ups, I think it would be 
good to create a language as someone proposed.

This would describe screens, and actions, acting on curses and X in the
same script...

The advantage is clear: many users can contribute their configuration-
scripts and do not have to bother to much with the userinterface.

Only - this I think I cannot do - it is to big a task. 

If someone can do such a great thing, I think I would retreat to using
the language creating some scripts - if not, I think we should stick
to the OI/uib-stuff.
While xview is nice, I think OI is much more real
ObjectOriented - and it is more easy to provide two userinterfaces
using the same functionalitycode with true objects...

Cheers, Michael Will - away for a week - sorry.

Just wanted to add to Linus' posting to upgrade to pl13.  This is
precisely my experience.  I had numerous problems with pl12 that
caused the machine to go "out to lunch".  My suspicion was a 
memory management leak.  In fact, if I just left the machine idle for
a sufficient length of time, it would sometimes lock.

pl13 is very stable (for me so far) and I've experienced no "hangs". 
Just one thing, when I ran the "bouncing ball" x-demo, it took so many
resources the mouse became unusable.  It was very difficult to exit.
Any ideas?

Try each of the different mice in the Xconfig file to see if one of
them will function more appropriately for you.  Also, check your mouse
to see if it has a protocol switch on it somewhere (mine has
"MS-2 Key" and "PC-3 Key" settings).  Some combination of the above should
work (it did for me).

I've noticed about 10% difference between FreeBSD 1.0 Gamma and Linux
0.99p12 in compiling ObjectBuilder.  I haven't tried FreeBSD 1.0
Epsilon yet, but expect that difference to become much smaller (like
on the order of 1 or 2%).

Compiling a certain large (40,000+ lines) C++ program, I've found that
Linux takes 31:22 to compile it, while FreeBSD 1.0 Epsilon takes 31:42
on the same system, same disks, etc.

Granted, this isn't number crunching, but it does show the two systems
tend to be about the same speed for what I tried.  Older versions of
BSD might be slower (I know that the Gamma version took about 2-3
minutes longer).

I had similar problems when I installed the original Slackware release.
I discovered that there were different versions of lpd and friends in a couple
of the directories.  I used `find' to get a list of all files starting with
`lp', and then I used `strings' to pick out the version numbers of each.  I
deleted the old and saved the new.  I had to change the lpd startup in 
/etc/rc.local.  

Once I removed the mismatched software, and started the current
daemon, everything worked smoothly.

One called gram's commander or gc was posted to one of the source groups
sometime this year.

     Graham    Wheeler,     Aztec     Information     Management,
     gram@aim1.aztec.co.za.


from the README file:

README for Gram's Commander v3.1
=================================

I have been promising this release for quite a while now. Unfortunately
I have been busy, been overseas, been sick, etc, so I haven't been able
to give it all the time it deserves. It works under UNIX SVR4, HP-UX, and
on Crays; other platforms may or may not work.

I have decided to reelase gc3.1 at this point because it is becoming 
difficult for me to respond to problems reported by the beta testers 
without access to the same target systems as they are using. My hope
in releasing gc3.1 now is that other users who may have more programming
experience than some of the gc beta testers will be able to find the
problems for me and send me patches. Also, if I don't do it now, gc3.1
will probably *never* be released, due to time constraints.

Despite the fact that it hasn't been completely ported to all Unix
flavours, if you are a programmer familiar with your architecture you
should not have much difficulty getting the system going. In particular
I have kept the use of Curses routines to a minimum as this is a big
portability problem.

Please read the gc3.doc file for full details about gc3.1. The gc3 manual
entry is very terse and really just refers to the doc file as well.

For those who are familiar with gc, you will be pleased to know that
gc3.1 is a *major* improvement over gc2.x, mostly because it is now
almost completely controlled by a fairly powerful script language. To make
the most of gc3 you will want to familiarise yourself with the script
language and create your own gc3.key file.



I hope someone finds htis helpful.
