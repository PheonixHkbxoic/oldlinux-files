Subject: SLS 1.03 Problem List
Date: Tue, 31 Aug 1993 09:47:23 GMT

I have just installed the latest version (26th August) of SLS 1.03 
(kernel pl 12), having been running an earlier (but smaller) SLS 1.0? 
quite happily. Unfortunately some things seem to have got worse, I would 
appreciate help and comments on the list below:

- Keyboards

How do I configure the keyboard! I know this is in the FAQ, but SLS 
comes with two programs for setting the keyboard: setkbd and loadkeys. 
The former does nothing and the latter works except for the right-shift 
key which becomes inoperative. I need this key! To be honest it was a 
lot less trouble to alter a Makefile and recompile the kernel, but this 
option seems to have disappeared (I realise that not everyone wants to 
do this).

- FAQ

Why is the FAQ in the SLS distribution out of date, could there not be 
some kind of mirroring or even a link, so that the latest version is 
always included?

- VFS

I used to be able to change a mounted floppy disk and get a message like 
"VFS: disk change detected". This no longer works and I just see the 
directory of the previous disk. Whilst this is ideologically purer, it 
is a lot less convenient.

- IFS

How do I get this to work? There seems to be no documentation and doing 
mount -t ifs /dev/mcd0 /cd gives a Segmentation Violation!

- Ghostview

This crashes my (whole) system. Why might it do this? It seems to be 
affected by particular files, but I haven't established if this is just 
to do with size, as it takes a long time to conduct the tests (running 
e2fsck after the system comes back up!)

- Where are zip and unzip (for MSDOS .ZIP archives) ?

I used to be able to type unzip to undo a DOS archive, I can't now. What 
happened? What am I doing wrong?

- Init

The new inittab is much smaller, and does not handle Ctrl-Alt-Del (I can 
no longer use this to reboot the system). The documentation is well 
hidden (under simpleinit(1)) and does not help much. Why has this 
changed? Where is the full documentation ? (as an aside, the man 
directory on tsx seems to have mostly section 2 manual pages, where are 
the sources for all the manual pages that do come with SLS?)

- Interrupts

Although there is a nice "make config" that asks me questions about my 
setup I still had to modify the busmouse.h file and the mcd.c file to 
alter the interrupts used. Mcd.c does not use the defaults that came 
with my drive, and sets up static globals rather than using #defines 
which makes me less happy about modifying it. This seems a pity. Can we 
not have a more general mechanism, or a section in the FAQ for common 
interrupt usage.

My configuration is

Kamco 486DX/33 256K Cache 8Mb RAM
Conner CP3204F (202Mb) Master, DOS on hda1, 16Mb swap file on hda2
WDAC2340 (325Mb) Slave, 1 large linux partition (hdb1)
Mitsumi LU-005S on IRQ 10, port 300, DMA 5(?) (defaults)
Soundblaster PRO on IRQ 5, port 220, DMA 1(?) (defaults)
MicroSoft In-Port Bus Mouse on IRQ2/9

Thanks in advance

Quite cool, but if you use the 8-bit-clean tcsh, the filter can recognize
ASCII-Files with Umlauts in the first line. Be aware of the tcsh-Syntax!

Subject: Malloc/free problems w/GCC 2.4.4
Date: 31 Aug 1993 13:52:34 +0200

Hello,
I was wondering, how does malloc work? I tried running the following program 
on my machine (8 Meg Memory & 8 Meg Swap, GCC 2.4.4, kernel 0.99pl10)

#include <stdio.h>
#include <malloc.h>

main()
{
 char *p;
 int i;

 i=100000;
 while((p=malloc(i))!=NULL){
        printf("%d\n",i);
        memset(p,0,i-1);
/* memset is necessary, otherwise we get reports about allocating 
   some 193M of memory!! (dirty bit flag on pages?)*/
        free(p);
        i+=100000;
        }
}

The results are that instead of allocating and deallocating single blocks of
memory until ca. 12 Meg, at i=4200000 the program stops.
I suspended it at i=3900000 and looked at 'ps -xu'. RSS was about 4M, but SIZE
was around 12! Infact swap space + memory used amounts to almost 14M.
Any ideas?
Moreover simply allocating memory without 'free(p)' does work!
Thanks, 
Fabio.

Did you make your partition active when you were in FDISK... This is a

then you MUST set it active, else it will not boot.

Long before there were (evil) symbolic links, there were hard links.
I don't understand the fascination that people in the c.o.l.* groups
have with symlinks, but this is a good example of When Not To Use Them(TM).
Assuming /home/ftp is on the same physical disk as /lib, a hard link
will solve the problem and you won't lose all that disk space
by having two copies of your library.

I have my eye on a tape drive (Wangtek 5150EN, I think) which has a
QIC-36 interface. Does the Linux kernel support QIC-36? If so, will the
tape drive work out of the box or does some work need to be done for
Linux to support QIC-36?

Subject: Hard Disk Controller(?) message
Date: Tue, 31 Aug 1993 13:22:37 GMT

I have recently installed linux on my machine from the
Slackware distribution. Although I haven't managed to make X
working 100% OK yet, I have the following question:

Quite often during a session, I get the message "Unexpected HD
interrupt" or something similar and occasionally the system
hangs. Why is that? I have used the mke2fs with the -c option.
I know I have bad blocks on my two Linux partitions, but they
are found and marked(?) during installation.

My system info:

80386DX (25MHz), 512K Trident 8900B SVGA, 8M of RAM, two primary
partitions - one for the filesystem (/dev/hdb2 with ~66Mb) and
a swap one (<4Mb). I have two hard disks, but Linux is on the
second one, which is an IDE one. I have installed everything,
BUT network/mail, printer, TeX and emacs stuff. Linux is loaded
from a diskette.

Thank you in advance for any suggestions.

Panayotis

Subject: Problem installing LINUX SLS1.03 from disk
Date: 31 Aug 1993 14:24:14 GMT

Hi.

I have some problems installing linux on my VLB 486/66. Hope someone
can help me. The fdisk procedure went fine and I rebooted the machine
and started with doinstall /dev/hda2. Then the install program prompted
to insert disk a2 and started installing correctly. But after two or three
"done" 's the screen showed:

lilo...stdin invalid compressed data format violation
done
sc.... stdin invalid compressed data format violation
done
shlibs...stdin invalid compressed data format violation
done
term 107...stdin invalid compressed data format violation
done

Then the computer prompted for disk a3.

Unfortunately this was not the only problem.

The next problem was with disk b4. Suddenly the screen was full with:

tar: Could not create directory/file xxxxx
tar: Could not create directory/file xxxxx
tar: Could not create directory/file xxxxx
......

e.g. directory linux/ipc or linux/ibcs couldn't be created.

Last but not least the boot disk didn't work (nothing happend after
the reboot from the floppy drive).

So my questions are:

-What went wrong and how can I solve this problems ?

-Do I have to repeat the whole installation or is it possible
 to install single disk (e.g. only a2 or b4 - 
 maybe with "sysinstall -disk").

-If I have to repeat the whole installation is there anything I have
 to do in advance or can I just do "doinstall /dev/hda2" again.

-Could the problem with the boot disk be caused by the 
 incorrect installation of disk a2 ?

Please email direcly to chris@sparc01.llt.de.

Thanks in advance

I had the same problem with my new installation. But then I looked
carefully at the installation messages. And installing emacs it
said something like 'you need to install xshlibs to run emacs'.
Thats what I did. (I installed the whole X- series). I hope thats
it. It worked fine for me.

In addition if you bought your copy of Linux from someone - eg SLS or
yygrdrasilwhatsername you can get the source from them at media cost
and the GNU license obliges them to provide it for you.

Hi,
        I have been trying to compile the kernel with the options enabled
for the wd80x3 series of ethernet cards.  Initially I tried to get it work
using the 0 options in /net/inet/CONFIG for autodetect.  When that failed
I put in the actual settings on the card, and it still does not work.  My old
kernel pl11 works fine.  This was compiled using gcc2.4.5.

At boot time this is what I get:

eth0:wd80x3 at 0x300, 00 00 c0 ff 92 53, wd80x3 shared memory at 0xcc000-
0xcffff.

Then later in the boot sequence I get the error

SIOADDRT: Network is unreachable.


Any thoughts anyone ?

Thanks,

Subject: Swapfile on DOS file system ?
Date: 31 Aug 1993 16:10:59 GMT

Hi all .
        I've read the SAG (System Admin Guide) and it mention something about
Linux sharing Window 3.1's swap space. Since SAG is still in alpha state it didn't
have any information attached to that topic.  I want to make more swap memory but
I don't have any space left in my Linux partition; so I was trying to creat a swap
file in my DOS partition. Well, my attempt wasn't successful.  I mounted the 
DOS partition and ran the command dd if=/dev/null of=swapfile etc .. to creat the
swap file. Then I ran mkswap command to write a swap signature.  That command
seemed to worked fine (no error message) .. but when I issued the command swapon
to that swap file I got an error message saying something like "bad swap file 
signature".   Did I do something wrong ? or should I do it differently for a 
DOS partition?  or .. is it possible to have a swap file in a DOS partition at 
all ? .  If you have any idea about this topic please drop me a few lines about
it. Thank you very much .
