I have Z-Nix (Microsoft Compatible) mouse with 2 buttons. In X of SLS 1.03,
I have problem to paste high lighted text. In normal X using 3-button
mouse, you can use the middle button to paste. But how to emulate this
using the 2 button mouse? I saw that there is a field in Xconfig called
"Emulate3Buttons", but nothing happened when I enabled it. 

Any idea?

Both VGA and SVGA cards use the 15 pin connectors (or is it more pins.) 
Anyway, yes you can plug it in.

This message continues my plea for help.  I've gotten several email
replies already, and I've tried to follow the advice given.  (They were all
virtually the same).

==
Okay, I've run the FDISK program on the a1 disk of the SLS installation.  I've
completely deleted the old DOS partition, and replaced it with the Linux/MINIX
partition.  Problem with that:

I installed it as primary partition 1.  It says I have cyls 1-981 (correct). 
So I select cyl 1 for the first cyl, and I try to selest 981 for the last.  It
balks and says Linux cannot currently access so-many-blah sectors.  I have an
80M drive, and I'd like to use all of it for Linux.  So, I tried again, and
used the +spaceM option instead of last cyl.  I used +80M, which I assume was
correct.  It balked again w/ the same msg.

!! In both cases, it also gives a warning! that the partition has an odd # of
sectors.  I can't get past this.

But, I tried again anyway..  Just like before, I get errors from tar that it
can't create such-and-such a file because it doesn't exist or the dir isn't
there.  It also gives errors about running out of room on the drive.

==
For this run, I've been trying to install the minimum Linux system (~12M) just
to see if there is a problem with my hardware.


If anyone can help me out of this jam, I'd appreciate it!  I am eager to begin
using Linux, and these delays are depressing..  :-{

I'm a Linux newbie, but I'll give this a shot.  Can you boot DOS from a
floppy? Your mail did not mention this.  If so, run the DOS fdisk.  As
per the FAQ:

FAQ:  III.16)  How can I remove LILO from my hard drive?
FAQ: 
FAQ: ANSWER: Simple. First you need an MS-DOS 5.0 (or OS/2) bootable floppy
FAQ: with FDISK.EXE on it. Boot it and run the command
FAQ:    FDISK /MBR 
FAQ: which will (hopefully) restore your hard drive's master boot record to
FAQ: a standard MS-DOS (resp. OS/2) boot record. Now you can go back and
FAQ: reinstall LILO. :)

LILO modifies your MBR, I think, which is your problem.

To be much safer on writes, change the code to do:

        sti(); port_write(first 255 words only); cli(); port_write(last word);

Actually, just inserting  sti(); nop(); nop(); cli();  
in front of the port_read/write lines may work in many systems.

How much memory on that system?  I still have a problem with my Adaptec

the motherboard, or a bug in Linux.  I have swapped all the memory
from another working system with Linux, and the old stuff runs fine
with 20mb installed and an IDE drive, the known good memory still has
a problem with the Adaptec machine, so it's not memory.  In addition,
I've swapped out the Adaptec, and that didn't fix it either...

There are a number of packages available for telecommunications under Linux.

Probably the most popular and well known is Seyon. It is a well rounded
communications package that runs under X-windows, and has build-in
support for automatic Z-Modem downloading, script files, and other feature
too numerous to mention.

XC (or xcomm), is one of the more popular term programs for use with the
standard login shell.  It also has automatic Z-Modem downloading, and
comes with the sources for rz/sz.  This is my preferred comm program.

Also available are PComm, ECU, and a few others that I've not tried.  They
should also work well.

You can find Seyon or XC on the most popular archive sites for linux sources,
namely

  tsx-11.mit.edu
  sunsite.umc.edu
  nic.funet.fi

I think the real differences are already there:
        1. slackware is a good package, with excellent installation utilities
        2. it is much more up to date, and more responsive to change.

But the edges can still be polished:

        add a "READ-ONLY" line to /etc/lilo/config  so that bootutils can work.

I have not been successful getting Linux SLS 1.03 to boot off my hda1
partition.  On my system, a 4Mb, 386/33 with a 200+M disk, I have two
Linux partitions: hda1 as my / disk (~200M) and hda2 as my swap disk
(~16M).  My machine is a "pure" Linux machine.  There are no other
partitions on it; no DOS or any other kind of partitions. I can boot
off my boot floppy without any problem.  However when I tried to boot
off my HD, my system hangs everytime.  BTW, I did use fdisk to make my
/dev/hda1 partition bootable and had also used the "harddisk" command
from the a1.3 disk.

Any ideas?

Forget Xircom.

The Vendor doesnt give out ANY programming info (hardware specs)
Buy a different adapter, there is a device driver for Linux from a Vendor
called D-Link.

D-Link is open-system oriented. Xircom is not...all you can do is buy their
shit, but you won't get anything else.

And worst, the pe3pd.com (packet driver which runs under Dos) is
partly stolen from the Public Domain, this is a GPL Violation.
(I know that cuz I have disassembled it - but even disassembling is
forbidden by Xircom !)

Throw your Xircom adapter in the garbage bin - buy D-Link

(I am NOT! working for D-Link. Our university accidentially has bought Xircom
 adapeters, too, how idiotic !@$%^&*(*)() , and now you are not even allowed
to write a device driver because that requires either hw-specs or reverse
engineering)

In SLS 1.03, when I "mdir", the system tells me "Probable non-MSDOS disk,

There was a time the system also gave this information 
"floppy 0: sector not found: track 0, head 0, sector 16". 
The situation is similar for B drive.

When I boot Linux, I noticed a line among bunch of information saying

Installing a system should not be this hard..

I'm running out of hope and good nature.  Either I find a way to install Linux
on my computer or I'll have some very sore things to say about the SLS disks..
;-)

--

I HAVE REACHED THE END OF MY ROPE.  Could some kind soul email me some
detailed instructions on how to install Linux on my computer using the SLS
disks?  I am so frustrated with the error messages I get, I'm about to lie
down and cry!

I've posted three msgs on this topic, and rec'd a few good hints.  But nothing
seems to help!  I.E. On my last attempt, I killed all partitions of any kind
using Linux's fdisk, reinstated a Linux/MINIX partition.  !!This met with two
errors: 1.) Odd number of cylinders when I choose the limits on my disk 1-981,
2.) Linux cannot currently use ___ sectors on this partition.  I reboot
anyway, and find that I cannot install a damn thing to the computer!

What I want to do should be very simple:

o  Remove Dos

o  Use only Linux, taking up as much of my 81Mb (according to Dos 5.0 FDISK)
as I can.

o  Install the base system, utils, LaTeX, sc, X, Seyon, Gnuplot, gcc, and f77. 
Maybe a few other progs as well..

o  Start using it!


At this point, all I've achieved is removing Dos from my system.

I really need some step-by-step instructions on what to do.  I feel like a
total fool trying to install this silly mess, and I need a way to get out.  If
you can offer direct email support, I'll jump for it.  If you'll volunteer
hand-holding installation via telephone, I'll call you on my dime.

I just don't want the $150 I spent on the SLS disks to go to waste!

I have been working with SLS 1.0 for some time, and I have
been very productive with it.  Just one question though,
what is a proc filesystem? It came up as an option
in the kernel, and is enabled, but my proc directory
and subs are empty.
I obviously don't need it to run X, write programs, and use
tcp/ip.  



... Sincerely, Derek

Need I say more?  My Linux box is at work, so I can't get too specific when
replying from somewhere else.  Just check the man page and set things up
according to that.  :)

But I use the svinit-2.4 package, which has three separate programs: 
shutdown, reboot and halt.  Actually, reboot and halt are hard links.  The 
manual says that shutdown is a frontend to reboot and halt, and one should 
not use the latter two programs directly.  When you call shutdown, it 
executes the /etc/brc script, which has a line like `umount -a'...
