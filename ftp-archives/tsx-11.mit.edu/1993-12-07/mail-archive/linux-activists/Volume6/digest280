Subject: STB Multiport serial woes ...
Date: 1 Oct 1993 12:53:21 -0700

Having read this and that, I decided to go ahead with a purchase of the STB
four port serial card (sort of an AST fourport clone).  Well, after having
finally navigated the difficulties (we had to purchase 9-pin to 25-pin
converters to attach our modems ... and of course they screwed up the gender
the first time) it seems that it is ignoring incoming data.  To explain, if
I send, for example, ATZ, I see the modem flash both send and receive (as it
echoes the ATZ and then sends the OK).  So the modem is functioning properly
and is sending the responses back, but I never see these responses on the
screen under kermit.  I checked the cables out themselves and, according to
the docs I have, all the pins matched up just fine.  (Then again, the docs
came from the people who made the cables ... *wink*)  Anyway, I have some
small suspicion that, because I have no idea what the hell I'm doing, it might
be something in the software end.  I'm running SLS 1.03 currently (0.99pl12
theoretically) and setserial 2.02.  My rc.serial looks something like this
for the four ports:

    /etc/setserial /dev/cua4 uart 16550A irq 15 port 0x1f8
    /etc/setserial /dev/cua5 uart 16550A irq 15 port 0x1e8
    /etc/setserial /dev/cua6 uart 16550A irq 15 port 0x2a8
    /etc/setserial /dev/cua7 uart 16550A irq 15 port 0x1a8

Obviously, at least some of this is working, as transmitted characters go
through okay.  I used mknod to make nodes for cua4-cua7 and ttyS4-ttyS7, by
simply incrementing minor device numbers (I actually made nodes for cua2-cua7
and ttyS2-ttyS7), since they didn't exist previously.  Any comments, etc.,
would be extremely welcome.  :)

Seriously: Linux can do multitasking, multiprocessing, run X applications and

 Linux, and a really weird compilation (first, translate Fortran to C. Then
 use the gcc compiler), it only takes 240 sec for the same run! (watch here,
 MicroSoft!). Definitely, give it a try.

Try with the config file of lilo, /etc/lilo/config. Read lilo docs (if they

Subject: X Video Compatibility
Date: 1 Oct 1993 18:27:00 -0400


I had a couple of questions about X Windows with a few different video cards:

1) I am using a generic Paradise (Western Digital) color SVGA card with
256k of RAM.  When I load X (startx), it first comes up in grey, then
switches to color.  Then, all sorts of weird lines come up when I try to
move a window.  Also, areas of the screen are not updated properly.  I am
using the '00' WD setup (I think the full name is wd30c00 in Xconfig, not
really sure). 

2) I know that currently there is no support for ATI Mach32.  When will
support for these cards be available?  Also, what about support for the
Hercules Graphite (IIT's AGX chip).

3) I am very new to the Unix world, and was wondering if there is a way to
make X look like Solaris 2.2 (or something similar -- from what I have
seen, it looks pretty dull).

Thanks for any replies.

Subject: DOS From Linux
Date: 1 Oct 1993 18:31:18 -0400


I have a couple of questions about using DOS from Linux.

1) I know that there is a DOS emulator that comes with Linux (I think I
have SLS 1.03, and the kernel is 00.99.12), and I know it was installed,
but how can I use it?  

2) It seems there is a way to mount my DOS partition (/dev/hda1) from
Linux, but there was never an entry for it created in fstab, and the same
goes for my swap partition (/dev/hda3).  I also haven't been able to
access the floppy drives (fd0 is 3.5" 1.44MB, fd1 is 5.25: 1.2MB).

3) Also, has anyone tried to use a Linux machine as a server on Windows
for Workgroups?  I assume you would need the WFW TCP/IP drivers from
Microsoft ($25 extra).

Thanks.

I posted a message earlier about my NFS problem, but did not get any replies.

I am running .99pl13 with NFS and cannot mount a filesystem on another system. 
When I boot up .99pl9-6 I can mount it fine.

I notice that when .99pl9-6 boots, it said 3c503 GOT IRQ 5, but when .99pl13
boots it shows the unique address but does not show an IRQ.

Do I need new NET software?  I noticed in the /linux/inet directorty that there
is a config system where you can change the ORQ address, and it is currently
set to 7 Will changing this number to 5 fix the problem?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Please respond via private e-mail

Some further clues:

On slow (non-turbo) boot attempts I sometimes get errors to the effect:

"837: failed to reset".  Yes my system has an 80837 math copro.  Linux
recognizes this hardware on boot-up, even when the chip is disabled in
my BIOS.

It has been mentioned thay my a1 boot floppy may need to be re-written.
I have however used this floppy to boot other PC's.  Is it possible that
I have a buggy boot floppy ?

Thanks again for your help!

I just checked with Dan - he said that the port to his Microwave is fairly
stable and in alpha, but has delayed the refrigerator port due to major
rewrites required in X-Cheese and also handling exceptions for the
vegetable crisper which would require a kernal rebuild.
