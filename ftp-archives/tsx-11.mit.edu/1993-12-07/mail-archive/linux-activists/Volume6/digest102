I agree, if you're willing to put in a few minutes of work for every program
(except ones with precomp-binaries), because you are usually *porting to linux*
and having to put up with the mutantness of linux (SYSV with some BSD with

Well, I went back and tried this again.  Good thing I did too, because it worked.
changing the CONSOLES line in /etc/login.defs did what I wanted.
I Then changed it again to reference the file /etc/securelogin.  It now allows
me to put my CONSOLE information in that file!  Now both answers are right!

Have you recompiled the kernel and moved it to the name that the previous
version was using?  You have to run the LILO install EVERY time you modify
the kernel, even though it's in the same directory and has the same name.

I'm with you here, you can run numlok in your rc file once at boot and
be done with it for all consoles.  I don't understand the comment about
having to "hack your /etc/rc", what installation doesn't significantly
change the rc & rc.local files? :-)

BINGO!  I have three in my LILO menu, and if I have a problem with one,
or I'm tinkering around with it, I can boot another.  In addition, every
patch I've ever seen wants a clean kernel source tree, why garbage it up
with a patch I don't need. :-)

SunOS 4.x has System V-style curses under /usr/5bin --- that includes
attributes but may not include color, I haven't checked.  (Color and acs_map[]
were added to SVR3 curses; attributes were in SVR2, including A_ALTCHARSET,
but there was no specific support for alternate character sets.)  Solaris 2.x
has standard SVR4 curses.

Moreover, porting ncurses to any system which supports POSIX (which is to say,
at least termios and sigaction) is fairly simple (barring the usual, e.g.
incompatible prototypes between ncurses and system header files).  There is
support for SunOS in the source for 0.7.2, but it didn't look quite right to
me... easy to fix, though.

In any case, I suspect you'll find SVR4 curses showing up on other systems,
since BSD curses still doesn't have attribute or alternate character set
support.  I think 4.4BSD defines termcap entries for such (a bit too late,
IMHO, as everyone else using BSD termcap/curses has already pseudo-
standardized on their own sequences --- mutually incompatible with each other
and 4.4BSD, of course) but curses hasn't been rewritten to use them yet.  In
the meantime, System V curses has had them for several years and applications
have been written to use them, making it a de-facto standard.

Subject: How to get a boot/root linux floppy
Date: 12 Aug 93 20:47:40 GMT

I would like to create the equivalent of the SLS A1 disk for
the version of linux I'm running on my system.  I've read the
lilo documentation but I'm still not sure of what I'm doing and
why things aren't working.  Could someone please correct my
thinking listed below?

Doing a 'dd if=/zImage of=/dev/fd0' copies a bootable image
to a floppy.  I know this part works.  The problem is how to
get a root file system on that same floppy and how to get the
image to mount that root file system.

I calculated the number of sectors the image would take for
storage on the floppy.  Then I used 'fdisk /dev/fd0' to create
a partition on the floppy starting at a cylinder beyond the end
of the image.  I made an ext2 file system on that partition and
mounted it.  I copied all kinds of stuff (/etc/init, /etc/inittab,
/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /bin/getty, /bin/update, /bin/sh, etc.)
to that floppy's file system.  I made a /dev/fd0 node with
'mknod /dev/fd0 b 2 0' in the floppy file system.  I ran lilo
with a config file containing 

boot = /dev/fd0
  :
image = /dev/fd0
  range = 1+397         # this is the number of sectors
                        # used by the 'dd' of the image file

My problems are that this doesn't work.  If I don't do the 'dd'
and make the file system on the entire disk and don't include
the 'range' variable, lilo only gets through the first 'L', then
hangs.

Doing all I've described above gets me to the point where lilo runs,
loads something, then starts lilo again, loads something, runs
lilo again, etc.

Do I have to do something like change my root directory before
running lilo?  I tried using the lilo -r option but it can't find 
the directory where the floppy is mounted.

If these are ignorant questions, please excuse my stupidity.  Can
anybody help?

First you do need to do a msdos sys command on your d drive
second the lilo config file should have
an entry like this:
other = /dev/hdb1
        label = msdos_d
        table = /dev/hdb
