I installed Linux SLS 1.03 last night and logged in as "root"
and decided to change the /etc/passwd file and change "root" to "kims" and
change my home directory as well.  I also changed my shell to tcsh using chsh.
I tried to login with "kims" but there is a problem.  It can't find tcsh.
and it won't let me log in.
btw, I never set any password for "root" or "kims" and so when I tried to
logon as kims it never asked me for a password.  Is that supposed to happen?
I have the disks so that I can reinstall Linux, but I thought I'd ask here
first.

I have recently purchased SLS 1.02 from a local dealer, to learn Unix 
and produce C Programs.

I am having problems getting GCC or CC to compile very simple C Programs.
Should there be a linker or make program? 

Also should there be include files such as stdio.h and stdin.h as with
usual C
compilers? Again I have installed the GCC Package only to find quite a
few 
usual .h files missing.

Does anybody know where I am going wrong?

No problem. Two ways to do it.

1) add this line to your /etc/fstab file

/dev/hda3       swap    swap    defaults

2) Put the swapon command in you /etc/rc.local file.

Hope this helps,

   Wait... you said in the first paragraph that you did.  Which is it?

   I suspect that your problem is that your system is using shadow
passwords, and you tried to modify /etc/passwd.  Instead of editing the
files directly, use the 'usermod' command.  It's *much* easier and
faster.

Are we missing anything here when talking about performance?
Besides the factors of CPU speed, local bus and memory size,
the performance is also very much dependent on the memory
access patterns in the benchmark/application programs. Unless
we use the same code to test different machines, the result
would not hold in every sense. That's often the trick played
by the dealers and manufacturers, I believe.

So you guys may pass on the test programs to each other and
run it on different machines. Then the result may tell you

Reply-To: s4ucwg@fnma.COM
Date: Tue, 14 Sep 1993 19:35:56 GMT

I am running SLS 1.03 on a 386 33mh with a trident
8900c.  I have a 125 mb hardrive configured as c:,
a 1.44 mb 3" as a:, and a 5" as b:.  The hardrive is
partitioned as 32 mb DOS as hda1, 8mb swap as hda2,
and the rest as hda3 (ext2).  I boot native DOS (5.0)
from c:.  I boot linux from a:.  I am NOT using LILO.

Notes/Questions:

1.) I first configured DOSEMU to run from an "hdimage"
file.  I did not like having my DOS partition as drive D.
I then configured it to run from a "diskimage" file.
My disk image is drive A, I skipped my 3 inch, my 5 inch 
is drive B, my DOS partition is drive C (EMU), and my
linux / is drive D (EMU).

Any way to boot DOSEMU and keep a: as a:, b: as b:, etc.?

2.) Quicken 6.0 fails when I start it up.  I found that if
I start it as "q > q.msg" it comes up ok.  Quicken wants to
remind me to do backups and this messages seems to cause
problems for DOSEMU.  The Quicken graphs are close - with
the labels a little screwed up.  I have NOT tried to work on
graphics parameters.  I specified "trident and 1024" in the
config.  I also got XMS to work and am loading everything high
(DOS, doskey, and mouse).  EMS gave me an error "Can not set
line A20" or something like that.

Recommendation of XMS versus EMS?
Ideas on EMS error about line A20?

3.) DOS edit doesn't work.  It comes up.  I can type stuff
in the edit area, but when I pull down a menu, a get a DOSEMU
debug message "ERROR:  InsKeyboard could not put key in buffer". 

???

4.) Telix came up, initialized my modem, and I dialed myself
on the phone and properly registered a busy signal.  After I
exited Telix, it seemed my keyboard buffer was screwed up.
Almost as if "local echo" stayed on - very strange.

Any ideas?

5.) Automap (a very detailed graphic depiction of the US with
roads, geographical highlights, etc.) worked well.  It was very
slow, but everything seemed ok, including the mouse, (it must have
it's own mouse driver).

6.) I do not understand the mouse or the ports parameters.  I
know the doc says that the mouse doesn't work. I tried the MS
mouse driver, and it could not find the mouse.  I tried the Artec
driver, and it loaded, but I do not think it actually loaded
properly.  I ran the Artec test program and screams came out of
the speaker but no mouse activity.

???

Thanks in advance,

So. Well. Another think which is a little weird on the bootdisk.gz (9.9.93).

The fdisk seems to be a somehow broken version.

Description of "problem":

1. Setting up the first primary partition with first cylinder 1 gives
following output when looking at the table:

            Begin       Start       End
/dev/hdb    1           1           xxxxx       Linux native
        phys=(0,0,2) should be (0,1,1)

What's about that? Never got this before (SLS-bootdisks).

2. If there already a first primary partition set up, and one starts to set up
a second one this fdisk doesn't recognizes that there's already some cylinders
in use.

It still gives [1-xxxx] as cylinders to choose from... No problem for me but I
can be one for beginners...

What I'm interested in now, is what fdisk is this? (I mean from
what package? So I can avoid ever trying this version...).

bye,
    Peter

Did you replace the root account with the kims account? I'd imagine
that setuid programs will stop working if the root account were to go
away or have it's uid set <> 0, and this will cause problems (for
example, login is setuid, and it doesn't work on your system anymore).

I've got a perl script that does this -- creates accounts for people after
they enter a username and password.  It's a bit rough, but uses a perl 
library I wrote for dealing with /etc/{passwd,shadow,group} and another
for locking files to make sure two people don't try to update them at the
same time.

The libraries could be useful in their own right: I'm using the 'passwd.pl' 
library for other things like a 'passwd/chsh/chfn' program to change one's 
password, shell or full name (gecos).  It works quite well; the library 
detects whether you use shadow passwords or not and does the right thing.

My lockfile library is also in use by other things, notably an offline mail
and news packer (does QWK and a 'raw' format right now, SOUP is coming up).

Any of this stuff is free for those who want it -- just write me.

please do not include the garbage noise from c.o.l.* on the same

You'll have my order in a heartbeat after the Nov/Dec CD is available
unless it's all full with USENET postings. I'd be real interested

But not if the USENET noise is on the linux archive CD...
