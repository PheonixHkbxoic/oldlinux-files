Yes, but WHY?  A modern Bournish shell language which depends on an
external program to evaluate common if-statements?  It's so silly.....

I have noticed that the ctrl+alt+del key sequence is not being recognized 
by Init (vers. 2.4) when I run the 99.pl11 kernel.  

It works fine under 99.pl8.  

Has anyone else experienced this problem?  If so, is there a fix available?

Is there a better place to post such questions?

Thanks,

I think that there were some major changes, so there are not
patches all the way up.  Why not just get the whole new version?
(Unless you have to pay for downloads or something...)

Series A?  SLS?   Install the A series the way you normally
would.  Just rename your custom compiled kernel something else
so it won't get written over though...

Best place to find out about that is the kernel sources.  If you don't
have them, then get them and install in /usr/src.  There is a
rather good README in /usr/src/linux that explains compiling
the kernel.  Believe me, I was hesitant at first, but it was
really easy (almost idiot proof)!

Hello -

I seem to remember stuff going by about cross-compiling Linux stuff
on a different system. I haven't heard anything about this lately.
Is it possible to compile stuff on my Sun IPC (w/gcc) for later
use on my 386? I would also be interested in compiling 6502 code
on my Linux box also... It would be nice to be able to recompile
the kernel for a specific boxes attributes. I don't have a second
PC to do it on so I guess I'm SOL otherwise...

They may still be on track. It always depends what they condider 'middle

I'm not too worried about getting the latest SLS the second it 
comes out. My current system is stable and works great. Besides that, 
Slackware is better anyways.

Date: 18 Aug 93 17:42:16 MDT


 I was working at DEC-5000 workstaion in order to store SLS "a1" (
the first disk) into 3.5" disk (a1.3) but it was not successful because
  
    1) a1.3 was bigger than 1.44M
    2) according to the SLS README file, I am suppose to store in image
       format (cannot use "mcopy").  So, I tried "dd if=a1.3 of=/dev/floppy 
       bs=16k) but didn't work.  

How can I store a1.3 into 3.5" format disk if I would like to work at DEC-5000?
Additionally, I wonder, all of those a1-x10 are binary files.  (Should I
FTP all of those files at binary mode?)  Thank you very much.

I'm doing it right now.
Get nntplink-3.1.0.tar.z and your favorite newsreader (tin, trn, nn)
I'm using trn-3.2 which compiled right out of the box. You just need to
compile the newsreader to use an nntp newserver. It's very cool.

Basically, using term, you need to set YOUR machine as the nntpserver, and
tredir port 119 to your real newserver.

(on local)
tredir 119 your.news.server:119

viola.

Subject: Joe can't write?
Date: 18 Aug 93 23:59:00 GMT

I have a slightly annoying problem with an application on a linux system
here that I've been unable to figure out.  I have two systems running
linux, X, networking, etc. everything seems to be working fine.  I built
the second system by tar'ing the first onto a tape and dumping it onto
the partition of the second one, so they should be close in configuration.
The problem is that the editor joe can't edit an existing file, but it can
create a new one!  When I attempt to save a file that I've edited on my
second system with joe, I get:

Couldn't make backup file... file not saved

Doing an identical operation on the first system works like a champ.  Since
I'm doing this as root, it doesn't seem to be a permissions problem, but
I sure can't figure it out!  Anyone have any idea what may be causing the
problem?  BTW, I've installed the same copy of joe on each system, so it's
not that. :-)

I recently added 4mb to my 16mb system with linux 99pl12 running, and 
recompiled the kernel allowing more than 16mb of RAM.  Everything ran
ok, but the machine is MUCH slower with more RAM!!!  I expected that
there might be a slight overhead, since the question is asked in the
config. but I wasn't prepared for how slow it really was!  Is there
something obvious that I'm missing?  Running in X, it's painful with
the additional 4mb of RAM, that sure doesn't seem right. :-)

Can't help you with your problem sorry, but I'd just like to
make a coment on this.  C++FLAGS should be used for just options
like -O and -g, NOT libs OR includes.  LDLIBS and CPPFLAGS should
be used instead, respectively (or their C++ equivalents.)

As an example, here is my _entire_ Makefile I use when making
single file xview apps:

CFLAGS=-g -DDEBUG
CPPFLAGS=-I$(OPENWINHOME)/include
LDLIBS=-L$(OPENWINHOME)/lib -lxview -lolgx -lX11

Look Ma, no targets!  And Suns make, (and presumably gmake) is
smart enough to do the right thing when given something like
'make myprog', searching for myprog.c and compiling it properly.

When I want to do a final 'release' compile, I just invoke make
as 'make CFLAGS=-O myprog'

    Which will happen eventually.  If nobody else volunteers I'll
be giving it a shot.  I've got a new machine coming with an Adaptec
2742T and a gig SCSI drive, and tech specs on the card coming
from Adaptec.  It should be interesting, if not necessarily
successful.  

    Anyone else interested in developing/testing a driver for
the AHA2742T can mail me at:  sferris@macalstr.edu

    Of course, the first problem I'll have to overcome is getting
a kernal compiled with the driver in it.  I can keep the Linux source
on the SCSI if I use an OS Adaptec ships a driver for, but compiling
all the source on the 120 Meg IDE from my old machine won't work
well, and I'd rather not pay $$ for a decently sized IDE when
I've got a gig SCSI sitting there.  There are times when a
generic INT 13 driver would come in handy.  
 
   Though perhaps I can fit the Linux binaries and all the
necessary objects on the 120 Meg IDE, and just compile the
driver and link.

And selected parts of my /etc/rc: (cutoffs marked with ....)
#!/bin/sh
....
# remove /etc/mtab* so that mount will create it with a root entry
/bin/rm -f /etc/mtab* /etc/nologin /etc/utmp

# mount file systems in fstab (and create an entry for /)
# but not NFS because TCP/IP is not yet configured
# No, I don't even have NFS here.. not yet, at least
/etc/mount -avt nonfs
....

NOTE! I do NOT have any lines like
rdev >/etc/mtab
in my /etc/rc. If you have something like that, try commenting it out.
(But remember to keep a reliable boot/root diskette at hand, just in case..)
