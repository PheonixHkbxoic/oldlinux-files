I am running dosemu 0.48 and I have my hdimage loaded with DOS 6.0 and
Doublespace (I am _not_ doublespacing the hdimage, but I have the driver
loaded, and a dblspace.ini file on hdimage, and I open up my 70MB
DoubleSpace partition with no problems so far, even if dosemu chokes it
still doesn't seem to damage the dos6 partition.

You should really try to use the answers you get before you post again. 
probably the / partition is set up incorrectly in /etc/mtab, so du cannot 
read the specs.  please remove any 
cat foo morefoo evermorefoo > /etc/mtab 
from your /etc/rc startup files (or whatever init you use, from the other
startup scripts) and do a rm -f /etc/mtab /etc/mtab~ instead.
after this do a mount -a. This will setup your /etc/mtab file correctly,
if your /etc/fstab file is OK. The /etc/mtab file is the file that will be read
by all those programs df, du and so on.
BTW, this is really in the FAQ, so please read it. It probably will be a good
idea to get the getting started book from the LDP, too.

Subject: OAK/VGA 512K Question
Date: Thu, 19 Aug 1993 09:37:10 GMT


        Hello linux readers,

I finally got linux installed. However X11 is giving me some trouble
which is probably caused by unsupported VGA hardware.

I've got a ET4000-Ultra which does work without any Linux/X386 problems
(default Xconfig file). But it has a known hardware problem (which I
also encountered under DOS when working in graphics mode). The screen
is getting unreadable after a while (just like some memory loc's are
swapped and/or not refreshed). Repainting the screen does help sometimes.

So I had to reinstall my old cheap OAK 512K VGA controller. Which doesn't
work for the standard Xconfig file. My questions are;

        Can I use the OAK/V512K controller?

        Can some kind soul supply me a Linux OAK/V512K configuration kit?
        (Or point me out to a ftp-env).

        Should I buy myself an other VGA card, and if so what is
        best to buy?

Thanks,
-- Wim ten Have.

Subject: [HELP] ar and libraries.. linking fails
Date: Thu, 19 Aug 1993 10:18:15 GMT

Hi Netters:

Please help me out here. I have a problem which I can't seem to figure out.
I am writing a pretty big C++ program, with lots of classes. I have each
class in a subdirectory, so let's say I have:
        myprog          -       main dir
        myprog/class1   -       a class directory
        myprog/class2   -       another
                etc...
The problem is this: all directories contain object files (after compilation
of course). I want to include all objects in a library libmyprog.a, in the
main program directory. That's cool, ar does its thing. What I use, btw., is
        ar rvs libmyprog.a a.o b.o c.o class1/d.o class1/e.o class1/f.o
etc.

Now, when I try to make the proggy, the linker (ld, started by gcc) complains
that some functions cannot be found. However, they *are* in the library, as
can be seen with nm. Even when I copy all the objects to *one* directory, and
add them to the library from there, the linking stage fails.

I tried several things: e.g., putting the stuff in the library and running
ranlib just before the link stage, etc.. None of this seems to work. It
appears that ar doesn't create a proper symbol table for the library. This
failure only occurs when a *lot* of files are moved into the library; with a
small number of files all goes well.

Oh, one more thing. With another ar, on a different machine (SCO unix) all
works fine. I really think that this is a problem of the ar which comes with
gcc 2.4.3.

Additional information: I am running kernel 99pl10, but that is not relevant
here -- I suppose.

Who has had similar problems with ar? And, who has found a solution?

Hoping for a response --
Karel.

Comment out / remove the Emulate3Buttons line from your Xconfig.  If that
doesn't work, you will need to get a different mouse or find some patches to
make yours work.

I've similar problems with ext2fs last week, but that was due to an old version

This is the correct route anything in the network 127.0.0.0 should

Linux is DOS.  DOS is Disk Operating System.  MS-"DOS" is a single user,
single tasking, single processing program loader; which is hardly an OS
at all.  In fact, one could say that Linux=DOS and MS-"DOS"<>DOS!  :) :)

Hello out there!

        First of all, I have read the FAQ, and I still have two questions:

How well does linux run on a Zenon EISA system?  I read in the FAQ that linux
likes ISA better that EISA.

Also, does a driver exist for the CD-ROM drive that comes in Creative Labs
Soundblaster 16 kits?  The FAQ says that linux like SCSI CD-ROM drives 
better than proprietary drives.

Subject: Keybindings under bash, X and emacs??
Date: 19 Aug 1993 15:57:32 +0200

Hi Linuxers!

Since I have nowhere read about a real working solution, I post it
here. Most people (using LinuX and therefore IBM keyboards)
seem to prefer sequences like Ctrl-a / Ctrl-e and the like
to the 'home' and 'end' keys. Since I was (and am enforced to
stay) a DOS user, this is very annoying! Secondly it is a waste
of time and resources to have to remember ten or so configurations
for different editors/shells and so on different OS.
DOS is not a real OS like LinuX -- but at least a **user standard**
many people got used to.

Now the problem: Using bash in text mode is o.k.
Somewhere I found a bashrc-file with all the necessary functionality
as described above. But this does *not* work with 'xterm -e bash&'.
The cursor keys work, but the 'home'/'end' and the 'delete'/'insert'
keys do not work at all. Using 'emacs' to get the keysyms (and
configuring that beast too) even enlarges the problem:
In text mode (console) the 'home'/'end' keys are described as
'kp-1' and 'kp-7' (using Ctrl-h k), but under X windows they
are described as 'home'/'end'!
Well! I tried 'emacs -nw' under X to get the real difference
between text and X window mode. But now things really went strange:
'home'/'end' and 'insert' are described as 'ESC O C-@ is undefined'
(all three with this **same** code!), the META key is not recognized
(it works as expected if I start emacs without ' -nw'),
shift and control modifiers don't work with the function
or cursor keys (same behavior as in text mode).

Can anybody out there tell me how to configure it in the right
and consistent way?
I tried to modify the termcap entries for xterm by copying
other 'kh'/'kH'/'kD' entries from other terminal descriptions,
but that did not work.

Please Email me your solutions or suggestions. I will summarize
what I get and email to anybody, who is interested -- if I get
a useful answer at all. If my question is stupid and I have
only overlooked something -- please tell me.

I'm using SLS 1.03 on an ISA 486 DX50 board. And the linux-0.99.12
kernel.

Thanx for any comment

Ah, but what if Bill and his lawyers patent the whole shebang?  (Or,
better, patent the process of loading their binary?)  In fact, to take
this sillyiness one step further, They (as in Those Of Them That Are
Not Us) could simply patent the process of hacking.  That way, the
entire Linux community would have to pay Bill a License Fee to change
anything in any program.

Now, _that_ should spur the interest of the commercial developers! :-)
