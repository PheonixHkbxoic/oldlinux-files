I'm just updated to SLS 1.03 and I need to an uncompressed kernel image
to use for bootlin. How can I uncompress the zImage file in the root
directory? Can this be done without the kernel source?

Subject: IEC-Bus Driver for LINUX ??
Date: 2 Sep 1993 16:08:10 GMT

I want to install Linux on a PC in our laboratory. This PC
should controll the whole experimental setup via IEC-Bus 
(same as IEEE488-Bus). Is there any way to get Linux to work
with a IEC-Bus System (interface-cards, drivers, etc.)?
I know this question is quite unspecific, but I would like
to hear everything about this subject.

Thanks and bye

Subject: STB VL-24 Problems with clock ???.
Date: Thu, 2 Sep 1993 16:04:32 GMT

I got my STB VL-24 leaving a trail of noise behind as I move a window
in Windoze. A few similar problems with XS3. I though this was the 
result of adapter RAM getting cached, as is there in FAQ somewhere.
When I tried tech support STB, they told me that its a problem with
the card itself. When I asked for summary of the problem, I was
told that the clock on the board ran too fast. 

1.) Has anyone heard this problem before ? Not me. How many such cards
have gone out ? Whats the probability of getting another defective card.
I ask because STB is not willing to allow me retain this card till I get
a replacement. But the system vendor is. STB claims that the system vendor
may end up giving another defective card.
2) Wouldnt it have damaged my monitor ?

Thankx for any info.

Cheers,
Prabhat.

Subject: Problem,dip, for SLIP, config requested.
From: gujya@lilac (nilesh patel)
Date: 2 Sep 93 11:55:21 EST

        I have some problem with my dip. I downloaded NET-2 from tsx-11.mimt.edu
        2-3 days ago. I configured and recompiled the kernel for SLIP.
        While bootup, the system says : SLIP version 0.7.5 Ok

        when I try to start dip in test mode, this is what I get.
        $ dip -t
        (none): Host name lookup failure

        I am attaching my /etc/rc.net file ( I have SLS version of linux)

        $ cat /etc/rc.net
        #!/bin/sh
        # rc.inet1: configure the network interface

        HOSTNAME=`hostname`

        # Attach the loopback device. 
        /etc/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1  
        /etc/route add 127.0.0.1

        # IF YOU HAVE AN ETHERNET CONNECTION, use these lines below to configure the 
        # eth0 interface. If you're only using loopback or SLIP, don't include the
        # rest of the lines in this file.



        So, can anybody tell me what is wrong or missing in my configuration.
        Or, what additional info I should post. 

        I have a 2400 baud modem on cua0 which works fine with kermit.

        The address of my SLIP server is 131.183.1.203

        I do not know if it is static or dynamic.

        YES. I have gone through NET-2-HOWTO

  Yes it is.. That's the wonder with SCSI..  You can run SCSI and any 
other form factor.. They use different BASE addresses.. IDE, RLL, MFM, and
ESDI all use the same base address, but SCSI is different.. SCSI also doesn't
use the BIOS on the Motherboard, which is another Plus in my eyes..

  I think the problem is that the path is incorrect..  I had the same 
problem with I first installed tcsh, but didn't have time to look at it
I would be interested in hearing the solution, so I could fix it myself.
I also don't have access to a lot of other commands as well..

I've read the handful of FAQlists I've found and have been
reading this list for a few weeks, but haven't yet discovered the
location of any FAQs pertaining to hardware. 

More specifically, I'm currently in the market for a new machine
(which of course will run Linux) and would like to be able to go
shopping with specs in hand.

If there is (are) FAQ(s) that would help out, could someone
please point me to them.

One qualification: this system (Freenet) does not permit me
telnet or FTP. However I can use FTPmail if the site is
compliant. 


Thanks for your support.

  This is inaccurate. On my system, (Gateway 486/33, ISA), the QIC-02
driver works fine with a QIC-36 card and Wangtek 5150EN. No SCSI needed. 
I don't understand the QIC interfaces well enough to explain why this is
an expected result :^), but I was told by "people who know" that the
combination should work. And it did.

Greetings, all.

I just recently found a tape backup system in an old 286 system I bought
(used).  It's an Everex EV-811 Rev b tape backup controller paired with a
Teac MT-2ST/45D-68-U tape drive.  It had two tapes with it.  First, are
these supported by Linux.  Secondly, what are the compatable with (QIC-02, 
etc.).  Also, does anyone have MS-DOG software for this pair, or can suggest a
public domain or shareware ftp-able program that use these...

Subject: Help with SLS 1.03 w/in2000 and 3c503
Date: 2 Sep 1993 20:41:05 GMT

OK, I must just be unlucky! I have two systems I'm trying to run SLS 1.03 on
and neither fully works.

System 1: In2000 SCSI controller. I have both the precompiled kernel and one
I compiled with the latest drivers. On both booting with root set to the 
hard drive reboots the system! I can mke2fs and copy files to it fine, I 
just can't get root from it. I've spent at least 60 hours trying to get this 
to work with no luck.

System 2: This should be an easy one. Trying to get it on the network with a
3c503. I can't even get the kernel to spit out the config message at boot
time. The SLS install kernel seems to see it and autoconfigure fine. But my
recompiled kernel seems to skip right over it at boot time. I'm sure I
configured and built the kernel properly, but I must be missing something.
Got about 40 hours into this one.

Any words of wisdom would sure be appreciated!

Reply-To: ngai@apostle.bellcore.com

[Sorry if you have seen this message already. I forget to write the subject
line in my first attempt......]

I am trying to compile and install epoch-4.2 on my newly installed SLS-1.03.
Since the current epoch binary on tsx-11.mit.edu (and sunsite.unc.edu) was
linked with older libraries, I can no longer run it under SLS-1.03. So I 
ftp'ed the epoch source from ftp.uu.net. After some trial and error, I managed
to compile epoch correctly with CANNOT_DUMP defined. And epoch runs well and
correctly.

However, I am unable to get epoch to dump its preloaded core so that it won't
have to reload everything every time when I start it up. The core that I get
after undefining CANNOT_DUMP always core dump on me (sorry if this is a bit
confusing, but you will know what I mean if you have tried compiling epoch by
yourself...) I suspect this has something to do with the fact that the epoch 
source was written without knowledge of Linux's shared library convention.
So when it attempts to dump an executable core, it failed. 

So what do I need to modify/define in order to make epoch dump an executable
core? Please help. Email reply is preferable.

Thank you very much.

Office Depot has them for $35.  But, what sounds like the right

reasonable.  I have bought a lot of floppy disks from them and their
prices are reasonable on them as well ($.30/each, qty 50 for 5.25" HD
and $.50 each for 3.5"hd at qty 25).  They are in Columbus, Ohip and
their number is 800-634-3478.  They have no other number (other than a
FAX) so my guess is they don't want to deal with overseas orders.

You might have a bit of a problem.  Last time I checked (about a month
ago) Diamond cards are not and cannot be supported by Linux because of
management decisions at Diamond.  I assume you have gotten it up and
running at 640x480.  That's basic VGA, and most cards support it the
exact same way, but above that it becomes different, and different cards
don't act the same way.

my bet is that if you want to run it at higher resolutions than 640x480,
you are going to have to get a new card.

Anybody out there that knows I am wrong please correct me. Thanks
