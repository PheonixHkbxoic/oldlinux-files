If anyone out there has the clock and timings for this combination
of graphics card (TVGA8900B) and monitor (AT&T CRT-365), I'd really
appreciate them. I'm particularly interested in the 1024x768 mode.

Thanks, Sy

I do not have /bin/reset since I am not relying on the SLS. Please, please,
I just gave a "homebrew" answer to a problem, not knowing about the new
SLS goodies.
 
 As far as I am concerned, my method is better, since it uses existing

Folks, I still think though that the original poster had an valid
point: will Linux ever be accessible to those outside of the CS circle.
 
 He was asking for "philosophy student-proof" installation instructions,
and you started throwing Unix-for -Dummies book titles at him.
 
 I am a philosopher myself, and I really think no one should be allowed
to wield power over technology who cannot pass a course in literary
criticism. 
 The Linux system administrator's guide (SAG) was a very good first
step in making Linux more accessible, but it is in .ps format, and how
do you expect someone coming to Linux from the PC world to be able
to read .ps if they don't even know what a compiler is ?
Sure, Linux isn't for everyone, but if someone is smart enough to have
heard of Linux in the DOS world, they will be smart enough to learn Linux
_provided_ they are shown the ropes to make the first couple moves.
 There is much that is arcane and intimidating to a newbie, for example,
they have to repartition their hard drive, etc., so at least there should
be a very "handholding" manual explaining things step-by-step, with
as little techie jargon as possible. You all had your initiation to Un*x,
and I am more than sure that you appreciated straight talk when you were
learning Un*x.

  3. I tried to find through the FAQs times and times..nothing about that

  Could any of you, experienced players, tell me what's wrong with my mouse?

Well, perhaps a better alternative would be to type "echo ^V^O".

This works everywhere I have tried it for messed up xterms +

Hey Vince,

        One better, use LILO.  Roth, in your LILO config file, just tell
        LILO where your Linux is, hdb, and it will boot just nicely.  It
        will work; for I have MS-DOG 6.0 on disk 1 {hda} and Linux
        0.99pl12 on disk two {hdb}.  It works great.  MS-DOG doesn't
        recognize my Linux disk, but Linux accesses my MS-DOG disk just
        fine.  Here's my LILO config file:

boot = /dev/hda
install = /etc/lilo/boot.b
compact
image = /Image 
        vga=-1
        label = linux
        root = /dev/hdb1
other = /dev/hda1
        label = msdog
        table = /dev/hda

        Hope this really helps...

        Sorry Vince I just couldn't resist.  Note: Both Vince's and my
        day jobs take place in the same test lab.

  I'm trying to find a PC based UNIX which will satisfy the
following requirements.

 1. PC based 32 bit O/S, POSIX compliant
 2. Supports TCP
 3. Supports X.25
 4. Supports 3270:
        a. pretends to be a terminal to talk to a mainframe
        b. talks to terminals, acts like a mainframe
 5. Supports 2780, talks to terminals only

  Any combination of o/s and third party software and hardware
will be considered if they meet this requirement set. We would
*really* like to get this application off of DOS!!

I removed some lines from the lex source ...  Finally I got it compiled.
Unfortunately xboard hangs when trying to make some moves on the board.

Any help would be welcome ...

I have SLS 1.01 -> 1.03 (partly upgraded)
gcc 2.4.5, gas 2.1.1
linux 0.99 pl 11
shlibs v 4.4.1
flex version 2.3.8
gnuchess-4.0.pl62.tgz
xboard-2.1.pl11.tgz

Same with an older xboard version (pl10).

Thanks in advance

Yes, I agree.  My question is the reverse: Will those outside
the "CS circle" gain enough knowledge to use Linux?  Or will the
"CS circle" expand to include everyone?

Sorry about that.  I was merely thinking that unix, in general, is 
a beast even if Linux were fixed up to be "philosophy student-proof".
I was trying to give pointers to ways to increase the knowledge base
of the general public.  I feel strongly that if you want to know
about something, you have to go out and do it yourself.  Asking
questions, and reading are good ways to learn.  There are other
sources about computers/operating systems/technology besides the
Linux community.  I was trying to be helpful.

True enough.  But the guide is also available in text mode.  (Besides,
one could always go to the bookstore and read up about postscript. :-)! )
I think it would be great if the guide could be published on paper, 
and sold for a modest fee.  (Once it's finished)  Just watching my
printer churn out 150+ pages was painful.  I have gladly paid $10-15 to
get a pre-printed copy mailed to me.

Agreed.  And the comments of the first person are very welcome, and
have already influenced people responsible for writing documentation
I'm sure.

Well, the way I learned was to backup my hard disk, and try, try , try.
There was nobody around to hold my hand.  I originally learned unix
on a Convergent Technologies (defunct now) Miniframe.  The information
supplied by the vendor was hopelessly incomplete.  (They never thought
that anyone would want to purchase Seagate disk drives on the street
for a 10th the price they were asking. :-))  So, therefore, everyone
else should suffer my pain.  NOT!

The point is, this stuff is complicated, and there should be a step-by-
step guide, and mostly there already is for Linux.  The techincal jargon
creeps in because that is how we talk.  What is needed now is for people
like you that have learned the hard way, but can speak in non-jargonese,
to write manuals.  

I send my apology to the group in general for taking an article with
the name "Tractatus Linuxicus Newbius" and having a little fun with 
it.

Subject: [Q] Help needed with gcc-2.4.5
Date: 20 Aug 93 14:00:54 GMT


I have installed gcc-2.4.5 from tsx-11 site and to try it the first
thing I did was to compile the 0.99.10 kernel source, but ... yes it
compiles evething but fails when linking, the message is : -m486
invalid option and then gives me all the valid options for "ld".

        The point is that I did compiled the same sources with the
same config using gcc-2.4.3 and had no problems.

        Before posting I tried:

        - alias "gcc" to "gcc -V 2.4.3" -> didn't work
        - rename the 0.99.10 and install a brand new 0.99.11 -> nop
        - Answer yes at the configuration for 486 code -> didn't work

        Yes, I did started from scratch with make make dep ; make
clean after the configuration.

        If somebody out there can help me I would appreciate, please
send your reply to this newsgroup or via email as I don't have access
to the new comp.os.linus.* yet.

        Thanks a lot,

Remember that, if it's on a second controller (e.g. mine is on an AHA1542B)
the BIOS must be *enabled* or LILO will hang trying to access it, because LILO
has to use the BIOS for I/O.

Any cacheing scheme has pathological cases where the result is actually slower
than direct I/O.  For Linux the pathological case is iozone... a sequential
write of a large file followed by a sequential read of the same file, if it's
larger than the cache, results in Linux having to force cache writes so that
there are enough free blocks to read into.
