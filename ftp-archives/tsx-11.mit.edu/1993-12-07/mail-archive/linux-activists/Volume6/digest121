Subject: Prog. in C for Linux = ??
Date: Sun, 15 Aug 1993 20:17:00

I'm a pretty respectable C programmer for MessDOS stuff and
embedded systems, but don't know how to write programs for
Linux (or other *nix) systems.

Can anyone offer suggestions for books to buy and read that
will explain the ins and outs of this?

I need things like where to put stuff (e.g. sources here, .h
files there, libs over there), how to use make and the
structure of the makefile (I typically use that Borland C++
IDE crutch so don't know the structure of the typical
makefile, and the times I have used make, the makefiles were
all different) ... also need info on *nix library calls and
such.

I need this for general information, but for short term
needs ... I have my DOS BBS connected to the Linux box
through serial ports, and I want to set it up so that
someone can telnet in and access the BBS through the serial
port.  This involves writing a program that is executed from
a login shell (I also don't know how to write login shells
but have some books that will probably teach me that) that
will signal the BBS, respond while the BBS (which thinks it
is talking to a modem) answers, then ties BBS and caller
together.  As such, this program will have to act like a
modem ... e.g. toggle the Ring Detect line, look for the ATA
from the BBS (on this system the BBS takes care of taking
the modems off-hook, the modems do not auto-answer), then
raise Carrier Detect and complete the connection.

So, I need enough info (from books or wherever) to enable me
to write this program and make it work under Linux.

Please respond either here or (preferably) by e-mail to
epoole@leotech.mv.com, and I'll summarize any e-mailed
responses.

Thanks ...

Well, I was really thinking of dump for a tape backup... Can you really backup
anything 100+ meg to floppies?  I haven't backed up to floppies since all I had
was a 20 meg drive to backup... :-)  And now I'm nearing 1 gig...  No floppies

I hope this question isn't in the FAQL...

Is there a boot manager available that allows booting from the 2nd HDD?  I
am about to buy a new system with a 210MB HDD which I would like to use for
DOS.  I have a 40MB that I will be installing in it as the 2nd HDD that I
would like to use for Linux.

Any info would be appreciated...

I agree that this whole flamewar is basically moot.  People are going
to use what they like to use, and if they're lucky, they're going to
keep an open mind about other tools.  

I've not learned TeX yet, although I'd like to.  I use WordforWin for
most of my schoolwork, and I use it like this:  I write the whole
document in a basic font, such as Times 12, and then go back and
modify the fonts, weights, etc., when I'm done.  I like being able to
see how the document is basically going to look as I'm writing; I like
to "drag and drop" (yeeck) tables and fill them in using the TAB key
to switch from field to field.  It's just more convienent right now. 

And as for the comments about people who use WYSIWIG document prep
tools, well, I've got 6 Tau Bates and an entire group inside of
Motorola Cellular who prefer Interleaf over TeX for their product
manuals.  IQ< 120?  Couldn't fathom geometry?  As Wayne|Garth would
say, "NOT!".  (Speaking of people who couldn't fathom geometry ;-)

What I don't understand is this need for people to compare Linux with
SCO/WNT/BSD/etc. in a "mine's better than yours" attitude.  Why did
the comparison with SCO even come up?  And why this attitude about
Linux becoming a commercial competitor?  I don't think that Linus's
motivation for creating Linux was to create something that was ing to
go head-to-head with commercial OSs (although I can't speak for him);
I think he just wanted to see if he could do a Unix of his own that
would be a very quality OS that he and other people could use.  

But flame away.  It's entertaining to watch.

I recently (2 hours ago :)  obtained the SLS 1.03 release and am
interested in making Linux my only operating system.  However, I still
have a lot of DOS apps I want to run.  So...  Naturally, I have a few
questions about dosemu.

1.) Does dosemu want your DOS apps on a separate DOS partition or can they
be on the Linux partition?

2.) How stable is dosemu?  Will it run smoothly and not crash on most
programs?

3.) Is it difficult to set up?

4.) What kinds of stuff have you gotten to run under dosemu?

5.) Can text-based apps be run on remote dumb terminals?

Thanks.  E-mail preferred.

BTW... Where can I find the FAQ on tsx-11?

        I would guess it's a permissions problem.  Users have to 
have write access to create or write files or directories. As root,
try making a temporary directory in your root dir.  Then do
a "chmod a+rwx" on it.  Then try making some files here as 
another user.

Example:
        mkdir /tmp0
        chmod a+rwx /tmp0

        If this works, I'd recommend that you get a general unix book
and read a little more on the general aspects of a unix file system.
You can also checkout the chmod man page.

        It could also be a quota problem.  I didn't think it was
implemented in linux yet, but it is possible to limit the amount of
space each user can have on the disk.  I would assume root would be
immune to any quotas.

1. SCO 3.2.2 is 3 or 4 years old.  They are now up to 3.2.4.2 and ODT is
   up to 3.0.

2. Use rcc instead of cc.  Microsoft C sucks!

Or, you could just compile xv instead. 3.00 compiled almost entirely clean,
just change ~/xv-3.00/jpeg/RANLIB.csh and ~/xv-3.00/tiff/RANLIB.csh to do a 
pure "ranlib libjpeg.a" and "ranlib libtiff.a" respectively. Oh, and obviously
modify the master Makefile for gcc, including whatever options you want (I
tried -funroll-loops , but I can't tell if it made a difference).

Works great.

        I always thought that 3.5 drives rotate at 250rpm= 5 rev/s.
There are 18 sectors/track. ie 90 sectors/sec .  therefore the transfer
rate is 512*90 = 50KBytes/s (aprox.). Negligable as far as DMA latency goes.  I
see no conflict in the refresh DMA(ch0, highest priority) leading to
'byte' robbing of the FDC DMA, even with no buffering on the FDC.  Ie
2 Competing DMA channels * 1uS/transfer << 1/50KBytes/s.  How else can a
IBM PC(4.77MHz) work with a FDC?
        As stated, DMA on post-IBM AT class machines doesnt exist, the
memory controller subsystem does it transperantly.  Get a refresh
tweaking program or disable the refresh channel on the 8254 and your
computer wont crash.  Test the CPU landmark speed, you'll see no
difference (try it, i havent, should be interesting).
        Lets face it, the architecture works (except for some CT
chipsets that have buggy 16 bit DMA, which doesnt concern the FDC).
        In general, hardware is the natural scape-goat to blame for
software bugs.  Even if there was a problem, i wouldnt change the DMA
setup given all the near-8237 chipset clones floating out there, just to
much incompatibility to risk anything that isnt cosher IBM BIOS.

To avoid any misunderstandings about the 3c503, I'll clarify a few points:
        The 3c503 does not have "EEPROM setup", so the diagnostic/setup
        program isn't needed before running the card with Linux.
        (Some other ethercards do have EEPROM setup, and you may have to
        run their MS-DOS EEPROM setup program if you don't like the defaults.
        Linux has a released version of 'wdsetup', and alpha versions of
        3c509 and NE2000+ setup programs.)

        The shared memory address of the 3c503 is set using jumpers that
        are shared with the boot PROM address.  This is confusing to people
        familiar with other ISA cards, where you always leave the jumper
        set to "disable" unless you have a boot PROM.

        The IRQ line is set in software, with no hints from e.g. EEPROM.
        Unlike the MS-DOS driver, the Linux driver has capability to autoIRQ:
        it uses the first available IRQ line in {5,2,3,4}, selected
        each time the card is 'ifconfig'ed.  (Older driver versions selected
        the IRQ at boot time.)  The ioctl() call in 'ifconfig' will return
        EAGAIN if no IRQ line is available at that time.

        The Linux 3c503 driver will with the 3c503 programmed-I/O mode, but
        this is slower and less reliable than shared memory mode.
