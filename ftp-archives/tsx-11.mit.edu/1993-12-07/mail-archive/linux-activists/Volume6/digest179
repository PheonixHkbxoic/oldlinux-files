For me that would be a 'biggie'.  Are you saying that the Cyrix, since

the Cyrix doesn't have an integrated FPU, so if Linux detects it as a 486,
but doesn't see that it is missing an FPU, that's not _that_ of a big
deal.)

I assume you mean the Intel EtherExpress.
No, there isn't a driver.
No, I don't think anyone is seriously working on one.

 A far better solutions is:

 time dd if=/dev/sd?  of=/dev/null bs=1b   count=10000
 time dd if=/dev/sd?  of=/dev/null bs=100b count=100
 time dd if=/dev/rsd? of=/dev/null bs=1b   count=10000
 time dd if=/dev/rsd? of=/dev/null bs=100b count=100

 You'll then get 4 time-tables which will show, who's the culprit;
 either caching or the filesystem-code by using either, both or
 none of 'em.

 IOzone is quite a rough measurement utility just good enough to do
 rough comparisions of different O.S's or disks.

Subject: [Q] How do you dial out from Linux?
Date: Sat, 28 Aug 1993 03:32:44 GMT


I have Linux SLS 1.03 running on my IBM ValuePoint and am
trying to dial out using my modem using 'cu'

Is there a better way?

How do I configure my system to accept the modem I am using and
the paramters I need to use?

Do I need source for Taylor UUCP 1.04 to do this? ( Ican't find the sources
if they are already on my system)

I looked in the Linux FAQ for infor, but couldn't seem to find it...is
there any documentation on this stuff?

Thanks in advance

I'm just a newbie with linux (nearly 2 weeks of exposure to it!), but...

In the SLS 'a2' comm.tgz file, you'll find 'minicom', which reminds me a lot
of the DOS program ProComm in style.  A lot more spartan, but works.  This is
better than 'cu' but not sure if it meets your requirements.

There are docs in disk 'd2' on uucp.  Is that sufficient I wonder?

I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish here, but with only 8mb
total memory, it's not surprising that gcc crashes, unless it's changed
in the last couple of releases, Linux is very testy about low memory
situations, so I'd give it lots more swap and see if you stop locking
up, gcc can use loads of memory at times.

Howdy,

        I'm encountering a small problem with my scrolling.  It seems
that occasionaly (usually after a vi or more), my terminal will only
scroll data through the bottom-most line of the terminal, without
advancing any of the 23 lines above it  --  I essentially will see
all output come an go on line 24.  I can do a 'clear', but when I
get to line 24, it screws up again.  I'm not sure if I have described
this well.  My video card is a 'noname' - no information of 
compatibility on the card, the book that came with the pc, and nothing
displayed upon bootup.  I'm running Slackware 0.99.12 on a 386SX-16 
clone.  Any advice appreciated.  Thanks.

Subject: large file printing problems with lpr
From: v61u0005@diamond.sara.nl (Gert van der Zwan)
Date: 27 Aug 93 11:03:01 +0200

Keywords: 
I have problems printing large files with lpr (large = larger than 1 page)
over the net. apparently the problem is with sending the file to the print server
since doing 'netstat' i keep getting the message SYNC-SENT, only occasionally
i get ESTABLISHED , but this is immediately followed by SYNC-SENT again. 
Doing netstat -x gives "SEGMENTATION FAULT' . ftp-ing the files to another
site, and printing from there to the same printer works well (using AIX lpr).
It is not a size limitation in the spool directory, i put a mx#0 in the
printcap file. I am using linux 0.99.11 and NET-2 software. 
lpc status usually gives: queuing enabled, printing enabled, sending to -
printer server-, 1 entry in spool area.  killing the process , emptying the queu
and restarting sometimes helps, once every 10 times or so the file gets through.

any suggestions as how to solve this by email please.

I really hate to get this even a smidge back towards the topic at hand but...
Does Linux currently support the 1540B.  What is the difference between a 
1540 and a 1542 (does the 1540 simply lack the floppy controller?).

I have had the Ygdrasill CD and a Texel for a couple of months and no chance 
to use it since I lack a support SCSI controller.  I've been waiting for a 
deal like this.  (Actually if someone has managed to hack the kernel to 
support the PSI caching SCSI adapter (no model number handy) that I'd be 
even happier to hear it).

So will the 1540B support Linux?
Has anyone used a PSI caching SCSI adapter with Linux?
(Has anyone used a Promise Technologies cachine IDE controller with Linux?)

(I will admit that I haven't FTP'd the hardware list since about 2 months 
ago).

I don't think NULL pointer works, but an empty string does under BSD.

Actually, this is something that BSD is supposed to have
