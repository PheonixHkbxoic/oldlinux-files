   That's not it. In a VT100 emulation, say kermit, you can't resize your
   window, the mouse does nothing on the remote machine and you can't open
   several xterms. Sure, you need to install a (tiny)x server on the remote
   system (but that's not a bad idea, I think).

Since Seyon uses XTerm basically as a vt100 terminal emulator, couldn't
xterm be modified in this case to send vt100 escape codes to move the
cursor and stuff like that?  It seems like it would be fairly easy to at
least provide a lisp package for emacs that could intercept some sort of
commands from a modified xterm to give at least partial mouse support.

        Unix crypt is an enigma-style rotor cipher (with the
corresponding "cbw", Crypt Breaker's Workshop, to crack at it...) The
/etc/passwd file uses something completely different: an iterated DES
using the password as the key (a strange sort of one-way hash.)

weren't very general :-) there's no need for them in a development

well, the 386bsd 0.0 and 0.1 ash (I don't know how much it has been

that reminds me, is there a program that does direct scsi control? for
example, I'm told that scsi format is done by sending a single byte to
the device and it formats itself. There is an ioctl in the scsi driver
for doing such arbitrary control (at least from my reading of the
driver sources) but is there a nice tool already written to manipulate
it?

The networking and routing work fine in pl12 - I've had a lot of mails
about it failing, but so far they have always been due to bad setup.
Things to check:

 - when adding network routes, the network address must be in
   /etc/networks, or 'route' will add a host route instead which won't
   do you much good.  If you have a B-class address that is subnetted to
   C-class, this means you'll have to have the 4.4.2 libs (in 1.03 SLS,
   I understand) or hardcode it in the 'route' binary. 

   To see if a route entry is a network route or a host route, check the
   'FLAGS' field of the 'route' output: it should contain a 'N' or a 'H'
   to indicate which it is. 

 - when adding a gateway route, you have to add the route to get to the
   gw machine correctly first.. 

Then for an example: You have a network IP address of 140.78.65.10,
which is a B-class net address, but your network is subnetted to
C-class, so your netmask is 255.255.255.0, and your broadcast address is
140.78.65.255. 

Set up with (comment out your old rc.net and do this by hand at bootup
so that you can try and see which commands get errors etc):

  /etc/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
  /etc/route add 127.0.0.1

(checkpoint: if your /etc/networks has a 127.0.0.1 entry, remove it, as
this time we are trying to add a host route). 

  /etc/ifconfig eth0 140.78.65.10 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 140.78.65.255
  /etc/route add 140.78.65.0

(checkpoint: check that you have the 140.78.65.0 network in your
/etc/networks, that you have libc-4.4.2, and that the route that got
added has the 'N' flag set when you do just a '/etc/route'). 

Now, assume that you have a gateway at address 140.78.65.1 that handles
all the communications to outside this net:

  /etc/route add default gw 140.78.65.1

and you should hopefully be all set.  Note that the above route won't
work if the previous network route didn't get set up correctly.  I have
gotten one mail that indicates that if several gateways are set up, the
routes will get incorrectly ordered, and that removing and re-adding the
base route may help (ie "/etc/route del 140.78.65.0 ; /etc/route add
140.78.65.0" to get the normal network routes first in the list.  This
is a kernel bug if so).

(checkpoint: '/etc/route -n' gives, note the 'N'/'H' in Flags):

Destination net/address   Gateway address           Flags RefCnt    Use Iface
default                   140.78.65.1               UGN        0      0 eth0
140.78.65.0               *                         UN         0      9 eth0
127.0.0.1                 *                         UH         0     16 lo

and '/etc/ifconfig' gives:

lo        IP ADDR 127.0.0.1  BCAST 127.255.255.255  NETMASK 255.0.0.0
          MTU 2000  METRIC 0  POINT-TO-POINT ADDR 0.0.0.0
          FLAGS: 0x0049 ( UP LOOPBACK RUNNING )

eth0      IP ADDR 140.78.65.10  BCAST 140.78.65.255  NETMASK 255.255.255.0
          MTU 1500  METRIC 0  POINT-TO-POINT ADDR 0.0.0.0
          FLAGS: 0x0043 ( UP BROADCAST RUNNING )


Note that I have not been able to test much of the above, but it should
work (and it does work for several users).  Also note that if things
don't work, it doesn't help just to say so: at the very minimum we'd
need to know what the output of 'ifconfig' and 'route' are, and what you
are trying to do (use 'route -n' to get the routes in numerical form, as
any names are probably less than useful for others).

Reply-To: ajt@rri.sari.ac.uk

I have SLS 1.03 running now on my 386DX/40 with ext2 filesystems and they
appear to be ok *BUT* I had great difficulty at first with a root partition
one cylinder less than or one cylinder more than 16384K ...

mke2fs reported that it was unable to allocate a block for the bit map and
behaved all together like there was a bad block on the disk.  I tested the
disk with all the hd utilities I could muster and there is nothing wrong
with it (100Mb Quantum ProDrive) and exactly the same problem occured on
another disk (200Mb WD Caviar).

Making a filesystem of 16384K worked fine, but 16386K failed: moving on by
two cylinders and mke2fs worked again.  All the larger filesystems were
created without error, but I didn't check for multiples of 16386K or other
powers of two.

Has anyone else encountered this?  My systems all e2fsck cleanly and the
system appears to be working ok, but this thread made me nervous ;-)

I beg to differ on the clock speed.  I have an OAK 037 256K, and I use a 32.5
clock speed.  But still only on X386mono, though I've heard that Xfree1.3
supports more chipsets, including the OAK, but I haven't been able to confirm
this.

libc-4.4.1 works fine.  Get the sources for libc-4.4.1 and tools-2.7.5
edit the file ./libc-linux/inet/inet_net.c on line 108 it says
#if 1
change it to

Well, the problem is with LynxOS, not with having too powerful a machine.
That setup will work fine for most of the OS's related to the groups you
cross posted to.  LynxOS is a _Unix-like_ Operating System that was designed
to function real-time from the ground up.  These guys have to write their own
drivers for everything...they can't just steal the examples from USL (er, 
now USG) and port them right over.  It's no wonder than they're having 
trouble keeping up with some of the new stuff.

Give it some time.  Talk to Lynx about it.

To harp on "modern," it should be pointed out that modern Unices usually
demand-page their executables.  If the test portion of the code were not
used, then it wouldn't be paged in.  But if you do need the test code, and
it's sequestered in some external program, then you have to fork() and exec(),
which is much slower than simply memory-faulting the code in.

 My point, exactly.


Nice thought, but you're dreaming. There will be no devastation. There
will be no $2,000,000 checks (at least not to Linus). Linux may someday
offer the features that the original poster asked for (non-cs oriented
documentation and sufficient precompiled tools for "joe user" to type
"install" and do useful work) and those discussed in the "When can we
expect Linux 1.0" thread (ELF, COFF, WABI, etc - too run 'off-the-shelf'
applications necesary to give Linux any kind of mass appeal). I, for one,
welcome the day and would gladly use it personally. Though, with the
GPL's floating around I doubt I could comfortably use it for 
development. I appreciate the efforts of the authors of such code but
have to make a living and it's not worth risking getting sued by the   
'Free' Software Foundation over the accicental inclusion of some code
fragment (eg bison.*) in a project that is not freely distributable. 

The >$2,000,000 checks, however, go and continue to go to Microsoft's 
hype extravaganza machine. The american public has demonstrated time and
again its suceptibility to a well orchestrated ad-campaign. Microsoft 
has demonstated with NT its ability to play the same public like a cheap
violin and have them salivating for a non-existant product and keep them
on the line through months of delayed releases. Windoze 3.0 was a bug 
riddled horror show but it spread like a bad rash, NT is late, buggy and
slow but people still haven't caught on. (not to mention *how many*
people are *still* using dos?)

Sad as it is, people 'buy' (ie. make choices, doesn't matter if one of
the options is free) based on their perceptions not on established facts,
and perceptions are easiliy influenced (witness Microsoft/NT). Media (
print/radio/television) is enormously powerful, and expensive. Microsoft
has the capital to wield the media to tremendous advantage. Linux may
well be the technically superior option someday (please no 'What do you
mean *someday*?! Linux still lacks important features mentioned above)
but people need to be *convinced* of that to use it. It wont matter that
its free, they will have to *perceive* it as the best option. What's to
convince them? Who will foot the advertising bill? (someone mentioned 
"I can see 10,000 people give linux to 100 friends...", I think we all
(almost) know things don't work that except in pyramid marketing sales
seminars.) It wont happen through Usenet. Usenet is a valuable forum
but its caters to a fairly restricted audience. Bill Gates probably
doesn't read this newsgroup but if he does, I'm sure it's for entertain-
ment purposes. We may someday be priveleged to witness the 'desolation
of the abomination', but I doubt it will be brought on by Linux, and I
wont be holding my breath.

        geez...so the kernel just finally got to the point that you have
to do things the right way *sigh*

        all that has to be added is an extra route command and it is 
fine, as has been posted many time, I think...

        /etc/route add <network> <-- this is the required line
        /etc/route add default gw <gateway address>

MH still insists on using them in all its Makefiles if you configure it for
System V of any flavor.  Since that's what I used as a basis for the Linux
port, I had to provide dummy versions.

As for other uses:  lorder isn't very general at all, but I've used tsort to
build call trees (which is in fact how it was originally used) and once even
used it to create a quickie project-management shell script (had to reverse
the output... and no, the script is long since randomized bits).

I have the same problem.  Although I donot know the solution, I can get the
machine back by killing remote-shell (rsh) processes on the remote machines.
If there exist a 'rsh' process in a remote machine sending something to
my linux, my linux may hang in there.  Also, it seems to always hang when
I do the 2nd rsh on the same remote machine.   

Hope someone have good solution for this problem.
