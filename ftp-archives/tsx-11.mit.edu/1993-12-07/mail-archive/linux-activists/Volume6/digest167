  I am interested in how people make use of Linux in 'real world' applications.
Especially, what version they use, what 'extras' like TCP/IP, NFS, X, and the
stability of such systems. 

  I'm trying to build a case for giving it a look here at work...

  Please respond by email to bijohnson@goodyear.com.

Perhaps.  PCMCIA ethernet cards from D-Link and Socket Communications are
known to work.  I recommend D-Link, because they have been very helpful to
Linux developers; their number is (714) 455-1688, and they sell through
dealers.

I can't tell you whether IBM's ethernet card will work without having the card
to test, and I don't think anyone has approached IBM asking for documentation
or an evaluation unit yet.

Numerous people from this newsgroup have asked me to post here whenever I
find an excellent deal on something that might be of interest to the
general community.  I *DO NOT* intend to post items of this sort
regularly here.  Rather, I will usually post *ONLY* in the .forsale
newsgroups.  This is a worthy exception because it is an absolutely
awesome deal.

 (Please note that many people have already bought tape drives, CD-ROM drives,
 and modems from me.  I have a list of testimonies that I can
 E-mail to anyone on request.)

 Quite a few people have asked me if I can get any other equipment for
 the kind of prices I have been getting the tape drives, CD-ROM drives
 and modems for.  The most frequently asked for items have been SCSI
 controllers (to go with the tape and CD-ROM drives) and hard drives.
 (I now have some *BRAND NEW* Adaptec 1540B SCSI controllers for $125
 each.  I will be posting these to the .forsale newsgroups shortly;
 but if you want one you can call now.)  The following is an
 *EXTREMELY* good deal on some brand new 209 Meg Seagate SCSI hard
 drives. (Anything under a dollar a Meg is a good deal.  At .69 cents
 per Meg these are a steal!)

 The description follows:

 I have a few *BRAND NEW* 209 Meg Seagate SCSI hard drives.
 These drives went for $245.00 regularly.  I
 will give these 209 Meg drives away to anyone who wants one for $145.00 each 
 (THESE ARE BRAND NEW).  Call me immediately if you want one because I
 will give them out on a first come first serve basis and THEY WILL GO
 FAST.  If you think it is too late and they are already gone call anyway
 because your call will put you in line for one if I can get any more. My home
 phone number is (617) 246-3634.  My wife's name is Julie and she can take
 down your order info..  I am there in the evenings.  If neither of us
 is there you can leave a message on our machine and I will call you
 within hours of your leaving a message.  I will return *ALL* calls.
 If you can't reach me then send me E-mail reserving a drive and
 give me a phone number you can be reached at.
 Now you can afford a decent sized hard drive and *YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PAY
 ALOT FOR IT!!!*

 These are Seagate ST-2209N SCSI Hard Drives.  They were manufactured
 by SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY and they are high quality drives.
 These drives are internal 5 1/4" Half Height Drives.  They
 are vastly superior to most of the non-SCSI hard drives out there.
 They will work with *ANY* SCSI controller.

 These Seagates are brand new, still in the box, and come with
 *EVERYTHING*. They come with docs, and everything necessary for installation. 
 It is a complete package.  When you get your drive you will have all that you
 need to use it.  They are 100% guaranteed for 30 days.  If you get one
 and you don't like the way it matches your wallpaper simply return it
 for your money back *NO QUESTIONS ASKED*!

 I repackaged my Seagate, went to UPS, weighed the package, and found out
 the cost of S&H.  I asked them for worst case S&H in the continental
 U.S. (i.e., California).  S&H with insurance for $350.00 plus tracking
 would cost $10.00 from Boston to California.  That is what I will
 charge everyone for S&H.

 These drives also work perfectly with Linux, BSD, and other Unices for the PC.


 I WILL GIVE THESE OUT ON A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS.  FROM MY
 EXPERIENCE IN THE PAST, MY E-MAIL WILL BE CRAZY!


 I may be able to take your credit card for these.  My home phone number is
 (617) 246-3634.  You can call me *ANYTIME* up until 2:00 AM seven days
 a week.  My wife, Julie, is home during the day (so she can take your
 order then) and I am home in the evenings.

 If you are going to pay with a check or money order:

 The total cost is:

 Seagate 209 Meg                                $145.00
 S&H                                            $ 10.00
                                             ------------
 TOTAL                                          $155.00

 In order to acquire a Seagate make your payment or money order for $155.00
 payable to:

 Dr. John V. Jaskolski

 send it to:

 jasko@park.bu.edu

 P.S.  The Specs follow:

 I am always looking for equipment that is dirt cheap.  I especially
 like prices that are around 50% less than the cheapest price around.
 I decided to go with these since the price is right (You
 can't get new 209 Meg SCSI hard drives *ANYWHERE* for $145.00).  They
 provide industry standard performance *AND* they work with everything.
 Also, these drives are *BRAND NEW*! No Non-SCSI hard drive even
 comes close to the quality of these drives.

I am a current Linux user who does not wish to copy 30 diskettes again!
I have SLS 1.02 now and want to install 1.03, but this time I would like to
put the SLS distribution which I retrieved via ftp, on my Sparc 2 at work,
onto a tape (QIC-150 format) and install the new SLS at home with this tape.
There is no mention of how to do this in the install-guide-1.0.txt.

CAN THIS BE DONE?

I know that I must still have disk a1 on a floppy to begin the installation
procedure. What must I do to put all of the other SLS disk directories and
their related files onto a tape? Do I just use tar? Do I put all files into
one directory then use tar? 

Help would be greatly appreciated.

I subscribe to something called "Processor", it's a weekly mag published

Date: 25 Aug 1993 16:03:53 GMT

       Hi, I've run into a slight, annoying problem that I'm hoping
there is a cheap solution. I'm running a 486-33 with a p10 kernel.
the problem is that i have a big time memory leak. I'm using, now
dont laugh, 8M of 100ns simms. I havent got the money to buy new
so these will have to do for a while at least. The problem is that
memory doesnt seem to be being freed up. With the free command, memory
used just goes up, never down. An example, after a reboot the other
day i went into kermit, messed around in there for an hour, shelled
out and did some stuff, checked free, and i was using over 6M memory.
If i run top or do a ps xaug it doesnt show any huge memory consuming
processes running. It just kind of disapears. As soon as i run out
of real memory and goto swapping, that seems to work fine. Swap memory
seems to be freeing up, real memory isnt. Any ideas? Am i screwed until
I win the lotery and can afford new simms? Any help appreciated!

The problem only occurs, if the "default" host/network name is routed,

Routing special hosts does not invoke problems.

Has anybody an idea, why routing and the gopherd could clash?

a new version of XFree that support either of these cards ? or is there

I wonder if Seagate is still in the practice of making "new" drives out of
old broken-down ones?  The short 30 day guarantee seems to suggest just that.

Is there a particular advantage to using the Eizo graphics card in this

The PS file printed fine on my NEC Model 95.  The look great.  It would
be nice to get these in a different format, say xfig or tgif, so I could
edit them and make addtional labels on my Linux box.  Also a 5 1/4 version
would be cool.  (I don't ask for much, do I?) :-)

Subject: HELP! newbie gets warning message "libc.so.4: incompat. minor ver no."

Thanks for your attention:

Yes, I am a newbie to linux.  My target platform is a AMD 386-40

I downloaded SLS 1.03 linux from wuarchive.  Due to some strangeness of
their automated installation, I was forced to manually install the basic
package.  Many of the programs in the OS work well, but a number of programs
crash and dump the core with the message:

lib.so.4: incompatible minor version numbers (DLL Jump4.4pl1)

Did I screw up the installation?  Where can I get the proper version
of this library?

regards,
--jeff
