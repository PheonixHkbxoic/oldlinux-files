Literary  critisism?  Hmm.
WOnder how many Unix Admin people are strictly Unix admin adn deal with people
that understand basic computing, and so can cope with hackerese ?

There are two sorts of people:
Those that can do
Those can can teach

(Note: regardless of the "fortune" quote, these groups are *NOT* exclusive.
People *can* do and teach at the same time).

Now, why should those people who "do" be forced to translate between current
technical "jargon" and a form that others can understand.  This would slow
down developement thousandfould (I don't exagerate!).  Where I work I have
to do both developement and teaching roles, and know that the teaching side
of things is soooooo slooooowww that if I had to deal in those terms almost
constantly no work would be done.

Jargon (ie those terms that would fail any course in literar criticsim) is
essential in any "deep knowledge" situation just to make people who have
"the knowledge" use that knowledge effectively.

After all, how many people have been to a car garage and understood exaclty
100% of what the mechanic has told you?  You may pretend or guess the meaning,
but this doesn't mean that you *do* know what they mean.

Hmm, not really linux based - more philosophy based :-)  oh well....

        At the outset, let me congratulate you for being the first
USENET poster to spell "Yggdrasil" correctly on the first try.

        Yggdrasil Computing, Inc. is alive and well and very busy.
We have sold about 3,100 LGX betas (not including freebies), which
I gather is about twice as many copies as Jana and SLS combined.
We have more than that number of advance orders for the first production
release, which will feature, among other things, a "fill in the blanks"
graphical user interface for doing things like installing an ethernet
card or a printer, plus support for almost every CDROM drive.

        You may not have heard much from Yggdrasil lately because
we've been busy trying to cut the first production release and also
doing other things to build company infrastructure in anticipation of
rolling out support services with the first production release.
For example, if all goes well, we will be moving into new offices
in the heart of silicon valley with a shared high speed internet
connection on September 1, at which time we will be able to set
up our own FTP site.   We will also soon have a 900 number for
general Linux support, including support for users of other
distributions and questions of a tutorial nature (e.g., "how do
I use this program?").  Also, We are in a unique position to offer
on-demand support services for hardware-related questions because
we've already invested in so much different PC hardware for testing.

        I hope that I have given you a reasonable sense of the
work that is going on at Yggdrasil right now.  To some extent all
of the Linux CDROM companies seem to be victims of their own
success.  It is a very challenging problem to transform a small
business into a serious company in the space of, say, 800 business
hours, while not ignoring the operation of the business during that
time or spending money beyond your means.  I think that I speak for
all of the Linux CD companies when I say that the quiet that you're
hearing does not mean that we've gone away.  It's more like the calm
before the storm.

This isn't really Linux specific, but I'd guess it'll do.

I would like to call a Linux/UNIX machine via modem, start a regular shell
script (.sh) and be able to hang up without the script beeing killed before
it's finished. Is this possible?

And some Linux-related questions:

Are there drivers for 3com 507 available?

How do I go about setting up TCP/IP? I've got a 3com 503 that I can use if
the 507 isn't supported, so that shouldn't be a problem.

    Exactly. In my comparisons, I even noted that the numbers I see for
performance under DOS for my Adaptec 1452b are similar, though slightly
higher. I'm curious, not whining. I'd be satisfied with some sort of
explanation, no specificly any promise of improvement. SO far, it seems
to me that the theoretical 5.7 meg/sec of the Adaptec is just that,
theory, and only a few people get even 1 meg/sec. 
    Again, on my ST, there was a program that bypassed the filesystem
completely to test raw disk i/o, and somehow they even made it
non-destructive so you didn't have to use a clean partition to do tests.
It seems there is no equivalent under *nix.

    I'm happy enough with performance, as the filesystem speed of even
the minix filesystem beats the crap out of the FAT based fiesystem on my
ST. news unbatching is probably 10x faster on my linux box than on my
ST. I won't even mention the difference in deletes on 100+ files.
    It is a bit mystifying to me that scsi, which I thought was supposed
to be superior to ide, gets lower numbers compared to a similar ide
drive though. I'd really like to see a comparion between 2 of the same
model drive, one scsi, one ide, like the Quantum 105 or a Maxtor.

Hello, I have a little problem with compiling programs under Linux version

of which I have gotten from sunsite.unc.edu. When I tried to make the Makefile
included in the programs, tonnes of error messages just poured out. Some of the
most frequently encountered ones include " parse error"and "undeclared but used
 ". I couldn't believe that so much errors could be generated because the
programs are supposed to be already thoroughly debugged and tested. I suspect
that certain files ( e.g *.h ) in my linux are corrupted. Anybody who has any
idea as to what is going on,please email to me or send replies thru' usenet.

You can contact them at info@infomagic.com... they have a number of
different CD's. One has 386BSD, NetBSD and Linux 0.99.10 on it. Another
is the Yggdrasil LINUX/GNU/X CD. The one I like reads as follows:

>SOURCE CODE cd-rom
>A wealth of source code including: the Berkeley Net/2 distribution (4.3BSD)

Of course, the MS-DOG and WINDOZE (NT) stuff I don't need, but the X11R5,
MACH and Berkeley sources I'd love to have!

Good Luck!

P.S. The flyer says the CD is $40. Pretty good, IMHO. Also, note that the

As a philosopher yourself, you surely have already passed your course
in literary critisism. Thus you are allowed to wield power over technology.
A shoe-salesman is never allowed to wield power over technology.
Bill Gates was a shoe-salesman. Then he attended a course in literary critisism,

 Without reading Kant, oh, and of course Wittgenstein, a dumb CS

I've seen this, or something similar, on my system.  What I did was to
rm /dev/mouse and /dev/modem, and then ln -s /dev/ttyS0 /dev/mouse and
ln -s /dev/ttyS1 /dev/modem.  I haven't looked into why this worked, but
it did.  For now, that's sufficient.  You might try something similar,
with appropriate ttyS numbers, on your system.

Quite the opposite; the unmount forces the buffer to be flushed so that no
blocks remain cached. Otherwise your subsequent read will pull these bits
out of the buffer cache, thus skewing the results. 

The fsync just forces your file to be written out, but the data may remain in
the cache.

You can get 1 MB/s, just run iozone on two or three disks concurrently
and add the results.

This, and the fact that the CPU has less work to do for the same amount
of I/O, is the advantage of SCSI (besides being able to connect more and
different devices, of course, and that SCSI disks are capable of remapping
bad blocks, which is a Good Thing), not raw speed to a single disk.

Fsync writes back the buffers, does not free them. Depending on how
large the file is and what is the retention policy of the cache (FIFO,
LRU, random) this means that perhaps the subsequent read will not be
entirely from disk.

Unfortunately it is rare (I know of none) to find a Unix FS that allows
advising for expected access patterns, even if it would most probably
give *huge* performance benefits, and would be rather easy to make the
stdio library to use it transparently and effectively for 90% of the
programs.

Yes, and it is a very grave problem. Complication, especially in system
level code, engenders two problems: it makes things harder to
write/understand/maintain, and it generates complicated performance
models that are tricky to tune. The UFS embodies a number of clever
ideas that supposedly improve performance, but their value is very
dubious, and it's in any case hard to gauge their effectiveness (not
large). FS designs based on simpler strategies reportedly get much
better average performance.

Kim> Surely there are room for improvement in the BSD UFS (as used in
Kim> 386BSD/NetBSD/FreeBSD), such as the clustering changes Larry McVoy
Kim> made at Sun,

I had once a nice discussion with Mc Voy about those. Perhaps I was
being a bit too subtle, but I think he never got the gist of my
argument, that he had conclusively proven that the central feature of
the FFS, large blocks and fragments thereof, is pointless (besides
having non trivial costs). He actually kept harking the merits of larger
block sizes, which fact made me really wonder...

Kim> or the LFS work done by Margot Selzer.

Hasn't this idea been incorporated into the version of the UFS that is
being sold for SVR4 by some company?

Because it keeps things in synch a lot, at some price in efficiency,
depending on version. For example under some UFS versions
copying/loading fs subtree is rather painful as it does every single
inode update synchronously. Living a bit more dangerously seems a better
idea, and logging an even better one, as fsck'ing a couple or more of
1GB disks can take a bit of time...

BTW I think there are plenty of opportunities for Msc level projects on
improving the Linux filesystems, which would look good and also be
useful to a lot of people... Some of these could be extended into PhD
level projects.

Hi Linuxies,

I can't wait to run Linux and XWindow..
Can anyone tell me if my system is fit for it?

I have a 486DX2/50 VLB/EISA/ISA with
- Diamond Viper VLB video card (never seen a Weitek 9000 driver
anywhere)
- Conner CP30540 SCSI2 HDD
- DTC31/3292 EISA SCSI2/FastSCSI2/SCSI controller
- 20 meg memory
- ZyXEL U-1496E 16.8k modem / V32bis / V42bis / 14.4k fax / voice-mail
- SoundBlaster Pro 8 bit sound card
- Z-Nix three buttons and MicroSoft compatible mouse
- HP LaserJet IIIP with PS Level2

Thanks.

Yes, it gives you a relative measure, but perhaps it is not of disk
performance.

Actually one would want to have an idea of how good each of these
components is *in isolation*;

1)      the generic SCSI code

2)      the HA specific SCSI code

3)      the disk SCSI code

4)      the filesystem code

5)      the cache handling code.

Also, it is rather useful to observe not only how long (elapsed) the
operations take, but also the system CPU time taken.

My *impression* is that the SCSI drivers are rather OK (e.g. by
comparison with SVR4, which has some hideously inefficient drivers), in
that they have relatively little delay and consume relatively little
CPU, and that the biggest problems are, in order of decreasing
importance:

a)      the filesystems don't do read/write clustering.

b)      advising for expected access patterns should be
        possible/automatic.

c)      the cache code should be eliminated (mmap'ing everywhere).

d)      the allocation clustering algorithm could be improved.

Point c) is being done by Linus Torvalds; but it can have a severely
negative performance impact, as Sun discovered a couple years ago,
unless it is done after b).

Doign a) and d) would not be too difficult, and would eliminate the need
for blocks and fragments (a poor idea anyhow).
