You are right, the makefiles in the examples are a mess. This is because
I did not bother to rewrite them completely, but instead hacked them until
they worked on my machine. Those makefiles are pretty specific for suns
version of make/cc. Why they didn't use Imakefiles in UIT is beyond me
(sigh).

There also happens to be a support issue involved.

In my early days with Esix, it was 99.9% stock AT&T/USL s5r3.2. The main
change of 3.2 over earlier Sys5 releases was the inclusion of
Microsoft-licensed code to run x.out binaries and other code that gave
AT&T Unix a high degree of SCO compatibility.

SCO WordPerfect ran out of the box on Esix, with the exception of a
glitch in how it dealt with the console.

Calls to WordPerfect were useless. They'd ask me what release of SCO I
was running the package under, I'd say Esix, and they'd hang up after
verbaly shrugging their shoulders. This from a tech support department
I've otherwise considered fair and competent. I can't blame WordPefect,
they didn't know what an Esix was at the time. At one point I lied and
said I was using AT&T Unix (once they supported *that*, and that worked,
because there was an *extremely* high degree of commonality between Esix
and AT&T 3.2. I figured out a workaround to the console problem, but
would not have been able to without that lie.

It is *not* enough to say, or even to be able to generally prove, that
system X runs binaries made for system Y. For a self-suppporting system,
perhaps, but many end-users like to know that their application vendors
will stand behind what they've sold. It's all too easy for someone in a
commercial tech support role to use your esoteric-but-compatible OS as
an excuse to write off your bug report.

Maybe the time will come when software vendors will explicitly report
Linux as being supported by its generic Intel binary. Just as Esix
eventually gained support as a product in its own right, so may Linux.

But make no mistake, being able to run the binary, on its own, is *not*
enough if it's not supported by the developer.

I believe Linux has a far, far greater potential as a workstation OS
rather than that of a server.

Why not use lilo?  In actuallity, it doesn't really boot from the second
disk, but you can boot a partition on the second disk if lilo is installed
on the first.  I have my second HD totally dedicated to linux, and lilo
installed in the MBR of the first.

Definitely!  My linux drive is 120M, and I still feel cramped with
only about 5M free.  It would be a shame to give 210MB all to DOS
while starving linux (unless you don't want to run X, etc...)


Email me if you need help setting up lilo to do what you want, and
I will mail you my config file (we have same setup).

He may.  I was under the same impression.  I think what he meant by
emulation was that a 32 bit takes more instructions under DOS
since you only have access to 16 bit registers.  Linux should be
much faster at 32bit arithmetic because it gets to use nifty 32 bit
registers.  In the tests that I did with BC vs gcc, this did turn out
to be the case.

    Or, if you want to boot as fast as booting off the hard drive, write
lilo to the floppy instead, after editing /etc/lilo/config to point at
the second hard drive.

    40 meg won't give you more than a bare bones linux system though. I
had gcc, news and mail on 64meg, and I had to expire on 1 day, and had 5

Date: Mon, 16 Aug 1993 08:31:53 GMT

Hello,
I'm in need of the sync-specifications for an ATI-Graphics Ultra used in
XFree-1.3.
Although I got one of the ATI-reference manuals and calculated the syncs, the
only effort was a very instable screen.

I am looking for the setting for the 1024x768/72Hz mode.

The Clock was 75.00MHz
and the settings I calculated were
 Clocks 75
 "1024x768"  75   1024 1048 1192 1296    768 771 777 806

From the ATI-manuel, I got the following values I used to calculate to above
numbers.
Resolution 1024x768 Pixel. Clock 75.MHz. Vert-Frequency: 71.8Hz.
Horizontal Values:
Active Time: 128 Chars
Front-Porch: 3 Chars
Back-Porch: 13 Chars
Active Time: 18 Chars

Vertical Values:
Active Time: 768 Lines
Front-Porch: 3 Lines
Back-Porch: 29
Active Time: 6 Lines

Thanks for helping me,
Ove.

The 8237a DMA controller in the PC's (or their clones in more modern PC's)
do have a Demand Transfer mode in which the bus is hold and DMA transfer
cycles are executed as long as the requesting controller asserts the DMA
Request. You could call this "burst" mode DMA.

>        (hence CPU can't do anything).

The CPU can continue operating if it stays off the bus (e.g. executing from
processor cache memory) and isn't hindered by the DMA (e.g. bus snooping to
keep cache coherency might stop the CPU from executing from the cache).

When using 8 bits wide DMA in Single Transfer mode, each DMA transfer
takes about 3 ms. 64 KB then takes 192 ms, which certainly is longer
than the refresh period, although most DRAMs will operate with refresh
periods of 192 ms (though not guaranteed!).

When using Demand Transfer mode and 16 bits wide DMA, transfer speed
maxes out at some 5 MB/s, so 64 KB would take some 13 ms. This is still
longer than the refresh period (4 or 8 ms, I believe).

I actually don't know what the point is of having the refresh period
be shorter than the time to transfer 64 KB?

Hi,

Emacs 19.18 is (see README) still a beta release. In src/{m,s} a linux config

works (at least for me ...) without _any_ Problems.  

BTW (this needs ca. 23-25 mb diskspace, i used gcc-2.4.5 and libs4.4

i)   configure for i386-linux. In the Top Makefile change -g to -O (or more ?)
     remove -lipc (0.99.10 and latter) 
ii)  xmakefile: link temacs with -s and remove -lipc if your kernel is
     a more recent one (0.99.10 or higher) 
iii) src/sysdep.c: add #include <unistd.h>

I discovered the same thing about parser.l/parser.c a couple of weeks aga.   So I
took the xboard source to a SPARCstation2 with SunOS4.1.1 and tried to "make" it.
Instead of flex it used lex.   The resulting parser.c module compiled with no 
problems using SunOS cc, however the second module, xboard.c I think it was, would not
compile.   On my Linux machine (SLS 1.02) I had the same problem as you mentioned
but xboard.c compiled fine.   So I took the lex output from the SUN machine (parser.c)
to my home system.    I ran make and got a lot of warning messages but it made OK.
It runs with no problems under Xview/openwin :-)

If you don't have access to a SPARC machine with SunOS let me know (pfrancis@world.std.com)
and I will send you the lex version of parser.c.

Actually there is a cheap way to get files from a Novell server,
you can use the free FTPD.NLM. You can get it from nic.funet.fi,
it is in /pub/msdos/networks/novell as ftpd18.zip.
