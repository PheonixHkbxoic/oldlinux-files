If I'm in error somewhere, feel free to correct me. I only installed linux
myself last weekend.

My first question is, is /dev/hda2 really an MSDOS partition? you can check
with "fdisk /dev/hda", then type a "p" to print the partition table. 

Next, did you "mkdir msdos" from the root directory? The mount point must
exist before mounting.

fsck only works for linux/Minix filesystems. e2fsck is for linux extended
filesystems, I'm not sure about xiafs. There is no fsck for msdos filesystems
that I know of. (Norton Disk Doctor sort of qualifies, but that doesn't run
under linux :) )

Sorry! I forgot to do this. The magazine is called "Processor", it's
published out of New Jersey, and they have an 800 number subsscription
line which I'm sure you can find by calling 800 directory assistance
(800) 555-1212.
The subscription, by the way, was free when I asked for it (and they
still send it every week, and that's how I found the cheap Adaptec
1540B).
I have no relationship woith Processor other than as a satisfied
reader/subscriber.

 Herp,
 I hope you appreciate that the sentence about "wielding power over techno-
logy" was taken from the BSD fortunes database. This database was quite
possibly compiled by a technocrat with a good sense of humor.
 
 And oh, pardon me, but Kant and Wittgenstein and Karnap and Hegel 
are old shoes now -- you has to have to read
 Derrida, Lacan, and Camille Paglia, inter alias, to be qualified to
become a Linux system administrator.

More on tainted money and drug sniffing dogs....




From the American Bar Association Journal August 1993.

[I should really get permission to copy this because these
people know how to sue! :-) but, hey, nobody can sue me for typos so :-P!
--B]

by Mark Curriden                 
                 
                 Courts Reject Drug-Tainted Evidence

Studies find cocaine-soiled cash so prevalent that even Janet Reno had some.

  The only evidence South Florida police had against Leroy Lord was the
drug-tainted, rolled-up dollar bill they saw him drop.  But it was enough
to pursuade a jury to find him guilty of possession of cocaine.

  Police say traces of cocaine on the money proved Lord had placed the
drug on or near the bill.  But in April, The Florida Third District Court
of Appeals followed a growing trend in reversing the conviction.

  ``Cocaine in South Florida is so pervasive that microscopic traces of
the drug can be found on much of the currency circulating in the area,''
the appeals court said in Lord v. Florida, No. 91-2147.  ``The mere presence
of trace amounts of cocaine on a common object ... is insufficient to support
a felony conviction for possession of cocaine.''

  Lawyers say the Florida ruling is the latest in a series of decisions
in which judges have reversed convictions and returned seized property
because the only evidence is trace amounts of drugs.  These cases are
citing evidence that the scent of cocaine is found on most currency and
often will trigger the sensitive noses of dogs trained to detect drugs.

  A forensic chemist who is asked to testify in more than a dozen cases 
annually, Dr. James Woodford of Atlanta is convinced that cocaine 
contamination is widespread.  ``The probability that every single person
in the United States is carrying drug-tainted money is almost certain,''
[[sic - apologies for being petty but people do take showers y'know --B]]
he said.

  That kind of evidence could have serious impact on the Justice
Department's asset seizure and forfeiture pogram, which relies heavily
on drug-sniffing dogs and laboratory tests confirming traces of drugs on
cash, cars and other valuables.  In 1990, Justice seized more than $176
million in assets -- up from $17 million in 1986.

  [there is a photo here with the caption: ``Graduates of the U.S. Customs
Service Detector Dog Training Center at Front Royal, Va. (left), are 
detecting traces of cocaine on everyday items, bringing into question
their usefulness.'']

  Officials with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Justice
Department say they do not rely solely on the dogs anymore, but use them
in conjunction with other techniques. [[Yeah, like Negro detection devices
and hippy-ometers ... gah -- B]]  ``The Justice Department has been
aware of this potential problem much longer than most defense attorneys
have,'' said spokesman Dean St. Dennis.  ``That's why we use it with
other factors [such as] suspicious behavior.'' [[Suspicious behavior
meaning paying for an airline ticket in cash.  In fact, other 
suspicious behaviors given as justification by police for drug searches
have included the following: `getting off the plane first', `getting 
off the plane last', `getting off the plane in the middle', and 
`wearing a white handkerchief.' -- B]]

  Criminal defense attorneys say they have been arguing throughout the
1980's that convictions and search warrents should not be based on trace
amounts of drugs.  ``What's new is that judges are starting to believe
us and rule in our favor,'' said Atlanta criminal defense attorney Don
Samuel.

  Another Judge who ruled in for the defense, U.S. District Judge Thomas 
Wiseman of Nashville, declared on April 21 that ``the evidence of the 
narcotic trained dog's alert to [tainted] currency is of extremely
little probative weight.'' The judge ordered all charges against the
defendant dropped and $9000 taken from him in an airport search returned.
Jones v. DEA, No. 3:91-0250.  [[If this is Willie Jones's case, then
it is important to note that Mr. Jones incurred much legal expense
and financial stunting from this ordeal -- he deserves damages as 
well.  I doubt he will get them. -- B]]

  ``It cannot be doubted that contaminated currency is widespread,''
Wiseman wrote.  ``The presence of trace narcotics on currency does not
yield any relevant information whatsoever about the currency's history.''

                         STUDIES SURPRISING

  A number of studies support Wiseman's statement.  Perhaps the most
dramatic was conducted in 1985 by the Miami Herald.  The paper asked
11 prominant local citizens to supply a $20 bill for testing.  Among 
those who agreed were the Catholic archbishop; the state attorney
Janet Reno; then-first son Jeb Bush; former Miss America Kylene Barker
Brandon; and the Broward County Sherriff, Nick Navarro.

  The surprizing results: Ten of the 11 bills were tainted by signifigant
traces of cocaine.  Only Navarro's money was clean.

  ``Origionally, the drug contamination on dollar bills was limited to
Florida, but now it is everywhere,'' said Woodford.  He points to a 1989
experiment by Dr. William Hearn, a Miami toxicologist, in which he gathered
135 dollar bills from banks in 12 cities across the country.  Incredibly,
only four of the 135 bills showed no traces of cocaine.

  In 1987, a study by a DEA scientist found that one-third of all money
at the Federal Reserve Building in Chicago was tainted with cocaine.  His
report, which had remained secret until this year, said traces of cocaine
were found on the agency's high-speed sorting equipment and that the drug
probably was being transferred to the currency.

  ``We reccommend that trace analysis of currency for general enforcement
or seizure be stopped,'' the report stated.  But defense lawyers say the
reccommendation has not been followed.  [[Why does this not surprise me?
Could it be that DEA cheifs are not famous for following anyone's
recommendations?  --B]]

  ``The use of drug-sniffing dogs has actually proliferated in recent 
years,'' said Albuquerque, N.M., lawyer Nancy Hollander, president of the
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.  ``These dogs are 
everywhere.  They are at every airport, bus stop and train station.''

  Added Samuel:``No one is saying that dogs are not smelling drugs.  The
point is, their smell is too good and they're smelling drugs on everything.
If cocaine is on 70 percent of all the U.S. currency, and that is the
latest estimate, then that should be the end of drug sniffs.''

=========================================================================

OK so here's the plan, right -- get yourself some powder cocaine and
dissolve it in a small concealable squirt bottle -- Go to an airport with 
nothing but a picture I.D. and cab fare, and let the hunt begin.... People in
G.Q. business suits are 10 points.  People with golf clubs score 20.
Police officers grab you a whopping 100 points.  Oh, and -5 points
for the Hari Krishnas...... have fun, and if the P.D. catches you, we
disavow any knowlege of your mission...

The problem lies in the `XTerm*geometry:         80x25'. If you change the
geometry, you will see the size of your menu change. The problem is the scope(?)
of the resource. Sure, it sets your terminal to 80x25 lines. It also sets your
menu to 80x25 pixels and for that matter affects any other widget looking for
a geometry resource.

The answer? Xterm*vt100*geometry:       80x25

This is the voice of experience. It kept biting me and took ages to sus this one

As far as I know, the newest version of the mcd.c driver

Patch level 12 has it built in.

I have the old Mitsumi drive, but don't have it working satisfactory

HOW TO POST TO COMP.OS.LINUX.ANNOUNCE

This article gives info on how and what to post to comp.os.linux.announce.
Please read the whole thing, to avoid any confusion. :)

To submit an article to this group, please mail the article to:
        linux-announce@tc.cornell.edu

If you have questions or problems with posting to comp.os.linux.announce,
please send mail to the moderators at:
        linux-announce-request@tc.cornell.edu
Or, you may send mail to us directly. The moderators for this group are
Matt Welsh (mdw@sunsite.unc.edu) and Lars Wirzenius (wirzeniu@cc.helsinki.fi).

Whereas most versions of the C-News news software will automatically mail
postings to the moderator address, it may take some time for this address
to propagate (and there are many systems out there not supporting this
automatic mailing feature). Therefore, to ensure that your posting will get
to us, you should probably mail it to us by hand. Once we receive your article
and approve it, we will post your article.

NOTE: Your article will not show up in any newsgroups that it may be
crossposted to (e.g. other than comp.os.linux.announce) until we approve the
article. The delay should be negligible (we read email all the time), so
please don't post the same article separately to other groups. That
causes multiple copies to be sent around under most setups.

Please don't crosspost articles between comp.os.linux.announce and 
other Linux newsgroups (excepting very important announcements, namely the 
Linux FAQ, new kernel/library releases, and others which I'll crosspost at 
my discretion :) ). If enough c.o.l.a articles end up in junk on sites 
which don't carry the group, maybe they'll start to carry it.

If you don't get c.o.l.a at your site, please encourage your news admin to
create it. It's a bona fide group and we need to get wider distribution.

Remember: no announcement is too insignificant for this group. Don't be
afraid to submit something if you think it isn't important enough; that's
why we have moderators, to screen the content of the group. I plan to 
approve almost anything (announcement-wise) that's submitted.

The following guidelines should be used when submitting articles:

  - I will approve a wide range of articles for this group. The only postings
    that are discouraged are discussions and questions about Linux. 
    This group is mainly for:

    * Announcements of new software that has been ported to Linux
      (e.g. "DikuMUD v4.2 is now available on sunsite....")

    * Announcements of new versions or patchlevels of existing software,
      such as GCC, the kernel, libraries, new versions of utilities and so on.
      (e.g. "Linux v1.0 is finally available...")

    * Bug fixes and software patches (or announcements of available patches).
      If you have a fix for a known bug in any Linux software, please post
      the fix and the relevant patch (if any). If the patch is huge, instead
      post an announcement as to where it's available.
      (e.g. "Patch to fix broken 0.98.5 scsi.c....")

    * Summaries of responses for individual requests for information. If you
      requested some Linux-related information on c.o.l.h, and are posting a
      summary of that information, please submit it to c.o.l.a. 
      (e.g. "Summary: What's the best VGA card for Xfree86?")

    * Just about anything else of any importance. If you're not sure if you
      should post the article to c.o.l.a, submit it anyway. It can't hurt,
      and most of the time your article will be approved anyway.

  - When submitting articles, please include valid Newsgroups, Subject,
    Keywords, From, and Date lines in the header. These may either be in
    the mail header itself, or you may simply include the article, header
    and all, in the body of the mail message. Please don't send mail with
    only the body of the article to be posted, as this doesn't include
    the Newsgroups: line and other article-specific information.

  - When submitting articles, please use a descriptive Subject line. 
    If you crosspost the article to other groups, starting your subject with
    "ANNOUNCEMENT" helps it to stick out in those groups. If you're posting a 
    patch or summary, use "SUMMARY" or "PATCH" at the beginning of your
    subject, as "ANNOUNCEMENT" isn't quite appropriate.

  - Also, please use a Keywords line in your header, so that articles may
    be searched more easily in the archives (when we have the archives up).
    The Keywords field should contain one or more of the following:
      Type of announcement: new version, patch, urgent, summary, etc.
      Package: kernel, GCC, X, TeX, SLS, jump tables, etc.
      Type of program: A keyword or two on what your program is.
        This is especially important if the program isn't part of
        a well-known package. Ex: editor, tcpip utils, game, etc.
      Version: 0.98.5, jumptables 4.2, etc.

    For example, if you're announcing v4.2 of Shoopsort for Linux, you
    might want a subject and keywords that look like this:
      Subject: ANNOUNCEMENT: Shoopsoft v4.2 now ported to Linux
      Keywords: Shoopsort 4.2, sorting algorithm, new port

    Or, if you're announcing a summary on ethernet cards for Linux, you
    could have:
      Subject: SUMMARY: Best ethernet cards for Linux TCP/IP
      Keywords: summary, ethernet, tcpip, cards, hardware

If you have any problems or questions, please contact the moderators at
linux-announce-request@tc.cornell.edu.
