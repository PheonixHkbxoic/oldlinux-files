Ever want to do two things at once?  Ever want to get some REAL work done
while a file transfer goes on in the background?  This is the MAIN reason
why I'm running linux.  DOS/Windows is a lousy multitasking setup.  If I
try to bring up a new application while a file transfer is in progress,
the file transfer usually crashes.  Last night, I started X-Windows while
a file transfer was in progress.  The 'rx' light on the modem never even
dimmed.  Try that with DOS.

>games, Mktools, etc...).  

You don't need Borland C++ if you have GNU C++.  Besides, with linux, you
get true 32 bit integers and 32 bit flat address.  With Borland, you get
32 bit integers probably through emulation and you're stuck with
segmented 16 bit addresses and major hacks to get anything larger than
64K.

Games?  There's plenty of good games floating around the network that run
under X-Windows.

For word processing, there's TeX.  It's not WYSIWYG but it could probably
do anything Ami-Pro can do if you take the time to learn it.  On the
other hand, you can load linux *and* DOS to your hard disk and boot into
DOS/Windows if you want to use Ami-Pro.

I don't know what Mktools is so I can't comment there.

I just wanted to inform all parties here on comp.os.linux
that a company is selling Motif for Linux.

The company is called Linux Systems Labs, offers what
seems to be SLS (they don't mention SLS) for $59.95
on disks or CD ROM, and is offering Motif for $175.

The ad ran on page 98 of Unix Review Magazine.

The number was:  1-800-432-0556

I am only reporting this so folks know, since I have no

It had a "hit rate" of 100% on the three machines that I installed it on.

One a DTK motherboard, a Chips and Technologies motherboard, and a Magitronic

May be it was just a corrupted copy of the a1.3 disk?

Well, you may find it bad to have a boot disk with so many device drivers, but
the a1.3 disk is intended for EVERYONE (almost).  I find nothing wrong with
including support for a wide variety of systems.

Subject: Mitumi Driver on newer Kernel
Date: 13 Aug 1993 10:55:18 -0400

Has anyone successfully compiled the mitsumi driver on a new
kernel?

I am trying to get it working with a 0.99 pl11 kernel.  I added the
patches by hand because some of the kernel files had changed since
the mcd driver was released (0.3 release of mcd).  That all seemed to
go fine, but when it tried to compile mcd.c, I get a lot of errors:

mcd.c: In function `int  mcd_ioctl (struct msdos_inode_info::inode*, struct file*, unsigned int, long unsigned int)':
mcd.c:337: warning: passing unsigned pointer to signed pointer argument 1 of `void  bin2bcd (char *)'

I get a bunch of these warnings for different lines,  but they're only warnings.
But, the one it fails on is this:

mcd.c: In function `void  mcd_data ()':
mcd.c:728: parse error before `::'

which is:
        READ_DATA(MCDPORT(0), &mcd_buf[0], 2048);
Read_data is defined as:

#define READ_DATA(port, buf, nr) \
__asm__("cld;rep;insb"::"d" (port),"D" (buf),"c" (nr):"cx","di")

and I get a bunch of warnings similar to the one above,  but the is the
only real error. 

Thanks,

   Can anybody explain why clock now emits the correct day of the week?

The h/w clock stores and updates the day of week as a separate fact
from the time of day and the date rather than deviving all of these
from the time in seconds as Unix does. DOS does not use or set the h/w
clock day of week but derives it from the BIOS date so unless you've
ever set the day of week through Linux or the BIOS setup screen it
will be random.

Well, well, perhaps a way to make *both* happy exists: the Interviews
editor is a full WYSISWYG word processor, *and* is is object oriented
(it is entirely written as a set of C++ classes, and text/graphics is
represented as a graph of objects).

The interviews doc and draw tools are here now, they work rather well,
and an interviews binary is available for Linux already...

That's not the problem.  If it were, the solution would be trivial:  poll all
the devices using the IRQ and service the ones that respond "yes, I did it".
Certainly 8250-compatible serial ports support this.

The problem is the braindamaged ISA bus.  While one card is pulling the
interrupt line down to signal an interrupt, any other cards on the same IRQ
are pulling it *up*... resulting in a current loop between the interrupting
card and the others and generally not producing enough of a voltage drop on
the bus for the interrupt to be seen by the 8259.
