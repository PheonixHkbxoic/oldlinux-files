Here's a summary of the solutions to my various problems; hopefully, they
will be of use to others.

I wrote:

===============

= 2) xdm doesn't run the setup, startup, or reset scripts.  I've disabled
= server grabbing and that didn't help.  I grabbed the xdm sources, rebuilt
= it, and that seems to work.  Something must be weird in that particular
= build.

Also, the xdm that comes with the latest SLS doesn't appear to use shadow
passwords, as does the /etc/login...

= 3) Ctrl-Alt-Del doesn't appear to work for me.  It seems to be enabled in
= the kernel.

After a bit of peeking around last night, I noticed a "ctrlaltdel" string
in /etc/init.  By changing the "pf::powerfail:..." to "pf::ctrlaltdel:..."
things now work nicely (also, I prefer an /etc/reboot to an /etc/shutdown
as well).

= 4) I can't seem to shut down the system without the next boot telling me
= that the file system isn't clean.  Shouldn't reboot sync the disks and
= mark them as clean?

bsa@kf8nh.wariat.org (Brandon S. Allbery) writes:

= 5) On occasion, after mounting a DOS floppy or hard disk, attempts to 
= unmount it will report that the device is busy.  (No processes are

= I wonder if the kernel is keeping some reference to it that's screwing
= things up.)

No solutions for this one, yet...  I'll try to narrow down the situation
which causes it.

= 6) I created a 24M swap partition, and when I use swapon, it reports that
= it's using 16M of it (I have 16M RAM).  Can't the swap space be larger than
= the RAM?

= Questions: 
= 1)    Is there any way to flip in an out of the X server, to get back

=       can't seem to get back.

I didn't realize (well, I read it, but it didn't sink in) that X would
allocate the next *unused* virtual terminal, so ALT-F7 got me back in.
For some reason, I was expecting that X took over the current virtual
terminal.

=2)     I've read that the swap space is used for paging, not traditional
=       swapping.  Does this mean that only individual pages are written
=       out as required?  Am I correct in assuming that text segments 
=       aren't written out, just data (since text pages can be re-read
=       from the executable)?  (I've run many large X clients,
=       and haven't seen swap space used, even though the memory is

I've seen exactly the same thing with the Slackware release.  I go it

The a1.3 boot disk for SLS seems to work ok for me (but there is a new

Thanks for the address, I've called them (all they can tell me so far

does for several others.)

Depends on what you are doing: most operations (the ones that
are working for Alex now) are not affected.  For example,
text scrolling speed in xterm is unaffected, and very fast!
Sure, things will probably slow way down if you are loading
big .GIF files, but that is not what I have my machine for.
Text drawing, on-screen bit-blt, line drawing, and area fill
are all quite nice on these S3 86C805 cards.

        Use the numeric keyboard delete for ctrl-alt-del. Anyone know when ctrl-alt-del is scheduled to be fixed to work with either delete in the new

since it is an old feature that "broke").

        I am setting follow-ups to comp.os.linux.misc, since it is both a

Is that where it should go? (I've read not to post to multiple groups.)

Subject: ZMODEM hiccups starting at pl10
Date: Thu, 12 Aug 93 20:04:28 GMT

After installing SLS 1.02 (some time ago) and upgrading to pl10 kernel,
I noticed that zmodem transfers were generating CRC errors every 10000
bytes +/-.  This did not occur with the pl9 kernel.  Looking at the
send/receive LEDs on the modem, it appears that whenever data is coming
into the modem (for zmodem download), no acknowledgements are ever written
out.  They eventually do get written out, but only after the sender stops
sending due to lack of acknowledgments.  At this same moment the transfer
error pops up on the screen.

I am certain that in pl9, acknowledgements were sent in a timely manner
to ensure uninterrupted data flow during a download.

Has this problem been fixed in later kernel revs, or has anybody else
noticed it?

        Hmmm, seems like ip_forward has a memory leak. This helps localize 
the problem a lot! :). (Much better than going through all the TCP/IP code, 
I once tried to print all of it a while back, and saw it was going to 
print 182 pages!!! I was able to kill the job, thankfully!).

Once the memory leak is fixed, ip_forward should be functional and not hose 
anything.

P.S. It would be nice to have ip forwarding configurable, otherwise any 
Linux machine with more than one network interface is vulnerable to being 
used as a router by any net dweeb that wants to use it as one of their 
gateways. ;)

(Some Linux machines might have more than one network interface for reasons 
other than wanting to be a gateway, such as having access to multiple nets, 
reliability, etc.)

For those of us who have used Unix for a long time and are used to the
Unix way of doing things, Linux is indispensable.  As far as the DOS
based programs you mention, we have GNU c++, TeX, X-Windows, games
(usually more strategic oriented than shoot-em-up oriented--Empire vs.
Wing Commander).

And the pricing being as it is, what Linux allows me to do is try a
truly bewildering variety of tools without any major expenditures of
money.  When I used DOS at home, I simply could not afford to taste
and choose as many tools as I do now.  Within the last year I have
tried I don't know how many different tools for building windowing
applications alone (finally settled with Tcl/Tk).  On my list of tools
to try over the next few months is a Prolog based database system,
several new languages (like Sather), a couple of games that sound like
super Civilization, among others.

When I switched from DOS to Linux, I probably had more than a thousand
dollars worth of DOS tools (like compiler etc.).  I was able to
replace all of them with (what I feel) are far superior tools at a far
more reasonable price.  This is not because it's free (I work for
the largest software company in the world, and I don't think selling
software for money is a bad thing), but since they don't cost $100,
$200 a shot or more, I can afford to try many more things at home than
I could've otherwise.

Note that Linux is not APM-aware, which means that if some power-management
features kicks in (e.g., hard disk spins down due to inactivity) while you're
running Linux, your machine is toast.

Once upon a time, I had a patch for Linux which spoke just barely enough
APM to tell the machine, "Hey you, don't spin down the hard disk, no matter
what."  Not true APM, but at least it kept my laptop from locking up

Hi freaks!

The following problems have been encountered during installation
of 'Linux softland 0.99.pl8-3 04/10/93 i386':

    - on startup the system says:
        SCSI: 0 hosts
        SCSI: detected 0 scsi disks 0 tapes 0 CD-ROM drives total.
    - after login root
        'fdisk' reports "Unable to read /dev/hda"
        'fdisk /dev/sda' reports "Unable to open /dev/sda"
        'fdisk /dev/sda1' reports "Unable to open /dev/sda1"
        'fdisk /dev/sda2' reports "Unable to open /dev/sda2"
        'fdisk /dev/sda3' reports "Unable to open /dev/sda3"

Machine configuration:
    - Noname Intel 486/33, 16 MB RAM
    - 1.44 Floppy A:, 1.2 Floppy B:
    - ET4000 SVGA + Monochrome-Adaptor
    - Future Domain TMC 885 SCSI-Adaptor,
      addess range CA00:0000-CA00-1FFF,
      IRQ 11, primary address, no ST-506 controller
    - HD HITACHI DK 516-C 16, 1.3 GB
      Partition 1: 300 MB, primary DOS, boot
      Partition 2: 250 MB, extended DOS, 1 logical drive
      Partition 3: 250 MB, LINUX

COHERENT 4.0 has been installed successfully on partition 3
prior to LINUX! Under COHERENT /dev/sd03 served well.

Any help appreciated
   Wolfgang

: I belive it only marks a fs as clean if you ask it to repair it. The

: I think it is the current state of affairs.

Recently I downloaded e2fsprogs(?).  The e2fsck in this package seems to
be slighly more up to date than the one I was using from SLS 1.02.  With
this I could at least do a 

    umount /usr
    e2fsck -rv /dev/sda4
    mount -a

and it would not say the file system was dirty.  However after a
shutdown or reboot the message that my ext2 file systems are dirty still
appears when it gets to the mount -a in /etc/rc.

I've heard some things about linux, and I'm interested in more info.  I have
an IBM pc, 486/33Mhz...  I would like to see if I could set linux up on my 
machine...  Are there any FTP sites that have info/parts of the OS?  What is
involved?  I really don't know much about linux, or the UNIX world in general,
but I am quite interested in it.  Please E-Mail me for a response.  Thank you.

Sincerely,
