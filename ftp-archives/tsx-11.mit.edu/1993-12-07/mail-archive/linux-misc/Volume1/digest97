The ability of a system to run by itself does not make it an operating
system.  Using this argument, I could claim that NetWare is not an
operating system, since a Novell 3.11 server must boot DOS and then run
SERVER.EXE.  Once SERVER.EXE is loaded, it mostly takes over the system,
including control of hardware such as memory and disk.  That may not
fit a textbook definition of "operating system", but for all intents and
purposes, it is an operating system (even though it's not bootable).

Windows for DOS is not a bootable operating system.  But it does
basically take control of the computer once it is loaded (except for
the file system).  You could argue that it isn't a complete operating
system (because it relies on the DOS file system), or that it isn't
bootable.  But, from an end-user's perspective, it is an OS.  I know
people running Windows who don't even realize DOS is on their computer.

This entire argument about what is/isn't an OS is pointless.  What
really matters now is *APIs*.  Today, API support is what determines
which software works on your system.  Not which OS you're running.

SCCS is not freely available. And is inferior to RCS. Therefore you

I am always annoyed when people in my company put such heavy emphasis
on support when they buy a product. They forget that you only need
minimal support for a good product, but a lot of support for a broken
product. And in those cases that lot of support isn't even enough.
I've seen projects utterly fail because of this.

    There's a good chance the reliability and random error problems are from

*NO* co-pro, and THAT's the problem!  Somehow the kernel detect sequence

I'm looking for other users of minicom under 99.12 to compare notes. 

Recompiling the kernel solved my ALT-key problem, but I also have
the following problems that did _not_ exist under 99.04.

        1) It does not generate ^^, i.e. control-carot. I need it to
        break back to my cisco.

        2) The script processor, keyserv, does not seem to function.
        No error messages, no complaints, just nothing.

Anyone else seen, and maybe solved, these bugs?

Is it possible to create most of the Xconfig file if you have a copy of the

Unix, for the operating system.  BSDI is a good example of something which is
stable.  Linux is a good example of something which is reasonably stable (but
it depends on the version).

A good application?  How about "X-Wing"?  :-)  Seriously, though, I haven't
found much in the way of applications that I really like.  I learned early
on that I'm better off writing what I need rather than trying to buy
someone else's idea of a good application.

A "decent" OS does *not* mean a "bug-free" OS.  It means that the OS provides
a reasonably orthogonal and complete set of services that (a) allow the user
or programmer to run and/or write programs efficiently, (b) protect the
programs the user runs from the vagaries of other programs which may be
running, and (c) efficiently use the full capabilities of the hardware.

DOS is not what I consider to be a "decent" operating system (if it can even
be called that) because it fails all three of the above criteria.

It's not???  What makes Unix inappropriate for a small business?  It's just
an operating system.  For launching applications, it does a better job than
DOS because the applications can be larger, more complete, and more capable.
The networking is already there, as is NFS (and thus file sharing), as is
print spooling, as is a real filesystem (or, at least, a better filesystem
than is provided by DOS, if the 14-character filesystem is the only thing
the particular brand of Unix you're talking about provides).

No doubt this is true, but would you care to mention some of these problems?

The Apple II was also cheap enough for a small business to use.  It just
wasn't as powerful as the PC.  But lots of businesses already had quite a
bit invested in the Apple II when the PC came on the market, largely because
of Visicalc.

>Can you honestly say that you think *ANY*
>machine with the power to run NextStep in 1982 would have been affordable?

Probably not, but that's primarily because NextStep is extremely resource-
intensive, like almost anything else in use today.

But Unix was running on the PDP-11 with 64K back in *1973* and was a lot
more powerful than DOS has ever been.

I was doing more on my 7.14 MHz Amiga with 512K RAM and 2 disk drives than
I've *ever* been able to do on a 25 MHz 386 PC running DOS with 4 meg and a
hard disk.  I know this because I've owned both.

>Those were the days when you spent $900.00/MB of RAM.  Not to mention

Yup.  But it *still* doesn't justify the hardware being as badly designed
as it is, or the software being designed as badly as it is.

Technical excellence doesn't mean bug-free.  It means that maximum power is

What is it that makes you think that Unix and the common consumer are
*inherently* mutually exclusive (unless, of course, I'm reading you wrong
here)??

And just what definition of elegance are you using here?  I'll be the first
to admit that Unix isn't the most elegant thing around, but even *you* must
admit that it's a lot more elegant than DOS, and that X is a lot more
elegant than Windoze.

Elegance has nothing to do with the acceptance, or lack thereof, of Unix
by the general user community.  If only it did...

So?  Almost *any* operating system allows you to do that.  Indeed, many
definitions of "operating system" involve the things you mention.  The
question is: which OS allows you to do that with minimum hassle and minimum
limitations?  None of the Microsoft "operating system"s qualify (with the
possible exception of NT, but I have my doubts) because they have broken
APIs.  I've *never* heard any praise from people who program under DOS or
Windows for the OS they program for, particularly after they've had a
chance to program under Unix.  The reason people program for those operating
systems is that users run those operating systems, and the reason users
run those operating systems is that they have bought the marketing hype of
Microsoft.

I've done programming under DOS before, and have done some of that work
while in the Windows environment.  I was not impressed.  Even the Amiga
was easier to deal with, and *that* doesn't even have any kind of process
protection.  There are certain arbitrary limitations of DOS that prevent
you from doing even the most basic things.  For instance, you can't run a
shell that will expand wildcards, even though DOS is command-line oriented.
Why?  Because DOS has a 128 character command line limit, which means that
EVERY PROGRAM that you want to hand multiple files specified with wildcards
has to be explicitly coded to deal with it.  This problem doesn't go away
even under Windoze.  It doesn't make sense to base your entire OS around the
command line and then cripple the command line, but Microsloth did that
anyway (what a surprise).  You want to put your compilation (or *anything*)
in the background?  Tough.  You want a reasonable (i.e., non-CP/M) filename
convention?  Tough.  Can't combine the text-based tools you have because
you don't have enough disk space for the temporary file you'll need to use?
Tough.

There's more to an operating system than just being able to run programs,
and people who don't think so quickly learn otherwise.  Why else do you
think Consumer Reports rated the Mac GUI above Windoze?  Why else do you
think they even *bothered* to put multitasking (such as it is) in Windoze?
Why else do you hear *normal users* complaining about the broken filename
limitations in DOS?

As for not having to know the intricacies of a particular hardware
manufacturer, that isn't at all true of DOS.  If you want to do anything
with, e.g., the serial ports, you have to know about the hardware.  Same
with networking.  Same with graphics (particularly higher resolutions).
Same with tape devices.

Yes, there are libraries that have some of these capabilities, but the point
is that the *operating system* doesn't provide these capabilities.

DOS doesn't stand on its own merits.  It can't, because it's too crippled to
do so.  It is as popular as it is *solely* because it is the operating system
that came (and still comes) with all PCs.  But taken by itself, DOS is almost
useless in comparison with any other operating system.  It is *no more* useful
than AppleDOS was back on the Apple II.

I'll be the first to admit that Windoze+DOS is significantly better than DOS
alone, however.  Even so, you have to compare like against like, and that
combination is not as useful (in my experience) as AmigaDOS was, and is
certainly not as useful as Unix + X.

It's not free, but it's cheap *regardless* of whether or not you have a net
connection.  There are a number of Linux distributions being sold, most of
which are priced at less than $100 and many of which are priced at less than
$50.

Of course, if you happen to have the "support" of which you speak below, you
can often get it for free.

Only *one* person in your group needs to have a net connection, which means
that the price can be arbitrarily small.

So?  These same sources of support provide support for pretty much any flavor
of Unix as well, or most any operating system, or most applications that run
under those operating systems.

But the decision of whether or not to buy a Microsoft product is based in
part on the (mostly mistaken) notion that *Microsoft* will provide good
support for their products.
