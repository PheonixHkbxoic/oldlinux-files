Strange.  I have a Linux system with gcc, g++, XFree86-1.3 various extra
programs, Ghostview, and 7Mb free space on by 35Mb Linux partition on
my laptop.

Linux can be as small or as large as you wish.
[ I've actually had a working system in 3Mb using NFS to mount /usr ]

Such a comparison as this table is pretty inaccurate simple because with
Linux you can do what you want.

Thanks a lot to everybody who sent me help. I received about 20 mails about
this topic. A summary:

- do not use the Stealth 24, it is 'a little different' around its clockchip
  and not supported by XS3
- 1024x768 is the highest resolution with 1 Mb VRAM because XS3 installes a
  256kb cache in the videoram
- a recommended card is the Orchid Fahrenheit 1280
- XFree-2.0 will support the S3 and the Cirrus chipsets

I tried a noname card called W911 and it did not work, because the clockchip
is not supported by XS3. So I'll wait for XFree-2.0 and get a compatible card
when it is out.

Cheers,
Ecki

Another one that might be interesting to mention is # of filesystems
supported.  NT can do three.  I've lost count with Linux.  :-)

My understanding is that this is extremely questionable.  NT claims to
have met the basic requirements for *applying* for C2 certification. 
However, certification is supposed to take quite a while, and I believe
that a hardware+software combination must be certified, i.e. if you run
NT on your clone, there's no way that you could claim C2.

Ha!  As a long-time (though mostly former at this point) Microsoft
customer, I'd say that several months is an *extremely* generous
estimate.  This is, oc, assuming that they ever deign to acknowledge the
bug at all.  Then, there's also the issue of *cost* of bug fixes (since
they usually only come with the next release of the product, for which
you invariably have to pay upgrade charges).

>application availability    limited to DOS, Windows    DOS, Unix (almost all

Otoh, this isn't quite correct.  NT can run OS/2 1.x text-mode
applications.  Both of them.  :-)

Then, of course, there's always this feature:

chance that the product     high (they did it            almost none (source
will be dropped like a hot  before, they'll do           availability means
potato, leaving customers   it again).                   that anyone can
in the lurch, if sales                                   support the product).
don't meet expectations.

And, as far as I know, this one is still true:

Supports *incoming* telnet  no                           yes

And, of course:

development tools           no                           yes
bundled

Script language             very limited                 very powerful

Subject: A nice linux story
Date: Mon, 23 Aug 1993 11:26:14 GMT

For those of you in need of encouragement, here is a story about me, linux
and the world in general :

I started out with 0.98p4, on a 486SX/25 with 4MB of RAM and a 30MB Linux
partition. I'm now running on the following setup :-

i486 DX2/66
Local bus video
DC600 ISA Cache controller with 450MB of storage (300 for Linux)
Adaptec 1540B with 280MB SCSI II (all for Linux)
16 MB on board RAM
4 MB on the IDE disc controller
Dell Ultrascan 17FS Trinitron monitor
Colorado Tape Drive
Genoa CLGD5426 graphics card (1MB) 
Twincom 144DF modem connecting me to the outside world.
(Ether board on the way :-))
4 Serial ports (3 usable concurrently, on its 4,3,5)

(That machine kicks some serious shit, let me tell you...)

Also connected :-

The old 486 SX25 with 60 MB for linux,
a DX2/50 12MB with 120MB for linux
an old 386 DX 25 w/387 60MB for linux

And it all runs very smoothly (well, it did until pl12, but Linus will be           
helping with that little problem no doubt...)

[Smiles broadly]

Everyone at the client's office where the DX2/50 & 386 are are very impressed
with Linux and considering porting some of their high powered simulators
to it since they get twice the performance on floating point work. (The
simulations can take up to 3 days to run on a DX2/66 machine - written in
fortran, the only major porting hurdle... they don't trust language converters).

Hopefully with more occurrences like this little lot, linux should start to
get a real foothold!

Could anyone help with the following?  I recently installed
two 3Com 3c503's (EtherLink II) in my two PCs, one running 
pl 11 and the other pl 12.  "host1" is a 386 running the 
pl 12 kernel and "host2" is a 486 running the pl 11 kernel.
Both machines are using the NET-2 suite which I ftp-ed from 
tsx-11.

Here is what the network looks like:

+------------------------------------------------------+
|        T.B.C=========================C.B.T           |
|          |                             |             |
|       +-----+                       +-----+          |
|       |host1|                       |host2|          |
|       +-----+                       +-----+          |
|                                                      |
|   T: 50 ohm terminator (connected directly onto B)   |
|   B: BNC "T" connector (connected to 3c503)          |
|   C: end of cable connector (solderless variety)     |
|   =: RG-58 solid core coax cable (for thinnet)       |
+------------------------------------------------------+

Each machine exhibits different problems when booted.  My
original intention was to use the 386 (host1) for a gateway/
nameserver for the already overworked 486 (host2) machine.

When host1 boots, it detects the 3c503 card but does not 
report its IRQ.  host2 does detect the card and reports the
IRQ it is using.  The jumpers on both cards are set to the
same configuration: MEM @ dc00, I/O @ 300.  The IRQ for host2
is 9.  I suspect the IRQ for host1 is 5 but am not really all
that sure.

When running, any attempt on host2 to use eth0 (ie. ping host1) 
will result in the following message, which is continually repeated
every so often:

eth0: transmit timed out, TX status 0xe, ISR 0x0
eth0: Possible network cable problem?
eth0: Resetting the 3c503 board 0x708=0x10 0x706=0x2 0x205=0x49... done.

The "possible network cable problem" is perhaps the most alarming 
since I built the thing not really knowing what I was doing but
using "common sense" and some 2nd hand information.  

As for host1, any attempt to use network software (such as doing a
"finger @host2") will result in a message similar to this:

finger: tcp/finger: unknown service 

So I hope you can see that I can't tell whether its a hardware or
software (or both) problem.  I could provide copies of my /conf/net
files (if that would help) but their contents parallel pretty
closely the suggested entries in the NET-2.FAQ.


Thanks for reading this,

* Adjust your Flames to low, please *

First, I'm working on a Diamond.FAQ.  It will be released very
shortly, so that some of you diamond owners may be albe to get X up
and running in colour yet...

I can't refute these claims, however, I will state that it is
currently possible to get 1024x768x256 color operation out of most of
the Diamond products.  The Viper is excluded, I know is *currently*
*excluded* from this group.  It uses the P9000 chipset, and although
it's not protected by the "trade secrets" which Diaomnd Computers Inc,
holds over the Stealth, and SpeedStar, there is no support for this
product, at this time.

I'm not trying to advocate Diamond purchases. There are no OS/2
drivers, nor are there XFree86 drivers that directly support their
products.  There will probably be NT drivers, before OS/2, but who
knows (my guess).

Unfortunatly, many of use Linux users own Diamond products, and I for
one wasted a weekend, trying to get mine to work.  That's why I'm
working on the FAQ.

Okay, I'm happy... I stated my case, and my opinions...
Much of what I said is just that -- my opinion, and I reserve the
right to be dead wrong...
