Has anyone ported to stared to port the andrew toolkit? I started
yesterday before I realized just how much is involved (expecting a
normal 2 hour job. Looks more like a 2 week job. :( ).

Anyone?

True, people have got to realize that UNIX in general, Linux being no
exception, does what you tell it to.  People *should* have LOOKED to see if
there was a /dev/swap around, even if people do not know what it does (I
certainly didn't), you would think they should either ask about it, or not
touch it (seeing as it was linked to /dev/hda1).   I am using SLS from
tsx-11.mit.edu, and while I am not networking, I have found it to be much
sounder then anything I could have put together.  If people don't want to
look around the system, READ A UNIX BOOK OR TWO, and generally try and
*learn* something, then maybe they should make their own release.  Nobody
forces people to buy SLS, there are other packages, and you can always put
it together yourself.  IMO Peter has done people a *service* with SLS,
regardless of ANY short-comings.  Can 1/2 these people bitching about SLS
think they can put together something as complete?  What? No time? tough!
then you can stick with DOS, OS/2, or another Linux release, just don't
bitch about Peter's "lack of godly perfection."

The bottom line is that this country is pretty free about where you can
spend your money, and if you don't like it, don't buy it.  Saying "Oh, but I
didn't know it was not perfect!" is no excuse for whining IMHO, since if you
did not know it wasn't perfect, you must be pretty gullable. DOSs
installation fucks up sometimes, and Linux is a hell of a lot more
complicated then DOS.

Sorry if I offended anyone, but I am getting feed up with the bashs Peter is
getting. You don't like SLS?  Don't get it.  I think he deserves a hand for
what he has done.

Virtually all of the Linux programs are GNU. 

Many of the smaller programs aren't separate GNU programs, and 
are distributed as part of bigger packages - ie

shellutils
fileutils
textultils

you can grab the sources from any GNU archive - ie 
prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu

Date: 30 Aug 1993 04:14:52 GMT

I'm trying to setup a network between 2 computers using a serial cable. What
I planned on was logging in to weasel (my roommate's computer) from wombat
(my computer) using a comm program, then starting dip -i on weasel and dip -t
on mine. The logging in part works OK, dip -t works fine on my machine, but 
when I start dip -i on weasel, it says "You do not have DIP access.  Go away."

The /etc/diphosts file contains the line
brummett::localhost::SLIP,296
brummett is my login on weasel.

So... what do I have to do to get it to run?

Thanks in advance.

No one is saying that it can't support multiple *users*.  DOS can do that.
But can it support them at the same time?  Can I use something analagous
to SLIP to log in to my work machine from home, and use my programs and read
my mail and send and recieve files while an administrator checks users' 
passwords for security and another user ping's a computer at a remote site?
That is multi-user.  The multi-user that you are describing can be achieved
under DOS with a security program like ironclad.

That is what makes something functionally multi-user.  So what is NT?
multi-tasking.  No-one is arguing that.  Well, not actually.  You don't
usually want a user to be able to execute an arbitrary program.  That's a
security risk.  But I guess that that's what straight BSD is, so it's just
a technicality.

I asked the Andrew Consortium this question a few weeks ago, and got the
answer that they're currently porting it to Linux!

So we'll see it when it's done. As you say - a VERY big job...

Right now, Linux is a rapidly moving target, meaning few people are 
willing to support it.  Although in many installations, Linux has proved
more stable and given better performance than commercial systems like
SCO, there is too much broken Linux code (ie, networking) and too many
broken programs out there (ie, the gcc C++ frontend which generates
horribly incorrect code for some input on some platforms) for some one
to support the whole thing.   The wide variety of hardware that Linux
runs on also complicates things, especially with PC hardware which is 
often B.A.D (Broken As Designed, ie if everything breaks in the right
way it works).  I've personally traced a large number of bug reports 
to hardware problems with marginal hardware.

When the price is right, I support Linux for some subset of Linux
(ie, certain kernel revisions, certain device driver and hardware
combinations, certain user level programs) but at this point wouldn't 
be willing to support the whole thing for the reasons I outlined above.

One thing you need to be careful about---it's possible (probable) that
these stats include times for transferring the control files, and will
also probably include transfer of files that are really too small to be
of any value in a throughput measure.

It's better to look in your Stats file and look at incoming files that
are *AT LEAST* 200k (and if at all possible, twice that size).  Otherwise,
your measurements are, at best, uncertain.

>Have you done anything to customize your uucp configuration?  The
>best rate I've seen here so far is about 1100CPS, but on average it
>is much worse.

1100 cps for a V.32bis/V.42 connection, even with UUCP 'g', is pretty awful.
Btw, all throughput references I'm listing below are compressed news feeds,
V.32/V.42/V.42bis (even though V.42bis isn't doing much here) connections,
and I ignore any files that aren't big enough (at one point, there were a
bunch of nice huge files, around 400k each, from each site that I used for
throughput measurements).  Oh, serial port has 16550AFN, uses RTS/CTS flow
control, and is locked at 38.4 kb.  Oh yeah, one more thing....  Large
footprint USR Courier DS w/ square LEDs.

When connecting to my primary news feed and receiving news, I'm limited
to UUCP 'g' (he's currently running Waffle under dog, but that may change).
I get around 1350 cps on large files from him.

When connecting to the feed that I get col.* from (which, btw, is over a
long distance line), I'm using Taylor UUCP's 'j' protocol, and I see around
1650 cps, which is only about 74 cps below the approximate maximum for a
V.32bis/V.42 connection (assuming no improvement from V.42bis) after V.42's
async-to-sync conversion and protocol overhead are taken into account.
Considering that Zmodem (fully registered dog version) only yields around
1650 to 1700 cps, I'm not complaining too much.  :-)  I want those few extra
cps, but I'm not about to waste any time to get them!

Now, with that, I'd better get this posted before the approaching
thunderstorm (and the associated power failure for the island I live on)
arrive.....  :-)

Later,

The free software foundation has nothing against people making 
money off software.  However, the party line is that people are 
paying for support, development, and other value added services
rather than the software itself that is free.

So, someone making a few more billion off Linux in itself
wouldn't be a bad thing, and it would be a definite improvement
in quality compared to many of the current Microsoft offerings.

The part about William taking a Liking to Linux I object to is that
his lawyers would find a way to break the GPL, and his programmers would
find a way to break Linux so they could sell the next revision as a bug
fix.

>[Flames at and defense of SLS and Peter deleted for brevity]

Some people find SLS useful, others find it harmful. Welcome to the net. As
has been suggested (at length) by others, those who don't like it have
other options. For those of us who think that SLS, with all its attendant
warts, is of value, how about trying to do something productive about the
problems?

I suggest creating a list of problems with the current SLS, along with
proposed fixes. (I also suggest deliberately leaving out of such a list
things which amount to matters of personal taste. Thus "/dev/swap is a link
pointing to something which is probably not swap" would be included, while
"links should never go in /dev" would not.) This would not be the Linux
FAQ; it would be only for those problems specifically relating to SLS.

The point of the whole thing would be twofold: to help SLS fix the problems
in later releases, and to help users fix problems while they are waiting
for the next release.

Yeah, I guess this means I am volunteering to maintain the sucker. Anybody
interested? Send me mail with your comments or with problems you've found.
(I already know about /dev/swap, the missing /var/log, the kernel patch to
compile without quotas, and the missing /usr/spool/lpd. I'll write up some
detailed fixes for these, but if you have insights or that's-not-a-bug,
that's-a-feature arguments, I'd be happy to see 'em.)

If anybody seems to care, and even if they don't, I'll post later about how
to get copies of the most current list and where to send submissions. For
now, just mail to henke@scaly.ssc.gov.

Of course it wouldn't be wise to trust important files to it until

No, and it won't be supported until DTC changes their corporate policy

I got mail from a user interested in doing a DTC 3270 driver, and 
responded with pointers to the Linux SCSI driver manual and a suggestion
that Eric Youngdale and I were usually willing to answer technical 
questions concerning the Linux SCSI drivers.

A few days later, I got another mail from the user stating that 
he couldn't do the driver, because when he contacted DTC for hardware
documentation he was told

"We don't give out that type of information to the general public"

I've crossposted my reply to comp.periphs.scsi and comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,
in the hopes that someone in one of those groups has had a more positive 
experience dealing with DTC.

If this is the real corporate policy, and not what a frontline support 
person stated because he didn't know the real answer, users should 
consider buying their hardware from other companies that aren't outright 
hostile towards developers.
