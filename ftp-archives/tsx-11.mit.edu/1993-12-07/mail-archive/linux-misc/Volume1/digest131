Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

Well, I'm not sure you're talking about me, but two points: I was running
an ALPHA kernel, and (much more importantly), my hard drive
periodically produces block errors.  Over the life of a filesystem,
I will find 20 or 30.  Without a RAID disk array, there's no
way around a problem like this.

I don't know whose comments you're referring to; I've only said that
all the ext2fs problems I've had were my own fault (not e2fscking
after a crash).  Now that I do religiously e2fsck, I'm hit with
the most devastating error.  C'est la vie.

It isn't kind to laugh at someone's adversity.  I wish you interesting
times with NT and its glorious FS.

Can it be that the notebook has some sort of powershutdown on the floppydrive,
or that the floppy drive ccyles some hardware signal indicating a floppy is
still present in the drive ?

Does it happen both with and without a floppy in the drive ?

All Linux binaries run on all Linux machines. The base format for a Linux
binary is a.out. ELF binaries are used by SVR4 and COFF by SVR3. There are
projects under way to make Linux understand both formats. Linux binaries
from different distributions ARE compatible. Soon binary formats from
other 386 unix's will be compatible too.

        No.  In general newer linux kernels will continue to run old binaries
without much trouble.  There has not been a binary-breaking change in the
kernel for almost a year, I think (and even then it did not break that many
binaries).

        The only time a problem might come up if someone wanted to run newer
binaries with an older kernel.  In this case the user would need a kernel
upgrade and perhaps a libc upgrade, but that is about it.  Older binaries will
nearly always continue to run on a newer kernel, unless it is directly related
to a feature under development (i.e. networking daemons).

        The ELF and COFF stuff only affect users who want to use these
features.  Everyone else will not notice a difference.

I have come to the conclusion that MS Windows is a very modern Operating
System, making use of a microkernel and file system server
named MSDOS.

Or was it a micro-kernel and windowing package getting used by a file
system server named MSDOS.

Or was it something different yet?

Boy, *this* is definitely sophisticated! Small wonder Microsoft Windows
does not do many impressive things apart from running at all
under the absurd load of different compatibilities to archaic
systems it has to provide!

has anyone got calc-2.02 to work under emacs v19.19-A?  I am having
all sorts of problems with Info files and calc.  I tried compiling the
calc.el files after I had installed emacs19-19, and while it compiled
and added the proper list of key-strokes to my .emacs file, if gave me
all sorts of errors (which i cannot remember at the time). Calc worked
fine for me under emacs 18.59. :-(

Elifino.  The notebook does have all kinds of power management stuff, so
it may be the problem.

Indeed there is: -Wstrict-prototypes.
Other useful options are -Wall (_very_ useful!), and -ansi -pedantic.

P.S. This should all really be in gnu.gcc.help.

Not if full COFF and ELF were available under Linux!!  (Broken record
time again).  Then SCO & 5.4.X software would run without much modification
and more time can be spent on support rather than cross-development.

Considering the old binaries using libc2.2 that don't work on the current
kernel are the ones from the great stat() change (circa 0.98) and these work
on small filesystems (<64Mb) I don't think claims of incompatiblity are
that justified.
Best to provide either a dynamically linked binary or a pre-resolved
object module to just run the linker at.

I just asked about this on gnu.emacs.help -- Calc broke for emacs 19.
However, I was told of 'calc-2.02a' which Archie found for me.  There
is also a 'calc-2.02b' which appears to be another small fix.  Get one
of these instead.

(Apparently calc-3.0 will really support Emacs 19+, while 2.02[ab] is
just a bit of a kludge.)

No, SLS's tex doesn't have it's own numbering for TeX; it's just the
most current source (that's my intention, anyway)
yes, the sources for tex3.1415 are on the net. to install on your sun:

1) ftp to ftp.cs.umb.edu, cd pub/tex and get
   web2c-5.851d.tar.z and web-5.851d.tar.z this is Berry's web to C
   package and the related Web source. NOTE: the tex.web here is 
   for version 3.141
2) ftp to labrea.stanford.edu, cd to pub/tex and in subdirs thereof
   get:
     tex.web
     tangle.web
     plain.tex
     plain.mf
   read recent comp.text.tex for info on this update.
3) unpack files gotten in 1),
   replace older versions with the files gotten in step 2),
   in the web2c-5.851d dir, edit tex/tex.ch and web/tangle.ch to
   change the tex version to 3.1415 and the tangle version to 
   4.4 (as i recall).
4) in the web2c-5.851d dir, edit Makefile.in to taste (and see note
    below)
5) in the web2c-5.851d dir, run ./configure and then make
   see the README and INSTALL for more info.

===========
NOTE: the diffs that i apply to the std dist. are at tsx-11.mit.edu
/pub/linux/packages/TeX/Milieu/texsrc.diffs (name may vary). other
than the update to tex.web,tangle.web,plain.{mf|tex}, my changes
consist of:
 1) different default directories
 2) patch to mf.ch to make METAFONT more usable interactively
 3) a bug fix to lib/openinout.c so that if Tex can't find a 
    tfm file, MakeTeXTFM is in fact called (which calls mf to make
    the tfm) to make the font metric (a 300dpi font also gets made
    in the MakeTeXTFM script that i include in the SLS t3/texbin.tgz

ls -lt /usr/bin |tail 
shows that the oldest binaries that I have is from October, November and December
*1991* (that's right. 91).  They all work as they should.  One of them is a version 
of micro-emacs.

I have a similar setup.  I have one 340M and one 210M HDs with 340M one 
being master.  The partitions are (on top of my head):

hda1    210M    FAT DOS/WIN (bootable)
hda2    29M     FAT DOS/WIN
hda3    1M      OS/2 boot manager (bootable)
hda4    90M     extended
 hda5   80M     OS/2 HPFS
 hda6   10M     OS/2 HPFS swap

hdb1    120M    Linux /usr
hdb2    80M     Linux / (bootable? I think)
hdb3    10M     Linux swap

Okay, there are three entries in Lilo: linux, dos, and os2.  Choosing linux
boots /dev/hdb2, dos boots /dev/hda1, and os2 boots /dev/hda3.
There is one entry in OS/2 boot manager: OS/2.  I set the timeout value
of boot manager to be 0, so booting OS/2 from Lilo is instantaneous.

I'd recommend you to use linux fdisk to partition OS/2.  It's a lot more
flexible and smarter than OS/2's fdisk.

Hope this helps.
