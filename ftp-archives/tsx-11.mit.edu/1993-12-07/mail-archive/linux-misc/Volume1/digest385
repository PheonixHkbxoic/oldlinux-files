Here is my .02 on the Linux Consortium.  

In the real world, people read magazines and journals which
reviews, tests, and evaluates products. 
Why should Linux be any different?

The best thing to do is put pressure on computer magazines
to generate these reviews. Of course, they will only do it
if their readership gives a damn.  So send those cards and letters 
and let them know you care, and want to see a review of Linux
distributions.  The mags will respond if they get lots of mail.

I'm sure the Linux Journal will do these reviews.
I would argue their reviews will completely overshadow the
official blessing if LJ fulfills its promise.
(I would also think they can't depend on the Consortium to do the reviews
if they want to establish their own credibility)

Anyone can do their own review, and publish it on a FTP site.
You don't need to form an official organization do have testing
and reviews of Linux packages.  

The LC just isn't needed.  At best, it will produce some testing and reviews
of Linux packages.  At worst, it will further diminish the "commercial"
nature of Linux by confusing people who might think Linux is controlled by
a group of bureaucrats.

Great! I have always used SLS ever since I installed Linux a year a ago, 
starting with SLS 1.01. Yes SLS has its pitfalls and caveats, but hey, 
I have always been able to correct those either by myself, or with help
from the net. Don't get me wrong I am sure that Slackware is also a 
fine distribution too.

Just that I am looking forward to the SLS 1.05 distribution. Keep up the
very good work Pete.

about writing articles for LJ I have seen an amazing number of

how many of "us" are hams.

If you are a ham, let me know and maybe include a short blurb

Linux tries to allocate as much memory as possible for file buffers.
Linux automatically reduces the number of file buffers, when the number
of memory is used for other things, say, processes.

However, for "pure" pages (these are only read-only and cannot be
modified thus), the file buffers and the process memory may be the
same!

In other words: don't try to calculate the amount of memory used for
processes by subtracting the buffer pages from the total used pages.

Just wanted to say, LINUX RULES!  I'm been using it since 0.11, and all I
can say is that it is the best development platform I've ever used on my PC.
It is orders of magnitude more stable than OS/2, in fact I have not crashed 
it _once_ on my system.  I know that's probably not saying much, but
suffice to say that putting OS/2 through the same workload crashed it so many
times I had to abandon it :)

Just basically wanted to give kudos to everyone who's developed Linux,
especially to Linus of course!  You guys are doing an amazing job!!!

No, but you have access to FTP sites that do have those files. The
Linux documentation effort has ALWAYS concentrated on Linux-SPECIFIC
documentation. (This includes the man pages!) None of the things that
you mentioned above are Linux-specific.

In addition, in general documentation for various applications and
software packages should be included WITH THE SOFTWARE PACKAGE ITSELF.
This means that bison/flex/awk/groff/X11/elvis should provide their
documentation with the package. For the same reason that it makes no
sense to archive section 1 man pages, it makes no sense to archive
documentation for individual software packages in this way. What if
you have an older or newer version of groff than the docs provided on
sunsite? You're stuck. 

The main point here is that it has always been up to the applications
developer and distributor to take care of documentation for that
software package. In this way, when you install a software package,
you should install the docs for that package at the same time.
Granted, most Linux distributions don't include all of these docs, but
that is still no reason to separate the docs from the software
packages in an individual archive of some kind. 

>All these documentation is available.  But often, you have to get the
>source code of these, to get the documentation, people make binary
>distributions (thats fine) but cut off the docs (thats bad).

Well, the answer is obviously to include documentation with the binary
distributions. I suggest that /usr/doc be used for this kind of
"miscellaneous" documentation, much in the same way that /usr/src is
used for source code. I don't think that attempting to run down every
version of each of these random documentation sets and trying to
maintain them as a separate entity is a good idea. 

Another alternative is to provide the docs (+ man pages) as a third
type of distribution, apart from source and binary. Hence for the
software package "shoopware", you might have "shoopware-src.tar.gz",
"shoopware-bin.tar.gz", and "shoopware-doc.tar.gz".

Just about everything that you mentioned in this posting has been
covered (or is being covered) by the Linux Doc Project manuals, on
sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/docs/LDP. For example, information on
how to get and install Linux, including a new-user's UNIX and system
admin tutorial is covered in the book ``Linux Installation and Getting
Started''. In addition, there is a Network Administration Guide,
Kernel Hacker's Guide, and System Administrator's Guide. A Linux
User's Guide is in the works.

About all we DON'T have right now is an extensive command reference,
but the User's Guide should provide that once it is available.

Please mail me if you're interested in helping the LDP write these
manuals. I'm frankly surprised that you haven't seen them.

Subject: [Announce] Callback for Linux
Date: Mon, 6 Dec 1993 15:53:31 GMT

Heia:

This message is crossposted to c.o.l.misc and c.o.l.development, to reach a 
wide audience..

I recently uploaded my callback program to tsx-11.mit.edu. Basically, this 
program allows you to accept an incoming call on a Linux box with a modem. 
Instead of a login procedure, the `bogus login' asks you for a name and 
phone number to call back. The Linux box then dials that number, tries to 
establish a connection, and if that succeeds, starts a login shell. Great to 
cut your phone cost, if you have a modem at home and a Linux box at the 
office :)

The prerequisites for callback are:

(a) You must have a modem. Ha ha.. no, seriously.. you must have a PROPERLY 
INSTALLED modem.  That in turn means that you'll need the program setserial 
(2.0.2) and the program getty_ps (2.0.7b).  The modem must accept dial-in 
and dial-out calls.  

(b) You need the program callback. I don't know when it will be moved to an 
appropriate directory on tsx, but if you don't want to wait that long, get 
the following two files from beatrix.icce.rug.nl, directory pub/unix:

        callback-1.00.tar.gz    -   the archive with sources, docs etc.
        callback.doc            -   also in the archive: installation etc.

Hope you'll like callback. If so, drop me a note :) I am not posting 
callback.doc in this message; it's about 32K. Get it if you're interested.

Cheers,
Karel.

Are you sure you have a correct understanding of what an X "server" and

If so, do you still want to start the X "server" on your Linux system for

Actually, that CD included some stuff that was *less than a week old* at
the time it was offered.  At the time you could buy the CD, it included
*the most recent* ALPHA-pl13 kernel available.
(but of course everyone who bought it has heard the story behind it, and

Or simply put a "vga=xxxx" line in your LILO configuration file.

Hello networld!

My Conner 3544 harddisk (500 MB) is getting more bad sectors every day
so I think, I have to purchase a new disk in the near future. 
I'm planning to change to SCSI-(2?) but don't want to change my mother-
board to PCI at this time (maybe in 1-2 years...). So I have to stay 
with ISA and the controller shouldn't be too expensive.

Are there recommondations for an SCSI-Controller that:
 - supports disks > 1 GB and > 1024 tracks?
 - supports DOS, OS/2 and Linux?
 - can coexist with a PAS-16 card in the same system?
   (I read somewhere that Adaptec 154x-controllers can not)
 - can be used parallel to IDE-disks 
 - has good throughput, not too expensive ....

I have no idea about the reason for the problems with the PAS-16/adaptec.
Can someone enlighten me?
Is there a problem with other busmaster-cards too in this configuration?

Thanks for your help!
Wolfgang

I have two linux boxes, one of them use a 3Com Etherlink II, the other
one a Ne2000 clone: No problem.

"Novell Netware" ? What's that ?

Subject: Yet another benchmark results..
Date: Tue, 7 Dec 1993 03:16:14 GMT

Seeing so many benchmark tests contradicting one another
gotta be confusing for insightful observer. For me perpetrating
mostly scientific calculations they do not offer much to
swallow to say nothing about digesting..
So in deep despair have I decided to run the following
short and, I hope, comprehensive code on various boxes widely
spread in academic community.

- - - - - - - - Cut here - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <time.h>
main()
{
double  x,y[1000000];
int     i;
time_t  t;

time(&t);
for (i=0;i<1000000;i++)
        {
        x=11.0+(33.5*i)*(33.5*i);
        y[i]=(sin(3.1*i)+cos(5.1*i))*sqrt(x+exp(3.14*log(x+i)));
        }
printf("time=%d\n",time(0)-t);
}
- - - - - - - - - - - - Cut here - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

As everybody with eyes can see, the program calculates some stuff
in a loop storing it in memory (gotta be ~ 8Mb of RAM taken)
and gives on output the number of seconds spent. And here are the
results of calculation:

     Computer                             Time spent

486DX2-66 EISA/VL 16Mb RAM
running Linux (Slackware 1.1.0).
gcc compiler.
Single user                               27 sec.

SUN Sparc-2 with >= 16 Mb RAM
running SunOS
Single user                               69 sec.

DEC VAX with ALPHA chip
running VMS
With quite a few users on                 69 sec.

SUN-4
running SunOS
Single user                               73 sec.

DEC VAXstation 3100
running VMS
Single user                               405 sec.



So comments are welcome.

Cordially,
Serge
