I have no trouble debugging my FORTRAN code on my Linux machine; just fire
up gdb, and set a breakpoint at __MAIN.

F2c is fairly rigorously tested, by what I hear; the only two problem I've
ever heard about (on comp.lang.fortran, a couple of months ago) have
been fixed in the meantime.

Also, with f2c, you can also look at the intermediate C code and see
what f2c has actually been doing.  I/O calls look pretty ugly, but the
code is readable apart from that.  You can always check it, if you
suspect a flaw in the FORTRAN compilation.  Actually, this is something
that native f77 compilers don't allow you ;-)

>Who knows how f2c/gcc behaves unter MS-DOS??

Badly; there is a gcc port to MS-DOS, but using DOS extenders is always
a pain, and gcc depends on being able to allocate large chunks of
memory.

F2c is available for MS-DOS, so you probably can run its output
through one of the C versions for MS-DOS.

>Who knows how often f2c "fails"?

How often does your native compiler fail?

Fair enough.  Glad someone finally decided to give some idea of what's
wrong with it :-)

Many of these things I've not had to worry about.  This system does no
networking (beyond UUCP) so that's not an issue.

(yet :-))

Anyway, thanks for taking the time to point out some actual errors.  Nice
to see that there really *are* problems with it, rather than just it being
badmouthed because of something it's keeper did...  :-)

So I haven't gotten down to bizzare stuff yet - I've been too busy
learning the basics.

Since I'll be doing a re-install in a few weeks anyway, if I can get ahold
of slackware I'll give it a go (note I've not got ftp access, so it's not
quite that simple...)

I guess I somehow missed the issue about the "Byte ads", but my problem  
with SLS today is that it is not updated as frequently as Slackware (and  
maybe LGX - no experience there), and requires a lot of tweaking to bring  
it up to the level of an "off the shelf" Slackware install, for instance. 

This doesn't make SLS a total piece of shit, or does it make Peter a bad  
guy, it just means that I (and others) will recommend what we feel is a  
better package. I agree SLS was instrumental in giving people an all in  
one package for Linux back when there wasn't an alternative, and may have  
been the inspiration for things like Slackware, LGX, etc. But efforts  
should get judged on their quality today, not a year ago. Fact is SLS is  
getting a little rough around the edges compared to the others.

The Ctrl-Shift stuff is not real vi, since they are not normal Unix
keying. To switch between multiple files you have:

        :n[ext] [files]         next file in [new] argument list
        :N[ext]                 previous file in argument list

        :rew[ind]               first file in argument list

You made a typo:

I shan't give all line specifier possibilities, as it covers a whole

Yes, Elvis. The one you probably already have :-).

Not only. Linux is a Unix-like operating system. This makes it an almost
ideal programming environment, especially when you have to go beyond the
limits of Fortran programming. 

And don't forget that Linux is multitasking. This means that you can do
lots of things while your number crunching program runs in background.

Many people reported in this very newsgroup successful results at
debugging f2c/gcc generated executables using gdb.

  that is because there is *not* a minix filesystem

           Slackware (1.03)
           Kernel pl13

  Long story:  In order to circumvent over-inflated RAM prices, I am
using (2) 1Mx8 SIMMS and (6) 1Mx9 SIMMS with parity checking disabled.
I initially had (4) 1Mx9.  I removed one and replaced it with a 1Mx8,
and used the system for a while and all was fine, so I put in all 8M and
used the system some more, and all was fine.  Previously, as I was disabling
the parity check, I noticed that my wait states were set at 2read/3write
(note: all SIMMS are 70ns) So now that my system is working fine w/8M,
I decided to go play with the wait states.

  I set them to 0read/0write, and booted (using LILO) into MSDOG, played
around a little, and all was fine.  Great, let's try Linux.  I reboot
into Linux and after the message 'Uncompressing Linux' I get 'crc error'
and the system hangs.  Fine, I'll just put the wait states back.  I set
them back to origional, reboot and 'crc error'???!!!  DON'T PANIC YET!
I pull out my trusty boot floppy, and I get the same thing!!! PANIC PANIC PANIC
(I also tried the Slackware install floppy, and same thing)

Any suggetions, hints, comments, words of wisdom?

There some things elvis doesn't do, like displaying long lines wrapped,
but version 1.7 provides many of the previously missing features, like
the tag stack. It does other things that vi doesn't too.

I am using the protein modelling package WHAT IF routinely at home.

The following table is used to map the envelope FROM address to
a country code. When I have time to completely rewrite the counter,
I will allow people to state their country of origin; at the moment,
this will have to do.

Well, yes, I know precisely if that kernel source is to be trusted.

Given the present propagation of c.o.l. groups I presume there's a whole
lot of grepping going on around the world after that remark. I'll try
not to think about what the resulting bunch of cron-birthday-greetings
will do to the university mail server.

Subject: linux utility for backups over several floppies?
Date: Fri, 15 Oct 1993 15:09:19 GMT

Hi,
I saw an announcement a while back for a 
 linux utility for backing up stuff.
It claimed to gracefully work over several floppies 
and had lots of internal checks etc...

However, I can't remember the name .
If any does, or could recommend their preferred way of backing up 
directories (using floppies) I'd appreciate a reply or a post.

thanks,
ira
