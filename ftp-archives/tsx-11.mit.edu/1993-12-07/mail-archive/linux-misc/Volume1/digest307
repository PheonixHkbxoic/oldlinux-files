Subject: How do YOU have "term" set up?
Date: Tue, 16 Nov 1993 18:11:37 GMT

Whoops! My previous post referred to TERM, which is of course the environment
variable used to set your terminal type. Stupid mistake. Maybe this posting
will be more clear.

I finally got Linux working on my machine. Now, I'd like to set up term.  I
played around with it a bit, and was reading the man pages, and realized how
easy it seems to be for people to clobber your personal machine if you allow
logins from the world at large. So, I was wondering how other people have set
term up to work for themselves. If I get enough information, I'll see if I can
set up a TERM-HOWTO to go with the other HOWTO's. To that end, I would ask if
people tell me not only how they set term up on their machines, but why they
chose their setup, and what benefits/problems they've noticed with it.

Also, I'd like to know if anybody has managed to set up term so that it is
virtually transparent on their machine (ie - you can ftp, telnet, e-mail, read
news, etc through the term link).

I am hoping to be able to put together a package, or set of documentation, to
make this procedure easier for everyone. If such a package already exists, I
have not found it yet. And I apologize if it does exist, and I'm wasting
everyone's time.

Please keep in mind that I'm interested in knowing _why_ you chose your setup.
What security risks there are, etc.

Anyway, let's go to it! E-mail responses to the address in my .Sig.

I have seen some posts (was it here?) from companies who are
building and selling Linux systems.  I am interested in
such a system - would those people mind sending me email
on what is available?  Also, if people wouldn't mind sharing
their knowledge on tape drives, hard drives, and VLB-SCSI
controllers, I would really appreciate it.  I have read
the howtos and compat.list, I'm just looking for more info.

Thanks in advance,

  There is a group currently working on porting to the 68030/68040 platform.
Currently, the only thing that really works is the Commodore Amiga series
an mc68030.  Some people are working on the Mac port, but as far as I know
there still isn't a working kernel.  Should be soon.  The port is also being
made to the Atari TT and Sun3's.  Neither of those has a booting kernel either.
All should be close.  To register to the 680x0 mailing list, just send an
empty mail message to linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi and you will
get instructions.

Thanks,
Robin Holt.

Well, Vince,

   Seeing as you have appointed yourself as a net.policeman, you could behave
a bit better - I read ALL comp.os.linux groups, and pay for the priveledge
and don't want to read 20 posts from you :-(. Personal mail may be more
useful.

   I agree that the posting of extracts from the HOWTO's was useful, so
don't take this as a flame, just constructive criticism.

   The reason for uploading things which compile cleanly is to make it
available to those people who either lack the skills, time or disk space to
compile things themselves.

   I would recommend that if a search of the LSM fails to turn up a
useful program that binaries are made available and the LSM form be filled
in and returned. One point I would make is to ask that a pointer be
always left which indicates the location of the original source.

Too bad that it's the wrong answer.  The BusLogic EISA and VLB controllers
have an enhanced mode, but it is not the same as the Adaptec 174x enhanced
mode.  The native mode of the BusLogic controllers is the same as the
Adaptec 154x.

The BusLogic enhanced mode is a lot nicer, too.  You don't have to change
EISA config to change modes; your driver simply puts the card into enhanced
mode.  According to the SCSI driver developer at Microport, adding support
for the BusLogic enhanced mode was absolutely trivial, compared to the
work involved to get the Adaptec working.  Suffice it to say that my
Microport SVR4 box boots with Adaptec 1542b code on the boot/install
floppy, then reinstalls an enhanced SCSI driver that switches the board
into enhanced mode automatically (the enhanced driver, which supports
154x + BusLogic, Adaptec, and DPT enhanced SCSI modes, was too big to fit
in the floppy-boot kernel).  With an Adaptec 174x, you would have to
shut down and reconfigure your hardware to get into enhanced mode.

Runs like a bat out of hell, too.

One of the things missing from UNIX is a proper implementation of
C-THREADS.

Now, from what I have been able to figure out from the HURD
documentation available, is that the process manager will be
implemented as a separate server. However, it is a server, as all
other HURD servers, that will be implemented in user space.

So, if I wanted to add a proper implementation of threads to HURD,
could I just write my own server in user space, advertise the
port-numbero of the serve, and thus add functionality to the kernel
for all users who want it?

  Correct me if I am off base here!

Steve,

it's a SoftModem. 
Today's phonelines and equipment do not allow simultaneous data and fax 
transmission, so why would one need to have both algorithms simultaneously
in RAM when one can't use them at the same time?

Maybe we should look more generally at the software architecture of how
to integrate a general purpose DSP into a PC:

      APPLICATIONS
      Here are the applications running.
      The interface between them and the
      host operating system is defined by
      specs like e.g. TAPI, the Telephony
      Application Programmers Interface
      about which Toby Nixon thinks a lot
      these days. It's available from
      ftp.uu.net /pub/vendor/microsoft last
      time I checked.


                          HOST OPERATING SYSTEM
                          Then here follows the host OS, e.g. Linux.
                          In addition to the OS there is a smaller 
                          program called SoftModem manager or DSP 
                          resource manager or some such. It's used 
                          for example to intercept calls to the DSP 
                          and transparently download the appropriate 
                          algorithms, like data, fax, voicemail, sound 
                          or others from disk into the DSP SRAM.
                        

             DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSOR
             The next module is the DSP itself together
             with very fast RAM, SRAM usually. The Connection
             14.4+ SoftModem uses an Analog Devices 2100
             series DSP and Digicom's DSP algorithms for
             data and fax and a Digicom developped proprietary
             chip to glue the DSP to the ATBus. It's forseeable 
             that a real DSP operating systems, like SPOX is 
             running here is future products. Developping tools 
             are available from Analog Devices, Spectron and maybe 
             in the future also from the net (GNU ADSP2100
             compilers). 


Then again, RISC CPUs might gain in performance faster than DSPs, thus
making it possible to run digital signal processing algorithms directly
on the host CPU without slowing other processes significantly. Currently
DSPs have quite a cost advantage over RISC CPUs, though, and it seems
that more and more developers are switching to the Signal Computing 
Architecture.

: Further, the 14.4 + v42bis code does not support slower speeds (2400).
: This is a pain in the neck. To call work, I have to reload the modem with
: slow code. For normal use, I have to reload the modem with fast code. For
: uucico, I have to switch back to the 9600 module (because of dropped data
: at 14.4).

If you don't like switching I recommend to use the DATA144 algorithm 
which supports V.42 error correction and speeds from 1200 to 14,400 bps.
Digicom is also thinking about including the lower speed protocols in 
a future revision of the DATA144B file.

Cheers,

Wolfgang

It is in alpha-test, and I'd guess will soon be generally available.

[ ideas about cthreads and the HURD deleted ]

According to MIBs latest documentation, cthreads are being added to
the GNU C Library:

   Roland is working on the library.  Most of the remaining architectural
   work is done and being tested.  Then Roland will work on integrating
   cthreads (which is mostly busywork), miscellaneous filesystem calls,
   and then file descriptors.  After that comes signals.
