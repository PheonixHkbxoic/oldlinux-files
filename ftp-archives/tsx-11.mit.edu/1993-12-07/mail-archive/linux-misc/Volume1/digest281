Subject: Pcomm 2.0.1 on Linux
Date: 7 Nov 93 02:26:16 GMT

Has anyone been able to make Pcomm work on Linux? I'm using the Slackware
version (0.99, patch level 13). It compiles, but when I try to run it, I
get the following message:

%pcomm
couldn't open file.
%

Anyone know what file it can't open? Someone told me I had ncurses installed
incorrectly, but then, how could I have? It was installed by the install
program.

Thanks for any help on this matter,
        Ivan Samuelson

<sigh> I thought this problem only occured with SLS. The ncurses that comes
with SLS and Slackware is old and on top of that incorrectly installed.
PLEASE, remove any ncurses stuff and get a fresh copy from netcom.com:
pub/zmbenhal
NOTE: sysinstall -remove ncurses WILL NOT work! Make sure you do:
'rm /usr/lib/lib?curses.a'

Why don't you use big fonts ?
I have 15" monitor running at 1024x768.
I am using 18pt fonts for xterm (in fact 16 pt is more than enough
but I wanted to read characters even when I lean far back). 
For others I use 14 or 12 pt.
25 hours a day, no problem ( 8-) ).

But I agree that you need a bigger monitor if you want to see many windows
at the same time  (Some of my friends like to work on 21" monitor,
using 8 or  9 pt fonts, opening 5 or 6 xterms, xfig, postscript previewer,
...etc.

I am sure that I can work longer in 15" monitor using bigger fonts.

Yep. It's called OpenVMS, and it is like VMS, except there is no point
in getting it since you wouldn't preserve compatibility anyway.  Over
this summer I ported the LEPTO lib from ol' VAXen to the Alphas, the
former run VMS, the latter run OpenVMS. Wasn't much fun. Took a long
long time.

No, the ncurses that comes with Slackware 1.1.0 is the newest version 1.8 
from netcom.com, and includes all the docs and demo sources. It works fine.

The ncurses that comes with old Slackware is old. If people don't upgrade
it, that's not my fault.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

They are all chips that implement VGA compatible video, with
the addition of good accelerated operations: bit-block-transfers
and hardware cursor being the primary ones.
The board maker must add video RAM, video clocks, and RAMDACs.

The S3 86C801 and S3 86C805 are twins.
Each uses 1 or 2 Meg of DRAM.
The '801 is designed to interface to an ISA bus.
The '805 is designed to interface to a VESA local bus.

The S3 86C928 uses 1 to 4 M of VRAM, and optionally
some DRAM.  It can connect to either ISA or VLB,
at the board maker's choice.

The problem with VRAM based cards is that VRAM is expensive.
The problem with DRAM based cards is that the video refresh
and video drawing are competing for the limited bandwidth to
the video memory.  Drawing performance will therefore suffer
when you push to large screens or deep color planes.
     1024x768x8 non-interlaced is already starting to tax an
801/805, but it still beats non-accelerated cards hands down!
(That's what I use and like.)

This sort of thing is covered more in the
comp.windows.x.i386unix newsgroup.

If this isnt already a FAQ it should be - ter1.0.7 stopped working
recenly due to the exact thing you just described above.

The solution? Grab term 1.0.8 from you favourite linux ftp site
and all problems will be solved..

Hope this helps...

Get #9 Level 12 2M VRAM + 1M DRAM,
it has the highest v-refresh rate as far as I'm aware

110+Hz at 1024x768 (spec: 90 Hz)
84+Hz at 1280x1024 (spec: 76 Hz)

those ones supported by my Viewsonic 17 and tested using
#9 MS Windows(TM) 3.1 utilities.

Since XFree 2.0 only support upto 85Hz DOT CLOCK (using Bt805),
I only run X at 1024x768 @76Hz. Turning off Bt805 hw cursor
will sometimes screw up the mouse shape but fine at 1152x819.
(1280x768 flickers too much at 110Hz DC)

As soon as the new patch for XFree_S3 2.0 comes out,
I will run X on Linux at 1152x819, 1152x900 or even 1280x768
with 2048x819 virtual screen! 8P

From: tiv@ludens.elte.hu
Subject: XFree86-2.0 problems on WD90C31
Date: 7 Nov 93 14:11:45 +0100

I've encountered some problems while upgrading from XFree86-1.3 to 2.0

My setup is:
386DX40 with 8 megs of RAM and a
Western Digital Paradise Accelerator Card, with WD90C31 chip and 1MB

When I started X first time, it started OK, but upon exit it didn't switch
properly back to text mode, so the display became unreadable and I had to
reboot. The effect was like if you switch to 1024x768 mode on a 640x480
monitor (a trembling, messy screen).
And after that I wasnt able to start X once more (until reboot).
It didn't detected clock values above 28 Mhz, so the clocks line was full of
zeros, and some clock values like 25.20 18.10 28.30 etc. (not in this
order).

I put back the old XF86_SVGA (the 1.3) server, and now I'm using that.

Please help if you can...
