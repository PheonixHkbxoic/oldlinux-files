Actually, (in the US, I dunno about foreign markets )you can get a Maxtor 340
meg drive for $305 through Computability. 245 meg drives are going for around
$250, I think.  Hard drive prices are dropping like a rock right now.  Three

These are auxillary boxes. They won't be doing anything serious. What
I'm searching for is a Mono X terminal (for me) that can run DOS/Windows apps
(for my wife and kids). They will not do any compiling, run mono X, and
only use their local disk for swap. I'm looking for the cheapest usable
configuration, not the best.

The main server will one day be a 40 Mhz 486 (Go AMD!), 256K cache, at least 
16 Megs of memory, 1280x1024 S3 based video, and at least 340 Megs of HD. 
Serious enough? ;-) Strangly enough that total upgrade is only $1650 or so. 
Fortunately since I have a working system now (40 Mhz 386, 4 Meg RAM, 120
Meg HD, Herc video) I can upgrade piecemeal in $400-$500 chuncks. 

The first upgrade if any for the sattelites would be a SVGA 14" monitor.
At that point I'd of course have to upgrade to 8 Megs of RAM for decent
X performance. About $400 extra (based on $200 for 14 inch SVGA, $80 for
an ET4000 board, and $120 for 4 More megs of memory.). I also figure to
get about $70 back on the resale of the mono VGA monitor and the basic VGA
card if I don't move it into another sattlite. $330 extra for a usable
machine is not bad. In fact the total sattelite cost is still under $1000.
Add a bigger HD and you have a standalone seconday server for $1100 or so!

That's the best part of Linux. Real UNIX. Commodity Hardware.

One last question - has anyone tried SLIP at 115200 BPS? Is it responsive?
How is NFS? I can cheapen my cost even more by running SLIP between the
main server and the sattelites instead of Ethernet. $110 for an STB 4-port
which will connect up to 4 sattlites and $25 for a 16550/16450 dual serial
card for the satellites. Hmmmm. Upgrade to RS485. Switch crystals to bump
up the baud rate. Yeah - that's the ticket! ;-)

MicroSloth has released "Word for DOS 6.0", and I was wondering if
anyone has had any success running it under Linux using Dosemu.  I've
kept my DOS partition around because I need word for windoze, but if
Word will work under dosemu (the DOS version of Word, I mean), then
maybe I can scrap windoze altogether.

If you've tried this (or even if you are just running Word under DOS,
w/out dosemu), I'd be interested in hearing your comments, in particular
with respect to usability.  Thanks!

Well, there's a couple MatLab clones (Rlab and something else), a simple
finite element anaylsis toolkit (FElt), and some other stuff.  I'll be
doing most of my computational fluid dynamics work on my Linux box once
it's up and running, and anything I come up with that's worth releasing
will probably end up on sunsite or tsx-11 (mostly visualization stuff
most likely).

BTW, how much interest would there be in getting the NetLib packages
(LinPack, BLAS, EisPack, and other numerical methods packages) compiled
and put into shared libraries?  I might be willing to coordinate such an
effort if I'm not the only person on the planet interested...

I wouldn't find it acceptable. Also you didn't talk about video. For
X apps it's the #1 component. Followed closely by the others ;=)

I'd suggest three things:

1) Buy at least a 40 Mhz 386DX MB. The cost is $135 retail all over the place
   with 64K cache ($20 more for 128K). A 386SX20 couldn't be half the cost
   of that and the gain in productivity is immense. If your boss has more
   money to spend (yeah, right!) then go with a 40 Mhz 486 MB. Street priced
   right around $400 (about the same price as a 486-33 MB). Inbetween those
   you can get a 486SX33 or a Cyrix 486DLC40. But no less than a 40 Mhz 386DX.

2) 80 Meg is enough iff (if and only if) you'll be mounting stuff from the
   network. A full Linux install is running about 100M now. You'll probably
   also need a swap partition. If it must be standalone I'd say no less than
   170 Meg.

3) Memory is the most important component of a Linux setup. The more the better
   - 8 is better than 6, 16 is better than 8. Of course with memory prices
   nowadays it's better to wait. However I'd push for 8 Meg at the very least.

Tell your boss that X and compiling are hogs on everything - CPU, video (for X)
, memory, and disk. The setup he proposed is great for a satellite station
(see the thread I started, Linux Satellites) but if you're going to be
compiling and running Xwindows Apps you need quite a bit more horsepower.

Post back with the amount of money that's available to spend. I'm sure we'll
all suggest ways to spend it ;-)

P.S. I'll send a consulting fee forthwith! ;-)

I can't seem a way to find X386 to use mouse port. I don't
see '/dev/mouse' or anythinging like that. I am using MCC 1.3
distribution (Is this mean I have to go back to SLS, ugh.....).

P.S:  Does anyone has VGA Color driver for Versa UltraLite Laptop?


well someone else had a similar problem.
one solution is to run syssetupbb
( in etc) and it will prompt you ofr mouse, modem

theis is a problem with mcc if i remeber right from

Subject: Laptops with pen interfaces
Date: Tue, 17 Aug 1993 18:57:14 GMT

I have been looking for a laptop on which to run Linux.

There are a couple laptops which either now, or will shortly, have pen
interfaces to their screens.  It would be pretty cool if the pen interface
could be used on Unix/X .. perhaps.  Getting the OCR to work would be `hard'
and isn't what I'd be looking for.  Instead I'd want to use it in place of
the mouse for moving/resizing windows, pressing buttons, dragging objects
around, and possibly in drawing programs.

Does anybody have any idea if such a pen interface could be supported in
a normal way?  Or would it have to be an `input extension'?  If it is
an input extension, would there be any trouble using it to move/resize
windows and the rest?  Or why is the sky blue? ;-)

Don't use mmap on Linux, because it is not similar to the SunOS mmap (yet

        Where did you get this idea from??  NNTP is available everywhere for
Linux, but the question is do you really need it???  NNTP is just a transfer
protocol.  If you're going to store the articles on your linux box, then you
will need both NNTP and cnews or INN.

        To just connect up to another host with a newsreader, all of the
NNTP calls will be carried out by the newsreader and will exist in the
newsreader source.  Just get the xrn sources and go.

What is it with the disk space enthusiasts? What do you lot _do_ with your disk
space? I am perfectly happy with a 40 MB Hard Drive, 7MB of which I am using
for swap. Yes, I am running X, and I have plenty of room to compile things.
Admittedly, I never keep source on the hard disk, but why bother? It doesn't
take very long to mount a floppy and untar the source tree does it? I have all
the man pages on the disk as well.

I suppose I have saved a lot of room by not being on the net (no email, no news)

I'll let you into a secret - you don't need emacs!

170 - 40 = 130MB. Even if you add up elm, net-2, and TeX that doesn't make
130MB by a long way!

I have 5 megs and it's livable, provided I don't try and do too much. If
compiling and using X at the same time, nice the compile. I compiled the
latest perl this morning whilst still in X, and perl is a lot bigger than the
kernel. If I was trying to compile things for a living though I'd want 8 Megs
at least (that should be OK, I have never gone more than 3MB into swap).

Course if I had a processor a bit faster than a 386-16 it might help...

On the other hand, there are a lot of disk labelling questions in
c.o.3.* that aren't in c.o.l.  :-)

Opinions and possibly skewed history follow...

My personal opinion is that there was an active comp.os.minix group that
was eagerly awaiting the release of a Net/2 derived Unix for the 386.
Bruce Evans (I think) released a series of 'unofficial' changes to minix
that allowed it to work pretty well on the 386.  Shortly after that,
Linus broke from the fold (with a resounding 'F' from ast for
reinventing the monolithic operating system) and release Linux in it's
original unusable version (no shell??? or something).  Then a BUNCH of
people jumped ship from minix to Linux.  My resounding opinion is that
none of this would have happened as quickly as it did without Andrew
Tanenbaum's work on minix and the introduction of comp.os.minix.

Lots of people were still waiting for 386bsd to be released while the
rest were writing new code for Linux.  By the time the 386bsd 0.0 
version was released (I am getting old, memory may be fuzzy here), 
Linux was fully on the way to becoming a REAL operating system.  

Many people were (and still are) more comfortable with an OS that was 
written from scratch than one that had any relationship with USL.  There
are MANY factors that people can cite that have a bearing on which OS
people are using.  One advantage each:

Linux:  Uses shared libraries (crufty or elegant, I don't know but have 
heard both)  which reduces the amount of disk space required for the 
executables, thereby making the software 'cheaper'.   

386BSD: Had networking code first.  This was a big draw for many early
users that HAD to have a working network available from the start.

One of the other features that seems to seperate the two systems is the
'feel' of the systems.  Linux has evolved into a very POSIX compliant
system, which gives it a feel like SysV.  *BSD has very much a BSD feel 
(duh).

Most of Europe seems to have adopted Linux as their system of choice.  I
expect that this is (in part, at least) to the fact that Linus is from
Europe.  Why put up with those silly export restrictions and long
distance network connections when Linux is available right there on the
continent.  

One final point.  The seeming stagnation of 386bsd early in its growth, 
while the patchkit was being put together, may have turned many potential 
supporters off.  Linux was growing virtually before your eyes, while 
386bsd was being fixed ever so slowly.  Whether that was because it was
an inherently better system of not is just bait for a flamewar.

Whether 386bsd or Linux is a better operating system ultimately boils
down to point of view.  Linux has the advantage of not being fragmented
quite as much as the Net/2 derived systems, but the Net/2 derived
systems have the advantage of years of use on other systems before they
were ported to the 386...
