Subject: sqprint, a multi-page filter for HP Laserjets
Date: 5 Oct 1993 19:48:47 -0500

The following PERL script was written to print multiple pages in landscape
mode on a Hewlett-Packard Laserjet Series printer (PCL-lang only).
I conducted a search for other programs which would do this, but the search
was fruitless.  I hope the general community finds this program useful.

To use this program, you must install it in your printcap file.  I put mine
in the "cf" entry, for example, in my BSD-based system:

lp|local line printer:\
        :lp=/dev/lpa0:sd=/var/spool/lpd:lf=/var/log/lpd-errs:sh:\
        :if=/usr/foreign/bin/if_ljet3:\
        :cf=/usr/foreign/bin/sqprint:

The cf entry stands for "cif filter", or something like that.  Since I don't
have cif on my machine, I used the empty printcap slot for my filter.
However, if you install sqprint as a filter on your machine, be warned that
users who attempt to print cif files, or whatever filter you used, will have
quite a surprise in store for them.

To print on my system, I use:
        lpr -c inputfilename

The "-c" tells lpd to print the file using the cif output filter.

Unfortunately, very few useful arguments (such as input filename, etc) are
passed to any filters except "if" or "of", both of which you will probably
not want to override.  If you do override the "if" or "of" filters, you will
have to change the print_footer routine at the end of the file.

There is no guarantee of support from me, although I will probably continue
to add features as I find them useful.  I never intend to make a MS-DOS port.

I will not answer any mail regarding "how to install this program" or
"the program won't work with my HP calculator, what is wrong?".  If you have
problems, you will have to resolve them yourself.

Check you printcap and lpr manpages for more info.

Same thing happened to me on a Laptop 386SX. It hang after the code
to detect the soundcard. However, just after the floppy drive was
detected. A line 'floppy: unexpected interrupt' shown up. And I thought
that has something to do with the hangs. Hope this will help someone
trap down the problem.

This is completely false! You can use QUEL embedded in C just like
you can with postgres. Installation consists of typing 'make install'
and running the INSTALL.ME script.

I had to bring down my system in an unclean state, and when I rebooted
I had a most curious output from e2fsck:

e2fsck 0.3, 93/04/22 for EXT2FS 0.3a
Inode 109, incorrect size, 36864 (counted = 36864). Set size to counted? no

The strange part being that the incorrect and counted sizes are the
same.  I doubt this is anything serious, and one fsck later it looked
fine and mounted clean.  But still, it seemed a strange thing.

I think, an additional problem is that you can 't get the software or
even the system itself if you don 't have a modem. I don't know how it is in 
the USA but here in Germany there are only a few companies selling software 
for Linux (these companies think that they can make a lot of money of
selling programs that THEY get for free ... :-( ). And - do the people pay for 
programs that they have to compile on their machine? What the average
computer user wants is a system that is ready (or almost ready) to run. 
When the people need help they can't get it because they have no modem ... 
There are so many difficulties installing and running a Linux system. 
Unfortunately, at the moment Linux is only a system for experts - or for 
people who may send questions to comp.os.linux.* :-)

When there is a magazine for Linux that can help the people AND when there
is a almost complete Linux system that you may easily install and that you
may WORK WITH (easy word processing ... :) ), then there will be a much 
larger number of people who use Linux.

assuming that you're talking about postgres 4.1 instead of 4.0.1...
you are actually referring to two separate things.  the part where
the installation script doesn't change the master dba name to your 
user name if you don't have a "postgres" account is a bug.  (to be
fair, the instructions *say* you should create a "postgres" account 
and install as "postgres" ..)  as to the frontend-library-uses-USER 
part..

think a bit more about it.  this is a complete non-issue when you 
consider that the postmaster sits on a *non-privileged* tcp port and 
does no authentication whatsoever (unless you use kerberos -- 4.1 
does has krb4 and krb5 support).

the lack of network security (without kerberos) isn't exactly a 
secret.  it's fully spelled out in the version 4.1 reference manual.

password schemes can either be net-sniffed or wind up reproducing
kerberos.  something like hosts.equiv is possible but would be a 
bandaid at best..

I would second this. Granted I've been around both Unix and DOS a
long time, but I've never installed Unix on a PC before, and 
I got MCC up and running in a day, and X the next day. That
was it. Everything is perfectly spiff now, and it all fit well
into the 80 meg partition I'd left for Linux (I made 16 of those
megs into swap and it all *still* fits even when I compile modest
X programs).

I need major RAM upgradage, and I'd love to know if there's a way
of keeping 1024x768 mode from being displayed off to the right so
I have to whang my horizontal- center dial all the way over (I have
a no- name ET4000- based card in my Fastmicro 386/40, anybody
else got one of these things? They disappeared it seems, but
they did build me a good machine- pity I have no RAM installation
instructions for it), but by and large Linux has come up with
incredible ease.
