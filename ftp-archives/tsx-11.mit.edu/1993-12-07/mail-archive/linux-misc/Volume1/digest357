Without VRAM (which is most of the price difference) you will never get
a good 1280x1024 (e.g. 50Hz or below I think). So if you want
1280x1024 you should get a 928 or a ATI Mach32 based card with VRAM.
1280x1024@60Hz need a 110MHz clock. Such a pixel clock DRAM will not tolerate
without dire performance loss (remember the GE has to use the DRAm, too, not
only the RAMDAC).

For XFree86 Cirrus is much worse than S3 801/5, as the support for them is
far from optimal. If ypou want to have a fast card up to 1024x768
you should get a 801/54 card with 45ns DRAM. If you can stand 60Hz modes, you 
can drive it at 1152x800, too, but performance will be worse than at 1024x768.

I am not sure that we want this. Why should we allow some people we do 
not know, who have no 'name' for being in the 'core' developer group
and who are the only ones who will say who can be part of this consortium 
to restrict distributing linux. The problem is, that by restricting distributions
you may well restrict development on the thing (if you do not like a feature
you just do not approve of any distribution that has it included, e.g.).
I do _Not_ think that this will happen (and it is not meant as any personal
insult), but we have to do some worst-case analysis.

so one of my main reasons to hate it is the paragraph 
   o The secretary of the consortium chooses members. The members choose
     the secretary. No member may be involved in an operation seeking to
     obtain Consortium approval.
So this could be clearly be set up as a one or two member consortium doing
all this 'restricting', most of all as testers are not considered members
automatically.
The other thing is that nowhere it is mentioned that the LC is a non-profit 
organisation (i.e. no fees are taken for approval). If this is not the case,
this would be contrary to the general Linux spirit of being free.

Are you conviced that such one will be the best? I really am not. It will
only lead to some distributions being more expensive than others (having a label
will usually increase the price by 50%). It seems only to be a advertising
trick for some people (while other packages might not get it (not because
of lack of quality but because of some obscure other reasons)).

I think this idea is a Bad Thing in this form. There should be rather made
effords to make good distributions, not to jugde them. If there is a free 
distribution (that can be handeled for a copy fee) that is real good, there
were no need for judging others, as this will be The Distribution.

        Figure I'd post here since I haven't posted here in a while.
I recently installed pl14 hoping that it would cure me of the network
problems that have been plaguing me since I first started using linux.
My problem is that I am on a heavy traffic network (about 3000 machines I'd say)
that does not have any routers between machines. (just one between us and
our T1) anyway, needless to say there is a lot of garble on the net, so I was 
hoping the new defragmentation stuff would fix my problems.  THings went 
fine over thanksgiving when no one was on campus, and I achieved a whole
16 hours of uptime without crashing.  Anyway, today, I have been running pl14
and still my computer seems to crash quite regularly. (it is net related since
another linux machine also on the net running pl14 always crashes
at the same time as mine does) anyway, I was curious about one thing,
now for some reason my screen just freezes when the machine dies.. before
I used to get a string of arp errors, or I would get a 
possible cable problem error whever the machine crashed.. that was with pl13
I used 13r,s, and t, but none of these gave any warning either.
Of course I could just be trying to cram to much stuff onto my 486
(gopher server, mud, newsreaders, mail, and multiple users,and anon ftp)
but.. who knows.. I pray for the day that my machine will stay up for 24
hrs without crashing.
anyone haveing more luck out there?

I have....
486/33 .. 300 meg scsi, 40 meg ide, cabletron fiber ethernet card (ne2000 comp)
gcc 2.4.5 (Ik now I'm upgrading that soon), pl14
what else.
I use tin as a newreader,smail, circle2.0 mud code, and gopher1.12

Ian

If you get interesting responses could you summarize, please?

I, too, am interested in hooking an old DOS box up to my shiny new
Linux box, and numerous others have expressed interest recently also.

There is ka9q (wuarchive.wustl.edu:~/mirrors/msdos/ka9q) and the
Clarkson packet drivers for SLIP; is there an PLIP implementation for
DOS out there?

Anyone that has physical access to your machine represents a potential
danger. They can do worse things than just read and write your
disk. They can remove it or physically trash it. They can do unspeakable
things to the inside of your system. If you have you system in a 
place that is physically accessable in an uncontrolled fashion by
people you do not have very good reason to trust, move it. The very
first security measure to implement is physical security. Without that,
nothing else makes any sense.

Weren't those the byte offsets where the root device was encoded?  That is,
if you wanted to change the root device, you edited the two bytes at those
offsets.  (I remember doing something like this with joe or jove or jed or
something, just because I didn't have any other tool available after I 
had crashed my system.  :-)

If you've bought your motherboard already, that's altogether too bad
since you're the ideal customer for the IBM 486SLC2-50 or 66.  With
this motherboard you can put in SIMM's 2 at a time instead of 4, so you
can install 2 4Mb SIMM's now (cheaper than 8 1Mb SIMM's), and add the
other 8Mb later without having to resell a whole bunch of 1Mb SIMM's
(pity more people didn't know about this alternative, one sees so many
ads for 8 1 MB SIMM's!).  Caveat: there are only 4 SIMM slots, making
your limits 4Mb with 1Mb SIMM's and 16Mb with 4Mb SIMM's, and the
addressing structure has too few bits to let you use 16Mb SIMM's.
Lovely big internal cache though, 16Kb, with an external cache of 64Kb
upgradeable to 128K.  Coprocessor (387SX) is extra but these are down
to $35 these days at e.g. Pixel USA, 408-929-7218 (San Jose Mercury
News 11/28 p.4F).

I've been running Linux on a -50 for three months now, goes like a
charm, just a tad slower than my DX2-33 so I imagine the -66 would be
the equivalent of a DX2-40 (the chip on my just-arrived Gateway
Handbook).  And they're getting very cheap these days, Hi-Tech USA
(415-508-8688) has them for respectively $212 and $246
(San Jose Mercury News 11/28 p.5F).

To answer your question, I started with 8Mb and X ran ok (a lot better
than with 4Mb!) under fvwm, but it thrashes badly under the much bigger
openlook. It speeded up a little when I added another 8Mb, and
openlook speeded up a lot.
