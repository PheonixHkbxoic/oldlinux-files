Hello, Linux Users.

I dont know if it is easy to answer to my questions,
may be it is in the FAQ-s.

What PC must I have to run linux on it?

Or maybe is-it easier to enumerate what the PC MUST NOT HAVE? Ex.:

        - less than ??? MBytes RAM, and
        - a computer ???? bus, and
        - a ???? hard disk model ?????, and
        .....

Thank you for your answers!

Walnut Creek had one called Source Code CDROM. It's got comp.sources

        I just received and installed the Trans-Ameritech CDROM. The
installation went very well, and there are multiple options
for installations. SLS 1.02 is there, along with a "live" 1.02 that
you can run directly from the CDROM. 1.03 is also there, which has 
kernel support for your SONY CD (although I've heard about bugginess
in that patch level. There's also a Slackware installation on the disk,
alone with a 386BSD complete distribution, a directory filled with DOS
and Windows stuff (from Simtel) and two directories of sound and picture
files.
        For $30, you really can't beat this. They appear to have tested
the Linux installations very well. 
        I recommend this for someone getting into Linux or
returning to it after some time (like me!).

I have .8, but can't compile it.  Someone said it has something
to do with a "header file bug", but I'm not sure what I should
do to correct it (so that it won't break anything else).   Is
there an "official" fix?

Not that I'm aware of, but there are certain things you can do:

1) alias rm to something like mv $* /tmp/unrmable and have a cron job clean
out that dir every day/hour/whatever. Then, just unrm stuff from that
directory. 

2) Search your archives for Linus's story about wiping out his entire kernel
source dir (or something like that) and recovered it by hacking fsck.
Something like taking advantage of the fact that the minix filesystem
doesn't do synchronous updates. 

3) Get an optical WORM drive ;-)

        The Panasonic CR-562B is a nice double speed CDROM drive
with a soundblaster style interface.

        The Panasonic CR-562B is one of eight drives here on which
the upcoming Yggdrasil LGX production release was tested.  The CR-562B
subjectively seemed to be the fastest, faster even than the Texel dm3024,
although the fast Toshiba SCSI CDROM was not tested.  The CR-562B was
tested connected to the TopTek "universal CDROM interface" that it
comes with, connected to a SoundBlaster Pro, and connected to a
SoundBlaster 16ASP.  The CR-562B never exhibited any problems, and
neither did the other soundblaster compatible driver, the LaserMate.

        There was, however, one anonomoly with the TopTek CDROM
controller.  There is a 486DX2/66 Opti chipset EISA/VLB motherboard
here that freezes if you start X windows with the TopTek CDROM controller
present.  The problem is reproducible with different video cards,
and seems to be a function of the presence of the TopTek card rather
than the drive.  The problem does not occur the other motherboard on
which this was run.

        Eberhard Moenkeberg's Linux soundblaster CDROM driver is new,
so it isn't built into of any standard Linux distribution yet, although
it is possible that the source has made it onto one of the FTP snapshots
on CD that are floating around.  This driver is, however, built into the
LGX production release, which is coming out next week.  You can get the
source code for the driver by anonymous FTP from ftp.gwdg.de in
pub/linux/cdrom.  If you want the source code for the version of the
driver that is on the LGX production release, that is in
netcom.com:pub/yggdrasil/misc/sbpcd.c.  The LGX version of the
driver automatically scans the different possible IO addresses, uses
the kernel's IO port reservation package to avoid stepping on other
IO devices or being stepped on, and adds support for the additional
port addresses that the SoundBlaster 16ASP can use.

Let it die.  It's not doing anything more for the BSD groups than it is for
the OS/2 groups... rather like the poster.

This is not specific to the procps package - I had this problem
with the modules package, too.  The errors disappear when you
delete the "C" on those lines - they are both extern definitions
to the extent of
extern "C" blah blah
       ^^^
 The stuff compiled when I removed this, but then the kernel would
not compile without it.  Anyone know why its giving a parse error?

That is an C++ external declaration.  Since the compiler isn't in C++
mode, it doesn't recognize this syntax.

pl13 should clear these troubles up nicely, since C++ code has been
removed from the sources.

as someone else mentioned, no but you can alias rm to something else.

There's a pretty elaborate package called 'delete' available from
sipb.mit.edu.  It works by renaming files from mumble to .#mumble;
then there are tools to undelete, and to purge the files marked for
deletion, either all at once or selectively.
