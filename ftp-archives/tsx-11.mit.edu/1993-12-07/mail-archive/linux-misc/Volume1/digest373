Andreas Klemm basically says it's no use to evaluate free software,
since there's no money in it, and people won't produce commercial
quality software gratis.

There are already several companies _selling_ Linux-
distributions. They earn money. They are interested in competing with
Solaris, SCO or what have you. So the distributors will be interested
in getting a Linux Review Board badge slapped onto their product.

The biggest problem Magnus will have to face is getting competent and
willing testers. The Linux Review Board can't (or rather shouldn't)
charge a fee for the badge like some of the environment-friendly
badges do - that would be contrary to Linux philosophy, since it would
rule out e.g. Slackware getting a badge.

Anybody who reads your comments below will realize that you haven't a
clue what 'suited for novices' means -- you didn't have to spell it
out. If you're not interested in novices, say so and leave it at that.
Those of us whose livelihood involves catering to novices (yes, they
even qualify as human beings and *everything*) *are* interested, and will
do whatever it takes to keep them out of hot water. For most computer
users, solving a glitch by recompiling the kernel is not an option.

I suggest you either *read* the quotations you're critizing or
conserve bandwidth. The consortium is to judge quality; the testers
will be experienced, not inexperienced. This experience they will
place at the disposal of the less-experienced, through the LC
mechanism, so that they might have more to go on when they choose a
distribution. These means that distributors will finally have to put
up with the heat or get out of the kitchen.

>Most problems come along with shitty hardware ! Don't say. it's unimportant.

You've counted all the problems with Linux distributions and
determined that the majority of these problems arise due to inadequate
hardware platforms? I venture to doubt that. So unless you consider
all hardware other than the particular machine the developer happened
to use to be inadequate, this comment seems to be a bit less
thought-out than some of your gems of wisdom.

>>o We do not judge support.

Of course the LC doesn't judge support. How could they? Create
problems and ask the distributor to "support" them? *Ask* the
distributor how good their support is?

>>o We judge documentation; or rather that it matches the software.

>It's free Software my dear, you can judge as you like, you'll have
>to find someone who is willed to write documentation for $ 0.02 ;-)

Why do you assume that you can find lots of coders to write C for
free, but not lots of writers to write documentation for free? Because
you assume everybody in the Linux consortium writes as badly as
yourself? Or because you assume that if source code is good enough
documentation for you, it should be good enough for anybody? The LC's
public is to be novices, not you, so this assumption doesn't apply.
I've even heard that there are computer users out there WHO CANNOT
READ C CODE!!!! In Germany, hackers would say 'Igittigitt!' --
translates roughly as "EEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWW" with a falling intonation.

>It's free software, you can do with it or package it, as you like.

Precisely. That's the *source* of the problem that the LC wants to
help solve. By the same token: it's free software, you can judge it
and publish your opinions about it, as you like. Which we shall, my
friend, which we shall.

>If I would do the job, then I would prefer to rely on my own not
>on a consortium I don't know ... With "funny" ideas ...

Ahhhhh, but if you were a *novice*, now, then you *wouldn't*, now
would you? You said yourself above that an inexperienced person can't
judge the quality. So what is a novice supposed to do? Ask *YOU*?

Correct. A novice will either have to buy a system with pre-intalled
OS or be able to *easily* install everything him/herself. This does
*not* include applying patch diffs to kernel source and putting Images
in the write place and rdev'ing them etc. etc. etc. I also does not

emitting English prose. Anybody who feels stepped on by that remark is
an exception to the rule, I'm sure...

Rough translation in English: "Old Boy Network". My comment: hardly.
Every organization not created by law or otherwise by fiat must
somehow bootstrap itself into existence. Since you don't think there
should be a consortium at all, whether with ostensible old boys or
with members chosen by drawing straws out of a hat, you probably don't
have a workable alternative to the bootstrapping process. If you do,
you've kept it to yourself.

>My $0.02: Forget about it. Create a mailing list where you people

Why? What are you afraid of? Any results of the LC can be contested.
You can also go out and tell all novice acquirers of Linux
distributions that *you* know better than than the LC, that they
should take *your* word for what's best for them (although you
yourself have stated above that you don't even know what 'suitable for
novices' means), that *your* opinion is of *much* greater value than
that of any old consortium. In fact, I suggest you *do* do that; while
you're doing that, you can't be posting to this thread...

Seriously, we all value your comments. It's just that your priorities
and ours are diametrically opposed. That's fine, we accept that, but
you're going to have to accept it as well.

Do I understand you correctly that you can consider non-user-friendly

The same way I learned about Linux when I was temporarily separated
from Internet access. I read Unix journals. This might not be an
option for you, but lots of users do so as a matter of course. Not
everybody relies on the Internet for all their information; there are
even a few people out there ('Igittigitt' once again) that have no
Internet access and have no easy means of getting it.

Magnus never claimed, to my knowledge, that the LC would be 'the ones'
who can judge anything. He just claimed that the LC *would* judge.
Every other person and every other organization is free to do the
same. I choose to support Magnus' endeavor, for several reasons.  One
reason is that I would otherwise have to acquire and test candidate
distributions all by myself, because I support Linux novices as part
of my livelihood. Another reason is that I know of no other
organization with a similar goal -- I'm sure you're not starting one,
because you have no interest in novices. Finally, I've read Magnus'
postings and corresponded with him privately and tried to follow the
various criticisms that have been raised here in the newsgroup, and
have come to the conclusion that Magnus' approach has a strong chance
of success. You are and everybody else is free to make their own
choices.

I thought it might be amusing for me to comment on these bits of
Andreas' address for those of you who don't have a command of
colloquial German. 'Knobel' comes from one of the German equivalents
of 'hacking'; 'knirsch' is one of the German equivalents of 'minor
crash' in the sense of hardware or software breaking down, especially
when a collision of incompatible components is involved (as when an
executable can't find the right version of a shared library -- not
surprising, sometimes, when the version in question hasn't even been
released yet). Certainly no kind of problem for your trusty hacker.
There are lots of professionals out here, though, who happen to be
computer and/or Unix and/or Linux novices and who don't want to put up
with that kind of thing. As a matter of fact, I'm not a novice at all,
but I refuse to patch kernels. How do you like them apples? 

The Linux Consortium continues to enjoy my unswerving support.

The two I received were totally okay. Please stop bashing on Jana. I think they
are not SOOO bad. I mean: If you would start a business you probably also would
have some problems to get it up and running neatly (I know from my own
experience). Alright there ARE some things that make customers (including
myself) unhappy. My experience until now:

1) They never answered any mail I've sent them (I never called them, because
it's too expensive from Switzerland). This hopefully changes with Morse
Telecom. I will try out.

2) It takes a LONG time to get the CD. In my case I think this is not Jana's
fault. I received mine yesterday but the post stamp was from 11-08-93, so it
took almost a month to reach me (by AIRMAIL !). I suspect that the customs let
it hang around for a while. So blame the post-office or the customs not Jana.

3) During a long time when there was C.O.L. already scheduled to be eliminated
they only posted to C.O.L. and not to the new newsgroups. This was definitely
wrong but everybody makes mistakes sometimes. I tried to tell them by email
(but... see point 1). Morse Telecom seems to know where to post public info.

4) Not a problem: The two CD's I received: There was no broken case or any
other problem, I checked out the new one yesterday and I think it's quite a
good collection of SW (they're getting better), although I think one could
still improve it (Remove the the Next stuff and fill it with lots of additional
[not necessarily linux-related] free unix SW). Jana/Morse are you listening ?

5) It would be REALLY nice to have a label on the CD (when first putting it in
I actually did it the wrong way ;-)). Isn't it possible to have a label on the
CD even for the low price we pay ? Jana/Morse are you listening ?

Conclusion: Jana is improving and we should give them a chance. Remember: We
get quite a lot of stuff for not very much money (i.e: $10 per CD (minus 3.85
canadian $ for postage in my case)). If you are willing to pay $40 or more per
CD go and buy another distribution. Let us be fair with a young company.

Regards

Enrico.

Well, I was sold a package under the understanding that it had
undergone several months as free ftp software and that the reported
problems were ironed out prior to the commercial release. And yes, I
was unconnected to the Internet until I had my system up and running.

How can you judge the quality of Installation Guides and System Admin
books for use by novices? In other postings you have stated (a) you
don't know what 'suitable for novices' means; (b) we can expect no
documentation, because nobody writes documentation for free; and you
have implied (c) Linux is for Hackers. In addition, we have (d) the
fact that your English is not good enough to know the difference.
German documentation, should there be any really good stuff out there,
doesn't count for the world-wide Linux community, I'm afraid.

If this is the case, how is the novice supposed to go about choosing

doesn't matter *which* one they choose? Or are they supposed to come
and ask *you*?

Hackers supporting hackers, presumably. Or is there some other,

To Chris' comment: No, a consortium (Latin: 'fellowship') can be any

that is not the word's only sense. The name can stand as far as

I always thought that was what software *developers* are supposed to
do. Have I missed something?

Also: what solutions? Recompile the kernel? Download the newest gnu
libc & libm by ftp, and install the symbolic links *correctly*? Burn
up a monitor or two before getting the configuration right? None of
these possibilities are options for novice users, which Magnus has
chosen to support first and foremost in the LC's work.

Andreas wrote:

As I said, this is what *developers* are supposed to do. Or do Linux
developers only do the GollyGeeNeatoCoolFarOutAwesome stuff, and leave
everything else that remotely resembles hard (and maybe even boring)
work to the *USERS* (like bug tracking/fixing and writing
documentation)? That's fine, of course, if that's what they want to do
(they are, after all, working for free) and somebody wants to package
and sell it. If I want to look at it and say, "That's a pile of
useless crap for the novices I support.", then I can do that, too (and
shall).

>Doing the stuff above without being so high in the Linux hierarchie !

*How* high in *what* hierarchy? I didn't know there was one. I thought
that the Linux community was pretty much flat as an organization. Am I
wrong? The Linux Consortium certainly has nothing to do with any kind
of hierarchy: it is a group of people who form an opinion and state it
publicly. What's wrong with that? You didn't happen to grow up in
*East* Germany, did you? That might explain why you continue to
mistrust a group that wants to state an opinion publicly.

I've written many, many lines of C in my day but this attitude just
makes me puke. There's only one community of computer experts -- taken
as a whole, they have to somehow support everybody interested in using
computers, not just other experts. It's like saying that the best
documentation for a car is its design file. Not the easiest way to
learn how to drive it, even if it could be done.

I can only reiterate Magnus' proposal that the Linux Consortium is not
targeted at hackers like you who read source instead of the man page.
It is targeted at novices who might be hard-put to understand even the
man pages until they've gained more experience. Is it really so
difficult for so many experts to comprehend that everybody is a
computer novice at some time in their lives? Besides, there are some
of us whose very livelihood depends on supporting novice users. Do you
think I want to be put out of commission (and the novices with me) by
some hackers who think recompiling a kernel is the next best thing to
an orgasm?

Packaged distributions that are sold for money are not free software.
If no money were ever involved, then there might be little risk for
the novice who acquires a Linux package, installs it, tosses it,
acquires a different Linux package, installs it, tosses it, acquires a
third Linux package, installs it, tosses it, and finally buys SCO.

As it is, money *is* involved in the distributions that the LC
proposes to evaluate. Next question?
