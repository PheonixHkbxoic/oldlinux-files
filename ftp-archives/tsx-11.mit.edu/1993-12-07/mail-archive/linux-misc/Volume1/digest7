I can help a little with this part.  I have DOS booting from C: in a 
primary partition occupying the whole drive.  I also have a single 
extended partition on the second drive, with just part of it used as 
drive D: by DOS.  Note: I did not define any other logical drives in the 
extended partition - not with DOS fdisk, anyway.
 
To create two Linux partitions in the extended disk partition, I ran 
Linux fdisk from the SLS a1 disk and set up /dev/hdb6 as ext2fs (hdb5 
was the DOS disk of course) and /dev/hdb7 as swap.
 
The result is that DOS can only see two disks, whereas Linux can see 
four.
 
Hope this does help a little.
 
Ps.  This was at the second attempt.  First time around, I did use DOS 
fdisk to create logical disks for linux, and then Linux fdisk to change 
their types.  I soon found that DOS progs could see drives E: and F: but 
couldn't understand what they were seeing.  A bit of a mess really, 
which is why I didn't use DOS fdisk the second time.

[ I'm starting a policy of cross-posting to c.o.l and the appropriate
  new newsgroup with the followup to the new newsgroup. It gives initial
  visibility but directs the discussion to the appropriate news group. ]

I'm enjoying Linux so much that I'm starting to think about having more
machines at home. The kiddies need one and it would be kinda nice to
have a machine downstairs where I won't seem like such a hermit to my
wife and kids ;-)

To that end I'm wondering what would be the least expensive usable
hardware configuration. This is what I'd like to be able to run:

- Linux (obviously)
- X windows
- Networking/NFS

NFS is important I think because I'd like to have my machine be a central
server and other machines be clients. 

So I throw out the challenge: What is the least expensive configuration
that'll do what I want.

Here is my first crack at it (I almost forgot the video! ;-):
$100.00 - 33 Mhz 386sx motherboard
$120.00 - 4 MB of memory - Net bought of course ;-)
$115.00 - 14 inch mono VGA monitors
$ 80.00 - 40 Meg IDE drive - remember most of the software will be NFSed.
$ 40.00 - Case and power supply - This is a cheat. A local dealer is
          getting rid of some large AT size cases with 200 W PS.
$ 35.00 - Generic VGA card - only running the monochrome server.
$ 30.00 - Ethernet Card - Buy 3 on the special offer floating on the net.
$ 25.00 - 101 key keyboard
$ 20.00 - Multi IDE card - 1 parallel - 2 serial - 2 IDE
=======
$565.00 + Tax or shipping.

What do you think? Of course for $45 more I can get a 40 Mhz 386 motherboard
with 128K cache.

Has anyone done this. With the relatively minicule cost of PC hardware and
the wonderfullness of Linux I don't see why some folks don't have a machine
in every room of their house ;-)

Later,

BAJ

  I have not used SLS, but have been a happy mcc-interim user.
The version I have has emacs 18, not 19, but some emacs gurus
seem to think this is the superior version.  mcc also has
bison, gdb, info.

Right now you can't.  We have run out of disks, and are waiting for
the 2.0/4.0 release to become official before building the Linux
distribution.  Watch for the announcement in comp.os.linux.announce.

>Is it worth (buying) ftp'ing ?

I think so, but I'm biased.  I cowrote the builder with Steve Misek.
What do other people think?

Subject: [PATCH] non-blinking software cursor for pl12 (& pl11)
Date: 13 Aug 93 23:35:37 -0400

[Please note: I'm posting this to comp.os.linux and comp.os.linux.misc
 for the sole reason that some people may not have the new newsgroups
 available to them yet. In the future, I will only post updates to this
 patch (if they become necessary) to comp.os.linux.misc (it doesn't
 seem to fit in anywhere else).]

Greetings:


Appended to this file is an updated and much improved version of my
software cursor patch for Linux 0.99 pl12 (I was going to hold off on 
releasing this until pl12 became official, but I wanted to get it out
over c.o.l before it bit the dust). This version incorporates
a fix for a really nasty bug and a few major overall improvements.

This patch should also apply cleanly to pl11 (although the hunks may
be offset slightly). Users of pl10 and earlier can also use this patch,
but you will have to edit several pieces in by hand.

Changes:
=======

- Finally eliminated the 'stray cursor left hanging around after
  screen unblanks' bug. For real this time. Honest. :)

- Completely re-did the software cursor code in set_cursor().

- Added a #define called SCURSCOLOR to set the software cursor
  color at compile time.

Features:
========

- With this patch, the standard hardware-generated 'blinking underline'
  cursor is replaced with a software-generated non-blinking block cursor.

- You can switch back and forth from software to hardware generated cursors
  at any time using a VT-200 style escape code.

- Each VC's cursor is maintained seperately: you can have half your VCs
  using the software generated cursor, half of them using the hardware
  cursor, or any combination in between.

New Features:
============

- The cursor color can be chosen at compile-time. Possible colors are white,
  yellow, magenta, red, green, cyan, blue and black. The default is white,
  which should accomodate monochrome display adapters as well as VGA or SVGA
  color ones. White seems to be a good, all-around default and I recommend
  using it, but if you have a color video adapter feel free to experiment.
  Whatever color is chosen will be retained across all VCs.

- The cursor color remains the same regardless of what foreground/background
  colors are selected. The only exception is if the cursor color and the
  background color are chosen to be the same: in that case the cursor will 
  appear black. (This is a feature, not a bug: the code in set_cursor()
  will never allow the cursor color and background color to be the same
  since that would make the cursor 'invisible', not to mention useless.)

Before anyone asks:

I am *not* planning to make the cursor color switchable at run time unless
an angry mob comes after me and demands it. It would be feasible to add
yet another escape code (or codes) to handle this, but I can't see any
real advantage to it myself. If enough people show interest in the idea,
however, I might be persuaded to give it a shot.

Configuration:
=============

There are now 3 #defines that control cursor behavior:

#define NOBLINK 1
#define HCURSTYPE 0
#define SCURSCOLOR 112

If NOBLINK is #defined, all VCs will default to software generated cursors
at boot time. If it is #undef'ed, they'll default to the usual hardware
cursors.

HCURSTYPE controls the size of the hardware cursor. 0 is a full-sized
blinking block. 13 is the standard blinking underline. 15 is off (invisible).
(Note that 'invisible' mode won't do you much good unless you're psychic. :)
I have it set to a block instead of the usual underline just because it
looks neater when switching back & forth from a blinking to non-blinking
cursor. I never liked the stupid little flashing underline anyway, which
is why I got into this mess in the first place. ;)

SCURSCOLOR sets the software cursor color. The default is white. Legal
values are:

  0     16   32    48   64  80      96     112
  black blue green cyan red magenta yellow white

Note that setting the cursor color to black will actually work, only
it will appear white on a black background since the code is smart 
enough to prevent the cursor form accidentally becoming 'invisible' due
to a bad choice of screen colors.

You can switch from software to hardware generated cursors on the fly
using a VT-200 style escape code as follows:

        <ESC>[?33h     switch to hardware cursor
        <ESC>[?33l     switch to software cursor

I have learned (thanks to nation@rocket.sanders.lockheed.com) that there
actually aren't any escape codes defined for this sort of function in the
VT-200 command set, however the codes I have selected do fit in the pattern.
This makes them non-standard but harmless so long as nothing trips them
by mistake. Note that even if you #undef'ed NOBLINK, you can still switch
a VC to software cursor mode with these escapes.

Installation:
============

This patch is a gzipped and uuencoded context diff against 
/linux/kernel/chr_drv/console.c. To apply it, extract the attached
uuencoded file to /linux/kernel/chr_drv/noblink.uu and do the
following:

# uudecode noblink.uu
# gunzip noblink.dif.gz
# patch < noblink.dif

Check for complaints from 'patch'. If it bitches about some hunks being
offset by a few lines, that's fine. If it rejects some of the patch, you'll
have to apply the rejected hunks by hand. Once you are sure the patch has 
been applied correctly, edit console.c and set the #defines as you prefer, 
then build your kernel. 

As always, questions, comments, complaints, flames, suggestions, bug reports,
bug fixes, or large sums of cash are welcome and encouraged.

Share and enjoy!

Use the mtools... Or, if you don't want to install them for just one or
two floppies ( you should...), after the fdformat ( low-level), just copy
an empty dos-formatted disk  to add the DOS file-system on it.

Absolutely no argument there.  I've never used SLS, so I can't speak
for that one, but my first Linux installation (with MCC) was mostly a
breeze.  The majority of the problems I had after installation were
either stupid mistakes on my part (e.g., UUCP setup---not part of MCC) or
problems due to the fact that I had a *VERY* old copy of the root disk,
and I ran into a lot of shared library conflicts.

Btw, does anyone know of a landline BBS that has the latest version of
the MCC root disk image?  I'd like to update some of my older binaries.
Btw, please don't suggest any BBS sites that either aren't in the US, or
don't grant first-time access to the Linux files---my long distance bills
won't support them if either of these applies.

I had even heard once that the MCC releases were no longer even being done.
It now seems that this certainly wasn't true, but the MCC release clearly
doesn't get the attention it should.

as ashamed as i am to admit it, sometimes i need to create an msdos disk
to put things on and take to other computers.

will the standard fdformat create an msdos disk? or is there a utility
mkdosfs (similar to mke2fs) that will create this?  then, i should be
able to simply mount -t msdos and write to the disk.

thanx in advance.

To some extent, "ease of use" is a valid gripe.  As someone else pointed out,
Linux has gotten to the point where non-computer types want to use it *because*
it is as capable as it is.  These people, unfortunately, don't know Unix or
their hardware the way they might need to in order to do the installation.
Furthermore, they might not be able to learn Unix (lack of resources) until
they've got Linux up and running.  Chicken and egg problem.

I'm not at all saying that this is an easy problem.  Hardware configurations
are so variable in the PC-clone world that coping with a particular
configuration is essentially a shot in the dark.

So I understand the frustration of people who have problems installing
Linux on their system.  But help is on the way.  I plan on getting into
installing Linux for a fee, providing tutorial services, etc., to anyone
in the area that's willing to pay me for it.

Having ported a number of things to System Vr4, I can tell you flat out that
porting to Linux is *easier* than porting to "the Real Thing".

I've even played with BSDI some, and found porting things to it to be
comparable to porting things to Linux.

Some people seem to be having problems even with that.  I've never played with
it myself, so I have no idea how easy it is to deal with.

Obviously if you run enough CPU-intensive things, your system will bog.  But
you should try doing all those things under System Vr4.  You might be lucky
if your system doesn't crash on you under those conditions.

Yup.  Some things will just bring any Unix box down, e.g.
"while ( 1 ) fork();", but that's not something particular to Linux.

I agree.  But how many secretaries are going to be compiling things?  Most
of them will want to run word processors and the like.

Such applications, if written properly, should be easier to use (and faster,
and more efficient, etc.) under Linux than under DOS or Windoze, if only
because Linux is a *real* operating system, not some kludge put together
by MicroSloth.

Agreed.

   Yup.  Some things will just bring any Unix box down, e.g.
   "while ( 1 ) fork();", but that's not something particular to Linux.

Yes it is -- It won't crash linux.  There are limits on how many
processes any user can have.  For instance, the .profile and .bashrc
distributed with SLS just keep calling each other.  I didn't notice
this.  When my user logged in, he got "fork(): try again".  I logged
in as root on another terminal and hardly noticed any performance
problems while I looked for his first shell and killed it, killing the
whole process group.  No, "while (1) fork();" doesn't do much damage
under Linux... :-)
