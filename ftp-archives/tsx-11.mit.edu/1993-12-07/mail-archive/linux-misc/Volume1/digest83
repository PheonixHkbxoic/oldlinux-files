>read: you still can get in via *tredir* and telnet.

OK heres how I run my term setup and I think its pretty secure..
if anyone can think of any problems Id appreciate if they could let me
know

OK- I run term (as root) in the RC file.
the TERMDIR is / so that the socket is in /.term
/.term is mode 750 (rwxr-x---) 
/.term/socket is mode 770
both /.term and /.term/socket are in a group named term.

This means only people whos group is term can succesfully use the 
term socket and access the link.

So - people who are allowed to tredir and trsh are in the term group
(ie: me since its my account on the remote machine)

The programs that I want the general user population to be able to use
(termtelnet termftp termfinger) are owned by root.term and are
set GID (not UID) - thus that binary when run can access the term
socket and work succesfully.

term programs I dont want the general user population to run
(tredir trsh) are NOT set GID, so if someone who isnt in group
term runs them, the program will not be able to access the socket.

If someone compiles their own term client, it will not work since it
is not group term and set GID (unless the become root and change the
owner and mode...) so their home grown binary will not work.

This setup seems to solve most of the problems, so if anyone can think
of problems with this setup then please mention them...

(also in /etc/profile the environment veriable TERMDIR is set to /
 so that peoples term clients know where to find the socket)


   comments/etc appreciated...

                        Simon.

Not surprising.  POV does much floating point work, so you can
effectively eliminate the 486's integer/instruction pipeline from speed
considerations.  9h23m is 563 minutes, 11h10m is 670 minutes.  670 *
(33 / 40) = 552, so the difference in times you observe here is the
result of the clock speeds.  I've been told that the FPU in the 486DX2
runs at 66MHz, so I you are willing to plunk down the extra cash
(again, I've been told it's not that much) you should (theoretically)
be able to cut rendering time to 5h35m.

   Exactly what alternatives?  We're talking about Joe Average Small
Businessman who wants software to run on his computer without having to learn
a lot.  He does not want, nor can he afford, NextStep, Unix, or anything
of the same ilk.  MS-DOS is just about *perfect* for those needs.  And Windows
adds to the value of the system he is getting without adding appreciably to
what he has to learn.  Remember that people on the net tend to look at
computers as interesting unto themselves - the vast majority of computers users,
however, look at them as necessary evils.

  Technical excellence in software or hardware has *never* been a reason for
the consumer to go with a particular product.  People buy Microsoft products
because they are relatively cheap, easy to use, and available.  Not to
mention that the knowledge base of talent to use the system is *huge* - you can
do what my first employer did - hire a dirt-cheap high school kid to come in
and do your programming.  :-)

   You seem to be trying to justify your arguments on the grounds that they're
what the world should be.  The problem is, people are perverse - they do
many, many things that are self defeating, destructive, and generally
stupid.  You can make a very easy choice - stick with the elegant systems
and starve, or do what it takes to put bread on your table.

   People should avoid Microsoft because it will cause *you* hardship?  Isn't
that a little egotistical? :-)  Fine - if people avoid Microsoft, it will
cause tens of thousands of programmers and support personnel hardship,
therefore we should all purchase *only* Microsoft products, right?  Life is
generally composed of doing your best while dealing with other people's
stupidness - this may come as a surprise to you, but it's true.  And quite
frankly, only *you* can make yourself a victim.  If you can't deal with
the rules of the game, get out of it and find an easier one, because very few
other people are going to care.

   Just keep saying to yourself "Cheap... easy... supported."  Technical
reasons are irrelevent to the average person.  Once you learn that, you'll
be fine. :-)

I'm almost embarassed to admit it now, since most people have probably
forgotten by now, but I once seriously mis-interpreted the intent of the
daily posting, just as keating appears to have done.  Of course, I had a
bit of an excuse---I'd heard tales of people being flamed for asking
questions that were anything short of brilliant, etc. (all of which I've
learned were complete and total BS), and this was before the daily posting
was re-worded a bit (it still said ``to avoid being flamed'', which, when
combined with the tales I'd heard...well, you get the idea), but still....

Having chatted with Ian several times via e-mail, I have absolutely no
hesitation in stating that he is definitely *NOT* ``an intolerant ass''.
Quite the opposite, in fact.  He counts as one of the more helpful folks
around here.

Now, with the current wording of the daily posting, frankly, I don't see
how anyone could mis-read it as being intended to be anything but helpful.
But that's another story....

Well, they have an 800 number.  I've called it twice asking for

I have connected to a very nice answering service person.
No return calls, no postcards or literature as requested.

I figure the owner has a full time job and this LSL is his

The best thing I have found for graphics in TeX/LaTeX is to use 'xfig'
(which produces postscript) and then use a \special to import the
postscript. On Linux this works a treat, you can view the whole result with
ghostview (and jump from page to page in any order) and print it on any 
printer with ghostscript.

LaTeX/xfig output in postscript through ghostscript looks perfect which is 
more than you can say for anything which uses the original postscript fonts
if you don't have a real postscript printer.

Fair enough.  But why isn't X11R5 on Linux?  Hmmmm?

I don't know how you reach *your* conclusion.  He was refering to X11R5 when
he said "I hear it is freely available", you silly boy.  Where does he state
that X11R5 runs on Linux or XFree86 costs money?  I think it's fairly
obvious he was asking a question about X11R5 running on Linux.
