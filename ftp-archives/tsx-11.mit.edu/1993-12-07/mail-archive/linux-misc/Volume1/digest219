  as always, you MUST do any explicit library
linking at the END of the command line.  e.g.:

gcc -o sample sample.c -lcurses -ltermcap


(curses uses some things from the termcap library
also, and needs them linked in)

Hear hear!  I second that motion.  By creating html friendly document
source you dramaticly increase your range of distribution.  There are
several authoring solutions, the most obvious being LaTeX.  There
is info on the LaTeX -> HTML package available, I've just forgotten the
URL at the moment. Others should be coming...hopefully a good HTML editor
proper.

Date: Sun, 17 Oct 1993 06:14:19 GMT

               Low-Cost SLS Version of Linux on Diskette

Linux is a freely redistributable version of the Unix(tm) Operating System
which runs on 80386 and 80486 PC Compatible machines. This software is
a full version of Unix which contains all the standard utilities and more,
including:

        TCP/IP, SLIP Networking
        C and C++ Compilers and other development tools
        Various Language Translators

For your convenience, we now have 24 hour, toll-free ordering 
and can accept both American Express and Optima. Many of our 
customers have requested technical support and we are pleased 
to announce that thirty days of software support via phone and 
email is now included with each order.

The version we distribute is SLS 1.03 which contains the Linux Kernel
version .99 patch level 12. Disk 'A1' is the bootable diskette which

The ``vi''s I know of are elvis (the one in SLS/MCC/etc.), vile (never used

Emacs 19 has a Wordstar mode (although I haven't looked at it).

If it's wordstar keybindings you're after, you might like to look at one of :

JOE (world.std.com:src/editors/joe1.0.8.tar.Z)  (a big improvement on the
    0.1.5 included in SLS/MCC/etc)
    
JED (amy.tch.harvard.edu:pub/jed) (very nice - even has its own
    macro/scripting language)
    
You're better off asking on comp.editors about this...

Enjoy,
 Andrew.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

Putting in my $0.02 worth: I've been using/installing/recommending SLS
since practically day one, with minor problems solved by fetching original

Subject: New experimental Yggdrasil LGX boot floppy
Date: Sun, 17 Oct 1993 10:08:33 GMT

        There is an image of a new experimental LGX boot floppy
in netcom.com:~ftp/pub/yggdrasil/boot-floppies/bootflpy.3in.revA.
This boot floppy should solve the problems that people have been having
with their systems hanging after SCSI detection.  The problems with
systems hanging apparently had two separate causes:

                1. The PC speaker sound driver does not get a long
                   with some motherboards.  The new boot floppy has the
                   PC speaker sound driver turned off.
                2. Because of a last minute screw-up, the Ultrastor
                   driver was not using the IO port reservation system
                   that the rest of the kernel was using.  This problem
                   has been fixed.

        If you have an Ultrastor SCSI controller, you will want to replace
the version of the kenrel that is installed on your hard disk after you
have done the installation.  After you have done the installation, boot
the hard disk using the boot floppy (for example, type "linux_hda1" to
the "boot: " prompt if your newly installed root partition is on /dev/hda1),
then, once the system has booted, log in as root and do the following:
        
                mount /dev/fd0 /mnt
                cp /mnt/vmlinux /vmlinux
                lilo -C /etc/lilo/config

        If you do not have an Ultrastor controller, you can do the above
procedure, or you can simply comment out the "splay" command in the
/etc/rc.file that the install script installs on your hard disk.

        Note that this is an image of a low density floppy rather than
a high density one, so be sure to RAWRITE this image to a low density
floppy.

        If these changes appear to work, I will post an announcement
to comp.os.linux and I will make the kernel source diffs and images of
the boot disk for other floppy disk formats available.  Please try this
new floppy image as soon as possible.

I think that I might be qualified to answer this question, given some
recent activities of mine.  I don't think there are any other binary
only distributions on Linux, except for the Motif folks.

No, it does not.  The GLPL is a specailized version of the GPL
designed to allow commercial developers to distribute code linked
against gnu libraries, subject to certain terms and conditions.  The
biggest one being that the end user must be allowed to relink the
binaries with their own .o's/libraries.  The shared mechanism on Linux
is sufficent, IMHO, to cover this requirement.

Actually, I did not make a typo.  The '.' is not explicitly stated; it

Subject: Re: SLS, MCC, TAMU, and GCC (Re: Don't use SLS)
Date: 17 Oct 1993 15:06:47 GMT


I just helped a friend to install her first Linux on a 486/66 with SMC ethernet
card, IDE HD, and S3 805 video chipset.  We used the latest SLS.  After
installing the base (a,b,c), X (x1-x10), and XS3, X worked out fine.  But,
C++ compiler and network didn't work at all!  We have to grab gcc-2.4.5 and
net-2 to get the thing running.  My point:  SLS is not as reliable as it used
to be, especially for the first-time installation on a fresh harddisk.

Another story:  this is on my home PC, which has a UltraStor 34F and SCSI HD.
I accidentally deleted /etc/utmp file, following instructions in bootutils-0.1!
All of a sudden, I can't login after reboot.  To fix the problem:

        1) Grabed SLS a1.3:  Can't recognize my SCSI controller at all;
        2) Grabed Image.UltraStor:  can't mount my scsi HD because of "bad
                superblocks;"
        3) Grabed TAMU bootdisk:  can't mount my HD with a wierd error number
                (4620?), maybe because of the fs is ext2 type;
        4) Grabed MCC bootdisk:  ABLE to mount my HD and modify /etc/rc file;
        5) Tried GCC bootdisk:  ABLE to mount my HD and modify /etc/rc file,
                in addition, it has a beautiful colored display when doing ls!
I had three trips to school on that rainy night to finally fixed the problem.

My point: for first-timers, SLS serves its purpose well (if properly delivered)
but for emergency occasions, less-common hardware setup (e.g., SCSI), and
seasoned users,  other distributions, MCC and GCC are the real choice.  I liked
GCC's bootdisk in particular, since it packed lots of goodies in a single
floppy, which makes me feel at home, in addition to the nice colored display:-)
