Hi!

I am woundering if there exists a Simula compiler for Linux
out there..?
Well - I guess it will be somthing like Simula2C ...

Any pointers...?

Some guys at the institute has made a program called cim. This is
exactly what you're looking for. Since the authours don't want the
sources to be floating around everywhere, there's only a binary
version out for linux. I think it's on tsx-11 or sunsite. If you
can't find it, mail janl@ifi.uio.no as he maintains the linux
binary package.

Depends on your line. Every char to escape affects throughput, as does
(obviously) sevenbit. Term compression should be turned off with fast
v.42bis modems (the modems compress faster than the CPU), timeout
should be fairly low and window size big for high speed lines. And for
this speed you definitely need a FIFO serial interface, lost
interrupts are a royal pain with term (causing long waiting periods).

        Why shouldn't it be a link? The kernel headers come with the

/usr/include/linux, first thing I did was rm them and make the links

That's the board I have.  An Ocean Hippo VL+ 486-SX-33 (actually, it's an
SX-25 over-clocked to 33MHz).  They must have changed the manual to get rid
of the guff about why the benchmarks should be ignored...

my manual doesn't seem to mention anything about "optimised for 16 bit
software"...although it does mention that OS/2 (and other programs which
switch back and forth between real & protected mode) will run quickly on
it because fast 8042 emulation is built into the chipset (not the BIOS as
on some other motherboards).



My manual has one page on DCA:

        DCA (Dynamic Cache Architecture) is a new Cache Memory.  DCA
        literally boosts the cache memory efficiency by as much as
        300 percent over conventional external cache!  It is integrated
        as part of the high speed logic of the motherboard.

        A 486 system, until now, moves information in the same manner
        because the software written to take full advantage of the 486's
        32 bit wide BUS has usually been restricted to CAD/CAM, Expert
        Systems, Virtual Simulations, and other High End applications.
        DCA, and it's Byte Gathering Write Buffers collect 8 and 16 bit
        "packets" of information until a single 32 bit "packet" is
        formed.  Using Burst Mode, it then "Writes" this single 
        informational "string" back to RAM in one operation, rather than
        in several time consuming ones.  This is a tremendous improvement
        on the efficiency of data transfer, as the information is handled
        solely through te CPU, the High Speed Chipset, and the lightning
        fast Internal Cache of the 80486.

typed verbatim from the manual - blame the grammar and the Very Weird
Capitalisation on the [taiwanese??] english dialect :-)



btw, I am very happy with this new motherboard.  it seems plenty fast 
enough to me - certainly a LOT faster than my old 386-dx-40 with no
cache.  Of course, I don't have another 486-sx-33 with normal cache to
compare it to...

For those two, wait until WINE gets off the ground (which will,

Seriously, though, there are a couple of spreadsheets out there, such
sc and oleo.  They don't have the polish of Excel, though.

As far as the word processing goes...  there is a word processor called

We're a bit off-topic here, but there is a whole lot of tuning you can do to
get Ultrix to perform as well as or better than SunOS, FWIW.  It's been a
while since I've done any of the tuning, but there were some neat
optimizations put in by Eric Schott's group that do a good job.  Contact
your nearest DEC UNIXoid to get a copy of his tuning paper.  Of course,
Ultrix is dead, but as long as systems run it, it will continue to lead
an unnatural pseduo life, like a putrefying zombie that never quite wants
to finish dying...

Anyway, you might as well get as much as you can out of it as long as you're
running it.
