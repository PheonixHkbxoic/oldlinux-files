                 Welcome to the comp.os.linux.* hierarchy!

Background
=========================================================================
        This posting is an introduction to the comp.os.linux.* hierarchy 
        of USENET newsgroups. 

        Linux is a free implementation of UNIX for 80386/80486 machines 
        covered by the GNU GPL. Most of the development of the Linux 
        kernel has been done by Linus Torvalds, an internationally 
        reknowned UNIX wizard from Helsinki, Finland.

        For the past two years or so, the newsgroup comp.os.linux has 
        grown be one of the most popular groups on USENET. Late in 1992, 
        a CFV for splitting comp.os.linux was posted; the only group which 
        passed was comp.os.linux.announce, a moderated newsgroup for Linux 
        announcements and patches.

        Six months later, during the summer of 1993, another CFV for 
        splitting comp.os.linux was posted. The voting period for the 
        comp.os.linux reorganization results ended at 23:59:59 UTC on 
        4 August 1993 (4:59PM US Pacific Time, 7:59PM US Eastern Time.) 
        The results are as follows:

        comp.os.linux reorganization results - 1842 votes

         Yes   No  : 2/3? >100? : Pass? : Group
         ---- ---- : ---- ----- : ----- : -------------------------------
         1692  135 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.admin
         1741   90 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.development
         1647  177 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.help
         1660  155 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.misc


        Because of this split, the newsgroup comp.os.linux will be 
        deleted on 11 November 1993. The new newsgroups will be created 
        on 11 August 1993. This posting describes these newsgroups, 
        including comp.os.linux.announce, which will remain entact.


General Policy
=========================================================================
        The general policy for the Linux newsgroups is simple. Who sets
        the policy? We all do. All of us on USENET are interested in
        communicating openly about a number of topics. That's why we
        have USENET. If you want the Linux newsgroups to work for you,
        a few suggestions:

        * Read the Linux FAQ and follow the newsgroups for some time 
          before posting questions. This is very important. comp.os.linux 
          suffered from HUGE amounts of noise and traffic because much 
          of the growing readership never bothered to READ the newsgroup;
          they only posted questions.
          
          The same thing will happen with the new newsgroups unless you 
          read the FAQ (found on sunsite.unc.edu in the file 
          pub/Linux/docs/FAQ) and read the newsgroup for some time before 
          posting questions. Chances are, your question has already been
          recently answered, and a simple browsing of the newsgroup
          will answer it. We suggest using a threaded newsreader such as
          "trn" which will allow you to browse and mark articles by 
          subject, so you don't have to read each and every article in
          each newsgroup.

        * Crossposting between the Linux newsgroups is STRONGLY 
          discouraged. If you do crosspost questions between Linux 
          newsgroups, expect to be flamed to oblivion. The reason we
          have a newsgroup split is to categorize discussions into 
          separate newsgroups. Crossposting negates this effect. 
          If your posting cannot fit into ONE of the newsgroups
          c.o.l.admin, c.o.l.help, or c.o.l.development, then you 
          should post it to c.o.l.misc. 

          The one exception is for announcements. Occasionally, an
          important announcement (such as this one) will be crossposted
          between c.o.l.announce and one or more of the other c.o.l.*
          groups. These announcements must be approved by the .announce
          moderator; see below.

        * Reply to questions via e-mail if at all possible. While 
          discussion in the newsgroups is encouraged, if someone is
          asking a simple question to which the answer is well-known,
          there is no reason to post the reply. Don't assume that 
          the person posting the question actually reads the newsgroup
          or will even note your followup if they do. Reply via e-mail
          unless the reply is of general interest. 

        * Don't flame newbies. Over the course of the past few months,
          the Linux community has developed an oversensitive ego and
          a reputation for being unfriendly towards newcomers, mostly
          because of unwarranted flaming by a handful of righteous 
          individuals. If someone posts, saying, "Hi! I'm new to
          this group! What is Linux?" (which will inevitably happen
          as the new newsgroups are propagated), DO NOT FLAME THEM.
          When someone sees a new newsgroup pop up within "rn", they
          are justifiably curious about the new group and probably
          don't know that well over 80,000 people who know EVERYTHING
          about Linux read the group. Right? 

          Instead of being rude, you can send a polite note to the
          poster, saying, "Hello, Linux is a free implementation of
          UNIX for the 386 and 486. You can get the FAQ from 
          sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/docs. Let me know if I can
          be of help!". That's all. Not difficult, eh? You can even
          save your stock reply in a file and simply send form-letters
          to newbies if you wish. But there is very little point in
          flaming or ever being rude. It goes against everything that
          Linux can and should be. 

          Just remember that nobody knows everything---not even Linus---
          and that you were a newbie once, too. :)


comp.os.linux.announce
=========================================================================
        Comp.os.linux.announce is a moderated newsgroup for Linux 
        announcements and source patches. The purpose of this group was
        to get all of the ``important'' Linux information out of the
        regular newsgroup and into a place where all Linux users could see
        the important announcements without having to wade through a 
        jungle of other postings. So far, this group has been very 
        successful. 

        The moderators for this group are myself (Matt Welsh, 
        mdw@tc.cornell.edu) and Lars Wirzenius (wirzeniu@cc.helsinki.fi). 
        We will be sharing the moderator duty, and backing each other up 
        to make sure that postings to this group will be approved as soon 
        as possible after they're submitted.

        Submissions to this group should be mailed to the address:
                linux-announce@tc.cornell.edu

        If you have any problems or questions about c.o.l.announce, please 
        send mail to the moderators at
                linux-announce-request@tc.cornell.edu
        Or simply mail us directly. This is not a request address for 
        mailing list subscription; see below.

        A separate posting details the guidelines for submitting to this 
        group.  I plan to approve just about anything that's posted to this 
        group, except for questions or discussions about Linux. So, please, 
        post away.  :)

        There are also archives of comp.os.linux.announce available at a 
        number of Linux FTP sites: check 
                sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/linux-announce.archive

        There is a mailing list mirror of the comp.os.linux.announce 
        newsgroup; to join, send mail to
                linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi
        With the line
                X-Mn-Admin: join ANNOUNCE
        at the top of the body (not in the subject). Approved postings to 
        c.o.l.announce will automatically be mailed to this mailing list 
        channel.


comp.os.linux.admin     
=========================================================================
        This newsgroup was created simply to thwart the unique newsgroup
        acronym "c.o.l.a", previously used by c.o.l.announce. However,
        this newsgroup is also used for discussions and questions about
        running Linux systems, either in a single-user or multi-user
        environment.

        Clearly, there is no large distinction between c.o.l.admin and
        c.o.l.help. However, .admin should be mostly used for discussions
        about RUNNING Linux, not USING or PROGRAMMING it. Unfortunately,
        especially with Linux, the line between system administrator and
        system user is very fuzzy. In short, we anticipate c.o.l.admin
        to be mostly about questions with installing, setting up, and
        configuring Linux systems, as well as other discussions relating
        to system administration. 


comp.os.linux.development
=========================================================================
        c.o.l.development, or "c.o.l.d" for short, is a newsgroup for 
        questions and discussions about Linux kernel and systems-level 
        development. Please note that this is a newsgroup about 
        development OF Linux, not development FOR Linux. In other words, 
        c.o.l.d isn't for questions about programming or porting software 
        to Linux. Instead, this is a newsgroup for discussions about 
        developing the Linux kernel itself, including writing device 
        drivers, adding new features, and so on. In addition, discussions
        about development of shared libraries, and other essential 
        systems-level projects, are welcome here. 

        Hopefully, this newsgroup will embody some of the content and
        scope of the linux-activists mailing list channels such as GCC, 
        KERNEL, SCSI, and NET.


comp.os.linux.help
=========================================================================
        Comp.os.linux.help is perhaps the most general of Linux 
        newsgroups. It is for any general user, programming, or 
        setup questions and discussion about Linux. If your question
        is about Linux development, post to c.o.l.development. If
        it is about system administration, post to c.o.l.admin. 
        However, if your question is of a more general nature, such
        as "How do I set up Linux for use with an NE2000 card?",
        c.o.l.help is your place. 

        Remember that you should not crosspost between .help and
        other Linux newsgroups. This means that if you are asking for
        help in .development, that's fine, but .help is for those
        questions which don't fit into .admin and .development.


comp.os.linux.misc
=========================================================================
        This group is the canonical ``catch-all'' for discussions and 
        questions which don't fit into the other Linux newsgroups.
        While c.o.l.help is generally for questions, c.o.l.misc is for
        discussions of a general nature about Linux, such as setting up
        a file hierarchy standard, questions about Linus' personal life
        and virtual beer, and the inevitable flame war. Again, it should 
        be noted that crossposting between c.o.l.misc and other Linux 
        newsgroups is strongly discouraged. If your posting or question 
        does not fit into ONLY ONE of the other Linux newsgroups, post 
        it to .misc.


Comments
=========================================================================
        If you have questions or comments about this document, please
        direct them to mdw@tc.cornell.edu. Flames to /dev/null; cheques
        and money orders to Linus Torvalds. Thanks.

Definitely.  I originally started by ripping cnews out of SLS, and trying
that...it worked ok, but I had to hack shell scripts all over the place to work...

INN on the other hand works great and isn;t as cluttered as CNews wrt.
having a massive /usr/lib/news tree...I haven;'t tried the new (non)patches
yet, I'm still using Arjan's original update of dpg's patches...

I found that zsh runs it just fine (ie. it finishes running :) - mind you,
this is with 2.4beta patchlevel 180...I assume 2.3.1 would work ok too.

Another zsh convert :),

[everything deleted but the gist ;-]

>** MCC is a wonderful installation package. **

Indeed.  I started my Linux life with the old MCC 0.97pl1 distribution
around this time last year (towards the end of August, anyway), and have
recently reinstalled with the 0.99p10+ release.

My main reason for choosing MCC this time was the size - i didn't need all
the excess baggage that comes with SLS, as I can build things myself as I
need them.

One other really really really Good Thing (tm) about MCC is that everything
has been rebuilt with gcc 2.4.5 and libc 4.4.1 (as comes with the distribution).

Since I rebuilt everything else, like news and mail, that I needed,
 I now have a system with all (except one or two) binaries compiled with gcc
2.4.5 and libc 4.4.1.  If SLS had been rebuilt like this it'd be a killer
(it'd also be a hell of a lot of work, but worth it in the long run...)

I think in the long run, both distributions have their place.

SLS is, as the name implies, for people new to Linux - it has everything
there, you don't have to go off ftp'ing to get it.  (which is a Good Thing
if the user doesn't have ftp access).   MCC excels in being a good starting
point for those who know more about Linux/Unix and are able to get hold of
the relevant source/binary distributions to bring their systems up to full
power. 

Enjoy,
 Cos.

The next release of tin will be able to make use of the way INN was

The latest version of the linux Kernel can always be found at
nic.funet.fi in the directory /pub/OS/Linux/People/Linus 

The latest version right now is 0.99 patchlevel 12 ALPHA

I have to agree with Keith.  Even when set up properly, Merge and such can't
support many users.  Native Unix software is the way to go there.  Although,
if some of it is MS-"windows" software, WABI should support better multi-usering
because of sleeping and such (if/when it comes out).

Subject: Recomendations for partitions - 2hda's/4gig!
Date: Fri, 13 Aug 1993 13:12:38 GMT

I have 2 hard drives, both 2Gig (SCSI).  I have an HP Vectra 486s/20,
w/32Meg. RAM.  I want to use OS/2's boot manager.  I would like to 
have at least the following partitions;

DOS - 200Meg (bootable)
OS/2 - 500Meg HPFS (bootable)
Linux - 500Meg (bootable)
Linux - 300Meg (/users, mount?)
DOS - 500Meg FAT

I know that I need to have a 1 Meg. partition for the boot manager.   
Some of my other concerns are;

1. I want to be able to access all (except the  /users) of the 
non-bootable partitions from any OS.  Thats the purpose of using FAT's.

2. I don't want DOS to even be able to see the other bootable partitions.
Am I correct that it can't if they all reside as primary partitions?

3. If it is possible to mount an OS/2 HPFS partion with Linux I would
prefer at least one 1Gig. partition.


I have in mind something like below but I'm not sure I can even do this.
Can DOS access partitions above 1Gig?

Drive 1,

         --------------------------------------- 
        | OS/2 (boot) |  500Meg HPFS  | Primary |
        |---------------------------------------|
        | DOS (boot)  |  200Meg FAT   | Primary |
        |---------------------------------------|
        | DOS (data)  |  500Meg FAT   | Logical | 
        |---------------------------------------|
        | DOS (data)  |  500Meg FAT   | Logical |
        |---------------------------------------|
        | Linux /users|  Whats left   | Logical |
        |---------------------------------------|
        | Boot Manager|  1 Meg (Req.) | Primary |
         --------------------------------------- 

Drive 2,

         --------------------------------------- 
        | DOS (data)  |  500Meg FAT   | Primary | 
        |---------------------------------------|
        | DOS (data)  |  500Meg FAT   | Primary | 
        |---------------------------------------|
        | DOS (data)  |  500Meg FAT   | Logical |
        |---------------------------------------|
        | Linux (boot)|  500Meg       | Primary | 
         --------------------------------------- 

Please e-mail me some suggestions.

Thanks

Can't you format a disk in dosemu? (I haven't played with it yet)

(so maybe it's not worth $0.02)

hmm, based on the poster from ithaca ny (sorry, i am in amherst MA)
I have an interesting idea:

we currently have a software map, hows about a users map?
organize it by geographic area, then you can find interested
people nearby.

just my $0.04 (damn inflation)

The way I use zmodem with Kermit (Kermit 184... I know it's old, I'll fix it
one of these days!) is to set the environment variable RZSZLINE as suggested
in the docs I got with zmodem.  If my environment has the line
"RZSZLINE=/dev/ttys2" in it then all I have to do is start sz (or rz) on the
remote system, then escape back to kermit and enter "!rz" to receive, or "!sz
filename" to send.  I don't know how old my version of zmodem is, but it
should still utilize environment checking, shouldn't it?  My sz version number
is 3.18, running Linux 0.98pl4.

Hope this helps,

Hi there !

I just read about an ObjectBuilder from ParcPlace in the recent
version of the german iX-Magazin.

They wrote that PP has distributed some examples for Linux on the
Xhibition.

Has anybody more information about this thing? 
Where can I find my own example of this thing?

Is it worth (buying) ftp'ing ?

Thanks in advance !!!

What about memory usage? I've taken a look at INN and came to the
conclusion that while INN is somewhat nicer than C News, it's not
worth it for my single user site, the main concern being the always
running daemon that eats up more and more memory as time goes... and
restarting it regularly seems non-beautiful to me.

What is the problem exactly with bash?

I feel like I'm living in a cave. Could someone post a writeup or doc file
on INN? I'm not familiar with it and need to be convinced that it's worth
the headache of "deinstalling" C-News to replace it (Can't go to the O'Reilly
uucp book to solve INN problems ;-).

Does it have a GUI newsreader? NNTP? What minimum linux release does it
require?

Subject: SLS 1.03 Tcl/Tk configuration [fixes]
Date: Fri, 13 Aug 1993 14:48:13 GMT

The standard demos that are provided with Tcl/Tk will not
run out of the box.  

The following demos in /usr/local/tcl/demos are affected:

browse color dialog hello ixset rmt rolodex size tcolor timer widget

Fix by doing the following things:

1. Change 1st line of each file to read #!/usr/local/bin/wishx
2. Change the permissions for each file by doing 'chmod 755 filename'

After doing all of the above each demo would start Ok but not react 
at all to any mouse clicks.  Any help would be appreciated.

innd does not eat up more and more memory.  It reaches a steady-state fairly
quickly.  If you set INND_DBZINCORE to 0 then it doesn't use much memory
at all.

If you have a buggy C library (Ultrix malloc; most sVr4 socket libraries)
then you will see memory leaks.  You cannot blame innd for those.

Not a bad idea at all.  This would have the added benefit of giving us an idea of
the actual number of Linux users out there.  This is something to use when trying
to get software companies to make linux ports of their products.
