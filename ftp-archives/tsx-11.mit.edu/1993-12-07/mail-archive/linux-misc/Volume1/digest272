Hi!

I am currenty running Xfree 2.0 S3-server, on a Actix GraphicsENGINE 32 plus
with 1 MB dram (801 at-bus card). 
I was just wondering if anyone has a clue to how much performanse gain
it will be to updrade to 2 MB...?

Ofcause the resolution is importante; I'm running 1024x768x256 in about
80Hz NI mode. I plan to keen this resolution even if I upgrade.

Anyone have some benchmarks on 1MB vs 2MB in 1024x768 mode ?

My card is good for 57000 Xstones on my 486-33DX, 16MB.
( This test was done on the X386 1.2 S3-server ).

comments, thoughts ???

-Kristian.

I know Hurd isn't just a name. It's good to be innovative but you don't
have to bring all the innovations at once. You can start from a
single-server and divide the functionnality between several servers later.
In the process you can also add new functionnality. You wouldn't have
started from scratch if you had ported Linux or some other free OS to Mach
and started from there instead of what you did.

OK then I was wrong, the picture is: bsdss is unstable and the other BSD

Like I said in an other message (posted in an other thread), whether we
like it or not there will be a contest between Hurd and Linux when Hurd
will come out. I know the FSF don't seek self-aggrandizement, but it
nevertheless has some influence over free software development.

1) Up to date software. Expect XF86 2.0 very soon for example.
2) A developer who responds both to E-mail and News posts and actually
   makes changes when reported.

I have the sales brochure for the Ocean Hippo(?) motherboard that uses
the DCA architecture.  It has been a couple of weeks since I read it,
but it explicitely states that it is optimized for "16 bit software that
is running today - like DOS/Windoze 3.1" or some such thing.  It then proceeds
to spend 2 or 3 pages describing why every single publically available 
benchmarking program will demonstrate inferior results to other caching 
strategies yet it is still performs better on real world applications.
Sure, whatever.

Needless to say, I did not give it another thought.

I have 2MB but only running at 61.5Hz. 
At 80Hz? Would you send me you Xconfig please? So that I can try
it out and let you know.

Also anyone notice that there are 'lines' on the screen with you move
the windows? The problem only occurs when I use 1280x1024 mode.

"1280x1024"   110     1280 1320 1480 1728     1024 1029 1036 1077
"1280x1024b"  110     1280 1328 1512 1712   1024 1025 1028 1054

Am I doing something wrong?
If these setting are incorrect, would someone post or email me
the correct ones. 

Thanks.

From my experience, Xfree 2.0 is speedier than 1.3, even with
non-accelerated cards. My Trident 8900C seems faster ...

Moreover, many bugs have been fixed, so why not upgrade ?

Hi all.

Well, I just upgraded from XFree86-1.2 to 2.0
I ran xbench just prior to upgrade and just following
upgrade.

System: Linux on 386/40 w/ 387 64k cache 16mbyte 60ns ram
        Orchid Prodesigner IIs w/1024k on ISA bus at 10MHz
        (That's an ET4000)

Xconfig: 256color - screensize 1024x768 (virtual same size)
         speedups all

Load: init, /etc/update, getty on tty1 (1 v. console, none logged in),
xinit, X, 1 xterm (no wm)

screensaver off : xset s off

xbench compiled with gcc-2.4.5 and libc-4.4.4

The exact same setup for both runs, using the default script
included in xbench:

XFree86-1.2: 11434 xstones
XFree86-2.0: 11404 xstones

I think the drop in performance is incidental.  I ran the test
twice on each version.  Virtually the same numbers.

Faster than a sun 3/50 at least :-)

However, I must say that 2.0 seems more responsive under normal
X usage, which goes to show how little benchmarks tell you.

I was wondering what an ET4000 on VLB does for xstones?  
Also I wonder if my results are bus or processor limited.
I'd be really interested in hearing what various configurations
of processor/bus/ET4000/ET4000-32 do.  If someone is interested
in trying this out, I can gather a list of results.  I am only
interested in ET4000 related results!  Since these are dumb
framebuffers, and reasonably common in lots of flavors.

Please use the exact system load and xbench script I used.
(I realize some may object to this as the basic measure of 
performance, but hey - it's there, and we have to have some
standard)

Thanks
Johan

Date: Thu, 4 Nov 1993 14:02:20 GMT

I am thinking of getting a SL/IP connection and would REALLY appreciate
the input from any Slackware 1.0.5 users out there on...

  1) Does SL/IP as included with Slackware 1.0.5 WORK (once configured)?

  2) Is there a USENET reader included with Slackware that works over
     SL/IP and supports NNTP?

  3) Does mail (SMTP) run over SL/IP?

  4) My SL/IP connection will be limited to 2 hours/day ($35).  Is it
     reasonable to expect to be able to download about 30 SMTP e-mail
     messages and about 15 newsgroups a day in 2 hours/day???  I am
     especially concerned about how quickly the SL/IP server will
     recognize my system and start downloading after I connect.  If it
     takes an hour to notice my system is there, and I only have 2 hours...

It sure would be nice to get my Linux system on the net, free of the shackles
of my employer! 

Any comments, anytime, anywhere VERY MUCH appreciated!!!

It is the Headland chipset. And it is no surprise that motherboards with
this chipset perform better than most other chipsets/motherboards. Under
DOS a 256k Cache may do a good job in hiding a crappy memory
architecture, as 256k is a substantial portion of the 640k address
space. If you use linux the result is quite different. Cheapy-yucky
motherboards like to omit the dirty-tag RAM ($5). This causes a cache
line to be always written back to (very slow) main memory before it is
loaded. Some motherboards do not even have the dirty-tag RAM socket
($.10). Sure, 256k Cache looks very good in the advertisements.

Subject: Collecting FP benchmark info.

I'm interested in collecting FP benchmark info on systems running
Linux.  I'm attaching to the end of this posting a UUencoded version
of the "C" version of the linpack benchmark.  I ran this on my home
system and my system at work with the following results.

CPU             FPU             kflops/sec
==========================================
AMD386DX40      none            12
INTEL486DX50    internal        2090

I'm thinking of upgrading my home system (386DX40) to a Cyrix 486DLC40
with the Cyrix 3D87 FPU, and I wonder how fast it will be.  Given the
very poor performance of my current system, I think I will at least
get the 3D87 FPU.

So mail me your speeds and/or experience with FP intensive
applications, and I will summarize.  I compiled the benchmark with the
following command:

# gcc -O6 -DDP -DUNROLL -o linpack linpack.c -lm

Please use the same command when preparing your executable.
