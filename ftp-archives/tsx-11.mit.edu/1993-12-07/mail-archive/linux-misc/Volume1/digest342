fstab is not a command but a file containing information which filesystem are
to be mounted during boot. So it is okay to give you an error message when you
try to run it.

No there are no commands that belong into /proc. BUT: /proc should have the
(pseudo-) filesystem of type "proc" mounted because many programs in /etc (and
others ?) _depend_ on the proc-filesystem, i.e they want to gather information
from there.

So what should you do ?

add the following line into your /etc/fstab:

none    /proc   proc

and make sure you have the command "mount -a" somewhere in your /etc/rc file.

Why is it every time someone ask for a word processor the response is
"It looks to me you should try TeX"?

I use LaTeX. It's not a word processor. It's not WYSIWYG. It's not going
to do the job that Tim wants.

Just because TeX is the only piece of software available to do the job
doesn't mean that we should be satisfied with it.

Fortunately there is a Linux WP project afoot. It has gone underground because
every time someone asks about it the TeXWar (sorry Bill Shatner) begins.

It's just like the vi editor argument:

" Well, it's kinda cryptic and hard to use, but it's all we have and it works
  on most Unix boxes..."

Both Emacs and joe solve the problem by providing a better solution to the
problem at hand instead of just saying "it's all we got. Live with it."

So my answer is:

Tim, there isn't a word processor that will do what you want to do right now.
There is currently a project going on to develop such a product. Also Island
Write has proposed moving their DOS/Windows Software to Linux. But in the
meantime there are few avenues you may wish to explore.

1) Use TeX/LaTeX directly. It isn't the best tool but it's equation and math
   package will probably go a long way towards helping you.
2) Doc which comes with the X package InterViews is a near WYSIWYG frontend
   to TeX. However in the few times I've used it I've found it to be slow
   can cumbersome. Also the documentation says no equations.
3) If any dos pacakges solve your problem then run them under DOSEMU.

Hope this helps,

Remember: TeX is not the answer to all document generation.

        I am buying a new motherboard for my personal computer. I was wondering
which CPU I need to purchase or does it may a difference. I intend to run Linux
with DOS/Windows. I have been comparing the prices and there is about a $200

Subject: Booting off Disk & Disks via NFS?
Date: 25 Nov 1993 18:20:31 GMT

Hello fellow Linuxers,

I recently installed ethernet at home and I now have 2 machines networked.
I want to use Linux on both but it is only installed on one of them. I
would prefer not to repartition the harddisk of the PC without Linux, but
instead mount the disks of the Linux PC via NFS. Is it possible to create
a boot disk that does this and doesn't require a linux partition? Has anybody
done this already? I checked the Ethernet and NET-2 HOWTOs but found
nothing on this topic.

Thanks for help,

You have a 1542C (this was the first version of the 1542 series to be 
configured through the bios instead of through a whole bunch of jumpers).

The problem is the setting of "Bios suppor for more than 2 disks". With this
setting enabled, the 1542 Bios does some strange stuff to get Dos to support
more than the default maximum of 2 hds.  This extra monkeying around causes
problems for other operating systems, such as Linux.  This needs to be
disabled in order for Linux to work.  There is a line somewhere in the 
HOWTO that mentions this.

You can install device drivers (aspidisk.sys) to avoid using this feature
for DOS if needed.

Subject: diskette change after format?
Date: Thu, 25 Nov 1993 21:31:53 GMT

After I format a diskette, mke2fs -c cannot find the bad blocks.
To make an ext2fs on an imperfect diskette, I have to use
fdformat -n and then remove and reinsert the diskette before
running mke2fs -c.
Is this a fault with fdformat, mke2fs, or the diskette driver,
or is it supposed to work this way?
Or has it been fixed since 0.99pl10?
Is there a way to simulate a disk change without physically
removing the diskette from the drive?

Also, fdformat -n leaves the drive select lamp on when it exits.
Without the -n, the lamp goes out.
Is there any harm in this, ie is the drive still selected somehow?
If someone would point me at the source of fdformat I will attempt
a patch.

BTW I think it's really cool that ext2fs can handle bad blocks!
What a great little OS.

1. I DON'T reply to anonymous mail servers by mail. If you wish an email

2. MOTIF sources are not free. You require a source LICENSE. That means

3. There is no place that I know of which will allow you to FTP the sources.
It would violate the license agreement.

Since I posted a short message to the net a few days ago, many people
ask for more details. The Pentium machine is the Gateway2000 P5-60.
Here is what we have in it:
  Intel 60 MHz Pentium CPU
  16 MB RAM, 256 KB Cache
  3.5" FD & Mitsumi 2X CD-ROM
  1.005 GB HD (Seagate ST11200 SCSI, Adaptec 15??)
  4 ISA, 2 PCI & 1 PCI/ISA slots
  ATI AX0 graphics (2 MB, Mach32, PCI bus)
  1 parallel, 2 serials (16550) (built-in on motherboard)
  250 MB Colorado Jumbo tape drive

  AE-2 Lantastic Ethernet card (simulating NE2000)

  (don't know the manufacturer of the motherboard, can't remember
   the BIOS version)

We just got the machine for a week and I spent most of the time setting
up the network connection. I am a newbie to the Linux and I simply don't
have the answers to some questions people asked. I have not tested the
X-windows yet, in fearing of toasting my boss's monitor ;-). Besides, I
don't know whether the PCI bus is supported by the XFree86-2.0. The tape
and CD-ROM drives are not tested also. As to the performance, I have
a couple of numbers for you for reference:
  BogoMip 23.9    (less than a 486DX50 at home, 24.9)
  10 Mins to compile the kernel0.99.p13
  (make zImage only, not include make mrproper, make config, ..., etc)

Happy linuxing, folks.

   It looks to me you should try TeX. Allthough it isn't actually a
   'word processor', it is a typesetter.

   [Stuff deleted on just how good TeX really is..]
In the P.S. I then comment about chemical formulas:
   P.S. I'm not so sure how useful it is for MOLECULAR formulas...
   Perhaps there are some fonts out there that have characters with
   which you can make for instance (better looking then this of course)
                   | |              
                  -C=C-
                   | |
   I do not know of any other wordprocessor that could either.
   Of course you could use some kind of (vector)drawing program, and
   incorporate the formulas as drawings.
But obviously Miller was looking for some way to
do something like :  C2 + 2O2 --> 2 CO2 ..
In TeX this would be achieved by : $ C_2 + 2 O_2 \rightarrow 2 CO_2 $;
perhaps it would be better to change the math-fonts, as
math-italic isn't very nice for these kind of formulas.
Perhaps someone made a special .sty file for this for LaTex,
but anyway, changing a font isn't that hard under Tex.

   totalling about 90 Meg.  Also, the FAQs et. al. are included.  I thought this

   Any help would be greatly appreciated!

   Regards,

There are several different distributions around that have
a fair amount of software. Among the most used are SLS and Slackware.
Note that if you were to get Slackware, you would have to seperately 
get the TeX series (three diskettes) from the SLS distribution (you
can read this in the README_INSTALL of Slackware).
I am not sure how the manpages are, but the rest should be there.

Slackware can be obtained at ftp-site: ftp.cdrom.com in directory
/pub/linux/slackware or /pub/linux/zooed_slackware.
SLS can be obtained at tsx-11.mit.edu; probably a directory
as /pub/linux/packages/SLS or something similar.
There are various mirror sites of the distributions; I think that
sunsite was going to mirror Slackware as well.

Of the two, I think Slackware is the more popular, certainly as is it
updated much more frequent, and 'bugs' seems to be handled much
quicker. The SLS version probably hasn't switched to XFree 2.0 yet,
but Slackware certainly has.

Slackware gives (with 'PROMPT' option of setup) some indication
what the packages are about. I personally have installed Slackware
1.1.0, and use somewhere around 94 Mb of harddisk. If you however
choose to also install networking etc. this would probably increase.

Hope this helps,

        You'll have to explain this to me.
        I think asking "I need an Xconfig for card X" is valid -  it
provides the user with a working Xconfig for their card which may or may
not suit their monitor timings.  At least they can start up X and start
tweaking.
        Also "I need an Xconfig for monitor X" is an ambiguous question
but still can yeild useful information.  In a convoluted way the queston
means "Please give me some suitable monitor timings for any card".  Even
if you havent got the right card, you can atleast derive what the
monitor timings are, then rework them for the card you have got.
        So '100 times as many fo the former' is in fact rational, useful
behaviour, where else do you start?  And i'm sure that most users
resolve their Xconfig this way.  After all why supply sample Xconfigs
with display parameters at all?  I personally benefitted with the sample
ET4000 configs supplied with svgalib - doubled my cards speed to
4.9Mbytes/s at 1024*768*256  (ISA :).

        In general I would agree that it is possible to destructively
program hardware.  Many mother-boards are vulnerable to rougue
programming of their bus/DMA/ram controllers causing bus contention and
leading to overheating of chips.

        I think that users are advised to check chip temperatures after
a few minutes when such low-level, potentially destructive tweaking is
concerned.  Watch out the next time you fiddle with you BIOS chipset
setup.  Some of the options are listed, but dont exist!

Where did you get this kernel from?

I suspect you hadn't mounted the /proc filesystem. My /etc/fstab
contains the line 

none            /proc           proc    defaults

and all works fine, provided that you compiled your kernel with
support for the procfs. 

Ciao,

SGML is a `programming language for style sheets' and not what you
want.

yes, there are lots of ways to generate graphics for inclusion into
LaTeX. pstricks has been mentioned which is fine if postscript is ok.

to see the range of packages available for graphics with TeX/LaTeX,
ftp to pip.shsu, cd to tex-archives/graphics and look around. the 
subdirs are unpacked; to download do, say, 
  get mfpic.tar.gz
to get the mfpic subdir

as to what the best package is, that depends. my own feeling is that
THE way to do graphics in TeX is to use METAFONT in one way or other.
 1) mf is the graphics language Knuth developed for use with TeX
 2) mf graphics are more portable..all dvi drivers support it
 3) mf is a nice programming language
the above and other arguments are gone into i more detail in:
tsx-11.mit.edu, pub/linux/packages/TeX/Milieu/milieu.tz (unpack,
cd book, make, xdvi milieu) or, if you use Mosaic, open:
 http://milieu.grads.vt.edu/ which has a link to the dvi file.

the above text is about using METAFONT `straight' with TeX, etc.  this
is the best approach in the long run, i think. there are, of course,
other ways to use mf with TeX:
 1) for no programming, use xfig and then use fig2mf to make
      the mf font source
 2) use the mfpic macro package for TeX which is a high level
    graphics macro package for Tex that uses mf.

PS: for simple graphics such as flowcharts, etc. LaTeX itself has
support for that with its picture environment.
 XTeXcad is an X based wysiwyg util that u can draw with which
outputs LaTeX code. as i recall the xtexcad binary is posted somewhere
