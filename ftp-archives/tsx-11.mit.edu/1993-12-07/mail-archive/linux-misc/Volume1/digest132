I am going to be getting a Tandberg SCSI tape drive that is offered from
John Jaskolski on the net. I was wondering what different software can be
used with them and what other people think about the drives. ie how they
perform under Linux.

                                        thanks

Subject: [Q] Another HW recommendation requested
Date: Tue, 14 Sep 1993 17:47:25 GMT


I'm looking for an EISA/VLB/SCSI-II combination
to run Linux/X on. The system shall be used initially as
an Xterm hooked up to a network of file and compute server
workstations (mostly suns, hps, and a few obsolete apollos).

EISA    ...  because I want access to > 16M.
VLB     ...  for fast graphics.
SCSI-II ...  I plan on doing lots of edit/compile iterations 
             (and besides, someday I just might buy a CD player ;-).

If the pc hardware/software combination is fast enough, 
the pc will replace some of the older/obsolete workstations
and X terminals that are currently being used.


I've already decided on a 17" autoscan Philips monitor
        *) model 1762DT, .25mm dot pitch
           Horz. freq.: 30 - 64 KHz
           Vert. freq.: 50 - 100 Hz

because I get a steep company discount and 
it looks and performs great connected to an old Sun4/260
or a 486/66 from PC-Professional running Linux.


What I'm most concerned about is the motherboard.
I was leaning towards COMTRADE because of their
price/performance but the net consensus seems to be 
that Comtrade's NICE mini-EISA motherboard is not a 
true EISA implementation. 
Micron's offering fits the bill but is on the high side w/r to cost
(even with their recent $200 reduction),
we've had problems with DOA equipment from Gateway,
and although we like, and have had good service/support/equipment
from PC Professionals based in NJ, they only offer
IDE based 486/66 w/VLB systems.


1) So what EISA/VLB/SCSI motherboard and/or PC clone
   do you recommended?


2) As a followup, do you know which keyboard manufacturer,
   sells a keyboard whose key layout matches a Sun-4 type keyboard.
   The Sun-4 type keyboard is similar to the AT keyboard in the
   placement of the <CTRL> key (next to the "a" key). 
   So on the left from top to bottom it's

   <ESC> 1 2 3 4 5
   <TAB>  q w e r t y
   <CTRL>  a s d f g
   <SHIFT>  z x c v
   <CL><ALT><META> <SPACE-BAR>

 
  I'm most concerned about the location of the <CTRL> and
  <ESC> (control and escape) keys.


Thanks for your time and comments.

Subject: What are jiffies?
Date: 14 Sep 1993 19:22:34 GMT

Gathering the necessary information for writing a 3c507 driver,
I found contradicting info about the "jiffies", needed for timouts,
in the source tree (of 0.99.10, if that matters):

/usr/src/linux/include/linux/lp.h:
/* timeout for printk'ing a timeout, in jiffies (100ths of a second).

/usr/src/linux/net/tcp/auto_irq.c:
/usr/src/linux/net/inet/auto_irq.c:
/usr/src/patches/tcp/auto_irq.c:
    To use this, first call autoirq_setup(timeout). TIMEOUT is how many
    'jiffies' (1/18 sec.) to detect other devices that have active IRQ lines,

man -k jiffies
finds nothing!

Also, I found jiffies correlated to HZ, which seems to be 100 on Linux,
but on other unixes it is the power line freqency of 50 or 60 Hz.
I guess HZ can be overriden in the kernel config file and break things...

Some existing networking code uses timeout values between 5 and 15 jiffies.
So what definition is correct?

I am working on it ! First version works ok, but needs a little cleanup.
I think I will release a beta-version next weekend (i am waiting for a mail
from the author (Julian Smart) and from Eric Youngdale for the final address-
space I should use).
The version I used was the 1.40 with xview widgets (I don't have motif, want to
buy me one :-)) ??? ). Right now I am cleaning up and testing but also looking
at version 1.50 which is in beta now. Probably it would be best to try the
newer version when it is stable enough ...

Okay, let me get this straight.  We use a.out, SYSV3 uses COFF, SYSV4
uses ELF, and SCO uses COFF?  Is this right?  Well, it doesn't really
matter that much.

So what your saying is when we get the COFF/ELF support finished, I'd
be able to FTP something that was compiled on SCO for SCO and run it
like I would a linux app.  That's cool...

Okay, now let me ask you this - how about AIX/386 Version?  I am pretty
sure that it uses a.out format.  What would I need to do to run it on
Linux?

Whoa! Everything that I have read claims that OS/2 will trash any
partitions that it does not understand, which includes Linux partitions
(and probably everything except those partitions made by OS/2 itself).
If you make your partitions with an OS other than OS/2, then use OS/2
I think that you are running the risk of losing them. I am no expert,
but that is how I understood the warnings that have been printed in
the FAQs (presumably *by* experts).

You should probably get "An Introduction to Tcl and Tk" by
John Ousterhout. He, being the principal developer of Tcl/Tk
knows what he is talking about. Very good book. It is in 
draft format (postscript files) on harbor.ecn.purdue.edu
or sprite.berkeley.edu. It is 4 files.

If you will be building apps using Tk and Tcl, you should 
deffinitelly get the program Xf. Excellent interface/app builder.

I've been porting olvwm 3.3 to linux, being that the version on 
sunsite is 3.1 (I think).  Anyway.. most of it went ok, except for
the references to:

step() & 
compile()

Both are in regexp.h on a Sun, but they aren't in linux that I can tell.

Does anybody out there know what these two do?  Or have any suggestions
as to how I can make a generic version of each to link into olvwm?

I really don't want to read all the code of olvwm if I don't have to.

Thanks,

There is only one book on tcl/tk- the one by the author, and it has not
yet been released (soon though.) 

The pre-prints for this book are available in post-script form on 
sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/languages/tcl/sprite-mirror/book*.

If you don't have a post-script printer, you can view it with
ghostscript and ghostview.

Well, the way I understand it (flames about my ignorance to /dev/null), NTFS is
only slightly different than HPFS, so if you get one running, you should also
just about have the other one.

OS/2 is rather fussy...I couldn't do any more than rename a partition 
ID with Linux fdisk 1.4.  When I tried to mark a partition active, I 
didn't have a lot of fun (couldn't even get to bootmanager).

The OS/2 fdisk appears to work quite acceptably. I've used it to 
make all the partitions on my system and only thing I had to 
use the Linux fdisk for was to change the file system type for
the Linux partition.

I currently have: OS/2, NT, Chicago, NextStep and Linux all
happily coexisting and booting from OS/2's Boot Manager.

Administrative notes:

There has been some confusion about this posting.  A few people have
objected to my posting it in groups like comp.os.linux(.misc),
commenting that "they're DOS games, not appropriate for {Linux, NeXT
cubes, Suns}."

I only post this to groups that deal with machines and operating
systems *that the games will run on*.  Currently, that includes the
following:

- PC clones under MS-DOS
- Macintoshes
- Atari ST/TT/Falcon
- Sun Sparcstation (SunOS or Solaris 2)
- Sun 3
- DECstation (MIPS) running Ultrix
- SGI (Iris/Indigo/Indy) running Irix
- Linux (386)
- NeXT

A significant advantage of the all-text format is that the games are
easy to port -- trivial, in fact.  The machine-independent game files
we put on the archive sites will run without modification on any system
that has a TADS run-time.  Even if your system is not one of those
listed above, it should be easy to get the TADS run-time running on it
if it is at all Unix-like.  Though source to the TADS run-time is not
freely distributable, you can generally get it for porting purposes
just by asking the folks at High Energy Software and filling out a
non-discolsure agreement.  (More info about TADS is at the end this
message.)

Finally, one person felt that the previous posting was too commerical.
In an effort to avoid abusing the net, I've removed everything but a
brief mention of our commercial game.

                    The Unnkulian Unventure Series
                     Adventure Games for the 90's


Remember the good old days, when adventure games challenged you with
great puzzles and evocative descriptions without resorting to any
graphics at all?  We really miss that emphasis on gameplay rather than
glitz, so we've decided to write our own adventure games along the
lines of the early text games we liked so much.

If you're looking for top-quality interactive fiction comparable to
1980's commercial offerings, check out the Unnkulian Unventure series,
available from an archive site near you!

In _Unnkulian Underworld: The Unknown Unventure_ you play the part of
Kuulest's slave, and must recover the Orb of Studosity from the evil
Unnkulians.  Kuulest, the old geezebag, has died and left you with
nothing to go on but a cryptic message about saving the planet.  You'll
encounter amazing Acme products, the infamous Guardian, those witty
creatures known as Drolls, a giant beaver, and even the Dread Unnkulian
Warrior.  <Gasp!>

In _Unnkulian Unventure II: The Secret of Acme_ your adventure
continues as you try to create some good press for yourself -- wouldn't
want to fade into anonymous obscurity, now would you?  Along the way,
you'll find the answers to these compelling questions, and more:

        o What happened to the Unnkulians?
        o Why are Acme products so bad?
        o What is this cheez stuff, really?

Plus, you'll get to explore Dawg Rock, a Duhdist Retreat, Acme's
clandestine prototypes laboratory, and even pay a visit to Acme HQ.

In _Unnkulia One-Half: The Salesman Triumphant_, you'll play the role
of a down-and-out Acme salesman, forced to work out of the Golden
Dragon Inn, dangerously near Dread Unnkulia.  Will you accumulate
enough loot in this frightful backwater berg to turn your fortunes
in your favor?

And, in _Unnkulia Zero: The Search for Amanda_, will you, the Valley
King's most trusted warrior, rescue his Lady Amanda from the gruesome
clutches of the evil Unnkulians?

The Unnkulian Unventures have already gotten rave reviews from numerous
adventure game connoisseurs around the world, so why not give them a try?

The games are available for FTP from the if-archive at ftp.gmd.de.

        TADS now runs on lots of different systems.  Because of this,
        the files listed above are TADS .GAM-file only archives that
        can be used with any machine that runs TADS.  The tricky bit is
        that before you can play the games, you need to get the TADS
        run-time for your machine.

        Fortunately, this isn't hard to do.  Just grab the TADS
        executable package for your machine from the if-archive:

        Sun Sparcstation (SunOS):

                if-archive/programming/tads/sparc-sunos.tads2exe.tar.Z

        Sun Sparcstation (Solaris):

                if-archive/programming/tads/sparc-solaris.tads2exe.tar.Z

        Sun 3:
        
                if-archive/programming/tads/sun3.tads2exe.tar.Z

        DECstation (MIPS) running Ultrix:
        
                if-archive/programming/tads/decmips.tads2exe.tar.Z

        SGI (Iris/Indigo/Indy) running Irix:
        
                if-archive/programming/tads/sgi-irix.tads2exe.tar.Z

        Linux (386):

                if-archive/programming/tads/linux.tads2exe.tar.Z

        NeXT:

                if-archive/programming/tads/NeXT.tads2exe.tar.Z

        Amiga, other Unix:

                In the works!

        The file How-To-Run-These-Games in the same directory gives
        your more information.

NOTE:

        The source to TADS 2 is not distributable.  However, if your
        machine isn't on the list yet, and you would like to volunteer
        to port TADS 2 to it, send email about it to Mike Roberts
        <mroberts@hinrg.starconn.com>.  Porting to Unix-like systems is
        fairly trivial.

Unnkulian Unventures I and II are shareware ($10 registration fee
each); registering gets you spiffy maps and agony-sparing hint sheets.

Unnkulia One-Half is free -- don't pay us for it!

Unnkulia One-Half comes with a playable demo of Unnkulia Zero and info
on how to get the complete version.

Happy adventioning!

A Word About TADS
=================

We at ADVENTIONS use a programming language called TADS to write our
games.  TADS is a product of High Energy Software, and you can get it
via FTP.

TADS (and TADS goodies) are available for many systems from
ftp.gmd.de.  Look in the if-archive/programming/tads directory.

TADS is also shareware, and we strongly encourage you to register it if
you use it, since we feel it is a powerful, innovative, and very
inexpensive development system that deserves to be paid for.
