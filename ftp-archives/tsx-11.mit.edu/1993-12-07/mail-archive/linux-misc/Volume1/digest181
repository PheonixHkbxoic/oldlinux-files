Can I get a world wide web browser up and going under Linux?

Do I need SL/IP (I have a dialup connection, fast modem),
or can I use term in some fashion?

I'd prefer it to the Windows- based solution (who wouldn't?)

I've used the 1542C with a Wangtek 5525ES internal tape drive in various
configurations without experiencing any SCSI timeouts.  Here are some of
the setups I've tried:

  - tape drive alone
  - tape drive with internal SCSI HD (terminal and non-terminal)
  - tape drive with external SCSI devices (at various times HDs, Bernoulli,
    and CD-ROM)

I've also done backups of Bernoulli disks to tape while doing other things
using the SCSI HD, such as compiling programs, without encountering the
timeouts.

I'm still using 0.99pl11, though.

Just my experiences,

James.

I've found xmosaic, and I've found the patches to make it work with term,
but since I don't own the Motif package (yet!) I don't see how I can
build it, and archie couldn't find me a statically linked binary.

Does anyone have a statically linked motif binary of xmosaic+term I
can get a copy of? (As far as I know this is legitimate, right?
Must be, there are plenty of xmosaic binaries floating around, just
none with the term patches.)

The correct fix for this is to change NR_SHIFT to be 4. This is fixed in
newer kernels, I don't remember if it's in pl13, but at least the next
one has the fix.

It seems your patches are against an old version of loadkeys. Check out
kbd-0.82.tar.gz, I think the loadkeys in it does much what you wanted.

Yes, there are two versions of Xmosaic on sunsite, one for
standard tcp/ip the other for term.  find them in

What bothers me is that they don't mention that you can get Linux free

I've tried to stay out of this, but this is too much.
First let me say that while I would not call it false advertising,
I find SLS's ad in Byte to be misleading.
However, in my opinion, the contribution of the SLS release of Linux
has been a huge contribution to the wider use and proliferation of Linux.
To say that Peter MacDonald has not contributed to Linux is ridiculous.
To say that he is taking credit for others work is also way out of line.

Peter MacDonald does /benefit/ from the work of others. 
He adds his own value to what others have done.  I get sick and tired 
of people who have the attitude that only developers do anything valuable
or useful.  I can tell you from experience as both a hacker and businessman,
that actually getting some software working is a /very/ small part
of creating something that other people want and can use, and even
more so in creating something people will actually pay for.

I obtained the termftp.tar.Z distribution from sunsite, assuming
(from its name and location) that it was an implementation/port of
ftp for the term package. It built fine, and does indeed reference
the term directory so I suppose that's what it's supposed to be,
but when I run it it complains about not being able to find
the tcp service, and it makes tcp/ip-ish calls that aren't in
the term library to my knowledge.

What is this really, and how can I make it work? (: It came with
no documentation beyond the normal ftp manpage.

I agree with you 100% on your observations and comments.
I would also add that Linux folks will say you are free to build your
own Linux package that is a system like you want.  Why hasn't someone done it?
It has no benefit for the people who would develop it. 
It would only benefit naive end-users, who are seen by many Linux people as 
a lower form of life.  Such end-user software is developing by paid programmers
who would rather spend their time doing something else.

Linux was developed by hackers for use by hackers. 
If others find it useful, then they are lucky.

You don't have to copy to whole map, just put your definitions into a
file, say my.map, and run "loadkeys my.map" in your /etc/rc.local. If
you're base keytable is not us.map, but e.g. uk.map, use a command like
"loadkeys /usr/lib/keytables/uk.map my.map".

Well, close but no cigar. Your entry defines key 58 in the following
way:

modifiers               Action

plain                   Control
Shift                   Control
AltGr                   Caps_Lock
Shift+AltGr             VoidSymbol
Control                 Control
Shift+Control           VoidSymbol
AltGr+Conrol            VoidSymbol
Shift+AltGr+Control     VoidSymbol
Alt                     Caps_Lock
Shift+Alt               VoidSymbol
AltGr+Alt               VoidSymbol
Shift+AltGr+Alt         VoidSymbol
Control+Alt             VoidSymbol
Shift+Control+Alt       VoidSymbol
AltGr+Control+Alt       VoidSymbol
Shift+AltGr+Control+Alt VoidSymbol

That doesn't happen to me. However, if you press the Caps_Lock key with
Shift, you end up in the situation you described. This is because
Shift+Caps_Lock turns on the control modifier, per your entry. So, while
holding down Shift+Caps_Lock, you have modifiers Shift and Control set.
Now, when you release Caps_Lock, a VoidSymbol is generated, because
Caps_Lock with shift and control is bound to VoidSymbol. So, while you
are holding down the Shift, you still have the modifiers Shift and
Control in effect. When you release Shift, shift modifier is reset, but
the control modifiers remains. If you had Control bound to
Caps_Lock+Shift+Control, the control modifier would have been reset when
Caps_Lock was released.

>For some reason, rht-ALT-prtscrn still switches to the previous console,
>and up-cursor brings back old commands.

This is because Control+AltGr+PrtScreen is bound to the same action as
AltGr+PrtScreen. Cursor keys are also by default bound identically whether
pressed with control or not.

>But lft-ALT-F{n} does not switch VC's.

This is because Control+Alt+Fn combinations are bound to VoidSymbol by
default.

Hmm... I'd need more info to comment that.

This isn't one of those IBM-rip Tandberg drives is it?  There have been
quite a few messages about the ROM versions on those not actually
implementing SCSI, but something that's IBM specific.

I'd suggest contacting Tandberg with your ROM numbers for the full story...

Yep.  That's what it is.  There are apparently quite a few floating around.
I just ordered replacement firmware from Tandberg ($40 plus shipping).  We'll
see what that does when it comes in.

Still, no matter how confused the tape drive firmware is it shouldn't put
the 1542C in a state where it needs to be power-cycled to restore sanity.

First off, lets move this out of comp.os.linux (a dying group). I'm moving it
to comp.os.linux.misc (not .help, this is a legitamate bug)

Second, while the above _WORKAROUND_ will work, it is _*NOT*_ the proper 
final solution. The proper fix is for X to be compiled so that the SIGHUP 
signal handler is either not one-shot, or is reset, so that X doesn't just 
exit on the second SIGHUP. It seems X is expecting BSD signal handling, 
and is getting POSIX.


Again, this is a serious _*BUG*_ in Xfree86 which must be fixed if Xfree86 
is to be useful in production enviornments and to be considered reliable, as 
opposed to just a toy. It wil be considered a toy by those that need a 
_working_ system, unless _KNOWN BUGS_ eventually get fixed.

Luckily, when I mentioned and fixed the kernel bug with kill -0 pid back in 
0.98pl0, it was made part of the kernel for 0.98pl1. I hope the Xfree86 
people will be as responsive to this problem has Linus was with the kernel.

P.S. Don't say: "Why don't _you_ fix this bug too?! Not unless you will give 
me a free 1GIG hard disk."

I wouldn't be so frustrated, if the people in charge and those on the 
newsgroup acknowleged this is a bug, instead of pretending it is okay.
