Ask the various Linux T-Shirt vendors how many shirts they sold.

I'm running SLS 1.01 with various upgrades to the kernel, gcc and xfree. I'm
looking at going pl12 which means grabing the new gcc too. I'm just wondering
if its worth while to get the latest SLS and update everything.
What other benifits would I see (ie unmount fs on shutdown etc)?
Also what sort of hassle would I have to go through to maintain my current
configurations for X, news, users etc?

Thanks

I am looking for a PC to run Linux/X. In order to do the best
investment, I have a naive question below (if it is FAQ, please
point me the place for answer). 

If my memory is correct, Linux was developed for ISA bus and 
before the time of major popularity of local bus. I remember
somewhere in June's version FAQ said EISA won't help improve
the performance of Linux. I am wondering whether the latest
XFree can take the advantage from some of the so-called
window-accelerated video cards and makes display faster?

Any information will be much appreciated.

IBM also had a 68000 based computer about that time, in a box the same size 
as a PC. I remember it because a lot of MIT people were excited about it.
It was made by some kind of IBM laboratory products group, so it had
an expansion I/O bus.

I have found something that might explain this.  The
`stripped-down' bash uses `nojobs.c', which does not set the
child's signal mask to the mask inherited by bash from its
parent.  (On Posix systems, this is simply an omission; that code
should be in there.) This may change the handling of SIGHUP in a
way that causes your problem. 

If linking the `full' bash to /bin/sh makes startx work when it
did not before, send me mail.

I would suggest that anyone coming to the upcoming UnixExpo in NYC (or any
other major Unix show) badger as many companies about Linux as possible.
Ask about ports to Linux for as many applications as possible, and you

Neat, I got to play with the SimCity demo on the Sun and thought about
asking them if they'd consider a port to Linux. It's very addicting.

This would be much better (for this non-dos-user, at least) than
thinking about getting it running under dosemu!

I think the price for the Sun version is $89, perhaps a bit high for a
game, but of course much less than other Unix software. If the 
price were the same as the dos version I would definitely buy.

Date: 10 Sep 1993 12:28:00 -0700

does anyone know if Linux will work with a WORM drive? I've been seeing 
ads for Maxtor 800 MB WORM drives. The come with controllers that 
connect betweeen a SCSI adapter and the WORM drive. The result (under
DOS) is that you don't need any special drivers. Will this work
under Linux? Is any SCSI drive that works under DOS definately
going to work under Linux?

Particularly, I'm concerned with how unerasing erased files work.
(more properly, i should say "how you make available a previously
unavailable file", since no real "erasing" takes place.

Any info would be appreciated, as I'd sure like to get one of
these monster drivers.

Email to william@cs.arizona.edu is preferable, but I do keep up
with the group. If people ask, I'll post a summary.

Are they not terribly insecure?

Reply-To: jeske@ux4.cso.uiuc.edu


        Ok, I have tried this post before. Is anyone successfully
using a Tandberg 3600 tape drive (QIC-150 SCSI) with Linux. I have one
which is working, but it will often not allow me to put "another" archive
on to a tape with existing archives on it. It says "write error" and dosn;t
even touch the drive. 

I have been informed that there are 2 firmware revisions of the tape drive
one which is "sort of SCSI 1", and one which is "REALLY close to SCSI 1".  
I'm not sure which one I have. 

Apparently the one which is "sort of SCSI 1", has a behavior where the tape
drive does not "clear" an error after sending it to the host. So that the
host could think that the old error is still occuring. Does anyone know
if there is an easy to determine if this is the problem. Or if it's a
blocksize problem?

Any ideas would be appreciated, please respond in email

Subject: Zombie processes
Date: Fri, 10 Sep 1993 13:48:34 GMT


I have a little problem with 0.99pl12alpha kernel.
The problem is in that fork() fails with EAGAIN (no more processes)
if there are many zombie processes. The number of user's processes 
is limited to NR_TASKS / 2 (which is 32 by default), and fork() counts zombie
processes as well. The problem may occur if you have some program
(like desktop manager or something), which starts many processes and doesn't
wait() for them. Then after some time there will be too many zombies, and you
will be unable to start more processes. 

So, my question is: is this behavior defined by some standard (posix)? If not,
it would be simple and useful to fix it (a trivial patch to kernel/fork.c).

Actually, being almost free, Linux is ideally suited for creating a plug and play
Internet node.  With the exploding interest in the Internet, all it would take
would be some creative partnering with PC hardware companies that are desperately
looking for ways to add $$ to their margins and to differentiate themselves.

It would take some packaging but the low cost of the software + the availability
of source would make it very attractive.

So who wants to do this ?
Anyone want to help me do it :-) ?

This is the correct behaviour in all Unices I have come across. The reason for
having a zombie is that all child process have an exit status, which the kernel
(rightly) assumes the parent will want to examine. This status is kept in the
process table entry. When the parent does a wait() type system call the childs
exit status will be delivered to the parent and the process table entry for
the child will then be released. If the parent never does the wait the process
table entry is effectively locked. If the parent process dies (exits) the
orphan children get inherited by process 1 (init) which always does a wait
and so the children's proc. table entries would be release that way.
From what you say it sound like bad coding in the parent. One can set a signal
handler for SIGCHLD (sometimes called SIGCLD) so that when a child dies you
get a signal and can do a wait and see which child died and what it's exit
status was.
I believe there is a section on this in POSIX 1003.1 but I don't have my copy to
hand so I can't quote chapter & verse.

cheers,
Jo

Ultrastor 34F SCSI, SCSI-2, local bus controller.

Less than 4months old. latest bio chipset 200080.006 (not the
earlier buggy version, which has problems with MS-DOS)

Worked perfectly with DOS, Linux (but it is supposed to work with OS/2,
SCO and other commercial UNIX systems).

In original packaging, with all software drivers (one floppy disk) and
documents included. (just one brochure)

Paid $279 +s/h from DC Drives.

Price reduced to $180, and I'll pay shipping.
