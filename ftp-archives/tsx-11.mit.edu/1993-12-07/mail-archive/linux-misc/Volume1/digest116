Hi everyone,  I've run Sewyon successfulyy but when I exit it and at a
later time try to run it again it says that it can't find the modem
(/dev/cua2).  I've checked the /usr/spool/uucp directory but nothing there.
Could anyone help me?  Please reply by e-mail since this site currently
carries only comp.os.linux and no other linux news groups.

Thanks,

I'm sorry but the answers are no and no. Xircom has refused to release the
programming specs for their product. I'd advise that you return the Xircom
product and get a D-Link adapter. The driver for the D-Link adapter is 
already in the kernel.

Also if you do decide to return it, please tell them that you would have
used their product if they released their programming specs. Maybe if
enough folks do that then they'll change their minds.

Has anyone built shared libraries for the new

the mkimage program. I get a 'Undefined symbol(__jump.o):
__main referenced from text segement' error. I thought 
this might be because for some reason tclMain.c is included
in the library. However, after taking that out and starting

Yes it exists and the company I work for is a Beta test site and we have the
actual release. Our PC users have a choice between NT and Windows for
Workgroups and guess what most are choosing: Windows for Workgroups.

Wrong, the reason is that Motorola couldn't/wouldn't deliver enough
68000's and didn't think much of IBM's PC project. By the way your
8-bit argument doesn't hold because the first PC had a 8086, 16 bit;
later a cheaper version was made with the 8088. And Motorola also had
an 8-bit version of the 68000, the 68008, which was used in the
Sinclair QL.

Here is a portion of our current release announcement: 

                       Andrew Toolkit Release 5.1 

The Andrew Toolkit Consortium of Carnegie Mellon University's School of
Computer Science is pleased to announce the release of new versions of
the Andrew User Environment, Andrew Toolkit, and Andrew Message System.  

    The Andrew User Environment (AUE) is an integrated set of
    applications beginning with a 'generic object' editor, ez, a help
    system, a system monitoring tool (console), an editor-based shell
    interface (typescript), and support for printing multi-media
    documents.  

    The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable user-interface toolkit
    that runs under X11. It provides a dynamically-loadable
    object-oriented environment wherein objects can be embedded in
    one-another. Thus, one could edit text that, in addition to
    containing multiple fonts, contains embedded raster images,
    spreadsheets, drawing editors, equations, simple animations,
    etc. These embedded objects could themselves contain other
    objects, including text. With the toolkit, programmers can
    create new objects that can be embedded as easily as those that
    come with the system. 

    The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface
    to mail and bulletin-boards.  AMS supports several mail
    management strategies and implements many advanced  features
    including authentication, return receipts, automatic sorting of
    mail, vote collection and tabulation, enclosures, audit trails
    of related messages, and subscription management. It also
    provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and
    low-function personal computers in addition to the high-function
    workstations. 

Release 5.1 of Andrew contains many bug fixes, updates and improvements
in both code and documentation. Release 5.1 also contains a variety of
new facilities, including support for the new Internet MIME
(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards for multipart,
multimedia mail.  

Remote Andrew Demo Service 

This network service allows you to run Andrew Toolkit applications
without the overhead of obtaining or compiling the Andrew software.  You
need a host machine on the Internet, and you need to be running the X11
window system.  A simple "finger" command will allow you to experience
ATK applications firsthand.  You'll be able to compose multimedia
documents, navigate through the interactive Andrew Tour, and use the
Andrew Message System to browse through CMU's three thousand bulletin
boards and newsgroups. 

To use the Remote Andrew Demo service, simply run the following command
on your machine: 

    finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu 

The service will give you further instructions.

NT is here!  My campus bookstore ordered 4 copies.  I was "lucky" enough to
get the last one for $149 (before educational discount).  It has 22 3-1/2"
diskettes and a seperate CD-ROM and requires at least 75 MB HD space to
install.

After loaded on my 8 MB Ram (with 20 MB RAM) 486-66 machine, I was greatly
disappointed.  User login takes 37 seconds while logout takes 17 seconds!
Fortunately, I'm only using it to play games.  75 MB of OS without much
applications!

OK, go easy on me guys, I'm a BSD person new to the world of Linux.

DEC notebook PC, 486-25 SLC, color, 4MB's, 80MB partition for Linux.

I installed Slackware 1.0.2.  Went fine.  Piece of cake.  Works fine.

Snarfed up the new q1 disk with the alpha 0.99.13a (or whatever the numbering
scheme is these days), built a kernel, but now, about every 30 seconds I 
get 'Floppy: unexpected interrupt' on which ever console I'm working on.

I didn't get it in the 0.99.12 release, and when I went back to it, it
worked fine.  Anybody know what changed in 12->13 that might cause the 
problem?

Any help appreciated.

BTW, congrats on a smooth install procedure, and the fact that the Linux
boot disks from Slackware are the only ones that will boot my notebook when
running off the batter in non-turbo-mode.  Hell, suspend mode works too.
Kudos on a fine job.  Us BSD people need to take lessons.

You didn't happen to have a write protected floppy in the drive did you? If you
did, and the drive was mounted r/w, everytime update tried to sync the disks
Linux would have complained about not being able to write to it.

Just a guess.

=====BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE=====


        Many thanks for the excellent Linux manuals. But I have one request:
Would it be possible to PLEASE split these up into seperate PS doccuments for
a group of pages (say every 10)? My PostScript printer has limited memory
(I think it has 1mb, but as it is really a RISC card inside a slaved PC,
I can't be sure), and both of the documents are WAY too big for me to print
out. It's not the LENGTH of the documents that is a problem, but rather they
seem to be layed out as one contiguous hunk of PS code which my system is
(I assume) barfing on when the memory overflows. They basically get copied out
to the printer, but nothing ever comes out.

        The only way I have been able to do anything with them so far has been
to (don't laugh) use GhostScript to convert them to FAX format and then fax
them from my FAX card to my real FAX machine (the Installation manual is 6mb
after conversion, haven't tried the Net Guide yet).

        Or is there a way I can use GhostScript to interpret them and then
spit out NEW PostScript code that only covered a few pages?

I had that original problem and I disappeared when I removed
my NE2000 ethernet card.  I think my problem was that it was 
trying to autoconfig for a WD ethernet card and that 
conflicted with my setting on the ethernet card.

Than again, if you don't have an ethernet card then I guess
that can't be it.

Whether Motorola could deliver enough 68Ks or not is immaterial, IBM
had other reasons for selecting the 8088 (the best reason for it over
the 68K was the 8-bit data path).  I know that the 8086 was first, but
the 8088 was also out then and IBM used it because of the 8-bit data
path (the chip actually wasn't much cheaper than the 8086, but
8-bit support circuitry was significantly cheaper than 16-bit support
at that time).  The only computers in which IBM used the 8086 (PCs)
were the PS/2 models 25 and 30.

Well, if you can get ahold of a dvips installation grab the dvi file
and convert the {nag,sag,gs}.dvi file a bit at a time to .ps.  You
would do a 

% dvips -p =1 -l =10 -o first.ten.of.document.ps  document.dvi
% dvips -p =11 -l=21 -o second.ten.of.document.ps document.dvi

etc, etc, etc...
