Based on the comments I've received in the mail and on this forum, here's the
second version of the NT versus Linux comparison chart:

Comments:

- I don't think the Linux kernel is set up to address more than 4 gig
  internally.  You'd have to play with segment registers to access more
  than that.  Not that it matters at this point.  By the time you have
  that much memory (core + swap), you're running more than what the
  fastest Pentium would be able to comfortably handle in most circumstances,
  and you'll probably want a faster bus anyway.

- Linux wasn't designed at the outset to port to every piece of hardware
  available.  If you want that attribute, then perhaps this comparison should 
  be between BSD and NT.  That Linux is being ported to the 680x0 is evidence 
  enough that it's at least somewhat portable.

- DDE is presumably higher level than the sockets, pipes, and other things
  that you use under Unix.  I don't know what this buys you, so I'll wait
  for more comments to come in.

- Alan Cox reports that his March beta of NT had unstable networking.  I
  don't know if it's been fixed.  So I've marked it as tentatively stable
  until I find out otherwise (thus giving NT the benefit of the doubt).

- In general, I've been conservative about the NT entries since I've never
  messed with it myself.  I've preserved the original values where there
  hasn't been comment.

- Linux partition sizes are not limited to the maximum size of a partition in
  the partition table.  A filesystem may reside on a device directly, thus
  bypassing the partition mechanism.  However, if you wish to partition a
  device, you're going to be limited by the DOS partition table mechanism.  I
  don't know if NT has its own partitioning mechanism.

- If NT doesn't have networked window support (i.e., client/server model
  windowing), then I don't see what the big hubbub about networking in NT
  is all about.  NFS, FTP, telnet, etc., are all nice and everything, but
  it's old technology.  So's client/server windowing, for that matter, but
  that kind of windowing technology is a huge win in a windowed networking
  environment, e.g. where you're running a bunch of workstations or, better
  yet, a fast machine with lots of X terminals hanging off it.  Of course,
  someone might be able to implement the X protocol for NT.  :-)

- NT has C2 security, but probably only because it's a single-user system!
  That simplifies security *a lot*.  As I don't know what's involved in
  implementing C2 security, I removed the "easily implementable" from the
  Linux entry.  Unless there are requirements that by definition eliminate
  multiuser systems, C2 security should be implementable under Linux, but
  you might have to do some headstanding.

- Being a microkernel is a performance loss on a single-processor standalone
  machine.  It's a win if you have multiple processors or if you have a
  network of machines that can share execution.  Since I don't know the
  details of the NT kernel, I don't know if network processor sharing
  is something that NT can take advantage of.  Networking would have to
  happen on a pretty low level to make that possible.  Linux was designed
  explicitly to run on PC clone hardware, so these considerations weren't, er,
  considered.  And since most of us happen to be running PC clone hardware,
  guess which OS gets the performance win?  Hint: it isn't NT.

        I was told, when I expressed interest in seeing how well (poorly?)
NT would run on my 10M 386DX/25 that it made use of the 3 or 4 instructions
that exist in the 486 and not in the 386.  (mostly to do with clearing
the on-chip cache, etc).  Is this true?

Try spic as a viewer. It's on sunsite somewhere and IMHO it's excellent.

That is strange.  It worked on my machine.  Perhaps, (I haven't

OK, I am assuming that you need a working linux to be able to use
this Image?  If the SLS boot disk is already in linux format, how
does one substitute the Image.UltraStor for the zImage already on
there?  I would just create the disk from my linux box, but I have
had to overrun linux's partition on my box with other things.

Any info would be greatly appreciated.

Chris

Probably more than that.
Hmm define "developement".
Do people that test the real ALPHA releases and report INFORMED bugs back
to the maintainer (probably with patches!) count?  If so, I would guestimate
this value rises to over 10% of the active Linux community.  Try reading some
of the mail lists!  Ignore c.o.l.* groups - these are designed to be for
"users" as opposed to developers.

Not very competent.  Hmm.  Try talking to Linus, Drew, H.J.Lu et al.  You
might find the reality slightly different.

No argument here :-)

ha!  These people are normally more *developement* peoplt than you would
believe.  Although not front-line people (such as those named above), they
tend to know what they are doing, work out where prblems are, and mail
the results of their investigation back to the primary authors.
*THIS* is how a distributed developement environment such as Linux is *meant*
to work!

What you complain about is a *feature* of how Linus has been developed, and
has resulted in the fastest explosion in software technology in a long time.

"Opposition" (note the quotes) such as BSD386 had a better starting point
being based on NET-2 from UCB, but can not be said to have developed as fast
as Linux (no slur intended on B.Jolitz - assuming I have his name right!)

I object to this.  Peter has done an EXCELLENT job of bringing Linux to
the masses.  Yes, he do charge for distributions, bit all his work as also
available FREE by FTP!

IMHO, Linux would not be as wide spread if it were not for Peter.  In the past
we had the MCC distribution (which I started with).  Then SLS came along and
created something 20 times larger, but was a *complete* setup.  You could take
SLS and have a working Unix.

This is *good*.  And also since Peter compiled most things himself to make sure
they worked, he can hardly be considered a Sheep!  Sheesh, take someone that
takes a lot of other peoples work, makes something useable to the average
abuser, and tries to make money out of it, and they get flamed?  Ha!
Peter should be commended for forcing a structure on Linux, that (be it good
or bad) has helped Linux become the useful system it has.

Lovely figure this 88.9%.  Yes, a lot of people DO just have Linux to look
at, and then return to DOS for "useful" work (I occaisionally do this, and
I am a Unix professional!) but these are not SHEEP.  These are *users*.
You might as well call someone who buys a commercial system a sheep.  By your
implied definition, anyone who relies

I do both.  The tools for the job, remember.  The environemnt I work in
*encourages* generic working (vi and nroff -me), yet at times I use
DOS simply because it is better.

: I don't use Windoze for anything at all.

Yeah, I'll agree with that :-)  Same way, I use X-windows simply for multiple
X-terms.

Ah, small problem here.  Just because code is not placed on FTP sites,
does NOT mean code is being devloped.

Have you ever read any of the Linux mailing lists?  Some code (eg GCC
and the KERNEL) go through lots of revisions before they appear in
publicly accessable FTP areas.

: >I explained the points mentioned in the checklist in that post, and

I am a Linux user in "the know".  I am a Unix professional that has tracked
Linux developement since 0.11.   Linux is now more stable than some commercial
Unix systems I am forced to run, and sure as hell is developing faster than
anything else I can think of!

: >be extinct in a mmater of a few years, due of course to the new unix:
: >NT. 

No.  NT is *not* Unix.  Gates tries to claim this as part of his FUD scheme.
However, Unix *will* lose a lot of potential users through NT.  These are the
ones who follow the developement path:
  DOS -> Windows -> NT

No one I know of, and no one would move from Unix to NT.  And I would not
recommend this path to anyone.  Yes, NT could easily be an excellent successor
to Windows, but a Unix replacement it is not.

: Perhaps.  But as an alternative to Unix, not as a replacement of Unix.  After

No doubt about it.  NT is not a REPLACEMENT for Unix.  If it is markedted
solely in this basis it will flop.  No, NT is going to be a hit simply
as part of the upgrade path I mentioned above.

: >In a few years, unix will be mentioned only in history books,
: >and X11 will be seen only working as a subsystem under NT.

Now this is a laugh!  X11 is the ONLY cross platform system that can perform
the sort of operations required in a distributed multi-vendor environment.
No doubt NT will have X11 support in it eventually simple when Gates realises
that there is a large part of the world not Microsoft controlled that people
want to talk to.  Hell, even OS2/2.1 has X11 support in it!

Now, viewed from a NT point of view, yes X11 would be considered a Sub-system,
but from other vendors point of view, it would simple be NT has X11
compatibility.

: >Now you see how reasonable a guy I am?

Huh?  Reasonable?  You have quoted unconfirmed subjective figures.
I like to think *I* am reasonable (after all, I DO use DOS, I DO have
Windows 3.1, I DO own WIndows developement programs), and think I can
give a reasonable analysis of the market place.  Unix is not dead.  NT will
not kill Unix.  Linux users are not the fanatics you make them out to be.

: >What a joke! Linux 1.0 was supposed to be released last summer. 

That was a hope.  However, Linux developement then entered ANOTHER spurt
(eg ELF support!, New NET drivers etc etc etc) that meant that a STABLE
system was not feasible at the time.
Personally, I feel the "call this release 1.0" is as valid as anything else.
After all, I'm sure this is what commercial vendors do :-)

Peter jumped the gun with SLS 1.0, but this was a valid mistake.  After all
Linus had said it was due soon :-)

Release numbers are meaningless.  Remember that, and you are happy.
After all Sunos 4.0 4.1 4.1.1 4.1.2 4.1.3 are all the same OS, but with
added features/bug fixes.  with Linux you have the same effect but accelerated
manyfold

[ cut a load of meaningless waffle regarding a specific feature ]

: >Of course
: >some sheep would say you can enable that by recompiling the kernel.
: >That's loadable alright! Heh.

: Nope.  If it makes it in the standard distribution, then recompiling the
: kernel won't be necessary.

It is as loable as SunOS 4.1.1 for example.  say I wanted to add a new
feature to the kernel, I add new .o files, modify a few files and recompile.
The difference between SunOS and Linux is that the WHOLE of Linux is in source
form, whereas 99% of SUnoS 4.1.1 is in .o form.  Hmm.

: >WABI is the BIGGEST LIE PERPETRATED ON LINUX USERS!, 

Sun "WABI" or Linux "Wine" ?  Get the names right.
I *know* users who claim that Sun WABI on an IPC is as fast as Windows on a
486/66.

Linux "Wine"?  Give it a chance!

Anyway, you want Windows software, use Windows!  The right tools......

(Hmm, I don't actually *use* windows, except for my Faxmodem where I
got Winfax Lite with it....)

: Got news for you, but most people doing development work on Linux don't
: give a shit about SLS.  Why?  Because most of them are bright enough to

Not quite.  SLS did help make a standard that a lot of developers will
try and stick with.  OK, some versions of SLS are messy (I still can't
believe seeing different versions of the same program in /etc /bin and /usr/bin)

Morons like the main person I quoted (who I left nameless) out to realise that
no one is forcing Linux on anyone.

Linus is simply a GREAT unix system that is freely available with minimal
restrictions.  Other people have taken this and made distributions,a nd
tried to make a living out of it.  It you don't like this, then sod off back
to your Windoze system and play your games.

For us developers and professionals Linux is a wonderful arena to experiment
and create something worthwhile at the same time.  It has no pretense of
being applicable in the read world, but simply because of how good a system
it is, people are using it as such.

I'm afraid I must take issue with this; Peter is *not* a blood sucker - 
he provides a real service in making SLS (have you tried making your
own distribution from scratch?)  He also makes CD-ROMs of SLS.  He also
*contributes*code*!  Read your linux history.  :-) 

Peter, I'd just like to take this opportunity to thank you.
        -Kurt, who used SLS before he became comfortable "rolling his own".

(P.S.  Thanks also to Linus, Lars, Matt, Eric, Drew, HJ, Owen, Micheal, Howlin
Bob, etc., etc., etc.!)
