That is not multiuser.  Networking serving is not multiuser.   And client-
server is not multiuser either, it is a networking sub-service.

Multiuser is the ability of many people to log into and use a single
computer and all it's resources simultaneously and while retaining separate
identity.  NT cannot to that.

And coal has the internal mechanisms to become a diamond, but coal is not
a diamond.  telnetd added to NT does not a multiuser OS make.

Then it is not multiuser.  And what about file ownerships and security and
activity logging, and etc....

This has been discussed before.  It is not currently available.

You might want to get another hard drive instead, unless you really want
to slow down your system and possibly make it less stable by having the OS
compress files.

Actually they never quite got this to work correctly, so a couple of
Hippie Computer guru's in Santa Cruz, CA got together and bought into
Xenix with exclusive distribution rights, and worked all the bugs out of
the Microsoft code.  Can you say SCO?

This becomes increasingly difficult as more code is written.  They (MS)
cannot afford to break compatability with older releases of their own,
and if they DO people just plain won't buy it.  Just as DOS 6 brought a
lot of people over, and then took them right back to DOS 5, Even a
percieved problem in this industry could cost millions.  The more
the interface gets cloned the more they lose their distinction too.  MS
may have to come up with something inovative here.

        Naw, let's generalize further: there is nothing on a computer
which is not an interpreter.  Right down to the CPU, which a friend of
mine pointed out is just an interpreter implemented in hardware.  And
there is no difference between an interpreter and a compiler.  A
compiler just creates another source file, to be interpreted by the
operating system and the machine!

        Sorry, it's a waste of bandwidth on a Linux group, but I had
to carry this to its logical conclusion...

I've been trying to ignore this thread in both the NT groups and the 
Linux groups, but with all the misinformation beeing spread by both sides
of the group, I'm begining to get the feeling that nobody posting on this
thread has ever looked at either operating system..

To set matters straight; _NT_ is a multi-user operating system in that NT 
allows for multiple processes to be run by different owning users at the 
same time. Access to shared resources such as files can be controlled through
the use of ACLS.

NT 3.1 does not provide any applications to allow a remote user to 'login' 
and execute arbritrary programs. In addition, there is no documented API
for obtaining a token to allow a process to act as a different user (setuid
and friends). mail complaints to postmaster@FTC.gov

In a nutshell, NT is a true multi-user  operating system, but at present
there's no real way of making use of that fact apart from logging on and
off.

        Hey, would it be difficult to add a feature to the kernel
whereby gunzip is automatically called on any compressed file when
access to it is requested (and gzip called when it's time to write?)
This would amount to on-the-fly compression (although one had better
be sure to have a working and uncompressed version of g[un]zip --
perhaps it could be included in the kernel itself, or something?)

        Just a thought...

I don't mean to continue my public teasings, but I feel that I must stick my
nose into this thread and that this would be a good time to take a minute to 
explain my reasons and goals for the Debian release (which, I promise, will be
out ANY DAY NOW :)  Anyway, read on...

My feeling is that every other component of Linux has been developed
openly and unselfishly.  Why should a distribution (or release or whatever
you want to call it) be developed any differently?  It is my intention that
the Debian distribution be developed by it's users, not by me solely.  I offer
myself as the organizer and the coordinator of the effort.  When Debian is
finally made publically available I invite others to not only use it but
to help develop it as well.  Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe this to be
the way to make the distribution the best that it can possible be.

What follows is what I have so far and what I still need (and am looking for
people to contribute).  Please be warned that there are several things still
missing.  This is certainly not yet a system for newbies, but I hope to make
it suitable for anyone to use soon.  But I need your help.

Ok, here's what I have so far (and what will be uploaded within the next few
days as Debian 0.01 ALPHA):

        o A great installation procedure.  More advanced users may install
          the distribution from the shell while newbies may prefer to use
          the menu-driven installation interface.  Instead of re-inventing the
          wheel I am using the StopALOP package maintenance facility from
          Dr. Greg W. Wettstein (with several modifications).  Along with
          StopALOP there are several shell-script frontends written by
          myself that interact with the PSC menu system in an attempt to
          be as user-friendly as possible.  The installation procedure
          allows for easy installation and removal of packages, viewing of
          installed packages and their contents, and the tracking of package
          versions.  The installation also discloses the size of the package
          and disk space left before installation, for convenience's sake. 

        o Built-in upgradability.  Using the easy removal and version tracking
          features of the installation procedure, upgrade packages can easily
          be applied to the system.  By "knowing" about previous versions of
          a Debian package the package *itself* first checks for the existence
          of one of the previous versions on the system, and if found removes it
          first before installation.  This is accomplished by a "pre-install
          script" that is a part of the upgrade package.  This "pre-install
          script" is just one of the many reasons I decided on the StopALOP
          package maintenance facility.  Thanks, Dr. Wettstein! :)

        o Packages are grouped around the "original" packages for easier
          version tracking.  In other words, Debian contains a fileutil.tgz
          package, a perl.tgz package, a shellutil.tgz package, etc. (all from
          the GNU archives) which each "know" which version they are.  In
          other words, when you ask StopALOP to list which packages are
          installed it will tell you:
                fileutil (GNU fileutils 3.6)
                perl (Perl 4.036)
                shellutil (GNU shellutils 1.8)

           and so on.  Once again, thanks to Dr. Wettstein.

        o Relevant FAQs and other helpful documents will be included, and for
          newbies these can be viewed from a menu system.  Hopefully this
          will cut down on some of the noise in c.o.l.* :)

        o An extremely lean, clean and mean system.  Since I started from
          absolute scratch and have paid very careful attention to making
          sure junk doesn't accumulate anywhere (take a look at SLS's /etc
          if you don't know what I mean :).  You wouldn't believe the amount
          of disk space saved by careful custodial checks. 

Here's what is missing, why it is missing, and what I'd like to find more
help with:

        o There is no X11 system on Debian, yet.  I am waiting for XFree86 2.0.

        o UUCP/mail/news.  I know absolutely nothing about this stuff.  Anyone
          want to be in charge of this? :)

        o Networking.  Everything to get it to *work* should be in the
          distribution, but I have no way of knowing as currently I am on a
          standalone system.  I'm a poor college student; gimme a break! :)

        o SUBSTITUTE ANYTHING ELSE HERE!  I want this distribution to improve,
          not simply keep up and spin the tires.  Suggestions are always
          welcome!

Is anyone else interested?  I'm willing to do just about anything to make this
work.  I will always be open to suggestions and if you feel up to contributing
let me know!  I will try to answer my mail, start a mailing list, whatever.
It all depends on the level of interest there is in this project.

One final feature that I'd like to point out is that I have kept the non-netter
in mind as I have put the distribution together thus far.  I plan on
distributing Debian by mail and providing product support to this crowd.  I
want to at least minimize the disadvantage that they have, and I believe the
upgrades will be a start.  Please forward any suggestions on this matter to
me so that we can share our jewel of an OS with the rest of the world one
of these days.

I certainly feel the same way, and I hope that everyone else is willing to
help me out.  If not, well, constructing Debian has certainly been a wonderful
learning experience.
