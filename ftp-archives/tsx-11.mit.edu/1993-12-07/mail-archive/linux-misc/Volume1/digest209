I think Mark is right -- there's no way that Island is going to port
their products to Linux.  There isn't even an "offical" release of
Linux to which a port could be done.  I develop software for a living,
and hitting a moving target is hard enough, but with Linux, there's no
target at all.  Don't get me wrong -- I think Linux is a great idea,
and as soon as my SCSI controller and drive arrive, I'm going to give
it a try!

Why would a marketeer (they're the ones who decide such things) think
that a large number (and I mean thousands) of Linux users would be
willing to pay several hundred dollars for a word processor?  Linux
users as a group appear to be people who will go to great trouble to
avoid paying dollar number one for software.  (Nothing wrong with
that, but let's face it -- the main reason alot of people have Linux
instead of SCO or Interactive is Linux is FREE.)

There is always more work than resources, and I doubt that the Linux
market looks good enough to invest ten's of thousands of dollars to
port a product.

Definitely!  COFF/iBSC is the way to go.  Compatiblity will mean

W/P/D or WP or 123 or whatever.

        An OS that is not easy to install and not easy to use simply 
        stands a much smaller chance of being widely accepted.  It 
        is really no wonder that Microsoft dominates the software 
        industry.  If the more powerful OS's are also a great deal more
        trouble for the average user, well, you can guess which one 
        they'll choose.  

        The unfriendly attitude that newcomers sometimes encounter serves 
        only to make Microsoft richer.  Are Unix type OS's inherently 
        difficult for programming user-friendly interfaces?  I think not. 
        So why the dominance of dos and ms-windows?  The answer is the 
        lack of user friendly interfaces for Unix systems.  This is an 
        issue that has been beat to death by the Society for Technical 
        Communication.  

        The question is: Do you want people to use Linux or not?  Free 
        software serves to help break the stranglehold that a few 
        companies have developed in the software industry, but only when 
        that free software can be used.  If Joe Average (dos user) can't 
        use Linux, for whatever reason, and dos/ms-windows comes 
        pre-installed on his new PC, do you think he'll tolerate a mountain 
        of trouble to run Linux, including insults?

   My question is: Does anyone have experience with porting a large,
   numerically intensive, FORTRAN application to Linux, using the f2c/gcc
   tandem or g77? Do you consider it practical (i.e can you USE it) or did
   you find it was just "spielerei"? Can you share some of the problems
   you had compiling the application? (I can think of problems like having
   to link system dependent CPU timing or memory management routines in C
   to the package, or problems with compiling COMMON blocks, or problems
   with running the HUGE package on Linux which became only apparent after
   this large application was built, etc. etc.)


I have been using Linux for about 8 months now to do some rather
involved numerical computations (but not so involved that they couldn't be
done on a 486 :-). I have had occasion to use many of the public
domain F77-based numerical packages, including lsode, eispack and
slatec. Although I typically write my code in C and link it to the
f2c-translated routines, there is no reason why I couldn't (and many
reasons why I should) just write everything in Fortran, and let f2c do
all the work.

I have yet to find a single problem that I cannot attribute to my own
stupidity. With that in mind, I would say one of the biggest problems
was that, initially, I was more willing to ascribe errors in programs
I had written to the operating system rather than myself. At one point
I actually filed a bug report on libc about core dumps in printf().
As it turned out, the code was bad; I was writing to unallocated
memory, and Linux was doing the Right Thing: dumping core.  Something,
incidentally, that SunOS did *not* do. It happily let me scribble on
memory and spit out garbage that it claimed was the answer.

I did actually run into some fortran that f2c couldn't handle. In
particular, some of the test driver routines for some of the BLAS
packages made f2c ill. As I recall, they used some non-standard
extensions (I think I reported this to the f2c maintainers and that's
what they said. If anybody's interested, I can root around in my mail
archives, and send it along). However, for anything that I've actually
had to use (including the entire SLATEC library) f2c has worked like a
champ.

ooOOOoo.

A Linux At Large squad anyone?

If you'd be willing to get on a team with me, send me mail.
Decent C++ programmers only please, there's no room for "um
what's a pointer?" in a 3- person squad.

(My qualifications to lead this squad: I'm the author of the
Internet C tutorial. Of course I'm a bum since it's been a long
time since the 5th chapter, but moving across the continent
had something to do with that. (: It won't be easy for me to
afford to get there if we win, but one problem at a time!)

        This is kind of like beating a child to stop him from peeing in his
pants.  The desired result is almost never achieved, but you are more likely to
end up with a maladjusted child that will run away and/or beat his own
children when he grows up.

        If the subtlety of that metaphor is beyond some people, then I suggest
that all you accomplish by flaming the hell out of new users is to drive them
away from linux and towards some commercial platform with friendly customer
support and in the process create an enemy for life.  Either that, or they will
eventually grow up to be experienced users who will flame the hell out of the
next generation of new users.  We do not need any of this.

        Instead of flaming the new user, why not just send a polite note
telling them to consult the FAQ or read the manual.  Even better, why not just
answer the damn question at the same time.  You will make a friend for yourself
and for linux.  This does of course assume that you wish to have friends.  If
the new user flames you back, just ignore it.

        It is most unfortunate that some users choose to exercise their rights
to free speech in such a harsh manner - if this were commercial software then
employees who berate customers in such ways would be fired.  Unfortunately this
is USENET, and anyone can say more or less anything they want.  New users need
to realize that there are a few people who will say unkind things, and they
should try and ignore flames like this and try to keep it all in perspective.

        I should add in passing that I do not condone new users asking FAQ in
the non-c.o.l.help newsgroups, but this in no way excuses flaming them for
their ignorance.

Yes, according to the first drafts of the Linux Activists FSSTND channel
and it makes /etc much more managable as I found out after moving the
binaries from /etc to /sbin (my /etc fits on one screen with `ls' now :-).

The metaphor is only occasionally accurate.  I have no data to back
this up other than my own experience, but Linux users seem to be
considerably less appreciation of the cause than, say, FSF folks.
Linux, and other more public-domain-type-software, seems to cultivate
a mean spirited, selfish kind of laziness.

I confess I'd be more likely to post to a GNU newsgroup, send the FSF
donations, etc. because I sense greater stability there, and an
awareness it costs money to make software.
