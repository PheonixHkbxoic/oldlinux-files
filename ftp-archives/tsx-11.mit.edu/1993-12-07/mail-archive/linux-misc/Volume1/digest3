Second...  Make sure term is installed where you can get at it on the

export DISPLAY=`hostname``txconn`

or csh:

setenv DISPLAY `hostname``txconn`

Now you can run X11 programs on your home machine (oh, BTW, be sure that your
running X through this whole mess, or else).  Enjoy!

Hi Folks:

I am very interested in putting Linux on my system.  However, I need to
use PPP to access the systems at work.  Does anyone know whether there
is a port of PPP to Linux available?  I know SLIP and CSLIP are available,
but that won't do at present...

It even needs not to run on the same machines - you can use xscope or
similar redirectors, but this is for advanced users...

This procedure fails in the cases where txconn picks a different
diplay number (e.g. if another txconn is already running).

> setenv DISPLAY `hostname``txconn`

That's the right way. The tricky point is where exactly you run this -
newbies tend to get confused by the different possibilities of using
tredir and txconn. To make it clear: txconn is run on the X client
side, i.e. where the X programs run, NOT on the server side, i.e.
where the display is.

You then have following setup:

school                                   home
======                                   ======
X clients                                X server :0.0
DISPLAY=:9.0
tredir mapping :9.0 to (other):0.0

Of course, the usual setup runs the other way round, but that is
unimportant. term is symmetric.

Parcplace gave out some free copies of a Linux port of its ObjectBuilder(tm)
platform as a promotion...  The commercial future of this port hasn't 
been announced.  

Also the announcement of a  Linux port for a commercial package named "wit" 
from a company called Logical Vision just crossed my desk.  It is a 
"Object Oriented dataflow imaging development system" and a demo version
will be available on sunsite soon.  This is something I encourage all
potential Linux vendors to do- for more information on what's neccesary
to upload a demo copy of a commercial package, contact me.

I've never tried this. However I do have suggestions:
1) set your display variable to homemachine:9 (or whatever txconn gives back)
2) do a xhost +schoolmachine on the display machine.
3) Run txconn on your home machine, not you school machine.

Since the term server that's connecting to the display machine is the school
machine, the school machine is the one that needs to be xhosted.

Hope this helps, Like I said I've never tried this before.

Wow!  !woW   Linux!

I just installed the SLACKWARE 1.01 release (current as of Aug.11/93)
and it seems very solid.  Thanks to whoever pieces this together!

For the record, here are some corrections needed to the SLACKWARE distribution:

1. The install script (early on) lists choices 1/2/3 for an item,
        and then asks the user to enter (1 or 2), rather than (1/2/3).

2. The xboard binary is missing, though the manpage is present.

3. There is no such file as /etc/sampleuseradd, despite what install says.

4. Missing manpage for zcat.1.

5. BIGGIE:  the /usr/man/whatis contains only info for X, and nothing
        for the regular /usr/bin;/bin programs.  To fix this, get man.tgz from
        the SLS 1.01 b1 diskette, and append its whatis file to /usr/man/whatis.
        While you're there, grab the zcat.1 manpage as well.

6. The .dvi (or source) for the dosemu049 documentation is missing.

That's all I remember for now, though I did do lots of other cleanups
and additions after the basic install.

Subject: selection 1.5 design flaw
Date: Mon, 16 Aug 93 14:45:36 GMT

A word or two about the selection 1.5 add-on for linux (text mode cut/paste).

The default cut/paste buffer size is 2048, about twice as big as it can ever
actually handle.  This is due to the TTY_BUF_SIZE in the kernel being defined
as 1024 (and not easily increased), which limits the maximum paste operation
to that many (roughly 1024) bytes.  One might as well save a bit of memory
and reduce the cut/paste buffer to about 1024 as well, or even define it to
be the same as TTY_BUF_SIZE.

However, I'd really like to find a way to work around the TTY_BUF limitation,
so that I can do cut/paste of full screens in extended VGA mode (up to 4K).

Has anyone else already looked at this?

Some clarification is needed here. Where do you set the DISPLAY variable?
Where do you run txconn? Kinda important because running it in the wrong
place won't work.

Why. If the display variable is set and the X libraries are available why
do you need to run X itself on the home machine. An X server only needs
to run on the display machine. Right?

Now from that I understand there are three machines involved:

   homemachine: running linux and term. Connected via term to the...
 schoolmachine: running term. Connected via the network to the
displaymachine: Running X server. Where we want the picture to go.

Is this right? I've done this with the homemachine and the displaymachine
reversed. So I'm just reversing my steps. Also I'm assuming that term is
running on both the homemachine and the schoolmachine.

3) Run txconn on your home machine, not you school machine.

This should be done first ;-)

>1) set your display variable to homemachine:9 (or whatever txconn gives back)

I didn't clarify myself. The display environment variable should be set on the
homemachine.

I believe the original poster wants to fire up a X application from
his Linux box and display it on someone else's display on the network.
Actually, this is an interesting concept.

for linux. I have heard that some people have ported NNTP, but no one has
presented it as a completed package on the linmux archives. I don't have
the sources to NNTP and don't really have the time or desire to port it.

Anyone have a solution? It sure would be nice to use that mouse.

More than likely your root entry in fstab is messed up.  Some versions
of SLS 1.03 glitched on the install, and make an entry for "/root"
instead of "/".  You should fix the /etc/fstab file by hand, reboot,
and most of your problems should go away.

More explicitly, the entry should look something like:
/dev/hda2       /       ext2    defaults

   I run term.

   I connect My home machine via modem to my school machine.

   I would like to run an X program on my HOME machine, to display on a
   machine that is not my school machine.

   Any suggestions?


Here is how to do it (I know this works, I do it every day). I mailed
this to Philip, but there seem to be a little too much hot air in this
thread, so I'm posting this to clear things up a bit. The short answer
is that X uses port 6000 + <DISPLAY NUMBER> for its communications,
so you should use tredir appropriately. Below is an example of how to
do this.

$ tredir 6002 remote.machine.name:6000
$ export DISPLAY=local.machine.name:2
(or for csh types ``% setenv DISPLAY local.machine.name:2'')
$ xapplication

The ``2'' in ``6002'' and the screen number of the DISPLAY variable is
arbitrary, but they must both be the same. You can set it to whatever
you want, and in fact have several tredir's running which redirect to
different machines using different (local) screen numbers.

Also, make sure that you've got an xhost on the remote machine which
allows access from the *net connected machine that you run term from*,
i.e.

local.machine <------> net.machine <---------> remote.machine
               term                 network
                                                ^

I'm a linux newbie who also started out with the MCC distribution, and I
have nothing but good things to say about it.  I actually tried out both
SLS and MCC (I had plenty of disks and a good ftp connection to the net),
and I found MCC to be much easier to deal with.  A lot of that probably
came from the docs (MCC's docs are very good), but it also seems to me
that MCC installation scheme is laid out a little bit more logically than
SLS's.

The main reason that I chose MCC is that I'm running linux on a very
minimal installation (366sx, 4mb ram, 40mb hard disk), and it seemed to be
easier to figure out how to intall the stuff I need and leave out the rest.

The biggest problem with MCC, IMHO, is that there is a lot of stuff that's
left out.  If you're really a newbie, as I am, it's kind of hard to figure
out how to set up things like printer daemons and mail systems (I haven't
even been able to get a local mail system running).  This is not a problem
with MCC, per se:  the distribution isn't supposed to be all things to all
people, and it's designed to allow other people to be able to add modules
that can easily be installed.

I think it would be very helpful (although probably sort of time
consuming) if people who are knowledgeable enough could put together taz
files in the MCC format that would install things like addueser routines,
mail systems, and the like on basic MCC machines.  There are only a
handful of packages that would be needed to bring MCC up to parity with
SLS in terms of the power of the resulting installation.

I doubt that will happen, but it would be nice.

The only trouble I had (and not being a complete newbie I could figure out
what to do about it - but it was more work than SLS) is that with MCC you
don't get everything you need (e.g. XFree86) conveniently divided up into
separate floppies.  A nice thing with SLS is that to make the floppies you
just cd to a directory (e.g. x1), ftp everything on to the floppy, change
floppies, cd to the next directory, ftp everything, and so on.

Subject: revision in SLIP installation instructions for pl12
Date: 16 Aug 93 18:03:40 GMT

For those who have used my instructions to install SLIP, a slight
change is needed for pl12.  I advise you to do

  /etc/route add default 1.2.3.4

where 1.2.3.4 is the address of the server you're connected to.
The route command distributed with Linux doesn't like this syntax.
The correct command is

  /etc/route add default gw 1.2.3.4

I'm not sure quite why this worked under earlier releases.
