   WHat port? just tgrab sources, and compile...

However, this will not result in a tcl that will pass all the
regression tests, at least with extended TCL.  It's a little more
tricky than that.

I'm going to upload my ALPHA version of shared libraries for extended
tk/tcl 3.3/7.0 on Wednesday.  This is solely for evaluation and
comment.  I've done a number of controversial things, especially
involving the shared library tables, so I would appreciate public
feedback on what you think I've done wrong. :-)

(I'm not going to make the same mistake I did with the 3.2/6.7 release;
the archive will be removed from the archive within a week or so.)

You're lucky!
Anyone using the Internet in Germany for commercial purpose,
that means, mentioning your Email-address on your business-papers
have to pay to the "German EUnet":

Base                             :  $ 30,= per month
NetNews                          :  $ 37,= per month
Email                            :  $ 15,= per month
national Traffic (no limit)      :  $148,= per month
international Traffic (20 MB)    :  $168,= per month
my local Slip Provider           :  $152,= per month (14.4KBPS Line 24h)
my phone-company                 :  $418,= per month (10h/day line usage)
                            ------------------
Total:                              $968,= per month

What do you say now?! In Germany the only provider of commercial
Internet use is the EUnet GmbH in Dortmund.
There are other providers but they restrict their service to
educational or private use.
That's the reason why only big companies or Universities have 
Intenet-Access here in Germany (We're the only small one :-)).

I had a lot of trouble with the runtime-then-selectively-install.
Then I switched to the CD-rom-dependent installation, remade the tree
so that utilities I know I use often are on the hard disk.
Also, when a program complain it can't write to the cd-rom I move
the offending directory to the hard disk. (I had to do this for metafont.)

This work a lot better.

The keymaps do not work well, Slackware is better for this.
Emacs do not accept movement by arrows.

Storing the sources expanded on the CD-rom is stupid me thinks,
especially since I could not compile emacs with the sources on the
CD-rom.
I measured how much space the sources would need when tarred and
gzipped. 98 Mbyte compared to 422 expanded. (the latter with du
but the manual seem to confirm this)

I would be much happier with compressed source.
Also, if the sources were compressed, maybe essential games like
fortune, atc and nethack would fit too. And utilities like unzip.

I have not been able to connect to yggdrasil.com to get help so the
comment about making the /usr/spool/mail directory world writable
helped me. (Thanks!)

Things that did work well with cd-dependent are:
lpr
X (mostly)
TeX

Conclusion: Stay clear of the run-time installation if you can.

The following is copied from the minicom Install file:

The Linux console only maps 1-to-1 in a special mode. Therefore you need to
make a special termcap entry in /etc/termcap that initializes the
console on startup:

mc|minicom|mc80x25|termcap entry for minicom on the console:\
        :is=\E(U\E[m\E>\E[4;20l:\E[?8;25h\E[?1;5;6;7l:\
        :rs=\E(B\E[m\E>\E[4;20l:\E[?7;8;25h\E[?1;5;6l:\
        :bc=:as=:ae=:am=:vb=\E(B\007\E(U:\
        :tc=console:

To use this information instead of the normal 'console' information,
minicom has to be invoked with the '-t mc' option (meaning use TERM=mc
instead of the normal TERM environment variable).

And, in my /etc/profile I have added the lines:

        if [ "$TERM" = console ]
        then
                MINICOM="-l -con -tmc" ; export MINICOM
        fi

So when I log in on the console I can use minicom in full color full
ANSI mode to call all kinds of BBS's and the like!

Hello World,
        I am also looking at the tcl, tk business, and would like to know if
the sharable libraries for these versions are going to become available. I
got the version posted to Sunsite etc, but could never manage to create
the sharable libraries as suggested possible in the Makefile.
        I think this would be a godsend platform for tcl/tk learning and
development, and would really LOVE to see a fully functioning version on 
my Linux box. For the sheer hell of it, anyone making tclX and xf go in
this environment would get a loud cheer from me.
        If tcl/tk is going to become popular, Linux is really going to be
important. I think a little FAQ on how to get the whole suite of things up
would be useful, but I dont't feel I have the expertise to so this myself.
Hey, I am trying to learn tcl/tk/tclX and xf on Linux, and have run into so
many brick walls on the compile side that I have lost steam.

any comments via news or email welcome..

Okay... here's the story...  For my last two years of high school,
I attended the Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science
(MSMS.DoE.k12.MS.US), which is a public residential high school
located in Columbus, MS, for "academicly gifted" students.  (But
obviously took those who couldn't spell, either.)  MSMS obviously
stresses mathematics and science, but also has a strong computer
department, and maintains a campus-wide ethernet connecting
the academic building, an office building, and both of the
residence halls.  10-BASE-T ethernet connections were availble
for students in their rooms, and the school leased PC ethernet cards.
The campus ethernet was connected to the Internet via a 56kbps link
and router, and a Sun SparcStation 2 was used as the main server
for mail, etc.  I discovered Linux near the end of my junior year
at MSMS, and throughout my senior year, another guy and myself
worked towards studying Linux and integrating it into our network.
Linux became very appealing to students because they could run
applications like "Interleaf" on the Sparc 2, and set the display
to their local PC.  Also, with Unix on their PC that was directly
connetced to the Internet, friends from outside could connect to
their PCs.

My senior year at MSMS, I was pretty much responsible for the
system administration of the Sparc 2, and I also did research in
computer engineering at the nearby Mississippi State University,
so when I graduated from MSMS this past May, I was able to land a
job here at the MSU Electrical and Computer Engineering Dept. as a
system administrator.  Meanwhile, at MSMS, Linux continues to
increase in popularity.

Well, sorry I took up so much bandwidth with this message...
Later guys.

   Kernel recompiling is fairly easy:

$ cd /usr/src/linux
$ make zImage

   and that's all. Perhaps you'll need a previous make config and answer
the questions (with default options), a make depend and a make clean, but
it's not that complicated. Are you telling us that you use a *BIG* kernel
with lots of features you don't need just because you don't want to spend
half an hour compiling the kernel? (Don't worry, I did the same first time
but everybody has to learn 8-)

   Slackware is far better than SLS, more complete, up to date, less bugs
and best of all, as someone said, Pat knows what the 'r' key of the mail

Well, you need 2 or 3 computers (obviously) that are Linux-capable,
meaning at least 386s with at least 4MB of Ram, preferably.  You
need ethernet cards in each of the computers, and some ethernet
cable, some T-connecters, and a couple of terminators.
That's about it.  I've done the same thing in the dorm here, so if
you have any questions, I'd be glad to help you out.

Why would there be an age restriction on FTP?  That's pretty weird...
If there's any wqay that I can help you out in getting Linux,
let me know.  Maybe I could send it to you, and you could compensate
me for the disks or something...
let me know,

I've been feeling negative about SLS:  I installed it on my system
when it was at 1.02.  I spent the first few weeks upgrading things to
current versions (ext2fs, term, emacs, gcc, libs, xfree, ...).  When I
got done, my system was taking up quite a bit of space:  Most of my
200 meg hard drive was full.  "Oh well," I thought, "Linux is just
big."  But then I installed the MCC distribution for a friend of mine.
I put it plus Xfree-1.3 in a 23meg partition.  He's got breathing
room.  Before the week is out, I plan to be reinstalled using this
system instead.  (MCC+Xfree 2.0)  Granted, mine won't fit in 23 megs
since I'll have Emacs, the libs and includes to do X compiling, etc.,
but it's bound to be smaller than SLS.  I took Linux over to Ben's
house on 4 diskettes (3x3.5HD+1x5.25HD), SLS came to my house on more
than 20 disks!

I'm pretty sure that Slackware offers a pretty good system.  The
vapourware Debian is supposed to have an extremely good system for
this, but I've never seen it in action.

I don't have any personal expiriences with any CDROM distribution.  I
have some secondhand expirience.  A friend was very frustrated for
some time with the Yggdrasil distribution.  Before he got it to work,
he'd bought a new hard drive, a new SCSI controller, a new CD-ROM, 4
more megabytes memory, ... .  I would stay away from the SLS CDROM
because I don't like the 'bloat' of SLS.  I've seen mention of the
'Jana CD,' but I don't know too much about it as I don't have a
CDROM.

Probably not.  I spent less than 15 minutes getting the tinyX Xfree to
look pretty much like I was used to.  While I still haven't got a
1024x768I resolution to work, it's very usable.  I've found both tinyX
and a 'virgin' Xfree distribution to run pretty much out of the box.

I don't know about the stability of the distributions.  I tend to be
more afraid of SLS, since it often gets complaints in public forums
like here.  (IE this or that is *SOO* outdated, or is some sort of
security problem, or whatever.)  I haven't heard of any of this
getting fixed.  And when SLS isn't behind, it's dumb.  It once had the
(never official) 4.4.2 libs distributed with it, and I think it once
had an alpha kernel (in the /usr/src directory, I guess.) instead of a
tested one.  Scary.  My rule of thumb is to wait about a week and then
upgrade.  SLS seems to either wait too long or way too short.  What's
alpha software doing in a public distribution?  (Especially not
'public alpha' software.  I suppose most of Linux doesn't claim to be
ready for the true 'general public.')

If you were to use something like MCC, you'd be pretty well off for
'stability.'  Since the newest version is at pl10, you'll have some
upgrading to do.  But I've found that it's complete enough, small, and
well documented.  While it lacks a package removal option,  that would
be my only complaint.  It includes full man pages on the software it
has, and has a pretty good organization between /etc, /bin, /usr/bin,
/usr/local/bin, etc.  From what you get to start with, you can add on
your own.  TinyX was easy.  New kernel, libs and ld.so were easy.  My
two complaints are that it was (initially) missing which and tcsh.  

I don't know about slackware, but it seems to be another large one.  I
think the frequent releases allow it to have recent versions of almost
all the software, but I don't know how stable it is.  I agree that the
name is perhaps not the best one to inspire faith with. :)

>Which distribution is likely to include Xfree 2.0 ahead of the others ? 

To me, this is a non-issue.  I've got the .tar.gz files of Xfree 2.0
at home, and they're just waiting for me to 'su root' and then install
them.  I'm not anticipating any problems, it worked with Xfree 1.3.

>Thanks for an answer to any of the above questions,

I'm afraid I got a little verbose... Oh well.
