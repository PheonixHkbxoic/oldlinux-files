Um, more secure is:

* keep crontab directory as it is
* crontab files should be created with the setuid bit set but the execute bit
  turned off
* crond should check for the crontab owned by the user it is for and with the
  setuid bit turned on

This takes away the need for the crontab command to be setuid anyone, but
prevents uid spoofing.  If someone creates a crontab for someone as themselves
and then chowns it to the other user (possible with System V-style chown) the
setuid bit will be turned off *and can't be turned back on except by root or
the new owner*.  System V cron/at has used this mechanism for several years;
since Vixie-cron is/was intended as a System V cron clone, it should be doing
this.

An absolutely crucial issue is whether current drivers support the video,
scsi and networking builtin to these machines.  Does anyone have any

No, but I can expect them to have read the newsgroup for a while
*before* getting themselves into this mess.  If they did so they would
have seen all the regular postings and would probably not even need to
post their question.

Then it's best done by email query as well.  After all, if the answer
isn't interesting to everybody else neither is the question.

Using the Linux newsgroups as a `free support service' while being
completely uninteresting in putting any effort in oneself is extremely
rude.  It implies undervaluing the readers' time compared to one's own
by a factor of 10 or 100.

If you do not have read access to Usenet you should not post.

I'm currently running a 386-25 with 4megs of RAM and don't have the power to
run X-Windows..  I've been running Linux for a very short period of time and
would like a GUI interface if at all possible (at least until I learn the OS
better).  I've been told about a smaller version of X called Tiny-X.  Would
this run reasonably well on my system (3.95 Bogomips)?  Where could I get a

I'm suprised you can run much with only 20 MB or memory.  I'm running 
on a 20MHz 386sx/387 with 8 MB of ram, 16MB swap partition, and
(frequently) 16 MB swap file.  So, yes the 16 MB swap
partition is usefull.  The optimum solution is 0 swap and 32MB+ real
ram (not an option on my system). 

BTW: Even as I type this, I'm compiling the latest ALPHA patch kernel
in another window to take advantage of Linus' magic big swap
partitions  ( 32Mb for starters ). 

Enjoy

With a 4mb machine, you probably wouldn't have enough patience to run
it to the point where you are using 16mb of swap.  So 4 or 8mb of swap
should be enough.  However, if you have any plans of upgrading to more
memory in the future, and your disk space isn't at a real premium, you
should consider leaving the swap partition as-is ... it will save you
the hassle of re-configuring things later when you add the memory.

On my 16mb machine, I have 16mb swap, and having used more than 4 or 5mb
of swap (that was during a point where I ran a couple of compiles of 
"major" packages simultaneously, and/or ran xv).

Subject: LGX installed with one glitch!
Date: Sun, 24 Oct 1993 19:28:00 GMT

I just got the Fall '93 LGX distribution installed, and I am very
impressed with Linux.  I installed the "complete" system (235M of
stuff).  It took about 6 hours to copy all of the files -- the manual
said it would take "the better part of an hour."  I don't know why my
CD drive was so slow, but I'm not really worried about it (Adaptec
1542C and a Sony CDU 8xxx drive).

X started up cleanly on my Hercules, but with only 4M of ram, the
performance degrades rapidly if you try do do much.  I hate to imagine
what would happen if I tried to compile something while running X.
Battlezone runs a little slow (386dx-25, no cache, 3.03 bogomips), and
my display isn't big enough, but IT RUNS!

The X based demo that comes with LGX will swap it's brains out, but it
does run.

When I exit X, the herc doesn't get set back to the correct video
mode, I'm not sure why.

There _was_ one glitch that I ran into.  The PC-Speaker device driver
locks up when you cat a .wav file into splay.

The rc.local that comes with LGX tries to play a bit of music, and at
that point things die.  The system is still running, but rc.local
never finishes.  You just hear a Bzzzt from the speaker, and never get
a login prompt.

So, I bought a MediaVision Pro Audio Spectrum 16, and now splay works
fine (any excuse to buy more toys!).

Ian, you have made some nice contributions to Linux, but you are totally

There is nothing either wrong or rude in people asking for followups via

Whichever version works best for them.  Most users could give a rip what

Because the completely free software is AS GOOD as the GNU stuff.  Good
doesn't mean more features in my opinion.  Good means it gets the job done.

Often, this mean you choose less features for less memory use, because
on Intel hardware memory is at a premium much more so than the big
mainframes.  (Ie: I have to pay for it, not the corporation/school)

>To get a comfortable

Explain what has to be replaced to get an 'environment' in more detail.

Aside from some niggly little things here and there (of which I believe
FreeBSD has integrated because the GNU version ARE much better) I don't
see anything missing in NetBSD for utilities that exist in Linux.
(kernel features aside).  As a matter of fact, I would say that *BSD
have a LOT MORE utilities available which make installing it more
difficult because you don't need all of the utilities.

A plethora of utilities isn't a bad thing unless you're dealing with
a small system.  (When I custom install a machine, I have to go through
and delete a bunch of stuff so as to get the disk space down.  This will
hopefully be fixed by the shared libraries, which are in early Alpha test)

Why?  If an application makes my life easier, should I opt for the free
version just because it's free?  I think not.  (I'm sorry boss, but
it'll take me twice as long to do this project because there isn't any
free software available that'll do the job effeciently, so I'll have to
write it first and then give it away before I can start on your task)

Obviously you aren't part of the 99.9% of the world who don't give a rip
about HOW to develop software, they just need it to do their payroll,
balance their check book, write letters to their mothers, do their
homework, etc..

Show me any software in the above categories that is simple to use and
I'll take my words back.  Show me a WP that my wife can use w/out having
to understand the intracicies of how a document should be formatted, show
me something that balances my checkbooks with a nice user interface, show
me free software that I can give away to clients who need to use it to
do all their accounting and such.

It doesn't exist, and I highly doubt that it ever will.  (We can all muse
about how nice it would be, but until that happens discouraging copyrighted
software just turns away a LARGE number of folks who will help get your
Free O.S. accepted in the main stream of computing).

Yeah, and the same guys that brought us unix, C, and most everything
that has now been replaced by 'free' versions where thoughts by folks
who wrote 'copyrighted' software.  These kind of applications paved the
way so that you could afford the cheap Intel PC that is now running all
this software.

Remember history and choose not to make the same mistakes others have made,
