Hmm...well, the Apple Lisa was out about then, and it was basically the

Nope.  Apple was "reacting" to Xerox, which did the basic research.  How
long after the Mac first appeared did Microsloth come out with Windoze?
5 years?  More?

Yes, Windoze is *definitely* in response to the Mac, which until that point
was killing the PC in the ease-of-use category, text-based WYSIWYG word
processors being rather minor players in that game.

Hello, Net users.

If there is enough interest, I would be happy to make available
(for a fee to cover costs) a DAT 4mm distribution of Linux,
386BSD/NetBSD, and GNU software. I have pulled all software directly
off of tsx-11.mit.edu, agate.berkeley.edu, and prep-ai.mit.edu.
The DAT drive which I will use for the recording is the Tecmar
DataVault. I have pulled all files as of at least August 26th, 1993,
and am pulling more as are updated. I can store the files in 
PC-Tools for Windows backup format or Unix TAR format, using the
no-rewind device.

Please leave me email if you are interested; if there is enough
interest I will repost (and mail each respondent) details.

Thanks,

Doug

That depends.  A minimal MS-Windows --- just enough to run the installer ---
is relatively small because the minimal non-GUI core functionality (which is
to say, DOS*) is already in place.  A Un*x/X installer must load a minimal
Un*x as well as a minimal X, so the initial (pre-WIMP, if you will) bootstrap
takes longer.  Look at the OS/2 2.x install for an example; it has the same
problem, it must preload the OS/2 "core" functionality as well as the PM
"core" before bringing up the GUI installer.

Have I got a bad machine, or is there a known problem with the AMD386-40 ?

Linux  is convinced I have a co-pro using exception 13 reporting, and so
a lot of maths gets confused.  Using LILO with the "no387" flag gets around
the problem, but this is a pain to remember this machine is special when
admining a potential 30 machines over 7 sites.  

Any feed back would be welcome.  Thanks.

Hi..

I'm searching for gopher and whois binaries or sources
working with Linux 99pl12 and the NET-2 package.

I have a gopher source which does not compile due to

I have a whois source which compiles but always says:

How do I fix those problems?

What about Xtexcad, which comes with SLS 1.03 on Disk X4?
It seems to be as nice as the TeXcad from emTeX. 
On the other side You can use xfig to crate pictures and transfer them
to a LaTeX-picture-environment oder to PiCTeX via fig2dev. I don't

My point was that this is the only argument that speaks for Microsoft.
So there is no inherent reason to use it. If enough people start using
something else (better) it will get a bigger acceptance and be able to
oust Microsoft.

I am not as pessimistic as you are. If enough people stick with
elegant systems, these will become the major system(s) and everyone

   Sure - it's badly designed *IN RETROSPECT*.  But just look at any of
the contemporary magazines and books when the PC came out.  It was an
absolute godsend.  IBM came up with a useable small computer that didn't
cost a heck of a lot for anyone to manufacture - thus fostering the
cheap clone market.  Sure, it looks like a horrible kludge today, but look
at what it replaced.  Personally, I would much rather use an IBM-PC than a
Northstar or an Apple II.

   First it's broken, and then it allows people to write thousands of useful

   Personally, *I* don't see how "badly broken and inferior" DOS it, and I've
been programming on PC machines for a decade.  As a small-applications
single-tasking program loader it does just fine.  And *that* is what most
people want from it.  As a large-application multitasker, it sucks rocks.
But anyone who tries to use it for that is deluding myself - and I don't
concern myself with deluded people.

   Again - WordPerfect is just fine for the majority of people.  They simply
don't use it for anything that, say, PC-Write couldn't handle.  And no - you
can run WordPerfect on a variety of platforms.

  It's the same with nearly any other consumer technology.  Automobiles could
produce far fewer combustion products if we switched to a fuel-cell or
alcohol mixture.  But we have a huge infrastructure of gas stations and
oil companies.  There are much more efficient ways of lighting our homes - or
designing light bulbs for that matter - but everyone has screw-base lamps.
Personally, I'm more concerned with the smog I breathe when I go to LA
than what OS I'm running.

   Just as in any other technology that was wonderful when it was first

   Yes, but the average businessperson doesn't care whether Unix is
expensive, because it's not an appropriate OS for a small business.  Not to
mention that Unix has far too many of its own problems. :-)

   The reason that the PC was successful was that it was cheap enough
for a small business to use.  Can you honestly say that you think *ANY*
machine with the power to run NextStep in 1982 would have been affordable?
Those were the days when you spent $900.00/MB of RAM.  Not to mention
30MB hard drives selling for $3,000.00.

   Linux is *NOT* low cost.  See below for my reasoning.  As for technical
excellence... let's see... we get new kernel releases every few weeks.  Bugs
galore are reported every day on the Linux groups ( And I'm not referring to
problems people have with Unix in general )  If technical excellence means that
the Linux groups are among the *highest* volume on Usenet, you have a
warped sense of what constitutes excellence.  I like Linux - enough so that
I've dedicated one of my machines to it.  But it is NOT elegant ( Which is
my definition of excellent ) because it is rooted in Unix, and is therefore
not accessible to the common consumer.

   Car companies take advantage of a stupid and gullible public.  Supermarkets
take advantage of a stupid and gullible public.  But it's the fault of the
public if they allow themselves to be taken advantage of.  Sure - it's going
to affect the people who actually *have* a clue.  But there are things that
we do that affect other people in adverse ways, as well.  It's a classic
Paredo situation - nothing is free.

   Sure there is - it allows me to write applications on a PC platform
without having to invent my own disk format, re-invent a standard keyboard
interface, or merely put a character on a screen without knowing the
intricacies of a particular hardware manufacturers machine.

   Cheap?  Not at all.  How are people getting Linux?  Generally, via
FTP on the Internet.  How much does a connection cost?  How much does
a student pay to a University for the privilege of having access to
the net?  How much less is your employer paying you so that they can afford
access?  How much is *your* time worth?  How much do the O'Reilly books
cost?  It is NOT free.

   You're assuming that Microsoft is the primary support provider.  Sorry,
but that's not the case.  Consultants, bookstores, and the kid next door
provide far more support than just about any company in the business.  And
who is the notable exception?  Wordperfect, who you recently castigated for
providing an inferior product.

   Yup - but they may also be the same people who save your life after you
slip in the shower and put a dent in your skull.  Again, the whole point
that I'm trying to make is that you have to deal with both the good and
the bad.  Complaining about the problem is all well and fine, but it's not
going to solve the problems that need to be solved.  Work with what you
have.
