In the August 9th issue of LAN Times there is an advertisement from
Accton Technology Corporation.  They are advertising a special offer
(while supplies last) for their EN1651 MPX 16-bit AT bus ethernet
adapter.  You can purchase up to two of these adapters at the
evaluation price of just $29 each.

These ethernet adapters are NE2000 compatible (which means they'll
work under OS/2 just fine).  The offer is good in the United States
and Canada only.  Add $5 for shipping and handling.

This is a perfect way to set up your OS/2 workgroup -- a pair of these
adapters will cost only about $60.  Add IBM's TCP/IP for OS/2, the
NE2000 driver from ftp-os2.cdrom.com, and you've got a two station
small network.

To order, or for more information, call 800-926-9288 or 510-226-9800
or FAX 510-226-9833.  When you order, be sure to tell Accton you are
using their adapter with IBM OS/2 2.x.  (They can use that information
in future product planning.)

Looking for Token Ring?  In the same issue the Andrew Token Ring
Adapter Card is advertised at $199 (first card only).  It is a 16-bit
AT bus 16/4 adapter.  Offer ends September 30, 1993.  To order call
(800) 328-2696 ext. 372 in the United States.  Elsewhere call (708)
349-5440 or FAX (708) 349-5673.  In Europe (only) call (44) 734
894689.

Subject: SLIP and Smail - no provision for un-reachable networks?
Date: Fri, 13 Aug 1993 16:43:14 +0000

I'm currently setting up a system, where mail is distributed via SMTP
across ethernet and dial-up SLIP, using smail. The problem is this:

Incoming mail is held in the spool directory waiting for delivery.
When smail 'runq' (same as /usr/lib/sendmail -q) is invoked, if the SLIP
link is not 'up', then smail will abort delivering the message, and reply to
the sender with 'Network unreachable'.

This seems reasonable, but what I would prefer to happen is for smail
to _defer_ the mail until the link *is* up. There is an option for this,
but this this is only implemented when the network/host is reachable
but not 'answering'; it doesn't cater for when there is no physical link
for IP packets.

I've scoured the man pages, and haven't found a way to avoid this.
It's not convenient to deliver mail only when the link is up, hence
before I start hacking the sources to change this, is there anything
obvious that I've missed? Or do I have to change to a better mail system?

Thanks,
Jon.

It's bound to be better than SoftPC in a similar situation...at least
the software doesn't have to emulate each opcode.  Granted, a 486/66 is
not as fast as a 40MHz Sparc, but for now it will have to do.

Our testing seems to indicate that RAM is the issue here.  If you can
keep the merge sessions out of swap they do OK.  Putting enough RAM in
the machine and keeping the amount allocated to each session under control
(we're looking at 4-6MB, plenty for the average Windows app) will hopefully
make it workable.  I'll know for sure soon enough...

It's interesting that while few folks bat an eyelash at putting 64MB in
a "workstation" many people seem to expect PC *NIX systems to run OK in
as little as 4MB.  Our UnixWare servers will be starting out with 48MB, and
we hope to expand them to 64MB or 128MB once RAM prices settle back down.

The first time I installed Xfree on top of MCC it took me about 45 minutes to

I had to post a question to figure out what I needed to do to get imake to work.

Here's the deal :  If people will send me their notes and comments on what they

X on MCC.  I'll write this faq even if people dont send me stuff.  Maybe one 
already exists somewhere- if so, tell me about it.  If not, I'll write a faq
so beutiful that for the 45 seconds it takes to read it you will hear a chorus of

Subject: Re: Why would I want LINUX?
Date: 13 Aug 1993 18:52:52 GMT

A couple of good reasons:

1. I'm familiar with Un*x anyway, and I like the way things are done
with it. In fact, I think the Un*x simplicistic approach to OS
services provides an overall appearance that is superior to most other
OSs. This is a reason for Un*x in general.

2. I like to run several things at once, i.e. when I've started a long
compiler run I want to be able to switch to another window or console
and continue work on another thing. This is a reason against MSDOS,
since as far as I know all multi-tasking add-ons for it are brain-dead
and a gross waste of resources. (Yes, I know this from experience.)

3. I like the genuine GNU Emacs. It runs best on Un*x. (For the
record, back when I was using DOS I've got stuck to that wonderful
Freemacs even when the first version of GNU Emacs for DOS came out but
didn't work due to a collision with the memory manager. The next Emacs
that I tried was under Linux...)

4. I need to run mail and news, the software for which being available
for Un*x in a sufficient number of nice and stable versions.

5. I need a decent application development platform. Un*x combined
with powerful tools such as the abovementioned GNU Emacs and the
obligatory make, RCS et cetera provides IMHO the best that you can get
for less than megabucks. And GCC is surely one of the best compilers
out anyway.

6. I need to run TeX, and I've tried the DOS version compared to the
Linux version on the same box - the latter is *much* faster (esp.
metafont) and uses less space, so another good reason to abandon DOS.

7. I am neither able nor willing to spend big bucks on software when I
can get good material for less. :-) Especially not since Linux is
actually the best OS you can get for the 386 class of hardware, if you
consider things like speed, memory usage, availability of software,
even support (from friendly net.people etc.)

8. Finally, yes I have some experience with computers and are one of
the "fix-problems-myself" types. I'm not sure whether Linux fits well
to newbies (but Windogs doesn't either! Read the chapter in the manual
about memory management.) But installing and maintaining Linux for
others could make a good business :-) (and a "better", not in the $$$
sense, business than selling proprietary software that is obsolete as
shipped.) You see, I support the GNU idea.

There are two problems in using bash 1.12 with INN on Linux I remember.
Bash 1.12 has problems with

        exec 3>&1

and gives problems when using a construct

        . /some/script "$@"

(as is used for example in the INN newgroup script). These problems will
be fixed in version 1.13 which is more /bin/sh compatible than version
1.12.

INN does not eat more and more memory on my Linux machine. At the moment
it occupies 800K of which 350K are shared libraries. Most of it is swapped
out to disk anyway.

Also, the seyon help files indicate that newer versions of sz/rz may
force the use of /dev/tty, so that redirection of stdin and stdout
to the modem will not work.  They seyon.help file includes little code 
fixes to rectify this.  You may have to check your rz source code.
(I experienced the advertised problem, and Mr. Saggaf's fix worked
just dandy.)

For one user your statement is accurate.  For more than 4 active merge
user, the system response is unacceptable, even on an extremely fast
and large system like ours.  Running MS-"DOS" software under Unix on
ANY multiuser machine is just not wise.  Software designed to use (waste)
all the resources of the hardware does just that.

Any multiuser system going into swap is a disaster, and the sysadm should
be slugged.  Add enough memory to keep up with applications; if you max
out then reduce load, upgrade machines, or distribute the load.  Swapping
and multiuser just don't mix.

Almquist's bourne-compatible shell, ash, has been discussed recently in

found in sun-lamp.cs.berkeley.edu:/pub/NetBSD-current/src/bin/sh .
Here are fixes to make what I found there compile and run on a
Sun SPARC with the purportedly ANSI acc compiler.
The fixes should be generally useful, except for those applied to the Makefile,
(which were required because my make is less amazing than GNU make).

Source in error.c needed a comma in an initializer list,
I moved "builtins" to "builtins.sh" because make had an
annoying default rule which tried to do "cc -o builtins builtins.c",
a function in mknodes.c returned no value,
some arithmetic was attempted on a (void *),
and trap.c needed a typedef for signal handlers.
