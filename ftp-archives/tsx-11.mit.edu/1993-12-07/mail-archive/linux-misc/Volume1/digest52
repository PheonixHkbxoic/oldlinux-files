Some fellow graduate students and I were discussing the distribution
of Linux.  One of the questions that came up was what would prevent
a company from adding some enhancements to Linux and then selling it
for a price.  It might even be that Linux is used just as an OS on
some integrated system which provided the ability to sense a nuclear
reactor mealtdown and lower the rods (please don't flame about the
real time nature of Linux and this application, it is just an example).

What restrictions are placed on the distribution of Linux, and its
reuse in other products.

Nothing.  However, they MUST acknowledge where the system came from
(i.e. Linus and the rest of the gang) and they MUST make the source
code available.  These are required by the GPL.

Hmm... I can't this happening.  Pardon my ignorance, but does this
kind of embedded system need an OS?

The information you're looking for is in the GPL (which I will admit
is not the clearest document in the world -- see the ongoing argument
in gnu.misc.discuss between the FSF and people like Michael Golan and
myself).

Perhaps these questions are in some FAQ I can't find, however, the negative
being the operative:

First, where do I get the newest/best files to install Linux? 

Second, I have a 105 meg hard drive with a 65 meg DOS partician and an
unparticianed hole for the other 40 meg (on which I planned to install it).
Will it interfere with my DOS partician? Should I back up or reformat or such?

Last, is it possible to configure a modem attached to a PC as a terminal so
that dial-in access would be allowe tdo the machine?

Thank you.

No, no, no...  I think Mr. Hawley meant "what would prevent" them.
That is, not "why shouldn't they" but what would actually persuade them
not to do it?

If this is true for DOS vs Windows (You know, the one with the 16-bit
extender?), is it true for Linux?

I would expect that most caches wouldn't do a whole lot of good --
Wouldn't the data/code cached in them change a lot as the computer
changed from task to task?  

Has anyone benchmarked Linux comparing a cached motherboard with the
same non-cached motherboard, or with more cache ram? 

(I could find out some figures for my 386/40 with 64K cache vs. the
cache turned off.  Under DOS benchmarks it seems to make a big
diference.)

LILO is just very flexible; apparently you are not informed about the
possibilities of its use. I for example, have a very standard LILO
installation, where the original MBR is left untouched, and the active
partition is the one where LILO is in the boot sector. Then LILO
starts through this, and I can select a number of kernels in this
partition, or other operating systems on other partitions. If I don't
touch a key, the default /vmlinuz image is loaded. You *can* also
overwrite the MBR with LILO, but it is not recommended and not
necessary.

You can use swap files, which reside on a normal filesystem. So you
don't need a partition for swap. But of course, swap on a raw
partition, not bothered by a present filesystem structure, is much
more efficient.

Since there are DLL libraries everything stays compatible. I have

of the shared libs back (for a 'normal' operating system that would be
equivalent to running binaries that are decades old with todays shared
libs :)

So what is being said here is that if Linus doesn't hand over some money
to some governement (or is it the Free Software Foundation) that the
material is not his, he didn't write it, he didn't create it?  I don't
think so.

Like I posted in another newsgroup today, I believe when copyrights came out
they were to protect authors of material from being plagarised by someone.
You know, so I couldn't take Linus's code, claim it was mine, and then 
try to take credit for it.  The @#$@# government and it's stupid little
courts and lawyers have taken this and twisted it into something even harder
to understand than the GPL.  Copyright means about anything nowadays.
My personal fave is "intelectual property."  Screw AT&T...that's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard of.  But I digress...

On the original topic, I am a little bit confused.  I know the GLP says
that if something is sold that has been GPL'd, then you must make the
source available, or tell how to get it (ftp, etc...)  But what if
Company XYZ did some work on it, beefed it up, lets say added the real
time support needed for the nuclear core monitoringg (This brings a whole
new meaning to the Core Dumped messages :)  So with this new code, under the
GPL that Linux has, what do they have to make available??? All of the code,
only the Linux source code???

While I do like the FSF and think that the GPL is a good idea, they need
a translator to take the thing and put it in English (not the Lawyerish it
is in.)

I completely agree: What the heck does the UI (graphical or not) have to do with the OS. It really has to be the choice of the user WHICH UI he wants to use (writing his own UI included). So, having an integrated GUI (generally spoken: Having any UI integrated into the OS) is a bug and NOT a feature.

The GPL is beside the point.

The sharp end of the stick is this:

        Linux is effectively defenseless against plagiarism.

If someone re-named Linux and took all the credit for herself (don't want
to be sexist, y'know... ;-)  I sincerely doubt that there would be *any*
legal retaliation.  After all, Copyright simply gives you the right to
sue and an even chance of winning at it.  It doesn't actually stop anyone.

There are no "Copyright Police".  Violation of Copyright is *not* a crime.

        So tell me...  What's to stop them?  Who will sue?

There is nothing to prevent this, and I think some do.  You do have to
consider the GPL on the OS, though.

I doubt there will be a great commercial interest until Linux is binary
compatible (fully) with other 386 Unixes (COFF/ELF).  At that point, much
business software will work under Linux.  And when that happens, I can see
great market potential.  Another approach is a VAR who can have their
key piece of software ported to Linux and then bundle Linux as the OS
for their product platform.

Let me pull a real-world example out of the air:  I have a friend who works
at a car shop and would like to trash their toy MS-"DOS" system for something
more realistic (multiuser, email, multi-terminals & printers, etc...).
There are at least 4 good Unix packages for Automotive shops available under
standard SCO Unix (COFF).  They are, however (being so small), very cost
sensitive.  Buying the Auto package AND SCO is still a little too high
(for their expected 4-5 user system setup).  If Linux could run the
many thousands of packages SCO can, then it could be used in the above
example to perhaps reduce the system cost by $1500+, making it more affordable.

>What restrictions are placed on the distribution of Linux, and its
>reuse in other products.  

I will let others elaborate.  But if modifications are made to the OS, they
would be covered by the GPL and must enter into the GPL also.  I don't think
this is true if they are add-on's (such as value added programs and such)-
those could be copyrighted by the vendor.  Otherwise, (besides GPL
stipulations), there are no distribution restrictions.

An application developed to run UNDER Linux is not covered by the GPL-

No, I would have to agree with the original poster.  Unix in general will
be using Wabi (by the way, it's Wabi, not WABI.  Sun insists it is not
an acronym for Windows Application Binary Interface).

I was at an IBM Developers' conference in San Francisco earlier this week
and played with a PowerPC box running AIX with a full implementation of 
Wabi.  I ran MS-Word, Excel, and PowerPoint along with the WinTach
Windows benchmark program.  The benchmark which tests standard word processor,
spreadsheet and graphical operations returned a value of about 65.  That
means that the Window programs running under Wabi run about 65 times faster
on a PowerPC compared to a 386DX-20 with standard VGA.

With SCO, HP, IBM, and most significantly Novell and USL endorsing Wabi, I would
say that Wabi will apply to Unix in general.  Actually, IBM had its own
Wabi-like project underway when Sun announced Wabi.  IBM decided to join
Sun in future developments and they will be incorporating some of the IBM
work into it.  COSE is also endorsing Wabi.  You can't get much better
acceptance than that.
