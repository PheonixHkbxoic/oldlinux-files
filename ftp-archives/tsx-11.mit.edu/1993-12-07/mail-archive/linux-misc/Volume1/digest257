Well, locally, I pay a flat fee of $30/month for a local phone call.  I could
pay higher if I wished, and did not shop around.  8-)

But really, this is all quite beside the point that some people resell
Linux for a profit without mentioning that some of the items included
do NOT work.  If I were to decide to resell Linux, I would make it clear
what worked and I supported, and what did not.  It would be good to still
include those other packages, perhaps, if it included source code so 
someone could play with it.  But of what value is it to include binaries
that do not work other than to make your package sound more complete?
Without some disclaimer, the process does in fact produce disgruntled
customers and in my opinion, is a disservice to all the fine work
people have put into Linux.

Here's the relevant section of my Linux System Administrator's Guide
(regardless of my request that people not rely on information contained
within it :-).  It should be essentially unchanged from the ALPHA-1
release (_don't_ ask me about the ALPHA-2 release).

\subsection{ Swap Space }

        How much swap space do you need?  Some people will tell you
        that you should allocate twice as much swap space as you have
        physical memory, but this is bogus.  Here's how to do it:

    \begin{enumerate}

    \item

        Estimate your total memory needs.  This is the largest amount
        of memory you'll probably need at a time, that is the sum of
        the memory requirements of all the programs you want to run at
        the same time.  For instance, if you want to run X, you should
        allocate about 8 MB for it, gcc wants several megabytes (some
        files need an unusually large amount, up to several tens of
        megabytes, but usually about four should do), and so on.  The
        kernel will use about a megabyte by itself, and the usual
        shells and other small utilities perhaps a few hundred
        kilobytes (say a meg together).  There is no need to try to be
        exact, rough estimates are fine, but you might want to be on
        the pessimistic side.  Remember that if there are going to be
        several people using the system at the same time, they are all
        going to consume memory.  (However, if two people run the same
        program at the same time, the total memory consumption is
        usually not double, since code pages and shared libraries
        exist only once.)

    \item

        Add some security to the estimate in step 1.  This is because
        estimates of program sizes will probably be wrong, because
        you'll probably forget some programs you want to run, and to
        make certain that you have some extra space just in case.  A
        couple of megabytes should be fine.  (It is better to allocate
        too much than too little swap space, but there's no need to
        overdo it and allocate the whole disk, since unused swap space
        is wasted space; see later about adding more swap.)  Also,
        since it is nicer to deal with even numbers, you can round the
        value up to the next full megabyte.

    \item

        Based on the computations in steps 1 and 2, you know how much
        memory you'll be needing in total.  So, in order to allocate
        swap space, you only need to subtract the size of your
        physical memory from the total memory need, and you know how
        much swap space you need.  (On some versions of \UNIX{}, you
        need to allocate space for an image of the physical memory as
        well, so the amount computed in step 2 is what you need.  On
        these systems, the usable swap area begins after the size of
        the physical memory.)

    \end{enumerate}

I saw a while back in c.o.l a discussion about multi-port serial
cards, and some people talking about how you build them.

Well, based on $US1295 for a 16 port serial card, I want to know how
to make one. :)

Anyone got any pointers?? even anything on adapting normal serial
cards to successfully share an IRQ line?

DFI, Inc. makes a card called MS-400 with four serial ports.
(DFI is a company in Asia.)
The boards I have, have two sockets where a 16550A can be inserted.
Two such cards can be combined to form 8 com ports.
E.g., they support 8 different IO areas.
The problem is that they only support 4 simultaneous interrupts.
E.g., you can jumper IRQ 2,3,4 and 5 to an arbitrary port.

Thus, more than 4 ports with interrupts are impossible.
In my case I could not spare IRQ 4 and 5 so I was stuck with only
2 possible ports.

These bords cost, in Sweden, 450 kronor wich should be equivalent to
something like 50 dollars.

The good news is that the bords can be rebuilt to share the
interrupts. All you need is 4 resistors (1000 Ohm), 8 diodes (1N4148)
and a soldering iron. These passive components can be nicely fitted
on thecircuitboard if the DIP switches use dto jumper the interrupts
are removed. (A soldering iron sucker (is that the right term in
English :-) makes things easier.)

I will not go into details as the actual modifications should be
obvious to anyone that has the competence to even consider this.
The resistor value 1000 Ohm works for me.
The resistor works in a pulldown mode as the IRQ lines on the PC bus
is active high.  The diodes combined with the resistors works as an
and gate.

Oh, the boards have one 9DSUB and one 25DSUB on board and are
delivered with two cables for teh other ports.
(Most larger PC chassis have prepunched holes for additional DSUB
 connectors.)

Don't bother with this unless you know how to operate a soldering
iron and a soldering lug sucker (sp).

Gathering hearsay, the situation seems as follows: those sending Email
with bug reports to Peter McDonald do not get any responses. Even if
bug fixes make it sometime into the release, this is unsatisfactorily.
Beside, release times are pretty stretched out, even where obvious bugs
need to be remedied. This is very much unlike the fast kernel fix
turn around times. If the slow changes were indicating matured stability,
this would not be harmful to Linux' image as much as it is.

Whereas the other releases and their updates as well as the kernel suggest
that Linux is under heavy development, SLS suggests that it is stable
buggy, and no help around.

When Slackware started as a bugfix release of SLS (obviously there was
some need recognized) Peter MacDonald prohibited his installations scripts
to be used and removed the GPL from them.

As to the problems of SLS, two highlights I myself have encountered:
News software is there, but utterly unconfigured, and with no sufficient
amount available to do configuration on your own. If you need to download
the docs separately, you might as well download the whole package.

Net-2 support has a non-standard file layout, so the usual instructions
do not work off the box, and upgrading is effectively made much more
complicated than necessary. However, the installation scripts do not
work properly, at least not for our Class A network here.

I think they do this on purpose, to sell their technical support. I

Dreaming of an 8-line to 8-line loopback test for slap?

You probably already know about the Boca and other clones of the AST 4 port
dumb board that can be accessed with one interrupt(using FAS in the
commercial x86 UNIXes).  That same driver is supposed to work with the HUB6
dumb board that Bell Technologies (later bought by Intel) made a few years
ago.  I believe Boca makes an 8 port board, but I do not know how compatible
it is with the 4 port.  All of these dumb boards need to be updated with
16550 AFN's if they are not already so equipped.  Pricing on the dumb boards
is about $US40-50/port retail.  With two 8 line boards the slap test would
not have to be a loopback.

The price you quote is getting near the bottom of the range for asynch
clusters that work over ethernet.  The Livingston is around $2000 I
believe.  There may be cheaper ones.

You can't forbid a release. But you can help to make Slackware more
famous. What about a disk or tape copy service .... ??

I heard Addison & Wessely is looking for authors for a Linux book
project.

Since there are so many publications about SLS and SLS is so @&*#^ 
I argued to write a book based on Slackware, because it's pretty 
standard and runs out of the box and many other well known reasons ...

Further recommendations were about offering Slackware disks with
the book as an option.

Perhaps people who would be interested in getting a book and
disks about Slackware should contact Susanne Spitzer in germany
to make clear, that there is a market for making such a book.

I've got a Wangtek EN5099-24 tape drive and PC-36 controller card.

They're now working perfectly with Linux...I had to get the 0.99pl13
kernel because the SLS kernel source doesn't work with qic-36 drives.

what i want to know is what is the optimum block-size to use with tar
when backing up to tape..

The default block-size is abysmally slow.  -b 256 speeds it up a lot!
and -b 1024 seems to be about the same as -b 256.

Has anyone got any recommendations or advice for me?  I want to give it
as much memory as will be useful without wasting it...

does it make a difference whether I am using -z (or -z -z) or not?  should
i use different block sizes depending on whether or not i am compressing?


btw, I notice that although the tar man pages say that tar only works
with compress and not gzip, gzip does work if compress and uncompress
are sym. links to gzip.  Neat!

   Cirrus Logic (up to 2M)   approx $150
   Tseng labs ET-4000        approx $220
   Tseng Labs ET-4000/w32    approx $260 (this one's probably out of my price
                                          range unless it's significantly
                                          better)


I only have an old Analog/TTL monitor - which works fine at 640x480, and
probably at 800x600 as well - i have no docs for the monitor so will have
to try it and see.  I'll be replacing this monitor with something better
in a few months time, but it's all i've got for now.

Thanks in advance...


(*) on another note, has anyone heard anything about Dynamic Cache
Architecture ("DCA").  The guy I bought the m/b from said it was the
"latest thing" and was much faster than having 128K cache on the m/b.
The m/b manual also says that it can be up to 300% faster than normal
cache memory.  Unfortunately, the manual doesn't go into much detail,
but it seems to me as if it might be just some sort of sophisticated
write buffering scheme (the manual talks about buffering 8 bit and
16 bit writes until it has a 32bit packet to burst-write onto main
memory).  that's about as much detail as it goes into - taiwanese-english
is amusing reading at times but it's bloody hard to get useful info
from it.  

could someone who has heard about "DCA" give me a rough comparison
to conventional cache ram.  Is it actually better or have I been
a sucker?

For the lpr/lpd system you can put a mx#0 field in the printcap entry. This
removes any size limits.
