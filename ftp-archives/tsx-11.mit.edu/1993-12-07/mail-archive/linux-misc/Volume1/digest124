        Where do you register the possible location for shared libs
and where do you get the list of currently reserved locations for
the shared lib?

        I have look at the tools docs, It this the latest
offical list?

        Has anyone a copy of a shared lib for wxw?
        And does it (That version) use motif or xview widget library?

        Cheers Dave.

I ended up doing something like that, but it shouldnt be needed.

This is sort of off topic, but might amuse some people.  The company I
work for did some work on the I/O system for a cash register to be used
in Germany.  The cash register runs a modified MS-DOS.  It's modified
to handle power failure.

They get a power failure every day.  Why?  Apparently, and no one was able
to explain to me why they do this, the way they shut down an office at the
end of the day in Germany (or, at least at the places that were going to
buy these cash registers) is by just turning off all power to the building!

If a sales clerk started doing the daily accounting a little late, tough.
Power goes off on schedule, regardless.  The cash register was expected
to resume in the morning when power came back on exactly where it left
off.  Fortunately, the things had battery power that preserved RAM, so
our main problem was just dealing with the actual I/O  that was in
progress when power failed.

I wonder if they turn off their office computers the same way they turn
off their cash registers?

Well, for that matter, wasn't the LSI-11 available then, too?  One could
make a good case for the LSI-11 being superior to both the 68k and the
8086.

However, engineering design encompasses more than just picking the
processor with the best architecture.  It includes meeting specifications
in other areas, too, such as manufacturability, price, etc..

Was the 68000 available in the quantities specified by IBM, with the number
of second sources required by IBM, at the right price?  Unless you can
answer these questions, you can't say one way or another whether or not
the design was good.

One of the most instructive chapters I've ever seen in a text book was
the last chapter of the digital design book they used to use at Caltech
for the introductory digital logic course.  I wish I could remember the
name of the book.  The chapter was called "The Engineer As Dope Pusher."
It concerned the tendency of engineers to just think about nifty
technical things rather than the complete system that was being
designed.  Examples of where this kind of thinking leads were
given, such as using a CPU to control how long a clothes dryer
runs, rather than a simple mechanical timer (this was written in
the late 70s/early 80s, when the mechanical timer would be cheaper,
easier to design (standard part), easier for the user to understand,
easier to manufacture into the dryer, and easier to obtain, but not as
cool for the engineer designing the dryer to use).

From the dope pusher point of view, a 68k design was clearly best, of
course.

Error.  The 68000 brought out 24 bits (actually, it brought out a 23
bit word address, plus two lines to tell which bytes in the word were
being addressed, but it's reasonable to call it 24 bits when talking
about byte addressing).

The 68010 was the same.  For those who needed more, but did not want to
go to the 68020, there was the 68012, which was basically a 68010 with
more lines brought out.  The '012 didn't bring them all out, though.  It
left at least one out, and, oddly, one of the ones it left out was not
on the end (e.g, instead of giving you a 2 gig address space, it gave
you two 1 gig address spaces, with a gap between them)!  (Replace 2 gig
and 1 gig in the previous sentence with whatever the actual size was
on the '012).

It could have been worse.  They could have picked the GI 1600.  It was
available in quantity (Mattel was using them in the Intellivision), and
had a 16 bit data bus (although the 10 bit (!) instruction bus might have
raised a few eyebrows...). :-)

The early chips weren't working fully, either.  I remember because when I
took the microprocessor lab class at Caltech, I took it in early 1982, and
that was the second year that Motorola had enough 68Ks to give a few to
Caltech (we got, I seem to recall, about 4 of them that year).  The year
before, we also got about 4, but all of those were marked as being
experimental, which Motorola said meant that some instructions might
not work right.

Man, were those of us who got the 68Ks careful in that class!  If we
fried or zapped our 68K, we would not be given another free one.  Those
of us who were taking the class as seniors (I believe that was all of us
who were doing 68K projects, because seniors got priority for these),
and who were cutting things a bit close, so that an F would prevent
graduation, would have had to either not graduate if we zapped our chip,
or go out and actually spend the several hundred dollars it would take
to buy a new one.

To write software for the 68K, we edited the source on the VAX, submitted
it as a batch job to the 68000 cross assembler on the 370, downloaded the
output to the HP 64000 that knew how to get that into a format acceptable
to the ROM burner, and then took the data to the ROM burner on floppy.
Ahh, those were the days...

Whoa, you've got some dates confused here.  The IBM PC was announced on
August 12, 1981.  Perhaps you are thinking of their Displaywriter word
processor, which was 8086 based, and came out before 1980?

And here is where Intel made their most annoying technical botch when
they came out with the 286.  If they had just put the bits in protected
mode selectors in a slightly different order, they could have made the
choice between segmented and flat address space up to the OS.  All it
would have taken is putting the various fields in the selector in a
different order.  Alas, the horrors that were inflicted on programmerkind
because they didn't do this (I worked on porting System V Release 3 to
the 286, and still have not recovered...).

The 68k doesn't support 32 bit offsets for PC-relative addressing.  It has
nothing to do with the compiler.  The problem is that Apple wanted to do
position-independent code that could be moved around.  To use 32 bit offsets,
you've got to patch the code whenever you move it.  Under the memory limits
they were working with, they probably could not afford to keep the relocation
information around that would be needed to do this at runtime.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Now it gets tricky.  What does this mean?  For example, if I run Unix
on a diskless workstation connected to an NFS server, is Unix still
an operating system?  It's not directly providing the file system.

Note that what Windows does is similar, except that rather than an NFS
server across a network, the file system is handled by DOS running in
a V86 task under the control of Windows.

It seems to me that on this point, either we have to include Windows, or
exclude Unix.  I'll vote for including Windows.

Note also that items 1 through 4 all break down in the presence of a
virtual machine system, like IBM's VM system.  It seems to me to be
incorrect to say that XXX is an operating system when running on bare
hardware, but it is no longer an operating system when it is run under
a virtual machine.

I've got some objections to the part about a command language in
item 4.  Certainly, many systems built a command language right into
the guts of the system (e.g., TOPS-10), but Unix doesn't do this.

I think you'll find that they view multitasking as a basic element because
they intend to look at multitasking OSes.  If you look at books that also
give some coverage to batch processing OSes (e.g., Deitel or Shaw), I
think you'll find that they don't make multitasking a basic element.

By the way, I've seen books that put real-time OS into a separate
category, too.

I like what Deitel has to say.  His definition is not that important,
actually.  What is important is that he gives two.  He gives one that
he says would be used in the 60s, and then points out how the way we
build computers has changed, and gives a more modern definition.  The
thing I like about this is that it suggests that the definition should
be flexible, changing to match the way computers are actually built.
This seems to me to be the best way to go.  Being too rigid will trip
you up when someone comes along and does something weird (like hooks
you up to a network and takes something that you thought was part of
the OS and sticks it on a server somewhere).

Personally, I like my definition.  If writing XXX is a job I would have
considered taking back in the days when I viewed myself as an OS hacker,
and I don't have to write it in 80x86 assembly language, then XXX is
an operating system or part of an operating system. :-)

Yes.  You need to define what you mean by "run by itself."  Distinguish
this from what, say, a diskless Unix workstation does.  Distinguish also
from what OS/2 does when it creates a V86 task to run the INT 13h BIOS
to support third party disk controllers for which you do not have a
driver.

All I see lacking in Windows is the file system.  It lets DOS handle that
(although Windows in turn gets control from DOS when DOS tries to actually
access the disk -- all DOS does is decide what blocks to access).  I fail to
see how this is different from a system that lets a server handle the
filesystem, or from a system that uses loadable file system modules, with
DOS taking the place of a loadable file system module.

[Note: when I said "All I see lacking" above, I meant all that I see lacking
as far as whether or not Windows is an OS, not all that I see lacking in
Windows as far as what it takes to be a *good* operating system!]
