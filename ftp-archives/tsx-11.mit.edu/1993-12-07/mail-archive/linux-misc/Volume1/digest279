Subject: Which Linux?
Date: Fri, 5 Nov 1993 21:54:59 GMT

I've hunted through FAQs and HOWTOs. I've installed the latest SLS
release and had problems with it, and from what I read that's not
surprising.  

Surely there is a list of what is wrong with the latest SLS 
(and how to fix).  Please point me to it...

If not, which is the more stable linux release?  And where do I get it?

If no release is particularly better than any other, what would you all
recommend as the best for putting together a BBS?  Why?

Also, I have an AT&T IPC-802 intelligent serial port board.  Everything
I've read says that drivers for it don't exist, and probably never will.
Does anyone have any information to the contrary?

Thanks very much for your help!
-Paul

ROFL!  Lucky you didn't turn the clock back (on both machines) or you
would be left with salad a-la-linux. :)

I went through a similar experience:

o On Monday, term was working fine.
o On Tuesday, term stops working.

What I did:

o Run term on both ends.  Didn't work.
o Run term on both ends again.  Didn't work.
o Give up.

Admittedly, I wasn't quite as thorough as you, but I acheived about as
much as you did. :)

I have to say, this was one of the more amusing posts I have read in a
while. (Yes, I am the type that loves Australias Funnies Home Video

        I have seen tons of them at computer shows.  There are one or two
vendors who have the Yggdrasil disc (Fall 93), and I have yet to see any of the
others.

        I asked a bit about the INFOMAGIC disc, and if it is the one you are
talking about, it is supposed to contain NetBSD, FreeBSD and linux all on one
disc.  The vendor seemed to think that this was an advantage.  Having seen the
latest Yggdrasil disc (which is stuffed to the limit with things), my
preference would be to have one disc with only linux stuff on it.  As far as I
can remember, the linux kernel on this disc was rather old (but I cannot
remember which one pl10???), but the disc was fairly inexpensive.

        One vendor indicated that the discs that sell at computer shows must be
priced at or below about 30$ unless it is a popular title, or if it has X-rated
GIF files.  If the price is < 20$, a lot of people would buy it having never
heard of it before just to see what the heck it is all about, but for 50$ far
fewer people would be willing to try this.  If linux gets some good write-ups
in one of the big magazines, the situation could change quite a bit overnight.
I am in no way complaining about the prices of the linux discs, but this is
apparently how the market works at the computer shows.

I posted earlier about a problem with XFree86 2.0 where it would screw
up my virtual consoles. Since then, I've noticed another, perhaps
related problem: the server will not start up a second time.

When I start X, I get the following info:

Notice in particular the clocks lines; 65 becomes 18.10, and 44.40

be ignoring it.


Anyway, any help at all on this would be appreciated. If you have a
wd90c31 card and are NOT experiencing this problem, please let me know
that, too.


(The problem with the VC was that it would have a little flashing row of
vertical dots on the screen, and two thin strips of the screen would be
doubled, so that when the cursor appeared in that area, you would
temporarily have two oave two of them. This leads to text thatext that
looks kind of like the like these two lines. Quite annoying. Ioying. Is

Well, it is about time I put my two cents worht in about this.

As far as delivery service is/was concerned, Yggdrasil is/was
GREAT!  I ordered the CD-ROM about 3 weeks ago and I got it the
next day.  Since I no longer carry AX, I had to have my girlfriend
use her corporate card... minor delay.  One of my co-workers here
just ordered it a few days ago.  He wanted to pay by check, UPS
tried to deliver the next day!  I also noticed right away that
UPS RED (overnight) costs alot more than $5, more like $13.  For
delivery service, I'd give Yggdrasil an A.

On the other hand, I have to admit that they didn't handle my
installation problems very well.  It seemed to have been a problem
with my Always IN-2000 SCSI host adapter.  But I don't care any longer
since I have replaced it with an Adaptec 1542c and things are now
working fine.  I'm a happy camper now and although I had problems,
overall I'd give them a B.  I do believe that they are getting better
and trying hard.  

Considering what I got for my money, I'm satisfied and think that
it was money (for the CD-ROM) well spent.

Great!  Too bad they took my order in April, proceeded to ignore it until
July when they officially canceled it; they then checked in August to see 
if I'd gotten any of the discs, and finally wouldn't respond via email or 
phone.  I received nothing, of course.

BTW, didn't Jay of Jana post from qucdn.queensu.ca?  Why no name on your

Yes, I did that. It is a short (well, around 500 lines) shell skript which
has been used for a while, but I then decided to implement a chroot environment
which is much safer. However, people are just user 'bbs' in there, but can
send mail and download stuff with sz and kermit. There's even man-pages
for poor D*S-**sers. If they only read them. 

Any comment on that?

There is already an easy out-of-kernel hook for doing this in Linux: writing a
pseudo-NFS server that communicates through the local loopback device.  The
performance would be fine for implementing a typical low-bandwidth anonymous
FTP connection.  If this method of providing a file system became popular it
would be easy enough to extend the interface to do aligned page-mapped
communication.  In this case Linux does have the functionality you associate
only with a microkernel, while retaining the performance advantages and
robustness of a monolithic kernel for the bulk of filesystem access.

[[ I write this above with a little bit of satisfaction: I wrote the early
version of the user-level NFS server now used by Linux.  Unlike the Sun-style
mostly-kernel-resident server, it provides an excellent base for experimenting
with new filesystem types. ]]

Most of the other "neato" features you list can similarly be easily
implemented with other facilities already provided in Linux.  Shared libraries
are a very effective way of updating and customizing your environment, if
that's what you really want to do.

Has anyone out there run Plan-9, which provides many of the same
environment/filesystem customizations mentioned here?  Did you actually try
it?  Were you and your program still sane afterwards?  ...I thought not.

I would love to comment at length on the rest of the features mentioned, but
most readers can probably guess my comments about 32 bit IDs, etc., so skip on
a bit.

(1) Trailer aren't used extensively because (2) Trailers generally hurt
overall performance. (3) "*Ever*"?  With every _network_ protocol I know of
you have to copy _most_ of the time.

I can recommend most highly the Infomagic disks as well as the service
provided by the company!  They also sell a Linux-only CD which is a
dump of the entire tsx-11.mit.edu linux library taken as of Sept. 1993.
this contains the full SLS release, the MCC release, Hlu's GCC release,
numerous packages and ports .  It is possible also to install SLS 
(at least -- haven't built installation diskettes for the others yet)
directly from the cd!  It is probably the best "sleeper" deal on the market
at only $15.00 retail plus $5.00 shipping (the shipping is the same for a
bunch of disks as one - within reason, of course!)  I have been very pleased
with their service and promptness.  Their number is 1-800-800-6613 or
you can contact them through the net at : info@infomagic.com

        Yes, I use the STB-4COM boards myself - 4 ports to 4,3,2,or 1 
        IRQ.  And they're cheap!
: I know Linux supports some 4-port cards, but can I put more 
: than one such card in a machine?
        yes.  you can put two of the STB cards in.
: Will such a setup support lots of 19.2kbps filetransfer going?
        There was a BIG argument on this here a while back.  I don't
        want to start a flame war so I'll just say that I'm happy 
        with 8 ports and speeds up to 38400 on my wimpy little
        386DX33.

Hi all.  Are there any plans in the works for putting Slackware on a CD-ROM
distribution?  Do JANA or Trans-Ameritech include Slackware on CD-ROM?
thanks..

change the line to:
none /proc proc defaults
and make sure you have proc support compiled in the kernel.

Remove any line in rc or rc.local that contains rdev.

Of course it would be easier if you dumped SLS :-)
