   This happens to me (pl12 also) if I don't set up buffering (tar -b ) high
   enough.  I normally set it to 3000.  It also happens if I have a lot of
   processes running and the tar program is swapped at all.  

There are several possible reasons for the tape not streaming. Here
are two of them:

1. Your tape drive does not have its internal buffering enabled after
   power-up (some drives default to this). In this case only 32 kB (or
   whatever is your driver buffer size) gets written at each time and
   then the tape moves backwards. You can enable the drive buffer
   with the command 'mt drvbuffer 1' if you get the new mt from
   tsx-11.mit.edu:pub/linux/ALPHA/SCSI/mt-st.tar.gz (this directory
   is mirrored at many other ftp sites). Up to kernel 0.99.11 setting
   block size enabled buffering as a side effect but this bug was
   corrected in 0.99.12 (and a new ioctl was introduced).

2. Your tape drive is too fast compared with your disk and filesystem.
   In this case the amount of data written at each time varies. You
   may get a tolerable or an intolerable number of stops. In the latter
   case you should use a buffering program between the drive and the
   program making or breaking the archive. One possibility is dd but
   I think there are better (double-buffering) alternatives although
   I don't know them.

The archive containing the mt program contains also a short document
on the SCSI tape driver (the same text is also there with the name
README.tape). This text may help to understand the possible problems
with the SCSI tape drives.

Hi all:

I am going to install linux!!!! I have 2 IDE HD's (210MB+340MB)...only the
210 will be used for linux.  I also have a diamond stealth video card (I
know diamond is a bunch of shits), and a pro audio spectrum 16.  I run with
16MB ram on a 486/33 isa system.  I was installing this to co-exist with
os/2 and it's boot manager.  I am running as a node on a tcpip net which
(obviously) is internet connected.  Wellllllll.....

   Should I use Slackware or SLS to best suit my needs?

Secondly....if anyone has any tips on how to install linux on the 210MB
drive and OS/2 on the 340 and use OS/2's boot manager, they would be
greatly appreciated.  Assume clean installs on blank disks.

Thanks
BoB

P.S. I will be running X, can I at least get VGA with my diamond???

There is also the yggarisl (or something) CR-ROM which comes with 5.25 and 3.5 
inch boot disks. You can install a cdrom based system, a binary system (95M) or
a complete system (245M).

I have a copy of this V0.99xx7 but I can not install it. My scsi controller is
incompatable. It cost me DM 95,- Circa #40. Its for sale if anyone wants to
make me an offer!

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

I'm speaking only for myself here, of course,
but I believe 3Com advises against installing a 3C501 in a new system,
mostly for the same reasons Donald has discussed.
You probably won't be happy with the 3C501 in your Linux box.
The data sheet is marked "(obsolete)" on 3Com's Developers' Order Form,
and the board is not part of 3Com's program for sending free Technical
Reference Manuals to people who need them.
The decade-old things are nearly indestructible, but that's about all they've
got going for them any more.

I hope you find our *modern* boards equally sturdy, and I want to hear
about it if you don't.  The Network Adapter Division design team sincerely
appreciates the *excellent* feedback we've got from the Linux community.

Subject: Seeking some hardware recommendations
Date: 25 Sep 93 12:02:09 GMT


BBS-project advancing...

To avoid bad purchases, I am asking you people to recommend me some
good hardware:

        - A fast multiserial (232 or 442) adapter for ISA-bus. 
          This is for modems (V.32bis) and if there is anything with
          more than 4 ports (like 8xRS442) with driver for Linux, it
          would be perfect, but a 4 port one will do. Can I use 2 pcs.
          of 4 port adapters at the same time in the same machine?

        - A good and relatively cheap SCSI-2 tape drive. Large
          capacity (200MB-1GB) and popular format, like QIC. Internal
          installation. 

Then something a bit different.

     We need something like this: An UPS and something extra that
     performs a nice and clean shutdown when power fails or has been
     down over a certain period of time. 
     Is it possible to reboot automatically when power is restored?

     Any hint welcome!

Thanks.

I don't think there's been anything in col.announce saying that
0.99pl13 is official.

When it comes to just about anything except coding, Linus is among the

Beware - this may all change!

Linux has only recently had a working mmap() system call for general
files, and I am working on completing the call by allowing mmap()ed
files to be written to in memory.  The standard SunOS and BSD
implementations of mmap() require that a SIGBUS be returned in certain
circumstances, such as when you access memory within a mmap() region
beyond the end of the mapped file.

So, Linux may well end up using SIGBUS in the future - it depends on
whether or not Linus wants to make Linux's mmap behaviour with older
implementations.

Cheers,
 Stephen.

The GPL is intended to _further_ distribution, not _restrict_ it.

You may charge any fee you want, as long as you will supply sources
for three years and your customers may redistribute what they buy
from you (and a few minor details, read the GPL).  The fee is a
'copying fee' simply because it shouldn't be any other kind of fee
(which might imply extra rights or restrictions).  There is no
requirement that it be reasonable.

A few selected quotes from the GPL:

``When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.''

`` For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program,
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the
rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or
can get the source code.  And you must tell them their rights''

``You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.''

``You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein.''

So go ahead and sell linux, but read the GPL carefully before you
start, and remember that your customers can easily and legally sell
``your'' merchandise at half the price.

For the record, I hereby offer to sell any version of any GPL'd
program I can fetch via anonymous FTP to anyone who wants it, for
only $1 million.  Payment in cash, please.

"Long live" rock'n roll would be more suitable...
But to give this thread a little more informational character:

        - bsd386 is the commercial bsd from bsdi
          How can you compare the developement of commercial and 
          uncommercial products ? Stupid...

        - Ok, ok, supposed you meant the free versions of BSD.
          Which one should live long and is not dead end ? 
          Not an easy question, isn't it ?!

          - 386bsd 0.1 from Bill Jolitz, the original buggy one ?
            It's only a base nothing very stable ...

          - NetBSD 0,8 or 0.9 which separetes itself from
            the Jolitz developement. A fine version I tried
            several months ago ... This product looks stable
            And one of the most important goals of the authors
            is to develope a robust BSD version.

          - The 386bsd patched with the patchkit 0.2.4 or above ?
            A lot of work to apply all patches ... to compile
            everything new ... wasts disk space ...
            But good work, too ! I used this version months, too.

          - The FreeBSD  which is - I think - the version which
            shoul be a intermediate release between 0.1 and
            the 0.2 release from Bill Jolitz .... ?
            I don't know it ... future ? 0.2 isn't out yet
            or am I wrong ... (B.J.: summmer is over soon ;-)

Each of the PD Unix releases do have their pro's and cons.
Please be so honest and let everybody take the own decision
which OS offers the most advantages. 

Thank's a lot for that.

Yes ... poor quality ... And he doesn't seem to know, that he speaks
