I just wrote to the linux-activists kernel mailing list about this
very thing.  Forgive me for just reproducing those comments below:

Subject: ALPHA-0.99pl13h breaks amazing 2-button mouse story
X-Mn-Key: KERNEL


This involves the msbusmouse driver.

I could never understand why the XFree86 experts insisted that
in order for a 2 button mouse to emulate 3 buttons it was
necessary to detect some mouse movement before deciding whether
one button was pressed, or if a chord was being pressed to emulate
the middle button.  I had never observed this annoying behavior
with 0.99pl7 or 0.99pl9!

Yesterday I made a quantum leap from 0.99pl9, libc-4.3.3, and gcc-2.3.3
to ALPHA-0.99pl13h, libc-4.4.4, and gcc-2.4.5.  I'm still using XFree86 1.2.

To my dissapointment, this much talked about annoying behavior
now existed.  I diff'd the sources of the 0,99pl9 msbusmouse.c
and ALPHA-0,99pl13h msbusmouse.c and found that most of the
changes were sytlistic, a few of the changes were functional,
but they didn't look altogether incompatible, so I just replaced
the ALPHA-0.99pl13h msbusmouse.c file with the 0.99pl9 msbusmouse.c
file.  It did the trick.

Right now, I'm running ALPHA-0.99pl13h with this one minor modification,
and the mouse is behaving like its old self, that is, it's emulating
3 buttons in a manner which the XFree86 experts said couldn't
be done!

Subject: X8514 server probs.
Date: 22 Oct 93 17:38:57 GMT

I just recently got the "scale" version of the X8514 server for Xfree86
1.3 and it is working.  I just wanted to know if there's any fixes for
two small anomalies.  When I exit from X, I get a screen with white
vertical lines.  How do I change the the ATI card's video mode so I get
the regular VGA text screen back?  A second problem is that while in the
server, vertical white lines appear on the top part of the screen.  It
happens in twm and olwm (I haven't tried the others yet).  Is there a
fix for this or do I just wait for Xfree86 2.0?

Just curious.
Philippe

P.S.  Many thanks to all the programmers that made this happen!  Linux
and Xfree86 are awsome.  (I'm not worthy!!! :-))

Date: 22 Oct 1993 18:51:55 GMT


Howdy,

   Thanks to all the folks who responded to my query.  :-)  The bottom
line is that you can't a run VGA card and a CGA card at the same time.
You can, however, use a VGA card and a monochrome card (no one provided
details).

   A few suggestions were offered to help me out of my situation :

        - Do a bit of hardware hacking and change the address decoding
          on the CGA card so that its addresses don't interfere with
          the VGA addresses.  This would also require writing a CGA driver,
          appropriate support routines, etc.  This sounds feasible, but
          may take quite a bit of effort.

        - Put all the environmental sensors and software on the Linux box
          and have only the the display software run on the MSDos box.
          Then periodically download the new 'data' to the MSDos box via
          a serial line.  That way the Linux box always have the most
          recent environment information available to it, plus the MSDos
          box can access the data (and doesn't have to have any fancy
          multitasking software running on it).

   I think I'll probably try the latter approach, due to a lack of
time, etc.

   Again, my thanks goes out to those who responded!  :-)

vierzk.bates.scarolina.edu is a 24-hour ethernet Linux site (at least
until May '94).

Funny how the # of people trying to login/ftp/whatever to my machine as
anonymous or guest (yes, I do have an account called "guest", but I *do*
have it passworded with something you could never guess, so please don't
waste your bandwith trying :) ) has increased 100-fold since I first
posted my machine address as a linux site.  I warn any other admins not
to post if they are not sure that they have their network security set up
properly....

A while back, I thought someone posted an article about they where porting
a pascal compiler to Linux.  I would be very interested in such a compiler,
hopefully one that might be a bit more robust than ISO level x..

If anyone where interested, the features I'd like to see in a Pascal 
for Linux might be:

        Curses and screen I/O extensions (like Borlands gotoxy()
        Some Turbo Pascal extensions (file I/O, strings, text windows)
        Database handler extensions ( popular formats like FoxPro, dBase)


None of these features is available in commerical packages like MicroWay.

Thanks,

Let me describe my personal setup...

I use PCRoute as a router between my leased line Internet link and my
ethernet.  On my ethernet I have 2 Linux boxes.  One is a 386/40 running
SLS 1.03.  The other is a 486DX/50 running SLS 1.02 (will be upgrading
soon).  As of today I was able to get the router et all working happily
with each other.  I can now telnet, ftp, etc. directly from my network to
the rest of the 'net and vice versa.  These Linux boxes will be up 24
hours a day, as is our leased line.

We also had an 11 line overline put it and are attaching modems to it. 
We'll be opening up a new BBS in the next week or two.

When I use the Linux in summer holiday, I use "microsoft" one.  Because I
need to run both MS Windows and X Windows.  
If your PC have two difference kind of software, I recomment use the 
"microsoft" one.  ( I use microsoft mouse driver in DOS ).

Perhaps there is a point here that needs to be clarified.
It seems to me that the Linux community consists of a number of
segments.  All the segments want Linux to be successful.
On this point there is unison.
 
However there appear to be a number of different agendas, and if
these are not seen early, we could all be at odds, much like the
multiple commercial Un*x vendors.

The agendas seem to include ( and this is not an exclusive list )

1) Let's use Linux to finally launch the anti-copyright revolution.
2) Hey, finally a free Unix with source !!
3) Now I don't need to own a workstation to hack Unix. 
4) Let's create a more equitable playing field for writing commercial
   software - let's do it on Linux.
5) Let's use Linux to popularise Gnu software.

etc., etc.

Some of these don't bother the large Systems Admin's and their bosses.
But some others do. If Linux is to be successful in drawing commercial
software developers ( I work for one such large company  ) there's
got to be something in it for them - giving away source is something they're
not used to.

So the Linux community probably needs to consider what our feelings are
on binary-only software products on Linux.  If this is something we 
welcome, then it's only a matter of a year or two ( my opinion )
before Linux takes off as a commercial platform.  If we ( through
copylefts, etc. ) insist that every *app* developed on Linux also
come with source. Linux will take much longer to take off as a 
commercial software platform. 

It appears that there may be many differing views on this and
perhaps this may be a good time and place to discuss what we feel about
this.  I'm sure some interesting discussions will emerge.

My own personal opinion is that if we invite commercial binary-only
apps on Linux, we will already have created strong competition to
binary-only Un*x vendors. And this will go a long way in the direction
of the original GNU manifesto of free sharing of code.
So, a step at a time and let's welcome copyright apps on top
off copyleft Linux. My personal opinion only.

Flame protection suits on, everyone :-)

Linux networking doesn't yet have "promiscuous mode", which is needed by most
network watch tools.  I've just implemented the device level hooks for
promiscuous/multicast in my ethercard device drivers(*), but the socket-level
code still needs to be written.

* Drivers with the new hooks in pl14:
        3c501, 3c503, NE*000, HPLAN, WD80*3, AT1500/LANCE, 3c509.
  Drivers without the new hooks:
        D-Link pocket adaptor (written by Bjorn Ekwall <bj0rn@blox.se>),
        but you probably wouldn't want to do promiscuous mode through
        the parallel port anyway.

        EtherExpress, 3c507

Oy veh.

Some of us are really getting sick of answering the same questions about the
same broken SLS "features" week after week after week after ....

Recently I discovered that I'm going to have to distribute some extra files
with the next release of a program for amateur radio, because they were left
out of SLS --- I hadn't noticed because I installed the package the files came
from in its native form, not the SLS-mangled one.  :-(

We go through the same flamewar every four months or so.  The folks who are
willing to see binary distributions generally win, because the folks who want
