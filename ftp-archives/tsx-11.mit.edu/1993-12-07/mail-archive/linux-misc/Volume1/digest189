Date: 7 Oct 93 15:57:06 GMT


Hi,

I'm running SLS 1.02. After running through the installation process
without apparent error, I encounter a problem when the machine boots
from the boot disk created throught the installation. The machine boots
properly, and mounts the root filesystem, but somehow does not mount
any of the other filesystems, even though the are correctly described
in the /etc/fstab file. I can run 'mount -av' (the same command that
appears in the /etc/rc file) manually, and all the filesystems in fstab 
are then mounted properly. Anybody know whats going on here? Any help much
appreciated. Thanks.

I was talking to Tom about my problems getting swm to run on Linux,
and he told me that he had had to use the lex.C that was produced by
Sun's lex in order to get it running on some other platform (I don't
recall which one).  Maybe this will help?

        As typicl DOS machines provide minimal to no user authentication,
blindly trusting any NFS mount request from a DOS machine is a gaping
security hole.  It's my understanding that pcnfsd attempts to fix this by
implementing a user authentication scheme on top of the normal NFS.

Subject: Anybody used an ISA memory card with Linux?
Date: Thu, 7 Oct 1993 21:33:38 GMT

        I have tried with absolutely no success to use an Everex 159
memory card with Linux. I got all kinds of Memory Fault errors, although
I could use the card with DOS with no problem. I had Checkit test the
board for a pair of hours with no errors... so at least it is not its
fault I guess.

        Anyway, I read about the Speed path for memory refresh times,
and thought maybe I could change some value in my kernel to sacrifice
some speed for RAM.

        Can anybody elaborate a little bit on this? I have not enough
knowledge in PC hardware to know what I'm doing in this area.

        Thanks for any answer...

Hm, I was convinced that I made a stupid beginner's mistake, but maybe
for once it is NOT me. 

My boot disk made by SLS does not work, either. I just installed the
last version of SLS ("0.99.12 #6 from August 10") and my boot floppy
(made at the end of the installation menu) stops right after saying

"Press <Return> to see SVGA modes available, <SPACE> to continue or
wait 30 secs

I waited for a LONG time (several minutes) but nothing happened.

I also tried to make a boot disk by the method described in the
"Installation Guide" book (great book, btw!), but this did not work,
either. For the record, I did the following (being root in /):

rdev zImage /dev/hda2            # ( I have a zImage in / )
mke2fs /dev/fd0 1440
mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /floppy   # I created a directory /floppy previously,
cp /zImage /dev/fd0              # although it does not seem to be used here
unmount /dev/fd0

This stopped with

Uncompressing Linux...

invalid compressed format

 -- System halted

I can boot the system by using the a1.3 disk, then booting in LILO
from /dev/hda2.

Can anybody tell me how I can make a floppy on which I can boot?

Thanks a lot!

grab the newspak-1.7.tar.z file from sunsite.unc.edu:pub/Linux/system/Mail
which has a config.sh file you can use.

elm in SLS is already compiled with Metamail support builtin so all you have
to do is put metamail in your default path and elm will find it.

Did you actually try pressing SPACE or RETURN though?

Oooooooohh... I can sense the bogosity field building already. :). This
seems to me to be quite wrong. Firstly, you don't have to make a filesystem
on the floppy if you just want to make a bootable kernel image disk. (You
do have to format it though, but understand that's not the same thing.)
Secondly, you don't have to mount the floppy either. Thirdly, cp is not the
utility to use to transfer the kernel image. Try this instead:

[put formatted floppy in drive -- it can be formatted with DOS format or
fdformat; either way is fine]

# rdev zImage /dev/hda2
# dd if=/zImage of=/dev/fd0

Pow! You're done.

Some people will flame me for not specifying a block size with the dd command.
I don't think it particularly matters myself. If you want to use a large block
size to make dd copy things in big chunks (read: faster), then be my guest.
Anyway, this will dump zImage *directly* onto the floppy. The boot sector
prepended to zImage will automatically read the kernel image into memory
by referencing raw tracks. It doesn't need any filesystem information, so 
using mkfs or any of its relatives is completely unnecessary.

>This stopped with

>Uncompressing Linux...

>invalid compressed format

> -- System halted

Most likely zImage wasn't copied onto the floppy in one contiguous piece,
which I believe is what the loader expects. Thus, the loader wound up putting
currupt data into memory and the decompression code blew chunks when it
encountered it.

>Can anybody tell me how I can make a floppy on which I can boot?

Well, the two little steps I showed you before represent the surest way.
I believe you can also do something crude like:

# rdev zImage /dev/hda2
# cat zImage > /dev/fd0

I think using dd is a bit more reliable though. Just my opinion. Note that if
you're using csh or tcsh (and possibly others), you might have to do an
'unset noclobber' to keep the shell from complaining that /dev/fd0 already 
exists.

Remember: when making a boot disk, you want to dump the zImage file right
onto the floppy in one contiguous hunk, as though you were RAWRITEing it.
zImage has its own boot loader that will copy the kernel into memory a
track at a time (whenever possible) and start it running. All you need is
a formatted floppy for this.

Now, if you were to try building a boot floppy using LILO, *then* you would
have to worry about making a filesystem and mounting the floppy and all
that. This is the subject of a whole other post though. Maybe several. :)
