You should.  I think I did (I don't have a running linux box yet...,
to check this.  ;-) )

Starting, the GCC distribution has cross compiliation ability for
linux on the Sun platform, as well as others.  If you look at
the directions in the INSTALL file, as well as the GCC-FAQ,
(I Think Thats what I got) you can get things started.
I've been fooling around with this for the better part of a
couple of weeks. I had to reinstall the gcc for sun a second
time cause I didn't read the instructions in the INSTALL file. 
The one that says "build gcc once". ( I installed it locally at
this point ).

I then configured a second diretory with the gcc source tree for
linux. (didn't want to lose my gcc for sun mods).  I configured
this following the directions.  That is pretty much by the GCC-FAQ 

I had some problems here, but thats probably due to the fact that
and not knowing squat about linux yet.  I spent some time redoing some
work just to make sure I understood what I did, especially for getting
the cross-compilation tools running. (ld, ar, etc...)

I started, and it died when it got to libgcc1.a.  I figured out an ugly
hack to my PATH variable, and exported it inside the build for libgcc1.a.
After a few times of figuring out dumb mistakes I got a library.  To get
around this, you could probably just get a libgcc1.a from a distribution.

I had to do path hackery in a couple more places.  There aren't a whole
lot of them.  Basically it looks like:

        PATH=${tooldir}/bin;export PATH;\
        [ compile line ]

instead of:
        [ compile line]

That worked until it had to link in some stuff.  For some reason, I couldn't
get the -L option to work, and ended up copying crt0.o and libc.a into the
local gcc-linux source directory.  More makefile hackery and all of a sudden
I had what I think is a i486 binary. (file won't tell me, mostly cause I have a
generic system with no mods...)  I can't verify for sure until I get my linux
box running.  In the mean time, I'm gonna try and get the Makefile to a
point where it is doing things the way its supposed to using the right
flags and such.  Note: My first test of using the suggest way in the GCC-FAQ
worked.  The easiest way is to probably set up an alias or a script to set
the path of the linux cross-tools dirs to the first path in PATH variable,
and just do a make.  Bison compiled out of the box.

I'll try and get the changes I made to the makefile once they are the right
changes, and not my makefile hackery to the appropriate FAQ maintainers.

And maybe, just maybe, I can get my PC back so I can run Linux.

   No, Slackware is fairly stable. The latest ALPHA kernels are there in

Here!Here!

1152x910 on 15".

The secret is not to use the default fonts, but choose the one easiest to
read for you .Xresource file.  It turns out the one I use is the same
size as the diffault, but easier to read.  But even if it was larger
I still would have gained by having increased detail by increased 
resolution...  If I observe how I'm sitting, I notice that I'm leaning
all the way back in my chair, so I must not be having any trouble reading
the screen.

Look at it this way, laser printers have a much higher resolution than
a dot matrics printer.  But do you use this increased resolution to 
print 1000x2000 characters per page?  Obcourse not.  Even it is readable
with a magnifing glass, it is not practicle.  Much more practicle is
to use the higher resolution for better letter quality, and clearer
images,plots, ...

It's a _transatlantic_ call. There is a place named Europe, where

linearmapping works but requires operating system support, xfree86-2.0 uses
linearmapping for linux and sysv but not bsd/386-de-jour. XS3 was also
broken in this respect.  1152x900 won't work on a one meg card as:

1 - To get the accelarated performance of the S3 some ram is required for
the hardware cursor and for caching on the card.  

2 - THe S3 chip only works at 800, 1024, 1280, and
2048 widths, so if you are between these numbers then you need to pad out to
this size..

1152x800 is usable with xfree86-2.0.

In the latest S3 stepping support for a 1152 width was added in the 801/805
and 928 chipsets.

only the 911/924 (slow now days) or 928 use vram.

Get a S3 928  based card or a mach32 one if money isn't important.

It works for me.  Check that you actually have a client up that will show some
colours other than black & white.  Trying xsetroot -solid yellow should have
some visible effect, for example.

XF86_VGA16 does seem rather slow in comparison with the mono server.  This is
especially noticable when it redraws text.  I suspect this is a consequence
of the VGA dismembering its pixels in 4-bit mode.

ISA bus lines are edge triggered, this modification makes a level 
sensitive interrupt, that's not going to get the job done.  What will
happen here, is when you have multiple active ports, you will drop 
interrupts from time to time, hardly a desirable situation.  This mod

I run 1024x768 on a 15" monitor, no sweat.  One of the nice things about

Eh? I don't have Xfree2.0 yet, but I'll be most surprised if this is
true. In every other version of X I've used, basic focussing is done
by the server unless the window manager (or another client) decides to
redirect it (for ClickToFocus or similar). In other words, you can
live quite happily without a window manager at all, provided you dont
want to do anything clever like move or resize a window (I've done it
when I've broken my window manager on occasion). You can still easily
use the existing windows; just put the cursor over the window you want
and type. If you cant see the window you want because it's hidden
behind others, start hitting quit buttons until it becomes visible.
(This may be a problem with OpenLook-style clients that want a
WM_DELETE thingy before they'll die, but I'm sure you'll manage.) 

If you want to quit X, get to the xterm that was exec'ed by xinit and
type 'exit' in the window. Once it dies, X will (fairly gracefully)
fall over as well. If you've really lost all your keyboard events,
then I'd suspect that something more serious was amiss.

Hello,

I would like to take this opportunity to thank those that have replied to
my questions on Linux distributions.  From the gathered replies, two 
distributions seem to stand out above the others for their quality: 
MCC and Slackware. Furthermore I've had the opportunity to obtain
the answer to a few more questions I had. It does seem that the 
SLackware distribution now has its own scripts to install/remove packages.
The following is from the very latest README_ChangeLog file of the 
distribution:

New bootdisk containing non-SLS-/install dir killing pkgtool. These are also
in /pub/linux/slackware/scripts, and setup and pkgtool should work fine under
SLS now. (but why... ?)
And yes, pkgtool has been patched to fix the 777 perm on root. Apparently,
some packages were created in directories with rwxrwxrwx perms and installing
these with pkgtool left / with these permissions. The pkgtool script now makes
sure the permissions are correct on / as it exits, but this security hole
could still exist while these packages are being installed. Go single-user
before running pkgtool if this is a concern.
==============================================================================

This eliminates one of my most serious concerns with the distribution. 
Also from the same file:

Slackware 1.0.5 is released. 

Also new this version: All symbolic links have been removed from the packages
and replaced with installation scripts that create them. As a result, you can
install new software over old software without having to wipe out your drive.
Many of the changes in this Slackware release are to prepare for the upcoming
release of XFree86 2.0. When this is released, it will be possible to install
only the changed packages onto an existing Slackware 1.0.5 system.
=============================================================================

This only confirms what others have said earlier : slackware should be 
Xfree 2.0 ready. This is important to me because I have an ATI Ultra XLR
card and I want to get rid of the mangled screen when I get out of X. I was
at first fearful of installing X on my own but after having read comments
about the MCC that has become less of a concern. 

However there is one thing that troubles me. I've looked up the Slackware
files in detail but I cannot find any reference to TeX and LaTeX. These
two programs are important to me and I wish to know if they are supported.
If not, I am willing to install the T disk series from SLS on top
of SlackWare to resolve the matter. Has anyone done this and are there
copyright infringements involved in doing so ? The SLS distribution of TeX
is pretty independent of the rest of the package but I wish to make sure.

Thanks,

Eric
