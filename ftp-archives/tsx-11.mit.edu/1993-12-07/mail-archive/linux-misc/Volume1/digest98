No, it was badly designed even by the standards of the time.  Remember that
the 68000 was out at this point, and it was far and away superior to the
CPU that IBM decided to use.

No, IBM wasn't the *first* to have done this.  The Apple II was also usable
and cheap.

The cheap clone market didn't come until well after the PC had established
itself.  It came *because* of the popularity of the PC.

Recall that even the Apple II had clones, namely the Franklin.

Yes, quite so.  I'll be the first to admit that it was more capable than the
Apple II, at least in hardware terms.  But it was *still* a bad design.  It
was, however, good *enough* to replace what was on the market at the time,
which is your point.  I have no problem admitting that.

However, my point still stands.  It's not merely in retrospect that it was
a bad design when evaluated from a purely hardware standpoint, or from a
programmer's standpoint.

So?  The lessons that were presumably taught by the previous generation of
computers had already been learned by many.  But not by IBM and not by
Microsoft.  I knew back before the PC came out that memory limitations
should be a result of a limited pocketbook, not a limited design.  I had
seen the growth in the size of software and extrapolated appropriately.
Many others had as well.  So why the 640k absolute limit, when the 68000
had a 16 meg limit?

It's broken enough to make writing useful applications relatively difficult,
but not so broken as to make doing so impossible.

Bull.  Look at the size of Microsoft Word, or WordPerfect, or Lotus 1-2-3,
or any of the most popular applications.  Hell, look at Turbo C++.  All
these applications require more resources than DOS itself allows, and that's
why you have such things as expanded memory standards and dynamically-
loadable code segments, all done by the *program*.  People have gone to
great lengths to overcome the limitations of DOS.

People just want to be able to run their applications, NO MATTER WHAT the
size.

If all people wanted was to run a single application at a time, then
Microsoft wouldn't have bothered with multitasking in Windows.  They
did, people use it, and thus your assertion that most people want merely
a single-tasking application loader is proven false.

Then you don't concern yourself with a very large segment of the population.

Oops.  Right.  I'd forgotten that it is available under Unix.

Oh, if WordPerfect is just fine for the majority of people, then why do they
continue to add more "features" to it???

Like I said, many of us learned our lessons from the first generation of
home computers, but the designers of the PC didn't, and *that's* why we've
had to go through a second round of inappropriate infrastructures.

Do the people who end up having to deal with that "deserve what they get"?

I'd love to.  It would solve a lot of problems.  But how do you suggest
making this happen?  :-)

Of course.  I don't argue that people don't benefit from inferior things.
But by definition, they don't benefit as much as they would if they were
using something better.


It looks to me like we're more or less in agreement on the important things.
We both recognize that things are where they are because of the (often
stupid or ignorant) choices that people have made, and that they'll
continue to make the same kinds of choices in the future.  We also agree
that the best we can do is make our own choices.  I've done so.  That's
why I run Linux for everything but games.  If I were designing hardware,
it *wouldn't* be for the broken hardware of the PC.

I haven't tried porting it, but I've looked at it.  Near as I can tell,
it requires a 68000 or a VAX.  But they don't make that obvious, so I
could be wrong (my opinion is based on perusing the source)...

Subject: Email Poll: VLB SCSI controllers and Linux
Date: Mon, 6 Sep 1993 02:12:49 GMT

I have just purchased a Vesa LocalBus motherboard for my 486DX50 PC.
I have been running linux, I intend to upgrade to 99p12 soon.
I want to buy a VLB SCSI controller, but the one I am eval-testing
at the moment is not recogised by SLS 1.03.

I would like people to email me details of their VLB motherboards and
VLB SCSI controllers which they have successfully got going on Linux.

Please include the details of the Motherboard (BIOS, Chipset, RAM, CPU),
the SCSI controller (brand, model, etc.), how well it works (e.g. speed...),
and what you had to do to make it go (e.g. get a patch from sunsite, etc).

I will post a summary if there is a reasonable response.

Thanks in advance,

Well, a real operating system is better than any strange memory manager.

Linux's standard cc is in fact gcc. The question is, if certain special
optimizations could make it faster. I doubt this, because i486s are
CISC architectures and therefore the optimized versions are only
slightly better than unoptimized ones (at least if the code generator
does at all know what he does...)

Reply-To: bf703@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Patrick J. Volkerding)


There have been a few more updates to the Slackware 1.0.2 Linux
distribution. Hopefully, things will be stable for a while now.
If you're happy with what you have, you don't need to upgrade.

Here are the new features:

The bootutils-1.0 package is now a standard part of the Slackware
distribution. This package does automatic filesystem checking of all
unchecked filesystems when you boot, greatly increasing resistance to
file corruption. 

Additionally, gzip and tar were updated to the most current versions.
These are 1.2.4 and 1.11.2, respectively.

The games series has been changed from 'G' to 'Y' to avoid a conflict
with an existing disk series for German users. Also, it now contains the
full set of BSD games. Thanks goes to Curtis Olson and Andy Tefft, who put
the collection together.

These changes are documented in /pub/linux/slackware/ChangeLog on
ftp.cdrom.com.
