Yeah.  One (I forget which) was for the major device number, and the

multiple copies of the boot/root disk pair...

Subject: Bootable floppy-based system...
Date: Tue, 30 Nov 1993 20:05:09 GMT

Before my latest effort to upgrade/enhance my Linux system with new
system-type stuff, I decided it would be cool to have a floppy that I
could boot and run from in case I broke something.

I don't mean just dd'ing the kernel onto a raw floppy, I mean having a
floppy with LILO, a kernel, a file system, directory tree, shell and a
few utilities.  So, I did fdformat, mkfs, lilo install, rdev'd a
kernel image, created a root file tree with /etc, /bin, /dev and so
on.  I created a few appropriate devices and copied a few files to
appropriate places on the floppy (init, getty, rc, fstab, fsck,
inittab, login, sh, mount, umount, cat, ls, mv, tar, elvis, rm,
more...).

Got everything set up so I could boot this floppy and maybe do a few
useful things to fix up a broken hard disk system.  I had about 20K of
space left on the floppy when I got done.

So I do a fastboot and shove the floppy in.  Oh happy day! LILO comes
up, loads the kernel from the floppy, mounts the floppy, and...
aaargh, I didn't copy libc.so onto the floppy, so none of the binaries
can be loaded.  It did give me a login prompt, but nothing else works.

Well, libc.so is a little over 600K.  By the time you put the kernel
(300K), libc.so (600K), a shell (220K), you run out of room on the
floppy for any useful stuff like tar, cpio, a text editor, etc.

Bummer.

I suppose I could try to find a simple bourne shell and statically
link it and some other file utilities so I don't need libc.so, but
I've got other stuff I'd rather work on, so I've dropped the
system-on-a-floppy scheme.  (I'll just be careful when changing system
files.)

Anybody else have any opinions on the usefulness and/or practicality
of having a bootable self-contained Linux system on a floppy?

Yes, I am.  I don't run many servers off my machine, and I also
don't have many users at this time, BUT, our network is not as bad
of a topography as yours is.  I suspect that subnetting is definately
in order, and is also going to be HELL to do.  None theless our subnet
is gettting near saturation at this time.  I find that my linux box
was crashing due to some memory leaks somewhere, but with pl13t it
appears fine.  I have been up for 2 days now on that kernel...and although
it is not that scientific, I think that it is much more stable...I found
that X manifested may of the leaks.

What is your subnet mask?  Perhaps that might be some of the problem?
I used to have probs because Waterloo has a strage mask (255.255.254.0).

I am also using WD80x3 driver.

*finally* a machine I think I can call relatively stable.

Is it possible to change the behavior of the meta (alt) key without

On afterthought, it seems it should be possible to change it with an ioctl;
what is it?

What could he possible boot from his own disk that could do more damage

Well, you can get a smaller shell like pdksh(91K) or ash (MUCH smaller 
than bash or zsh, but not as user-friendly), a smaller kernel (my pl14 is
230K...leave out the things you won't need for system recovery),
and use libc-lite.  Note that if you copy libc using cp, it isn't
600K at all; it contains holes.  Try this:

root# du libc.so.4.5.4 libc-lite.so.4.5.4
272     libc.so.4.5.4
223     libc-lite.so.4.5.4

So, that's only 223K for libc-lite.

Well, there are existing boot/root combinations out there.  Furthermore,
if you have two floppy drives, you can set up a small boot/root and
keep extra utilities on another disk.  Or, you could set up a disk
that loads your root filesystem into ramdisk and then you can insert
a /usr disk after removing the boot disk. 

These have all been done by various boot/root disk combinations.

  You need the `libc-lite.so' library, which you will have to compile from 
the libc source.  This is a `sparse file', so that although it is apparently 
600k in size, it actually takes up only a bit more than 200k.

No, I don't own the card.  I have been considering it as part of a new
486 system, intended to run Linux.  I have seen WinTach ratings for the
card that place it at 36 million winmarks (the Diamond Viper scores
50 million winmarks on the same scale), so the card has the muscle to
do high speed graphics.  It is also available in Australia (with a bit
of hunting), but technical specs are hard to come by.  I haven't been
able to find out its refresh rates at each resolution, or the number of
colours the 2Meg model supports at each resolution.  It costs around
$400 AUD.
