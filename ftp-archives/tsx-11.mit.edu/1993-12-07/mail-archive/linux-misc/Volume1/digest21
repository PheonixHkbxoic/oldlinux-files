This has, alas, been fixed in recent versions of Linux, which seems to
have come down with a very serious case of The Bloat.  I remember a
time (early 1992) when the Linux kernel was under 25K lines of
code.  The 0.99.12 kernel, at 118K lines, is nearly five times
the size.  It does not offer five times the functionality.

Similarly, things like the full SLS release have really bloated out--I
helped a friend install SLS last fall, and the full installation with
X came in at around 40 Megs.  Just recently tried again, and got
upwards of 80 megs.  Yeeow.

(NetBSD kernel: 195K lines.  Linux is rapidly catching up.  I predict
it will pass NetBSD in bloatedness within 1 year.)

Source code expansion is not necessarily bloat -- there is a large increase
in functionality or potential functionality, much of which is #ifdef'd out
for any given compile.  The true binary size is a much better indicator.

This is with a lot of goodies!  Take out the goodies, and it will once
again be small.  There are smaller, more minimal flavors of Linux out
there for those who don't want TeX, Emacs, OpenWindows, and/or various
development tools (fortran, pascal, smalltalk, lisp, objective C, etc.).

I still think it is impressive that you can install the SLS "a" set in
12 MB, and it's a fairly reasonable, functional UN*X if a bit minimal.
After that, add what you like!

Linux is still a very lean, fast OS compared to ANY of its competition
(even some versions of DOS!)  There are not many OSes that let you run
X-Windows in 4 MB and that can boot multi-user in 10 seconds (DOS takes
longer than that to boot).

Well, a *BSD system with all the stuff you find in SLS would cost some more
disk space than 80 megs. Time for shared libraries, I guess. ;-)

Anyway, with SLS you don't have to install all and everything. It's split
into packages which are separately installable and deinstallable.

I hope FreeBSD 1.0 and/or NetBSD 0.9 have the concept of 'software packages'
and means to install and deinstall them, at least for 'third party' software
like X or TeX.

Linux folks,

This thread is flame bait. It's full of inaccuracies. Let's not fall for it.
I have some suggestions:

1) Let's get it all out now. Correct any inaccuracies you see.
2) Always followup to c.o.msw.advocacy only: not to c.o.l.m.
3) Let's not post another word on the subject after 11:59 PM Sun August 22th.
   Come Monday morning let it wither on the vine.

Right now my Linux box can run MSDOS, X Windows, and VC based Unix all the
same time. I don't want NT, I don't need NT. I don't give a shit about NT.

Don't fall for this flame bait. Dump all the correct info in c.o.msw.advocacy.
They need the correct info. We don't. 

followups to c.o.msw.advocacy.

I'll let you in on a BIGGER secret -- microEmacs.  It is really small, fast,

This is on a per-filesystem basis - The DOS FS still has the 8 + 3 filename
limitation. The new NT FS has a 256 character filename limit.
: >protable                    yes                         no (x86 only)
Portable only to machines that are ARC conforming (i.e. written HAL's for).
However, I suspect that you could get NT up faster on a new cpu than
Linux, since Linux is tightly coupled with the i386/i486.

: >runs unix apps              yes (source level)          yes (source level)
This should read - Runs POSIX _conforming_ applications.

: >max addressable mem         2048 Gig                    4 Gig
In THEORY it can support up to a 2 Terrabyte address range, but it's
more like a 2 GBs for user applications. (Yes, I know
it runs on cpu's like the MIPS R4000 which is a 64-bit cpu, but NT keeps it in
the 32-bit addressing mode). Last time I looked, the address range for
a application (on MIPS & Intel) was 0 to 0x7fffffff. 0x80000000 to 0xffffffff
is reserved for kernel land. 
>networking                  stable                      unstable
Stable, but limited. No server side applications available (yet - as of May)
>price                       $110 (educational)          $69 (SLS)
Unless you are a student, teacher, or some how associated with some educational
institution that you can take advantage of such discounts, most of us have
to pay full price for such things.

LINUX IS FREELY AVAILABLE THROUGH FTP AND IS EASY TO GET.
What is the non-educational price of NT?  How does that compare
to $0?

Heres a couple categories this person left out:

                               NT                     Linux

can it be installed on your    NO!!!!                 YES
  machine today?

Yes.  It may be a fair comparison if there were thousands of 
paid programmers working for years to write Linux.  

Someone else get the rest of these.  Let's avoid addressing his
claims about NT, but instead address his incorrect claims about
Linux.  I'm sure there are people who would delight to see these
groups shut down by holy wars over NT.
