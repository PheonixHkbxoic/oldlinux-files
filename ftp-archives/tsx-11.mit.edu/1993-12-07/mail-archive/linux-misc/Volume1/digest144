        Just a quick note to everyone about using the SLS installation program  
with 2.88" drives.
        I have a 486/33E and a 2.88" drive.  When I went to install the first  
SLS disk, it kept giving floppy errors and the like.  I used the ECU and told  
the computer it was a 1.44" drive, and everything installed fine, except that  
it doesn't recognize my SCSI CD-ROM run from the Pro AudioSpectrum 16.  Anyone  
have a clue about that one?
        Just wanted to warn everyone.  :)

In my SLS 1.03, the /etc/fstab needed "/" added in the line for the root
entry.  It appears that if the first entry isn't right, no following
entry is mounted.

I grabbed one called 'xanim' off of sunsite a while ago (I don't remember
which directory--it was NOT in the Linux archive) and it compiled just fine. 
It was in with a pile of other animation packages (mpeg-play, xdl, xflick,
etc.).

Funny you should ask.  I just got an email response from jay@jana.com a
couple days ago.  He was replying to some mail I had sent him two MONTHS ago
(he wanted to know if I still wanted a disk).  I have been trying to get a
CD out of these people for almost 5 months now (including mailing them my
VISA card number and phoning them).  I think I'll give it one more shot
because their CD appears to be the most ideal for my BBS and the price is
excellent.  So I'm a sucker.  I can see it now:  I'll get a Jana CD-ROM in
the mail in a year and wonder what the heck it is, having forgotten all
about it.  

There are 3 other decent looking CD's out there.  SLS (of course).  Nascent
Technology's disk looks really interesting with lots of source code and
already compiled packages.  Trans-Ameritech CD containts SLS, Slackware and
386BSD.  I don't even know if the yddgrasil (sp?) CD is still being made
(maybe they sent out too many freebies and went broke?).  

What _I_ want to see (and which doesn't seem to exist) is a CD with a tsx-11
and sunsite mirror (with no duplication), Slackware, and some of the rarely
used files such as manpage directories ready for linking into an existing
file system.  

Unfortunately, there seems to be a trend emerging (at least in the Nascent
and Trans-Ameritech disks) of including PICTURES on the disk.  I can't think
of a more useless thing to have on a Linux CD.

I have been researching into the problems with Tandberg 3600 tape drives. 
Apparently, they were originally designed to IBM OEM.  They are not SCSI-1
or SCSI-2 devices.  They are SCSI, but they are not true to the SCSI-1 or
the SCSI-2 specification.

Numerous people has been having problems with Tandberg 3600 drives,
because they don't handshake correctly.  I contacted Vidar Mortensen of
Tandberg Data in Norway:
Kjeisasvelen 172
P.O. BOX 133 Kjelsas
N-0411 OSLO, Norway    fax + 47 22 95 13 55 phone 47 22 18 90 90
email:  vimo@tdata.no

He informed me of the following:

 Your Tandberg 3600 firmware (U06 or U07) are IBM OEM versions. Tandberg made 
 this firmware after IBM spesifications.

 You can upgrade your firmware EPROM to either standard SCSI-1 or SCSI-2. The 
 version numbers are:
 
         Standard SCSI-1    -07:06
         Standard SCSI-2    =08:15  (Supports Windows NT)
 
 The price from Norway is NOK 350 (approx. US $ 49) + NOK 150 for freight and 
 handling. You can send your order to me.
 
===========================cut  =====cut =======cut==================

Well, I think a whopping 70 dollars for an EPROM upgrade was way too rich
for my blood.

I asked if I could get it within the US, he said:

Alternatively, you can connect our US Branch, and ask their prices.  The
address is:
Tandberg Data, INC.
2649 Townsgate Rd.
Suite 600
Westlake Village, CA 91361
voice (805) 495-8384
fax (805) 495-4186

I don't know how much it is from the US Branch for such an upgrade, but I
would most certainly like to know if anyone finds out.

Best Regards,
Ed

I am getting the same problem and mine is a desktop unit.

I am running SLS 1.03 and a heinz 57 clone 386-33.

I get the unexpected floppy interrupt on boot up.  It never causes
me any grief.  I am currently booting linux from floppy so there is
a floppy in the drive (not write-protected).

I have not seen this message before I upgraded to 1.03

   Not only that, but I tried installing the tsx-11 SLS dist once. The C
   library was the wrong version (got some error about incorrect jump
   tables), which is pretty bad for a system with shared libraries.

   The sunsite distribution looks more up to date (and correct), although
   'loadkeys' is the wrong version for pl12.

I've got news for you ---- the SLS distribution is loaded from tsx-11;
sunsite.unc.edu mirrors whatever tsx-11 has.

As far as the loadkeys program, the kbd.tar.gz file has been available
on /pub/linux/sources/system for quite some time....

[ Sorry if this gets posted twice -- I seem to have botched it once ]

CALL FOR PARTICIPANTS
=====================

In 1977, a 129-digit integer appeared in the pages of Scientific American.
This number, the RSA challenge modulus or RSA-129, has not yet been
successfully factored.  Factoring it, a 425-bit number, would be a major
milestone in cryptography, as it would show that current technology is able to
break commonly-used RSA-cryptosystem keys within a reasonable time.

Excerpted from the RSA Factoring Challenge news:

The "RSA challenge" published in the August 1977 issue of Scientific American
(in Martin Gardner's column) is still open, and the $100 prize offer still
stands.  This prize can be won by factoring the RSA modulus published there,
which is:

RSA-129 = 11438162575788886766923577997614661201021829672124236256256184
          29357069352457338978305971235639587050589890751475992900268795
          43541 (129 digits, checksum = 105443)

--- End of RSA Factoring Challenge news ---

As with several other recent large scale factoring projects, we are attacking
this number with a very large number of workstations independently operating
at dozens of research and corporate networks around the world.  We are
soliciting volunteers to provide compute cycles to help us towards our goal.

With the permission of the authors, we are using the publicly available code
of the Lenstra/Manasse Factoring by Email project, with modifications by Paul
Leyland and Derek Atkins for RSA-129 and multiple machine types.  The sieving
is distributed around the Internet, with relations transferred to a central
site by email or ftp as convenient.  Combining the relations and matrix
elimination will be performed at ISU, using a combination of structured Gauss
and a MasPar dense matrix eliminator.

Each participant is provided with complete source code for the siever.  You
can easily verify that the program takes no input from your machines and does
not pose a security risk.  It requires only an email connection to transmit
partial results -- the software does not require communication with other
machines except for this purpose.  It is easy to install, and is designed so
that it will take up no CPU cycles on your machine when interactive users or
other important processes are active.  If preferred, participants can
accumulate the results locally and ftp them to the central site manually.
However, the program does require rather a lot of active virtual memory -- at
least 6.5 megabytes and the more you have the faster it runs.  That said, it
runs happily on any Unix box with at least 8Mb of physical memory.  It is
currently running on Suns (SunOS and Solaris), DEC (MIPS and Alpha), HP-UX,
Linux, NetBSD, 386BSD, FreeBSD, and RS6000 machines.

The project currently has around 500 workstations which are busy sieving.
However, to finish in a reasonable amount of time, this count needs to
increase greatly.  We are attempting to enroll around 10,000 workstations in
this project.  We estimate that we are over 5% of the way to completion at
this time.

This is a call for participants, who have workstations or MasPars at their
disposal and would like to participate in this project.  All contributions
help a great deal.

There is a $100 prize associated with factoring this number.  The prize, if we
win it, will be donated to the GNU project of the Free Software Foundation to
help generate more of the excellent software they currently provide.


SOURCE CODE and ID INFORMATION
==============================

Source code can be obtained by FTP (or using a FTP to mail gateway) from
        toxicwaste.mit.edu as /pub/rsa129/MPQS.shar.Z
        black.ox.ac.uk as /math/rsa129/MPQS.shar.Z

To unpack it (on a Unix system) do:
        uncompress MPQS.shar.Z
        sh MPQS.shar

It will unpack several files, one of which is called ``README'', which should
be consulted for building instructions, information on how to obtain a set of
IDs, and input files for this project.

I've upgraded the kernel, shared libraries, and keyboard table utilities 
in the Slackware Linux distribution on ftp.cdrom.com. The files that
have changed are noted in README_ChangeLog. Just in case anyone was in
the middle of downloading (again), the old files will be saved in
/pub/linux/slackware/obsolete for a while. This also provides a nice
safety net in case I introduced any big bugs :^)

The kernel has been upgraded to the newly released .99 patch level 13,
and the shared libraries have been upgraded to version 4.4.2 alpha. I
know I said I wasn't going to do that, but I'm giving in. I'll replace
these with the official versions as soon as they are released. The 
keyboard utilities have been upgraded to version 0.81, and several new
keyboard maps are included.

The new package "shlibs.tgz" cannot be upgraded using pkgtool. If you
wish to upgrade an existing system, do the following:

Put "shlibs.tgz" in your root directory.
Boot the bootdisk, and mount your root partition under /root.
rm /root/lib/libc.so.*
rm /root/lib/libm.so.*
cd /root
zcat shlibs.tgz | tar xvf -

Reboot, and you'll be all set.

 [ Could the hardware compatibility list maintainer take note ]

The popular AMBRA machines appear to have, as their default specification,
80 ns SIMMs. This is producing memory faults during memory-intensive
operations under Linux. These problems all go away when the processor is
slowed down through the bios. There appears to be no way to introduce
wait states on the SIMM accesses. I have contacted AMBRA support on this
matter, and they have either 
 1. Tried to pass me onto another person
 2. Told me that 80 ns should cause no problems.
 3. Asked me what a wait-state was (and this was the hardware support line!).

If you must use an AMBRA, you may need to update the SIMMs yourself.
