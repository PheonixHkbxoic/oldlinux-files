I haven't seen one.  I talked to a live person at JANA last week.   When I
told him that I hadn't seen a CD since June, he said "That sounds about
right."  Then he mentioned that the "Fall" CD had shipped "last week" and
I told him that I hadn't seen it yet.  The gist of his reply was:
        Customs often delays our shipments.  Have patience.
So, I guess I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and wait a little longer
before I really start to steam.

Bzzzt! wrong.  The X package is the SERVER and all the applications
are the clients.  Think of it this way.  One runs X on their machine.
It sits and waits for requests from applications to draw on its
screen.  The applications themselves cannot draw to the screen
(especially if they are not running on your machine, but want to
display on your machine) The X server SERVices the requests and draws
on the screen.  In a client/server model, the server is the one
providing the SERVice, the client requests services from somwhere
else.

If you disagree, go ahead and follow up. I changed Follow-Up to: line to
comp.windows.x.  But be prepared to put on your asbestos suit if you
say X is a client instead of a server.

Actually, he could be describing what in X is called a *server* - i.e.,
a piece of code he could run under OS/2 that would let some X client
application connect to the OS/2 machine sitting on his desk, draw in
windows on his screen, and let him type at the application and control
it with a mouse.

He didn't indicate what it would mean to "serve applications remotely",
but, absent any further information, I'd read that as "let remote
applications pop up windows, draw in them, and get input events", which
means he's asking for an X server....

As I remember, NCD - who came up with one scheme for doing X over a
modem (other than just running X atop TCP atop IP atop SLIP or PPP) -
bought some vendor of X server software for some PeeCee operating
systems.  Dunno

        1) if they offer such software for OS/2;

        2) whether that software can use NCD's Xremote mechanism for
           doing X over a modem (which allegedly is more efficient than
           just running X atop TCP atop IP atop possibly even compressed
           SLIP or PPP; dunno if that's the case or not).

The file to download the ROM code to your modem is available on Sunsite.
smodemdl???? something or other... mail me for the exact path if you can't
find it.  I use it currently, and my SoftModem 9600+ works fine.

Also, if you can't get it working, you can load the driver in DOS, and reboot.
Rebooting doesn't remove the driver from the modem.
I have a problem under Linux in that it detects the modem as having an 8250
instead of a 16550A.  So, I have to set it up with setserial in my rc.serial.

I don't think so.  Wouldn't it simply be necessary to implement the
Token-Ring_SNAP frame type?  All the IP stuff I've seen on TR uses
that frametype and is *NOT* source-routed.  Source-routing is for
IBM bridges.  These suck!  Real TR networks use routers!  :-)
Seriously though, if you have a routed TR network implementing IP on
TR would simply be a hardware driver and the Token-ring_SNAP stuff.
Doesn't seem that complicated to me, though I couldn't do it.. :-(

The October issue of SunWorld ran an article on PC UNIX. They reviewed
BSD/386, SCO Open Desktop, Solaris 2.x, and UnixWare. SCO Open Desktop
was given the most favorable review.

Linux was mentioned in a sidebar briefly, however, only as Softlanding
Linux Systems.  Nothing was said about the origin of Linux, etc. The
ftp sites were given as well as SLS's and Yggdrasil's communication
addresses. A reader who does not know what Linux is likely to
misinterpret the sidebar to mean that SLS developed the system.

My guess would be no because I believe that SoftPC emulates a 8088/86
machine, and not a 386+ , and linux runs the way it does because of the
386 machine instructions.  (that wasn't clear.. ie Linux uses 386
instructions, and SoftPC only runs up to 8088/86 instructions)

SoftPC has to emulate not only a cpu, but an operating system and the
underlying hardware, too. So even if it would emulate a 386, the chances
to run Linux on it are minimal, unless it would provide Linux emulation
too, as it provides MSDOS emulation.

We seem to be creeping up in price a little here!
Ed Carp was recommending a $50 card, right?  I upped him
to $150 (or less - the lowest I have seen for the Actix is
$129, and STB for $139), and here we are at $250 with the
desire to upgrade.  If you want/need more than 1024x768
(or money is burning a hole in your pocket) by all means
get a '928.  Those of us who can't afford the 17-21" monitors
might as well save the extra $100 (hey-that's half a Mitsumi
CD-ROM!) and get the cheaper '80x.  I doubt that the subjective
performance difference will be substantial at this resolution.
                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Brent Olson and I do agree that that first $50 to $100 upgrade
price is well worth it, and it's hard to go back once you have
seen Xwindows fly with the acceleration.

Does anyone know if there will be more MCC releases of Linux?  I personally
love the MCC distribution and know there are many others.  
 
If so, how far off would such a release be?

This is about the third post I've seen agreeing with this notion, however I
severly doubt that this is the problem!  

I've run a 386/40 with an Intel 387/33 for over a year with no problems, and
have recently acquired a 386/33 with a Cyrix FasMath coprocessor rated at 
25mhz which also works well.

I suspect the problem lies in the method the motherboard uses to access the
coprocessor.  As I recall there was a bug in some boards (not just the irq
13/15 thing) that accessed coprocessors in a "non-standard" (whatever that
means) manner.  Perhaps this might be considered as well.

And, it was also mentioned before that without knowing the brand of coproc,
we can't automatically assume that it's compatible with Linux, just because
it works under DOs.  And - remember DOS doesn't use the coproc by default,
only apps compiled to use a coprocessor use it.  Everything else ignores its
presence.

 Right I had a better look at SCSI Howto and the suggestion of

 disable : Bios support for more then 2 disk 

 worked.

 Now I have another query, as I logged in as root to check what linux fdisk
 reports about my hard disk. I have a 1GB SCSI disk which has 500 MB primary
 and 200 MB extended partition, but I am suprised as to how fdisk reports the
 devices - namely it reports 3 devices in use

            Boot   Begin   Start   End   Blocks   Id
 /dev/sda1   *      1       1     500    511984   6
 /dev/sda2         501     501    700    204880   5
 /dev/sda5         501     501    700    204784   6

 under the 'x' option of fdisk

  Nr   AF  Hd  Sec  Cyl  Hd   Sec  Cyl  Start   Size     Id
  1    80  1   1      0  63    32  499      32 1023968    06
  2    0   0   1    500  63    32  699 1024000  409600    05
  3    0   0   0      0   0     0    0       0       0    0
  4    0   0   0      0   0     0    0       0       0    0
  5    0   1   1    500  63    32  699      32  409568    06


 I have a disk with 64 heads, 32 sectors per track, 1001 cylinders

 What is the /dev/sda5 ? 
 I suspect boot record for Extended partition ....

 Why is a device dedicated for this ?

 Why only 5 scsi devices ? 
  i.e why not 7 ?

 Finally how are the Block sizes worked out in relation to the heads, sectors,
 cylinders allocated ?

 Which ? device, apart from /dev/sda1, should I be addressing to when using
 mtools and wanting to access what would be my D: drive on DOS i.e the
 extended partition.

 Thanks for any help.
