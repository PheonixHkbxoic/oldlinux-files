Roberto,

     I'm with you:  the spec sheets leave out some important details, and for
that reason I spent months monitoring the net and talking with ATI before I 
bought my Pro.  But I did end up with a good card.
 
     To run in 1280x1024 mode non-interlaced (74 Hz) or to run with true 
(24-bit) color in any mode, you need to have at least the 68875 RAMDAC.  This 
chip supports a 135 MHz pixel clock, and I believe you need a 110 MHz pixel
clock to run 1280x1024x256 at 74Hz.  The less expensive Pros ship with the 
68830 RAMDAC which only supports pixel clocks of up to 80 MHz.  Also (in case 
your considering buying a Plus), I believe you need VRAM (i.e. a Pro) to 
support the faster refresh rate.  The Plus uses DRAM, and because of that will
only do 1280x1024 at 87 Hz "interlaced" (true scan rate is 43.5 Hz).
 
Philip,

     If your interests in a graphics card don't include 1280x1024 mode and 
don't include the true-color modes (24-bits per pixel), then either the
68830 or the 68875 RAMDAC should work fine for you (including for 
800x600x256).  Otherwise, you need to make sure you get at least a 68875.

Hope this helps guys.  If not, feel free to contact me at my e-mail address
below or send mail to ATI Customer Support at:

Date: 30 Oct 1993 19:17:10 GMT

        I'm in the market for a used cdrom drive which works with linux,
but before I buy it I need some information.  Are there any cdroms available
for Linux other than distributions like the Yggrasil(sp?) cdrom?  I mean,
are there any cd's like the ones DOS has, like atlases, games, and the like?
        I hear that Linux has utilities which would let me play audio cd's
through it, but if that's all it can do other than having a distribution
in it, it's a mighty expensive cd player(~$200).  
        If anyone can give me information on the existence of such non-
distribution cdroms, it will be much appreciated.

Did you read the ad? It states that SLS Linux runs all DOS and WINDOWS
programs. Once people pay Peter and get SLS they find out it is not true.
He's trying to pass off SLS as Linux. People who buy it will blame Linux
for all the broken things on SLS. This leaves the issue of whether he is
upholding the GPL.

Try my CxPatch 0.15 available on sunsite.  As I posted before, I get
the following results when the cache is properly enabled:

Cx486DRx2-20/40  ---> 13.10 BogoMips (tm)

You should be getting at least 15-16 BogoMips on your box..  The fact
that you aren't says that the chip cache isn't enabled.

If you can wait a couple of days, version 0.2 of CxPatch should be up.
It features pl11+ config file compatibility, and support for machines whose
BIOS doesn't set the 386 CR0 register up correctly.

A friend down the hall and I have our Linux boxes ethernetted in
the dorm.  The other guys computer, a 486 DX2 with a 250MB disk,
serves as the server, while my 386/25 mounts its disk.  We share
binaries by making use of a /common directory.  On "Xenon", the 486,
directory structures were moved into the /common, and a link was
placed in the original location.  For example, /usr/bin was moved,
as well as /usr/src and /usr/local and most of the rest of /usr.
On "Quark", the 386, Xenon's /common was mounted, and the same links
were placed.  It is not as fast as having the binaries on a local
disk, but I have been perfectly satisfied with the speed.
Linux really needs an "automounter" similar to the Sun automounter
to make NFS networking more reliable and smooth.

Also, NIS is missing, so common password files are a pain.  I am
interested in knowing how your venture works out.

I agree but would add:

4) BE POLITE when you correct misposters. Dis ain't alt.flame, folks.

I've spent a lot of time playing net.cop, and it's taken me a while
to realize that all but the most truly brain-dead are just as
likely to respond to a polite correction as to a rude one,
and a lot more likely to stay interested in the group.

A well- stated correction sent to each user who misposts means
we get *ONE MISPOST PER CONFUSED PERSON* instead of several.
Since it is impossible to guarantee users won't mispost at least
once (since they may not read the group first), we need to
get as much mileage as possible out of that first correction
which is sent to them. And remember, they may tell coworkers
and friends who later install Linux how to properly
get along in the Linux community.

HI everybody,

I don't know if this question was in this group before, but I want to
know if I can use MS Windows programms in the LINUX X-windows
environment.

As far as I know I have pointed out, I can run DOS progs out of the
environment in a virtuel DOS session.

I hope I don't have to quit LINUX , reboot the system under DOS and
start MS Windows to use these Windows-Progs. This would be boring and
would expect me to quit a good OS to run MS-Windows.

Well I want to mention here, that acces to Internet cost also a lot
of money. Here are some prices from NLnet (Dutch service company):

connection: $15,= a month
netnews   : $15,= a month

when connection time above 20h/month: $1.25 per hour
and that is excluding phonebill.
SLIP  single fee of $500.=

downloading from for instance tsx-11.mit.edu:

less than 25 Mb/month............$100,= a month
less than 100 Mb/month............$150,= a month
less than 250 Mb/month............$250,= a month
less than 500 Mb/month............$375,= a month
less than 1000 Mb/month............$625,= a month
less than 2000 Mb/month............$1000,= a month
above 2000 Mb/month  $0.50 per Mbyte

when downloading more than agreed in your contract: $1.25 per Mbyte

So if you plan to get SLS1.04 (already there????) you would pay

1 month connection:  $  15,=
100 Mb/month:        $ 150,=
30 floppies          $  45,=
                    ---------
                     $ 210,=

and thats comparable to what Peter is billing you....
But then you would have a quarterly subscription to either CDROM or 
tape or floppie.

Fortunately I'm a PhD student, and the university is offering me
such a connection for free. For security reasons our computing center
also decided to let their modems call back. so no phonebill either.

So thats why linux is around here sometimes mentioned as a student's unix.

By default the top bit set characters are those found on the Latin-1 set
(or as near a translation as matches).  You have two choices, convert
your files to use these characters, or place the console in PC graphics mode.

I'd recommend the first approach but as I guess you want the latter you can
send the following:

        ^[)U            - To select IBM display set
        ^[)0            - To return to default set

        ^N              - To enable graphics
        ^O              - To disable graphics

        (Where ^ indicates control)

i.e use: ^[)U           - To initilise
       : ^N             - Before your graphics
       : ^O             - After your graphics
       : ^[)0           - To restore

Note: there are some characters that won't print, those with the following
      decimal values:  0, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 27

I may have some of the above wrong, (if so I'm sure someone will correct me),
but give it a go.

(Note followups)

I got stuck with the linux installation.
When I did a doinstall command, I got the following messages.
 VFS: Can't find an ext2fs filesystem on dev 0x0302
 mount: worng fs type, /dev/hda2 already mounted, /root busy, or other
        error
 error: can not mount /dev/hda2. Did you use mke2fs -c /dev/hda2 SIZE
  where SIZE is the number of blocks shown by fdisk?

I did go back to fdisk to verify the block numbers and run 
mke2fs and doinstall again, but I still get the same error messages.  

I don't know if this matter, but I got the following messages
whenever I run "mke2fs -c /dev/hda2 SIZE", 
"Block log size = 0" and "Fragment log size = 0"
It also happens for other partition such as "mke2fs -c /dev/hda4 SIZE"
where size corresponds to the block size from fdisk.

Any suggestion will be appreciated!

Another question I have in mind is if there is any communication 
software, preferably in pd, available for linux that I can use
to dial into school ?  

Thanks in advance.
