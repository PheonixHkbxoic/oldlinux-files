Hi people.
I'm a fanatic Windows user, I don't have much to do here.  I think Linux is
a great thing (all freeware is), but that's not why I'm posting.
I'm am a player of a MUD system called "2 Kingdoms MUD", which is installed
on a 386 running Linux.  I'm sad to say that although it seems MUCH faster
than most Unix varieties, the networking sucks.
The place splis into a comatose state about every one minute, imposing a delay
of about 15 seconds on everybody playing.  sometimes the whole system crashes,
and sometimes it won't get up.
Maybe you can help those guys.  The MUD implementor is genie@soda.berkeley.edu,
and from what I've heard he's very frustrated with Linux and he wants to change
OSes - maybe he'll go NT ;-) (Don't flame, I don't read this newsgroup).
If you guys can help him network it'll be your break.  Last news I've heard is
that he's looking for a new site.
Just thougt you'd like to know,
Yossi.
PS if your into MUD RPGs, the site is at 192.31.153.157 4000.

3.95!  I assume it's because the memory is now interleaved, but the
strange part is I hadn't enabled interleaving yet.  When I enabled
interleave, nothing changed, still 3.95 BogoMips.

Is it possible to set uid on shell scripts in Linux?  (Yes, security,
I know).  It works nicely on BSD, you can even set it on SCO, but SCO
will just ignore it when you try to execute the script (apparantly for
security reasons, I am told).  How will it work on Linux?

Subject: [Q] Comtrol "Smart Hostess" serial card under Linux?
Date: 27 Oct 1993 21:28:57 GMT


Greetings,

   I recently picked up a Comtrol "Smart Hostess" card (older rev A card)
and am hoping to get it working under Linux.  I've looked through the FAQ,
HOWTO's, Device lists, etc and I see that the Smart Hostess isn't currently
supported under Linux.

   My question is: is anyone working/planning on getting a Smart Hostess
(or any other Comtrol serial card) up and running under Linux?  There seems
to be a fair amount of techie/programming information in the User's Guide
so I would imagine that it's in the realm of possibility.  (I've done a
fair share of hardware & low level software development -- it's mostly a
matter of finding the time to write the driver :-)

   Does anyone run a Smart Hostess card under any other operating systems?
(Yes, I know this is a Linux newsgroup, but I'm looking for any/all info :-)

   I also have some Smart Hostess specific questions.  I've talked with
the folks at Comtrol (they were *very* nice and *very* helpful).  They
answered some questions, but most of the stuff they have is for the newer
cards or newer versions of older cards (I think the "Smart Hostess" is up
to revision F -- I have rev A circa 1985).  They are going to try dig up
some info about the rev A card and ship it off to me, however I am curious
to know if anyone is running this older card, how it performs, etc...

   advTHANKSance.

Date: Wed, 27 Oct 1993 11:34:41 GMT


I've seen a lot of posts about how bad and evil and ugly SLS is, but I still
don't know what's so bad about it. Most of the FAQs I've read seem to mention
it as one of the major releases; I understand "something went wrong" with SLS,
but I still don't know what, and I'd like to know...

I currently run with SLS, and most things seem to work, although I don't do
much with Linux, and I'd tend to blame the non-working parts on my incompetence
as a system administrator...

So, what are the real problems with SLS ? And the advantages of, say,
Slackware ? And are they worth the trouble of changing from one to the other ?

When I run fdisk from dos, the hard drive runs and runs and runs.  However,
fdisk in linux still works.  I am assuming that there is a bug in dos's

No. However, if you want the equivalent functionality, just e-mail all
your users the root password and tell them to su to root and run
whatever program you were going to make a suid-root shell
script. That's essentially what you'd be doing if you were to use a
suid-root shell script, it is that big of a security hole.

In other words, find another way (e.g a C program that is suid root
that runs sh on a script file, making sure the environment is cleared,
or doing it all in C).

I was just about to buy this board (although to run it in 800*600*256) 
but now it looks like I should think again. Is there a problem with the 
lower resolution? Is this kludge with the extra chip only for the higher 
resolution? It would be nice to get some answers on these and the above 
questions if there is someone who can help.

Subject: TERM problems- Please help!
Date: Thu, 28 Oct 1993 04:04:24 GMT

Anyone have any clues on this one:

Here's the details:
o  On Monday, term was working fine
o  On Monday night, shutdown the system properly, powered down for the night.
o  On Tuesday morning, term doesn't work.  It just sits there and hangs,
   nothing appears to go over the serial line (no flashing lights on the modem)
o  On Wednesday, term still doesn't work..     

What I did:
o  Something hung?  Check /usr/spool/uucp for lock files, ps -ax for other
   processes..  nothing wrong..  Reboot.  Same problem.
o  Perhaps my autoterm script isn't working anymore..  try it manually:
     - dial from kermit, term on remote, ^Z suspend, term </dev/cua1 >/dev/cua1
       Nothing..  same problem
     - Try an experiment:  On remote 'sz bigfile', ^Z suspend, on local
       'rz </dev/cua1 >/dev/cua1'.  Works fine..  Try it with sending files-
       also works, so it's not the I/O system
o  Perhaps network configuration got changed, new escape sequences needed-
     - modify termrc's to escape all control chars (0-31 and 128-159)
       Still doesn't work.
     - use my own line checking program- everything is fine no new escapes
     - change everything back
o  Try a completely different remote host with different architecture, in
   different building, on different subnet, different everything- Still
   doesn't work.
o  Perhaps file got corrupted, restored backup from tape- same checksum, same
   size, when you replaced the current version with the backup, same thing,
   term just freezes.
o  Perhaps libraries changed- recompile.  New file has same checksum, same size
   same problem.
o  Repeat the above two on Linux box..  no go in either case.
o  Maybe my Linux libraries got scrambled somehow
     - Restore libc.so.4, libc.so.4.X.X from install disks
     - restore libc.a, libc.sa from install disks
     - Nothing..  nada..  zip!
o  Check all permissions in /dev/- everything fine.
o  Check for modified files in directory structure.  There are some (utmp,
   wtmp, .history, things like that) but none that would cause term to fail
   completely.
o  Maybe my hardware died (don't know how it would do this and still let
   me log in normally using kermit, etc, but who knows)
     - Replace UART chip.  Still nothing
     - Use other port on same board.  Still nothing
     - Replace with a brand new board.  Still nothing.
     - Try modem with no error correction, at 2400 baud.  Nothing.
     - Try different 2400 baud only modem- still nothing.
     - Turn off turbo button (bus speed now 8MHz).  Still nothing
     - Disable cache.  Still nothing.

I'm out of options and I'm seriously thinking of doing a complete re-install.
Does anyone else have any ideas about what's wrong before I try re-installing?
You can assume that I remembered to change the termrc file on both sides
and did proper shutdowns and reboots for any procedures above that need these,
if I've neglected to put in the fact.

I'm convinced that my machine is somehow at fault, since I tried it with
two different remote hosts, with different OS and both times, term failed.
If I turn on term's packet tracing, I see messages to the effect of "put XXX
(total in queue) in sendQ", and each time the total increases, it never goes
down.  It appears that data never gets sent out.  But why?  I've recompiled,
that doesn't help, everything else on the system seems to work fine.  The
only thing I can think of is to turn back the clock to Monday's date and
see if things work again..  (if it does, I'll have to take my Linux disks
to the shredder and a hammer to my computer)

I'm getting pretty desparate here..  I need term so I can view my correlation
graphs and my maple and matlab plots over the modem, so I can get news, etc..
Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks
