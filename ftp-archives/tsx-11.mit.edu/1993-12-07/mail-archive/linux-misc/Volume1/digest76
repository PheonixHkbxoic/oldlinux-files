I bought my SLS distribution from him because he resells motif.  He has been
supportive, although not a wizard.  He, like I, initially thought that my
TIGA graphics adaptor would work with xfree86 because it provides a VGA bios.
The softeware was delivered in a timely fashion, and was a version or so 
behind the current on the net (SLS 99pl6 w.99pl9 kernel), but he should be
shipping an upgraded version in a week or so.

When i use 'a' or 'i' protocols I get only a poor 500 cps on my GVC 14.4K
v42bis modem. When i use 'g' protocols the same file transfer rise up to
1650 cps. I've found that the main difference is in the time spent
inbetween to file transfer. Both three protocols go to about the same speed
but 'i' and 'a' take a lot of time to switch from one file to the next one
they are receiving or sending. I dont know why maybe someone can help me?

Why 'a' and 'i' are waiting sow long beetwenn to files ? Is there something
I can do? The more file i have to transfer and the smaller they are the
longuer it take to do it

Where can I find more info about these protocols?

thanks

wondering if there is something out there for Linux which will work.
I don't really want to run any DOS programs.  But I need to do this

Subject: ideas for FAQs and printed LDP books
Date: 31 Aug 93 00:58:00 MDT

First, a suggestion about the FAQs...  I installed Linux a couple weeks ago,
and the most confusing thing about all of the FAQs was trying to find out if
I had the most current one.  It would be nice if every faq/infosheet/metafaq
had a last-revision date at the very top.  Also, it would be nice if the one
main meta-faq had a list of all of the faqs with the most current dates for
each.  This should be distributed in such a way that it is obvious that it
should be read first (e.g. on the ftp sites, give it a title like
"read_first_meta_faq" or something like that.

Second... since it is so expensive to get copying done at kinkos for LDP books,
has anyone looked into going to a real publisher?  Also, if you do get the 
copies done at kinkos, it should be possible to shrink each page to half-size
and have 4 pages per sheet of paper, then have it cut and bound (or even 
stapled).  This way, it would only cost .11 * 37 = $4.  If you leave out the
binding and special covers, it should cost less than $5 including the staples
and cutting.  Add a buck profit and a buck for shipping, and its only $7.
I bet a lot of people would like to have a cheaper, more temporary copy until
things settle down a bit and don't change so much so quickly.

And lastly, I'd like to say that everyone should get a copy of "Linux 
Installation and Getting Started" if they are new to Linux.  It was the most
helpful guide for me for installing Linux.

>Yes, but do you have anything as nice as a Borland IDE?

Yes, and even better, IMHO: Gnu Emacs. Emacs parses your error
messages just like the Borland IDE does, popping up the source file
with the cursor right on the error. Emacs can also interact with a
debugger, so you can single step through your code just like with the
Turbo debugger. You can step through your code while displaying the
output of your application in another window, be it a graphical or a
text application. With gdb you can even attach to an already running
process.

One thing I dislike about the Borland DOS IDE is that its use is based
so heavily on either pull-down menus or function keys. I don't like
either, menus are slow and function keys are placed so far away on the
keyboard that you tend to rest your palms on the other keys. Function
keys are also so nondescriptive: how do you associate F9 with compile
and F2 with save? Doing something as simple as finding out the value
of a variable in the debugger makes my blood pressure go up. The
gdb command line interface much better in this respect: just type
'p var <RET>' to get the value printed.

Finding tags is also an invaluable feature of Emacs, which I don't
think has found its way to the Borland IDE yet. Emacs also has a
seamless interface to the RCS revision control system.

Personally I also hate the "Wordstar" editor in the IDE, but this is a
matter of personal taste (and the bindings can be redefined, I know).
But still I think Emacs is a more powerful editor.

Ok, the Borland IDE has some good points, like the built in project
management, which is perhaps a little bit nicer to use than doing it
by hand with makefiles. And the syntactic coloring in the Windows
version is nice too. Emacs also does not have a GUI builder, but
that's not built in into the Borland IDE either.

Just for fun, I compiled the fileutils package both with static and
dynamic linking.  The total disk usage of cp, dd, ln, ls, mkdir, mv,
rm was 72 kB when linked dynamically, 558 kB when linked statically.
I think the difference is large enough that many people do not with to
have statically linked programs if they can avoid it.  For
installation floppies, there is not chance of being able to fit the
statically linked copies in there.

There is, however, absolutely nothing that prevents you from
installing statically linked copies on your own system if you want.

It's not supported now, and I'm unclear what's going to happen with
DTC.

One user offered to write a driver, and I pointed him at the SCSI driver
manual and suggested that Eric and I were  usually willing to answer
technical questions. He mailed back a few days later after asking DTC
for programming documentation saying that the person he spoke to said 

"We don't give that sort of information out to the general public"

Front line support personel don't usually encounter these requests, 
and aren't always aware of the documentation that's available to 
programmers.  Because of this, it took me six months of trying to get 
anything out of Seagate since I didn't have a contact outside of 
the tech. support department.

Another user spoke with marketing at DTC, rather than tech. support, 
and was told the DTC was willing to discuss support (including 
financial) for Linux drivers development for their boards.  

This is not disimilar to the interaction developers have had with 
other companies, and I hope that it will be resolved favorably for
Linux users.

That was the first Unix OS I saw 12 years ago: 8086 Microsoft Xenix.
On an original IBM AT 286 with 6 MHz and 512 KB RAM and an originally 
20 MB IBM harddisk. 10 MB DOS, 10 MB Xenix ... and we didn't get rogue 
compiled with it ;-)

There were 2 Xenix versions available for PC's one from MS and one
from SCO. SCO later offered 80286 versions...laster 80386 versions,
where only 20% of the programs were 80386 code, the rest still
remained 80286 and 8086 code (games, dwb, ...).
SCO Xenix / Unix was a beast  .....

The microsoft C-Compiler was a shame for C Compiler ... Years later I got 
an Xenix System V. I remember situations where the compiler complains about 
"structure too complicate, please simplify ..."

Unix is a complex system.  Expecting new users to be able to check
what file is referred to by a symlink in a situation when even an
expert might (in a moment of foolishness) assume that it had been set
up correctly is foolhardy, not to say negligent.

You haven't even quoted the advice properly - it said /dev/zero.
If you dd from /dev/hdan to /dev/hdam your disk will make a horrible
noise which will make you want to stop it straight away.

I agree with everything that Matt said in his previous posting.

I won't say any more as I'd be likely to merely inflame this
discussion further.

Actually you are probably correct. MS-Windows isn't really an OS at all. For

Subject: Re: Stacker-like Compression?
Date: 31 Aug 1993 11:42:44 GMT

I may be a little dumb on this issue:

How did Stacker do the job? And why can't we do the same?

As mentioned in a previous post only certain files are relevant for
compressing (i.e. doc-files, rarely used files).

In my oppinion it should be possible to make a device driver that could
present all files ending in a .gz as a normal file system. Like this:


  dir1---------+subdir11-------+file111
               |               |file112.gz
               |               +file113
               |
               +subdir12-------+file121.gz
                               +file122.gz

  dir2---------+subdir21-------+file211.gz
               |               +file212
               |
               +subdir22-------+file221


  compressdir--+dir1-----------+subdir11-------+file112
               |               |
               |               +subdir12-------+file121
               |                               +file122
               |
               +dir2-----------+subdir21-------+file221
                               |
                               +subdir22

I hope you see what I mean: All those files that end in .gz is found in the
compressdir WHITHOUT the .gz. If you create a file: /comressdir/dir1/file11,
then the file actually created is: /dir1/file11.gz. The /compress is only some
sort of presentation dir. If you access a file within the compressdir
then file will be decompressed and if altered - recompressed. I know this
scheme will not be very quick, but it should be relatively easy to implement
(as far as I see it).

I hope you get my point.
