Is this sufficient?  This is what I have now (in a 486/33), and I'm thinking
about Linux, but I was worried that I needed more memory for X.  OS/2 2.1 runs
ok on it-- how does Linux generally compare?  Anyone?

The problems are caused by the way __attribute__ is handled.  You should
change one file (I think):

  linux/include/linux/kernel.h:   Lines 31-40 should read like this
                                  (sans the begin and end markers, of course):
---begin---
#if __GNUC__ < 2 || __GNUC_MINOR__ < 5
# define NORET(x) __volatile__ x
#else
# define NORET(x) x
#endif

extern void math_error(void);
void panic(const char * fmt, ...)
        __attribute__ ((format (printf, 1, 2), noreturn));
void do_exit(long error_code) __attribute__ ((noreturn));
---end---

The problems are that 1) attributes shoud only be given at declaration
time, not definition, and 2) multiple attributes must all be given within
the same __attribute__(()).

No FTP access?

YOU can still get linux.

Just fire up 'yer 14.4k modem and dial (215) 489-9732 and get into file
section #23 for close to 40 megs of Linux stuff.  We have the complete SLS
online.  Also, lots of other goodies... lots of current stuffs, also.

This is a public service to help spread Linux.  This system has a NO UPLOADS
EVER REQUIRED policy... and if you leave a message to me, the sysop, I can
even set it up for you (with a high speed modem, of course) to grab Linux
in one big session, if you are so inclined.

No restrictions: I will work WITH YOU to get Linux into your hands.  No 
postal service disk-swapping transactions, though, I simply don't have the 
time... but I will give you all the access you need to get Linux from calling 
the number of the BBS in this message.

Date: Mon, 15 Nov 1993 03:34:26 GMT

I've seen this in the FAQ, however, greping through it I cannot find the
answer.

I have installed 0.99.13p. I have also added memory to bring my system from
8Meg to 20Meg.  I am running GCC 2.4.5 which I compiled from the original
sources.

Now, occasionally, GCC gives up reporting "Internal error - received a
signal 11". This never happened when I was running 0.99.13. It appears to
be some sort of memory problem. The only cure currently is to reboot.

Any ideas? This is a minor problem, but annoying. Where should I start
looking?

Adaptec 1542b, and it works fine. And has worked from the first
installation.

I am not suggesting that the IN2000 card is junk, just the Linux driver. In
have contact Always for developer information so that I MIGHT fix the
driver, but have not heard back from them.

If you are in a rush, buy an Adaptec SCSI card.

My apologies for the format of this message.  I really am quite a bit of a
tyro at this, and know it....

HELP!  I have successfully managed to get SLIP on Linux slackware
communicating with the University of
Texas network.  I have managed to compile a version of trn (2.2) which
communicates directly with the mailserver here to read newsgroups.  I am
not, however, able to send and receive email--the instructions I've been
given don't seem to be very helpful.

The problem is, the UT-Net people don't seem to be too familiar with the
requirements of a Linux user--they expect you're going to use a MACINTOSH or
a DOS system with provided SLIP software.

Can anybody here at the University of Texas at Austin contact me by phone?
I'd like to get together with someone who might be able to give me a few
pointers on setting up something a little better kluged.  Mail and news
daemons, etc.

Please call me voice at (512) 206-0370, a local number here in Austin,
Texas.  Please leave a message on the answering machine if you don't get
me--I'll be happy to return your call!

Please disregard any .sig information, as it's probably from the system

I've got acces to a number of these...
Ptf is very good... you look for what you need in the index and then you are
pointed to a CONSISTANT package, (ptf also markets other CDs for AI,
Unixware (if you need an SDK)... e-mail to them they can EVEN provide
poitners elsewhere.

Infomagic is making assorted specialist collections, which compliment
other packages.... not so easy to use, but a much better than searching
the net for something that MIGHT be there... I've also read that Infomagic
is selling a regual dump of tsx.11 and sunsite linux areas.

I have to agree, I have a Sun IPX with 32mb along side a 486DX2-50 with
16mb, and it's hard to tell the difference on most tasks, and Linux is
considerably faster for most disk intensive operation, no doubt due to
the extensive buffering.  In general, I think the performance of Linux
on reasonable hardware is very respectable.  Now, if I could only get
the networking stuff working a bit more reliably... :-)

Hello Linuxers:

I have a laptop with a Cirrus Logic CLGD 6420 chipset SVGA card. I
don't have any docs on it but XFree86 apparently does not support it
yet. What is my best option to get X running on my Linux box? I tried
running in the VGA2 generic monochrome mode, but, startx complains
that it cannot find the mouse and gives the message: "Failed to
initialize core devices" or something to that effect. Could someone
guide me through starting X up on my machine? BTW, I think I have a
PS/2 mouse hooked into a PS/2 mouse port and therefore my links are
        /dev/mouse -> /dev/ps2aux 
and the Mouse config line in /usr/lib/X11/Xconfig is 
        ps/2    "/dev/mouse".

What am I doing wrong?

I do not currently receive this newsgroup, so, please send to 
mahadev@erc.msstate.edu. I get only 'comp.os.linux.announce' and
'alt.os.linux'.

I have been having problem using "sysinstall -disk" whenever I want install
packages from my floppy drive.  Whenever I run it, it prompts me to put a
disk in the drive. When I put a disk containing the package that I want to
install, it doesn't even
recognize the drive, no access light or anything. After putting a disk
in the drive and pressing the ENTER key, it will prompt me 3 times to put a
disk in the drive, I keep pressing return at each prompt,
and then it (sysinstall) just exits after the third time.

Normally I boot off of the floppy that was created after I finished the
installation process ( I installed the entire Linux package).
Booting from that disk I always encounter the problem. However,
strangely I ran a test and booted off of the "a1" installation disk, and
tried to run "sysinstall -disk" and it work just fine as far as recognizing
the floppy drive and all.

Any help is greatly appreciated!
