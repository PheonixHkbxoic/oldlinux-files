Even though the margin of error on this is pretty wide, it is the first time 
that I've heard numbers to indicate it's possible that, out of the 80000+
estimated subscribers to comp.os.linux (back in August just before the split)
it may be possible that around half may be actually using or running a live
Linux system.

Bear in mind, users != systems.

sources: the number 80000+ came from the monthly UseNet Readership report
at the same time as the Linux newsgroup split.  It takes time for readership
numbers to stabilize after a split so I'm not inclined to use the latest
report.

Yes, it does (I have this at home).  However, X will not necessarily
recognize its chipset.  Set the chipset to CLGD5426 in your Xconfig
if you have this problem.

By the way, I hear Genoa is coming out with a VRAM card soon.

Subject: mktemp() problem
Date: 23 Oct 1993 09:50:04 GMT


Hello all,

  I got a problem while writing a program using mktemp().
Here is the source :

#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
void main()
{
  char *fmt="tmpXXXXXX", *out;
  
  out = mktemp(fmt);
  if (out != NULL)
    printf("%s\n", out);
  else
    printf("Fail!\n");
}

The program always got segmentation fault when I ran it from command line,
but... it worked ok when I used gdb to trace it.
I don't know what's wrong with it. Is the problem come from the compiler or
the system ? Or it is becase I misuse the function ?

Thanks for any help

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other

Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.

I hope you sent your fixes to Peter MacDonald or to Patrick Volkerdinger,
so that we all will benefit from your work? I'd be interested you get your
changes to the default distribution. We will need a secure system here,
since we don't know every user here...

We will have about 200 users here that will log on over 7 modems, a couple

Subject: Can I alter LILO to boot from sector 15?
Crossposted-To: comp.os.linux
Date: 23 Oct 93 07:50:18 GMT

Hey, Linuxers.  I just got a ~330MB ESDI Hard drive, used. It's a
Miniscribe, and came (even when new) with lots of bad sectors.  The
thing is, it appears that the first 14 sectors of the disk are bad, so
that the first (a.k.a.  /dev/hda1) partition (Linux: I have no DOS
partition) has to boot starting at sector 15 (from running fdisk).
Apparently, LILO doesn't like this, because when I run /etc/lilo/lilo,
it says something like 'Warning, first partition does not have valid
partition information in 1st sector'.

In the DOS world, if you have an (otherwise) good hard drive except
that the first sector happens to be bad, you can use 'Disk Manager'
which will low and high-level format the drive, and install a driver
so that you can actually move where it looks for the boot sector, so
you can still use the drive.  I have used this successfully.  Is there
an equivalent way of handling this problem with LILO?  That is, how
can I tell it that it is okay to boot from sector 15?  (I have made
sure with fdisk that /dev/hda1 is *bootable, but to no avail.  It just
hangs).  Is there any way to reconfigure LILO so that the boot sector
is relocated?  I took a quick look at the docs (user's and technical
ref manuals) for LILO, couldn't find anything..

Thanx in advance.

This is the old "const string" problem. mktemp modifies its argument
string by replacing the X's with some other chars. This fails in your
program since 'fmt' is a pointer variable pointing to a constant
string. GCC puts text strings in the text segment which isn't writable
in Linux and the result is a core dump. This behaviour is allowed by
the C standard.

The right thing to do is to change the declaration of fmt to this:

static char fmt[] = "tmpXXXXXX";

which declares it as a char array initialized to "tmpXXXXXX".

The problem can also be circumvented with the GCC option
-fwritable-strings, but I wouldn't recommend using this for new code.

Ok. But there is no generic solution to where to put the extra
sectors. Where do you put them if you can't put them in the sectors
following the MBR? You would have to repartition your disk to exclude
some sectors from the partitions to be safe. I don't see this as an
improvement to using a separate small partition for this purpose, like
the OS/2 boot manager does. Ok, you lose a partition, but this is not
a big problem on Linux, since Linux can use extended partitions.

It's a modern machine all right: ICL 486CX33. And you *can* store the
disk geometry in the CMOS RAM, but the BIOS setup also includes a
setting called "Auto" which tells the BIOS to read the geometry from
the disk. This feature is quite handy: when something zaps your CMOS
RAM you just choose "Auto" and get the disk geometry from the most
logical place: the disk itself. Avoid the hassle with disk types,
sectors, cylinders and heads etc. Of course, this assumes the geometry
is recorded on the disk, but there's always the "standard" way, if
this isn't the case.

Hello,

I would like to perform some benchmarks on my system (486DX2/66) running

I wonder if someone could point me where to find the program (programs?)

1. DHRYSTONES  (for integers num.)
2. WHEATSTONES (for floating num.)
3. XSTONES     (for graphics)

or something similar but comprehensive.

I would second this.  If Linux allows the use of any app, be it a commercial
binary-only or a free copylefted one, it can only do more to help advance Linux.
 After all, what good is it if no one uses it?  No matter how good Linux can
be/is, it has to have a market.  Look at Geoworks for an example of a super
great program that went noware.  People didn't get/use it because there were no
"commercial" apps for it.  Even though it wiped the earth with all the other DOS
GUI's.

If Linux and the Linux community will allow for vendors to port their products
in Bin-only distributions to compliment the GNU/Free apps that are being done,
it can only be good for Linux and everyone.

Later,
Joe

My current understanding is if you ship a binary that uses the shared
libraries you meet the requirement that the user be able to upgrade
his library code and incorporate the changes back into your app. IE 
if you replace the library shared image you effectively 're-link'
your proprietary application against the new library. This is a Good
Thing.

Yes. My personal observation is that people who contribute alot to
Linux do not mind commericial use of Linux. (Within the terms of the
GPL and other applicable copyrights) No one (who matters ;-) is going
to flame you for distributing a proprietary application for Linux as
long as you respect the GPL. Metrolink distributes Motif for Linux.
I've seen nothing but praise for their work.

The ibcs project will allow SCO binaries to run on Linux. Commericial
applications have already run (sort of ;-) on Linux.

No flame here.a
