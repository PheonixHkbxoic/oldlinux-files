Subject: SVGA cards that work w/ Linux

I just read a recently posted article on hardware that was supported by Linux.
I didn't notice any video cards in that posting.  

I currently have a Swan VGA/16 w/ 1MEG ram (Tseng ET4000) that works with just
about every application known to mankind.  Unfortunately my 1024x768 mode is
screwed up.  I get a snowy effect whenever I am in that mode (it's not a monitor
problem) which is very VERY annoying.

Needless to say I am looking for a new video card.  I was looking at the Xconfig
file and noticed that only the ET4000, ET3000, pvga, and something else was
supported by Linux.  Does Cirrus Logic work w/ Linux?? 

I'm seriously considering an Orchid Prodesigner II or maybe the Fahrenheit VA ..

I'm looking for some suggestions, comments, or whatever else you all might have
to say about a good video board for <= $200 .

Thanks,
Pierce

Hi, Linuxers!

Here's a fix for the paper problems people in the US have had
with the Postscript version of my Noworking Guide. When 
converting the DVI file to Postscript, I was not aware that
produces A4 output even if the dvi file is in Letter format.
*shrug!*


This is a unified patch. To apply this patch,
go to the directory where you keep the nag.ps file, save everything
after the "-- cut here --" line to a file (e.g. named diff), and
execute
        patch < diff

If there are still problems, mail me at okir@monad.swb.de

   Where is the connection here?  Is there some innate physical law in the
universe that says "Thou Shalt Have Morals?"  Not in any of my textbooks,
at least.  Corporations are business organizations that, for the purpose
of easing the lives of lawyers, are considered to be unique entities.
Corporations don't exist to make people happy, make the world a better place
to live, or anything other than to make money for shareholders.  Sometimes
they work, and sometimes they don't - just as in any other aspect of
human endeavor.

   Which implies that you have documention that Microsoft has consistently
enaged in illegal practices.  References, please?  And I assume that you know
the difference between civil and criminal suits.

   Define 'fair.'  Why do I suspect that it means "Whatever benefits me and
the things that I'm interested in?"

>Perhaps your attitude is one of the problems with
>Corporate America, a total lack of morals and ethics...

   Once again you refer to morals and ethics.  I hate to tell you, but there
is no absolute system of morals and ethics in the Universe.  You're
advocating, in essence, the welfare-state mentality.  You want to be
protected from what you percieve as the Bad People in the world.  You say
that I have no morals and ethics?  On the contrary - I have a much higher
sense of morals and ethics than most people I know - primarily because
I've taken the time to consider what I believe in rather than blindly
accepting the pablum the average consumer is spoon-fed and then spitting it
back out again and pretending that it's my own.  My primary belief is that
I, and ONLY I, am responsible for who I am and what I do.  And I do
nothing, that as far as I can see, will damage the people around me.  I
firmly believe that if more people felt the same way, life would be
infinitely better for the rest of us.

   As this thread has gotten *completely* away from relevence to this
group, all followups to mail, please.

Subject: Will Linux run MSDOS applications (which use DMA/interrupts)?
Date: 3 Sep 1993 13:31:51 -0500

We like everything I've heard/read about Linux, and we are considering
installing it on our PeeCees here.  However, we have some reservations ...
We're hoping somebody in these newsgroups can clear this up for us.

We have several MSDOS applications which use add-on DSP/A-to-D boards and
we don't want to lose this functionality if we convert to the Linux
environment. 

(1) How does Linux deal with MSDOS applications?  Is it reliable?
    Can it support real-time applications such as A/D and D/A?
(2) Will any special drivers need to be written/installed for Linux to 
    run MSDOS applications which do low-level I/O?  If so, I assume that
    software like this is application-specific.  Is this correct?
(3) If the DOS emulator currently won't handle these situations, is there
    work underway to address this, or am I hoping for too much from Linux?

Thanks for any and all info.

   Of course there is typically no good systems administrator - how many
businesses REALLY need one and can afford it?  Not many.  As for treating
the computers like phones or calculators - this is *exactly* how they
should be treated.  A phone is a tool for audio communication.  A 
calculator is a tool for quick computations.  A computer is merely a more
general-purpose tool that solves some problems very well but more often
is used as an inappropriate solution for a trival need.

   Correct - but the term 'evil' was in fact used by several other people
in this, and similar, threads.

   Personally, I ignore the legal definition and consider Microsoft to
be a monopoly, anyhow, in the *CONSUMER COMPUTER* market.  But try
looking at how that market compares with computing machinery, overall.
Embedded systems.  Corporate information systems.  Military.  Aerospace.
When you consider the industry as a whole, they're not quite so
all-encompassing as people here seem to believe.  As for the stagnation,
I don't have to imagine it.  I can SEE it.  It's here.  But since I
expect nothing else from a monopoly, I work with it in a matter that
benefits me and my family by acting as a consulant for people who
happen to use Microsoft ( and other ) products.  Personally, I don't
care whether Microsoft creates crappy products.  When someone hires
me to solve a problem for them, I solve it no matter *what* it takes -
crappy vendor products or not.  What Microsoft does is the responsibility
of its officers.  What I do is my responsibilty.

   Please refer to my response to Mr. Burton about ethics.  As a side note,
though, this is merely good business practice.  Personally, I wish that I
had come up with a product that millions of people used. :-)

   Please continue through e-mail, as I'm sure that there are fewer
people who are reading this than there are who want to read more about
Linux.  ( But if people do want to see more, well, tell us. :-)

You could always go to a site that archives BSD or NetBSD sources and

Not exactly what you are asking for, but if you use X11 then you can
get similar functionality by using xfig to produce your graphics and
then translate the resulting `fig' output with TransFig. (I have not

do it)

(1) Will *BSD run my Sony CDROM drive (its the Internal one with its own

there are patches for linux to use it...

(2) What are some peoples observances about the differences (people who have
