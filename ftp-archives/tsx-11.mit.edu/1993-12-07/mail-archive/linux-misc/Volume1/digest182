Hmm, 
I was trying to move 22megs from sda to sdb when cp flopped on
an 'i/o error'. 

All my filesystem troubles started when I added a second SCSI

Reply-To: wb8foz@skybridge.scl.cwru.edu (David Lesher)

I've been doing more testing on the tar streaming tape issue.

My tapedrive did stream under 99.04, but under 99.13 the results are
less predictable. It would seeming run fine for a while, then start
'stuttering' I will call it, for lack of a better term.

Kai Makisara (Kai.Makisara@vtt.fi) recommended doing a "mt drvbuffer 1"
to ensure that the tape drive had the buffer enabled. No effect. (In
theory, the drive has 256k buffer, enabled at start-up.) I also tried
various tar buffer setting, i.e.

        tar -ckb26 /  /dos
        tar -ckb256 /  /dos
        tar -ckb1024 /  /dos

This changed things somewhat, but did not cure the problem. It would
still seem to stream along for a while (changing 'b' DID alter both the
period of the stutter and the "while") then stutter.

I finally tumbled onto the clue that it ALWAYS did this while in the dos
filesystem! In fact, it's in the middle of the install directory with
all the SLS distribution ;-}. If I change the command line to be: 
        tar -ckb26 /dos /
it still founders its way through that partition, then flies along
through the root.

Can anyone suggest why the dos filesystem should cause this? It's
generic MS 5.0, not badly fragmented, on the same physical device as
Linux, etc.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

For the short loop used for the delay test, the differences between the SX and
DX are minimized.  For real work it can become more significant, depending on
the instruction mix.  (This belongs in a hardware newsgroup....)

Subject: New Chat System Available
From: morley@suncad.camosun.bc.ca (Mark Morley)

Hi all...

Over the weekend I decided to learn about writing TCP/IP servers.  The
result is a multi-user "real time" chat system I've tentatively named ChatMUD.

This system is similar to IRC, but a lot easier to use (and doesn't
require any special client software).  It is designed around the concept
of a conference center.  When you first connect to it you are in the
"LOBBY".  You can create new rooms on the fly.  When you create a new room
(as opposed to entering someone else's room) you are given a set of keys. 
Whoever holds the keys to a room can lock/unlock the door (make it a
private or public room), change the room's topic and description, invite
others into a private room, etc.  Users can set their name, gender, and a
brief description of themselves.  There is on-line help available at all
times.  Oh yeah, it also has a bunch of built in action verbs (like hug,
slap, tickle, agree, blah, blah, blah) that make conversations a lot mor
interesting.

Check it out by telneting to buckyball.camosun.bc.ca on port 7000.  It's
only a couple days old so I want to hear all bug reports!  If you want the
code I'll make it available via FTP.  It consists of a single .C file and
should compile under most Unix's (I've tried it under Linux and SunOS 4.1.2)

Let me know what you think!

oops, my DX-33 tells me something about having 19.98 ...
and rebooting with turning 'turbo' off I still got 16.61 ...

*knarz* as I said before, BogoMips are lame !

Don't you know, that, if you start Linux on DOS (ROTFL), it deletes all
files with the string 'Microsoft' in it?

Subject: Telebit Trailblazer Plus for sale (repost)
Date: 5 Oct 1993 10:01:59 -0400

I have a Trailblazer Plus in the recent style case, complete with
power brick and brand-new manual which has been upgraded to the latest
ROMs (BC7.00) and as such, has the newer features such as v.42bis
and callback capability.

An ad in UNIX World for Solunet, Inc. advertises the Plus at $518.
I'll sell mine for $250 which includes shipping via UPS ground to anywhere
in the continental US.

The modem flawlessly transfers news and mail all night, every night on 
my Linux box.  I needed v.32bis for other applications, though, and
can't afford a Worldblazer :-(, so I bought an internal Sportster.

I'm crossposting this to comp.os.linux.misc in case any other Linuxers
are looking for this type of modem.

Please let me know if this is an unreasonable price, or if there are better
deals to be had.  I'll consider any reasonable offers, but I'm not going to 
give it away either.  I just don't really need 2 modems on 1 system...
