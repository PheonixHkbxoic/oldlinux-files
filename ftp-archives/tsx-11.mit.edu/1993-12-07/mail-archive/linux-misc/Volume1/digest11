           I've seen AUI+BNC ne2000 clones on sale for ~$60, at area
   retailers.  (I went ahead and bought the SMC though, for $125)

           I've been told that, if you only want two hosts on your network,
   can just run a twisted pair cable between the two hubs.  I've not tried it
   (never having had the hardware or inclination lying around) but it
   sounds reasonable.  Of course, it only works if you've only got TWO hosts
   on your network.

I've connected my Linux box and DOS box with 2 Boca BEN100 ethernet
cards based on the AMD79c960.  These have only 10baseT connectors;
I made a cable with 2 rj-45's, crossing the tx and rx; works fine.
The cards cost me CDN$73 each from Tech Data.  (about $55US at the
current exchange rate).  They do DMA bus-mastering so the performance
should be good (haven't done any benchmarks yet, and I just got the
LANCE driver working before I went on vacation.)

        Hmmm...can someone explain this DBZINCORE a little mnore to me?
I tried -DMMAP, changed READ to MMAP the other day, compiled and installed
aeverything and it totally killed my system...well...killed is a bad 
word, but basically, innd kept accepting articles, kept building
overview files...but when I tried to connect to the server, it basically
told me that no files existed.  I went over to the server and looked
around, and found that the active file hadn't been updated in over
12 hours *raised eyebrows*

        Again, this is under Linux pl12 with the net-2 code, which
doesn't mean much to Rich (sorry)  If someone can give me an idea
of why I can't do this DBZINCORE...and can give me an idea of why
I would want to use it...my meager understanding is that it keeps
everything in 'memory' and thereby makes things run faster(?)

        On a different note, does anyone know of support for, or
upcoming support for, overview files in nn?  Something that would
allow me to make use of what inn is already building, like trn 3.2
does? 

Thanks...

Date: Mon, 16 Aug 93 20:47:01 PDT

I have put together Linux diskette labels for those who want
them.  They are done in Macintosh freehand, but i think I have
successfully exported them into postscript files.

I think they look cool.  They are based upon the Linux logo
that you can find posted on tsx-11.mit.edu in 
/pub/linux/postscript.

These files are not small.  They print onto Avery 5139 
3.5" laser printer labels.

If anyone wants the files (4 of 'em) I'll email them to
you.  If I get enough requests, I'll see if someone will
want to post them onto some linux site (tsx-11 maybe?)
or a mirror or whatever.

If you want the source files, fine...  Gladly give them
to you.  If you want the labels pre-printed for you after
you look at them, we can work on price.  All I want is
my cost of the labels plus postage - that's all.

Let me know what anyone thinks...

Note followups.  This question really should have been in cdm.  I'm
re-directing followups in that direction.

Also, this is a reply to *TWO* posts---the first is the original post,
from kfisher3@mach1.wlu.ca (Kevin G. Fisher), and the second is a followup
post from entropy@world.std.com (Lawrence Foard).  The first bit deals
mostly with the 16550, and the next bit deals with serial port speeds,
throughput, etc.

Most likely, yes.

When data arrives at your computer, the UART triggers an interrupt telling
the CPU that it needs to be serviced.  If the CPU is busy servicing another
interrupt that happens to have a higher priority, the UART has to wait.
The older UART chips, the 8250 and 16450 (and chips that emulate them),
only had a 1 byte FIFO (first-in first-out) buffer, meaning that if the
data in the buffer wasn't taken care of before another character arrived,
the buffer is overrun, and the first character is lost.  The 16550A, and
more recently, the 16550AF, have a 16 byte FIFO buffer.  This means that
instead of having only one character time for the CPU to service the
interrupt, you now have up to 16 (read on...this varies), which gives you
some breathing room.

Now, that's only the first improvement...there's more.  Every time the CPU
has to stop what it's doing and service an interrupt, there is a certain
amount of system overhead associated with this change (this is called
``context-switcing overhead'').

In order to work to reduce the total amount of context-switching overhead
associated with handling the incoming data stream, the 16550A is able to
wait, and only issue an interrupt after either a certain number of
characters (can be set to 1, 4, 8, or 14 --- 4 is probably your best
setting --- see a recent discussion on cdm for details), or a certain
amount of time since the last character (4 character times) was placed into
the FIFO (w/o being serviced).  Along with this, it provides the ability
for the interrupt service routine (the software on the computer that
services the interrupt) to read more than one character at a time.

In other words, instead of issuing an interrupt for *EVERY* character, the
UART now issues an interrupt for every n characters, and the system can
retrieve all of the characters in the FIFO while servicing that one
interrupt.

What does this all boil down to?  Better performance and the ability to
support much higher speeds, even in a multi-tasking environment.

>>I seem to remember in the days of OS/2
>>2.0's intro people running into the same problem, and the solution being to

Yep---see above.  You probably need to look into getting a 16550AF.  Before
you do, however, you need to make sure your serial board has either an 8250
or 16450 installed.  Some (many) serial boards have chips that emulate
these instead of having the actual chips.  A *VISUAL* inspection is
required to determine what you have.  If you have either an 8250 or 16450,
and if it's in a socket, your task is extremely simple.  Otherwise, e-mail
me.

Btw, the 16550AF normally runs for $9 to $12 (US) plus shipping.  I
wouldn't advise paying any more than that (there are those who try to
sell the chip for as high as $50 !!!).

Yes, but with a 14,400 bps modem, you'd never set the serial port to
only 14.4 kb (since you say baud above, and not bps, it is assumed that
you're referring to the serial port speed, as there is no such thing
as a 14,400 baud modem for normal POTS lines).  You'd want to set the
serial port to *AT LEAST* 19.2 kb, preferably 38.4 or 57.6 kb.

And as far as the 1440 cps / 1440 interrupts/second figure, you're
forgetting about the async-to-sync conversion from V.42 (or MNP3).
The actual data rate between modems (before any compression at all)
is going to be more along the lines of 1724 cps (V.32bis w/ V.42 and
a clean phone line).  Assuming you have things setup on both ends such
that there isn't a bottleneck between the modem and the computer, you're
looking at more in the range of 1650 to 1724 interrupts/second.

If you add data compression to this (and assuming you're not transferring
pre-compressed data), the number gets even higher.  How high depends on the
data.  If you want to get an idea of the ranges there, see the current
discussion in cdm on this.

Oh well, this post is long enough.  :-)  Virtually,

I always love doing this and watching my system grind to a near halt...

main()
{
  void *foo;
  for (;;)
    foo = (void *)malloc( <pick a number> );
}

All it takes is a ctrl-c to kill, but if your in X, and not in that xterm...
FORGET IT! You might as well shut the machine down.

I did try this:

#define MYSTRING        "Let's have a party!"
#define MEM             100

main()
{
  char *foo;
  for (;;) {
    if ((foo = (char *)malloc( MEM )) == NULL) {
      printf("Oops! No more memory.\n");
      exit(1);
    }
    else {
      strcpy(foo, MYSTRING);
    }
  }
}

I watched the memory drop down to nothing, and I never got the "Opps!..."
And I also didn't get a SEGV either. Is this a problem with the libc malloc?
The kernel? Or what???

BTW, I have 16M of memory + 16M swap.

Subject: often get "illegal instruction" w. latex and mf
Date: 17 Aug 1993 08:31:13 GMT

Hi Linuxers,

when I use latex or mf the program very often dies with "illegel instruction".
Normally one would say that a program runs or it does not, but on my linux box mf
works sometimes, allthough not very often (in 10% it works). Latex has the
same behaviour. So I suspected a hardware problem and it seems really to be one:

I've got a 
i486 ISA with an old OPTI chipset, 256kb cache
2 ide drives (one Maxtor 7120A and one Conner 30204)
Et4000

I've installed
SLS 1.03 with 0.99p11 (the pre Aug 11 rel of SLS)

There is a Turbo Switch Jumper on the Motherboard and when I close it (slower
mode) mf and latex work fine in most cases.
When I run the board in fast mode an disable the external cache latex and mf work
fine! 
I played with the BIOS Setup (waitstates, non caheable block, ...) but only
disabeling the external cache helps.

It is very strange, that all the other binaries like gcc XF86_SVGA and also my
numerical mathematics codes (compiled with gcc 2.4.5 and liked with libc.so.4.4.1)
work fine with the external cache enabled.

The TeX binaries in SLS 1.03 are from feb 93 and they are linked with DLL Jump
4.3. Should I  use newer binaries, should I buy a new motherboard (@#$%#$) or 
should I disable my external cache RAM for ever?

I would be very happy about suggestions, explanations or comments because parts
of my diploma thesis want to be texed ;-)

I guess what I'm looking for is something similar to the dos comm programs
Qmodem or Telix.  I suppose I could use the dos emulator but I'd rather
keep looking for another linux comm program, or wait until the emulator is
well beyond the alpha stage.

I'll be trying out minicom and pcomm, which I overlooked the first time I
FTP'd to sunsite.  I'm hoping one of these two will be adequate for me;
I'll find out after I finish reading newsgroups.

If you have a round, mini-din-plug mouse socket, this is probably a PS/2
mouse port.  You will have to ...

        - Change your Xdefaults file so that the mouse is PS/2-style and
          uses /dev/psaux
        - Recompile your kernel to include PS/2 mouse support.  The MCC 
          standard release doesn't have this compiled in.

I've come to think of exactly the same. I've gotten the impression
that SLS is what it is: a collection of free software, whereas MCC
is a lot more like a 'real', polished unixoid operating system.

And what about the other installations, let's have comments on those!
Who's installed TAMU, Slackware etc? Can you compare? 

The FAQ is maintained by the users, mostly, and MCC hasn't got the
area apparently because less questions about it are asked. I doubt
mr MacCauley would have anything against a good installation comparation
in there?
