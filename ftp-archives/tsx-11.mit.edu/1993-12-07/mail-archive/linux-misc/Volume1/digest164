=====================================================================

        NOT JUST ANOTHER LINUX + 386BSD CD-ROM.

Trans-Ameritech presents LINUX SLS/Slackware AND 386BSD and MULTYMEDIA CD-ROM.

A new Linux CD-ROM is available! But not just Linux. Also 386BSD and more.
Here is a brief summary of why we think this CD-ROM is the best.
As the price of only $30 puts it in the same price category as the JANA 
product, I'll base my comparison on it.


We provide 2 versions of SLS distribution - a very stable 1.02 and the new 1.03
and also the SLACKWARE distribution! Linux installs directly from the CD-ROM
on almost any hardware configuration.

1. The Trans-Ameritech Linux CD-ROM is not just a mirror of some ftp site. 
In addition to the full SLS distributions we supply a "live" image of a 
configured system. This is great if you don't want files that are not used 
very often to garble your hard disk. One example is manpages - use them 
directly from the CD-ROM. Same applies to emacs lisp files, info files etc.
How many fonts do you need? Have them all! Space is no problem.

2. Uncompressed sources are available for instant reference.

3. Several versions of the Linux kernel are provided precompiled to cover 
different hardware options including drivers for Sony-31A and Sound Blaster 
CD-ROMs.

4. Patches to support sound cards are included. Take this compiled kernel IF 
YOU WANT. If not - use a small kernel with no unused ballast.

5. Install Linux directly from the Sony-31A or Sound Blaster CD-ROM drive as
well as standart SCSI and Mitsumi types.

6. We are running Linux on several PCs to make sure that our configurations
really work. We don't wait for official SLS release for certain extra drivers
and utilities. If they work here, we include it as an option on the CDROM.

7. For your convenience a full recent distribution of 386BSD *NIX is provided
on the same CD-ROM.

8. Some space is dedicated to what takes too much room on hard disks - 
sounds and pictures. They are usable with the Linux sound/gif tools and under 
MS-DOS too!

9. A few choice MS-DOS applications are included in the assumption that the
majority of Linux users run DOS occasionaly. Or use it from dos-emu!
Most of the MS-DOS stuff comes from the SIMTEL20 archive. Naturally only part 
of it made it to the first CDROM. However the new releases will include other 
files from SIMTEL20, GARBO etc. So if you subsribe to the Trans-Ameritech 
Linux+ CDROM, you will not only get updated Linux, but over a year you will get
the full SIMTEL20 collection as an extra bonus.

10. Trans-Ameritech is a well established company with efficient organization
to guarantee on-time printing and shipping of this product. There will be a
significant discount if you subscribe for future releases.

But the best part is that YOU will decide what to put on the next edition!
We'll count votes and provide most popular software on the next one.



You can order by phone (408) 727-3883 or by FAX (408) 727-3882.
Our address is:
2342A Walsh Avenue
Santa Clara, CA 95051

Shipping overseas (as in UK and Germany) is $6.
Shipping in US is $5.
Pay by cheque or credit card.
COD in continental US is $6 extra if you want it.

The price for a single CD-ROM is $30. 
California residents, please include tax.

We plan to make a new release every 3 month. Subscription price is $20 per CD
for a total of $80 for a year.

Well, use either

Subject: Problems with X in SLS 1.03
From: weber@young.ece.cmu.edu (Dave Weber)
Date: Mon, 27 Sep 1993 21:50:09 GMT

Hi
I have recently installed SLS 1.03 without too many problems except X. The
first problem is that X (OpenLook) crashes the system after a few minutes
or even hours possibly because of a memory leak somewhere. The second problem
is that if I quit X, either X or the kernel (I don't know which) fails to
reset the video mode correctly so all I see is vertical white stripes instead
of the virtual terminal outputs.

I have a 486/50 with 16Mbytes of memory and an ATI Wonder video card. I would
appreciate any pointers to where the problem might be (like which piece of 
code is responsible for resetting the video mode) or a fix of some sorts.

Thanks

Or if you don't want that, try ftp-ing to beatrix.icce.rug.nl. In the 
directory pub/unix you'll find unixdos.zip, a C proggy with a makefile which 
installs into /usr/local/bin.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

I picked up the latest release (TAMU.99pl12+) just to try it out...

I finally got color X to work on one of my Compaqs, though it didn't use
the left 2 inches of the screen... <sigh>

It gave me a chance to try out the X File Manager ("xfm"), which I never
would have bothered with otherwise.  It's pretty nice!  Its almost Mac-like
simplicity that "xfm" presents just may be the key to weaning my wife away
from MS-DOS (and thus recovering another 20 MB of disk space!!).

There were problems though.  I had to symbolically link all the shared
X libraries up into the root directory (because LD_LIBRARY_PATH wasn't
being searched properly), and I had to "unset TERMCAP" and "stty sane"
to get xterms to behave properly when logging in through xdm.

The main thing that irks me though is that even without Emacs I'm almost
filling my disk!  Maybe it's all the X stuff, but JEEZ!  I used to have
about 12 MEGAbytes more free space when I used the SLS base distribution
and TinyX.  With *that*, I had GhostScript too!  I just don't know what
could be taking up all that space in the TAMU distribution...

Another thing that bugged me was that I couldn't get publicly available
binaries (for X) to run under TAMU... maybe they would run, now that I
have the X libraries linked into the root directory.  Really strange.

Yes, I'm aware that SLS has problems.  But I think it's better than the
TAMU distribution for a few reasons:  SLS packs a lot of functionality
into a little disk space.  SLS lets you CHOOSE what to install and what
not to install.  And of some not-so-minor importance:  SLS *works*.

Hi everybody!

As I already mentioned I asked Island for a port of their quite powerfull
office software package "Draw, Write, Paint" to Linux. It contains a
Wordprocessor, a program for creating Images and another for vector
grafics. I think it would be the right thing for everybody who is
locking for a standard software package. 

I got an answer some minutes ago. They know Linux, but at the moment they
have no plans to make a port. This may change if they will see a real market
for a Linux port. 

Now it is your turn!!! Please send me an E-Mail if you are pricipially willing
to bye a package like "Draw, Write, Paint" for Linux. 

I want to show that there _IS_ a market for commercial Linux software. Please
don't dissapoint me :-).

Send your E-mail to the following address:

        tul@sun1.rz.fh-heilbronn.de

Thanks for your efforts!

Like h*ll it was.  Reposted is the word you want, crossposting means
something entirely different (something that is much less wasteful of
resources).  Somebody really should fix the software you're using for
reposting.

And since c.o.l.help was the correct group for your question, and
c.o.l.misc is not, why it appears here at all, I do not know.

Sorry to be such an asshole, but I get annoyed by the crossposts and

Just a couple of comments:
1. thanks to a number of helpful testers, all the problems mentioned by rick
   (plus a couple others) are documented in an ERRATA file in the TAMU top 
   level ftp directory, and are easily fixed.  TAMU.99p12 is a whole new
   release created from scratch based on a complete BSD style source tree,
   and suffers the typical minor bugs of such a massive undertaking.  At least
   all the known bugs are documented.  To some sites, such as TAMU, the
   availability of a full source tree is critical to future plans for linux,
   and these needs are not addressed by SLS.
2. TAMU.99p12 does have a working automatic network installation/configuration.
   This may not be of significance to home users, but is important to 
   use of linux on campus.
2. TAMU.99p12 does let you choose whether or not to load X11.  A real
   package system along the lines of Sun's is in the works, which will
   have definite advantages over the SLS disk set method. (Finer granularity,
   package dependencies, ...).  With this package system, you will be able to 
   see exactly where the space is being used, and tailor your configuration
   to your needs.

Flamewar indeed.. I suppose theat makes a burning match a nuclear inferno.

Russ quite rightly observed that there were problems with FvK's work and
his (lack of) network access and said he was too busy to do any better
however. I've since taken on the aim of doing a decent stable release of
NET-2D(aka net2debugged). I hope to have the first really credible results
for ftp from sunacm.swan.ac.uk tuesday or wednesday night (subject to it 
working continually for 3 days or so on our test machines).
In the mean time Fred can get on with the newest network code unencumbered
from frantically nailing the old one together to keep it working and the
many bugs I've fixed have been handed on to him and where appropriate merged
into the up and coming new release.

Hardly all out war now is it ?

Or, assuming the file to be converted comes from a DOS partition, one
possibility is to mount the partition with the mount option
'-o conv=text' or '-o conv=auto'. No lines of code required.
This won't work on tar'ed or zipped files, of course...

Yeah, I think LSL in Clinton Mi., 800-432-0556 if you want to call and
express your opinion to them, is doing a sad job of misrepresenting both
Linux and their relationship to it.  Their very name appears to be a play
on USL that implies something that ain't so.  They aren't very good about
followup, either.  Just for the heck of it I called and asked for a flyer.
They never sent it.  They must be raking in the bux, tho, they've gone
from a little tiny one-color add in Unix Review to a quarter-page two-color
add every month.  

As far as I know, the difference between them and SLS is that Peter
Mcdonald has been and is actively and constructively involved in 
freeware development, while these jokers are just making money and
not putting anything back.  Not that there's anything illegal about
that, but the way they are doing it exudes sleaze.

If I am wrong about any of this kindly flame me on the net or by e-mail.  

Incidentally, LSL has no e-mail address.  At least that they care to
publish.  Sort of distinguishes them from the responsible companies,
don't you think?

Hi,

I'm trying to get XFree86-1.3 for Linux.99pl12 from SLS 1.0.3 to work
and getting really frustrated getting the right settings for Xconfig.
Does anybody have settings for the following configuration:

KFC CK-14 monitor
XFree86-1.3 Linux.99pl12 on a 486DX25, 16MB, 2 340MB IDE

I tried playing with the settings that are in the modeDB.txt (or
X386.modeDB in export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib), but they don't work.
The closest one I found is the following, which is for CK-1405 not CK-14.

With these settings the X windows showed up 45 degree twisted(?).
