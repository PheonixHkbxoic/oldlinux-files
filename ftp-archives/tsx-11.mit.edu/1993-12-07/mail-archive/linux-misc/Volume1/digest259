Well,

I've watched patiently.  I just have this to say:  I like SLS for
one reason, and if someone else offered this, I would pounce
on it!  I like the fact that it comes compiled with sound support.
I am a newbie, and I like the fact that I can use my sound harware
from the getgo.  If there is any other distribution that offers this, 
let me know.  Because I am new, I don't want to fool with kernel
recompiles yet!!!!

Thanks

By network, I assume you're talking about NNTP. Sure, trn will run
fine without it.  news.software.readers is a better newsgroup to
discuss this, because its not really related to Linux. At least, I
assume that news.software.readers is for programs, and not people who
read news software source code. :)

Just a bit of flame:

No matter how much Peter benefited from SLS (it is quite ok according to
the license), his efforts in assembling the first complete distribution
helped MANY MANY people to start up with Linux. 

Thank you Peter!

Why my machine hang after issuing the mke2fs command to 
create the file system ?  
I used SLS.  
It just hang there after giving out the messages
"Block log size = 0" 
"Fragment log size = 0"

Has anyone seen this problem before ?
Would my pc be linux compatible ?

I appreciate your help!!!

Subject: LGX (Fall) CDROM review.
Date: Sun, 31 Oct 1993 23:20:08 GMT


I've been working with the LGX CDROM for a for a fortnight now, and I'd
thought I'd share my experiences.

Pros:           Almost complete source.  Cheap.
Cons:           Poorly integrated/compiled.
Overall:        Disappointing.

My bona fides: I've been following Linux since Linus announced the
kernel in c.o.m.  I've offered a number of kernel patches, ported a few
applications, written a device driver.  My business is programming, with
8 years experience in DOS/Un*x programming and maintainance.

My first complete Linux installation was SLS 1.0.  Despite the recent
flaming of SLS, I found it easy to install, requiring only minor
tweaking to create a functioning Linux/X environment complete with news
and mail feeds via UUCP.  My system is an 8Mb 386DX25, 105Mb/650Mb SCSI
disks with TMC885 controller and ET4000 video card.

I was looking to make the jump from pl9 to pl13.  In the process, I
wanted to repartition my disks, and wanted a large source repository.
After comparing LGX, Nascent and Ameritech CDROMS, I went with LGX
because
    1.  Price.  Just Computing were preselling for a most
        reasonable price.
    2.  Postgres.  I wanted to have a look at DBMSs.
    3.  This is Yggdrasil's second release.  I assumed that any
        problems/bugs in the distribution would have been ironed out.

The install script allows you a choice of installations - cd_dependant
(1Mb), runtime (27Mb), complete (235Mb) and everything (700Mb).  I
installed the runtime system, with a view to customizing my system with
the control panel, an application that allows you to selectively install
packages.  Some of the problems I encountered may have been due to this
partial install - it's possible that users doing the complete install
would have less trouble.

As a resource, the CD is good.  It would have been great if it was a
little more up to date (see below).  As a turnkey Linux system, it's
poor.  Yggdrasil are promoting this as a `plug-and-play operating
system'.  This is true only in the most juvenile sense of the word
`play'.  Mail, UUCP, and news don't work.  The compiler package is
installed missing a key program.  Most X libraries are not installed.
I find it hard to believe that any QC was done at all.

The nitty gritty.  This is not presented in any particular order.

    1.  The install script does not handle the case of no swap.
        While this doesn't affect installation, newbies are going
        to be quite disconcerted to see error messages during
        installation.
    2.  fdisk does not handle SCSI drives/controllers that return
        invalid drive geometries.  While not an Yggdrasil problem,
        it might have been detected (and easily corrected) by QC.
        This fault makes it impossible to repartition drives on
        certain systems.
    3.  The demo will not run on an 8Mb machine with no swap.
        Not a real problem, but no mention is made in the manual
        of the >8Mb requirement.
    4.  asteroids will not work without a patch.  Again, not an
        Yggdrasil problem, but seeing as this program is the first
        one listed on the games menu for the demo, it should have
        been detected and is easily corrected.
    5.  reboot is located in /bin, not in /usr/bin where init expects
        to find it, so init doesn't handle the three finger salute.
    6.  An older, incompatible version of init in /bin.
    7.  A number of directories are installed with the wrong permissions.
        For example, /usr, /usr/bin, /usr/local and /usr/local/bin
        are world writeable, as are others.
    8.  /usr/bin/ranlib is not installed when you choose to install
        the compiler component.
    9.  /usr/bin/Mail cannot update a users mailbox.  While it's an
        improvement over the mail that came with SLS, it requires
        /usr/spool/mail to be world writeable in order to create a lock
        file.  There are two choices: make /usr/spool/mail rwxrwxrwt, or
        recompile mail to create its lock file in /tmp.  I chose the
        latter.
    10. Most of the X libraries in /usr/X386/lib do not get installed.
        Soft links are created for them in /usr/lib, but only the
        shared libs are installed.
    11. The UUCP programs are installed with the wrong ownership,
        which means they can't spool to /usr/spool/uucp, which has the
        right owner.  I needed to recompile anyway to install a bug
        fix, so this wasn't a problem for me.
    12. INN (InterNetNews) is stuffed.  Not only is the config suspect
        (try posting to a moderated newsgroup), the installation is
        missing a key program, innd.  An incompatible version of inews
        is in /bin.  Also installed with the wrong ownership.
    13. Kernel rebuilds require configuring IN2000 support.  IN2000
        support appears to have been added by Yggdrasil, since it
        doesn't appear in my copy of linux-99.13k.  All well and good
        for Yggdrasil customers with IN2000 cards, but I don't see the
        point of making everybody else compile with IN2000 support, when
        a 5 line patch removes this requirement.
    14. No NET-2.  I may be mistaken here, because networking is one
        area in which I have no experience.  However, one of the
        packages I've ported (FlexFAX) requires a minimal TCP setup, so I
        thought I'd have a go setting it up.  Following the instructions
        in /usr/doc/FAQs/NET-2-FAQ, I got to the point of running
                /bin/hostname -S razorback
        Guess what?  My hostname became `-S'.  While no mention is made
        anywhere of NET-2 support, I assumed (hoped) it would be included.
        Because of the NET-2 faq, and /usr/doc/network-guide/netguide-0.4,
        I thought it was.

The following are more nit-pickery than Yggdrasil problems.

    15. There is no source or documentation for minicom.
    16. /usr/src/sbin/getty_ps is version 2.0.2, not 2.0.7b.  Since
        2.0.7b was released in April, it would have been nice to have it
        updated.
    17. A choice of init would have been nice.  The poeigl supplied is a
        little dated (1.11), and I prefer the SysV init from Miquel van
        Smoorenburg.  Not a Yggdrasil problem, a personal preference.
    18. etc is located in /var.  If var is meant to be a mountable
        filesystem, putting etc on it is going to make it difficult.
        Wait for the FSSTND call on this.
    19. The demo of the Andrew System (ez) requires the environment
        variable ANDREWDIR be defined.  Since it isn't, some of the
        demos fail.
    20. The fonts installed for ghostscript-2.6.1 are from the
        ghostscript-2.5.2 package, so a number of those listed in Fontmap
        (Nimbus, URWAntiquaT, URWGroteskT) are not available.
    21. While the manual cover lists JPEG/GIF/TIFF viewers, you're
        not actually told what they're called.  Expecting xv/xli/xloadimage,
        I had to poke around before discovering display.
    22. Man pages exist for xmahjongg, xjewel and jetpack, but not the
        programs themselves.

There are a number of other things I've had to do, but they fall more into
the area of normal configuration/setup.

The upshot is that two weeks after getting the disk, and thinking it
would be an evenings work to install, I'm still tweaking (eg, I only
discovered the missing X libs last night).  If I'd known what this disk
was like beforehand, I would have waited another couple of weeks for the
new SLS CD - the difference in the amount of downtime would have more
than compensated the price difference.

Yggdrasil had the oppurtunity of making a great introduction for Linux
with this.  The addition of mpeg/sound applications shows off the
potential that Linux holds.  Howver, the ball has been fumbled badly,
and I would not recommend this CD for users without significant *ix
experience.

LATE FLASH:  As I was posting this, I received a message from Yggdrasil
in response to an earlier posting of mine.  While the time between
posting and response was fairly long, it shows that Yggdrasil listen to
their customers.  Hopefully they can use this post to better their
product.

Rick.

If you are planning on using 1280x1024, I would definitely recommend a 17"
monitor, but my 15" 1572FS CrystalScan does 1280x1024 NON-interlaced no
problem with the Mach32 XFree86 drivers.  It flickers a bit, and text is

Any company that charges you by volume or speed, is a company you
should not deal with. You should be charged for the time you occupy on
their modem and little else.  There are many other Internet providers
that do not charge rates like this and anyone would be well advised to
stay away from anyone who charges for messages/volume. That's insane.

Go to a place like Digex (although its not a fair comparison, because
its not a "local" call) your cost becomes:

1 month connection:             $25
(download it off prime time)..  $0
30 floppies                     $45
                               -----
                                $70

and its cheaper if you steer away from the place you just described.

If you don't have a good and reasonable provider of Internet access,
getting a quarterly CD-ROM/tape/floppy set would be much better.

Charging for data volume puts that provider up there with Compu$erve
for the amount of respect I'd give them..

And things have gone downhill since. There is no denying that Peter did
contribute to Linux (including the kernel). His refusal to fix bugs and
outright mistakes in SLS despite repeated pleas, and mis-representation
of Linux's capabilities are a liability to the Linux effort. The worst
symptom is that MANY MANY people think SLS is Linux.
