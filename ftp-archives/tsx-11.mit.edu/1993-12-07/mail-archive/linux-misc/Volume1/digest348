Subject: A script: to identify multiple executables on PATH
Date: Sat, 27 Nov 1993 12:39:31 GMT

In some Linux distributions there have been duplicate binaries.
This script will find them all.

#!/bin/sh
dlist=`echo $PATH | sed 's/:/ /g'`
for d in $dlist ; do
    if [ -d $d ] ; then
       cd $d
       for f in * ; do
          if [ -x $f ] ; then
             echo $f
          fi
       done
    fi
done | sort -u > /tmp/list1
# So /tmp/list1 is the full list of all executables at CMIE.

pa=./pa         # a copy of this is ahead.
for x in `cat /tmp/list1` ; do
    test `$pa $x | wc -l ` -eq 1
    if [ $? != 0 ] ; then
        echo Executable $x
        $pa $x | gawk '{print "   "$0}'
        echo ""
    fi
done

exit 0

The script `pa' follows.  It is like `which' except that it shows all
occurences of a executable on the path, not just one.

#!/bin/sh
original=`pwd`
for dir in `echo $PATH | sed 's/:/ /g'`; do
   cd $original; cd $dir
   for executable in $* ; do
      # time to expand it
      tmp=`echo $dir/$executable`
      for name in $tmp ; do
         if [ -x $name ] ; then
            echo $name
         fi
      done
   done
done

Subject: mounting Panasonic 563B CDROM
Date: Sun, 28 Nov 1993 05:28:46 GMT

I have installed the patch panasonic-563Bcdrom.patch to the kernel
source in order to use my CDROM drive.  I have compiled the kernel,
taking care to choose CONFIG_ISO9660_FS, CONFIG_PANASONIC_WHATNOT,
and CONFIG_SOUND.  Upon boot, the kernel reports that the soundcard
is detected; however, no CDROM drives are reported as detected.

I am curious as to what I have to do in order to mount a CDROM under
Linux.  I attempt to use the command "mount -t iso9660 /dev/mcd0 /cd0"
but that returns "mount: wrong fs type, /dev/mcd0 already mounted, 
/cd0 busy, or other error".  I have also tried using "msdos" as a 
filesystem (as it is an msdos cd).  This did not work either.

I am not entirely sure /dev/mcd0 is the correct device; if it is not,
what is?  Also, how do I know if the kernel knows my CDROM drive even
exists?  The patch applied w/out any rejections, and I have the exact
model the author reported he used with the patches.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I often get I/O errors for no apparent reason.

Doing anything major that uses the DMA will crash a backup or restore

One must still use DOS to format tapes.  I haven't had time to get 
DOSEMU working to try CMS tape utils to format under DOSEMU.

I know C but not C++, and I am pretty new to UNIX operating system programming.
I am sure that there are others out there that know far more about the 
status of the tape driver than I, and there is a good chance that I am doing
something wrong.  I _have_ been able to backup, restore and verify using
tar and diff for verify (is this correct method for verify???)

Any info about new developments, releases, of ftape would be appreciated.

It hasn't been fixed yet as far as I heard. The Xfree86 people claim
they must figure out/implement code to "put the RAMDAC (a part of the
video _card_, not the monitor) into a special clock multiplexing
mode", else it will overheat and die.

They probably will implement the changes needed and quite possibly
soon, I guess. There is a safety limit coded in to Xfree86 which
blocks those clocks from being used. (Don't defeat it if that is the
case, there has been a big thread about this with the Xfree86 people,
and don't number your clocks with bogus/untrue numbers (e.g. clocks 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ...) like some Xconfigs do).

But getting a card which is self-destructible sounds like a _BAD_
idea! It speaks VERY POORLY of its design. A few extra logic gates
would be all they'd need to add to protect it. Like $5 (extreme
maximum overstatement!, probably much cheaper) on a >$100 card. That
would be a good idea to protect people's investment, but I guess they
just don't give a d*mn, or want people to have to buy new cards.

ALSO, IF SOMEONE HACKS ROOT ON YOUR SYSTEM (ITS PROBABLY EASIER THAN
YOU THINK, UN*X SYSTEMS ARE IN GENERAL NOT THAT SECURE), it is bad
enough they can destroy your data, and misuse your system resources,
but being able to destroy hardware is more than a few degrees beyond
the utterly intolerable! (I have heard this is not totally
theoretical, even nowadays, I've heard that there are DOS viruses that
attempt to fry monitors.)

It will probably work, because typical interrupt drivers are
probably good for 10 times the 1 ma source current the
16550A is rated for.  At least for a while.


>Someone might want to add this to the serial FAQ.

I hope they add this note too.
[Cliff's ASCII schematic deleted.  Backplane is pulled to some low
voltage by 470 ohms to ground, tacked onto one of the serial boards.
The voltage will depend on the motherboard's pullup value.  Any 16550a
can push the IRQ high by dumping current on the resistor, but tacked-on
diodes prevent each inactive 16550a from pulling IRQ low.  Valid logic
levels are likely but not guaranteed.]

Well if you're going to the trouble of buying parts and heating up
a soldering iron, you can guarantee valid levels with 74LS241
high-enabled 3-state TTL driver chips (should cost about 25 cents US)
instead of the diodes.

Gate each IRQ onto the bus with one section of the 74LS241 as
follows.
First power the chip by wiring pin 10 to ground and pin 20 to +5V,
which you can find at a bypass capacitor on the board.
If you reverse the polarity, you'll know by the resulting smoke!
Break the existing IRQ connection.  Usually you just remove a jumper.
Wire the IRQ from the 16550a to pin 19 (high-true driver-enable) of
the '241.
Wire pin 5 (driver out) to the backplane IRQ of your
choice, usually at the jumper.
Wire pin 15 (driver in) to +5V.
Tack a 330 ohm resistor between ground and the backplane IRQ,
on only one of the boards.  The 74LS241 can dump at least 15 ma
into the resistor.

The other seven sections in the chip are not used.
Cut off all the other pins.  Don't try this with
a CMOS driver like 74HCT241.  
I chose the pin 5 driver because it's far from the supply
pins, less likely to short.
If you look at the top of a '241 with the numbers right-side up,
pin 1 is at the lower left, usually marked with a dot.  Pins are
counted counterclockwise around the package.

Hi there,

Are there some 8bit cross-assembler package available via ftp?
I am especially searching for Z80 and 8051/8052 types, which will run under linux or other
un*x-systems.
An assembler generating binary output would be fine, but one generating linkable code
would be even better.

Thank you,

I finally made sure all was conected properly again, and booted the floppy
for Linux (Slackware) and everything works perfectly.  In fact, I am using
it now.

Only things I am working on now are getting to the D: (of C:, D: & E:) dos
partition on the drive on the primary adapter (WD1007).  I am just
extremely happy that I do not have to use the BIOS on the Adaptec!!!! 
This saves/allows more loadhi (QEMM) space when I boot dos, and I can use
my tape drive from software that knows how to get to the Adaptec.

Now, to get my serial MS Mouse to work, and the SoundBlaster Pro and it's
CD-ROM...

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other

The LS241 is not needed. If youhave a look for original IBM serial cards
you will notice that there is 74LS125 ( tristate driver) which is the
driver for the bus , not the UART (16550a or eqv.) Usually the tristate
function is controlled with OUT2 pin from the UART. With little hacking 
you could use this chip , because it is already there. Of course there
those modern chips having 2 UARTs and LS125 inside of them, then you must use
LS241. I have been using the diode or-circuit more than 1 year, using 
AA119 germanium diodes and 1 k pulldown, 5 ports to irq 3 and 2 to irq 4.
It really works. The voltage level (active ) was about 4.1 volts , enough for 
all TTL chips.
