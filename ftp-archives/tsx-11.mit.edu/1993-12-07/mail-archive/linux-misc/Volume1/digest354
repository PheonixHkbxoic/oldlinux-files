The Irwin Accutrak is not QIC-80, it is a servoe-based floppy controller tape
dThe Accutrak does not work with ftape becuase it is not QIC-80, however,
if you want a Conner/Irwin/Archive QIC-80 solution get an Archive Superhornet.
It operates fine with ftape from my experiences.  I'm working on doing some
ftape compatibility testing with the various floppy tape drives I'm using on
co-op at IBM.  I'll put together a compatibility report if I get a chance.

Subject: Gateway 386DX25 - what would you pay?
Date: Mon, 29 Nov 1993 19:14:48 GMT

I have the following system, which is perfectly adequate for
my needs at this time.  However, I'd like to do some X development
and that involves higher RAM, probably SCSI and CDROM+tape support.
So, I *may* be interested in selling my system for the right price.
What would you pay for this?  I will consider it an offer if you
indicate that it is such.

Gateway 2000 386DX25 noncache
came with:
- dual Epson floppies
- ATI 512k VGA wonder card with Microsoft Mouse
- 4Mb 70ns DRAM on motherboard, expanadable to 8 on MB,
  or to 16 with expansion card
- DOS 4.01 and Windows 3.0
- Western Digital 85Mb IDE hard drive, doublespaced

I upgraded to:
- NEC 3D 14" monitor
- DOS 6.2 and Windows 3.1
 
And added:
- Quantum LPS 85Mb hd, refurbed by Quantum (I fried the original
  while installing it)
- Linux SLS 1.03 upgraded to pl13 and X386 2.0 (yes, X!)
- US Robotics 14400 faxmodem (internal)

I'd like to keep the modem and possibly monitor, but are you
interested in buying a 386 with fully operational DOS/Windows
environment, and with a reboot, a real Unix (TM) environment
with fully configured X, GCC, UUCP and all the other toys?
If so, let me know...

Everything works perfectly and is in mint condition.

Date: Mon, 29 Nov 1993 19:51:24 GMT

Hi!

I just grabbed the improvement patch for scsi disks from tsx-11.
./ALPHA/scsi/cluster-04.tar.z or something likewise...

I then tried patching it against my official 0.99pl13 kernel
sources...and got into troubble - It would'nt patch!

I then realised that the README file did'nt say anything about
whitch kernel source the patch was made from...

So here is the question; Which kernel source do I need to apply
this patch..?
And a related question; Is this patch allready in the 0.99pl14
kernel sources..?

And a lazy question a the end; What is the easiest way to apply the
patch..? patch ....??....??

Thanx...

-Kristian.

One thing you have not tried is to run without a swapping partition (or
equivalently, not invoking 'swapon'.  With 8Mb, you surely do not need
swapping just to install the system.

Device 2/28 is /dev/fd0H1440, but a device change message is normal, so
has nothing to do with the other stuff it spit at you.

In linux/config.in, the Promise Technologies DC-4030VL is not in the
list of supported SCSI adaptors.  Maybe one of the others is sufficient
-- I dunno.  But, it may be sufficiently SCSI-like to do everything
but swap?  Worth a try.

In linux/README, Linus gives a procedure for using the printout to find
out where in the system the error is being picked up.  Try looking at
it with that help.

You have the sources in the file lx99pl13.tgz -- you can install them
using the boot disk and then 'sysinstall' without having done through
a complete installation.  You may, if lucky, have gotten that far
anyway.  You will find the tree of installed files off /root.

Hope something here helps.

I think what you're looking for is LOUT. First try archie to find a site in Europe.
If you can't find one, you can always get it from sunsite.unc.edu in

Hi.

Some time ago I wrote a small subroutine that converts any form of graphic
into LaTeX-input. It does this by analysing the graphic (via a user-defined
subroutine to make it format-independent) and converting it into appropiate
line-drawing commands for LaTeX. As you can imagine, this is pretty slow.

If someone is interested in this routine for including it in a program,
please tell me, so I can send it to you or even release for public.
If I find the time, I might write a small gif/jpeg to LaTeX-converter.

                        Ciao, Karsten

Subject: $20 Linux-compatible Ricoh SCSI controllers available
Date: Mon, 29 Nov 1993 21:38:03 GMT

A couple of months ago, I bought a surplus Ricoh "generic SCSI"
controller at an electronics store in this area.  I've been able to get
it to work with Linux.  Other folks who are looking for an inexpensive
SCSI capability for a Linux system might want to check it out.

The bad news first:

-  This model was discontinued by Ricoh years ago.  They no longer
   support it in any way.  They no longer have any information about
   it at all (I asked - they've tried to dig up enough info to do a tech
   sheet and have failed).

-  The store doesn't have any information about it either.  They don't
   (can't) actually test the cards, and so sell them as-is.

-  It's not compatible with Adaptec, Bustek/Buslogic, Future Domain,
   Trantor, or any other well-known SCSI controller cards.  No
   off-the-shelf drivers will work with it as far as I know.

-  There's no DOS driver support available at all.

-  It's an 8-bit controller, and thus has limitations on the IRQs and
   DMA channels it can use.

-  It has a few quirks to it.

-  It isn't bootable.

-  I haven't tested it with anything other than a hard disk (although
   both tape and CD-ROM should work, I believe).

The good news:

-  It has an on-board DOS BIOS.  Disassembling this revealed enough
   clues to permit a Linux driver to be developed (thank you, Drew!)

-  It uses an NCR5380, so Drew Eckhardt's "generic NCR5380" driver
   skeleton could be used as a starting point.  (Thanks again!)

-  Both of the ones I've bought, have worked.

-  It's fast enough to be useful.  On a 386SX-16, under 0.99pl13, iozone
   reports read/write throughputs of about 110-120 kbytes/second to a
   Maxtor LXT-213 when the card is run in DMA mode.  In PIO mode it's
   rather slower.  I believe that DMA-mode performance will be
   significantly better with the experimental block-cluster patches
   installed.

-  It's cheap ($20), and the Linux driver is free.

-  There are still about 30 of these cards in stock, as of a couple
   of days ago.  [Last week they told me on the phone that they were
   completely sold out, but I checked in person and they do indeed have
   more.]

Techie details:

-  It's an I/O-port-mapped NCR5380 design.

-  It uses ports 0x146 and 0x147 (to read the jumpers and perform
   miscellanous magic), and either 0x148-0x14F or 0x248-0x24F (NCR5380
   registers).  Its port addressing logic is slightly broken (it
   responds to DMA accesses in the port-number range)... for fully
   reliable operation it's necessary to lock out the lowest page in each
   one-meg memory range so that no DMA access can generate something
   that the card thinks is a read/write to one of its ports.  I have a
   simple patch for mm/memory.c to implement this.

-  It can be used either as a PIO controller (slow, simple, and quite
   reliable so far) or with motherboard-driven DMA on channel 1 or 3
   (also reliable once I figured out a few quirks, and significantly
   faster than PIO).

-  It can use IRQ 3, 4, or 5 (and perhaps 7 as well although I haven't
   tested this) and can also be used without an IRQ.  It can use DMA
   channel 1 or 3.

-  It does not conflict with IDE controllers.

-  It supports scatter/gather transfers, and disconnect/reselect (iff an
   IRQ is enabled).

-  It has on-board terminators (removable), a 50-pin header for
   connection to an internal SCSI device, a 50-pin header on the back
   for connection to an external SCSI daisychain, and a 50-pin-to-
   Centronics-50 shielded cable (I don't know how many of these the
   store has left).

If you're interested, you can purchase these cards from the store:
Halted Specialties Co. (HSC Electronic Supply) in Santa Clara, CA.
Phone (408) 732-1573.  The Ricoh generic SCSI controller is stock
#12268, and sells for $19.95 plus shipping (and tax if you're in
California).  Ask them to include the external shielded cable if they
have any left.

Write to me for a copy of the driver... it's alpha-quality but seems to
be working reliably.

obDisclaimer:  I have no relationship with Halted Specialties except as
a satisfied customer.

At least on my out-of-date Linux system (99.10), DLD cannot link
library archives (ar format).  The "simple", "overlay", and "add1"

I would be interested if anyone gets different results on more recent
