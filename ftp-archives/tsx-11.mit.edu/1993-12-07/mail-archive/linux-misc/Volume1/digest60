I finally got my cheapo $9.95 3-button mouse working correctly by
putting it into Mouse Systems mode.  Thanks to the author of the
"NOSEY" program which helped identify the problem.

One of our faculty is interested in using a diskless Sun as an X
display.  For $600 you can get a machine that has a bigger display
than most people can afford for a PC.  The problem is that
diskless suns require RARP and TFTP servers to boot.  RARP is
not a pure TCP/IP protocol.  Does anyone have any experience
booting a diskless Sun, or know of an RARP server?

Yup.  However, this isn't a GUI, it's a specialized device driver that is
designed to be used *by* GUIs.

As long as you're talking discrete characters, font cell rendering *is*
sufficient, with the caveat that your font cell can be whatever size you
deem fit (even variable) and that the underlying indexing method is able
to support the number of characters in the font.

I can't say much more than that, inasmuch as I don't know what the state of
the art in multi-language support is.  Suffice it to say that if one byte
isn't enough to represent all your characters, two probably is.  :-)

This sounds like a driver problem to me.  More precisely, it sounds like a
mechanism for registering your process with the driver is in order.  Not
really a problem, since the driver runs in kernel mode and can track which
processes are doing what, and can discover who's trying to open it, close
it, etc.  In short, process registration is probably just a matter of putting
the requisite code in the driver.

The downside of this is that a particular common "look-and-feel" might be
considered highly suboptimal compared to the other "look-and-feel"s
available.

I seem to recall that PC-GEOS has the user interface as a completely separate
thing from the actual application code (it may even be changeable on the fly).
As long as the look and feel of the user interface can be cleanly separated
from the actual function of the program itself, an integrated GUI isn't
particularly necessary.  The user just decides which one he/she wants and
goes with it.  But this requires very careful design of the generic GUI API.

X was, I believe, originally designed with GUI independence in mind, but they
might not have gone quite far enough.

Yup.  Of course, it's probably the only GUI available for NT...

There was a front page article in InfoWorld in the last week or two
that said that Windows applications run approximately 75% slower under
Windows NT than under native Windows 3.1

On the other hand, there was another article a while ago in a magazine
I don't remember, that said that Wabi ran applications about twice as
fast as native Windows 3.1.  The magazine used two identical 486/50's
for the comparison.  One running Windows 3.1, the other Solaris 2.1
and Wabi.

Please let me know if I missed anything as this is all from memory.

Absolutely. As a Linux/Unix novice I would have never got my machine up
and running without SLS. In the three weeks since I first installed I've
posted several questions to c.o.l.help and ftp'd the odd thing, but SLS
1.03 with the docs and install scripts it comes with was fabulous. As
easy as any commercial OS I've ever installed and almost as problem
free.

Good work.

You would.  After having having bought RickOS from you, I would
naturally give it away for free, as the GPL permits me to.  Perhaps I
would also merge your changes back into Linux.  Thank you for your
contribution :-). The only way you could stop me, would be to sue me.
Hopefully the GPL would protect me.

If you sold me a binary only copy of RickOS, I could sue you to get
the source, as the GPL gives me the right to expect.

Some time ago, we approached the manager of a little computer store
near the UCLA campus and convinced him to install Linux on the PC-clones
that he sells to us.  This eliminates the work and risk involved
in selecting the correct components then configuring Linux to work
with them.  We just take the system home, plug it in, turn it on
and start working.  If you are interested, please contact:

They also have a toll free number 1-800-486-2020.  Ask for Moujan Ahouraian
and tell him that Bob Tisdale told you to call.  I have no connection with
20/20 Technologies except as a satisfied customer.  Their prices appear to
be competitive with other local computer stores and they claim that they
can match anyone's ADVERTIZED prices.

Ditto!  Great job!

Compared with what else is out there, Linux offers far-and-away the
BEST seamless integration of the diverse filesystem and device types!

Back when I was running 386BSD, whenever I wanted to suck something off
my "Prime Time Freeware" CDs, I'd have to boot up DOS, copy the files off
the CD onto the DOS partition, boot 386BSD, then use mtools to get the
files off the DOS partition onto the BSD partition...

With the Mitsumi driver, it's one-stop shopping!   Plus, if I *wanted*
to put something on or take something off my DOS partition, all I need
to is access my /dos filesystem 8-)

[yes, I still have DOS on my machine, mainly because some of my favorite
packages -- Finale and Corel -- run only under Windows...]
