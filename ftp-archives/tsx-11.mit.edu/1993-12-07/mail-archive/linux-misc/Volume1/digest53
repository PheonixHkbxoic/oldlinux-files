Right.  Sun says:
1)      Wabi is not an acronym.
2)      Even if Wabi WERE an acronym, it most especially would NOT stand for
        Windows Application Binary Interface.

The official Wabi 1.0 should be trickling in for me to look at any week now.

Wow, Wabi on AIX already!  That is pretty exciting, and that is quite a
WinTach score!  Has IBM been working on it for a while, and only just announced
it, or can Wabi be ported to new UN*Xes trivially????

It will also be very interesting to see how Wabi on Intel machines and various
brands of UN*X that support Wabi compare to
1)      Win3.1
2)      Windows NoT
in performance!  If it performs even remotely as well, I'd say that points to
Windows being very inefficiently coded relative to X-Windows.

Yeah, it would be nice if it was free!  But Wine is coming along nicely,
at least as long as Bob Sanders keeps getting bored and implementing more
and more of it.  And Wabi should help get Winders vendors interested in
preserving compatibility with non-Microsoft environments (except Microsoft,
of course, which will surely try to break Wabi every time the have a new
release of one of their apps).

Wherever is appropriate if necessary. The GPL is a valid legal document. I

He doesn't need to pay a penny. Americans might have to pay to register
copyrights (I don't know about this), but Finn's don't - and the Finnish
copyright is as good as any other in the USA under the relevant conventions.

There are *hoards* of embedded applications that could use an OS like Linux.
Pick a better example: CNC lathes interfacing to existing CAD workstations.
Many of them squeeze by without an OS, or never come to market, because
of the "costs" of OS's.  Every pseudo-automated factory in the world has
a wild assortment of "OS's" running in embedded hardware that make DOS
look ... well, almost a good as Linux!  As hardware prices come down
(thank you Cyrix), the industrial use of embedded Real OS's (reasonably
priced, with source available) will skyrocket.

I sure hope the GPL doesn't get in the way of this.  Sure, the developer
has to publish source code, but he doesn't have to give away his hardware,
and he can charge "market value" for his hardware - with the software in
ROM.  This price can be relatively high, the only limit is the fear that
someone will clone the hardware (usually a large fraction of the cost),
take the (by now out of date) published software, sell and maintain the
system independently.  Most industrial control markets are not large enough
to sustain that kind of duplication of effort.

Go ahead, make my day!  Get out your flamethrowers!  I am personally sick
of dealing with the pitiful excuse for microcontroller software that
companies stick their end user with because they are afraid to pay for
(and pass on the cost of) real software!  With Linux, GCC, and Cyrix,
they don't have an excuse any more!

The "mistake" in question was the bogus copyright notice in the SLS
scripts. Nice how Peter can leech a living off free software and than
refuse to give any back. I doubt changing the notice now means anything
since the scripts were released without it in SLS through version 1.03.

Well, on a 486DX40, with 8K internal cache and 256K (suspected
write-back) cache, with both caches on, time reports about a 14 minute
composite time for user and system stuff during a kernek compile.
Shutting off the external cache added less than a minute to that, but
shutting off the internal cache added 8 more minutes.  I'd definitely
say that a small cache for locality is essential, but the larger
caches don't seem to help much.

A nominal fee is required to register a copyright in the US.  However, 
registration isn't required to enforce a copyright.

At least in the US, copyright violation can be a crime.  There are both
civil and criminal copyright laws.  I believe, however, that you must
register a copyright with the Library of Congress in order to have criminal
protection.

Subject: Linux Hardware Device Qualification Program
Date: Wed, 25 Aug 1993 21:45:14 GMT

I've seen a lot of messages about various hardware cards not working
with Linux because the manufacturer won't publish the device driver source,
and won't publish information on the device interface. Some examples of
these may be the Xircom laptop ethernet adaptor, the Diamond Stealth VGA
card and others. In the case of Diamond and Xircom, I've heard that there's
a nasty legal agreement required to see the hardware documentation, and that
agreement prohibits free redistribution of software written using that
documentation.

Now that Linux is becoming popular enough to get the marketing people
of hardware manufacturers interested, we need a hardware qualification
program that will appeal to those marketing people as a means of getting
them to open up to us.

So, I propose the Linux Hardware Device Qualification Program. This is
a voluntary program for hardware manufacturers in which they certify that
they comply with certain requirements so that they can advertise their
product as being "Linux Qualified". You'll have noticed that Microsoft
operates this kind of program for MS/Windows compatible products - the
manufacturer gets to put the Windows logo on the box once they've
qualified.

I propose three levels of qualification. "Linux Qualified",
"Linux-Compatible: Driver Available", and "Linux-Compatible: Driver
Enclosed". Once a manufacturer attains the "Linux-Compatible: Driver
Available" or "Linux-Compatible: Driver Enclosed" qualification for a
hardware device, they are allowed to place the (copyrighted)
Linix-Compatible logo on their package, with the words "Driver
Available" or "Driver Enclosed" below it. The "Linux Qualified" level
is for hardware for which there is no obstruction in the way of anyone
who would like to write a device driver, but no driver has been written
and thus the hardware is not yet Linux-Compatible. Here's what I
propose we require for each of the levels of qualification.

To attain "Linix Qualified" status, a manufacturer must:
        1.      Publish sufficient documentation so that a competent programmer
                could write a driver for the device that would support all of the
                features of the hardware.

        1a.     The documentation must not require a non-disclosure agreement, and
                must not prohibit the free distribution of software created using
                information in the documentation.

        1b. The documentation must be distributed at least one of these forms:
                        I. As a computer data file that may be freely redistributed
                           and printed.

                        II. As a paper document that is available from the manufacturer
                            for the cost of printing and handling, where such cost is
                            not to exceed US$50.

        2.      Publish updates and corrections to the documentation in a timely
                manner when it is discovered that an ommission or error in the
                documentation might make it difficult for a complete or correct
                device driver to be written by a competent programmer using that
                documentation.

        The "Linux Qualified" status is to be viewed as a stepping-stone to
        one of the higher qualifications, since there is little point for
        most users to purchase hardware before a device driver is available.

To obtain the "Linux-Compatible: Driver Available" level, a
manufacturer must meet the requirements for "Linux Qualified" status,
and there must be freely redistributable Linux device-driver source
code available from some accessable public location such as a BBS or
the Internet. Once a manufacturer has met the requirements, they may
place the "Linux-Compatible" logo on their product and its advertising,
with the words "Driver Available" below it. If they haven't met one of
the requirements, they would be in violation of the copyright on the
logo.

To obtain the "Linux-Compatible: Driver Enclosed" level, a manufacturer
must meet the requirements for "Linux-Compatible: Driver Available"
status, and must enclose a machine-readable copy of the driver,
including freely redistributable source code, with the product. Once a
manufacturer has met the requirements, they may use "Linux-Compatible"
logo as above, with the words "Driver Enclosed" below it.

I'd like to know what others think of this. Please reply via e-mail, I
will summarize to the net.

There are things like page tables that are accessed quite often and would tend
to stay "fresh" in the cache --- and because they're accessed do often, they
would reap a considerable benefit.  Also, the larger the cache, the better the
performance --- with a 256K cache (most modern motherboards support this)
you'd need a fair number of active processes or a random touch-address loop to
fall out.  Most programs won't touch that many pages of memory during their
quantum.

        information in the documentation.

    1b. The documentation must be distributed in at least one of these forms:
            I.  As a computer data file that may be freely redistributed
                and printed.

            II. As a paper document that is available from the manufacturer
                for the cost of printing and handling, where such cost is
                not to exceed US$30.

    2.  Publish updates and corrections to the documentation in a timely
        manner when it is discovered that an ommission or error in the
        documentation might make it difficult for a complete or correct
        device driver to be written by a competent programmer using that
        documentation.

    The "Linux Qualified" status is to be viewed as a stepping-stone to
    one of the higher qualifications, since there is little point for
    most users to purchase hardware before a device driver is available.

To obtain the "Linux-Compatible: Driver Available" level, a
manufacturer must meet the requirements for "Linux Qualified" status,
and there must be freely redistributable Linux device-driver source
code available from some accessable public location such as a BBS or
the Internet. Once a manufacturer has met the requirements, they may
place the "Linux-Compatible" logo on their product and its advertising,
with the words "Driver Available" below it. If they haven't met one of
the requirements, they would be in violation of the copyright on the
logo.

To obtain the "Linux-Compatible: Driver Enclosed" level, a manufacturer
must meet the requirements for "Linux-Compatible: Driver Available"
status, and must enclose a machine-readable copy of the driver,
including freely redistributable source code, with the product. Once a
manufacturer has met the requirements, they may use "Linux-Compatible"
logo as above, with the words "Driver Enclosed" below it.

I'd like to know what others think of this. Please reply via e-mail, I
will summarize to the net.

    Thanks

I don't know how trivial it is.  The impression I got speaking to the IBM
engineers was that it was quite easy.  But, I am sure IBM had the Wabi
code long before even Sun announced it.

Actually, what I see here is something along the lines of what happened
to Microsoft back in the early days of MS-Dos.  If you remember, Compaq
licensed the DOS code and came out with a new version that broke the
32Meg disk barrier.  This became extremely popular in the DOS world and
Microsoft had to scramble to incorporate and support this Compaq feature
in order to stay competitive.  So, in effect, MS lost partial design
control over their own environment.  This will happen to Windows as well.
MS will not be able to maintain control forever.  As other companies
invest money in creating Windows applications, these companies will be
dictating the future of the Windows API.  If MS changes their basic
API structure they stand to lose a lot of business because 3rd party
developers may opt to not support these new MS changes and instead just
recommend using an older version of Windows, Wabi or any other Windows-like
environment.  Apple will soon have its own Wabi and I am sure quite a few
of them will appear.  MS will no longer be the only provider of Windows
just like they are not the only provider of DOS today.
