...  and there's also something called differential SCSI.  Might be one of
the formats you already mentioned -- but I've read that you MUST have a
differential controller to use that kind of drive.

   Unfortunatly, it seems a little out of date.

Sometimes it's because private directories aren't mirrored --- you have
to go directly to tsx-11.  Sometimes it's because the person uploading
the sources have chosen not to upload their package to tsx-11, and has
only uploaded it to sunsite, or some other FTP site.  Sometimes it's
because we (the tsx-11 FTP administrators) have just been too busy and
have let something slip through the cracks.

   examples:

   .../ALPHA/Wine    just a readme while Wine 0.3.1 is allready released

This is located in a private directory which won't be mirrored
correctly; you have to get it from tsx-11.

   .../ALPHA/QIC-80  ftape-0.9.3 while there's 0.9.6 out !

This was a combination of 0.9.6 was not uploaded to tsx-11, and since I
don't use a QIC-80 tape, I didn't realize how far behind we had gotten.
I've since fixed it.

If you find more things like this, I'd appreciate it if you would send
me email --- I'd be happy to fix things if I can.

This was due to one of the shell scripts that we fork off having
#!/bin/csh rather than #!/bin/sh as the first line.  Changing this to
the latter fixes this problem.  The troubled file should be in
/usr/lib/X11/uib/templates/C++/subclass, but I no longer have this
release around, so I can't be more specific than this.

This problem is corrected in the upcoming release shared library
release, due out next Wednesday, barring major problems cropping up
this weekend.  Watch for an announcement in cola.

I got an FLI viewer from:

It's really tiny (about 20 k, compressed).
It worked without change on a Sequent, however I haven't tried it under Linux so far.

I hope that helps.

Subject: SCSI Timeouts with my Sankyo Streamer
Date: Fri, 17 Sep 1993 20:24:14 GMT

I have had a 280 MB SCSI II Seagate Hard Disc Drive running off my
Adaptek 1540B SCSI controller under Linux for ages with no problems at
all so far.

I have now added a Sankyo CP150SE Tape streamer to the chain, and this
seems to be causing timeouts during my backing up with tar. (That is, 
the timeouts are from the card, and are seemingly nothing to do with 
the HDD).

During a tar to /dev/rmt0, I get 

SCSI host 0 timed out - aborting command

Now, sometimes the tar carries on (but I haven't been able to check the
integrity of the archives it produces yet), and *once*, it has just 
sent the tar completely ker-put!

The SCSI cable is all internal (hence I don't think it's a length problem).

Anyone got any ideas ?

Chris.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in

Yes I have!

I have some patches here.
They are coming from Nigel Gamble, Boca Raton, FL, USA.

He has done a little nice work, and I will be glad to offer anyone,
who asked me for the patches, to send a copy of it by mail.

I dont want to post it here, because I not sure if he would like that.
But when you mail me, I have a little bit control of who use it.

So if you are firm with playing with kernel sources, it is because you
must patch it by hand, send me a mail, and you will recive a copy.

Subject: Re: Hard Drive/Controller Question...

The SCSI-II standard is an extension of the SCSI-I standard that includes
more commands, more messages, command queueing, an option to include "Fast"
devices (10Mhz), and options to include "Wide" devices, etc.

The options regarding the bus types are:-

Single Ended.

This is available as a 25 signal, 50 conductor interface (SCSI-I or SCSI-II),
or 34 signal, 68 conductor SCSI-II interface. The maximum cable length allowed
for the whole of the bus is limited to 6 meters and needs to be terminated with
a single ended terminator.

Differential.

This type of SCSI interface is available in the same cabling arrangements as the
single ended above, the main difference being in the maximum cable length which
goes up to 25 meters, and this type needs to be terminated in a.... differential
terminator.

Both of the above are available as 'narrow' (50 conductor), or 'wide' (68
conductor).

Fast SCSI.

This option is not available to SCSI-I devices (as far as I know), and was 
introduced with the SCSI-II standard (and will no doubt be included with the
SCSI-III and succesive SCSI standards). It is recommended that the cabling
length should not exceed 3 meters in this option.

The Adaptec range that you quote support 'Narrow single ended' SCSI devices
and I think they are only SCSI-I interfaces (can someone verify). The SCSI
standard (SCSI-I or SCSI-II) is initiated by the Host Bus Adapter and there
should not be a problem supporting SCSI-I or SCSI-II devices using the 1542
HBA, but bear in mind that the HBA will support SCSI-II devices as SCSI-I.
I am not sure as to whether Adaptec support the Fast option on SCSI-II with 
with any of their range of SCSI adapters.

Hope this helps.

Darren.

Apologies for requoting the entire article, but I've crossposted to
c.o.l.development, and wanted it seen there.

I've been having similar problems since I added a Tandberg SCSI tape to
my system, have posted about them previously, and just posted about them
again in c.o.l.development in reaction to a related posting I saw there.

Consensus up until now has been that this resulted from something
specific to my system.  Your description of the problems you're having,
however, sounds like the same thing I'm seeing.

By the way, I replaced my internal SCSI cables and saw no change in
the problem.  I did see the problems dimish (but not disappear) when
I replaced my Adaptec 1542C with a 1540B.

TeXinfo preferred I should think!  Texinfo, as all you emacs users out

copy emacs manuals (emacs 19 manual, Emacs Lisp manual) and
corresponding online hypertext versions from a single source file
(namely the *.texi file).  Why have *only* beautiful hardcopy output
when we can have beautiful hardcopy output AND a hypertext version for
little extra work!

        - I notified my subscribers (about 20 at the time, as I recall)
          that this was the case, and sent them refunds for the remaining
          time on their subscriptions, then running $5.00/month.

        - After lilink.com shut down, I changed jobs several times over the
          course of a few years. It's quite probable the he sent me email
          at one of the 'old' locations, which I've no way of retrieving.

        - If Mr. Faiwiszewski didn't get his refund I apologize for the mistake.
          These things *do* happen. I'm still waiting for my refund check from
          Intuit for a Quicken purchase. I don't think anyone would presume
          to insist that Intuit is a dishonest firm.

        - Since I no longer maintain the records of that former
          enterprise, I cannot say whether in fact I did send him
          a check, although it's possible given the confusion at the
          time that I did not. I'd rather resolve a dispute in favor
          of a customer, particularly when in this instance it involves
          an amount of at most $15.00. Send us your address, we'll be
          happy to forward you a refund check.

        - I have many satisfied customers who've purchased Linux, support,
          and dialup UUCP feeds from us. I don't think any single one of
          them would have a single complaint about our services or support.



          

: You would be foolish to send money to a person who obviously has no
: integrity and/or morals.


Steve, I believe that this is a bit overstated given the reasons 
I've stated above.  As I said, send us your address and we'll send 
you a check. I run a respectable business and intend to maintain it 
that way. I really wish you had contacted us via email, first. This entire
matter could have been resolved with my having to publicly explain 
something that was really a matter of miscommunication.
