Does anyone have good and simple database program for linux ?


Currently I have several databases that are made by paradox for msdos

Yesterday I recompile lastest Ingres, but it's too complex to use every

Is someone have bought the Nascent CD-ROM ?

How do you feel with this distribution? Their announcment predicate good
things but I've not heard about people using it.

What is the best distribution and the more complete on CD-ROM ?

I've heard that Ydgrasil (or something like that) seems bugged.

I have a Mitsumi CDROM mounted in a 386SX machine, and am using the
InfoMagic linux distribution.  In order to read my CDROM in linux, I used
the kernel source located on the CDROM in distribution directory b4, file
lx99p9.tgz, AND applied the patches in that same directory, lxpatch.tgz.
I'm not using lilo, but am booting from a floppy; in order to get the irq
and port settings to work right for the Mitsumi, I edited the mcd.c file to
expressly reference the settings on my machine in the macro #define's at
the top of the file.  However, I noted that the patches seemed to address
the ISO9660 compatibility, too - I have no problems.  

I hope this is not 'ancient' technology, in terms of the current patch
level, but it worked for me!

Subject: Improving graphics card perfomance with SVGALIB93
Date: 24 Nov 1993 04:58:49 GMT

        I picked up the svgalib package.  I wonder if it would be
possible to have transperant bank switching a la djgpp?
        Ie have only the current bank's address space accessable and if
the program tries to access other bank address areas, this causes a page
fault.  This causes the video driver to change the video bank, remap the
address area and restart the faulted instruction.

        Can this be done under Linux?  Is it possible to have an
exception handler (maybe SIGSEGV) catch memory accesses, handle them
appropriately and restart the instruction so the memory access completes
properly?  What about the dosemu system calls, are they useful?

        This scheme saves a lot of time in most graphics programs that
access the video memory from top to bottom and line wise.  The actual
bank switching (and page fault overhead) is infrequent and then doesnt
consume much overall time.

        Also regarding the chipset register capture program for ET4000s,
i think a more reliable and generic method would be to program a VESA
VBE interface to go thru the modes under DOS.  Then all supported modes
could be captured (eg tseng3.exe doesnt work on my system, and i doubt
that it would get my 640*350*256 mode anyway).  Also this method would
be protable to different chipsets so that resident program that tune the
screen width/centering/refresh could be used to derive better display on
different monitors.  In general i think its better to let the
manufacturer decide how to set up modes etc thru the BIOS (and via VESA)
than to roll your own or accept a 'standard register set'.  Also VESA is
much more reliable than probing the BIOS blindly.  
As a side note, i found that
different register values from the supplied ET4000 register files,
resulted in the default ET4000 values giving 1.8MBytes/s.  With the
some of the others i get 4.88MBytes/s on all video modes!  Go figure!



        One other question, is there a facility to have an exception
handler called at regular intervals say every 100mS?  Also by what
amount can the Linux timer interrupt be changed (from 100Hz) and not
cause any problems?  This would be to fine-tune the delay.  Also what
variation in delay can one expect in the exception handler under
differing conditons?
 
        Thanks,
        Junaid

I thought you may have put the limit in to prevent damage from gross stupidity: 

E.g. using a clock of 135 on a monitor designed for a max of 28...

Or perhaps a programming problem, or to "cover your ass" (understandable).

But if one's monitor can handle > 85 MHz, what's the problem?

I HAVE heard of frying monitors, and understand how that can happen, but how 
in hell does one fry a _CARD_??? That's a new one. I have _NEVER_ heard of 
that!

If there is a danger to the card, wouldn't the card itself prevent values 
that can damage it? It can't protect the monitor, since it doesn't know 
the specs of what is at the other end, but it darn well should know its 
own safe limits. If the card can be fried through software, it is _DEFECTIVE 
BY DESIGN_. You can't fry an 80486, or a FDC, or a UART or a SoundBlaster, or 
any of a number of different devices through software as far as I know.

Plus, what if a user as a card that is like the one you designed for, but 
actually can handle up to 135, for example. Should he/she suffer with the 85 
MHz limit then.

Hard limits can be a hose, leave it up to the users (do warn them first...). 
At least allow an override option for those that can use it.

P.S. I'd really like to know how one can fry a _CARD_. Any reports of that?

P.P.S. When I suggested the workaround, I did mention it could be risky. I 
then assume that the user will only use it if he/she knows it is safe and 
knows what they are doing.

I got two CD's the other day. Both came in broken plastic cases. One cd
wasn't marked on eather side. The other CD says Vol ONE ISSUE THREE-
MAY-JUN. I ordered these cd's sometime in July and had given up a long
time ago. I ordered LDX and got the CD the same week with a little

I want to return these CD's but havn't been able to reach JANA by

Whatever you do, DON'T write down the clocks detected from your card
in order and number them 1, 2, 3, 4, etc, and then include a line like:

Clocks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 (however many your card has)

And then specify a line like:

 "1024x768"            1     1024 1032 1176 1344    768  771  777  806
                       ^ Where this is the number of the clock you want.

The reason this is incredibly dangerous, if not downright STUPID, and
something you should NEVER DO, is because you'll get that clock whether
it's over the hard limit or not.

>P.S. I'd really like to know how one can fry a _CARD_. Any reports of that?

Actually yes. Dirk told me he fried his own card by running it with too
high a clock. Many of the new accelarated cards come programmed with clocks
that will fry them for sure if you use them. I don't know why
the manufacturers include them. (maybe to sell more cards!)

Therefore, you should not circumvent the hard coded limit unless you want
to toast your card.

I hope that was enough of a warning to strongly discourage anyone from
trying this without good cause. It is a way around the limit that is known
to work, though. (until you can smell the cooking silicon, anyway)

JE(Japanese Extension for SLS Linux) contains all the necessary 
binaries, fonts and others to use ASCII Japanese (La)TeX under Linux. 
You don't have to compile the TeX system; All you have to do is 
to make some room in your HDD, to invoke ezinstall, an installation 
programme, and to answer questions in the Japanese language. :)

When you hit any trouble, drop me an e-mail or post an article to
fj.os.linux if you can access it; Japanese Linuxers will answer 
your question in English or in other languages. :-)

You can get JE from ftp.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp:/Linux/JE or other 
Japanese ftp sites. Make sure to get JE with version 0.9 or greater, 
because earlier version (no version number was given before 0.9)
had some fonts  problems. Note that 'jt' disk sets are for Japanese 
TeX, and 'jf' disks are for 'Japanese fonts' including scalable
fonts to print. You might need an Japanese terminal software, an 
editor, an alphabet-kanji converter and so on to make Japanese 
documents in TeX, all of which can be found in the JE package.

Enjoy,

Hello Folks,

I recently updated from Linux 0.99.8 to kernel 0.99.13. 
Compilation and installation worked fine, but I found out that my

works fine however.

When I try to cu or kermit, it always says 'all ports busy'. There

fine.

I would be glad for any hint. Please respond by e-mail too

When the thread nearly ended, I offered to write a piece for the FAQ,
including a tabulation of BogoMips for various processors.`
But then someone derived a formula with which you could determine
the number of BogoMips depending on processor speed & type.
And someone else said he had already written a FAQ-piece. We discussed
this per email, and yet IT IS IN THE FAQ.

So, in the Linux FAQ, there is now a question What is a BogoMip? and the
explanation includes a formula for calculating your desired BogoMips on
your processor.

If you want a tabulation:

for(i=0; i<66; i++)
  printf("386DX%i: %i\t486DX%i: %i.\n", i, form386(i), i, form486(i) );

Hope this helps :-)
