                Unix

                drive, 
                booting from the WD.  Maxtor wouldn't be slave, or WD
                couldn't
                be master.  So, I boot from Maxtor, now.

                year or so

                problems, and had
                to run Drivepro which worked for about 700 cylinders of a
                total of
                1000, and put 386BSD on the good part of the drive, and
                DOS on the

                (Feb of this

                340K in bad sectors.  I am hoping that when I install
                Linux again in
                a week or two that I won't have problems, but if I do I
                will have to

                Drive has worked pretty well, though could be faster. 
                Seems to have
                some spinning problems (continues after drive access),
                but need to
                investigate further.

        PROBS   No problems at all with the drive.  Had to fiddle some
                jumpers
                when I added a second WD 340.  Friggin drives came with 
                no docs - luckily the io card docs had enough clues. Had
                to unjumper
                something on the io board and jumper each of the drives
                (1 as 
                master (MS) one as slave (SL)).
                (the clone inlcuded an IDE disk ribbon cable that
                supported 2 drives
                already)

                trys
                (start spinning and stop after 1..2 seconds) and a few
                messages like

                which, but I
                think it's the WD) consistently has trouble at power-on
                only (trying
                to unpark the heads?), but it always comes around after a
                few tries.
