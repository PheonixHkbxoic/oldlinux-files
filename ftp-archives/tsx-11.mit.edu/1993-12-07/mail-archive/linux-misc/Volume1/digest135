Subject: Autodesk FLI player for Linux?
Date: 15 Sep 1993 19:13:25 -0700


I'm looking for a FLI or FLC player (Autodesk Animator format) for
Linux (source or binary).  I've scoured comp.graphics.animation and the 
Linux groups for any reference to any animation player and have come up 
with nothing.

Actually an animation player for a format other than FLI might work -
if I can convert FLIs to that format.

I'd really appreciate any info on the whereabouts of such a beast.

Thanks a lot,
Kirk

While I do not know if the guy is good or bad (never met, spoken to,
or in any had contact with him), I have to agree that the INTERNET is
the best source for help around.  I posted a question about Emacs and
linuxp12, and got an answer within 12 hours.  I even asked Linus, and
he responded with the answer I was looking needed (as he has to all my
naive questions, thanks Linus).

On some TeX questions I got answers within 10 MINUTES!  If one has
internet access one does not need to pay for help through it.  Just get
Usenet access if you can, or use mailing lists.  The only thing I
would say is that we need to read the docs more, I am sure my
questions could have been answered if I scrounged around the docs
more.  I think that is what people are afraid off, that they will get
flamed if they ask a question others may view as dumb. :-(

In general ... but what about exceptions? I'm new to Linux and somewhat
mystified by this shared-library business, and I'm not sure what to do
when I download a binary and find that it complains about not finding a
particular version of libc (as happened with rz/sz the other night). Why
does this happen? I tried creating a link in the lib directory to a newer
version of libc, but my only reward was a segmentation fault/core dump.

Well, are you sure that mgetty 0.13 is running? In older versions, this
was common (well... that's what you get if you use unbuffered one-byte
read()s for ease of implementing), but in 0.13 the fax reception stuff
has been changed to use buffered read()s.

With the old unbuffered reads, it was very likely that data is lost, but
with 0.13, I have tried receiving a five-page fax while the system load
was at 5 (!) - and no lost any data at all (on a 386/40).

Does your port use a 16550? Which port speed do you use for fax
reception?

>I seem to have noticed that even during

That will not do any harm, since only the direction *to* the modem is
postprocessed by the serial driver.

One problem *may* be that you use a fairly old linux version, I think in
the serial driver had been a lot changes since then, improving reliability
at high speeds.

Subject: BBGopher 1.6 is ready...
From: morley@suncad.camosun.bc.ca (Mark Morley)
Date: 15 Sep 93 09:05:51 PDT

Hi all,

BBGopher 1.6 is ready and available.  This version fixes a bug or two and
adds a feature here and there.  Here's the README for those who are
interested:

===========================================================================
BBGopher 1.6
Copyright 1993 by Mark Morley

   You may use and distribute this code in any way you like.  It is free and
   there are no strings attached.  All I ask is that my name stays in the
   program (source and binaries).

FTP Site: suncad.camosun.bc.ca:/pub/morley/bbgopher1.6.tar.Z

BBGopher is an alternative Gopher client for Unix based systems.  I develop it
under Linux .99pl12 and SunOS 4.1.2 simultaneously, I suspect it'll compile
"out of the box" on most systems that support sockets.

New features and bug fixes since version 1.4:
(note that version 1.5 was internal)
   - Added the variable BADPORTS to the config file.  You can now supply a
     list of port numbers that are "not allowed".  This is useful to block
     users from using certain services.  For example, we need to stop users
     from accessing MUD's and public Telnet sites.
   - Fixed a small bug having to do with index searches.  BBGopher was not
     sending a carriage return after the search string, so the host was
     chopping off the last character.  Ouch.
   - Changed the way BBGopher created temporary file names.  Any BBGopher
     droppings should now be recognisable in the form "bbgo......"

This version of BBGopher supports the following item types:
   Text files (can me mailed or saved after viewing them)
   Directories
   Binary transfers (DOS, UUE, HQX, etc)
   Telnet
   TN3270
   Index searches
   Informational Text

Features:
        - Provides a simple scrolling interface (but still looks good!) that
          should work on _any_ terminal.
        - You can lock users into using a specific directory for saving text
          files.
        - You can grant or deny access to any item type on a per user basis.
        - You can define an external pager for viewing files, although there
          is a simple one built in.
        - You can define things like which mailer to use, which telnet binary
          to run, etc.
        - Easy configuration via an ascii config file.
        - Support for bookmarks.  Bookmarks are automatically sorted as well.
        - The '=' command gives you details on a specific menu item.

Installation:
        1) Uncompress and expand the tar file.
        2) Type 'makeit'
        3) Move the file bbgopher.conf into the /usr/local/etc directory.
           If you'd prefer a different file/path name then you must edit
           the file bbgopher.c and change the #define near the top of the
           program.
        4) Edit the bbgopher.conf file (or whatever you decided to call it)
           to configure it for your site.  Be sure and read the comments
           in the sample config file carefully.  Make sure this file is
           marked as readable by everyone.
        5) Move the file bbgopher.help into the appropriate directory.  You
           must be sure to define the path/filename for the help file in
           the config file.  You can place this file anywhere you like and
           give it any name you like.  A sample file is provided, but you
           may want to edit it to suit your tastes.  Make sure this file is
           marked as readable by everyone.
        6) Move the file bbgopher to a directory on the users' path.  I use
           /usr/local/bin.  Anything is fine.
        7) That's it!

Notice:
        This software was and is developed in what little spare time I have.
        I can't promise much in the way of support, but I'll try and answer
        any mail I may get.  Bug reports, success reports, suggestions, etc.
        are all welcome.

Subject: M-Script BBS Programming Language
From: morley@suncad.camosun.bc.ca (Mark Morley)
Date: 15 Sep 93 11:30:47 PDT

Well, I got more than a few responses to my post about M-Script.  It seems
everyone wants to be a beta tester.

Last night I started writing a Programmer's Reference Guide for M-Script. 
It's only about 15 pages so far, but it's growing. I hope to have the first
version of it finished today.  When it is I'll contact those of you who
responded and get the M-Script interpreter and the guide to you.

The programmer's guide will be in Postscript format.  Anyone have a
problem with this?  I could try and make an ASCII version, but I can't
promise it'll be pretty.

For those who didn't catch my post: M-Script is a new interpreted
programming language I designed specifically for writing BBS's and other
on-line systems.  Currently it's only available under Unix, but I forsee a
DOS based interpreter in the future.  The language is similar to dBase or
BASIC and is surprisingly powerful already, considering I only started
working on it a two Saturdays ago.  It seems pretty fast to me, and the
interpreter is less than 50K in size (so far).  It includes all sorts of
low and high level commands to do things like ANSI colors, data entry,
menus, hypertext screens, forms, a two-way scrolling file browser,
broadcast messages, FTP, Finger, etc.  You can even write new M-Script
procedures in M-Script itself, then call those procedures from elsewhere in
your program.  So far my coding can barely keep up to my ideas, so it's
bound to grow into a really powerful language. 

Anyway, as always I'm open to ideas, wish lists, questions, constructive
criticisms, etc.

Mark
morley@camosun.bc.ca

PS: I post this in the Linux group because I'm doing all my development of
    M-Script under Linux .99p12  I thought people here would be interested.

PPS: Again, you can get a (pretty lame) demo of M-Script by telnetting to
     buckyball.camosun.bc.ca (134.87.16.6) and logging in as 'guest',
     password is also 'guest'.  Be forwarned that what you see is just my
     test system, it's not meant to be a real BBS or anything.  It wasn't
     even meant to be a demo for M-Script!  I borrowed a few files from my
     real BBS, that explains the "Island Net" references.  Everything you
     see is an M-Script program - NOT C OR SHELL SCRIPTS!

I remember a post of earlier in the week that asked was there such a service as this
available. The post basically said that a chap was trying to persuade his company
to use Linux for 'serious' ( no flames plz ) or commercial applications, but
without some form of telephone support they were unwilling to do so.

Also please remember that some people are not willing to delve ( read hack ) into
the bowels of a Unix system to fix a bug without some real-time guidance. When you
compare the quoted prices, & amount of s/w you get with Linux, to the cost of
a commercial Unix with telephone support is the deal really that bad ? 

Also what if you do not have news access ? Some companies will only allow 
newsgroups with 'business connections' to be read/posted to. Sure you have the
mailing lists, but ....

I say let them have a go. If they provide a big bang for the buck then people
will use them. If not, then they got something wrong in their marketing/services/
target population/whatever.

Also I hope you chaps at the LSS will continue the tradition of flaming people
over the phones :-)

Just my 0.02's worth.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in

 As a followup to this, I'd put my vote in for MSWord but also for
Interleaf and FrameMaker as "serious" DP packages. Both are X-based (Motif???).

  It would also be nice to have at least 1 commercial CAD pkg such as CV or
Mentor Graphics in addition to the PD-ware.

Well, I ordered one over two weeks ago, and it hasn't arrived yet.  It
was supposed to be shipped four days after my order was placed, and
then arrive 6-10 days later.  It wasn't shipped for two weeks (as I found
out yesterday when I called them)!  My credit card was charged four days
after the order was placed, so I had assumed that it had been shipped
almost two weeks ago.

Right now I am worried about my order.  It seems my sales-droid had been
fired sometime between the time he took my order and yesterday.  This
might explain the delay.  I was told my credit card was charged because
of the RAM market (BS), despite the fact that I was promised that it
wouldn't be charged until the order was shipped.  They just told me
that my video-board was back-ordered, so they shipped a cheaper board
(MUCH cheaper).  They also told me that the number on the invoice for
my disk adapter is wrong, but it *really* is an Adaptec 1742.

I feel that they should have called me for the video board, because I
would have cancelled that part of the order (I'd rather have an Orchid
than the ATI board anyway).  Likewise if they didn't actually ship the
Adaptec 1742, then I can't use the system, because I want to run unix,
not DOS, and the unix flavor I like doesn't support many SCSI boards.

Right now I am much more nervous than I was earlier, because I know that
they messed up in some things.

On the other hand, if they actually did get the disk adapter right, and
they do send me the ATI board eventually, and the system does work,
then I'll have nothing to complain about.  They do seem to have good
systems for a good price.  I'll let people know when/if I do get my
system (Friday with a small miracle, more likely Monday -- IF they shipped
Monday like they told me over the phone).
