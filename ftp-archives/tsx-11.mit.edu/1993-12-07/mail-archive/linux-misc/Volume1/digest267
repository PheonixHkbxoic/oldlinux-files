Has anybody ported larn to Linux?

I got the sources (from jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu) and got them to compile, after
#defining SIGEMT = SIGUNUSED, SIGBUS = SIGUSR1, and SIGSYS = SIGUSR2. (I
hope that was the right thing to do.)

However, with VT100 defined in the sources, larn complains that Linux isn't
a vt100. Without VT100, it won't compile because of a number of t_<output>
functions that aren't defined. I've tried linking with curses, ncurses,
termcap library, etc., without success.

I'm sure I can fix this, but I'd rather not reinvent the wheel.

Subject: [SUMMARY] Has anyone built a gcc cross-compiler?
Date: Tue, 2 Nov 1993 19:06:58 GMT


Last week I posted a query to comp.os.linux.misc asking whether it is 
possible to create a gcc cross-compiler to allow applications (created by
OI, which is free on Linux) created on my Linux-486 to run on other
hardware (workstations.)

The answer is no, because the OI libraries are compiled for 386/486 and 
obviously not compatible with other hardware.  You would need to get OI for
the other platforms and then give it a shot.

   It's probably just a resource line that sets the expert flag. Try
   pressing the 'x' key over the xdvi window, and see if the buttons come
   to life. If they do, you'll have to find a line in an Xdefaults or
   Xresources file which specifies something like (I'm guessing):

I thought Dunbar, the maintainer of the SLS TeX package buildt xdvi
with the buttons disabled in the latest releases of the package ?
Correct me if I'm wrong.

   If pressing 'x' doesn't reveal the buttons, something funny is up, and
   you're gonna have to ask someone else. I'm using SLS though, and I get
   buttons if I want them. 

Which SLS version are you using ?

Didn't they include IFS (iheriting file system) on their CD???
I have successfully compiled many sources off an older version of the Yggdrasil
CD. Just try to enable IFS in make config and then do something like:

        mkdir /CD
        mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /CD
        mkdir /usr/src/from_cd
        smount -t ifs /usr/src/from_cd,/CD/usr/src /usr/src/from_cd

Then you could compile in /usr/src/from_cd/whatever and have the sources from
/CD/usr/src/whatever and any object files created on the partition with
/usr/src/from_cd.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.

The problem is that most versions of xdvi floating around at the moment were
compiled without the -DBUTTONS flag.  I got xdvi-fli-bin.tar.Z from sunsite
(it's in /pub/linux/X11/xapps/graphics), and recompiled it with -DBUTTONS

The Slackware I installed (1.0.3) included a crontab entry for root
that touched a file in /tmp every minute.  This might be causing some
extra activity on your machine.  Even without that though, there are
other files that are normally accessed by the daemons which need to
be updated every once in a while.

Welcome to the world of Linux (*N*X in general). A *N*X system needs to do
some bookkeeping to put it simply. At regular intervals it needs to
write things to the harddisk. That's also one the reasons that you
must do a clean shutdown of the system as opposed to the yanking of the
powerbutton on MSDOG-machines.

The Jumbo 250 uses the floppy controller or a special controller for

You might want to try spice3e2 + spicekit which is a kit that will
aid in porting spice3 for use on Linux. You can find both on sunsite.unc.edu.

If not, do an archie on spice3e2 as I am sure that it is being maintained

Subject: Slackware -- the complete list of problems.
Date: 3 Nov 93 17:27:57 +0100

Now that Andreas, Andrew, Andrej (that's me) and some others
have flamed about SLS, let's list mistakes in Slackware distribution.

1. BSD Games package 'y' puts 'fortune' at the end of /etc/profile
and /etc/csh.cshrc. This is *absolutely wrong*! Why? Because
initialization script for shell should not print anything to
stdout when run non-interactively. The 'y' package should either
do nothing, or properly nest 'fortune' inside the appropriate
'if' statement. In /etc/csh.rc this would be:

if ($?prompt) then
  fortune
endif

It's bad taste to put such things in global init scripts.

2. A friend of mine tried to compile kernel. It barfed. The 
problem was that /usr/include/linux was not a sysmbolic link
to /usr/src/linux/somewhere, but it was an 'almost good' copy
of the right directory. Of course, my friend does not read 
READ.ME files :-) It is Slackware's fault, though.

3. Yet another friend of mine tried to compile kernel on a fresh
Slackware installation. He mooed. Loader said 'virtual memory 
exhausted'. Since this was done on a fresh Slackware, it is a bug.
I told him to check if /usr/include/linux is linked properly :-)
My friend has a lot of RAM and his swapping is enabled, so this
could not have been the problem.

4. The swapping friend with large memory has got problems with
communication. Communicaion programs (minicom and seyon, I think)
don't work. They come from Slackware -- out of box, but they
don't work. 


Your are welcome to tell us about your problems with Slackware
(especially if your name starts with Andre). When we have listed
42 problems, we will e-mail them to slackware-bug-report@imaginary.foo.bar.

Let me follow myself up:

5. They say Emacs that comes with SLS doesn't work, unless you
install some X11 libraries. Well, it's the same with Slackware
1.04. I installed Slackware on a computer of a friend of mine
(a new one, not from previous post), without 'x' package. Emacs
didn't work. It said 'I need libXsomething.so'. That's better
than SLS Emacs, which dumpes core, but it's still bad. Couldn't
this be corrected? (I don't see how,-- either you have
X11 linked in, or not.) 

37 more to go.
