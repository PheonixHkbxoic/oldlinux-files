I am not sure that the sheer volume of postings constitutes something
good. In fact, if people have to post all the time it may be because
their is lack of information distribution or something outright wrong.

I have answer numerous postings about XS3 all which are probably 
documented somewhere in linux land or because the Linux activits
have not learned the fine Art of looking for an answer  to their questions
in their posted newsgroup. Sometimes I am amazed that after I
have answer a question just 5 or more postings later basically
the same question gets posted again by another Linux user.
It appears at least in my case, that Linux users are happy
posters (as in trigger-happy).

We have a news archive in Australis which we telnet to and which we can
do simple greps on subject lines and also we can dowload
subject indexes as well as whole batch of old postings.
It helps both to eliminate mundane postings as well as to
quickly get your answer.

The 386bsd community in terms of development tends to be quiet and
personal mostly due to popular hostile postings against progress
in our newsgroup.  For instance, NetBSD is being ported to
different platforms and I hear is up and running on some platforms.

Part of the lack of development effort is due to the syndrome of lets
wait for Bill Jolitz release. This problem has been directly
addressed by FreeBSD and NetBSD.

        Cheers,

Why "valid only in the US"???  Should be easy enough to prepend a (ANSI 1366?)

But what I'm worried about is multiple people with the same zip-code (e.g. same

No, it doesn't offer 5 times the functionality, but looking at the
kernel, most of the "bloat" is in fact device drivers (and the addition
of networking code since the early versions).  The current kernel has
about 95k-lines of C code (and almost 15k+ lines of headers and 5k lines
of assembly), but the breakdown is rather interesting:

kernel proper:                   4600 lines
memory management:               2300 lines
virtual filesystem layer:        6200 lines

That's the "essential" services, but you don't get far with just those:

each filesystem at about:        2500 lines (ranging from 1700 to 4000 lines)

character device drivers:       12000 lines
FPU emulator:                    7200 lines (+4000 of the 5000 lines of asm)
block drivers:                  18600 lines (12000 of which is SCSI supprot)

networking:                     21000 lines

+ various other sources, some of them used for the build process, rather
than for the kernel proper. 

As can be seen, the real kernel isn't really very big, and has actually
not gotten *that* much larger since the early days.  The device drivers
amount for about one third of the kernel (FPU-emulator counting as a
"device driver"), and they have indeed grown a lot (but that's not
bloat: it's mostly just the diversity of PC hardware which makes for a
lot of problems). 

The filesystems are about 20000 lines of C code total: about a fifth of
the kernel.  The individual filesystems haven't bloated very much, but
there are more of them (minix, ext, ext2, msdos, xiafs, nfs, isofs and
proc-fs).  Most of the code bears more than a passing resemblance to the
minix-fs code, so the "new" code is to a large part an adaptation of the
minix-fs code. 

Networking is similarly about 20000 lines of C code (this is including
the driver code which is not yet separate as the rest of the drivers). 

Back in early 1992 (version 0.12), there was no networking code, only
one filesystem (minix), no scsi devices or CDROM drivers, a much smaller
math-emulator (the one still in use by 386bsd right now?), no mouse
drivers etc.  Totally new code since then: at least 60klines of C code
(of 95klines!), mostly drivers.

You are right.  I knew it was one of those programs that are hard to
live without.  Even with the sh (didn't someone refer to is as
'half-ashed' :) in the state that it was, it presented a cost free
alternative to Minix-386, which still wound up costing around $100 (US).

If they only use features from the ANSI C library and POSIX.1: yes.  This
is, of course, a very small subset of UNIX applications.

I think that the 50k refers to the microkernel proper.  You need a bunch (at least
3) of subsystems loaded on top of that before WNT will do anything even remotely
interesting (actually: I've never seen WNT do anything except display a box
with the message "insufficient memory to run application").

Microsoft would have you believe that the MS-Windows GUI is (a) absolutely
perfect and (b) makes non-GUI operation utterly unnecessary.

Then, of course, they ship NT with no system administration tools and no
command line to do system administration the Unix-v7 way.  Pfthbbbbt.

allows MS-Windows programs to be compiled as real native Linux programs).

...except that SCO has its own opinion of NT, and it isn't a favorable one.
In fact, the BOD had several arguments over it, since the MS folks on the BOD
didn't really want SCO making a big push into the same market NT is targeted
at....

Although I admit that one could easily build a conspirtacy theory about SCO's
stock "crash".

Face it, folks:  Microshaft is, as always, lying.  They can't help it.
They're a marketing company, not a software company --- which explains why NT
is buggier than Linux for having started development earlier (supposedly).

Of course, by "unlimited", what is meant is that it depends on the
filesystem code which is outside the NT microkernel.  But since the
typical application programmer will not be programming for the
microkernel but for an API defined by a subsystem together with a
filesystem (or set of filesystems), the limits will not in practice
be unlimited. 

On the other hand, although Linux isn't by any measure a microkernel
OS, all of its source code is open and free.  So the task of adding
a device driver becomes one of adding code to the kernel instead of
running it at the user level.

So in that sense, Linux partition sizes and max file name lengths are
*also* unlimited.

As long as they only use the 1/3 or so of POSIX that Microshaft felt like
implementing.  Linux implements all of POSIX.1 and I believe most if not all
of POSIX.2.

Another good one is psf.  It has many options for formatting
including 1, 2, 4 virtual pages per page.  Its best feature is that
it can be installed as a print filter for lpr or lp and compiles out

I've found that doing this in /etc/rc.net (I'm on SLS 1.03) only works if the
slip route is defined *before* the loopback.

Also, when the dialup link is droped, the slip device is flushed for the route
table and I cannot re-install it as the default route. I need a re-boot to
get it back. This is a major bummer :-( 

Anyone care to comment?
