I should have thought of this before.  He's harping on the size of the
infinitesimal microkernel that can't run any real programs unless it loads a
large amount of driver code.

"Methinks he doth protest too much."  Does the concept of a system that can
run X in 4MB (Linux+X+fvwm+rxvt) scare him so *very* much?

Lessee... 124 days since April 18th with no corruption.  218 days since I
first installed an ext2fs-based system on January 14th and only one corrupted
filesystem... and that was because of a power failure.  How well does NTFS
handle those, or do you have to run a UPS if you value the integrity of your
disk?

Of course, if you literally meant extfs instead of ext2fs, there's no point in
comparing.  extfs was never stabilized because ext2fs was in progress, and it
was dumped when ext2fs became available; nobody bothered with it.  And these
days nobody is running it.  Although I admit it's perfectly in line with all
the other comparisons of the putatively best NT has to offer against the
absolute worst you could dredge out of the discard heap to offend Linux.

<insert belly laugh>

There are file managers for Linux.  There are GUIs for Linux.  All there
*isn't* for Linux is a monolith telling us what we *will* use because it's the
only thing that is or ever will be available for the purpose.

Drag and drop:  I run XView.  Guess what it supports?
File managers:  in general I consider file managers to be far more of a pain
than they're worth (except under DOS/MS-Windows, which is so lame that the
file manager is actually an *improvement* --- tell me, is it the same way for
NT?) but there are both Xaw-based and Motif-based file managers around.  And I
wouldn't be surprised to find an XView one on some archive site somewhere.

WP is in progress.  And we'll have the source for it.  Spreadsheets we have.
Comm programs --- Seyon blows DOS comm programs and that stupid "Terminal"
thing from DOS/MS-Windows out of the water.  And Windows comm programs require
a *hardware* fix (16550s) to operate properly --- I run 9600 baud + under
Seyon on my 386DX/33.  No 16550.  No RTS/CTS.  No lost characters.

From what I hear of NT's speed on a 386/33, I would suspect that not even a
16550 would be enough to make it work.

   No he cannot. These scripts were made specifically for the interface
   and installation of a GPLed product (linux), hence they fall under the
   GPL. If Peter made them for OS/2 or NT it would be another matter, but
   not here.

Ummm...isn't the problem that Slackware was attempting to use Peter's shell
scripts *without* properly acknowledging him ? (i.e. they removed the
copyright info...) I don't see Peter restricting the distribution of *anything*,
not even his scripts, as long as they retain proper attributions of the work
(isn't *that* the "spirit" of the GPL ?)

   It's also against the spirit of the GPL. Take a GPLed software and
   start imposing restrictions on its distribution. That's *exactly* what
   the GPL is intended to impede. You cannot have it both ways: make
   money out of GPL software and then complain when people start making
   use of the fact that it's under the GPL.

   Oh god, not this again.

   If you want to cripple OS/2 to bring it down to linux's level, do the
   following:

   Change the RUNWORKPLACE line in the config.sys to read "cmd.exe". This will
   start your system up in an OS/2 window instead of in the Workplace Shell.

   Why do you have to do this? Linux has no real interface available. X-windows
   plus a window manager is not even as functional as OS/2's old desktop manager
   interface.

Depends on how you define "functional"...if its the ability for *me* to get work
done, I find the OS/2 WPS much more restrictive than Linux + X...For you its
obviously just the opposite...no arguement, just "different strokes for different
folks..."

   Compare an OS/2 system like this to a standalone linux box running X, and the
   OS/2 system will blow it away. Period. I speak from experience.

again, depends on what you are doing...OS/2 has a bit of a problem having two
*seperate* users logged in at the same time, and doing networking/editing/compiling
while remaining completely seperate from one another...

   >|> let's face it, you have *NO* applcations, and as such all you can do
   >                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Wrong. OS/2 is already beating all the brands of UNIX put together (in sales)
   after a year, and we surely don't have 50% of the market. (source: some PC
   trade rag, I can't remember which one offhand)

Ummm...perhaps in the PC market, but PC's are *not* the entire computing world
in any form or fashion...don't forget about the main frames and workstations,
many of which run UNIX...so when you compare number of UNIX *users* to number
of OS/2 *users*, it looks abit different (considering 1 machine + 1 OS/2 = 
1 user, but 1 machine + 1 UNIX = 1..1000 users depending on the setup...:-)


   Post-flame-disclaimer: I think linux is a great hobbyist OS for those that
   want to study UNIX. I don't think, however, that users should be misled into
   thinking that it is a svelte super-powerful OS with reams of usable
   applications.


Nope, but don't be fooled, Linux *is* being used in production and software development
environments where UNIX...technical/scientific software is one area that OS/2 is only
now making in-roads in...

I see that you were able to be quite NEUTRAL throughout 
your post.

Your attempt to gain control of some "moral high ground"
by claiming "we didn't start this" is pathetic.  You are
doing nothing more than attempting to prolong this flame-
war which was probably started by someone who does not
subscribe to either group.  In a way, you did start this
war with your first post.  Most of the followups are 
directed at it.

Also, Linux is not shit.  It is an excellent operating 
system for what it was designed for.  Just because you
have no use for it does not mean it is not worthwhile 
for others.

Your earlier claims about the checklist were false.  The
checklist was very wrong in many spots, and your claims 
that it was "an objective comparison" are total horse-shit.
Anyone who knows about Linux knows that the list was 90% 
wrong or outdated.  So how are you capable of judging that
Linux is shit when you know nothing about it?

Also, you said the following about the people who flamed you
for being wrong: "SHEEP MENTALITY", "LYNCH MOB MENTALITY",
and "FANATIC MENTALITY".  When you make false claims that
most people know are false, you're going to get flames 
from many people on the same points.  As for claiming that
you did not write the list, it does not matter.  You stated
that the list was correct.  Making false claims and then
whining when you get flamed is bad form.

Why don't you go back and fight with the OS/2 people?  
They are the ones you really have to worry about.

Ooops!
Watch out! This implies that DOS, being a single-user-all-the-CPU-you-can-get
OS, is at least as fast as 386 Unices. BUT:

     Some time ago, I was talking with a friend of mine, trying to convince
her to switch from DOS to *BSD/Linux. She used her 386 box for (heavy? :) 
number crunching with Fortran, she was writing a Ph.D. thesis and was spending
most of her time calculating some fractal motion. So, I needed a little demo
to show her that she could indeed do all that she usually did under messdos
and pay 0.0 for it. I picked 386bsd, version 0.1 it was, when the first bunch
of patches was released, and compiled a tiny fortran->C source compiler I 
found on ref.tfs.com. It compiled her programs without a cough, and gcc did
the rest.

     Now, the copmarison. Those were EXACTLY THE SAME MACHINES. Bought from
a same vendor, exactly the same equipment inside, 387 FPU in both of them.
Fortran on DOS was an expensive commercial product, it was dos 5.0 if I 
remember well, and under DOS the program ran about a minute and five seconds
on both of them. We ran the program on BSD, fifteen seconds. Well, I know
that in real mode 386 emulates 32bit integer operations, but FOUR TIMES
FASTER!? Get real!

     All this probably holds for Linux as well. It seems that DOS engineers 
used some other mathematics in their time calculations. ;>

     Don't trust figures too much. Try and measure. You'll be surprized.

I've haven't looked myself, but several people have reported that all of
the scripts DID have the notice intact, and that the Slackware people didn't
try to take credit for any of those scripts.  All they did was modify how
they worked a bit.  Which, under the GPL is a perfectly ok thing to do...

When I first installed Linux, (December 1991), it was so slender that I 
could get all the base utilities including cc, vi, and kernel sources into
10M of disk (the only error free partition on my 45M MFM drive).

I also built kernels using GCC in 4M of main memory and no swap.

However, Linux didn't run X, didn't have shared libraries, programs had 
to be compiled for either hardware or software floating point (which didn't
work reliably), etc.

In the kernel, much of the "bloat" is from optional device drivers that 
you don't have to install (SCSI drivers, CD ROM, XD disk drivers - about 
20k, most of that SCSI) optional networking code (about 25K), and optional 
file systems (beyond ext2 as the unix filesystem - about 16K lines of code).

Ie, for many people, as little as half the code will end up in their kernels.

For the people who need some of those features (ie, those with SCSI disks
only), the "bloat" means an infinite increase in functionality, because without
it they couldn't run Linux period.

As to weather the rest of the code increase is worth it : I'd say yes.  That 
code gets you features like shared libraries, the fully unified buffer cache
vnode based vm, VFS, a full 387 emulator, and other features that make Linux 
more flexible, faster, and cleaner.

Again, a lot of that is optional.  Personally, I wouldn't use Open Look,
f2c, p2c, emacs, and many of the other programs included with it.  When 
you start getting rid of packages like Common Lisp (2M), unused X servers 
(1M each), etc. the space used drops off rapidly.

I'm trying to help a friend install linux on his machine.  He has an
almost identical setup as my system, but I cannot seem to get fdisk
to recognize his SCSI disk.  The setup is:

486/66
16mb RAM

Ultrastor 24F EISA SCSI controller

The SLS boot disk comes up just fine, but when I login as root
and type "fdisk /dev/sda" I get "unable to open /dev/sda".

I didn't get that error on my machine and I don't see any
mention of it in the FAQ or Getting Started book.

Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

For what it's worth, the machine is a Gateway2000 EISA box.  My
