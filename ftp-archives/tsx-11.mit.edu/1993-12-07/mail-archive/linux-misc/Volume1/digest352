No.  The 2742 is totally incompatable with the 1740/1540 series.

The Bustek boards, available in ISA, EISA, and VLB flavors, appear to work 
quite well with Linux and other operating systems.

Folks, please remember that Morse Telecommunications is not affiliated with

product and specify the contents. Additionally, we provide technical support 
for this product which was previously unavailable. 

I believe that we provide a high level of service and support and offer 
excellent value to the customer. Our recently announced Linux Quarterly 
($79/year for 4 Linux CD's) continues this trend. I think the multitude of
folks who've used our technical support service would agree with what I'm
saying here. We certainly don't turn our backs on anyone, and even take
quite a number of calls from folks who've bought their CD's from other
companies.

I'm digressing too much, though. The purpose of this is just to say that
Morse Telecom is *not* JANA. Please do not equate the problems associated
with them to our company. I personally invite ANY disattisfied customer
of JANA's to contact me. Tell me your problem. I will attempt to resolve
it with them directly. If they cannot resolve the issue, Morse Telecom
will make good on their promise. If this requires sending you a replacement
CD *AT OUR COST*, then we'll do it.

Mr Sen is correct that web-5.851d has TeX v 3.141. However, Knuth's 
tex.web for TeX 3.1415 has been out since june. the current TeX
binaries in the standard Linux TeX archives (ie texbin.tgz on the 
SLS t1 disk and TeX.tz in the Milieu package-at tsx-11) contain
 tex v 3.1415 
 tangle 4.4
 mf  v 2.71

my diffs against Berry's web2c-5.851d & web-5.851d can be found at
tsx-11.mit.edu in the dir pub/linux/packages/TeX/Milieu. besides the 
above update, the following changes were made:
 1) fixed a bug in the public web2c's openinout.c so that one can
    use MakeTeXTFM...ie if the tfm file isnt found, tex will call
    mf to make it just as xdvi, dvips, and dvilj will call a script
    to invoke mf to make the pk bitmap.
 2) changed default base dir (/usr/local) to /usr/TeX
 3) modified the default mf prompt (see my milieu.tz text for more 
    info..this is only of interest to those programming in mf)
 4) used fast-math flag which speeds mf up 5-10% if a coprocessor
    is available (no harm if none)
 i think that's all the changes but look at the diff to check.

btw, for those not familiar with TeX, Knuth's work on tex, mf, etc
has pretty much stopped. some regret this..others agree. at any rate
the changes in tex usage nowdays are in the various macro packages,
e.g. the forthcoming LaTeX macro package or in misc TeX related 
programming, e.g., programming in METAFONT (my interest). none of 
this has anything to do with Linux, other than that Linux is the 
best system for such work (yes, pure prejudice on my part).
 the tex binaries are not linked with the latest c or X libs: there is
not reason to, imho and while i link my own with the X 2.0 libs say, i
just do that because that's what i use now..eventually i'll update the
mf binary but there's no reason to now.

Hello Linuxers,

>          Plat Home Company of Japan has kindly made a Japanese

We Japanese Linuxers have already translated most Linux FAQ and
HOWTOs into Japanese as our main work of JF(Japanese FAQ) project,
whose chief is Mr. Tetsu Ono(ono@eiehost.gee.kyoto-u.ac.jp).
These documents will be found as well as others in,

       ftp.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp     130.54.20.1      /Linux/JF

Also, JE, Japanese Extention for SLS is available, which includes
various Japanese softwares under Linux. This binary kit must be 
useful for Slackware and Yggdrasil usres as well. New installer
of JE called `ezinst' in disk JE1 is independent of SLS. Japanese 
installation guide for SLS and JE is available at the following JE 
ftp sites and others.

       colias.tutics.tuc.ac.jp    133.15.144.11    /pub/linux/JE
       ftp.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp     130.54.20.1      /Linux/JE
       ftp.cs.keio.ac.jp          131.113.35.20    /pub/os/linux/Japanese/JE

For more information about Japanese Linuxing, read 
`JMETA_FAQ`( Japanese edition of META-FAQ ) and `Jouhou-memo' and
( Japanese translation of INFO-SHEET with lots of additional info ),
which are regularly posted in fj.os.linux news group and available in 
JF sites.

If you don't read Japanese documents, but are interested in Japanese
softwares, read README in JE which is written in English and/or drop 
me an e-mail.

We will welcome any inquiry about Japanese Linuxing!

Have fun,

Linux is sold to the inexperienced and the unconnected. Like it or
not, there's nothing you or I can do to stop that. If we can prevent a
few crash-and-burns, I think we should. Then, with time, these may

I've seen all these things, and I agree. Linux is not a shrink-wrapped
operating system, and should not be advertised as such. There's not
much we can do about the advertising. We are trying to do something
about the quality. As many pitfalls as there are, the distributions
shouldn't contain (or should contain as few as possible) pits of their
own.

   I don't want to think what would happen today...  Basically, Linux has
   to become more stable (as in changes, not crashability) before it can
   be tailored for the mass market.

The Consortium will not market Linux. Other people are doing that, and
will do it - Consortium or no Consortium. The LC is more of a
restriction. A brake. A filter.

   How can you approve something if you don't fully test it?

The testers will go through the installation procedure, check
permissions, key bindings, man pages and obvious stuff like that. It's
not a complete test, but it should spot the largest pits.

If the Consortium works they may at least buy the best CD because it's

Check out Oleo v1.5 from the GNU project. It runs in X or ASCII mode and is
quite nice. It has Emacs key bindings so it is easy to get going. Compiles out
of the box. It can be found at prep.ai.mit.edu:pub/gnu/oleo-1.5.tar.gz (I

XF86_Mach32 driver from XFree2.0.  The problem is that it refuses to use
more then 1024k of memory, so I can't go above 1024x768.  It won't
recognize the rest, and if I set 'videoram 2048', it dies saying that
the max for videoram is 1024.  The thing is that the XF86_SVGA driver
recognizes the 2048, without any problems, and lets me do higher
resolutions.  Has anyone come across this problem before (and know how to
fix it)?
