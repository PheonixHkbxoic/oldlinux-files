I hope this attempt works better than the last. My vi session hung and
apparently tin went ahead and shipped and unedited response.

        You probably don't need to partition the disk hence not
        fdisk. But you do need to make a filesystem so use mke2fs

        Your floppy should be called something like:

                /dev/fd0H1440

                where 0 is a: and H1440 indicates a 1.44 MB drive

        For mounting, you should put the -type BEFORE the special device,
        and the type should be ext, if event that is required, i.e.:

                mount -t ext /dev/fd0H1440 ./floppy
                

:   3. Do you know if we can allow theese 2 operations,

:      Although I do not want to allow someone doing

        Though, I have been doing Unix for years...., I am new to Linux.
        Some OSs won't allow what I am about to suggest and C program
        would have to be written. On linux, I'm not sure. 

        Just write a shell script that directly does the mk2fs & mount
        of ONLY the floppy. Do not make that an argument. Then, give the
        script root ownership with setuid pivilages and no write access
        except to root. The commands to do this could be:

                chown root <filename>
                chmod 4755 <filename>

        There would also have to be a script to umount the floppy.

Subject: Q: #include <standard.h> Anyone maintaining a list of uptodate includes?
Date: 21 Sep 1993 12:45:16 -0400

Has any one kept or prepared a list of up-to-date include files?

I started with the SLS distribution, 1.02, and munged a bunch of other
sources together, to get cought up to date.  While many packages
compile out of the box, a good number of the won't.

I've seen reports where emacs & oleo compile right out of the box.
This just aint so for me.  I suspect that some of my include files may
be out of date.  By glancing at the dates of the files, I can see that
they haven't be touched for a specific date, and therefore have no
idea which may be the culprit.

In MHO it would be nice whomever releases say, the next pl kernel
release, or general distribution would touch the sourses with a
specific date.

Hello again.
        Some people helped me a bunch. yes, the NET2HOWTO does not
include nearly enough info for setting up dip and slip. *sigh*.
Okay. so I got dip to work. even if I have to do some vodoo stuff with it.
(namely run my dip script. quit it since it hangs before dialing, run
minicom. type an atz to modem. quit it. run an older version of dip with
-t switch. dial modem. wait till ring. hang up. exit. run original 
script. No Problem. it works every time. B*b ) *double sigh*
Okay so it connect to my slip server. dip exits. ifconfig is set
pretty much right. I do the route del and add default gw 's as per
several people's instruction. 
        Now then.
        I type ping <machine name from my hosts file>
I get nothing. when I control-c it, it says 100% loss. telnet doesn't work
(except to myself. then it doesn't touch the modem). When I do the 
ping, I can see that i'm sending out pulses of info, and streams of
stuff is comming back but my machine doesn't hear it. I've set up
ncsa's telnet on my dos partition a while back. this reminds me of
when I didn't have my ip number right and telnet didn't know that
the incoming packets were for it. So anyway, me and a friend just spent a
total of about 10 hours in two days hacking at this <expletive deleted>.
So needless to say I'm not in a great mood. we turned on tons of
debugging stuff to see the inet signals fly (BTW whos the wiseguy who
had such great lines as:
#undef DEBUG
#ifdef DEBUG
....
Wouldn't it be better to stick 'em in one place? naahhh....to logical.)
Sorry to insult anyone. just a little miffed. After finally figuring out
where the #undef's were, we recompiled the kernal and DISCOVERED THAT



my machine didn't hear the incoming signals at all. BIGHELP! oh, well.
So now I'm turning to proffesional help. I'd really like to get this to
work. I've tried setting both compressed and uncompressed slip and
have run out of ideas for ways to try fixing this. Here is a list of
the output of syslogk. (I've commented it with <>'s ) I really hope
someone can help me. Please?

As up to date as most, _if_ you get the up to date one. No one seems to be
mirroring it :( You're right on most of the main sites it's still PL4!

The current one is PL12 - look on net.tamu.edu (horribly slow from the uk, at
least, so I think it's probably best not to look during peak hours). I
borrowed the boot disk for my own nefarious purposes :)

Nope, it's not a new idea.. :) In fact, someone else is selling Linux
t-shirts.. I ordered one a couple weeks ago, but haven't got it yet.
I also misplaced the email address of the seller, as did another
t-shirt buyer who also hasn't yet received anything.. I'll let you know
if we ever get our shirts, or find out who the guy selling them is. :)

You ought to check out procps:

sunsite.unc.edu
/pub/Linux/system/Misc/ps/procps-0.8.tar.gz

It contains a complete set of ps utils, that use the proc filesystem.

Including (source & man pages):

You're not using linux 0.99 pl13, but probably one of the previous alpha
releases.

This is the real 0.99pl13 kernel, running since  I get it compiled, as 
soon as available (here in France...):

/home/rene $ uptime
  9:42pm  up 1 day, 20:30,  3 users,  load average: 0.08, 0.26, 0.23

No problem at all.

Are there any experienced Linux users out there with an EISA Linux machine and
a 3c579?  Please respond to me via email.  The changes to the 3c509 driver
should be trivial, but I need someone that can test them.

Before anyone flames Russ (again), I would like to the attest that he has been
invaluable assistance both directly by doing source code reviews, loaning an
SMC ethercard to the Linux effort, etc. and indirectly by providing the GPLed
Crynwr source code as an example.

Wow!  I never figured so many people would be interested in M-Script... =)

Many of you said you'd be interested in a peek at the programmer's
reference, so I put it up for anonymous FTP.  Get it from
suncad.camosun.bc.ca in the /pub/morley directory.  Grab either
mscript.ps.z (compressed) or mscript.ps (non-compressed).  This is a
postscript file, so if you don't have a postscript printer don't bother.
It's only 24 pages long so far, so it's no big deal.

This is just a snapshot of the manual as it was this morning.  It's
already changed a bit.  There are many commands that aren't included yet,
and several of the ones that are need more details added.  It's quite
rough, but at least it should give you a better idea of what M-Script can
do (and whet your appetite a bit ;-)

Appendix A is actually the M-Script source code for an FTP client program
(the same one you see when you log into buckyball.camosun.bc.ca as 'ftpdemo')

Please look it over and let me know what you think.

PS: Apparently there is another software product with the same name, so I will
    likely be changing the name of mine soon.
