How long did it take Microsoft to address the functionality provided
by Unix-like system? And, better yet can it compare in terms of 
of resource utilization to Unix like systems?

Look now days you can buy a 486 with 64k cache. I don't think
that *BSD systems are attempting to be ultra minimalistic systems.
And, I don't think that anyone is going to bring out and dust off
the earlier versions of Unix which ran in 64k of memory in a PDP-11.

To take it to another extreme, last nite playing around with postgres,
an object-oriented databse, I was amazed at the size for just the
postgres binary, 11MB. Of course, the postgres installation included
other binaries. I wonder how a dos like system would handle such
a program. Oh, I know that it can be done.

If you are selling the package you need to provide a coupon or clear offer
for the source code supplied at media (might be + handling) cost or provide
the source code. WHen you are not selling it you have some slightly wider
options.

Oh, I agree about this.

No, the original poster was talking about people reinterpreting the GPL
when it suits them, and that's what I was responding to.  Sorry I didn't
make that clear.

What Peter has done is great stuff, but he can't retroactively restrict
redistribution when his code tells you to freely redistribute it.  The
ongoing discussions about this make it appear that he's reinterpreting
the GPL to suit his wants/needs when he objects to the Slackware
distribution and insists that the authors of that write their own
installation script.

Maybe the right thing to do is to call it "Slackware SLS".  :-)

Not only that, but it'll allow you to do real work (word processing aside).

I agree that many make a living with it, but I don't agree that Windoze
itself is a product that, through Microsoft, responds to customer demands.
Rather, other software vendors respond to customer demands by selling
software for it.

>For

That's right.  But the primary reason the PC has come such a long way is
that it is the only computer for which there are multiple manufacturers
competing with each other for the same basic hardware platform.  That's
why the prices are so low and *that's* why the PC is so popular.

>Even so window is a take out of 
>the box system, it was the intent of the designers, and it works.  

It installs, it works.  So does Linux.  But Windoze doesn't work *well*.
It's slow.  It crashes.  It wastes resources.

Linux works well.  It's fast.  It makes the most of the resources available.
It's damn near bulletproof.

Given the choice between the two, I'll use Linux except in cases where I
have to do something that *can't* be done on Linux but can be done under
Windoze, e.g. WYSIWYG word processing.

Linux and BSDI prove that Unix needn't be difficult to install.

Could you describe what you do under Windoze and what you do under Linux?
It would provide an interesting example of the uses of each.

Well, obviously testers aren't very useful if they're not acting as testers.
:-)

Admittedly, it's probably better to receive bug reports like "my mouse
doesn't work" than to receive none at all.  But technical competence
doesn't imply that bugs go unreported.  That *can* happen, yes, but I
think the Linux crowd is large enough that this isn't much of a concern.

Date: 23 Aug 1993 19:47:35 GMT

We are trying to evaluate how suitable linux would be for a data
acquisition application that we support. If anyone could answer some
of these questions it would help:

Are there available linux drivers to support:

   Digiboard PC/8i Serial Card

   National Instruments PC-AT IEEE-488 board

   Bi-directional centronix ports

Does linux accept other drivers written to any particular standard,
say System V Release 4?

Are high resolution alarms (0.01 second resolution) available?

Is the time of day available with 0.01 second resolution? Usually clock
ticks since boot is good enough, if HZ >= 100.

We know about f2c, but is G77 suppose to be a gnu FORTRAN compiler? Is there
any idea about when this might be available?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. You can reply directly to

I wish you'd stop wasting net.bandwidth on this small piece of
uselessness.

Or, if you are going to keep going, stop listing 'drag and drop' as an
OS feature.  There is no kernel in the world that directly supports
'drag and drop'.  'drag and drop' is some clueless piece of marketing
that people that decided actually correlates with quality when really
it has little to do with anything.

Comparing NT with Linux is like comparing a Chrysler Minivan with a
Porshe 928...totally apples and oranges.  I can't think of any reason
why anyone who is pre-disposed to like NT would want to try Linux.

And, I can't think of why anyone who likes to hack Linux kernels would
have anything more than a morbid interest in running Word for Windoze
or any of that other dreck.

So just stop it!  Into the kill file it goes...

That's all.

tar cfz foo.tgz a b c d e f g ...

where a b c d e f g ... are the files that are in package foo.  The
shell script known as sysinstall is 328 lines.  It would be easy to
write one that just extracted packages from a disk.  However, it would
be harder to come up with a complete install package that you could
install from scratch with.

I would imagine that someone could come up with an SLS replacement.  I
think that the first version would take about a day to hack together.
However, it would likely take several months before it is as stable
and robust as the SLS scripts are.  I'm sure that the slackware folks
could easily come up with something that isn't the SLS scripts, but
works well enough to begin distributions again.

Maybe it is time to resurrect the idea of having the SYS V package
format for Linux. 1/2 :-)

First question.  I run SLS 0.,99pl9 with 8MB real, 16 virtual.  After
getting about 20 login processes, I get an error message "No more
processes". Is there a tunable in the kernel that will allow more
space for processes, or am I stuck with only being able to have about 
10- 15 usable simultaneous login sessions.  Has this been fixed since
pl9? Also telnetd runs out of ptys after ttypf is used.  Is there
support for more ptys in the kernel or telnetd?  How difficult would
it be to add support like that?

Second question (easier):  Has anyone ported GNU finger to Linux?
If so, where can I find it, if not, is anyone working on it?

A couple (2-3?) of years ago Bill Gates said there are 160 programmers

Does anybody know when IBM started the OS/2 project? In 1985? Their
