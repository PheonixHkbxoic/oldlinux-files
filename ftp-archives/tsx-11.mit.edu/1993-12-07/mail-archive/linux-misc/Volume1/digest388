   From what should people take the motivation to create packages
   for free, if there are people who recommend only such packages,
   that are nearly perfect in installation, documentation and everything, 
   that they offer their free time for many people any further.

You still don't get it. We would only recommend such packages for
being sold with the implied suitability for the inexperienced. I'll
give you all the details:

Person D1, a developer, develops a program. It's not a perfect
program, but it's useful. There's not any documentation, because D1
didn't have time to make any. However, he releases the program on the
net, to the Linux Community. Some people flame him for not making any
documentation, but D1 doesn't care much. Neither do I.

Person D2, a distributor, starts selling D1's program on a CD-ROM. He
advertises it in Unix Worlds with "It's the greatest thing since air,
it will make you happy!". A buyer, B1, buys the package, and can't use
it because there is no documentation. He doesn't have net access, so
he can't ask the developer, D1. He's also pretty inexperienced, so he
can't find out how to use the program by reading the source. He's just
pissed off - and so am I - the CD is 'approved' or gets a good review
in our paper - or whatever.

Person D2 is another developer. He does document his software.
(Everyone flames him anyway.) D2 releases his program on the net. D3,
another distributor, sells D2's program on a CD-ROM - including the
documentation. The CD-ROM is approved or gets a good review.

Then, D3 uses the money he made on his previous CD-ROM to pay D1 to
document his program. Now, D3 can distribute that program as well - with
documentation - it's approved as well!

Do you get it? Developers don't have a responsibility. They don't have
to document. They don't get paid for their sweat. Distributors get
money - real money - for the distributions they sell. They are
responsible for the quality of their product. The worst case here is
when the quality of a program decreases between the developer and the
end user. The distributor doesn't include documentation or external
software that the developer included.

I want a group that can tell that developer that he won't be approved
(or get good a review) unless he includes that documentation, that
external program.

Can you tell I'm in a bad mood today?

which of these manuals is in "alpha" stage, and which are "completed"?
also, do you know what, if any, timetables there are on new releases
of the manuals?

Not this stupid thread again.  I know it's absolutely unusual to read FAQs,
but you might *consider* doing so....

Linux, for all you folks who "know better than to read stupid FAQs" <sarcasm
off> dynamically reallocates free memory to the buffer cache *and* *back*
*again* as needed.  If you have almost nothing running on your system, most of
your memory will go into the buffer cache; when you start a program that needs
memory, the cache will shrink to provide the memory.

The linux kernel (as of pl11 or so) has a struct for 8 swap devices.  
Every time you enable swapping to a device it goes in the first free space.  
Swapping fills up the first device in the struct, then goes onto the 
second etc.  If you make a swapfile on floppy disk and enable it first, 
initial swapping will go to floppy!  

I have written patches to the kernel to calculate delay for each swap
device based on recent performance, and swap to the quickest device.
I'll post the patches when I have adapted them to pl14, or maybe
send them to Linus.

Subject: Second IDE drive problems
Date: Tue, 7 Dec 1993 14:05:00 GMT

I have recently become the 'proud' owner of a removable IDE drive which is 
a CAVIAR AC2340, this disk has been fitted and I now have linux installed on
the whole drive (300M) with a 26M swap partition, the original internal IDE
drive has a small (32M) dos C partition and I would like to set-up the rest
of the original drive as a D partition (90M which is how it was configured
prior to my installing linux).
Since the new removable was installed I cannot run dos fdisk to create a new
partition on the original drive nor can I boot the system with the removable
removed and also the disk activity lights seem to mis-behave, this seems to me
possibly something to do with incorrect jumpering, is anyone else using a 
similar setup who can give me some advise.

Thanks Nick

It's about time that I updated the old ``LDP Manifesto'' to get this
information out. The I&GS is ``complete'', in that everything is
there, but as with anything is going through a constant revision
process. The SAG, NAG, and KHG are available in various stages of
development. The User's Guide is the only one lagging behind (nudge
nudge, wink wink) but I would hope to see something within a couple of months.

Writing books is a very slow process, because it's such a large task.
When writing the I&GS (around 150 pages now) I spent 25% of my time
writing new material and 75% of the time rewriting old. In fact, the
last couple of chapters are extremely terse because they didn't go
through that extensive rewrite process (yet)--- I wrote them both in a
weekend.

I'm in the process of `rewriting' the I&GS, and the next release (real
soon now) will include information on getting and installing "any"
release of Linux---that is, it won't be SLS-specific. However, the
more general you get, the less specific you get. Therefore, the next
version of the book will rely on the various distributors
having a set of complete instructions for installing just that
release. I know that not all Linux distributions have this, for
instance, SLS's "installation instructions" are limited to a set of
cursory README files that expect the reader to know what's going on.
What I may attempt to do is produce an "Installation HOWTO" for each
major Linux distribution (at least, the ones available via
FTP---CD-ROM and mail-order distribution usually come with fairly
complete instructions) and provide that as a supplement for the I&GS.
So, in order to install Slackware, you'd grab the I&GS and the
"Slackware Installation Supplement" that provided Slackware-specific
stuff and expected that you'd read it along with the I&GS. 

The problem is, I don't have the resources or time to download and
install each of these Linux distributions to see first-hand what it's
like. What I would like to do is gather a small group of
volunteers---say, one or two for each distribution---to help me write
these documents. The docs will be short and simple, more or less
step-by-step instructions on how to install the software, with the
background ideas being relegated to a document like the I&GS.

If you've installed a release of Linux (recently, and other than
SLS), and would like to help me write an "Installation HOWTO" for that
particular release, please mail me. Essentially each document will be
a modification of the current Installation-HOWTO for that release, and
shouldn't be very hard to put together. Maintaining such a document is
a different matter. I'm hoping that the individual distribution
coordinators would be able to maintain these documents after they're
written.

You can interface Linux with Netware, but you must use the NFS services
that Netware supports.  I believe there is a hefty extra charge for
the NFS services software, btw.  Contact Novell to be certain.  I know
that I had a large Novell network with Linux workstations as some of the
clients.  (As well as MS-DOG, Macinsloth, and Ultrucks boxes. :^)  There
is a shareware (?) product out called "charon" and "pegasus" that allows
Netware to act as a mail/print server, but it doesn't help Netware
provide file services.  I haven't actually used it, so I can't give you
any more details than that.  Sorry.

 You definitely do *NOT* need any stuff on the boot disk that has to do with
login, user account management and security things. After all, if you're 
booting from a floppy, you are at the console and can personally defend your
computer against intruders.   
 The stuff concerned is getty, login, /etc/passwd, /etc/group, /etc/shadow
I guess you can save some 50 K by leaving these things out.

Is there a bootdisk/rootdisk distribution containing a recent (and
