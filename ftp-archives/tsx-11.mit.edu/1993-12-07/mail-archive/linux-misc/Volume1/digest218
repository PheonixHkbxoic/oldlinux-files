   I looked again at the sources, made the following changes and it compiled
successfully. I am now up and running without problems using X and running
a packet radio link with WAMPES over the last 2 days.
    kernel/module.c      removed    "C" from all lines where it appeared.
                                    ---
    proc/array.c          same as for module.c

kernel/ksyms.lst      remove all the bits including uppercase like __FUiPC
so that now we have lines as follows
_memmove
_memset
_register_chrdev
_unregister_chrdev
_verify_area
_wake_up_uninterruptible

*** ONE PROBLEM remains .... the ftape-0.9.6 driver.o fails to make, I
know nothing about C++, so I may have to have a harder look to see what
the problems are, when compiled with C++ it all makes, but complains of
undefined symbols at run time.(failure to make under standard C compiler).

Perhaps the guy who made the ftape-0.9.6-boot.gz would put his sources up

It really depends on the nature of the question.  If someone's system
is down, and they are asking for help (maybe by posting from another
system) in re-installing, recovering a corrupt filesystem, or whatever,
you can't reasonably expect them to be able to keep up-to-date on any
newsgroups!  This kind of "emergency" problem-solving is best done
by Email reply!

But if they are asking "how do I compile Fancy-Draw 3.7?", then that's
something that could be covered in a news posting.  But then again, maybe
there aren't very many people even *interested* in Fancy-Draw 3.7!!!  :-)

Hi all.  I've been trying to run acm 3.1 on my linux machine.
It compiles fine, and I can start up the server.  However, 
as soon as a client connects to the server, the server dies
with a floating point exception.  Does anyone have any

Well, my Linux machine is on the Internet, connect 24hrs/day by
ethernet. For what should be fairly obvious reasons, I'd rather not
post the hostname to comp.os.linux{.misc}.

It's been fairly solid for me, and now that the campus network is
being cleaned up and broken into subnets, things are working great. (I
was having a problem with routing before the subnet routing was fully
in place.)

I've been using it to test gn, a gopher/http server which works great
under Linux. I've also been able to use Xmosaic, xgopher, and a slew
of other X-based network applications. I regularly run emacs on osiris
(one of the school's Sun boxes running Solaris) with the DISPLAY set
to my machine. Works like a charm.

I use the diskbackup program from tsx-11.mit.edu in /pub/linux/sources/usr.bin/

It's a nice program and I did quite a few backups with it over the last few

I would like to seriously propose the entire thing be done in HTML markup

WWW documents is NCSA Mosaic, which is available for Linux.  
For those not already familiar with HTML, it is a multimedia hypertext

  I sat down for a week some time about a month ago, and tried my hand
at hacking up this problem.  I did the same thing just described above.
Then, I hacked it up a little more:
  Those little "bits" are actually assembly arguement descriptors.  I
noticed that the ksyms.lst file gets turned into an assembly-lang file
that basically sets up a symbol table, with string reference indices.
So, I instead of changing ksyms.lst, I changed ksyms.s.  The ksyms.s file
has two parts: that actual symbol table, and a reference string.  I changed
the first part, deleting the arguement descriptors, and leaving the
arguement descriptors.  Now, the reason I made the change here is because
if you make it in ksyms.lst, both parts of ksyms.s get changed.
  This hack seemed to work.  The modules package passed its self test
program perfectly, and the ftape software compiled cleanly.  But here comes
the catch:  It didn't work right.  It seemed I was able to control the tape
drive fine, but the read/write routines weren't working.  I tried writing
data to the tape with dd and tar, and upon reading, both tests failed.
Tar complained about not being able to find a tar header, and quit.
DD, being a bit more low-level, actually gave me something, but it too
quit with with an error.  What DD gave me looked suspiciously like what
a freshly formatted tape might look like, and I was using a fresh formatted
tape.  
  In my next test, I used the program that comes with ftape, userft.
When this program ran, it opened with:
status = 0x65      (I believe (from memory) that this is Beginning of Tape)
error = 0x1f,  command = 0x1b
configuration = 0xd0
rom version = 0x40
vendor id = 0x47

  I looked through the source for userft, and I believe that the error
number corresponds to "Rate Selection Error".  Bummer.

  That was the end of my experiments - I just copied the above from
my log book.  I had other things to play with and hack up.... :)
  I read recently that someone had suggested removing all C++-isms
from the source.  I have yet to try that, so I don't know if that works.

 Indeed.  If anyone knows a sure-fire method for getting ftape-0.9.6
working under .99pl13, I would love to hear it.

To post or to mail really depends on whether there is general
interest in what you've got to say.

I love seeing answers posted for unique problems. I read them
and file away ones that I may need in the future. Because of this
I'm able to solve many problems on my own as they crop up.

But I dislike seeing the same old answers posted 10 times for questions
that are posted at least once a week. Especially if they are simple
questions that probably could have been answered by means other than
the net.

I answer a lot of questions by mail. I probably get 20% of them
bouced back due to incorrect reply-to addresses. I don't make
any effort to re-send those. I really don't like when the *only* way
to answer someone is to post.

And as Ian mentioned, saying "mail me since I don't have time to read
this group" is downright insulting to all of us who are trying to
be helpful.

A far more valuable service would be to set up an anonymous NFS site with some
popular network-loadable distribution, like slackware or SLS.

It's actually easier to do safely than setting up an anonymous FTP.  Just set
your machine up to read-only export the directory with the distribution to any
machine (read the 'exports' manual page in section 5).

Several Internet sites already have announced anonymous NFS service, and
number of others have unannounced anonymous Linux NFS distributions.
Unfortunately, I can't find a site that will _announce_ that they have Linux
under anonymous NFS.

I am having a problem of dip accessing my modem.  I know I am using

manually and try the term command, it displays exactly the first character
that I type and no more.  I can exit term mode and then try to exit
dip, but at that point it hangs and leaves the port in the hung mode.
(i.e.  If I use kermit to access the port after that, I get the same
thing as in term mode of dip.  I know the modem works because I am using
it now to write this message.  While in dip, if I try to send a init
string or try to dial, I get no flicker of the lights on the modem.
I really need to get SLIP running for a project at work.  Any help
