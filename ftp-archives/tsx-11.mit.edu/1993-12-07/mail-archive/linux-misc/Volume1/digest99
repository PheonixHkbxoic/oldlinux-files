I don't answer questions in the newsgroup unless
 (a) I think a the problem is likely to be a common, and
 (b) I am confident that I have an authoritative answer.

This isn't often the case.  However I do quite often try to send
helpful comments by email.  A look in my mail directory shows that
since April there were somewhere in the region of 80-100 people to
whom I've sent what I hoped was an answer or a useful suggestion.

Of course I have to see an article to be able to reply to it or follow
up.  There have probably been quite a few people whose questions I
might have answered if they'd used a better subject line.

Also, you obviously you haven't been reading the groups carefully
enough to be able to make such a comment.  A look in my news archive
shows that I've made about 10 postings to comp.os.linux.* since the
split.

If you have some disagreement with what I'm posting I'm perfectly
happy to discuss it with you; howeve I don't think that this kind of
public flaming is going to do anyone any good.  You'll find that if
you send me email I'm actually quite approachable and will try to take
your comments on board, or answer them if I feel I can't do so.  In
fact, I even invite comments at the bottom of the dailies ...

Finally, if anyone has a question (even a FAQ) that they send to me by
email I will endeavour to answer it.  The point of the dailies is not
to fend of email but to try to reduce the amount of crap that gets
posted.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix.
The FAQ for this group is available on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

I don't know if this question has been asked yet, but I haven't seen it.

Will PCI bus machines run linux? Is is see-thru like VESA local bus?
I suspect not. If it's not going to run as is, are there any immediate

On the other hand, look at the SLS installer. Though not really a GUI,
it is very easy to handle - I can't imagine how its user-friendlyness
could significantly be improved further (perhaps the output format
needs a bit of streamlining, one could imagine an SAA-like format, but
that's details. It definitely needs no graphics). You can boot a
"minimum" system (which currently is more of a maximum :-), follow the
instructions and then just sit there and swap the disks.

What could be improved, is the adaption of the system to local needs.
This is IMHO the big advantage of the Windoze installer - you can
select every piece of hardware from lists. Installing X on Linux needs
careful editing of a config file and much RTFMing...

But a point-and-shoot style selector could be written for Un*x too, no
doubt. (And I always hear people praise the ease of the SLS
installation process vs. other Un*x variants - they have to edit tons
of config files anyway...)

The problem here is most likely the modem setup. Your modem comes up with
parameters that were most likely to work in 1981. Well, times have changed
but compatability with the stoneage is a good thing, isn't it?

So, tell your modem to raise thee CD (Carrier Detect) line only if there is
a connection. That is easyly done with the command "AT&C1".

You can do that every time you start Seyon by editing the appropriate thing.
Sorry, but I forgot what it was. Read the Seyon doc.

If that has been a problem for you, be advised that there are some more
difficulties in store for you. There is that bit about fixing the DTE speed
to something like 19200 baud (or higher). Do you want compression with MNP4?
And on and on and on.

This is NOT a Linux question. There are better newsgroups for that kind of 
thing. I am using Seyon from the beginning, It is *flawless*. Most likely
any problems you will encounter are modem questions. Those suckers are not
easy to setup right, even pros do sometimes fail. Try to get local help. The
guy does not even need to know Linux/Unix to be able to help you out.

Hope you can dial now ;-)

Subject: [HELP] AHA 1540B + TEAC CD-50
Date: Mon,  6 Sep 1993 10:49:39 -0400

Do anyone have the successful case with this configuration, in
Linux/Dos? I setup the SCSI id to be 2, and the terminator is installed
at both end (one is Adaptec 1540B, another is Teac CD-50 CDROM-driver,
and it's the only SCSI driver I have now)
 
Both dos and linux can recognize the CDROM driver at properly ID and
CUN(0), but I just can't find the data of the CD-ROM. I use the
ASP4DOS.sys from adaptec and Corel SCSI driver on the DOS part, and it
works fine before I tried to use it. I even can't reject the disc by
using the reject buttom.
 
Since I am new to both sides: SCSI card and CDROM, I wonder is it the
problem of driver(CDROM), or the problem of Adaptec 1540B?
 
Any help is appreciated

   Which is perfectly fine for the person who has a networked office and
will be sharing CPU, disk, and printer resources - but this doesn't
apply to the majority of people who use computers.  They need a
single-tasking program loader, and that's what they get from DOS.  I think
that we're arguing at cross-purposes here; I'm in full agreement that DOS
rots for any network, large-app, or multi-process work.  But working as
a consultant/programmer for small businesses ( And by small I mean > 10
people, which constitutes by far the MAJORITY of businesses in the U.S. )
there typically isn't a need.  ( Better watch out - I may start getting
into my other peeve about how companies tend to use computers as
problem generators rather than problem solvers. ;-)

   What makes UNIX inappropriate?

   1)  Rotten file-system integrity in harsh environments.  Ever try to
       run a computer in a factory that contains lots of high startup load
       machines without an expensive UPS?  It's not fun to have the machine
       crash before syncing.  And we're not talking about a cheap, $250.00
       in-line UPS - they can't cut it.

   2)  Expertise needed to set it up and use it effectively.  The business
       that pays its receptionist $7.50/hr is not likely to want to hire
       a $50.00/hour consultant to get lpd working correctly.  And they're
       not going to find out how to do it in any book that is easily
       accessible to a computer neophyte.  How many questions do you see
       flooding the .linux groups daily that are posted by people who
       *like* computers and solving problems?  What chance does an
       overworked, harried office manager have when he has to figure out
       what all those funny messages about .LCK files mean and the
       company will lose contracts if they can't get a new quote for a
       job printed out fast enough to meet a deadline.  Been there.
       Done that.  It sucked.


   I have *NEVER* seen a complete, turnkey OS fresh from the box that is more
appropriate for a neophyte/ignorant/scared user than MS-DOS.  Sure, when
needs expand, the company should dump DOS as fast as it can.  But until then,
it's fine for them.

   Yup - reminds me of the day when I converted all of my dBase II programs

   Again, if you have the money.  And the hardware resources.  In 1981,
who would have known that computers dedicated to *ONE PERSON* would have
been of interest to more than geeks?  And so they were designed with that
in mind.

   It certainly does.  Before PC's were commodities, computer components were
expensive as hell.  And it was a risk for *any* company to invest significant

   Well, that's your definition.  My definition is that technical excellence
means the lowliest, most computer-phobic person can do useful work without
a BS/CS degree.  Remember - programmers, system administrators, and
technicians are facilitators.  We exist to allow other people to do work
faster and more efficiently.  Often that means that we have to wallow
in the mud with poor tools, but that's irrelevent as long as the USER gets
what he needs.

   Which is all well and fine for programmers.  Users don't care about that -
nor should they, really.  They want solutions to problems.  We need to
provide them with solutions, no matter what it takes.  We have to put up with
rotten goods so they don't have to.
