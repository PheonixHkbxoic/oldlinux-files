Subject: Wordprocessor under X
Date: 19 Aug 1993 15:32:30 +0200

Does anyone have or know about a Wordprocessor for X (under Linux) with
capabilities like WordPerfect has (something which has graphical and layout
capabilities).

I know of the existence of Tex and the like, but I don't think they can be
somehow used for wordprocessing since it is more programming.

I've already heared  about InterViews, but it occupies something like 35 Mb
and it says it can't be compiled with g++ 1.39. So I guess it will not work
with gcc either. (correct me if I'm wrong).

Linux also supports SYSV IPC, including shared memory, seamphores,
and messages.

Theoretically, the Linux ext2fs supports terrabyte filesystems although the 
mkfs for it doesn't.

Linux uses a page table per process, with the kernel mapped into 
the same 1G space in every process's page table leaving only 3G for
the user process's use.

Total virtual memory is total swap + total physical memory, with
appropriate tweaking this is probably about 6G.

A few comments on this : 

While the original Linux vm used one systemwide page table, with 
64M allocated to the kernel and each of 63 processes, current versions
use one per process, meaning 3G is available to each process (since 1G
is used for the kernel in each page table).  Multiply this 3G
by the total number of proccesses you've configured in to get the 
size of all address spaces put together.

As far as the amount of virtual memory supported, this would be 
the total of physical memory and swap sizes. Currently, a maxmum of 
127 swap files can be supported (since 7 bits are used to represent
swap type, and one value is reserved for SYSV shared memory) by tweaking 
the MAX_SWAPFILES define.  A maximum swap device/file size of 16M is 
supported, meaning total swap is limited to just shy of 2G, allowing
for almost 6G of total virtual memory.

No.  Linux ignores the cylinder, head, sector entries in the partition
table and instead relies on the relative sectors and total sectors 
fields of an entry.  Since these are expressed as 32 bit unsigned 
quantities, you can have 4G sectors per partition, or 2 terrabytes.

Even if something in the kernel uses a signed int instead, partitions
can still be 1TB.

You'll do better running one after another (note, this assumes a recent
version of Linux, after the fully unified buffer cache was
incorporated.  Without the fully unified cache, if you don't
have enough room in the buffer cache to hold the entire
executable, when you go to run it again pages loaded later
in execution have pushed pages loaded early in execution out
of the cache meaning you have to reload them from disk, pushing
later pages out, meaning you end up loading the entire 
program.  With the fully unified cache, pages are considered 
part of a running program and the cache, meaning when the program
terminates you'll have a large set of its pages incore resulting
in less disk access.  So, without the new buffer cache you may have
been better off running multiple copies at once if there would
be less data than text since you'd only have to load the text
once).

If you run them at the same time, there will be more paging because
you have more data pages.  With more paging, you'll loose ground.

With one running, it will have a larger incore set of pages, resulting
in less slow paging.

But there are gazillions of non-GUI Un*x apps. Not all the world needs
mice and windows. And nothing prevents software developers from
writing decent GUIs for Un*x, of course.

Why not? It is just generic Un*x with the large number of usable apps
already available - I just see what I'm using every day: Mail, news
(worldwide connected of course); TeX, a very good C and C++
development system (no I simply don't *need* an integrated fullscreen
version, emacs is doing this job well)...

I just read the article about how linux users are #@##@. I have worked with ms window for now 3 years. I have worked with a guy name Robert Straus, that knows
windows upside down, the internals and guts. For my part I am content to just
be able to program some. My unix experience is the same. I am not a god in anything, or else what am I doing here. I whish some people would show some humility and realise that Linux is a non commercial product that allows people like me toplay arround with an os, without having to spend 1000 of dollars. On the other side ms window is a commercial product, with which many people make a daily leaving and for that reason, it is a product that responds to customer demands. For the pc to have come so far, in such a short time, must mean that the pc manufacturers are not totally stupid. Even so window is a take out of the box system, it was the intent of the designers, and it works.
Nt is a new technology, money is needed to develop it, and what gates does so well is marketing. unix is old, and has had a tendency to refrain itself from the easy to install package. unlike ms window, unix was intended for computer profesional, and that it does well. but do not forget that NT is for joe blow users, not people that have such a low self esteem that they like to think of themselves as gods.
Now linux is also a great piece, if not a giant piece of software. I love it, and I have both window and linux on my machine. I work with both every day, and both provide me with services than one alone could not.

Shouldn't you consider mmap()'d memory, too?  Executables/shlibs are 
loaded this way, but aren't paged to swap, and as soon as MAP_SHARED 
is done, it'll be writable store as well.

Also note that we have some bits left over in out swap entry.  Also,
max swapfile size could easily be made bigger, but since 16MB gives an
acceptably-sized (1 page) usage map, it was settled on.  A 32 MB swap
file would use 2 pages for usage, and is the next logical size.  If
we needed to, we could support a new magic for "large swap" and support
swapfiles up to XX MB.

That is not a very good answer.  If you already OWN the MS-"DOS" version,
then that is true.  If you do not, it is feasible to buy it.  The Unix
version of WordPerfect 5.1 supports text modes, pseudo graphics terminals, and
true Xwindows.  In addition, WordPerfect Corp has an extremely fair upgrade
policy.  If you already own an MS-"DOS" version of WP, you can upgrade for
a low price.  Any "DOS" emulation of WP will never be as fast, flexible,
reliable, secure, or efficient as the native Unix version.

It is my hope that full COFF for Linux will come out so I and others can take
advantage of such commercial software.

Scores of other popular MS-"DOS" software packages are also available for Unix.

However the mainstream market has certainly indicated that mice
'n windows is definitely where it wants to be.  The technical and
scientific communities are a separate issue, although even those
would prefer a graphical interface all other things being equal
(which they most certainly are not).

Then why don't they?

Nothing prevents you from walking on the moon either.  Something,
does indeed discourage either from occuring:  Lack of support.
Neither X nor Motif nor OpenLook provide a complete enough set of
tools to make writing polished apps a profitable exercise.

True, polished GUI apps exist under Windows, Windows NT, OS/2,
the Mac OS and NeXTSTEP.

Better solution. Run the DOS emulator DOSEMU and run WP under it. In console
mode it looks like the real thing. Plus if your machine is no the network
you can print on any network printer.

It's been tested with 5.0. Don't know about 5.1.

Windows 3.1 compatibility, then OS/2 will give it to you, and Linux won't
(at the moment).

However, OS/2 isn't a "svelte super-powerful OS", as you might like to think
it is, and Linux *does* have reams of usable applications.

All opinions are, of course, my own, and bear no relation whatsoever to
those of the company I work for.

How'd you get WP to run under dosemu? I tried it but it just sat there.  
I'm on a 486dx33/VLB w/ 8 mb ram. I tried it while running dosemu in raw  
keyboard mode, the console and graphics options, 8 mb expanded, and 1 meg  
extended memory. Btw, I'm using WP 5.1, so that might be the problem. 
Anyone else tried WP 5.1?
