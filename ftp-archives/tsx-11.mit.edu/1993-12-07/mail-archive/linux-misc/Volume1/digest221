It also works on Ultrix, whose vi claims to be version 3.7, 18-Oct-85,
and on A/UX, whose vi claims to be version 3.9, 2/9/83 (!).

The character needed is ASCII 036, which, logically, would be Ctrl-^
(or maybe Ctrl-~).  Ctrl-6 probably works because the keyboard realizes
that Ctrl-6 makes no sense, and so assumes you want Ctrl-^ (I'm assuming
your ^ is on your 6 key).

I was getting at the fact that if the text source was created using some
process that will also result in a format that is easily viewable by HTML
viewers such as Xmosaic then there will be many WWW users who will be happy.
I think that stuff like WWW & Mosaic are the way things are going...also
stuff like Lynx to view via tty.  Yes, postscript and dvi files would also
be very useful for paper output, but for electronic viewing Mosaic kicks.

        It depends upon how fast your system is.  Basically, if you've
got a 16550, your CPU is servicing fewer interrupts at any given
serial speed.  If you've got a 486DX2/66 then you may never notice
the difference.  If yuo've got a 386SX/16, on the other hand, it's a
godsend.  In any case, given that a 16550 serial card costs about $30,
I think it's well worth the investment for anyone getting a 14.4 modem.

        The main linux mailing list (linux-activists@niksula.hut.fi)
has multiple "channels" (really sub-lists).  There's around 2 dozen of
these channels, as I recall, NORMAL, NET, KERNEL, FSSTND.  FSSTND
is a bunch of folk writing a draft filesystem layout.  It's not finished
as yet, so you won't find it up for ftp.  If you're interested in helping
out, join the mailing list.

I am purchasing a new computer in the next couple of weeks.  So far I have
chosen a Zenon EISA/VESA.  I would like to get an UltraStor 34f (or if
money permits, a 24f).  There are several video cards that I am now
considering: (the system comes standard with a Diamond Viper)

     Orchid  Fahrenheit VA VLB 2MB     S3-805
             Celcius           2MB     IIT ACX015
     Diamond Stealth Pro VLB   2MB     S3-928
     Hercules Graphite VL Pro  2MB     IIT AGX014

I would also consider any other Card that would be compatible with Linux.

Please send any information to me at billy@bigdog.engr.arizona.edu.

I will compile a list of the responces I recieve and post them at a later
date.

Thanks for the help.

Date: 18 Oct 93 05:17:56 GMT

Well if you've been reading any of the linux newsgroups you are aware
of the raging debate going on about the quantity and types of questions
to the newsgroup comp.os.linux.development. I decided to start asking
folks who post questions on c.o.l.d and c.o.l.admin why they put their
questions there. I've done this simply by E-mailing a survey question
to the original poster and saving the replies. Maybe we can use this
info to make some intelligent decisions about how to manage questions
in the linux hierarchy.

Here is the summary so far. Anonymous of course. I have been indiscriminate 
of the type of question posted. Every new question that has been posted to 
c.o.l.d or c.o.l.admin I've send a survey to. This is about 5 days of 
summaries. I plan to continue my survey and post a cumulative summary
every week or so. All followups to this post should go to comp.os.linux.misc
so as not to stir up any more traffic in the other groups. I've set
the follow to c.o.l.m.

Please feel free to comment on the contents of this. I've asked the
respondents if they minded an anonymous summary and no one has objected
so far.

First the survey E-Mail:

It's no problem to me and no flame to you. I'm just trying to gather info
so that I can intelligently respond to folks when they ask me this 
question. There is a big debate going on in the linux newsgroups over this 
topic.

Also I wanted to know if you objected to an anonymous summary of your 
answer at some later time.

well before posting this message to *.admin I thought about where to
post it. I was not not sure if to post it to *.help or even to

Hi Byron,

I believe I can post for requesting help in c.o.l.d because
I have problem with gcc and profiling, and I need profiling
to do development under linux.

Do you understand the term development only kernel hacking or those
who attempt to do that or who already contributed a lot
to LINUX, e.g. Linus T. ?

The compiler is one of the central part of an OS, maybe my request
points out a general problem, a feature leak and so it is of common 
interest. Due to this it is not only a help request !
Just remember it went fine with gcc 2.3.3.

Hope, You means the same thing as I do, with profiling I surely
do not mean .profile for bash (actually in discussed in c.o.l.help)
but execution profile of a program at runtime, how often a function 
was called and how much time it consumed.

Because you ask me to post to c.o.l.help and in the context 
of the actual discusion on c.o.l.d (see "Questions are permitted on c.o.l.d")
I feel very confused, sad and a bit ill about that what is going on
and due to this you receive this flame like reply.

BTW, I am the one of many who voted for the c.o.l.* and 
believe to know where questions should be posted to.
Before my posting I already investigate lots of time to find
out what are missing, I compliled gcc my self and check every
files to find out if I could generate the needed files myself.

Hope, You will be aware by judging what should belong to c.o.l.d
and what not.

Sory, You will receive this email with a bit delay. My own 
private host is connected via uucp, I use to call out only 
once a day for emails and news.

If you can, your help will be greatly appreciated.

Because, at least to me, this seems like an ADMIN type problem.  The Help
group would seem to be one where people would ask "how does 'ls' work" or
what file do I edit when I want aliases to be recognized upon login?
Aren't questions about administration type problems supposed to be asked
in an admin group?

I don't believe that you will be able to gear all the questions that people
will ask to a certain news group just by posting "post only discussion about
X here" because possibly people, like me, may not read these messages due
to time/work whatever.

BTW: Should ALL linux questions go to linux.help?  This seems rather 
unreasonable.

> [ Survey Deleted ] 
No problem.  The reason for this post in c.o.l.d was basically because of
topic.  This particular group was created for communication on system
development issues (kernel, file systems, device drivers, difficult porting,
etc).  Since this question concerned the development of a particular fs
support, I posted it here.  Simple enough? :)

AS to the c.o.l.h vs c.o.l.h... c.o.l.h is for general help, ie, 'how do I
get such and such a program to work?', 'why am I getting this error?',
'how can I make this compile', etc, etc.   Any issue that relates to
LINUX DEVELOPMENT belongs in here (c.o.linux.development :).  There are in
fact some questions that may fit into both groups, as they have a fine
overlap area.  Unlike c.o.l.a there was no condition stating that no
questions of any sort would be allowed in c.o.l.d when we voted/split.  It
is my personal opinion that questions definately contribute to the
developmental process, so long as they are appropriate.  

As to the occasional 'off-topic' posts that end up in c.o.l.d.  I just
don't read them, or if I do, I respond via email.  There is no
reason to generate even more garbage in the group.  'off-topic' is not
defined (defining it in a weekly post of some sort would be a good idea),
and therefore opinions will vary. 

There will always be a stray post or two (or three, or four), especially
with new lnux users every day.  There is no reason to discourage these new
users with 'flames', or irk your fellow c.o.l.d reader with more off-topic
posting.  Simply moving off-topic discussion to other c.o.l or private
channels will maintain efficiency.
