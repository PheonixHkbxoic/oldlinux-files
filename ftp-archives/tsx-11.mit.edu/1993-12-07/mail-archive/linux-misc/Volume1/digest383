A 486sx does not have a math coprocessor (or built in math support), so
all floating point operations have to be emulated in the kernel.  If the 
Sparc does have hardware floating point support, this would account for
the difference.

If I understand correctly the problem, you want to run _clients_ on the
Linux box, using an Xterminal as server. To do this, there is no need to
start the Xserver on the Linux box.

X is based on a server-client model. The machine which _displays_ the
output is the server and the machine on which the programs are run is the
client. It may sound strange that an Xterminal is the server and a big
and powerful machine is the client, but this is how X works.

Pretty soon, I'm going to have to leave my Linux machine unattended
for a little while, which means that if it crashes I will be in trouble
since I won't be there to reboot or fix the problem.  The usage of
the machine is reasonably light (just me) and my major need while
I'm away will be file transfering via ftp, so stable networking is
crucial.  Can someone suggest a known stable kernel that I can use
for a short while?  Cheers,

I picked up the net-2 distribution from sunsite (or was it tsx-11? 8^)
and when I untarred the base package, it placed tons o' links in /etc
that refered to /conf/net stuff. Well, it seems that /conf/net was plain
empty! Where are the files that the links supposedly point to? Is it
possible that I'm forgetting a switch with tar? (I used xpvf from /)
I did create a /conf tree before untarring the files...

I just caught the tail end of a compressed read-only filesystem
discussion.  Does such a filesystem exist?  I looked for it on
sunsite and tsx-11, but didn't find anything.  Such a filesystem
would be a good deal for users who don't modify /bin.  

Of course, the zlib would be nice too, but I don't know if I want
to try it with the  alpha libraries I'm using now. :(

Subject: PAS16:scsi timed out
Date: 6 Dec 1993 13:49:21 -0500



Has anyone tried the ALPHA-pl13r kernel from nic.funet.fi with PAS16 soundcard 
and SCSI hard disk? 
When I tried to boot up with zImage (compiled from source ALPHA-pl13r
at nic.funet.fi, under directory /pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/pl13-ALPHA's,) 
it gave me a message "Patition check" and then hanged. 

Then, I turned off the option PEUDO_DMA in file linux/drivers/scsi/pas16.c
and recomiled it. This time, linux successfully reboot the system.

The next step, I did a fdisk to make two partition (each 200MB) 
on my scsi harddisk( seagate ST1480N 400MB). Linux did it happily. 
I reboot the system as instructed by fdisk, and tried to make a 
filesystem by using mke2fs.(I typed "mke2fs -c /dev/sda2 #blocks".) 

Now the wierd thing happened: 
after almost an hour, mke2fs finally finished and gave me following messages:

scsi host 0 timed out - aborting command. 
scsi host 0 abort() timed out -resetting
scsi disk error: host 0, id 0 , lun 0
scsi disk I/O error return code = 80000
dev 0802, sector 514    -----------------------
scsi host 0 timed out - aborting command      |
scsi disk error: host 0, id 0 , lun 0         |------> sector # difference is
scsi disk I/O error reutrn code = 30000       |    always 2.
dev 0802, sector 516    -----------------------

and the system hanged up. 

THen, I tried with different partition size with "mkfs",  and found out
that if the size is bigger than 17MB, I will get the same message  and
system hangs (except that sector # is different, but the difference between 
two sectors is always 2). But if I make a partition less than 17MB,
Linux can make a filesystem successfully by using "mkfs". 

By using mke2fs, and I can make  a filesystem with the size under 12MB. 
If the partition size is over 12 MB, I will get the same message and
system hangs. (I think these numbers--- 12MB, or 17MB ----depends on
CPU/ BIOS speed, not nesseary the magic number.) 

Also, if I reboot the system, and do a fsck -vf (or e2fsck -vf ) , I will
get following message:

the version msg. (junk)
Reading tables.
Inode bitmap for group 0 not in group (0)!e2fsck:descriptors corrupted
                                       ^
                                       |
                                sometimes is 1.



I think the problem is that the PAS-16 scsi disk driver does not give
enough time to let PAS-16 card to do its task, because I can make a 
"short"  partition but not a long one. 

I wonder 
      1) if anyone can tell me how to correct the problem.  
      2} if this is a  new problem, does any one can tell me how to change
         the time out algorithm for PAS-16 scsi disk driver.   
      3) what are the files related to the scsi disk driver for PAS-16?
         If the problem related to low-level part of the driver, or 
          medium part, or ???  

Any suggestions and ideas will be greatly appreciated.

P.S.: according to SCSI howto from tsx-11.mit.edu, the time-out can
caused by " IRQ, DMA, or address conflicts with other board."
However, my scsi disk works under msdos using trantor scsi-works. 
Also, I checked IRQ setting there is no obvious conflict. 

My system configuration is : 
        386sx40
        8Meg memory, (access speed 70ns)
        PAS16card  with seagate ST1480n harddisk. 
        seagate 40MB IDE harddisk (st351ax)
        and some other useless staff

This message was also "cross-posted" to several other groups including

From the NET-2-HOWTO:

        Next, unpack the net-base package, which contains the basic
        utils and configuration files in /etc. Note that net-base makes
        symlinks in /etc for all of your TCP/IP configuration files to /conf.

        Therefore, BE WARNED: Before you unpack the following tar files,
        make a backup of your files in /etc. Unpacking net-base will overwrite
        many of the files in /etc with symbolic links to other places.
        For example, /etc/hosts is a symlink to /conf/net/hosts. Why is this
        done? Because Fred's Linux/PRO distribution of Linux keeps all
        machine-specific configuration files in /conf. And because this is
        the way he does it, we may as well too. In general it makes things
        easier to locate. If you want to keep all of your net files in 
        /etc, that's fine, but you'll have to put them there by hand.

        Make a backup of everything in /etc before you unpack net-base. 
        Then unpack it from / (the root directory):
