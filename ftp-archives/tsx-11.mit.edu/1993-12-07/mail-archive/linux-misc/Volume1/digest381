Are there any releases of Linux that are available on CD-Rom?

Subject: Wildcat BBS
Date: 5 Dec 93 15:26:39 GMT


        A BBS Sysop wants to add Internet FTP/TELNET access to
his Wildcat BBS, and he asked me to ask the following questions. I
really would appreciate some ideas so I can help him out on the project.
      1)What he wants to do is run Linux on a different computer
that has a SLIP connection to the Internet, and allow his callers on
theother machine to run a door from Wildcat to access the other
machine. Does anyone know of Doors for Wildcat! that could possibly do
this?  Also, could this idea work of having callers login via modem from
theother computer?
      2)He wants to use his existing Lantastic network to
connect the two computers. Does Linux support Lantastic, or only
Novell, etc.?
      3)To connect the two computers would it be easier to just
use some serial/null modem cables to trick Linux into running off of
the other computer?
     4)Also, can Linux be implemented remotely over
a modem at all, with a user running the traditional MS-dos comm program?
I also have heard of a few unix BBS systems, could one of these be run
on the SLIP machine and tied to the Wildcat machine more easily? The BBS
he runs is two nodes, and he would like to have twopossible callers
access the Internet at the same time doing FTP, TelnetEtc..We would both
like to see this project succed, so I would apprecuiate ANY suggestions,
or alternative possibilties.
    Thanks,

Adam Husik

Subject: SLS - Installation
Date: 6 Dec 93 03:09:22 GMT


    I have just spent more then five hours trying to Install the SLS
release of Linux with bad luck..here are the details I would really be
greatful if someone could help me out.

    - I have a Intel 486/33 with a 200 meg HD. The way I want it
partitioned eventially is with a 50 meg dos partition and the rest
devoted to Linux. I used linux's fdisk to make HDA2 -> 4's but they were
all primary. As I only have 4 megs of ram,  I want to set up swap space
also. What kind of partitions should I make, and how big should they be
respectively?
    - I tried to install the complete package with...
    "doinstall /dev/hda1 /dev/hda2 /dev/hda3", but after 30 minutes of
swapping disks the HDA device was supposedly filled up, and my
installation stopped in the middle of the X-Window package.
    I think the best thing to do now is to repartition/mount the
filesystems, but I just don't know how I should set up the
partitions(for a 200 meg drive) to allow me to run X, compile programs,
and run large programs like EMAC'S to allow plenty of HD space, and swap
space also.
    Any help is needed<G>, and would be greatly appreciated!

Inherently true.

Even there you're not sure to get the MOST CURRENT code. The newest code
always is found on the boxes of the coders.

_*WRONG*_
I recently bought a dutch CD-ROM called SNOW 2.0 _beta_, which has a
distribution on it that was made especially for that CD-ROM. So it
doesn't include Linux, nor any patched sources.

Dear Brian,

There is a solution for changing the current vga mode WITHOUT recompiling the kernel
under linux 0.99patch13:

try: rdev -v <device> <videomode>

device is for example '/dev/fd0' and videomode is for example 'NORMAL_VGA'.


Have fun!

            Video card vendor names and contact addresses:
            ----------------------------------------------

This small FAQ lists all known video card vendor and video chipset vendor
address and phone numbers. If you find any mistakes in the list, please 
forward the corrections to me so that I can keep it up to date. If you
have a number or address not lists (or not known), please send this 
information to me also.

Please verify any information first before sending it to me (ie: you
have actually contacted them on the number etc). 

Thanks to all those who repsonded to my original request for information.
The list is now much more complete, but if you have anything to add or
find any mistakes please email me the details.

I will probably be contacting a large proportion of these companies 
within the next month to verify and expand the information contained 
within.

Subject: Quality of Documentation (Re: Linux Con sortium)
Date: 6 Dec 1993 14:24:55 GMT


markline@henson.cc.wwu.edu (Mark Line) writes:
> German documentation, should there be any really good stuff out there,

  [On a side note, yes, there is indeed a good German introduction to
   Linux.  It is called `Linuxhandbuch', and you can either buy it as a
   book or ftp it as a PostScript file for free. Linus has dedicated a
   kernel version to this introduction.]

Documentation quality largely depends on what is `standard' in a
certain environment.  For example, nearly all freeware Amiga programs
come with excellent docs.  Amiga programmers go to great pains to
explain anything and everything.  Part of the reason is that a popular
German magazine `Amiga' flames all bad documentation. Undocumented
commercial programs get abysmal marks, which makes them nearly
unsellable in Germany.  Amiga's line is, `Professional programs have
professional manuals'.  Freeware authors follow suit to prove
that their code is at least as professional as commercial code.

As far as I understand, programmers have four lines of reasoning why
things are different with Linux (which, BTW, seems to change, albeit
slowly):

- Linux is a Unix clone.  Everyone knows Unix, doesn't he?  So why
bother with docs.  Your system at work comes with heavy manuals.
Use those if you are really interested.  Or buy some books, your local
book shop is full of them...

- Linux doesn't HAVE commercial software.  So the documentation
standard for Linux is nought.  I am doing better than average, don't I?  
I'm providing a README file.  So stop pestering me, I have work to do...

- What do you mean, no documentation?  I HAVE provided documentation,
and it took me a lot of hard work, too.  A certain person with Scottish
surname has neglected to include it with his Linux `distribution'...

- I learned programming {at a first-class university, from a C
programming book}.  Why should I write documentation?  I'm not trained
for this.  We had excellent {courses, chapters} on how to use function
pointers.  Nobody taught me to explain, and anyway, I *hated* English
lessons at school...

Some of these arguments are quite valid, and I would not like software
authors blamed for what really isn't their fault.  If someone does a
bad job at collecting a sw contribution, which is rated poor by the
consortium in consequence, doesn't this hurt the (innocent) sw authors,
too?

On the other hand, I like the idea of docs evaluation.  After all, this
might help distributors or software authors to improve on their
documentation skills.   If the Consortium yells `THIS SOFTWARE IS
SHITWARE' at all badly documented code or distributions, and if it
earnestly tries to be fair and objective about it, I think they should
go right ahead.

Nope, I am not getting mine either.  I have noticed the list getting
a little erratic lately, things seem to come in bursts, with repeats.
My last incoming digest was dated Sat Dec  4 07:50.

I suppose it would also explain how to set up X Windows....

I haven't read this entire thread, but...

SLS hasn't really been abandoned....Peter has had his hands full for the last
few months (I sent him some email last week and got a reply).  He's planning to
come out with a SLS 1.05 version by the end of December, from what I understand.

Yes, of course there is a tremendous effort underway!  Believe me, I
have spent many an hour perusing its fruits!  My comments did not
address the question of who was doing what in the way of documentation.
Rather, I was speaking (somewhat abstractly) about the logical implications
or consequences of the two basic positions which have been presented in
this thread and the last long one on this topic: namely, the "the-code-
IS-the documentation" position and its opposite.  This is a very different
question from the question of who has embraced which of these positions,
and to what effect.

I agree that people developing documentation are "developers", though here  
what (or whom) I mean by "Linux developers" (and the term may have
one or more established meanings which I'm not following) is basically
anyone who writes/contributes/ports software to Linux.  This could be
you, me, him, her..... (as you say, walls being torn down).  My take here
is basically a followup to discussion of the fact that one can have
a great variety of experiences when one downloads Linux-based software,
with respect to the amount and nature of the documentation.  Again, I am
not empiricizing the likelihood of having any particular experience,
but discussing the underlying issues.

And in fact, the emphasis in this sentence was on "not _obliged_".  In
other words, I am aligning myself with those who take the position that
one cannot attack or condemn the authors of free software for failing
to provide "enough" documentation.  But I take this position within the
context of what I said earlier: namely, that the existence (or not) of
documentation in connection with any software does have consequences
(which is a separate matter from the ethical matter of whether we should
be denouncing people for doing things one way or the other).
