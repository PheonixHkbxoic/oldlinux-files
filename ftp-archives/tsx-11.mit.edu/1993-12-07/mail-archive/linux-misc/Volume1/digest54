        Why is a *lawsuit* necessary to stop this sort of stealing?
The GPL is a fairly famous (infamous?) document, and any company who
tries to take a GPL-ed piece of code and market it as their own 
proprietary stuff is going to come under SUBSTANTIAL pressure from the
community who knows where this software came from, and what is
required for distribution, modifications, etc.  I think even the most
ardent opponents of the GNU project would agree that this is just
not something that one can do.  A software company makes money largely
because of publicity about their products, bad press about them is
a better weapon than a lawsuit, IMHO.

I don't know what the Copyright laws in Finland are like.  I also don't know
what the US Copyright laws say about works produced in other countries but
distributed here.  But let's assume something reasonable: that a work produced
overseas and published in the US is covered by US Copyright law for all
activities taking place in the US and by people under US jurisdiction.  (I
don't know whether this assumption is correct, it just seems reasonable to me.)

In that case, Linus has Copyright on Linux (more precisely, the parts of the
kernel that bear his name or were otherwise demonstrably created by him).  If
someone violates that Copyright by acting outside the bounds of the software
license (in this case, the GPL), then they are in violation of copyright law. 
Under those laws, Linus could sue the offending party in a court of
appropriate jurisdiction for damages.  I don't know whether the court of
appropriate jurisdiction would be state or federal, or both, but that isn't
particularly relevant.

That Linus holds the Copyright on the Linux kernel would be difficult to
dispute.  His name is in just about every kernel source file.  There are tens
of thousands of witnesses all over the world who would testify as to its
authorship.  The fact that he has not registered his copyright in the US is
irrelevant (with the "reasonable assumption" I made above), because under
current copyright law an author automatically has Copyright on any work he/she
produces.  Registering the copyright, or even including a notice like
"Copyright 1993 Linus Torvaldos", is simply a means of making it easier to
verify the Copyright owner.

The practical questions of whether Linus would actually choose to defend his
copyright in court, or whether he could afford the legal costs of doing so,
are entirely separate issues.  It is not out of the question, though---he
could probably find a lawyer to work on a contingency basis.

In short, this topic doesn't seem particularly relevant.  Unless you want to
discuss details of international copyright law, the issue is pretty clear cut:
Linus has copyright on Linux and could prosecute anyone who violates the
license he has granted.  If you *do* want to discuss the details of
international copyright law (and I don't), there is certainly a more
appropriate newsgroup for it.

You need a better loophole.  At least in the US, there's a nominal
filing fee to REGISTER a copyright with the government, but there's no
requirement that you actually file the form in order to have protection
under the copyright law.  Copyright exists from the moment your "fixed,
tangible expression" is created...forms or no forms.

The benefit you get from registering a copyright (again, at least in the
US) is that you can nail people with a stiffer penalty if they violate
your copyright.  If you haven't registered, you can still take them to
court and get the court to make them stop infringing, but your ability
to collect damages, etc. depends on whether you filed the form.

Violation of a copyright is a crime if a crime is defined as a violation of
the law.  Whether the law dealing with that
crime is enforcible or not is a separate issue.

There is morality and legality.  It is possible that the GPL'er could sue
a violator.  This may not happen because of the money and time needed to
do this, but it is a possibility.  If nothing else, there is morality.
I would be extremely bad looking if Sun, for example decided to violate
the GPL on Linux.  Sun's competitors might be the first to offer legal
assistance to Linus..... if you get my meaning.

Same here.  Except 386BSD is booted after the timeout instead of Linux :-).

There are some copyright problems with shoelace, but they mostly don't
affect winiboot.  I think LILO was written partly as an overreaction
to the copyright problems.

This is the main reason why a BSD-style bootblock won't work for
Linux.  Linux originally had only the minix fs, which allows only
1K for the boot program where 386BSD's requires 8K.

I't might be good to put multiboot stuff in the 386BSD boot block.
The code is trivial except for mode-switching stuff which the
the "BIOS" 386BSD boot blocks already handle.

The 386BSD subpartioning leaves a lot to be desired.  It should at
least handle the standard 4 partitions.  Then there are extended
partitions.  I think DOS allows at most 26 partitions per drive (up to
25 of them in extended partitions), and Linux is normally wired for at
most 8 partitions per drive, but I once supported 32 partitions per
drive in the Minix driver.  The 386BSD approach is best except for the
small number of subpartition and lack of support for foreign
partitions.  Foreign partitions need to be supported if only to avoid
writing to them.

Subject: Problems with term
Date: Wed, 25 Aug 1993 18:27:15 GMT

I am not sure whether this problem belongs in this newsgroup, but there
is no 'term' newsgroup, so let me just try.

I am running term 1.0.7 between a large and fast 66/33 pc with Linux and a
not-so-large and fast Sun3/80 with SunOS 4.1.1. The modem I'm using is
a Supra Fax (V.32bis) (identical modems are used on both ends).

My problem is that I cannot transmit files (tupload) equally fast in both
direction. The sun-to-pc direction is OK, but file transfers in the opposite
direction get into error loops, unless I reduce the window size at the pc
end to $1$. Note that the problem has nothing to do (I think) with unescaped
special characters as everything works fine when window size is one.
Below I list the termrc files:

        PC:

                compress on
                baudrate 38400
                timeout 50
                window 1
                noise on

        Sun:

                compress on
                baudrate 38400
                timeout 50
                window 3
                noise on

With this configuration everything works fine (except for the speed), but
when I change the window parameter on the PC side to 3 (or even to 2),
file transfers from the pc to the sun break down.

I have tried a number of easy tricks, also trying to escape some characters,
but nothing seemed to work.

I have been suspecting flow control problems with the modem on the Sun's side,
but changing the flow control options in all possible directions hasn't
improved anything either.

Thanks in advance for any hints,

I have found booting to be annoying on _ALL_ IBM-PC based hardware.  My
old Heath H-8 had software that would allow me to boot at will from
_ANY_ disk partition (And it supported like up to 256), as well as from
floppy.   The H-120 used to come up and give you "The Finger" and allow
you to boot either DOS(86) or CP/M-85 from the finger prompt.

My first thought on an AT was "But what if I want to boot something
besides DOS?"  Oh, I get to jump thru hoops, nice.

Speaking of copyrights and all that and Linux as an embedded OS and all

keeping GPL-ed code out of the kernel.  So I assume it's just Regents
of the U. of California copyright on it.  Well that gives Corporate

Testing the read capability of the SCSI system is simply a question of
reading in enough data that it reduces the effects of the block cache to
a minimum.  That's easy: just try reading an entire partition, e.g.

    time dd bs=8192 if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/null

or you can use the entire drive:

    time dd bs=8192 if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null

Testing the write capability of the SCSI system is a bit more of a problem.
However, it's really not *that* much of a problem.  Instead of mounting
a SCSI filesystem normally, use the "sync" option, e.g.

    mount -t ext2fs -o sync /dev/sda1 /mnt
    time dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/foo bs=8192 count=1000

Unless there's something in the dd code that causes it to do the wrong thing
anyway, you should get decent numbers, right?

Yes, I realize that you'll have to worry about filesystem overhead (and
possibly unintended seeks) during the write test.  I can't think of a good
alternative, however.

This depends on how much actual memory you have available.  2 GCC's running
at the same time will try to access twice as much data as 1 GCC.  If your
memory is small enough, and you have swapping enabled, you'll page to disk
more often than you would if you ran the 2 GCC's sequentially.  Since the
amount of CPU spent actually running GCC will add up to the same amount
anyway, it subtracts out and you're left with the amount of time spent
hitting the disk.  Having 2 GCC's going won't necessarily hit the disk just
twice as often as 1 GCC.  The reason is that Linux dynamically balances the
size of the buffer cache and the size of the core memory.  Having 2 GCC's
going instead of one means that your memory consumption is greater by the
amount of disjoint data space that exists between the two processes.  There
are lots of things that will affect how disjoint this is, like how the two
processes are prioritized relative to each other, how closely in time they
were started to each other, the characteristics of the files being compiled,
etc.  Suffice it to say that your memory will be reduced by some amount as
a result of both compiles going at once, which means you have that much
less to use for your buffer cache, which means that your buffer cache will
get more misses.  So how much you'll lose depends on how I/O intensive the
applications are and how much I/O they have in common inside some time
interval.

How much of a win it is to run 2 GCC's depends a lot on how much buffer
cache space they can share.  I don't think the clean data page sharing
is going to affect you that much (if at all) in comparison to running the
two processes sequentially, unless you're *already* paging to disk.  Clean
page sharing is intended to minimize the amount of paging to disk that
happens.  If you're not paging to disk anyway, it won't make any difference.
However, you might avoid paging to disk *because* of it.  :-)

And, as noted, the buffer cache will likely still have the pages you want
even if you run them sequentially, and there'll be more space for those
pages.

So: the fastest way, if you won't be paging to disk, is to run them
sequentially, thus maximizing the effects of the buffer cache.  If you're
already paging to disk, then you'll have to figure out where the pivot
point in the curve is.  At some number of simultaneous processes going,
the amount of time you spend hitting the disk will go nonlinear with
respect to the number of processes you have.

As with anything else free, this advice comes with no warranties, either
expressed or implied.  :-)

Subject: Mitsuimi CD comes up on the first try :-)
Date: 25 Aug 1993 17:50:45 -0700

With all the crap in c.o.l.*, I wanted to personally thank anybody who
had anything to do with the *FINE* Mitsuimi cd implementation that went
into 0.99-12 and also Linus for installing it in the default kernel
sources. 

I edited mcd.h to set my addresses to match the board and it came
up the first time...amazing!

now to find a non-x-based audio cd player :-)


[...on the MS-DOS side I found that if you start up an audio Cd with
        the 'playcd.exe' command and quit out of it without stopping
        the CD, it keeps on playing the CD :-) - now if I can get linux
        to do that too...]

Anyway, fantastic job !!!
