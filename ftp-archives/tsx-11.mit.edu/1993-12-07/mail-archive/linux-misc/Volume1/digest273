I get very slight variations, which I put down to temperature effects.

BogoMips aren't the whole story. I have put Linux on a 486DX/33 with
8Mb ram, 8Mb swap on a 120Mb IDE drive with a cacheing disk controller.
The Bogomip rating is about 16.3. The kernel (pl13) compiles & builds
to zImage in 15 1/2 mins (having done the config, depend, clean already).

I also have put it up on a 386DX/25 system with 4Mb ram, 28Mb swap
on 2 MFM drives (40Mb & 120Mb). The Bogomip rating is 4.53 & the kernel
takes 1 1/2 hours to build. The Bogomip ratio is < 4 but the kernel
compile time ratio is about 6. I suspect the latter is nearer the true
difference in performance in general use. I expect the larger RAM &
the cacheing disk controller on the 486 have a lot of influence on
the numbers.

Maybe, but that does not mean that in the end there will be only one
freely available OS.  Each person will decide which OS they like and
use it.  If there are more choices, everybody benefits.

The FSF is not in a battle against other freely available software!

Date: 4 Nov 93 12:30:20


This question is primarily directed at any Japanese readers of this
newsgroup.

I have a Japanese 386 system called the FM TOWNS, made by Fujitsu
(it's a long story). It runs a strange sort-of-DOS/window-like OS
which is not compatible with anything made in the USA. I have been
using it as a CD player, but would really really like to run Linux on
it.

I was wondering if anyone if there is a version of Linux which is
known to run on the FM TOWNS. 

Arigato gozaimashita!

I run 1024x768 on my Hitachi 15" monitor at home all the time.  I have
a good refresh rate (about 69Hz).  I also run 1152x910 from time to
time, when I need a screen that size.  It is OK, having a poorer
refresh rate (about 59Hz) it causes more strain on the eyes.

At work I use 1152x910 all the time on a 17" monitor w/o any ill
effects.  The monitor has a Sony Trinitron tube and is connected to a
SS2.

I read in the manual that all the extra memory does is to allow you to
display at higher resolutions with more colours -- I read that if you
have more memory on the card, you _may_ have to slow down the card! 

I have 486DX-33 8Mb RAM and a VL-BUS Actix GraphicsEngine32+ and I get
about 84K Xstones with XFree86-2.0.

I don't think they were interested in Linux because Linux was
originally designed for only the i386/i486 machines.  I think that the
mission statement for the FSF was clearly to create a freed operating
system that will be portable to many machines.

Linux pretty much is _the_ Free OS (I don't really mean to snub
FreeBSD, but when you start seeing lots of people cutting CD-ROMs of
something, you throw some sacks of sand on the scales in favor of what
they're cutting...) for i386 machines. But what about 5 years from
now? Those 386/486/Pentium machines will still be around, but there
will be the Alphas, MIPS, and PowerPC machines to play with also.

>To echo the converse of earlier Hurd vs. Linux conversations: let's put the

Hurd's got a different goal: to be portable between architectures. How
many Linux ports have there been to machines other than 386/486's?
How many people use them? Hurd has its place, on the PowerPC 620 that
I plan on buying when it comes out. I don't know that Linux will ever
be ported to a lot of different architectures, and Linux certainly
won't be able to take advantage of multiprocessor architectures as
easily as Mach/Hurd will. Linux has its place: on i386/i486/Pentium
machines sitting in the corner 5 years from now.

There are at least two problems with this approach.  First of all, if you're
going to put in a major effort to produce an operating system, why not
create an integrated step forwards instead of hacks on an existing product?
Most of us have had experiences with that Bride of Frankenstein known as
"System V with BSD extensions", and would like to avoid such things.

Secondly, the monolithic kernel approach taken by Linus, while appropriate for 
an OS with a single Chief Designer, makes it much more difficult for others to 
experiment with kernel extensions.  You try to modify the scheduler, for
for example, and then find that it's wired into the pager, and so on.  The
mach / hurd paradigm makes it much easier for folks to hack in kernel
extensions and improvements.  As with any other endeavor, if you make 
experimentation easier, you increase the chances that experimentation will
occur.

It is the "update" process...

Did you notice that, when you are logged off, your machine does not
stop running... :-))

Unix is a multiuser system, many people and many process may continue
to run even if you don't use the machine yourself.

If you have access to Computer Select CD (a computer journal archive),
look up recent articles on boards.  I know that in the last 3 months
I've seen a handful of very informative articles on boards in the 
Shopper, PC Magazine, and PC World.  I think there was also one in 
BYTE.  All of these from reputable sources. 

If you looking for a beginners guide article, PC Magazine almost always
goes super-in-depth but explains everything along the way.  So my 
recommendation would be to look for the most recent article from PC 
Magazine.

Obviously, if you don't have access to Computer Select, go to your
library.  Trust me, take the time out to get ALL your answers at once
AND know that they aren't half-truths.  

I'm not discouraging any recommendations from others mind you, just 
pointing you where to get the BEST info.
