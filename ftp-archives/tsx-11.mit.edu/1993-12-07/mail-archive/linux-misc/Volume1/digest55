   I have no great love for Microsoft, but let's be serious here.  Look at
the PC's that people use.  What OS do they run?  MS-DOS.  What environment?
Windows.  What applications?  Excel.  Word.

   It constantly amazes me that people on Usenet seem to ignore the fact that
99% of the people in the world use their applications at the lowest levels of
functionality.  I.E.  Secretaries type letters with Word.  Managers do
cost-estimation with Excel.  They typically *don't* use the advanced,
yet buggy features simply because they don't need them.  If they don't see the
bugs, they see no reason not to buy the latest, greatest update, whose new
functionality gets ignored, as well.  If something *does* go wrong, what is
the typical response of the typical secretary?  "I must have done something
wrong."

Regarding the post at the start of the quoted text:

   As for Microsoft wanting the lion's share of the market, guess what
folks?  It's a for-profit company.  They exist solely to make money.
What's the best way to make money?  Kill your competition, *especially* if
they have a better product.  Even if they don't.  What exactly does
morality have to do with this?  Saying that they are 'evil' is basically
saying that people shouldn't strive to be successful.  Gee, maybe we all
should spend the rest of our lives flipping burgers for each other.  But
make sure that we avoid trying to provide a decent standard of living for
our families.

That would be moral by your logic, right?

I suggest the original poster (and anybody else who is interested in
the issue of copyrights) read the FAQ on copyrights in news.answers
(posted 26th of this month, I seem to notice).

Brief summary (and probably overly brief):  America is a signatory to
the Berne Convention (as are a *lot* of countries).  All works are
automatically copyright (unless otherwise stated) by the author, and
don't even *require* the existence of a copyright notice.

Hasn't happened yet.  Sigh.

Methinks you don't have quite enough understanding of the perversity of the
universe or, at least, of the software market.  :-)

Hi.

I am interested in buying an external SCSI CD-ROM for my Linux/486 system. Is
there a list of drives that are guarantueed to work ? What are the

Please respond by e-mail, and I'll summarize upon sufficient interest (this

...yes "talk" likes to dump core. But it serves you right for having your
whole system lying in one partition. You should consider putting /usr
on one, /usr/X386 on another, /home on another, /tmp and /usr/tmp on
yet another, and so on. That way if something dies and screws up your
filesystem, you don't lose everything. And if you launch talk from /tmp
then a core dump won't kill you.

As for why talk dumps core, well join the NET channel and you will find out
when it gets fixed. Or you can limit the size of your core dumps. I think 
how to do this is in the FAQ.

Paul.

Its worth bearing in mind that on many motherboard/BIOS combinations
the amount of cache you have determines the range of cachable memory
addresses.

I upgraded from 16Mb RAM to 20Mb and experienced a severe slowdown in
the system (with 64k cache). People suggested that when memory above
16Mb was accessed it couldn't be cached and the whole caching system
was turned off! The manual had no details about this at all...

Anyway, upgrading the cache (to 256k) solved the problem.

                                Mark.

PS I'm not an expert on this - I just experienced the problem...

At home I run a worldblazer with my Linux box.  I get 1950-2000
characters per second with compressed news feeds.  I have a (lowly)
386-16 with 4 megs of ram and a 16 meg swap space.  I have a 2 serial,
1 parallel, 1 gameport card with a chip on it that emulates 16550s.
Paid all of $49 for it (list price - I was in a hurry).  I run the
interface at 38.4k and may move it up someday when I want to use a
full v32bis/v42bis connection.  I move 20-50 megs a day this way - day
in and day out plus I use this same modem for logins to my system and
also use it to log into several other unix computers.

It works for me :-)

Try using the following after getting this error :

route add <remoteserver-ip>
route add <networkconnecting to> gw <your gateway|remoteserver-ip>

I connect using a Terminal-Server who has a SLIP-Modeve works fine for me.

BTW: dip will call route using route add <remoteserver-ip> gw <remoteserver-ip>
     This call produces the error-message. I'm not a network-wizard, perhaps

Ian... you've been brainwashed.   When was the last time you've seen
*ANY* mention of the GNU project in *ANY* trade publication?  Hmmm?

The sad fact is that what is so commonly known to us (Usenetters) is
hardly, if ever, heard of out in the real world where the cash flows.

And why would a publisher of a trade rag want to give a paying advertiser
bad press, hmmm???  Chances are the rag's publisher doesn't use GNU-ware.

There are lots and lots of computer-wise professionals who've never even
*heard* of the Usenet or of the GNU project.  They're the ones that think
you're talking about the latest version of PK-Zip even though you make
special effort to over-emphasize the "Guh-NOO" when you say "gnu-zip".
They typically think you're just making a bad pronunciation joke.

It all comes down to CA$H, Ian.  You don't make much selling free software
on comission.  ;-)  No one I know of has enough motivation and enough CA$H
to make much stink over a Copyright violation of Linux.

Prospective clients of such a scoundrel might not like the sound of the
accusation (should they ever manage to hear of it), but with no law-suit,
no *action* against this scoundrel, their main concerns would be:

        Does the software work?
        Does it do what I want?
        Is it inexpensive?

        ...typical customer-type questions to be soothed by slick
        marketroids and their salesoid cousins into making the deal.

I think the original author (I'm sorry, I forget his name) was
working on using the bfd library which gdb uses. Then it would work
on all platforms that bfd supports.

Actually, I am surprised to hear that ups is working under 386BSD.
My impression was that it was too closely tied to the SPARC
architecture. Who did the port? Any reasons why bfd wasn't used?

No, the definition of a crime includes *punishment*.  There is no punishment
for plagiarism.  None.  Copyright merely gives the one violated the right to
sue the violator for damages... but when you're giving your product away,
you're not even making any profit... so there can be no damages!

Give me a break.  I'll lay even odds that *MOST* Sun users have never even
*HEARD* of the GNU project!!
