Here's a revision of my SLIP instructions, for pl12

These are instructions for configuration SLIP, for 0.99pl10 through
pl12 with the net2 utilities.  At the end there is a list of common
problems and solutions.

I compiled pl10 with libc4.3.3 and gcc 2.3.3, and pl11 and pl12 with
libc 4.4.1 and gcc 2.4.3 with no trouble.  However there have been
some reports of problems with these versions, so Linux recommends
using gcc 2.4.3 for pl10 and pl11, and 2.4.5 with pl12.

This depends upon the programs you want to use.  For the set I use
(which is just the more common ones), all I seem to need is hosts,
host.conf, and resolv.conf.  The rest of them are files for specific
services or specific options of services, which you may not need in a
simple SLIP environment.  (E.g. exports is for running an NFS server,
not very likely over SLIP.)  The way I have it set up is with
the following files on /etc:

hosts: a single line listing my host only (seems to be needed by dip):

    128.6.200.2 foo.rutgers.edu foo

Obviously you'll use your own IP address and host name.  You give the
IP address, the full hostname, and the abbreviation (i.e. just the
part up to the first dot).  In the case of SLIP, it's possible that
you won't know your IP address until you dial.  Often it is assigned
dynamically at that point.  In that case, the hostname will be
different each time also.  You can consider using a fake hostname,
e.g. your own name.  The hostname you use won't matter unless you use
services that cause you to pass a hostname to the other end, e.g.
mail, news, and the Berkeley r commands.  For simple telnet and ftp it
doesn't matter.  (I always call my machine hedrick.rutgers.edu, but
I'm not using any fancy services.)  If you need to use services that
depend upon a hostname, you'll need to arrange a real entry in your
host table.  Talk to your network managers.

host.conf: one line specifying the order in which to use the hosts
file and the resolver.  I suggest

    order hosts bind

resolv.conf: your domain and nameserver.  For Rutgers this would be

    domain rutgers.edu
    nameserver 128.6.4.4

The domain is what you want to be tacked onto the end of host names
you type if you don't say otherwise.  E.g. if domain is set to
rutgers.edu, and you say "telnet foo", you'll get foo.rutgers.edu.
You can of course always specify a full name and override that
default.  The nameserver is the address of a machine that will provide
name service for you.  You'll want to pick the nearest name server to
the system you dial into.  Your systems support staff should be able
to help you here.  One approach would be to look at /etc/resolv.conf
on a system at your site.  You should be able to use whatever
nameserver is listed there.  128.6.4.4 will actually work from
elsewhere, but it's considered unfriendly to do name lookups 
across the network.  (I'd say it's OK to use for testing purposes,
but you should find a server at your site.)

If you have the three files I mention set up, I think all you need to
do is

1) dial using kermit or some other program.  Get SLIP turned on.  (I
can't help with that.  It depends upon the system you're using.)

2) if it assigns different addresses each time, edit /etc/hosts to
get the right address

3) run dip.  E.g.

   dip -t
   remote 1.2.3.4
   port tty65
   speed 19200
   mode SLIP

Instead of 1.2.3.4, use the IP address of the system you have dialed.
Not the address it assigns for your machine, but the address of the
terminal server or Unix box that is running SLIP for you.

for tty65 use the name of the tty line on your machine (probably
something like ttys0)

for 19200 use whatever speed your modem is set for

4) dip will exit.  "ps agx" should show that it is still running.  Now

   /etc/route add default gw 1.2.3.4
   /usr/etc/inetd

where 1.2.3.4 is the same address you used above.  Run inetd only
if you want incoming services.  For initial testing, I wouldn't use it.

5) now try some tests, e.g. 

   ping 1.2.3.4

or
   telnet 1.2.3.4

Now try it with a hostname

   ping foo

or 

   telnet foo

=================

Here's a list of common problems and solutions:

1) connections open, but no data flows.  For this problem to apply,
it must apply for all destination hosts, and no data must flow at
all.

  - probably your system and the SLIP router disagree about
        the setting of header compression. Note that 0.99pl10
        as originally issued does not have header compression.
        There is a patch that I put on athos.rutgers.edu.  If
        you put it in, you always have header compression.
        I had hoped that in 0.99pl11 it would be under the
        control of an option in ifconfig, but pl11 and pl12
        are shipped with compression always on.

  - to fix this, you must change the setting on either your
        system or the SLIP router.  The ideal situation is
        to enable header compression on both.  If you have
        0.99pl10, you can enable compression by applying
        the patches in athos.rutgers.edu:/pub/linux/slhc.tar.
        In later versions I believe header compression is on
        by default.  If you can't enable
        compression on the SLIP router, then you have to
        disable it on Linux.  With the initial 0.99pl10,
        it is disabled.  If you applied my patch, it enables
        header compression.  To disable it: look in slip.c for
        the routine sl_encaps.  remove the line that calls
        sl_compress.  That should be all that's needed.

  - in 0.99pl11, header compression is on by default.
        to disable it, look in slip.c for
        the routine sl_encaps.  remove the line that calls
        sl_compress.  That should be all that's needed.

  - in 0.99pl12, header compression is on by default.
        to disable it, look in .../linux/net/inet/CONFIG
        for the definition of SLIP_OPTS.  Remove 
        -DSL_COMPRESSED, and rebuild the kernel.  (Make
        sure that slip.o gets rebuilt.  If not, remove
        slip.o to force it.)

  - note that header compression makes a major difference 
        to responsiveness of the system.  I would not be
        interested in SLIP without header compression.  Echo
        delay is just too painful.  You might want to consider
        kermit or term if your SLIP router doesn't understand
        header compression.  (On the other hand, header
        compression is widely available, so I'd think you
        should be able to enable it on the SLIP router.)

2) connnections open, data flows, but wherever I try to send
more than a few lines of output, the connection hangs.

  - this is probably an MTU problem.  Probably the host you
        are talking to is sending 1500-byte packets, and
        the SLIP router is set to something smaller.  (Berkeley
        SLIP defaults to 1006.)  In that case, the SLIP router
        will fragment the packets.  Linux TCP/IP can't 
        reassemble fragments.  

  -  In dip, specify a smaller
        MTU.  I believe 512 should be safe.  I normally use
        192.  This is probably counter-intuitive.  Since the
        problem is with accepting large packets, you'd probably
        think the solution would be to raise Linux's MTU to
        1500 so you can accept a full 1500 byte packet. 
        The problem is actually an interaction between the
        Linux system and the SLIP router.  It isn't that
        Linux is incapable of handling large packets, but that
        the SLIP router isn't, and is fragmenting them.  What
        you need to do is make sure that neither end sends
        packets large enough that they need to be fragmented.
        When a TCP connection opens, the two ends tell each
        other what the maximum packet size they want is.  They
        then use the minimum of those.  So by setting the
        Linux MTU to 512 or 192, Linux will tell the other end
        to use a small packet.  Thus fragmentation won't happen.
        Another approach would be to increase the MTU on the
        SLIP router, so it doesn't fragment the packet. 
        In many cases this may not be practical.

3) Things work erratically.  Connections open, but eventually
hang.  Timeouts shown in netstat -o are long.  Typically you'll
have more trouble with hosts on the Internet than with local hosts.

  - the TCP code in 0.99pl10 is buggy.  It doesn't compute
        retransmission times correctly. Sometimes it will get
        into a state where it never retransmits.  I believe this
        is fixed in 0.99pl11, but I can't say for sure, as I haven't
        use it.  (It's possible that pl11 fixes this and introduces
        a different bug.)

  - if you have unmodified 0.99pl10, apply the patches in
        athos.rutgers.edu:/pub/linux/slhc.tar.  Aside from
        compressed SLIP, this has a number of fixes to TCP/IP.
        Note however that if you apply these fixes as is, you're
        enabling header compression.  If this causes problems
        (see (1)), you may need to disable header compression.

  - these patches are already present in pl11 and pl12, so I
        have no advice if you are running one of those.  pl12
        has some timer fixes compared with pl11, so I'd probably
        advise you to try moving to pl12.

4) I'm not sure what the exact symptoms for this one would be, but
they might be similar to 2 or 3.  I.e. some things would work, but
there would be erratic failures or hangs.

  - flow control must be set up properly between the computer
        and modem.  Thus is true at both ends.  (Of course flow
        control is only one possible problem in modem setup.
        You also need to make sure that the modem and line
        speeds match, etc.)  In general if you're using a 
        simple v.32 modem, you may be able to do without
        flow control.  However if your modem does error
        control, compression or speed-matching, then you'll need to 
        talk to it at a higher speed than the data is actually 
        transferred at, and depend upon flow control to throttle 
        the data.  At any rate, the modem and computer must agree.

  - the only flow control that is practical for SLIP is
        hardware flow control.  Flow control using ^S/^Q
        (XOFF/XON) is not practical.  The most common kind of
        hardware flow control is RTS/CTS, so called because
        it uses the RTS and CTS lines to handle flow control.
        The version of "dip" I have seems to set RTS/CTS
        flow control all the time (which is certainly
        appropriate).  In that case, you'd want to make sure
        that the modem used with your Linux system has
        RTS/CTS flow control enabled.

5) I get "no route to host" or "network unreachable", or something similar.

  - probably you don't have a default route.  by default dip
        sets up a route to the SLIP router, but nothing else.

  - try "netstat -n -r".  Here is the correct display under pl12:

     Kernel routing table
     Destination net/address   Gateway address      Flags RefCnt    Use Iface
     default                   128.6.4.54           UGN        0   8055 sl0
     128.6.4.54                *                    UH         0      1 sl0

     You should have a host route (flags includes "H") to the slip
     server you're connected to, and a default route with "G" in the
     flags field listing that as the gateway.

  - If the default route is missing, you need to do 
        /etc/route add default net A.B.C.D, where
    A.B.C.D is the address of your SLIP router.  (This
    should be the address shows as "point-to-point addr"
    if you do /etc/ifconfig sl0.)  The default netmask
    also seems wierd, but in a typical SLIP setup it
    shouldn't matter.

  - If the host route is missing, I don't have a fix.  It should be set
    up by dip.

That's way too complex. Txconn, which comes with the term package does all
of that for you.  Running txconn the the remote machine is all that there is
to it.  Txconn does all the rerouting for you so there is no need to go through
what you propose.  I have been running things this way for quite a while with

First, a little background:

Just about every piece of Linux documentation I have ever read (most
of it, including the new guides) such as The Linux FAQ and The
INFO-SHEET mentions SLS again and again.  So, the first time I
installed Linux, I went with SLS 1.02 (note: I haven't installed X
because I don't need it).

SLS was buggy, and I mailed Peter MacDonald a number of bug reports
concerning: file permissions, binary repeats, missing descriptions in
the install procedure, old versions of gzip, tar, emacs, everything.
I don't know what the effect of mailing them all since I never heard
back, but when 1.03 came out all of these problems were supposedly
fixed and when I helped a friend install with 1.03 it was the same
thing as before . . . buggy, cryptic installation, lousy
documentation, I could go on for hours, but I'll spare you (I'm
certain you've all seen the amount of posts on c.o.l. about bugs and
SLS 1.03).

Anyway, next time when I re-installed (to update gcc and libc) (with
1.03), there was a problem and it would not work for some reason.  So,
I decided to try out MCC.

For people who have tired of this long post I'll make it plain and
simple so you can go on.

** MCC is a wonderful installation package. **

MCC makes sense, it really does.  Let's compare SLS and MCC a little:

task/item       SLS 1.03                MCC 0.99-p10+
========================================================================
breakdown of    by disk (i.e. a1-4,     by package (user puts files
installation    b1-7, each composed     on disks in similar manner
files           of tgz files having     to SLS, but each tgz file is
                unrelated files put     a package like emacs, or gcc.)
                together.)

documentation   a 2 page faq            a formated (TeX, dvi, ps, ascii)
                a sheet on DOWNLOADING  installation guide that goes into
                several other pages     depth and covers _every_ aspect
                ownership of main FAQ   of installation and starting
                (no extra information   up a Linux system.
                there though...)

FAQ             with "SLS" appearing

                note: does this really
                belong in the main
                FAQ when it is in
                the install docs?

installation    read the documentation  in addition to the documentation,
procedure       and sparse comments     this is a dummy-proof and mistake-
                not totally automated,  proof procedure that asks before
                but almost there in     it does and confirms along the
                the new version.        way as you install with LONG
                                        paragraph-sized comments.

                corresponds to MCC)     extra packages)
                14 disks

(after putting
it on disk)

popularity      undeserving, the        low, but higher among more
                de-facto standard???    experienced users.

who makes it?   Softlanding Software    Manchester Computing Center (sp?)

age of          old.  Emacs-18.59       new.  Emacs-19.15
software        gzip 1.0.x              gzip 1.2.3
                old tar 1.1             recent on just about everything

========================================================================

I'll put it like this, if you have any amount of experience with Unix
or even a good amount of experience with computers in general, use the
MCC installation, it is a blessing.  If you don't and you feel that
you can do SLS easier, install it, play with Linux for a week or two,
and THEN install MCC.  You'll be happier if you do.

Please don't flame me.  I've installed Linux a (small) number of times
on several systems and I doubt that I'll touch SLS again.

I truly wish that the Linux community would give the MCC-interim
package the spotlight that it deserves (and perhaps a piece of the FAQ
the size of SLS's chunk!).

The only drawback to using MCC is that it lacks a X-windows
installation.  If you doubt that you can handle installing X on your
own, maybe SLS is for you.  Then again, maybe not.

I'm at the university know so I cannot test it but I said that commands in
backquotes only gave troubles when running from crond or init, not from
the command line. Somebody suggested it had something to do with
controlling tty's.

INN 1.4 is IMHO the state of the art package for processing news, even for
small systems like mine (UUCP only, 40Mb news spool). The built-in
overview support is also very good and extremely easy to add.

That would be very nice. I now feel even more urged to update my `INN 1.4
for Linux' package with some patches for bash 1.12. The only problem with
using INN on Linux is the absence of a real Bourne shell. I'm now looking
into the NetBSD ash shell, but that one has some problems under Linux too.

Subject: The Daily Posting - what to do with it ?
Date: Fri, 13 Aug 1993 00:37:27 GMT

Now that the group has split the daily posting I have been sending out
for the past n months needs reconsideration.

My position at the moment is as follows, but I'd like some feedback
here (comp.os.linux.misc) and discussion on this.  In the meantime
I've turned the daily off.

1. I don't expect that col.development and col.misc will need a daily.
I hope not, anyway.  If they do we can cross that bridge later.

2. col.help is almost certain to need one - pretty much along the same
lines as the current one, I should imagine.  Should I wait to see what
develops or start posting immediately ?

3. c.o.l probably needs a regular posting reminding people to switch
to the new groups.  Matt - are you handling that, or shall I crib from
your announcements in cola and add another line to my crontab ?

4. The Supersedes line.  About two weeks ago I stopped putting a
Supersedes line in the daily, as I got the impression that a
significant number of people were subscribing to c.o.l, reading the
first few (hundred!) articles in the backlog, and then giving up and
posting.  Many newsreaders (especially primitive ones which are more
likely to make them give up quickly) will show the articles
(more-or-less) in order, and thus they never see the daily.

Is this happening ?  If it is, is it worth the extra disk space (3K *
expiry time) and time skipping (if you don't have a killfile) ?

5. I really don't know what to do about col.admin.  I argued and voted
against it because I felt it was too ill-defined; unfortunately the
situation being what it was any group on the CFV was almost certain to
pass.

If someone can come up with a clear, short rule that I can write down
which a poster can use to determine whether col.misc, .admin or .help
is the right group I'd be interested to hear their ideas.

6. Remember that the daily has to be kept short.  It's already a bit
on the long side; I don't want to add more material - on the contrary,
I'd like to remove some.  I don't know what, though :-).

All comments and advice - here, or by email - gratefully received.

Followups redirected out of comp.os.linux - at last there is a
newsgroup where this discussion won't get swamped.
