That's easy! Read the source code until you find out. And besides,
real hackers never have to delete lines in vi. They always write everything
*perfectly* the first time. Don't you? HACKERS RULE!!!!!!

Subject: Re: How is Linux/X performance in 8MB?
Date: 4 Dec 93 20:47:18

I have a Linux box with 8M of memory and a 386DX40 and run X most
of the time.

I can confirm some of the other impressions that have already
been posted.  Performance is fine for normal tasks like shell
commands and editing with Emacs 19.  Things definitely slow down
when running compiles with GCC, but typically the compiles don't
swap much once the compilation has pushed enough things out of
memory.

XV uses a lot of memory, especially for large pictures, and can
be slow.  I am not doing a lot of image processing so I just use
XV to look at GIFs and JPEGs once in a while.

I am probably going to upgrade to 16 or 20M within the next month
or two (assuming that SIMM prices continue to drop back to
normal) but unless you are really impatient you will probably not
have much trouble with running X in 8M.  You may be pushing the
limits of 8M with your applications, though.

I am only gradually getting over the euphoria of having my own
Unix box and X workstation at home; probably when I upgrade my
system with 20M and a 486DX2/66 I will wonder how I got along
with what I have now.

Dear me, someone's a bit trigger happy.  I guess you had a pocketful
of sarcasm and just *had* to use it up.

The contention that Linux is well documented because source is available
obviously doesn't work very well for non-programmers, but there is
still a valid point in there: if the documentation for HP-UX isn't
good enough, you're out of luck.  If the docs for Linux aren't up to
snuff, you can always get the information you need from reading the
source.

There are enough flamewars over real issues; please don't lower the
already abysmal signal:noise ratio on this hierarchy.

As we in the un*x world know, better does not necessarily mean

well, i did go overboard with "the" essential..there's certainly
other needed docs. i didnt mean only source was needed. but it 
is the most needed documentation, imo.

yes, i'd probably say that too. if you just want to drive it or
even do simple repairs, no docs are needed. or at any rate, nothing
specific to the particular car model. 

>I can only reiterate Magnus' proposal that the Linux Consortium is not
>targeted at hackers like you who read source instead of the man page.

i've never written a C program in my life and only read source when i
need to. metafont is the only language i claim to know, and little 
knowledge of that. but even as ignorant as i am about programming, i've
found programs (xdvi, tex) that had "bugs" that i could fix since the source
was available. 
 actually, i now read source when i dont need to..having it available,
one finds that one can find useful info browsing around mostly 
incomprehensible stuff. 
 in the language i use, i find Knuth's "The METAFONTbook" far, far
more useful than "METAFONT: The Program." Nonetheless, if only one
of the two books could exist, i'd certainly say the program book is
more important.

the btw is short for "by the way" which means different topic. i don't
see any point at all in asking the `novice user' such a question. i 
was just wondering since -Wall shows many warnings with lots of
software, was the lack of warnings due to the rigors of kernel writing
or Linus's skill and care?

>I rest my case.

i also answer questions (on how to use windows and mac programs)
from users who don't know what a compiler is. in my experience,
they do not (and will not) read ANY documentation.

One problem here, not every single person in the world has access to email!
I personally like the idea of such a consortium, because it would give linux
a 'legitamacy' that would make it attractive to businesses, people who don't
have access to the net, and therefor can't get all the free and PD info from
the newsgroups and the like about linux, etc... etc...

The other alternative, is to let linux remain an OS for the experienced, and
only allow (or support, or whatever) people who know what they are doing, 
or have the resources/time/ability to learn, use it.  While I wouldn't have
a problem with that as well, that would keep linux in the position of
being a curiosity more than anything, something people will look at and say
'that's nice'.  Our school was looking at a free *nix OS for a while for
some of our machines, and decided to go with NetBSD, because of it's connection
w/BSD, they felt that gave it a better 'reputation' etc...

So, then my suggestion to the LC, 'rate' packages, as being suitable for
delphi users, suitable for novices, suitable for experts, suitable for hackers,
suitable for S&M enthusiasts, whatever...

Right On! That Brother Is IN THERE!! Forget the friggin' manual! Just push

Too bad he wasn't serious.. I agree with what he said. If you really have to 
have manuals, IBM sells a wonderful unix with 26 volumes of manuals.. I think
its only about $3000 for a single user license.. 'tho it only runs on IBM

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.

We don't seem to be getting past that same point. Your use of *you* in
your last sentence only applies to the programmers I've been being so
snide about. And a *real* hacker just needs adb and unstripped
executables, not ASCII source, come to think of it. Please, let's keep
discussion of the LC on track with respect to *novice* support -- that
is the whole idea, after all.

Snide sarcasm is a legitimate rhetorical instrument when reasonable
