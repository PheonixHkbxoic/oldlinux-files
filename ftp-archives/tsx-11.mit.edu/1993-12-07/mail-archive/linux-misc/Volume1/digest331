Hi,

Third release of inane waffle from the UK on the subject of LGX. 

The manual states that you can log into yggdrasil.com as guest and browse
the current list of trouble reports - has anyone actually managed to do
this ?? 

The closest I can get is anonymous ftp to ftp.netcom.com : /pub/yggdrasil, 
where there appear to be no trouble reports.

--

This is a document that attempts to list some of the problems associated
with the Yggdrasil Fall 93 CD-ROM of LGX. The list assumes that you have 
successfully managed to install the LGX onto your system and that you are 
reasonably well versed in the ways of Unix.

Please note that I have not been able to test all the suggested fixes as
my Linux machine is a stand-alone box not connected to the net and I do not 
use some of the more exotic features available - no news/mail. So all fixes
should be thought about carefully before they are implemented. If you are
in any doubt and your use of LGX is not impacted by a particular problem
then remember the phrase 'Why fix that which works ?' If you do make a major
mistake don't worry as you can simply mount your LGX CD-ROM and retrieve 
any files you may require. This last point does not imply that you can
apply the fixes blindly without thinking about them first.

I currently have two versions of LGX on my machine : a complete installation
and a cd_dependent installation. Wherever possible I have investigated the
reported bugs on both installations.

I hope this list is useful to someone.

Any questions, corrections and comments can be directed to me via email at
'twod@socrates.demon.co.uk'.

Thanks

Ian Parkin

Wrong Permissions :-
=================

[01] : chmod 4755 /usr/X386/bin/Xs3 - To allow non-root users to use this 
                                        server.

[02] : If you opt for the runtime installation many directories are incorrectly
        installed as world writable. This appears to be a fault with the
        installation script as the permissions on the CD-ROM and for the 
        complete installation are correct. The below lists the directories and
        is a simple shell script fix. Note I assume all directories are chmod
        755 and owned by root.

[03] : If you opt for the cd_dependent installation the /usr, /usr/lib and
        /usr/lib/smail are world writable.

[04] :  mail cannot update a users mailbox without /usr/spool/mail being 
        world writable. 

        [ Two schools of thought on this one :
          1 :-  As root 'chmod 1777 /usr/spool/mail'. Setting the sticky bit 
                will ensure that only the owner of a mail file can alter it. 
                smail correctly sets the mail as the relevant owner.group 
                with chmod 600. 
          2 :- Recompile mail using the sources provided specifying /tmp as
                the lock directory ]

[05] : Several UUCP programs are installed with incorrect permissions.

        chown uucp /usr/bin/kermit ]

[06] : chmod 4755 /usr/bin/login.


Non-Running or Problematic Software :-
===================================

[01] : /usr/lib/keytables - Both the UK and Finnish maps appear to be corrupt
        in that they do not map all the keys correctly.
        [ IAP : Installed Slackware loadkeys & uk.map and produced a map file
          using dumpkeys which then works OK ]

[02] : Asteroids does not operate correctly :

        >it just doesn't accept input.  This is because asteroids doesn't do a 
        > XGrabKeyboard, and anything you type gets sent to the root window.  
        > Watching the rocks fly around is interesting, but I'd rather use 
        > xfishtank for mobile wallpaper.

        > The readme for asteroids says that it should be started in a special
        > fashion, which the .fvwmrc doesn't do.  Also, when running asteroids

        Using twm as my window manager I can use asteroids from any xterm.
        Upon entering 'asteroids' I am prompted to put my mouse in the current
        window and hit return. Keys are basically the cursor keys, space, 
        enter, q, h, p and s.

[03] : /usr/bin/X11/xfilemanager core dumps

[04] : /usr/bin/calshell core dumps

[05] : /usr/bin/inews core dumps

[06] : /usr/bin/top suffers from a 'floating point exception' resulting in
        it's immediate demise.
        [ I use the Slackware port of top ]

[07] : /bin/pax - What does it do ? Try ''pax +help'', as suggested by pax 
        itself, only to receive the same error message indicating you should
        try ''pax +help''.

[08] : /usr/bin/script is problematic when starting. More often than not I
        see :-

        # script
        Script started, file is typescript
        Script done, file is typescript

        i.e. the script has finished immediately. 

        Even recompiling the supplied source code does not cure this problem.

[09] : /usr/bin/chsh. I cannot change my login shell to any of the listed
        shells as they cannot be found, despite the fact that they exist. 
        Also when prompted for a numeric value, representing a shell, try 
        entering 'q'. Again compiling the source file does not help

[10] : It has been reported that /usr/bin/minicom core dumps.

[11] : /bin/makehole core dumps


The Editors :-
===========

[01] : emacs & vi do not use the cursor keys.  
        [ Set ${TERM} to vt100 ]

[02] : 'lemacs -nw <file>' causes a segmentation fault. This occurs both when
        running X and not.
        [ Use emacs - Other solutions ?? ]

[03] : Using the 'Unix Manual...' option on the 'HELP' menu within lemacs
        appears not to work correctly. All the Unix commands I tried gave
        'No entries for <command>'. Using the 'setenv' function to set the
        ${MANPATH} variable then causes lemacs to freeze. This also occurs
        when MANPATH=`/usr/bin/manpath 2>/dev/null` is used in my .profile.
        [ Use emacs - Other solutions ?? ]

[04] : If you run lemacs in the foreground ( i.e. type 'lemacs <file>' ) from 
        the command line in a xterm it is not possible to interrupt the process
        using ^Z.
        [ Use emacs  - Other solutions ?? ]

[05] : vi (elvis) dies in an interesting fashion when reading a large file
        (4.1MB) giving the message 'File too big. Limit is approx 2048 
        kilobytes'.
        [ Either recompile the supplied source specifying a greater BLKSIZE
        in config.h or use emacs. ]

[05] : /dev/MAKEDEV creates SCSI CD-ROM's ( /dev/scd* ) as character-mode
        devices instead of block-mode. 
        [ Alter the 'c 11' to 'b 11' on line 261 of the script. ]

[06] : It has been reported that when using emacs in TeX mode that it uses
        'lpr -d' to print a .dvi file, which does not work. The contributor 
        suggested either making emacs use dvips rather than lpr -d, or make
        lpr -d call dvips.
        [ 'grep "lpr -d" /usr/lib/emacs/19.19/lisp/*' will show where the
        default uses of 'lpr -d' are set for the emacs editor. Changes can 
        either be altered here or in your own local .emacs file ]
        

The Kernel :-
==========

[01] : There are been various post regarding the kernel. Yggdrasil does claim 
        it to be 0.99.13 but it appears not to be judging, by the sources.
        I tried for several days to get the kernel to compile, before giving up
        and replacing the LGX kernel structure with the latest source from 
        tsx-11.mit.edu. This has enabled me to build my own kernel that is 
        smaller and loads a lot faster then the Yggdrasil kernel.

Below are some of the points raised :

> The directory /usr/include/linux should be a symbolic link but isn't.
> Linux header files are duplicated, one set under /usr/include other
> under /usr/src/linux/include.

> The proc filesystem sources don't get installed.

> The LGX linux header files are different (and incompatible) with the
> pl13 kernel sources on sunsite.unc.edu.

> You can't rebuild the LGX kernel sources without in2000 support.

> You can't rebuild the LGX kernel sources without sound-blaster cd-rom
> support.

> The install program didn't copy some files.  Do a mkdir 
> /usr/src/linux/fs/proc and copy the files off the cdrom from the same 
> directory into the newly made directory.

> It seems that I've had to change way too many source files to get the
> thing to compile.  It's starting to smell like I've got source files
> from mixed patch levels or something like that.

> I think I'll start over with the 0.99.13 sources from sunsite.

[02] : If you have an UltraStor you need to set it's port (mailbox) to 230 
        or LILO hangs.

[03] : It has been reported that after installing the runtime distribution
        the boot-disk that is created doesn't work. 

[04] : Using a boot disk created during the cd_dependent installation the
        following was encountered :

        # ls -ltR / | gzip -9 > ~/file_list.gz
        Unable to handle kernel paging request at address c0000000
        Oops: 0000
        EIP:    0010:00159c3e
        EFLAGS: 00010206
        eax: 0075786c   ebx: 00000040   ecx: 00000000   edx: 00000000
        esi: 00757620   edi: 00010f80   ebp: 006f3f98
        ds: 0018   es: 0018   fs: 002b   gs: 002b
        Pid: 46, process nr: 7
        0f b7 32 8b 18 50 e8 23 19 fc
        58     551    4096
        Segmentation fault

        I suspect that this is a problem with memory rather than with the
        kernel itself as the following works 'ls -ltr / > ~/file_list;
        gzip -9 ~/file_list'. Be aware that the use of pipes in command
        lines may suffer from this problem. I found this problem on a 
        machine with 8M of RAM and no swap. Adding a 16M swap partition
        removed the verbose error text but still resulted in a segmentation
        fault.

[05] : It has been reported that the supplied kernel does not correctly
        recognise SoundBlaster16ASP boards - it identifies them as the non-
        pro SB board. The contributor recompiled the kernel, removing un-
        required SCSI support, which cured this problem.


Missing Files :-
=============

[01] : If you opt for the runtime installation the file /usr/bin/ranlib is not
        installed. This file is installed in the complete installation.
        [ Copy the file manually ]

[02] :  Man pages exist for certain commands, but the commands themselves do
        not exist :- answer autoreply bpe cccp checkalias cpp1 ezview fastmail 
        frm gen-index jetpack lcasep listalias mkfnames mkmanifest mtools 
        newalias newmail news-recovery newslog nntpxmit nptx othello pathproc 
        pfdisk printmail psc rcsclean rcsfile rcsfreeze readmsg rstat_svc sc 
        subst sxpm tkdrop tkfb ugidd wnewmail xdtm xjewel xless xmahjongg xmenu.
        [ The above is a list compiled by a few quick & dirty shell scripts,
        so may not be 100% accurate ]

[03] : Missing manual pages : dvicopy dvilj2p dvp zsh
        [ In many cases the manual pages can be retrieved from the supplied 
        source code ]

[04] : The fonts installed for ghostscript-2.6.1 are from the
        ghostscript-2.5.2 package, so a number of those listed in Fontmap
        (Nimbus, URWAntiquaT, URWGroteskT) are not available.

[05] : If you opt for the cd_dependent installation the /var/xconfig directory
        is not installed and thus you cannot run X.
        [ Create the directory and link/create the Xconfig and X files ]

[06] :  If you opt for the runtime installation the /usr/lib/manpath.config 
        needed to be manually copied from the CD.  

[07] : If you opt for the runtime installation /etc/inetd.conf expects 
        smtpd to be in  /usr/net/daemons/smtpd but it gets installed to
        /usr/bin/smtpd.
        [ Copy or link the file to the correct directory ]


[08] : bibtex - The .bst files are missing in both /usr/Tex and the supplied
        source.


The Andrew System :-
=================

[01] :  It has been reported that the ez demo scripts do not work correctly 
        unless the environmental variable ${ANDREWDIR} is set to /usr/andrew.

[02] : The help program sometimes cannot read the man pages for two different 
        reasons: 

        A) some machines have gnuzip compressed man pages and other don't. 
        The full pathnames of the man pages are stored in index files
        located in /usr/andrew/lib/help.index.  This means that if your man
        pages aren't compressed, help won't find them. 

        B) Even if the help indices are correct for a given machine, help
        can't deal with gnuzip'ed man pages.
        [ Remedied in next release ]  

[03] : The messages program does not recognize any userid in the To: field.
        [ Remedied in the next release ] 


CD-ROM :-
======

[01] : When using the cd_dependent installation the LGX CD-ROM is not seen by
        either df or mount.
        [ This is due to the installation script copying a special init file
        to /etc which then 'fools' the two commands mentioned. It would be
        possible to make the equivalent of boot/root disks on your minimal
        partition in order to use the normal /etc/init and mount the CD-ROM as
        a separate fs. Possible, but impractical IMHO ]

[02] : It is possible to lock a mounted CD-ROM when a user process accesses it 
        for reading.
        [ The contributor supplied example code for this - see Appendix A ]


[03] : The CD-ROM has the source code for many commands that do not appear as 
        executables on LGX. 
        [ I have a gzipped 'find <cd_mount> -print' listing of the CD-ROM that
                I scan for any files I may require before ftping. ]


X Windows :-
=========

[01] : If you opt for the runtime installation not all of the X libraries in
        /usr/X386/lib are installed. They are correctly installed for the
        complete installation.

[02] : The xview library is broken. It is missing misc/gettext.c for starters.

[03] : The version of ldd is 1.1. Free-2.0 requires version 1.3. So if you 
        intend to port Free-2.0 make sure you get ldd 1.3 as well.

[04] : The standard .fvwmrc assumes that the games directory is available in 
        ${PATH}. It doesn't appear to be, and some of the games will not start.
        [ Add /usr/games/bin to your ${PATH} environmental variable ]

[05] : Resizing a window (fvwm window manager) causes vi (if running) to be
        terminated. Also occurs using twm under XFree-2.0.
        [ emacs allows resizing ]

[06] : The default .fvwmrc has entries for "olwm" and "olvwm" which doesn't
        appear to be in the appropriate path.

[07] : The Xs3 server does not recognise the compressed fonts. This is dealt
        with in the Errata section of the LGX booklet. This caused me a
        minor inconvenience as I was forced to use the XF86_MONO server on
        my cd_dependent installation.

[08] : It has been reported that running lemacs under the Xs3 server with a
        chipset of 'generic' declared in the Xconfig causes the lemacs process
        to freeze without the editor appearing. I myself run the Xs3 server
        and have no problem with running lemacs. I could however recreate this 
        problem using a cd_dependent installation and the XF86_MONO server.
        [ Use emacs ]

[09] : It has been reported that xconq will not run as the correct fonts are
        missing.
        [ I can run xconq with a few warnings about fonts ending with the
                message 'Substituting another font...' ]


Miscellaneous Problems :-
======================

[01] : The rc.local file plays some music. If there is no sound board installed
        then the PC's speaker is used. This has caused at least one machine to
        lock up. 
        [ Comment out or delete the relevant lines in the /etc/rc.local file. ]

[02] : Both the booklet & CD-ROM both state a minimum RAM requirement of 4 MB.
        This is the minimum required for gcc, and is below the minimum of 8 MB
        that is recommended in order to run X. Although not a problem this
        could be misleading.

[03] : There is a /usr/bin/rogue.exp file but no rogue :-(.

[04] : Some manual pages are in the incorrect format or the man command is
        not expecting all possible formats :-

        # man modf
        syntax error near `(d'
        -c:1: `(cd /usr/man ; /usr/bin/gtbl e (david@prism.demon.co.uk)'

        [ nroff -man ./modf.3 > /tmp/modf; mv /tmp/modf ./modf.3 ]
        
[05] : /usr/bin/robohunt expects /usr/games/fortune to exist. It doesn't. 

[06] : The user guest is gid 0 in /etc/passwd.

[07] : The Linux FAQ is stored both in it's entirety and split into 6 parts 
        thus wasting disk space.

[08] : The booklet contains typos and the table of contents lists a different 
        chapter 12 than actually appears. 

[09] : Occasionally the console gets into a mode where the keyboard does not
        autorepeat.

[10] : The type of links used in the / directory have caused me problems and
        IMHO are 'unsound'. I have a complete installation on /dev/sda1 and
        a cd_dependent installation on /dev/sda3. When I boot using /dev/sda1
        and mount /dev/sda3 on /mnt I am unable to access /mnt/tmp as it is
        a soft link to /var/tmp. This should only be a problem if you have
        LGX installations on more than 1 partition.
        [ Delete and recreate all such links in / using ./ ( i.e. rm ./tmp;
        ln -s ./var/tmp ./tmp ) ]

[11] : less expects less.hlp to be in /usr/lib/less/less.hlp.
        [ Either recompile the supplied sources and alter the #define HELPFILE 
        to /usr/lib/less.hlp or 'mkdir /usr/lib/less; ln -s /usr/lib/less.hlp
        /usr/lib/less/less.hlp ]

[12] : It has been reported that CTRL-ALT-DEL does not reboot in the runtime
        installation.
        [ This works as expected on my complete installation ]

[13] : The /etc/wtmp file is not truncated/pruned by the rc file, whilst the 
        /etc/utmp file is.
        [ Add '/bin/echo -n > /etc/wtmp' to the /etc/rc file to truncate the 
        file ]

[14] : Many of the executables in the bin directories ( /bin, /usr/bin etc )
        are not stripped. Some disk space can be saved by stripping them.
        [ See the manual page for strip and be *very* careful what you strip.
        Ordinary command such as chown, chmod, etc should be OK but I suspect
        stripping things such as shared libraries, etc could lead to problems ]

[15] : The versions of mkfs.ext2, fdisk and lilo are fairly old. Problems may
        be encountered with certain hard disk sizes/geometries.

Below is a uuencoded tar file that contains the following :-

-rw-r--r-- epi/900         575 Nov  8 23:20 1993 comprtest/mypick.c
-rw-r--r-- epi/900          27 Nov  9 00:09 1993 comprtest/bsz.h
-rw-r--r-- epi/900          64 Nov  8 10:11 1993 comprtest/Makefile

Edit the mypick.c file to reflect your CD-ROM device and make mypick.

On VC1 mount the LGX CD-ROM and type 'find <mount_point> -print'.

From VC2 run the following :-
while :
do
   mypick 1 | gzip -9 | wc
done

This should then lock the find process. If you run the test in the reverse
order ( i.e. start the mypick process first ) neither process locks. The find
process has a status of 'D - Uninterruptable sleep' and cannot be killed.

Reversing the order of the test ( i.e. start the mypick loop first ) does not
cause this problem.

Tested on Mitsumi and Toshiba CD-Rom systems.

This did not occur on a O'Reilly Unix Power Tools Disk which is also iso9660.

I wrote a letter to SunWorld about this, offering to write an objective
article covering Linux. I expect my letter will be printed but I haven't
been asked to write the Linux article.

My biggest objection to the sidebar on Linux is that it implied that
SLS was Linux and Yggdrasil was Linux on CD-ROM.  It gave no feeling
for the spirit (for lack of a better word) of Linux nor did it explain
how SLS and Yggdrasil fit into the whole Linux picture.

Considering that I payed for 6 CDs sometime in March/May and have only 
received one CD since then I would have to strongly advise against buying 
the JANA CD. They have improved consideribly lately (now they answer their
email; for a while they seemed to have dropped off the face of the earth).
Could have been worse. They also offered a two year subscription.

If you're looking to get the lastes releases of a particular distribution
CD rom is not the way to go. There is always an additional delay. If you're
constantly going thru your stack of floppies looking for that utility
that you downloaded a while back but never quite got around to install
CDs are great.
