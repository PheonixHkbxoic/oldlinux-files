Subject: g++ resource requirements
Date: Fri, 5 Nov 1993 02:56:58 GMT


I wonder whether 8MB of RAM is not sufficient to compile a simple
C++ code (50 line) with the use of streams, strings and some math.

I have compiled a one statement program ("Hello Word" type), so g++
works on my machine. However, all resources are devoured when
compiling a bit larger programs and the disk is thrashing
constantly. I waited 10-15 minutes before kill the compilation.

Is g++ really so resource hungry or it is something else?

I am using the 2.4.5 version and do not have any problems with gcc.
My environment: 1 console, X with fvwm, rxvt and rclock. More than
5 MB of memory is available (as reported by "top").

Well, first off, if I remember correctly, DEC ALPHA's come with OSF/1,
not ULTRIX (I heard you can also get VMS (blech!) with it if you want
(?)). Second of all, if it were a contest betweem ULTRIX and Linux,
Linux would win hands down. So would almost any other OS though.
ULTRIX just plain _SUCKS_! I don't know about OSF/1, I heard it might
be decent, but still Linux's free source, and efficient, clean, non
BSD/SysV infected (hence relatively free of cruft), make it the OS of
choice, IMO.

If you are talking about the early Hurd architecture paper, yes I read it.

I used to think that a microkernel would allow easy development with only a
slight loss in performance.  I now know that the hard parts of driver
development are the "thinking" and "actually writing it" phases, not the
"putting it into the kernel" part.  Add to this the evidence that microkernels
are significantly slower than monolithic kernels, and microkernels don't make
a lot of sense.

You sound as if you are advocating that development be done in private, only
releasing the perfected final product.  I think The Net has changed the way
large system development can be done: we now have the freedom to let
widespread groups work together on a project.

[[ Fade in AT&T advertisement music... ]]

Have you ever worked until late at night, put the resulting alpha software in
a public location, and then read a bug report and suggested fix from halfway
around the world using the bedside laptop the next morning?  I have.


The point here is that having people wait for neat new vaporware isn't nearly
as useful as having people use and improve something that's really pretty much
as useful as that neat new idea.  I'll repeat the oft-used example of the BSD
shared library implementation: early-on the BSD supporters ridiculed the Linux
single-version shared library implementation and proudly stated that BSD would
have a far superior shared library implementation.  Later the Linux
jump-table library was released.  The BSD people claimed that it was all a
time-wasting mistake, and that Linux would be stuck with something inferior to
BSD's _dynamic_ shared libraries (coming RSN).  Today Linux has
dynamically-linked shared libraries.  The last I heard the BSD crowd was
thinking of using the Linux implementation.

I think this is a close analog to the Hurd vs. Linux issue.  The GNU project
made a mistake when it rejected Linux as an ugly step-sister.  (hmmm, gotta
watch those mixed metaphors.)  I see a future where people say "GNU? I've
think I've heard of that -- isn't it the name of the Linux license?"

It works for me, but it is very slow. Much slower than the svga-

If you have more memory, wouldn't that give you more font and bitmap
caching ability?  I also have a 801 with 1MB and I wonder how much
adding another 1MB will impact performance.  I'm not interested in high
resolution since my monitor can't handle it anyway.  But if the memory
can be used for backing-store or more efficient caching then it might be
worth it to get it.

As far as I know, DEC plans to place Alpha in the high end PC-market.
There
is a new Alpha with PCI interface on-chip just coming out. I think if you
can
afford Pentium now, you will be able to buy Alpha next year. Just IMO.

   I know Hurd isn't just a name. It's good to be innovative but you don't
   have to bring all the innovations at once. You can start from a
   single-server and divide the functionnality between several servers later.
   In the process you can also add new functionnality. You wouldn't have
   started from scratch if you had ported Linux or some other free OS to Mach
   and started from there instead of what you did.

A judgement call here had to be made, and, in my technical judgement,
too much time would have been spent making that single-server that all
(in the long run) would become unused code.  At the time it seemed
likely that CMU would produce and release bsdss.  They did so, but
quickly stopped distribution thanks to the USL lawsuit.  Now work is
once again moving (I think) on bsdss.  Modulo the lawsuit, this would
have provided a single server for people who wanted one without taking
our time to produce it.

As for incrementally pulling things out of a single server, it sounds
like a nice idea, but it actually doesn't work too well.

   : It's the problem not with bsdss but with the other single-servers.

   : (There have been volunteers, incidentally, who have time, equipment,

   OK then I was wrong, the picture is: bsdss is unstable and the other BSD

That's right.

   : However: the FSF's goals are not self-aggrandizement.  Linux being out
   : is a Good Thing for the FSF, not the other way around.  So, whether
   : there is a free OS from the FSF or not, the FSF's goals are helped by
   : there being a free OS.  

   Like I said in an other message (posted in an other thread), whether we
   like it or not there will be a contest between Hurd and Linux when Hurd
   will come out. I know the FSF don't seek self-aggrandizement, but it
   nevertheless has some influence over free software development.  

Of course there will be a contest.  May the best OS win!  But, keep in
mind that unlike traditional contests, all three OS's will be learning
from each other and directly borrowing code.  This will be a Good
Thing, not a Bad Thing.

Obviously I'd like to see the Hurd "win", because I have some interest
in seeing my work widely used.  But my goals aren't purely selfish,
and if Linux or NetBSD is truly superior to the Hurd, then they should
be used more.

As was pointed out elsewhere, there are other things that are
important from a longer perspective, among them multiprocessors and
distributed systems, things that are very hard with monolithic
kernels.

Try this :
cd /usr/src/linux
make config  ( to select the driver options for the kernel (e.g. scsi)
make clean   ( clear out any old compiler output )
make dep     ( set up dependancies)
make [zImage|zdisk] (these probably are the 2 most used options)

You might also want to edit the Makefile to set defaults for vga or

For the meantime you can run Windows 3.0 in *real* mode from dosemu. But

You can always get one of the following ftp mail servers to ftp the stuff for
you and mail it to you. There are probably lots of others but these are the
only ones I know of. A mail with HELP in the body should generate a mail
back to you with some instructions as to how to use it.

ftpmail@rus.uni-stuttgart.de
ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
ftpmail@grasp.insa-lyon.fr

In addition there are numerous sites which have there own e-mail server
which carry Linux stuff. There is a FAQ somewhere with a list. The one
I use is 'archive-server@Germany.EU.net' which carries a mirror of 'sunsite'
among other things. (Again an e-mail with HELP in it works wonders).

When using these you had better make sure that the your mailer puts a
