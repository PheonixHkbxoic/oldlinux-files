Subject: The hanging of X
Date: Sat, 18 Sep 1993 17:40:36 GMT

I have been having problems with X hanging after an x number of minutes.  This
problem started after I installed my new hard drive and updated my SLS
distribution to 1.03.  I have tried different window managers with no luck.

I am using the XS3 (version 0.0.4... I think) server.

My hardware includes: 486/33, Fareinheit 1280, 8 meg ram, 213 & 420 meg
harddrives (both ide, Linux installed on the second drive)

X use to start up and work great.... I am using the same Xconfig and the only
things that have changed are a newer SLS distribution and a new Hard Drive.

Any ideas?


                                                thanks,

Not only that, but I tried installing the tsx-11 SLS dist once. The C
library was the wrong version (got some error about incorrect jump
tables), which is pretty bad for a system with shared libraries.

The sunsite distribution looks more up to date (and correct), although
'loadkeys' is the wrong version for pl12.

Subject: Q: Serial port Control; need TD signal on so CallerID box will work
Date: 18 Sep 1993 16:54:35 -0400

Hi netters,

Has anyone managed to get the CLASSMATE model 10 to work?

This is a caller ID device, grabbs power from three lines of serial
port.

  TD (Transmit Data)          - the tricky one
  CTS (Clear to Send)         - both of these are on, when simply
  DTR (Data Terminal Ready)     by reading the serial line.
                                ie.  cat /dev/ttyS0

I can't figure out how to turn on the Transmit Data (TD) line, and 
still read characters.  It looks like ioctl isn't implemented in
the kernel, which I assume, the calls to perform this action, would
exist.

I've looked at setserial, and there's no explicit opitions for doing
this.  It may be necessary to hack at the code, which looks like the
most viable option, to me, at this point.

Any thoughts, aspirations, questions/answers?

Well, at least I've found a use for my 286, for now... :-)

Hello,
        I have been using Linux for a while now. Have 3 machines running
99.9 and just decided to upgrade to 99.12 to take advantage of the NET2.
        So I backed up and did a NEW install (NOT a patch) of 99.12
        All went GREAT! All installation was smooth (except for the creation
of a mucked-up fstab).
        Got the net back up and running in less than a few hours, everything
is fine until I went to the NET2-HOWTO.
        NOTHING seems to jive??? There is no /etc/rc.d/rc.inet.1 or 2
nor is there any of the config files referred to in the FAQ.
        Also on this new system there are links like:         /etc -> ./
and all sorts of links to /conf/net which does not exist at all!
        As I said all is well but I am really confused as to the conflicting
info. Is there a "FRESH-INSTALL-FOR-NET2-FAQ" or something somewhere??
        Any help or hints as to what is going on would be greatly appreciated.
                                                        Thanx,
                                                        postmaster@hpacv.com

You need more memory. I had only 8 MB on a 486 DX2-66, and it ran slower than
Windows 2.03 on a 4.77 MHz 8088 (well, almost!).  The processor stats never
went above 30%, and it paged almost continuously. When I added another 8 MB, 
it seemed almost as fast at Windows 3.1 under DOS...

(Microsoft changed their memory requirements from 8 MB to 12 MB before  
releasing NT - a previous beta release claimed that you would only need
8 MB with the production version of NT, but the released production
version states that you need at least 12 MB.)

The 3C579 (Etherlink III EISA) should be configured as an EISA card.  
The IO Base Address (window 0 register 6 bits 4:0) should be 1f,
which selects EISA addressing mode.
Logic outside the ASIC decodes the IO address s000, where s is the slot
number.  I don't think it was documented real well.
Except for its IO Base Address, the '579 should behave EXACTLY like
the '509 (EL3 ISA), and if it doesn't, I want to hear about it
(at my work address).

I will leave it to the Real Programmers to suggest the right hack
to /usr/src/linux/net/inet/3c509.c to take care of the EISA case.

Beware that if you put a '509 in EISA addressing mode by mistake
and save that in the EEPROM, you'll have to use an EISA machine
or the infamous Test Via to get it back to normal,
and it will conflict at IO location 0 which may hang your
ISA machine.  It's not my job to say whether this is a bug or
feature, but I have heard loud and clear that customers don't
like it and I don't think we'll do it that way again.

My understanding of SCSI (which is limited and might not be completely
correct -- how's that for a disclaimer) makes me believe that you should
be able to do it.  The misunderstanding comes in how companies market their
products.  There are 3 types of SCSI-2 - fast SCSI-2, wide SCSI-2, and 
fast & wide SCSI-2.  Fast SCSI-2 is here now, and when most manufacturers
talk about SCSI-2 they really mean fast SCSI-2.  Wide SCSI-2 is just
emerging, and much less common than fast SCSI-2.  Fast & wide SCSI-2 is
the union of both technologies, and still unavailable, I believe. I've never
heard of fast SCSI-1.

A controller that speaks fast SCSI-2 (or wide SCSI-2 or f&w SCSI-2) should
have no trouble speaking to a SCSI device.

For a SPARCstation 10, Sun quotes a transfer rate of 10 MB/sec for fast
SCSI-2, and I think that's about the same number HP gives for their 9000/7XX
workstations.  SCSI-1 transfer rates top out under 5 MB/sec, but that's
highly dependent on architecture.  How an ISA bus would do is unknown to
me.

Anyone else have additions or corrections to this?

Date: Sun, 19 Sep 1993 00:52:32 GMT


    As many people seem to fell that the easiest way to upgrade their
kernel, etc is to reinstall SLS, or Slackware, only to find that they
have new problems, where formerly they had a working system, this
document has been prepared to ease the seeming difficulty of upgrading
the various bits that commonly need upgrading.
    Anyone feeling ambitious, please send any correcetions or additions
you'd like to see in this document.

The Linux Update HOWTO by John Henders <jhenders@wimsey.bc.ca>
Version 0.2 Last Modified 16 Sept 1993
    Updating HOWTO or why it's a dumb idea to completely
reinstall a distribution package just to update your
libraries and kernel.


1.0.0
        Most upgrades for linux involve either the shared
        libraries or the kernel. Very little else changes.
        Binaries tend to run fine on newer versions of the shared
        libraries unless there's been a major version number
        change in the libraries, which happens very infrequently.
        If you want to get an upgraded version of a particular
        binary, for example the new tar 1.11.2, you're better off
        to just get the source for it, and compile it yourself.
        Most utilities compile with little or no effort now under
        linux, and unless you're trying to port something
        completely new to linux, anythging that needed major
        changes will usually be available on one of the linux ftp
        archives. If a package no longer compiles properly, try
        getting in touch with whoever is maintaining it, using the
        Linux Software Map, if necessary to find their mailing
        address. If none of this works, then post to
        comp.linux.help for help.
1.0.1
        To upgrade the kernel can sometimes require new shared
        libraries and even a new version of gcc. It seems best to
        me to start by installing the shared libraries. You should
        make sure that you have the include and link files to
        match the shared libraries you are installing, so anything
        you compile will match the libraries. For example, if you
        install the shared libraries version 4.2.2, then you
        should get the include 4.2.2, the lib 4.2.2 and the
        g++4.2.2 files and install them as well. 

        Unpacking the various bits requires the use of gunzip and
        tar. Almost all new linux packages are compressed with
        GNU's zip, and have either a .gz or .tgz extension. If you
        want to get a newer version of tar such as tar 1.11.2,
        then tar can do everything for you.

1.1.0 Shared Libraries:
        First, unpack the shared libraries in a directory, for
        example /tmp. If they are tarred and gnu zipped, you can
        do this by typing.

        zcat libs.4.2.2.tar.gz | tar -xf - 
            
        This should leave you with two files in /tmp 

        libc.so.4.2.2 and libm.so.4.2.2

        Copy these to /lib, then cd to /lib. Link them in by typing 

        ln -sf libc.so.4.2.2 libc.so.4
            and
        ln -sf libm.so.4.2.2 libm.so.4

            Now you should have your libraries updated to the new ones.
        ****< how to test for this? >****

1.2.0 Headers and Include files:
        Now you can install the include header files and library
        files for the compiler. Copy the archives to /, then cd to
        / and unpack them, by zcat'ing them to tar as above. This
        should put them into /usr/include and /usr/lib. 

        If you are just patching the kernel source you already
        have, copy the patch into /usr/src/linux, which is linked
        to /linux, at least on the SLS install. Then type patch
        <patchfile. Watch the screen output for any errors. If you
        are using an official patch, there shouldn't be any.

1.3.0 Installing:
        This next section covers how to complile the kernel in
        enough detail for the purposes of this article. For a more
        in-depth look, I suggest you look at the Kerenl howto, and
        the gcc faq.

        If you have the kernel source, Uncompress and unpack them.
        Check to see if the tar archive had the symbolic links in
        it to link the kernel tree and the /usr/include tree by
        cd'ing to /usr/include, and typing  ls -l | more. Check
        for a link from asm to /usr/src/linux/include/asm. It will
        look  something like this.

        lrwxrwxrwx  1 root system  24 Aug 27 13:30 asm->../src/linux/
        include/asm/

        There should be a similar one linking linux to
        /usr/src/include/linux

        lrwxrwxrwx   1 root system  26 Aug 27 13:30 linux ->../src/linux/
        include/linux/

1.4.0 Patching:
        Now you are ready to compile the kernel, unless you want
        to add any custom patches. Examples of custom patches
        available are a patch to change the cursor from a blinking
        underline to a solid block. Also there are patches to
        extend floppy disk handling to allow non-standard sector
        and track reading. 

        As well, many people like to have the number lock turned
        off on bootup. This is easily done by cd'ing into
        /usr/linux/kernel/chr_drv and searching keyboard.c for
        #ifdef CONFIG_KBD_META. Before doing this, you might want
        to copy keyboard.c to keyboard.c.bak, so you have a backup
        copy. Then replace the lines that look like this. 

        ***< Matt. I don't have the stock kernel source, so please 
        insert stock lines here.>***

             Replace them with.

        #define KBD_DEFFLAGS ((1 << VC_REPEAT) | (1 << VC_META))
        #else
        #define KBD_DEFFLAGS ((1 << VC_REPEAT))

        Now cd back to /usr/linux. You're ready to start making
        the kernel. Type make config. Answer all the questions
        about how you want to configure your kernel.
         ***< Is there any text file on what the various options
        do, outside of the descriptions in the config script? >***

1.5.0. Making the kernel:
        Now type make depend. When that finishes, you are finally
        ready to make a new kernel. However, you have one more
        thing to do. If you have lilo installed, the makefile will
        back up your old kernel and install the new one with lilo.
        Lilo HAS to be run after a new kernel is installed.
        However, if you have an SLS installation, the kernel image
        is named wrong to work with the makefile script. change
        your kernel name to vmlinuz, assuming you have acompressed
        kernel, which is likely with SLS. Then edit
        /etc/lilo/config to change to image=vmlinuz.

        Now you're ready to go back to /usr/linux and type make
        zlilo. Now in 20 minutes to an hour or so, depending on
        how much memory you have and what processor, you should
        have a new kernel installed, and lilo will have been
        reconfigured to load it.

2.0.0 SUMMARY:
        1) Get the libraries. All should have the same version number.

        2) Install  the link libraries in /lib. Use ln -sf to link
        the libraries to the library pointers.

        3) Install the include and header files.
            a) create links from /usr/include/linux to
            /usr/src/linux/include/linux and from /usr/include/asm
            to /usr/src/linux/include/asm if necessary.  

        4) Install the gcc compiler.

        5) Install the new source tree.
            a) Install any patches you want to the kernel.

        6) make depend; make zlilo (if you use lilo)

        7) done.
