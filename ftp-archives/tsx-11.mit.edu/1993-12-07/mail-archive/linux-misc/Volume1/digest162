Yup, an excellent reason to never bother to change the version number

I think the successful development of the WINE (MS-Windows emulator)
program, Linux will get an amazing boost.  Further development on the DOS
emulator should do the same.  Just think, if WINE works, you could actually
use After Dark!!!  :-)

  I would get Term 1.07 and (assuming you are hooking up to a UNIX box
with Linux), compile it on both ends.  This will allow you to start up
X on Linux and run X programs off the remote system.  I run at 14.4, and it
is acceptable, anything less would be painful to say the least...

  I believe the source for Term is on sunsite--try compiling it.  It was
not too hard to get compiled here, and runs great!

I agree with what andreas said.  The ET4000/w32 is a good chip.  Even if
it work under X as a normal ET4000, it is MUCH faster than the normal
ET4000.  It is a good trade off between the an S3 chip and an slow generic
board.

Under messy-dos and Sloth-windows, it runs fast, as it is accelerated. 
Under X, it runs as a fast ET4000.

Subject: Zero Unix Expo Interest!
Date: Mon, 27 Sep 1993 16:17:39 GMT

Someone in this group mentioned that one way of getting commercial
developers interested in Linux would be to ask these vendours at
Unix Expo for Linux versions of their products.  

Well, I represented a commercial vendour at Unix Expo, and from the
look of recent discussion, a rather interesting one for Linux people.
I was at the Cyclades booth.  Cyclades is an intelligent I/O card
manufacturer.  I also represented Nutec Corp. which is a Unix
software company.  I didn't have a single person stop by the booth
interested in Linux.  Just about every other imaginable Intel-based
Unix was mentioned, including BSD several times.  In fact, BSD had
a booth very close to me.

I think this is one of the reasons that Linux isn't taken extremely
seriously by most companies.  There needs to be higher level interest
before commercial developers will come around.

Hello:

   I'm trying to find out whether anyone has idea for a serial-port
sharing program.  Basically, I have a Linux box connected to a modem
and a PC acting as a terminal.  I would like to be able to access the
modem directly from the terminal, probably by setting up an account
with the shell set as the serial-copying program.  This would allow me
to access the modem from the terminal without having to go through the
intermediate step of starting up a terminal program on the Linux
machine.

   Does anyone have something like this already written?

        How does SLIP really work on Linux? Especially as a server. I would 
like to know what steps are used (i.e. what ioctls, etc) to activate the 
connection, etc. I know about DIP and have looked at the source, but it isn't 
100% clear for me to see what exactly is going on. Specifically, if an 
incoming SLIP packet comes in on the serial line, does the kernel or a user 
mode process pass it on the net or what? What actually handles the escaping 
of END and ESC characters, the kernel or a user mode process?

        I need to know because I want to have a SLIP server that would serve 
telnet encapsulated SLIP packets. (Yeah, I know it is a kludge and a pain, 
but I can handle all the telnet negotiation, etc stuff).

I compiled "/usr/src/keytables/loadkeys" and ran it with the following

 # cd /usr/src/keytables
 # tools/loadkeys maps/dvorak.map

The Dvorak keyboard becomes active and seems to work OK until I press
the Alt key.  When I press the Alt key, Linux outputs a multi-line
error message to the console.  The error message begins with the line

 Unable to handle kernel paging request at address C0000032

At this point, the machine is frozen; Linux doesn't accept any input
from the keyboard.

How can I fix this problem in 'loadkeys'?

Is there a better way to get a Dvorak keyboard?

Another tape-related question: The SLS installation script offers
installation from tape. Is this from QIC-Floppycontroler tape or only
SCSI tape, and how does the installation work ? Just to tar the whole
SLS directory tree onto the tape and then boot from the bootdisk and
say "installation from tape" will hardly do the job, I suppose ?
Do I need a special form of the SLS package, and if so, where can I
get it ?

[ Article crossposted from comp.os.linux.help ]

[ Posted on Mon, 27 Sep 1993 23:25:01 GMT ]


        I installed SLS 1.02 from the new TransAmeritech CDROm this 
weekend. The installation seems to have gone just fine, and I'm able to
mount the system from a floppy boot disk (I'm working on getting
LILO to work with OS/2 boot manager...but that's another post!)
        I've been experiencing this problem with the system arbitrarily 
rebooting for no apparent reason. It generally happens after logging in
 and working with the system for about 15 minutes. It generally happens
after a lot of keyboard input. Then after the system resets, it might
occur again after a shorter period of time. It isn't a hard reset (no 
memory count), and e2fsck doesn't report any damage to the file system
or the disk. 
        Anyone have an idea what the problem might be?

Here's the hardware: Clone 386/40, forex/opti chipset, ami bios, 
16 meg, 128K cache, 2 IDEs on plain vanilla (drive one has OS/2
in a primary partition, linux in another, and OS/2 boot manager in 
the third, second drive is DOS/Windows/OS/2 files systems). Adaptec
1542B runs a Toshiba 3401 cdrom. I/O card with mouse on com1, 
external modem on com2. Soundblaster pro sound card. HP Deskjet on
lp1.

Thanks for any advice.

        Yes, but caveat emptor with the new Trans-Ameritech product.
I ordered one of these disks and it arrived, but my Sony CDU-31A drive
could not read it.  When I called them, they told me that certain drives 
were not able to read the disks and they were negotiating with the disc 
printing company to get some new discs printed.  I opted to wait for a new 
disc at the time, but I haven't heard anything from them since and I'm 
growing rather impatient and will probably cancel my order and get one of 
the cheaper discs that are available now.  So, unless you are willing
to take a chance, now may not be the time to try out the Trans-Ameritech 
product.

file formats including GIF, SUN-raster and FBM. See the FBM 
documentation about which other graphic formats are supported. 
The program requires that the images are mapped and have 8 bit per pixel. 
In contrast to the very popular "DTA" program for MS-DOS the 
quantization of true-color images (eg. POV output images) 
has to be done separately. FBM2FLI simply puts the prepared images 
together. If true-color pictures should be processed, the 
the quantization has to be done before FBM2FLI is called.
For example the quantization can be done by the FBQUANT utility from 
the FBM package. Together with the FBM package it should be possible 
to deal with most of the graphic standards and file formats. 
I have tested FBM2FLI on a PC running Linux and on SUN workstations and
I always used version 1.0 of the FBM package. 

History:
   25-April-93    Initial Release.
   28-May-93      Corrected one bug in fppcolor.c. Now the -m option
                  should work correctly.

How about:

#!/bin/tcsh
mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /whereever_you_mount_your_floppies
cp $argv[1-] /whereever_you_mount_your_floppies
umount /whereever_you_mount_your_floppies 

Or something like this?
