The error message asked me to change a line in /etc/fstab to:

/proc /proc ....etc.

I did that and rebooted, and it didn't work.

I just got XFree86 2.0, and none of the programs work due to the absence of 
the dynamic library ld.so. Where can I find this?

A little cache goes a very long way -- a lot of cache only goes farther if
the server puts it to good use.  Jon provides the current answer:

The large surplus cache is best used for backing store.  This makes a huge
difference in interactive performance for networked machines,
since you don't need to generate expose events and do the screen updates
using network X protocol traffic.  Looking at the sources, it doesn't
look like this is implemented right now in XFree2.0.  The benefit isn't
as big for local-connection clients -- typical useage 
for standalone PC's running local clients.

I recieved the first (may-june) JANA linux CD-ROM. But have not heard
from them since. They don't answer E-mail, or posts to this newsgroup.
Does anyone have their phone number (although I have heard you can't
get through).
Should I spend more money on another linux CD-ROM?
Which of the other venders of CD-ROMs are also fly-by-night?

Thanks again JANA!

To take advantage of this special offer, you must mention this posting
when placing your order with us. Orders may be placed via electronic
mail or you can call us at 800-706-4046, 24 hours a day.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=


Linux is a freely redistributable version of the Unix(tm) Operating System
which runs on 80386 and 80486 PC Compatible machines. This software is
a full version of Unix which contains all the standard utilities and more,
including:

        TCP/IP, SLIP Networking
        C and C++ Compilers and other development tools
        Various Language Translators
        UUCP and Usenet Software
        Several popular editors including GNU Emacs.
        X Windows system.
        DOS Emulator

For your convenience, we now have 24 hour, toll-free ordering 
and can accept both American Express and Optima. Many of our 
customers have requested technical support and we are pleased 
to announce that thirty days of software support via phone and 
email is now included with each order.

The version we distribute is SLS 1.03 which contains the Linux Kernel
version .99 patch level 12. Disk 'A1' is the bootable diskette which 
will bring up Linux and take you through the installation procedure.
A breakdown of the packages contained in this release is as follows:

        Base Release:  Disks A1-A4, B1-B7, C1-C3
        Source Code:   Disk S1

All orders are shipped via second-day, USPS priority mail.

Linux is currently available on many Internet sites including TSX-11.MIT.EDU
and others. We offer this as a service to those who don't have the time
or resources to download such a large distribution. This version can be
installed directly from diskette in about 30 minutes time.

Unless explicitly stated to the contrary, all of Linux is copylefted under
the GNU Public License (GPL). SLS extensions are copyrighted by Softlanding
Systems. You may not claim any part of Linux as your own. This assures

Subject: Another success story.
Date: Fri, 5 Nov 1993 05:46:22 GMT

Well, it's taken a couple of months, but I've finally done it.  Whew!
Some of you may remember that I was working on setting up a BBS based on
Linux boxes, etc.  IT'S ALIVE!  Muahahahah!

The BBS (Island Net) is attached to the Internet 24 hours a day via a
leased line.  I am using PCRoute running on a 386dx/20 as my IP router. 
It connects via SLIP to a NetBlazer somewhere over Courier modems.

I currently have two Linux hosts on the network (all machines are
connected to a thinnet backbone).  The smaller "utility" host is just a
386dx/40.  It has 8 megs of ram, 120 meg IDE drive, 205 meg IDE drive, and
an SMC card.  It is running SLS 1.03 straight.

The second host is the main BBS machine.  It is a 486dx/50 with 16 megs of
ram, Adaptec 1542cf SCSI card, Micropolis 1.2 gig fast SCSI 2 drive, and
(as of tonight) an NEC 84 SCSI CD ROM.  This one has a serial card with 2
16550A's on it and two US Robotics Sporster 14.4 modems attached.  I want
to add a 4 port card soon (likely one of those STB thingies).  This one is
also running SLS 1.03 straight.

The BBS itself is written in M-Script, which is a programming language I
developed just for writing BBS's.  M-Script still needs a _lot_ of work,
but it's doing pretty good so far.

(ASIDE: What's with all these posts about SCSI under Linux being slow? 
Since I replaced my IDE drive with this SCSI one, my disk access is at
least twice as fast.  A search of the entire disk for any particular file
takes a whole 2 seconds - no lie)

Tonight I finished setting up DNS on the main machine - it seems to be
working well.  I've been live on the 'net now for over a week.  All
telnet's/ftp's/etc have worked flawlessly.

All I can say is: WOW! Linus and crew, you've done a tremendous job.  If
you're ever up my way I'll buy you a drink.

I'll be happy to try and answer any questions you might have about my setup.

Cheers!

Mark

You're right. But do you know if the ALPHA PC hardware will be documented
or proprietary? I understand that DEC don't give away too much information

However, porting Linux to others than the sucking Intel architecture would
be a Great Thing but nearly impossible without usable developer's doc.

Well, Mach didn't become a microkernel on one day. According to what I've

the kernel. IMHO, that process should be simillar to going from a
monolithic OS to a single-server then a multiple-server.

That's right, and that's why I think porting Linux to Mach would be a good
thing. Some peole (including myself) are already talking about starting
such a project (maybe it's already started).

I'm running linux on a 386DX/40, and I have DOS/Windows running on another

be able to put almost all of my hard disk space, CD-ROM and tape drive, in
the Linux box, and be able to access it from either machine. for that

Linux, and use Linux's Minicom program instead.

Could someone report his experience with Royal Computer?
I am seriously considering the purchase of their SCSI Pro
package and would like to know if there is something to
beware.  Here is the deal:

  o     486 DX/33  256kb Cache
  o     3-slot VESA
  o     8Mb RAM
  o     DTC SCSI-2 VL-BUS Controller (Linux support ?)
  o     340 Mb SCSI-2 Hard Disk
  o     S3-805 Windows Accelerator (1Mb Max)
  o     15" Flatscreen, 1280x1024 NI (at 65Hz, according to them)
  o     TEAC 5.25" & 3.5" Floppy
  o     Choice of 7Bay tower or desktop
  o     101Key keyboard 
  o     1P 2S 1G port
  o     Windows 3.1, MS-DOS 6.0, Hi-res mouse.


                Total: $ 2060

Upgrade to Orchid Farenheit 1Mb         $100  (better ideas?)
Upgrade to 16Mb                         $400


This seems like a very solid system for a low price.  Is there
anything I should be aware of?  Is this a respectable company?
Is the standard keyboard and mouse OK?  Is the DTC controller 
supported?
