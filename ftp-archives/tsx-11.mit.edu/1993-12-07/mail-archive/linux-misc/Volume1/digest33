Yep, I can easily see that.

And UNIX disk I/O is better than ANY DOS I've seen, even with superturbocache
installed. CC was about 3 times faster under Xenix-86 than Microsoft C (the
same compiler at the time) under PC-DOS... both on an XT.

First a disclaimer.  I think that OS/2 and Linux are both great systems.
I think Linux is a better system in general, but OS/2 has far better DOS
support, and, since DOS support is how I earn my feelthy lucre, I
currently use OS/2.

>>[referring to linux]
>>OS/2 is bigger, slower, and has *less* applications available.  Better?  NO.

OS/2 has X support, and the EMX unix system call emulation library (the
latter available for free) and can thus run nearly all the applications
that Linux can, as well as DOS, Windoze, and OS/2 applications.

As for bigger/slower, if you drop the OO shell, and just keep the window
manager, it's not.  If you drop the window manager as well, it's
*definitely* not (although, unfortunately, you lose most of the
multitasking capabilities at that point--a really stupid design on IBM's
part IMO).

I use gcc, emacs, groff, TeX, less, ghostscript, bash, ckermit, etc.,
all under OS/2.  Many of these compiled (with EMX) from the unmodified
sources.  And I don't even have the X support package.

My biggest complaints about OS/2 are that it's cryptic and labyrinthine,
only supports two filesystems (at the moment) and only one is documented
(though, to give credit where credit is due, that's not IBM's fault),
lacks multiuser facilities, cannot be properly configured without
running the whole damn OO shell.  In those cases where you can configure
it at all.  Badly designed by comparison to Linux (although far superior
to the ubiquitous and brain-dead Windoze).

Linux has more potential; however OS/2 provides what I need right now.

OTOH, OS/2's X support is currently pretty limited, although a new (and
unfortunately more expensive) update has just been announced.

Lets hope that no one makes that erroneous judgement about *either*
system! :-)

However, I suspect that Linux has just as much, if not more, *potential*
to be that "svelte..." &c. system.  We'll see when it comes out of beta. :-)

For most people, a microkernel is going to do more harm than good.  With
a microkernel, filesystems, etc. are split off into separate processes.
This is great for multiprocessors, where you have one thread running on
each processor, but in a uniprocessor, like most of us have, you pay a 
performance penalty because of the context switching overhead.

>>>kernel size                 50k                         350k
>                       Doubt it very much

The 50K figure doesn't include device drivers, filesystems, etc, while
the Linux figure does.  

Besides, that's binary size (ie, code + initialized data only), and has
little relation to the amount of memory used once it's incore.

>>>loadable device
>>>drivers                     yes                         no

Wrong.  loadable device drivers are available for Linux.

>>>max chars in file name      unlimited                   14
>       false$

Recent Linux filesystems (like those on other modern unices) have
a limit of 256 characters *per component*.

>>>max partition size          unlimited                   64MB
>       false

The Linux device drivers support partitions that are several 
terrabytes in size, as does the ext2 filesystem.  Unfortunately,
limitations in the ext2 mkfs program mean that you can't create
a filesystem bigger than 2G.

Unless Microsoft used a "bignums" package for all the internal 
structures (unlikely because of performance concerns), they can't
be unlimited, although they may be for "all practical purposes" 
unlimited as Linux is.

>>>memory model                flat                        internally segmented

This is somewhat misleading - the keyword is "internally".  User processes
see a flat 32 bit address space.

Segmentation inside an operating system is not a bad thing, as it allows 
you to address user and kernel spaces separately, without paying the 
penalty of mapping/copying arguments from one space to the other every
time you wish to access them.

>       No segmentation in NT? wow how do theydo their paging ?$

On the Intel chips, the segmentation handling and MMU are separate.

Linux has been ported to the Amiga.

>>>runs unix apps              yes (source level)          yes (source level)

No.  WindowsNT runs pure POSIX 1003.1 apps only, and makes no attempts to 
address the unix features used by other applications.  Ie, the standard unix
programs that are often piped or shelled to, X11, etc.

>>>runs DOS apps               yes                         no

Linux runs *some* DOS applications under the DOS emulator.

Various CPU's, such as the MIPS R4000, support 64 bit addresses.

I installed Linux on a 2M laptop, and while I wouldn't want to do any 
real work on it beyond text manipulation and telecommunications, it 
ran, so you can consider "2M" the technical minimum for Linux.

As far as realistic configurations, Linux works well, with X (provided that
you've tweaked things properly) and 8M of memory I can do builds without
paging.

>>>min required disk space     60 meg                      120 meg (all series)

This is misleading, since the Linux figure and MS figures include different
things.  If you install the entire SLS distribution, the 90M of disk
that it takes includes things that you probably won't use - fortran and 
pascal to c translators, LISP and BASIC interpreters, etc.   The WinNT
figure is not artificially inflated by these things.

I've run Linux + X11 on 45M of disk, with full development tools including 
on-line documentation, libaries, 'C' / 'C++' compileers, debuggers, etc.
I also ran an earlier versions of Linux in 10M, with compiler.  It all 
depends on what you want, and what you consider a "minimum" system.

>>>price                       $110 (educational)          $69 (SLS)

1.  Linux is available, quite legally, for free if you're willing to 
        copy / download it yourself.

2.  SLS is not the only source of SLS disks.  I've seen other sources
        selling disks for as little as $30 for the set.

That is a litle unfair to W/NT as it stands.  "limited _to_ POSIX subset only"
is fairer (it's POSIX.1 that is limited not W/NT's implementation of it).

Again, I believe this is a little unfair.  A 486 is recommended for W/NT
but it should run on a 386 or 386sx.

My doubt is

I just installed my linux system and i tryed to mount a
linux disk, after the mke2fs command.

But when I mounted the disk I get a message:

kernel does not support xiafs.
How can it be?
After doing a mount (no parameters) the system showed
xiafs disks mounted!

And i can even mount dos disks!

Here both sides seem to be competing for for users. NT as a migration OS for Win users
and Linux for UNIX users. (Linux also seems to be trying to get Win type users
with the X and XView apps.) POINT: Eventually each will have its own niche.

Neither NT nor Linux will be the end all of OS's. The one that helps you get done what you

Ok, so you concur that a strong SHEEP MENTALITY runs among linux
users. Good. That's obvious anyway, nobody can deny it. The way I see
it, linux users can be classified as follows:

0.1%: A handful of people that do the actual linux development and
application writing. Those are descent humen beings, and other than
being fanatics (ALL LINUX USERS ARE!), I can say no ill about them.
Not very competent, but otherwaise hard working. They rarely post or
participate in the linux groups, and are mostly silent.

10%: Regular users. Those also do some occasional reading of the
kernel, but most of what they do is use linux to telecommunicate to
their university computers to run talk and such. Those are also mostly
silent, and rarely post in netnews, they report bugs by email.

1%: Blood suckers. Those use the hard work of the first group to make
money, interpreting the linux license one way when it works for them,
and another when not. Those are rather noisy, not surprising since
they also constitue a large part of the MASTER SHEEP.

88.9%: THE SHEEP. Those rarely use linux beyonfd booting it. They do
all their work in DOS/Windows, but love to brag about how inadequate
it is, and how linux works for them. They know mostly nothing about
linux and whether it wroks or not beyond echoing what the master sheep
say, but are HEFs (Highly Effecient Flamers), and they fill the linux
group with posts that are mostly noise. Of course HEF + SHEEP
MENTALITY = LYNCH MOB!

So here is the breakdown:

           0.1%    developers                   |-- fanatics
           10%     users                        |
           1%      blood suckers |-- LYNCH MOB  |
           88.9%   SHEEP         |              |

I think that's pretty much an accurate and objective breakdown.

For your information, it has been in alpha for over a year. All that

No so. I will say upfront that linux has the best chance among all
unices of surviving (mostly as a toy os). All the commercial ones will
be extinct in a mmater of a few years, due of course to the new unix:
NT. DEC and Silicon Graphics started the trend, and others will follow
soon. In a few years, unix will be mentioned only in history books,
and X11 will be seen only working as a subsystem under NT.

The other free unices? Well, HURD has already stagnated, too late for
it now, and the BSD ones SELF-COMBUSTED.

Now you see how reasonable a guy I am?

What a joke! Linux 1.0 was supposed to be released last summer. In
December, SLS 1.0 was announced, under the impression that linux 1.0
would be released by then. Well, we're still waiting. NT was late?
Hahaha!

Somebody said that and all the sheep kept echoing it! Tell me, can you
load the serial driver at boot time? the SCSI driver? the sound
driver? the HD driver? the Mitsumi driver? *ANY* driver? Of course
some sheep would say you can enable that by recompiling the kernel.
That's loadable alright! Heh.

The current loadable modules project doesn't have the blessings of the
linux developers, it'll never be integrated into the kernel. Larix
tried and failed.

Not a single applicaion running under linux uses drag and drop, unless

WABI is the BIGGEST LIE PERPETRATED ON LINUX USERS!, mostly as a
gimmick to push the declining sales of SLS, which were hurt by clones.
Of course someone said WABI! and all the sheep started repeating WABI!
WABI!! WAAABI!!, and soon they believed it. First of all, WABI is a
Sun *binary* interface. It runs (supposedly) ordinary commercial
Windows apps that were compiled under DOS/Widnows. Linux has no hope
in a million years to have something like this.

All that is under linux is an attempt to make applications written for
Windows use an alternate API library by compiling them under linux and
linking them with that lib. Of course if you ever looked at it, you
would soon find that it's no more than a feable remapping of a few
Windows functions using XView, and will never amount to anything but
running a demo.

[...]

Well, it's getting too long. More later if find the time.

This board is not supported in the stock .99.12 kernel.

From the FAQ : 

QUESTION: What hardware is supported?

ANSWER: The Adaptec 154x, Adaptec 174x, Adaptec 1540 compatable boards like 
the Bustek, DTC3290 and DTC3292, Future Domain 850, 885, 950,
and probably other boards in that series but NOT the 880 board unless
you make the appropriate patch,  16x0,  Seagate ST0x, Ultrastor 14F (Some 
of the new ALPHA code makes attempts to deal with the 34F) and Western 
Digital 7000 are supported (revision 5 only, revision 3 boards don't work).  
Various Adaptec clones from Bustek and Future Domain are known to work, in 
both ISA and EISA flavors.

There is an alpha driver for the Ultrastor 24F, that also works 
for the 14F and 34F : 

        tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/ALPHA/scsi/u24f-driver.tar.z

A bootable image is in the same directory,

I'm looking for  a twisted-pair ethernet card to use with linux on my 486.
The NE2000 card suggested by our computing center here is the
Eagle Anthem NE2000T, 10 Base-T, 16-bit.  Has anyone tried this card
with linux?  Any help is greatly appreciated.

Hi Folks,

Is there any point in getting Linux to reboot itself every day or so?

What are the pro's and cons of doing this.
