The newest versions of a program called screen (3.5.1 or so) can

Why did it take almost 6 years after the Mac was lauched before GUI's
become popular on PC's? Why is WINDOWS still not as good as the Mac
GUI and why after 6 years to get it right has Microsoft not done so? Also
why does Microsoft provide one of the worst API's to develop it in?

The technical and Scientific communities also require GUIs. It is just
that the market is much smaller and money to develop them is hard to
come by. But that's a separate issue.....

I've never heard so much BOL***KS in all my life! 

What tools are you talking about? GUI Builders? There's plenty of them
(I've used UIMX and DevGuide both excellent builders). OPEN LOOK also has 
one  of the easiest API's (XView) there is for any GUI system.

I have used many GUI toolkits over the years including Motif, DEC-Windows, 
Xlib, XIntrinsics, MS-Windows, Amiga Intuition/Gadtools, XView and Mac 
Finder. I believe I can write an OPEN LOOK application as much as 20% faster than I could using either the Motif or MS-WINDOWS APIs.

Currently I'm developing OPEN LOOK applications for process engineering
applications simply because I could develop them faster using XView than I 
could using almost any other API (except probably Nextstep). Doing the things
I want to do could not be accomplished using MS-WINDOWS API.

The OPEN LOOK toolkit is a very well thought out GUI style and has as
much, if not more functionality than Windows.

The main reason why there are more Windows based applications is that
the market see a greater profitability serving the lemmings mentality
of the Windows market. 'No gain without pain' as one Windows programmer 
friend succinctly put it.

>True, polished GUI apps exist under Windows, Windows NT, OS/2,
>the Mac OS and NeXTSTEP.
>

There are polished GUI applications under Motif and OPEN LOOK. You've
just not looked any further than the length of your 'Windows based Word
Processor'.  Take a look at FrameMaker for OPEN LOOK and Motif for
instance.  Also I think Sun's OPEN WINDOWS desktop environment is also
very well designed and is a far better user front end than the
MS-Windows system.  (I wish when Sun move over to the COSE (Motif)
system that they put the OPEN LOOK tools to the public domain.) :-)

Even some public domain applications, like Ftptool and XVnews, are very well designed.  (Is it any co-incidence these are written using XView?) 

Although I do not use Linux or Windows/NT, I find it difficult to see
how you can compare like with like. NT is _supposed_ to be a
'professional' commerically developed operating system while Linux (I
believe) has not had any such pretentions. I suppose it is embarrasing
to Microsoft and their lemmings (sorry, I mean users :-) that a public
domain operating system can be compared so favourably to New Technology
(NOT). When will people realise Microsoft is taking them for a ride,
after 7 versions (and 10 years) of MS-DOS it's still not much better
than CP/M!  With Microsoft being able to take every PC user to the
cleaners for every small improvement to MS-DOS do you think it will not
be any different with Windows or NT upgrades? Take NT, it really has
not been a real big improvement from a _user_ point of view, it still
looks like WINDOWS. To the average user NT only multi-tasks better than
WINDOWS 3.1 (when the user has added the extra 12 Meg that is :-)

I wish Linux every success. Maybe one day I'll port my OPEN LOOK
applications to Linux. The only problem with that is I'd have to
sacific my other bug-bear and buy a PC ;-)

Did you _really_ connect at 14k4 from UUCP ? Your feed may be using a slower
modem than yours !. Furthermore, did you enable v42bis (MNP5) ? While
transfering ASCII this might be a large benefit, on binary (compressed)
data this is not a real improvement (still better than nothing though).

Where did you connect to from DOS ? The same node or someplace else ?

It might even be that you have small packet size enabled on your UUCP (g
protocol with 64 byte packets). This incurs a large overhead and thus
reduces the effective throughput. This overhead might also explain the
amount of CPU used by uucico.

As a followup on my own followup :

I'm using a 14k4 modem at 57k6. It's connected to a linux p12 system with
Taylor 1.04. When using the g protocol to talk to a Waffle 1.65 site I get
an average throughput of 1250 cps (including protocol overhead). This
is for traffic from Waffle to Taylor. While uploading I still have some
problems, I get a WRITE ERROR on different packets.
I'm using 4096 byte packets with a window of 7.

Oh yeh. On one benchmark (seive) Byte was reporting a factor of *11* slow-

How low can we go.  What do you reckon is the bare minimum and cheapest
setup for an XServer only machine, and have you experience of its

Actually, they did. Before they adapted MS-DOS to the IBM-PC, they
ported Unix (System III?) to a (non IBM) 8086 box and called it Xenix.
Later they ported it to IBM-clones as well.

MS Windows interface is not necessarily worse.  I personally prefer it to the
Mac.  For instance I *hate* the way you only have one menu bar on screen,
which means that an application can all but disappear, and then a non-expert
user whinges to me that nothing will run due to insufficient memory...

However, I love the trashcan idea.  There are things in X (like the mouse
cut/paste and the scrollbars), that are infinitely superior to either MSWin or
the Mac.  It's all a matter of personal taste.

Yes, but do you have anything as nice as a Borland IDE?  I agree, XView is free
as are a few other toolkits, but tools of the standard of ease of use of
Borland's compilers tend to be *$%# expensive under Unix.  This is fine for
academic institutions and corporations, but for PC users looking for an OS it
is a major hurdle.  This is one reason I use both MS Windoze and Linux/X on my
PC.

I must admit that so far the MS Windows API is the only one I have tried.  This
is because I use Pascal, and not C, and so far there is no such thing as a
Pascal compiler that will generate X code in any shape or form that I can
find.

One day I'll have to learn C, but time is not available at present.

Porting them shouldn't be a problem.  If you wrote them nicely, just a
recompilation with the Linux XView libraries and you'd be away...

The reason it hasn't (won't?) be done is all that VESA code is sitting in
16-bit real-mode BIOS code on the board, and a 32-bit operating system can't
get at it directly.  As far as I know, the only way to write a "VESA" driver
for a 32-bit OS would be to start a virtual 8086 process which has exclusive
rights to the screen and services all graphics operations.  Between the slow
VESA calls and the context switch to the graphics process (!), I think this
would be too slow to be usable.

I envision an "official" linux installation system that no one really
owns, but it's something everyone can use and documentation can be
based on that. There would be no need for all these competing
distributions.

The idea is to have a simple install program that is able to install
independent software packages. One such package (mandatory) would be
the kernel and boot package, another mandatory package would be the base
operating system utilities. Pretty much all other software packages
would be optional, such as the development tools, X, TeX, etc.

The software packages would be similar to the series disks in the SLS
distribution, but a little more organized and with some ryhme and reason
to whats on them.

These packages would be put together and stored somewhere at one of the
sites and the user can build his own installation distribution by
collecting the packages he/she wants. Perhaps a description file can be
manually or automatically generated to describe what is in the
distribution. Run the install program, select what you want, hit GO, and
let it churn away.

The maintainer of each of the packages can easily build the
installation packages, that way, no one person is responsible for
maintaining an entire distribution.

Just a few thoughts.
