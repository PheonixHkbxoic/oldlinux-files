I have a three button mouse, at least
microsoft compatable, probably others
as well ( becuase there are three buttons).

I am using the S3 based XFREE86, and although,
with " od -c", I see that all buttons are 
sending codes, Xwindows applications never
register the middle button (2).

How do I configure to get all buttons?
Will the move to XF86_S3-2.0 help?

Thanks, dennis@math.nwu.edu

I have seen an ST12550N recently. It's blazingly fast, especially due
to its high rpm (7200). Realiability is another question.

I really would like to know what your problems with the AHA1542C is. There is
a 1G limitation for DOS and other quasi-OSes because DOS supports no more than 
1024 cylinders on a disk (correctly: the BIOS is the bad one). OSes not
depending on the BIOS will have no problems with more than 1024 cyls. The one
and only thing that you have to pay attention to: you cannot _boot_ a file
that is located above the 1G 'limit' because the BIOS will not be able to 
access this location. Do _not_ activate Adaptec's extended translation for
OSes other than MSDOS! The disk drivers will not be able to work with
the different disk mapping (255 heads/63spt).

That's nonsense, folks. You're in a Linux newsgroup. Linux does not deal
with the controller's BIOS. Correct me if I'm wrong, Eric.

You can have my old 1542B which works fine with my DEC DSP 3160S if you send
me your 1542C ;-)

I've got a Maxtor Panther PO-17s (1.5GB) working flawlessly.
Also, I asked Adaptec for the Programing information on the 1542C and in about
two weeks I got all the manuals I needed to write device drivers for the card.
Eric (at tantalus) has done such a fantastic job that I've never bothered.
BTW, I'm talking about the 1542C and did not know there have been more than one 
release.
I say thanks to Eric again for doing an excellent job.

The X is running in your first available unused (i.e. no login prompt)
VC.  This is often #7, so (on my system, anyways), hit Alt-F7 to go
back.

X is started on an unused virtual console. E.g. if you have 4 console 
logins enabled, X is at 5. This is written to the message screen
which is still on that console where you had typed 'startx'.
So typing Alt-F5 will bring you back to X.

Subject: --Can't boot a1.5. Have weird SCSI card. -------------------
Date: Fri, 3 Dec 1993 09:42:22 GMT

Hello,

I am trying to install Linux on my 486/33, 8mb RAM, 210 Meg IDE
hard drive, CMS Jumbo 250, 2 floppies... pretty standard stuff.

My only weird thing is a Session 8, a direct to disk digital
audio recording system. It has a SCSI card as part of it.
The entire unit eats one interupt, and lives at 0x200.

I have a foolish dream to use one SCSI Seagate ST11200 for
the Session 8, and another for Linux (using the Session 8's 
SCSI controller. I know I'll have trouble with the SCSI card,
but the trouble is, I can't even get it to boot.

During the boot sequence (disk a1.5), I get this:

   loopback device init
   8390.c: v0.86 4/8/93 for 0.99.6 Donald Becker (becker@super.org)
   HP-LAN ether card probe at 0x200: dc f0

... and it hangs. The next time I tried, it hung on the previous "Becker"
line.

I have tried from ramdisk, and from floppy: same results.
   
Can anyone offer me some advice on getting this to boot? I obviously
need to disable the HP-LAN probe (removing the Session-8 is *not* an
option!). And why does it sometimes hang on the line above and how to
fix?
                  
Email responses please.

Thanks in advance,

   Well, I use Slackware since the first version, and I'm through my third
upgrade (this time from scratch). Never had any problem such as those you
report, so I think that there may be some bad downloaded program somewhere.
Maybe it's gzip, maybe tar (don't you get any complaint?), maybe the boot/
root disk. I don't exactly know, but surely it's this. The binaries work,
I can tell you for sure. Other possibilities: you've booted from ALPHA
kernel disk and the libs has the wrong version, or your libs installed are
damaged ... There are a lot of possibilities. In the mean time, I'm getting
Slackware to install it next week. It would probably take me no more than
half an hour to install, and another hour to customize it the way I like.

Bye!

Ok, there was a recent french post, followed by a lot of discussion about
which language to use. I prefer to use English, though I'm Spanish, live
in Spain, and I'm proud of my language. It's just that I want everyone to
understand me.

Well, Francisco, it's nice to see that there are more spanish linux users
out there. Have you sent mail to the linux counter? last time I checked,,
there were only 5 spanish users (including me). Maybe now there are many
more. This project has been there since february (I think), and hasn't
enough popularity. Maybe it should be included in the Linux Meta-FAQ.

Saludos.

I have been unable to get very far with it as yet. Until I can get linux
working reliably on my machine, I will be unable to do anything on the howto.
I should never have upgraded from pl6 :) Too many new problems.

You are doing a lot of maths on a machine with no hardware maths support so
the "system" is emualting the maths co-processor. The math-emu is part of
the kernel and so appears as system time in the output of time. If you
really want to run neural networks on a PC then I think using a DX or buying
a maths co-pro will give you more than a marginal improvement. probably
those 180 seconds of system time would transform into about 5 seconds of
co-pro time.

Attention UNIX/PC System Administrators!

I would like to have some general/specific opinions from people
who read this newsgroup and would have any advice or comment (from

              LINUX
              386BSD
              FreeBSD                 <---- these are not listed

              Minix
              or any other

I am soon to start a project wherein I need to install one of
the above onto a 486DX2 VLB with a 430Mb IDE HD,
16Mb RAM, an SMC ethernet card, and a VGA monitor. (I'll change
any specific item(s) if necessary, but this looks like the most
likely setup.)

I need to know which is the best route to go and *your* opinion
as to why.  I am also curious as to ease of installation, compatibility
with third party software packages, etc. - anything one can think
of that's important.  I am not looking for FAQs; I have downloaded
most already.

The primary, initial, function will be to set up eMail accounts,
