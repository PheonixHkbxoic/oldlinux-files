On the contrary - what they are doing is very rude.  If they don't
have time to read the newsgroup they won't be able to tell whether
their question has been answered.

If they then post to the group they are implicitly valuing their time
at 10 or 100 times that of each of the readers of col.help.  This is
extremely discourteous.

The real reason answers should be sent by email is so that the
questioner can, if appropriate, produce one single summary of the
replies they received, rather than there being n dozen postings in the
group.

But how can they be running Linux when it only supports the "C"

Just as a small suggestion....if you want to make the magazine electroncically
available to make the origial document easily hypertextified - into HTML.

This was you can easily put it up on the web, it is easy to browse and
you will generate alot of attention because e-journals are still kinda
rare on the web, but definately welcome.

There is a LaTex->html convertor that does a really nice job...but still
the whole authoring issue is a big one to say the lest!

If you need contributors, please keep me in mind (e-mail).

You're completely wrong.  The libraries are covered by the GLPL, not the
GPL, so proprietary applications may link to them.  In fact, Richard
Stallman, head of the Free Software Foundation and author (together with
his lawyers) of the GPL and LGPL, has said publicly, several times, that
commercial binaries and things like the proprietary Motif library are legal
under OSes with GPLed kernels and LGPLed libraries like Linux and the
(as yet vaporware) GNU HURD system.  There are already several proprietary
programs and libraries for Linux (the Motif libraries are probably the
most successful such product so far).

However, the kernel is under the GPL, so at least under the FSF interpretation
it's against the rules to ship proprietary code that links directly to the
kernel (such as device drivers).  However, this is a topic that people
disagree on: some claim that the GPL has no power to legally forbid
someone from shipping a proprietary device driver.

Summary of FSF argument: kernel+device driver is a derivative work of the
kernel, so GPL applies.  Opponents' argument: I'm shipping only the device
driver and it is my code: I can do what I want.  FSF comeback: in developing
it, you had Linux+device driver together.  After shipping that is what your
customer has -- so you have in effect distributed a derivative work.
Opponents' comeback: but what about cases like Sega vs Accolade?  FSF folks:
that doesn't apply because blah blah blah ... and on and on for hundreds
of messages.

Given this dispute over what the law is, I think people of good will should
fall back to honoring the intent of people like Linus, RMS, and others
who've given you so much and keep the kernel and device driver code free,
even if some lawyer tells you you could get away with not honoring the
letter of the GPL.  The interests of the Linux community are best served
by convincing the manufacturers of devices and peripherals to provide
enough information so that others can write programs that control them.
Companies that want to hide all this information and sell their own
proprietary device drivers (typically DOS-only) should be avoided.

They don't need to: commercial programs may use the Linux libraries and
be compiled by the GNU compilers.  No problem.

That's a pretty good summary, except for these things (assume an "as far as
I know" in front of each, because I may have missed the answers to these):

(1) Nintendo vs. Galoob is the case that really blows a hole in the FSF
argument.  I don't think they've answered this one.

(2) I don't think they've posted an answer to the Sega vs. Accolade
case, either.

(3) It seems that in many arguments, they treat "derivative work" as
English, rather than as a legal term of art.  This leads to misconclusions.

Please tell me, kind sir, what an instructor is going to do if he
doesn't instruct?  How do you expect the students to learn for themselves
if you don't give them the minimal tools to do that?

In this case, the minimal tool is a pointer to the FAQ.

I agree with you that students (and Linux users) should think for themselves,
but there is nothing wrong with helping them along.  There are some students
out there who don't desire to learn and are only at school at mommy and
daddies urging.  However, people who want to run Linux are, on average,
the fast learning hacker types.

Yes, I have read Shakespeare, and more recently Douglas Adams ( :) )
both of whom are exelent insultants.  Nevertheless, that was during
Renaissance, not today, and "fcuk noff u luser" does not qualify as
art.  IMHO, of course.

Irrelevant?  I can't belive that you don't want commercial quality apps.
PD software is not commercial quality.  Most shareware is, though.
More people will be enticed to write (or port) shareware to Linux if
there is a big user base.  More people begat more money begat more
software begat more people. . .

That is not true.  You may have turned away the one with the talent to
write a decent word processor, or other Linux app.  You may have turned
away the person who has the means to get Linux much needed positive
publicity.  You may have turned away the person who adds compressed
file system support to Linux.  You never know.

that doesn't make them any less of a person though.

Nope.

Most of the current Linux C library is protected by the GNU Library Public
License, which allows linking to proprietary object files and therefore
presents no legal difficulty.  Those parts that are not will be in the future:
some parts are being moved from GPL to GLPL, others are being replaced with
GLPL'ed versions.  I suspect the next libc release will be completely GLPL'ed
(except for any parts which might be PD or be covered by e.g. BSD copyright).
