Does the Xfree software eventually plan to support the et4000W32 video chip? 
I've just spent quite a while finding out that it can only be configured in
generic monocrome mode.

No it's not. Don't forget that I am comparing a "16M system which is 
usefull today" vs a "16MB cpu which was release 10 years ago".

Again, I was comparing 68000 to 8086.

MS Windows took the approach it took, because it didn't have a CPU with 32 bit
registers and flat address space. There was no other choice. On the other hand
Apple chose segmented architecture.

So if you are an ordinary application programmer, you can allocate 8K 100 bytes
and run out of segment descriptors. (OK, I aggree that you should sub-allocate
but that seems to take more than an ordinary app, these days)

Also, the programmer is extremely well aware of the 4 segment registers and swapping,
comparing and allocating them is a royal pain.

Hi All,

I'm looking for a recent benchmark to compare overall performance of Linux, 
HP-UX and SunOS on different HW-platforms. Anyone know of such a program + 
where I can get it? Preferably a benchmark that includes X performance as 
well.

Please respond via e-mail. 
I will post a summary of all the programs and their location (if I get 
response of course).

Thanx,

updated in sched.c at every timer tick, in do_timer(), and the timer
is programmed for 1/100 second intervals.

What one might regard as the most definitive book on tcl/tk (since its author
is John Ousterhout, the author of tcl/tk) hasn't actually been published yet
to my knowledge.  However, its draft is available in postscript form from
harbor.ecn.purdue.edu in /pub/tcl/sprite-mirror.

Hi all,

Trying to run X on my pc with a trackball turned out ot be exactly as hopeless
as the docs say.  I don't suppose someone has has made a patch to get this to
work?

Well, if not does anyone know where I would start to look for info on how to
do the device support myself?  Where is the regular mouse code for X as an
example?  Where can I get the Logitech Trackman specs, only directly from
Logitech?

Would it be an extensive effort?  This would be my first serious programming in

I read the man pages, and NO, you can't use two screens under X in the
color server.

However, IS there any hope that we can have a color screen and a MDA
scrren together under X soon???

How about those Zenons?  I am starting to lean away from Comtrade and more

Beware of this guy, folks!

A few years ago Mr. Johnston ran a public access Unix system out of
his house in Long Island.  Shortly after I subscribed to his service
(by mailing a check to cover the quarterly fee), the system
disappeared, and Mr.  Johnston was unreachable neither via voice nor
via email.  No explanation was given, and certainly no refund was
made.  A while later I happend to see a posting of his from another
email address.  I attempted to contact him there; there was no
response.  Needless to say, I'm pissed.  It's not so much the money as
the fact that this guy effectively stole my (and I'm sure others)
money, and then proceeded to ignore my attempts to contact him.  I
mean, I would have been happy with just a reply from him saying he was
sorry or something.

You would be foolish to send money to a person who obviously has no
integrity and/or morals.

Nope. I'm hoping libc.4.4.2 will come out soon, and I'm not going to use
the alpha version in the meantime. I don't think releasing them in a
Linux distribution at this time is appropriate.

However, I have included a statically compiled rpc.portmap, and the 
librpclib_g.a library. This should cure RPC problems until the new libraries 
are released.

Interesting that people who have access to the best online technical
support would have to *PAY* for the service. The Internet is THE SOURCE
for help. And in most cases you have responses in less than 24hours.

Imagine if everybody that answered questions on the Interent billed you
for their services? Ridiculous, eh? Well, if Mr Michael R Johnston
ever posts a question, let's bill him. :)

Ok, so this explains the blocky fonts, howvever, I have not been able
to solve a problem I have been having with fonts which don't appear
in a blocky fashion.

The problem I have been having is that the font's overlay eachother
on the one line. It seems to be related to the app trying to fully
justify the text it wants to display. When I resize the window to
be almost a full screen (1024x768) it clears up this problem in many cases,
however, particularly in help, it doesn't clear up enough to make the
help readable.

Any hints? I've tried changing the BodyFont for help to things like
TimesRoman10 (or something) but this didn't help ..

Thanx in advance

Subject: NOT JUST ANOTHER LINUX + 386BSD CD-ROM
Date: 16 Sep 1993 03:20:45 GMT

=====================================================================

        NOT JUST ANOTHER LINUX + 386BSD CD-ROM.

Trans-Ameritech presents LINUX SLS/Slackware AND 386BSD and MULTYMEDIA CD-ROM.

A new Linux CD-ROM is available! But not just Linux. Also 386BSD and more.
Here is a brief summary of why we think this CD-ROM is the best.
As the price of only $30 puts it in the same price category as the JANA 
product, I'll base my comparison on it.


We provide 2 versions of SLS distribution - a very stable 1.02 and the new 1.03
and also the SLACKWARE distribution! Linux installs directly from the CD-ROM
on almost any hardware configuration.

1. The Trans-Ameritech Linux CD-ROM is not just a mirror of some ftp site. 
In addition to the full SLS distributions we supply a "live" image of a 
configured system. This is great if you don't want files that are not used 
very often to garble your hard disk. One example is manpages - use them 
directly from the CD-ROM. Same applies to emacs lisp files, info files etc.
How many fonts do you need? Have them all! Space is no problem.

2. Uncompressed sources are available for instant reference.

3. Several versions of the Linux kernel are provided precompiled to cover 
different hardware options including drivers for Sony-31A and Sound Blaster 
CD-ROMs.

4. Patches to support sound cards are included. Take this compiled kernel IF 
YOU WANT. If not - use a small kernel with no unused ballast.

5. Install Linux directly from the Sony-31A or Sound Blaster CD-ROM drive as
well as standart SCSI and Mitsumi types.

6. We are running Linux on several PCs to make sure that our configurations
really work. We don't wait for official SLS release for certain extra drivers
and utilities. If they work here, we include it as an option on the CDROM.

7. For your convenience a full recent distribution of 386BSD *NIX is provided
on the same CD-ROM.

8. Some space is dedicated to what takes too much room on hard disks - 
sounds and pictures. They are usable with the Linux sound/gif tools and under 
MS-DOS too!

9. A few choice MS-DOS applications are included in the assumption that the
majority of Linux users run DOS occasionaly. Or use it from dos-emu!
Most of the MS-DOS stuff comes from the SIMTEL20 archive. Naturally only part 
of it made it to the first CDROM. However the new releases will include other 
files from SIMTEL20, GARBO etc. So if you subsribe to the Trans-Ameritech 
Linux+ CDROM, you will not only get updated Linux, but over a year you will get
the full SIMTEL20 collection as an extra bonus.

10. Trans-Ameritech is a well established company with efficient organization
to guarantee on-time printing and shipping of this product. There will be a
significant discount if you subscribe for future releases.

But the best part is that YOU will decide what to put on the next edition!
We'll count votes and provide most popular software on the next one.

Credit card orders are wellcome. Call Trans-Ameritech at (408) 727- 3883.
