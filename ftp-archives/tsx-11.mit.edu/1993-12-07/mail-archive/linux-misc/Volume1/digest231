I think his problem is having to say

#ifdef linux
#include <ncurses.h>
#else
#include <curses.h>
#endif

And possibly adding -I/usr/include/local if he's not installing it in
/usr/include.  And possibly not using "linux" as the ifdef, in case he wants
to use ncurses on other systems as well, which also means -DUSE_NCURSES or
something like that...

Considering that to make sure a modern curses program works even on an SCO
*ix (either) system that has been dumbified by defining M_TERMCAP
automatically you need to include <tinfo.h> instead of <curses.h> and link
against -ltinfo, I'm rather familiar with this particular problem.  :-(

Yes the cirrus based card will work. But diamond has stated that they will 
not reverse their politics regarding "proprietary" code. So the
falming of diamond is still OK for me. The restrictions do not apply to
the Cirrus card because it has a clock generator of its own and so the

I buy a card of the ONLY company that works against it, if I want to use this

Buy cards from companies that support you not from companies that don't.

There is a very excellent program called x64, the current version is 2.0, which
is an emulator for "the good old" c64 under X windows. It compiled without any
problems under Linux. You can even create a file that simulates the 1541 floppy
drive, it's really amusing.

You will need two files that contain the BASIC and the KERNEL rom of the c64.
They aren't included in x64 because they are copyrighted by Commodore. If you don't
have the ability to transfer these files from your c64 to your PC, tell me the
first 8 bytes of the kernel and I'll send them to you :-) Just as a proof that you
are the legal owner of a c64 kernel.

Have fun,
Kai

When installing Linux I found that

   1) The atixlmouse driver was redundant in that I have an ATI XL card and the
Microsoft mouse driver works wonderfully (after figuring out that my mouse was
on a non-standard base address AND a non-standard IRQ)
   2) The axixlmouse driver, at least with my mouse, often did not properly
report a button press until the mouse was moved.

So my question is, is there anybody out there that
   a) is using the atixlmouse driver without problem 2 mentioned above?
   b) is using the atixlmouse driver and can't use the microsoft busmouse driver

Hi all,

I am using a 3-button optical mouse, which can simulate both Microsoft
mouse and others.  When I used the Microsoft mouse option in the
Xconfig file, only the left and right buttons work but not the middle.
This is rather annoying.  I also tried 3ButtonMouse and other mouse 
options but the mouse just went wild or idle!

How did you guys solve the problem?  For your information, the mouse
that I am using is called QuickMouse.

Many many thanx in advance.

This is probably okay for local use, but I should point out that:

1)  A file copy from an NFS mounted filesystem is very much slower than
    obtaining the same file through FTP, and

2)  There is no error detection employed when transferring data

Right. Some strings (F24..F27? Don't remember exactly) have already been
defined but are unused by now. But we need more than that.

[[I  just don't  quite  like  the way  how  the  FKey numbers  are  assigned
randomly. There should be a systematic assignment  in the numbers that makes
it easier to determine the sequence->FKey_number translation.]]

The way I do it in X11 (xterm) is like this:

1)  the "syntax" for ANSI sequences is defined in ISO-6429 (I guess there is
    a  follow-up by  now). These  sequences start  with a  "control sequence
    introducer" CSI  which is either  <ESC> followed by  '[' or (in  a 8 bit
    environment) the control code 0x9B (which is 'ESC' plus 0x80)-- see also
    ISO-2022).
    The rest of the sequence consists of
    *   parameter values "Pn" (characters between 0x30 and 0x3F, usually
        ascii-decimal numbers, separated by ';'),
    *   optional intermediate characters "In" (coding between 0x20 and 0x2F)
    and a
    *   final character "F" (coding between 0x40 and 0x7E)
    The semantics of functions with a  final character between 0x40 and 0x5A
    and  between 0x60 and  0x6F are  defined in ISO-6429.  Sequences between
    0x70 and  0x7F are "not  standardized and are available  for private (or
    experimental) use."
  ==========================================================================
  In other  words, we could  assign codes like  e.g. the following  (see the
  bits, fritz?)  to the  unshifted/control/alt/shift function  keys  without
  breaking the syntax defined in ISO-6429:
  <ESC>[11~         <-- unshifted
  <ESC>[11;1~       <-- shifted
  <ESC>[11;2~       <-- control
  <ESC>[11;3~       <-- shift+control
  <ESC>[11;4~       <-- alt
  <ESC>[11;5~       <-- shift+alt
  <ESC>[11;6~       <-- control+alt
  <ESC>[11;7~       <-- shift+control+alt
  Wouldn't that be  a systematic approach?  One FKey always yields  the same
  base number, and the shift/ctrl/alt state is appended as a second number?
  ==========================================================================

2)  And this is how it can be done (today already!) in xterm:

  Either define the following in ~/.Xresources....:
     *VT100.Translations: #override \
         <Key>F1: string(\"\033[11;1~\") \n\
         <Key>F2: string(\"\033[12;1~\") \n\            ...etc
         Shift<Key>F1: string(\"\033[11;1~\") \n\
         Shift<Key>F2: string(\"\033[12;1~\") \n\       ...etc
         Ctrl<Key>F1: string(\"\033[11;2~\") \n\
         Ctrl<Key>F2: string(\"\033[12;2~\") \n\        ...etc

  ....or call xterm with the -xrm switch like this....:
    xterm -xrm "*VT100.Translations: #override \
         <Key>F1: string(\"\033[11;1~\") \n\
         <Key>F2: string(\"\033[12;1~\") \n\            ...etc

I'm not sure what you mean here.  There most certainly is error
detection.  NFS implements checksums on top of the UDP transport
layer.  (in the RPC library, actually)  What Sun manuals are you
talking about?  The nfs(4) man page I have has this:

ERRORS
     Generally physical disk I/O errors detected  at  the  server
     are  returned  to  the  client for action.  If the server is
     down or inaccessible, the client will see the  console  mes-
     sage:
          NFS server host not responding still trying.
     Depending on whether the file system has been mounted "hard"
     or  "soft"  (see mount(8)), the client will either  continue
     (forever) to resend the request until it  receives  an  ack-
     nowledgement  from  the  server, or return an error to user-
     level.  For hard mounts, this means the server can crash  or
     power  down  and  come  back  up  without any special action
     required by the client.  If the "intr" mount option was  not
     specified,  a  client  process requesting I/O will block and
     remain insensitive to signals, sleeping inside the kernel at
     PRIBIO until the request is satisfied.

The big problem I see with NFS exporting is the security problem.
There are well-known NFS attacks even for read-only exported
filesytems.  Talk to the folks at wuarchive on how to do NFS exporting
in a reasonably secure fashion.
