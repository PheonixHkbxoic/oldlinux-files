I'm using a 486/50 EISA box with Slackware 1.01 and a Telebit WorldBlazer.
Right now uutraf is reporting 1963 cps.  I'm expecting higher when I switch
the i/o board out with a STB (16)550 card.

This looks like a pretty good security concept wrt. the local machine.
But what about the other end? The main problem with trsh is that
anyone who can access the socket on one end can get a shell on the
other. Especially, root on the remote machine can get a shell on the
local machine, i.e. a root shell with your setup. (You could set
SHELL=/bin/false before running term, but unfortunately this won't
work in all cases.) Think of the term link as something like an rhosts
file on both ends for the UID term runs under and an entry for the
other machine. At least root can do anything there, which is one of
the many problems with rhosts.

I've just prepared a set of patches for term which help this by an
option for denying trsh, among other features. I'll post it tomorrow.
But I recommend to NOT run term as root but rather under an own dummy
user ID - perhaps one without a real login shell.

Can we *please* drop this thread once and for all? The person with the
original post put it out as flame-bait and whoever responded fell for
it!!! The best thing you could of done was not say one word. Now this
dufus can sit back and go "heh-heh look what I started...".

I'm sure Mr. Jackson is a fine indvidual who has helped several people.
If you know that then that's all you need to know. If I sit here and
read Mr. dufus's thread and say "Gosh - this Jackson fellow is a real
ass..." then I'm as stupid as he is...

Now returning to your normal programming....

Subject: scanner support

Hi folks,

I would simply like to know whether there are scanner drivers under development
or ready. I am using a Logitec Scanman Color under DOS/Windows and would like
to be able to use it under Linux, too? Is there someone who kwnows something
about that?

Thanx

I noticed that the /usr/bin/f77 script parses the -O options nicely
but does not use them in the $CC commands.  I added $O to my $CC
commands to get time reduction from 32 to 22 seconds for a program.

It might be nice to fix this at its source.

Date: Thu, 2 Sep 1993 21:11:43 GMT

Hello,
        as this is a common problem to all those who are new in LINUX,
that means, also for me. Doing backups is a hard thing there, because
I really got acquainted to my floppy-tape. Its QIC-80, can R/W QIC-40,
its only lacking support under LINUX. Why? There are other OS which can
drive such a beast. Ok, someone should set it up.

But there must be a fast way to do backups on floppies. tar seems fine,
but there is one feature (?) i don't like. Multivolume archives (-M)
and online compression (-z) seem to be imcompatable. Bad enough, as
one has to throw in tons of floppies... The error resulting is 
something like "only copied 0 of 10240 bytes" and abend of tar.
What can I do better?

        Thanks a lot in advance, 
                Karsten

Is there a version of SCCS for Linux?  So far all I've found is rcs.  Or
is SCCS a Sun product?  (That's the only system I've used that has had it)

Thanks

Even on a fairly slow machine, contrary to what people have suggested,
if the compression scheme decompresses fast then you can have a net
GAIN in speed, since you are reading fewer blocks.  The extra cpu
cycles do degrade processing speed slightly, but if you are i/o bound
anyways, it doesn't matter.

Subject: [Q] 3c503: Configured interrupt number 15 is out of range.
Date: 3 Sep 1993 22:01:53 GMT


I've recently gotten a 3comm Etherlink II ethernet card, but only the
original mcc (pl10+) bootimage seems to detect it. I've recompiled pl12 4
times and still cannot get it to even probe for it. (I've copiled in ALL
ethernet card drivers). How do I get pl12 to probe for a 3c503?

When I do use the MCC bootimage, it probes for the card, finds it, but
gives me this error:

3c503: Configured interrupt number 15 is out of range.

As far as I can see there are no jumpers on the card to change this
interrupt. Are 3com cards software configured for interrupts? How would I
change this interupt to somehting like irq5?
