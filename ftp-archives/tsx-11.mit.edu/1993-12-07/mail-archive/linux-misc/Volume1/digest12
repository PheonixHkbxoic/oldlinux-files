Subject: Is this hardware enough for LINUX?

Hi. I am considering switching to linux to write X applications.
I will also need tcp/ip on the box to connect to various sites.
My boss is suggesting a 386SX-20Mhz machine with 6 Megs of RAM
and 80 Meg hard disk. It seems both too small in RAM and hard disk,
not to mention too sluggish. However, I have never tried LINUX,
so I don't know. Can someone tell me if it's an acceptable setup?
Thanks!  -turgut

Just to get back to the topic of SIMM prices again :

Does anybody know is SIMMs are still expensive (and how expensive??) ?
I'm just wondering if prices did allready drop to the normal rate before
the explosion in the chemical factory in japan.

I have been using lilo for some time on my ESDI drives with fine

Is there a fix for this?

Speaking as a complete Unix (not to mention Linux) Novice (possible idiot 
as well), I managed to get the SLS distribution and install it with very
little problems (even X windows).  

I'll admit I do know a bit about the PC, but all the partitioning and file
systems was new to me. 

All in all, it was as easy to install as any other OS I have tried 
(DOS included).

The next major mind bender is setting up the dialin/out, UU and SLIP.  That 
could be simplified.

[ My reply to pschen. And retraction ] 

I've confused two different development efforts. The WINAPI stuff allows
you compile windows sources and it substitutes X calls for the Windows calls.
That's what's in the SLS/Slackware distributions.

The WABI stuff will allow you to run Windows Binaries directly. Again from
what I understand there will be an equivalent to a Windows DLL that will
translate windows calls to X calls dynamically. 

Now before you go off jumping for joy:

1) WINAPI is in pre-alpha.
2) The WABI folks aren't talking. I have not seen any software yet.
3) We're talking Windows only. Linux's job is not to emulate every OS on
   the planet. It's just that there is such a huge body of DOS/Windows
   programs - that being able to run them without leaving Linux and to be
   able to run other programs while DOS/Windows programs execute is a useful
   tool. 

====================== Personal opinion time =============================

I personally prefer Linux based tools and programs to DOS/Windows programs.
Unix code is generally cleaner - more readable - and has calls I know and
understand.  WABI is useful because there are a few useful Windows programs 
that required a tremendous amount of programming effort, only has the binary 
available and doesn't have a Linux equivalent on the horizon. WABI will 
execute those binaries. 

So I'd advise in the meantime to just keep a partition available with all of
the DOS/Windows programs that you absolutely must have. Migrate everything
else to Linux.

Incidentally I was cleaning out my DOS partition last night. I found about
13 Meg of stuff (out of 21 Meg) that I'd either moved to Linux, or didn't need.
And now that I have DOSEMU running (Yeah! That's a program to jump for joy 
about...) I can run the few DOS applications my wife uses from Linux.

Life is good.

After having purchased a pair of WD-ETP cards new-in-box for about $80,
I set about figuring out how to hook up the two.  Manuals mentioned a
concentrator which turns out to be a couple of hundred bucks (OUCH!).
So, out of desperation, I bought a $2 inline plastic straight-through
RJ45 coupler, pulled it apart and wired outs to in and ins to out.  Only
4 of the wires are active.

Works great.  Saved a bunch.  Only $2.  Downside is that I can't
easily add nodes...

Subject: Something is wrong with Linux boot code...
Date: Tue, 17 Aug 1993 15:01:22 GMT

(Well, *that* subject line ought to stir things up...)

I've been unsuccessful getting Linux (any version since 99pl4 - don't know
about earlier versions) on my 486 to boot.  Invariably, it dies during the
boot with a message about "no free pages".  Many kind people have been
helpful, with suggestions about trying:

        (1) Booting w/o cache
        (2) Replacing the memory chips
        (3) Replacing the BIOS
        (4) Replacing the motherboard

However, to be honest, I don't believe any of them.  I believe (easy
for me to say, I know) that the correct answer is:

        Fix the Linux boot process.

Why?  Because:

        (1) I've been running System 5r3 for 3 years now on the machine
            with *never* a problem on booting - none, zilcho - comes
            right up.

        (2) NetBSD-0.8 boots without a problem - none, zilcho - comes
            right up.

        (I'm not even going to mention MS-DOS, of course.)

        I'd be willing to bet that System 5r4 would come right up, as would
        the other BSD versions floating around.

And yes, the cache is enabled for these.  Further, I can benchmark the
System 5r3 system and measure the difference between having cache enabled
or disabled, so if the System 5r3 system is disabling the cache itself,
it must be reenabling it after booting.  (And I doubt it touches the
cache at all!)

Now, clearly these other OS's are doing something different than Linux
does during booting.  What?  Why can't Linux do it too?

(Yes, I also recognize that I'm in a very minority position with Linux,
as it works *on most hardware*, but I wonder if there are people running
w/o cache, etc. that really shouldn't have to be doing it that way?)

I happen to like Linux (I've used it on other machines), it's a clean design,
and the general net support is much nicer than that I've seen for the BSDs
out there.  It's very frustrating that something in the boot process is
keeping me from using it.

Subject: Re: WABI/WINE - INFO!
Date: Tue, 17 Aug 1993 15:33:21 GMT

First of all the Linux binary execute project is called WINE.
SUMMARY: It's being worked on. It's making progress. We'll be informed when
         something useful is done. The developers need help. So if you have
         time/energy join the WABI channel.

Here is the info I just received by Email (thanks Kurt!)

================= WINE INFO BY EMAIL ================================

The WABI project is now using the name "Wine".  I'm not involved, but
here's the README from tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/ALPHA/Wine.  

===== begin included README =====

        The Wine project for linux is an attempt to write something
with similar functionality to the WABI that was developed by Sun.

        The basic goal is to be able to take a MS-Windows binary and
run it under Linux with X-Windows running.  The finished product will
essentiaily consist of two parts:

        a) A program loader, which will load the Windows binary into
the virtual memory of the linux process, provide a means for adjusting
the ldt of the processor so that the 16-bit segments that are
typically used with Windows binaries will work correctly, and provide
a means for calling the Windows binary in the first place, allowing
the Windows binary to call back to the 32-bit mode program, and
finally allow the 32-bit mode program to call back again to the
Windows binary (i.e. Windows callbacks).  In each case, the arguments
being passed wil have to be pulled from the appropriate stack and
loaded on to the other stack (there will be a 16 bit and a 32 bit
stack).  Finally some application specfic DLL libraries will have to
be loaded, and dynamic linking will have to be performed.

        b) The second part of the finished product is an emulation
library, which takes calls to Windows functions, and somehow
translates these into calls to X11 in one fashion or another, so that
equivalent functionality is achieved.

        It should be pointed out that the Windows binary will be
running directly - there will be no need for machine level emulation
of the instructions.  Sun has reported better performance with their
version of WABI than is actually achieved under MS-Windows -
theoretically the same result is possible under linux.

        The project got started as a result of discussions on
comp.os.linux in early June of 1993.  A mail channel was set up for
discussions, and this directory was created.  At the moment, all of
the files that are uploaded are in the private directory in a hidden
directory.  The reason for this is that the program is really only of
use to developers right now.  Once something is ready for public
consumption, it will be uploaded to a publicly visible directory.
The final product will almost certainly be under the GNU Public License
(or GPL for short).

        If you are interested in getting involved in this project,
join the linux activists' WABI channel.  Also, I will do my best to
answer any question mailed to me.  My address is "bob@amscons.com".

***************************************************************

Status Report - August 4, 1993

        The loader portion is nearing completion.  Sample Windows
binaries are loaded correctly into memory, dynamicly linked and so
forth.  The 16/32 bit call interface is fairly complete.  There are
still a few features that remain to be added before it can be
considered "done", but it is at the point where it is actually useful.
Resource loading and software interrupt handling is still not done.

        A very minimal version of the emulation library has been
merged with the loader.  Windows can be created, DC's may be used,
bitmaps are partially handled, text drawing is implemented, and
a preliminary implementation of menus has been created.

Hello,

well ... the hardware would work. Linux would run without problems on it, but:

- 80MB is rather small. You want to use X on it. A complete Linux distrib with
  X fills about 60 - 90 MB on the HD (with all the utilities etc), so get
  a 245 MB drive (these are rather cheap todays, around 400$).

- A 386sx ist the absolute minimum for Linux. You want to write X programs.
  On a 386sx, compiling will take 3 years for even the smallest thing (okok,
  not really 3 years .. but real long :-) )

why 6 MB? get 8.
