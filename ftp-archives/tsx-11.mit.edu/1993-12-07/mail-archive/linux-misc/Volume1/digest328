Subject: crc error during install
Date: 21 Nov 1993 20:27:05 -0500


I am trying to install 0.99.13 version of SLS linux and found out 
following problem.

I tried almost a hundred times of my installation, but the install
program kept giving me "crc error" from gzip, or tar: "skipping to next
file header. stdin: invalide compressed data-- crc error".

This error happens in different files each time, even through I used
same disk for installation.(i.e: my installation file on a2-a4 are 
the same during different installation.)

I suspect it's communication chanel noise corrupt the file. But I tried
to download them from different sites, at different time. Also, I tested
them out under my SUN os account, before I downloaded them to my PC. 
The files turned out OK in my SUN os account, and I could use gzip
and untar to uncompress file without problem under DOS without any
problem. However, it turned out
the other way when you use "doinstall" under linux(I booted linux
using a1).

I would appreciate if any kind soul can give me a suggestion of what the
problem is. 



--eve

p.s. It's not hardware problem either, because I once successfully installed
the minimum and it works for two days.

After using Dell Unix for quite some time, I decided to install Linux on
my 486 DX/2 66MHz EISA system.  I was amazed at the speed - and also
pleasantly surprised at how *fast* it boots!
(I guess it's also because of the enhanced mode of the Adaptec 1742 and
a SCSI-II HD! :-)

Definitely faster!

 I'm not interested in another battle, but I think that something should
be decided on.  Should linux officially (in terms of how LDP and general support suggests for beginners and such) back SLS or Slackware.  It is generally accepted that Slackware is better.  SLS seems to be suggested for novices and as the standard but doesn't seem to be backed by a team that responds to 
users comments and comes out with new versions fixing bugs and such.  If
Peter (from SLS) hasn't wrote a submission to the linux Installation HOWTO, where is the proof of his support.  I'm concerned because I feel like using the
standard.  I've been waiting for the new release of SLS and I could wait, but
I don't even see a sign of SLS's promise for continuing.  If he is too busy preparing the next release forget everything that I just said, unless that is, linux users decide that the standard should be Slackware (who decided on this SLS thing anyway, as I read it, most people support Slackware if anything).  Call to a vote??

I don't anything should be done concerning the assignment of any kind
of 'official' status to *ANY* linux distribution.  I totally disagree
with any need to make such a decision.  Orthodoxy is *not* what made
linux what it is, nor will it (IMNSHO) yield any positive benefits in
the near future.

How do you even know that Slackware will continue?  How do you think it
would look if Slackware were endorsed as the 'official' version, only to
have its maintainer(s) decide for whatever reasons that they can't/won't
continue to provide upgrades?

I have a mitsushibe CD-rom drive on an adaptek 1542c controller, and 
dos can find it no problem.  I have installed a release of Linux from
CD-ROM.  But I cannot mount the CD_ROM. I can mount my /fd0H1440 floppy
no problem.  But I get the same error msg : iso9660 not supported by kernel,
when I try to mount the CD. I installed everything from the SLS 1.03
distribution. What are we missing here?????
I have a CD with the POWER TOOLS stuff, and I want to get at it.
At startup, the linux system sees the cd device.  Do I need a
more recent release of mount???? Is the SLS release of Linux faulty???
I'll stick with COHER-NOT if Linux cant read the CD!

Ah, it all depends :-)

If you're running a BIG job (physical models are the worst - yeesh!)
raw processing power is what you miss most - the difference between
taking 8 hours and 16 hours to run is considerable - even if you've got
something to distract you.

I wish *I* had the grunt of a sparc sitting on *my* desk :-)

   Hi Max...I am currently running Slackware 1.1.0 with Xfree 2.0 on a 
machine with an ATI GUP VLB card. It works great. I think you may have 
asked before if Xfree 1.3 supported the Mach32 chip, and from my experience
the only problem I had with 1.3 was that upon exiting X it left the monitor
in a weird mode that only gave me vertical lines. At the time I just dropped 
back down to 1.2 and waited for 2.0 to come out. Now that it has, I highly
recommend upgrading to it if you can't get 1.3 to work right for you with
your card. The Xconfig I have now is for 2.0, but if you do decide to move
up I will be happy to supply you with mine (though you should note that I
have a Gateway 15" CrystalScan monitor). What sort of problems are you
having?

I would use always Slackware because they have newer versions
of all the programs. P.e. I used SLS until last week and I had big
problems with the version of ext2fs - and I was told this is more
than 6 months old and the bugs there are fixed already!!!

I use no Slackware and I didn't have any serial problems!

I don't know much about SB.  SWI-Prolog is of the Edinburgh family.
Complete (modules, autoloading, garbage collector, dynamically expanding
stacks, etc.  etc.), robust, fast.  XPCE makes it big, but provides a
*lot*.  Prolog itself will run on any linux box with kernel later than
99pl6.  XPCE requires X11 installed and at *least* 8MB.  16MB is *much*
better, but with a reasonable fast machine/disk 8MB is acceptable.

SWI-Prolog itself is distributed in source-form.  Compiles ok, except
with gcc-2.5.1/2.5.2. 2.5.3 and later are ok again.  XPCE/SWI-Prolog
is a compiled and linked binary.

        Cheers --- Jan

You might want to try SWI-Prolog. Look in the Linux Software Map to find

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.

As a later posting pointed out.. you don't have to compile specificaly
for multiple processing to get a speedup from a sparc 10 with multiple
processors. Comes from the UNIX way of doing things.
Of course, there is some limit to how much speed gain you will get as you
add more and more processors.. but it is certainly there.

And we are definately talking unix, seeing as how this is
