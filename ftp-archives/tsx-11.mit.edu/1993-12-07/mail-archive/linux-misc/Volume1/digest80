Subject: Soundblaster card - How can I?

Reply-To: dpjunk@mmm.com

I just got a soundblaster card (for free! :) ) and am floundering on
which utilities I need to play *.au files.  I tried compiling
soundtools on sunsite:/pub/multimedia/utilities/unix but it needs
<sys/sb.h>.  Where can I get this file and any libs associated with
said file?  While I am asking ... Is there a utility that will send
plain text to the sound card and have it echoed back in voice?
(i.e. say "hello there" >/dev/disp)  I would really appreciate any
help!

P.S.  Many thanks to all who helped me get tracker compiled!

I have tried to make my keyboard german, i edited defkeymap.map

But.. i could not find the mktable, which is used to build it.
So where can i find it?

Subject: looking to hire Linux consultant for PC purchase and handholding
Date: Wed, 1 Sep 1993 08:57:39 GMT

Hi,

I'm interested in finding out about buying a portable PC to run Linux.
I've got a number of questions to help me decide if I should buy or not,
and will have a number of questions if I decide to buy concerning
hardware, prices, manufacturers, etc. Once I have my system, I may need
some handholding to get everything working.

I imagine I could just send questions to the net, but since you all have
probably answered these questions so many times, and since most of my
questions are already answered somewhere in some FAQ, I propose to hire
somebody out there to answer my questions for me. I imagine a couple
of hundred dollars to help with the PC purchase and maybe $50-$100/hr
for handholding over the Internet would be my target (negotiable).

Is anybody interested?

The person I would like to hire 

o should have experience enough to provide good advice in purchasing a
  portable PC for Linux use. I'm also interested in running some MSDOS
  applications. 
o should know prices and manufacturers for portable PC's and hardware.
o should be accessible via the Internet so that questions can be answered
  by e-mail fairly rapidly.

I would also be happy if somebody would volunteer to answer the questions
for free or reasonable donation (I'm not a company, I'm a private person).

I'm a high-end-hardware Unix user with much Unix experience but no PC
hardware or software experience at all.

Please e-mail with "Linux Consultant" in the header, I will not read
this newsgroup.

Thanks a lot, and I hope this article is relevant to this newsgroup,
Kevin

Of course you are forgetting to add that your must run SCO or
(supposedly) UNIXware to get the X stuff to work.  It will NOT work on
DELL SysVr4.  Though i supose you could run WP in an xterm and call
that X support. ;)

The UNIX version has at least as many fatal bugs as the DOS version. 
I just had it crater on a 3 page document with 1 equation
(z=r/w**1/3).  It said "not enough memory for graphics" (or some such
out of mem msg) and promptly deleted my entire document.  Under DOS,
this crashes the machine, under UNIX it just wipes things out and goes
quietly on.  BTW, this machine was a 486dx250 w/ 16 MB and 32 MB swap.
 I was the only user and was not doing much.  WP's upgrade policy and
site licensing policies are not bad.  Too bad their products are buggy
and you cannot get them to acknowledge bugs unless you describe a bug
they already know about.  Back to troff for me (or maybe WinWord). ;)

Dont forget to add breaking the console code and X code like SCO did
to get things that are written for SCO unix (the only commercial unix
it seems to the porters) to run under Linux.  COFF compatibility will
get the basic stuff to run, but dont expect the 'fancy' stuff to work
until you make everything act like SCO w X11R3 :(.

Per the ANNOUNCE file:

release of Version 2.0 of its software-only MPEG decoder.
The player is available via anonymous ftp from toe.cs.berkeley.edu

Hello,

yes .. there is mpeg_play .. I don't remeber where i found it :) but it was one
of the linux main hosts: nic.funet.fi, sunsite,unc,edu or tsx-11.mit.edu.
The best u can do is archie or an /msg linuxbot find -a mpeg_playe on #linu

What do you call media cost ? A CD is very cheap ... but I doubt
that the "media cost" for the gnu source CD is less expensive
as ordering their Linux ... or are they distributing the gnu
source CD as "presents at media costs ?" ;-)

While I am not connected with the Purify product (other than a user)
I would like to point out that Purify is not just a replacement
for malloc(). It works by inserting extra code into the object
files and relinks them (it actually takes copies of the files first).
In doing this it offers far more than the facilities you describe.

I do not wish to put a downer on what you have done because I think
yours is an outstanding product in its own right, but please be careful
in comparing, or making claims in respect to purify. If it offers
all that Purify does then that is ok, but if it is a subset then
say "Checker will be a free and GNU implementation of a subset
of the Purify(tm) product".

This has GOT to be the funniest thing I've seen in a LONG time.  Does
"bluejay" imply "bird brain"?

Now, let's see - a little critical analysis.  XFree86: X, Free, 86.  Hmm.
One might suppose that this name implied that XFree86 was free software.

What's the point of XFree86?  It runs on Linux (as well as a dozen other
OSs).  X11R5 does not run on Linux.

How on earth could ANYONE reach either conclusion that you've reached
(that XFree86 costs money, or that X11R5 can be used on Linux)?

...something is wrong here. Was the 486 an intel, or a Cyrix, or an AMD?
Was the 486 crippled with minimal memory? Or was the 486 suffering from
not having memory above 16M cached (if so equipped.)?? If the 486 was
a clone, did it also have a co-processor?

Other possibilities -- does POV do heavy graphics rendering? If so, are
the video cards similar? (...a slow Trident vs. an et4000 perhaps?)

...yes, this is true somewhat. If you are strapped for $$$, you will get 
better performance by buying a 386 and putting the extra money towards
more memory, as opposed to a 486 running only 4Mb (...or less!)
