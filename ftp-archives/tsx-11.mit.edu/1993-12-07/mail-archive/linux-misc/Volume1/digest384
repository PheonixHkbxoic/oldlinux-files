        LGX is a Linux distribution with a circulation of 10,000+.
From what I gather, the other Linux distributors sell a few hundred
copies, perhaps even around 1,000.  If each Linux distribution is at
the same user satisfaction level, say, where 0.1% of users decide to
post to the net about what they think is a bug, then one can expect
postings from one or zero people about each of the other distributions
and from ten different people about our system, just because there are
ten times as many people using it.  We ultimately benefit from this
because it means that a larger fraction of bugs that existed in a past
releases were detected and are fixed in the current release, and that
a larger fraction of the bugs in the current release are known.
I think that it is a tribute to this process that so many of the bugs
in the list Ian Parkin which you mentioned are trivialities, "user
error", "user preference", or "enhancement request" rather than
serious software malfunction.  For your reference, I have attached
Ian's list annotated with the current status of the bugs that he
mentioned ("WINTER 1994" is the name of the release which
will be out someday, probably in January).

The Kernel :-
==========

[01] : There are been various post regarding the kernel. Yggdrasil does claim 
        it to be 0.99.13 but it appears not to be judging, by the sources.
        I tried for several days to get the kernel to compile, before giving up
        and replacing the LGX kernel structure with the latest source from 
        tsx-11.mit.edu. This has enabled me to build my own kernel that is 
        smaller and loads a lot faster then the Yggdrasil kernel.

        I suspect that this is a problem with memory rather than with the

        lines may suffer from this problem. I found this problem on a

        I scan for any files I may require before ftping. ]
[TOO VAGUE TO REPRODUCE.]

[04] : The manual states 'Includes complete source code !'. Not quite
        true ( i.e. zsh ), but a significant amount.
[OPEN.  We will add zsh and minicom to the Winter 1994 release and
delete other programs.]

X Windows :-
=========

[01] : If you opt for the runtime installation not all of the X libraries in
        /usr/X386/lib are installed. They are correctly installed for the
        complete installation.
[USER ERROR.  runtime installation does not include compiler support,
so only the shared libraries without the stub files are supposed to be
installed.]

[02] : The xview library is broken. It is missing misc/gettext.c for starters.
[OPEN.  WINTER 1994 will use XView 3.2.  In future, please be more
specific.  "For starters" is too vague for us to investigate.]

[03] : The version of ldd is 1.1. Free-2.0 requires version 1.3. So if you 
        intend to port XFree86-2.0 make sure you get ldd 1.3 as well.
[USER ERROR/FIXED WINTER 1994.  FALL 1993 predates ldd 1.3 and XFree86
2.0.  Winter 1994 will contain ldd 1.3 and XFree86 2.0.]

[04] : The standard .fvwmrc assumes that the games directory is available in 
        ${PATH}. It doesn't appear to be, and some of the games will not start.
        [ Add /usr/games/bin to your ${PATH} environmental variable ]
[FIXED WINTER 1994.]

[05] : Resizing a window (fvwm window manager) causes vi (if running) to be
        terminated. Also occurs using twm under XFree-2.0.
        [ emacs allows resizing ]
[OPEN.  Isn't this a general elvis bug?]

[06] : The default .fvwmrc has entries for "olwm" and "olvwm" which doesn't
        appear to be in the appropriate path.
[FIXED WINTER 1994.]

[07] : The Xs3 server does not recognise the compressed fonts. This is dealt
        with in the Errata section of the LGX booklet. This caused me a
        minor inconvenience as I was forced to use the XF86_MONO server on
        my cd_dependent installation.
[ENHANCEMENT REQUEST.  Winter 1994 will use XFree86 2.0.]

[08] : It has been reported that running lemacs under the Xs3 server with a
        chipset of 'generic' declared in the Xconfig causes the lemacs process
        to freeze without the editor appearing. I myself run the Xs3 server
        and have no problem with running lemacs. I could however recreate this 
        problem using a cd_dependent installation and the XF86_MONO server.
        [ Use emacs ]
[OPEN.  This is problably once again lemacs hanging when it spawns a
child process.]

[09] : It has been reported that xconq will not run as the correct fonts are
        missing.
        [ I can run xconq with a few warnings about fonts ending with the
        message 'Substituting another font...' ]
[DELETED WINTER 1994.  Xconq is not free software.  Hopefully we won't
get our butts sued for accidentally leaving parts of it on the Fall
1993 release.]

[10] : It has been reported that X fails to recognise a PS/2 mouse. The
        contributor reported that using /dev/psmouse merely displayed
        characters on the screen and that 0.99.12 may fix the problem.
        [ IAP : /dev/psmouse does appear to have the correct major/minor. ]
[OPEN (fixed Winter 1994?) The Fall 1993 release has the PS-mouse
driver turned on but the travelmate mouse driver turned off (they were
mutually exclusive in 0.99.13).  Fall 1993 Revision B (0.99.14) has
both mice turned on.  Can someone who is experienceing this problem
please check to see if it is fixed?]

Miscellaneous Problems :-
======================

[01] : The rc.local file plays some music. If there is no sound board installed
        then the PC's speaker is used. This has caused at least one machine to
        lock up. 
        [ Comment out or delete the relevant lines in the /etc/rc.local file. ]
[FIXED WINTER 1994.  Turns out that the PC speaker driver can hang on
machines slower than 386DX40.]

[02] : Both the booklet & CD-ROM both state a minimum RAM requirement of 4 MB.
        This is the minimum required for gcc, and is below the minimum of 8 MB
        that is recommended in order to run X. Although not a problem this
        could be misleading.
[USER ERROR.  The hardware compatitibility list on the back of the
manual says "RAM: 4MB (8MB without swap partition)" and the manual
states in boldface on page 6 and again in boldface on page 8, "you
must allocate a swap partition in order for the installation process
to have enough memory to make your filesystems."]

[03] : There is a /usr/bin/rogue.exp file but no rogue :-(.
[DELETED WINTER 1994.]

[04] : Some manual pages are in the incorrect format or the man command is
        not expecting all possible formats :-

        # man modf
        syntax error near `(d'
        -c:1: `(cd /usr/man ; /usr/bin/gtbl e (david@prism.demon.co.uk)'

        [ nroff -man ./modf.3 > /tmp/modf; mv /tmp/modf ./modf.3 ]
[FIXED WINTER 1994.  Thanks to Normal Ramsey for diagnosing this as a
bug in GNU man and posting the fix.]

[05] : /usr/bin/robohunt expects /usr/games/fortune to exist. It doesn't. 
[OPEN.  Delete /usr/bin/robohunt?]

[06] : The user guest is gid 0 in /etc/passwd.
[ENHANCEMENT REQUEST, DECLINED.  More harm will be done to new users
to get an error message from su than to security-conscious users, who
will no doubt not want a publicly-accessible account like guest that
doesn't have a password.]

[07] : The Linux FAQ is stored both in it's entirety and split into 6 parts 
        thus wasting disk space.
[FIXED WINTER 1994.]

[08] : The booklet contains typos and the table of contents lists a different 
        chapter 12 than actually appears. 
[FIXED WINTER 1994.  Many typos have been fixed.  The table of
contents problem was a printing error.]

[09] : Occasionally the console gets into a mode where the keyboard does not
        autorepeat.
[UNABLE TO REPRODUCE.  Can you be more specific about what causes this
problem?]

[10] : The type of links used in the / directory have caused me problems and
        IMHO are 'unsound'. I have a complete installation on /dev/sda1 and
        a cd_dependent installation on /dev/sda3. When I boot using /dev/sda1
        and mount /dev/sda3 on /mnt I am unable to access /mnt/tmp as it is
        a soft link to /var/tmp. This should only be a problem if you have
        LGX installations on more than 1 partition.
        [ Delete and recreate all such links in / using ./ ( i.e. rm ./tmp;
        ln -s ./var/tmp ./tmp ) ]
[USER ERROR.  /tmp has to be world-writable; the CDROM is a read-only
root partition, and the ramdisk can be mounted on only one partition
(in this case, /var).]

[11] : less expects less.hlp to be in /usr/lib/less/less.hlp.
        [ Either recompile the supplied sources and alter the #define HELPFILE 
        to /usr/lib/less.hlp or 'mkdir /usr/lib/less; ln -s /usr/lib/less.hlp
        /usr/lib/less/less.hlp ]
[FIXED WINTER 1994.]

[12] : The /etc/wtmp file is not truncated/pruned by the rc file, whilst the 
        /etc/utmp file is.
        [ Add '/bin/echo -n > /etc/wtmp' to the /etc/rc file to truncate the 
        file. Alternatively 'cp /dev/null /etc/wtmp' ]
[USER ERROR. /etc/wtmp is a log file.]

[13] : Many of the executables in the bin directories ( /bin, /usr/bin etc )
        are not stripped. Some disk space can be saved by stripping them.
        [ See the manual page for strip and be *very* careful what you strip.
        Ordinary command such as chown, chmod, etc should be OK but I suspect
        stripping things such as shared libraries, etc could lead to problems ]
[FIXED WINTER 1994.]

[14] : The versions of mkfs.ext2, fdisk and lilo are fairly old. Problems may
        be encountered with certain hard disk sizes/geometries.
[OPEN.  I don't think this is true, but I'll check.]

[15] : mv /usr/net/man/cat1/telnet.0 /usr/net/man/cat1/telnet.1
[FIXED WINTER 1994.]
