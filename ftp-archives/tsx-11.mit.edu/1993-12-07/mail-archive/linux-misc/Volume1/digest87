You already CAN do this.  That is what the sunsite.unc.edu and
tsx-11.mit.edu archives are for.  The distributions are meant for people who
either do not have the resources (my case), ability (also WAS my case), or
time to put together *everything* one really needs to call their system a
fairly complete setup.  Can you imagine trying to get and install all 500+
utilities that come with SLS and propbably MCC?  Right there is a
compatiblity and standards mess i.e., /usr/bin or /usr/sbin, /usr/ucb, etc...

Subject: NFS performance under OS/2, Unix-Intel and its competitors
Date: 3 Sep 1993 01:40:00 GMT

        I am looking for a 32-bit OS/platform for an application of mine that
will be running large programs and read large data sets from NFS servers.
I know that I should consider getting a cheap Sun or the like, but at the
moment am considering an Intel box (e.g. Gateway 486/66 or similar) running
some PC OS.
        Actually the programs that I have run fine with a 32-bit DOS Extender.
BUT Sun's PCNFS is too slow: a factor of three slower than the same operation
on a Sparcstation 2, i.e. large NFS reads.

        I would appreciate it if some kind souls would run the simple program
I have below on OS/2 running NFS, any of the UNIXes on Intel (Solaris, SCO,
Linux, Next, etc.), Windows NT if possible, etc. I would like to know the
relative performance of large NFS reads on OS's available for PC's.

        Here are the numbers I have so far. The program is invoke as

        $ time nfsread BIG_NFS_FILE
        40 seconds                      (time for 10 reads)

        where BIG_NFS_FILE is the pathname of a large (>12Mb) file that sits on
some NFS server. I realize that there will be some effective depending on the
NFS server itself. I used a MVAXIII running Ultrix 4.3, and an SS2. 

        for a 1200000 byte read:
                                        Server: MVAX III        Server: SS2
        MVAXIII, Ultrix 4.3             7.0 sec                 4 sec
        Sparcstation 2                  3.2 sec                 2.2 sec
        486DX2/66, 3C509, DOS/Watcom    9.2 sec                 4 sec

        Note that I have found that for many CPU-intensive operations, a
486DX/66 is similar in speed to the SS2. But the PCNFS speed is very slow.
So I'm hoping that its the PCNFS implement and that a 32-bit implementation
like OS/2 or UNIX for Intel will be a lot faster.

        Please email responses and results. Thanks.

        No, by your qualifications DOS+Windows != OS.

        Windows does not do #5 if you take scheduling to be based on #2 in 
the first list.  ANY process can block ALL other processes under Windows if it
wants to (I know this as a developer of windows apps).

i don't like the idea, becuase SLS already does it's own distribution.  I don't
think it's fair that someone else should make money off of someone else's 
distribution...that's pretty cheesy IMHO.  Especially if he's making a profit
on it.  but on the other hand, they _did_ take the time to put it on diskette
for you; and people would like to have the cheapest way to get something w/out
doing it themselves sometimes, so, i guess, although i think it's cheesy, you
should go ahead & let them. (did that make sense?)

Subject: Re: Stacker-like Compression?

I realize that someone is going to have a field day flaming me for this
idea, but...

How about creating a device (ie /dev/chda1) that is compressed instead of
a file system?  Why bother with inodes and blocks and sectors?  Let the
user decide what file system to lay on the compressed drive and the file
system has no clue.  If the compressed drive isn't achieving the expected
ratio (set of course by a /bin/ctune or similar), then it just maps part
of the "drive" that the fs sees as bad.  If the ratio gets better, then
the chd device marks it good again.  This assumes that the standard fs's
can accept this kind of erratic "drive" behavior.  I'm also assuming that
the fs's aren't trying to optimize head movement across the platter (some
wired fs's on other platforms do).

SUMMARY:
Compressed "drive" device (ie /dev/chda1)  to replace regular drive device
(ie /dev/hda1) and allow fs's on top of it.  Blocks marked good/bad to fit
expected compression ratio.

Their motif is a resell of Micro-Link's Motif for linux.  They send 4
1.44 3.5" diskettes, two with the run-time stuff, and two with the dev-
elopment stuff.  I guess it is available on 5.25" too.  With that you
get a few pages of installation guide.  Other than that you are on
your own!  The ML package includes the OReilley and Assoc. Motif book
for their price.  Keep that in mind.  I also already had the book, so
I didn't need it.

I'm sorry to hear that your calls were not returned.  My many calls have
been returned, and I also got Dan on the phone, rather than the service
a number of times.  I don't know what he may do on a more full time basis.
But he has been generally available and reliable for my need, except, as
previously mentioned with the back version of the kernal in the SLS dist.
But his response was to offer me the next version when he gets it made up
at no additional cost. (I will return the first set of disks, when I get
the new ones.)

        I won't bother quoting, by now the original question has been repeated too
many times I think :-)

        However a suggestion, instead of trying to make a compressed filesystem
why not a compressed block device, divide each block into quarters, and allocate
1-4 quarters to a block on write out depending on how good the compression turns
out. Of course it would need a logical to physical translation table somewhere.
This approach should support ANY filesystem that can be mounted under Linux.

        Am I mad, or is this sort of thing the easiest answer ??

Well, then the operative word is just "compiled", not ported, eh?

I learned some tricks form the andrew newsgroup. If you have "almost"
enough space, you can go for a compile by just compiling some key things.

Someting like an EZLite[An Andrew ToolKit view (a footnote) was included

you can shrink what's installed by #undef'ing these tokens in
config/site.h:

#undef AMS_ENV
#undef METAMAIL_ENV
#undef CONTRIB_ENV
#undef MK_HELP
#undef MK_BASIC_INSETS
#undef MK_BLD_BLKS

... and rebuilding into a clean destination directory.  If you do this,
let me know the final size.

So, you bring over all 60 Meg of sources but you really only want a text
editor.  What's a guy to do?  After running imake at the top-level of
the sources, make all the Makefiles and remove everthing under the
