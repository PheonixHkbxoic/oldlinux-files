Didn't IBM own 20% of iNTEL.  Intel was getting beat by Zilog's z'80
cpu.  and was not the power house we know of today.  IBM bought intel
and asked for a 8-bit version of the 8086, the 8088.  intel delivered.

Yes and no.  The memory must reside on the motherboard, since the ISA
bus has only 24 address bits.  Other than that, no problem (slowness?).

The DMA seems to only be a problem with SCSI, since IDE/MFM/RLL drives
and controllers don't universally support DMA.  The linux SCSI drivers
are already clever enough to work around the DMA problem, so all you might
notice is some slowness.

Pretty sure I saw one live in '79.  I could be misremembering, though.

Yes --- but *after* Motorola told them they couldn't deliver.  In a sense, the
current arrangement with Motorola producing PowerPC chips for IBM is Motorola
(not to mention IBM) making up for Motorola's missing IBM's deadline for the
PC and thereby in effect forcing IBM to go with Intel... and thereby forcing
the bletcherous PC on *us*.  (Now if only it'd force Intel out of the
market....)

                                POLL RESULTS

    Well, for my first major poll I think I did pretty good.  There were
    approximately 213 respondants, we got lots of good stuff!

    There were a number of problems in the poll... answers not on lines
    containing "->" could not be handled.  There were two exceptions: 
    question:  questions 1F and 1D.   Answers placed next to the question 
    rather then to the right of the -> WERE handled.  Next time I will try
    to make it clear that you MUST answer to the right of the "->" fields.
    My statistics program doesn't care about other garbage to the left of
    the "->", but it needs the "->" to determine where the answer begins.

    People who removed or shortened the first line of the question... about 
    5 people, I think... sorry.

    I forgot to ask for serial and mouse info... maybe next time! (like in
    6 months to a year, or somebody else can poll for that info).

    In 1F I made the mistake of sayiung 'EISA or ISA computer? (if not 
    an intel 486)'.  486 machines CAN have ISA busses.  Fortunately, most
    people with that sort of setup typed in ISA anyway for that question.

    Also, some people put in long answers for questions expecting short
    answers... those stats will get chopped off a bit in the generated tables,
    sorry.

    THE POLL RESULTS ARE POSTED IN THE MAIN LINUX GROUPS AND ARE ALSO 
    AVAILABLE VIA ANONYMOUS FTP.  THE ORIGINAL MAIL MINUS THE HEADERS
    IS ALSO AVAILABLE VIA ANONYMOUS FTP:
