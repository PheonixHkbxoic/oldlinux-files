Can someone point me towards good technical docs and explanations of all
this technical momo-jumbo on all the video boards?   I'm looking for the
ultimate VLB board for Linux w/X and MS-Windows, but I don't know how
to evaluate them.  I'll check the AccelCards database, naturally.

Thank you.

Yes  that does sound like a nasty bug!  Such non-sense is better
put in something like /examples/cshrc.  The purpose of a /etc/csh.cshrc
and /etc/profile should be to:
   1. Set reasonable defaults.
   2. Possably a test if this is an interactive login, for checking new
      system news messages and other highly immortant information.
   3. Possably provide new users some sort of help message.
   4. Add aliases only if they are normally part of the standard shell
      environment on other systems.  i.e. "alias pwd 'echo $PWD'" is
      acceptable, but "alias h 'history'" could well break people's
      scripts  or cause unexpected results.

If I remember right /usr/include/linux is not suppose to be a
link!  It does work if you make it a link, but might cause problems.
Anyways the question is if this was fixed.  SLS has had this type
of problem for years, but Peter just ignores most problem reports.
He will however respond if:
  1) You make the fix very specific, with a very good reason why
     that is the right way to do it.
  2) You add a sense of ergency.

i.e. When I e-mailed him that the version of vgaset he initially 
included with SLS contain no warnings, but would likely fry many
people's monitor, he was very quick to replace it the the SLS
format tgz file I supplied.  Obcourse, it still isn't quite right
since he has never deleted the old manual page from the other 
package, and I had accidently type tabs in the modified man
page making it hard to read.

Not neccissarily.  It seems that it is possable to have a pin on
a ramchip bent, or other such problems that Linux will detect but
MSDOS won't.  We would really need more information to determine
if the Slackware distribution was at fault, the Linux kernel, or
a hardware problem.  Remember that we can't hold Slackware responcable
if the BETA kernel they distribute doesn't always work the way we
want it to.  We can hold them responcable if there is both a known
problem with a known fix, but nothing is done.

Hmm, again this does sound like a real problem.  Again the question
is if it is a hardware problem or a software problem.  Is it  that
something is installed improperly, or is it that it hasn't been
disigned to work the way they are trying to use it?  My guess is
they are trying to use the wrong device as the modem.  Obviously
if this is the case, the thing to fix is the Slackware's installation
so that /dev/modem points to the right device.

>Your are welcome to tell us about your problems with Slackware
>(especially if your name starts with Andre). When we have listed
>42 problems, we will e-mail them to slackware-bug-report@imaginary.foo.bar. 

Why not send them off now?  The sooner they know about them the
sooner they  will get fixed.  Besides, it is better to have the
person with the problem contact them directly.   They need the
detailed information that only that person can tell  them.

i.e. It doesn't help to e-mail:
"Seyon doesn't  work for a friend of mine with lots of memory..."

So, what do they do to fix it?  When they start seyon on one of the
Slackware test machines with lots of memory it works fine.  So the
only hope is  if they can send something like more detailed like:

"I started seyon from an xterm running tcsh with the command:
  seyon -modem /dev/rsd5
and seyon reported no such device.  I copied the default .seyon to my
home directory.  My modem is a TexFlacter 14319bps."

So now they try the same thing and even if it still works on there system
they'll now have a clue as to what to check.   Is there a problem with
/dev/rsd5, are the default scripts good for a texflacter?  Can seyon
support 14319bps?
 
                                   Bill

Most (if not all) modern hard drives park themselves automatically
every time they're shut off...you shouldn't need to do anything
special before moving your machine.

No. There is DFN, and there is Xlink which has a POP in Castrop-
Rauxel, just 5 km north of where I live. Mathias Urlichs (who posts
on c.o.l.*) will probably comment about Xlink if he reads your or
my posting.

Dr. Materna in Dortmund had at least Usenet access via ISDN for
quite some time. But basically you're right, Germany is an expensive
place for people using nets and other computer related things.

Slackware is much more up to date.  It is also easier to install from my 
own experience installing both packages.  SLS is not particulary bad 
really.  But Slackware is just that much better.  Plus it has about 40 MB 
more material on the same number of 3.5" disks (SLS 3.5" disks only have 
1.2 megs filled on each disk).  But if all you have is a 5.25" drive SLS 
works fine.

Hello,

Perhaps what I am about to request is documented but I just can't find it.
On many occasions I would have liked to consult a site which holds
an archive for Comp.os.linux.announce. Is there such a site ?
If so could you please forward it.

At the moment I am looking for the address of the following two
companies distributing Linux:
 
                 TransAmeriTech
                 Nascent (sp?)

I would be grateful to anyone who could provide them.

Thank you,

Eric

Sorry to have asked the question. I finally found a reference in Appendix
B of the Linux Installation Guide and Getting Started. 
/pub/Linux/docs/linux-announce.archive at sunsite.unc.edu.
Mr. Welsh thank you for the book and your moderation of the announce
group. On my part I'll be more thourough in my reading.

Salut,

Eric

Yow!  you keep that rate up, and you will ship ~90k CD's in a year.
That is serious volume.

Hmmm...  I am curious how you can estimate the shipping volume of
other people...  My guess would have been that the total number of
Linux CD's shipped so far would be higher than 9,000...
