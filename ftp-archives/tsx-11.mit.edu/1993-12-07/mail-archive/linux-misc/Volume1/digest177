YAV for fvwm.  it's very simple to use, looks a lot better than twm and
saves lots more memory than others like it. I've even started using it on

Remove the TAB at the start of line 309. There may be spaces but a tab
is considered to appear only before commands. I guess you'd better
remove the tab from Imakefile.

I just hate when this happens, it has happened to me just too many
times by now.

Mv & cp both died with "i/o error' despite much space.
The system was not heavily loaded; in fact barely loaded at all.

This under 99.13, 1542B controller, 16 meg RAM.

And the 1542C seems unreliable under linux.  At least mine is.

I have 2 SCSI disks and one of Dr. John's Tandberg SCSI tapes.  Works
fine under MSDOS, but I see SCSI timeout errors when using the tape
under Linux.  When this occurs with a 1542C, the 1542C locks up solid.

After SCSI timeout error and lockup under linux, the 1542C is unable
to recognize SCSI devices after either a command-line reboot or a
reset-switch reboot.  The 1542C needs removal and reapplication of
power to return to usefulness.

I replaced the 1542C with a 1540B in hopes that it would cure my problems.
With the 1540B I still see the SCSI timeout errors under linux but the
controller doesn't lock up.

>   by Johan Myreen and co)

This mouse driver was written for the TI TravelMate and Gateway Nomad
notebooks, which use a chipset from Chips & Tecnologies. These
machines use a PS/2 type mouse, but the mouse is not connected to the
keyboard controller chip as usual.

The Linux PS/2 mouse driver in 0.99PL13 has been enhanced to handle
the new interface in addition to the normal PS/2 auxiliary device
port.  Because of the similarity between a "normal" PS/2 mouse and the
new interface the new driver is "piggybacked" on the old driver. This
means the major and minor numbers have not changed. The numbers are
major: 10, minor: 1. The protocol is also the same (PS/2) so the
following line in Xconfig works:

PS/2 "/dev/psaux"

(or /dev/whatever with major/minor numbers 10/1. The name doesn't
actually matter as long as the device numbers are correct.)

Configuring the kernel for a QuickPort implicitly configures it for a
standard PS/2 mouse too. If configured for a QuickPort mouse, the
kernel tries first to look for a new style mouse port and, failing
that, installs the "normal" PS/2 mouse driver. Running a kernel
configured for a QuickPort mouse on a machine with a traditional PS/2
mouse port should work ok: the kernel first probes for a new mouse
port, and when it can't find one installs the normal PS/2 driver. As
usual, the detection code poking around might cause conflicts on some
machines -- reconfigure and recompile without the QuickPort code.

The name QuickPort is actually misleading, since it is really the name
of the connector type used in the Travelmate and a number of other
notebooks, not the interface (chipset) type. The Travelmate just
happened to introduce both in the same machine.

HOW TO POST TO COMP.OS.LINUX.ANNOUNCE

This article gives info on how and what to post to comp.os.linux.announce.
Please read the whole thing, to avoid any confusion. :)

To submit an article to this group, please mail the article to:
        linux-announce@tc.cornell.edu

If you have questions or problems with posting to comp.os.linux.announce,
please send mail to the moderators at:
        linux-announce-request@tc.cornell.edu
Or, you may send mail to us directly. The moderators for this group are
Matt Welsh (mdw@sunsite.unc.edu) and Lars Wirzenius (wirzeniu@cc.helsinki.fi).

Whereas most versions of the C-News news software will automatically mail
postings to the moderator address, it may take some time for this address
to propagate (and there are many systems out there not supporting this
automatic mailing feature). Therefore, to ensure that your posting will get
to us, you should probably mail it to us by hand. Once we receive your article
and approve it, we will post your article.

NOTE: Your article will not show up in any newsgroups that it may be
crossposted to (e.g. other than comp.os.linux.announce) until we approve the
article. The delay should be negligible (we read email all the time), so
please don't post the same article separately to other groups. That
causes multiple copies to be sent around under most setups.

Please don't crosspost articles between comp.os.linux.announce and 
other Linux newsgroups (excepting very important announcements, namely the 
Linux FAQ, new kernel/library releases, and others which I'll crosspost at 
my discretion :) ). If enough c.o.l.a articles end up in junk on sites 
which don't carry the group, maybe they'll start to carry it.

If you don't get c.o.l.a at your site, please encourage your news admin to
create it. It's a bona fide group and we need to get wider distribution.

Remember: no announcement is too insignificant for this group. Don't be
afraid to submit something if you think it isn't important enough; that's
why we have moderators, to screen the content of the group. I plan to 
approve almost anything (announcement-wise) that's submitted.

The following guidelines should be used when submitting articles:

  - I will approve a wide range of articles for this group. The only postings
    that are discouraged are discussions and questions about Linux. 
    This group is mainly for:

    * Announcements of new software that has been ported to Linux
      (e.g. "DikuMUD v4.2 is now available on sunsite....")

    * Announcements of new versions or patchlevels of existing software,
      such as GCC, the kernel, libraries, new versions of utilities and so on.
      (e.g. "Linux v1.0 is finally available...")

    * Bug fixes and software patches (or announcements of available patches).
      If you have a fix for a known bug in any Linux software, please post
      the fix and the relevant patch (if any). If the patch is huge, instead
      post an announcement as to where it's available.
      (e.g. "Patch to fix broken 0.98.5 scsi.c....")

    * Summaries of responses for individual requests for information. If you
      requested some Linux-related information on c.o.l.h, and are posting a
      summary of that information, please submit it to c.o.l.a. 
      (e.g. "Summary: What's the best VGA card for Xfree86?")

    * Just about anything else of any importance. If you're not sure if you
      should post the article to c.o.l.a, submit it anyway. It can't hurt,
      and most of the time your article will be approved anyway.

  - When submitting articles, please include valid Newsgroups, Subject,
    Keywords, From, and Date lines in the header. These may either be in
    the mail header itself, or you may simply include the article, header
    and all, in the body of the mail message. Please don't send mail with
    only the body of the article to be posted, as this doesn't include
    the Newsgroups: line and other article-specific information.

  - When submitting articles, please use a descriptive Subject line. 
    If you crosspost the article to other groups, starting your subject with
    "ANNOUNCEMENT" helps it to stick out in those groups. If you're posting a 
    patch or summary, use "SUMMARY" or "PATCH" at the beginning of your
    subject, as "ANNOUNCEMENT" isn't quite appropriate.

  - Also, please use a Keywords line in your header, so that articles may
    be searched more easily in the archives (when we have the archives up).
    The Keywords field should contain one or more of the following:
      Type of announcement: new version, patch, urgent, summary, etc.
      Package: kernel, GCC, X, TeX, SLS, jump tables, etc.
      Type of program: A keyword or two on what your program is.
        This is especially important if the program isn't part of
        a well-known package. Ex: editor, tcpip utils, game, etc.
      Version: 0.98.5, jumptables 4.2, etc.

    For example, if you're announcing v4.2 of Shoopsort for Linux, you
    might want a subject and keywords that look like this:
      Subject: ANNOUNCEMENT: Shoopsoft v4.2 now ported to Linux
      Keywords: Shoopsort 4.2, sorting algorithm, new port

    Or, if you're announcing a summary on ethernet cards for Linux, you
    could have:
      Subject: SUMMARY: Best ethernet cards for Linux TCP/IP
      Keywords: summary, ethernet, tcpip, cards, hardware

If you have any problems or questions, please contact the moderators at
linux-announce-request@tc.cornell.edu. 

Thanks,
Matt Welsh, comp.os.linux.announce moderator

                 Welcome to the comp.os.linux.* hierarchy!

Background
=========================================================================
        This posting is an introduction to the comp.os.linux.* hierarchy 
        of USENET newsgroups. 

        Linux is a free implementation of UNIX for 80386/80486 machines 
        covered by the GNU GPL. Most of the development of the Linux 
        kernel has been done by Linus Torvalds, an internationally 
        reknowned UNIX wizard from Helsinki, Finland.

        For the past two years or so, the newsgroup comp.os.linux has 
        grown be one of the most popular groups on USENET. Late in 1992, 
        a CFV for splitting comp.os.linux was posted; the only group which 
        passed was comp.os.linux.announce, a moderated newsgroup for Linux 
        announcements and patches.

        Six months later, during the summer of 1993, another CFV for 
        splitting comp.os.linux was posted. The voting period for the 
        comp.os.linux reorganization results ended at 23:59:59 UTC on 
        4 August 1993 (4:59PM US Pacific Time, 7:59PM US Eastern Time.) 
        The results are as follows:

        comp.os.linux reorganization results - 1842 votes

         Yes   No  : 2/3? >100? : Pass? : Group
         ---- ---- : ---- ----- : ----- : -------------------------------
         1692  135 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.admin
         1741   90 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.development
         1647  177 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.help
         1660  155 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.misc


        Because of this split, the newsgroup comp.os.linux will be 
        deleted on 11 November 1993. The new newsgroups will be created 
        on 11 August 1993. This posting describes these newsgroups, 
        including comp.os.linux.announce, which will remain entact.


General Policy
=========================================================================
        The general policy for the Linux newsgroups is simple. Who sets
        the policy? We all do. All of us on USENET are interested in
        communicating openly about a number of topics. That's why we
        have USENET. If you want the Linux newsgroups to work for you,
        a few suggestions:

        * Read the Linux FAQ and follow the newsgroups for some time 
          before posting questions. This is very important. comp.os.linux 
          suffered from HUGE amounts of noise and traffic because much 
          of the growing readership never bothered to READ the newsgroup;
          they only posted questions.
          
          The same thing will happen with the new newsgroups unless you 
          read the FAQ (found on sunsite.unc.edu in the file 
          pub/Linux/docs/FAQ) and read the newsgroup for some time before 
          posting questions. Chances are, your question has already been
          recently answered, and a simple browsing of the newsgroup
          will answer it. We suggest using a threaded newsreader such as
          "trn" which will allow you to browse and mark articles by 
          subject, so you don't have to read each and every article in
          each newsgroup.

        * Crossposting between the Linux newsgroups is STRONGLY 
          discouraged. If you do crosspost questions between Linux 
          newsgroups, expect to be flamed to oblivion. The reason we
          have a newsgroup split is to categorize discussions into 
          separate newsgroups. Crossposting negates this effect. 
          If your posting cannot fit into ONE of the newsgroups
          c.o.l.admin, c.o.l.help, or c.o.l.development, then you 
          should post it to c.o.l.misc. 

          The one exception is for announcements. Occasionally, an
          important announcement (such as this one) will be crossposted
          between c.o.l.announce and one or more of the other c.o.l.*
          groups. These announcements must be approved by the .announce
          moderator; see below.

        * Reply to questions via e-mail if at all possible. While 
          discussion in the newsgroups is encouraged, if someone is
          asking a simple question to which the answer is well-known,
          there is no reason to post the reply. Don't assume that 
          the person posting the question actually reads the newsgroup
          or will even note your followup if they do. Reply via e-mail
          unless the reply is of general interest. 

        * Don't flame newbies. Over the course of the past few months,
          the Linux community has developed an oversensitive ego and
          a reputation for being unfriendly towards newcomers, mostly
          because of unwarranted flaming by a handful of righteous 
          individuals. If someone posts, saying, "Hi! I'm new to
          this group! What is Linux?" (which will inevitably happen
          as the new newsgroups are propagated), DO NOT FLAME THEM.
          When someone sees a new newsgroup pop up within "rn", they
          are justifiably curious about the new group and probably
          don't know that well over 80,000 people who know EVERYTHING
          about Linux read the group. Right? 

          Instead of being rude, you can send a polite note to the
          poster, saying, "Hello, Linux is a free implementation of
          UNIX for the 386 and 486. You can get the FAQ from 
          sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/docs. Let me know if I can
          be of help!". That's all. Not difficult, eh? You can even
          save your stock reply in a file and simply send form-letters
          to newbies if you wish. But there is very little point in
          flaming or ever being rude. It goes against everything that
          Linux can and should be. 

          Just remember that nobody knows everything---not even Linus---
          and that you were a newbie once, too. :)


comp.os.linux.announce
=========================================================================
        Comp.os.linux.announce is a moderated newsgroup for Linux 
        announcements and source patches. The purpose of this group was
        to get all of the ``important'' Linux information out of the
        regular newsgroup and into a place where all Linux users could see
        the important announcements without having to wade through a 
        jungle of other postings. So far, this group has been very 
        successful. 

        The moderators for this group are myself (Matt Welsh, 
        mdw@sunsite.unc.edu) and Lars Wirzenius (wirzeniu@cc.helsinki.fi). 
        We will be sharing the moderator duty, and backing each other up 
        to make sure that postings to this group will be approved as soon 
        as possible after they're submitted.

        Submissions to this group should be mailed to the address:
                linux-announce@tc.cornell.edu

        If you have any problems or questions about c.o.l.announce, please 
        send mail to the moderators at
                linux-announce-request@tc.cornell.edu
        Or simply mail us directly. This is not a request address for 
        mailing list subscription; see below.

        A separate posting details the guidelines for submitting to this 
        group.  I plan to approve just about anything that's posted to this 
        group, except for questions or discussions about Linux. So, please, 
        post away.  :)

        There are also archives of comp.os.linux.announce available at a 
        number of Linux FTP sites: check 
                sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/linux-announce.archive

        There is a mailing list mirror of the comp.os.linux.announce 
        newsgroup; to join, send mail to
                linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi
        With the line
                X-Mn-Admin: join ANNOUNCE
        at the top of the body (not in the subject). Approved postings to 
        c.o.l.announce will automatically be mailed to this mailing list 
        channel.


comp.os.linux.admin     
=========================================================================
        This newsgroup was created simply to thwart the unique newsgroup
        acronym "c.o.l.a", previously used by c.o.l.announce. However,
        this newsgroup is also used for discussions and questions about
        running Linux systems, either in a single-user or multi-user
        environment.

        Clearly, there is no large distinction between c.o.l.admin and
        c.o.l.help. However, .admin should be mostly used for discussions
        about RUNNING Linux, not USING or PROGRAMMING it. Unfortunately,
        especially with Linux, the line between system administrator and
        system user is very fuzzy. In short, we anticipate c.o.l.admin
        to be mostly about questions with installing, setting up, and
        configuring Linux systems, as well as other discussions relating
        to system administration. 


comp.os.linux.development
=========================================================================
        c.o.l.development, or "c.o.l.d" for short, is a newsgroup for 
        questions and discussions about Linux kernel and systems-level 
        development. Please note that this is a newsgroup about 
        development OF Linux, not development FOR Linux. In other words, 
        c.o.l.d isn't for questions about programming or porting software 
        to Linux. Instead, this is a newsgroup for discussions about 
        developing the Linux kernel itself, including writing device 
        drivers, adding new features, and so on. In addition, discussions
        about development of shared libraries, and other essential 
        systems-level projects, are welcome here. 

        Hopefully, this newsgroup will embody some of the content and
        scope of the linux-activists mailing list channels such as GCC, 
        KERNEL, SCSI, and NET.


comp.os.linux.help
=========================================================================
        Comp.os.linux.help is perhaps the most general of Linux 
        newsgroups. It is for any general user, programming, or 
        setup questions and discussion about Linux. If your question
        is about Linux development, post to c.o.l.development. If
        it is about system administration, post to c.o.l.admin. 
        However, if your question is of a more general nature, such
        as "How do I set up Linux for use with an NE2000 card?",
        c.o.l.help is your place. 

        Remember that you should not crosspost between .help and
        other Linux newsgroups. This means that if you are asking for
        help in .development, that's fine, but .help is for those
        questions which don't fit into .admin and .development.


comp.os.linux.misc
=========================================================================
        This group is the canonical ``catch-all'' for discussions and 
        questions which don't fit into the other Linux newsgroups.
        While c.o.l.help is generally for questions, c.o.l.misc is for
        discussions of a general nature about Linux, such as setting up
        a file hierarchy standard, questions about Linus' personal life
        and virtual beer, and the inevitable flame war. Again, it should 
        be noted that crossposting between c.o.l.misc and other Linux 
        newsgroups is strongly discouraged. If your posting or question 
        does not fit into ONLY ONE of the other Linux newsgroups, post 
        it to .misc.


Comments
=========================================================================
