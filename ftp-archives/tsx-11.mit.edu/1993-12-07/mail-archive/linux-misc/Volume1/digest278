Subject: Kernel Paging Request failure with mtools
Date: Fri, 5 Nov 1993 17:24:55 GMT

When I am using mdir and mcopy, my machine crashes with the following error 
message about half the time.  It doesn't seem to happen whilst running any other 
programs.

Unable to handle kernal paging request at address C0000000

Kernal panic: Trying to free up swapper memory space
In swapper task - not syncing

If I am running X, the machine sometimes just freezes when I am using mtools.  I
presume the same thing is happening, but the error message is hidden.

I am running a Dan 66Mhz 486DX2 with 8MB of Ram.  I have a VL-bus IO controller
which runs my single 1.44MB FDD, and my 2 IDE hard disks Drive hda is used 
for MSDOS, and drive hdb is used for Linux.  I have a 16MB swap partition (hdb6), 
and am running SLS 1.03 with a pl13 kernel.  The error message also occurred with 
the SLS 1.03 standard pl12 kernel.   I also have a VL-bus S3 card, and a Gravis
Ultrasound card, but the error occurred before I installed the sound card.


Any help would be appreciated.

Subject: 'protecting' areas of physical memory?
Date: Fri, 5 Nov 1993 18:28:35 GMT

Is there a way to build a linux kernel that avoids specific
physical address ranges?  For example, in my old ESIX 5.3.2d,
there is a file available at boot-time describing the available
memory layout.

I'd like to experiment to see if I can get linux to run with
my cache enabled by simply having it never use the parts of
memory that seem to crash linux when running with cache. (Yes,
it does appear that I have to avoid using cache on specific
areas of my memory {and not just for linux}, and without cache,
I get a lot of NMI errors with my old motherboard/memory
combination. sigh.)

OK.  But it's hard to take the project seriously when you insist on
calling it a cutesy name like "The Hurd" rather than just "Hurd."  Are
there other operating systems called "Hurd" from which you are trying
to differentiate your project?  "Oh, this isn't just any Hurd, it's
THE Hurd."

It sounds too much like Mr. Trump, AKA "The Donald."

Note: I am a happy Linux Enthusiast. 

On Microkernels being "slow", what about all the Mach Microkernel conf.
papers that say that use of Continuations etc. ukernels are now
"nearly as fast" as fast monolithic kernel. Surely it is a bit early
to conclude that ukernels would never be as fast as monolithic
kernels.

I was wonder where could I get some information on the API (is this what
its called?) of linux.  In addition, I found information on gas, however, it
was formatted using tex and I do not have the desire to try to run it through
tex and print it out on someone else's printer.  Is there a document that
is in plain text?  Finally, is there some utilities written for linux so
that I can use my sound card?

Thanks in advance,

From my personal experience that seems to be supported by concensus on this
newsgroup the absolute best service is offered by Trans-Ameritech. They ship
the same day, take all forms of payment and return email within 24 hours.
They even offer their product at half price to users of other Linux cdroms.
That makes it $15 for you - a steal for a great product.

Apparently you haven't heard of Brian "Performance" Bershad's work at
CMU.  May I direct your attention to mach.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mach/public/doc
for many papers on the performance of microkernels (actually just mach).
You may want to read the papers with "Performance" in the title.

Actually, drivers do not have to be present in the kernel (other than disk
and terminal support).  The rest may be dynamically loaded as is done
in AIX 3.X.X.  I hope that eventually Mach will be modified so that
it will have this feature.  It makes for a smaller kernel, since you
do not have a kernel that supports 100 devices you do not have.  Nor do
you have to rebuild the kernel if you add a new device, just toss it in
the proper directory and the kernel will take care of it at boot time.
Convenient, eh?

   Well, acroding to studies by CMU a microkernel -- server

   were run on a Sun 3/60) in the compilation test and is 3% slower in
   the file system test.

But, but, but...

Sun OS is horrifyingly slow.  Their file system is painful.  I use a
Sparc2 at work and Linux at home.  Although the raw speed of the two
machines is not terribly different (the Sun is a little faster on most
CPU benchmarks), the Linux machine is infinitely more responsive than
the Sun even with less memory.  It's like night and day.

These kind of comparisons remind of the days when everyone compared
their fancy new C compilers to pcc and bragged about what wonderful
optimizers they had.  It'll be a cold day in hell when I switch to a
file system 3% slower than Sun's.

I.e. If we had Hurd now, we'd have a compressed filesystem just like

Not until you start using machines with more than one processor, which

I look at Hurd [[Fade in that AT&T music... :)]] as what I'll probably
using in the early 21st century... Linux right now, is like a test
harness for the rest of the GNU software-- when the rest of the Hurd
servers and a ready-to-install Mach microkernel for use with Hurd is
ready, everything else will be "tight" and "sleak."  No one is making
you wait for Hurd, you have Linux right now. When Hurd's ready, you
can take all the software you used for Linux, and use it on the Hurd.

Everyone should stop arguing over whether or not they want to support
FreeBSD, Linux, or the vaporific-Hurd and use what works for them.
There isn't a whole lot of difference between them.  Make your
improvements now on what you run, keep notes, craft killer
applications, keep them as portable as possible, and prepare for the
day where you move out of your efficiency apartment into your
skyscraper, moving the furniture with you.

It's called the placebo effect.

That's why green markers make your CD's sound better.

If you put the exact same binaries on disk with patched version
