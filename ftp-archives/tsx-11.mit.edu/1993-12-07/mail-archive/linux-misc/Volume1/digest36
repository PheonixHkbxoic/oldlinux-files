No you don't need to be root these days. Anyone can build per application
shared libraries. However you don't need to. The Linux memory manager does it
all correctly anyway.

SLS comes with an MPEG player. The berkeley MPEG encoder compiles under
Linux. (Haven't run it yet). It has sound card support.
There is _NO_ multimedia support in the NT kernel, its shared library (DLL)
support.

These articles are forgeries.  Notice the difference between the paths
in a 'Brian Leary' article and another by a real world.std.com account.

There isn't anything in common between the two paths.  Now to see a
little more, here is the headers from a 'Brian Leary' article
from another machine.

Here you can see that the only things in common between the two paths is
the ucivax!gateway.  A quick check in the spool for other articles with
this in their path reveals Steve McMahon has the same termination of his
path in comp.os.linux.misc, in comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy there is also
one non-'Brian Leary' article from ucivax!gateway (and from the same
site as Steve).  This one is a bit more interesting.

Seems pretty likely that the original poster of this little piece of
flame-bait and the person forging the articles are the same person.
The site is LaUNChpad, I don't know how easy it is to forge articles
from there, but I don't any other possibilities.  There are probably
others out there who could say more about this.  But then again I
don't know that this guy is worth the effort.

I guess I'll take off my amateur sleuth hat and ignore this guy, he's
had more fun out of this than he deserves.

The attribution is there. In fact Patrick even acknowledges that he started
from SLS in his announce file. The copyrights are in place for doinstall 
even to the "freely distribute, don't restrict" line in it. Kind of ironic.

I'm selling my DELL Unix SVR4, Issue 2.2. Included is:

        Installation disks (3.5 and 5.25)
        Installation tape (250M QIC and 2G DAT)
        Unlimited user upgrade
        "Working with Dell Unix"
        Release notes, etc.

This all costs about $1700 (Cdn) from Dell ($1000 (Cdn) if you have them
install it on a Dell purchased machine).

I'm asking $900 (Cdn) OBO. I'm selling because I need the cash (DELL Unix
works wonderfully, it hasn't crashed on me yet - I've been up since December
1992).

Interested parties can e-mail me at barker@enel.ucalgary.ca

Most of this speedup is very likely due to the quality of the 386-specific
C compiler used on BSD.  But then, that *is* a valid thing to include in
many such comparisms.  However, were the program built for MSDOS with a compiler
that generated code of similar quality, the two run-times (excluding any IO)
would then compare much more closely.  With a decent MSDOS cache (HYPERDISK)
even the I/O would be as good for DOS as for BSD (if not better).

It IS not even a problem, I'm using one right now, without problems

I think xv run under X11.  If you don't want to run X11, try spic.  It's 
available on sunsite.

Nope, nothing to do with that fuckhead. The header you see is because
I'm using the mail gateway. It does seem possible, however, to forge
articles, I just checked, so I suspect he does.

Subject: Bug: 0.99pl12 falsely reports 'Device or resource busy'
Date: 21 Aug 1993 22:07:24 GMT


 I posted about this once and got no answers, but it is hard to
believe I am the only one facing this problem.

 After upgrading to pl12 (from pl10) I am no longer able to umount
file systems, even when they are not being used. It doesn't happen all
the time but if there was any activity at all in the file system being
umounted, (previously, not while umounting it) chances are I won't 
be able to umount it. When I boot the old kernel (pl10) everything 
runs smoothly.

 It happens at least with minix and ext2 file systems, both in the
hard disk and in floppies.

 As for my setting:

 0.99pl12 compiled with gcc2.4.5 and number of tasks
(in tasks.h) increased to 128. Got many warnings in the compilation
(unsigned to signed pointer and so on) but otherwise was normal.

 libc4.4.2 from SLS 1.03

 Tried several different versions of the mount/umount commands. 

 If anyone has run into this, please let me know.
