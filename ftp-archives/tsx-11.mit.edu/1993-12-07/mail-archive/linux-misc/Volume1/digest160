        I do, BSD/386 is the other name for BSDI, a commercial port of
Net/2 to the 386 platform.  Not bad, as a commerical unix, if I were buying
one, it's the one I would buy.  As I don't have a spare $1000, I'm running
linux tho.

In an earlier message, I said I was having trouble compiling 'procps'
v.8.  It turns out there is a bug in the kernel header files in 
linux < p13.  Having just installed the updated kernel source files,
I have been able to successfully compile 'procps'.

Thanks to those who responded to my query.

Subject: SVGA Card Recommendations?
Date: Sun, 26 Sep 1993 06:29:14 GMT


I'm trying to decide on a video board to purchase for use on my new 
486DX-50 machine that I recently purchased.  I'm looking for the best
recommendation that someone can give me for an ISA(uggh) SVGA video
board.   I'm not heavy into windows so, S3 doesn't thrill me.  I'm 
looking for board in the $100-$250 range that gives me good DOS-based
performance (ie, running Flight simulator 5.0) and good X11 performance
under XFree running Linux.  From what I've seen and read I know that I'm
limited in my choices for XFree and as far as I can tell, the ET-4000/w32
chipset seems to be a preferred.  So the question stands, if you were to
buy and ISA SVGA card for XFree (mainly) what would you go with?   Along
the same lines, I do have a cheapo Trident 8900C that works, what type of
performance increase would I see using the ET-4000 based card?  Finally,
since ET-4000 seems to be very popular, what SVGA cards use this chipset?
Does the Diamond series?  I can get a good price on aiamond SpeedStar
24X card.  Will it work with Xfree and is it a good deal or would you 
recommend something else?


Thanks for any an all help. If you've got a card you like, let me

With one or two minor exceptions that you won't run into (ie, single 
initiator systems where the host has no ID, non-arbitrating systems),
as long as the software has been done right (no SCSI-II specific 
commands or features like tagged queueing are attempted on SCSI-I
devices, and the lun field of the CDB is filled in for compatability),
SCSI-II is 100% backwards with SCSI-I, and you should have no problem 
using a SCSI-II disk with a SCSI-I host or vice versa.

Yes, synchronous, fast synchronous, and wide transfers are negotiated
on a per target basis.  Ie, the SCSI controller can use a different
set of parameters for each disk, tape, or CD on the bus.

In the real world, you see about 60% more bandwidth with fast SCSI.
While sync. SCSI is spec'd to 5M/sec, and fast SCSI-II to 10M/sec, 
I've seen many installations where it won't run over 8M/sec.

If you're only putting a couple of disks (typical headrates are
about 2M/sec) on it, you won't see any performance increase.


>)Substantial?  Does it require a DOS driver to get the performance?

As far as I know, no vendors offer  a fast SCSI board in ISA - 
it's not spec'd to over 5.7M/sec, so the gain would be negligible.

Not really.  There's one type of SCSI-2 : SCSI-2.  SCSI-2 specifies 
a number of optional features - asynchronous event notification, support
for multiple processes on a device, fast SCSI, wide SCSI, etc, you can 
have all or a combination of them.

No.  Some workstations run fast/wide busses, and every wide SCSI chip
I've seen (ie, the NCR53c720) has aslo supported fast & wide.

It doesn't exist, all sync data rates > 5M/sec are out of spec in
SCSI-I, rates of 5-10Mhz are only allowed under FAST SCSI-2

yes.

Sync SCSI is only spec'd to 5M/sec, although on short cables some async.
implementations have sustained 6M/sec.

The bottleneck is not the bus - we've achieved transfer rates of 
1.5-2M/sec through a dumb Adaptec 1520 board across the ISA bus.  
With a couple of devices, your throughput won't be limited by
an ISA SCSI board.

However, a larger percentage of the available bandwidth (5.7M/sec
with ISA, 33M/sec with EISA) will be used up for slower busses, 
degrading video and interactive performance on systems that don't
snoop.

If you have a pair of 2M/sec drives running on an ISA bus, you've
lost 2/3 of your bandwidth.  If you peripherials on an EISA bus in
the same system, only 1/3 of that bandwidth remains - ie 11M/sec 
or whatever.

No.  Parts is parts, as long as you stick to the defined 
commands, and there isn't a firmware bug (SCSI-II devices 
aren't immune to this - we just saw a SCSI-II disk that did no
deffect handling, and locked up when told to do linked commands 
although it claimed to support them) you'll be fine.

With the exception of a few very broken things that SCSI-I allowed
that aren't allowed in SCSI-II (single initiator, no address for 
the host, non-arbitrating systems) a SCSI-I controller can talk
to a SCSI-II device (it's really just a superset of SCSI-I)

This predates SCSI-I, and is a software problem, not hardware.  Cache 
coherency keeps you from sharing disks under most real operating systems.

In most situations, throughput isn't going to be limited by the bus.

However, the faster busses mean that after the SCSI's through
with things, there will be more bandwidth available for other
things.

Intelligent boards will leave more CPU time for number crunching.

Etc.

>Could you have had a particularly slow EISA SCSI?  I don't understand this.

It's also highly dependant on the driver software at all levels.

>I wish I could afford Adaptec's new VESA SCSI.

From what I've been told, it's an AIC6260 based board, ie a 
1520 in a VLB package.  So, the 1542's, 1742's, etc are going to 
have a smaller impact on the system.

Although there is a driver for the SCSI chip at the heart of the 
PAS-16, the PAS-16 is not supported because while people know where
the ports are, no one can tell how the 8 SCSI chip registers have 
been mapped into the 5 registers allocated for them, how the pseudo-dma
register and watchdog timer are set up, etc.

Subject: HELP! X1.3 too big? I have 8 meg
Date: Sun, 26 Sep 1993 16:00:33 GMT

Help!

I recently upgraded to Linux 0.99pl12 using the slackware distribution
1.02. I started X windows up and all was well I could open xv and
numerous windows under X without any problems or noticeable swapping.
(I have 8 meg memory and 5 meg swap)

Problem: Now when I open xwindows and do a top in an xterm I see 7 meg
in use and only 40k free. And it's true I can open only 2 xterms and xv
(and then swapping gets far to excessive to use X)

Back to the history:

        I then tried to install xdtm binaries. They wanted a certain
lib. (I thought it was PEX so I installed that from the distribution
disks from slackware) It still didn't work so I asked someone what lib.
They told me and I installed it. Xdtm crashed with a core dump.
(This is all probably irrelevent but I figure i should supply as many
details as possible) I then consulted some people on the #linux channel
of irc who suggested relinking the X server. I tried this and did a
-showconfig to make sure the changes took. They did. I loaded X (now
linked without pex and without support for monochrome) and it appears to
use the same memory! :( So I linked for X mono and no color support.
This reduced memory usage to 6 meg (still not very good) I know the X
server has gotten bigger when it went from x 1.2 to x 1.3 but this big!?

        I also think that one of these relinks has messed up the video
mode on my trident 8900c card. Under both dos and linux the right side
of the screen stops about a half inch befor the edge of the screen.
Any suggestions?

HELP: Can someone tell me why X was letting me run many programs and now
is a memory hog.

Thanks in advance!
