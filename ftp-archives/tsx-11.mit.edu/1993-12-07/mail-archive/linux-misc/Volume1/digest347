Subject: New release tracker available.
Date: Sat, 27 Nov 93 16:35:05 GMT

For those of you who don't know, tracker is a music player able to play
soundtracker/protracker modules on a variety of platforms, currently
including linux, silicon graphics, sun, amiga (including the A4000).

It used to be called str15/str32, and sparctracker at various stages of
its existence.

I finally ported it back to the amiga, so it was logical to upload it to
aminet. From now on, I'll try to make the latest release of tracker available
on aminet, in the mus/play directory, saved as a lha archive.
(lha is available on each and every one of these machines).
Aminet is a collection of mirroring sites throughout the world, including:
ftp.luth.se, litamiga.epfl.ch, ftp.uni-kl.de, ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de,
ftp.th-darmstadt.de, ftp.etsu.edu, ftp.wustl.edu and oes.orst.edu

I'll try to upload a binary version for each of these platforms later on.

As of today, you can get the source code for version 3.19 from aminet.
PLEASE, don't send me any bug reports for ancient 1.2 versions.

There is a slight problem with the amiga version: you'll have to fix
amiga_support.c, line 140, by closing the comment (I'm slightly embarassed
there), and by changing read to st_read in the smakefile.

I cannot get xrz to work.  It just says it's waiting for input all the time.

I tried the suggestion of using ShellCommand ("$ xrz") for the
zmodem download command, and it barfs  on badly placed ()'s.

Anyway, I'm stumped.  Any ideas appreciated.

I do the opposite I had OS/2 installed, so when I installed Linux I just added 
LILO to the boot manager which defaults to the most recent selection after 30
seconds.
It seems to work OK , I am a newbie (practically a virgin) Linux user so there
may be some reason I've yet to discover why it should not be done this way.

It works fine for me.   I've SLS 1.04 with seyon 2.14B and the new version
of Xrz3D.   Assuming that you have the latest versions of everything,
you should make sure to add the following to your X resources file 
(.Xdefaults or whatever):

Seyon.zmodemAutoDownload:       on
Seyon.autoZmodemAction:         ShellCommand( "$ xrz" );

And of course you must send something from the other end with sz ...

Subject: tty7 and tty8 hang while logging in
Date: 27 Nov 1993 21:48:04 GMT


I'm running Slackware (I believe it's release 1.0.5).  For some reason,
regardless of which user ID I use, my session hangs on tty7 and tty8 when I
try to log in.  It displays "last login" and performs mail check
successfully, then the session just hangs.  I can't dump the contents of the
screen; I tried (from my root ID) and got "can not ioctl dump".

ps -x looks as follows:

  PID TT STAT  TIME COMMAND
    1  ? S     0:10 init
  500  1 S     0:09 -bash
  521  2 S     0:08 -bash
   18  ? S     0:00 /etc/lpd

  477  ? T     0:03 -bash
   82  ? S     0:01 /usr/bin/dip /etc/sl1

  589  2 R     0:00 ps -x

It appears that PID 477 was the hung login; when I kill it via "kill
-sigkill 477" tty8 returns to the "issue" display.

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated!

Try adding:
 Seyon*zmodemAutoDownloadCommand: $xrz
to your .Xdefaults files as documented on page 10 of the man. If you 
don't want to use it as your autodownload command then check the
protocols file which comes with the package and gives complete
instructions for adding protocols and includes examples for Xrz3D.

Hope this helps,

Hello, I kept getting /dev/cua3: Device or resource busy message when I tried 
to use kermit.

I have tried the following procedures in the faq:
1. Set E0 and Q1.
2. Recompiled kernel.
3. Took out waitfor in /etc/default/getty.STTYS

I could not do anything else because I have tried all the wisdom of a newby.
The only thing that got rid of the message was to take out the

Are you sure it is mounted (/proc)? Even if it is not mounted, it will 
have a directory entry (you must mount onto a directory).  Check using
the 'df' command.  (Ooops! If the /proc is not mounted, this command 
probably will fail!) 
If it is not, check your /etc/fstab for the /proc entry.
If it does exist, try "mount /proc" to mount it.
If it is not, add a line in, it goes something like:

/proc /proc proc ...

I forget the fourth parameter, but it should look like the rest, some sorta
"load on boot" indicator.

No.  Linux is now, and always has been, freely redistributable under 
the Gnu Public License.  

Basically, this states that you have the right to obtain the full source
code for free (although the provider may charge you for his cost for the 
physical act of performing the copy), you have the right to redistribute
it, and everybody who gets it from you has the same rights as you.

People can sell Linux for whatever they want, with CD, tape, or 
floppy distributions in various formats generally going for $20 to $60
with minimal printed documentation.

Of course, you're legally allowed to turn arround and resell as many
copies as you want for any price you want, lower or higher, or to give
it away to your friends, etc.

And, many distributions are available for free download via ftp or 
on bulletin boards.

I don't know how others feel, but I'm finding it increasingly
difficult to keep up with c.o.l.h because of the volume of messages.
When the new arrivals exceed 100 per day (often pushing 200), it
is not a trivial matter to simply scan the subject lines after a
day or two.  I often find myself hurriedly skipping through the
group, perhaps missing messages to which I could respond.

This certainly attests to the popularity of Linux, but it also
works to the disadvantage of those who ask for help and whose
message(s) get missed.

But then, perhaps I'm alone in this perception of c.o.l.h and
there isn't a problem there at all.  If indeed there is a problem,
should a further split be considered?

Subject: [Q] Virtual Console Woes
Date: 27 Nov 1993 18:36:03 -0500

        I wrote a grotesque set of interconnecting scripts to allow users to
kill xdm and begin a DOS session using the emulator (0.49pl1) (killing X
was neccessary because our machines have a meager 4 megs of RAM, and the
X server eats up over half that).  After wrestling with xdm's tendency to
bring the entire world down with it when it's killed, I'm at a point where when
X is killed, the emulator will automatically start up, and vice versa.  Problem
is, X is killed from within an X client, and it doesn't want to give up the
virtual console even in death; usually, X is either exited normally or killed
from another console.  The emulator runs fine, but the console locks (remaining
in the xdm screen, not allowing console switches, etc) and xdm must be
restarted through a telnet.

        I was wondering whether anyone's found a way to either gracefully kill
X or switch virtual consoles from with a program...

Is it possible to have both co-exist and be able to switch between booting
DOS and Linux?

I know there has got to be a way, since I have done it with OS/2.  Maybe I
should just install boot manager (OS/2)?

I thought that maybe I could not use the BIOS on the Adaptec and just boot
the Linux floppy so that it would load the Adaptec driver and find the
card, but, that just wrote "LI" on the screen and died.

I have a tape drive on the SCSI bus as well, which I use under DOS, but, I
do NOT need the BIOS at all, and would love it if I could leave it disabled.

Any ideas?

Anyone have a recommendation in the 1280x1024 non-interlaced realm?
I just realized my Cirrus 5426/5428 card has a max clock of 85MHz,
which makes for too slow refresh at 1280, even though it has 2 Meg
of memory (enough for 8 bit color at this res).  My ViewSonic 17
is intended for art applications and financial trading charts, so
performance matters.  What should I be looking at?

I have 386DX-25 with 8M, no cache and Orchid 1280+ (S3 chipset with 1M DRAM),
Xbench says that it is 3 times faster than sun3/50.
I am happy with this configuration, even though ghostview is slow because
of the slow CPU and no FPU.

LaTeX runs much more slower in my machine than my friend's 486/66 with 16M,
VESA IDE cache (4M RAM) which runs MS-DOS.   His 486 MSDOS machine can run
LaTeX stuff faster than  decstations or sparc.

Most seem to agree that an S3 928 card is best, so I went out and bought
one, but the #9GXE has a RAMDAC that does some multiplexing or something.
Anyhow, I spent $400 and can't run 1280x1024.  Not really complaining,
since I bought it for speed and the fact that my dealer let me trade in
my Cirrus VLB towards that $400.  Just be warned that just becouse it's
an S3 928 doesn't mean it's yet fully supported, I can't even get my
#9GXE L12 VLB to run 1024x768@70Hz, only @60Hz, but it works great at
that.

ANyone know when/if the Brook Tree 485 and it's AT&T clone will be
fixed for dot clocks above 85?
