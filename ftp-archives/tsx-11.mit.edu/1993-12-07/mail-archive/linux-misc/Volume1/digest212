I'm using 1.7 and have had one MAJOR problem with it. If I hit ^Z to suspend
it and do something else, and then I fg it, it is TOTALLY screwed up. ^L won't
refresh it. Sometimes it takes a few tries at :q! to get it to save. That
seems like a VERY big bug to me...I don't have a problem with any other
programs...just elvis.

    I was trying to do a rlogin on another system... The password was wrong,
    and just after the message "Login incorrect", I saw my harddisk working
    a lot... Linux began to be slooooooow, very sloooooow... (around 30 sec
    to see a letter typed on the keyboard...)

    by Linux after 2 minutes around... And I found in my home directory :

   -rw-------   1 root     root     85005312 Oct 15 10:10 core.rlogin

I had the same problem with some network programs.  The best way to kill
them all if you are using bash is to run "ulimit -c 0" in your /etc/profile
or you personal bash setup so core files are not allowed.

Seems like the huge corefile problem was fixed at one time but I don't
really know.

The networking problem you have is probably a configuration problem.  When
I fixed some things in my system most bugs went away.  However, things
are still not right.  My system is not really networked but a few programs
won't run unless I have TCP/IP and the network daemons setup.

Yep, elvis *is* good, but there are some sticky points.

I personally don't like the scroll right feature. I would rather wrap.

Also, more importantly, I am currently having problems with elvis not 
accepting an alternative tags file name. That's certainly something that 
"real" vi *can* do, (on at least four other UN*X flavours). We create 
smaller "sub-tags" files with names of the type:

  A7tQ5.67
  
in /tmp and elvis can't be made to find them via EXINIT. IF I call it tags 
it's OK. This is a pain, since the reason for the obscure name is to 
prevent overwrites ($$ stuff), and I want to be able to specify an 
alternative path to the current directory too.

Lastly, if elvis is made to jump to a tag from the *current shell* in a tcsh 
it will get messed up tty settings. (j in command mode shows on the screen
for instance.) Doing a :!pwd (or anything to run a subshell) will reset.
If I run it from within a subshell (script) it's OK. The ksh doesn't have 
this problem.

If I've missed a trick, please let me know. (email please, I don't know 
about you but it's getting to be distracting ot have to delete 90% of the 
traffic in here. I will summarise if there's anything useful.)

Has anyone stopped to consider that the "noise" is an indication of the
success of this project.  As long as Linux remains the domain of the
intellectually elite, it will be what UNIX has always been accused of
being...  A plaything of the academicians.

Get used to more noise...  And learn a little more polite way of dealing
with it, or your "club" will become quite exclusive.

Might I suggest moderation of some sections with moving of posts to the
appropriate sections and quiet polite e-mail.

Some of the morons are folks who (like me) prefer to place a short post
asking if anyone has any advice on such and so before diving into the manuals.
Someone may have just the answer ready to send.  If not, I'm as capable as 
anyone of diving face first into a manual.  If I wish to place a post (in an
appropriate area) what's the harm?  It's short, it takes little time to skip,
and I'd gladly answer such "moronic" questions (and have).

The reason for Messy-DOS's success is that it doesn't take an administrator
with eight years experience to use.  Neither does UNIX, but it may take a
few "ignorant" (Not stupid) questions to get started... 

IMHO

As everyone knows, his middle initial is 'B', and I've heard rumors
that the 'B' stands for Bourbaki, though many people believe it stands
for Benedict.  If the rumor were true, well ... if you don't know

        Just got done reading an article about the various NT workstations
available.  The article claimed that DEC has a faster Alpha chip, but that
they don't want to use it because their systems would apparently be classified
as supercomputers (according to some government measure) and their export
would be severely restricted.

        Sounds like a good home system (for Linux, of course) to me.  :-)

Hmm. I just use:

tar -cf /dev/fd0 --multi-volme --tape-length 1440000 --exclude /tmp (etc..) /

Works great.  (Anyone know what the optimal blocksize is for HD diskettes?)

Look at tar --help

BTW, are there plans to port dump/restore to Linux?  I've grepped
