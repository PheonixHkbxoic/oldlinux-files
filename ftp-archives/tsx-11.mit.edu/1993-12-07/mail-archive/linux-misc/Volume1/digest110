=================== HD/CONTROLLER SPEED ==================
CONTROLLER                     DRIVE                TYPE      

?                                                  Western Di
        LO DISK Nothing available for comparison
        HI DISK Nothing available for comparison

        HI DISK My Quantum is VERY slow (well it appears slow to me),
                however it is
                quiet (which I prefer) and the Conner is much faster but
                somewhat
                noisy. I sleep in the same room as the computer which is
                one reason
                I like a quiet drive. I can get use to a fan (constant
                noise) but the
                intermitent HD can be annoying.

        HI DISK a bit slow

        LO DISK Fast
        HI DISK Medium

        LO DISK Well, it's 18ms, and plenty fast for what I am doing,
                which sometimes
                can include stuff that uses the disk heavily.  I haven't
                done yet any
                testing like using iozone, but I've tested the disk
                inside DOS.

        HI DISK Slow!

        LO DISK No problems.

?                                                  ?         
        HI DISK The 'alps' is slow. mostly because of the aforementioned
                problem
                with interrupts and the 300ms delay needed. The quantum
                is a fair
                bit faster, but not noticeably. (raw data rate is around
                700K/s
                for both, the alps drops to around 50K/s on random
                read/write).

        HI DISK Very slow (compared with the Sun's, at work... ;-)

        HI DISK Relatively fast - would prefer SCSI though

?                                                  ?         
        LO DISK IDE interface is Ok for DOS
        HI DISK SCSI is reserved to Linux, I'm working whith UNIX (Ultrix
                AIX,
                and linux) and need lots of compilations . SCSI is a
                great improvement
                from this point of view

?                                                  ?         
        HI DISK Fast as heck.

?                                                  Seagate   
        LO DISK With all the cash, It does not slow me down. I use it as a
                Point of sales terminal I can look up 300  products per
                secound with a PERL (ndbm) data base.
                You can not pick up prouducts that fast :-)

?                                                  ?         
        LO DISK Fast - almost no noticeable delay even loading large
                binaries, like
                emacs.  Seems surprising for IDE.
        HI DISK Adequate.  This is where I seem to pay the penalty for the
                slow
                data transfer rate (~1meg/s) of the drive.

?                                                  Western Di

        HI DISK No perceptions.

CONTROLLER                     DRIVE                TYPE      

?                                                  Western Di
        HI DISK I don't know whether the disk controller or the disk is
                the bottleneck.
                So I can only guess very roughly that the speed is
                "medium".
                (I didn't measure it or compare it to other hardware)

?                                                  Toshiba mk
        HI DISK Yes it's a little lame.  It's hard to use up more than 40%
                of
                the CPU while compiling with GCC.  I've never run
                iozone/etc
                so I can't separate this out from disk latency / linux
                file
                system, ...

?                                                  ?         
        HI DISK Slow for swapping (no benchmarks taken - It was all I
                could afford)

?                                                  quantum   
        LO DISK not as fast as i'd like
        HI DISK not as fast as i'd like

?                                                  Fujitsu 18
        LO DISK Normal
        HI DISK Very slow (but I think the problem lies in disk)

?                                                  Seagate   
        LO DISK Fast enough.
        HI DISK A bit slow, especially with a lot of reading/contention.

?                                                  Maxtor    
        LO DISK Zippy.
        HI DISK Reasonably zippy.  I get about 900kb/sec dd'ing a
                partition to /dev/null.

?                                                  Maxtor & W
        HI DISK If I turn off turbo mode, I notice that the drive doesn't
                stay
                as active.  I assume this means the controller is keeping
                a good
                pace, with the drive's ability.

?                                                  Quantum   
        LO DISK Disk subsystem seems fine to me.

?                                                  Maxtor 200
        LO DISK Fairly good.
        HI DISK Well, my second HD, a Connor 250 MB, is slightly faster.

?                                                  2 * Seagat
        LO DISK Fine
        HI DISK Too slow - any mechanical device would be.  Are you sure
                you
                thought this question out?

?                                                  Maxtor    
        HI DISK The controller isn't the problem, but it's better to have
                two
                drives with a well designed splitting of the directorys.

?                                                  2 WD Cavia
        LO DISK excellent for IDE and SCSI
        HI DISK both OK

?                                                  WESTERN DI
        LO DISK System responds very quickly.  The WD drive has 64kb of
                buffer
                RAM which it using for reads and writes (write-back
                cache).
                The cache uses a adaptive algorithm to determine the
                optimal
                caching scheme based on recent disk usage.
        HI DISK Still get good performace numbers.  A misc disk test which
                was
                posted some months back returned number of 1.8MB/s on
                reading
                and 2.0MB/s on writing.  The test was done on a 9MB file.
                The
                write-back cache skewed the write results (no doubt).

?                                                  Quantum   
        HI DISK Seems on the slow side but that's probably more to do with
                the fact that I'm swapping to file not to a swap
                partition.

?                                                  Maxtor    
        HI DISK It's a reasonable speed. 12 ms access time. Using
                floppies, of course, slows
                it down a bit.

?                                                  Western Di

        LO DISK The Quantum and Seagate drive are fairly fast. Due to the
                overheating
                the Conner is stuck at a 300kps transfer rate, so it is
                limited to the humiliating task of holding a FAT
                partition to allow
                file transfer between OS/2 and Linux.
        HI DISK Under heavy disk use having two controllers makes a big
                difference.
                Heavy use on the Quantum for instance doesn't slow down
                the Seagate 
                much.  If I try accessing the Quantum while heavily using
                the
                Quantum there is a noticable slowdown (same for the
                Seagate).

        LO DISK It's not Annoyingly slow
        HI DISK It's a clunker!

WD                                                 Magnetic P
        LO DISK Old, 28ms drives are _always_ slow  (especially on slow
                computers)
        HI DISK See above

Western Digital                                    Micropolis
        LO DISK Fairly fast. Micropolis has a 18ms seek time. But 1 to 1
                interleave
        HI DISK Still not bad. Very useable even under heavy load.

Western Digital                                    Fujitsu   
        LO DISK Very fast.
        HI DISK Slight degradation, drive caching and read-ahead tends to
                keep
                perceived speed constant in most situations.  Biggest
                indication
                of heavy use is increased head movement noise.  Large
                head movements
                (eg copying from partition to partition) cause a more
                significant
                slowdown.

        HI DISK better get a shitload of core, cause it is SLOW even with
                16-20mb on my high end box, syncs are deadly RLL and IDE
                drives both take the load much better, with IDE again
                being the fastest

        LO DISK Fine.
        HI DISK Too slow...
