This could be your problem. You only make the OS/2 partition installable,

Try also to put a blocksize thats divisible by 8 and lesser than the 
value Linux fdisk reports. So in this case 123056 blocks.

Subject: [Q]: mtools for other FS
Date: Tue, 21 Sep 93 12:24:48 MEZ

Hello all developers !
A few moments ago I sat at my LINUX-Box and was trying to archive all 
those packages I FTP'ed together. Normally I do this using mtools and 
720kB formatted 5.25" DD disks. But sincs those DOS-formatted Disks only 
allow DOS conform filenames, I always have to change their names.
Now my question:
Mtools are very handy to cope with disks, that is copying files from and to
floppys. Would it be possible to build a package that enables one to 
handle disks formatted with extfs or ext2fs in the same way ?
That is some commands like 'excopy' or 'ex2copy'. Always mounting and 
umounting the floppy is very annoying if you have to do a larger backup.
I hope there isn't yet a solution for this ... just mail me and I will 
shut up :-)
If not, wouldn't it be a nice idea ?
so long
CU

I'm not a current Linux user (Switched to NetBSD 0.9), but talk like this
is not needed, anywhere.  Linux is a good, _free_ unix.  I can't understand
how someone can be harsh on such a project, where you don't even have to pay
for a single thing (w/exception to possible costs in getting the dist.).

Hi linuxers!

I have a problem with my dosemu: it is not booting at all. I got 
Linux 0.99pl12 on 386DX40 (4MB). Video card is Trident 8900C. When I
typed "dos -A > dbg" for the first time (after modifying config-file),
I got the following errors:


TESTING DOS_SYSCALL messages..
SYSCALL ERROR: 45, *Level 2 not synchronized* in file emu.c, line 235: expr=
        -1

[The usual stuff deleted]

Well, I got a hint from a kind person to check the video settings in the
config-file. After that, the message "no dosemu_regs.mem!" vanished, but
I was given a joy to read the following:

(So, this line didn't go anywhere...)

There seems to be something wrong with my keyboard :-). I could not see

What happens if you do

    echo '^G' >/dev/console

(where '^G' is a ctrl-g in quotes) from a telnet session?  Does it crash the
machine?  Your description implies that it would...

Ok I'm posting this here as I can't think of anywhere else to post it to..

I'm looking for some util/package to help with developing programming 
documentation.  You know the sort of thing your supposed to draw/write as you 
develop code... :-)  I guess some sort of software engineering tool might fit 
the bill but this sounds a little like overkill for what I want to do.

Anyone got any ideas.....

I got one from Dr. John a while back.  It works great.  I only use it under
Linux though.  If you have ASPI drivers for your SCSI adapter, you can use
ASPITAR under DOS (ask archie where you can get it).

I have a 3600 and a AH1542C.

No kidding.  My wife wouldn't let me use my old Colorado Jumbo 250 when she
was around because it made such an awful noise.  She doesn't even notice
when the Tandberg is running.

This happens to me (pl12 also) if I don't set up buffering (tar -b ) high
enough.  I normally set it to 3000.  It also happens if I have a lot of
processes running and the tar program is swapped at all.

I wish I knew what sort of values I could set with the 3600 (it came without
manuals).

Maybe it is a 3820 specific problem.

[ Article crossposted from comp.os.linux.help ]
[ Author was Joseph Dougherty ]
[ Posted on Sat, 25 Sep 1993 01:46:53 GMT ]

        I installed the SLS 102 version from the new TransAmerica CDROM
today. The installation went okay except for two problems:

        1. Whine installing the packages, my system would suddenly
reboot for no apparent reason. It's also happened a couple of
times running the system, apparently when there's a lot of keyboard 
activity. Anyone experience this and have a clue?
        The system is a clobe 386/40, Forex Chipset, AMI, 2 IDE with
Linux and OS/2 sharing the first drive, Toshiba 3401 on an Adaptec
1542B, 2 floppies, SBPro, mouse on com1, modem on com2.

        2. I don't know if LILO was properly loaded, but
I'll check. In the meantime, I have the system installed on the 
second primary partition of drive 1, with the boot manager on the end of the
drive and OS/2 on the first partition. When I boot to the Boot manager,
and choose the Linux selection on the menu, I get an error
"partition not formatted" or something like that. I hit a key andI'm
back at the Boot manager. I can boot from the floppy created during the
installation, and I can access the file system just fine.

        I'd appreciate any responses, e-mail is fine.

The shells launched via xdm do not read your .profile, so whatever is in 
there is not taking effect.  If you want the shell to read your .profile, 
then start xterm with the `-ls' (login shell) option.  So, this is why your 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH does not work.  How have you set up the links?  Do you have 
libXaw.so.3 symlinked to libXaw.so.3.0.1?  Just doing a

    `cd /lib; ln -sf /usr/X386/lib/*so* .'

will not be enough.  About your problem with more, I would check the
.bashrc (assuming you are using bash) to see if there is a `TERM=...' 
statement.  As far as I can see, whenever I login to a vt, TERM is 
automatically set to `console', and whenver I start an xterm, it is set to`
xterm'.  Thus, I do not need to set the TERM variable at all.  I hope this 
answers your question.

: I can also recommend this disk. It's by far the best Linux CD-ROM
: I've seen, with a couple of different installation options. There's
: even a "live" system on the disk that I can symbolic link to.

        Got mine in the mail today. Very fast, just ordered it
Monday (I'm in Florida). I worked with Linux back from ver .11, up
through about 0.95something before I had to move to other things. I
was very impressed with the ease of installation (I had one problem
creating the first boot disk with rawrite, but I later discovered the
problem was in the OS/2 dos session I used).
        I've also had a bit of bumpiness with unexplained reboots and
lilo and boot manager not working properly. But I have the weekend
to sort that out...for now, I'm very impressed with this disk.
