Which is likely to be more efficient: Running several copies of a
large program one after the other, or all at once.  For example,
suppose I have 10 files to print w/ Ghostscript, on my '386 with 10M.
Am I better of running 10 copies of GS all at once, or running them
one after the other?

Suppose for argument's sake that there will be some swapping, but not
a lot.

Sure enough. At work they had a 4.2 version running natively on the Sun 3
series machines. However I'm not going to pay $800 for the priviledge when
I can run the DOS version under the emulator for no additional cost.

As I'm sure it's been pointed out before that 2 or more processes running
the same program can share clean and text pages. In addition the disk
buffer cache is also aware of pages of already running programs. So if
you run 10 copies of GS simulteanously not only will they share but the
text and clean pages will only be loaded the first time.

On the other hand the buffer cache doesn't usually let pages go unless
memory gets tight. So even if you run one after the other it's most 
likely that the pages will still be hanging around.

So either way you win. That's what I like about Linux. ;-)

   Excuse me if this is not the right place, but I've been "out of this world"
for a couple of months and returned today. During this time Linux changed from 
a budding patchlevel 10 to pl12, the c.o.l. hierarchy was reorganized, and a
lot of things must have happened. I also remember people talking about WABI;
what happened to it?  I deleted all the messages in the Linux groups and I have
a pile of magazines to read, but I would be glad if someone puts me up to date
on the Linux subject. (Just a short e-mail, nothing else)

Thank you very much.

Yep, the Linux support for two-or-more-OS's ain't the best. Not that
i hate Linux, but i'm still curious why they decided to have this silly
off-the-standard booting scheme (LILO). With *BSD using a normal dozz
boot scheme (load MBR, and then load the active partition's boot sector),
along with one of the fancy boot managers (i'm using os-bs), it works
like a charm. You could also boot those silly unices requiring their
own partition being marked active. (Another problem of Linux is, they
occupy a full dozz partition for swap instead of sub-partitioning their
primary one.)

Btw., i've been working with my old cheep PC from older dozz times.
A 386SX/16 w/ 6 MB of RAM and a bloody old Trident VGA, i even compiled
the whole XFree86 under 386BSD (approx. time: 24 hours:-).

The really disadvantage of BSD is it's lack of shared libs, thus consu-
ming much more disk space. But the original shared libs from Linux didn't
convince me either: i saw it at a friend, he quickly felt that his Linux
got binary-incompatible to itself. (Since the binaries had to match
exactly the shared libs.)

Last not least: take out all the `unnecessary' things from the BSD
kernel (IP, various file systems, SCSI, Ethernet, SLIP etc. etc.),
you'll get a (IMHO much useless) very tiny kernel:-)

From looking at the code, it was true of pl10.  Here's the relevant code:

int sys_brk(unsigned long newbrk)
{
        unsigned long rlim;
        unsigned long oldbrk;

        oldbrk = current->brk;
        rlim = current->rlim[RLIMIT_DATA].rlim_cur;
        if (rlim >= RLIM_INFINITY)
                rlim = 0xffffffff;
        if (newbrk >= current->end_code &&
            newbrk - current->end_code <= rlim &&
            newbrk < current->start_stack - 16384) {
                current->brk = newbrk;
                newbrk += 0x00000fff;
                newbrk &= 0xfffff000;
                oldbrk += 0x00000fff;
                oldbrk &= 0xfffff000;
                if (newbrk < oldbrk)
                        unmap_page_range(newbrk, oldbrk-newbrk);
                else
                        zeromap_page_range(oldbrk, newbrk-oldbrk, PAGE_COPY);
        }
        return current->brk;
}

Sbrk() is a library call.  It may do some kind of additional checking, but 
after perusing the code, I don't see any happening in libc-4.4.1.  So what
you see in sys_brk() is what you get.  Check it out in your kernel sources
to see what it's doing in the version you're running.

Yup.  NT is a real OS, though, in that there's actually a kernel which does
memory management, a filesystem, etc.  It's just that I haven't heard many
good things about it that Linux doesn't have...

As long as the executable isn't suid, you can always set an environment

also.

Make this about 100 for linux. And last time I heard, the latest MS-C
compiler alone was 53MB..... Be fair and compare something that has TeX,
emacs, gcc, gdb, fortran, p2c, several comm progs, including SLIP and
pseudo-slip as well as uucp, several mail and news readers, cnews, perl,

I think you misinterpret some thing wrong. 'We' (at least I) are not
bitter. But we think Microsoft is an enemy. Microsoft wants to
monopolize the whole software market. With especially superior
marketing they want to sweep other systems, which are superior from a
technical point of view, away. All users will in the end loose a lot
because of this, if only you wouldn't be so short sighted. I admit
that in some circumstances there can be advantages to use MS-windows
or NT, but in the end, by giving Microsoft a kind of monopoly as IBM
used to have, will threaten us all. The only things that speak for
Microsoft products now are the fact that it is 'compatible', i.e. no
intrinsic technical merit, but only market-reasons.

If only many users will think and do not fall in that trap, another
system, which is technically better, will become standard, and
everyone will benefit from the competition between suppliers if this
system is not owned by one company that is out to destroy all
competitors.

So, apart from the technical reasons, this explains why so many seem
to be bitter against Microsoft. We think this creates a situation in
the software market as used to be in the hardware market when IBM was
ruling. It took 20 years of too high prices and dictates to get out,
and now some allow the same thing to happen again in the software
market. This is especially concerning since Microsoft products have
proven to be not the most advanced or reliable, in the past. For some
reason many fall in their marketing-hype traps and believe in an
almost religious way that NT will be different from this past even
before it is properly on the market. Why put people put their trust in
such a company, why can people be hypnotized so easily?

You are proud on NT? With what reason, did you make a part of it? How
could you ever be proud on something that isn't your own merit?

Also the quality of it does not justify pride; OK I admit it is *at
the moment* more suitable for a big market than Linux because that is
still under development, but compare it to other systems that are out
there for a while already, like NextStep, Mach, Chorus. These only
lack marketing again, but technically and theoretically they are more
advanced.

Yes the kernel may be smaller. But the operating system for sure is
not! Because it is a micro kernel, many parts of the operating system
reside outside of the kernel. But that does not mean that it is lean.
Not at all!

About filesystem corruption: I have not had it once even. In months of
quite heave Cnews use. But do not forget that many newbies are playing
with it like a toy; they don't know what they're doing, turn off their
system while processes are running etc. Any multitasking operating
system will get damaged filesystems with such users.

  BL> Xtalk? Go figure. And on top of that we now have the superior os!

Yes, this attitude is part of the short sightedness I mentioned above.
I am not saying that everyone who needs such applications should
switch to Linux right now. That's impossible because these
applications simply don't exist, and not everyone is expert enough to
use public domain tools or make their own when they need them. But
there are other alternatives, like many commercial Unix version which
do have such programs. You may have some advantage for many apps now
when you use MS-windows, but when Microsoft really succeeds in
'windows everywhere' as they proclaim, i.e. get a strangling monopoly
on the market, you will regret it.

I don't react to this checklist. It is too stupid to seriously react
to. I is so blatenly wrong for allmost every point, and so clearly
intended to plug NT, that it doesn't deserve any attention. Only
people who have been converted to the Microsoft-faith will believe it,

   Hi all you linux users...    
     I want to install a sort of x-windows on my pc.  I was wondering where
can I get a demo copy of linux.  I want to see how is it.  If there is a
ftp site where I can get this demo.  
    Thank You very much...
