I'd hardly say that "full documentation" for Linux is almost complete.
About 600 pages have been written, but only two books are in relatively
complete form.  Matt Welsh's _Installation and Getting Started_ has
been released, and Olaf Kirch's _Network Administration Guide_ is very
close, but the _System Administrators' Guide_ has only been started,
and my _Kernel Hackers' Guide_ is also only started, and very raw.
My _Linux Programmers' Guide_ is not even started yet.  man2 and man3
are getting there in ALPHA, and will hopefully be released sometime
soon, but don't hold your breath.  man9 (kernel functions) has barely
been started.  Some books can be released in pieces, when they are not
yet ready.  Others really need to be complete before they are released
to the unsuspecting public.

As it is released, all documentation produced by the Linux
Documentation Project will be made available in at least two places:
tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/docs/LDP/
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/LDP/

For those who want to help: we need people who enjoy spending a *lot*
of time writing good documentation, and who take pride in their work.
If this is you, and you are willing to work and learn, please join the
doc channel of the linux-activists mailing list and announce your
intention and tell us about yourself, and ask for help finding
something to do.  We have several projects that could use work, but
only if you really want to do a *good* job...  This desire to do a
good job is what is making this project take a while.

Also, for those of you who complain that the LDP isn't doing anything,
remember that we didn't start writing anything in earnest until early
this year.  It takes a while to write good books, especially in one's
spare time.  If you have more spare time than we do, we're happy for
you... ;-)

Hello,

sounds alright, but don't forget that these cheapo ethernet cards are
TwistedPair and not Thinwire (am I wrong?). Twistedpair needs a central
unit collecting all the client wires .. and these units are expensive.
ThinWire is a moderate priced solution (a cable, clients connecting to it).
The cards are pricier and so is the cable. Also, the max distance is
around 150 meters.
That's what I got as answer for a friend :)

clock -r simply outputs the fields from your CMOS clock, because it
assumes your CMOS is set to local time.  clock -u -r translates from
GMT to local time, because it assumes your CMOS is set to GMT.  In the
process of translating time zones, we recalculate the day of the week
from the date, because the translation could cause you to go between
days.  If no translation is necessary, it's safe just to use the day
of the week from the CMOS, and so that's what we do.  Thus this output
indicates that the day of the week in your CMOS is wrong.  So is
mine.  I have no idea what is going on.  (Of course it's also possible
that my code for the CMOS day or week is simply wrong.  However I've
crosschecked it against what Manifest tells me is in the CMOS.)

As far as I have been able to tell, no one actually uses the day of
the week in CMOS.  I am fairly sure DOS recalculates the day of the
week from the date.  Linux certainly does.  My only guess is that
someone is supposed to be updating the day of the week but isn't doing
so, but since I don't know who is supposed to be doing so I can't say
much more.  I've never seen any problems due to the day of week being
wrong.

The -w command set the CMOS clock.  It set all the fields, including
day of the week.  So it's now right.

If anyone has any information I'd be tickled to get a copy.  For what

Subject: Weird floppy behavior
Date: Sat, 14 Aug 1993 22:24:07 GMT

I got a new computer recently, a 486DLC with an "FA3" motherboard.
I put Linux on the hard disk and it worked quite nicely until I upgraded
to 8 megabytes (from 4).  For some weird reason, the floppy drive
didn't work.  When I tar'ed something onto the floppy and untar'ed it
elsewhere, I got a bunch of garbage.  Also, I couldn't boot off of a floppy
(so I didn't suspect Linux).   When I took out four of the 1x9 SIMMs,
everything went back to normal.  Weird.

So I stuck back in the SIMMs, and recompiled the kernel with LAST_DMA_ADDR
in /usr/src/linux/kernel/dlk_drv/floppy.c equal to 4 megs instead of 16 megs
(so no DMA transfers would occur above 4M to or from the floppy).  Now,
surprisingly, the floppy drive works under Linux but I still can't boot
off of it, unless I go back down to 4 megs.  Isn't this weird?  Has anyone
heard of this happening?

(I did try the classic `all possible permutations' algorithm on the CMOS;
it doesn't matter whether the external or internal caches are enabled; the
problem is the same.)

They were posted on August 11 and should all have appeared around the same
time.  You and anyone else in the same situation should talk to your
system/news administrator and request that they add them.

Unless they follow news.groups, they will probably ask you if you are
requesting real newsgroups.  Show them a copy of the results.  You can
print this out and show it to your sysadmin if they need the info.

I noticed this and I find it annoying as well.

I haven't used SLS myself; I installed my system from the boot/root
combination, when that was still around, and have since used MCC for a
new installation at work.  However almost every time I go around to
someone elses Linux installation to give them a hand I find they have
SLS and within 10 minutes after that I'm cursing.

Rest assured that the New FAQ, currently in preparation, will give no
unusual prominence to SLS.  You'll have to ask Matt Welsh about the
Installation HOWTO.

(Background: following Marc-Michel's departure and general agreement
that the current FAQ is far too large and unworkable, and a discussion
on the DOC channel, Matt and I are replacing the FAQ with a real FAQ
which is just a list of frequently asked questions coupled with a
series of more detailed and complete documents - much like the many
sub-FAQs currently in existence)

You wouldn't like to submit that for comp.os.linux.announce ?  I don't
know whether Matt will approve it, but it seems to me that (as a
previously disinterested bystander) your posting of a side-by-side
comparative review of SLS and MCC is both independant and useful.

You need mtools (look on sunsite and tsx-11). mtools gives you a lot of

That's a misleading answer.  The person asking the question - which
does not belong in col.misc but in col.help - probably does not want
to use an alpha kernel.

They probably want to use the most recent beta version, 0.99pl11.
This can be found in the same place.

Subject: NFS boot?  dickless linux?
Date: Sun, 15 Aug 1993 00:35:10 GMT

Let me first say that I currently don't run linux, but plan to install
it soon on a couple of machines here.

I've been following the discussions in the linux groups for a while,
in the hope of understanding it when I do get round to installing it.
(At home, and possibly here at work too.)

(My job is to look after unix machines here, so I'm not that much of a
newbie ;-)

Please ignore any complete misunderstandings I have about this subject
as I'm not up on primary boot loaders.

Ok, one of the things I'm hoping to do with linux is to get them to
act as Xterminals etc.  Since the size of even a minimal root
partition and an Xserver plus fonts is going to be bigger than a
floppy drive I was considering ways of doing a boot, over the network
NFS mounting root, and proceeding from there (this will probably be
faster than using a floppy as root anyway as floppies are so slow.)

I fetched the lilo distribution in the hope that this would have info
on how to perform the boot of linux after (somehow) getting the kernel
into memory.  However I found that according to ection 3 of the tech
guide, that the config of th elocation of the root partition is a pair
of numbers, representing major and minor devices of the root disk.

I quote:

  The boot sector of each kernel contains a set of configuration parameters
  that have to be available at boot time before the kernel can access
  file systems. These parameters can be set when the kernel is compiled and
  later be changed with programs like rdev. LILO can overwrite
  the parameters at boot time.

  The parameters are stored at the following (decimal) addresses:

  498 is a flag specifying whether the root file system should be
      mounted read-only (if non-zero) or read-write (if zero).
  500 the size of the kernel, counted in paragraphs (16 bytes).
  502 this parameter is currently unused.
  504 the size of the RAM disk in kilobytes. No RAM disk is
      created if this parameter is set to zero.
  506 the text mode the VGA is set to.
        ...
  508 the minor number of the device that should be mounted as root.
  509 the major number of the device that should be mounted as root.


1) Is this the only way to specify the root partition?
   If so this means that NFS boots can't be done with the
   current system, or did I miss something?

2) I seem to remember someone posted a piece of code to put in an
   ethernet card to add bootparam/bootp startup code.  I assume that
   this must be for network booting, if not what was it for?

I was planning to have the bootstrap run from a floppy since some of
the PC's I'd want to run this on would not be able to have new
hardware installed.  I assume that others have done this, any clues?

I assume that I want to use use rarp,bootparam or bootp to collect
information about the machine, and who to boot from etc, then place a
linux kernel in memory (either by NFS read or TFTP (or even keeping a
copy of the floppy)), then tell it where to mount root from and let it
go.  This is based on observations of the way that Xterminals and
Dickless Workstations boot (an the man pages on Suns.)

Has anyone already done this or should I just ask people who want to
try linux to re-partition their disks?

Please no flames, (I'm wearing my best shades in case), and mail me
rather than posting.  I'll summarise if there is enough interest.

                 Welcome to the comp.os.linux.* hierarchy!

Background
=========================================================================
        This posting is an introduction to the comp.os.linux.* hierarchy 
        of USENET newsgroups. 

        Linux is a free implementation of UNIX for 80386/80486 machines 
        covered by the GNU GPL. Most of the development of the Linux 
        kernel has been done by Linus Torvalds, an internationally 
        reknowned UNIX wizard from Helsinki, Finland.

        For the past two years or so, the newsgroup comp.os.linux has 
        grown be one of the most popular groups on USENET. Late in 1992, 
        a CFV for splitting comp.os.linux was posted; the only group which 
        passed was comp.os.linux.announce, a moderated newsgroup for Linux 
        announcements and patches.

        Six months later, during the summer of 1993, another CFV for 
        splitting comp.os.linux was posted. The voting period for the 
        comp.os.linux reorganization results ended at 23:59:59 UTC on 
        4 August 1993 (4:59PM US Pacific Time, 7:59PM US Eastern Time.) 
        The results are as follows:

         1660  155 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.misc


        Because of this split, the newsgroup comp.os.linux will be 
        deleted on 11 November 1993. The new newsgroups will be created 
        on 11 August 1993. This posting describes these newsgroups, 
        including comp.os.linux.announce, which will remain entact.


General Policy
=========================================================================
        The general policy for the Linux newsgroups is simple. Who sets
        the policy? We all do. All of us on USENET are interested in
        communicating openly about a number of topics. That's why we
        have USENET. If you want the Linux newsgroups to work for you,
        a few suggestions:

        * Read the Linux FAQ and follow the newsgroups for some time 
          before posting questions. This is very important. comp.os.linux 
          suffered from HUGE amounts of noise and traffic because much 
          of the growing readership never bothered to READ the newsgroup;
          they only posted questions.
          
          The same thing will happen with the new newsgroups unless you 
          read the FAQ (found on sunsite.unc.edu in the file 
          pub/Linux/docs/FAQ) and read the newsgroup for some time before 
          posting questions. Chances are, your question has already been
          recently answered, and a simple browsing of the newsgroup
          will answer it. We suggest using a threaded newsreader such as
          "trn" which will allow you to browse and mark articles by 
          subject, so you don't have to read each and every article in
          each newsgroup.

        * Crossposting between the Linux newsgroups is STRONGLY 
          discouraged. If you do crosspost questions between Linux 
          newsgroups, expect to be flamed to oblivion. The reason we
          have a newsgroup split is to categorize discussions into 
          separate newsgroups. Crossposting negates this effect. 
          If your posting cannot fit into ONE of the newsgroups
          c.o.l.admin, c.o.l.help, or c.o.l.development, then you 
          should post it to c.o.l.misc. 

          The one exception is for announcements. Occasionally, an
          important announcement (such as this one) will be crossposted
          between c.o.l.announce and one or more of the other c.o.l.*
          groups. These announcements must be approved by the .announce
          moderator; see below.

        * Reply to questions via e-mail if at all possible. While 
          discussion in the newsgroups is encouraged, if someone is
          asking a simple question to which the answer is well-known,
          there is no reason to post the reply. Don't assume that 
          the person posting the question actually reads the newsgroup
          or will even note your followup if they do. Reply via e-mail
          unless the reply is of general interest. 

        * Don't flame newbies. Over the course of the past few months,
          the Linux community has developed an oversensitive ego and
          a reputation for being unfriendly towards newcomers, mostly
          because of unwarranted flaming by a handful of righteous 
          individuals. If someone posts, saying, "Hi! I'm new to
          this group! What is Linux?" (which will inevitably happen
          as the new newsgroups are propagated), DO NOT FLAME THEM.
          When someone sees a new newsgroup pop up within "rn", they
          are justifiably curious about the new group and probably
          don't know that well over 80,000 people who know EVERYTHING
          about Linux read the group. Right? 

          Instead of being rude, you can send a polite note to the
          poster, saying, "Hello, Linux is a free implementation of
          UNIX for the 386 and 486. You can get the FAQ from 
          sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/docs. Let me know if I can
          be of help!". That's all. Not difficult, eh? You can even
          save your stock reply in a file and simply send form-letters
          to newbies if you wish. But there is very little point in
          flaming or ever being rude. It goes against everything that
          Linux can and should be. 

          Just remember that nobody knows everything---not even Linus---
          and that you were a newbie once, too. :)


comp.os.linux.announce
=========================================================================
        Comp.os.linux.announce is a moderated newsgroup for Linux 
        announcements and source patches. The purpose of this group was
        to get all of the ``important'' Linux information out of the
        regular newsgroup and into a place where all Linux users could see
        the important announcements without having to wade through a 
        jungle of other postings. So far, this group has been very 
        successful. 

        The moderators for this group are myself (Matt Welsh, 
        mdw@tc.cornell.edu) and Lars Wirzenius (wirzeniu@cc.helsinki.fi). 
        We will be sharing the moderator duty, and backing each other up 
        to make sure that postings to this group will be approved as soon 
        as possible after they're submitted.

        Submissions to this group should be mailed to the address:
                linux-announce@tc.cornell.edu

        If you have any problems or questions about c.o.l.announce, please 
        send mail to the moderators at
                linux-announce-request@tc.cornell.edu
        Or simply mail us directly. This is not a request address for 
        mailing list subscription; see below.

        A separate posting details the guidelines for submitting to this 
        group.  I plan to approve just about anything that's posted to this 
        group, except for questions or discussions about Linux. So, please, 
        post away.  :)

        There are also archives of comp.os.linux.announce available at a 
        number of Linux FTP sites: check 
                sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/linux-announce.archive

        There is a mailing list mirror of the comp.os.linux.announce 
        newsgroup; to join, send mail to
                linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi
        With the line
                X-Mn-Admin: join ANNOUNCE
        at the top of the body (not in the subject). Approved postings to 
        c.o.l.announce will automatically be mailed to this mailing list 
        channel.


comp.os.linux.admin     
=========================================================================
        This newsgroup was created simply to thwart the unique newsgroup
        acronym "c.o.l.a", previously used by c.o.l.announce. However,
        this newsgroup is also used for discussions and questions about
        running Linux systems, either in a single-user or multi-user
        environment.

        Clearly, there is no large distinction between c.o.l.admin and
        c.o.l.help. However, .admin should be mostly used for discussions
        about RUNNING Linux, not USING or PROGRAMMING it. Unfortunately,
        especially with Linux, the line between system administrator and
        system user is very fuzzy. In short, we anticipate c.o.l.admin
        to be mostly about questions with installing, setting up, and
        configuring Linux systems, as well as other discussions relating
        to system administration. 


comp.os.linux.development
=========================================================================
        c.o.l.development, or "c.o.l.d" for short, is a newsgroup for 
        questions and discussions about Linux kernel and systems-level 
        development. Please note that this is a newsgroup about 
        development OF Linux, not development FOR Linux. In other words, 
        c.o.l.d isn't for questions about programming or porting software 
        to Linux. Instead, this is a newsgroup for discussions about 
        developing the Linux kernel itself, including writing device 
        drivers, adding new features, and so on. In addition, discussions
        about development of shared libraries, and other essential 
        systems-level projects, are welcome here. 

        Hopefully, this newsgroup will embody some of the content and
        scope of the linux-activists mailing list channels such as GCC, 
        KERNEL, SCSI, and NET.


comp.os.linux.help
=========================================================================
        Comp.os.linux.help is perhaps the most general of Linux 
        newsgroups. It is for any general user, programming, or 
        setup questions and discussion about Linux. If your question
        is about Linux development, post to c.o.l.development. If
        it is about system administration, post to c.o.l.admin. 
        However, if your question is of a more general nature, such
        as "How do I set up Linux for use with an NE2000 card?",
        c.o.l.help is your place. 

        Remember that you should not crosspost between .help and
        other Linux newsgroups. This means that if you are asking for
        help in .development, that's fine, but .help is for those
        questions which don't fit into .admin and .development.


comp.os.linux.misc
=========================================================================
        This group is the canonical ``catch-all'' for discussions and 
        questions which don't fit into the other Linux newsgroups.
        While c.o.l.help is generally for questions, c.o.l.misc is for
        discussions of a general nature about Linux, such as setting up
        a file hierarchy standard, questions about Linus' personal life
        and virtual beer, and the inevitable flame war. Again, it should 
        be noted that crossposting between c.o.l.misc and other Linux 
        newsgroups is strongly discouraged. If your posting or question 
        does not fit into ONLY ONE of the other Linux newsgroups, post 
        it to .misc.


Comments
=========================================================================

        direct them to mdw@tc.cornell.edu. Flames to /dev/null; cheques
