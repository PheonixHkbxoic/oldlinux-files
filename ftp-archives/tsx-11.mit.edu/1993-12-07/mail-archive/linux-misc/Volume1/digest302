Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

I would suggest to use colors or whatever that prints a bit nicer on 
a black-and-white printer (as most people still have, I guess).  
It's still much nicer to actually print the magazine and read it in the 
old-fashioned way, even for a magazine distributed electronically..

Ian's daily postings do a very good job.  They inform everyone who
takes the trouble to scan the postings of ONE DAY about how to use
c.o.l.* appropriately.  There is, however, a very good reason for NOT
taking this trouble: that c.o.l.* is severely overloaded (in
particular, .help).  Some newbies are intimidated by the sheer mass of
the postings and do the wrong thing through no fault of their own.

Now `Drinks' targets specially this audience.  Are you sure you really
READ the message which he proposes to send around?  This isn't
particularly what my dictionary would call `intimidation'.  It is, on
the contrary, sympathetic and painstakingly polite.

And this is just the fine part of it:  Ian's postings in combination
with `Water's' mails will filter out EVERY misbehaviour by mistake.
ANY remaining repeated mis-posting will be sure to be due to bad will,
dumbness, or thick skin.  So when the signal to noise ratio creeps up,
the evil bad guys are right known to everyone.  All trouncing will
concentrate on just those baddies.

It's worth making sure that no innocents get hit by the mob, even if
you hate mobbing yourself. What's `fascistic' about such an aim?!

Does anyone know if there are any chances for him to

Subject: GCC as Xcompiler??
Date: Mon, 15 Nov 1993 14:41:29 GMT



Hi all:

I am interested in doing cross development with the 68k line of systems
under Linux, and I've heard/read in the man pages that gcc will cross
compile 68k to 68k assembly.  I'm running SLS (a bit dated, 1.02 I think).
However, when I try to compile any C source with the -m68000 option, it
tells me I'm using an invalid option.  The people on comp.sys.m68k tell me
it should work....so, my question:  is the 68000 stuff disabled for some
reason in the SLS dist, or is it just not possible to do the cross
compilation on the Linux x86 system?                       

This is more or less linux related, sorry if it's too GNU specific...

Thanks in advance..

Under MPEG-I encoding a full-screen video is reduced to a bandwidth of a standard (that is
approx 300Kbit/s) CD bitrates.  Odly enough any higher and you wouldn't get a particually
long play-time, even with this compression you can only get approx 70mins per CD.

GCC makes a fine cross-compiler, but you will have to compile it
yourself.  The binary distributions (obviously) don't have all
possible cross-compilations options enabled.

Date: 15 Nov 1993 17:00:46 +0100

(using XFree86 2.0 from the Slackware 1.1.0 release)

I'm using a miroCRYSTAL 8S board, the ISA bus variant with the P86S801 
chip set. Everythings works fine so far, except for the following problems:

        * The XF86_S3 server thinks that this is a local bus card with a 
          805 chip set.
          
        * The X server doesn't return properly to text mode:
          - every second time the screen's entirely blank, just the 
            cursor could be seen.
          - every other time the screen font is somewhat mangled, looks 
            like every second line is missing.

Solutions, anyone?

Please respond by email, 'cause I don't read this group regularly.

So if I have one IDE drive for DOS and another for linux, which drive

Hi everyone,

I am building a linux based public dial-in (for a cost off course) here in
central Texas. I am using a 386/40 w/ a IN-2000 SCSI ctllr. I am having
problems when any software tries to access the hardrive, even fdisk. It hangs
and eventually gives a scsi host time out error. The access lite on the hd
works fine.

Have tried syn and async, irq 14 and 15 w/o help.

We are using the special a1 boot disk specific to the IN-2000.

Any idea why this is happening. Has worked fine w/ dos and os/2 for over a
year. Thanks for your suggestions and help ahead of time....

Anyone out there using RIP or NAPLPS on linux? I help develop a bbs package
for dos we are going to try to port over to linux. If we can get it to work
inside the dosemul util then it will be available a lot sooner.....

I just upgraded my linux to patchlevel p.  I have libc4.4.4, gcc 2.4.5,
ld.so 1.3, and XF86 2.0.

When I compile this program with -static or -g I get:
closing

even though close() shouldn't be called!

When I compile it wothout static, it works fine.  It will also with g++.

Can someone give me a pointer as to what went wrong?  Do I need to get a
newer gcc? (the assembly looked ok)  Do I need to look at ld.so?

Well, I finally got Linux working on my machine. Now, I'd like to set up term.
I played around with it a bit, and was reading the man pages, and realized how
easy it seems to be for people to clobber your personal machine if you allow
logins from the world at large. So, I was wondering how other people have set
term up to work for themselves. If I get enough information, I'll see if I can
set up a TERM-HOWTO to go with the other HOWTO's. To that end, I would ask if
people tell me not only how they set term up on their machines, but why they
chose their setup, and what benefits/problems they've noticed with it.

Also, I'd like to know if anybody has managed to set up term so that it is
virtually transparent on their machine (ie - you can ftp, telnet, e-mail, read
news, etc through the term link).

I am hoping to be able to put together a package, or set of documentation, to
make this procedure easier for everyone. If such a package already exists, I
have not found it yet. And I apologize if it does exist, and I'm wasting
everyone's time.

Anyway, let's go to it! E-mail responses to the address in my .Sig.

Linux applications should adopt Tcl/Tk as their scripting
language--ala ARexx on the Amiga--so Linux could be made more user
friendly.

Now, I would finish my clone of this fax program if I could find
better documentation on Tcl/Tk.  This might be interpreted as an SLS
flame, because Tcl/Tk with SLS came with virutally nothing to learn
how to use it. (I have picked up the Usenix papers on Tcl/Tk, they
supply the concepts, but no reference quality information.)
