I think these are your options:

a) boot Linux from floppy
b) boot Linux with bootlin (or whatever), a DOS program that boots
   Linux (i.e., you first boot DOS, and then use bootlin to boot
   Linux)

It is possible that the following might also work.  I have neither
experience nor documentation (at the moment):

c) you install LILO as the master boot record on your first hard drive
   and tell that to load Linux from the second hard drive

Subject: Some "benchmark" results.

Here are some interesting "pseudo-benchmarks" that I ran recently.
I'll leave the interpretation up to you. (That is, *if* there is
anything meaningful to be interpreted.)

Machine: Intel 486DX-33, 20Mb 70ns DRAM, 256k external cache, OPTI c/s.
=======================================================================

Test 1:
=======

Kernel Compile:                          t=13:15
Kernel Compile with ext. cache disabled: t=23:01  (+74%)
Kernel Compile running CPU @ 40 MHz:     t=10:59  (-17%)

Kernel was 0.99p12 (+ Linus patch) with ext2fs, msdos, TCP/IP,
time to do "sync;date>/tmp/time;make;sync;date>>/tmp/time" with
no daemons running except /etc/update.

Second Test:
===========

        Compile three small packages at the same time, namely procps-0.7,
ps-0.99.12 and e2fsprogs-0.3. (Done via script below) The idea is that 
three different processes should exceed the capacity of the 8k internal
cache. (However, the processes share the fact they are all using GCC)

average time with cache enabled:  t=161 seconds
average time with cache disabled: t=273 seconds (+70%)
time with CPU running at 40 MHz:  t=137 seconds (-14%)

Note that there was also a disk speed increase seen @ 40MHz, due to the
fact that the ISA bus speed was increased to ~10MHz as a direct result.
This is directly incorporated into the above 40MHz results.

This script was run with all daemons killed, except /etc/update.

Hi all,

I just read about the new Yggdrasil (sp?)  and JANA cd-rom releases
of Linux. I am curious about whether either of them come with any
documentation about install and mainatain.

Anyway, the real question is whether there is a CD-ROM that is kind
of like a cica.indiana Cd-ROM from Wlanut creek is for Windows, and
the hobbes cd-rom is for OS/2.

I would like to see a cd-rom that contains source code for many 
popular (but large) PD Unix/X programs. Something that contains a lot
of heavy duty software (and not twenty five versions of xclock!).
I read recently that Ptolemy (for X) requires 49MB for sources! This 
is something that is for sure a candidate for being stuck on a CD-ROM.
(along with other similar heavy duty packages).

The CD could be updated regularly  (every 6 months or so) and vary 
contents too depending upon the demand.

If some such service already exists, please point me to where to get
more info (and sorry about the wasted bandwidth).

Just some food for thought.

Divya

Nope you've found a bug. It took me 4 machines and about 40 rlogin
attempts to duplicate it, but on some systems if you rlogin to localhost
and the rlogin immediately screws up (as the rlogind/rlogin client pair
of old tended too) you on odd occasion get a crash. This sort of thing
illustrates how hard network debugging is, and why the real all new
networking is taking so long. [Someone else asked how does NET2debugged
fit in with the new networking. The answer is every relevant bug fix
I've made has been fed back to the new networking people and most
accepted and added. In time Net2debugged will no longer be neccessary
and for once not being needed will make me happy!
>The first thing I want are *reliable* remote running X11 applications.
Try net2debugged on a real net. I don't release it until its had 3 days
on a real machine doing real work on a busy net (40K/second broadcast
packets + all the normal stuff). I've added local rlogin to my test
list for the future and started looking at it except for that it
does seem pretty much ok from reports so far apart from one other
extra printk that crept in (udp.c udp_rcv kill the printk about
Packet received for unknown socket). I've been using net2debugged
heavily for X and its been quite good - I even test mpeg_play to a remote
host as standard.
>The second thing I want is nfs.  NIS would be the greatest!
NFS has been solid (but none too quick) since 0.99.11 (I think) 0.99.10
certainly had a memory corrupting bug. Over slip you need to turn on
udp checksums and unless you have net2debugged set the slip mtu to about
1200 before not after you use dip to connect (goes for NET2E4 also)

Subject: What's the Difference? (X)
Date: 24 Sep 1993 18:26:22 GMT

I've had a hell of a time getting things working right under the latest
TAMU Linux release.  Now, finally, everything *works*... except "more".

No, it's *not* a permissions problem, and yes, I *know* that "less" would
still work... but it really makes me nervous.   What could be the difference
between logging in then doing startx and logging in through xdm?  Why on
earth would it screw up "more"???

Here's the scoop:

In the beginning (when I installed Linux [TAMU.99pl12+] onto a clean drive),
all I had to do was login as root and type "startx"... and everything worked.
 (Actually, I had to futz with the Xconfig, but that's beside the point.)
Then I thought, "It's not good to be root all the time."  So I created "rick".

I copied all the 'hidden' files from / to /home/rick, then logged in as
rick.  Then I tried to "startx"...  The "File Manager" and "xclock" came
up alright, but no "xterm".  Flipping back to virtual console #1 showed
me that xterm couldn't find "//libXaw.so.3".  Well, I thought that was
strange, since LD_LIBRARY_PATH was properly set in my .profile.

Why wasn't the proper library path searched for "rick" even though it
showed no problem for "root"?


WHERE SHOULD I DEFINE LD_LIBRARY_PATH SO THAT IT WILL GET SEARCHED???


Starting "xdm" showed similar troubles, which I'm still sorting out.

I've got an interim solution (a workaround, really) where all of the
shared libraries in /usr/X386/lib are symbolically linked up to the
root directory.  It's *ugly*, folks.   ...and "more" doesn't work.


It's really wierd!  Any user, logging in then using "startx", has no
problems at all.  It works great.  But if I use "xdm", *NOBODY* can get
"more" to work properly.  It displays the first 24 lines, then exits.


Can anyone give me a clue what could cause "more" to behave this way???

Do you plan to include pl13, which is currently in alpha, as the
installed kernel?  Or is it because a stable, official pl13 is
expected before the october 1 date?  Including an alpha kernel (Except
perhaps as source, with a non-alpha kernel both installed and in
source form) would probably meet with lots of opposition, and is
something I think SLS got flamed alot for.  (Discussions that I mostly
ignored, since I've already installed Linux..)

Anyone want to buy me a CDROM drive?  Thuogh it would likely be slow,
a CD-dependant installation would be a very happy thing for me with my
smaller HD.  :-(

And is there any special upgrade offer and/or easy upgrading from an
earlier Yggdrasl CD-Rom version?  I've been trying to help a friend
upgrade to the pl11 kernel (He hopes to do networking, and I'm not
sure about the alleged memory leaks in pl12+), 2.4.5 GCC, 4.4.1 libs
and Xfree 1.3.  The CD he bought had pl7+stuff, 2.3.2 GCC, 4.3(?)
libs, and Xfree 1.1 (Actually, I guess, X386).

As per the README file, simply move your inet directory to inetd.old,
then untar the new net distribution.  The only oversight in the docs is
that you'll have to copy the old Makefile and CONFIG files from the
stock pl13 sources (make sure to change the net/inet/CONFIG and 
then "make config" in the top-level linux source directory as you would
with any normal kernel).

Have you tried this, and if so, how does it compile differently than the
stock pl13 sources [are any files not getting compiled w/the new sources]?

Subject: Khoros for Linux.

Hello,

I have some questions  regarding the port of Khoros to Linux.
I got the original source and system files plus the patches by Wolfram Gloger.
My current version of Linux is 0.99pl12, I use gcc 2.4.5 and f2c-1993.04.28.
I applied the  patches against the Khoros source and system files, however
I failed to compile the program.  After some work I was able to compile Khoros
but I had to rewrite linux.cf file to implement my system configuration
(Wolfram uses SYSV and I like BSD).

Most of the Khoros' programs seem to work fine (I tested  editimage, putimage,
xprism3, xprism2, animate, many "vroutines"). However, there is a problem with
cantata. I get zombies every time when executing the routine (it gets pretty
bad after a while of using it :-( ). It seems that neither Wolframs patch to
src/xvroutines/Lib/xvforms/signal.c (replacing kill(pid, 0) with waitpid(...) )
nor the original version (I tried both) work for me.

Does any one have idea what can be done to fix this problem?
I tried to contact Wolfram Gloger at wmglo@dent.med.uni-muenchen.de (regarding
his Linux patch) but the e-mail gets bounced back.

Any form of help would be appreciated!

Thanks,
