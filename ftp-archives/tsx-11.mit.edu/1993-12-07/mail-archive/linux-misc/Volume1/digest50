I find myself in a situation where I need to load up a lot of files (mostly
graphics) that are all on AmigaDOS formatted floppies. Does anyone have
a tool to allow these to be read under Linux? I no longer own an Amiga
system, so I cannot change the floppy format.

Subject: Dummy IRQ questions (WRT 3c503 ether cards)
Date: Tue, 24 Aug 1993 17:07:52 GMT


Hi guys,

I hate to admit this, but I've never really understood the IRQ
scenario.  

I have two hosts, both using 3Com 3c503 EtherLink II cards and
often, the kernel reports that I have a possible conflict on 
IRQ 5.  Since I bought these boards 2nd hand, I don't think I
have the full docs for them.  

Can anyone offer some assistance here?  Specifically the info 
I seek is:

1) general desc of what IRQs are

2) what I must do to the 3c503 cards (jumpers??) to get them on
   a different IRQ so that they do not conflict.

3) how I can tell what the IRQs are for the other boards in my
   machines.


Any help on any of the above would be greatly appreciated!

    It would also be nice to have companion source packages for the
various installation packages. This would make it easier for a user to
update something if the package maintainer gets to busy to keep up at
some point. I recently greabbed the util(n) packages and installed them
over my SLS. This caused init to break mildly on it's reading of
inittab. I'm still not 100% sure which init SLS used.

Subject: New A1.* images?       
Date: Tue, 24 Aug 1993 20:17:32 GMT

Last week, Linus, and some other folks made statements in one of "linux"
newsgroups about an update to .99pl12 to fix a couple of things.  One was the
problem some sites (like mine) were having with networking, etc.  Anyway, I
was sure I saw a statement that said the new kernel and other disk changes
were now on tsx-11.mit.edu and that the a1.3 and a1.5 images would be updated
soon afterwards.

I checked today and the a1.* disks are still the old ones?  I also checked
the ChangeLog file and did see that a lot of the B and C series disks have
been reorganized.  I would like to start over with my install with this newest
release as soon as possible.

Could someone tell me when the latest a1.* images will be updated on
tsx-11.mit.edu?

Thanks for your help!

All of which shows how little you know about protected-mode programming.

VESA modes imply BIOS.  Protected mode doesn't use the BIOS.  Why don't
we use the BIOS?  Because it's difficult to do at all, and impossible to
do portably.  XFree86 runs on almost a dozen operating systems, not all
of which support V86 mode, and those that do all do it differently.
What we do is basically OS-independent.

It also is extremely restrictive.  Ever seen a BIOS mode for 1152x900?
Lots of folks use such a more for X.

And that's just mode setting.  What about bank switching?  Sure, the
VESA BIOS provides functions for that.  But that would mean a switch
to V86 mode for each and every bank switch.  I would guess that doing
this would cut the server performance in half, if not even more.

Why do you think it is that card vendors do their own drivers for Windows?
For non-accelerated cards that have a VESA BIOS?  Because the performance
of a driver for VESA BIOS calls would suck major rocks.

The correct solution, which will never happen, is for the vendors to 
provide SVPMI (SuperVGA Protected Mode Interface) files for their hardware.
There's a reason VESA came up with this standard; I wish some of the vendors
would follow it.

You don't need nnmaster, you see...that's the whole point of using NOV -
INN deals with the overview databases, and nn just reads the news (like it
should :)

Just copy the compiled binaries into your favourite bin directory, and
you're set.

Better yet, why not form a for-profit company that distributes linux and gnu 
software for cost only.  Then sell support.  If you have a problem or a question,
buy a service contract for a few months.  All profits should be doled out to 
those that provide the support AND those that do development - not necessarily all
under one roof.  As for who gets what, I dont think it would be all that difficult
to distribute any profits in a meaningful way.

Is anyone remotely successful at doing this?

Xenix 1.x was a Version 7 kernel.  Come to think of it, "Xenix System V"
*still* behaves an awful lot like a heavily-hacked Version 7....

There is (kind of) - it's called svgalib, and version 0.5 was put on
sunsite just recently, along with spic, a gif and jpeg viewer that uses it.

I dunno if it does VESA as such, but it'll detect and use et4000, trident
and cirrus cards I think...

I had to use the provided msdos program to find the right clock settings on
my et4000 card for 640x480x256 and 800x600 and 1024x768, but it works
great, and spic is heaps better than good old dpg-view... :)

       IOZONE writes a 20 Megabyte sequential file consisting of
        40960 records which are each 512 bytes in length.
        It then reads the file.  It prints the bytes-per-second
        rate at which the computer can read and write files.


Writing the 20 Megabyte file, 'iozone.tmp'...79.760000 seconds
Reading the file...65.860000 seconds

IOZONE performance measurements:

I use a Adapted 1542B, 486-50 ISA, Micropolis 2112 (1G) )-: ): 

Are there two programs, one for linux and one for MS-DOS, helping
to determine, where I must search the problem. If the Dos
(maybe checkit with 750Kb/sec) program show you a high transferrate,
you can exclude wrong adjustments in the hardware
(Jumper on the adaptec controller).

Subject: WABI available on Linux or not
Date: Wed, 25 Aug 1993 02:49:54 GMT

Hello dear Linuxers.

        I have a question. Excuse me if there were some similar questions
in the past, but at least I couldn't find any similar question or answer
in the FAQ list.

        My qestion is about the WINDOWS API emulator on UNIX-clone systems.
I've heard that Sun's WABI, MS-WINDOWS API emulator on Solaris, made it 
possible to use MS-WINDOWS software on UNIX systems.

        Usually I make some data on Linux and reboot my PC and then 
feed them to the Mathematika for WINDOWS. It's very tedious procedure.
I think it will save much my time if something like WABI were available 
on Linux. It may be very meritorious if many MS-WINDOWS programmes were
executable on Linux like on OS/2.

        I would like to know if some development projects for
MS-WINDOWS emulator on Linux like dosemu ( or winemu ?) are going on 
now or not. If it so, by making japanese localized version of winemu,
it might be possible to execute some japanese localized Windows programs
like MS-WORD, MS-EXCEL, e.t.c.

        I think it may be very hard task to make winemu comparing
with dosemu, since the number of API of Windows are many times larger
than that of DOS. It will need much person-power to accomplish such 
project like winemu.

        Thanks in advance for any comments.

Have you numbers to back this?  I tried compiling jgraph and comparing
the numbers from a Linux machine.  I found that my 486/25 (running X
at the time) was faster than a 486/33 Linux machine.  Anyone in the
linux world care to try a benchmark, it does not have to be anything
particular, just something that is portable and meaningful on both
Linux and *BSD.

You cannot really do a comparison with Mega-Loss as it is not in the
same league.  MS-DOS is a single tasking program loader (some people
dispute is being an OS), comparing that to *any* multitasking system
running on hardware of the same power you will lose.  Basically
because the task switching will have the effect of increasing the
application time, you may win on the i/o throughput because Linux/*BSD
cache the writes to devices but you are not proving anything really.

Sure, X will run in 4Megs but can you do anything with it?  I think it
would depend on what you expected.  Myself, I like having a lot of
xterms open rlogin'ed to machines at work, run emacs (v19 :-), gdb and
compile without having the machine thrash.  Do not tell me I can use
other tools that have had features removed to save space, I know about
them but do not like the sacrifices made (this is MHO) to shoehorn
them.  If you are going to say X runs in 4Meg, tell us what you use
and what you do with X.

I found X in 8Meg was a bit tiresome when I started doing real
development work, running emacs, a couple of gdb's, some xterms and
compiling would make my system swap, increasing the RAM to 16Meg made
life more comfortable.  At that stage I was not running *BSD but a
commercial unix with Xfree (before it was called that).
