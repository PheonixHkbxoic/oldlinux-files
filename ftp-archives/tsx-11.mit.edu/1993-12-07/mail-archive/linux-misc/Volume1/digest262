There may be some of you who have been having problems with term freezing at
baud rates over about 9600.  Well, I have a solution.  I'm not a hacker, and I
have no idea why this works, but it certainly does.

DO NOT USE /dev/ttyS1 IF YOUR SERIAL LINE/MODEM IS ON COM2!

All I did was invoke term with:

term -s19200 < /dev/cua1 > /dev/cua1 &

when I had been doing:

term -s9600 < /dev/ttyS1 > /dev/ttyS1 &

I now have term at almost twice the speed of before!  It isn't quite twice as
fast because my UART is an 8250, and begins to drop characters at 19200.  My
16550 board is on the way though, and I can't wait to see this baby go then...

Yahoo!

Does anyone know why choice of device is so crucial to this?  Is it something
to do with interrupt handling?  That would be my guess...

Tim.

Hi all,

        Having recently installed Linux I note that the version of
        ghostscript is very current. Being 2.6.1, and including
        a driver for Laser Jet 4. This is not to be found in sources
        for gs2.6.1 that I have seen.

        Realising of course that this may not be the appropriate
        group, however as the Linux version seems to be fairly
        current thought that somebody could point me in the direction
        of the latest version and drivers etc etc.

        Please E-mail, and I can post a reply afterwards with the
        results.

        Thanks, Gordon

Subject: Linux in antarctica
Date: 02 Nov 1993 02:41:50 GMT


Hi everyone. I thought a few people might be interested in an
application that Linux has been used for by the Australian Surveying
and Land Information Group (AUSLIG) here in Canberra.

I was approached a month or so ago by Martin Hendy at AUSLIG to give
him some information about Linux to see if it was suitable for a large
project they have underway.

After I showed him a couple of Linux systems and gave him a rundown he
decided to go ahead and the end result is that there are now 3 Linux
boxes in a cargo container on their way to Antarctica with 14 more on
the way for other sites in and around Australia.

The application is a data gathering one. The Linux boxes are attached
via serial ports to a "TurboRogue" satelllite receiver system which
monitors the 32 satellite Global Positioning System. Data is
downloaded from the satellites and stored in a 4Mb flashcard in the
back of the TurboRogue, and from there it is downloaded to the PCs.
The PCs store the data and forward it to a base system in Canberra.

The monitoring of the GPS system is essential for accurate surveying
work. Some other countries (notably Canada) have setup similar
networks for the same purpose.

Some of the PCs are connected directly to AARNet via ethernet (yes -
antarctica is networked!) while others have 14.4 Kbaud modems and
download data via scheduled cron jobs using the "term" package.

Even the machines on the net have modems, as we can't absolutely rely
on the network link.

The Hardware:
=============

The antarctic PCs are Digital 48633dx MT PCs with 8Mb ram. They have 2
345Mb IDE hard disks, with only one electrically connected (the other is
identically configured as a backup). They have 1 1.44Mb floppy drive
and a spare floppy (not connected). They have WD8013 ethernet cards
and a DataLink 14.4 Kb modem. 

The PCs for the other Australian sites will be Rack mounted "clone" PCs
for various reasons. They will be identically configured.

Each PC has 4 serial ports, each on its own interrupt. We achieved
this by making some minor modifications to a cheap 2 port serial board
we bought in Canberra. In future the PCs will probably have a BOCA or
similar board.

The other custom hardware is a "rebooting module" designed and built
by Anthony Wesley here in Canberra. It's a small box that attaches to
a serial port, a power lead and the reset line of the computer.
Basically it expects a "healthy" signal from the computer every five
minutes on the serial line, or else it "presses reset" by shorting the
reset line for 30 secs. It hasn't been needed yet in any of our
testing (Linux is robust, remember :-), but it's nice to know it's
there. 

A process runs a script to check half a dozen things every minute and
outputs the "healthy" signal if they all pass. 

The Software:
=============

The systems are running 0.99pl12 with a few patches. I chose this
because I have found it stable for my own use. We will only move to a
new kernel after extensive testing. One of the features of having the
PCs running Unix (they were considering DOS) is that we can completely
replace the system remotely, either via modem or the net.

Each hard disk has 4 partitions. A DOS partition (wth their old
software on it just in case), 2 Linux root partitions (identically
configured) and a data partition (the bulk of the disk).

The linux root partitions are 20Mb and are only half full :-) Most of
it is in fact taken up with things that are only included "just in
case", like kernel sources, gcc, sources for the TurboRogue
controlling software and even emacs 19.16 (to make life a little
easier).

I have designed the system to be very small. It is small enough in
fact that the whole system can operate from a single 1.44Mb floppy, if
I leave out the "optional extras". This is achieved by having the
whole of the /usr tree in a compressed tar file which uncompresses onto
a ramdisk on bootup, and having next to nothing outside of /usr/.  The
systems on the hard disk are already uncompressed.

This means that in case of emergency we can tell the operators on site
to insert one of the duplicate "Emergency root disks" and we can
operate the complete system remotely just from the floppy (including
disk fixing tools like fdisk and e2fsck).

Cron is used to control the regular downloading of data from the
TurboRogue and transmitting of the data to Canberra. Checksums are
used to ensure the data is correctly transmitted, and it is
re-transmitted if necessary.

Anyway, that's probably enough about the system. If you want to know
more then come along to the next meeting of the Canberra Linux Users
Group, where Martin and I will give a talk about the system. The
meeting is at 7pm in the Leonard Huxley Lecture Theatre at ANU on
Thursday the 25th of November.

Basically the aim of this post was to let all you Linux users know
that Linux is being used in a demanding application for a govt
department. Maybe it will encourage more people to try Linux for their
applications?


Cheers,


Andrew

True enough (in fact I'm one of those professors). However whenever I enter
a new newsgroup I read a bit as to what's going on so I can ask intelligent
and meaningful questions. Just because we have good and caring professors
doesn't mean that we can't be studious and concientious students also.

Most people do post answers. And I didn't say ignore it. I said to redirect
the questions to col.help. If the questions were asked and answered there
then there would be a single repository of the infor people ask for the
most.

I can assume that when the question you ask has a clear, precise, and multiply
answered answer in multiple places. For example there are still people asking
about the "term time bomb" even though the answer and the patch was posted
that same day and has been reposted every day since.

The problem is that we don't get just one informative post. We get that
same post over and over and over again because the querant doesn't take
any time or effort to try to solve the problem themself.

All I'm saying is that the c.o.l.* hierarchy is a great resource of information
but is overtaxed by questions that have simple answers that are easily found.

By blindly posting without even taking a glance for that gold nugget, it sinks
further into the mine and becomes harder to find.

You are correct, it is the default .xinitrc, not the startx that is at fault.
To be more specific here is the problem:

twm &
xclock -geometry 50x50-1+1 &
xterm -geometry 80x50+494+51 &
xterm -geometry 80x20+494-0 &
exec xterm -geometry 80x66+0+0 -name login 

So twm is started in the background.  Consiquently, selecting exit leaves
you without a window manager, and no way to focus your input to one of
the windows.  However, since the xterm is still running, xfree2.0 will
continue running.

Why not a more traditional:

xclock -geometry 50x50-1+1 &
xterm -geometry 80x50+494+51 &
xterm -geometry 80x20+494-0 &
xterm -geometry 80x66+0+0 -name login &
exec twm

Anyways as I pointed out, if the original  behavior is really desirable,
then the simple solution is to make the default twm menu not include an exit 
option.

Thats what I thought to.  But it didn't work.  Once the window manager was
exited, xfree refused to respond to any of these key sequences.  It could
be that when exiting twm focused my input on something useless like xclock,
or it could be some other strange problem...  I have no idea if this would
happen every time, or only one out of a thousand attempts, but I'm not about
to repeat the experiment without a mighty good reason.

To be honest here was my reaction:
  startx

  My God is that display ugly.  What happened to my startup file?  Quick
  select exit.

  Oh no!  That just seems to have killed the window manager.

  Try ^C, ACK no luch, try ^-ALT-F0, no luck.  Try ^-ALT-F1,..., no luck.

  This is really serious try ^-ALT-BACKSPACE, no luck.  Maybe I used the

  Hmmm, maybe wrong set of ^-ALT keys, try everything again with the other
  set...

  @#$!@#$ it looks like I have no choise but to remove the tape from
  my reset button...  I'm glad I didn't clip the wire like I originally 
  planned.  Not that a cold boot would be any worse.

Anyways I just restored my old xinitrc that was overwritten when installing
xfree2.0 and I'm back in business.

Possably, but I don't have CTRL-ALT-DEL enabled, for good reasons.  Anyways
I think this would have gone to bit-heaven with the rest of my keyboard input.

Perhaps another direction of approach is to write something that will walk
along the LSM entries you have in the web and periodically mail the owners,
log the time they were contacted, if they were contacted, did they
respond (to a mail filter, perhaps?), are they going to update, do they
need to update, etc.  It is abit more brute force, but perhaps a mail
out every x months (0.5<x<6) or something?

Stale information is potentially dangerous and can be easily avoided.  I
think that this simple reminder system is a possible approach.

I have been working with approaches to document maintenance and management.
(very specific areas), and have found stale information to be the last
issue to be dealt with.  (this is an indirect compliment, in saying
that the effort is almost there!)

        I had to steal an Adaptec 1522 from somebody in the office to load the
Ygersafdalkfgjhqlrtedasgl;l;ll CD-ROM onto my system, since it wouldn't boot
properly with the IN-2000 attached. Unfortunately, I loaded Linux onto a SCSI
disk, and any real disk usage (dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/null bs=8192 count=10)
would crash the system with a data overrun in the Adaptec driver. So, I wound up
putting DOS on the SCSI disk and Linux on the IDE disk. I also pulled the
Adaptec 1522. So now I have the SCSI disks attached to the IN-2000, which works
find for booting dos, mounting the dos partition as /d, etc. AS LONG AS THE
CD-ROM IS TURNED OFF. If I turn the CD-ROM on, system crash while booting
(in2000_abort) after whining about incorrect block size for the CD-ROM.

        So, I guess what I'm trying to tell you is, I have no problems running
SCSI disks off a IN-2000, but I can't use a CD-ROM either. The 1522 will run the
CD-ROM, but can't reliably run the disks. Yug.

Subject: Linux Distributions
Date: Tue, 2 Nov 1993 05:24:40 GMT

Hello,

I've been using Linux for a few months and I am truly impressed with
its quality. Although satisfied, I am not fully pleased by the
distribution that I am using: the latest SLS. I am currently studying
the alternatives but I have some unanswered questions to which I hope
some of you can assist me. My major complaint about SLS is that it is
a bit sloppy in its organization of files, especially when it comes
to the man pages. 

I keep an extensive set of notes of all the changes I make on my system.
This permits me to reconstruct the system in a few hours if something
disastrous occurs (fortunately this has happened only once so far).
The notes also permit me to recreate all the upgrades and packages 
I've installed. Hence upgrades to a newer distribution are made easy.
However I heavily rely upon the sysinstall script to remove,add and
update packages on the SLS distribution I use. Do the other distributions
of Linux offer a similar mechanism ? If so, which ones ?

I would definitely prefer to get the distribution on CD ROM. Other
than SLS and Yggdrasil LGX what are the other possibilities for a CD ROM
distribution ?

I must use X windows along with an OpenLook setup.
For those distributions that do not include X is it difficult
to perform the setup on my own ? 

I was impressed by the annoucement of the latest LGX distribution. 
However I am aware that it was a sales pitch and I wish to get some
additional info. Is its file organization clean ? What is the status
of the man pages compared to SLS ? Although the annoucement contained
several version numbers I couldn't find the version of TeX that it
provides. Since I am heavy user of AMS-LaTeX which I must install
on top of the distribution I need to know what is the version of TeX
and LaTeX supported by LGX.

Although I like to have the most recent release of most software I also
desire stability in what I use. The slackware distribution seems to be
the distribution which reacts most quickly to version changes but
I fear that this is done at the expense of stability. Are my fears
justified ? (perhaps it is only its name that gives me the impression) 
Which distribution is likely to include Xfree 2.0 ahead of the others ? 

Thanks for an answer to any of the above questions,

Eric
