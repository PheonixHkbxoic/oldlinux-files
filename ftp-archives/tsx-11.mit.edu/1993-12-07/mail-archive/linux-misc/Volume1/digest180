Meanwhile I RTFM for the 486DX-33 and it said the turbo switch disabled
the *internal* cache.  This board has secondary cache (256K), so to
drop from 16.6 to 3.67 it would seem that the secondary cache would
have to be turned off too.

The 486SLC2 manual was silent on this question.  In view of the very
small change in speed it is plausible that it turns off one cache but
not the other.  One of these days I'll get around to tracing the wires
to see.

It would have to be Ethernet at this stage via TCP/IP.  This can be
purchased for an AS/400.  The question that comes to mind is _WHY_
anyone would want an AS/400 for this purpose.  If you want to program in
RPG-II/III OCL/QCL/CL then use the stupid thing.  I tend to avoid
machines with operating systems that take up 1G of disk space.  If I
just wanted space, I'd buy a couple of 1G drives for the linux box.

Ding, Ding... Hmm, This could be the cause of my disk trash problems
under EXT2.  Same same with some testing.  Shell scripts and other
executables exit with Seg faults at random.  Wierd stuff.  free shows
no appreciable swapping.

Hmm,  Never really noticed that part of it, but I have news constantly
spooling on one disk.  Check, Check.  I run a 7000FASST2.  I can't even
get a compile of the kernel to fly all the way thru without crashing. 
It _may_ have something to do with swapping on a SCSI disk.  As a note,
my swap partition is 16M at the BEGINNING of the disk, and when this
happens, I cannot reboot via lilo.  It halts with LIL-.

Wierdness like this could put fits into complex filesystem code.

Very, a reboot solves the problem, provided you have a boot disk in my

change your command from

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

386SX-33 (Intel) = 4.06 BogoMips(tm)

  Strange that this is higher than the 386DX/25.  I guess the DX vs SX

Definitely not SLS.

I would recommend not using Slackware either, as it is SLS-derived,
though I hear that it has had quite a few of the nasty bugs fixed.

Use either MCC or TAMU.  Both have had good reports; I've tried MCC
and is is very good, though you have to download X separately (easy
enough, especially compared to wrestling with bug after bug).

Well, I found it...

I upgraded my 286 some time ago with a brand new 486DX33-256Kb Cache mother
board. (I feel sorry I didn't buy a Local Bus...) But I kept the old box, 
which has no turbo switch on it...
Never a problem, never thought my system was slow or something, till I read
this bogomips stuff. Friday evening late I took the old 286 motherboard, 
took a jumper off it, and placed it over the connector for the turbo switch
on my 486 motherboard. And voila, from 4.27 to 16.44 BogoMips(tm) in less
than 5 minutes.

So, if anyone wants to know what the BogoMips are useful for: for me it was
that now even MS-Windows (yuk) runs faster. And falcon 3.0 of course.

Thanks everyone.

Your "turbo mode" is disabled, and on a 486, it makes that big difference...

I have heard that 486 design disallows "dynamic" clock speed changes - so, 
they
just disable caching totally if you switch them "low speed".
