A couple of comments:  I don't know what DDE is, so I can't say if Linux
has it or not.  Probably not.

Multimedia programs for Linux may exist.  I haven't heard of them, so I'll
assume that they don't.  But why in the world would you want multimedia
support in the KERNEL???  If the applications can run efficiently enough,
you don't need it.

There was a paper in the Summer Usenix proceedings about a realtime file-
system.  If multimedia becomes desirable enough in Linux, it would be a
lot more logical to implement that and have the application do the rest.
Once you have a filesystem that guarantees timely data delivery, the rest
is easy.

Unfortunately true.  You'll notice that I don't tend to make snide remarks
about Windoze users.  I make snide remarks about Windoze.

This is partially wrong.  As someone else posted (and I checked), QIC-80
support is in alpha testing now.

However, if you have a SCSI QIC-80, then you're already supported.  Nuff
said.

Interesting.  This disproves your "sheep mentality" claim.  After all, why
would any Linuxer bother reading comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy if they
weren't a free thinker?

This seems to be true of you as well.

What do you expect?  Windoze NT is *already* behind schedule.  It was
supposed to be released several months ago.  We can't be responsible for
the bogus claims of others.

>But look at

No.  Loadable device drivers *now*.

>Drag and drop... "R6 is out any day now", 

Again, depends on the application.  I'm not one to hold my breath for X11R6,
though.

WABI was started in *June*, ferchrissake!!  What do you expect in a couple
of months?  And yet, the reports say that it already runs a respectable
subset (though not enough to run a major Windows application).

Wrong again.

Such is the nature of true multitasking, though this *can* be fixed....

Right.  X is lacking an integrated GUI.  It was designed that way explicitly.
Maybe this was a mistake, maybe it wasn't.  Either way, if you absolutely
must have drag and drop across the board, then Linux isn't for you.

Why would you want this built into the KERNEL???  There are better
generalizations than that, e.g. a real-time filesystem and real-time
scheduling.

Didn't you already say this?

General consensus?  By whom?  *What* linux developers?

BTW, how well does the NT QIC-80 driver do when there are other background
tasks going?  Does it stream anyway?  How badly are the applications hit?

An unfortunate consequence of making the most of what you've got.  :-)

Of course, if you *really* don't like it, you can fix it.  You have the
source.

I'd *love* to see you fix something you don't like about NT.  Just try.
Heh heh heh.

*What* flaky filesystem?  All of the filesystems in use *now* are rock-

Feeble networking, eh?  You mean things like the ability to mount filesystems
via NFS?  Telnet?  FTP?  That kind of networking?  Flaky indeed.

From reading the newsgroup, it looks like the only networking problem Linux
has involves doing rerouting.

>Linux users, get a clue! Your os is shit. 

Oh, sure.  An OS that I haven't been able to crash *once* while doing normal
Unix things.  An OS that's smaller and faster than *any* of the commercial
Unixes out there.  An OS that's smaller than NT (and probably faster, too).

Yup, sounds like a piece of shit to me.  :-)

Yeah.  Right.

I have an idea that will probably work better.  If you want to contribute
money to someone who has worked on Linux, why not just send them a check?
That way you avoid the problem of someone else deciding who should get what.
That way, the amount of money people get is directly related to the amount
of money the contributors feel they should get.  No hassles, no problems,
no bureaucracy, no legal fees.  :-)

And then the recipients can do whatever they want/need with the money.

Microsoft Windows NT targets a different audience than Linux, namely
business users.  I'm sure that Microsoft will do admirably in this market,
given the large number of business applications that will be ported, and
Microsoft's incredible advertising budget.

Linux targets unix users, with an emphasis on academics and hobbiests.
Unix users want something that looks, smells, and feels like unix.  
Academics and hobbiests need something cheap, and need something with 
source so they can tinker with it and base their research on it. So,
Microsoft Windows NT will not "completely bury" Linux in Linux's market 
until Microsoft makes an attempt to be truly unix compatable 
(Few unix applications are purely POSIX 1003.1), and gives it away for 
free, with full source code.  Ie, when hell freezes over.

>Angry that after all the gloat about how lean and mean linux is, NT's
>kernel is less one fifth that size? Tough! $

You're comparing apples and oranges. The Linux kernel includes various
filesystems, device drivers, etc.  In NT, these aren't part of the kernel
propper. So, for a valid comparison you need to compare the WinNT kernel +
file system code + device drivers + etc to the Linux kernel by itself.

>Or that your file system falters more often than it works? (how many 
>times a day does the extfs get corrupted?) 

I've run Linux since Decemember of 1991, and have never had a corruption
not directly attributable to my device driver development.  Of course, 
some people are too stupid to run fsck automatically before writing to 
a filesystem after an unclean shutdown, and they will see corruption. 

>For crying out loud, you even have to recompile the
>whole os in order to add the littlest of drivers!

You have to recompile the kernel, which generally means remaking a few .o 
files.

>You know what your problem is? You stare at your os too much! I mean,
>let's face it, you have *NO* applcations

My compressed Linux kernel is about 170K, and I have about 90M filled
on my Linux partitions.  About 30M of that is data, leaving 60M of 
applications, hardly "no applications".  

>and as such all you can do is gaze at your os, and hence slowly you acquire an unpalatable taste
>for it! They have drag and drop they say! 

>You don't even have a file manager for pete's sake!

A file manager is available for X11 in general, which means it will
work for Linux.

Conversly, I could argue that you have broken, case-sensitive filenames,
no reasonable wild card matching, etc.

>We don't mind the os as much as long as it get the job done. 

I hold the same opinion.  However, for my needs, no non-unix like 
products and no commercial products for less than $1000 fit the 
bill.

>And we have the tools for that, none of which you have, or ever will. 

Funny, I seem to have had no problems writing all my papers in the 
last few years on Linux and other unix like systems, have had no 
problems maintaining my 'black book' of phone numbers, sending 
faxes, etc.

>Do you have Winword?

No.  If you want a WYSIWYG word processor under Linux, use doc.


>Word perfect? Lotus 123? 

Word perfect and Lotus 1-2-3 are unintuitive products that have suceeded 
because of marketing and business's reluctance to retrain people to use 
better, more intuitive products.  

If you must run wordperfect, you'll find that it works under the Linux 
DOS emulator.  If you want WYSIWYG, which Wordperfect isn't, run 
doc.  Personally, I find that I'm faster with vi and roff.

>*Any* spreadsheet? 

oleo

>Procomm?

I had to use Procomm Plus the other day, and found that it was almost 
unuseable.  It ate characters that I needed to use on the remote system,
and provided no intuitive way to escape them, meaning I was unable to 
use "`" and "~".  So, in my mind not having Procomm is a feature, not a 
bug.


>Xtalk? 

Instead, I have Seyon, which provides (through xterm) the best vt100 
emulation I've seen in a telecomm package, a sane scripting language,
dialing facilities, etc.  It doesn't eat *any* characters.  With all buffering 
handled by the operating system, I've been able to run high speed 
downloads (1700cps) on machines with 16450 UART's, while doing other CPU
intensive jobs, without dropping characters.  

In other words, for all of your example applications, there are equivalents
under Linux using both similar (ie, WYSIWYG) and different metaphors.  They're
also free, which can't be said for your examples unless you are a felon who's
pirated them.

>Go figure. And on top of that we now have the superior os!

Maybe for your purposes, you do.  

For my purposes, Windows NT will be worthless since I won't have source 
code, and would have to search long and hard for the tools I like to use
since they won't be bundled with it.

You need to realize that different users have different needs, and no 
product, Linux, Microsoft Windows(NT), SCO, MacOS, etc. will satisfy
all of them.

We're offended, bitter, and vulgar because people like you are posting 
flame bait to comp.os.linux.misc.

Speaking of toy OS's (Technically, Windows isn't an operating system, 
and neither is DOS, but I'll overlook that for the moment), I've
used Microsoft Windows a few times.  

While running a commercial 24 bit paint program, Windows crashed the 
system half a dozen times within fifteen minutes.  Conversly, there is a 
documented case where a Linux system was up, running real programs, without 
one crash, for over 136 days (when a backhoe operator took out a power 
transformer).

Another time, I was installing Linux on a friends system and didn't 
have file transfer utilities and a telecomm package installed yet. So,
I loaded up Windows under DOS, ran Procomm for Windows, and started a Zmodem 
download.  The files were going to take about an hour to download at 14.4K
baud, so we went out for donuts.  When we got back, we noticed that the 
transfer rate had dropped to 30cps since the screen saver was hogging all
the CPU because windows is not premptive. Under Linux, I can do all the 
1600cps downloads I want, while hammering on both hard disks and doing 
other things.

Windows crashes frequently, and doesn't schedule processes fairly, making
it unuseable for "real work".  So, Windows looks a lot more like a "toy OS"
than Linux, if you consider Windows an operating system.

This is a false statement.

Of course, recent Linux kernels have fixed this behavior.  

In earlier Linux kernels, sbrk() would allways succeed, and memory wasn't
actually allocated until the sbrk()'d pages were actually touched.  Thus,
it was possible for processes to allocate more memory than was available,
and Linux would thrash as it ran out.  Recent Linux kernels use some 
heuristics to determine how much memory is going to be "really" used, 
and will cause sbrk()'s to fail when it looks like memory will run out,
meaning this can't happen.

If you consider your operating system Microsoft Windows, technically,
it's only a shell.

If you consider it DOS, technically it's only a program loader.

Actually, technically competent testers can be a disadvantage.  There was
a company that developed a video editing system for the Mac.  It was
very expensive (about $5000 or more for the card and software, I believe).
All of their beta testers were professionals in the video editing field.
They loved the product.

When the product got out of beta and was released, a zillion fatal bugs
were found.  What went wrong?

It turns out that when the pros found a bug, they would figure out a work
around, and not be too concerned about it.  They knew that this little
$5000 system was doing things that previously required them to use equipment
costing $100,000 or so, so they expected there to be flaws that they would
have to work around.  To them, it's saving them $95,000 dollars!  So what
if it crashes when they do a certain obscure thing?  For $95,000, they will
just stop doing that obscure thing.  The thing was vastly better than they
expected a $5000 system to be, so they were happy.
