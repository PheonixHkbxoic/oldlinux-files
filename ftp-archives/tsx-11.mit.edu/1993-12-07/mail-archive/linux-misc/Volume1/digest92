Look, this whole slagging of distributions is totally irrelevant.  Times change,
distributions change.  WHat was great yesterday is awful today.

My experience:
I started with 0.10 kernel (eee, so long ago!) with the root+boot floppies
Linus made.  Then MCC created a massive 5 disk setup complete with gcc.  Wow!
I couldn't imagine anything better.  THEN SLS created a 30 disk setup!  After
a lot of phone calls (no direct connection) I grabbed SLS.  1 week later it
changed.  I grabbed the changes.  1 week later it changed again.  I got the
changes.  2 days later it changed again!

At no time did I even CONSIDER slagging off any of the authors involved.
My attempt at humour ("I hate Linus" postings) were read as such by some people
(luckily those who did the work understand humour!)

Now, through the Ygd... CD, and a fair bit of ftpmail, I have rebuilt 90%
of the Linux setup I want with my own compiling.

The whole point of this posting:  the work done by Peter, Le Blanc et al
is great.  If you don't like it, DON'T USE IT!  I have never downloaded
a system from these people that has not worked, after a little common
sense.  OK messy it may have been (SLS around March was real culprit!)
but it *worked*.

To paraphrase: those who can, do; those who can't, moan.

I think this is what pisses most people off, at least those who don't have

forget this is still beta software and subject to change at a drop of a hat.
I'm grateful to be doing Unix at home affordably, and Linux/SLS works just
fine for me.

Hmm, this wouldn't work too well. First, you would be limited by the rather
small number of blocks you can look at for compression. Second, this would
create unpleasent dependencies accross the entire FS, making any recovery
after an error less probable and increasing the possible damage. Third, loop
devices don't have any interface to user mode programs, so this would be
something rather different (but there exists an (old) implementation of
user-mode block devices by Lawrence Foard). Fourth, there would be no way to
know whether the data being written is already compressed or not, thereby
wasting CPU time and possibly also disk space compressing data that's
already been compressed by a better method. Fifth, you'd get "interesting"
semantics, e.g. an attempt to erase a file may result in a disk full
condition. Sixth, and most importantly, Stephen Tweedie is already working
on a compressing version of the Ext2 FS. I expect this to yield much better
performance than a strictly block-oriented approach.

A more interesting case migh be compression of swap files or partitions.
NeXT do this with apparently quite good success. Something to think about
for the future ...

I don't think the problem is distributing disks for a charge.  Most will
agree this is a needed service.

The problem is advertising on USENET.  And the problem is when 10
diffrent companies all vie for the readers attention, suddenly c.o.l.*
becomes a junk mail-box, somthing know one wants.

One possible solution that was tried in the past but died for lack of
support was a mail-order catalog in which all vendors would place adds and
the catalog was posted periodically rather than haveing the group peppered
by cheesy individual slogans and blatent attention getters.

If I was the .announce moderator, a moderated newsgroup that can be
controlled, I would require mail-order adds to be in a catalog form.  And
if no catalog exists it would be the vendors responsibility to create one.
And when a new vendor tries to post refer them to the catalog maintainer.
All adds would be listed alphabetically or some other fair way (not by
order of arrival).

The catalog, like the one on tsx-11 (or was it sunsite), would have a short
description and a long description of x lines each.  With short
descriptions listed first then the long descriptions last.

This would solve the problem on .announce  Of course the other groups are
really more public and can not be controlled beyond the forces of the
market.

If you are a vendor and would like to discuss this further please contact
me, thanks,

Stephen

I would like to thank Peter MacDonald for distributing a workable,
though not perfect, Linux system that make my life a good deal easier.

I used to administer my own personal Unix System running on an NCR
MiniTower.  When it died, I switched to Linux on a '486, using the SLS
installation.  While there are things I would change, I was overjoyed
to find that SLS provided me --- "out of the box" --- with a set of
software that it had taken me months to download, configure, and
install on my MiniTower, *even when I knew where to look for it.*

I see SLS as a trade-off between "convenience" (the software is there)
and "perfection" (Peter has installed it as I would have done), and I
have found that SLS's advantages in convenience have far outweighed
it's failings in perfection.

Thanks, Peter.

Peter Olsen, P.E.

P.S.  My strongest suggestion is that /usr/local be reserved for
*truly* local material, so that I only have to back up one directory
to insure that I'm ready for any upgrade.

Actually I think this is not true.  Linus is quite good about doing
rewrites and redesign where needed to introduce new functionality.

I wish they had used a different name, because lots of people have the
same impression.  What Linux calls net-2 is simply the second release
of the Linux networking code.  It has nothing to do with the Berkeley
net2.  It is certainly the weak point of Linux.  While I find SLIP
quite usable, based on the reports I see in both the public newsgroup
and the mailing list, it's clear that when you start putting Linux on
a busy network and having lots of simultaneous network connections,
you're likely to have trouble.  Someone said they were planning to
integrate the Berkeley net2, but I don't know whether that project is
really going anywhere.

There's a certain wariness in the Linux community about using BSD
code.  I don't know other people's reasoning, but I think the USL suit
provides a good reason.  I personally think the USL suit is completely
absurd, but courts have made ruling that I think are absurd before.
Thus until that suit is settled, I believe the community needs an
alternative that is completely independent of Berkeley.  If it weren't
for that, I'd say Linux would be better off just adopting BSD net2.

>libraries so uses much less memory and disk space.  Also, its rumored

Linux uses DOS partitions, including "logical" partitions in an
"extended" partition.  Linux file systems and swap space are simply
created in a DOS partition or logical partition.  Since the DOS
structure allows for up to 26 partitions (using logical partitions --
only 4 primary partitions), I think there's enough flexibility.  The
advantage of using the DOS structure is that Linux can read and write
from DOS partitions using mtools or directly using the DOS file system
code that's been in the kernel for the last 6 months or so.  Linux has
a version of fdisk that can be used to manipulate partitions of other
operating systems.  The Linux structure lets me move partitions and
logical partitions back and forth between Linux and other operating
systems.  As I understand the BSD setup, you pretty much have to pick
a single DOS partition, and once you've done that you're stuck with
that amount of space unless you want to reinstall.  The Linux approach
seems like it's a bit more flexible, though there can be situations
where it might be more dangerous.

SCCS started out in life as AT&T licensed code.  Hence the popularity
of RCS (even at Sun installations) and the rarity of SCCS in the world.

Now I may have this mixed up, but the Berkeley folk were or are using
SCCS internally for their development; and I've seen some Makefiles
come out of Berkeley that did SCCS operations.  So there might be some
non-licensed programs that do a very minimal subset of SCCS as a way
to get you going if you get handed a file that is in SCCS form.

Which is true of the dynamics of companies within capitalism.  But we're not
really concerned about the companies so much as we are about the *products*.

Let's take a look at two cases where the company in question was large, had
an inferior product, and managed to have that product get real popular
anyway due to the stupidity of the public.

Case 1 is, of course, IBM.  They came out with the PC.  When it first came
out, there wasn't much that was widely available that competed with it.
Because it was an IBM product, *everyone* bought it.  The PC gained most of
its ground because people naturally thought IBM was good stuff.  Little did
they know that the product was actually quite badly designed, making use of
a badly-designed CPU and a badly-designed bus (and a badly-designed DMA
scheme, etc).

Now look where we are today.  What's the most popular type of computer?  A
PC clone.  What kind of hardware is it?  It's running a relatively broken
CPU like the 486, something that has an instruction set and register set that
leaves quite a bit to be desired, and running the *same* broken bus
architecture that is responsible for the low performance of most of the
hardware available for it.  But because clones are so cheap, they're popular,
and as a result people spend a great deal of time developing software for
this broken hardware.  Linux is a *perfect* example.  I'm glad it happened,
but I wish it had happened to better hardware.


Case 2 is, of course, Microsoft.  They came out with DOS for the IBM PC.
Because people initially bought lots of IBM PC's, DOS became popular.  Not
on its technical merits (DOS has none), but on the IBM name.  Because of
this, people wrote programs for this broken "operating system", which caused
it to become more popular, etc...

Now look at where we are today.  What's the most popular "operating system"
available today?  DOS, of course.  Guess what needs it to run?  Windows.
We all know how badly broken and inferior DOS is.  Yet, because it's so
popular (due to the stupidity of the public), there are a lot of things
that won't run under anything *but* DOS.

Because people often do things that only one or two applications can provide
the functionality for, they are often *forced* to run DOS, ugly as it is.
Word processing is a perfect example.  Lots of people have Wordperfect for
DOS.  Despite *its* brokenness, it's also one of the most popular things
around.  But to run it, you have to run DOS.

Even if Microsoft were to go bankrupt *now*, DOS will be with us for a long,
long time because it takes a long, long time to unwind the recursive
dependency cycle which is behind the popularity of DOS.


There are more examples, e.g. System Vr4, but I trust my point is clear: it
doesn't matter *how* well a company may be doing in the future, the problems
that they've left us with will cost us dearly, *exactly* as is happening
now.

An outside observer who wasn't really on the inside of all this might easily
conclude that people in general *prefer* inferiority.  This, of course, isn't
really true.  The biggest problem is that most people aren't bright enough
or well-trained enough to recognize an inferior product when they see it, so
they base their decision on things like how much it will cost or how much
"support" they'll get (when, of course, few people realize that the promise
of "support" for a product usually simply means that there will be someone
on the other end of the telephone telling them that the bug they're reporting
doesn't exist, hasn't been heard of before, and is being fixed even as they
speak).

They'll leave us all with a legacy of inferiority.

Yeah, but they usually *are* making purchasing decisions.

Agreed with respect to companies.  But see above for why the process itself
yields suboptimal results compared to making the correct choices to begin
with.

Additionally, you know what will happen, right?  When Microsoft (or whoever)
goes down, their product will eventually be replaced with another inferior
product.
