Linux was thrown together in a weekend when Linus got bored.  I was
reading comp.os.minix at the time when he posted his "Hey, look
what I wrote last weekend" article.  It was written monolithically
because, well, it was just hacked together in a couple of days, so what
do you expect, OK?

Er, make that OSF/1.  There's no Ultrix port for the AXP architecture.

These things are also not as expensive as you'd think.  Check the prices
on the entry-level 2000-300 mode.

>Sun OS is horrifyingly slow.

Correction, Ultrix is horrifyingly slow, SunOs is merely slow.  A linux PC
performs 3 or 4 times faster than the best Ultrix DECstation (MIPS chip)
at our site.  And a Mach/monolithic BSD PC performs around 75% the speed of
the Linux PC in one disk intensive test.  But that would be on the "Fast" file
system BSD introduced 10 years ago.  [the mach numbers are valid for our
PCs **and** microchannel PS/2s]

And, wow, 10 years later Linux has a file system du jour (xia, ext2,
minix ...) that can go faster.  Not real surprising.  On other hand
Ultrix does stay up for more than 12 hours.  Linux pl13 keeps crashing on me.

From the linux experience, it seems reasonable to expect a profusion of
file systems on a multiserver Mach machine.  You could even be running
different versions of, say, the xiafs simultaneously...  on both your Sun
at work and your PC at home.

GNU's mission is to develop software for the unix world, not just for PCs.
The hurd multiserver will develop just as linux has, based on the
enthusiasm of the developers for the idea.  Linux (writing a unixoid
kernel from scratch for PC/ATs and compatibles) is a cool idea, generating
its own interest and momemtum among the zillions of unix-aware PC owners.

A Mach multiserver OS is another cool idea generating enthusiasm, but
among a (not exclusively) different group of people, those who think
multiservers are the next wave of workstation OSs.

So Donald can go ahead and keep writing his linux drivers and I'll
continue porting them to 386at Mach and may the best OS win.

Hi,
I have an appian graphics card. This card have an Texas TMS 34020 graphics 
processor and 2Mb VRAM. This card have an builtin SVGA Acumos AVGA2 (GD5402).
The graphics card ran without problems in windows with the drivers RGDI, 
and Tiga with resolutions from 800x600x256 to 1280x1024x256.

I could use it like an generic VGA card, using XF86_Mono version 1.3 and 
linux 0.99pl7.

But I need to use it with resolutions of 1024x764x256 and 1280x1024x256, what 
can I do. I know that XFree 2.0 is new out there, could it solve my problem?

go about it since I have a boot manager for OS/2 installled.  I have 2
IDE drives C and D. D is just a bunch of data so is of no consequence.
Presently I have my C drive (245 MB) partitioned at 60 for OS/2 and the rest
for DOS...I wish to repartition th eDOS partition to install Linux, however
I want to also add the Linux partition on the Boot Manager.  

Could someone please give me some insight ...the FAQs are not very
helpful when it comes to installing Linux on OS/2.

I took my Xconfig from 1.3 and used it.  It came right up.  and XDM
works too...yes this is great.  I agree it is faster also.  I have 
a ( diamond speedstar ) ET4000 card and it is a noticeibly faster now than

Yow! OpenVMS.  Sounds like some kind of hallucinogenic nightmare.  You
should check to make sure the CIA isn't putting stuff into your orange

Still there's nothing quite like those VMS system calls -- most of
which have 147 parameters, almost all of them cryptic, optional, and
default to values that are non-useful for what you are trying to do.

Slackware 1.04 Problem No. 6:

in package lpr.gz (disk a2) you'll find duplicated programs:

usr/bin/lpc     vs.   usr/etc/lpc
usr/bin/lptest  vs.   usr/etc/lptest

To make things worse, these files differ! Does anybody know which
ones are *the right* ones?

36 more to go.

BTW, I wrote before that two of my friends had problems with
compiling the kernel under Slackware 1.04. They both succeeded
when they correctly soft-linked the directory /usr/include/linux
(as described in README files somwhere in /usr/src/linux).

Problem No. 5 (about Seyon not working) should not be counted as
a problem, since it is not known who is the guilty party.

One day I could write a thick book called "Problems with SLS and Slackware".

I get the same problem.  Is there a patch yet?  If so, could someone please 
e-mail me the location?

The 2.0 server _blazes_ with the WD card.  I mean FAST.  I can do 
opaquemoves with windows 50% screen size and they look good.  

My solution to the problem:  I just don't kill the server.  Not a good 
solution.

Thanks.

Subject: Special character support for Linux?
Date: 7 Nov 1993 22:29:54 -0500

   Hi all. I frequently use Xcomm 4.1 to connect to other machines, 
DOS and other, for various things. It works great for machines that 
don't run DOS or don't use upper ascii characters, but for those that 
do it is unable to display the characters correctly. It manages to 
come close, by substituting similar characters, but it just doesn't 
look the way it should. I also noticed that the dos emulator, at least 
as it is set up on my machine, is also unable to display any sort of 
upper-ascii character associated with DOS. What I would like to know 
is this:

        Is there any Linux program out there, communications or other,
that allows the proper displaying of upper ascii characters exactly as 
they would look in DOS, or is this just impossible for Linux machines?

   I am also having trouble getting the dos emulator to do much of 
anything with color, nevermind any sort of graphics. Is this normal?
Any help on these things would be appreciated. Thanks!

I have an OAK 077 and Xfree 2 works great for me also.  I'm very happy

Either that or you could just mail the problems to Patrick.  He has
always been especially responsive about fixing problems.  I still don't
understand why you have to make such a big production everytime you
find a new bug.

BTW, it is probably not in good form to speak of Slackware and "that
other distribution" in the same breath.

Hi, all.
Recently I have got too many FAILUREs from my machine(386sx: 16Mh). So I
am seriously thinking of getting a new one. At the same time, I have heard
about Linux which raised a flag against all commercial OS. Though I am not
good at engineering stuff at all, I would really try that.

However, as far as I have heard, some computers from vendors(I can't
assemble my machine by buying pieces like MB, Harddisk, etc. I have no
idea.) are not compatible with the Linux. For example, Zeos doesn't intend
to provide other Video Boards except the Diamond's (Viper, Speedstar,
etc.) So, since I heard that the video board is not useful because Diamond is
doing BAD BUSINESS, I can't choose the machine. Another vendor, Micron
also offer Diamond graphic card. Also, Micornics' Mother Board(Only
Eisa) seems to have a problem with the Linux, which is offered by
Gateway2000. 

Or do they allow customers to choose each part of a machine? 

I would choose a machine from one of below vendors. Would you please
enlighten me what kinds of things should be concerned and avoided?

o  Gateway2000 486Eisa-VL

        Micronics Eisa board?

o  Tri-Star 486VL-EISA 
        (???) using PUMA? 2MB VL accelerator (Weitek P-9000 on it.)

release this, but I dont' work for them....  Sunworld is broadening it's
audience in January.  They will become "Advanced Systems".  Perhaps some
who read Sunworld will know of the "Advanced Systems Test Center".  I saw
it last weekend.  Funny sight.  Looks like my 3rd bedroom converted to
office  almost exactly.  Systems in funny places, doing funny things with
postits saying "don't touch".   Software on shelves, etc.

Hopefully, we can expect more coverage for Linux and other nonSun
things.  The shift has been going on for several months.

Again, hopefully, we can expect it to become a techno Unix mag.  I think
Unixworld's editorial content has declined significantly in the past two
years.  As an employee of Sunworld said "if the world goes to NT, our
strategy is fed.".  Hope it doesn't.  Get your Sunworld postcards
and SUBSCRIBE  it's not just for Sun anymore!

I don't work for Sunworld  a good highschool friend does.  I just wish
them luck with the Advanced Systems theme.

If anyone is wondering  yes, there are TWO ads for Linux in Sunworld
each month!!

I would be happy to hear what people think, or have people ask questions
about the shift.  I want to buffer the person at Sunworld  who is dealing
with the failure of NextWorld.  (He's a customer service rep and NextWorld
subscriber's flame him at least five times a day).
