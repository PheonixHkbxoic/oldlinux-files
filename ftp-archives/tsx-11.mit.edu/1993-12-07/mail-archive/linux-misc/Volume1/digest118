I've got EISA with 20 MB of RAM, and no ram-limitation for the kernel,
and it works GREAT :)

Subject: FOUND!: Cheap UK Ethercards
Date: Wed, 8 Sep 1993 18:22:59 GMT

A company called KeyZone, telephone 081 900 1525 sell an ethernet card
capable of AUI, Thinnet AND Twisted pair which is NE2000 and WD8013
compatible (jumperless) which I today had working (seemingly) reliably
with pl10. I use it in NE2000 mode.

The card costs 60 UK pounds, plus either 6 or 8 for delivery (depends whether
you want 24 hour or not) and then VAT.

The chip is a Winbond 89C9550 or something (a square one) and the card is
16 bit and comes with a sparce single page of documentation pointing you
to various readme files and software items.

It seems to work for me, anyway -- total cost for 24 hour delivery is
79.90 UKP (inv VAT, etc etc).

The cards are all sold on sale or return for 14 days, too. So you only
lose out on carriage if it doesn't work.

Hope that was of use to someone -- it's the cheapest I have found for a
card with UTP which works with Linux.

Subject: Networking problems...
Date: Wed, 8 Sep 1993 18:25:59 GMT

I have just proudly installed my new NE2000 compat ether card into a
system running pl10... well, except that I tried using pl12 for a while, then
put pl10 back and now incoming telnets say it's still pl12, but I'm not so
worried about that.

Telnet, Ftp, etc work fine to all local machines as root (the network is
local only, no external connection). However, all non-root users get
`service not available' or somesuch when you try to use them. I have set
all files in /etc and /conf/net to globally readable, except /etc/shadow and
it still doesn't work.

Also, I have to have an /etc/route line for every local host in 
/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 to make it work -- it can resolv hosts, but seems to
have a problem connecting without those route lines.

Any ideas ?

Chris.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix.
The FAQ for this group is available on rtfm.mit.edu in

Try recompiling the kernel with the co-pro emulation mode if you do not have 
a co-processor.  I have Linux working on my AMD-386/40 without any problem, though
I do have a math co-processor on it.  Seems new releases of Linux comes with 
FPU emulation turned off.  Hope this will help but if not, could be the motherboard.

Hi,

A friend of mine managed to foul up his boot sector during Linux installation.
Now when he boots, he goes straight to Linux - what he wants is to go to DOS.
He can reach DOS by a floppy boot, but then fdisk /mbd (or is it /mdb?) won't
fix it.

Can you help??

Reply-To: tor@spacetec.no

Don't forget that when IBM found that they needed a PC, they looked around to see
if they had something already that they could use.
And the PC was then based on a lab-computer one of their employees had built for his
own purpose.  That, as much as anything, defined what parts the PC should be
based on.
The guy with the lab-pc wrote an article in Byte many years ago, describing the
process of turning his box into the IBM PC.

The above is from memory only, but if my memory is not totally corrupted the outline
should be mostly correct.

From Peter Norton's "Inside the IBM PC" C 1986

Page 2

" The IBM PC made its first appearance in the fall of 1981.  By spring of
1982, PCs were being shipped in volume, but to everyone's amazement demand
far exceeded the supply. "

on Page 3 it goes on to say....  (highly paraphrased)

Compaq announced its first PC computer in the fall of 1982.  

The XT was released in the spring of 1983, and the PCjr came out
at the end of 1983.

Compaq released its first Deskpro series in the summer of 1984.

With the PCjr's flop, IBM came back with the AT model shortly
after the release of the Compaq Deskpro line.

Well so much for the history lesson.  Hope this clears up few of
those not so subtle "I know this is right ... I think ???"

Initial port of andrew toolkit version 5.1 is on sunsite:

==============================

This is a port of the andrew toolkit (5.1) to linux. This distribution
comprises all the applications. Missing from this distribution is

        andrew/include          # the include files
        andrew/lib/**/*.a       # all the libraries.

Notes:
        The 'sched' inset doesn't work. Apparently it doesn't work in
the original distribution either. i.e. it's not linux specific. 
        I haven't tested this extensively. If you find a bug, let me
know. 
        The fonts do strange things. Could someone with a reference
point please find out if this is normal, or if I have just missed
something in the setup. 

        For a quick start, run /usr/andrew/bin/help and read... and
read... 
        Obviously enough, this distribution requires the X windowing
system to run. Haveing all the fonts installed would be advantagous.

Is there support for per-process cputime and memory limits in Linux ? I have
just completed a port of the Monsanto NQS (network queueing system) and am
now playing around with it instead of cleaning it up for uploading.
Configuration so far was quite easy, requiring only a few ifdefs and a
modification of the load daemon to read /proc/loadavg. However, I would like 
to make this as complete as possible, and my current version does not enforce
cpu and mem limits (beyond the initial check at qsub, that is), while
niceness and filesize limits are properly enforced. I have found SIGXCPU
in signals.h, but no reference to it in the kernel sources.
Martin
BTW: my version is Monsanto 3.34, are there newer versions around ?
