Thanks God I have Slackware 1.0.5 set up
and running on my 486DX2-66 16M RAM. I have
16 Mb swap partition. What I noted is that even
if I logged off, the system pokes at hard disk with
about 1 min time interval for some mysterious
purpose. What does it do and would it be better
to somehow reduce HD usage especially when
I logged off ?

I've gotten it to work without any problems at all.  I have a 
Cardinal VGA 100 w/256k memory.  It is a bit slow, but not 
noticably different that 1.2's mono server.  (Never could get 1.3
to work with my card)

Don't get a Diamond card!  Among your choices listed,
I would recommend the Orchid card, though they seem to have 60ns DRAM, 
which limits the clock rate to 65MHz, which is lower than what is
needed to run the higher resolutions with good refresh.

Linux is currently running well on my Tower-format Escom 486DX2 50Mhz machine. which has LocalBus, a Cirrus 5428-based video card, and the Seagate 250MB Hard disc, currently no ethernet, CD or tape. The monitor I have is very crappy, though, and XFree86-1.3 doesn't seem to understand the interlace concept, so I would recommend getting a monitor that can do at least 1024x768 non-interlaced. I would also recommend getting more RAM than I currently have (4MB) as X runs very slowly, constantly swapping to disk

Yup.

:>|> I would also appreciate recommendations about which video card to buy.
:>|> 
First, don't buy Diamond. You only will have problems.
The IIT chipset are not yet supported, so from the above cards only the Orchid
Fahrenheit will work. 
Recommended cards (for performance at 1280x1024) are those cards listed
in the AccelCards database (/usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/AccleCards) using a s3 
86C928 chip and a Brooktree Bt485 RAMDAC
(though you have to have a VERY good 17'' monitor to make full use of this).
Most 17'' monitors can sync horizontally up to 64 kHz, perhaps up to 70.
This will give you, however, only 60Hz (65Hz) refresh, which is not good.
For 72 Hz refresh you should have a monitor capable to sync up to 80kHz.
If your monitor does not do this, you can get one of the cheaper 928 cards
using Sierra or AT&T RAMDACs which go up to 110MHz pixel clock.
You will not be able to use the higher performance of the other cards at 8bit 
colour then. If you want to run 16 or 24bit colour (not yet supported for XFree86)
you should get nevertheless one with the Bt485 RAMDAC.

And yet still another variation on a theme:

Well, I don't know why you wouldn't see color, but the VGA16 server is
basically guarenteed to be slower than the mono server.  Think about it.
There are 4 bit planes in 16 color mode, and only one in mono mode.  Worst
case, the 16-color server will be 1/4 the speed of the mono server.  I
don't think it's quite that bad, though.

There's no way the mono server is any faster than 1.3.  There were no
changes whatsoever to the code.  It's your imagination.

I'm about to trade an Irwin Accutrak tape drive for a Colorado 
Jumbo 250 so I can use my QIC-80 tapes with Linux. However, I have 
a SCSI disk controller (Adaptek 1542b) and seem to recall reading here
that the Colorado tape is extremely slow when used with the SCSI 
contorller.  Is this true? If so, is there a way to speed things up 
(such as using a different controller for the floppy tapes)?

Debian is NOT vaporware, it does exist. It is still in ALPHA, so we

What problems? I got the original tck/tk sources from purdue and they 
compiled without a hitch on my system, as well as xf2.0, which really 
really kicks ass.

The real bugger is that you have to REALLY watch the paths in the 
Makefile, else it'll belch, but other than that, it should work great. 
Try getting the originals from harbor.ecn.purdue.edu instead of someone 
else's precompiled binaries.

I'd only previously used CNews before getting the LGX disk.  After I
discovered that it uses INN, I subscribed to the NNTP group.  The
general consensus seems to be that INN is superior to CNews, and if I
ever get a real IP connection, then it's just a matter of tweaking the
newsfeeds file to take full advantage of NNTP.  I've uncovered only
one problem, so far.  My newsfeed is currently via UUCP, which makes
a call at 6:00am to pick up the latest batch.  If rnews starts
feeding the batches to innd during the call, UUCP starts dropping
packets like crazy and the call terminates with an error.  I never
had this problem with rnews feeding CNews during a call.  My theory
is that innd ups it priority during news unbatching, and uucico
gets so little CPU time it can't keep up with the serial line.  I
haven't had the time to look at this closely, so I might be wrong.

If anybody out there is having problems getting INN up, I can
forward the configuration file and changes I had to make.  Part
of it is based on /pub/Linux/system/Mail/inn-1.4-linux-0.1.tar.gz
from sunsite; if you want to hack it yourself, get this file
as bash apparently needs a few patches (I didn't bother confirming
this, I just patched bash).
