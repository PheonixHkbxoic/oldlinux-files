I agree with the original poster's header: I just installed the Slackware X stuff
last night and the S3 driver is excellent (XS3 was very good, but this is even
better). Kudos to all!

Now if only I could get XF86_Mono to run the hga on display 1...slackware's
binary seems to lack hga support.

Okay, I know emacs can do this, I don't want to hear things like:
        Well you should really use emacs instead of vi....
But how can I 'mark' text while in edit mode of vi?  I.e. I want
to mark the middle 50 lines of a file, and then 'clip' everything 
around this.  Does anyone know the command that will 'mark' a spot 
in the file?

I have a 386/25 with a Cyrix FastMath 387/33.  This chip works great for 
me.  I suspect that some problems may arise with this guy running his
chip faster than spec....

What you suggest did not help. I had to get newer binaries from
Slackware (diska2, package lpr.tgz). They came out owned by
deamon/deamon. Then I corrected file permissions and owners
as described above and things started to work, finally.

I'm running SLS 1.03, and ext2fs 0.3 (which came with the SLS
installation).  Recently I've been getting:

ext2_new_block: Unable to locate free bit in block group 16.

message popping up with great regularity even though there is lots of
room (between 8 and 14 meg) left on the hard drive partition.

Sometimes a similar message will pop up when I'm trying to run
applications and crash them (badly).  Other times it will prevent me
from pulling over files with ftp _until_ I erase something.

However, erasing something seems to be a stopgap, for the message
reappears later for no apparent reason.  Has anyone else had a similar
problem or know if ext2fs 0.4 will fix it?

please cc: responses to sanj@mit.edu.

Then it is the result of the device node not having been there where
it should have been, and some program writing to ttys3. No matter, the
fact remains that this plain file is (a) an error and (b) included in

m<letter> marks a line with the mark letter
'<letter> will go to that position, and tick is your previous line so
        '' (tick tick) will bounce you between two spots in a file.

This can be used to edit as usual:

        As other have already pointed out, the prices will probably drop.
Give it about a year.

        Of course my reasons for seeing Linux ported to the Alpha a a bit
different.  If the US gov't allows DEC to make the faster Alpha chip available
domestically, you could have a computer that the US gov't rates as a supercomputer,
with a couple of gig of HD and 128M of memory or so, running Linux and sitting
on your desktop.  IMO, there is something perversely "correct" about this... :-)

        This porting of linux to an ALPHA box sounds interesting but I'm

        over a 486DX2-66 or a pentium system (i.e. would video performance

I seemed to have been wrong on this point.  When running under linux
the screen does blank but that is due to linux, not the unit.  The
hard disk contunues to run (although it seems to get quieter) and the
unit gets very *hot*.  It gives the term "hot-key" a whole new
meaning.  Under DOS it stays much cooler.

Otherwise, experience with the machine is good.  I like the keyboard feel
but the trackball isn't that great to use in graphic applications.  It is
too insensitive and takes alot of spinning to move a small distance.  
Perhaps this can be adjusted in CMOS, I'll have to check. Otherwise I'm
considering just setting it up to use an external mouse  when I have the
space.

Date: 9 Nov 1993 15:05:54 -0500


I use OS/2, DOS, and Linux, all on the same machine.   I have a SB16
set up at IRQ 5 (primarily for OS/2's benefit) and under both DOS and
OS/2, everything's spiffy.

I'm trying to get Linux to accept the IRQ5 setting for the SB16.
I've run make config, indicated that I wanted neither SCSI nor bus
mouse support (both of which can use IRQ5), that I did want sound
support and that I wanted IRQ5 to be used for the Sound Blaster 16,
etc.

No matter what I do, when I boot the new kernel I get "IRQ5 already in
use" and "/dev/dsp busy" messages.  Changing the kernel config back to
IRQ7 gives me truncated sound (which is expected, given that IRQ
mismatches commonly resulted in this).    OS/2 is the master at
finding IRQ mismatches.  I'm fairly certain that nothing in my machine
(other than the SB16) is configured to use IRQ 5.   I can't change the
SB16 setup to use IRQ7 just to satisfy Linux, because OS/2 wants LPT1
to be IRQ7.


Any ideas?    If you send email I'm summarize to save a bit of bandwidth.

I think the real problem is that the FPU is not rated for the clock speed
it's being run at. I have an IIT 3C87-40DX and run it under Linux with
XFree86 2.0 with no problems.

Hello,

I've just got linux SLS release up and running on my PC, but I was
messing with recompiling the kernel. I had to modify the
/usr/src/linux/Makefile to recursively use "-I/root/usr/include" when
making dependencies and using the CPP macro.

The problem I have now is I read some postings, looks like I need to
do:

cd /usr/src/linux
make config
make dep
make clean
make zlilo (instead of zImage?)

Are these the right steps?

I haven't read all that much on linux yet, but what else do I need to
do to get the usual stuff set up?

I know about mail etc. what else is there?


Last question. How do I get X-Windows to run, I try to start openwin,
or xinit etc. Gives me some errors about display devices. Where's
the config files etc? I hoped someone could get me on the right
track first.

Thanks,

The Hurd is the operating system under development by the Free Soft-
ware Foundation; its primary author is Michael Bushnell.  The Hurd
design assumes that some sort of ``micro''-kernel such as CMU's Mach
3.0 will provide all the low-level services; the Hurd's task will be
to add a layer of functionality, providing POSIX-compliant interfaces
(such as signals and terminal drivers).

The big point of contention is between future Hurd users and current
Linux users.  Various issues being debated back and forth are:

 * Availability: Linux is here, now.  Hurd is still mostly vaporware.
   You can get it if (a) you already have a machine with Mach on which
   to do work, and (b) you are willing to do work.  This narrows the
   field considerably.

 * Portability: Linux is welded to the 386 architecture.  Hurd will
   run on any hardware that has a Mach 3.0 port, but that's just the
   386 and (ha!) DEC pmax right now (DEC Alpha and SPARC ports are
   rumored).  The Mach 3.0 base should also allow easy porting to
   multi-processor architectures in the future.

 * Features: Mr. Bushnell's paper on the Hurd describes some abso-
   lutely mouth-watering services that the Hurd will make available;
   Ange-FTP's features provided in a real filesystem, terminal drivers
   with an installable Readline interface, and the like.  So Linux
   programmers have been saying ``We can do these in Linux, too!''.
   This is true, but it's more thanks to Linux's every-user-is-an-
   operator nature than anything else.  (The paper talks a little
   about these issues.)

 * Size: GNU software rarely qualifies as ``small'', and the picture
   painted of the Hurd (possibly incorrect) is that it's something
   along the lines of GNU Emacs.  If this is true, you'll need a lot
   of RAM on your machine to run it.  With luck, 16Mb RAM chips will
   be cheap by then...

Me, I'm sticking with Linux until I have a home machine that can run
the Hurd with a MTBF of a couple of days.  Then I'm switching.
