Please read the press release. What will be released is the API
specifications; not an actual implementation. Developing an
implementation will be up to the companies interested in doing so, the
FSF, etc. (Just trying to head off any wild rumors early.)

It should work without patches in the current dosemu; the patches allowed
access to some ports dosemu 0.48.2 didn't give access to, but in 0.49 this can
be done in /etc/dosemu/config without recompiling (look in the manual for the
"ports" directive).

Subject: LILO
Date: 23 Nov 93 14:05:01 GMT

Hello People,
        I am new to Linux and have been working my way into the system enthusiastically.
I have a 386-40, 8MB RAM, and 255 MB drive (105MB for Linux, 150 for DOS).  I have two
questions regarding Linux.  

        1)  I can not seem to get LILO installed properly on my hard drive and have to
            either leave disk A1 in (to boot LILO) or leave my system disk in (to boot
            directly to Linux).  I would like to aviod using the diskette drive.  What
            am I missing?  I did select LILO installation, and I did run the commands
            as described in the Linux manual to install LILO on the hard drive.

        2)  I have a Diamond SonicSound card w/ SCSI interface.  I also have access
            to SCSI hard drives for next to nothing.  However, Linux dows not
            apparently recognize the SCSI controller on the card (Future Domain).  I
            get the feeling that I have simply not configured the controller under
            Linux.  Any ideas?

Thanks in advance.

Paul Nixon

I installed Linux quite a while ago, now I put OS/2 2.1 on my HD.
I use LILO to boot DOS and Linux.  OS/2 is on a logical disk in an
extended partition.  I installed LILO to boot from that partition, but
OS/2 doesn't come up.  What's the prob ?  How can I solve it ?
What I do now is to keep the OS/2 boot manager, and LILO boots this, and
I have to choose OS/2 second time...

It's an Adaptec 1542B and a ST4677N.
/dev/sda1 is the primary DOS
/dev/sda2 is the OS/2 boot manager
/dev/sda3 is the extended DOS drive
/dev/sda4 is the Linux partition
/dev/sda5 is the logical drove for OS/2

Thanks in advance,

TinyX is merely a repackaging of the Xfree releases into
smaller versions that fit on one floppy. The servers are identical
to those found in SLS, slackware, the Xfree distribution, etc.
the primary limitations to tinyX were space: i reduced the amount
of fonts to very few above the ones required to use XFree,
also, i removed the compile time libraries so you cannot build
new xwindows applications with them.

the latest version of tinyX is 2.0, it is available on

sunsite.unc.edu (i'm not sure if it has left incoming yet)
and opine.cs.umass.edu:/linux/tinyX

you can use any xprogram that will not complain about specific fonts
that tinyX may not have (see above)

good luck!!

Subject: [Q] Linux and IDE/SCSI Drives / 8mm Backup / Irwin Backup / Digiboar
Date: Sun, 21 Nov 93 17:24:14 GMT

Hi all,

Could someone point me in the right direction for the following questions:

1) Will Linux support both IDE and SCSI drives in one system?  I would like
   to install 350MB SCSI as the system disk and the 120MB IDE drive as a
   /var or something to that effect...

2) Are drivers available to use an Exabyte 8200 8mm tape drive or does a
   software such as ftape support such a thing?  I would like to use the
   office 8mm unit once in a while to make a full backup but obviously it
   needs to be a working solution which would have to work from floppy
   should I need to fully restore my system (god forbid...)

3) As a more permanent solution to backups, I am planning on getting an
   Irwin Accutrak QIC-80 compliant tape unit, but again I need to know if
   this unit is supported by Linux / ftape.  If so, where would I find the
   drivers or software required for this.

4) Last but not least, I am being offered a Digiboard (8 port) unit and
   I would like to know if anyone has had any luck in getting this to
   work within Linux.  If so, could I be pointed in the right direction
   as to where I could find the software required to get the Digiboard
   going?

Thank you in advance.  If some of this was available via FAQ's, please
let me know as well as the name of the FAQ.

Doug!

I think it was Ed Carp (erc@apple.com) and you don't need patches, just
a few statements in the /etc/dosemu/config file.  Find out the ports
BigMouth uses, and just put this in:

ports { XXX YYY ... }

You mean I'm not the only one who finds this dubious?

Consider, folks:

* NeXTStep for Intel only just came out, with a price tag which will limit its
  spread.  If OpenStep were released, companies could easily undercut NeXT.

* Sun going with a NeXTStep clone is rather unlikely now that they've taken
  a major traumatic step in adopting Motif to support COSE.

And, most importantly:

* NeXTStep is NeXT's only product now!*  I have real trouble imagining them
  staying in business at all after this move... unless this announcement is
  for real, in which case I'd say its NeXT's way of annoucing that they've
  suddenly decided that they can't cut it as a software company.  (Well, yes,
  they could be turning into a Cygnus-like organization, but it seems a rather
  strange move to me.)

Subject: SUMMARY: Linux CD's
From: es@ritz.mordor.com (E. Coli)
Date: Wed, 24 Nov 1993 00:02:41 GMT

As I see it, after all the information that was emailed to me after I 
asked about the Linux CD's, I've come to a few conclusions.

1) none of the "assembled" versions of the Linux CD's are really any 
good.  JANA, Yggdrasil, etc., are all still pretty unfinished.

2) What some CD's offer, they don't provide.  Not something you want to 
find out *after* you've spent your money.

3) It's more useful to have a CD full of *source* for programs rather 
than a CD full of *binaries* and a *running system*.  It may be *more 
convenient* for a CD full of binaries, but less useful.

---

 The one CD that I'm impressed with is the TSX-11 CD that is available 
for $15.  On that CD should be the SLS distributions as they are on 
TSX-11, and the linux sources on TSX-11.

  This is what I'm going to go with, and what I suggest everyone else to 
go with.

  Now, if the person who emailed me selling the TSX-11 CD would kindly 
send me the mail again, I'll send him the check as I think I lost his 
address.

Well it's in my opinion that the glory of MCC is that it DOESN'T have all

Trying a `minicom -s' to override the defaults (eg, serial line
is set wrong) causes a SEGV.  Since the source is not supplied,
you have to get it from archive site and recompile.

It reboots alright, but it doesn't run shutdown, so no disk syncing/umounting
is done.  This is because init expects to find reboot in /usr/bin, when
it's actually in /bin.

INN needs to be completely resinstalled.

I don't mean to shoot you down, but wouldn't it have been more beneficial to
have implemented the YooHoo/2U2 handshake _before_ EMSI, since it's in wider
use (especially with mailers such as BinkleyTerm 2.50 and earlier)?

I'll second that....and third it or fourth if necessary :-).  It's small,
unified, and well tested...(the size has a lot to do with this).  It's
also *very* easy to add packages to.  I like it just like it is.  The
main problem is that Owen is so busy with his regular duties that he has
trouble keeping MCC current (and well tested...he doesn't like releasing
something that isn't proven to be stable).

I have a very similar setup.  I'm using LILO to boot to Linux, DOS, or
OS/2 boot manager.  There is just one entry in boot manager, namely OS/2.
I set the timeout value to 0, so booting to OS/2 is instantaneous.
My setup is as follows:

   Device Boot  Begin   Start     End  Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hda1           1       1     427  215176+   6  DOS 16-bit >=32M
/dev/hda2   *     428     428     432    2520    a  OPUS
/dev/hda3         433     433     654  111888    5  Extended
/dev/hda5   *     433     433     575   72040+   7  OS/2 HPFS
/dev/hda6   *     576     576     596   10552+   7  OS/2 HPFS
/dev/hda7   *     597     597     654   29200+   4  DOS 16-bit <32M

   Device Boot  Begin   Start     End  Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hdb1           2       2     200   60496   83  Linux native
/dev/hdb2         201     201     650  136800   83  Linux native
/dev/hdb3         651     651     683   10032   82  Linux swap

godori [/etc/lilo] 4 > cat config
boot = /dev/hda
install = /etc/lilo/boot.b
other = /dev/hda1
        label = DOS
image = /vmlinuz
        label = Linux
        root = /dev/hdb1
        vga = normal
        READ-ONLY
other = /dev/hda2
        label = OS2



OS/2 boot manager is shown as 'OPUS'.
Hope this helps..
