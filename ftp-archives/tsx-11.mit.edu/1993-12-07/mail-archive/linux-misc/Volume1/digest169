Sounds like a 25Mhz 386!

The BogoMips = (cpu_mhz / 2) seems true only for 486's.
Ya gotta divide by 4 for a 386 (a 486 = 2 * 386).

If someone has some problems with the tn3270 emulator, your welcome
to send them to me (please describe/supply as much information
as you can, so that I can reproduce the problem).  I've recently
had to pick the old sources again and merge them with the new
net-2 stuff and get the whole thing to compile again (it was
actually easier this time than the first time), so that I could
fix a problem with unformated screen (it was looping under
certain circustances).  I have a few other things I want to
fix, and maybe I can fix some other problems that are troubling
people along the way (no promises).

I have just talked with WordPerfect Corporation. I talked to Anna (I think)
of their Unix Information service.

WordPerfect 5.1 is currently running on:

        Sun/space SUNOS
        IBM RS-6000 AIX
        Data General Avion
        HP 9000 700 & 800 series
        SCO Unix / Xenix
        (MS-DOS)

Now, if you would like a copy of WordPerfect for Linux, write a well
constructed letter (not like my normal postings...) to the WordPerfect
Unix Marketing Division:


        F.A.O. Brant McKinley,
        Unix Marketting Division,
        WordPerfect Corporation,
        1555 N. Technology Way
        Orem,
        Utah 84057,
        U.S.A.

Or call them on 1-801-225-500, Or Fax them on 1-801-222-5077

I think WordPerfect would be *the* perfect addition to my machine. I can
survive without spreadsheets, databases, games, X, everything else, but
I *must* be able to write letters and reports. For that, I telnet to a SCO
box...

What is your machine like? Mine says 33 or so, and that's a 486/66.

Is there really noone out there who knows what a BogoMip is? If it's
a Bogus Mip, what distinguishes it from a real Mip?

I just sent my email and it occurs to me that I hope this is being
done with a "control".  That is to say this of course only counts
USENETed/groupies of Linux not ALL Linux users.  A sensible control might be to
count DOS or Windows or Windows/NT or OS2 users (or all the above) by posting a
similar request on appropriate groups for each.  This way some (albeit
imprecise) renormalization can be done for the bias due to the method of
sampling.

Hi everyone,

Does some one tell me which distribution is the best and less bug ? I plan the install the CD version. Where can I get it ? Is it difficult to install ? Is the system come with a user menu and installation guide (just like MS-DOS) ? Please give me a idea.

Let me restate your problem: you want to put a bunch of files onto
floppy but you don't want to be restricted to DOS filename conventions.

There's no need to format a floppy with ext2fs (or any other Linux fs).
Just use tar and dd:

        tar cf - files-for-floppy | dd of=/dev/fd0 bs=16k

To list the contents of the floppy just:

        dd if=/dev/fd0 bs=16k | tar tvf -

To extract one or more files:

        dd if=/dev/fd0 bs=16k | tar xf - files-to-extract

Hope this helps.

Tim

a 340MB SCSI HD with Adaptec 1542c bus master controller. The configuration 
is that I use the IDE drive as the boot drive. Since the total space

is 100MB reserved for DOS5.0, while the rest is for Linux. My question

Use the source luke. Being lazy, and relying on an unreliable memory,
it it simply the number of times a loop runs in 1 second. The loop
consists of two instructions (being a dec, followed by a jump).

So, if you are feeling really silly, you can multiply it by 2 and call
it MIPS. Or you can divide it by 5 have the number of rabbits that can
dance on the head of a pin (where 'pin' is something that Bogomips/5
rabbits can dance on).

The kernel now supports remounting root read-only, and I've got a copy of

seems to be something missing to complete the loop.  Specifically a decent  
shutdown, and a debugged rc script that checks if an ext2 partition is clean  
before running fsck.

Has anyone got this working properly?

 Umm... Why the repititive-redundancy?  Tar can use the disk driver,
too.  Using dd doesn't make much sense.  
The same commands ( in the same order ) are:
tar cf /dev/fd0 file-for-floppy

tar tvf /dev/fd0

tar xf /dev/fd0 files-to-extract

Tar works quite nicely with the disk drive - I used this method to shuttle
large amounts of large files between computers, when no faster method
was available.
