Subject: Don't compile kernel using LGX sources.
Date: Thu, 28 Oct 1993 17:26:26 GMT

After much messing about trying to get a new kernel built using the
Yggdrasil LGX source files, I finally gave up on the LGX sources and
kermitted a clean distribution of patch level 13.

The first time I configured the _real_ pl 13 kernel sources, I wasn't
paying attention and told it not to include support for the SCSI
controller I have.  That, of course, didn't work. :)

After proper configuration, it compiled, linked, and ran the first
try.


The LGX sources have several problems.  The high points are:

1) The /usr/src/linux/fs/proc directory is missing completely.

   (Once I got the .99.13 proc stuff, it wouldn't compile with the LGX
   header files -- which I _assumed_ were .99.13, since their
   advertisements claim it's a .99.13 kernel.)

2) The include files are NOT the same as those distributed with the pl13
   kernel.

3) The configure script isn't the one distributed w/ .99.13.

   If you answer "no" to IN2000, and then try to comple you get
   errors.

If you've got LGX, and want to rebuild the kernel, get the kernel
souces from somewhere else.  The ones installed by the LGX CD are
broken.

My new kernel includes patches to fix the problem that the hercules
driver had when exitting X.  That works great, and the new kernel is
over 100K smaller than the one installed by LGX.  Yea, I know, 100K
out of 8M isn't worth worrying about, but...

I remember when we used to run an 8 user pdp11 V7 system with 256K
words of memory and 40M of disk.  And we _liked_ it!  God I feel old.

Subject: VAX Fortran to C ($$- Follow Up!!)
Date: 28 Oct 1993 17:37:07 -0400

About two weeks ago I posted a request for help on finding a VAX Fortran 
to C converter for linux.  I recieved many helpfull replies from people 
directly involved in this area.  Unfortunantly our hard drive crashed and 
all of the replies and names and contacts I had gathered were lost!  

If you sent me a reply, I would greatly appreciate if you could reply to 
me again.  There is a good possibility this could lead to contract work, 
or a project leading to a VAX Fortran to C library/utility.   I am 
particulary interested in the fellow who is working on the GNU Fortran 
compiler, and the company that makes Fortran to C utilities, and really 
any one else who replied.  Thanks,

Stephen

I would be interested to see what you find out.  I am editor of the

one MS-DOS system networked.  It works but you are right, it isn't

and then hangs.

I've got a similar problem with my drive (an old ESDI 1225x15x36 320MB
clunker).

i also noticed the "wrap-around" effect of >1024 cylinders.  I couldn't
get linux to install reliably when I had it partitioned like this.

i finally managed to get it to fdisk, mke2fs, and install by making
one primary partition from the start of the disk to the 1024 cylinder
limit, and then an extended partition for the remaining cylinders.

i'm using the extended partition (cylinders 1024 to 1225) for a 16MB
swap partition and a (approx) 32MB dos partition.


when I find a fix for this (maybe there's a newer version of fdisk than
the one on the SLS a1 disk), then i'll do a complete re-install.  

btw, has anyone noticed that the version of fdisk on the SLS a1 disk (v1.3)
is much newer than the one that actually gets installed by SLS (v 0.93)?  

hmmm....odd.  I just noticed that v1.3 appears to do the wrap-around thing
with >1024 cylinders, while v0.93 doesn't.

here's what 0.93 says:

Looks like Peter has benefited well from his SLS, and other people's
efforts. Now that he's finished supplying defective Linux systems to
the people on the internet, he's trying to inflict the same on the
public at large.

Say NO to SLS!

Subject: Summary: Questions in non-help groups
Date: Thu, 28 Oct 1993 22:39:06 GMT

My effort has petered out after a couple of weeks. I received a few basic
classes of responses:

1) "I think my question is appropriate for the group."
2) "There is too much traffic in c.o.l.help."
3) "I post where the gurus are."
4) "I wanted more visibility/faster response."
5) "I didn't know."

In addition from my observations many of the groups are write only becuase
the same questions come up over and over and over again. If posters just
scanned the last week of messages, much of the time they would find an
answer and would not have to post. Also many questions/answers can be found
in the FAQ's and HOWTO's. People don't read them much of the time.

It seems to me that this a bad situation and it's not going to get any better
because the querants don't do any basic research before posting. After
running this survey for a couple of weeks my conclusions are the same:

1) Don't answer inappropriate questions.
2) Direct people to the correct answers (HOWTO, FAQ, whatever).
3) Redirect questions to comp.os.linux.help.

Comments welcome. Survey responses upon request. Followup to c.o.l.misc only.

Later,

BAJ
