Why I do comment on this ? I'm not going to bash any os here,
will not advocate NT or linux or Mac or Windows or Unix in general.
A user chooses the environment best fitted to his or her needs
and what your needs are, that makes the difference.

Nevertheless I took a considerable amount of time to read through this
thread (the biggest thread I ever saw in comp.os.linux) as it may help
me to get a clue what the future will bring. This thread at this time
isn't unnatural, as Windows NT and UNIX SVR4 are fighting a battle
against each other right now (not in this group but in the market and
the development laboratories), and the battle is getting louder almost
each day.

Let me have a try to sort out, what is not important: I guess, that
the vast majority of users with a PC or a MAC at home are completely
satisfied with windows/DOS or Apples system. A big collection of
applications is commercially available, and most users do nothing more
then text processing, contacting some kind of dail in service every
now and then to do some accounting or so, and playing. They don't need
the features of NT, but they don't need the features of UNIX
either. If I do not earn my living as a software developer, I would
be quite happy with a 386 PC running Windows 3.1.

Who asks for more ? Business, of course. Almost any serious computer
application used in business is networked in some kind due to the work
sharing nature of today's production methods. This ranges from taking
a disk out of one computer and walk over to another (or handing the
disk to a colleague, who then walks over to another) up to worldwide
internetworked LAN's using any means of telecommunication services.

In the past, the had been two very different solutions for networking:
the historically older one was the use of mainframe computers - the
company had one big computer and a lot of terminals. This is dying and
we can forget about that. The other solution was running a dedicated
server for some of the resources needed by daily work: printers and
files. IMHO the most successul network solution of this kind has been
Novell. The reasons for that are relevant for what we are discussing
here. Novell ran on rather cheap PC's - most of them had been in a
company before they decided to network them. That's history: today's
normal use of computers in business started by buying the computers
and later network them as an add-on. And cheap PC's were due to the
success of DOS/Windows well-equipped with the applications you
need. You don't want to loose them just to get a network.

Windows 3.x/DOS never had network capabilities built in, novell had
been always a kind of patch for that, and for that reason networks of
PC's had been rather limiting. If you had more network needs then
sharing files and printers - and this is becoming more and more common
- at least one of the machines in your network had to run a different
OS. The need to switch the OS when you want to grow further had 
been the domain of Unix or VMS.  

Unix had network capabilities almost from the date of its birth.  You
need multitasking and multiuser features to run a network properly. A
big bunch of "background" tasks are involved in running a network. The
big advantage of unix is, that it has been designed from the beginning
to run such tasks. It is designed for speed and heavy load.

It is not designed to be user friendly. Unix maintenance is
complicated. If you want a GUI you get X windows with its until
recently open decision about the look and feel of applications
(OpenLook, Motif, Athena ?). If you want your fancy WYSIWYG
textprocessing application, your choice is rather limited and TeX or
troff is probably not for you.

Windows NT is Microsoft's try to combine server performance and
network capabilities with a successfull and well designed user front
end on one machine. The COSE (Common Open System Environment) standard
which consists of (basically) Unix SVR4 and X Windows/Motif is the
Unix manufacturers try to accomplish the same task.  While Microsoft
wants to expand to the market of server machines, COSE is aimed at
Microsoft's domain of end user machines. Each one wants what the other
has. Both sides have their chances: Microsoft offers a lot of
different applications for its OS but is known to waste performance
and its network capabilities are not as flexible (yet).  Unix is much
faster on the same hardware, comes with ready to run, well tested
network software (as far as I know, the only WAN solution), but is
lacking the availabilty of a comparable amount of application
software.  Windows NT is available, COSE not (or better, not all of
it). Windows is installed on the majority of unexpensive PC Hardware,
while Unix is currently mostly running on rather expensive
workstations.  With WABI, the COSE group attacks Microsofts biggest
advantage. From my point of view, Windows is ahead - in the sense that
for the time being it is more capable of doing things unix has been
normally used for - but when WABI will be stable and available, COSE
is getting closer.  A PC running Solaris and WABI will be faster then
a PC running Windows NT.  It will better fit into any network
environment. But the market does not wait.

Hmmm..."silent", eh?  people like Drew Eckhardt?  Eric Youngdale?  Linus

Not very competent, eh?  I'd like to see *you* write a kernel from scratch.
Or implement DLL's.  Or implement SCSI drivers.  Unless, of course, you

Snicker.  Seems to be one person doing that, i.e. Peter MacDonald.  But
the others are providing a legitimate service.  Hey, it costs *real money*
to mass-produce CD-ROMs...

And, in any case, there's nothing in the GPL that says you can't make money
redistributing GPLed software.  You just can't restrict redistribution of
it.

Hahahahahaha!  This is a huge laugh!  Let's see a show of hands.  Who uses
Windoze/MS-LOSS to do "real work", and who uses Linux to do real work?

I've got news for you, pal, the only thing I use MS-LOSS for is *games*.
I don't use Windoze for anything at all.

There's only one type of "real work" I would agree that people use
Windoze/MS-LOSS for, and that's word processing.

Oh, sure.  Accurate.  Objective.

Well, if your numbers are accurate and, more importantly, objective, then
you should have no problem proving your case.  So cough up some verifiable
numbers, your methodology for arriving at them, etc.  Or shut up.

Oh, yeah?  A year, eh?  Without any changes, eh?  Then why is the code on
tsx-11 dated July 30, with the *oldest* thing in there being May 11 (the

I checked this out myself (should have checked out my earlier statement.
Oh well), and it turns out to be true from what I can tell.

SCSI QIC-80 might hit the market, but given that there's 525 meg QIC-02
in SCSI format, I won't hold my breath.

However, my statement stands if QIC-80 becomes bigtime enough for someone
to do a SCSI implementation.

This isn't a statement by someone with a fanatic mentality???  Looks like
it is to me.  Most people in their right mind don't consider Unix to be a
toy OS...

Especially when you consider that it is the OS of choice for real-time work,
or large networking, or scientific computing, or...you get the point.  Maybe.

Hahahahaha!  The "new unix"?  Suuuuurrrreee.  Because Bill Gates said so,

So how are you defining "a few years"?  Give a specific definition to that
and we'll talk.

Perhaps.  But as an alternative to Unix, not as a replacement of Unix.  After
all, I'll bet that's what DEC and Silicon Graphics have done.  I'll bet DEC
is still offering Ultrix on their machines.

You know how much people have invested in Unix?  A *lot*.  Hardware vendors
aren't stupid enough to ignore that.

Suuuurrrreee.  Like I said, define "a few years" and we'll talk.

That's because the niche it was going to fill has already been filled by

They're still going strong, fool.  It's not as primetime as it could be

Peter MacDonald isn't the guy who wrote the kernel and isn't the guy who
is releasing the kernel.  Linus Torvalds is, and he hasn't said when 1.0
is going to be released (actually, I don't think he's mentioned the conditions
that have to be satisfied before 1.0 is released).

You're assuming that the Linux community is a large corporation or something.
It doesn't work that way.  Linus is the guy who makes new kernel releases,
but people have the option of releasing their own kernels if they want.  We
let Linus do it because (a) he wrote the thing, and so probably has a better
idea of the overall condition of the kernel than anyone else, and (b) it
reduces confusion by an order of magnitude.

Now Microsloth, on the other hand, is a large corporation and is *supposed*
to act as a single entity.  When it says that NT is going to be released at
such-and-such a date, it *presumably* knows what it's talking about.  But
obviously that's not true of Microsloth, since it's way behind schedule in
releasing NT.

Now, I would agree with you that Linux is late if Linus himself said that
1.0 was going to be released on such and such a date.  But I haven't seen
him say that.  If you claim he did, then produce the original posting or
shut up.

The QIC-80 driver.  :-)

Actually, I just grabbed the code and looked at it.

The "loadable device driver" code isn't as specific as that.  It can be
used to add *any* code to the kernel.  You can add new filesystems with
it, new device drivers, etc.  All the code you're adding has to have is
an init routine and a cleanup routine.  The patches add support to remove
character and block devices (since you have to touch the file operation
tables as well as the system call table).

BTW, you don't necessarily want the SCSI drivers (or any disk drivers)
loadable: you may have to boot your system from such a device, and if
it's not already in the kernel when it comes up, you lose.

So...heh, heh...can your vaunted NT deal with loading *anything you want*
into kernel space for any purpose?  Or does it distinguish between devices,
filesystems, and other things for the purposes of loading and unloading?

Fixing the existing drivers is as simple as adding an init and cleanup
routine to each.  Device drivers are simply the ".o" files that result
from compiling to object code.

Version checking can be done in the init routine.  Since a driver isn't
activated until it installs itself in the system call table, you don't
have to worry about something being "installed" if the init fails.

>Of course
>some sheep would say you can enable that by recompiling the kernel.
>That's loadable alright! Heh.

Nope.  If it makes it in the standard distribution, then recompiling the
kernel won't be necessary.

I agree that loadable drivers is a good thing, but you must keep in mind
that it's not a terrifically wonderful thing.  It's something that, if
you have the source to the kernel, you can easily live without.  The caveat
is that you have to know what you're doing a bit more than you might if
you had loadable drivers.  And you have to reboot to see the changes.

>The current loadable modules project doesn't have the blessings of the

What's "Larix"?

Something needn't have the initial blessing of the linux developers to make
it into the kernel.  Anyone distributing Linux can add it and distribute it
that way.  The GPL insures that you can do that.

When the loadable driver code gets out of alpha testing, it'll likely be
made part of the standard kernel, if there's enough demand for it.  That
something is a neat idea doesn't automatically justify it becoming part of
the standard distribution.  It has to be useful to the vast majority of
people out there.

Would it be?  I don't know.  It would be useful to developers in all
likelihood.  It would be less useful to the average user who doesn't
reconfigure their system constantly.

Got news for you, but most people doing development work on Linux don't
give a shit about SLS.  Why?  Because most of them are bright enough to
put together their own Linux system from the individual pieces instead
of having them packaged nice and neat for them.  That's how *I* put
my system together, and that's why I know just how small a minimal Linux
setup can get.

BTW, WINE and WINAPI have zero connection to SLS itself, save that they
can be distributed through SLS (and any other distribution that wants to).

>Of course someone said WABI! and all the sheep started repeating WABI!
>WABI!! WAAABI!!, and soon they believed it. First of all, WABI is a

The project is now called WINE in order to alleviate that confusion.  And
yes, it's a *binary* interface for Windoze programs.

That's right.  That's exactly what is under development.

Yeah?  Why's that?  The API is published.  The binary interface can
(obviously) be reverse-engineered.  What's so hard about it?  You only
have to know what you're doing.

>All that is under linux is an attempt to make applications written for

Wrong.  That's WINAPI, a different project.

That, of course, remains to be seen, but do you have any *technical*
objections to the project?  You think that Windoze is something magical
or something?  You think that there's something intrinsic about it that
can't be duplicated?  You think the API is something so special that it
can't even *in principle* be duplicated?  If you believe any of those
things, then you're more naive than any of us suspected (to the extent
that you don't know a damn thing about how computers *really* work).
