Linux could have been a good start point to do Hurd. (I know it you have
taken time to port Linux to Mach 3.0.) Instead the FSF choose
to use bsdss as a developping platform and to write an OS from scratch.

Since one needs some licences to use bsdss, it seriously retricted the
number of people who could do anything useful for Hurd. I welcome the call
for volunteers but I don't think they'll get many positive responses. (I
sincerely hope I'm wrong about that prediction.)

The decision to start from scratch meant that there wouldn't be any free OS
from the FSF for some time. Meanwhile some Hurd enthousiasts got tired of
waiting and choose to use Linux.

I don't think Hurd will be released soon, until then it's still
vaporware. (No matter how loud the FSF claims to have something that is
almost usable: that's not enough) I prefer innovative OS software to
super-hyper-innovative OS vaporware. 

I sincerely wish that Hurd will be released soon enough to be a success.

  Folks, give yourself a chance to wait for Debian Linux. As an
ALPHA tester, I feel that Debian Linux is the most *friendly*
OS that I have ever installed. The most important point is not it
works, it works *right*.  (not bashing SLS, SLS is a perfect OS for
those who have plenty of time and knowledge to tune everything up,IMHO).

  Current Debian Linux is 0.03 ALPHA. If you have interest send
mail to debian-linux-request@netcom.com with "help" on the body,
or simply "echo help|mail debian-linux-request@netcom.com".  --yuan

There's a very simple solution to doing 1024x768 on a 14".  Increase the
default font size for things like xterm (I made mine a good bit bigger).
You still can get a goot bit of stuff on the screen (icons, etc) and xv
images don't cover the whole window like in lower resolutions.  If you
need to zoom in, just have a lower mode ready and give it the C-A-+ switch.

I've just finished the initial stages of a port of the National Radio 
Astronomy Observatory's AIPS package to Linux.  I have completed the
"Dirty Dozen Tests" in "test" (data-grinding) mode, and am now working on the 
tape drivers (with the net and ftp, though, tape transport of image data is 
going to be used less and less...).  The other sub-tasks are a priority, 
though, as well as setting up AIPS's internal shared libraries (I'm using
static right now).

For those not in the know, AIPS stands for Astronomical Image Processing
System.  It does imaging, "cleaning", deconvolution, Fourier transformations, 
and a host of other very computationally-intensive tasks, as well as providing 
image display services and daemons to service requests for tape mounting
from remote sites (which is not particularly important on a desktop PC).
The total package of source code and doc's comes in a 57 MEG tar file, 
and takes up a good 100-200 MB of space compiled, excluding image data.

Right now I am running it on a 386DX/33, so it's quite slow, but anyone 
desiring to do real crunching with it will likely have a 486 (hopefully 
a DX2/66).  The X-windows portions work flawlessly (so far).

AIPS currently runs on Convexes, assorted IBM (not PC) machines, VAXen, 
all flavors of Suns, and even Crays (there are others too, I forget them 
all), but this is its first foray into the PC world.  Chalk up another
one for Linux!  (My PC is "boldly going where no PC has ever gone before"
right now.)

In terms of time versus budget for radio astronomers, this could likely
prove very beneficial.  Up until now, a 10,000 dollar or so investment
was needed to start running AIPS.  I'm running it on a $1000 dollar
386, with a couple of old disk drives (ESDI) from two retired Sun
3/60's for storage space, as well as a 250 MB IDE drive that has
Linux and my regular work on it.  Not a high-dollar setup...I was ecstatic 
when I got the first "Begin the one true AIPS number..." message showing
that it was alive. 

Any Radio Astronomers out there who use Linux, please E-mail me!
I will definitely need beta-testers for this who are familiar with Linux.
I, myself, am not very up-to-speed on AIPS techniques for imaging, so 
a couple of imaging wizards could really put this thing through some
testing.

I have been in contact with NRAO a good bit of late, and this, if
it proves stable and decently fast, could become another supported
architecture for the package.  Have to see though.  I plan on demonstrating
what I have to them soon.  (I'm doing this port totally on my own, in
my spare time.  I'm also flunking my classes because of it.  Oh, well,
what the hell!

Subject: HELP: unable to mount root
Date: 4 Nov 1993 09:41:00 GMT


Hello,

  I'm afraid I screwed up my system.

I was using e2fsck (from SLS 1.01) and it complained that there wasn't
a /lost+found directory. So I created one and ran e2fsck again.
After a while it hang (that is there wasn't any screen output or 
harddisk access for like 5 minutes) so I terminated it (using ^C), cd'ed
to lost+found and tried a ls -F. There where tons of error messages from the 
filesystem (which I don't remember exactly, but they were all the same).

The ls -F hang, and it couldn't be killed from another console, so I decided
to reboot (using the reboot-command). Then I got the following message:

...
Partition check
     hda:  hda1 hda2 hda3
[MS-DOS FS rel. 12, FAT 12, check=n, conv=b, uid=0, gid=0, umask=022, bmap]

sc=34620, ts=-934473037, ls=61937]
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root


The value of ts seems a little suspect to me!!

My questions:

1) What has happened, and much more important:

2) How can I regain access to my system, or at least get access to my file-
   system to backup some important files before I reinstall?

I desperately hope that anybody can help me.

Please (also) answer by e-mail, since I don't get to read this group on a
regularly basis.

Thank you in advance,

Stefan

Maybe this is a stupid question.
When I compile some programs, I see that they are linked with some lib*.a
file. I also see some lib*.sa files in /usr/lib and lib*.so.* in /lib.
Are they libraries ? If they are, what are the differences among *.a, *.sa

Thanx for any help.

It's the problem not with bsdss but with the other single-servers.
bsdss is based on NetBSD, and while it isn't stable, it will be soon.
(There have been volunteers, incidentally, who have time, equipment,
and the necessary licenses.)

Also, in order to participate in the alpha test, when that happens, no
licenses will be necessary.

   The decision to start from scratch meant that there wouldn't be any free OS
   from the FSF for some time. Meanwhile some Hurd enthousiasts got tired of

However: the FSF's goals are not self-aggrandizement.  Linux being out
is a Good Thing for the FSF, not the other way around.  So, whether
there is a free OS from the FSF or not, the FSF's goals are helped by
there being a free OS.  

If there is both the Hurd and something else, that is better than
there being only the Hurd.  The something else was being developed by
other people than us, so it wasn't a good use of FSF resources to do
it ourselves.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

I am not sure what the name of the chipset on our new mb is, but it
might very well be Headland. Anyway, we changed an older 486/33 with
256 cache to one of these (also 486/33) and the new one seems to be
somewhat faster.  There may be something else that differs, too, but
at least it seems that the new system isn't _slower_ than the normal
cache.

I haven't really tested the boards with any benchmark program, but for
example compiling the linux kernel is a bit (like 10-20 %) faster. The
difference may also be due to the fact that the IDE controller is now
a VL bus card, formerly only ISA. Anyway, I think the DCA is rather
well comparable to a 256k cache, not much faster, not much slower.
