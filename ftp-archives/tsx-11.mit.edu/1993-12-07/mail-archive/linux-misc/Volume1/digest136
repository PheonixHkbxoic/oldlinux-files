Subject: Anyone have term working on Ultrix?
Date: 16 Sep 1993 14:08:34 GMT

Hi,

I'm wondering if anyone has term working on an ULTRIX box. I assume
most folks have linux running at home, but I'm hoping there's a fair
number of people who may have their home machines talking to a DEC MIPS
system running ULTRIX. I'm having a difficult time getting term talking
between two ULTRIX machines, and am looking for pointers/advice on what
may be going wrong.

The line (at v32) is 8-bit clean, and term works fine locally (e.g. with
the 'test' program). I've tried a remote connection with and without
modem flow control enabled, and with various terminal server settings on
the remote end that should ensure a transparent connection. 'Linecheck'
runs with 100% valid packets. And yet, the connection fails. The local
log, with a debugging level of 478, looks like this:

Here's what the remote logfile looks like:

(et cetera)

So, the remote side is getting timeouts, but I can't trace it any further. I've tried specifying flow control on either side; no luck. If anyone has gotten
this particular configuration working, would you let me know how you did it?
I know there are lots of variable involved here (does anyone else have to contend with a Cisco server), but I'd appreciate even a couple of informed guesses.

Thanks!

Hmmm...  Good question.  The existing 3c509 driver *might* work, if
it's possible to configure the 3c579 like an ISA adapter.  The
configuration program might not let you do that, though.  And if
that's the case, then you might have to add EISA support.  But that

Subject: What's the diff between SLS, MCC, Slackware and Debian?
Date: Thu, 16 Sep 1993 17:31:49 GMT


With all of the furor over SLS and all recently, I have a question as
to the differences between all of these new "distributions" going
around.

You see, when I first found out about Linux, I first just got copies
of the kernel and all of the utilities and all. I also got the little
readme file that detailed how I was supposed to run fdisk and then
mkfs and all that crap. It never did work for me.

That's why I was pleased when I found SLS, because it installed itself
for me and I was up and running. <shwing!>.

Now that there all of these competing distributions out there now, I
was curious what the difference between all of them are. The last time
I checked the faq, it just mentioned that SLS was a little easier to
install than the others of that time. 

Specifically, what are the perks offered by each of the
distributions?

There are some cases where linux support might be desired.

I'm looking into converting some machines that I have at unmanned remote
sites form running MS-DOS, DESQview and pcAnywhere, to a Unix based system.
Linux seems like a great option. Price is right, modifications can be made to
the system (I'm thinking of drivers being added or functionality that can
be changed because all source is available), etc. But try to tell my
boss that I'm basing my entire system on an unsupported platform. I know
that the support that one can get from comp.os.linux.* is superior to
many commercial developers, but not everyone is in a position to take that
risk.

That's me. There are some minor compatibility problems right now (basically,
once you install the BSD stuff, programs compiled under it won't run on
"normal" Linuxes) and interrupt latency is really horrible for some reason
or another (somebody wanted to enhance the cli()/sti()/restore_flags()
macros to find those problems), card support is still almost nonexistent,
and there's a memory hole somewhere which shows up when using SLIP -- 
but the basic stuff works and is in production use on subnet.sub.net.

Hi y'all,

I am collecting a list of software packages that people have installed
and used successfully under Linux/X. I am interested in hearing about
installations and other tips that Linux-cummunity might want to know.
I hope to consolidate this in the form of a "FAQ" ...

Things in particular:

        Name of software (and what it does).
        Location and what files are needed ....
        Source available?
        How big is the source? The binaries?
        Does it have printed docs?
        How about Online Docs? Man pages?
        How much memory is required for it?
        Hints and tips when re-compiling, installing, configuring or
                using the package
        Idiosyncracies and bugs
        Comments

I have not found a good source to go to when looking for software
packages to perform given tasks ... for example, I started to look 
for a PD Neural Nets package and had to go rummaging through all 
sorts of stuff to find what I needed (after I looked through the
nnet-FAQ). It would be helpful to have a list of packages that
you could flip through to find what you needed relatively quickly 
by doing a name/subject search!

Please mail Comments, suggestions, etc to me at

Yup, I have XS3 0.4.4.  So far the only things that I can't get to work

Subject: SUMMARY: Vesa LocalBus SCSI controllers
Date: Thu, 16 Sep 1993 22:58:27 GMT

G'day,

        Recently I posted a question asking people what Vesa LocalBus
SCSI controllers they were using with Linux. There was not a great deal of
response, but the two that people are using are:

        Ultrastor 34F
        BusLogic  BT445S

In both cases, you need to change the IO port address from 330H to 334H.

Someone made a mention of a new Adaptec 2742, but no dealers in Australia
seemed to know what that was. (But, let's face it, most of 'em didn't know
what VLB SCSI controllers were either).

In the end, I bought the BusLogic, after trying a much cheaper alternative
called the AR-TOP 9200. This is not only badly made and badly documented,
but it appeared to give me constant read errors. The moral: when looking for
performance hardware, don't get the cheapest. The BusLogic controller is
nice. Linux recognises it as an Adaptec, and appears to be fairly quick,
maybe 30-50% faster than my Maxtor IDE. I will test it more thoroughly
with iozone when I have time.

A word of warning. While there are some VLB cards which claim to work
at 50Mhz, it seems the VESA committee will not guarantee VLB above 40MHz.
You can guarantee that a cheapo motherboard like mine wasn't happy with a
486DX50 in it. So I had to `upgrade' to a 486DX2-66. The benchmarks
indicate that this is a slower chip, but at least I get reliable VLB 
throughput. (try buying a 486DX2-66 chip sometime - ouch!)

Also - It appears that SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 disks on the same board with Linux
somehow manage to panick the kernel. Has anyone else had this problem?

In summary, my system has now got the following setup:

        CPU: 486DX2-66
        RAM: 16Mb
        MB : Opti-chipset Vesa LocalBus board (495-SLC) 256k Cache
             ( memory access is not as fast as my `Edge' MB but...)
        Disk : Maxtor 203Mb IDE
             : Quantam 1220S 1.0Gb SCSI-2
               (no, this isn't mine, but I get to use it B^)
        Graphics: VLB 2themax Cirrus clgd5426 board (fast! mail me about it!)
        SW : SLS 1.03 (1.1 Gb) , DOS 5.0 (100 Mb and still too much B^)
 
This appears to be a nice system for Linux. I think it's quite a bit faster
than the SPARC-2's we have at work.
