Allow me to introduce myself as a U*ix novice and and utter Linux newbie.
After having allowed myself to be held captive by the dominant PC marketing
establishment, I have experienced epiphany.  I have seen the Light, and the
Light is Linux.  My very first impression of Linux is that it is very much
geared towards the end-user.  If Linus had truly worried about what's "in
it for them" we would not be here discussing such matters.

Do we want Linux to "take off as a commercial platform"?  Linux strikes
me as being the platform with the "in your face" attitude toward commercial
developers.  I see Linux as the philosophical refuge for those dedicated
to development, not those dedicated to the almighty dollar.  Do you think
Bill Gates would help the Linux cause?

>It appears that there may be many differing views on this and

I'm looking forward to following this thread myself.  There are some
really big philosophical issues to be dealt with here.   Linuxers have
to consider their motives along with their desires.  We have to ask why
Linux is attractive as well as how to make it even more so.

>Nitin Borwankar.

Yours is a very sensible opinion, Nitin (IMHO, of course).  I am a week
old to this concept of a freely available OS and development platform.
I wouldn't like to lose that most important quality.  The very idea that
Linux evolved from a very loosely knit group of developers into a stable
and powerful package was enough to convert me.  Linux is also not such a
clique that somebody can't join in.  It's sort of like a "socialist OS"
if you will.  And by God, it works!

I'd like to see it hit the real mainstream, simply because Linux thrives
on its users; however, most strategies to introduce it to the mainstream
PC population include marketing techniques which could be harmful to the
very spirit of Linux.  You are no doubt correct to assume that Linux would
become very popular very quickly if commercial binaries are welcomed, but
fast growth does not come without growing pains.

Instead, I think it would be best if Linux continues to expand the way
it has so far:  one user at a time.  And I am one of the latest.

A friend of mine are considering the following two laptops primarly for
use with Linux and X-Windows and are interested in some of the problems
people might have had with them.  The two were are consider are:


Epson ActionNotes 4SLC/33 and the IBM ThinkPad 750. 

Do any of you use linux on these? If so, what  problems, if any have you
had??  What should we watch out for??  Will Linux recognize the
ThinkPad's PCMCIA slots? Will the 2.88 MB Floppy Drive on the thinkpad
be usable under Linux??

Thanks for your help and insight..

Subject: Linux on Ambra (IBM) computers ??
Date: 24 Oct 1993 03:52:58 GMT


Has someone attempted Linux on an Ambra (IBM) computer?  The machine I
am most interested in is the D486BL 66 which has a 486 Blue Lightning
CPU (is this an IBM copy of the 486DX2 66 and if so how compatible is
it and why does Ambra also sell machines with the 486DX2 66?).  

Desktop D466 BL
    o   486 Blue Lightning, 66MHz
    o   8Mb RAM
    o   256kb Processor Cache
    o   240Mb hard disk (IDE? SCSI?)
    o   Onboard SCSI
    o   2 VESA LB slots
    o   15" "Flat Square" color monitor
    o   Ethernet 10BaseT
    o   DOS, Windows, mouse

                                        Price:  $1,975

Any information about this machine (such as the onboard SCSI and the
monitor) and Ambra in general would be greatly appreciated.

A Blue Lightning processor does NOT have an FPU unit (coprocessor). It
does, however, have a larger internal cache (16k vs 8k). I'd go with
the DX2 if I were you.

The pas16 driver should be ALPHA .99.13h and newer.  If you don't want an
ALPHA kernel, wait for the .99.14 release.

Subject: xterm so slow .... why ?
Date: 24 Oct 1993 04:30:20 -0500


While I did not have any such problem with SUN3/50, 60
(either mono or color),
My 386pc/25 with 8M running linux (p12)  suffers from xterm slowness.
It scrolls so slow that it really bothers (editing with vi is
a real pain).  My pc has cirrus logic chipset with 1M (ISA).
I configured X11 in 1024x768x256 mode.

Is this because of 386cpu is slow ? (but if so, why even more slower
old SUNs don't have such problem ? ).
I experimented it with Cyrix 486 Rx2-50 chip.
Since the chip runs at 50M inside, at least it helps (editing with
vi is not that painful), but when the whole screen scrolls (ex when
using more), it is still  unacceptable.

Or, is the VGA board not fast enough ?
Will S3 chipset VGA board (such as Farenheit) get rid of this problem ?

I am running only one xterm (rxvt) and fvwm.
Is it because I am using slightly bigger font (should be 16 pt, or 18pt) ?

Please give me some suggestions.
Thanks, in advance.

Hi.  I'm up and running Linux on my 486/DX2 66 and it is really great.  Xfree
works just fine and I'm using it with term/txconn quite well.  However, I'm
running with only 4MB of RAM, with a huge swap space (a 16 MB partition
mounted in fstab).  I'm trying to figure out: is that huge a swap useful?
Or should I be using a smaller swap.

Is there a way to find the optimum swap space for a particular setup?

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

i am also using 4M of ram, and have my swap set to 8M i find that if you ever
get to the stage with 4M that you have used 8M swap, then the machine spends
so much time swapping, that it becomes totally unusable, the drive never stops
working, and it just is not worth the hassle !
