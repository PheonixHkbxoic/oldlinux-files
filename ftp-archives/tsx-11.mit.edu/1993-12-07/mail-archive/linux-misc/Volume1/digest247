Subject: PVM on Linux
Date: 27 Oct 1993 10:56:49 GMT

Hi folks,

are there any succesful installations of pvm on Linux ? I mean not only successfully 
compiled ( it does it out of the box) but connected to other machines on the network.
My problem is, that the pvmd once started prints the message

ioctl: operation not permitted

and then only allows to launch tasks on the same machine where the pvm-daemon was
started. Connecting from other machines is not possible, the other way (from linux
to other machines) too. If i try to add a new machine it gives the following message:

pvm> add machinename
[t80000000] pvmd@machinename: phase1 () execvp failed^J
[t80000000] pl_startup() pvmd@machinename: EOF
0 successful
                HOST    DTID
             machinename can't start pvmd

Any pointers to working solutions are greatly appreciated.

Thank you very much !

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

I think Vince has misunderstood me.

Asking for replies by mail is rude if you're doing it because you
can't be bothered to read the group looking for your answer.

My statement, that you took issue with (well, quoted, anyway):

is perfectly true.  Anyone who does not agree with this needs to read
news.announce.newusers.

However (as I believe I said earlier) asking for replies by mail so
that you can build and post a summary is a good idea, even though it
appears to be out of fashion in the generally netiquetteless
comp.os.linux hierarchy.

Oh, and I wouldn't suggest that my time was more valuable than Vince's
(or indeed than that of anyone involved with the Linux community, as
developer or user).  I just don't think that the average questioner's
time is worth 10 or 100 times the average reader's.

Which FAQ is this ?  The new FAQ (for the last three months or so) has
not advocated SLS in the slightest.

If you (anyone!) have a copy of the old FAQ (the 5/6-parter) please
get rid of it - it is out of date.

However the Installation HOWTO does point you towards SLS.  IMO this
is very damaging and should be corrected immediately.  Matt ?

I remember seeing a posting on c.o.l.a. around a week ago, from Peter,
about the availability of SLS 1.04 CD-ROM.  However, I still haven't seen
any updates to the SLS distribution on tsx-11 as of 10/26;  all files
still dated prior to 09/15 in the /pub/linux/packages/SLS directory when
doing a 'ls -l'.

Has SLS distributions via tsx-11 (including all mirror sites) therefore
come to a standstill?

Boy that Alan guy is pretty slow, isn't he?  It took him days and days before
he got around to doing anything with the device-level code that I added.  I

Of course this only means more work for me.  Now I'll have to put in

Unless PLIP is enabled, and it almost certainly isn't, it won't affect other
parts of your system.  PLIP is reporting the interrupt line that it _would_ use
if started, not that it _is_ using the interrupt line.

You bus mouse problems are likely elsewhere, probably that the bus mouse
driver is always trying to use IRQ5 rather than doing an autoIRQ for the
correct interrupt line.  I've run into this myself when installing a system
for someone, and it was difficult to track down.

I would write the bus-mouse autoIRQ code myself, if I had one to test with.
It is as simple as adding an 'int irq;' field to <linux/busmouse.h>,
and some code like the following to drivers/char/*mouse.c:mouse_init()

...
        autoirq_setup(1);
        MS_MSE_INT_ON();        /* Trigger an interrupt by twinkling */
        MS_MSE_INT_OFF();       /* the jumpered interrupt line.  */
        mouse.irq = autoirq_report(0);

        if (mouse.irq == 0) {
                mouse.present = 0;
        else {
                printk("Microsoft BusMouse detected at %#x on IRQ %d.\n",
                        MS_MSE_DATA_PORT, mouse.irq);
                snarf_region(MS_MSE_DATA_PORT, 4);
        }
        return kmem_start;
}

Now, this is something that I have jsut started to think about myself.

I have just added a second hard-drive to one of my systems that is 1:1
interleave, and the old drive is 3:1 interleave, so I stuck a 4M swapfile
onto it and made sure that that partition was swapon'd first.  Kernel
compiles (wonderful benchmark eh?) now are noticeably faster, going from
approx 1 and a half hours to approx 1 hour and 15 mins (i know, its
not much),....

But, I was thinking to myself, swapping should be able to take advantage
of multi-tasking, and if I added a 3rd drive, and stuck a swapfile on 
that, then I should get a speed up even if the new drive was just as slow
as any existing ones..

All that a simple implementation would need would be to jump to the next
swapfile when the kernel starts to search for a free swap page.  I think
that I will have to look further into this..

Does anyone have any ideas of what a real mothod of swapfile load balancing
should look like??

Hi,

I've been doing some control simulations on my Linux box and it is
time to consider connecting with the outside world.  As this will be a
feasibility study, I'm placing a high premium on recreating (or
preserving) my analysis environment and much less emphasis on total
system speed.

I'd like to hear about examples of ADC/DAC boards
operating under Linux and additionally any thoughts on how 
a DSP card might be brought into the picture.
Oh, I'm prgoramming in C.

I suppose I should have looked at the source for the kernel to be sure of
how BogoMips are calculated, i.e. external interrupts or what, but I will
just speculate away.  Assuming a loop which simply increments a counter
is running until it is stopped by a real-time syncronized interrupt, then
a variation in either the realtime clock or the clock crystal (the one
that make it a 40MHz board) would skew these values.  So consider that
the rule for manufacturing quality distribution applies to both the real
time clock chip, the crystal, and everything else too!

On my cheap 386DX-33 the BogoMips varies up to .07 BogoMips between boots,
and my CMOS clock loses tens of minutes in less than a month.

I can't see worrying about some 10% difference, but:

486DX-33 --->  4.66 BogoMips 

It is only 1.45 BogoMips with internal and external (256k) cache off.
AMI setup says the speed is "high" and turbo button is disabled (good
since I don't have one).  I do see a 66MHz crystal on the motherboard,
so I'd guess it's running the CPU at 33.
If this is a true indication of performance I guess I should have gone
for the 386-40 instead! 

This is Slackware, the recent one with a 3 at the end of the version
number.  I should probably get something like Norton and find out what
is going on (or what isn't).

No, my own system is SLS because at the time I installed Linux SLS was the
only reasonably complete distribution available.  I added ncurses, and so did
SLS later; but SLS didn't and doesn't have it fully installed.  I (perhaps
stupidly) assumed SLS had installed it correctly, so things broke for others.

I stopped assuming SLS was correct some time ago, and now have warnings in my
most recent (2 months ago) distribution saying that SLS needs some extra work
before it will use the package.  I may just leave that in instead of adding
the files to fix SLS.

I couldn't agree more. Surely with the FAQ still pointing to SLS, SLS
will continue to be the distribution of choice for linux newcomers. I
have used SLS for over a year and was suprised to see the hard
critisism of it by important linux developers. However, since I am
getting ready to do a scratch install, I think I'll try Slackware :-)
