But I don't like the judgement about distributions.
A *recommendation* of a *consortium* sounds so *serious*, that it's
too much for me to accept in combination with free software.

Yes, mainly to the unconnected, among them are newsbies and not newbies.
If a dealer doesn't point out that it's alpha stuff, then I would give the
package back, when it does not run !

So, what's the problem ... Nowadays there are Installation guides around
of good quality and also system administration books.

Here in Germany there you can order a so called LST distribution on 
disks or tape that comes with nearly everything (based on slackware).
AND: optional with lot's of Doku. Averything for about DM 280.-

No need for a consortium. Doku and good packages are enough around.

You have a couple of misconceptions:
   *   You have to have less than 12MB of ram to use the aparture.
   *   You have to remove/desable com4.
   *   You can't fix it with hardware.
   *   The memory aparture is only a speedup - it is not required.

I have 16MB ram. I have to disable the aparture. It works fine. I have 3
16550 com ports and a couple A-B switches to get me connected to what I
want. You lose some speed without the aparture, but I live with it.

I am posting this from a 386-40 with 16MB ram, ATi GUltraPro 2MB ISA in X

Later

No kidding? I have pl13, and that happens in different circumstances. When I am

freezes; I go into another virtual console and login, but the password prompt
does not appear until I press ^C on the compiler. Note that this only happens
on newer kernels; pl7A doesn't do it (and it is smaller); perhaps this is a
side-effect of Linux now being written in C++.....

This is because the controllers use a different number of sectors per
track; 32 in the case of the 1542, and usually something different in
the case of the ST01, but this is configurable. Accessing the setup
menu of the ST01 ROM, the configuration can be changed.

From a console:

Alt-F7  --> Switches to  console 7 (normally where X starts...)

From the root X window:

Ctrl-Alt-F1  --> Switches to console 1

The reason for the difference in key strokes, is because Alt-F1 might be
used by your session manager.

I don't know if this works with xdm, but following works with startx:

Replace:
xinit $clientargs -- $serverargs

with:
if [ -f /tmp/.X0-lock ] ; then
  if [ -f /tmp/.X1-lock ] ; then
    echo "Sorry both servers are running."
    echo "If one of them is dead, then remove"
    echo " /tmp/.X0-lock -or- /tmp/.X1-lock "
  else
    xinit $clientargs -- $serverargs :1
  fi
else
  xinit $clientargs -- $serverargs :0
fi

You now when you type startx, it will start either DISPLAY :0 or DISPLAY :1
on either console 7 or console 8.  I believe you start even more X sessions
if you are willing to modify your inittab to start  fewer text consoles.

I have. I put rup.tar.gz up for anonymous ftp on rflab.ee.ubc.ca:/pub/rup.tar.gz.

It includes a binary and a manual page. I seem to have misplaced the source
code but it wasnt hard to compile; I got the source from the Net/FreeBSD
distribution.

The binary is statically linked due to an annoying RPC bug
(pmap_rmt.c) (well, not really a bug, it was just compiled with the
wrong #defines) in the Linux libc. 

Anyway, try it and hopefully it will work for you. rflab.ee.ubc.ca is a Linux
machine connected to a net with a bunch of Suns on it, and rup works fine for
me. (if it doesnt work, check your routing; try running as root too)

Yes, and no.  Source code is very good documentation to programmers
only.  When I develop an application, and I want to be sure, that
a system call does in detail - no problem, locate the sys_whatever
function in the kernel, and examine it.

But did you ever try to read the X sources to find out, how the X
toolkit is working?  Certainly not, better read the "X Toolkit
Intrinsics" and "Athena Widget Set" manuals from MIT.  I had to
get the original X11R5 distribution for them.

And what, if I was an end user, and I wanted to find out, which key
I must press to delete a line in vi?

Yes, vi/elvis is documented very well.  But it is *roff source, and
not included in most distributions of Linux.

In other words: collecting all the available documentation in all
usable formats (Ascii, Postscript, maybe dvi) is something, which
should be done soon.
