I was under the impression that while the `microkernel' itself is quite 
small, the subsystems loaded on top of it have to run in supervisor mode.
Therefore the thing that MS calls the microkernel is just a little bit of
the kernel rather than true microkernel.

I think this is discussed somewhere in Septembers PC Plus in the UK.

To be fair most of the 'bloat' in Linux is removable. With no networking,
no silly extra file systems, no SCSI and no SYS5 IPC Linux is still pretty
close to the size it started as (apart from the VFS).

I see no point in arguing about kernel size, especially when you don't
define at all what "kernel" is. As has been pointed out, the Linux
image as booted contains more than just a kernel. It's a structured
monolith vs. microkernel concept, about as useful to compare as code
sizes for a Cray vs. 386.

You seem to confuse "application" and "GUI". There are text mode
applications too, in large numbers.

I don't need Winword. I don't need Procomm. I *do* have, however, TeX
(a bit more than word processing), ghostscript, sc (spreadsheet),
kermit (comms), term (comms), the whole uucp/mail/news stuff, the
finest C compiler and associated tools you can get (e.g. rcs), which
does count as an appliaction since I do software development. And more
stuff I didn't bother to install in the first place.

It is not correct as of the *current* state of Linux (e.g. file system
linitations) and it is not complete as it leaves out deliverately some
arguments in favor of Linux (like source code availability, and that
does count.)

My xdrop application (version 2) is currently in beta testing.  You can
drag files and text onto it and set it up to run whatever you like with
them.  I tend to use it for manipulating text mostly...X is flexible
like that.

 I believe this problem is caused by both sides thinking they are 'remote'.
A simple solution is to run the remote term with the -r flag (term -r) and the
local with -vdevice (-v/dev/modem). This should fix it. Hope it helps.

Jeez, wake up!

There is no point in comparing Windows NT to Linux.  They are in totally
separate ballparks, practically two different universes.  You might as well be
comparing IBM OS/360 and ITS.  NT is a commercially backed project with many
many millions in development, marketing, testing, documentation, and support. 
It has industry support for every major software vendor.  Linux is a hacker's
operating system.  It has virtually no marketing, testing, or documentation. 
The likelihood of the big-name commercial vendors supporting their products it
is virtually zero.

The technical details of filename limits, memory usage, etc., are just
irrelevant.  The fundamental differences between NT and Linux far outweight
any just trivial technicalities.

I think Microsoft is just as scummy and NT just as much a scam as the next
rational person, but I do not for an instant think Linux will ever make a dent
in it.  OS/2 might, and I sure hope it does, but I also don't think Linux will
ever make a dent in OS/2.  Anyone who thinks it will is living in a dream
world.

In short, this is a stupid thread.

And he has the gaw to compare a COMMERCIAL "OS" to Linux.  Why not compare

system for several MONTHS with NO DOWNTIME and NO PROBLEMS and NO RESETS.
How about running for 4 years with no crashes. 
Oh, sorry, I forgot NT can;t support multiple users- it's just a glorified

As it is in many Unixes.  Microsoft didn't invent ANYTHING new or different.
OS-9 has had on the fly loadable device drivers long before there ever
WAS such a thing as MS-"Windows" 1.0.

>>You know what your problem is? You stare at your os too much! I mean,
>>let's face it, you have *NO* applcations, 

Again- do you want to compare to another ****COMMERCIAL OS**** such as
SCO??????????????????   There are more SCO applications then you could
ever imagine.  And once Linux and SCO support WABI, we will be able to run
most everything NT can run.  And when Linix has COFF, it will be able to
run everything SCO can too.  Throw MS-"DOS" emulation in (which COMES with
SCO ODT *AND* LINUX) and run most everything there too.  Eat that.

OS/2 is bigger, slower, and has *less* applications available.  Better?  NO.

NO.

Apart from the obvious deficiencies of Word, WP, Lotus and Procomm...
Yes, word processors *do* exist (Word Perfect, for one), DTP packages
*do* exist (Frame Maker...)...  As to spreadsheets, I don't have an
example, but I'm sure they're around.  Procomm?  Who needs it?  Telnet
is *standard*!  If you want file transfers, use FTP, or sz/rz.  Xtalk?
What about Telnet?  It's been around a lot longer...  How about remsh?

using it on yours...

        Try using something larger than 512 byte blocks.  Your performance will
increase significantly if you were to do this.  Try using something in the
4096-8192 byte range.  As I recall, the performance starts to level out
somewhere in this area.

        No there is no kernel bug, and no debugging is required.  All that is

First of all, the checklist that started this mess was created
by someone with an obvious NT bias, contained incorrect and 
out-of-date information, and was generally snotty.  Why are you
so bitter?  Now that your "great" OS is finally here, why do you
even care?

The only way NT could ever "bury" Linux is if they gave it away
free, brought the disks to your house, provided source and manuals,
and gave you the extra hardware you need to run it.

Kernel size has become the megaHertz of the 90's.  To compare
kernel size, the two kernels must have similar function.  Also,
I have had more problems with the DOS FAT than with ext2fs,
because I am trusted by the designers to operate it correctly,
and not treated like a child who is too stupid to understand 
it's inner workings.

Linux was written by programmers, for programmers.  Do we need 
Winword?  NO.  Do we need Word Perfect?  NO.  Can we run them 
on our DOS partition or in DOSEMU if we want?  YES!!  It is not
a tool for end-users, it is meant to offer a comparable platform
for Unix developers to work on at home without breaking their
credit ratings.

As for you not minding the os, you seem to care quite a bit if
it isn't NT.  Your statement about burying Linux indicates this.
Linux and NT are not in the same market.  It's like a car dealer
worrying about the bike shop down the street.

If you think the checklist is correct, you know nothing about
