It sounds like you're claiming Hurd is A Good Thing(tm) because it's
architecturally different from traditional Unix?  VMS is different
from traditional Unix, but that doesn't make it something I would want
to run on a computer that I had to use.

I assume that the architectural differences between Hurd and Unix
provide some benifits to the user, or why bother?

Additional memory should not affect the performance of the card.
What is important is the speed of the memory, and the type of memory.
Faster memory will speed things up, and VRAM boards will be faster 
than DRAM boards.

The 45ns DRAM cards just can't handle running at 110Mhz at 256 colors.
At higher than 80Mhz clock rate, there is not enough memory bandwidth
to keep the screen refreshed and also provide memory
access to the graphics engine at the same time.
The higher resolutions can be used without problems by running interlaced.

This is the reason that higher-end cards use dual-ported VRAM instead of DRAM.
The VRAM allows access by both screen refresh and graphics engine at once.

Not Larn, but Ularn a.k.a. Ultra Larn (IMHO it's better). I ported

_after_ I got pl13 installed completely.

928 uses VRAM, 801/805 uses DRAM.  If you use resolutions less than 1024x768
then go with DRAM.  Otherwise, get a VRAM based board (i.e. a 928).  The
only 801/805 boards that give competetive performance at 1024x768 and above
are boards with 45ns DRAMs (Actix for one; I don't know if there are others).
VRAM doesn't suffer the memory-access degradation due to increasing dot-
clocks that DRAM does.

Subject: Parity Vs Non-Parity Memory
Date: Fri, 5 Nov 1993 00:59:22 GMT

I have two questions for you Linuxers out there:

1) Does using non-parity memory in any way compromise the
   stability of a Linux system?  Do most users out there
   have parity memory?

   I'm trying to convince Gateway 2000 that I need parity
   memory for the system, since good memory is supposedly (?)
   more of a necessity for a multitasking environment.  I
   thought I had heard something along those lines reading
   the c.o.l group a few months ago.

2) Will linux work with a PCI bus system?  And specifically,
   are special video drivers needed to support PCI cards
   (eg ATI XLR/PCI 2MB) as opposed to the similiar batch
   of ISA/EISA/VLB group?


I currently have a P5-60 on order from Gateway, but I'd like
to be certain that I can use it part of the time with Linux.
As the ship date has come closer, I've gotten a bit nervous
about sitting on "the bleeding edge".

Thanks,

-=- Dan

Then the 256 color server should be 8 times as slow?  
Many VGA cards have their RAM setup as 4 banks, so each bitplane can 
be accessed in parallel.  In fact, these boards are typically 
designed for 4-plane color, so they should be able to perform well at 16-color.
I guess the server code isn't written to use the plane-mode features of VGA
very well.  I'm not complaining, nor should anyone else!

It is easy to imagine after switching from running the slow 16 color server!

It works for me (I got it to work with UUPC which is a DOS version of
uucp). I did not use getty_ps that came with SLS (don't trust anything
that comes with SLS any more - all the UUCP file permissions were
wrong). Instead I got getty_ps package from sunsite and compiled it myself.
At this point I can remotely login using uugetty, copy files (uucp)
to and from my remote Linux box, or send mail to users on my Linux box
(all through uugetty from getty_ps package). When you are setting up
uucp Systems and Permissions files just make sure you follow
O'Reilly's "Managing UUCP" (nutshell series) and you won't have any
problems.

You were sounding so right, but what the hell is this last comment!!!
I take great insult! Don't even THINK of equating Lisp Machines with GNU-Hurd. 
First off, Lisp Machines are HARDWARE, GNU-Hurd is software.
Second, Xerox Lisp Machines were around in the 1970's -- 
 there is NOTHING VAPOROUS about Lisp Machines.
DOS is 1960's technology, Unix is 1970's technology,
Lisp Machines are 1980's technology.
Does anyone have a clue as to what 1990's technology is?

Right on target here Dan --- I find BYTE is a good source for more broader
topics than PC Mag.  The net is good for system-specific info, since you
probably won't see an article on XFree2.0 -- though i have noticed that
SunWorld has little write-ups on new software released on FTP sites now.
Maybe DWex could submit an article to BYTE -- you listening david?
