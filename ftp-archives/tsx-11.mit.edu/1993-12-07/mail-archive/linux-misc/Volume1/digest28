Sounds like someone is a little sore that their OS just can't seem to
reach a final shipping date.

True ( I guess ) - but what does the kernel do, sits there and waits for
you to give it all of NT's subsystems, which ain't that small.  Plus, we
can make whatever changes we want to our kernel to customize it, fix it
or whatever - as for NT, well, we'll wait for the next release and pray
it actually comes.

Hmm...I have use all but xiafs.  I use ext2fs, and before that extfs.  How
many errors have I had? How many corruptions?  When I add them all together
I come up with 0!!!  I can use the above mentioned filesystems, msdos, and

When was the last time I recompiled the whole kernel?  I dunno.  I just
added a sound patch yesterday to play digitized sound via the PC speaker
(can NT do that?) and I recomiled 4 files and relinked, and it worked
perfect (quietly, but perfect.)  Hey, at least I can compile my kernel :)

You're right, we have no applications - in a shrink-wrapped overpriced box.
(Actually, there are about 3 companies that now sell Linux apps.)
But we do have the whole internet to pick our software from.  If I have
no applications, I wonder what the hell is taking up 73% of my 110 meg
partition.  Only 6 megs of it is guitar tab.

And they are all pretty much intercompatiable.  IE, I can easily link my

Lets see, there is Xdm, which does okay, or  - wait - I run xmfm, the
Motif File Manager.  As for drag and drop.  olwm supports it, Motif
supports it.  Hell, I can even drag and drop between text applications
on different virtual consoles.  Can you do that?  Not without the windows
scratchpad thing.

I'll agree on that, but why move my mouse to a file, click, click on

It's not 8000 miles.  I was born in Taiwan, and that's only 6000 miles
from Minnesota.  Actually little less than 6000 miles.

Australia shouldn't be 8000.  Besides, going around the globe is around
12000, so half of the globe is 6000.  Why would you go the other way which
is 8000 miles instead of 4000 miles??

however, i know that 12000 is halfway around the world
(remember, earth revolves @ ~1000 m/h, and that there are 24 hrs. to the day,
with a day being defined as one revolution... pretty simple math...:)

Nothing says the scripts are GPL'd. Nor does he have to make them GPL 
material. Search the GPL for 'mere aggregation'. There are Peters scripts
unless he states otherwise which he doesn't. He just says distribute freely
and then contradicts his statement elsewhere.

Indeed I can find no such condition in the older material I checked. Maybe
we should start releasing useful tools that you cannot put in a distribution 
called SLS. Had he always said so I'd have no argument about the technicality
of SLS being SLS only. Morally its a different story.

The only person who could be held to be taking credit for thr work of others
is Peter. A lot of people put all the Linux stuff together, helped debug SLS
and support it on the net. Now he has competition he immediately goes off
and starts causing hassle. Linux is meant to be shared. The whole GPL is
meant to be about not rewriting and reinventing, yet the man shipping tons
of GPL stuff is saying rewrite or else.
I've never been impressed with the lack of source code supplied with SLS,
maybe it is about time someone in the FSF sat on SLS.

But what is it (the microkernel itself, the 50K one you're so proud of)
capable of doing?  Remember, to keep it that size you have to make sure it
doesn't load any of the installable drivers/modules --- otherwise it's not a
fair comparison, because the actual working size of the kernel will be the
size of the microkernel plus the automatically-loaded drivers.

Which is why we're responding to you:  you appear not to have the faintest
clue even about NT.  If you're the best NT can do for advocacy, it's dead
already (but luckily for NT, Gates is only unethical, not stupid).

I think linux (or at least SLS at level 1.03) supports only blocks
of 1024 bytes. Is there a patch already available?

Or did you mean one should write/read in larger chunks? I think
over 1024 bytes sizes make a very small difference even that way..

Right, (actually I would recommend to put it in /tmp in this case) but
it should be recommended to NOT run term as root. Reason? This would
give the root on the school machine root on your home box as well
(actually anybody who can access the socket).

Or have I missed something important here? Perhaps an option to term
to deny trsh connections would be nice (you still can get in via trsh
and telnet, but then you have to provide the proper password.)

Subject: Re: NT versus Linux
Crossposted-To: comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy
Date: 20 Aug 93 17:50:34 GMT

A few neutral observations in this subject:

Observation #1:
Making fun and degrading remarks about Windows users is fashionable in
the linux groups. Linux users have the moronic idea that they must be
somehow mentally and morally superior to the rest of the world. Snide
remarks about how stupid and gullible Winodws users are are all but
uncommon in the linux groups.

Observation #2:
The above is mainly due to the strong SHEEP MENTALITY running in the
linux community. Few if any linux users have their own mind, After
all, why bother? It's easier to just echo what a master sheep has
said. This is obvious in their "rebuttals" to the check list that was
posted here. Each one just echoes the other -- all of them asserted
that linux has QIC-80 support, just because the first one said so,
even though linux HAS NO QIC-80 SUPPORT, nor is likely to have it any
time soon.

But that's not all, there is also the LYNCH MOB MENTALITY. After
hearing about how dum and gullible we are for two years, as soon as an
objective comparison that shows that linux is not the ultimate os is
posted here, the linux lynch mob mentality takes over, and we're
burried by an article after another of vulgar flames. Even though the
comparison was not posted to their group.

Of course, there is also the FANATIC MENTALITY, but that one is
obvious.

Observation #3:
For a long time they kidded us about how NT is vaporware. The general
consensus among them is that NT will never see the light of day, and
our replies that it is coming out "soon" were laughed at. But look at
what they are saying right now: Loadable device drivers... "soon",
Drag and drop... "R6 is out any day now", Running ODS apps...
"emulator is coming along nicely", Running Winodws apps... "WABI is
almost here", ..etc. ..etc. What a joke!

Observation #4:
Linux is inferior to DOS! How's that? Well, DOS has loadable device
drivers, linux doesn't. Your printer and modem use the same IRQ? No
problem in Windows, just don't use them at the same time. In linux,
you have to use the modem a little, stop, recompile the kernel with
the printer enabled and the modem disabled, use the printer a little,
stop, recompile, use the modem, stop, ...etc. Two drivers that use the
same IRQ cannot live in the same kernel, even if none of them is used!

Observation #5:
Not only that linux doesn't support drag an drop, its users have no
concept of what drag and drop is! Most of them think it's just cut and
paste, as can be seen clearly in the "rebuttals".  The only way to get
drag and drop in linux is to pay $299 (NT is less expensive, how
ironic) to buy Motif, and virtually no Motif application makes use of
it anyway, and you cannot drag and drop between Motif and Xaw
applications.

Observation #6:
Linux users have no idea what multimedia support is.  Multimedia
support is NOT that the os is able to talk to a sound card!  DOS can
do that. It is that the os has inherent layering facilities to do
multimedia. To run a full motion picture clip or play a MIDI song via
the sequencer in Windows, you just call a single API function (e.g.
MciSendCommand).

Observation #7:
QIC-80 support is not in linux, nor is it ever likey to be. The
general consensus among linux developers is that QIC-80 is simply
unsuitable to multitasking environments, a claim that's obviously
disproved by NT's support for QIC-80.

Observation #8:
Q: What does linux do when it runs low on memmory? A: IT FALTERS! The
only os I have seen that locks up when it runs low in memory. Every
linux user must constantly watch for memory useage, if linux needs a
few more kilobytes than are available, it doesn't complain, it just
crawls to a halt before dying a miserable death, taking down the whole
system with it.

Need I say more? There is still lots to talk about: the flaky file
system, the feeble networking, ..etc. ..etc.

Linux users, get a clue! Your os is shit. And remember, we didn't
start this.

I can't believe I just read that - this from an NT supporter? The entire damn
world has been hearing for months about 'how great your pitiful os is' when it
hadn't even bloody been released yet!

 Now our great os is here and we're proud of it. Not only

Not unless you buy me 1) another 8 MB 2) a CDROM drive 3) a much much bigger
hard drive it won't.

NT's _microkernel_ is less than 1/5 the size perhaps? I don't know about this,
but I find that very hard to believe. If you installed the bare minumum to
allow you to log in from a remote console how much RAM would you have used
under NT?

 Or that your file system
>falters more often than it works? (how many times a day does the extfs
>get corrupted?)

Not once since I have been running Linux (before easter). Linux might have it's
stability problems but filesystem reliability is certainly not one of them.

 For crying out loud, you even have to recompile the
>whole os in order to add the littlest of drivers!

I'd like to see you recompile yours :) And you don't have to recompile the
whole OS you only have to recompile the kernel, which is no great hassle even
on my 386-16 with 5 megs.  

>don't even have a file manager for pete's sake!

xfilemanager? xdtm? No doubt there are not a few non-X solutions as well.

>have Winword? Word perfect? Lotus 123? *Any* spreadsheet? Procomm?

WP and 123 will come with COFF compatability. What about sc? xspread? And as
for comms packages, even plain old rlogin running in an xterm window beats
Procomm. Then ther's seyon, term, txconn... And I'd like to see your OS put
apps up on a display the other side of the world, like X11 can.

>Xtalk? Go figure. And on top of that we now have the superior os!

What does Xtalk do?

>As far as I can tell, the chekclist is correct. It wasn't even posted

I think it has been adequately shown elsewhere in this thread that most of that
list was bollocks as far as the Linux info on it was concerned. 

>to your group for crying out loud! Whay are so offended? so bitter? so

So if it's such a toy OS and not worth bothering with, why make the comparison
in the first place? It might not have been posted in this group possibly
because the poster knew what the reaction would be...

Oh god, not this again.

If you want to cripple OS/2 to bring it down to linux's level, do the
following:

Change the RUNWORKPLACE line in the config.sys to read "cmd.exe". This will
start your system up in an OS/2 window instead of in the Workplace Shell.

Why do you have to do this? Linux has no real interface available. X-windows
plus a window manager is not even as functional as OS/2's old desktop manager
interface.

Compare an OS/2 system like this to a standalone linux box running X, and the
OS/2 system will blow it away. Period. I speak from experience.

Wrt applications: Even the "crippled" OS/2 system above can run nearly all DOS
and Windows apps, far better than linux's pathetic DOS emulation can handle.
And, of course, there are native OS/2 applications that linux can't run. And,
of course, I've never seen a polished GUI UNIX app. *Ever*. (Unless you call
NeXTStep UNIX).

Wrong. OS/2 is already beating all the brands of UNIX put together (in sales)
after a year, and we surely don't have 50% of the market. (source: some PC
trade rag, I can't remember which one offhand)

Now if you were to say "about half the computing world that posts and reads
news on the Internet uses UNIX", well, you'd still be wrong, but you'd be a
little bit closer.

Post-flame-disclaimer: I think linux is a great hobbyist OS for those that
want to study UNIX. I don't think, however, that users should be misled into
thinking that it is a svelte super-powerful OS with reams of usable
applications.
