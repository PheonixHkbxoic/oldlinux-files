The only low cost CDROM I know that lets you install a minimum system and use
the rest directly from the CDROM is the new Trans-Ameritech product.

Subject: IOMEGA 150Mb Removable Disk Drive Questions
Date: 22 Sep 93 17:30:30 GMT

I'm interested in getting one of the newly-reduced SCSI based
IOMEGA 150 Mb internal removable disk-drives. Does anyone
actually have one of these running under Linux? If so, could
you tell if
        1) You can use ext2fs on it
        2) You can switch drives without rebooting
My guess is `yes' to both of these, but under OS/2 you can
only either treat the disk as a big floppy (fat only) or treat the
disk as fixed, which requires rebooting to switch disks.

I plan to use this as an extensible hard-disk/backup unit, and 
need both of the above to accomplish this.

Thanks,
        Steve

Let me make a suggestion for buying and selling Linux T-shirts:
Buy them directly from a real T-shirt company.
One of my cousins has a T-shirt shop on the beach in Southern California.
T-shirts and silk-screening stuff is his only business.  So he can both
take credit cards, ship anywhere, and as a direct source,
he takes responsibility for any problems.  

I'm sure he would be very happy to sell Linux T-Shirts (or hats, beach towels, ...)
if he got enough orders to justify creating the silk-screens.  

Send me mail if you would like a Linux T-shirt.
If there is enough interest,  I will simply post the phone number
of his shop, and you can call him and order a shirt from to him directly.

I recall there was much debate on a design/logo.
Was there any consensys reached?

I use an old SLS with 99pl4 at home and the binaries DO NOT work as expected

Subject: More SLS 1.03 problems. Kernel make breaks.
Date: Wed, 22 Sep 1993 21:54:28 GMT

I have just installed SLS 1.03 retrieved from tsx-11.mit.edu on the
afternoon of Sept 17.

I had the same "noise" problems others have noted (e.g. TeX install
complaining because some files are directories or some such...)
however, the real problem comes when I try to rebuild the kernel.

I have a 3com ethernet controller connected to a thickwire network. I
am used to the fact that the ec503 driver is built for the thinwire
conenctor, and needs the EL2_AUI symbol turned on. (That's ok, most
Linux users probably want the thin instead of the thick wire, and I
have no problem rebuilding kernels... until today, that is...)

make config -> with "y" to most questions...
make dep
make zImage

and when it gets to tty_io.c

tty_io.c: In function `int tty_select (struct msdos_inode_info::inode*, struct ifs_file_info::file*, int, struct select_table_struct*)':
tty_io.c:1420: Internal Compiler Error.
tty_io.c:1420: Please submit a full bug report to `bug-g++@prep.ai.mit.edu'.

This was a "clean" build of SLS onto new partitions, not an upgrade of
an earlier version.

This is the first SLS release where I haven't been able to do at least
a kernel rebuild. I have tried to just use gcc rather than the c++ mode, but
that causes many more problems. I have tried a few different 'make config'
runs trying small vs large kernels, (though tty_io.c shouldn't be affected
by much that can be done with make config) and am out of ideas.

I can still get stuff from the net via a Sun (though the Sun's floppy is SOOO
slow...) if needed.

Any suggestions??

And I have just found another interesting wrinkle, doing another make zImage
doesn't change the problem, but REBOOTING does. It compiles tty_io.c
with no problem and proceeds for a few dozen more files until it
breaks again in the same way. I am now on my third reboot and the kernel
is getting compiled slowly...

What sort of memory does gcc have between runs that is cleared by a reboot???

This is a 486/33 with 16 MB.

Subject: Net-2 Patches are GREAT
Date: 22 Sep 1993 22:20:48 GMT

Hello Fellow net-users,

I would just like to remark that the net-2 patches found on sunsite under
/pub/Linux/system/Network/net2-debugged-tcp.tar.z really work wonders for
me.  My system (pl 12, 13 alpha, and 13) really wasn't stable at all under
any kind of net load, but the new patches really help my system stay up
under normal usage.  Take a look:

[1] % uptime
  6:14pm  up 17:47,  2 users,  load average: 0.01, 0.06, 0.02

and I've been hitting the net fairly hard trying to crash the machine
(it didn't crash 17:47 ago either, just rebooted after applying patches).
This would have been unthinkable without these patches--a simple repition
of "tcpspray" commands would eventually bring it down (after approx.
100 or so such commands in a row).

Oh, my hardware: 386-40, 20 meg ram (but with kernel 16 meg limit due to
the ethernet card drivers), Boca AT1500 compatible card, nothing else
special.

Thank you, Swansea University, for making my net stable!

By the way, can anybody direct me to the newest telnetd and rlogind?  I
realize that I should get them for pl 13, but I have been unable to find
any kind of new sources for them....

Subject: SCSI Information
Date: Wed, 22 Sep 1993 22:19:02 GMT

A week or so ago, I posted a message to here (and a few other forums)
asking about the differences between SCSI, SCSI-II, Fast SCSI, etc.
I received a email note asking if I would post what I found out..

Here's what I've pieced together, and if I'm wrong, please post and 
let me know.

SCSI-I was the first SCSI standard, limits transfer rates to about 1.5MB/Sec
SCSI-II is now the most common, you probably can't even buy at SCSI-I
  hard drive these days.  Transfer rates increased to about 5MB/Sec.
Fast SCSI-II is the newest implementation of the SCSI standards, it 
  requires a higher-than-normal quality SCSI cable and will supposedly 
  read 10MB/Sec transfers or better.  A downside is that since the cable
  is so important, you are possibly limited to the number of devices you
  can chain on the same cable.
There is also a standard called "Wide" SCSI-II but as far as I know, 
there arent' any manufacturers of this standard yet.  Also, apparently
"Fast" and "Wide" can be combined so there will be a "Fast Wide SCSI-II"
supposedly in the future.  

I was primarily interested in Adaptec's 1542C or 1742 sseries of controllers
but there are different models.  Apparently, all of the SCSI standards are
backwards compatible.  So a "Fast SCSI-II" controller can also handle a
"SCSI-II" or a "SCSI-I" device.  

I ended up purchasing the adaptech 1542C for use with an ISA 486-DX50.
I made my choice not so much for performance but for the fact that I've was
offered 2 free SCSI-II Hdard drives and a Viper 150 SCSI Tape drive.

According to responses I got, if you're looking for the absolute fastest
performance, Local Bus with a cacheing Loccal bus controller blows everything
else out of the water.  A Local Bus IDE will outperform an EISA SCSI. 
There is some dissention as to whether a VLB IDE is better than a VLB SCSI
but pretty much everyone agreed that VLB is the way to go for performance.
(Unfortunately, my funds are limited :-)

Anyway, that is pretty much what I found out.

Feel free to correct or add to this information.  I'm always curious.

Yea, Im writing this on linux, of course, on an AMD386. On the 286
beside me lies an old 3c501-card, connected via pctcp to this 386.

I have a bunch of those 501s, and I would like someone who uses those
with linux to contact me, and tell, how to do it. On this 386 is a
NE2000 clone, only temporarily borrowed from a friend.

I know I know, I am masochistic type, but my braindamage is much worse
than that of those 501's... :-)

The cards _are_ slow, but I dont care, as long as I can use them.

PS. Anyone wanna buy a cheap ethernet card ? :-)

So, please, contact!

[ someone wanted interleaf and / or frame ports ]

By the way, I did ask interleaf about a Linux port. They
were interested in acquiring a copy of Linux but not in porting Interleaf
to it. The feeling was the return on their investment would
not be worth the effort, and they are having enough trouble keeping
up with the platforms they do support. I would think it would
be easier than a DOS port (which exists already) since the X
framework, unix filesystem, etc. are already there, but I can't
deny that they would have to sell it as a low profit item (nevermind
using it as a "loss leader" for their other platforms).

Also by the way, I have been making it a habit to ask vendors
of software I like whether they are interested in a Linux
port. At the very least it often gets them interested in Linux,
and (as Warner shows) a Linux enthusiast can have some effect.

You can do the compile with some help from Andy Burnett, but, even
better, you can get the grass binaries from .... let's see it's...
topquark.cecer.army.mil (129.229.1.77) in /pub/grass

Good luck, I'd appreciate any comments.

Commands mentioned above are from the GNU fileutils package. Available

ditto...  I've got a NoteStar NP-943 notebook with a 3c501 card --
stuck with it because it's the only thing that'll plug into it.

I've got the specs for the card, but have never written a device driver;
I'd appreciate any help I can get! I noticed that the 3c501 was
mentioned somewhere in /usr/src/linux/net/inet, but it seem that the
