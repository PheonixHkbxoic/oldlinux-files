Well, Waffle compiles fine under Linux, and costs around USD120.  There
is also UniBoard BBS available from Riccardo Pizzi in Rome, at a cost
of approx. USD20 per line (minimum USD40).

The UniBoard BBS is only available as binaries, and the current release
only runs on Linux up to 0.99pl12, I think.  I hope that the author will
soon release code that will work on later releases.

I am trying to set up my hard drive in the most efficient way, and I'm going
to re-install Linux.  Does the partition Linux boots on need to be a primary
partition or can it boot from a extended partition?  I am using OS/2 boot
manager if it matters.

I know DOS needs to be a primary partition to boot.  But, OS/2 can be on an
extended partition.  I would like to be able to put Linux on an extended 
partition too,  is this possible?

You could set up LILO to do this for you.  Either have LILO installed on
your hard disk, or on a floppy in the boot drive.  Put an entry in the
config file something like the following (I hope it's right - this is
from memory...)

other=/dev/fd1H1440   (or /dev/fd1h1200, etc...)
        label=boot-b:
        unsafe

the unsafe means that it won't check it when LILO is installed - so you
don't have to have the disk in when you set up LILO.  Hopefully this
will work with Linux - I've only actually tried it with DOS.

Hope this helps

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

Or does somebody know if I can use the amanda-2.1.1 backup

hmm, this seems to be a pertinent problem with lgx. i had the same experience
with a philips-lms cm-205 cd-rom. comparing the source code which should
work according to the manual claims and an actual debugging of the msdos
driver for the last 2 days has revealed severe differences. the only thing
in common is the base address 0x340. it is a real pity, but at least there
is a 30 day trial period and i guess i'll have to return the cd for a refund.
up to this point i have managed to get something of an idea how to access the
drive via direct commands, alas it is not sufficient yet to write my own
device driver. and then there is the egg & chicken problem, how to compile
something for linux, if your system is on a cd ?
needless to say, that i am a bit disappointed that the manual claims are
only vaporware (at least with my version of a CM-205).
sincerely,
carsten

I am running a Linux box with patchlevel 13 of the Kernel, and have recently 
run across a problem with filter. I am also running Elm 2.4 PL23 and all the 
associated stuff. The problem is the following:

Mail is sent to me from a LOCAL user, test:

echo blah | elm cramer

i have a .forward in my home directory of the followoing:

"| /home/cramer/bin/filter -o /home/cramer/Misc/filter-errors"

After the mail is sent I get the following on the end of 
/home/cramer/Misc/filter-errors:

filter (Mon Nov 01 11:23:52 1993 test): Couldn't read filter rules file "/home/test/.elm/filter-rules"!

And the mail is put in test's incoming mailbox. Why would filter try to look 
into test's filter-rules, when it should be looking into mine?

None of this happens when remote mail is sent to me. It is only when it is 
mailed from on this machine.

SLIP. I used SLS 1.03 distribution. In short, I think I get the route
and ifconfig part right, because I can _ping_ both my slip server and
arbitrary IP adresses; however, the TCP/IP programs (telnet, ftp) do
not work.  There are also problems for pings when I set a large packet
size.

Here are the details: I have a Practical Peripherals v32b internal
modem on ttyS1. I configure the modem with disabled compression
negotiation because it did cause me problems in the past; this setup
works under DOS/Clarkson SLIP/NCSA Telnet. Under Linux, I used dip to
connect to our slip server.

BTW, I had to patch dip source because I needed to 'send' a multiword
command to the server as a part of the dialup sequence, and the
distribution version of dip does not allow to 'send' a space within a
string. I can't include the patch here because my Linux's IP doesn't
work yet :^( In my dip script I tried MTU sizes of 1500, 1000 and 500:
it did not seem to change the behaviour described below.

I connected to the slip server and set mode to slip. Next, I needed to
change some ifconfig parameters (we are on a subnetted class B network,
so the default ifconfig broadcast/netmask is wrong). I also  did
'route add default gw <slip-server>'. 

Now I have an 'almost works' situation: 'ping <slip-server>' shows
packets being returned. Ping'ing hosts beyond our slip server works
too.  Even name resolving using our local nameservers works.

However, telnet and ftp hang, AFTER printing a message about
successfull connection to a host. I also noticed that 'ping -sxxx
<hostname>' fails in mysterious ways, for the packet size xxx larger
than some number that I correlate with anything (on one occasion, xxx
was exactly 565; on another try I got ICMP packets as large as 800
bytes through; I may have changed the MTU in the meantime)

The failure mode of ping is interesting: it says that a byte in the
packet (byte number 565 when it fails for 565 byte packets, as far as
I remember) is 0x00 while it should have been 0x20, and then it spews
hex numbers on the screen that look like the packet contents.

I suspected that I may have problems with the MTU, but I tried MTU of
270, 500, 1000 and 1500, without apparent change in the symptoms,
except perhaps change in the treshold at which ping fails. I did not
investigate this correlation systematically, because it was late at
night, and my wife told me to quit immediately :^).

They weren't installed on the hard disk by the "install" script.
Somebody else also said to manually copy the files from the cd to my
hard disk, but I don't _have_ the cd anymore.  That's why I grabbed
the proc stuff off sunsite, which led to my discovery that the LGX
sources weren't really pl13.

I think you're right.  Comparing my experience with ta complete
install with another's experience with a runtime-then-selectively-install
setup, I had fewer problems.  Of course you've got to have 235MB to spare
if you're going to do a complete install then delete what you don't use.

The main problems I had were in trying to rebuild the kernel.  I finally
grabbed the real pl13 soruces from sunsite.
