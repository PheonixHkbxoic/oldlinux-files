Sorry if this is a repost ... I had a probleme with my news reader..

BE CAREFULL WITH SLS 1.03 loadkeys !!!
        
        How Great SLS !!!
 They just upgrade to 0.99pl12 not alpha. That maybe was to try not to be
the last one to make the step.
 But, as Linus said, you have to upgrade keyboard stuff due to a probleme with
some Swiss keyboard.
 Does they read linus "readme" about the kernel ?  

Here is my contribution to your systeme...
Putting the original keyboard stuff from 0.99pl12 into the right
 place to be ready to install with SLS 1.03 .

I suggest that you get the folowing file and type these two lines (as root).
Or that you remove the original keytbls.tgz and put my key-tbls.tgz in place.
                        ... Until they fix it up ...

ftp at is1.vub.ac.be: /pub/exchange/key-tbls.tgz (for 10 days at most)
                feel free to upload anywhere.

sysinstall -remove keytbls
sysinstall -install /your.path.to/key-tbls.tgz

        happy softlanding.

Subject: A question about the SLS sysinstall script's copyright
Date: 19 Aug 1993 00:59:57 GMT

For a while I've been using the sysinstall script from the SLS package to keep
track of what's installed on my system (I've long sinced ditched SLS because
of how out of date a lot of stuff in it are), and today I read that the script
itself is copyrighted.  Well, being that nothing else on my system is, I
figured that I'd ditch it and go my own way.  So, I wrote a very simple install
script (looks very much like the sysinstall script).  My question is, is it
ok for me to distribute my script (I think there are a few people who might
use such a thing, if only for the sake that it's not copyrighted :) without
violating some sort of "look and feel" copyright?  My idea is to distribute my
script such that anyone can do anything to it as long as they don't remove the
message stating such, and the author attributions...

Oops!  Ok, so *almost* everything!  I was thinking more along the lines that
most of the software was under the gnu copyleft...  Freely modifiable and
re-distributable (ooh!  two new words).

Subject: demonstration of fragments
Date: Thu, 19 Aug 1993 00:53:15 GMT

For a demonstration of 'fragments' those of you who still have
a dos partition, run Norton's "ncd" and examine the "sizes" menu
on different directories.

on my system's 30Mb dos partition I get:

        19Mb used by files
        25Mb allocated to files

in a dir containing 27k of small source files:

        27k used by files
        247k allocated to files

ie. overall there's 6Mb or so of space wasted due to the 2k block size.

On linux ext2, the blocksize is a smaller 1024 bytes, so this 
problem is reduced, however on linux we often have LOTS of small 
files, which compounds this problem.
On a typical 100Mb linux fs, i'd guess there's about 15Mb of such space
"unused", this would need to be addressed first (like before a compressed fs?).

You could probably run X quite happily on this set up, but you would
benefit from a fast video card (eg. et4000) and a little more memory
(8Mb).  You would probably find that 80Mb is too little for Linux, but
it depends on the things you want to run.

The lists are for active participation in developement and discussion of
common issues and the impact of changes (for instance, the new dbm code
for the password file that allows more than 20 or so aliases in the aliases
file).  They aren't for release announcements or bug reporting.

Contact information has been provided both in the patchkit documentation
(for FreeBSD) and in the NetBSD documetation (for NetBSD).

I think the only thing I would serve by posting addresses here is a bunch
of "my serial driver doesn't work" and "why don't you implement this"
messages to the lists by people who haven't gotten a satisfactory answer
from the net and don't know how to use "sendbug".

If you care enough to dig the information out and want to code, etc., the
information is available.  That's about all I can say about it.

Linux works on an EISA system just fine and dandy.

It even supports some EISA cards in enhanced mode, like the Adaptec 1740,
UltraStor 24F and DTC 3290 (I get these numbers mixed up all the time) in
1740 emulation.  The BusTek 747s should also work in 1540 emulation, but
it will not be full EISA at this point.

There is probably more I am forgetting, but there isn't that many EISA
cards available anyway.

        hrm.  I had heard about Diamond's proprietary chipset and about some
Diamond cards using the S3 chipset; hadn't heard about ET4k variants though.
So this raises the question.  Does anybody have/is anybody willing to compile
a list of the Diamond cards along with what chipsets they use?  I figure 
there's probably a list like this already available; but most computer
magazines just say "the Diamond [insert special funky name here] comes with
Windows 3.1 drivers and is compatible with most MS-DOS software" or somesuch
with no specifics on what types of chipsets involved.  If people would send me
information regarding which Diamond card they have, what graphics engine/
chipset it uses, and if they've gotten it to work with any XFree86 variant
(Xs3, X8514, whatever) in a color mode, and what programs they needed to set
clocks or whatever, I could summarize to the net.

Subject: DBLSPACE support

A friend and I are thinking of working on dblspace support for linux,
but I was wondering about some stuff first:

- Anyone happen to know who to talk to at MS about technical info about
   dblspace?  (Specific phone numbers are good.  I hate playing phone tag
   when I'm paying for the call, as is usually the case with MS).

- Has anyone started working on dblspace support?

Any general comments, tips, or pointers are welcome.  Thanks.

My system config:
486-33Mhz, 16MB RAM, 250Mb HD, NE2000

I downloaded SLS A1.3 0.99p12 three times from tsx-11 today (Aug 18,
93). I used rawrite to create a1.3. Each time I booted with this disk it
would create the RAMDISK, detect tty's but immediately after trying to
detect the AdLib sound card it would stall.

I have no difficulties with the A1.3 from SLS 1.02.

Any suggestions? Or have I missed some posting regarding this and it is
a known problem?

Hmmmm do you have the evidence to back the speed claim??

Out of interest I did a timing on my 386BSD system compiling JGraph,
as per the article by Ajay Shah:

time on my 386BSD 486/25 with 16M (running slip/X and other cruft)
with mixed SCSI/ESDI disk drives: 144 seconds.

for Linux on a 486/33 with 20M: 177 seconds 

My tests were done running gcc 2.4.5 whereas Ajay's were done using
using 2.3.3

NOT a flame, just a data point.  I will add more data to this later.

    I don't see where Peter said you can't modify or distribute his
scripts. He just seems to be saying you have to label them as his and
not your own.  I fail to see much difference between that and any other
