Maybee we should ask why is the Ati vga that slow? I made similar experiences.
With the Ati Vga part of an Ati graphics ultra the text display with X was

On the other hand an ET4000 card is fully adequate for text display and 
scrolling. This card only reaches its limits if I try to play xpilot.
With MS-Windows the ET4000 card is too slow for text display again, if you
ever tried one of the modern cheap accelerated videocards.

The Linux times are not unreasonable for a process which makes a lot
of use of the FPU, on a machine which has no FPU. The processor spends a
lot of time in the kernel emulating the FPU.

Math emulation.  It's done by the kernel, and is thus counted as system
time, and will obviously take an appreciable amount of time if you are
doing number-crunching on a 486SX.  You'll probably get much better
results on a 486DX, although the Sparc is probably much faster on
floating point math (the 486 isn't really that good: the Pentium looks
much better judging by the TRM).

I have an interesting problem here. I tend to use lots of virtual
consoles and need to keep at least one spare for XFree86. So I change
the number of consoles in include/linux/tty.h to 12

Now when I run pl14 with 12 consoles I get one of two effects:

i)  it locks up solid before I get a prompt on any console.
ii) I get login prompts on the specified consoles but when I try to
    login I don't get a password prompt just ld.so.1.3 (yes it is
    installed!)

It seems to me that some memory might be getting trashed but I don't
know where to look.

Does anyone feel like compiling plain vanilla pl14 with GCC 2.4.5 and
12 virtual consoles ? I would love to know what happens.

Puzzled,

The maths is it.  Very likely, you are on a 386 DX or 486 SX without
an 387.  Every time, you do a math instruction, like an addition or
multiplication of real numbers, the 386 produces an exception, because
there is no 387.  The linux kernel catches that exception, and performs
the apropriate calculations.

The advantage: applications do not need to know, whether a 387
coprocessor is there.  The disadvantage: the overhead of the
math error exception is bigger than linking to a math library
and calling special functions for math.

Subject: Multiple SCSI disks with Linux
Date: 23 Nov 93 17:45:41 GMT
Reply-To: phill@xesets.demon.co.uk


I wonder if anyone can help ???

I have a 486/33 with 16MB memory, a Future Domain TMS1680 (the expensive
version !) with 2 disks, a Fujitsu 1.1GB and a Micropolis 170MB.

Under DOS all works fine. I can access both disks without problems.
Under Linux pl9 (before the disk crash, caused by DOS, _not_ Linux)
the system would only boot if I disconnected the Micropolis disk.
I was using LILO (from the Fujitsu) to select the partition to boot
from. I had built a new kernel appropriate to the installed hardware.
Both disks are found but the boot hangs at around the point it
should (I think) be loading the SCSI driver stuff. If I have a SCSI
tape attached, that is found without problems and is useable.
(I have had the problem since pl4.)

Before I install the latest pl of Linux, I would like to find out the
reason (at least), if there is one, for the problem I have running
more than one hard disk, and hopefully fix it.

Any help, advice, suggestions, would be more than gratefully received.

Peter.

Subject: TMC1680, Adaptec 1542, FD 14F Floppy disk???
Date: Fri, 3 Dec 1993 11:39:33 GMT

     From ads and other sources I see that these controlers have
floppy disk support.  As I have a GSI1533-21 IDE controler which
also has floppy support but dosen't allow it to be disabled.  I'm
wondering if any of these SCSI controlers allow thier floppy disk
support to be disabled so it won't interfere with the GSI's floppy
controler?  I know there are floppyless versions of these cards, but
I wish to be able to move this controler to a new machine in the
future and be able to have floppy support at that time.  If not I'll
just get a floppyless version of one of the above controlers.

     On a side note:  Has anybody used the Fujitsu M2511A 128meg MO
drive with Linux with any of the above controlers under Linux.  I'd
like to know how well it works under Linux as it's a possibility
for a future drive for my system.

     Please reply via mail and I'll sumorize responces.

        The one thing I failed to mention in the previous post was that if you
happen have the firmware for >1Gb disks, you can turn it off (with a jumper on
the 1542B) so that you will be able to access your disks under linux.  On the
1542C this option is selected in firmware.  The upshot is that you should not
need to get new ROMs to use an Adaptec card under linux.

I just got fig2MF, which I think is more useful.  It makes metafont source,
so you don't have to use LaTeX  (I use AMS-TeX).  It's pretty impressive.

The only hang-up is that my gftopk sometimes chokes if the file is too big.
I asked around the net for a re-compiled version supporting more lines  --
but even though I can read the web source to see what to change, I don't know
what the heck to do to compile that.  web2c just chokes.  

But the drawings become simply a font that TeX can use like any other font.
Far better than a ps or pictex picture, in my view.

And while we're at it...

How about having *multiple* X-window servers running?  My wife and I are
getting tired of having to kill each other (well, our X-sessions) when
we switch back and forth.  With VCs, we can both stay logged in, but
it would be nice to be able to keep our X environments alive as well...

Is there a way to do this?  (I guess what I'm saying is that it would
be nice to have multiple xdm's running on different VC's...)

Well, this is interesting...  I have never heard of such problems before. 
I went out and bought a brand new Adaptec 1542CF controller and 1.2 gig
SCSI II disk drive.  It's working just fine under Linux (yes it's still
greater than 1 gig after formatting).  My system runs a BBS and sees quite
a bit of activity.  The Linux box has been up for over a month now and no
problems.  Once I even had a core dump that was 890 megs in size.  I
simply deleted it and kept on going.  Didn't hurt a thing.  Not only that,
but this drive/controller setup SCREAMS!  I'm using a 486dx/50 which helps
of course, but a "find / -name core -print" completes in like a second on
this thing (fully loaded SLS install).

So, what should I be wary of.  What exactly doesn't work with these big
drives on these controllers?  Perhaps the problem is only present if you
have a single PARTITION over 1 gig?  <shrug>
