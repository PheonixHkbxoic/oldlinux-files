Hi,

Did anybody manage to run lemacs-19.8 on linux ? I have some problems
to get it compile right, even with the patches that were published for
v19.6.

Thanks for any clue,

I don't think there is an official set of patches for lemacs-19.8, but
I have a set of partial patches that you can use.  The patches are
partial because you can easily causes zombies which can tie up your
machine.  On the other hand, lemacs works if all you do is edit and
run an occasional M-x compile ro M-x shell.

: You will wait at least

It's been twelve weeks since our order, and while now we have an Ambra Pentium
PC, it still doesn't work.

: I was able to get the information I needed from Dell immediately.
: Their Sales Representatives new much more about their product
: than their counterparts at AMBRA knew about theirs.

I'll second that.  The true test of a tech support dept is how they handle a
real problem.  I was most unimpressed with the quality of tech support Ambra
provides.  I'm not looking forward to dealing with them again anytime soon.

My employer chose Ambra mostly because of their relationship with IBM.  We
ordered the machine in the middle of August, and were told it would take 4-6
weeks.  Eight weeks later (middle of October), we called back, and
discovered they apparently "lost" our order.  A machine finally arrived Nov
5th, broken.  The power on light lights, the keyboard leds blink, the fan
and hard disk spin.  That's all.  No messages, no beep, no floppy disk
access.

I called Ambra Tech Support, and was greeted by a (now familiar) recording
saying I had a choice between waiting at least 10 minutes on hold, or
leaving my name and phone number and they'll call back within 2 hours.  The
first time I chose the latter.  They called 3 hours later, after I had left
for the day.

I called back the next day, sat on hold for 15 minutes, and talked with some
young guy about our dead system.  He asked me the standard stuff, did I try
reseating the cards, is everything plugged in.  Then he asked me to check
the motherboard power connector.  Yes, I said, it's firmly plugged in.  What
about the other one, P02, under the floppy drive.  Hang on, let me check.
No there's nothing plugged in there.  Actually, I don't see any cable with
that type of plug. Is there supposed to be something plugged in there, I
ask?  I don't know, he answers, let me check, and I'll call you back this
afternoon.

        Huh?  You DON'T KNOW?  Then WHY did you ask?

To make an already too-long story end quicker, they finally decided (two
phone calls, two tech reps and five days later) to replace our whole system.
They claim our replacement system will ship next week.  Their 'two day
repair' claim is a real joke.

In my opinion, Ambra has already struck out (four strikes, if you also count
the billing snafu).  I'm fed up with them, but I'm giving them one last
chance to get us a working system, just because my job is providing tech
support (in house), and have had my bad days too.  But if there are any more
screwups, the whole thing goes back (for a 3rd refund).

Can anyone comment on ALR, Dell or Zenith's tech support people?  I already
know enough about Gateway, thank you.

Well, I can only recommend "mgetty+sendfax" - less overhead, less bulky

   Indeed 'crond' is the culprit here, and slackware enables it by
   default.  I tracked this down after the linux laptop that I use
   didn't spin down the disk after I programmed the 'IdleTimer' value
   to 35 seconds.

I disabled crond, but my hard disk would spin down and then
spin up thirty seconds later.  I found out when I tested
this without X running that the messages "Unexpected HD
interrupt" and "HD controller reset" were being printed to
the console, and when this message was flushed by /etc/update
the HD would spin up again.  When X is running these messages
are not visible.  I had to comment these messages
out of the kernal (in kernel/blk_drv/hd.c) *and* disable
crond in /etc/rc to get a quiescent notebook.

Er, excuse me, but if you have a Sun workstation and give the root
password to someone, they can do the same thing as any machine can.

PC's running unix variants are quite secure, if you don't pass out
the root password or supply users with setuid programs to muck
about with the network.

This has nothing to do with the physical design of the machine.  It has
everything to do with configuring the unix variant it is running.

Show me how easy it is for a user of Linux, 386bsd, FreeBSD or other
intel based unix to change the IP address.  If you your users run
their own unix boxes on your subnet, then by all means, expect
your network to go down :)

Right, the point isn't that you have PCs on a network, its that you
are allowing "normal" users to configure hosts on a network, which can
lead to no end of trouble.

>This has nothing to do with the physical design of the machine.  It
>has everything to do with configuring the unix variant it is running.

The same problems are there with DOS, of course. Even a Mac could have
its IP address set to the same thing as another machine on its subnet
and screw things up.

>If you your users run their own unix boxes on your subnet, then by
>all means, expect your network to go down :)

Exactly. That's why you take all of the machines that are "insecure"
and toss them into the same subnet, behind a router from the
"important" machines on campus. At HMC, there were a couple of
problems with a student setting his IP address the same as one of the
primary CS department machines, and with a staff member misconfiguring
a terminal server to have the same IP number as that same CS
department machine (and boy, were they thrilled!).

Now, the dorms are part of their own subnet, so the user-configured
machines can only screw each other up. (Well, unless they set the IP
address to that of the router, but then that only screws things up on
the dorm subnet, not the whole campus network.)

This also means that students can't "snoop" connections within the
administration's subnet, but only connections that involve a box in
the dorm subnet.

Again, don't just say the problem is with allowing Unix boxes on a
network, it's with allowing any user-configured box on the network,
whether it runs a Unix variant, DOS, NT, OS/2, or MacOS.

Based on what I have seen posted here already, I think it would be more 
accurate to say that the Hurd, in a limited configuration, will be able to
provide a unix-like environment as a backward-compatibility; the more 
advanced aspects will help to achieve what many consider to be the "right"
thing in operating systems, including better scalability (through enhanced
parallelism) and greater configurability without sacrificing protection.

I agree that Linux provides a great unix-like environment, but for some of
us cloning unix is more a stop-gap measure than fulfillment.

BogoMips are about 1% accuracy on any system.  The test loop keeps increasing
the number of BogoLoops(tm) done, until total time exceeds one second.

And the timing is done in jiffies, which are 1/100th's of a second.

Precision then is
