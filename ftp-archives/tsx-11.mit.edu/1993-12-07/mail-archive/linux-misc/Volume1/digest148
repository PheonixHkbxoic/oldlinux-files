Subject: One more basic question (about date)
Date: Wed, 22 Sep 1993 13:58:34 GMT

  Here is another basic question. I run Linux 0.99.12
  on a simple 386SX33 with 8 Megs of memory. It is
  presently used by a student.
  
  1. The date is correct, except that it should bear
     the label EST and not GMT.

     In the file /etc/login.defs, I changed the line
      ENV_TZ          TZ=EST5EDT
     I also experimented direct commands like
          TZ=EST5EDT date
     and enen created a file /etc/tzname containing
     the string EST5EDT.
     When I specify TZ=GMT0, the time is still the
     local time.
     I seems the TZ variable is ignored by this GNU date.
     Don't know what to do about that one.
      
   Thanks for the preceeding answers about floppy disks
   It works fine now. Only this date problem remains.

Hi, 
  I've compiled a newer release of the Tcl/Tk toolkit (7.0b3 & 3.3b3, I think)
on my linux machine and, although it runs fine "out-of-the-box", I wonder if
 anyone knows how to build the shared libs "libtcl.sa" and "libtk.sa" so that
they could substitute the older ones that come with SLS 1.03?

Hi
I want to install GRASS on a Linux platform. I just read through
some guides from *.army.mil and got the feeling that it will be
a nice job. If somebody has already experience and perhaps a cut
down version that gives a feeling about it, it would be great.
I heard about a Linux binary somewhere.

Email is fine

Hi there,


 I have installed the SLS 1.03 release, with some problems.

 My machine is a 486DX50, 8Mo RAM, 214Mo  HD(IDE), screan NEC 4FG
 mouse MS compatible 3 bottons, AZERTY keyboard, NCR 77C22E (2Mo) video card
 with a DOS and a LINUX partitions.

1- after runing fdisk and writing the partition table to the disk, I had this
 message:
   79076 unallocated sectors. Is it that bad ???

2- at the tex pkgs installation I had thsi message:
   installing texbin...tar:could not create file usr/TeX/lib/tex/inputs:Is
   a directory

3- at the end of installation, when the system write the de boot floppy
   I had this message:
   Setting up lilo on $ROOTDISK
    If any specify a DOS partition to (...blabla...):/dev/hda2 (my LINUX 
    partition, I answered!!)
    First boot sector of /dev/hda2 doesn't have a lilo signature (what's wrong??) 

4- an other message;
    open /etc/lilo/map no such file or directory

==============end of installation

after reboot, I tried to change the american keyboard into french keyboard 
with setkbd but it asked for files I don't know where they are.
The README file is not very clear for me.
same problem with the doc of X11, I haven't found the doc for my video card,
to change the clock parameter and so.

Any help greatly apreciated, if any one around here is using a NCR 77C22E 
video card and have a runing Xconfig file, send it to me via email.

I would prefer email answers if any, there's a lot fo trafic in this newsgroup

Thanx a lot

I have access to a couple of Thomas-Conrad 16-bit arcnet cards, so I'd like
to know if they will work with my linux box.  The only other thing I know
about them is they use a coax not twisted pair cable.

BTW, I looked in the NET-2-FAQ and didn't see any mention of it.

Subject: New Linux T-shirt
Date: 22 Aug 1993 14:38:57 -0400
Keywords: Tshirt

Great news, the ALL New Linux T-shirt is here!

Yes folks, they're here at last:  the New Linux Tee.  With a new
design they are a must have for the devoted Linux activist.  This
new design was inspired from one created by Steve Okay and Darren
Stalder [The real story is that when trying to create the screens
for printing, the program that was used (ironically CorrelDraw!
for Windoze) could not read the ps file of design (which is on
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/logos/shirt.ps.z) to do color seperation,
so we recreated it by hand (it looks almost the same, with some
minor changes from the original (the joke is still the same, see
below).] which features a computer monitor that is displaying one
little Windoze dialogue box with the following to say about life:

               |-----------------------------------|
               | - |            ALERT!             |
               |-----------------------------------|
               |                                   |
               |         You can still escape from |
               |         from the "Gates" of Hell! |
               | /---\                             |
               | | ! |        Use Linux?           |
               | \---/                             |
               |               /------\            |
               |               | Yes! |            |
               |               \------/            |
               |-----------------------------------|

This is the best I can do with ASCII, it looks much, much better
with nice graphics and color.  The design is located in the back
of the shirt, while on the front in the right upper chest area,
there is a nice line drawing of a platypus with the Linux name
below in various fonts (the X looks like the Xlogo and can also be
found on sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/logos/llogo.gif.z).  I don't
know who created this one, I tried really, really hard to find who
it was, but my queries remained unanswered.  If anyone knows who
it was, then please let me know so I can give proper credit. Please
let me know via email.

Oh, the screen design is covered under the GPL, please read the
PostScript file for license info.  I have no idea what the platypus
is covered under (no copyright messages were included anywhere).

The shirt itself is white 100% cotton, high quality and here is a
general idea of where the designs will be located on the shirt:

                /---\_/---\        /---\_/---\
               /_/|     |\_\      /_/|     |\_\
                  |   * |            |*****| 
                  |     |            |*****|
                  |     |            |*****|
                  |_____|            |_____|

                   Front               Back

Please take me literally when I say "general idea", especially with
ASCII graphics.

Cost:  $14 plus $3 shipping in the US, $5.25 elsewhere.  Proceeds
are all going to the Free Software Foundation (for the heavy efforts
on the GNU project which make Linux actually usable) and Linus
Torvalds (for creating and maintaining Linux in the first place).
Here is the price breakdown:

                  Shirt             $ 5.80
                  Printing          $ 3.45
                  FSF               $ 3.50
                  Linus Torvalds    $ 1.25
                                    ------
                                    $14.00

Costs are approximate, but in case they are more or less than
expected, the proceeds will be divided between the FSF and Linus
on roughly a 3:1 ratio.

Checks and money orders are accepted in US funds (checks must be
from a US bank).  Only an insane person (the sanely challenged)
would actually send cash, which if you do that (I am not going to
say you can't send it, I just don't recommend it very, very highly),
I am not responsible if the postal carrier(s) lose it.  Make checks
to "Charles Stephens" and send orders to:

I seem to remember seeing this thread started off with references to
SimCity. Well I downloaded the demo binary for a Sun 4, and in my
opinion, it was a wee bit slow. This was on a Sparc II. I hate to think
what it'll be like on my 386SX25. The DOS (yeuch) version on my home
machine is faster than the Sun one.

I know, that the DOS version has total control over the machine, the Sun
has to run an X Server, etc. But if you really want to play games, why
not just boot up DOS ?

I don't have _any_ complaints about Linux - in fact I wiped DOS from my
box because of it.

     Here is another basic question. I run Linux 0.99.12
     on a simple 386SX33 with 8 Megs of memory. It is
     presently used by a student.

     1. The date is correct, except that it should bear
        the label EST and not GMT.

         ENV_TZ          TZ=EST5EDT

             TZ=EST5EDT date
        and enen created a file /etc/tzname containing
        the string EST5EDT.

Hmmm what Unix do you think you are using? :-)
Values of TZ are interpreted as filenames in /usr/lib/zoneinfo, look
there for valid values. If you don't have a TZ variable ``localtime''
is assumed so /usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime should be a link to your
local zone.

        When I specify TZ=GMT0, the time is still the
        local time.
Hang on are you sure you are exporting TZ? This should work. Anyhow
what do you mean _still_ in local time I thought your problem was that
yuor system was always reporting in GMT. (OK so you may have your
clock set wrong by 5 hours but it's still reporting what it believes to
be GMT).

        I seems the TZ variable is ignored by this GNU date.

No it's not

        Don't know what to do about that one.

Why is this not in the FAQ?

 A while ago now my System Admin was talking to me and we were discussing
BBS systems that he could run for the people who wanted access but were 
lost in a shell....   I played around for a while with C++ to see what I
could come up with...  I was in Emacs playing with the code when my 
SysAdmin "phoned" again and mentioned perl...  I said i'd take a look at it
and I did,  Perl caught on quickly (most programming langauges do once i 
play with them for a while)...  not long after that the Basis of "WhatBBS"
was born... a BBS system that is very configurable and nice to use,  things
are moving quiet well now...   For ease of upgrade etc WhatBBS has been
written as a Modular system where u can "plug in" modules...  Current modules
include a Chat FrontEnd that will display a list of users logged in and ask
for an input,  it will then call up a chat utility to initiate private talk
with that user or enter 0 for Public "CHAT"...   a Qwk handle using UQwk
and a menu system...)

 WhatBBS is still in it's VERY early stages running Under Xenix,  a friend
of mine is about to get things running under Linux, and today i have just
partitioned my drive and Linux (and WhatBBS) are going on by this weekend.

 If you would like more info, please drop me an email and i'll see what we
can do...  More plug in bits will be available as things move on but the
basic system is very operable at the moment, and terribly stable...

 I will be now removing all definite things from the code (like calling
WhatMail.pl to check a users mailbox) and allow these to be externally
setup,  current setup will be greatly improved in the near future with
a configuration utility to allow a menu-orientated setup...  

 It will support 3 basic terminals...  those with ANSI,  those without
and those who cant even do High Ascii characters...  3 text files for each
screen are stored and the approipate displayed.   An Easy menu system allows
u to design ONE of each (ansi/hi-ascii/vanilla-ascii) screen which will be
used by ALL access levels...  Access levels can range from just about any 
number u can use... here at scorch new users get 0,  validated 1 and those
with a shell get 5...   but u could make this between 0 and 100 or whatever.
