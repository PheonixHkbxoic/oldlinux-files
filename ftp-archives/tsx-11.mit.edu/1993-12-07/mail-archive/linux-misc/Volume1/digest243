The RSA system is a method for encrypting a message, such that anyone
can encrypt a message, but it takes a second key that only the owner
knows to decrypt it.  This is known as a Public Key Encryption.  The
trick is that the public key should not allow anyone else to figure
out what the private key is.

In order to do this neat feat, two large numbers (usually primes) are
multiplied together and in order to break the code, you need to factor
this large number.  When Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman invented the
code, they published the above number and asked people to try and
break the code through any means possible.  Since that time, (1979?),
the only method that people have thought of is to factor the number.
Or, if they have thought up a different attack, they aren't talking
about it in public.  (I am simplifying things a _great_ deal, almost
to the point of being wrong.  But, this still gives you the reason why
you might want to factor such a large number)

This encryption system is very easy to implement, and anyone can
easily create the public and private keys.  Technically, the only
major problem with it is that it requires a program that can do
multiplications and find remainders of the divisions of these very
large numbers.  It is not hard to do, but it is slower than other
encryption methods and it is harder to implement as a single chip.

The other "problem" with this method is that it is patented, so you
can't use it commercially without paying a royalty.  (The patent will
run out in the US in another couple of years, and I am not sure if the
patent was ever valid elsewhere in the world.)


When the above number was published, it was believed that it would
take hundreds, if not hundreds of thousands of years to factor the
number.  Since that time, people have found better methods to factor
numbers.  More importantly, people are now able to use the idle cpu
time of hundreds, if not thousands of computers to work on the problem
in parallel.  If you can convince a million people to let you use
their computers for free for 12hrs per day, you can factor these very
large numbers fairly quickly.  

By factoring this large number, it would show that in order for the
RSA system to be really secure, you need to pick larger numbers than
"just" 129 digits.  This isn't hard to do, but it slows down the
encryption/decryption a little bit more.  Factoring a number that is
twice as large (2 times the number, not 2 times as many digits) takes
4 times as long (approx).  This means that if you had a 130 digit
number, it would take 100 times as long to factor.  If it can be shown
that it is technically possible to factor a 129 digit number, people
will just pick 150 or 200 digit numbers instead.



So, this is mostly an academic exercise to prove how that it is now
possible to factor numbers in the 129 digit range.  There is also a
$100 prize, but I doubt that the money is the motivating factor for
anyone.

I don't understand.  THis is already happening.  I bought Motif, whicg seems
pretty commercial to me.  There was no big stink about binary-only that I saw,
although there was some concern about the effect of shared lib's and gnu's
copyleft.  What, btw, is the upsot of that?  

I think most of us understand the need for binary distributions.  We only want
library compatibility.  Since other platforms have this, I can't imagine a
problem.

I'm looking for a cdrom with a 'recent' linux kernal.  Also,  I'd like to
be able to 'run' from the cdrom.  To make things interesting, the cdrom
drive is a panasonic 562b running off my Soundblaster 16asp.

Anyone know where I can find such an animal?

(I'm currently using the July 1993 Info Magic Unix CDROM, but it's 
kernel 98, I believe it has a kernel 99, but I'm not certain of it's
patchlevel, but I can't find drivers to use my cdrom.


Any companies selling cdroms of this nature (preferably with all the
gnu toys and X utilties pre-installed on the cdrom), please email me
with information

Interesting that you should mention Oracle specifically.  As with you,
everything I do for a living can IN PRINCIPLE be done with free
software...but in practice, the company that pays my living uses Oracle
and will almost certainly continue to use Oracle for a long, long time. 
I "insist on running Oracle" because I have to be compatible with an
employer who uses Oracle, and I doubt that I'm the only person in that
situation.

I could do much more of my development work on a Linux system if Oracle
existed there, but it doesn't--so my Linux system is less useful to me
whenever I have to do anything that involves Oracle (or any of several
other commercial packages, for that matter).  Linux would be enormously
more useful to me (and to my end users and my employer) if those
commercial packages were supported.

I'm not knocking Linux at all, understand!  I'm just complaining that I
can't get the full benefit of it because of the lack of various
commercial products that I must at least be compatible with.  I can use
SLIP and Xfree86 to turn my former MS-DOS machine into a GREAT
X-terminal...but it's a damn shame that that's ALL I can really use it
for, when I've got a whole UNIX environment sitting there mostly unused.
 Commercial product availability would, for me at least, literally make
the difference between a having only a humble X-terminal, and a having a
full-on UNIX workstation.

I'm perhaps a different breed of user than the Old Guard of the Linux
community: I think Linux is pretty neat, but that's not why I'm using
it.  I'm using it because it meets my needs--or at least, I use it
sometimes because it meets some of my needs.  I'd use it more if it met
more of my needs, and my employers might take more of an interest in it
if it met more of their needs.

I think the fact that cold-hearted, opportunistic, philistine vultures
like myself are beginning to sniff around Linux is really a good sign:
it's direct confirmation that Linux is not merely a toy, not just an
academic curiosity, it's a real, production operating system that people
OTHER than kernel-hacking propellerheads can use to get commercial work
done.  However, as nifty as Linux is (and I mean that in all sincerity,
I think it's pretty nifty indeed), I don't think Linux will realize its
full potential unless and until we flinty-eyed corporate bastards are
able to run our feelthy commercial software on it.

The availability of strategic commercial software applications is
enough, in some cases, to keep otherwise-decent people chained to
MS-DOS.  Can the Linux community really live with that on their souls?

Subject: Disks with more than 1024 cylinders
Date: 25 Oct 1993 23:56:59 GMT

I've laid my grubby hands on an old MFM drive with the following
geometry:
        1224 cylinders, 15 heads, 17 sectors per track

I wanted to install Linux on this in one large partition, but seems to
have run into a problem.  When I fdisk the drive to create partitions,
fdisk is happy to show me the correct geometry and even allows me to
set the partition sizes to this limit, but when I verify the partition
table strange things pop out.  The cylinders past 1024 wrap around to
0, ie. are interpreted modulo 1024.

I know about the 1024 cylinder limit of DOS/BIOS, but I've been
successful in formatting and some such the disk with Disk Manager which
sees, and uses, all the cylinders.

Question:  Is there an internal limit in the disk device drivers of
  1024 cylinders (I've browsed the code and saw nothing)?  Is the
  limit a safety `feature' imposed by fdisk or is there some other
  sane explanation why I can't use the last 30Mb of my drive?

Thanks for any helpful pointers,

I prefer to make a point to say "your question should not have appeared in
c.o.l.* since it's not linux-specific" and answer the question they asked.

If we get the crap out of c.o.l.* then the volume will go down, the noise
will go down, and the blood pressure will go down.  There are several
thousand other newsgroups that people can ask probably 90% of the questions
they ask into.

My personal opinion is that asking for followups via mail or setting a
Followups-To: or Reply-To: header is perfectly fine and not rude in the
least.  Ian disagrees.  That doesn't mean either of us is a bad person
(or that either of us is 'correct'...)

If you try to install Linux, for the first time, with a large
file system of type ext2 (EG you are installing SLS),
you will probably hit the well-known bug wherein it
can't allocate a block for inode table.
This can be very frustrating.  You can, by trial and error,
find a block count that will work.  This took me all day, and
wasted several megabytes of disk.
Or you can get use the brand new (2 weeks ago) mke2fs version 0.3d
instead of the mke2fs that comes with SLS.

Remy Card wrote mke2fs and released the source only.
The source will not do you much good on your initial install.

I compiled Remy's source for you first-timers.
The easiest way to use it is to get e2bin3dS.egz and gunzip
it onto a floppy.  When you get to the part of the install
procedure where it wants to run mke2fs, bail out to a shell.
Mount the e2bin3dS floppy in your *second* floppy drive.
Execute bin/mke2fs from that floppy instead of the one that
comes with SLS.  This is the latest and greatest mke2fs and
it is supposed to have the bug fixed.
The binaries are big because they are linked with static
libraries.  When you are all installed you can get the source
and make compact DLL binaries instead.

If you only have one floppy drive, you will have to unpack the
tar version instead.
Please mail me if you cannot figure out how to use it,
or if it does not work for you.

Subject: AMBRA Pentium Linux
Date: Tue, 26 Oct 93 08:46:33 GMT

Abstract:

The memory bus in AMBRA DP-Series & TP-Series computers is clocked
at the same speed as the 60 MHz Pentium processor and moves 64 bits
at a time between the processor and the 70 nanosecond Dynamic RAM.
The performance compares with that of the SPARCstation 10 Model 30.
TP-Series computers are upgradeable to dual Pentium processors and
share system memory but no supporting software is available.

AMBRA's prices seem to be competitive and service seems to be fair
but their policies are inflexible and unresponsive to customer needs.
They have a good selection of products but options are limited.

I have asked the people at AMBRA if they would Install Linux on the
machines that they sell us.  They have given me little reason to be
encouraged but they have not said no yet.

Initial Contact:

Last August, I called AMBRA's toll free number (1-800-252-6272)
(Weekdays 8 am to 9 pm [ET] and Saturdays 10 am to 6 pm [ET].
In Canada call 1-800-363-0066.)
and asked for some literature about their product line.
I was assured that the information would be sent out the same day.
Exactly three weeks later, I got five glossy flyers and an unsigned letter
from Dave Middleton, President of AMBRA Computer Corporation.
This is the only name that I will ever mention in association with AMBRA
since I did don't have anyone's explicit permission to use their name.

Price Quote:

I called AMBRA again at the above number and asked them to give
me a quote for one of their TP-Series (Pentium in a Tower case)  
computers -- Model TP60E/VL with

*       60 MHz Intel Pentium processor
*       512KB cache expandable to 1024KB
*       upgradeable Flash BIOS
*       8MB 72-pin, 70 ns system memory
        expandable to 128MB
*       8 32-bit EISA expansion bus slots
*       2 VESA local bus slots
*       Onboard dual-channel fast SCSI-2
*       7.2"W x 23.3"D x 23.2"H tower case
        with 8 expansion slots and 12 drive bays
*       350-watt power supply
*       240MB IDE 15ms hard disk drive
*       3.5" 1.44MB diskette drive
*       L25 S3 805 video accelerator with 1MB DRAM
*       1024x768 15", 0.28mm dot pitch AMBRA FST
        low radiation, non-interlaced color monitor
*       16-bit 10 Base T network card
*       1 parallel and 2 serial ports
*       PS/2 keyboard and mouse

They said that they would FAX a quote to me right away but I never got it
because they got my FAX number wrong.  I had to call them again a week later
and ask for it again.  It was $4395 plus tax and shipping.

Technical Information:

The people who gave me the quote are in El Segundo, California.
The machines are assembled in in Atlanta, Georgia.
Corporate headquarters are in Raleigh, North Carolina.
Technical support is handled out of Toronto, Canada.
The people in El Segundo can give you the number for technical support
if you ask them questions they can't answer.  They people in Toronto
don't know everything about the machines that AMBRA sells but I believe
they know more than they are willing to say.

I was told that the data path to system memory was 64 bits wide and
that the memory bus was clocked at 60 MHz.  When I asked whether this
implied 5 or 6 wait states with the 70 ns memory, they said they didn't
know.  They confirmed that there was a socket for a second Pentium
processor that would share system memory with the first.  When I asked
why the Dual Pentium system was not available, they said that they didn't
know.  When I asked whether it was because there was no supporting
software, they supposed that might be the reason.  I suspect from their
answers that there was more to this than they were willing to tell me.

AMBRA offers a 30-day money-back guarantee and a one-year IBM onsite
warranty.  But don't expect to see an IBM service representative at
your door unless you have dozens of AMBRA machines there.  Even if
you can get onsite service, you probably won't see anyone within
two days.  Currently, it takes about two weeks to get someone on site
and they hope eventually to get this down to three days.  If you have
just one machine, you will probably never see an IBM service person.
But they do promise technical support 7 days a week, 24 hours a day
via a toll-free telephone number.  If they can't solve your problem
over the telephone you will probably end up sending faulty components
back to AMBRA for replacement.  "Return shipping and insurance charges
are the responsibility of the customer."

Competitive Prices:

Since I don't know any other vendor who is selling Pentium based
systems that compare with those from AMBRA, I asked the people at
AMBRA for a quote for a more conventional system for comparison.
I may eventually post the details of this comparison but not here.
I found their quote to be just a little higher than that of a local
computer store (20/20 Technologies) which has prices competitive
with other stores around Los Angeles.  The system that they quoted
had only 128KB cache.  It had room for an additional 128K but AMBRA
refused to install the extra cache!  I was informed that I would
have to buy the extra cache from a third party and install it myself.

Installing Linux:

I asked whether or not AMBRA would install Linux on their systems
for us.  After explaining what Linux was to several people who could
not make such a decision, it was decided that only Dave Middleton
himself could make such a decision and I got his telephone number.
But when I called Dave, the people I talked to decided that he was
much too important to talk to me.  So I was transferred to someone
else and got to explain all over once again what Linux was and why
AMBRA should install it on their systems for us.  This person was
very polite and charming and promised to "get with" the technical
people and "research" my proposal then "get back to me".  After
about a week, I called again.  But they hadn't any word from the
technical people yet.  The last three times I called, I got a
recorded message promising to call back before the end of the
working day but I never got a call back and I don't suppose that
I expect one either.  After all, AMBRA is an IBM company.

Performance:

A Sun SPARC 10 and a similarly equipped AMBRA Pentium should deliver
comparable performance.  But the only way to test this assertion is
for someone to install Linux on an AMBRA Pentium and run benchmarks
on both machines.  If anyone has done this, I would appreciate it
very much if someone would post the results to this newsgroup.
