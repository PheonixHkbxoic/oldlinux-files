Guten Tag!

Users can access my machines via a dial-in port, using getty 2.0.7b
and the shadow login suite.

I want to enforcer maximal login times for users dialing in. That means:
not only periods of time during the day when they are allowed to log on
but the maximal time they are allowed to be logged on should be limited.

Unfortunately, browsing through the documentations of the above mentioned
package gave me no insight how to reach this. Any idea?

Any information will be appreciated. Thank you for your help!

SLS is still perceived as the "flagship" Linux distribution by many, probably
because it has wider distribution than Slackware because it's been around
longer.  To the extent that this is true and it has flaws that are neither
inherent to Linux nor present in other distributions, *it* *is* *hurting*
*the* *image* *of* *Linux*.

It should be either fixed or dropped.  I'd prefer fixed, myself.  But until
one or the other is done, SLS is hurting more than it helps.  Elder-statesman
it may be, but that doesn't justify letting it drag us into the mud.

Guten Tag!

The users on my machine want to have a chatting mechanism, eg. for getting
help from the sysadmin without the time consuming mail/write cycles.

There is the BSD talk. Unfortunately, it needs UDP to run and IP is not
activated on my machine.

So: Is there any chat program which does not need a working IP? Has
anybody patched the talk package to run without IP?

Any information will be appreciated. Thank you for your help!

        I just did the same thing, but it took just about an hour.
        Using a 66mhzDX/2 IBM PS/1 with 16 megs, 1542c with a Texel
        Double speed cdrom.  However, seems the copy skips some
        things.  /usr/src/linux/fs/proc/* is missing, but is
        on the cdrom.  Copied the files over, and the kernel compiles fine.
        Also, /etc/lilo/install fails as lilo is not in /etc/lilo.
        LGX will not recognize any IDE drive in the PS/1.  Seems 
        the intelligent IDE detect on the PS/1 fools linux.  I
        have 2 400 meg IDE drives and a 350 meg SCSI drive on
        the 1542c.  The boot floppy fires up the SCSI drive just fine.

   ERR, what is the object of the RSA-129 project? I was just wondering if you
   could give a (very) brief synopsis. (ie what did that last post mean?)

OK, here's the call for participants in the project.

Paul


CALL FOR PARTICIPANTS
=====================

In 1977, a 129-digit integer appeared in the pages of Scientific American.
This number, the RSA challenge modulus or RSA-129, has not yet been
successfully factored.  Factoring it, a 425-bit number, would be a major
milestone in cryptography, as it would show that current technology is able to
break commonly-used RSA-cryptosystem keys within a reasonable time.

Excerpted from the RSA Factoring Challenge news:

The "RSA challenge" published in the August 1977 issue of Scientific American
(in Martin Gardner's column) is still open, and the $100 prize offer still
stands.  This prize can be won by factoring the RSA modulus published there,
which is:

RSA-129 = 11438162575788886766923577997614661201021829672124236256256184
          29357069352457338978305971235639587050589890751475992900268795
          43541 (129 digits, checksum = 105443)

--- End of RSA Factoring Challenge news ---

As with several other recent large scale factoring projects, we are attacking
this number with a very large number of workstations independently operating
at dozens of research and corporate networks around the world.  We are
soliciting volunteers to provide compute cycles to help us towards our goal.

With the permission of the authors, we are using the publicly available code
of the Lenstra/Manasse Factoring by Email project, with modifications by Paul
Leyland and Derek Atkins for RSA-129 and multiple machine types.  The sieving
is distributed around the Internet, with relations transferred to a central
site by email or ftp as convenient.  Combining the relations and matrix
elimination will be performed at ISU, using a combination of structured Gauss
and a MasPar dense matrix eliminator.

Each participant is provided with complete source code for the siever.  You
can easily verify that the program takes no input from your machines and does
not pose a security risk.  It requires only an email connection to transmit
partial results -- the software does not require communication with other
machines except for this purpose.  It is easy to install, and is designed so
that it will take up no CPU cycles on your machine when interactive users or
other important processes are active.  If preferred, participants can
accumulate the results locally and ftp them to the central site manually.
However, the program does require rather a lot of active virtual memory -- at
least 6.5 megabytes and the more you have the faster it runs.  That said, it
runs happily on any Unix box with at least 8Mb of physical memory.  It is
currently running on Suns (SunOS and Solaris), DEC (MIPS and Alpha), HP-UX,
Linux, NetBSD, 386BSD, FreeBSD, and RS6000 machines.

The project currently has around 500 workstations which are busy sieving.
However, to finish in a reasonable amount of time, this count needs to
increase greatly.  We are attempting to enroll around 10,000 workstations in
this project.  We estimate that we are over 14% of the way to completion at
this time.

This is a call for participants, who have workstations or MasPars at their
disposal and would like to participate in this project.  All contributions
help a great deal.

There is a $100 prize associated with factoring this number.  The prize, if we
win it, will be donated to the GNU project of the Free Software Foundation to
help generate more of the excellent software they currently provide.


SOURCE CODE and ID INFORMATION
==============================


Source code can be obtained by FTP (or using a FTP to mail gateway) from
        toxicwaste.mit.edu as /pub/rsa129/MPQS.shar.Z
        black.ox.ac.uk as /math/rsa129/MPQS.shar.Z

Be sure to get the 1.4 version, or a later one.

To unpack it (on a Unix system) do:
        uncompress MPQS.shar.Z
        sh MPQS.shar

It will unpack several files, one of which is called ``README'', which should
be consulted for building instructions, information on how to obtain a set of
IDs, and input files for this project.

   Linux evolved from a very loosely knit group of developers into a stable

   if you will.  And by God, it works!

Hmm, I agree with the sentiment, but "socialist OS"?  Hardly.  Of course,
I've never been one to equate "good" and "socialist", but I think that
if Linux was really a socialist OS, then it would have been built by
a central committee that would decide what had to be in it and what
could not be in it, what the limit on a person's number of installed
copies was, and so on.

Well, maybe this isn't totally true about socialism, but if the
impending US/Clinton Health Care Plan is any guide (price controls,
likely totalitarian aspects like forcing health care workers to work
in certain areas, and so on), it's a good guess, perhaps.

Just because we all get to participate, to the degree we're competent
and willing, in the creation and improvement of a thing doesn't mean
that "socialistic" is the right word to use to describe that situation.
In fact, viewing competency and willingness as "capital", as it
generally is in this area of the galaxy, it is more aptly described
as "capitalistic" -- people with one kind of capital make use of it
to increase not only their own capital (in other forms, such as "a
version of Linux I can use and love") but the capital of others at
the same time (since most everyone who wants it can access it).

This isn't worth a flame war, because the same kind of discussions
pop up on various GNU-related mailing lists quite frequently.  Some
people, I suppose, see ideal socialism as being a society-wide
expression of what goes on with developing GNU software; and I
suppose that if I saw things that way, I'd love socialism's promise
as well.  (We tend to focus on the successes of the systems we love
and on the failures of those we don't.)

The neat thing about GNU (and the GPL), it seems, is that people
from the far left to the far right (roughly speaking) seem perfectly
happy to claim it for their own.  (And, yes, other people from
a similarly wide spectrum often, in their vitriol against GNU/GPL,
accuse it of being "from the other side".  :-)

Meanwhile, Linux marches on.  Yay.

Remember, folks, that in mass production the properties of the goods produced
follow some distribution - within specified limits. In the market we are
talking about you can expect those limits to be pretty wide, too: I'd
consider 5% off the nominal value still pretty normal.
Therefore, if you wonder about BogoMips(tm), try Norton Utilities'
SYSINFO: you'll be surprised about the differences you'll get betweeen
not only identical processor chips, but motherboards of the same brand, etc.

I won't bother you with neither BogoMips(tm) nor the SYSINFO value of my
386/40.

I must apologize for the last two sentences.  It was brought to my
attention that Vince is responsible for a great deal of development in
Linux, notably: the news/mail faq, the original posts of smail,
c-news, nn, trn and many other programs required to make a usable uucp
box under Linux.

However, while Ian should sometimes be a little more tactful, he also
does have a sensible message - I think he realizes he has no real
authority, but then again, that gives anyone the right to flame him, I
suppose.  The last posting of mine is probably more resultant from the
last flamewar over an "Ian post" where quite a few real jerks were
posting away... people who had nothing better to offer than flames.

He also seems to be the only one with guts enough to stand up to the
people who constantly waste every else's time through their own
arrogance and laziness and I respect him for that.  Then he gets
flamed for it.  The internet at work . . . what else can I say?

 Good day and sorry,

 Dan

My Dexxa (cheap Logitech) 3 button serial mouse works just fine with the
Microsoft Serial mouse drivers under X.  It works with the DOS and
MS-Windows MS Serial mouse drivers too (and I CAN use the middle button in
certain apps that use it).  There must be some sort of 3 button support in
the MS drivers.

I make sure that Emulate3Buttons is NOT in my Xconfig.

It would be kinda stupid to have to press both outside buttons if you have a
real middle button.
