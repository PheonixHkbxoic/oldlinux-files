There is another security-related bug with /proc, which can occur in
certain situations.

The files in /proc/.../fd inherit the permissions of the file being
referred to, rather than the mode of the open file descriptor.

This leads to a security hole in the following situation:

  User `fred' runs a setuid-`wizard' program, which opens a read-only
  file descriptor (5, say) onto a file bar/foo, like this:
    drwx------  wizard  magic     bar/
    -rw-rw-rw-  wizard  magic     bar/foo
  The setuid program then does setuid(getuid()) a couple of times and
  execs a shell, or a program of fred's choosing.  This is usually OK
  as the access to the file is limited by the mode of the open file,
  which can't be changed.  However fred can now go into /proc/self/fd
  and open `5' for writing, thus obliterating the contents of foo.

OK, this is rather subtle and contrived, but even though there may be
no programs running on Linux systems that do this at the moment it
seems like a bug waiting to happen.

The solution is to make the access of /proc/*/fd/* depend on the open
mode of the file descriptor.  I'm not quite sure how to implement
this, though - it seems to violate the VFS layering somewhat.


PS I changed the distribution from `gnu' back to `'.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not

I'm looking to buy a VLB SCSI card to use with Linux and need to know
which cards are currently supported. I have been told that the 
UltraStor 34F is supported. I am also told that this card is not the
best SCSI card on the market. I have heard good reports of the
Buslogic BT445S - is there a driver for this card?

If anyone knows of any other supported VLB SCSI cards or has any
comments on the UltraStor I would like to hear about it.

Please reply be email and I will summarize.

I do have Linux installed.  I cannot say that the recommendation above
is wrong, but one can occasionally have trouble when an unrecognized 
partition appears BEFORE real DOS or OS/2 partitions.  I can testify 
that if you move Linux after the OS/2 partitions and before the Boot 
Manager, the resulting configuration will work.  Furthermore, Linux 
will then be able to mount FAT volumes.

I still boot Linux using the boot diskette.  Can anyone shed light on 
installing LILO on disk in this kind of a configuration?

   I have barely begun using the gnu Calc program.  It does arbitrary precision
arithmetic, and claims to have stuff like matrix inversion and some kind of
integrals (I think both definite and indefinite), along with many other things.

  I found installing challenging.  I think I had to rename a .el

Linux, as any OS in the world, will never be finished.
It is yet stable, powerful and supports more Hardware than
OS/2 and Windows NT together.
So make the next patchlevel the version 1.0!
Or does anyone remember MS-DOS 1.0, OS/2 v1.0, Windows 1.0

The easiest solution I found was to make /proc accessible only to group proc
and setgid the process group binaries. There are several problems when you
access setuid file descriptors or file descriptors of other programs where
a user can cause serious damage. Anyway I don't see what the scum should be

Of course. But this isn't the point.  The point is that in any sort of LAN

the security of shadow passwords. But it's necessary.

So the question remains: What's the current status re: YP & linux?

   I'd take the installable flag off that partition; I'm betting that's 
   where your missing block is (although I could be all wet..wouldn't be
   the first time)

Or, you could try just doing mke2fs -c /dev/hda3
(notice no "number of blocks" specified). Sometimes mke2fs
is able to figure out a way around the above mentioned error if you
don't force it to use a specific number of blocks (it will use the
largest it can). if that doesn't work, try playing with the #blocks
term (i.e. reducing the size of the filesystem) until the message goes
away...

That's a known problem with mke2fs-0.3; e2fsprogs-0.3c is being worked
on right know and will fix the problem.  The bug is only in the mke2fs
tool, and does not affect filesystem reliability.

The trouble is that e2fs allocates inodes and blocks in groups of 8MB
each.  123060 blocks is just a little in excess of exactly 15*8MB, so
when mke2fs tries to get to the partial last block group it finds that it
isn't big enough to make an inode table on.  mke2fs-0.3c should be
able to adjust the inode table sizes so as to avoid these
difficulties.  In the mean time, try rounding the filesystem down to
the next lower multiple of 8MB:

        mke2fs -c /dev/hda3 122880

Cheers,
 Stephen.

SunWorld will "mention" Linux in next month's part-2 article
on Unix on x86. Since their primary audience is businesses
who typically would rather pay big bucks than use free software,
they probably won't give it very much of a mention. I did
tell them about ParcPlace's OB/OI offer for Linux and they
were impressed. 

Depending on next month's coverage, we may get an opportunity
to convince them to give Linux some more press and get more
developers into the act. But of course SunWorld's primary focus
is on suns. I suspect they only cover Unix on x86 because of
Solaris, but solaris is not the primary focus of the first article.

I like the last sentence in the section on solaris, in fact:

"Almost two weeks passed from the time we started installing Solaris
x86 until OpenWindows ran."

No more complaints about how hard XFree86 is to configure!!

It is not stable yet. The networking code is being under complete
overhaul, and has not stabilized as to yet. There are significant changes
in the kernel being done to facilitate new applications. The system interface
and capabilities change drastically, and binaries are not compatible. New
binary support (ELF, perhaps COFF) is expected.

I'm currently in the process of downloading the SLS distribution disks from
sunsite.unc.edu. I've downloaded the PostScript labels file, but am having
trouble printing them.

If I use ghostview, I can view the files OK, but if I print them directly
to a PostScript printer, the printer ignores the job. Looking closer at the
files, it seems that the end-of-line character is "\r" instead of "\n". 
Hence, a word cound reports that it has 0 lines.

I've tried converting the file to have "\n"'s but this simply made ghostview
report a syntax error.

Can anyone offer any assistance? Thanks.

Yeah, you just edit the /etc/lilo/config file so that boot is your Linux

the OS/2 Boot Manager Menu...(I currently have my linux boot and root as
the same partition, which is fairly standard, but not required...)

        Well, you do want users to have access to /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout, 
, etc.). /dev/stdin is a link to /proc/self/fd/0, etc (assuming you have set 
this up). It is a nifty thing to have. Granted /dev/stdin gives invalid
