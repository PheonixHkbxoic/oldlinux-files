This was fixed a long time ago, but SLS still has the older version of
the software...

You are seeing a problem which doesn't arise during normal ext2fs
operation, but which can easily result from an inconsistent state left
after a crash.  The pre-calculated free block count for your last
block group is inconsistent with the number of real free blocks.  
Unfortunately, older versions of e2fsck would not correct this problem
if it occured in the last block group of a filesystem.  The problem
may prevent allocation of new blocks to some files (those files
growing within that block group), but should not lead to data loss,
since the SLS e2fsck should still be able to correct any really
dangerous inconsistencies.

Anyway, the solution is to grab a more recent version of e2fsck.  Any
version after 0.3c should be able to correct this problem.  The latest
version always appears in /pub/linux/BETA/ext2fs on ftp.ibp.fr and
tsx-11.mit.edu.  If you have trouble compiling it, there should be a
pre-compiled binary somewhere on sunsite.unc.edu, although I can't
remember exactly where (look in the ls-lR file).

Cheers,
 Stephen.

I reversed the two route statements and I hacked them into dip some time
ago: here's a patch for dip from net-010 (yes, very old but it works for
me!). With this modified dip, SLIP and pl13 work for me without `network
unreachable errors'.

Subject: Can one installing Yggdrasil from a remote CD ?
Date: Wed, 10 Nov 1993 09:40:12 GMT

I`ve recently bought the Yggdrasil LGX (fall 1993) CD and thought
there was some way of NFS installation like SLS.

The reason is that we have a SVR4 host system with CD and a network
to which I`d like to connect my laptop and install Linux on it.

Is there any way one could modify the Yggdrasil boot floppy having
it nfs mounting <host>:/cdrom1 rather than local mounting of some
CDROM device ?

Thanks in advance for any kind of help or pointers !

Subject: LGX list of problems #1
Reply-To: iparkin@betelgeuse.bt.co.uk
Date: 10 Nov 93 13:26:57 GMT

After a week or so of collating email & net posts here is a list of the
problems currently identified in LGX F93. A list of contributors is included 
at the end of the document and thanks go to all of them.

Without further ado :-

-- START --

This is a document that attempts to list some of the problems associated
with the Yggdrasil Fall 93 CD-ROM of LGX. The list assumes that you have 
successfully managed to install the LGX onto your system and that you are 
reasonably well versed in the ways of Unix.

Please note that I have not been able to test all the suggested fixes as
my Linux machine is a stand-alone box not connected to the net and I do not 
use some of the more exotic features available - no news/mail. So all fixes
should be thought about carefully before they are implemented. If you are
in any doubt and your use of LGX is not impacted by a particular problem
then remember the phrase 'Why fix that which works ?' If you do make a major
mistake don't worry as you can simply mount your LGX CD-ROM and retrieve 
any files you may require. This last point does not imply that you can
apply the fixes blindly without thinking about them first.

Also please note that my system is based upon the complete installation which 
seems to have fewer 'undesirables' than the runtime installation.

I hope this list is useful to someone.

Any questions, corrections and comments can be directed to me via email at
'twod@socrates.demon.co.uk'.

Thanks

        Using twm as my window manager I can use asteroids from any xterm.
        Upon entering 'asteroids' I am prompted to put my mouse in the current

        see :-

        Script done, file is typescript

        i.e. the script has finished immediately. 

        Even recompiling the supplied source code does not cure this problem.

[09] : /usr/bin/chsh. I cannot change my login shell to any of the listed
        shells as they cannot be found, despite the fact that they exist. 
        Also when prompted for a numeric value, representing a shell, try 
        entering 'q'. Again compiling the source file does not help


The Kernel :-
==========

[01] : There are been various post regarding the kernel. The Yggdrasil does
        claim it to be 0.99.13 but it appears not to be judging, by the sources.
        I tried for several days to get the kernel to compile, before giving up
        and replacing the LGX kernel structure with the latest source from 
        tsx-11.mit.edu. This has enabled me to build my own kernel that is 
        smaller and loads a lot faster then the Yggdrasil kernel.

[02] : If you have an UltraStor you need to set it's port (mailbox) to 230 
        or LILO hangs.

[03] : It has been reported that /etc/lilo/install fails as lilo is not in 
        /etc. This is not the case in the complete installation.

Below are some of the points raised :

> The directory /usr/include/linux should be a symbolic link but isn't.
> Linux header files are duplicated, one set under /usr/include other
> under /usr/src/linux/include.

> The proc filesystem sources don't get installed.

> The LGX linux header files are different (and incompatible) with the
> pl13 kernel sources on sunsite.unc.edu.

> You can't rebuild the LGX kernel sources without in2000 support.

> You can't rebuild the LGX kernel sources without sound-blaster cd-rom
> support.

> The install program didn't copy some files.  Do a mkdir 
> /usr/src/linux/fs/proc and copy the files off the cdrom from the same 
> directory into the newly made directory.

> It seems that I've had to change way too many source files to get the
> thing to compile.  It's starting to smell like I've got source files
> from mixed patch levels or something like that.

> I think I'll start over with the 0.99.13 sources from sunsite.


Missing Files :-
=============

[01] : If you opt for the runtime installation the file /usr/bin/ranlib is not
        installed. This file is installed in the complete installation.

[02] : If you opt for the runtime installation not all of the X libraries in
        /usr/X386/lib are installed. They are correctly installed for the
        complete installation.

[03] :  Man pages exist for certain commands, but the commands themselves do
        not exist :- answer autoreply bpe cccp checkalias cpp1 ezview fastmail
        frm gen-index jetpack lcasep listalias mkfnames mkmanifest newalias

        [ The above is a list compiled by a few quick & dirty shell scripts,
        so may not be 100% accurate ].

[04] : Missing manual pages : zsh

[05] : The fonts installed for ghostscript-2.6.1 are from the
        ghostscript-2.5.2 package, so a number of those listed in Fontmap
        (Nimbus, URWAntiquaT, URWGroteskT) are not available.


Miscellaneous Problems :-
======================

[01] : vi does not use the cursor keys - Set ${TERM} to vt100.

[02] : The rc.local file plays some music. If there is no sound board installed
        then the PC's speaker is used. This has caused at least one machine to
        lock up. Simply comment out or delete the relevant lines in the 
        rc.local file.

[03] :  It has been reported that the ez demo scripts do not work correctly 
        unless the environmental variable ${ANDREWDIR} is set to /usr/andrew.

[04] : Both the booklet & CD-ROM both state a minimum RAM requirement of 4 MB.
        This is the minimum required for gcc, and is below the minimum of 8 MB
        that is recommended in order to run X. Although not a problem this
        could be misleading.

[05] : There is a /usr/bin/rogue.exp file but no rogue :-(.

[06] : Some manual pages are in the incorrect format or the 'man' command is
        not expecting all possible formats :-

        # man modf
        syntax error near `(d'
        -c:1: `(cd /usr/man ; /usr/bin/gtbl e (david@prism.demon.co.uk)'

        [ nroff -man ./modf.3 > /tmp/modf; mv /tmp/modf ./modf.3 ]
        
[07] : /usr/bin/robohunt expects /usr/games/fortune to exist. It doesn't. 

[08] : The user guest is gid 0 in /etc/passwd.

[09] : The version of ldd is 1.1. Xfree-2.0 requires version 1.3. So if you 
        intend to port Xfree-2.0 make sure you get ldd 1.3 as well.

Subject: HELP - Linux counter moral issue
Date: 10 Nov 1993 14:01:25 GMT

Hello,
I have a "moral" problem regarding the Linux counter.

I have had some exchanges with a particular sitemaster that
wanted to register 500 Linux users at that site.

I still haven't implemented "friend counting", so the assumption is
that each FROM address gets one vote.

Now, this sitemaster seems to have decided to do a mass registration
by sending in the whole /etc/passwd file at once using a script.
(It is QUITE plain that the votes were script-generated, but all the
FROM addresses are different)

This will have the interesting effect of sending this country to
the head of the class where Linux usage is concerned - FAR ahead
of everybody else.

Now, I can do several things:

- Ignore it, and let the votes be counted
- Delete all votes from this site, keeping the statistics as they are,
  but not gathering the information
- Recommending that other Linux admins do a "mass registration" of their
  users, ensuring a certain "evenness" to the count.

What does the readership of c.o.l.misc think I should do?

BTW, the current count (including perhaps half the 500 users) is now
about 3.700 users.
