My problem with the `curses' library in Linux is that it makes me do
said.  It's not only limited, it's broken.  There are three things I
can do:

1. find the source to curses somewhere and try to fix it.

2. change all programs I port over to use ncurses.  (This I have been
doing, but it's a real pain sometimes.)

3. mv /usr/lib/curses.a /usr/lib/ocurses.a; mv /usr/lib/ncurses.a \
/usr/lib/curses.a; mv /usr/include/curses.h /usr/inc... etc.

Is 3 a bad idea?

I have 2 linux boxes in our ethernet and use Slackware (1.0.4).
Both runs gopher server, chatmud and anonymous ftp.
One box is a backup/mirror of the other.
I have not put any add on programs to make it more secure,

yes, and the installation script from Slackware is much better
compared to SLS (1.03) if you plan to put the box the net.
If you just want to use the box as stand alone or connected via
slip, both distributions are good.

Subject: [suggestion] ncurses extension for curses library
From: eekim@husc8.harvard.edu (Eugene Kim)
Date: 19 Oct 1993 20:52:53 GMT

I enjoy using ncurses to write software; it's a lot more versatile than
the curses library.  On the other hand, it decreases the portability somewhat
because many people (especially those without Linux systems) do not have
the ncurses library.

How feasible would it be to put out source that extends the curses library
to cover some basic commands that ncurses has, such as keybd() and attr_on()?
One could include the source for this with software distributions, and people
can compile using curses and get the same functionality as ncurses.

You obviously didn't follow the thread: This is a loop of only two machine
instructions, so disk drives or other peripherals absolutely don't matter!
Even memory size is irrelevant, only CPU model and clock, whether there's
cache on the CPU or else outside and only if you have no cache at all, then
memory speed (wait states) is significant.

Do you really worry about 4% difference?

Well, it works if you include a dot ('.'), which stands for current line...
        :123,. s/tic/tac/g
But I do agree, I think elvis should do a little better job at emulating 
the "real" vi (whatever that is).  Which means that the example without the

Yeah, well, and I had some real problems with vim as well.  It wouldn't be
so bad, but I couldn't get some of the "extensions" to be turned off by 
using a /etc/exrc file, such as writing backup files (despite me telling it
not to write them in the first place).  Vim is better in some respects, but
it is much worse in other respects.

I have heard of xvi, but does anybody know about that one?

Subject: RSA129 project passes 1 million mark
Date: 20 Oct 93 19:04:44


One million and counting....

The RSA-129 project has just passed the one million relations mark.

As of 5am UT, Wednesday 20 October 1993, hot-spare.mit.edu had
received 1030805 relations.  These are distributed as follows:

      14263 full relations (fuls)
     182353 partial relations (pars)
     834189 double partial relations (pprs).

The full relations are usable as they stand.  The pars and pprs have
to be further processed to find cycles.  So far, we have 1679 cycles.

When the sum of the fulls and the cycles reach 524400 we are almost
done.  A few hours work on a workstation, followed by some heavy
crunching on a MasPar and we will know the Ultimate Answer (and I will
be most upset if it turns out to be 42 :-)

The number of cycles might seem to be disappointingly small.  However,
the number of cycles per par and per ppr grows quadratically with the
number of relations collected.  We had fewer than 100 cycles in from
the first 250k relations; we now have 20 times as many cycles from
only four times as many relations.

Because we still have relatively few cycles, it is difficult to give
an accurate estimate of how much further we have to go.  However, I
can give a guestimate which won't be too far out.  We know from
previous large-scale runs of MPQS, that the final total consists of
about 20% fulls and 80% cycles.  As we need something over half a
million altogether, we can divide the number of cycles by one
thousand, and call that the percentage completion.  Accordingly, my
best estimate is that we are about 14% done.

As more machines come on-stream, we are collecting more and more
relations per day.  During October, we have averaged 24247 relations
per day, with a peak of 31162 last Sunday.  Machines tend to be more
idle at the weekend; this shows up quite clearly in our statistics.
It is difficult to determine exactly how many machines are
contributing; certainly many hundreds.  Even more would be nice, of
course!  What I can say is that we have allocated over 9000 UIDs so far.

The following is also very rough and ready.  My DEC 5000/25 generates
one relation per 1100 seconds on average, and is rated at 15MIPS or
so.  Therefore, 24000 relations per day corresponds to an *average*
compute power of 4600MIPS.  That's a powerful supercomputer by most
people's standards.  Almost all of this computation comes from machine
time that would otherwise go to waste.


So, a big thank you to everyone who has contributed to the project so
far.  Your help is much appreciated.  Anyone reading this who has not
joined in yet, is invited to send email to rsa129-info@iastate for
more information.  All you need is a Unix box with at least 8Mb of
memory, some idle cputime, and a desire to join in the largest single
computation currently taking place anywhere on the Internet.

No, I've used real science (TM) to prove that he's one person:
Using the techniques of counting word patterns to identify author's
that was pioneered in proving that Bacon wrote Shakespeare (or Shakespeare
wrote Bacon or whatever - anyway, that's beside the point) on the kernel
sources, some distinct patterns emerge:
The author uses as many '{' characters as he does '}'.
The same applies for '(' and ')'.
And even for the more arcane '/*' and '*/'.
He is inoridnately fond of punctuating with semicolons.
He is overly smitten with some of his early works and misses no 
opportunity to remind us of them, by including them in his later
derivative works.
His character development is somewhat weak - some good ideas - the
mysterious persons (deities perhaps?) known only as the 'swapper' and
the 'scheduler' suggest an attempt to inject some mysticism into a
deterministic world-view.
Plots tend towards the mind-numbingly complex.
The dialogue puts even James Joyce to shame - I find it almost impossible
to find who is meant to be speaking the quoted sections - they are all
attributed to the unseen 'printk'.
He seems to prefer a style in which multiple story lines - referred to
somewhat obsucrely as processes) are interwoven and progress concurrently.

So we can conclude that one anal-retentive personna with a seriously
disturbed concept of modern life wrote every line of the kernel source,
probably gcc, X-windows etc. as well.
