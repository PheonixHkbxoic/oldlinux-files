        The percentage of people who know about the GNU project and its 
goals may be small (and I think it's a larger percentange than you might
think, if we're only talking about the unix world here) but it's certainly
vocal.  I think there'd be a _lot_ of outcry in the unix trade rags if
some company did something like this.

        I got an BusLogic SCSI card and installed it on my machine. 
The model number is : BT542B. However, Linux system can not recognize it even 
my kernel has a SCSI support. Does anyone know about this card and 
where I can get info? Also does Linux have a driver for it?

Writing the driver would be pretty trivial.  Writing the PARSER for the
SVPMI file would be a pain in the butt, but not too bad.

GETTING SVPMI files would be damned near impossible, as the vendors
don't seem to be inclined to provide them, that I've ever seen, anyhow.

That is exactly what happens! SLS apparently doesn't include terminfos
for vt100 or xterm. Not its fault really as the older distribution of
ncurses only had console.

The most uptodate version on ncurses is always on netcom.com:pub/zmbenhal

Hello all,

My e-mail address, formerly mdw@tc.cornell.edu, is changing to

Why do you care? Unfortunately, it appears as though my old address

the address mdw@tc.cornell.edu (be it in a version of the Linux FAQ,
LDP manuals, whatever), please make an attempt to change this address
to mdw@sunsite.unc.edu. I'm hoping that this can be a semi-permenent

      I have no great love for Microsoft, but let's be serious here.  Look at
   the PC's that people use.  What OS do they run?  MS-DOS.  What environment?
   Windows.  What applications?  Excel.  Word.

[...stuff deleted...]

      As for Microsoft wanting the lion's share of the market, guess what
   folks?  It's a for-profit company.  They exist solely to make money.
   What's the best way to make money?  Kill your competition, *especially* if
   they have a better product.  Even if they don't.  What exactly does
   morality have to do with this?  Saying that they are 'evil' is basically
   saying that people shouldn't strive to be successful.  Gee, maybe we all
   should spend the rest of our lives flipping burgers for each other.  But
   make sure that we avoid trying to provide a decent standard of living for
   our families.

Oh, so you don't have a problem with *killing* a competitor if they get 
in the way...I guess that means if I was winning in a foot race, you wouldn't
have a problem with taking out a gun and shooting me...If corporations are
legally a seperate entity, then just as individuals have a set of morals,
so should corporations. There is a world of difference between beating
a competitor with a superior product, or getting the product to market faster,
and engaging in illegal practices to prevent others from competing. Microsoft
does not want to engage in *fair* competition because it knows in most cases
it would lose. Perhaps your attitude is one of the problems with
Corporate America, a total lack of morals and ethics...

    I'd also be curious to see how many people would have tried to
install linux if there had been no SLS. Somehow, with a majority of
linux SLS installations being from downloaded free SLS packages, I'd
doubt Peter is planning to quit his day job any time soon.

I disagree. I am one of those who "likes to hack .." and spend much of my
spare time pulling Linux apart and putting it back together. However, every
now and then I have a real requirement for Slured for Windoze (or equiv). A
good example happened on Tuesday this week when I had to dash off a quick
CV modification and application form to meet a deadline for an internal
promotion opportunity. I don't know TeX, I don't need to know *roff; I have
a 40Meg DROS/Windows partition on my 486 that gets used by my family and by
me for quick, easy to compose, formal documents .... and Links386 :-)

So, even as a Linux fan, I do have a genuine interest in running non-linux 
software, am I in a minority? I don't think so.

Date: Fri, 27 Aug 1993 00:11:41 GMT

I was playing with a scsi 4mm tape drive.  I did a    tar cvf /dev/rmt0 *
and watched the files fly.

I then tried a   tar t /dev/rmt0    Thinking I would get a listing.

No go.  I tried various other combinations thinking I had the parameters 
wrong.  Still no go.


I then tried  tar xvf /dev/rmt0 into another directory to see if the files 
would come back.  Yes, they did come back ok!


ummm.....  So I try just  tar.  It says  'tar +help'  for options.  
I try  tar +help  and I get an error screen.


ummm....  Maybe my SLS1.03 tar is broken.  SO I boot from a1.3 and try to 
tar from there.    tar +help works ok.  Great I think!  I mount the hardrive 
and move the file over.  

I then reboot bringing up the system as normal and try   tar +help again.
No go!?




So...  Has anyone else seen odd things with tar?

I would like to have a tape that is my crash insurance.  If the box goes

Should I use  tar or cpio for this type of stuff?  Does it matter?


User ROOT in the root directory can do    tar cvf /dev/rmt0

I can't remember cpio off the top of my head.  I am not sure if both would 
give me everything...  ie: empty directories, zero-length files, links and 
not 2 separate files, etc...

        Why not indeed! Do you represent some Linux developmental group?
        
        The idea of CONTRIBUTING something to the computer community
        is a referrence to contribution of talent. 
        Contribution of $$ is for the commercial distribution of a useful
        product.
         In this effort a large part of the product is the *education* it
        offers to all.
        Am I nuts or what?

This is the summary of replies I have so far regarding my proposal for a
Linux Hardware Device Qualification Program. There should be enough food for
thought here, thus it's OK to post followup articles now.

From: Michael Kenney <kenney@u.washington.edu>
 How many board makers will be interested, I think Linux needs to develop
 more of a "presence" outside of Usenet first ... maybe a series of
 articles in Dr Dobbs :-).
 
 Your first category would probably be easy for most manufacturers to
 meet ... most seem to publish their specs.  As for the higher categories,
 that may take some time.

From: bsa@kf8nh.wariat.org (Brandon S. Allbery)
 But is there *enough* interest?  Let's face it:  Microsloth has a *lot* of
 clout, so they can pull off the Windows labeling bit.  We're a bit smaller
 than that as yet.
 
 Another important question is:  who operates it, and how?  A central registry
 would be a good idea in this case, and maintaining that registry, responding
 to information requests (often by snailmail sending documentation, device
 driver writing guides, etc.) will require time and undoubtedly money (postage,
 if nothing else).  Who does this, and will they absorb the cost, make it up
 from donations (from who?), or be paid (by who?)?

From: bruce@Pixar.com (Bruce Perens)
 [in reply to Brandon's message above]
 Yes, we're not Microsoft, but there's no sign of any slowdown in the
 growth of our user community. Some time soon it might actually become
 embarassing for a manufacturer to admit "It's not Linux-Compatible".
 
 Regarding the administration, I was hoping to make it self-running.
 The manufacturers would qualify themselves using the "honor system"
 without requiring a document exchange. There would invariably be
 someone who lied about compatibility, but they would look bad enough
 when caught in the lie that this would not be widespread. It might
 be a good idea to require them to send anyone who asks a copy of
 their "qualification form", containing their statement of how they
 meet the requirement.
 
 The requirements document and PostScript version of the logo would be
 widely distributed, and if someone couldn't find them on the net I'd be
 happy to send out copies if sent a S.A.S.E. I'm sure there are other
 people who would volunteer to do the same thing.
 
 Yes, it would be nice if there were a centrally-maintained list of
 qualified hardware. Perhaps someone will volunteer to maintain that.

From: "Brandon S. Allbery" <bsa@kf8nh.wariat.org>
 [in reply to Bruce's message above]
 I suspect beaurocracy at the various companies will require paperwork. 
 Especially in the way of (a) official certification documents and (b)
 official kernel programming documentation.
 
 As for the honor system:  the problem is likely to be that some companies
 will be worried about not being protected from lawsuits by some official
 "instrument of qualification" --- regardless of whether the risk exists or
 not (recall IBM's decision not to bundle GNU Emacs with AIX several years
 ago).  Why would they worry?  Because of the fear that some twit might
 misinstall their Linux driver, get their hard disk scrambled in a panic(),
 and sue on the grounds that it shouldn't have happened because they were
 qualified as Linux-ready or whatever but their driver "didn't work". 
 Companies take these sort of things seriously:  even when the claim is easy
 to prove specious and it's possible to countersue, court cases take time and
 money that most companies would prefer to avoid.

 the GPL lets you distribute binaries without source if you include
 directions to get the source, i think we might let them get away with that.

From: charles@aramis.comm.polymtl.ca (Charles Levert)
 One crucial difference between Linux and MS-Windows is that nobody has
 the money to fight a copyright violation.  A publicly available list
 of hardware that qualifies (w/ level) should therefore be available on
 the net, and users should be warned of any known copyright violation
 as an appendix to that list.  This is most probably our best weapon
 against copyright violators.
 
 Aside from this eventuality of copyright violations, I think your idea
 is excellent and should be pursued.  I am currently shopping for a new
 system (to run Linux almost exclusively) and my biggest fear is buying
 some piece of hardware that can't be made to work with Linux.

 The Linux Hardware Device Qualification Program sounds great, even if it
 also sounds a bit unrealistic.  That _should_ not be a hinderence, IMHO.
 
 It seems that one of the most interesting hardware device (a "system") 
 is not too obviously included in the program?
 
 Has your thinking gone so far as to outline the steps necessary to put
 the program into effect?

From: bill@goshawk.lanl.gov (Bill Reynolds)
 Nice idea. Who bells the cat? That is, who will coordinate the
 awarding of said certification and enforce the requirement that only
 linux-{compatible,etc} manufacturers can advertise themselves as such.
 Net hearsay will get you a long way, but some permanent, commited
 people would have to be involved, look at the difficulty in getting a
 list of compatabile hardware from the *user* community, who are
 presumably much more involved in linux than a manufacturer would be.

 I think it's a great idea!  That is, I like it a lot.
 
 However, think of this from the perspective of the manufacturer.  If
 they enclose a driver, they must "support" the driver, usually implicidly.
 If driver XXX doesn't work with machine YYY, they have to pay some guy
 big bucks to go fix it.  Well, they don't have to, but...
 
 And then there's maintainance.  Linux, as you know, has gone from C to
 C++, requiring some changes in quite a bit of code.  Imagine if some other
 kernel primative were changed, requiring alteration of driver code....
 
 In short, I would hope that manufacturers would give an "honest and
 reasonable" attempt at it, with sufficient disclamers to keep them
 from having them to expand their support team...

From: Rick Miller <rick@ee.uwm.edu>
 Man, you're dreaming.

Those are the replies I have so far. At this time I'd like to step aside for
a few days and allow others to post argument to the questions posed above
and/or post on how _they_ would implement this program. After that, I'll
jump back in and attempt to build a consensus.

        Thanks
