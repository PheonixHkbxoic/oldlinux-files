I am trying to get SLIP working on my linux pl12.  Im using the NET-2 and DIP
that came with the SLS distribution.  I can ping the machine, and can even 
connect to it.  The problem is, right after I login into the remote host and
do anything to generate tty output (like an ls), I get a lot of "Datagram
Fragmentation not yet implemented" errors.  What version of NET-2 has this
feature implemented, and where can I get it?  Or is there some configuration
I can do to fix this?
Thanks

Thanks for these really amusing posts - there has been an overflow problem
recently in TERM - the new version fixes the problem - look for term108 on
an archive site nearby.

In "Service without Servers" by Chris Maeda and Brian Bershad of CMU
they report on  a "... new style of os arch. appropriate for microkernel-based
operating systems: services are implemented as combination of shared 
libraries and dedicated server processes." Later the paper goes on
to quote the following perf. numbers. I wonder how two 486-DX2/66 on 
isolated net measures today? Can Don Becker or someone measure this?

Again quoting from Maeda and Bershad paper:

"The performance of our system is comparable to native in-kernel 
implementations. Between two DEC-station 5000-200's running in
single-user mode on a private Ethernet, the roundtrip latency for
1 byte UDP messages is 1.50 ms for our system and 1.45 for the 
Mach 2.5 integrated kernel. Roundtrip latency for 1 byte TCP 
messages is 1.40 in Mach 2.5 and 1.75 ms in out system. For TCP
throughput, the Mach 2.5 kernel achieves 1070 kb/sec while our
system achieves 995 kb/sec."

Above quoted without permission. (Hopefully I didn't break any law.)

Was the system swapping when you compiled it on the 386?  If so, that would
probably account for a lot of the difference.

Hello, gentleman.

If you watch out the comp.sys...hardware or some other news group, you
will probably give up. I also thought of buying their computer;however,
many netters' complaints made me forget it. Absoultely, I don't remember
exactly what they said. (But, you can find it by using "/,""royal," or
"zenon.") 

Memory, power supply, video card, etc. were main complaints. Especially,
monitor was too bad. Further, technical service is near to zero. No
responding, no calling back  at all. I remember he appealed a kind of
Federal Beauraue to get back his money. (Oh, you can find one vote for
Royal.)

Rather than, I would think Comtrade. They are notorious for bad customer
service, too. But, at least, I heard that the components were well
assembled. Or others? like Micron, Gateway, or somewhere else.

I'm also thinking of having a new machine on which I can use Linux. But,
I am such a novice that I couldn't decide where to go. I just heard, while
not totally undestanding, that Gateway2K's Eisa system is not compatible
with Linux. (because of the motherboard made by Micornics?--639K for Dos
memory....something like that...) Also, Diamond's card is not supported by
Linux because of their BAD business, I heard.

        I have just such a BBS style shell, written in Perl. It's
written on a Xenix system but the port to  linux  would  be  very
minor.  It does require Perl with sysV IPC though, and I've found
the  Perl as distributed with linux has that feature broken. I've
also found that once Perl is recompiled the IPC  begins  to  work
and in that case the only porting  needed  would  be  for  shadow
passwords. I have heard that linux will  run  with  passwords  in
/etc/passwd  if  it  has  to,  in  which  case  there  would   be
practically no porting needed to get it working.

        The BBS shell is not totally complete (well  it's  mainly
the sysadmin utility which is not complete) but it is functional,
I  could  easily  let  it out as a pre distribution version and I
would welcome anyone to port it to linux or any other os and send
me the diffs.  Perhaps sockets would be better for IPC  than  the
IPC  and  I'd welcome anyone to port a socket version, I can't do
it myself as I don't have sockets.

        The  BBS  creates separate user accounts for users so the
security  is  good.  It's  menus  can  be set up by means of menu
scripts and menu templates which define layout  and  may  contain
ANSI graphics. It is fully reconfigurable.

Yes there is a patch for this, (included at the end of this posting).
This patch workes fine on my WD90C30 anyway.

There is another fast workarond if you don't have the link kit and
can't apply the patch.

You may take the clocks line as it was reported in XFree86 1.3 and
add it to your XFree86 2.0 Xconfig since it's only the clock probe
that is broken in XFree86 2.0.

Date: Mon, 8 Nov 1993 13:12:50 GMT

I too had a problem with the Paradise windows accelerator card (WD90C31 based).
For some reason the clock sensing of Xfree86 2.0 (and the earlier 1.2) yields
differing results with each try.  Until I put a "clocks" statement in my
Xconfig file I could not stop the X-server and have a usable display, nor
could I console switch to a non-windows display.  After several trials I
chose the following clocks (I only use the 25,36 and 45 ones so no guarantee
on the others):

   Clocks 25.2 28.2 65.0 36.0 0 0 0 0 44.9

After doing that all the problems went away.  (I also removed the server
shutdown/restart in xdm-config which seems not to be needed now). Does anyone
know the assignments of the other clocks (i.e. the ones marked 0 above) or if I
guessed at any of the ones I don't use incorrectly?  The assignments don't seem
to be available anywhere (a call and a letter to WD got no response either).

From what little I have seen of the Hurd, it IS better than Unix.  A lot
of what needs to be done "manually" in Unix (ftp, archie, etc) can be
done automagically in the Hurd.  This just scratches the surface. 

Until the Hurd is done (1-2 years IMHO), I will, however, GLADLY use
Linux.  Daily!
