I'd really like some 'horse's mouth' comments from people who 
have tried using Linux as a platform for a BBS.  I know there
are a couple of packages available (XBBS etc) - which do you
use and what are your comments ?

In theory, of course, Linux should make an excellent platform.
But in all honesty, in practice would it be better to use a well
established dos package at the moment ?  Why, or why not ?

I think I've traced all the FAQ's on the subject, but I'd really
like to hear from working sysops on this and will summarise here
if there's a good response.

Thanks all.

   Better, move this line earlier in the file and precede it with the command:

     makehole $TMP/mnt/lib/libc.so.4

   This will save you about 300k, so you  can copy gzip, tar, ... instead of
   making links to it.   Afterall, if you want the disk to be useful for install-
   ation and crash recovery, you  have to consider the case when nothing is 
   available on the harddrive.

Pardon - my script *does* copy gzip and tar! The only links that it
puts in place are either within the floppy or those required to run
emacs (I'd like to see you get that on a floppy ;-) ).

I guess I assumed that cp did not un-makehole the file. Perhaps
someone could explain to me what makehole does as clearly my
understanding is wrong.

Heeeyyyy, I might bite here. Is anyone working on a magazine? I put together
a small venture back in the early part of this year producing a C magazine
but it had to fold when I crashed my car.  ($$$) 8-( . However, - perhaps 
this is a good next venture. It would be no sweat to rejig my page-makeup
designs to accomodate a new magazine. 

Caveat: I am not a TeX user, (Yeeurrch), preferring the likes of AMI PRO
over it. (Sorry, yup, I use Messy DOS and WinDoZE for DTP). Sooo, such a mag
would be distributable in printable formats only, (PS, HP, Dot Matrix?).

If there's enough interest, I *might* be able to make a proper commercial 
venture out of it and put it in a "glossy" format for folks to buy. (BTW, 
the previous magazine I put together was sold at virtually no profit to 
myself, - the idea was that the cover price would pay for the production, 
mailing and sundry costs and hence be self financing. I'm thinking along 
the same lines for a LINUX mag. [ though I wouldn't *discount* profit... 8-) ] )

What does the community think?

WINE maybe, but I'm not so sure about DOSEMU. I was a DOS junkie for ages, and

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

I should have done so last time this came up - my apologies to
everyone.  The next issue of the FAQ will include this:


\question 03oct  What is a BogoMip ?

`BogoMips' is a contraction of `Bogus MIPS'.  MIPS stands for
(depending who you listen to) Millions of Instructions per Second, or
Meaningless Indication of Processor Speed.

The number printed at boot-time is the result of a kernel delay-loop
calculation - Use the Force, Read the Source for more details.  It is
\it{very\} approximately related to the speed of the CPU in MHz,
however it is absolutely useless as a benchmark for comparing
machines.

Don't be surprised if you see a different number to what you were
expecting.  Most especially please do not post about it to
\courier{comp.os.linux.*\} !


Comments are welcomed, of course, as they are on any aspect of the FAQ.

I regularly read about the SLS 1.03. The FAQ advises to stay clear of

I installed the SLS 1.03. a week or so ago. I had little difficulties,

So, I'm interested: what are the bugs in SLS1.03??

[some features]

Well, here's another one:
MeetingRooms, available on ftp.uni-paderborn.de in /pub/unix/games.
It also features most described features.

It does need a client program, but therefore it features really nice

What's the difference between static or shared for a 1-hour-number-cruncher

may be the computing loop even executes completely out of CPU cache.
Or do I have missed the point?

By my very limited understanding of PCNFS requires a pcnfsd server on the
Unix side of things so that a DOS PCNFS client can operate properly when
attached. This server is publicly distributable.

Is this right?

Subject: PPP for Linux? Well... almost as good
Reply-To: teffta@cs690-3.erie.ge.com
Date: Wed, 6 Oct 1993 12:42:10 GMT

About once a week on average someone asks if there is PPP for Linux.
Nobody ever answers so the general consensus is no -- it seems that
everyone with the capability to produce PPP is satisfied with SLIP.

We run MorningStar PPP on our suns. I have just found out that this
implementation can also do SLIP. 

First, some info on SLIP vs. PPP. This may be slanted towards PPP
since it came from MorningStar's PPP manual. And probably all the SLIP
limitations are limitations based on MorningStar's implementation.

"SLIP is really only a framing convention for arranging IP packets on
a link, and it provides few of PPP's advanced facilities.... SLIP does
not support the Asynchronous Control Character Map feature or the
escape option, and therefore can only be used over connections that are
[ completely 8-bit clean ]...."

The GOOD news is that this SLIP implementation DOES have the
autodialing, idle line hangup, packet filtering, and other useful
management facilities. But more bad news may be that the on-demand
dialing feature really isn't useful unless your Linux box runs a slip
*server* (is such a thing available?), since the "other end" running
MorningStar PPP would have to make the connection to your Linux box.

So, the point is, for all you PPP people out there, check with whoever
you want to connect to, they may be able to give you slip access with
their current PPP server (whether they are willing to is another matter). 
I am going to try to set this up for myself this week.
