As a continuation on this subject does anybody know of a card
that implements a localtalk interface for PC.
I would like to talk to my Laserwriter at 230Kb/s.

Does there exist a appletalk printerdriver for DOS?

Reply-To: behrend@ph1.Uni-Koeln.DE

Is somewhere an implementation of TRACEROUTE available which
is working under Linux?

Traceroute is a utility which traces the network route 
that packets take when they are sent to another Internet host
and thus very useful for network debugging. It is available
on the net (e.g. from 139.165.32.13 in /pub/unix);
the difficulty is that a Kernel modification has to be
written what has perhaps already done someone?

Thanks in advance.

I've got major problems with the sound driverfor the ultrasound.  I've had
the sound patches compiled into the kernel but I get compiler errors in
souncard.h.  I have problems with line 152. it says there is an invalid
charachter in that line.  it says that the ascii code for \ is on that
line,and we can't find a / in or near that line in soundcard.h.  

I don't always get the error with soundcard.h either. Some programs( kernel
patch, etc) compile just fine.  Os I think the error is somewhere outside of
soundcard.hand the error is a side-effect of something else. 

Problem seems to crop up while compiling adagio  - or whatever. 

Any ideas?

Reply-To: frank@e-technik.tu-ilmenau.de

I have no vantage but ATI graphics ultra plus with inport mouse. You can try this:


1. Look for busmouse.h in /usr/src/linux/include/linux
   There is a line #define MOUSE_IRQ 5.
   If your mouse is on IRQ 2 you must change this.
2. Rebuild the Kernel if necessary.
   Change to /usr/src/linux, make config, make dep, make clean,
   make, make zImage, make zdisk.
   Answer the Questions for the Logitech-Mouse support yes.
3. Reboot, while booting a message "Logitech Bus mouse detected and installed"
   appears.
4. Change to /dev . Check if there exists a device called bmouselogitec!
   I hope it is!
5. Edit Xconfig in /usr/X386/lib/X11
   The mouse-line is:  MouseSystems   "/dev/bmouselogitec"


I recommend you to begin with point 5, only if it doesn't work immediately
try step by step from the beginning.
The easiest way is to change the mouse IRQ to IRQ 5 and insert the mouse-line in Xconfig. So you can save recompiling the kernel! The kernel is compiled with IRQ 5 for busmouse by default.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

Try the formula:

   sysinstall -instdev = /dev/fd0 -disk    # or
   sysinstall -instdev = /dev/fd0 -install <package name>

It will untar using your current directory as the root or the one you

In general, if there is no TFM to read, try the help info:

This not the "feature" of S3, but this is the "feature" of all IBM 8514

and breaks their own standard for PC systems.

Subject: [SUMMAY] Which file system do you use?
Date: Fri, 26 Nov 1993 16:23:30 GMT

Well, I only got 7 responses. Pretty lame, guys. I thought there might be a
bit more response than that. As you will see, it's not terribly informative. I
guess you'll just have to make up your own mind. Anyway, here's what was said:

---
Ext2: Long filenames, large filesystems, feels both reliable and evolving.
---
Ext2: allows more than 15 chars for a name, unlike minix
---
ext2 : overly complicated, and hogs extra disk space
minix : Very nice, but can't support more than 64MB per partition or 
        32 letters per filename.
xia : haven't found working mkfs.xia or fsck.xia tools.  
---
xia: recommended by Xia in the first docs I read when I first got pl7a from
     some random location and it works fine (through pl13) and it would be
     real painful to change.
---
ext2: been using Linux since 0.99pl6 and have always used ext2. From
      experience, ext2 is very robust even with respect to hardware failures.
---
ext2: No difficulties encountered on 0.99pl9-1.
---
ext2: default on installation. No problems but I wonder if xiafs is faster
---

My experience has been a severe number of problems with ext2 since linux
0.99pl10 (ext2 0.3 and up). No problems with xia up to 0.99pl12, but same type
of problems as for ext2 with 0.99pl13.

No one has mentioned this yet (I'm not sure very many people know
about it) but you can use GNU PIC to generate TeX output.  You can
even view it in xdvi! Other people have mentioned stuff like mfpic,
but that has the undesirable property of having to specify absolute
coordinates for everything.  (This may have changed recently, I
haven't looked in a little while).  In PIC you can specify relative
coordinates (such as the south side of the last circle).  I have
found it very easy to use.

For instance, a simple flowchart (out of the manual) that describes
the data flow through PIC and troff is:

PS
ellipse "document"
arrow
box "PIC"
arrow
box "TBL/EQN "(Optional)" dashed
arrow
box "TROFF"
arrow
ellipse "typesetter"
PE

Two annoying things about PIC:

   It will not automatically size the boxes to the text.

   It will not rotate things.  So, for instance, in your flowcharts
   a diamond will have to be drawn as four lines.  Not a biggie, but
   it is a small hindrance.  A macro can be used to simplify it.
   Unless you output Postscript, rotation is generally a difficult
   thing to do.


The PIC manual can be received by mailing to netlib@research.att.com
with "send 116 from research/cstr" in the body.  It will send a
postscript file.

Subject: Are two swap partitions on two disks better (faster) than one?
Date: Fri, 26 Nov 1993 16:09:14 GMT
Reply-To: ernestl@bnr.ca

On some un*x systems if there are multiple swap partitions on different
disks, swap is allocated on all partitions at the same time (i.e. one 
partition is not filled up before the OS starts swapping to the second 
partition.

The question I have is this. On linux is it better to have swap partitions
on two disks than just having it on one disk? For example would it be
better to have two 10MB partitions os opposed to one 20MB partition or does 
it ammount to the same thing? If there are multiple partitions does linux
use the fastest one first and then the next best one or are they used in the
order that they're swapon'ed?

If anyone can shed some light on this please send email or post. 

Thanks,

Ernest.
