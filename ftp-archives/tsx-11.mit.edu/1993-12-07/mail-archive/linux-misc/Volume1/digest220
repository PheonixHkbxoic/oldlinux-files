Hello, world;

I've just uploaded at 2.3 to sunsite.unc.edu and tsx-11.mit.edu.
It's Yet Another Bugfix release; this time, it fixes the -f option which
was broken in 2.2, and also makes sure that environment variables are
actually exported.

I have seen several of these tape drives for sale and understand
they work with Linux.  Right now I'm running Linux (Slackware
0.99.pl13) using a Future Domain 1670 for a Seagate ST296N and
NEC CDR-36 CDROM with no problems at all.

If you are using a TANDBERG 3600 Tape Drive & Linux how about
dropping me some mail on your experiences?  Would this be your
first choice for a <$200 tape drive?  Any problems?  

Thanks and appreciate your input.

The country list is by no means correct. It takes the uucp From line and
not the From: or Sender: line. It is very nice of kudu.ru.ac.ZA to
forward my mail (and for free!) but I am located in NA (a registered if

ru.ac.ZA forwards for several countries in SADECC and they will all be

   That's a pretty good summary, except for these things (assume an "as far as
   I know" in front of each, because I may have missed the answers to these):

   (1) Nintendo vs. Galoob is the case that really blows a hole in the FSF
   argument.  I don't think they've answered this one.

   (2) I don't think they've posted an answer to the Sega vs. Accolade
   case, either.

   (3) It seems that in many arguments, they treat "derivative work" as
   English, rather than as a legal term of art.  This leads to misconclusions.

There's also --- ``So how is this different from an Interface
Copyright?''  Ans: We're the FSF, and we'd never do something that evil.
But you're still not allowed to distribute proprietary source code that
makes calls to the GNU mp library.

I'd never thought I'd saw the day when the FSF would be trying to
enforce an interface copyright, but it just goes to show you that if you
wait long enough, anything can happen......

There are two quite different cases:  When the GPL'd code is the only
implementation any "proprietary" code must have been developed with
the aid of GPL'd code.  This is not true when the GPL'd code is just
one of several implementations with the same interface.

And more to the point, you avoid getting wrong answers in response.

[ large section stating that most people don't care "why", they only care
  "how" - those that do care "why" are computer people :-) ]

Most of the help I give to Linux development is "behind the scenes".  I
develop very small amounts of codes, am not a large poster of answers etc.
Instead I mail responses, and try to give detailed (overly detailed?) 
descriptions of the "what,where,why,how" of the topic in question.

My firm belief is that ANYONE can be "literate" if helped.  Its amazing the
number of people who reply "Oh that makes sense now".  These "howto" books
you find in shops are a problem because of this - they show people how to do
things by rote, and not teach anyone anything of WHY they do things.  The
majority of the HOWTO postings in c.o.l.a. avoid this trap, and try to
explain, which is a Good Thing(tm).

And you are ignoring a basic principle of humanity: people are lazy.
They DO ask questions that they have asked before, or can find out in other
ways.

Wrong.  SOME people, correct, but mainly wrong.  Large software companies have
learnt this, which is why they now charge for hotline support, or start
using premium rate phone-lines, and so on.  People will not look at the paper
in front of them, if they can get someone else to do it for them.

At work, I *never* (well rarely) answer the question that is given to me.
Instead I teach them about the subject, and at the end lead them through the
steps to the answer.  Afterwards I might ask them a similar question, and
half hour earlier they wouldn't have had a clue, but now they do.  This is a
longer process (takes more of my time) in the short term, but the increase of
knowledge and productivity in the long term is worth it.

Conclusion (have you read this far?): EDUCATE people in the basics, so they
can learn more themselves.  Hell, I don't expect a newbie to know a fraction
of what I know.  But I can teach them!  I may be a bad teacher (too impatient)
but I try.  If anyone else reading this CAN'T act in this way, please don't
flame the poor individual.  IGNORE THEM!
There will always be someone who will answer.

Something else to consider is that fact that not all people have access to
newsreaders (or gopher for that matter).  Untill we got a newsfeed here
at school, in order to post we had to telnet directly into an nntp server
that we found that would let us post.  Using that nntp server directly
to read news was a ROYAL pain however.  I'm not justifying the people who
have news access, and are too lazy to read it, but they aren't the only ones
who post asking for email replies.

Personally, I ask for posts and/or email for replies, this way, if someone
feels a solution is worth posting, they can (and hopefully do ;) share it
with the rest of the net.  We have a short article life here at school though,
so if I miss news for a couple of days (hellish work schedule, leave campus
for the weekend, whatever) I may miss a posted response.

I guess this is one of those things that goes on a case-by-case basis, you
can't make generalizations one way or the other, because for every 
generalization, there are probably a great many number of exceptions ;)

Well, I've rambled on enough, it's time for me to get back to work

SCO can do it but not anywhere near as gracefully as Linux.  The last time
I used SCO, its mountable DOS filesystem code was *real* slow, and the
doscp utility was very cumbersome (can't take wildcards, etc).  With Linux
you just issue a 'mount -t msdos /dev/fd0H1440 /mnt' command and it performs
every bit as fast as the hardware can handle (when *will* the 1.44M floppy
finally fade away?).

SysVr4 isn't even as nice as SCO.  Linux wins hands-down over every
commercial enviroment for ease of use in its DOS integration tools, in
my book.

        For some systems, this would be a "competitive downgrade", since,
for example, the current Yggdrasil LGX release uses the 0.99.13 kernel,
while all other CDROM's use 0.99.12 or older kernels, and LGX has a lot
of other software not found on any other Linux-based CDROM distribution,
such as the Andrew System, the Postgres database system, software testing
and bug tracking tools, and our graphical control panels for easier
system configuration.

        If there is enough demand, maybe we could make money selling
this "upgrade" as a floppy with a bunch of "rm -rf" commands, although
downgrading to older binaries might be kind of difficult.  :-) :-)

I need to find the most recent file system standards.  However, the trick
is finding one that includes the sbin and conf directories, I've look
at tsx-11 and sunsite, but no luck.
