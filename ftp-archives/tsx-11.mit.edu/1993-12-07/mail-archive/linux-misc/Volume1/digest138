TAMU.99p12 does have Xfm, a really nice X file manager, and it is in the
default X startup for root. (I am biased toward Xfm, as some of the code is 
mine :-)

As for the others, while there are text based equivalents in TAMU.99p12,
I agree completely that the X versions need to be included.  All I can
say now is stay tuned, as these (and my other favorites, such as x3179,
ftptool, calentool ...) are not far off as package updates.

MCC-interim, Linux-lite, is a robust package with excellent documentation.  
It is truly: easy to install and more appropriate for a neophyte, or
someone who doesn't have a lot of time to spend working around problems.
In the last two months, I've install MCC-interim, SLS, and Slackware.
My experience suggest : if you like finding bugs -Don't install MCC-interim
you'll be disappointed. If you want to play-and-learn, MCC-interim is the

Date: Fri, 17 Sep 1993 18:34:04 GMT


Hi ther Linuxers !

I have al little Problem when I was compiling aXe 5.01 on Linux 0.99pl12
(Slackware Distribution 1.02).

I was told, that the Constant "PATH_MAX" was undefined. In fact, there was
no 'PATH_MAX' in that subdirectory at all !

In /usr/include/param.h, I found:

===============================
#include "linux/param.h"

 [stuff deleted....]

#define  MAXPATHLEN    PATH_MAX
===============================

but in "linux/param.h", there was nothing like this defined. In fact, I could
not find a definition for "PATH_MAX" at all (via grep) !

Any hints ?

Maybe a little bug in the system-include-files .

Hi !

I am an interested Linuxer with no full access to FTP. I just get my files
from the local ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de which is a mirroring site of the
tsx-11.

Unfortunatly, it seems a little out of date.

examples:

.../ALPHA/Wine    just a readme while Wine 0.3.1 is allready released
.../ALPHA/QIC-80  ftape-0.9.3 while there's 0.9.6 out !

no Patches to ups and the other things announced to be on the sunsite :-((

Is this caused by a wrong mirroring or is the TSX-11 really so out-of-date ?

If it's the second, maybe there could be the possibility to update the archives
and add the new, useful things of the sunsite-archive (and remove some of the
REALLY OLD stuff there !!).

Date: Fri, 17 Sep 1993 19:11:51 GMT

I have been using Linux for about 1/2 year now, and have built a
system that I like, it was based on SLS v1.0, but I have added a hodge
podge of tools to it.  The problem is that I need to recommend a
single package to my school for use on its BBS (looking for a cheap
and easy UUCP, Network-able option on the BBS computer, and Linux is
the way to go IMO), and in all consciousness I am not going to
recommend SLS because of price, and the recent complaints of bugs in
SLS v1.03, what I need to know is what release is easy, small BUT
complete in all the Networking, and is understandable to newbies?  I
am not going to be at this school forever, and want an easy to use
release that people can install without fear.  Suggestions on which
release you found the easiest to network?  I would prefer answers from
people not doing localhost, but with an actual Ethernet connection to a 
File server.  Thanks.

And since this would take up a lot of bandwidth, I would ask that
people send e-mail as not to disturb others. :-)

Great! I'm looking forward to it. I also applaud your position
regarding the installation scripts (and TAMU has by far the easiest X
installation). I'm beginning to turn away from SLS since I belive it
lost the linux spirit (no flames please, that's my personal opinion).

Plaase include my favorites, these I use all the time:

seyon:          best comm program, IMHO. Very easy to use, convenient, and
                        quite configurable. Rivals even my DOS favorite: Procomm+
                        for Windows.
xsysinfo:       not only is it quite informative, is also saved my butt a
                        few times when it showed I was running low on swap space
                        (linux used to lock up in such cases).
xv:                     where did that Cindy Crabwford pic go? :-)
mumail:         this I use also at work on my DECstation, and we're
                        beginning to standarize on. Elm-killer. I love that it can
                        use gzipped folders transparently and the burst digest
                        feature is convenient for reading letters from the mailing
                        list. Haven't used the MIME facilities much though.
unclutter:      oh boy, I like this one a lot. (if you don't know what it
                        does, here it is: it hides the mouse pointer when not in
                        use, uncluttering the xterm or emacs window).

My other favorites are emacs 19 and olvwm, but those are already
included.

Subject: New M-Script Demo
From: morley@suncad.camosun.bc.ca (Mark Morley)
Date: 17 Sep 93 11:35:08 PDT

For those of you who are following the progress of my BBS programming
language, there is a new demo of it.  Telnet to buckyball.camosun.bc.ca
and log in as 'ftpdemo', no password.  The shell for this account is
another M-Script program that is basically an FTP client.  This is mainly
to show off the built-in FTP commands that are part of the M-Script
language.  Keep in mind that this particular M-Script demo is written
entirely in M-Script - there are NO external programs called, etc.

About all you can do as a guest user is to "open" a connection to any FTP
server, "close" it, "cd" to a directory, and get a "dir" listing. 
Although M-Script can do all the FTP functions (Get, Put, blah, blah) I
can't let non-local people try them all.

Again, I apologise for any sloppiness in the demo.  Please blame it on my
haste and not on M-Script or my programming skills.

By the way, the programmer's reference guide for M-Script is coming along
nicely.  I didn't get it finished the other day like I thought, but it's
getting there.  I've tried to include sample code for each M-Script
command (or at least where I could think of something to write).  Anyone
interested in taking a peek at it?  I could put a Postscript file up for
FTP if anyone's interested in it.

Mark

PS: Don't know what M-Script is?  Send me email.
    Can't locate M-Script?  That's because it isn't available - yet.

PPS: If you have trouble connecting to buckyball, blame it on Linux.  A bug
     somewhere in the NET-2 code seems to periodically disable incoming
     telnets.  I'll have to grab a newer NET-2 release soon...

I've always wondered about this. I know I can cure it by adding:
#include <linux/limits.h>
to the affected programs, but how about it? Can I cure this once and for
all through links (or some other means)?

I set up the include files the way the README for them spelled out, but
if anyone knows a better way I'd like to hear about it.

I guess the best advice would be to build your commercial app using a
old release, since it will then run on all the older versions floating around
AND the latest versions as well.  A very non-intuitive result --- you would think the
best way to go is build for the newest release!

Actually, it's probably the same problem.  From what I understand,

About a month ago, I heard that it was expected to be out around

Subject: Hard Drive/Controller Question...
Date: Fri, 17 Sep 1993 22:45:02 GMT


I'm currently in the process of putting together a computer system and I
need some information and possibly some recommendations:

I'm pretty much set on purchasing a SCSI hard drive + controller.  As
far as the controller goes, I was primarily looking at a Adaptech 1542
series controller.  But here comes my problem.  There appear to be 4
types of SCSI devices now, SCSI-I, SCSI-II (both of which I knew) but
now I see a "fast Scsi-I" and "fast SCSI-II".  My main question is, 
regarding the Adaptec series of controllers; how compatible are the
SCSI standards?  I know that a SCSI-II controller will work in 
SCSI-I mode to be able to use SCSI-I hard drives, but if I purchase
a "fast SCSI-II" adaptec controller, will that controller work 
with say and old SCSI-I hard drive, or for that matter a non-fast
SCSI-II hard drive?  I'm planning to use an older SCSI-I hard
drive until I can upgrade but can I even use it, if I purchase 
the "fast" adaptec model?  for that matter, how much faster is "fast"?
Substantial?  Does it require a DOS driver to get the performance?
I'll be running on an ISA MB and under Unix...

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks
