Subject: SONIC based enet cards?
Date: 16 Aug 1993 20:30:46 GMT


I got the following list from the NET2 FAQ -- can someone tell me which if
any of these cards are based on the National SONIC controller?

My unstated goal, aside from getting a working/supported enet card, is to
be able to use the hardware "watchdog" timer.  I need some high resolution
timings, and the SONIC has a free-running 5Mhz countdown timer that's pretty
easy to use.  (I assume the drivers don't otherwise use this timer -- right?)

        3com 3c503, 3c503/16
        Novell NE1000, NE2000
        Western Digital WD8003, WD8013
        Hewlett Packard HP27245, HP27247, HP27250 (these drivers could
          do with more testing)

        The following clones are reported to work:
        WD-80x3 clones: LANNET LEC-45
        NE2000 clones: Alta Combo, Artisoft LANtastic AE-2, Asante Etherpak
          2001/2003, D-Link Ethernet II, LTC E-NET/16 P/N 8300-200-002,
          Network Solutions HE-203, SVEC 4 Dimension Ethernet, 4-Dimension
          FD0490 EtherBoard 16.

heres how I do it...

on linux:
tredir 600x other.machine.name:6000
export DISPLAY=linuxname:x.0
( x=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 )

on othermachine:
xhost + school.machine.name

then from the linux box things like:
xterm &

work fine (if not a little slow)

the machine that is to display the xclients must have xhost + to the 
machine that is running the term server (ie: where your home machine
connects to)

hope this helps...

Actually, ThinWire NICs run about $5-$20 less than 10BaseT, depending
on the manufacturer.  Though you are right about the hubs, 8 port hubs
usually go for $200 wholesale, and that is an econo-hub.

Xboard-2.1 has been very difficult to compile under Linux.
I think that's the reason why it is missing.

Xboard-3.0 will be published during the next days.
It can be compiled for Linux without any problem.

So, whoever out there is going to update the SLS or Slackware
package:  please add xboard-3.0.

RAM is only an issue if you don't have enough.  If you don't have enough
it is an issue with or without merge.  u386mon tells me that with 32M of
RAM and about a 6-8M kernel space I generally run about 65% of available
RAM.  With 3 Merge sessions running, a 486/66 begins to get VERY
unresponsive, and u386mon reports ... gee about 75% RAM usage.
(Everything else being equal).  Uptime and SAR on the otherhand show
3.XX+ load and 0% available CPU the WHOLE TIME the sessions are active.

48MB is a waste if you don't need it.  I'd start with 16MB and something
like u386mon or sar and see if you even swap.  32MB is a LOT of RAM for
a system being used as a fileserver.  With 64 ports and about 40+
interactive terminals I've never swapped on this 486/66 SCO box.  EVER.
and it only has 32MB with everyone running all sorts of different stuff.
If you have a load big enough to demand more than 32MB of RAM I think
you will need a little more CPU and disk performance, before the memory.

Subject: Does bootlin 1.4 actually exist?
Date: Sun, 15 Aug 1993 22:40:14 GMT

The file 'bootlin4.zip' at tsx-11.mit.edu actually seems to contain
bootlin 1.3.  But its documentation claims that bootlin 1.4 will be
able to boot Linux from a DOS command line (ie, you can boot up DOS
and *then* start Linux).  For my purposes this would be better than
using LILO ...

I've verified that 1.3 does *not* work this way :-(, it just hangs
unless started from the config.sys file.

Is 1.4 actually out there, and if so where?

                        thanks, tom lane

Uh, do you have empirical proof of this?        (-:

On the other hand, perhaps you have a point.  Back in the early days of Linux
and 386BSD, it seemed (to an outsider; I use a Sun clone and SunOS all the
time) like Linux was an interesting research project (no offense intended to
Linus; when a single person writes a whole O/S kernel, one can't help but have
an initial impression of it being an "interesting research project" (-: - of
course, it has mushroomed considerably since then).  And it seemed like 386BSD
was the spirit of BSD & Net-2 reincarnated, and therefore more likely (just due
to that fact alone, with the inherent right-off-the-bat software compatibility
issues that this promised) to become more largely adopted.  The fact that it
had the Net-2 networking code and Linux' early support for networking and thus
X were considered suspect no doubt fueled this perception.

Now it seems like (emphasis on "seems like") 386BSD and NetBSD have dissolved
in a hail of acrimony, including bickering with the Jolitz's, a (hostile?)
takeover of the software that smacks of "Hey!  That was a great idea!  Glad I
thought of it!"  Meanwhile, there's the fact that there are more than 7 times
the number of postings to the Linux groups than to the 386BSD/NetBSD groups:

isolar:2:40 % ls -R1 /var/spool/news/comp/os/386bsd | egrep '^[1-9]' | wc -l
     226
isolar:2:41 % ls -R1 /var/spool/news/comp/os/linux  | egrep '^[1-9]' | wc -l
    1593

So, at least, it would appear that Linux has won the "popularity contest".
Whether it is the "best OS you can get for the 386 class of hardware" is still
an IMHO statement, I would think.  An interesting turn of events, nonetheless.

Again, these are just the observations of an interested bystander/outsider.
Further comments/observations from an insider's perspective welcomed ...

Certainly.

I don't have a problem as such with C-News, I'm just saying that, from
