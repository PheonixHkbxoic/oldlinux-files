Hmm.  Looks like some of those new linux groups were finally created.  I
suppose that comp.os.linux should become dead soon...  Ah well, I suppose
I should cross-post this a bit then...

In any case, I finally got my Linux box to network outside the local zone now.
The fix?  It seems that the "route" command is very order sensitive.  So I put
everything in a certain particular order and now it works.

But some things don't work:  I can't do an nslookup on addresses in the
/etc/hosts file, although I can use that file for aliasing.  And the fingering
doesn't work right:  Nobody on my system has logged in.  Bull.  And solutions
for that?

Here is my rc.local file:
---------------------------- rc.local -----------------------------------------
if [ -x /etc/rc.inet1 ]; then 
        /bin/hostname -S `cat /etc/host`
        /etc/rc.inet1 
        (sleep 2;          # wait for daemons to get a foothold 
        mount -av -t nfs)&
else
        /bin/hostname -S shemp.cosc.brocku.ca
fi 

if [ -f /etc/lilo/bootargs ]; then
        (cd /etc/lilo; /bin/sh ./bootargs)
fi
if [ -x /etc/clock ]; then
        /etc/clock -s
fi

if [ -x /etc/syslogd ]; then
        syslogd  # turn on logging of su's, logins etc.
fi

if [ -x /etc/syslogk ]; then
        syslogk on > /usr/log/kernel&  # log all kernel messages.
fi

if [ -x /etc/lpd ]; then
        /etc/lpd        # printer daemon
fi
------------------ end of rc.local --------------------------------------------

Notice that I put in /etc/rc.inet1 instead of /etc/rc.net.  Doing that cleared
up a few problems, as I followed through most of the NET-2 FAQ, and _it_ used
rc.inet1 and rc.inet2, so _I_ used them.

Here is my (slightly edited) rc.inet1 file:
------------------------------ rc.inet1 ---------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
# rc.inet1: configure the network interface

# IF YOU HAVE AN ETHERNET CONNECTION, use these lines below to configure the
# eth0 interface. If you're only using loopback or SLIP, don't include the
# rest of the lines in this file.

# Edit for your setup.
IPADDR="my.site.address"  # REPLACE with YOUR IP address!
NETMASK="my.network.mask"  # REPLACE with YOUR netmask!
NETWORK="my.network.address"  # REPLACE with YOUR network address!
BROADCAST="my.broadcast.address"  # REPLACE with YOUR broadcast address, if you
                           # have one. If not, leave blank and edit below.
GATEWAY="my.gateway.address"  # REPLACE with YOUR gateway address!

/etc/ifconfig eth0 ${IPADDR} netmask ${NETMASK} broadcast ${BROADCAST}
# If you don't have a broadcast address, change the above line to just:
#/etc/ifconfig eth0 ${IPADDR} netmask ${NETMASK}

/etc/route add default gw ${GATEWAY} metric 1
#/etc/route add ${NETWORK}
/etc/route add ${IPADDR}

/etc/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
/etc/route add 127.0.0.1

/etc/rc.inet2
# End of rc.inet1
------------------------ end of rc.inet1 --------------------------------------
Notice that all of the addresses are put in this file explicitly, rather than
figured out from the /etc/hosts file.  For some reason the rc.net script that
came with the initial SLS 1.03 file mucked up the broadcast address.  Mine was
aa.bb.cc.255, but it set it to aa.bb.255.255.

Also note that I put the gateway first, skipped the network, then put in the
local machine, and finally the loopback.  Having skipped over the network seems
to be what fixed up the seeing-outside-my-zone problem.

I call the rc.inet2 file from rc.inet1.  The file contains almost exactly the
stuff from the NET-2 FAQ (ie. I copied it from the distribution files into
/etc instead of /conf/net.  It doesn't matter where it resides as long as it
can be found.) except that I uncommented the named stuff.  However, doing this
didn't fix up doing an nslookup on entries in the /etc/hosts file so I'm
probably going to comment it out again.

I hope this helps some of you other Linuxers get your machines working on the
network...

I got Arjan's INN1.4 to run under Linux (thanks for the tar file and
recent updated postings on it) and it's *INCREDIBLE*.

I have trn3.1 and tin1.2p1 set up to use the INN overview database

That thing absolutely screams !!!!

Anyway, I'll be adding some words regarding INN to the UUCP-NEWS-MAIL-FAQ

I have been messing about with the vgalib that I found in SLS1.03.
The problem I have is this. Do all programs that use the library have 
to be run as root, or am I doing something wrong? It appears to be reporting 
that I can't changes the I/O permissions if I am not root. This does
put a limitation on the program that I am messing about with at the moment

Since programs written with vgalib/svgalib require access to the
hardware directly, they must 1) be executed by root OR 2) suid root.

So, if you log in (or su) root, you can:
chown root.system vgafoo
chmod +s vgafoo

This way, any user who can execute the file should not get the message
about I/O permissions.

Unfortunately, this requires that one SU a lot (or log in as root)
while developing programs for vgalib.

I don't know of any solution for this particular 'problem.'  Was it
neatly addressed in some README file that I skipped?

Hi folks:

        Ok, this may be a dumb naiive question, but please bear with me.  I
just purchased a 14.4 modem (yay!).  It works great on my 386-40 running SLS
1.02...but one thing I've noticed.  Whenever I'm doing a file transfer at
14.4, if I do anything (ie start up XV or something) while the transfer is
happening, it looses packets until whatever I started is loaded.  I realize
this problem is probably caused by the cpu, uart or whatever being unable to
keep up...
Am I correct in this assumption?  I seem to remember in the days of OS/2
2.0's intro people running into the same problem, and the solution being to
get a faster UART in their pc.......

I've been using Linux for quite a while now, and I think it is time for me
to start contributing...  But I had no real idea what to write!

Proposition: why don't we make a list of wanted applications, so those who
are bored can pick from them and start writing?  i.e., we need a good
wordproccessing package, a windoze API emulator, etc

And of course we need someone to maintain this list!

Any comments on this?

Yes unfortunitly like many of the chips in the PC chipset the 8250
suffers from severe brain damage and/or age. Fortunitly getting a 16550
will solve the problem. Inorder to run at 14K baud on an 8250 your
machine has to keep up with atleast 1400 interrupts/second.

A lot of the FreeBSD and NetBSD traffic has moved off to mailing lists;
for instance, this is Sunday night.  The combined traffic on the FreeBSD
mailing list alone on Saturday (14 Aug 93) and Sunday (15 Aug 93) has
been 47 messages (I have hopes for 50 before the night is out -- it's
10:20PM here right now).

The group traffic is not indicative of the level of activity, only the
amount of usenet postings... ie: the group traffic.

This isn't counting the "merge" list traffic or the NetBSD traffic.

What communications programs are there for Linux? I saw a few on
sunsite.unc.edu but they weren't exactly what I was looking for in
a comm program. 

One that I was trying out, ecu, has a "device" field for each
dialing dir entry. I left that the way it was and filled in the rest of 
the fields.  When I selected the new entry it said something like "no idle
ACU line on /dev/cua1", and then kicked me out to interactive mode, making
me do the dialing.

Also, has anyone successfully compiled the tracker 3.10 mod player on
sunsite.unc.edu?  Make quit when it said there was a parsing error in
line 60 of linux_audio.c. I looked at line 60 and it just has:

    stereo = s;

I have no idea what's wrong with it.

If we had a port of Andrew we'd have a good word-processor. Perhaps
we should start with a list of "things that need porting" before we
get on to new stuff:

1. Andrew. This comes up often. There's a guy at CMU who plans to look
at it one day but I don't think that should stop any other enthusiastic
person. I believe this one is not easy, and I think it is various applications
sharing one library so it will work best if it has a shared library.

2. IP multicast. This is a kernel one.

3. Audio comms. I don't think the source of vat is available (giving
the 386BSD crowd an unfair advantage -- grumble. This also applies to wb
(double grumble)). There are other packages for which source is available: 
ivs and multi-g.

4. Video comms. Source of nv is available. I realise that like vat and wb
this works best with multicast. However all these tools work in point-to-
point mode and if we do that bit of the porting now we'll be ready for
multicast. Doing a version of nv that can receive video is probably easy.
The trick is to interface to PC video capture cards.

5. ISODE. Yes we should have OSI networking. And ISODE includes some
other interesting stuff like SNMP agents and clients.

6. SecuDE and/or OSISEC for X.509-based security.

7. Kerberos, though obviously distribution of that will be problematical.

That's all I can think of at the moment.

I've added a new series to the Slackware distribution.

The 'E' series contains GNU Emacs 19.18 and the full set of support
files and Lisp source. Currently, this requires four 3.5" disks.
Depending on how much of the distribution you install, it needs anywhere
from 5 to 17 megabytes of drive space.

It was compiled with GCC 2.4.5 and the 4.4.1 libraries. It requires the
4.4.1 shared libraries, as well as the libX11 shared library.

Under Slackware 1.00 or 1.01, or SLS 1.03, you should be able to install
the 'E' series with the command: sysinstall -special E

Enjoy!

Subject: FInding Longest "String" algorithm wanted.
Date: Mon, 16 Aug 93 07:32:56 GMT

I'm writing a backup utility with an ECC layer.  To offset this
expansion (about 4%), I'm writing compression into the program.  I'm
(what I understand from compression.faq) writing is a LZ77 family
compressor, subsitution based.  I've tried two forms of "finding the
longest string" but they are just too slow.  I'm using a sliding window
and lookahead buffer.

Could someone explain or pointer me to a fast algorithm?

Tried algorithms:
        1) Brute force method.  Really slow!
        2) A Beyer-Moore (?) method of using an array to judge
        how many chars to jump to start the new search.

        This one is better but I'm getting the longest match in
        under a second but this is still too slow.

Thanks,
Dan

P.S.  This is my first try at compression.

Not a FASTER UART, a BUFFERED UART.  The standard PC UART is the 16450, which
does not buffer incoming characters, so if the cpu can't get the character
before the next one arrives (do to multi-tasking delays) then that character
is lost.

You should probably get a 16550A or compatible buffering UART.  It will likely
solve the problem.

I've used MCC's distribution ever since it first came out.  Owen's done an
excellent job of making the install pretty much idiot-proof, and the amazing
thing is, everything works!  Judging by the number of complaints I've seen
re: SLS, I can't say the same thing about it.
