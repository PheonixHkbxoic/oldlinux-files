Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

There is a binary version of postgres 4.0.1 on sunsite, tsx-11 and
mirrors.  Complete source and binaries of Postgres 4.1 are on the
Yggdrasil CD.  I will make a complete source and binary release of
Postgres 4.2 for Linux, once it is available.

 The bug is not in the kernel, but in the /etc/mount program: it does
not propagate filesystem specific options ("extra options") to the 
kernel.

Here is a patch (against the mount of the utile-2.1 package):

      if (streq (opt, om->opt))
        {
        if (om->inv)
          *mask &= ~om->mask;
        else
          *mask |= om->mask;
        return;
        }
+   if ( *extra_opts )
+     strcat( extra_opts, "," );
+   strcat( extra_opts, opt );
  }
    
  /* Take -o options list and compute 4th and 5th args to mount(2).  flags
     gets the standard options and extra_opts anything we don't recognize.  */
  static void
  parse_opts (char *opts, int *flags, char **extra_opts)
  {
    char *opt;
  
    if (opts != NULL)
      {
        *extra_opts = xmalloc (strlen (opts) + 1); 
        **extra_opts = '\0';

That's why I chose to wire COM3 and COM4 to IRQ 2 and 5, respectively.
 
Advantage: Win 3.1 allows for adjusting COM[3,4]IRQ and COM[3.4]ADDR,
thus you can use all 4 COM ports under Windows (if you care :). DOS will
not allow for those IRQs, though, without patching the COM3 and COM4 
device drivers. It was very cheap too because I can use a second
simple serial card for $10. Any other free interrupt will work equally
well but you should be aware which IRQs are used by other cards. 

Disadvantage: I will not be able to use LPT2 (which is wired to IRQ5
normally) ans IRQ2 (which is hardly ever used by other peripherals, even
not by VGA cards). Plus, you have to find the respective traces on the
PCB board, cut them with a knife and replace them by short pieces of
thin insulated wire. 

Ciao,
hm

There has been an effort to create a kind of Wysywig word-processor
under Linux on the WORD channel of the linux-activists list. That
is quiet now, but maybe some people are still coding. Try the channel,
maybe you'll get one. 

And: Do you need a tool to make brochures, magazines, ... or something

Hi folks,

I'm a new Linux user (just got it from Linux Systems) and one of the
first things I'm trying to get working is telnet over SLIP.  Last night
was the first time I got far enough to get a telnet session thru the SLIP
server started, but as soon as the session started I kept getting errors
about data fragmentation which eventually led my telnet session to end.. 
I looked in the Net-2 HOWTO and found a bug description that said that IP
fragmentation is not supported in Net-2d but that it should be supported
in Net-2e.  Can anyone tell me: 1) how I can verify that I have net-2d,  
2) if there's any way around this problem in net-2d by setting
appropriate configuration options, or 3) is Net-2e available yet, if so
where can I get it...

thnx

All this cross-posting is a main reason why the volume is so high!  The
point of the breakup of c.o.l was to be more specific in the intended audience.
If everything is cross-posted, it defeats the purpose.
