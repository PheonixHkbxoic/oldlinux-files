Porting the Hurd?  Mach and cthreads provide a hardware independent interface
so the Hurd doesn't need porting.

The i386ps2, i386at, MacII, sun3, mips, alpha and vax ports are free.

Mach 2.5 provides all the calls of 3.0 plus the BSD system calls.  Both
support the external memory manager.  Keeping BSD suppressed could be a
problem but it may be feasible to run on 2.5.  But the BSD side would be
just be extra baggage, so you would prefer to port to 3.0 by deleting
all the BSD code.

This is astonishing. I've a V7-Mirage w/ 801 (i.e. basically the same
graphics controller as the 805), and I get 57,000 xstones.
BUT the difference is that my cpu is only a 386-40 (which is about
three to four times as slow as yours).

I would have expected a greater impact of the cpu performance on 
the graphics performance (of course, NOT directly proportional to
cpu performance).

Of course, the next logical question is:  wouldn't the first such sync
update everything?  If so, then what is left to be updated every 30 seconds
thereafter?

The answer is probably this (I have not looked closely to verify):
The daemons that continue to run, such as cron, periodically access data
files, without necessarily writing or updating anything.  This by itself
does not cause anything to be written to the device (by sync), but if the
filesystem is mounted r/w, then it tries to keep track of last date/time 
of *access* for each file (a nifty feature), which *does* require that
data be written to the (directory entry on) disk.  Under linux, these writes
are held in buffers, and flushed by sync every 30 seconds.

I think this sitemaster is overstepping his bounds.
(I say he for simplicity - not trying to be sexist.)
He can put up a "motd" advising his users to take
part, and even provide a script in the default
path to make it easier for his users to register.
For the sitemaster to send in the votes is too much -
besides, how is he supposed to know if his users use
Linux at home or not?

If you still don't have a "friend" counter built,
make a separate copy of the counter for such mass
registrations.  The information would be interesting,
but it would be misleading to merge it without comment
into the original database.

Vaguely related: I've had problems here at HP, when my login shell was t/csh
and not ksh (notably: you can't use HP/VUE !!). Programmers often assume that
you have one type of shell as your login shell (bad practice), or they don't
know/realise that the two types of shell are quite different in some respects;
eg: in the variables they use, and command syntax etc.

I'm still too busy sorting out other linux problems to notice any tcsh ones,
though.

Subject: getty-ps RINGBACK problems
Date: 10 Nov 1993 17:53:00 GMT


Guten Tag!

After setting up a dial-in on my Linux system I felt the intense urge to be
able to answer incoming voice calls again. (Yes, I have only one phone line.)
So I decided to set up the ringback feature of getty.

I recompiled the sources, defining the appropriate symbol to create a ringback
getty, installed them and started to test them. According to the debug output
(got with DEBUG=777) the ringback is correctly recognized. Unfortunately,
when sending the CONNECT sequence ("" ATA\r CONNECT\s\A) the modem does not
answer. In the debugging output I found (don't have the file here but you'll
get the idea if I retype the output from my remembrance)):

        ... performing connect sequence...
        EXPECT: nothing            Ah, that's the "" from the CONNECT sequence
        SEND: ATA\r                Yea, my modem should answer now...
        EXPECT: CONNECT [speed]    .. and get back this nifty little string.
        GOT: ^M^J^M^J^M^JRING^M^J^M^J^M^JRING^M^J^M^J^M^J...

Well, seems as if my modem does not really accept the ATA but only reports the
incoming RINGs.

It's somewhat interesting that the same CONNECT sequence works fine when
getty is set up without the ringback feature.

Changing the ATA\r to \r\r\r\r\r\rAT\rAT\rAT\rATA\r and such did not show
any more positive result.

I'm using the pl11 kernel (should I expect anything else with pl13?) and
the getty_ps 2.0.7b.

Any information will be appreciated. Thank you for your help!

        It's no secret that statitics are very easily manipulated to show
numerous results from the same info (if you want a good example, take a look
at the opinion polls preceding any governmental election).

        To do the first option would (as I see it) count as inadvertant
manipulation of statistics. The post suggests that the country concerned is
not as far ahead as the new results would put it.

        The second option seems a little unfair. I think that every linux user
has the right to be counted (ok - assuming they wish to be). I dare say that
some of them are now proud that they can actually do something worthwhile with
their PC's, and would probably be somewhat put out if their votes were ignored.

        The third option is, in my opinion, the best by far. It's fair to all,
and gives the best reflection of the number of users. There would have to be
some conditions enforced for allowing people to do this, to avoid the faking
of figures. God only knows why anyone would want to fake results, and he didn't
tell me last time I spoke to him. Sorry. It might be an idea to ask for an
IP address or nodename etc, from sys admins so that the new info can fit in
with what's current, instead of just having me mail you saying we've got 10000
linux boxes here. (In fact, we only have two.)

        Well, that's what I think...

This doesn't surprise me much. A DX2/66 runs the bus at 33MHz. You've
got the bus running at 40MHz. If they're both localbus, the difference
will matter. The other reason is that dots, lines, and boxes are not
compute intensive. I'm not sure if the 801/805 have ellipse functions.
If not, the DX2-66 will beat out the 386 for ellipses. Another area where
CPU matters is in the non-video window functions like creating, destroying,
moving and resizing unmapped windows. The CPU muscle comes out in those
benchmarks in x11perf. You just have to think about what you're testing
and where the bottlenecks are.

I'm using Slackware 1.0.5.  I've got SLIP working and it's pretty stable.
I've managed to run X11 apps at school and display it at home over my
USR 14.4 Sportster.

What I don't like about SLIP is that it is a pain to set up (I don't
like to have to su to root every time and manual dial through dip).
Is there PPP support for Linux?  I know FreeBSD and NetBSD has it.

Ideally, I'd like to have my users be able to establish an Internet
Protocol connection over the serial line without having to su root.  As
well, the SLIP server on the other end requires a unique password and
userid for each user and the host and local address are not always the
same.  Also, the phone number is sometimes busy which means I have to
sometimes try several numbers to get a connection.  Anything which
takes away all the typing I have to do would be good.

This 805 card has 60ns dram, you would get closer to 90k with 45ns dram
(I've seen 88k on a localbus S3-805 /486-66).
