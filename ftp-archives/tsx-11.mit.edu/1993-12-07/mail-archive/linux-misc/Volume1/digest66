Have you done anything to customize your uucp configuration?  The
best rate I've seen here so far is about 1100CPS, but on average it
is much worse.

Hey, even major corporations with hundreds or thousands of employees
working on a project make "elementary mistakes"!  When was the last time
you got a SunOS release with no seemingly-simple mistakes/bugs?  Not
too long ago, I got some software from DEC for SunOS, and it came on
a CD that was ONLY mountable on a DEC ULTRIX system!  How much more
of an *elementary mistake* can you make?

This having been said, I think some of the complaints we're seeing
re: LINUX SLS is the fact that many people are Paying for the product,
so it appears to be a commercial release.  I, for one, bought the
disk format of SLS.  Although being familiar with this kind of stuff,
I realized that this "cost" was just to cover handling, labor, and
disks, and that Linux itself is a free product, others, particularly
those new to freeware, might not look at it that way.

Those selling SLS for $99 or whatever should make it more clear
(and should be *required* to make it clear) that LINUX is not a
commercial product.

I would agree that many of the criticisms are valid.  Those which have
been presented as constructive criticism and/or bug reports are quite
appropriate, and will probably lead to a better product.  However, some
of the posts did resemble "childish wining," which IMO is uncalled for,
and (to say the least) quite ungrateful to the long hours of hard work put
in by Peter, Linus, and many others.  This I find to be rather destructive,
as Peter et al have made significant contributions to the Linux community,
and were they to give up in disgust and stop contributing we would all be
the poorer for it.  The only people this would serve would be Bill Gates,
and possible AT&T/Novell.

Perhaps, perhaps not.  Much of the Linux community is learning UNIX
through Linux.  Althoug I have done much of my admin work on Sun's (indeed
I am now employed full-time doing that) I have learned a great deal about
the more subtle workings of UNIX through Linux, simply becouse it is not
as simple to install as SUNOS.  Not that I am opposed to easy installations :-),
I have been a user of MCC, SLS, and more recently slackware.

I strongly disagree.  At the time that Peter first came out with the SLS
distribution MCC was alot more primitive, X was a nightmare to install,
and finding all the diverse unix utilities we now take for granted was
a full-time endaevor.  The SLS distribution, even in its buggy first
incarnation, was a tremendous boon to those of us who didn't have the time
to hunt down this stuff.  SLS has served many people (myself included)
very well over the months, and has provided an important evolutionary
step toward even better distributions (slackware, and possibly debian).
Even were SLS to vanish from the community now, its contribution would
go on being felt for quite some time.  Those who are comming out with
new distributions have Peter's experiences to benefit from, and can
avoid some of the pitfalls he has stumbled over from time to time.  This
benefits us all.

Currently I use the slackware distribution, but it is my hope that all of
the distributions which are now comming out will contribute to one another,
and that all of them will improve as a result.

happy linuxing, and many thanks to Linux, Peter, and everyone else for a
great system.

Jean.

  I'm a very happy MCC user who has never tried SLS.  I get the clear impression
that SLS has given high priority to having as many features available as poss-
ible, while MCC has concentrated on a smaller number with more documentation
and debugging.

   There is clearly a place for both systems, but I think those who recommend
SLS to newcomers are misguided.   There was a time when MCC didn't have as
many things available as it does now (no emacs, for example) and a more 
difficult installation procedure, and I think many of those who recommend SLS
have not seen the new MCC.

   No big deal, but I think the installation process for the recent versions
of MCC borrowed (with acknowledgement) some ideas from SLS.

Why would you need to run NT under Unix?  All you need to emulate is
win32 ... how many NT specific applications are there anyway?

I still don't understand what advantage NT has over SunOS/Solaris+WABI
(let's forget about marketing for a moment:-).  Apparently WABI runs
Windows apps faster than either MS Windoze or NT.

Sun obviously needs to spend less money on software development and more
on marketing :-).

To follow up on my statement that going from 8K internal to 8K
internal + 256K external write-back cache, I originally stated that
this had less than a 5% improvement on my 486DX40.  This was in 4M of
ram.  Someone suggested that larger amounts of RAM might benefit more
from the cache, so I borrowed 16M from my boss.  The difference at 20M
of ram between having the external cache enabled and disabled was
quite significant, in the neighborhood of a 30% improvement.  Also,
the increased ram eliminated the swapping, so I know that my
increadibly slow compile times with 4M of ram was due to excessive
swapping.

I suppose you're sitting in the USA. Unfortunately ZyXEL's ain't very well known in the US (probably US-people prefer US-products, ZyXEL is taiwanese). Here in Europe (especially Germany and Switzerland, where I am sitting) they have an overwelming success: 18 month back you hardly found any BBS using a ZyXEL - now you hardly find a BBS that doesn't have at least 1 line with a ZyXEL with it's 19'200 bps support :-))

Unfortunately there is no SW included for UNIX (Linux) only for DOS, but seyon works fine, GNU-Fax should work, but I didn't try and if you want to use the voice-option (see above), you will have to write something yourself (at least as far as I know) (if you do: please post it, so I can also use it ;-))

Absolutely - I quite agree, but they have never met such a converter before,
and are really very skeptical (note they, not me) about a free operating system
for which they do not pay for support and don't really know how to use.

I think they'd be happier if they paid for the lot of it and could ring up and
shout at someone if it went wrong. Then they'd trust the f2c, even though it's
the same - it's the backup and promise of reliability that they're after, and
they don't accept that they are getting that with free software.

Don't get me wrong - I trust most of my linux setup to do it's job right,
and until proven otherwise would trust f2c (I've not tried it because I'm
not a fortran man myself). Unfortunately, I don't seem to be able to 
convince them to do the same.

Hmm.

    I get good transfer rates without having done anything special. I
have a cheap serial i/o card, but it has a 16550 on it. My gettydefs
line has CRTSCTS in it, but I think that only matters on incoming calls.
    If you're having problems with retries and dropped characters, maybe
flow control it not turned on. Try setserial. If your modem has mnp5
turned on, turn it off. 
    It could be because my feed also uses Taylor uucp, so they negotiate
a faster protocal, but I don't know because the logs don't record that.

While we're here, I think it's worth remembering that Peter did an awful
lot of work besides creating a distribution.  During the startup stages,
he was responsible for advancing several utilities and routines essential
to any *nix system.
