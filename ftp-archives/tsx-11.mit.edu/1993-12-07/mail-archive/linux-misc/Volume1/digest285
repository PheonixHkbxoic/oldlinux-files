Subject: Installing co-processor under Linux
Date: Mon, 8 Nov 1993 20:44:41 GMT


I run Linux/XFree on 386/25. I have tried to install a 387/20 that is
fine under DOS. After installing the chip Linux would not boot at all.
It fails on uncompressing the image.

I wonder whether Linux makes an attempt to uncompress the image and
uses the co-processor that fails due to the difference in speed or
is there something that I need to do to tell Linux that there has been
a change in the hardware. The co-processor is automatically detected
by the hardware.

Thanks in advance for any hints and ideas,

        Andrzej

A kind offer, but I don't think this sort of [un]official net fascism is

[many followups deleted]

I personally would love to see an alpha port. I wouldn't expect
it (at first) on the high end machines, but on the EISA based
alphas (which aren't that much more then pentiums(ii?) btw.

DEC fortunately has been pretty liberal in publishing the instruction
details for the processor, and, with an EISA bus, it shouldn't be
horrible porting to that machine, ditto r4k pc's. I have heard
that 386-bsd (rather, one of the n variants thereof) is being
ported to the alpha, and has been ported to the decstation, the
sun, and many other platforms. It is likely that much of this
code could be used to port linux to these other platforms, too.

As for OSF/1, v. 1.2 was pretty lame, i would have happily run
linux on it for the *reliability* upgrade. 1.3 is much more
stable, but, compared to linux, it is still a memory pig, but
it has many *many* similarities to linux, rather amusing, really.
However, i would love to have kernel sources so i can
fix the occasional things that have annoyed me (the xwindows
memory sieve for example).

Is your system reliable? If not, consider upgrading. My system is

I have installed XFree86 2.0 on my system
which has Orchid Celsius video card with IIT AGX chip.
Surely, it's not supported in this release so the
only way I managed to run it so far is using
XF86_VGA16 server in generic mode (nonaccelerated, only
16 colors, and slow like %$%^%  %^$#%$# .. :-(

And even so I have a problem: when I exit windows
they leave my adaptor in a funny state, in which
instead of ASCII chars I see some mess with vertical
strips. Using
echo "^V^O"
doesn't help.
How can I get around this ?

        Exactly.  An alpha port of linux is probably a big waste of
time.  Linux is very 386-specific, makes all sorts of assumptions
about what the CPU and memory architecture look like.  This is likely
a major reason why it runs faster than other PC-unices.  Most of these
are ports of existing OSes to the 386, which becomes almost an
exercise in "how little do we have to change and have it still work".
The 386 is a very cisc-y chip, I've heard rumours about major problems
with getting Linux to work with the 680x0 series of chips, I hate to
think how much worse it would be trying to port to a _risc_
architecture.

        In any case, since most unix workstations "come with" an OS
(ie, you don't buy the hardware and software separately), there aren't
very many people out there with a unix workstation looking for a unix
to run on it.  The only workstation I can think of that has any kind
of base of people using one at home is the sun 3.  (I say at home
because, typically, companies aren't interested in running nifty,
free, but buggy OSes on their expensive hardware when there's a
workable, stable alternative that they've already bought).

>If you can afford an alpha workstation, you can afford ULTRIX that comes with
>it.

        alphas run OSF/1 and VMS, not ultrix :)  Minor quibble :)

        Indeed.  I took the opportunity to roll new video modes, and
came up with a blurry 950x700 or so and a usable 850x620.  No major
problems, and it definately looks faster on my tseng labs et4000

What brand do you use? There are *indications* that non_Intel copro's, that
work fine under MSDOG, have problems under Linux. It's probably a timing
problem. As far as I know there aren't any solutions (yet) to this problem.

Well, yes, even Linux will condesend to working with the "program masher"

LILO will work just find with an extended partition. Just remember that the
first extended partition is at /dev/hda5 for an IDE drive and /dev/sda5
for a SCSI drive. This applies even if you have only two primary partitions.

Hi folks,

I'm reasoning about partition sizes on my harddisk for Linux.
The drive's capacity is 200 Megs.
I'm planning to have /home and /usr each on a separate partition, plus a 
partition for / and all its subdirs (except /home and /usr), plus
a swap partition.
My machine has 4 Meg RAM, so I want to install the complete SLS release,
but without X.
Is the above partitioning a good choice?
Can anybody give me some hints on the sizes to choose for
my partitions?
