All off screen memory will be used as cache, it would mean you cache pixmaps
of upto 256x256, and several hundred more fonts than you would ever want.
If you spen a lot of time moving big pixmaps around then this might be
important to you. But the caching of the xfree86-2.0 servers is still far to
primative to make much advantage of the extra ram (should improve with time
though).

You can of course keep this resolution, but use a 1280x1024 virtual screen,
helps xfig fit :-)

If you have 60ns dram then you should be able to get a little more with
xfree86-2.0, I would expect a 45ns dram card to get >80k xstones.

From the assounding lack of information you have guiven, I would guess you
have a VLB machine with a S3/805 fitted. The problem sounds like a waitstate
mismatch of other VLB related problem.

add :
Option "nomemaccess" 
to your Xconfig and the server will only use IO access.

XS3 was especially broken when it came to localbus, it didn't even try to 
do didrect memory access, and programs the S3 wrongly anyway...

Add more detail and post to comp.windows.x.i386unix if this doesn't fix

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently

from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other

I'm probably just uninformed, but the first I ever saw that paper was
Feb. '93.  I can't imagine it is more than a year older than that.

Getting up to speed on kernel development apparently has been
difficult for the FSF, but I really doubt it had anything to do with
them working on it internally, except to the extent they didn't have
the resources to do so.

Talk about O.S. hairsplitting.... ;-)

You make a good point, though.  Getting something `out the door' can
be difficult when the product is imperfect.  Often momentum is more important 
than the product itself.  My impression was that the FSF (rms
especially) was actually pretty expedient in these matters.

At the risk of being divisive (more than you), I think perhaps some of
the `Linux people' are underestimating the extent we have benefitted from
the FSF's effort.  There is more to an O.S. than device drivers.

Sure, for single user systems, with kernel source code and/or loadable kernel
servers, the practical advantage of the Hurd device-driver is reduced
-- but there are lots of other Mach'ism that Linux doesn't even
approximate:  multithreading, multiprocessing, distributed MMUs,
multiple O.S. personalities, external everything, etc..  More than
hacking have gone into Mach.  

Rather than trying to kludge up versions of the Hurd/Mach
functionality for Linux, it seems to me we'd all be better off
taking the information in all those device drivers and adapting them
to Hurd.

Subject: Create your own Slackware Labels
Date: Fri, 5 Nov 1993 11:34:16 GMT


        - Did you download the slackware labels and could not find the 
          AVERY 5196 labels anywhere?

        - Do you have some different labels you would like to use?

        - Do you want labels for the TeX series too?

        - Do you want to define your own labels?

        - You tried to modify those labels and failed?

Well, if any of the above is true and you have TeX, dvips and a PostScript
printer, you might find the program below useful. It creates labels for
Slackware 1.1.0 and is flexible enough to serve as a template to create
labels on whatever paper you might have. To use this, you need the labels
for Slackware prepared by Alan M Buckwalter because you will have to extract
the logo from there. How to do it is explained below. The result is not
identical to his, though I have approximated it a lot.

Enjoy,

Julio

Forgive me if I'm wrong, but don't S3 cards use non-display-used video
ram for caching purposes (for bitblt operations and such). Thus,
wouldnt an extra meg of ram increase the cache size and thus
performance?

Look for one or two empty sockets near the Cache RAM. If you don't find
any, you may look for places were the sockets might go. If you don't
find these tell-tale signs, your motherboard may or may not have the
dirty tag RAM.  Your board may have a write-through Cache and not need
dirty tags.  The only way to tell is with benchmark programs. There was
a DOS program called cachemes.exe published in the german c't'
magazine. I think I can post it next week together with some results.

When did work on the Hurd start?  Late 1980's?  That leaves Linux out
of the way, since Linus didn't even have a PC then, let alone had any
plans (dreams at most) about writing an operating system.  386BSD was
also not much to have at the time, if I remember correctly: it was
still under development, and would not, I think, have been all that
easy to use as the basis of a single-server. 

But then again, perhaps I am mistaken about when work on the Hurd
began.
