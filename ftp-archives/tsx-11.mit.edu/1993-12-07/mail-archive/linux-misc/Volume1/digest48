Some serious comments on your comparison; no flames intended.

jschief@finbol.toppoint.de writes:

   BSD is quite good, but you need more knowledge of unix/bsd 

I don't really believe this.  Linux also requires a fair amount of
Unix-specific knowledge to configure.  For the most part, the default
installation works (as it does in NetBSD also), but it is not enough
to actually run a system well.  You need to configure the network,
sendmail, getty (for serial ports at least), maybe SLIP and/or PPP,
etc., etc.

   for many people Linux is easier to install,

The NetBSD installation process is pretty simple, though it's not what
I ultimately want.  I rather like the SunOS and Ultrix installations,
and a similar installation system is being developed for NetBSD.

   easier in setup,

See above.

   easier in building new kernels, 

Meaning it's interactive?  BSD in general is much easier to configure
after you learn how to read and write config files.  And it's pretty
straightforward.  I config'd a SunOS kernel for the first time without
consulting any man pages; I just looked at the existing config files
and did the obvious thing.

   easier to get drivers for exotic hardware and ...

It is true that there are some pieces of hardware which Linux drivers
but not NetBSD drivers exist for.  Fortunately most of them aren't
very popular (or perhaps that's why we don't have drivers for them
yet), so this is not a major drawback.  If I had any of them, I would
endeavour to rectify the situation.  (Consider that a hint to anyone
with more money than me.)

   faster in development (this includes : find & produce bugs)

That's not clear.  There is a fundamental difference between Linux and
NetBSD in this, however; while Linus and others involved in Linux
(Peter MacDonald, the authors of various packages, etc.) are willing
to make new releases very frequently, there is little organization.
In my experience, very few users actually want to update their systems
a few times a month (or for that matter, possibly a new version of
some program or other every single day).  We (the NetBSD group)
endeavour to organize more coherent releases.  In particular, we like
to make sure everything at least minimally works; SLS releases have
often contained non-functional programs.

For people who want frequent updates, we have our current source tree
available by FTP and SUP.  The publicly available sources are updated
nightly from our working CVS tree, and usually work a bit better than
the releases.  (The work doesn't ever stop; we've made many changes
even since the 0.9 sources were pretty much frozen.)

   and easier to get (SLS, MCC, SLA....)

NetBSD is not as many FTP sites, but it is certainly not hard to get,
for anybody on the net, at least.  By the time 1.0 is released, there
will be a CD-ROM distribution.


One serious advantage of NetBSD for me is that it runs on multiple
platforms.  I now have a HP 370 (68030-based machine) happily running
a complete NetBSD system, and it's actually significantly faster than
my 386.  There are several other ports in progress, some of which are
running.  Hopefully we will have a few of them in our common source
tree for the 1.0 release.

Look,  run an 'iozone auto' and THEN do the comparison.  A 30 Second
test in a multi-user OS doesn't show shit.

'iozone auto' Will run files of like 1,4,8,&16MB with block sizes of 512
1K, 2K, 4K, and 8K, back to back.  *THEN* you will have something to
compare with.

It's really annoying how Linux users have forgotten how to produce good

trying to write to that partition?  Send me the whole of your config

And it should make no attempt to run on a 286.  Apart from the fact that

Uh, the 3401 is a SCSI CD-ROM.  Just plug it in on a supported

Some have, some haven't.

The initialization code has been fixed to handle the 1542C correctly 
in most cases.  However, some of the enhanced BIOS options scramble 
things in a way that is incompatable with the Linux driver, and some
people have reported problems with Linux after 

- Using one of the BIOS auto-probe options

- Using a BIOS extended translation

- Using BIOS support for more than two drives

>Is anyone using the 1542C successfully?

Many people have been succesfull, as long as they haven't gotten into 
the more exotic BIOS options.

No, there were multiple problems.

1.  The order of initializing things needed to change, meaning Adaptec 1542B
    drivers didn't work with the C revision.  This bug hit Linux, NetBSD, 
    Windows NT, and a large number of other systems.  

    It was rapidly fixed.       

2.  People still report problems with a few of the BIOS options 
    doing things that keep the Linux drivers from initializing 
    correctly.

    In any case, a configuration change fixes things.

There's nothing that says a ribbon cable isn't going to have the same
impedance problem as round cable.  Also, a lot of round cable is shielded
while most (I've seen shielded ribbon in a few cases) ribbon cable is 
unshielded, and will be prone to noise hits especially at 10Mhz FAST
SCSI-II speeds (I've seen workstations that don't work because of parity 
errors when running the bus over 8M/sec).

Absolutely.  :-)

Seriously, though, pl10 isn't really *that* old.  But then, things move fast

Well, since I haven't seen NT run, I can't really say how big the whole

That's probably true.  However, there's data space to consider in the RAM

This may be slightly pedantic, but he's right.  Using spherical
trig gives a distance of ~8900 miles.

You can figure it out like this.  For a spherical triangle, the
law of cosines is:

  cos c = cos a cos b + sin a sin b cos C

where a and b are two sides of the triangle, C is the included
angle, and c is the side opposite C.  All sides in a spherical
triangle are measured by angles.

So to cut the story short a bit, using 39 S, 145 E for the
coordinates of Melbourne (these are really rough since I just
interpolated them from an atlas), and 30 16' N, 97 45' for
Austin (from a reference), you get:

  cos c = cos (90 - (-39)) * cos (90 - 30 16') +
          sin (90 - (-39)) * sin (90 - 30 16') * cos (-145 - 97 45')

which works out to an angle of about 128 degrees.  To find miles
from this, you have to multiply it by the number of miles in a
degree, which is

  7926 mi * pi / 360 degrees = 69.17 mi per degree

since the diameter of the Earth is ~7926 miles.  This produces a
result of ~8900 miles.

>Australia shouldn't be 8000.  Besides, going around the globe is around

Your figures are off by two.  If you go around the world 12,000
miles in any direction, you automatically end up at the antipode
of your origin, the point on the Earth exactly opposite you.

8900 miles is still hard to beat, though.  For me to dial to the
other end of the Earth, I'd have to dial up somewhere in Botswana,
Africa.  Anybody have any SLIP numbers to dial there? :-)
