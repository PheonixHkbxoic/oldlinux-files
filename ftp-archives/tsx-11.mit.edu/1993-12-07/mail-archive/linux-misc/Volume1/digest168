Ya can always look at the linux kernel source and find out!

From observations on various machines, BogoMips = (approx) CPU_Mhz / 2

| 2.  What is a BogoMip?

MIPS is short for Millions of Instructions Per Second.  It is a
measure for the computation speed of a program.  Like most such
measures, it is more often abused than used properly (it is very
difficult to justly compare MIPS for different kinds of computers).

BogoMips are Linus's invention.  The kernel (or was it a device
driver?) needs a timing loop (the time is too short and/or needs to be
too exact for a non-busy-loop method of waiting), which must be
calibrated to the processor speed of the machine.  Hence, the kernel
measures at boot time how fast a certain kind of busy loop runs on a
computer.  "Bogo" comes from "bogus", i.e, something which is a fake.
(See the Jargon File for more information.)  Hence, the BogoMips value
gives some indication of the processor speed, but it is way too
unscientific to be called anything but BogoMips.

The reasons (there are two) it is printed during bootup is that a) it
is slightly useful for debugging and for checking that the computers
caches and turbo button work, and b) Linus loves to chuckle when he
sees confused people on the news.

My machine is 386DX33, 8 MB, 64 kB memory cache, 109 MB IDE, 12 MB
swap partition, about 5.99 BogoMips.  I think your BogoMips sound
reasonable.  

What is "forever"?  My kernel compiles take around 20 min (depending
on configuration options), when not running anything else (i.e., no
X).  If yours are significantly slower, there might be something wrong
in your setup.  Are your swaps files or partitions?  Partitions are
much faster.

Subject: [A]: RAWDISK.SYS bugfixed version 1.1
Date: 29 Sep 93 15:44:45 GMT


I'm announcing the bugfixed version 1.1 of RAWDISK.SYS in this newsgroup,
because I know a lot of people with tape drives not supported (either by
type or by using older kernels etc.) are using this DOS device driver for
backup of their Unix disk/partition.

RAWDISK.SYS v1.1 is available by anonymous ftp from:

ftp.uni-duisburg.de: /pub/pc/misc/rawdsk11.zip
login: anonymous,  password: e-mail address


Version 1.1 of RAWDISK.SYS (raw disk device driver for DOS)
fixes the following two bugs:

1. DR-DOS's CHKDSK complains about an illegal drive for RAWDISK.DRV.

2. Successful restore of a backup was prevented by version 1.0 under
   certain circumstances:

   if the program you use for restore (ie that writes to the disk via
   RAWDISK.SYS) wrote an updated directory entry first before reading
   the FAT to get the available bytes on the drive, RAWDISK.SYS returned
   a virtual FAT indicating a full drive. This prevented successful
   restore.

Both bugs are fixed.

BTW, RAWDISK.SYS is a DOS device driver, that maps an arbitrary
portion of a harddisk (given by a start- and endcylinder) onto a
logical DOS drive. The HD area is accessed (read or written)
through a regular DOS file. Logical drive administration areas
(bootsector, FAT and rootdirectory) are totally virtual, hence
no additional HD space is required.

sorry for the inconvenience,
Juergen

Just wait - its underway - first tests looks pretty promising. There is

These sound like 386's, for which the divisor is more like 6 or 8.  If
you guys give your processor and megahertzage we can decide which.
Looking at an AMD386SXL/25 just now I see 2.9 Bogomips, while a
486SLC2/50 (25 Mhz external) is saying 14.6, and a 486DX-33 gives
16.6.  For reasons I *completely* do not understand, turning off Turbo
reduces the SLC to only 14.2 while the DX drops to 3.67.  This makes no
sense to me.
