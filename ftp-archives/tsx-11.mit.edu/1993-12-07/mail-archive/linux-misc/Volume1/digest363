On sunsite you can find GO32CRS.TGZ in the Linux-tree in DEVEL/MSDOS.
I quote GO32CRS.LSM:
                Cross-compiling, MS-DOS
                It is not a different compiler, all I did was to put
                together a lot of tools that let you create MS-DOS
                programs under Linux. When go32 and dosemu understand
                each other the thing would be more useful.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.

Ok, that might work for some users. I am thinking of installations, where
        a) many people should have access to that PC as normal users
        b) they are encouraged to use floppies for backup etc.

I want to protect the system against booting from floppy (not actually bad in
itself) or moreover against other prople mounting the root filesystem
from other OS'es they boot.

Luckily my own PC has
        a) a Lock to lock the whole box against opening
        b) a BIOS that allows restricting the boot to the harddisk.
But other might not, or it may not be feasible to implment it that way.

That's why I asked.

Thx nonetheless

There *is* nobody official who could do it -- that's why it can only
evolve into reality through consensus. Magnus seems to be steering
things in the right direction for that. All organizations, official or
otherwise, are formed by a group of people getting together and
collectively stating, "We are hereby an organization." There was never
any other way. Officialdom is granted to an organization from the
outside, something that the proposed Linux Consortium can fortunately
forego entirely (who would grant us officialdom? IEEE? ISO? ACM?
UNESCO?). All it takes is for us -- Linux users, developers and
distributors -- to get together and collectively state, "We are hereby
an organization." This is exactly what Magnus is trying to lead up to,
as I have understood it. Once the organization has created itself,
then all else is logistics: decide who might best be qualified to do
some testing *on behalf of the organization* and such.

Subject: [Q] Possible to repaire PATITION
Date: Thu, 2 Dec 1993 13:28:00 GMT

Hi!

Last night I did something incredible stupid! (I guess I was tired,
that's an excuse ...right ?).

I was going to run iozone on my scsi disk /dev/sda1, and I did'nt 
really remember the syntax, so I just wrote:

iozone 1 /dev/sda1 (trying to run it on dev/sda1...)

This caused the whole system to hang!

I guess the syntax is: iozone <file size> <file name>, that is
iozone writes file size bytes to file name...

So, I guess i have written directly to the patition!

After rebooting, I could'nt mount the scsi patition (I've got an 
bootable AT patition).
mount -t ext2 /dev/sda1 /usr
> VFS: Can't find an ext2 filesystem on dev 0x081
> mount: mount( dev/sda1, /usr ) faild: Device or resource busy

I then tried to run:
e2fsck -r /dev/sda1
> :bad magic number in super-block

So, the basic question is: Am I fucked, or is there some way out
of this...
Some way to repaire the ext2fs patition..? Any suggestions...?

-Kristian.

[The abovementioned package has some other nice security features,

What about including COPS in the standard distributions? Should not
be too hard to do and would certainly improve the security of what is
becoming one of the most popular OSs around (despite the damage the
mentioned security problems are doing to its reputation).

Most of todays multiprocessor OS's can indeed give a job only to
one processor.  In other words, if you run some calculations on
a machine with 4 486's, it won't be faster, than when you run it on
your PC with 1 486 (if clocks are the same, etc.).

However, most modern Unix'es do no longer create a fixed process to
processor mapping.  Any process can run on any available processor.

Allowing one job to be executed by multiple processors in parallel
requires lots of synchronization for data to be available, etc.
There are experimental compilers for computers like the connection
machine, etc.  Perhaps, they are much more ALPHA than anything of
Linux.

Most multiprocessor machines marketed today have their use as
terminal, database, or whatever servers only.  You get a good,
maybe even linear speedup here, because of the big number of
connections and thus jobs running.

You may also see some speedup, where processing is done by seperate
processes.  Think of X server and X client, which then can be run
on seperate processors.  Or use the "-pipe" option with the gcc
compiler, which will run the preprocessor, the main compiler and
the assembler at the same time.  This options even speeds things
up on a single user system - when the preprocessor waits for the
disk to read a certain file, the compiler can start with its work,
etc.

The problem is, that the SVGA - Mode switching is done by BIOS.  Well,
after starting Linux, BIOS is mostly disabled, except for DOSEMU.

I would like to have different SVGA - Modes on different VC's.  I
know, it is possible, because I can have graphics mode and X on
VC 7, DOSEMU and 80x25 on VC 4, and 100x40 on all others.

A possible way of implementing a free graphics mode switch, is to write a
DOS programme, which reads and saves the SVGA registers, and a Linux system
call, which sets the SVGA registers to the saved values.

But why not go for the real thing?  X allows you to specify modes with
any number of lines, columns and frequencies.  Why not allow the same
for VC's?

Just a thought.
