Furthur. DON'T sort people by address. Sort it by longitude/latitude.
Most people can work out their long/lat without too much difficulty

Actually there is a valid point here because Peter has prohibited
Slackware from makeing further realeases because they use his sysinstal
script, which he is not allowing Slackware to use from what I understand.

So a free sysinstall anyone can use would be great!

Subject: question about DOS emulator
Date: Fri, 20 Aug 1993 01:23:26 GMT

I'm an upcoming consultant that is considering (very strongly) recommending 
LINUX to my clients as a secondary operating system. 

I've got two questions about the DOS emulator. (For the moment, let's assume
I can get it compiled correctly and I'm using the newest versions of 
everything.) The first is, how good is it, really? (in other words, can it
really run the majority of DOS stuff, including graphics programs etc?) I am
aware that some previous versions weren't all that terribly wonderful, but
I haven't been following it lately.

The second is, can it run under Xwindows?

My apologies for not just shoving it on my own machine and trying it myself to
see, but I'm presently stuck with very old equipment that can't run Linux. 
<whimper>

Thanx,
        Tom

Ok, that does it. Those linux fanatics are even worse than the OS/2
ones. At least the OS/2 fanatics are not as vulgar. Microsloath, they
say. What a pathetic crowd. Why are you bitter? For months we've been
listening to you embellish about how great your pitiful os is, and we
said nothing. Now our great os is here and we're proud of it. Not only
that, in a maater of months it'll completely bury the scum you call os
that you have.

Angry that after all the gloat about how lean and mean linux is, NT's
kernel is less one fifth that size? Tough! Or that your file system
falters more often than it works? (how many times a day does the extfs
get corrupted?) For crying out loud, you even have to recompile the
whole os in order to add the littlest of drivers!

You know what your problem is? You stare at your os too much! I mean,
let's face it, you have *NO* applcations, and as such all you can do
is gaze at your os, and hence slowly you acquire an unpalatable taste
for it! They have drag and drop they say! Well, name *one* application
where you can actually drag something and drop into another app. You
don't even have a file manager for pete's sake!

We don't mind the os as much as long as it get the job done. And we
have the tools for that, none of which you have, or ever will. Do you
have Winword? Word perfect? Lotus 123? *Any* spreadsheet? Procomm?
Xtalk? Go figure. And on top of that we now have the superior os!

As far as I can tell, the chekclist is correct. It wasn't even posted
to your group for crying out loud! Whay are so offended? so bitter? so
vulgar? Go play elsewhere with your toy os! Don't bother us in our
group.

P.S. I have nothing to do with that checklist.

If your client is not going to run Windows you can make Linux your primary
operating system. With DOS as a spare for anything DOSEMU just won't do.

It's a very good idea. However you do need to stress to clients that it is 
BETA software albeit the best BETA software I've ever seen in my life.
So you'll have the promise and follow through on support. 

I'm doing the same thing. Starting with my department's administrative staff
at Clark Atlanta University.

You can get it compiled. Install one of the latest distributions and get the 
current version at tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/ALPHA/dosemu/current/*.

The current version there if 0.49pl1.

Also it runs on pl10 kernels and better. Of course I recommend pl12.

It's good. It's better that real DOS for the following reasons:

- It doesn't tie up your machine exclusively. You can still do all the
  underlying Unix stuff.
- Since it's a Linux process you can have multiple DOSEMU sessions running
  at once.
- It shares resources now. Your clients will be able to print to a network
  printer for example.
- Due to the most excellent emufs.sys driver DOSEMU sessions have access
  to underlying Linux fs including Network FS. 

In other words it not only gives you DOS but multitasking and the same
level of networking as Novell.

Now it does have a downside. It's not real DOS so it doesn't have immediate
and exclusive access to the physical resources of the machine. So things
like speakers, floppy disks, printer and serial ports will seem sluggish
at times. Think of it as Virtual DOS - It's not the Real Thing (tm).

>really run the majority of DOS stuff, including graphics programs etc?) I am

Text stuff is excellent. I haven't tested it with any graphics programs yet.
Any suggestions?

>
>The second is, can it run under Xwindows?

Yes. But 2 caveats I see so far:

1) The function keys don't work for me.
2) I wouldn't expect any graphics in an Xwindow.

But to be honest it looks best and works best in a Virtual Console. I can't
tell it apart from real DOS.

><whimper>

Well my advise (which I should start charging for like Ed Carp does ;-)

- You'll need to test extensively each application you want to run on DOSEMU.
  It's still ALPHA software in it's last release. Don't assume because it
  runs some things well that It'll run everything well. For example DOSEMU
  locks up when you select a drop down menu from DOS 5.0 EDIT/QBASIC. Why?
  I don't know.

- Ask you client for a list of applications that they plan to run under DOS.
  It wouldn't be unfair to ask for a test machine also. Then test, test,test
  and test.

- Again be up front with your client.

This is what I've been doing all week . I have 3 converts with one more 
meeting to go.

But when you have DOS, Unix, X windows, and networking all going on at
once, any client will be impressed. And don't forget to put up a cool
GIF in the root Xwindow!

Good Luck,

BAJ

Yes he can. He wrote the scripts. They are his. 

Now what he cannot do is try to copyright that look and feel thang. If
one of us writes an installation script and looks and acts like the SLS
one then he cannot claim copyright infringement. That's why Slackware
can have series disks and .tgz packages in dos format. It's an idea not
an artifact. sysinstall and doinstall however are software artifacts that
are not based on previous work. Therefore they are Peter's and he can
copyright them. Whether he should or not is up for debate however.

In fact what he's saying is that SLS is the scripts. So if you use the
scripts it must be called SLS. That sounds resonable to me.

Writing an installation script is not rocket scientist material. Someone
should spend an afternoon and just write one. Please don't try to select
me because my wife and kids are coming back from a two week trip tomorrow
and I won't have time for anything in the next few days. All I have time
to do right now is shuffle information and proffer suggestions.

I've noticed that Patrick hasn't had anything to say. He's probably writing
a script even as we speak. What you may want to do instead of whining about
Peter and his copyrights is post what features you'd like to see in an
installation script. I can tell you for a fact that even if he isn't posting
he's out there listening.

Later,

BAJ

 What's against the GPL?

 I never looked at this sysinatll stuff, but it appears to just be sh

I'm curious, why hasn't anybody suggested trying to use a GIS for this?

 Perhaps GRASS might work?  I don't know much about GRASS, except I see it's
ported to Linux.

 After all it's a map.  Shouldn't a map be done using a GIS?

We have a spreadsheet called sc and a plethora of comm programs.

If you feel the checklist is correct you've obviously haven't used Linux
in a LONG time, if ever.

The original post I saw was cross posted to comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy
and comp.os.linux.misc.  I'm not offended.  I'm not bitter.  I'm not
vulgar.

Well, just as flame bait (and at the risk of contradicting that I'm
not vulgar) I can't resist this:

#Linux:[50]/> ls -l /etc/NT
lrwxrwxrwx   1 bin      bin             4 Jul 11 18:23 /etc/NT -> null
#Linux:[51]/> _

 -A  all flames to /dev/NT please

Please, let's not try to stereotype so much.

Debatable.  I hardly think that NT will take over all operating systems.

With just the microkernel, you can't do anything.  Microkernel
architecture has it's advantages and disadvantages.

I have never had a fs corruption under Linux.  Most messages you see are
about *possible* corruptions, and most corruption that happens is
not IMHO, a result of the FS code.  No filesystem is immune to
disk corruption (redundancy may help however).

Yes, that may change.  At least I can compile my OS ;-)

A base unix system comes with most of the apps one needs.  Everything
else is addon and customization.  It's not linux people write all
the apps for the OS, there is a very large base of Unix apps that
source is available for.  And for those apps that source is not
available, people are working on that too (Wabi/Wine).

Se above, it's not like there is only one GUI for Linux.

You are speaking of specific companies, not ways to get work done.
I admit, a better word processor than what is available now would
be nice.  However, there are WP, spreadsheets, comm programs ...
Almost all the tools a Unix user needs.

HA!!!!  This is why I really posted.  Where did you get the idea that
the checklist was correct?  It had more wrong than right and was
clearly the work of a very biased person, or maybe purely flamebait
as BAJ put it.  I will leave it to others to make the corrections
(many have already been made).

Because they are lies!

Note, I really thing we are talking about different markets here
anyway.  If I just wanted to do wordprocessing and balance my
budget on a spreadsheet, than Windows (why NT?) may be the
way to go.  If you are in a different environment, like
academia or the parts of the commercial world where Unix is
used, then Linux would be a much better choice.
   I need to do TCP/IP network programming on a limited budget,
so Linux is for me.


Also be aware that many of your arguments against Linux are
also against Unix in general.  It is not an isolated OS, there
are many, many variants of Unix used everywhere.
