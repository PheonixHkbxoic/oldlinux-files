I tried it out. It's dead easy to port. Nothing to do except set the right
stuff up in the Makefile and mess with a few #defines. 
Even the garbage collector works out of the box (the generic version). I never ported 
the debugger. That requires having the source for some ancient version of gdb which I
could not find. The current version of gdb has a sufficiently different structure to
make it a pain to try and do anything there unless you really understand gdb inside 
out (I don't).

You will find that you probably need at least 16MB of physical memory for compiling
any reasonable sized system. The compiler when compiling itself pages itself to
death on my machine (8MB). Make sure you have plenty of swap. I needed 24MB.

I am not using it anymore at the moment and don't have it anymore on my system
otherwise I would send you the diffs. I think you need fiddle with the CFLAGS.
Maybe you need to add -DPOSIX_SOURCE are something like that. You probably
need the usual kludge somewhere with the Non posix signals. 

PS. It was something like v0.2i which I tried.

Subject: 68875 on the ATI Graphics Ultra Pro?
Date: Tue, 26 Oct 1993 09:31:16 GMT


After some research I have decided to buy an ATI Graphics Ultra Pro with
2 MB di VRAM. My objective is to obtain a resolution of 1280x1024x256
with a vertical scan frequency >= 72Hz on my system running SCO Open Desktop.

The SCO Hardware Compatibility Handbook indicates that both the above
graphic board and resolution are supported.
BUT, looking at configuration files of the X server one discovers
that the graphic board is supported ONLY IF AN ATI 68875 DAC IS PRESENT.
                                               -------------

This does not correspond to the specification data sheets of the board,
where there is no mention at all of the 68875, while it is guaranteed
the possibility of using the mode 1280x1024x256 between 43.5 and 74 Hz.

The local vendor, when asked about this confusion, said that the 68875
chip is not originally present on the board but it is installed by
the manufacturer when repairing malfunctioning boards (?!?!).
Any attempt to get a more sensible answer failed.

Needless to say now I am totally confused.
Can anybody help me solving this enigma?
Or, does anybody know some Email address of ATI people?

Please, respond by Email. I will forward the pointers I get to whoever
is interested.
Thanks in advance

It's probably just a resource line that sets the expert flag. Try
pressing the 'x' key over the xdvi window, and see if the buttons come
to life. If they do, you'll have to find a line in an Xdefaults or
Xresources file which specifies something like (I'm guessing):

and take it out.

If pressing 'x' doesn't reveal the buttons, something funny is up, and

I have installed linux on a 386/33 using a 120Meg IDE.  I have two serial ports and one
parallel port on the serial card.  I have a mouse connected to COM1 and an internal modem to COM2 which are configured to IRQ 3 and 4 respectively.  And the parallel port is inherently set for IRQ7.  However when i boot linux, it comes up with a message saying -- Wild interrup IRQ7.  

I disabled the COM2 on my serial card thinking it may be interfering.  But that was
not the case.  Could it be my serial card?  Can anybody help me in solving this problem.

Lots of good stuff deleted.

   When the above number [RSA129] was published, it was believed that it would
   take hundreds, if not hundreds of thousands of years to factor the
   number.  Since that time, people have found better methods to factor
   numbers.  More importantly, people are now able to use the idle cpu
   time of hundreds, if not thousands of computers to work on the problem
   in parallel.  If you can convince a million people to let you use
   their computers for free for 12hrs per day, you can factor these very
   large numbers fairly quickly.  

Actually, given only ten thousand you can do it in days, but the idea is
sound.

   By factoring this large number, it would show that in order for the
   RSA system to be really secure, you need to pick larger numbers than
   "just" 129 digits.  This isn't hard to do, but it slows down the
   encryption/decryption a little bit more.  Factoring a number that is
   twice as large (2 times the number, not 2 times as many digits) takes
   4 times as long (approx).  This means that if you had a 130 digit
   number, it would take 100 times as long to factor.  If it can be shown

Nope.  Factoring is much easier than that.  Rather than merely
multiplying by two for a four-fold increase in factoring time, the true
multiplier is closer to a *million*.  That is, you can increase the
number of digits by about 6 or 7.  This assumes current algorithms, of
course, and that the extrapolations aren't over too big a range.

   that it is technically possible to factor a 129 digit number, people
   will just pick 150 or 200 digit numbers instead.

150-digit numbers are on the verge of being crackable at sensible cost.
The current state of the art is 130-digits; the larger ones are about a
hundred times more expensive.  200-digit is safe for a while yet.

   So, this is mostly an academic exercise to prove how that it is now
   possible to factor numbers in the 129 digit range.  There is also a
   $100 prize, but I doubt that the money is the motivating factor for
   anyone.  

The fame and the glory are far more important than the fortune!
The prize money, should we win it, will be donated to the GNU project.
Attempting to split it equably between the participants would be an
exercise of monumental futility.

OK. We've established that a Bogomip is a good way to see if your system is
running in the right mode. Now how's about a real set of benchmarks to compare
system performance. It should encompass all aspects of the system (CPU speed,
memory size and access time, video access speed, disk access speed). In 
addition each of these factors should be able to be separated from the
others somehow. This is so I can compare disk subsystem performance across
several motherboards for example.

Any other ideas?

Wing commander could be a bad example.  WC doesn't need an OS because can cannot
afford to have an OS under it (because it needs every last drop of the fixed
hardware environment to itself).  But for programs like that, which are
designed to runs with an OS, and use 100% of the hardware, then MS-"DOS" is
fine (program loader).

Why not?  I mean, nobody expects one platform to run EVERYTHING, but this
scenario is bound to happen on Unix platforms (much of it is already done):
[At least for X86 Unix platforms]

Run native software - run not emulate
Run COFF/SCO/ISC software - run not emulate
Run ELF/V4.X software  - run not emulate
Run MS-"Windows" binaries through WABI/WINE - run not emulate
Run MS-"DOS" software through emulation (no way around that!)
Run Apple MAC software through emulation
 
Every one of these (or more than one) is available on one Unix platform or
another.  It shouldn't be too long now when at least one flavor will have all of
the above features!

        Well, I'm going to go WAY out on a limb here and beg to differ
with alot of this discussion. Basically, since disk space is always
limited I think it's a good idea to start off with double the amout of
real memory for swap. Usually, if you are swaped beyond that point you
have idle processes that could be killed or are really mutlitasking
too much. Ask yourself how many interactive things you really need to
attend to. (Remember, small is beautiful ;)
        That being said for what is probably the minium requirements
go ahead and give yourself whatever extra you can afford. Like
anything else it is better to have too much than too little. However,
not everyone should run out and get more swap simply because everyone
who posted has a huge swap partion. I live comfortably in 11MB, (4
real, 7 swap). Of course, I don't run x11 either.
        Setting up swap and partioning disks is one of those nasty
things that take a bit of practice and a knowledge of what you're
doing. If all you want to do is log in and have one interactive
session going on the console you don't need much memory. If you want
to fire up dosemu, x, groff, and recompile the kernel than yes you
need lots of swap.

>:

        Well, this is a matter of opinion I suppose but you should
ALWAYS have swap. The reason is, unix-type systems are designed with
the idea that they will have to handle swap space. And, in fact, the
swapping that usually occurs is quite painless and unnoticable.
Running a machine which never swaps is not using the os to its fullest
potential and is possibly an idication that you have wasted money on
uneeded memory. (Of course, if you can afford memory or are using all
of yours constanly adding more is reasonable)
        Frankly, I'm surprised you can deal with having 32MB swapped
out on an 8 meg system. I would hazard to guess that not everthing is
activly demanding resources otherwise you would be getting periously
close to trashing.

        I wonder, is anyone using swap partions on different drives to

        Of course, in this case there are 60 megs of free swap. I also
see X running and a number of other goodies running ;) Having the
extra swap is good in that it alows a painless upgrade path in the
future but I still want to emphesize that there really is no need to
go overboard if you can't afford it. 60 megs is quite a bit of space
for me so I would much rather keep as much as I can in user files. Of
course, I'm also perfectly willing to both kill processes and give up
the machine for a while when memory gets low.
