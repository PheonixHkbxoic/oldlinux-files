I'm running a bit short of disk space on the monu1.cc.monash.edu.au linux
archive. I'm considering deleting the SLS distribution from there and
keeping slackware (and everything else that's there).

Opinions anyone?

   I use vile which is mostly vi compatible (:map support is weak, but being 
   worked on), but has the added advantage of providing multiple buffers 
   (pulled from microemacs). You can get the source from ftp.cayman.com:/pub/vile/
   or a binary from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/apps/editors/vile-3.61-bin.tar.gz

One alternative is to use EMACS in vi-mode with the VIP package. One
can invoke it by: <ESC>-x followed by typing "vip". I'm not a vi user
nor have I used vip but I understand it's quite good.

Reply-To: Martin.Kraemer@mch.sni.de

Hello dear Fellow-Linuxers,

This is a Request For Comments:

On the  linux console, the function keys F11  and F12 now are programmed to
send  the same strings as Shift-F1 and Shift-F2. I think that this solution
is ``sub-optimal''. It occurs  (I think) with all national  keyboard types,
so this is a topic that should be solved once for all nationalities.

IMHO, _all_ function keys should  send mutually different strings and _all_
function keys should send "even more different" strings when shifted. But:

* At the moment, F11 and F12 send the same strings as Shift-F1 and Shift-F2
  Such a clash should be avoided at all costs.

* F11 and F12 send the same strings no matter if you shift them or not. The
  keys F1...F10, however,  send different strings when  shifted. This seems
  sensible, and IMO, F11 and F12 should behave similar.

I  think we should "invent" four more  strings and assign them to F11, F12,
<Shift>F11 and <Shift>F12.

What do _you_ think?

    Martin

    P.S.: [Yes, I _know_ I can do  it for myself, but as it could  become a
    problem for everyone, I think we should find a common solution.]
    BTW: Who's responsible for defining the _standard_ ESC sequences for
    the Linux console?

Problems with IDE-HD Fujitsu M2618T (201MB)

A friend tried to install Linux (SLS 1.03 lx99p12) onto his 4MB (no comment)
HIGHSCREEN (absolutely no comment) 486-DX-33 Laptop.
He installed a 10MB swap-partition. But when installing the
following errors occured:

(several times:)
HD: write_intr: status=0x51
HD: write_intr: error=0x10
(and then:)
HD: do_hd_request: no DRQ
HD_controller_reset

We put his HD into my Computer (20MB 386-DX-40) and tried it again.
But after several disks these errors occured again. The number of errors
was much smaller (because there was nothing to swap?).

Is is possible that the DIP-switches have the wrong position ?
(He doesnot have any instructions concerning the HD.)
The current config is:

Date: 19 Oct 1993 11:34:21 +0100


Here is a summary of the responses I got about internal modems and
possible problems under linux. I've separated the responses according
to the questions that I asked.

1) 16550A UARTs in internal modems
==================================
fred@genesis.demon.co.uk (Lawrence Kirby)
> I don't think it is that common yet to emulate a 16550A. Some emulate a 16450
> but use extra 'invisible' buffering on board. Others use a true 16550A.

denio@GOV.CSS.seismo (Dennis O'Neill)
> Many do, yes.  In fact, the various magazines that do testing recommend
> that users who buy internal modems buy them with real 16550As.

remco@us.ca.aptos.emc (Remco Treffkorn)

2) Rockwell chipset problems with linux
=======================================
fred@genesis.demon.co.uk (Lawrence Kirby)
> I believe these are down to timing as much as anything.

remco@us.ca.aptos.emc (Remco Treffkorn)
> For me they are serious, you might be willing to live with it. Look at it
> this way: Just another thing that can go wrong. Now applay Murphy.

3) Internal modem recommendations
=================================
fred@genesis.demon.co.uk (Lawrence Kirby)
> The Sportster should be fine - it uses a real 16550A.

denio@GOV.CSS.seismo (Dennis O'Neill)
> I've been happy so far with an Intel 14.4i (not their SatisFAXion), which
> is available for around US$175.

mjohnsto@Net.Morse.ditdah (Michael R. Johnston)
> The USR's are the ticket. I use them here exclusively and they're the
> only low-cost one's I've been able to get to work reliably. The ZOOM's
> and others have problems because they try to emulate the Rockwell 
> chipset. I recommend the Sportster.

borsburn@edu.kent.mcs (Bret Orsburn)
Bret emailed me a summary of responses he got when he asked about V.32bis
modems. He's buying a sportster :)

4) Reasons to have an external modem
====================================
"Mark A. Horton" <mahmha@com.crl>
- you can see the LEDs
- not using power and generating heat inside the computer
- no need to switch computer off to reset hung modem
- telephone line isolated from  motherboard (danger from lightning)
- can use it with many different computers

remco@us.ca.aptos.emc (Remco Treffkorn)
- well-defined computer/modem interface for easy trouble shooting
- can test the serial connection separately

5) US modems in the UK
======================
fred@genesis.demon.co.uk (Lawrence Kirby)
> They work but they won't be approved so it is illegal to connect them to the
> PSTN. Why not get a UK model Sportster? They're almost reasonably priced now
> and you'll get a USR warranty and tech. support in the UK.

Conclusions
=========== 
I have decided to go for an external modem. I expect it will be a
sportster, which is one of the cheaper modems in the UK.

I'll try it with my existing serial port (on the motherboard) but I'll
be prepared to upgrade to a 16550A based card.

Thank you all very much for your advice.

                                Mark.

Well, both a subset and a superset, actually. It cannot do some things
real vi can, and it can do a few things real vi can't. Actually the
only thing which really bugs me about elvis is that it cannot edit
large files.

This works for me (haven't tried it on Linux, but it works on DOS,
Minix, Ultrix (yes I am using elvis on Ultrix, not the regular vi).
Maybe you just have a keyboard problem (On a German Keyboard under
MS-DOS you have the press Ctrl-Shift-6 for example).

Maybe you can omit the dot on real vi, but I am quite sure that isn't
documented.

Heh. This is about the first time I've seen the SysVr4 version of
anything called the "real" one.  It is especially humorous for
vi, considering it's origin.

VIP-mode in emacs is pretty close to vi.  If your machine is fast
enough that you don't mind the start up time you might like it.  I
use it fairly often on r4 for files that exceed vi's size limits or
contain nulls or other things that would choke vi.

I've used it once, for 2 minutes. It lacks all the things which makes 
vi a good editor and you get some of the bad things of EMACS (its size and
speed). So I won't consider EMACS a workable option. I switch between vi
and vile. Depending on the machine I work and what I want.
sun3 : vi, because vile is too slow.
hp   : vi, because I don't have the vile-binary for it.
sun4, 486 with Linux : vi for a quick and small job, otherwise
                       vile, unless I want to use mappings or map!pings.

I've played with elvis once but decided not to use it. I can't remember
why. I've never used vim, but from what I heard, it seems to be a good
alternative for vi too.
