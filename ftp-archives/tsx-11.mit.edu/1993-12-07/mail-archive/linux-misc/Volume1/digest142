Probably less than adequate hardware. NMI is used to signal parity or
other memory problems. I used to have a cheap ET4000 card at work
that caused them.

It's not really clear what the kernel should do when it gets one, thus
the message.

I recommend everybody to check out the new Linux CDROM from Trans-Ameritech
(sp?).

They DO answer email, phone and ship the same day. If you live in bay area,
they are in Santa Clara.

Their version has 3 distributions (2 of SLS and 1 slackware) plus 2
uncompressed versions plus 386BSD 0.1 and plenty of DOS/Windos stuff. 
And all that for $30 - what a deal!

Their email is roman@trans-ameritech.com and phone is (408) 727-3883.

Nah, it's a born-again risc: Intel has dropped the following opcodes:
        aaa,aad,aam,aas,bound,daa,das,enter,lea,leave
and implemented the i960 instruction set in their place.  oh, yeah,
it also dynamically translates any x86 code it executes to native i960.
Microsoft paid Linus Torvalds to port Linux to it, which will be their

Well, indirectly it probably came from DOS. The auto_irq.c documentation came
from my brain-damage.  I wrote a comment that was just-plain-wrong and never
went back to check it.

I, too, am seeing timeouts with two SCSI disks and a Tandberg 3600 tape
drive. All are internal with the Tandberg at the end of the chain and 
terminated.  Unfortunately, I'm also seeing 'in2000_abort' with the alpha
version of the IN-2000 driver and the partition table on the second
330 meg drive (where linux lives) is trashed. I can't even do an fdisk write
without hanging the system.

I'm using a TANDBERG TDC 3820 SCSI tape drive (150-525 MB) connected
to a AH1542B.

This tape drive is just great, very fast, not very noisy ...

BUT, using the 99PL12 kernel, I'm having the following problem:

When writing a tape, it doesn't stream, i.e. the tape drive is winding
back and forth after writing one block (or maybe after writing the
buffer to the tape - 256k).

I used to have this problem a while ago with some 98.* kernels.
With 99p9, it worked perfectly well after setting
the block-size and density to the default values (mt setblk 512
and mt setdensity 0), even though the TDC 3820 uses 1024b-blocks for
525MB-Tapes.

But even though, I think it's a very good tape drive -- a lot of
friends of mine are using without any problems (not running Linux ...)

So be warned :-(

If anyone has a hint how to fix this, drop me a mail ...

peter

BTW, the blacklist-entry in linux/kernel/blk_drv/scsi/scsi.c
of the TANDBERG TDC 3600 when using LUN !=0 doesn't help since
my tape is using LUN 0.

That's where most of it is!!! - in the buffer cache.
You really have used about 3M from your 15M.
Buffers is your cache for mounted block devices. (Disk, floppy, CD)
This will shrink when you start to use memory for other processes. 
This is all perfectly normal and good!

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in

Hello.

Has anyone tried out a Gigabyte Eisa/VL motherboard with 
UMC-chipset. I was offered this board form several vendors
in Hamburg/germany.

I have seen a test of a Gigabyte Eisa/VL board but with 
SIS-chipset ( this board had a pretty fast memoryinterface).

If you have any information on the following questions 

please mail:     guldager@daimi.aau.dk.

How is the compatibility ? 
Is the Eisa-bus fully 32 bit ?
Will ATI's Graphics Ultra Pro run with this chipset ?

How is the EISA performance ?
How is the VL performance ?
How is the memory performance ? 
 ( maybe testet with Cachemess from the German CT'magazin ? )


Thanks.

Sorry for crossposting but this seems to be a real FAQ.

I fought for two weeks (well, some evenings) to get lpr to work
after installing SLS 1.03. I got several mails to help me, all
suggesting contradictory things to do.
I created directories, links and changed permissions, changing almost every
thing, read all FAQs twice, at no effect.

When I *only* installed the lpr from the slackware distribution
over the SLS one, suddenly all was fine. So for safety I installed the
whole slackware lpr package.

SLS lpr needs lib.so.4.3.1
Slackware lpr needs lib.so.4.4.1
SLS 1.03 has lib.so.4.4.1, so it should have worked !?

I don't say anything against SLS as a whole, but the lpr stuff
should be corrected somehow.

        The problem is that the in2000 driver is written to only handle one
outstanding command at a time.  If you attempt to use the tape drive, then you
effectively block access to the disk drives until the tape finishes.  At some
point, someone should update the in2000 driver to handle more than one
outstanding command at one time - once this happens, then using a tape drive on
this system will work much better.
