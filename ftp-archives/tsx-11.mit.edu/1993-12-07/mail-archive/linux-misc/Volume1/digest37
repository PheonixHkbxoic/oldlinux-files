Sorry, didn't mean to imply that you had anything more in common than both
having accounts at LaUNChpad.  There wasn't really any need to mention you,
it was just by finding your post that I found the site that the path implied.

I recall seeing some articles by you on the linux side in regards to the GPL 
(ie in fervent support of it) so you'd have to be a little schizophrenic to 
be supporting NT, much less frothing at the mouth over it.

Should have made it clear in my post, again, my apologies.

Pardon me? COMMAND.COM is 52925 bytes! That's (over) 51K.
As for the memory required, I have heard it takes 16M to fire it up
before you run anything. Excuse me, but I don't want to buy $1500 in
ram just to run a $150 operating system.
To say that NT's networking is stable is also a joke. This is the
company whose ``mission critical'' Windows for Workgoups has the 
unfortunate habit of losing files in the ether (see the current
Byte). Network managers (as noted in Lan Times) are wondering
how on earth this turkey will fly over the network.
MicroSquish is the company whose networking operating system is widely
regarded as inferior to the leading Novell Netware (Lan Times).

That little ``release'' is nothing more than another volley in the
MS disinformation/publicity campaign.

Subject: How are the Linux Packages put Together?
Date: 22 Aug 1993 00:01:23 GMT

With the recent concern over copyright I have been curious about
how the various packages are put together, and how they get put up
on, say, tsx-11 and sunsite. As I  understand it, Linux is the product
of a number of volunteers essentially working independently. By Linux
I mean the whole package including the FSF parts and the kernel, and
anything else that might comprise one of the packages.

When a new version of, say, dosemu comes out, I suppose it is put
up onto one of the sites. How is it determined what parts of that
package are to go into the overall package that is labelled SLS1.03
for example. When there is a package of that name on tsx-11 how does
it get over to sunsite? How could it be that the two versions might not
be the same, and some differences might persist for over a week?

If someone is selling Linux packaged, and presumably making enough
profit to continue in that endeavor, how can that effort be reconciled
with a free offering? Somewhere I think I remember reading that the
offering on tsx-11 might not be identical to that sold in the bundled
disk form.

In the two packaged versions I have downloaded I have found little
problems that would have been found if anyone had tested out the
package after putting it up for distribution. That worries me.

Just think about it, Ian:  if SLIP encapsulation over AX.25 counts, all we
need do is wait for the Lunar digipeater they keep talking about and then send

One thing at a time. No one put a gun to my head and said "Run Linux
or Die". I started using it when it first came out and I heard about
it on comp.os.minix. It wasn't really useful, then, so your "sheep"
comment doesn't really make any sense. Linux is, and always will be,
a free Unix.

About QIC80 support: there ARE drivers out there, you just have to
be brave to use them. Most of the problems with QIC80 drives come
from the fact that the hardware design is an incomprehensible
piece of garbage that depended on the faults of DOS. Real computers
use SCSI.

Well, don't crosspost needlessly (like your article is). You really

NT is vaproware. Where is the shrink-wrap version? Egghead? Not!

The QIC-80 driver is loadable.  You can install it today, along with
your new Diamond SpeedStar NT drivers (not).

In case you don't know, xfm has a drag-and-drop interface, as well as
Motif.

Personally, I don't use the emulator, but it sure is amazing compared
to what it used to be. The shame is that MS software uses undocumented
programming hooks that make DOS and Windows very hard to duplicate
without a licen$ing agreement. This same proprietary rigging of DOS
is what has gotten MS in trouble with the FTC.

DOS device drivers are so nice, they reduce the amount of memory so
you can't run Wolfenstein or TestDrive 3 while logged onto a network!
A bug in a Windows ATI driver is so good it will terminate Matlab 4.0!
DOS device drivers can access all of your memory so nothing is safe.
Happy now?

IRQ's in Linux are allocated. If your hardware IRQ's are screwed, they
won't work, period. The linux printer driver doesn't use an interrupt,
it's polled. I know, I wrote the original one, a while ago. I have a
modem, two serial ports, and a network card. Fix your hardware and
stop whining.

Actually, while I use both Windoze and X, most applications in both
don't support dnd. What I really use is cut-and-paste, and that is
horribly broken in Windoze. Haven't MS heard of a cut buffer?

And how do you know what the price of NT will be before it's released?
Pity that some people trust MS press releases.

Linux supports multimedia through X. You can play MPEG, FLI, GRASP, etc,
to your heart's content. MIT is making a killing doing interactive
video through X apps. With shared memory, you can run at full speeed
now.

I don't know for sure how NT handles QIC-80. I do know that it is
tightly coupled to system timing (serial communication through
floppy select lines) and the best way to set up QIC-80 transfers
is to turn off the multitasking. That is the fool-proof way to meet the
timing specs. QIC-117 makes that abundantly clear. Read your copy.

Gee, Windows just dumps me out at the DOS prompt. Someone once said, if
your system swaps too much, it is the fault of the system administrator,
and you should get more memory. If you run out of swap, shame on
you.

I use the minix fs, extfs, and ext2fs, and have not had any problems
except those due to my own fumble fingers.

The networking is not feeble. It is new, written from scratch, and keeps
improving. MS has demonstrated it wouldn't know good networking code
if it hit them, and they refuse to admit it. Expect NT to have several
serious problems loosing network files.

Now it seems clear to me that Peter has had a change of heart about this and

Date: 22 Aug 1993 01:28:41 -0400

        Hello,

        This is to ask if anyone is interested in a port of tkWWW
to linux.  I will be happy to provide it to anyone who might find
it useful, just drop me a line.  If enough people ask for it,
I'll try and get it on sunsite or somesuch.

        TkWWW is the Tcl/Tk World Wide Web browser for X windows.  For
those who don't know yet, Tcl/Tk is a free motifish looking toolkit
for X.  It now comes as part of the SLS distribution.

        I ported it because I didn't find it out on the net and
I really wanted to have WWW access from home, but with a nice
interface.    Xmosaic seemed to need Motif, which I don't have, 
so I went for the next best thing.

        The program uses "term" to provide the necessary access
to the internet, if necessary.

        Sincerely,

        Michael Moore
