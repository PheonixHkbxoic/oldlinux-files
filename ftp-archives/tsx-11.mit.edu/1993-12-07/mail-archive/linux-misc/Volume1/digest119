PROBLEMS: in the process of installation,  I keep getting get the message:

after put in the new disk that doinstall asks for.  Even worse, that after
it reads in few disks it crashes and give out the following message:

I did retry the whole installation process (start from begining with repartion,
reboot, reinstall) several more times (at least 5) but I keep getting the same
problem.  Although when it crashes, it does not crash at the same address or
same disk or file.  The most I got so far is be able to read in up to disk b3
then it crashes.  Sometimes it crashes right at disk a2.

If anyone have any idea what causes the problem and how to fix it, I would
be appreciated.

When a font of a particular size is not found, the R5 server scales up
with the resulting blocky look you see.  If you twiddle the
$ANDREWDIR/X11fonts/fonts.alias to make sure that it always finds a good
font, this won't happen.

Actually, even if you want to use the interactive bash, I would still install
_both_ binaries - the cut down one as /bin/sh and the full one as /bin/bash.
You'll save wasting a lot of system resources... no point in loading all the
user frontend stuff just to run a script now is there?

Last I recall, it was only available for Suns, with plans for SGI in 
the next few months.

If I could get it for my Control Data (MIPS) or Linux boxes, I would
fork up cash today.

Unfortunately, your program does not measure exactly what you think.
The program reads the *same* file COUNT times. At least on Solaris 2.x
(as well as SunOS 4.x) I/O will be happen only the first time you
read the file (since the file is only 1.2M) and the system will satisfy
subsequent read's of the same file from cached data. 

A better way to measure the I/O performance on Solaris 2.x (or SunOS 4.x,
or any SVR4 system) is to use mmap to map the whole file in memory,
and then to touch all *words* of the mapped address space (this would be
almost equivalent to the copy operation inherent in the read system call).
At the end of each iteration, you should use msync(3) with the MS_INVALIDATE
flag to discard all the file mappings, so that the next time you touch
all the mapped space, the system will have to fetch the data from the
remote server again.

I've found the other (well many functional) pieces of the yp
family, however, I was wondering if anyone knows of where there
might be a ypserv for Linux (if one should exist).  If not
does someone know where I can get a hold of a good example of
source for a ypserv that I can build on?  Thanks!

If you use the full bash as interactive shell with /bin/sh a link to
/bin/bash, running scripts is very fast: the code is already in the
buffer. A seperate sh binary would require loading from disk.

No prob.

   The Linux crowd can only benefit from what NT has to offer.  A smart
   person looks at both the strengths and weaknesses of the competition
   and works to improve themselves from this analysis.  Yes we may all
   secretly wish that Linux will spring up from out of the underground
   taking the computer communities by storm causing them to throw away
   and divorce MicroNT in droves! Don't hold your breath.....

   Better to learn what makes their product so desireable that you would
   want it in Linux, and then incorporate it into our true free and open
   Linux society.  Because the development of the Linux products is not
   for monetary reasons, but rather for the free giving to human-kind,
   no monolithic software company (the evil empire) can stand up to
   the sincerity of an such an open system.

Well, let me think about this...  Hmmmmmm...  What is it that makes NT
desirable?  I'd say:

   1. It's written by Microsoft.  Lot's of people like it just for
      that.
   2. Microsoft markets the shit out of it.  Lot's of people (press
      included) actually believe the marketing hype.
   3. It's sort of better than DOS+MS Windows.  On the one hand,
      applications can seize control of the machine under DOS+MS
      Windows, but can't under NT.  on the other hand, Windows apps
      run slower under NT.

Well, we've got point 3 - linux is certainly better than DOS+MS
Windows by all measures of quality except for:

   quality = written by Microsoft.
   quality = closeness to DOS+MS Windows.

However, now I'm at a loss.  Maybe you can explain to me how we can
incorporate points 1 and 2 into Linux.

Shared text, remember.  If even one interactive bash is running, you will
*save* memory by letting scripts run the same binary, because they'll share
the parts of the text they both use.  Use a separate /bin/sh and things like
the command parser *won't* be shared because they came from different
binaries, which will result in *wasting* memory.
