No. But then I don't use SLS :-).

Don't do things like that. The shadow stuff comes as a complete suite for a 
reason. If you substitute bits here and there it may fail to work in all 
kinds of interesting ways...

LK> Does anyone have a login that

Use the shadow suite. Recompile finger paying particular attention to where 
it looks for lastlog and what format it expects to see in there. Works for 
me. Dunno what SLS's problem is.

Hmmm.  Big red flag here.  There are many things wrong with Unix that
would require breaking compatibility to fix.  That's why Plan 9
exists, as I understand it (among other reasons).

Brook's had an article in his Mythical Man Month book about the second

category.

Wow.  Actually, setting the date back would probably work.  There were a
couple of posts about this in one of the col* groups yesterday.  Seems
it has to do with some date variable being signed/unsigned.  Term 1.08
was released with a fix.  It should be on sunsite, tsx etc.

Date: Fri, 29 Oct 1993 01:46:40 GMT

I've heard a lot about SLS, slackware and the MCC release of linux
and I have located them all at various ftp sites.

I have started hearing about the TAMU release and people seem to think
it is easier to install and is more robust than the other releases.

I have been looking around for it at various ftp sites yet I haven't located
it yet. I was wondering if someone would be so kind as to tell me where I
may find it.

It's tuesday that's the problem.  It seems the creater of TERM UN-intentionally
left some type of bug in the code that caused term to bomb on oct 26. 

The fix: simple either get the patch that's floating around or pick
up term108 from tsx-11 or sunsite.  (I don't know if they're there yet
but they should get there sooner or later)

Don't worry I found it at sunsite.unc.edu about five minutes after I posted 
this.

Looking at the files I wouldn't get this version, all dated at least 5 months
ago. kernel patch 4 (how old??)

Anyone know when the next version of SLS is due?????

Or is there a newer version of TAMU somwhere??

Subject: size limit in lpr
Date: 29 Oct 93 01:20:49 GMT

I just got the new version of the epson dvi driver (eps-0.45) from tsx-11.
After fussing for a while to get it to work, especially to get it to pass
commands to MakeTeXPK correctly to make new fonts (this now works Great, thanks
to the authors Neal and Michal), I was surprised to find that lpr choked on my
20 page paper.

I guess previous version (eps-0.1 is what I used) bypassed the lp queue 
completely (and so you couldn't queue up printing jobs, either), but is it
possible to enlarge the size of the buffer so I could pass a paper this size
to lpr without breaking it apart?  

Does the new version of the lpr package avoid all this (I use SLS-1.02 still,
and 0.99pl10)?

  Opps! Forgot to include the symptoms!  The local daemon sits there,

though the remote end migt be dead and we can't tell yet!

down the line, but it isn't followed by the normal connection messages.

Patches anyone? 8-}

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

The current tamu release is pl12 it is available at net.tamu.edu.
This has Images for 3.5 and 5 inch disks. (17 5 inch). Tamu is
not organized into tgz files. The only choice you have is whether
you want X installed or not. With X included it takes about 60 MB.
I found a european mirror of the 3.5 inch images at ftp.ibp.fr.
X was very easy to get going. I only had to redefine the mouse from
microsoft to logitec to get the first pictures onto my screen. 
Tamu has a config file where every clock is tried for every standard 
resolution. The chances are high, that some of the modes work for your
card monitor combination. Others are outside of the range of your monitor,
these have to be skipped quickly with the ctrl-alt-+ key combination.
Basic network setup was automatic. But I still do not have a reliably
functioning routing table. This has always been my problem with Linux
Net-2. Your machine specifig network details get 'hidden' in 
/etc/install/system_config. This did at first hide a typoo from me until
I found this file. I had a network number of 129.306.x.x which did of
course not work.
