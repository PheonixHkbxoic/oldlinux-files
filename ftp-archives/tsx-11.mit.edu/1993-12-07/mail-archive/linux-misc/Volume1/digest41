Subject: solved: flex problem
Date: Sun, 22 Aug 1993 16:07:25 -0400

I fixed my problem with flex by changing the declaration of yytext from:

extern char yytext[];

---->

extern char *yytext;

The flexdocs man page talks about this in the section describing the
differences between flex, lex, and POSIX.

Another question:  for completeness, it would be nice if there existed
/usr/lib/libl.a that pointed at /usr/lib/libfl.a, just as lex points to
flex.

i guess the subject line is pretty self-explanatory.

i have the gs 2.6.1 source, but i can't find the linux patches on
sunsite or tsx-11.  they must exist because sls has a gs binary.
but the sls binary has some pre-wired config stuff that isn't the
same on my system.

are the patches available?  thanx in advance.  if i'm in the wrong
group, let me know - i'm still getting used to this split.

I think you'll find that pretty much *everyone* makes snide remarks about

Well, I'm not going to say anything about Windows users worshipping Bill

Umm, I think that so-called "objective" comparison is considered something
of a joke in the Linux community, and as you so eloquently point out, it
wasn't actually posted here.  Because the original poster was worried
someone, somewhere might read it and think "hey, that's a lie!  That's a

So what?  Do I *cringe* because the $20,000 workstation I'm sitting at

Bite me, OK?  Multimedia is the integration of several media OK?  That
means live video can be mixed with live CD output, with overlayed MIDI
and computer graphics, if you want.  It does not mean that your
lousy OS supports playing music and compressed FMV at the same time.
Multimedia isn't a part of the OS!  Multimedia doesn't even have to

Is this guy crazy. I've been running linux with drag and drop for over six
months now, and I have not had any problems with corrupted file systems. Yes,
I am running ext2fs. And as for apps, linux had valid apps on it back when
NT was vaporware. NT maybe ok if you a user who doesn't want to get involved
in the actual developement of your OS, or the ability to change the actual OS
to suit your needs. As for linuxers being bitter, look at your own letter. You
are just pissed because the responses to the list put out help to catch
Microslauth with its pants down. Don't worry about it, old Billy is used to
the position.

It should be pointed out that multiple invocations of the same executable,
such as the shell, share all text pages and clean data not only with each
other, but with the buffer cache.   This makes for fast loading ane
very low memory consumption.

>runs DOS apps               yes                         some, via emulator

Both use an "emulator," which is in actuality just a DOS box.  Windows NT
on an i386 platform uses virtual-8086 mode, just as Linux dosemu does.
NT on a non-i386 platform uses a software 8086 emulator, which is slow.
But on i386 platforms, the NT and Linux approaches are fundamentally 
identical.

>kernel max addressable mem  2048 Gig                    4 Gig

This simply cannot be if we are talking about the same architecture.
The 80386/80486 only supports 4 GB of physical memory.  The current
Linux memory management scheme gives the kernel a 1GB address space,
making only 1 Gb of physical memory usable.  I don't think that's
too limiting; it could be changed if necessary.

>proc max addressable mem    4 Gig (???)                        4 Gig

Nope.  I don't know NT's, but Linux's is 3 GB.  This is, again, a side
effect of Linux's clean and simple memory management scheme; the kernel
and user memory spaces reside in the same page tables, making accessing
user space from kernel space a simple matter of "segmentation" (NOTE!
the user space is still "flat.")  Again, if the need were great, the
mm could be restructured to give 4 Gb to the process and 4 GB to the
kernel.  It just doesn't seem necessary.

Worse: you simply cannot address more than 4 GB physical mem at all on
an 80386, and there's no need to have the kernel addressing virtual memory
(well, there is, but it isn't worth the trouble to have a pageable kernel).
All the segmentation in the world won't help.

The 680x0 effort, as I understand, is trying to keep the 68k and i386 
architecture-specific code in separate trees.  If so, these changes could
be merged back into Linus' Linux, making it truly portable.  NetBSD has
a head start on this, however.

Even so, NT networking might not buy you anything.  NFS comes with Linux
networking: does it come with NT?

Excuse me?  Networked filesystems are extremely important, as are remote
procedure calls.

Everyone seems to focus on the few instructions that the 486 has but
the 386 doesn't.  Well, BSWAP is a nice one for networking on our
wrong-ended machines, but there is a more important consideration:
the 486 can make write-protect applicable even in privilege ring 0.
I imagine these two are the reason that NextSTEP, for example, claims
that it needs a 486.

Linux is full of verify_area() calls tomake sure the kernel doesn't
write into the wrong places.  I'd like to see the x86 variable in
the kernel, which holds a 3 for 386, 4 for 486, 5 for Pentium, actually
be used for something.  Enabling the correct 486 write-protect handling
and short-circuiting all those verify_area() calls would be nice.
