Hello you out there,

I wonder if the new Toshiba CD-ROM drive XM4101B is working with/under 
Linux.

A summary of the drives features:

650 MB, single/doubles-speed, 320ms accesstime, audio-cd, MPC, KODAK photo,
SCSI-2.

Are there any user, who have testet this specific drive or plan to do so ?

Please drop me a line.

Thanx in advance, Heinz.

According to the people who are writing the Hurd, it will require
porting (although they assure people ``that it will be less work than
porting GNU Emacs, and certainly less work than porting GNU cc''---
paraphrased).  This is due to funky machine-specific issues such as
endianness and alignment, I suppose.

>The i386ps2, i386at, MacII, sun3, mips, alpha and vax ports are free.

Mostly free.  But from the FAQ (as of 14 Oct 93):

| In general, Mach requires licenses in order to do anything useful.
| The Intel implementation of the microkernel is completely free, but
| others require licenses from the University of California at
| Berkeley which in turn requires a license from Unix System
| Laboratories. The Sun implementation also requires a license from
| Sun Microsystems.

| There is a volunteer effort underway to make the Macintosh port
| freely distributable.

| However, the machine-independent microkernel code and a large
| subset of the machine-dependent code is available freely.

The sticking point is generally proprietary device drivers.  This
section of the FAQ makes no mention of the DEC Mips and Alpha ports,
but with luck, they will be completely free like the i386 (the FAQ
does mention that the Alpha port is still unstable).

My first reaction to this is: Ignore all the posts from this site.
This will of course affect the users at this site who really are using
Linux and want to register their usage in the Linux user count but
unfortunately I think that's the way to go. If the affected users yell
enough at their sysadmin he probably won't do it again.

This is because USER.71 has not been implemented.  If you wish to discuss
Wine development, please keep it on the mailing list.  Wine is not
available for general release.

But since it has been mentioned, we are looking for dedicated hackers.
Many people have expressed interest.  However, few have the time to
put towards the project.  If you can spend 8 or more hours per week
on a project, please contact me.  You do not have to be an X or MS Windows
expert.  However, you should be a confident C programmer.

This is my belief also.  I'm chasing down a few possible financial

This could also include organizations willing to provide employee

Reply-To: cgs103@psu.edu

I can't offer any further suggestions for pl12, but a patch to the standard
pl13 kernel is available that adds support for IP defragmentation.  It's a
replacement for the "ip.c" module in /usr/src/linux/net/inet, prepared
by Ahmon Dancy and available on sunsite as /pub/Linux/kernel/misc-patches/ip.c.
Note that the net-2-debugged package is also required.

I've been using it for a couple of weeks now, and it has solved all of my 
fragmentation problems.  UDP applications such as xarchie work fine, and I've 
been able to increase my mtu to 1500 without breaking TCP apps such as telnet 
and ftp (previously I had to keep the mtu below 512).

The alpha pl13 kernels also apparently support defragmentation, but there have
been a number of other problems with them (as one should expect of alpha code).
This solution has been rock solid for my system.

Subject: Assorted Slackware updates
From: volkerdi@mhd1.moorhead.msus.edu (Patrick J. Volkerding)
Date: 10 Nov 93 16:18:38 -0600

There have been a number of fixes and updates to the Slackware Linux
distribution since the release of version 1.1.0. Anyone interested in the
whole list of changes should look at the ChangeLog on ftp.cdrom.com:

/pub/linux/slackware/README_ChangeLog

This file details all of the changes, what they fixed, upgraded, etc.

A few of the improvements:

New ALPHA Q series: 0.99pl13q with ALPHA 0.99pl13q bootdisk. Users of PS/1
and Valuepoint computers should be able to use this new bootdisk and alpha
series to install Slackware by holding down a lilo hot-key at boot and
entering their drive parameters. The new Q series  kernels also have built in
HPFS read support. 

GNU GCC/G++/Objective C 2.5.2, GNU gdb 4.11.

'tset' utility added.

A new 'tamux' package was added. The TAMU distribution included a nifty
customized Xconfig and instructions for using it to find good video modes
for X by just flipping through all the possible modes with Ctrl-Alt-Keypad+.
I've updated it to use the Xconfig format expected by XFree86 2.0, and
tested it on an S3 local bus system. Together with "vgaset", I was able to
get perfect 1024x768, 800x600, and 640x480 modes in about 10 minutes.

That's about it for now,

Subject: Help me choose a CD-ROM drive
Date: Thu, 11 Nov 1993 02:05:58 GMT

I'm trying to pick a CD-ROM drive.  Here's what I want, in decreasing
order of importance:

Crucial: Compatable with NT, OS/2, Unix/Linux, others
SCSI interface (I have an Adaptec 1542B)
Double speed
Cheap
No caddy

I thought I had found a winner with the NEC CDR-38 (SCSI interface,
double speed, $250 cheap, no caddy) but I've heard a report that it
doesn't work with Windows NT.  (It's not in my hardware compatability
guide.)

Is this a FAQ?  Is there a listing of CD-ROM drives available that
lists features such as these, through which I could peruse?  Did a
magazine print a comparison lately (it would have to be pretty recent,
models change frequently)?  Thanks for any help.

Yet more XFree86 2.0 fun!

So I fianlly compiled the pl13 kernel, and hopefully would be able to
run the SVGA server. No dice.

The Mono server works great, and would destroy this DEDCstation 3100 I'm
writing this on now, but I feel the need for color!

I have a Gateway2000 486DX33v, a Rocket (Western Digital) card, 8 megs RAM,
8 more swap partition, plenty of disk space, etc...

When I startx, (after I link the correct server, and reconfig appropriately),
I get thin vertical lines on my screen, then they get closer together, and
then the screen turns green (This may be from  my .twmrc, as I use the same
one I use on a DECsattion, where all my stuff is green (by choice!)), and
sits there.  When I move my mouse, the screen sometimes changes to a brighter
green. I think this is from my active border color in .twmrc, because I can
type ^D to exit my unseeable login xterm window, and I can't when the screen
is not that color...

Anyone have suggestions?

Are you using IDE drives?  (I am assuming you do)

Problem with IDE setups is that it is that the drives hold onto the bus when
doing reading and writing.  When this happens, the drives have to share back
and forth, causing a performance hit.

I guess I didn't make my point clear enough: there is a huge difference
between the way Linux has been developed, and the Hurd development approach.

While the Linux core did come into existence without the Internet, the speed
of its subsequent development was due to the new work style made possible by
the Internet.  The population density of people that (can and _will_) write
code is very low.  The Internet allow virtual(1) teams to gather and work
closely together, despite being physically distributed.  More importantly it
also provides a diverse audience of testers, some of whom will provide
detailed feedback or go on to enhance particular aspects of the code.

The only way people are going to join such a team, however, is if
there is a structure and attitude to permit mutual benefit.  The FSF project
provided an essential part of the Linux structure by writing the GPL.  What
they haven't promoted, at least in the case of Hurd, is an attitude that
encourages people to work together.  That requires letting the people that
write prototype code make design decisions, and providing enough interim
releases that testers see the positive influence of their feedback.


(1) I too dislike the `in' phrases "Virtual {Community, Reality, ...}".  Please
forgive me for using one.

(2) Without the GPL, people and corporations too often are tempted to hold
onto bugfixes and improvements, just in case they become useful enough to sell
someday.

Yes, XFree86 2.0's Mach32 server should be _much_ faster.  I've seen
numbers over 80k xstones for the Mach32 server, and X8514 is much
slower.  The XFree86 2.0 servers, in general, will be faster, more
reliable, and more correct (try running Motif apps on X8514 :-( ) than
X8514 or XS3.  Plus, the Mach32 server can support more than 1 Mb of
RAM, and use resolutions other than 1024x768 and 640x480.

Besides, you'll need the libraries from XFree86 2.0 to use the Mosaic
2.0 binary that I'm about to start uploading to sunsite. :-).
Upgrading is good.

Just for information, this week's Electrronic Engineering Times has a piece
on a new CD-ROM interface which works with a normal IDE drive controller.
Standards are being finalized at this time. The main advantages: 1. No need
for an additional controller, SCSI or proprietary; 2. Transfer rates of
13 megabytes per second. According to the article, manufacturers are gearing
up and IDE-compatible drives should be with us in 6 months or so.

Comments?  Here are a few:

Pro:
        Cheap

Con:
        Slow, slow slower than a 486dx50 once you get out of the internal
        cache.
        16 bit external data path, makes for slow memory xfers under any
        32 bit operating system.
        Unreliable (the ones I had to test on eval for work were unstable)
        Max 16 meg of memory
        Did I mention slow?

this could be because you have run out of inodes.

Try typing 'df -i' to see the inode situation.

I am also interested in this.  I would hate to bother the WINE team so
could some other knowlegable soul post some info about what is necessary
to get up to speed on this.  I attempted to join the WINE channel 3 weeks
ago but got no response from listserv

I have to keep on booting into MSDOG to use Lotus. SC is not great.

With the SA exchange rate, thats a bit steep - We would look at something half
that price.

I am typing this message on a PCI machine with a PCI S3 VGA card.
Linux runs very well on the machine.  The only "problem" is that the
SCSI drivers do not know about the on-board SCSI controller.  I
imagine that it is only a matter of time before this works too.

I am using the machine as an X workstation on a network of Suns.  One
day soon my NEC 5FG will arrive, and I will be even more happy.
