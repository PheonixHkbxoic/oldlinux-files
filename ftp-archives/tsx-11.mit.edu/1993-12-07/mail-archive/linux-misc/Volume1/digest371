Date: 29 Nov 93 11:03:17 GMT

I installed the SLS distribution of Linux a while ago.
Now what is the difference to the Slackware distribution?
What packages are included?

Another question: What are the newest versions of SLS,Slackware
and the Linux kernel?

And yet another one: Is System V IPC included in 099pl13, if
not how do I compile the kernel to include it?

Does anyone have any experience porting Motif to Linux. My company has a
Motif source license and for $40 you can put it on any system that you

There's a better way to do this. just edit the gftopk.ch file in the
source. the gftopk.web file sets max_row to 16000 and Berry's change 
file (in web2c-5.851d) has:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% [7] Allow for bigger fonts.  Too bad it's not dynamically allocated.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
@x
@!max_row=16000; {largest index in the main |row| array}
@y
@!max_row=100000; {largest index in the main |row| array}
@z

of course, for some uses that is too small too..as Berry says dynamic 
allocation would be best.

at any rate, in the gftopk.ch file make it big enough and then 
 make programs 
at the TeX source root (which will make other stuff too)

i'll be glad to add a larger figure for max_row to my standard diffs
to web2c-5.851d that i use for the Linux distribution. What have you
found adequate for your needs. i remember a while when i was using
gnuplot mf files i had to increase it but forget what i found good
enough. (now i'm mainly into writing mf straight)

Donald Knuth has graciously put all of his TeX/METAFONT code in the
public domain. He does request that that no modified versions be 
distributed under the same name (but the above certainly doesnt amount
to a modification).

The web2c specific stuff done by Karl Berry is under the GPL.

Yes, you can...if i were you i'd just distribute your changed
gftopk.ch and a binary gftopk, but suit yourself.

Subject: Linux bootstrap made easy
Date: 2 Dec 93 22:12:43 GMT

(I know this belongs in linux.development, but they don't
have that here...)

After suffering through several failed installations due to conflicts
between various devices and variations of Linux, and after reading
hundreds of messages from fellow explorers in linux.help, I thought
about a way to improve the bootstrapping process.

Different versions of Linux boot disks (e.g. Yggdrasil, Nascent,
Slackware, SLS, etc.) seem to detect different devices in different
orders, depending on what was compiled into the boot image.

I had problems because the various "detect yourself" routines poked
around in ways that disturbed other devices, or fooled itself into
thinking that some device was present on my system when it wasn't.

Sure, you can fix these things by rebuilding the system, but you 
can't do that unless you already have a second working Linux system.
And LILO commands can work around some problems, but not everything.
Chances are, someone *does* have MS-DOS installed on their system, or
can run MS-DOS temporarily from floppy.

I propose an MS-DOS program called 'kick' that hot-patches the
'vmlinux' image on a Linux boot floppy.  This crude but effective
technique would alter the table of function pointers for the code to
detect the presence of devices.  For the SCSI startup, I found it in
/usr/src/linux/kernel/blk_drv/hosts.c, in the scsi_hosts[] table.  I
imagine other types of devices have similar tables.

'Kick' tells the user exactly which devices are linked into the boot
image.  A very simple GUI would let you zero out the table entries
for the devices that you know are not present in the system.

Like Microsoft's MSD or QEMM's Manifest, this program could detect PC
devices using techniques that other people have already documented or
supported for MS-DOS.  Although Linux doesn't use the same MS-DOS
code for supporting these devices, at least they could be detected
under DOS in a more robust fashion.

(The code in hosts.c already skips table entries with a null 'detect'
function pointer.  All this technique needs is some kind of easily
detected signature string placed immediately before the table, so
'kick' could scan the boot image for the table.)

For safety's safe, you could expand the table to include an extra
copy of the detect function pointer to easily restore the boot disk
to its original state, so you can begin a new experiment or clone the
disk for someone else.  

This program would also be a good way to determine the parentage and
contents of a given boot image.  The table already has a descriptive
string, but these strings could be improved to include the version
and patch level of the driver in question.

Subject: Problems with PAS16 and 1542 ?
Date: 2 Dec 93 15:30:03 GMT

Hi,

Has anybody yet noticed problems with Linux, snddrv, and the combination
Adaptec 1542, Pro Audio Spectrum 16 and ISA board ? The docs for
NeXTSTEP/Intel tell that because both of them try to do busmastering they
have certain problems with cohabitation.

This most often results in the PAS16 hanging up till the next reboot when
playing sounds while there is heavy traffic on the disk interface.

Is this problem known for Linux too ? (I ran some test, and never noticed
this with Linux. Is this just because Linux does a better disk buffering
that hides this problem ?)

If this doesn't happen, is there a work around in snddrv ? (May be NeXT
could learn from this ;-)

Subject: Linux IS well documented.
Date: 4 Dec 1993 17:42:53 GMT

I frequently read that linux is not well documented. I disagree. I
don't refer to the man pages (tho they seem ok to me) nor even the docs
put out by the LDP (tho i think, for example, the Kernel Hacker's
Guide is nice). Rather:

 An operating system with source code is better documented than any
os without source code. Certainly, Linux could be better documented,
but the essential documentation is there.

 btw, compiling linux with -Wall, the compiler gives few (no?)
warnings. i assume the same would be true for aix, ultrix, solaris?

It's free software, you can do with it or package it, as you like.
If I would do the job, then I would prefer to rely on my own not
on a consortium I don't know ... With "funny" ideas ...

So you make good distribution bad, if there is a body who doesn't
like the way somebody guides installation ?

Better the packages interact well ! Look at SLS ... so much 
documantation about it ... but look the packaging qualities ;-(

My $0.02: Forget about it. Create a mailing list where you people

This is a drawback for all those people who produce good quality
packages .. to be "flamed" afterwards not to be user friendly '-)

And how do they know about the Consortium if they aren;t on the net ?

Then you need magazines to spread the info around, that there is
a Consortium around, that is said to represent the needs of 
unexperienced users.

Too much power for Mr. Somebodies who think they are the ones
who can judge about the 'outlooking' of a free software package.

Date: Sat, 4 Dec 1993 19:29:20 GMT


I do apologize for my stupid posting in which I claimed that the AHA1542CF
didn't work with Linux. Of course, it works fine, but you have to disable
its BIOS. To my excuse, let me say a few words about how I had arrived at
my pessimistic conclusion.

About three weeks ago, I ordered an AHA1542CF, having checked that the
1542 series was supported by the Linux SCSI drivers. Then, two days before
its arrival, I noticed two postings in comp.os.linux.help: one by srp@rcx1
(Stephen Pietrowicz) which culminated as follows:

> The bad news is, if you want to use Linux on an Adaptec 1542, you
> must use the old ROMs and limit yourself to only 1 gig of your nice
> shiny 1.2 gig hard disk.  Until someone fixes this, of course.

and another by eric@tantalus.nrl.navy.mil (Eric Youngdale) with the following
conclusion:

>>The new ROMs support "extended translation," which bypasses MS-DOS's
>>limit of 1024 cylinders by changing the cylinder granularity from
>>one meg to eight megs.
>
>     Yes, I know all of this.  You should not use these ROMs with linux.

From that exchange, I understood that there might be problems with the
newest versions of the 1542 controller and that, with large disks, they may
NOT WORK WITH LINUX AT ALL. When I finally received my controller, I promptly
installed it under DOS and it worked fine; then, without disabling its BIOS
(but, of course, disabling its extended addressing feature) I tried it under
Linux and it failed with the notorious "interrupt received but no mail" message.

Normally I wouldn't have concluded anything desperate at this point. I
consider myself an experienced software developer (I wrote a number of
drivers for exotic controllers and exotic operating systems), but there
were these two factors: the two articles (I am not blaming the authors;
they both new what they were talking about) and my urge to have the controller
work under both DOS and Linux. (I have a dual setup and wanted to have a
DOS partition on the large disk to store my MIDI files created under DOS.)
Thus, I didn't even bother to check what would happen if I disabled the 
BIOS! Especially the Eric's posting was damaging, because having co-authored
the controller he was in a good position to appraise the severity of the
problem.

I'm sorry about this. I must be getting old and jumpy. Still, I would like to
be able to use the disk under both DOS and Linux so when I manage to get the
details from Adaptec, I will try to fix the problem that is there (not the one
that I thought was there). Thanks to all the people who sent me their polite
comments, as opposed to flaming me which they should rightfully have done.

I've been having a few problems with my modem since I purchased a new

problems with it until the new machine.  It's the same modem with the
same software setup (okay, a few kernel revisions later, but
basically the same).  But now-a-days whenever I'm using the modem I
lose characters whenever the hard drive runs.  It's especially
annoying under term because everything locks up while term tries to
retransmit.  I thought it was the new IDE controller, so I swapped
with the one on the 486/50, but I still have the same problem.  They
are the old uarts and I am running at 14.4...  but why would this
problem not happen on the 486/50?

Any help would be appreciated...

Date: 4 Dec 1993 19:45:04 GMT


Periodically, there are request for a word processor (ie wysiwyg with
embedded graphics, etc) for Linux. I've been looking for one too.
While for my own use, TeX (and Emacs) are better than anything else,
i can't/won't insist my secretaries, etc. use it. But i've just found
(tho it's been around) an excellent word processor:

 ez is a multimedia document processor that is part of the Andrew
Toolkit. You can embed graphics and charts in the document and edit
them right there. In fact, you can embed a spreadsheet in a file.
 added features: knows the common Emacs keystrokes, saves as ascii
file, configurable menus (both on top and popup (via mouse2))
and styles. uses gnu ispell to spellcheck. 
 it supports postscript printers best but (via ghostscript) i assume
others can be used.
 
 the andrew toolkit contains other interesting stuff as well. there
is a good help system (run /usr/andrew/bin/help ) which can be easily
customized for local needs.

 binaries for Linux are at sunsite in the pub/Linux/X11/andrew subdir

Hang on through the weekend and I should have out syslogpak package on
either sunsite, tsx-11 or both.  This utility package contains an INET
aware syslogd and a kernel logging facility which runs as a client of
syslogd.

We have been using this package on our corportate Linux network for almost
a year now with very good success.  It has also been used at a number
of other sites and I have not heard much in the way of problems.

The PL14 kernel raised one buglet which I will address this weekend.  When
this is fixed I upload the code and post an announcement.
