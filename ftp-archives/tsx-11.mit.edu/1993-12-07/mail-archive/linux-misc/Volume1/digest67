        I know where you can get the boot file.  Any Sun server on the
internet :)
        Seriously, to have a working sun you would need a server with
a working xdm, tftp, bootp, portmap and nfs, right?  anything else?
And then you could use the sample setups from Xkernel.  I have Xkernel
running quite successfully here at school if anybody would like help
debugging things...  in fact im on one right now...

xdm to manage X windows on the sun xterminal.
tftp daemon on linux to answer tftp requests from sun's boot program.
bootp on linux to respond to boot program on sun for its root and swap devices.
portmap on linux to respond to NFS mount of root filesytem by sun.
NFS for above.

Perhaps syslogd on linux might be useful as well...

But if there is a large amount of unshared data between the processes,
and there are enough of them, there will be a ton of swapping,
probably worse than if there is just one process taking up that
total amount of unshared data. And it seems to me that ghostscript,
composing large bitmaps, might just use a lot of memory for unshared
data storage.

I disagree. Have you ever seen numbers on the amount of usenet
readership? It is millions. I work in a company that makes their own
software, and also regularly hires people from dedicated software
houses to make things for us. Most of the guys I see from those
companies do know about GNU, quite some even run Linux at home or
intend to do so in the future.

When I was working at the ESA (european space agency) I took, as
always, my 'tape' with me, with my own X11 environment, GNU compilers,
emacs, rcs, cvs, and many GNU tools. I want to have the same
environment everywhere where I work, so I instist to install all my
stuff where I come.

The people from ESA were appalled by the quality of all this PD and
GNU stuff; they had heard of it however, but had not used it before.
Now even there they use a lot of it, and even they run Linux on some
PC's and the graphical user interface of several large projects is
made in Tcl/Tk, and many people have replaced the standard vi with
emacs (if you give people a good introduction almost anyone will love
the switch). Gcc is used as standard C compiler (they already knew
that because the real-time operating system VxWorks, which is used for
embedded control, uses gcc as cross-compiler for VME based CPU
boards).

I think you are being too pessimistic on the influence of Usenet and
the GNU project.

Yes, but they go too far. In the end it will damage themselves, like
IBM was damaged too by the almost-monopoly they got in the 70s. First
they get big profits, but the losses will be even bigger.

Every company must fight its competitors, I agree; but they must also
learn self-control. If you kill everyone you get an unhealthy
situation, bad for everyone. The former eastern-block was a
monopolized economy, the results are clear. Microsoft is evil in a
way, but more so, the buyers are stupid. They fall in a trap with
opened eyes. Blinded by the lies and marketing stories of Microsoft,
and too incompetent to judge the different choices on their technical
merits. There are too many incompetent people on decision-making positions
in companies, especially in automation departments.

Depends on what you do with it. If the software will control a

somewhat exaggerated.

ISO is a complot of companies selling ISO certificates. They make
everyone believe their market chances increase when they have the
certificate. Once they have it, they think they've done so much for it
they demand it also from other companies they do business with. A
clever system to get everyone to want to be qualified, and have a
constant income because of the qualification has to be repeated
constantly.

And most companies who get the certificate, they only want to use it
as a marketing argument, and are not really interested in better
quality.

You don't need that for Linux. That's what we have multitasking for.

Videodriver is not equal to GUI! OK, you put a low level videodriver
in the kernel; using these primitives you can still implement muliple
GUI's outside of the kernel. A complete GUI is way too big for the
kernel, or even for the operating system.

I do agree that this could be improved on Linux since even the low
level stuff (except for ioports) is in user space. But as long as you
stay in X11 (within which still many look-and-feels are available) you
won't notice the difference.

  AWoEC> (4) An integrated GUI buys you a common "look-and-feel"
  AWoEC> across all your applications -- thus reducing training costs,
  AWoEC> since training in one application generalizes to others.

But what if you don't like the GUI that someone else has chosen for
you? I like to make my own trade-off between my personal taste, and
using a commonly used thing. Maybe it is more the individualists that
like things like Linux, and the sheep that blindly follow Microsoft
that like NT etc (just contrary to what the starter of this thread
posed a while ago).

  AWoEC> (5) NT's GUI is not integrated, it is a configuration option

At least for the time being, there are no alternatives.

Not so sure about that. If you look at such code (which must be
horrible) you are inclined more to work along the same lines. If you
don't have the code but concentrate only on the objective (the
system-call interface that must be made available) you are not
burdened with this and can make a fresh start.

hello.

i forget where i posted this question last time, but i got no answers
so i'm trying again.  i think this is the right place.  the split still
has me confused.

anyway, i'm looking for the source code for the linux device for
ghostscript.  the program compiled fine, but the only device i have
is my printer, and it doesn't work quite right yet.  the vga/tvga stuff
is all msdos-based.

somebody must have the source, because the sls version of ghostscript has
the linux device built in.  i couldn't find it on sunsite or tsx-11.  can
someone point me in the right direction?

thanx in advnace.

    I'm interested in knowing what kind of hardware configurations people are
using under Llinux.  Specifically, ethernet controller, hard disk controller,  
serial port board if applicable, etc....  Not only what hardware works (which
you can get out of the FAQ), but also how well it works... cavets or lack of,
speed, stability... which is not in the FAQ.

    It occurs to me that many other people would be interested in this  
information as well so I have decided to conduct an email poll on it.

    If you have time, please fill out the below form and email it to  
poll@moonshot.west.oic.com ... do NOT respond to the net!  I will post the  
complete results after one week of information collection (next saturday).

A.  This is a poll on linux hardware configurations, I/O boards, and your 
    perceptions as to the reliability of same.  If you are a Linux user with
    knowledge of the hardware configuration of your machine then this poll is
    for you!

B.  If you have time, please answer the below questions and send the results
    to:
