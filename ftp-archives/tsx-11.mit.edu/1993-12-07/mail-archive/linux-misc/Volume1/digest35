Perhaps this uninformed opinion is why you have not answered my earlier
challenge to provide comparison with *BSD, UnixWare, SVR4.2, Solaris, and
SunOS as well as just Linux.

The Linux community should feel free to benfit from the *BSD communities
research, just as all commercial OS vendors should feel free; I don't know
how this is impacted by Linux's licensing choices; however, if they aren't
actually adding restrictions above and beyond a Berkeley copyright, the

Full loadable kernel modules for:

o       Virtual file systems
o       Block and character device drivers
o       Streams modules
o       Execution classes

Of these, the following bear explanation:

Streams modules
        I have a streams implementation which I have not released.  I am not
        at liberty to release it at this time.

Execution classes
        These are loader types for kern_execve.c.  The types I have working
        on my machine (also not for release at this time) allow me to run
        most Linux (statically linked), ISC UNIX SVR3 (statically linked),
        and Xenix 286 and 386 binaries.  I am not at liberty to release
        these execution classes at this time.

Miscellaneous modules
        Any data or function accessed through a data pointer or function
        pointer can be modified as a loadable module.

Sending your credit card numbers through the mail is a bad idea, unless
you encrypt it with Jay's public DES key (so he can decrypt it with his
private key.  But I don't know if he has a key, so it's probably a moot
point).

The reason is that a mail route often involves some uucp store-and-forward
portion.  While your message is stored, it is potentially accessible by
others.  Not something you'd want to entrust your credit card number with.

It's probably a bad idea to send your credit card number anyway, unless
you encrypt it with Jana's public key first (again, they probably don't
have one, so the short answer is: don't bother.  Use the phone instead).

You've completely missed the point of linux.  a) it's for unix
enthusiasts, and b) for `hackers'.  We (linuxers, and some unixers) don't
read every computer rag, drooling over the new release of word for
windows.  Or eagerly awaiting windows 4.0 because it will be object
oriented, not that many people even know what that is.  We don't judge our
computer-literacy on how much our collection of software costs, or the 
big number that we get when we add all the version-numbers together.
We want something done, we do it ourselves, or ask for someone to do it for
us... for free!  Linux is a comunity of programmers with the right
attitude on what programming knowledge, and programs should be... free!
I suggest you read the GNU licence, and read about the GNU philosophy.

Again, read the above paragraph.  If you want to change the NT kernal, or
add to it, or remove portions of the kernal, can you do it?  No.  If you
don't wish to do any of these, than NT is probably for you.

All that checklist did, was spread FUD.  Pure and simple.  Would you like it
if I compared OS/2 to NT using windows 3.0 specs?  I think not.

A general rule: If you don't know what a compiler is, don't bother with linux.
If you don't want to know what a compiler is, stick with Microsloath. :)

Once again you miss the point of linux.  If you're happy with propriety
software, that's fine.  If you're happy to accept whatever microsoft
churnes out, that's fine.  I'm not.

Take DOS as an example.  What major functions has Microsoft added since
it's release (other than the obvios ones like sub-directories) that were
Microsoft innovations?  Answer: (almost) none.  Almost EVERYTHING in DOS now
can be done using public domain software.  Once Microsoft had a monopoly, it
forgot about it, and concentrated on how to make more money.  Then Windows
came along.  Look at the improvements from Windows 1 to windows 3 when it
wasn't very successful (to put it mildly)...
Microsoft then got a winner, now has almost a monopoly on GUI type
OS, and it went on to NT.  As long as NT is not very popular Microsoft
will improve it, but once it reaches a critical mass... well, I don't like
making predictions. :)  

Linux on the other hand is made by enthusiasts. And as they say, money is the
root of all evil...

Draw your own conclusions... :)

I get the same problem with kermit connections sometimes. I think it
is due to the fact that a real vt-100 only supported 24 data lines
with the 25th line reserved whereas our consoles standardly support 25
lines or even more.

Some old vt-100 programs set the "scrolling region" on the screen and
when they reset it they use some oddball sequence that is imperfectly
emulated. Also if a program aborts abnormally or you kill it so it
doesn't have a chance to clean up it can leave the screen in odd
states.

You can try the following to reset it:

        #! /bin/bash
        # reset top and bottom margins and clear screen
        echo -ne "\033[r\033[J"
        # reset default ASCII (USA) character set
        echo -ne "\033(B\017"
        # reset bold, blink and underscore attributes
        echo -ne "\033[0m"

Note: you must use bash for those echo options to work right.

Reply-To: B.A.McCauley@bham.ac.uk

Since I suspect this is a property of the binary emacs distribution of
emacs rather than emacs in general I'll mention it here.

As shipped the emacs-19.19A distribution of emacs has the variable
sendmail-program set to "fakemail". This has the effect of making the
"Subject:" line a part of the message body not part of the header.
Channging this variable to point to /usr/bin/smail or
/usr/lib/sendmail will cure this.

This is a trivial point but I was rather embarrising to me to realise
that much of the mail I've sent in the last few weeks had no Subject:

without any problems.  With the advent of pl12, though, it acts very
flakey.  It will sometimes log me out as soon as it connects, other
times is will act as though I typed things that I didn't during login.
Once I am logged in, things work fine.  rlogin out of the machine works
fine, as well as everything else I have tried.

The whole NT v Linux thing is silly. Firstly they are very different 
products. NT is an expensive corporate system with (I'm told reliably)
very good paid for support. Linux is a free system for the masses.

I did find the reliability issue funny. On our NT march BETA (now destroyed)
setting the terminal program to telnet mode, and typing ^J (control J then
return) crashed NT. Granted it's a beta - but so is Linux.

I don't like microkernels and after comparing Linux v NT speeds I was even
more convinced of this. When the development tools exist that allow you
to write and compile a microkernel based system and get the same output
assembly code as compiling its macrokernel equivalent, then the microkernel
will be a good general idea.

Really - I still can't play MPEG movies from one machine to another under
the OS/2 window system. It seems well stuck to one computer or something.
I won't flame you too much here. There is a lot of nice design in the OS/2
applications. I like openlook and that does me almost as well. If you are
a total windows look weenie try Motif (about $100).

Beg to differ: I found it gave better file throughput but poorer overall
performance in 8Mb (compared to Linux running OpenLook), and in 4Mb Linux
was useable, OS/2 was struggling.

Yes but each copy of Unix is probably supporting more than one user. Also 
it depends which bits of software. Marketroid toys and office widgets yes.
I can't find a free copy of Prolog for OS/2, only expensive ones. NFS support
that seems to cost losts of money. Things like Khoros dont even appear to
exist for OS/2.

Post-flame-disclamer2: I think people should beware of preachers from 
commercial companies who clearly have _NO_ idea how much good free software
there is (probably even for their own OS).

If OS/2 is so great why were a bunch of OS/2 people I know from IBM running
around with NT going 'At last something faster than OS/2' ????

So instaed of having one Unix box allowing 200 users to work on it, the

Oh god, more misinformation. There _is_ a version of WABI being developed,
called Wine, and there is _also_ WinAPI, which is what you describe and then
tell us that we are being told that is WABI. Why does Linux have no hope in a
million years of doing this? Seem to me if it's possible to do it on a SPARC
processor, it's got to be somewhat easier on an intel.

So we will have a choice; if we happen to have the source code available (ha
ha) we can compile a Windows app as a native Linux app, or if we just have a
Windows binary, we can run that using Wine.

Yes this is being developed, you are correct. But Wine is _also_ being
