Hi,

I would like to have a look at the MH mail system (for the xmh,
actually). I do have the sources for mh-6.8 but haven't got the
conf/MH. Anybody done this already?

Thanks, el

My dear Wife uses my Linux box to dial up her (VMS) VAX at work.

The main problem is that using plain old xterm with Seyon (or whatever)
doesn't do *quite* a good enough job of emulating a VT[23]20.
The main problem is getting some kind of emulation of the keys on
the DEC keyboard.   Does anyone out there have an experience with
doing this kind of stuff or suggestions how to get some kind of
half-decent keyboard emulation set up?

There are both static and dynamic link versions of MH on sunsite.unc.edu.
Building MH for Linux is non-trivial, because some of the routines central to
MH know what the insides of stdio look like... except that under Linux it's
different.  (Linux stdio being a front-end to G++ iostreams.)  And changing it
to use stdio directly makes it hideously slow, so the only solution that works
is to port the stuff that knows the insides of stdio (mainly sbr/m_getfld.c)
to know what the insides of GNU stdio looks like.

Here's a perl program, written by Tom Christianson, which does the same as
the above script. It provides a great deal of information for each duplicate
file including size, date, and crc information. Incidentally, those who are
running bash can get all names in your path by using the builtin `type'
command with `-all' as an argument; i.e. `type -all ls' will return all the
`ls' commands in your search path (including aliases).

I'm running pl13t right now (from the system I'm typing this
message on).  I stripped the kernel of all the extra drivers,
and don't use this sytem much, but still...

'uptime' ==
  12:30pm  up 1 day, 10:24,  2 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00

My friends think I'm just lucky, but I like to think Linux is more
stable than people thingk.  Ack... nice typing, eh?  :)

Not as reliable as my 3B2 here (been running for almost four months

   S3 928 seems too expensive to me.  How's that compared with 805 ?
Or even CirrusLogic 5426/5428 ?  In the Windows 3.1 case CirrusLogic
5426/5428 comes close to 805 but are at much cheaper price...

   Are there any xstone benchmark for common video cards ?  Sorry if
this is an FAQ, but I've read several Linux FAQ but couldn't find any.

   Thanks for any info.

The current version of TeX is _3.141_ and the current version of METAFONT is
2.71.  The source for both are in the packages web-5.851d and web2c-5.851d
(the version number is the sum of TeX's and MF's version number), which you 
can find at any good TeX archive.  If your TeX says something like this at 
startup:

        This is TeX 3.141 (D) ...

then you have the latest version.  If not, you can get the sources.  It 
builds without any change and passes the trip and trap tests under Linux.  
Just type `configure'.  See if the paths for fonts and macros in the 
makefile are to your liking. Then type `make trip-trap' to run the tests, 
and `make clean' and `make all' to make the final version.

        It seems that Adaptec has been changing around their line of host
adapters, dropping the 1740A and 1742 and introducing new 2000-series models
like the 2742. Has anyone had any experience with these new Adaptec host
adapters and Linux, and do they (esp. the 2742, which sounds like the closest
to the 1542/1742) work with the current Adaptec drivers? If not, could someone
