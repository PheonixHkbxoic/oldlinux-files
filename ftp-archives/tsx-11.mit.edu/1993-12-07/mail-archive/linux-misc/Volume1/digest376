IMHO the answer is certainly "yes". I suspect you have never tried to
install Linux from a CD-ROM.  I installed the pl7 Yggdrasil CD some time
ago when I did not have access to the Net. There were quite a few problems
but I was able to get round them or put up with the things that did not
work. I was particulary interested in an affordable system that I could
use to develop X Windows applications on my PC at home.

I have recently purchased the Nascent CD with which I have had a great
many problems. I do not wish to be overly critical of Nascent which is
a low cost distribution. However, it seems to me distributors need to
be helped to improve their products.

The main point is that *developers* are only developing parts of the
system but it is the total package that is of concern to users.
As an example: the version of "more" on the Nascent CD fails with a
segmentation violation. To try to sort this out, I did the following:

   a) Checked shared library with "ldd". It appeared to be OK.
   b) Tried to locate source for "more" using "tar -tvzf" on various
      source archives.
   c) Recompiled "more" and found that it still had a problem.
      Ignored the many warnings that came out of the compile.
   d) Changed Makefile for -g option and tried to investigate the
      problem with "gdb". Tried again after removing the -s option
      as well. This produced no useful information except
      that the program failed on return from a function which
      references "termcap".
   e) Made a guess that the termcap buffer was too small and changed
      the definition of TBUFSIZ from 1024 to 2048. This appeared to
      solve the problem but I should really have consulted the
      documentation for the termcap functions.

It is hardly possible to blame the original UCB developer of "more"
which was copyrighted in 1980. The source code does not indicate
which developer ported "more" to Linux. Perhaps the problem lies with
the developer of the termcap library or the developer of the /etc/termcap
file (which, incidently, does not recognise the 80x28 VGA mode).

Perhaps this problem was missed because no developer uses "more" any
more :-). In my case I use my own version of "pg" and would not have
noticed anything wrong with "more" except that I am developing a new
version of "lc" and was testing it with the default pager.

I used "more" repeatedly while attempting to install the system from
the CD as it was the only pager on the floppy disk. I did not have
any problems with it at that stage so I am unclear why it fails to
work from /bin on the hard disk.

This is just one of many problems which I have had in installing Linux.
The most serious problems relate to the confusion over device addresses,
IRQ's and major/minor device numbers. This confusion can result in the
distributor's Boot floppy being unusable. This, in turn, means that
any documentation or source code on the floppy disks or CD is inacessible.
Unfortunately, the developer of the Mitsumi driver decided to remove
the message about the address and IRQ from the information displayed at
boot time. If the address is right but the IRQ is wrong the Mitsumi
driver may partially work but may fail in the middle of copying a
directory with a kernel panic. So far as I am aware, these problems are
not covered in the main FAQ's or HOW-TO's.

I suggest that this experience supports the proposals which I quoted
at the start of this article. I think that the "Linux Consortium",
or whatever it is called, is badly needed -- and not just for novices.

Hello, I am student enrolled in a course called System Engineering.  The course's objective was to set up an electronic network to allow companies to share information.  We have many companies that are interested in participating but we have had some trouble finding the proper communication software to run our network.

The following are the requirements for our network:

- full graphic interface between PC and VAX mainframe with normal phone line

- VAX architecture might be too old and we do have the capacity to upgrade to
  a new system architecture which will be able to handle our demands.



- PC remote station must be able to execute mainframe programs example :

                 - ANSYS
                 - UNIGRAPHICS
                 - MATLAB
                 - XMATH
                 - ALGOR
                 - etc
                 
- menu driven software

- cost minimal; remote station must be able to use this network with minimal cost for
  upgrade

- screen sharing capabilities (real time and transmission rate > 2400 baud) 

- file transfer must have choice of common communication protocols


So far we know of :  PC-X
                     VISIT from Northern Telecom ( cannot be accessed from a                            remote station not having VISIT software)

                     
Any recommandations to what kind of commercial or public domain software we should use will be appreciated.

Yesterday, I recieved a reply to address the comp.os.linux.* groups for help and it also mentioned that the software requirements I need may be meet by a software package called XFREE ?  Will it, if so where can I get some information on it ?


Thank you,

Marco

It seems to be possible:

I just tried  X :1   after switching to text mode, and another X server

answer to you :-)

Here is what 'ps' says:

I think it is syslogd. The kernel code can now use the syslog facilities,

If you mean 8250 by old uart's, this is certainly the problem. Change to
16450 or much better, 16550afn.

                           ----------

Now, I underlined the "few kernel revisions later", because I am experiencing
very bad things whith kernels pl13q, r, and pl14 and the serial port :-((

Linux used to work pretty well, since the early days, with my HST dual modem.
The machine answers the phone and people download megabytes of Linux.
The machine periodically polls for mail and news via uucp.

Now, when the pl13 version came up, the system began to lose characters
when receiving, after 5 or 6 days of intensive use. So I started to reboot
each week to avoid the problem :-)

        The pl13 q and r version, lose received characters after about 2 days.
        The pl14 version lose received characters after some hours... !

I have now to reboot TWO TIMES a DAY the pl14 kernel, if I want good uucp and
zmodem reception :-((  

Ok,  I have just 16450 uart's, but they worked without problems whith all
the previous versions of Linux... Perhaps there is something whith the IRQ's
and the network code (I have an Etherlink II working in the box); the net
works now really well and I don't see any more the "Spurious interrupt.." or
"unknown interrupt" message that the net code was sometimes displaying 
before :-)

I agree 100%.  What Linux really needs is a convention for documentation.
(Not just plain old man pages).
I think the following would be extremely helpful:

ASCII documentation on all software applications, Unix commands, installation,
maintenance, modem installation, typical problems, driver installations and
configurations, hardware setup (cd-rom, hd's, memory), etc, etc, etc.

A standard documentation viewer packaged in the SLS's (and such) for reading
the files in both text and GUI/X mode.  The ability to easily search on
keywords (with simple menu-driven boolean operators) on ALL the documentation
at once.  The ability to print what is on the screen with the touch of a
menu command, or the entire entry.  The ability go jump backwards to topics 
you already look at before.  Uses linedraw, termcap/info, arrow keys,
page-up/down, attributes like bolding, reverse, or color to highlight things,
etc... 

Perhaps an introduction blurb of a few sentences and KEYWORDS, like:

elm:  A full-screen, interactive email application.  Can view, send, reply to,
      print mail, and many other features.  Very configurable.

KEYWORDS:  elm, mail, mailx, mailer, menu-driven, application, etc....

home:      Normally lives in /usr/lib/elm
binary:    /usr/bin/elm, etc...
date:      last documentation update on XX/XX/XX

Then the rest of the documentation, in some standard format.  Could make use
of all the existing documentation if just slightly rearranged.  Man pages
could be used for many commands, with the above headings added, and
possibly a short tutorial/examples.  Hypertext might be too dificult to get
going and have documentation continue to be written :)  But SCO does it on
a lot of their stuff, and it is very nice.  Perhaps an external "hot-index"
based on command/program names and all the keywords; with a simple update
procedure.  And the ability to search the body of all entries looking for
non-specified keywords (probably could not index that because of the size).
