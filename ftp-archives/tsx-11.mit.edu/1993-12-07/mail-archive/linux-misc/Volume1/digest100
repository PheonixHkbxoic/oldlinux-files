   Badly designed by the standards of mini-computers.  It was an awesome

   Yup - but I could ( and did ) twice as much useful work on an IBM-XT than
I ever was able to do on an Apple.  I literally had callouses on my thumb from
doing the "floppy-shuffle" whenever I maintained my employers databases.  Sure,
we could have gotten a Corvus 5MB drive for the Apple.  For the same price as
an XT.

   Because IBM had to be able to produce the system as cheaply as possible.
They were gambling.  If you were a design manager, and had the choice of
creating a 'safe' design and keeping your job, or creating a 'risky' design
that flopped and helped you lose your job, which would you choose?  Sure, you
could have used a 68000.  But it wasn't a proven chip.  The 8086/8 came out four
years before the PC was designed and was field-proven.

   I'm in total agreement that kludges are necessary to load large apps in
DOS.  But then again, you can work around them.  Personally, I tend to use
relatively 'outdated' software because it does everything I need and can
run fast and efficiently on a small machine.  They solve my problems, so
I'm happy.

   As for people wanting multi-tasking, walk into 10 small businesses that
use Windows.  Sneak up on the clerks.  What are they using multitasking
for?

   Running Solitare when the Boss has his door closed. :-)

   Why do car manufacturers come out with new lines every year?  The vehicles
have *exactly* the same base functionality, but the manufacturers tell us
that we'll be hopelessly behind our neighbors if we don't get the latest and
greatest.  And then they manage to sell us absolute trash - take turbochargers,
for example.  Quite possibly the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the car-
buying public.  "Look at all this cheap power you get!"  Translation:  "We
couldn't figure out how to make the engine any smaller or cheaper, so we're
going to add on this horrendously expensive, unreliable, low-life expentancy
gizmo to your car so that when it cracks and needs $2,000 in repairs, we can
sell you a new one."

Err, IBM went with the 8088 because Motorola *wasn't* delivering the 68000
when IBM wanted it.  Check your history.

The PC really was a terrible design back then, and the original design
flaws have propogated to cause some really bad problems now.  There
were some good things about it, without which the PC really would
have been stillborn.  These include:  many bus-master capable general
purpose slots for expansion, seperate video and system memory (not
important then, very important later on), use of a chip with more
than 16 memory address lines (people were already running into the 64K
limits of the 6502, I knew a guy w/ a Atari 800 w/ over 1M of ram on it
back then), MB components not dependent on clock speed (in an absolute 
sense).

The 8088 was chosen over the 68000 for several reasons, primarily because
the 68000 was new and the 8088 was out for a while, but also because
of the 8088's 8-bit data path (cheaper), the 8088 was cheaper itself,
the PC designers had already worked with the 8088 and related chips before,
and IBM was lead to belive from Intel that they were going to bring out 
another chip (upwardly compatable) to replace the 8088 (not the '286 yet,
this Intel chip never did live up to expectations and was stillborn).

        Has anyone patched term, found the correct command

For some reason, my modem always drops it's connection if
someone calls the house.  Now I have a crontab entry that
checks if term is running and tries to finger me on the 
remote machine, if this fails, it shuts down the connection
and restarts it.  It would be much nicer to have it die
on it's own.

SLS version: 1.03
Machine1: NEC Powermate 386
Machine2: Amax PC/386

I've installed the SLS v.1.03 release on three machines.  The two
listed above had the same trouble after installing, making a
bootdisk, and trying to boot from that bootdisk.  The trouble that
came about was when I tried to boot from the bootdisk (5.25" floppy
drive A:).  Just after it prints out that it's trying to detect
sound cards (one of the machines has no sound cards and the other
has a PAS), it just sits there and never goes on.  Can anyone help
me get beyond this?  I've been booting from the install disk and
telling LILO to go to the harddisk where it's installed but I'd
really like to get the boot floppy to work.  The boot messages are
included at the bottom of this post.

The third machine that I installed on (an Insight 486 with a PAS16)
boots fine off of it's boot floppy.

I'm not sure if what I have here is a bug in bash or in procfs. I
expect it's in bash but before I podt to gnu.bash.bug I'd like to try
it here. Here are the symptoms.

bam(bam:other)~$cat /proc/self/fd/0 <<X

cat: /proc/self/fd/0: Permission denied
bam(bam:other)~$

As far as I can see bash creates an unnamed temporary file and passes
it opened to cat. Cat tries to open /proc/self/fd/0 whicd is ths temp file
but somehow this is forbidden. The permissions on the file are OK as
can be see below:

bam(bam:other)~$ls -lL /proc/self/fd/0 <<X

Anyone got any ideas?
