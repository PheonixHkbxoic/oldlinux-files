I think it would be nice if someone would maintain a status and current version
of the major Linux components (Kernel, libc, file systems, gcc, dosemu, etc.)
and post it ever week or two.  This would be handy for those of us who like to
live on the bleeding edge and keep up with the Joneses.  Heck, it might even be
useful for real maintenance.  If such a status list exists and I didn't notice
it, sorry for wasting th' bandwidth.

        Ummm... Most of the echoes are due to the fact that anyone who's
used linux for more than an hour (as you, Mr Leary, obviously have not)
would know that the a large percentage of the 'limitations' quoted for
linux are blatantly out-of-date.  As for "sheep" mentality, linux encourages
one to do one's own thing with the OS, by virtue of the fact that you
_have_ the source to code to it.

        <snort>.  linux has a loadable device driver patch.  And
loadable device drivers is hardly the be-all, end-all of operating
systems.  Ooops?  You mean that program just wrote garbage over the
interrupt table?  So sorry, you'll have to reboot, your system just
crashed hard.

        Yet more proof that Mr. Leary doesn't know what he's talking about.
Technically, linux never crashed when running out of memory, it just took
as long as days to send a segmentation fault.  Now, before you flame this
as being 'equivalent' to locking up (and i'd agree with you that, for all
practical purposes, it is) try doing it with 0.99.12.  It's fixed.

        filesystem is not flaky.  The networking in the kernel is solid,
the ports of BSD Net/2 applications is poor.

        Mr. Leary, get a clue.  Learn something about what it is you're
putting down without a thought.

        Note here that I have not said a word about NT's capabilities.
This is because I've not run NT.  Why not?  Because I have a 386DX/25
with 10M.  This falls far below the minimum system listed as required
my NT.  Yet it runs linux just wonderfully.

 Actually I don't think MS-DOS or Windows uses the printer IRQ, so your
argument is kind of worthless.

 Otherwise I don't understand the point.  This is a fault in the hardware,
Windows NT or SCO Unix or any of them will have similar problems.

 If two devices use the same IRQ, they'll conflict.  Simple as that.

 That's because QIC-80 is a crappy standard which is unsuitable for any
enviornment where your data is important and worth money.
 Around here we use optical drives, and QIC-150/QIC-525 or DAT tape drives.
Much faster, and 4000 times more reliable.

 Oh, we were talking about sheep a little while ago.  Now I haven't had any
problems with the file system.  But obviously one of your sheep buddies must
have said something which you are repeating.

 That's why that quote up above is important.

You know that's pretty vulgar.

 This reminds me of that other quote above, where you complain about people
being vulgar, and how this all started in the windows.advocacy group.

 Hmm?  I think we have a problem with double standards here...

 Have fun.  I still want to know why I can't send you mail?

Uh-uh.  Sorry, but there are *squillions* more MSWin/MSDOS users out

Yes, I agree...  A somewhat ridiculous point.  An NT
would-be-user-if-it-existed using a comms program as an argument
against an OS designed to run over a network.  Can you log into a
remote system using NT?  UUCP vs ZModem *rofl* ;)

It should and will be, but the latest version I found is from end of june, so 
not something I would call up-to-date. I think the lsm is reworked in the
moment (to a database system). Once this work has been done, it will 
be a very fine system, but (as far as I know) it is not here yet.

Basically true, though I think the needs of most CS students would be better
filled by Linux than by NT.

But it doesn't show.  :-)

>It has industry support for every major software vendor.  

I'm not sure what "industry support" is supposed to mean here.  Software
vendors are doing development work for it.  But we all know that they'd do
said work no matter *what* NT looked like, just because it's a Microsloth
product.

>Linux is a hacker's operating system.  

Yup.

>It has virtually no marketing, 

Well, there's the net, but in the commercial world, you're *almost* right.
But not quite.  There are a couple of outfits (Yggdrasil, Softlanding
Systems) that are selling Linux for real cheap ($59 or so gets you a CD
ROM packed with Linux and assorted goodies).

>testing, 

Now *this* is just plain wrong.  Linux probably has more testing under its
belt than Windoze NT will have for a long time.  Why?  Because it's free,
and the user community submits bug reports and, oftentimes, bug fixes, many
times within a few days of the release of something.

Additionally, a large segment of the Linux crowd is technically competent,
so bug reports are *meaningful* as opposed to the useless complaints most
computer-illiterate users generate.  In a way, I feel sorry for companies
like Microsloth, that have to wade through countless "My mouse doesn't work"
style "bug reports".

The biggest difference is that you get source with Linux if you want it.
This is a *huge* win in terms of generating meaningful bug reports.  Not
only can you say "my mouse doesn't seem to work", but you can also say
"check out line 126 of mouse.c.  Notice that dx and dy are declared
unsigned?".  And if you don't understand what's going on, you can look at
the source to figure it out.  I've done that when doing things like porting
screen to Linux (had trouble with the weird Posix controlling terminal
stuff).

Not to mention that if you report a problem with Linux, someone will
usually take it seriously.  I've heard countless stories of people calling
Microsloth's "tech support" with real problems, only to have them say
"We haven't heard of that one.  You must be doing something wrong".  I
need "support" like that the same way that I need a lobotomy.

>or documentation. 

This is about the most glaring fault of Linux.  You get man pages for lots
of things, but there is more rudimentary documentation that needs doing.
However, there's the Linux Documentation Project which is well underway
and is addressing this very problem.

Linux may be underdocumented, but it won't be that way for too much longer.

>The likelihood of the big-name commercial vendors supporting their products it
>is virtually zero.

This is probably true, but then there's no accounting for the stupidity of
commercial vendors.  :-)

Seriously, though, commercial vendors that do *Unix* development will
probably take Linux very seriously sooner than you think, *because* Linux
is such a popular operating system.  The biggest problem they'll have is
competing against all the free software that's already out there.  They'll
have to offer something that is unique and new.

>The technical details of filename limits, memory usage, etc., are just
>irrelevant.  

This depends.  If you don't have enough computer to run NT, guess what
happens?  Right.  You don't run NT.

Filename limits are important to people doing development work and, to a
certain degree, to everyone.  It's damned annoying to be restricted to
8+3 when you really want to call your file "letter_to_john".

Generally speaking, technical details matter *a lot* if they affect the
application you have.  And when it comes to running on cheap hardware
with relatively small amounts of memory and disk space, NT just loses.

>The fundamental differences between NT and Linux far outweight
>any just trivial technicalities.

This is far too general.  *Obviously*, whether or not the fundemental
differences outweigh the "trivial technicalities" depends on what you're
trying to do.  There are some cases (e.g., running Unix software) where
the "technicalities" are of paramount importance.

If what you need can be met by running Linux, then running Linux is most
definitely the way to go, if only because it's free.  If you *have* to
run something that runs under NT but not under Linux, then NT is the thing
to get at least for that one application.

But who says you can't run both?  The only problem doing that is that NT
is a memory and disk space hog in a *big* way, and I have little doubt
that unless someone isn't doing much with it, it'll be using the majority
of the available disk space.

That's CPU intensive because (a) it was written by Microsoft, and if it's
anything like their other products, it's larger than it needs to be and
much less efficient than it could be, and (b) it's running under Windoze,
which has the same characteristics.

Ever try using the terminal program supplied with Windoze on a 1024x768x256
screen?  Interesting how slooooowwwww it scrolls when you compare it with X
under Linux doing the same thing with the same resolution and font size on
the same hardware, *without* jump scroll turned on, isn't it?

Having played with other Windoze applications, I can easily say that the
above experience is not an anomaly.
