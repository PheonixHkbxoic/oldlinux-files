Would it be possible to make a package with the editor only? The same

I never seen ez od iv editors so I don't know which one I really would

   Tell that to the small business that can barely afford to meet payroll from
week to week.  If you're the owner and don't realize the dangers of using
a computer in an environment like that, are you more likely to spend $1000.00
on a good UPS or are you going to pay the salaries of two people for a week?
And even if you *do* realize the danger, do you want to take the 1/100 risk
of having to have your $7.50 hour secretary have to rekey payroll records
two months from now, or would you rather have your primary lathe operator walk

   Sure - and most, if not all, small business problems can be solved by
simple tool solutions applied correctly.  The problems themselves haven't
changed much in the past 20 years.  The solutions, however, have.  The
greatest crime is that people are being sold complex solutions that cost
more in the long run than the simple solutions that actually *work*.

   Yup.  You see that.  I see that.  But using the example I described above,
how many businesses want to hire a part or full time person simply to

   Sure, and you can do the same with any number of DOS tools.  More easily,
for that matter.  ( As anyone who has attempted to recover both a
corrupted superblock *and* an MS-DOS FAT can attest. ;-)

IBM choosed the 8088 mainly because it is almost upward compatible with
the 8080 processor on the assembler level. Most of the popular software
during the first years of the IBM PC was the result of running the
assembly code of a CP/M program through a very simple translator which
did a simple one-to-one opcode and register mapping. WordStar was the
result of such a quick port. So was dBase II. PCDOS 1 made this possible
by almost completely emulating the CP/M interface, including such 
techniques as putting a jump to the terminating code into location
0 and a JSR into the OS into location 5 in the Program Segment Prefix
in order to support CP/Ms calling conventions.

IMHO, this was much more important for the success of the IBM PC
than anything else.

True, but Apple put a lot of effort into preventing other people
from cloning their computers. IBM didn't do that - which is the
second reason why the architecture was such a success. The PS/2
failed, because people (rightfully) suspected that IBM intended
to lock them into their hardware line, just like Apple does
it with their Macintosh line.

A design is always limited. In what way is 16M better than 1M? Supporting
only a flat, linear address space is a limited design, when compared
with segmented memory, IMHO.

What was the first thing Apple did when they implemented the memory management
for the Mac? Right: they implemented memory segmenting on the 68000,
quite similar to the 286s 64K segmenting, without bounds checking and, 
of course, they had to do in software what the 80286 (and in a much
more limited way the 8088) did completely in hardware. At the same time,
they invented the 32K segment and the 8MByte-limit. :-)

I think the problem was that they weren't delivering in the quantity that IBM
wanted.  Even the early Macs were tight early on because of slow delivery
of 68000 chips.

The problem is not with the screen, but rather with the antique video
card. Get a new one, CGAs or low-grade VGAs cost almost nothing these
days. 

You could probably fix the problem in software (prefix every access to
video RAM in the kernel with a wait for retrace), but that isn't worth
the effort, IMHO.

I'm looking to buy one of these beasts in the near future and would

Can anyone give me any details about using an IDE card (with disk)

clear of and and pitfalls people have fallen into in the past.

Also, I have seen people using the terms "SCSI" and "SCSI-2". I
understand that the 1542C is SCSI-2. Will it drive SCSI disks?

Thanks in advance.

Motorola released specs (including assembly language manuals, etc., which
ultimately *were* accurate) for the 68000 in '76 --- but *shipped* it in late
'79.

The IBM PC was shipped in '79 as well.  But there *is* lead time involved in
designing a computer; they'd have needed 68000s available in '78 at the latest
in order to build (and more importantly, ship) a machine based on it.

The fact that these arguments exist, and the fact that all sides have
valid points should make my point obvious:  NT, Linux, DOS, Windows,
(and VMS, TSO, CP/M, etc., etc... :-) all have their places.  There are
undoubtably SPECIFIC instances where DOS is a better choice than Linux,
and others where Linux is better than DOS, and where NT is better than
Windows, others where... You get the idea.  There is, however, no
overwhelmingly 'right' operating system, nor overwhelmingly 'wrong'
one, for ALL purposes.  (If operating systems were vehicles, some of
the past threads would be very close to the obviously silly: "A car is
better than a truck.  Everyone should have a car...")

Rather than categorically slamming NT, Windows, Linux, DOS, or
whatever, I should think an enlightened attitude would be to learn as
much as possible about every operating system or environment.   An
individual with this attitude can hopefully swallow his/her philophical
objections to particular environments or companies, and can objectively
choose the best solution for a given problem.

Since not all environments are available to everyone, I would hope this
thread would attract more (I'm not saying there haven't been any...)
responses from individuals with experience in implementing 'real world'
solutions in Linux AND Windows, or Linux AND NT, or UNIX AND NT, etc.,
and who could OBJECTIVELY compare them, feature for feature, for the
benefit of those of us who must make informed choices and
recommendations.
