        Bootptab and the daemon that uses this table config file
        have to do with terminal servers on a network querying
        your machine for access so if this is not relevent to you
        you could probably delete it.

Good idea, and perhaps Jeff Kopmanis would also like to be informed

Specifically do the following things:

1. Get the finger source from sunsite.unc.edu
   (/pub/Linux/system/Network/finger/finger.tar.Z)

2. Determine the size of an entry in your lastlog, e.g., by performing
   'od' and locating tty names.

3. Modify lastlog.h in finger's directory accordingly and move this file
   to /usr/include

4. Make and install the new finger.

I will bet that your entries are 12 bytes long and that
your favorite contents of lastlog.h are as follows:

#ifndef _lastlog_h
#define _lastlog_h

struct lastlog {
        long    ll_time;
        char    ll_line[7];
        char    ll_host[1];

/*  This was the default:
        char    ll_line[12];
        char    ll_host[16];    */      /* same as in utmp */
};

#endif /*!_lastlog_h*/

Subject: Looking for recommendations regarding SCSI equipment
Date: 29 Oct 93 20:05:10 GMT



I am going to buy some SCSI equipment for my Linux box and I would like to
hear from people who have similar setups. The list of the supported and 
unsupported controllers is more or less clear; however, there have been
numerous complaints regarding apparently supported but misbehaving pieces
of equipment.

At his moment I have a 486DX66/33 EISA motherboard with 16MB of memory,
256KB cache, two internal disks (250Mb each), and a GUS sound card. A few days
ago I visited my dealer and came up with the following possible additions:

      CTR SCSI ADAPTEC 1540C (ADP-71-0021 JB)
      HD 1.03GB SCSI2 Fujitsu (FJS-70-000 JB)
      TD 525M SCSI VIPER 2525S (MND-71-0006 JB)

Apparently, 1540C is supported by Linux at this time. I wonder if somebody
has been using the above (or a similar) equipment and can share with me
their experience. I am flexible and can buy anything in the price/capacity
range of the above items, thus I am very open for suggestions.

It seems to me that a publicly available list of configurations that various
people are using happily may be of enormous help to the users who try to
build or upgrade their boxes. Most traffic in the groups is related to
problems, and (quite understandably, and perhaps fortunately :-) nobody
bothers to write that he/she is happy with his/her setup. Owing to the
diversity of the PC-compatible machinery, a database of this sort may not
be completely useless.

Thanks in advance for your comments,

Subject: Gateway 2000 Pentium Linux
Date: 30 Oct 93 03:13:31 GMT

The memory bus in Gateway 2000 "Best Buy" computers is clocked
at the same speed as the 60 MHz Pentium processor and moves 64 bits
at a time between the processor and the 70 nanosecond Dynamic RAM.
They use Intel's 32-bit 30 MHz PCI bus instead of the VESA Local Bus
architecture used by AMBRA.  They have a larger hard disk drive
but only a 16-bit 30 MHz disk controller.  You will wait at least
SEVEN WEEKS for delivery from the day you place your order.

I was able to get the information I needed from Gateway 2000 immediately.
Their Sales Representatives new much more about their product than their
counterparts at AMBRA knew about theirs.

Gateway 2000 will NOT install Linux or any other software options.

I called the toll free number (1-800-846-2063) for Gateway 2000
and got Sales Representative Monroe Beauchene at extension 5684.
He quoted me a price of $2995 for their "Best Buy" Pentium based
system which includes:

*       60 MHz Intel Pentium processor with 256KB 20 ns cache
*       8MB 70 ns system memory expandable to 128MB
*       4 ISA, 2 PCI and 1 ISA/PCI combination slots
*       Tower case with 30O-watt power supply
*       424MB Western Digital IDE hard disk drive
*       16-bit, 30 MHz disk controller
*       14", 0.28mm dot pitch non-interlaced Super VGA color monitor
*       1280x1024 PCI ATI ULTRA XLR with 2MB DRAM
*       1 parallel and 2 serial ports
*       Keyboard and Microsoft mouse

This system does not have nearly all the features of a Sun SPARCstation 10
Model 30.  But it should be sufficient to compare the performance of the two
systems.  All we need is for someone to put their money where my mouth is.

Monroe Beauchene did mention that Gateway 2000 has a University program
under which it might be possible to obtain one of these systems for 30 days
evaluation if we could find someone to install Linux and run benchmarks.

I had hoped it was obvious, but maybe it's not.  I don't answer questions that
are posted in the wrong newsgroup, nor questions that are posted to all c.o.l.
newsgroups.  I encourage everyone else to do the same.

The "wrong" newsgroups is a subjective measure, but here are some guidelines:

"How do I get _my_ configuration to work" should never appear in c.o.l.d., but
should be c.o.l.help or c.o.l.admin instead.  I read the c.o.l.help newsgroup
_before_ I read any others, and I've seen plenty of postings by the experts
there, so you aren't "going to where the gurus are" by posting in c.o.l.d.

"Is the XYZ hardware supported" shouldn't be on c.o.l.d. either, but should be
in c.o.l.misc.

"Is anyone working on the XYZ hardware driver" is (barely) on the right side of
marginal for c.o.l.d., but still might not get a response if it's in the FAQ
or a HowTo.

"Is anyone _else_ working on the XYZ hardware driver" is probably OK for c.o.l.d.

"I'm having a few problems with my new XYZ hardware driver" will definitely
get a response if I can help.

Guten Tag!

Due to the fact that some of my users are no Unix wizards I am looking for
some introduction paper for them to learn the basics.

It's for a Linux system but needs not to be special written for this OS.

It would be fine if it is available as plain ascii file. However, dvi or
postscript will do it too. Even references to printed books/papers will
be interesting for me.

Please tell me the exact locations and names of mentioned files!

Thank you in advance!

Subject: Textmode charset
Date: 30 Oct 1993 04:33:37 GMT


Guten Tag!

Printing some files containing characters of the IBM charset (blocks and
lines and suchs) yields funny results on a Linux virtual console. The
characters seem to be mapped by some scheme to other characters. However,
it's not just a 8bit->7bit conversion.

On the other hand, if someones dials in over serial line and displays the
same files on his terminal (Telemate on MS-DOS in this case) he sees the
completely correct results.

The files contain no ANSI escape sequences. They are plain 8bit text files
with IBM charset.

What's going on? How can I fix this without changing the files? Is it possible
at all to display the IBM charset on a virtual console?

This would be quite important for me because these files are the welcome
screens of my former bbs which was replaced by a linux dial in. It was a lot
of work to design them, my users like them and I would love to continue to
use them, as well on the dial-in screens as on the local consoles where some
of my users work sometimes.

Any information will be appreciated. Thank you in advance.

   I guess some of us feel that it is important to acknowledge the author of
   the product as well as not to mislead people into thinking that Linux is
   only available as a commercial product.

Probably an unrealistic expectation for an advertisement.  Certainly
if *I* advertise packet drivers anywhere, I'm going to "sell" them
for mondo bucks, and provide support also.

And no, I would NOT include the FTP site nor BBS number.

Just thought of this and figured it might be of interest.

SSC's new catalog just came back from the printer today and it has
one page in it on Linux. Half the page is about SSC selling the Yggdrasil
distribution but the other half is about Linux, the Linux newsgroups and
ftp sites where people can get the code.

The first 15,000 of those catalogs will be mailed next week.  As SSC
hasn't been in the Linux business but most of our customers (probably 90%)
are UNIX users it should be interesting to see how many of these people
show up in these newsgroups or mention Linux when when order products
from SSC.  (We ask what UNIX version you run on the order form but, as far
as I know, there has never been a 'Linux' put in that blank.)

:-) :-) It seems you don't read gnu.gcc.announce :-) :-)

We got about half a dozen articles in one week announcing new
"bug-fixed" versions of gcc 2.4.x when it came out. They made
a bit of a mess of the first 2.5.0 release as well :-)
(A file or two were missing)

I also had this file (or it might have been /dev/ttys2 or ttys1),
so I deleted it and created symlinks from /dev/ttySx to /dev/ttysx,
as it was quite obvious that some program in SLS had not been
changed from using ttysx to ttySx (I believe ttysx were the old
names used for the serial device..?)
