Date: 1 Dec 1993 10:38:50 GMT

I have just come across a box filled with unused video card but I have
no docs. There isn't much on the boards to identify them except

        NEC Home Electronic (USA) Inc. mva 1024 rev3 assy 22800

The board has a TMS 34010 and three gate arrays (??) marked Paradise
plus a bunch of 41464 and 41264 RAM and a DB-9 connector.

Does anybody know what type of video cards they are. Does a driver for Linux
exist if not would it be worth while to write one?

Thanks

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

I'm not using MS-Windoze so I can't say how much faster/slower X is, but
anyway: I've got 8 MB RAM and a 10 MB swap file and I'm using X with gcc
quite comfortably.
        The problem is that you mention "xv". My experience shows that you
can't avoid swapping when you run xv on e.g. a 640x400 (or larger) image,
esp. when it tries to do some processing. The consequence is that it's
sloooow.
        Everything else apart from graphics processing is perfectly
acceptable. When I compile a large file with gcc something which is not in
use may get swapped out (e.g. some xterm, xman, ...) but swapping it in
again when I want to use it is quite fast (i.e. in the 1-second range).

So basically the conclusion is: Don't expect good performance for
interactive graphics, but most other tasks will fit fine into 8 MB RAM.

No it doesn't matter. Swapping is always slow, no matter whether you have a
30 ms drive or a 12 ms drive. Swapping is only acceptable for removing
*unused* pages from RAM, but a task running interactively should never be
swapped out. If this happens, you should definitely get yourself more RAM
(instead of a faster drive :-)

IMHO, the main problem with a Linux Consortium is not that they
are trying to provide a testing channel for distributions (since
that is what it essentially is, after all), but that they seem
to try to make it sound official.  It isn't.  There's no way to
make it official, without the permission of Linus and the other
authors of the software, and that doesn't seem likely.

At least this suggestion doesn't want Linus to effectively assign
the copyright to them.  (This was suggested on the mailing list
by someone else than the current suggester.)

Subject: Need help deciphering jumpers on 2S/1P/1G board
Date: Wed, 1 Dec 1993 05:21:17 GMT

Hello
        I recently obtained a used 2S/1P/1G comm board which came without
any documentation and no indication of the manufacturer.  Through, trial and
error I have managed to jumper the board to COM3/COM4/LPT2, and can talk to
the board fine as evidenced by my modem dialing, however I never receive any
echo or data back from the board.  I have verified both the cable to my modem
and the cable from the board connector out to the D-shell using my other comm
board.  Both DOS and Linux recognize the com ports at the right addresses and
irqs.  The second parallel port works like a champ.

The board has a label of "CT-450" and does have 16550s on it.  On the outside 
edge of the card are the connectors for ribbon cables for the 2 serial ports
and 2 sets of jumpers.  The left set is labeled S2 and had 6 positions.  The 
right set is labeled S1 and has 4 positions.  Through trial and error I have
figured out that the right 3 positions on S1 control setting the serial and
parallel ports to be at COM1/3, COM2/4, and LPT1/2 respectivly.  

As I said above I can send data to the COM3 or COM4 ports but never recieve any
data back.  If anyone out there has a similar board and can provide the jumper
settings or any suggestions I would be most appreciative.

Please reply via E-mail as I don't read these groups that often and I will
summarize to the net if there is any interest.

Thanks.

And Windows 3.1 and the Borland C++ 3.1 IDE.  (But I use DOSEMU for my favorite
DOS applications, Quicken 7.0 for DOS and Railroad Tycoon, and it works
great!)  No reboots anymore here, except when I need to do DOS application

Subject: Handbook 486 and Linux
Date: 1 Dec 1993 11:07:07 -0500

        Well, after some trouble and confusion, I got SLS installed and
running. My installation notes and first-pass evaluation follows:


Bringing Linux/SLS up on Handbook 486.

    I have the 40MH DX2 handbook with the 130MB hard drive. I decided to
give linux an 90MB partition, plus 4MB for swapping, and leave the rest for
a DOS partition. If you only have 4MB of RAM, you must create a swap
partition or install will not run.

    I tried the base + X installation with an 80M partition (it allegedly
only needs 70) but it took 78M and filled the filesystem, so I tried again
with 90M. If X doesnt' work I'll repartition again and make the linux
partition much smaller.

    You really need the external floppy drive for this operation, don't
rely on the emergency boot partition (I believe it gets wiped out by
linux's fdisk, at least I tried to switch to it after running fdisk, just
to see if it was there, and I couldn't boot).

create the main and swap partitions with fdisk
you will get an error message from fdisk from the large partition - ignore it.
change partition type for 1 to 83h - Linux Extended

<reboot>
mke2fs -c /dev/hda1 90000
if you get an error about no place to put inodes or some such, you
forgot to make the partition type 83 instead of 81 (the default).

mkswap /dev/hda2 10350 (number reported by fdisk for this partition)
swapon /dev/hda2

now you can run install...

doinstall /dev/hda1
swap disks till you run out...

if install asks for disks, then never accesses the drive, you forgot to
tell it to swap.

For some inexplicable reason, the zImage that SLS installs on your HD and
on the boot disk hangs during booting. The zImage on the floppy disk works
fine - they are different sizes btw. I managed to get it to boot from the 
harddrive by copying in the zImage from the install disk. I am rather
disturbed that I had to do this, and I'm thinking of reinstalling with
Slackware, but at least I know Linux works on this machine (so I don't need
to worry about whether to send it back).
        To copy the zImage from the install disk:
Boot from the a1.3 disk, when you see the word LILO hit alt
type harddisk root=/dev/PART (where PART is your root partition, /dev/hda1
        is the default)
log in as root
mkdir floppy
mount /dev/fd0 /floppy
cp zImage zImage.bak
cp /floppy/zImage zImage

shutdown and reboot. Linux should come up just fine.
You will need to add the swap partition to the /etc/fstab file, the install
doesn't do this for you - add the following line:
/dev/hda2       none            swap    defaults


        Observations so far - it feels fairly zippy, except when you are
waiting for the hard drive to spin up. If you are running off the AC
adapter, you can set the power manager to optimal performance so this will
not be a problem. The boot process reports 19.97 Bogomips (for whatever
that's worth - it's a bit faster than my 33/486 desktop which is as it
should be). I haven't gotten X configured yet - more notes to follow when I
do. I periodically get error messages "Unexpected HD interrupt" - I'm not
sure what causes it, but it doesn't seem to cause any harm, the machine
keeps right on going. 

   There is a fairly serious problem with the resume feature - namely if
the machine has been suspended for more than a few minutes it spontaniously
reboots when it resumes. This is bad under DOS, really bad for Windows,
and a major lose for Unix, for obvious reasons. The temporary fix is to
at least sync the disk, preferably shutdown before closing the box. I hear
rumors of a flash BIOS upgrade that addresses this problem, I'll look into
it.

    All in all I'm pretty happy despite the problems. I had to expect some
difficulties if I insisted on being on the 'bleeding edge' :-)  - At least
to me it's worth some trouble to have a unix system that fits in my purse 
and is light enough to carry everywhere, I can do a lot of stuff offline
instead of snarfing a modem on panix for hours at a time.
