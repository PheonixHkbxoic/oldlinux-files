Yup - I'm doing it here.  One of the monitors needs to be an MDA/Hercules,
while the other uses any of the color cards.  Simply pop both of the
adapters into your system, modify the XConfig so that you include
HGC2, and away you go.  :-)

BTW - I'm using the mono server.  I don't know if this will work with the
color server, as well.

This is an option *for OS/2*, so it can tell where to install itself.
It's not necessary for Linux and probably a *bad idea*.  I just left
my linux partitions marked as bootable and everything was fine (with MCC).

that's what I used..I personally recommend against 81, even I'm sure it works

I'd take the installable flag off that partition; I'm betting that's

Hmm there may be a significant problem here with a group of motherboards...
We recently bought 10 boards with an AMD 40mhz cpu, ami bios etc.. the problem
is that there is no jumper on the MB to set whether there is a co-pro or not and
no matter what is set in the bios, linux reports a co-pro using IRQ 13.

ALSO any dos app using clipper fails on these machines, clipper spots the non
existant co-pro and tries to use it, causing all sorts of interesting errors...

The only distinguishing feature about these motherboards is that they are 
designed to be upgradeable to a 486sx from a 386dx so perhaps that bit of
the hardware has been badly designed in some manner.  (The 386 chip sits in
a mounting block which plugs into what seems to be a pretty standard 486 socket
)  my only conclusion is that the company responsible has taken a 486 MB
added some glue logic to make it work with a 386 in a special mount and has
forgotten about the non existance of a co-pro on the 386 .... :-(

so if anyone else has this problem try running a clipper app on it if it fails
spectacularly, you may rest assured it is not anything to do with linux.

Reply-To: juergen@jojo.sub.org

I try to configure cnews with linux. But I experience several
problems. The biggest problems of all is, that there is abso-
lutely no documentation besides that README file in ..local/lib/news,
which seems to be too little to learn how cnews works.

So if someone has a more comprehensive introduction to cnews with
notes regarding the configuration of cnews, then send it to me.
At present I have no direct access to FTP, else I would look around
and try to get some information via FTP.

Thanks,

Juergen

If you get any responses to this, I'd be interested.  I know there is
something online which you might try compiling, called maxima-4-155
which you might be interested in.  But it might not do everything
you're looking for.  I myself have sent e-mail to Wolfram asking them
whether they'd be interested in a port to Linux or 386bsd, and they
haven't responded.  However, in my latest edition of the Mathematica
Newsletter they mentioned they are porting to several new
architectures /systems, including NextStep for Intel.  This version is
currently in the testing stage, which is a far cry from the 'planning'
stages of some of the other architectures...

Hope this helps.

I've acquired an AST CC-432 4 port serial board. I bought it
because I recalled AST boards were Linux-friendly.

But I checked the HARDWARE file and saw no mention of it, except
indirectly.

1) What do I have to do (if anything) to my kernel (99.12)?
2) How should I configure the board's switches?
3) This board was OEM'ed as an Olivetti product {Anyone need 286-Xenix
installation instructions in German, French or Italian;-?} Does anyone
have the AST doc's I could get copies of parts of?

Shouldn't we set up a list with software products we would like and the count
of people who are interested in it ? This list might help the commercial 
developers to see, what products are really wanted by the Linux Community.
I think of something like:

Games 
1               Symcity         99
2               Another Game    79 
.....

WordProcessors
1               WordPerfect     199
2               MsWord          1
.....

Databases         
1               Oracle          35
2               Informix-Online 17
.....

This are real arguments for software developers although of course this list
is not too represantative, but it would give an idea about what people like.
If no one else volunteers, I would maintain that list, although I don't have
too much time.

This suggests that there are different versions. I think however that
when it will be compiled on a kernel that is not too old (or somewhat
below) it will run everywhere. Especially when statically linked. They
might provide two binaries, one dynamically thinked and one
statically.

Or better even, provide the unlinked objects so that you can link it
dynamically with any future version of the X-libs.

  Don't they have to have either a dynamically-linked program or make

Would this include a list of Linux consultants?  If it doesn't already
exist, the forming International Linux LUG could keep such a list.

Also, it seems we need a mailing list of activists who are willing to
promote Linux as the poster said, by writing articles and also by
hounding manufacturers so that they know we are here.  Perhaps on this
note someone could suggest a worthy cause to initially rally behind -
for our first letter writting session.  I imagine it saying something

Yep!. In general

- ALWAYS use function prototype either
  a) in your header files for global functions
  b) in your source files for local functions

- Use the ANSI style declaration for your function header itself, i.e. use

  foo(float a, int b)
  {
     ...
  }

  instead of

  foo(a, b)
  float a;
  int b;
  {
      ...
  }

  Especially if you want to pass a float as a float you must use the ANSI
  convention. Otherwise your float will implicitely be passed as a double.

If you apply these two rules you will never get any strange behaviour
wether you write 1 or 1.0 etc. So far I am programming only on MSDOS and,
therefore, I do not know the compiler switches for GCC, but there must be
one to force the compiler to EXPECT function prototypes.

Hi There!

There's a Program called muPAD from the university of Paderborn
in Germany which does not only behave (roughly) as a MAPLE clone,
but is intended to be used either on parallel machines (sequent, I think),
or to simulate parallel network topologies on sequential machines.
It is available for SunOS/OW, for Linux and for Macintoshes.
It is distributed *for free* to educational institutions.

As far as I know, you can ask for a registration form from:
MuPAD-distribution@uni-paderborn.de.

Hope this helps,
