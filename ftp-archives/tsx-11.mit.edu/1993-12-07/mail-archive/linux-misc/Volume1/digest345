I have a connection 9600+ modme(its one of those software upgradeables)
and i hope to install linux sometime soon,but since the modem has to
look to the hard drive for the ROM configuration(dos file)i wanted to
know how i could use linux and  still use my modem.
Any Ideas?
also,how do dos and Linux work together on the same hard drive?

   :Why is it every time someone ask for a word processor the response is
   :"It looks to me you should try TeX"?

In my article I did tell him that TeX isn't a word processor.
I even showed him a sample of a TeX document so that he could
decide for himself what kind of thing TeX (or LaTeX) is.
Perhaps Tim hadn't heard about TeX yet ?
In my article I told him to try it out IF HE HADN'T TRIED IT OUT
EARLIER. JUST SO THAT HE COULD DECIDE FOR HIMSELF HOW TEX IS.

As you yourself are saying :
   :I use LaTeX. It's not a word processor. It's not WYSIWYG. It's not going
   :to do the job that Tim wants.

   :Just because TeX is the only piece of software available to do the job
   :doesn't mean that we should be satisfied with it.

Well, I rest my case.
TeX is certainly worth trying out. If you don't like it, don't use it.

   :Fortunately there is a Linux WP project afoot. It has gone underground because
   :every time someone asks about it the TeXWar (sorry Bill Shatner) begins.

   :So my answer is:

   :Tim, there isn't a word processor that will do what you want to do right now.

   :   to TeX. However in the few times I've used it I've found it to be slow
   :   can cumbersome. Also the documentation says no equations.
   :3) If any dos pacakges solve your problem then run them under DOSEMU.

Hi all,

I am in urgent need of the Seiko CM-1430 monitor timings found in the  
Xconfig file. The timings should be for the "1024x768i" resolution. In the  
Xconfig file, it should look something like this:

             Clock        Horizontal       Vertical
"1024x768i"   45      1024 768 445 987  768 234 567 867

The timings are not the ones for the SONY CM-1430 monitor. So PLEASE, if  
anyone out there has these particular numbers, I would be most grateful  
for a copy. Thanx in advance !!!

LaTeX has built-in graphics facilities that are quite adequate for

Please everybody have in mind that this is the infamous JANA CDROM under a

taking over their distribution.
BTW my disk arrived too - also in a broken jewel box, unmarked and grossly

SOMETHING - as cheap as possible.
I did actually like the very first CDROM from them - it was the only low cost

I like it just fine. But it wasn't what Tim asked for. The fact of the matter
the tool Tim wanted doesn't exist. That's the first thing that needed to be
said.

That's DOC. I talked about it in my reply. It sucks but it's the right idea.
There is a man page on it in Slackware. I don't know about the others.

I'm afraid you need another Linux box to achieve that. On this box, 
compile a kernel with 1522 support. Then mount your wanna-be boot disk
on this machine. Copy the new kernel to the boot disk. You're done. You
might do as well if you have Linux installed already. In this case `other
machine' -> `your machine'. You'll lose the original slackware boot kernel,
though, but you should be able to live with it. Just watch out that the
kernel version is the same as the new slackware's (pl13 vanilla, I think).

Hope this helps.

Ciao,
hm

Interviews "doc".  486DX2 and 16MB RAM recommended; it's a huge, slow pig.
Which is why it hasn't caught on as a word processor.

Sorry, it's not that easy.

You'll have to hold the left shift key while you boot the bootdisk you
want to change and enter 'floppy'. Then, log in, mount your hard drive
under /root, and copy the new kernel onto the boot disk. Then, type
'/etc/lilo/lilo', umount /root, sync, and pop the disk out when the light
shuts off.

The Slackware alpha bootdisk already has 0.99pl13r, though. It should
support the 1522, but you might have to pass the kernel some parameters or
play with IRQs, I/Os, or other things you can adjust on the card. And, if
this works you'll also have to use the Q disk series so you put an alpha
kernel on your hard drive.

        The stock XFree86 1.3 server does not guess video clock values
for the ATI Ultra Pro, although it will print an informative error message
telling you the clock values that you must manually add to your Xconfig
file.  I have always believed that a computer should not require reentry
of information that it already has, at least ideally.  So I made the X
server in LGX Fall 1993 automatically use these clock values if you have
an ATI Ultra Pro ISA card.  (The ATI Ultra Pro VLB card turned out to be
slightly different, so you have to put in clock values manually.)  You
can get a copy of the LGX VGA X server by anonymous FTP from:
