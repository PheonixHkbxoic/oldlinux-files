Hi there,

I'm using a HP DJ500, and wanted to use Ghostscript to print some
PS files.  I've installed ghostscript 2.6.1pl4 without problem,
but I don't know how to write a filter for it. Can somebody
send it to me. Thanks.

P.S. I know it's not very linux-related, but I've nowhere to
     turn, since the gnu.ghostscript.bug isn't a right place neither.

Sams

Now here we go. The cachemes.exe program was published in c't magazine
in Jan. 93. You can grab a copy of the source code (TP) from one of the
following ftp servers:
        ftp.uni-paderborn.de
        ftp.uni-regensburg.de
        chio.rz.uni-duesseldorf.de
        ftp.zrz.tu-berlin.de
The uuencoded binary is some 23k, so I did not post it here.

The program does some moving around of 8k memory blocks and tries to
figure out whats happening by measuring the time needed. In particular,
you should expect different results for read misses with the cache
dirty and with the cache clean. If both ratings are the same, your
cache does not have the dirty-tag RAM. It later gives its opinion on
the memory performance of your system with a small operating system
(like DOS) and with a large operating system (like Windoze, ahem).

Now here are the results from some motherboards I got hold of. All
systems had a 486 DX/2:

Chipset               Micronics     UMC         Headland (2 Mem. Banks)
=======================================================================
Cache    (*)          256k WT       256k WB     none
Settings (*)          F             O           F           O

best                  30.5          21.4        28.5        30.8
read miss clean       22.5          16.5        -           -
read miss dirty       -             16.5        -           -
worst                 11.7           8.5        15.3        19.4

DOS performance       18.7 MB/s     14   MB/s   19.1 MB/s   20.1 MB/s
Windoof perf.         13.3 MB/s     10.5 MB/s   15.3 MB/s   19.4 MB/s

(*) WT = Write Through
    WB = Write Back
    F  = Factory Settings
    O  = Optimized Settings (after messing around with chipset registers)

As can be seen, the WB motherboard did not have the dirty-tag RAM. It
would be interesting to know how WB motherboards with dirty-tag RAM
compare. Maybe someone else can give some results?

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

   OK.  But it's hard to take the project seriously when you insist on
   calling it a cutesy name like "The Hurd" rather than just "Hurd."  Are
   there other operating systems called "Hurd" from which you are trying
   to differentiate your project?  "Oh, this isn't just any Hurd, it's
   THE Hurd."

   It sounds too much like Mr. Trump, AKA "The Donald."

The accent isn't on "the", it's on "Hurd".  I chose that usage to
further the pun with "herd".  In English, apart from proper nouns,
most singular common nouns (*) take an article.  "Herd" is such a
noun.

(*): The exceptions are those which are sole exemplars (such as
"beauty") and those which are nouns of substance (such as "sugar").

It can be found in either the comp.sources.unix or comp.sources.misc

Hi Sams,

we're using ghostscript in our Sun-cluster to emulate a Postscript queue ( that's
what you want to do ? ) Therefore you need definition in your printcap like that :

ps|postscript|Postscript:\
        :lp=/dev/ttya:br#19200:\
        :ms=parenb,parodd,-cstopb,-clocal,raw,-opost,ixon:\
        :sd=/var/spool/ps:\
        :lf=/var/adm/lpd-errs:sh:sf:\
        :if=/etc/gsfilter:tr=\f:

The special line of interest is the last with if=/etc/gsfilter. This runs a script
/etc/gsfilter whenever this queue becomes active. In /etc/gsfilter holds the
follwing lines :

#!/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/export/steffi/local/bin:/usr/bin
gs -q -dSAFER -sDEVICE=sie9022 -sNOPAUSE=1 -sOutputFile=- -

That's all ! It works fine with the Suns and also in my private Linux box ( for
which I don't have the printcap and script handy but it's the same thing ) You 
just have to adapt the definitions of your output device in printcap ( instead of
/dev/ttya lets say /dev/lp1 or so ) and in the call to gs ( instead of sie9022
the right name for your printer ).

Have fun and good luck !

Well - what I always wanted to know:  How  many  of  you  have  a
_real_ interest in Linux on a ALPHA system? 

If you have a look at my mail address you will see that (1) I  am
posting  from  a DEC address - documentation should be no problem
here (2) maybe you remember PCS - then you will know that we have 
a lot of experience in porting unix systems [for  you  who  don't
know:  PCS  was the very first company in Europa with an own UNIX
port]. 

But - if I want to convince a manager to give me (or others) time 
and/or ressources for "a Great Thing" they  will  definitely  ask
about profit. 

How many of you would buy an ALPHA box with a  (free)  Linux  who
would _not_ buy an ALPHA box without Linux? 

DISCLAIMER: I am working for DEC, but  I  am  not  authorized  to
speak  for  them  nor  do I intend to do so. I do not promise you
anything, nor do I want to give any impressions.  I  am  speaking

I just added a second drive to my system yesterday and it seemed
much slower than with one drive, which I didn't expect at all.
I guess this is because copying within one drive makes good
use of the buffer cache (which seems to be optimized for one drive,
writing the blocks in order), but the two drives can't operate
simultaneously (or nearly so).

You can get a few introductory files (in german) with gopher-ing to
gopher.boku.ac.at 70, directory BOKU EDV-Zentrum, directory Unix-Software,
files Was ist Unix, Sicherheit unter Unix, Zugriff auf Unix-Rechner.

If you dont have gopher yet, get the gopher Unix client or the PC client

thats right.  Mach development was largely an excercise in VM techniques.
Ever looked at the x-kernel work?

gcc wasn't just a rewrite of pcc to make it free.  GNU put in the
current compiler technology.  Neither is hurd a rewrite of BSD.
