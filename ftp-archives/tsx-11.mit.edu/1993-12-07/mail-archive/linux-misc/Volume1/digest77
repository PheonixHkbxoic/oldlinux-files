   What are your definitions?  Back each one up with a cite to a major operating
   systems text, please.

   --Tim Smith


Well, here's one I did a while ago for your reading pleasure:

I thought with all the argument over "Is Windows an OS?", a good definition
of what an Operating System really is was in order.  Unfortunately,  this is
not an easy task -- general definitions tend to be too vague, and most
definitions that are "specific" only include examples of what an OS is
supposed to do.  That is, they tend not to be definitive.  However, I have
collected a number of references, in order to obtain some sort of concensus.
They are:
        1.)  "Fundamentals of Operating Systems", by A.M. Lister;  Springer
                -Verlag, New York, Inc., Second Edition, 1979.
        2.)  "Operating System Elements, A User Perspective", by Peter
                Calingaert;  Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1982.
        3.)  "Operating Systems Theory", by Edward G. Coffman, Jr., and
                Peter J. Denning;  Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1973.
        4.)  "Operating Systems", by Harry Katzan, Jr.;  Van Nostrand
                Reinhold Company, 1973.
        5.)  "Computer Operating Systems (For micros, minis and mainframes)"
                by David Barron;  Chapman and Hall Computing, 1984.
        6.)  "Computer Organization", by V. Carl Hamacher, Zvonko G. Vranesic,
                and Safwat G. Zaky;  McGraw-Hill, 1990.

These are all random books I chose from the library's stock, except for #6,
which is my Computer Architecture class's text.  It offers a short definition
of an operating system, but OS's are not the book's main thrust.


What is an OS?
=============

Coffman and Denning: "A computer system may be defined in terms of the
various supervisory and control functions it provides for the processes
created by its users:
        1.  Creating and removing processes.
        2.  Controlling the progress of processes, i.e., ensuring that each
logically enabled process makes progress and that no process can block
indefinitely the progress of others.
        3.  Acting on exceptional conditions arising  during the execution
of a process, e.g., arithmetic or machine errors, interrupts, addressing
errors, illegal or privileged instructions, or protection violations.
        4.  Allocating hardware resources among processes.
        5.  Providing access to software resources, e.g., files, editors,
compilers, assemblers, subroutine libraries, and programming systems.
        6.  Providing protection, access control, and security for
information.
        7.  Providing interprocess communication and synchronization.

These functions must be provided by the system since they cannot
always be handled correctly or adequately by the processes themselves.
The computer system software that assists the hardware in
implementing these functions is known as the operating system."
(p.1-2)


Katzan: "An operating system is an organized collection of programs
and data that is specifically designed to manage the resources of a
computer system and to facilitate the creation  of computer programs
and control their execution on that system."
(p. 3)

Katzan further breaks down the resources into Hardware; CPU, I/O
devices, I/O channel time, and space on direct-access storage
devices; and Information resources; placement and sharing of files.


Lister: "Broadly speaking there are two design objectives in the
construction of an operating system.  The first is to transform
a raw piece of hardware into a machine which is amenable to its
potential users.  This may be looked on as presenting the user
with a virtual machine, whose characteristics are different from,
but more tractable than, the underlying physical machine.
For example....
[....]
The second design  objective in operating system construction is
to give good value for money..."
(p. 1)


Calingaert: "The system programs that constitute operating systems
are controllers, or control programs.  Their object is to facilitate
the sharing of a computer system by several users, either
sequentially or concurrently.  Examples include storage allocators,
disk access schedulers, job dispatchers, and interrupt handlers.
[...]
Operating systems provide their services to the users chiefly by
allocating resources to users and perhaps by withdrawing resources
from users.  This management of resources is a central function
of operating systems..."
(p. 2-3)

Calingaert breaks resources down to "storage space and processor
instruction cycle time".  He includes "main storage" (memory),
"backing storage" (magnetic media), I/O channels, processor time,
etc.

Barron: "We can thus define the function of an operating system
as being to provide a convenient environment for the user(s) of
a computer system, whatever their requirements...
(p. 2)

Unfortunately, although Barron's is the only book that deals at
all with microcomputers, his definition for a micro-os is even
weaker than the rather weak one above:
"In the case of the personal computer, there is only one user,
and the sole function of the operating system is to  implement
the user-interface."
(p. 2)
According to his definition, anything with an interface is an
operating system on a PC:(.

Barron breaks down the functions of the os into that of kernel
and superstructure.
        Kernel: "concerned with sharing resources and
interfacing to the machine hardware"
        e.g.    - interrupt handling
                - storage management
                - processor scheduling
        Superstructure: "provide[s] the user environment"
        e.g.    - filing system
                - command language

One last note about Barron - he includes CP/M in his book,
but not strictly as an operating system, rather a "disc operating
system".  He notes that it is a simplistic concept borrowed from
the world of minis, and lists these three parts of the system:
        1. BDOS - the "heart" which provides the file system.
        2. CCP - Command Control Processor - loads and
executes programs.
        3. BIOS - hardware dependent provided by manufacturers.
(p. 26)


Hamacher, Vranesic, Zaky: "...a key system software component
called the operating system (OS).  This is a large program, or more
properly a collection of routines, that is used to control the sharing
and  interaction among various computer units as they execute
application programs.  The OS routines perform the tasks required
to assign computer resources to individual application programs.
These tasks include assignment of main memory and magnetic disk
space to program and data files, moving daata between memory and
disk units, and handling I/O operations."
(p. 15)

Also listed under "Operating System" in the index are interrupts,
memory management, multitasking, process, protection, and
scheduling.

=======================

Basically, the salient aspects of operating systems that I can pull
out of this is that an OS is a collection of programs that:
        1. Manages resources at the hardware level.
        2. Provides access to I/O devices and I/O time.
        3. Allocates primary and secondary storage.
        4. Provides a file system and command language.
        (whether keyboard or mouse based).
        5. Schedules and protects processes from one
        another.

With regards to this definition, is Windows an OS?  No.  Is DOS
an OS?  Probably not, unless we take into account the fact that
none save one of these books dealt with the concept of a single
user system, or even regards the PC as a computer (if it existed
at the time of writing).  The one that does deal with the PC
sets the "disc operating system" as a classification unto itself.
If you take the simplistic view that Dos schedules processes one
at a time, and hence doesn't need to protect processes from one
another, then you satisfy criteria #6, and DOS is an OS.  Few
of these books would view DOS as an OS, however, because most
deem multitasking as a basic element of operating systems.
        "The most important characteristics include Concurrency...",
                Coffman and Denning, p. 2
        "2.2 OPERATING SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS
                (1) Concurrency"
                Lister, p. 9
        "Section 3.1 THE NEED FOR CONCURRENCY"
                Barron, p. 29

According to the "experts", Windows and
DOS are an operating system together (as would be Desqview and
DOS, or Geoworks and DOS), but neither apart is an operating
system.  Everyone happy?

True, it may do some of the things an operating system is supposed to do
in a textbook approach, but all it is is a big program that runs on the DOS
operating system.  But if you wanna stick with the textbook approach, then
half the programs out there are Operating Systems.

In addition if you bought your copy of Linux from someone - eg SLS or
yygrdrasilwhatsername you can get the source from them at media cost
and the GNU license obliges them to provide it for you.

There's a name confusion: There are two packages originally named
"mgetty", but now they are referred to as "modgetty" (by Walter
Pelissero, patched by me) and "mgetty-sendfax" (by Gert Doering).

I don't know how well or even if it is supported, but according
to the most recent PC Week it is SLOWER than the Adaptec 1742
(the controller it is replacing).  I'd try to get a 1742 if I
were you since it is already supported by many operating systems
and it is one of the fastes EISA controllers around.

But it'd be nice to have motif programs running on my PC.

Since this got ignored in c.s.msdos.hardware, I'll post here in hopes
that someone with the information may want the accellerated mode of
the HD controller working with Linux.

Does anyone have the address of Promise Technology, Inc, the people
that make VLB IDE controllers?  Or better yet, anyone have programming
information for the chips, particularly the non-caching controller
(uses DC2000.SYS driver).  I suspect that the same software will work
with both controllers, but I want to get my controller working full
speed first, before I test it.

BTW, before someone insists that a noncaching VLB controller cannot
improve IDE disk speeds over an ISA adapter on an 8Mhz bus, and
expouses theories as to why it can't, I will state a few facts.
(Theory should conform to facts, not the other way around)

Kernal compile times are for Linux v 0.99 pl12, with no SCSI  or
network code compiled in, on a 486DX40 with 4M of ram, drive is a
Maxtor 7080AT, with a max transfer rate well under 1MB/sec.

8 Mhz ISA Controller  : 52 minutes
13 Mhz ISA Controller : 39 minutes
VLB controller        : 35 minutes

BTW, this is without 32bit transfers and IDE multiple commands (which
is why I'm looking for this info).
