Ummm, pressing Ctrl-Alt-F1 when in X doesn't actually return you to "the
virtual consoles", it specifically returns you to virtual console no. 1.
Similarly, if you were to press Ctrl-Alt-F2, you'd be back to virtual
console 2. To make a long story short, pressing Ctrl-Alt-F<x> switches you
to virtual console no. <x>. This may seem confusing, because when you are
in a virtual console without X running, pressing Alt-F<x> does the same
thing. But since pressing Ctrl-Alt-F<x> in any mode does it too, you could
go ahead and just forget the Alt-F<x>.

Now, I don't know how it is on your system, but on my system the
X Server is also started in a virtual console, namely the first one without
a getty, which is no. 7. So to get back to X, I need to press Ctrl-Alt-F7.
So, find out, which virtual console your X server runs on and switch to
that virtual console.

Hope this helps

So long,
Martin

No I have nothing against guidance of end users if they really
have the occasion to come to an own conclusion what to buy and 
what not !

I think a consortium makes this process too easy ... You
give a product the label "Consortium proofed" or whatever
and everybody buy's _blindly_ "Consortium proofed" packages.
Although there might be better products in means of 
functionality.

I fear, that a consortium could possibly be not neutral enough.
Where are the criterions that everbody can accept for being
recommended by a consortium ? 
I know either this nor the persons, who will judge over
user friebdlyness.

Financial interests could perhaps manipulate decisions.
Why I say this ? Some things said by Magnus sound so strange,

Readnig one thing let's me come to the conclusion, that the 
consortium doesn't want too much intervention from outside.
The rules of electing each other in the consortium are so
restrictive orientated in a direction, that I fear it has
nothing to do with a democratic election process.

        "The secretary of the consortium chooses members. 
         The members choose the secretary."

Another thing is, that the need for a consortium like that
with certain rules weren't discussed in the public.

Instead of this you present finished and in my eyes questionable
concepts, that everybody should accept.

Where was the public discussion about that - similar to the
democratic process of creating a new newsgroup ?!!

Another example that makes me thoughtful is the reply from
adam@yggdrasil.com (Adam J. Richter) writes:

He is someone from a Linux on CD producer who is for such
a consortium ... What I don't understand is, why someone
could be interested in such a consortium, when the own
product has so many flaws. Read the thread about

        LGX List of Problems #3 and #4

When a product has many flaws (excuse me to say it so direct)
and the consortium wants to proof quality, too, then a normal
reaction should be against such a consortium (because not
knowing the criterions for a good product and not knowing
the people who are taking the decisions).

I fear, that such a consortium, that wasn't discussed 
in a normal democratic way like newsgroups could churn this or 
that distribution arbitraryly.

But where are the standards they have as reference, that the

The questions are

I can reach only people, that ask for help when deciding for 
this or that. Creating a label "LC proofed" pushes one product
and makes another product automatically being "not superior".

And that from unknown people and without the possibility
to make interventions if needed.

Ok, give democracy a chance and call for Discussion officially.
And then Call for Vote if there is a need. Don't overrun thousands
of net people. Doing it the way it runs now I come to the assumption,
that some people want to put a cron on their heads, sorry !

What is user friendlyness ?! That's my problem with your LC.
Everybody has other preferrences !

The installation process of product A could be better than in product B.
But the quality of the programs, the handling, the functionality
between the packages could possibly be better in B.

What gives the user more advantages on the long run ? That all are
questions a user should decside dor himself !

Aggravated is the wrong translation. Ok, some parts are very vehement,
but I hope this article is more informative, why I'm really against LC.

When Relational Technology (as it then was) first added SQL, I believe they
simply translated the SQL to QUEL.  The two problems that are instantly apparent
are that you would need to add the UNION operator (QUEL's only notable
deficiency in my view), and SQL views are virtual tables possibly including
duplicates, while QUEL views are re-writes of the WHERE clause.  It need not
be too hard to tackle either of these problems though.  But building a native 
SQL engine would be a huge job if you wanted to keep the optimizer.

Having said all that, you really should try to master QUEL--especially the
aggregate functions.  It could be a religious experience.  QUEL is elegant,
concise, subtle and powerful.  SQL is none of those things.  QUEL is also
FAR easier to learn, so if you have already mastered SQL you've got what it
takes.  C. J. Date's "A Guide to INGRES" has a fairly good QUEL tutorial.
See the incomparable INGRES FAQ on comp.databases.ingres for details.

$.02 worth.

Buzzt!  You lose.

Ingres is our main production base in my department, and there isn't
anyone here who would rather use QUEL than SQL.  My guess would be
that the choice of whether to use QUEL or SQL would be determined by
personal preferences, portability, and availability.  

(and, yes, we DID buy Ingres (back in the days when you purchased it
from Ingres)

I believe you are not supposed to distribute a changed .web file, or at 
least still call it TeX.  Other than that, you are pretty much free to do 
what you want, there are commercial versions of TeX with no source code.  
EmTeX, the free DOS and OS/2 implementation of TeX, does not come with 
source code either.  I believe the proper way to distribute a changed 
gftopk would be to make the change in the .ch file, so that one can get the 
desired .c files by running web2c.  I think TeX is copyrighted by the 
American Mathematical Society.  This is all the impression I get from a 
cursory look at the source code.  Please correct me if I have understood it 
wrong.

There was a thread on more or less this question recently (centered around
the question of whether Linux developers "should" include documentation
with their products), and as I didn't chime in then I shall do so now.

Kai's point that source code provides "documentation" only to programmers
is very important.  It comes down to a question of where Linux wants to
go, and prepares itself to go.  The presence of extensive manuals in a
number of formats does not guarantee that Linux will spread significantly
beyond the programmer/adventurous hacker/would-be sysadmin community, but
it is certainly a precondition of such a spread.  Necessary, that is, but
not sufficient.

It's true at the same time (and here I'm addressing in part the earlier
thread - sorry for not digging it up and spending 3 hours in vi piecing
together quotes from it) that Linux developers are not obliged to do this.
The development of documentation should not involve a process of shaming
people into doing it, or making pronouncements about their failure to
have done their job correctly.  It is only important that everyone involved be
clear about the trade-offs involved, and about what exactly the groundwork
is and is not being laid for.  (And I'm speaking abstractly, of course - 
there are also practical questions of people's time and resources.)

I would also like to make a plug for ASCII documentation.  No doubt there are
them as think I've missed the entire point of *ni|ux by not knowing much
about, or having access to facilities for, text processing.  (Nor do I have
the power to run X.)  However primitive it makes me sound, I will say
nonetheless that my favorite mode of working through a difficult compile
or application is to have the relevant ASCII document (README, FAQ,
makefile, whatever) in a text editor in another virtual terminal.  Not to
mention the infeasibility of printing ghostscript-type things on a 9-pin
dot-matrix printer....  (You can cook Thanksgiving dinner waiting for the
table of contents.)
