I am new to linux but I have been trying to think of something useful
to help linux along.

I think I would like to try.

What data would be needed ?  Perhaps not only name/address but also
machine configuration so it can become a database of how many of each
kind of card we have in our universe ?

We could standardise most of the info to the most common 255 in each category
so a category would only occupy a single BYTE.

Should we also keep track of which linux-activists channels you listen to so
NEWBIES might be able to locate someone close to help with their problems ?

First of all, if I haven't said this already, I *LOVE* this idea!  I'd
really like to find other Linux users in NW Florida, for example (FYI,
for the FL folks, I live in Ft. Walton, on Okaloosa Island).  Even before
the idea was posted, I'd been wondering if there were any other Linux
users around this area.  I must say, however, that the idea of a user map
never even crossed my mind...I must be getting old....

>I don't think a single person can achieve such a work, 
>I hope we can find enough volunteers to make it possible..

Yeah, it would be a massive amount of information to deal with, to say
the least.  But I've got an idea that I think might make it a lot easier
to manage!  I do not, however, have any thoughts on how to go about coding
this (databases and I don't get along---I can write datacomm stuff anytime,
protocols included, but databases?...forget it!).  I suspect, however, that
there are existing apps that could be modified (or perhaps just configured?)
to do this.

Anyways, here's the idea.  We setup something similar to (or perhaps as a
part of) listserv sites.  You send e-mail to the server, in a certain
format, and make additions, changes, deletions, info requests, etc., all
via e-mail.

For example, if I were adding my site to this list, it could perhaps look
like:

add site n5ial.mythical.com
contact jim@n5ial.mythical.com
machine cpu 386 speed 20 mem 4 [etc...whatever else is deemed important]
location Ft. Walton Beach, FL
kernel version 0.99 patchlevel 9
misc_info [whatever....]

Or, if I wanted to update the info for my site (e.g., when I went from
0.99 PL6 to 0.99 PL8 to 0.99 PL9 last week), it might look like this:

update site n5ial.mythical.com
kernel version 0.99 patchlevel 9

Or if I wanted to find all of the users, say, in Florida, I might do

query location FL

This could then search for anything with 'FL' in the ``location'' field.

Does anyone know what it would take to get something like this working?
This would make the list a lot more manageable, as opposed to humans
having to run it (this really would be a huge list, if everyone listed
themselves).  I'd have to guess that the response time would be a lot
shorter, too, but that's hard to say....I've seen some humans respond to
e-mail in record time before.  :-)

Any thoughts on this minor enhancement of the original (wonderful) idea?
   --jim

PS:  I would certainly hope that this would be e-mail based, or at least,
     be something that one could access via e-mail.  After all, there are
     those of us who don't have access to a direct Internet connection.  :-(

Since we're on the subject of mail channels, how can someone join a mail

No, it's not.  Not for your purposes.  If the machine were just
lying around, it might do to provide a "proof of concept" demonstration,
but for productive X development work absolutely not.  I'm working
on an X app which runs OK in 8 meg, but if I want to use gdb I end
up using all 8 meg and almost all of my 16 meg of swap space.  Not good.

It would be to the boss's advantage to spring for 16 meg of memory, a 486
of some kind, and at *least* 200 meg of disk.

Well, considering the fact that we only got started in June, I think
we are pretty far along.  We don't have any off-the-shelf binaries
running yet, but we can run binaries that contain only implemented
API functions.

We are always looking for more help.  Only four people have provided code
to the current emulator.  I would gues that 80% of that code has been
written by two people.  If you would like to join the effort, join the
linux-activists WABI channel.

The name of the project is now Wine, and we have a directory under
/pub/linux/ALPHA on tsx-11.  Currently there is only a README file
which contains information about the status of the project.

If you're working in a company that plans to make make money from this
project, I recommend a 486DX2, 16MB RAM, 500MB HD, S3-928 video adapter,
and so on. Manpower is much more expensive than hardware.

If it's more or less a hobby, then 8MB RAM (was 6 a typo ?) and 80MB
disk space are ok. I recently installed the MCC-package (w/o emacs)
together with XFree1.2 (w/o link kit), 4MB swap and 4MB free for
users on a 43MB harddisk. If you going to buy a new machine, buy at
least a 386DX40.

Crap:
I installed MCC in 40Mb of disk space and did a lot of useful work, _and_
had room for nethack and friends. If you install everything you can find then
you need a lot of disk space. Ask yourself what you need instead. You don't
install every available toy when you use DOS, you don't need to when you use
Linux. I'm currently administrating a multi-user Linux machine with 130Mb
of disk space, including all the general purpose stuff, X clients and 16Mb
of swap. Last time I looked there was 20Mb free.
Having said that given current disk prices its hardly worth buying less than
170Mb unless you _know_ you have no expansion plans

I ran X386 for 9 months in 4Mb. It was slow opening windows and horrible when
compiling but quite usable (I was used to X and sunview on 2 & 4 Mb dickless
Sun3's - so it was quite similar!) and I couldn't understand the fuss. X is
quite usable in 4Mb. Now I have 8Mb I wouldn't dream of using X in 4Mb
however 8-)

Subject: [Q] Networking Linux+DOS
Date: Wed, 18 Aug 1993 09:56:29 GMT

I'm currently trying to connect a Linux machine to two DOS/Windoze machines
for using each others hard disk, and loging in to the linux machine.

This is what i want :
I want the two DOS/Windoze machines (both 486DX), to be able to login to
the Linux machine. And i want them to be able to use each others hard disk
as a network drive, and the hard disk of the linux machine.

This is what i have :
3 E2000+ (NE2000 hardware compatible) network cards + cables + terminators.
Novell lite v1.1 (if needed that is)
The Linux machine is a 386SX with 0.99pl9 (soon to be upgraded to p11 or p12)
The Linux machine is connected to InterNet with UUCP.

I was thinking about using NFS, but i don't know if there is a way to make
the two DOS/Win machines use each other hard disk as well then.
(Shareware/PD preferred...)

Ofcourse i could use novell when i want the two DOS machines to use each
others hard disk, and NFS when i want to use the linux machine, but i'd
rather have one package so i could use both...

Thanx in advance,
