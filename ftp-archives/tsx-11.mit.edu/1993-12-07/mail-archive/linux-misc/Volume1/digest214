Short?  Doesn't exactly sound in character.  I'll assume you are trying to
prove a point; please find smiley enclosed.

I think the point is that c.o.l.help *is* the appropriate area for
short posts asking for pre-manual-diving advice.  c.o.l.dev isn't,
usually.

I think what it needs is a series of overpriced books full of pictures
with titles like 'I hate Linux, but this book makes it easy'.  Problem
is, I doubt you could find anyone who's heard of linux would agree :-)

This issue was kicked around the old c.o.l some months back and as I remember
it (though I would welcome correction if I'm wrong) there are two flavors of
the Gnu Copyleft - the GPL and the LGPL.  Code linked to GPL'ed code must be
made available in source form, but code which calls LGPL'ed code can be
distributed in a "link-kit" i.e. object files & such, so that the person
using the code can change the underlying library if they feel the need.
This distinction allows the use of commercial software on systems which have
LGPL libraries.

Linux's libraries are covered by the LGPL, so this wouldn't be an issue for
the erstwhile developer who wants to make a quick buck with proprietary code.
(Not that I'm above making a quick buck. :-)

I think that at the time of the previous GPL/LGPL discussion there were some
functions in the Linux library that were covered by the _GPL_ but there were
LGPL versions forthcoming.  I'm pretty sure that all is currently well on
that front.  (Though I could be wrong.......)

Neither.  In my experience, calling the poorer students "idiots" or

how well people respond to this!  Public insults and humiliation---

Is there a FAQ or HOW-TO for curses on Linux?  I just need to know the
gcc command line syntax and #include file syntax.  I have experience with
curses on 386bsd already, so the problem is just one of simply how to use
ncurses or curses on Linux.  I try 

gcc -lcurses -o sample sample.c

with an

#include <curses.h>

in sample.c, but i get messages like:

/usr/tmp/cca017371.o: Undefined symbol _initscr referenced from text segment
/usr/tmp/cca017371.o: Undefined symbol _mvcur referenced from text segment

What am I doing wrong?  This is some obvious thing that me as a dodo-head
am just missing.  I have tried many compile line variations, such as
'-lcurses' and '-ltermcap', (and the 2 together), and '-lncurses', etc., 
etc., etc.  Vaddayadoo???

Subject: We put on a free U**x expo
Date: 16 Oct 1993 05:17:38 GMT


We had an all-day expo in the lobby of one of the science buildings
here on campus, had 3 machines running Linux, two of them networked,
and one running NetBSD.  I'd call it a success - probably 50-60 people
came by to see and try out and talk about the systems and about 10 people
brought floppies and took copies of the software.

I had made up a combination poster and info sheet to publicize the event
and to pass out to people.  The latter was a one-page article about
what's available, which newsgroups to read, where to find it on local
file servers, what kind of hardware is needed to run it, etc.

One thing learned: 9 out of 10 people who wanted copies of the software
brought 3-1/2" floppies, and we had only one 3-1/2" drive available.

Your analogy is faulty.  This is not a test (if this had been
an actual. . .).  This is merely the study session, where you, the
instructor, are expected to give the answer, or at least the location
of the answer. You are not allowed to just tell them to "fuck off and 
find it yourself."  Well, you're allowed, but you'd get fired pretty
damn quick.

Besides, have you ever heard of common curtisy?

It takes a more capable mind to post an insightful reply than one that

Not quite.  Most peoples problem with MS-DOS is NOT the users, it's the OS
(ok, loader) itself.  Linux needs a bigger user base.  More users, no
matter how "sheeplike", equates to more applications and more enhancements.
(Consult your local economics guru.)

Yes, it is.  It's more effective to tell them where to find the information
than it is to flame them.  Are you so trigger happy that you can't see that?

Specifically, if I need SLIP (with all the goodies,  like

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

Subject: Yggdrasil CD and SLIP...
Date: 15 Oct 93 23:48:31 GMT


I have not been able to get SLIP working on the Yggdrasil distribution.  SLIP
works fine under DOS (WinQVT/Net) and I have recompiled the kernel without
compression [what my current static slip line uses] and checked and tried the
usual IP numbers in all the files.  I get that the network is unreachable.  I
even tried it manually: load kermit, get in to slip mode, crtl-Z out, do
ifconfig etc. (I have to run it twice - the first time it says there is no such
device sl0), and then route [where I get the network unreachable error].  Yes,
I also have the correct netmask and low mtu (512 works on DOS) [since I even
specify those manually when I tried things manually].  I've heard that the
route has to be recompiled with some ifdefs (or something like that) removed/
added.  Could anyone shed some light on this?  Any information would be greatly
appreciated!  (Otherwise, the Yggdrasil disk is quite nice since it has sources
to a lot of things and it's setup (if are starting clean) is quite good.  As
far as I know, it is the only Linux CD-ROM that can run right off the CD.)
Many thanks,
