        For what it is worth, the Yggdrasil distribution makes good use of
wish/Tcl/Tk in the control panel.  I am starting to adopt some of this to make
an X-based program that allows you to configure the mode pages for scsi
devices.  Getting the first one (cache control) done was the hardest, and I
hope that the others will be easier.  Having the Yggdrasil scripts around
helped a lot as I could study and hack these as examples.

        I tried looking at the Tcl/Tk book a bit, but it lacks a good index.
As time goes on, I try and dogear the pages with interesting things on them,
but some kind of quick reference guide would come in quite handy.

Subject: MS-DOS font for X?

Holger,

glad you asked. I was afraid to ask, because I was afraid it could be a too
FAQ-like question, although I've never found some hint in this direction. So
please if you get answers by email, either post it here or send me a copy. I've
got the same problem.

I'm curious about DDE's under windows (dynamic data exchanges)
and was wondering if there is any equivalent resource under Unix or more
specifically Linux.


thanks,

Ira

   Kevin,
      Check out the GCC-FAQ it has info about cross-compiling.

How did he measure it? What is the definition of fast/slow? My experience
is that Linux is one of THE fastest OS's around, certainly on a 386/486.
