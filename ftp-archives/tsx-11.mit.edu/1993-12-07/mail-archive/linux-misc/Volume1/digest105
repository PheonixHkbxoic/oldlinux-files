Subject: New gopher client
From: morley@suncad.camosun.bc.ca (Mark Morley)
Date: 7 Sep 93 09:55:17 PDT

Hi there,

A couple weeks back I wrote a new Unix gopher client.  The reason I'm
telling you all here is that I wrote it simultaneously under SunOS and
Linux.  So far it seems to work great under both environments.

Anyway, here's the readme:

BBGopher 1.3
Copyright 1993 by Mark Morley

   You may use and distribute this code in any way you like.  It is free and
   there are no strings attached.  All I ask is that my name stays in the
   program (source and binaries).

FTP Site: suncad.camosun.bc.ca:/pub/morley/bbgopher1.3.tar.Z

BBGopher started out a couple of weeks ago when I decided I needed a more
secure gopher client for the UNIX BBS software I'm writing.  I FTP'd the
RFC that describes the gopher protocol and began.  I started to look at the
sources for other gopher clients, but quickly gave up and decided to do it
from scratch.

It took about 2 days to get a working client going.  The first version didn't
have bookmarks and was missing a few minor features as well.  A couple more
days of squashing bugs, adding features, etc. and voila!  Here it is.

I wrote it on a SunOS 4.1.2 system.  I've also tested it under Linux.  No other 
system has been tested yet.

This version of BBGopher supports the following item types:
   Text files (can me mailed or saved after viewing them)
   Directories
   Binary transfers
   Telnet
   TN3270
   Index searches
Support for CSO, GIF, Image, and other types are in the works.

Features:
        - Provides a simple scrolling interface (but still looks good!) that
          should work on _any_ terminal.
        - You can lock users into using a specific directory for saving text
          files.
        - You can grant or deny access to any item type on a per user basis.
        - You can define an external pager for viewing files, although there
          is a simple one built in.
        - You can define things like which mailer to use, which telnet binary
          to run, etc.
        - Easy configuration via an ascii config file.

Installation:
        1) Uncompress and expand the tar file.
        2) Type 'makeit'
        3) Move the file bbgopher.conf into the /usr/local/etc directory.
           If you'd prefer a different file/path name then you must edit
           the file bbgopher.c and change the #define near the top of the
           program.
        4) Edit the bbgopher.conf file (or whatever you decided to call it)
           to configure it for your site.  Be sure and read the comments
           in the sample config file carefully.  Make sure this file is
           marked as readable by everyone.
        5) Move the file bbgopher.help into the appropriate directory.  You
           must be sure to define the path/filename for the help file in
           the config file.  You can place this file anywhere you like and
           give it any name you like.  A sample file is provided, but you
           may want to edit it to suit your tastes.  Make sure this file is
           marked as readable by everyone.
        6) Move the file bbgopher to a directory on the users' path.  I use
           /usr/local/bin.  Anything is fine.
        7) That's it!

Disclaimer:
        Please keep in mind that this was mostly a quick (and not _too_
        dirty) job that was meant for my own personal use.  After reading some
        of the posts concerning a need for a more flexible/secure client
        I thought others might be interested in mine.  If you find BBGopher
        useful, great!  If it's not, well...

        I'll offer limited support for the program via email.  Bug reports,
        suggestions, questions, etc. are always welcome.

I really don't know if this is true or not.  *A lot* of companies with a lot
of employees are using networked computers.  This is why Novell is doing so
well.  It's why Microsoft came out with "Windows for Workgroups".  The number
of people doing networking with their computers is very, very significant,
and they're trying to do so with DOS which, as you admit yourself, is the
wrong answer to the problem.

If that's *all* they needed, they wouldn't be running Windoze, they'd be
running only DOS.

Right.  But you don't have to have a network to benefit substantially from
multitasking.  As I said, Microsoft wouldn't have bothered with it unless
they figured that people would actually *use* it.

You want guaranteed filesystem integrity?  Then mount all your filesystems
with the sync option turned on and suffer through the loss in performance
just like you do with DOS.  Unix isn't unsuitable just because the default
mode happens to be the one that gets you higher performance...

Actually, that's not quite true.  It *is* probably one of the reasons.  If
the default mode were something the user would be most comfortable with,
then Unix would be more suitable to the average user.  That's part of the
problem, but it's something that's easily fixable.

Indeed, my opinion is that the defaults *should* be those most suited to the
neophyte.  Someone who knows what they're doing can change the defaults
because they'll know how or at least know how to find out.

Oh, yeah?  *I've* seen a complete turnkey OS fresh from the box that is more
appropriate for the neophyte: the Mac OS.  And guess what?  It has fewer
limitations than DOS...

And guess what?  It, *too*, has multitasking.

Do you detect a trend here?

*What* hardware resources?  Unix was running on hardware less capable than
what you got with a base IBM PC, which is my point in the above.  Minix
does the same, *on* a base IBM PC.  Running a more powerful OS than DOS
on extremely limited hardware isn't hard, and hasn't been for a long time.

We all did.  The Apple II was being used by a lot of businesses at that
time.  Like I said, Visicalc...

>And so they were designed with that in mind.

Yeah, but the *multiuser* capability isn't the primary thing I'm talking
about...it's the *multitasking* capability that Unix has that, more than
anything else, blows DOS into the weeds.  That and a reasonable filename
convention.

Even Microsoft, technically incompetent as it is, realized this when they
designed Windows...

The Apple II wasn't terribly expensive at the time.  Nor was the Atari 
800.  Nor were many of the 8-bit computer systems floating around at the 
time, though they *could* get expensive.  

Remember how Apple started?  A couple of guys in their garage playing 
around with hardware?  It certainly didn't require significant resources 
to design a computer system.  Production is another problem, but Wozniak 
and Jobs managed to do so without huge production budgets.  They just 
grew as the demand grew.  

Now, if you're a Big Corporation with a Big Corporation Attitude, then 
yeah, such things require big bucks, but that's only because of the 
*assumptions* that such corporations make and the infrastructure that 
such corporations often have.  The reality doesn't have to follow those 
assumptions.  There are a number of existence proofs of this.

That sounds like the definition of "user-friendly" to me...

Yeah, but at the same time we're users, albeit more sophisticated users.
We don't write everything we use from scratch.  We often use the programs
written by others, just as the neophyte user does.  Indeed, I would argue
that we more often use the programs written by others than the ones we
write ourselves.

How interesting you say this.  The rotten goods *they* have to put up 
with are the rotten goods *we* have to put up with, because *they* select 
the rotten goods, not we.  

And users *do* care about usefulness.  After all, they use things, don't 
they?  :-) The more work the user will be able to do and the greater the 
ease with which they can do that work as a result of what you hand them, 
the happier they'll be.  *This* is why users care about usefulness, even 
if they don't know it.  

However, what is not really mentioned is the amount of cognitive overhead 
involved in making something useful.  The reason I find X + Unix more 
useful than the other OS combinations I've dealt with is that I am 
comfortable with thinking about what I'm doing.  Most people aren't like 
that:  they're procedure-oriented and would rather know *what* to do 
rather than *why* to do it.  This is why procedural simplicity is so 
important in user applications, and *this* is why Unix is usually not 
palatable to the neophyte user.  

This is something that can be fixed, but because most everyone who uses Unix
falls into the first-principles-oriented category, few have bothered.  But
NextStep might be a step in the right direction (I'd have to look at it to
really know).


Unix is just an operating system.  There's nothing inherent in its design
that requires a power-user to use it, it's just that all the programs have
been written for power-users and gurus.  That's the result of history, not
design.

Sched is an application that make use of the Zip drawing editor for

not real useful and has since been moved to our contrib section along

        No, we used to have call waiting, then dropped it.
You can sometimes hear a little click or something when someone
says she was trying to call.  It's a 14400 modem running at
38400 baud, my roomates 2400 baud doesn't seem to have the same
problems.  The phone line should have absolutely no options
on it.

           Does linux implement supplementary groups? (From what I can see, it
   doesn't, but maybe I just don't get it).  Is it a planned addition, if not?

Sure it does!  From /usr/include/linux/limits.h:

#define NGROUPS_MAX       32    /* supplemental group IDs are available */
