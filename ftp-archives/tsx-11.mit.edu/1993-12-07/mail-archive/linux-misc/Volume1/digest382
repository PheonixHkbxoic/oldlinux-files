        I wonder,

                We are in the mist of setting up a Linux box and would 
like to have it compatible with caller ID...so that if the person is 
calling from another location the where she is supposed to the system 
askes for somekind of either override password of some sort...we are 
equiped with modem ZYXEL's that will display the caller ID string on the 
first ring and a half and were wondering how would somebody go about 
doing this...also we would need to alter are (crypt) software to protect 
the password file, where could we get the source code to (crypt)

Hi,
I would like to get a linux on a CD, but since I'm new on this, I would
like to ask for some hints which one`s the best.
I have a 486/50 with 16 MB Ram, Ultrastor 14F w/ 520 MB Disk and Thosiba XM3401 CD-ROM,
Colorado Jumbo Tape (not on SCSI), and ATI Graphics Ultra (1 MB).
I would like to have on the CD in addition to Linux gcc, g++ and other GNU tools and TeX.

Any suggestions ? (Please send by mail)

Erm, whilst on this subject does anyone know if its possible to get X to start 
WITHOUT a display,  I know this sounds silly but I have a friend who has an 
X-term and would like to get the X-term to use the linux box as an X server, 
but he doesn't want the server to be messing around with X actually on screen 
if you see what I mean....

So the question is it possible to start up an X server without any client 
display on the PC and then access that server from an X term.

Thanks,

Chaz.

Because people haven't a clue?

I posted notices weekly and later every 3 days for at least two months
prior to the removal of comp.os.linux.  People still didn't get a clue.

Dave Lawrence removed the group, and yet still some people don't have
a clue.

Unfortunately, this is something I've come to expect in Usenet.  Usenet
is far too big for even minor changes to occur in less than 6 months
to a year.

How many posts do you see to comp.sys.ibm.pc and comp.sys.mac?  I have
358 and 406 articles respectively in my logs since Sept 1.
They've been gone for several years now.

Subject: floppy capacity [Q]
Date: 6 Dec 1993 16:50:56 GMT

Before I take the plunge and try to install Linux, I'd like to
ask some questions:

Can Linux and/or the mtools package handle 3.5 in HD floppies that
have been formatted to 1.72 MB (81 sectors and 21 tracks, I think)?
I've been using such floppies without any problems under DOS and OS/2
(the latter doesn't even need a special tsr utility to read such floppies),
and would like to continue doing so. The mtools package on or SPARCstations
cannot handle such floppies, though. 

By the way, the formatting program I use is called fdform18 and can be found
on most archive sites.

cheers, J"urgen

I think that the situation with Linux is slightly different to
commercial products. In commercial developement you have
developers, people who test the product, if you sell hard and
software you often have a support division ...

I suppose, that the people that make Linux packages are one or
more people, that have to do all of the tasks mentioned above.
They often compile and install the packages themselves, test
the interoperability with other packages, read the news, ftp
new versions of packages, do support in the news, have a 
full mailfolder. Some of them spend a lot of time for no money.

Often they have to deal with unprecise error reports, so
a collection of errors and solutions wouldn't be bad. Or what
about writing some documents how to install this or that ?

Don't blame the package maker being "user friendly" or
"not user friendly", help, that each product gets a chance
to be brought up by novice users.

Be fair to everybody who spends his time (often free time)
packaging free software for _everybody_.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
That's the point. It isn't flat anymore when there are
a few people - who are formed in an organisation like the LC -
who speak out recommendations.

I think this is a drawback for packagemakers. Perhaps there
are some people out there who create wonderful distribution with
a good functionality, the only thing is, that they perhaps have no
time to make lot's of documentations ...

It would be a drawback when there are people - who semi-officially say -
"but it's not user friendly".

From what should people take the motivation to create packages
for free, if there are people who recommend only such packages,
that are nearly perfect in installation, documentation and everything, 
that they offer their free time for many people any further.

>publicly. What's wrong with that? You didn't happen to grow up in
>*East* Germany, did you? That might explain why you continue to

No I'm from West Germany. But you utterance is a impudence for 
people from the former East Germany who might be listening to
this Subject. Please, this stuff belongs to another group ...

>mistrust a group that wants to state an opinion publicly.
                                      ^^^^^^^^^^
It's not only 'an opineon'. This opineon influences people to buy or not
to buy or copy certain distributions. The name Linux Consortium could
mislead people in thinking, there is an official group of people
that have the _authority_ to judge about the quality of free software's
distribution.

That documentation is in English. The howto's, FAQ's and the current available

There is no connection between my comments and my company. There
is no product I have to protect against Linux. W&P sells it's 
software products on Sun workstation with Solaris 1 and 2.

The only connection between Linux and W&P is, that I use 
Linux on my portable as an X-Terminal in the company and
I'm happy with it ...

But we are speaking not about me, we are talking about the goals
and the need of the LC. Sometimes you seem to forget that.

I read through the various FAQs to get an answer and finally decided to
post. The X server on my linux box says 'unsupported chipset'.  Here is
my box config:

        graphics card : Trident MVGA-T9200CX/MVGA-T9400CX with 1MB memory
                        1024x768 at 70 Hz refresh. Vesa Local bus card.

        monitor : CMS 1561/LR multiscan monitor. 1024x768 at 70 Hz refresh.
                Synchronization: 30-60Khz (horizontal-automatic)
                                 50-90Khz (vertical-automatic)

Has any one been able to get X running with this config? 
Thanks in advance for your help and pointers.  Please reply in email.

I have the same version of Linux.  You need to add control-M to the 
end of each line to print out ascii text.  Simplest way is to 
convert the file in 'vi' with the command :1,$s/$/\^M/
where you type ctl-v then ctl-m after the backslash. A filter
for printcap is left as an exercise for the reader.

See ghostscript (gs) to get other interesting data to the printer.
'man gs' will point you in the right direction.

O.K., I've read all the documents, compiled it on both ends, and I'm still
not able to get it to work correctly, more-than-likely because the naming
convention between Local, Remote, and Term ends is a little vague (at least
to me, anyways!).  I was wondering if anyone who has been successful with
sxpc would be kind enough to give just one example for the average user,
connecting from Linux to a workstation, running Linux and Xwindows at home,
using such conventions as "Linux end" and "Work end".

I appologize for my apparent stupidity, but I would definately appreciate
a hand-holding session with this one.
