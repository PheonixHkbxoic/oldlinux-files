   I have been having a problem with random program crashes as well.  However
   the problem occures when I access my modem at 38400BPS at the same time
   as intensive hard-drive activity, or the CDROM and the harddrive at the
   same time.  (I haven't tried the modem and the CDROM intensively at the
   same time.)  One time the random process was the kernel, so the machine
   rebooted.  Normally it is an xterm, seyon, term, or the window manager.

          Linux 0.99 pl 13 , libc 4.4.2, xfree 1.3
   (also with) Linux 0.99 pl 12 , libc 4.4.2, xfree 1.3
          Gateway 2000, 486-66 VLB, 8MB RAM, 16MB swap
          IDE harddrive, Mitsumi CDROM, ATI Ultra Pro VLB

I've also experienced it under Linux 0.99 pl 11 and 12 and with Xfree
1.2.  I have not tried it with libc 4.4.2.  

   Linux worked normally under 0.99pl8a, xfree 1.2 and before.  So this
   is a new problem either in the kernel, xfree, or libc.  My guess is
   that this is an xfree 1.3 problem, since I've never noticed any 
   processes dying befor starting my x-window manager.  (Other than the
   famous mitsumi driver bug, I haven't bothered to patch yet.)

I didn't have this problem with 0.99pl8, but, then, I didn't have two
drive at the time either.  My guess is a problem in the kernel or
libc.  I still get random crashes without X running.  I just have to
work a little harder :-).

Is this problem specific to the FD SCSI driver?  Do people with other
controllers (SCSI or otherwise) have this problem?

Carefully using two disks,

This "BogoMip" line of postings is getting silly.  Tossing numbers
around is exactly the kind of things that manufacturers do to get you
to upgrade or buy a new computer.

Nevertheless, I (being bored and curious) collected all of the
postings for non-odd processors and BogoMip(tm) scores and calculated
a rough linear standard deviation.

for a 486dx (not chip doubled):
        BogoMips(tm) = (clock rate) * 0.5

for a 386dx (no coprocessor):
        BogoMips(tm) = (clock rate) * 0.24 - 1.9

However, I want to make 3 points before you all post that your machine
is slow or faster.

  o  MIPS is an inaccurate statement of processor speed.

  o  BogoMips(tm) is an inaccurate representation of MIPS.

  o  Your processor's speed is an inaccurate representation
     of your value as a human being.

Date: 1 Oct 1993 18:49:49 -0400
Reply-To: wb8foz@skybridge.scl.cwru.edu (David Lesher)

There appears to be some kind of bug with the remappable keyboard
system. It causes the system to stick in a non-obvious mode.

I built my own custom keytable. I copied the us.map, with one change:
keycode  58 = Control          Control          Caps_Lock
         control keycode  58 = Control
         alt     keycode  58 = Caps_Lock

This was my attempt to make the Caps_Lock key on a 101 keyboard into
another control, and ALT-Caps_lock into the usual caps_lock. {I don't
understand why you give what appears to be the same data twice, but I
just copied what was there.}

But several times now, under different applications, I've tripped this
bug. If you hit multiple keys at the same time, especially if you hit
CAPS_LOCK and CNTL, the keyboard sticks in CNTL mode -- any key you hit
will be a ^key. (I finally caught on when I noticed that "s" lit the
SCROLL-LOCK LED, and "q" turned it off.)

In such a mode, little works as expected :-}. For some reason,
rht-ALT-prtscrn still switches to the previous console, and up-cursor
brings back old commands. But lft-ALT-F{n} does not switch VC's.

But there is an escape. If you go back and hit multiple keys, in 
my case both the usual & remapped control keys, eventually things get
unstuck. At that point, I edited rc.local to take out my loadkeys. ;-}

Note this does not appear to be the only way of triggering this bug.
Yesterday, a bug within "minicom" tripped it while exiting. (That is to
say, without a loaded keymap, minicom still croaks, but not the same
way.) 

In any case, if you have loadkeys and get in such a mode, you might
also succeed in unsticking things as I did.

The server source is distributed with the base and upgrade packs, at least they
were in the base and upgrade packs I have seen. I _believe_ (but you should
definitely check!) that the server side is freely distributable.

I got it to compile, but in the process realised that the reason I wanted it
was flawed, so lost interest at that point. The only difficulty I had was with
the section that writes to utmp. I can't remember what the actual problem was
but I do recall it took about one minute to fix. Another ten minutes to
generate a suitable section in the makefile and all was finished.

However, I did NOT actually try to run the compiled software :-)

One little point that has bitten us (nothing to do with Linux BTW) is that
pcnfsd looks at the output from lpstat to locate valid printers. It does NOT
look directly at the /etc/printcap file. This means that only the second 
alias from the first line of each printcap entry is actually useable by 
clients, because it's the only one lpstat outputs.

Subject: BASH bug report
Date: 1 Oct 1993 17:27:09 -0700

    A number of people reported memory leaks with bash.

    Well, it happens to me too!

    Every time bash executes an external command (i.e. one it has
    to fork/exec on), it looses memory.

    Worse, bash traverses the lost memory, so if you build up a couple
    of megabyte, you start to thrash horribbly.

    This occured to me with a bash script that was permanently monitoring
    some slip lines.  The bash process kept getting larger and larger
    and kept trying to access ALL of that data.  Fortunately I had a 
    data set limit of 16MB in my resources!

cshrc, .login are files read by csh, tcsh. .profile is read by bash
when it's started up as a login shell. SLS uses bash by default, so
profile should be used. See the man pages for the shells may help.

I know someone at BYTE.  I'm forwarding these comments on to that person .
I doubt that BYTE would want to be involved in running a false ad like this. 

I called Peter MacDonald about the ad when I first saw it in August.  I'll
go publically on record here as saying that Peter wants to take credit for
all the hard work other people have done. He seemed like a nice guy, but I
don't think he understands the concept of sharing credit.  Sure, he did osme
things in Linux - maybe.  I see his name attached to the Wine effort, but
very little else. I did a quick run through the Linux sources and Peter's
name shows up maybe three times. There is work attributed to him in
console.c- vt100 enhancements.  But nothing that says that he was any more
involved than the rest of you. 

I'll let ya know what Ifind out from BYTE.

In many ways I may be the most inappropriate person to respond to this and in
many ways I may be the most appropriate to respond.  You see, I've not yet
installed Linux but a friend is collecting the diskettes for me to do so.  My
lack of patience may get me to fork over a CD instead though.  Especially since
I think what he's gotten is Slackware pl12 and pl13 is now available :-)

That is neither here nor there though.  Linux has enormous appeal.  It is 32
bit, apparently gives good performance without rediculous equipment costs, has
lots of support, is FREE, etc.  I myself look forward to it eagerly.  I also
do not believe that it is dying or perhaps even slowing down.  My friend has
been pestering me to try it for quite a while and I'm just now giving in.
PC Week recently gave it a good review in the Lab Notes section.  Adds for CD
Roms with Linux seem to be appearing left and right (although an important 
issue will be whether users will rally around one major free Unix or spread 
their support amongst several (Linux, BSD386, Minix, Xinu, etc.).

Even though the original posting has so far elicited few responses and nicely
restrained ones, I'll will myself risk stirring up a little controversy.

I don't think it really matters.  Linux is not significantly different from
any other Unix I've seen so far (with the possible exception of NeXTStep).  It
is nowhere near anything that an end user would ever consider installing.  Let
me describe a system that would "play in Peoria" to you.

        It:
        1) Boots from a floppy and presents a character mode interface (in
        color if available) for the beginning of the installation process.
        2) X is provided as a normal part of the installation process.
        3) A graphical file management/browsing utility is provided that is on
        par with that in Windows, the Mac, or NeXTStep.
        4) An installation of Unix, X, and a basic set of tools is on the order
        of 60MB or less, not the 90 that is apparently the current norm for
        Linux + X.  This may be due to software development tools being
        installed as a matter of course, which "of course" doesn't make sense
        in an end user OS.  They would be in a separate package.
        5) Some basic utilities are provided (again X based) to do: a personal
        schedule, rolodex, simple WYSIWYG word processing (on the level of the
        original MacWrite or Windows Write), painting and/or drawing, a
        calculator, clock, etc.  All should look like they belong together on
        the same screen.  The effect should not be an attempt to see how many
        completely different widget sets we can use.  The whole collection
        should also be passably attractive with a 3D look or other adornment.
        6) There should not be 17 different installations from as many
        different vendors.  The user doesn't want to have to conduct a poll to
        find out which Linux to get.
        7) Reasonable attempts to set things up in such a way that the user
        does not have to be a Unix expert or even be really familiar with it
        at all in order to run his/her own machine in a single user type
        environment.
        8) Etc.  Obviously, all of these things imply that someone is going to
        magically unfragment all of the different releases, make choices of 
        apps that already exist or have to be written without pissing off more
        than 50% of the target audience...

Anyone reading the above may well say, "Geez, that's not Unix.  If you don't
like the way Linux is today then go run Windows 3.1 or wait for Windows 4.0
if you have to have multitasking and 32 in a reasonable memory area."

"Unix is about choice and if you want a choice of 13 different window managers
for your GUI then you aren't going to get that from "any color so long as it's
black" Windows.  If you want to be totally restricted in the way that
everything works, looks, etc. go pick a commercial operating system."

I think that would miss the point terribly.  Unix is powerful and neat.
Unfortunately very few will ever get to use this neat FREE system outside of
the few who are up to setting up and administrating a current Unix system.  A
number that pales when compared to the 25 million Windows licenses that will
soon be out there.
