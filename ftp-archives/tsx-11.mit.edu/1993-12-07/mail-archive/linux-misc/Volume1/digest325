They didn't work for me, but I haven't had time to do more than
install them and rebuild.  I'll probably get around to looking at them

Hello there!

Are you using a ATI Graphics Ultra Pro VLB video card under Linux ?

If so ... 

Could you please tell me what version of Xwindows you are running ?
What version of Linux are you running ?

Could you e-mail me a copy of your 'Xconfig' file ?

Is it true that Xfree86 1.3 does not support the GUP's chipset ?

I am considering a move to Linux.  I have a 486-33, ATI wonder/XL, 215MB hard
drive (400 with stacker), 8MB RAM, USR 14.4 Fax/Modem.

My questions:  

1.  Can the above system use Linux?

2.  Can I still use my DOS and Windows applications?

3.  What about xWindows?

4.  Are there any fax software for Linux?

5.  How big a hard drive do I need to have both Windows and Linux?

6.  How much RAM do I need?

Thanks in advance

As I've looked through various inet files, I've noticed some daemons which
I don't have which I would like to have if they exist.  I would like any
misc. daemon, but I would especially like to know if any of the following
exist:
        timed   (is this ntpd/xntpd?)
        rpc.*   (I already posted to c.o.l.help on this)
        r-daemons like rlogind, rshd, rexecd, rstatd, rusersd, rcpd, rwhod
        routed  (for routing/gatewaying/bridging?)

Other daemon-related stuff:
        pop-2 or pop-3 client
        rlogin, rsh, rexec, rstat, rusers, rcp, rwho, ruptime

Other unrelated stuff:
        ping that output's "hostname is alive" rather than the detailed
                output

Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me with the location of source for
any of these daemons and other things.

  First, I don't think we should be comparing hardware speeds -- after
all, a CM5/1024 running FEM code will be awfully darn fast, but what does
that have to do with Linux?  Having said that...

  I, in my suite of miscellaneous benchmark codes, have a Spigot algorithm
PI generator.  It pops out 10000 digits of PI.  Why anyone would ever want
to really do this other than as a programming exercise is somewhat beyond
me, but anyway:

  Sun Sparc 10/51           77.5 seconds
  Sun Sparc 10/41           96.1
  Sun Sparc 10/30          109.9
  HP 9000/730              148.4
  IBM RS/6000 320          179.1
  486/66V (Linux)          185.5
  HP 9000/710              203.4
  Sun Sparc LX             206.0
  HP 9000/705              295.8
  Sun Sparc 2              551.3
  Sun Sparc 1+             962.8

  Did you compile your code on the Sun with "cc -O", or did you use the
far superior "gcc -O2 -mv8"?  Sun hasn't changed it's bundled compiler
in many years, but gcc compiles and installs with about 5 commands and
a couple hours (and about 60 Meg of disk).  You could also purchase
their unbundled C compiler which also makes fast code.  On this example,
something is really wrong with their bundled compiler, because it's
about 4-5 times slower than gcc.  Normally the gap isn't anywhere near
so wide -- probably because the code does a lot of integer divides,
which SPARC V7 doesn't have.  Adding -mv8 to gcc makes it include this
instruction.

  Knowing the proper compile options can make a big difference.

>Your mileage may vary, but I say I DEFINITELY have much more bang/$

  Well, no argument there.  But the Suns aren't exactly the fastest
number crunching workstations out there.  They do have other advantages
that make them quite nice.  If you just want raw CPU/dollar, then most
workstations are at a huge disadvantage dince they include so much
extrenous hardware.  A used Honda Civic gets a lot better acceleration
per dollar than a new Porsche 911, but you can line up 50 of them
and the Porsche will still get there faster.  Performance to price
curves tend to be exponential.

  It is surprising how well the 486/66 does.  On the other hand, this
is integer code, calculating pi notwithstanding.  It uses longs only.
On something like gaussian elimination (generic code), it manages about
2.6 MFLOPS, where a Sparc 2 (a 1990 machine) gets 3.1, and a Sparc 10/30
gets 7.3.  Some people will pay 5 times as much to get 3 times the speed.
Our lab does.  We also like the MP ability and the >128MB of RAM.  To
get the same capabilities in a x86 box would raise the price a lot.

  Anyway, back to Linux!  It's fast.  Most of that feeling comes from
the disk access -- I untar a file under Linux and it's near instant.
That same process on a Sun makes a noticible pause.  Compiling is
almost twice as fast as a Sparc 2.  This is much more than the hardware
should account for.  I would guess that if synchronous writes were
turned on, my Linux machine would feel a lot slower.

  I can't provide any comparisons to *BSD, Mach, Amoeba, or Solaris x86
running on the same hardware, which is probably more to the point of
the original poster's question.  Overall, Linux seems to get most of
what the hardware is capable of though.  I've heard that some parts
of the networking aren't quite debugged, such as NFS being much slower
than it should.  Soon though.  Maybe someone will get real ambitious
and update it to NFS 3 while they're at it...

Date: 21 Nov 1993 12:04:48 GMT

hello, I was trying to compile Aspirine on my linux and I accidently used
the program "MakeDistribution" and it did something horrible to my system.
I am not sure exactly what it did, but now I have no room for any writes to
the harddrive, cannot even use vi.   

When I ran the file, it seems to go into everyfile in my directories to do 
something to every file.  I thought it was normal and sat back and watch.
Soon, there was an error saying disk write error, full or something like 
that.  I went to the root directory and found a compressed files that just
got created and deleted it.  I went to several other directories to delete
some unwated files and nothing happened.  I still could not write to the 
disk.

What happend, what can I do, Thanks for any advise...Mike

  IBM received so many complaints about this that it made the default
malloc be the POSIX compilant version, which acts as all the mallocs
we know and love do.  The old one (lazy allocation, shotgun conflict
resolution) is available by linking to a special library.  At least
that's what a recent press release said.

  I'm having some problems with my Linux machine doing the same thing
though.  I have a program that statically allocates a large array, 9
meg to be exact.  When I run multiple copies of this, ps shows that
the memory is not actually allocated until it is used.  When I run
enough copies so that it uses more swap space than exists, they
slowly allocate the last few pages, then the machine locks up for
5 minutes to 2+ hours (5 minutes with 16 MB RAM, no swap, no X,
2 copies running; with 40MB swap, X running, 6 copies, I pressed
the restart button after waiting two hours).  It then kills off
any process that asks for more memory until it's happy.  This,
in the small case, meant that a root shell got killed when I, as
a normal user, ran my program.  This is with Slackware 1.0.2, Linux
0.99.13p.  Anyone else see this?

  I don't really mind it's behavior so much as I don't like the large
timeout.  I read through the kernel memory routines, and I see where
it runs out of memory and kills off the process, but I don't see why
it would wait so long.  Any clues for turning on kernel debugging?

The problem is definitely in ext2fs. I have tried to repeat the problem with
xiafs and msdos file systems, and cannot. I only have the problem with ext2fs.
Anybody have any ideas what the problem might be?

What model of sun workstation is it?  Sun 2? Sun 3? 386i?
What version of SunOS?  3.5? 4.0.x? 4.1.x? 5.x?
Which compiler?  bundled?  unbundled? gcc? (which version of gcc?)

ALWAYS tell people who are being asked for help enough so they can be
reasonably confident of their diagnoses.  Also give complete error messages.

There are way too many variables that you do not specify to be sure, but my
guess is that you were using the bundled C compiler on SunOS 4.1.x, which
will not work because term requires an ANSI compliant compiler.  See if gcc
is installed on your sun computer, or use the unbundled C compiler if gcc is
not.  If there is not an ANSI compiler on your system there are other ways
of approaching it, but they are way too difficult for you if you are having
trouble with this.  IF you have an ANSI compiler, specify it in the Makefile
where it says:

CC=cc

Comment that out and put:

CC=gcc     #or whatever

Hope this helps.
