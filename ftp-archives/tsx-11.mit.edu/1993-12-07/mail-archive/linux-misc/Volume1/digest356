   Oh, but there really exists a package to typeset chemical DIAGRAMS, not
formulas, specially designed for organic chemists. I think it's name was
ChemTeX, and was very simple to use. In fact, TeX has many such packages,
as one to write music over a pentagram 8-).

Subject: How is Linux/X performance in 8MB?
Date: 30 Nov 1993 13:08:33 GMT


I'm in the process of upgrading my computer system for use with Linux.
I'm buying a 486SX-33 motherboard, but right now it looks like I won't
be able to afford more than 8MB.  Also, using 1x9 SIMMs, the board
won't be able to hold more than 8MB unless I use the expensive 4x9
SIMMs.  So 8MB would be a pretty hard limit for me for a while.

So my question is: What is Linux/X performance like in 8MB?  I mainly
plan on using this box as an X server, but with a few local apps like
XV, PBMPLUS, and other image manipulation software, light compiling
with GCC, and a few other things (probably not all at the same time,
though).  So can anyone give me a feel for what the performance would
be like?  If you could phrase it in terms of MS-Windows, that would be
helpful (i.e. "Linux/X in 8MB feels like Windows for Workgroups in xxx
MB").  (Note: I will probably be using a Western Digital 420MB 12ms
IDE drive, in case that matters for swap speed)

Thanks,

Paul

P.S. Speaking of X, if anyone has recommendations for a good
inexpensive (under $150 street price) VL-bus graphics card, I'd love
to hear about it.  Right now I'm looking at the STB Powergraph (S3-805
based).

Hi Linuxers!

Well, I think I'm in trouble with my 0.99p12 NFS-daemon. I would really like to 
export some (more than one) filesystems to other PCs running linux. But actually
I wasn't able to export more than one. I only got the following error-message:
                           
                               RPC: timed out 

(i.e. the NFS-server doesn't like to export more than one filesystem, or what?)
BTW, I have applied the "dirty trick", i.e. root in less than 8 groupsi, the portmapper
and one nfsd are running and the /etc/exports-file is o.k.! This problem occurs 
regardless from which machine I try to mount the filesystems!
My configuration:

  486/33 20 MB RAM clone
  SMC Elite 16
  0.99p12; 
  ext2fs

Please reply by E-mail.
Thanx in advance

Subject: Lots of problems with Slackware 1.1.0 
Date: Tue, 30 Nov 1993 14:14:19 GMT

Hi all.

I've just spent a couple of very frustrating nights trying to install
Slackware 1.1.0.  Each time I try it differnet things keep going wrong.  

The first time the install went ok.  Then I wanted to use Lilo to make 
Linux bootable from my harddisk (or from a floppy).  This was problem 
number 1.  Lilo kept giving me an error message something like:  
        can't access device 0x101 
no matter what I put in the config file.  I even tried using different
lilo's - one off of the installation/boot disk, I reinstalled lilo.tgz, 
I installed an SLS lilo, nothing seemed to help.  I decided to just stick 
with a boot disk which worked pretty well.

Next I added tcx (a sort of transparent compressing of binaries) which 
somehow decided to rename some of the programs I ran (eg. all of a sudden 
running man gave me awk, awk gave me talk, etc.).  I don't know if this 
was because I broke something while playing around with tcx, or wether tcx 
did it itself (I've run tcx before and had no problems with it), or if 
it has to do with the filesystem (ext2fs - I've had problems with this 
one before).  I assumed it was the first one (ie. my fault), and seeings 
how I didn't know how many programs in /usr/bin (and maybe elsewhere) got 
mixed up Idecided to just reinstall again.  (a side note- cp is also not very
good.  If anything goes wrong (no space left, file not found, etc) then 
instead of giving an error message it gives a segmentation fault.  A cp 
I took off of the rescue disk does however work properly).

Okay so I ran setup, formatted my partitions, and installed everything.  
All went well (including Lilo - it was the same Lilo that didn't want to 
work before) until I tried to reboot.  The filesystems got mounted readonly, 
(as it should) but fsck didn't work.  I Boot up the rescue disk, look
around, and find that /bin/e2fsck is a link (symbolic) to /etc/fsck and
/etc/fs/fsck.ext2 is a link to /bin/e2fsck.  So while trying to check the
file system fsck runs fsck.ext2 (which is actually fsck) which tries to
run fsck.ext2.ext2 which doesn't exist (at least there's no endless loop
right?).  I don't know if this is how Slackware installed everything or
if I had accidently made some bad links.  Anyways after I fixed the fsck
problem the filesystems got checked (or not if they were clean) and it was
time to remount them.  After a couple of problems (all my fault) i finally 
got to the login prompt.  

Hoping that there will be no more problems I try to log in.  I suppose 
logging in with no problems is too much to ask.  I try to log in as root
(root doesn't have a password yet) and instead of a shell I get a login
prompt again (preceeded by /etc/issue), actually no matter who I try to 
log in as I don't even get a password promt just the login prompt again.
It ends up that getty prints /etc/issue and a login promt, gets the user name
and passes this on to /bin/login (or something like this), well /bin/login
does exactly the same thing! (it's not the same program as getty - at least
they're not the same size!).  After stealing the /bin/login from the rescue
disk I finally log in (by now it's about 2:00am of the third evening trying 
to install this Slackware Linux and I'm getting pretty frustrated).

Ok once I'm lgogged in I start trying to customize linux a little bit. First
I want to go through all the /etc files that I changed in trying to get this 
thing to boot and replace them with the originals (ie. from the Slackware 
distribution).  Well some of these files are pretty long so I use less to
look at them.  What do I get?  an s.  this is what it looks like:
 #less rc
 s
 #
After trying the same less on a rescue disk session (booting from the rescue 
disk and mounting my linux partitions) I find out that s means Segmentation 
Fault.  I copy the rescue disk's less (it works) to my /usr/bin and boot up
again.  Now I replace the files in /etc with the originals and can still boot 
up alright.  (less works now).  Then I wan't to edit /etc/issue and /etc/motd 
to personalise my linux a bit.  I start up vi and what do I get? s.
ok let's try emacs (from the e disks).  emacs -nw gives:
Fatal Error(11).  Segmentation Fault.
Now this is getting really frustrating!  I boot up the rescue disk and try 
these same programs.  vi definately works, but I can't remember if emacs does 
or not (I don't think it does though it DID work the first time I installed
this version of Slackware).  Ok boot up again and try joe.  Yay, an editor 
that works!!  I edit a little then notice the time.  It's already past 4:00am
and it's about time to go to sleep (not to mention that I'm falling asleep
behind the keyboard!).

One last experiment before going to sleep.  Run all of the programs in /bin
(/usr/bin is too big) to see which ones give the dreaded s.  Out of all the
(standard) programs in /bin about 7 of them gave an s.

Everyone (or at least a lot of people) seems to be saying how Slackware
is much better than SLS (The installation IS much prettier and easier -
I've installed SLS a couple of times (BTW Linux ran no problem on my 
computer before so I don't think there's any hardware problems)), but 
why doesn't anybody get these kind of problems?  And if they do how could
Slackware be so popular?.

The problem that bugs me the most is the amount of segmentation faults.
Has anyone experienced anything similar to this?  Also why does it just 
print an s instead of Segmentation Fault?  And why do programs that worked
all of a sudden stop working and give Segmentation Faults?

Well this is the end of the longest post I've ever written.  I know that
this has been kind of a vague report of all of my problems, but basically
I just want to know if anyone else has had these kind of experiences?

See ya.

Ihor                            (ikuz@cs.vu.nl)

PS.  If anyone wants to know I have a 386DX40 with 8mb RAM a 40 Mb partition
     on an ide drive (/dev/hda2) which is my root and an 80Mb partition
     on an scsi drive (/dev/sda1) which is /usr,  also I have an 8mb swap
     partition on the ide drive (/dev/hda5).  I installed the a e f tcl x
     xap xd y SLACKWARE disks and the d t SLS disks.

When is the Linux kernel going to support modules as an option that
can be set while doing a make config?  It gets so annoying to have
to apply patches to each new kernel release, just to have most of it
fail because the kernel has changed so much.

Consider this my plea for module support build in to pl15, so getting
ftape to run with it will be much easier that it has been with pl13,
ALPHA pl13, and pl14.

Anyone else have feeling on this?  (Linus??)

An excellent S3-928 card that is supported right now by XFree2.0 is
the Actix GE Ultra+ w/2mb VRAM.  It can run a clock to 110Mhz, which
gives you 1280x1024 @ 60Hz, and my favorite 1230x920 @ 65Hz, or high refresh at
1152x900 @ 72Hz.  The ISA board which my company resells for $299 (see my .sig)
gets 110K Xstones on my 486sx-33 machine running Linux, so even the ISA
board is very fast.

I agree!  Or, how about the ftape stuff built in rather than as a loadable 
module?  If is it the only driver ever to use modules, there's not much 
point in having them in the kernel, is there?

Hi, 

Please try and forgice if this was in a FAQ (I couldn't find it though!). I lost 
a posting that recently advertized PC workstation specially done for Linux. If 
someone has info on that I would greatly appreciate it.

I am basically looking for a PC version 16Meg, CD Rom (toshiba by preference), 
15 or 17" monitor, 1.2 Gb of SCSI disk, backup tape and sounf card configuration.
I will also need too partition it to run other OSs like Windows and/or OS/2.

Thank you for any information and commentary if someone has purchasesd a system 
with those people. 

Thanx.

One rather obvious problem is that modules.tar represents a
security hole the size of Hudson bay. This is OK for tinkering
(especially when you're not on the net...), but for production
use it just won't do. Anyone have any idea how difficult it
would be to make a secure modules package?

Pardon me, but wouldn't it be simpler and more reliable to take one of two 
measures:

    1) Lock the door of the room your PC sits in.
    2) Buy a $5 (or something like it) lock that prevents someone from
       placing a floppy in the machine (they exist - our library has them
       on their PC's - sort of like the things they use on guns or display
       cases).

Simplicity is a virtue in this sort of thing.
