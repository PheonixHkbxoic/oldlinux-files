Yes, I did. And I still do. None of the available X documentation is
completely thorough; in fact, nothing is said of performance.
Sometimes it's necessary to dig into the source. My primary reference
at home is the Linux kernel source.

"All" available documentation? Everything (of major importance) can be
found on the FTP archives, including sunsite in pub/Linux/docs. This
includes all online docs, FAQs, HOWTOs, LDP manuals, and man pages.

What more do you want? The Linux Doc Project (which I still
coordinate, I think... :)) is prepared to take care of any
administrative issues dealing with documentation, such as this. If you
can send me any suggestions or ideas I can make the move to implement
them.

But we're getting there. Let's not forget those few of us who DO spend
a good deal of time on documentation, and care about it. What the LDP
wants to do is have a complete set of readable, user-friendly manuals
covering all major aspects of the Linux system, from installing to
using to programming to kernel hacking to systems administration and
so forth. Hopefully, once these are all ready, mail-order
distributions of Linux will include printed copies of these manuals.
By then, we expect, other publishing companies will be able to
distribute the manuals independently.

The point is, the effort IS there. Things tend to move slowly as far
as documentation is concerned, because you have to be somewhat
cautious. I don't document ALPHA NET-2 code in the HOWTO's, because
it's volatile and tends to change by the time I get the HOWTO
released. 

>together quotes from it) that Linux developers are not obliged to do this.

"Linux Developers" meaning whom? I consider those of us who write
documentation to be "Linux Developers" in at least a restricted sense.
We're all a development community here; with Linux, the lines between
users and programmers and documentors have all been torn down.

Everybody is different. I'd like to say, however, that I (at least,
for one) consider ASCII documentation to be important, and we'd like
to end up having all of the LDP manuals in ASCII format at some point.
Emacs Info would be nice for those who like hypertext.

The solution there is Info. (Do I hear a flame war on the horizon?
No?) Info isn't the ONLY way of doing this, but it's a sufficient way.
On the local systems here, nearly EVERYTHING is documented with info. 
In fact, it's possible to convert man pages to info format. 

On a standard Linux system, we could use Info pages (in addition to or
instead of man pages) for basic ccommands, applications, function
calls, etc. The LDP manuals at one point will be available in Info
format. 

I don't think that there's any reason to reinvent the wheel here. All
of the tools are in place, we just have to utilize them.

Info is a bit difficult because it requires the writer to do a lot of
work. Not long ago, I made a real push for a ``One True Format''---a
documentation source format that could easily be converted to LaTeX
(printed docs), nroff/groff (printed docs and ASCII) and texinfo (for
info), or directly to Info. Someday, I plan to follow up on this.

One way to go might be SGML, however, few freely-available tools
currently exist for this (apart from parsers). Looking at SGML, it
looks like a great option, but might be overkill. My idea for the OTF
would be to have a "small", simple format (looking something like
LaTeX, for example) providing basic functionality for documenting
software: i.e. the ability to change fonts, sectioning and
cross-reference commands, lists, "verbatim" screen environment, and
not much else. Because direct analogues to these logical elements
exist in all of the target formats listed above, it would be a simple
matter to convert OTF to whatever "target" format for processing.
(In fact, much of the work could be done through a Perl script, in
many cases.)

I agree. My revised vision of the Linux Review Group is this:

It approves / disapproves distributions as in the first LC proposal.
However, it also maintains a small paper called 'Linux Review'. This
paper is a short explanation of what Linux is, and a short explanation
of where you can get it, including approved distributions and
how-to-order info. It may even include disapproved distributions if
they offer something others don't.

This paper will also detail what each distribution contains - so the
users can choose based on their needs.

   Financial interests could perhaps manipulate decisions.
   Why I say this ? Some things said by Magnus sound so strange,

The LRG is not intended to be a democratic body. It will (I hope)
attain trust through it's work. It doesn't represent anyone, it's not
responsible to anyone. That just wouldn't work.

   Another thing is, that the need for a consortium like that
   with certain rules weren't discussed in the public.

Isn't that what we are doing now?

   I started with SLS and switched over to slackware because SLS
   wasn't reliable enough. My own decision for $0.0.

If you weren't connected, you would have had to pay for SLS. I don't
know if Slackware is even available off-net.

   The installation process of product A could be better than in product B.
   But the quality of the programs, the handling, the functionality
   between the packages could possibly be better in B.

There is also product C, with a bad installation process and bad
functionality. Today, the user has no way of knowing which to buy.
Tomorrow, he will know that A and B are approved, while C is not. If
he gets his hands on 'Linux Review', he will even know what's good and
what's bad about product A and B.

Hmmm...  that certainly isn't true on my system!

Subject: BETA Slackware Linux 1.1.1
From: volkerdi@mhd1.moorhead.msus.edu (Patrick J. Volkerding)
Date: 5 Dec 93 21:32:03 -0600

If you'd like to help test the new release of Slackware Linux, it can be
found in /pub/linux/BETA on ftp.cdrom.com. The complete sources are also
now available under /pub/linux/slackware_source.

It'll be moved into /pub/linux/slackware and officially announced after
the testing period ends. Lots of stuff has changed, so help me test it
thoroughly!

This new release has your choice of 0.99pl13, 0.99pl13r, 0.99pl14, and
0.99pl14a, and attempts to follow the new file system standard (FSSTND).
Special thanks goes out to Daniel Quinlan and all the people who have
worked on the new standard.

Also - the base system is now 1.2MB or 1.44MB floppies. The base system can
be installed on machines that have only a 5.25" floppy drive. It includes
comm programs that allow people with only a 5.25" to download and install
other disk sets from their hard drive once the base system is up
and running.

Have fun!

As an alternative, maybe someone can come up with a compiled,

 i've been playing with the andrew toolkit (which includes a word
processor (ez) into which one can insert running clocks, calendars,
spreadsheets, graphics (paint & draw) editors). it includes a tool
(roff2ez) to convert nroff|troff into the andrew format.
 so, convert the man page to ez format, paste in a few rasters of

From what I have understood of Magnus' proposal, various things would
be tested. Eventually, a final judgement would be 'pass' or 'fail' of
any given Linux distribution. However -- and this is the important bit
-- there would also be information available concerning *why* the
distribution passed or failed. So the novice would be able to find out
that distribution A had much better docs than B, but had packaged the
software itself so incorrectly that only an expert could ever
straighten things out after the raw install. And so on. This
*increases* the bandwidth to the novice. The novice will still have to
make his or her own decision. The LC can even make it clear that Linux
has no official hierarchy or organization and that the opinions of the
LC are the opinions of its testers. Would that suit you?

Indeed. But distributors are selling Linux for real money, aren't they.

I thought that's what we're right in the middle of right now!!! Any
more public than UseNet is probably not financially feasible, is it?
And what happens in this public forum that Magnus approached? Are his
proposed rules discussed? Hardly. Either people are for it and say,
sounds good enough for me, or people like Andreas suggest that Magnus
give up and forget THE WHOLE THING because it's useless UNDER ANY SET
OF RULES.

Given this, I can only advise Magnus to take his best shot.

>Instead of this you present finished and in my eyes questionable
>concepts, that everybody should accept.

Who has to accept anything? If I were to publish a book concerning,
say, the inherent genetic inferiority of Germans, that would probably
greatly anger you plus many other people -- not just Germans. However,
in the kind of society prevalent in the so-called free world, there
would be little you could do in most places save publishing your own
book in which you attempt to dismantle the argumentation in the first
book. That's the way things work. Especially in democracies. Everybody
gets to state his or her opinion. Everybody gets to team up in groups
and state their collectively-arrived-at opinion. In fact, everybody
gets to even say "God's own revelation concerning the only possible
truth, as revealed in dreams to the current author". It comes with the
territory. The alternative is censorship.

Now, if anybody has really substantive suggestions (I've made a few)
about the internal goings-on of the LC, then let's have them. But no
attempts at censorship. I would have absolutely *NO* qualms or other
negative feelings about the LC as proposed by Magnus having dozens of
comptetitors in the way of consumer protection organizations
concerning Linux. Why not? It would keep the LC honest in their
evaluations, and also keep the LC's competitors honest in *their*
evaluations. Novices are novices, not morons. They can and do collect
information from as many sources as is feasible and then try to come
to an informed decision. If you find it dangerous for the LC to be the
*only* linux consumer protection organization, then *do* something
about it -- start up your own! Do even better testing, write even more
succinct explanations for the novice about why certain things in
certain distributions are bad or good.

Not necessarily. It could be that many distributors are operating on
the absolute minimum of resources. They will process as much input
from UseNet as they can in the way of problem reports; unfortunately,
the bandwidth is *very* large, and the quality of information is
EXTREMELY disparate, as we all know. That takes a lot of sorting. In
your example with LGX, couldn't it be that the distributor simply
recognizes that the LC might be a source of presumably expert comment
on the distribution, as opposed to a lot of "Can't find XYZ in SLS" or
something.

As long as distributors are charging REAL MONEY for ALPHA software, it
is perfectly legitimate to call consumer protectionists into play,
don't you agree? This is true regardless of the life-cycle status of
the software -- the point is that people are supposed to commit funds.

>Are they able to keep track with all the new distributions

Any distributor who wants to get tested by the LC will no doubt see to
it that the LC's information is current. Any distributor who *doesn't*
want to be tested needn't; the LC can report that that distribution
was not tested. Period. What's the problem?

So who are your neighbors? What are *their* qualifications for judging
the quality of Linux distributions? Which ones have they judged?
Probably only the one they bought, sight unseen I might add. Who are
the authors/reporters in magazines? Just names. Could be the same
names as the testers in the LC. Probably are in some cases. More names
of people you don't know. So why is UnixWorld's plug for Yggdrasil any
different from LC's published evaluation of a Linux distribution, in
your opinion, other than the fact that you might not have been invited
to become a tester yet?

Fine. I can safely document the need. I can't provide you with our
five-year business plan, but I think I can safely say that I'm married
to supporting Linux novices who are otherwise highly-paid
professionals and sometimes leaders in their fields.

As to the dangers, that's what comes of a free society. No censorship.

As to the means of bootstrapping, I haven't seen any alternative
suggestions, from you or from anybody else, except that voting should
somehow be linked to UseNet participation. If that is a serious
suggestion, then I'm completely opposed: Linux is bigger than the
c.o.l.* readership, whether that was intended or not. And most of my
novices will have no Internet access at all. As a matter of fact,
we're starting to look at target groups in countries that have no
Internet backbone in the first place. Some LDCs and such. Why does
being a c.o.l.m. reader promote somebody into an enfranchised elite?
And to what end?

Precisely. If that is the opinion of the LC testers, then that is what
you've got. Any misrepresentations of *fact* are libelous, so I

How could a distributor intervene? How is a consumer protection
operation supposed to function if the testees can intervene on their
own whim? You have to make them provide you with a release and say,
"This is what we're selling for $99.95". Then you form an opinion on
how good it is, and publicize that opinion. Anybody else can do the same.

Maybe I'm just dense, but I still don't understand. What do you mean
"officially"? What is this ostensible "official" structure or
organization that you want to sanction any kind of public opinion?
Sounds like censorship pure and simple. If a certain little group,
such as c.o.l.m. readers, want to publish an opinion such as "The LC
is full of crap", then let them. Most people would prefer an objective
line of reasoning concering why certain LC opinions may be incorrect
or misleading. And you can do that, too, any time you feel like it.

Would you feel any better if the LC were to call itself the Free
Operating System Consumer Protection Society? Since it is Magnus' wish
to limit evaluations to distributions based on some version of the
Linux kernel, that wouldn't really fill the bill.

I wouldn't propose that the LC say that one product is more
user-friendly than another and leave it at that. It's *facts* about
the results of testing procedures that people need to know in order to
make a decision of what to buy. If you like to write everything using
'cat', then it doesn't matter if a distribution doesn't have a clean
vi or emacs installation. If you want plug-and-play X Windows, then
that's a different story. If you want plug-and-play networking, you're
up a creek anyway.

Exactly. So what's your beef?
