Many of us (most of the Linux community?) don't have the luxury of being 
able to easily get hold of any separate packages. We don't have ftp, I don't
even have a modem on my Linux machine. From work I can e-mail, read news etc,
but not ftp, and I cannot write a floppy disk (because the management here
forbids floppies because of virus paranoia).
Some Linux users I know of to not have any (electronic) access to the 
outside world.

For people in my situtation, and I am not alone, the SLS distribution
is much better than MCC precisely because more or less everything is there.
I have the SLS 1.01 release on CD and I am VERY PLEASED with it.

What is good for you is not necessarily the best for everyone else.

There is a lot of stuff in SLS, packages change and updates come in the
Linux world at break neck speed and it is a mamouth task to keep SLS
anything like upto date and working. I think Peter does a GREAT but
(and I think he will be the first to admit) not quite perfect job.

SLS has done a great service to the Linux community. Because of it there
are many 1000's more Linux users now than there would have been otherwise.

Please do not forget those of us (the majority??) who do not have the luxury
of being able to ftp anything from anywhere.
We like to be able to get everything at one go for as few $$ as possible.
SLS has made the Linux community much bigger than it otherwise would have
been.

Do not bash it until you can do better.
Do not bash something which is free.

A Linux user (and x friends of mine) thanks to SLS,
Mike

Hear, hear!

Even with all the real and perceived problems that SLS has, whining
and flaming doesn't do anyone any good.  Personal attacks are also not
productive.  All in all, Peter's done a _lot_ for Linux, even if we
don't mention SLS (which _is_ a good thing to have around, even if not
perfect and even if there are other distributions that are better in
at least some ways).  IMHO, the only people with the right to whine
and flame, are the people who paid Peter for support.

I say the above even if I don't like SLS myself.  When I installed my
system from scratch recently, I decided to avoid SLS this time (I used
MCC), because I had had so many problems with the version of SLS I
used to use (a very old version, and the problems may or may not exist
today; I don't know, nor do I care).  (To avoid giving the wrong
impression, I didn't reinstall because SLS was bad, but because my
system was getting unusable due to my hacking and mucking around with
it.  But that's OK, that's part of the reason why I have my own
computer anyway, to be able to screw up when I want to. :-)

After we agree that attacking SLS or Peter is not a good idea, we
don't have to avoid saying negative things about it.  That's not the
point.  There is no problem saying, e.g., "MCC is much better than
SLS", or "SLS has a lot of problems and things don't seem to be fixed
very quickly", as long as it is said without with the usual amount of
viciousness.

If you are writing about ISO 9000 here, I'm inclined to agree. It's
remarkable how this standard seems to have much higher visibility than
any related to computing: obviously there's money to be made.

Even for the computer related standards, the process is currently
flawed, and must surely be improved through better use of the
Internet. In the meantime however, the status of the ISO is the best
chance we have of keeping computer companies in line. Computing tends
naturally towards standards: common network protocols and file formats
and standard versions of programming languages and operating systems
make it possible for people to cooperate. Once a technology has
reached a given stage of maturity, more is gained by standardization
than by innovation. What benefit is gained by having numerous ways in
C to put a string into the environment?  It is perfectly natural to
choose one and make it a "standard". New languages can continue to
evolve of course, so the standard will eventually become obsolete.

But I don't see how it can be accepted for a company to produce a new
operating system, without at least taking all possible measures to
remain compatible with standards which exist.  I don't think Microsoft
would be facing the same hostility to their new OS if they built it on
top of POSIX (all of it!) and X Windows. Are these standards really so
broken that they need to be redesigned from the ground up, or is this 
just an attempt to split the computer industry for their own profit?
And if the standards *are* broken they need to be fixed or replaced,
not abandoned.

What will happen in the long term if people continue confusing standards and 
products? What if they permit companies to flout the standards which exist,
in the hope of gaining sufficient market share that their product becomes a 
standard? Obviously it's a good idea to have shares in such companies: 
control of a standard is a license to print money. Given a license to 
print money, it becomes possible to hire an arbitrary number of programmers,
thus maintaining the status-quo. Look at how long it took to escape from 
IBM the last time, and computers are much more important now.

It seems highly unlikely that Microsoft will gain the OS monopoly they
are after. However even an excessive market share for products like 
Word and Excell is undesirable, if you need to buy the things before
you can access the electronic libraries of the future.

    Well, I was going to send my stats file, but it was rather large. As

   If they damage themselves, that's *their* problem.  New companies
will spring up to fill the void - just as it has always happened.  And
*those* companies will probably be lean and mean at first, until *they*
kill themselves with bloat.  That's the way that capitalism works.

   But you just said that they are going to kill themselves as well, so
what's the problem if they will eliminate themselves as players in the
game?

   I have no sympathy for stupid/ignorant people.  If they make decisions
about software and hardware without doing the proper research, they
deserve what they get.  It is their responsibility.  If a person is so
clueless that they think a salesman's sole interest isn't in padding his and
his company's pockets, and actually *believe* what the salesman tells them,
they shouldn't be making purchasing decisions.  And if, as often happens,
the company fails because of poor decision-making, then we're only seeing
natural selection in action.  Which, in the end, is a *good* thing.

You're awake so don't worry. gs will translate PS, which includes text and
graphics, into something your printer understands. There is a bj10e driver
in the stock gs release on the distributions so try it first.

One caveat: Your printer must have enough memory to print a page at the
            resolution reqired. 1 megabyte at the very least at 300 DPI.

Hope this helps,

Hello Linuxers,

    After seeing all the offers of people putting Linux onto disk were ALL
US based, I figured that someone in the UK should also do this,
especially for those with slow modems and the large connection fees
within the UK.

   I will consider putting to 3 1/2" disk anything which can be found on
the internet, (for a price :-) ).

   Seriously folks, the price charged will be 0.1UKP/minute taken for the
download and 2 UKP for the handling.

   If I already have it downloaded (eg SLS) then the cost is 3 UKP/disk.

   All disks will be checked on my machine, if they prove faulty, then send
it back for a replacement.

   Mail me for special offers eg. SLS 1.03 30 disk set for 60 UKP

Info:

   I am running pl12 and average 1k/s on downloads.
   I do not expect to make much of a profit - connection costs, admin
and postage will probably be all thats covered.
   I _WILL_ supply Linux support if asked.
   I would prefer to deal entirely within the UK since this was my reason
for starting the service.
   Since this is a first announcement, my figures are liable to change
once I find out how expensive this project is to run.
   A UKP is a UK pound, which I did not type in as a "" not knowing
how it would come out on your terminal.

   Constructive criticism welcomed.

Okay folks,

   This happens TOO often, using shared libaries for all utilities is a
disaster waiting to happen.

   I know that binaries which use shared libraries are smaller, but it
is a very weak link, as we have seen so often (no, I haven't been
bitten - yet). For the extra few k which statically linked binaries take
up I think it is reasonable for some commands (ls, ln, rm, mv, cp, mount,
tar, zcat) to be statically linked. Since space on bootdisks is so short,
a saving may even be made by trading off larger binaries with being able
to have NO libraries on the rootdisks.

  I feel that the SLS and other distributions are the route to fix this,
maybe next time :-)

  In the interim, if anyone is interested I could locate sources for a
reasonable subset of commands and post the statically linked binaries
(though I pay for bandwidth to access the internet).

   Suggestions for the minimal commands needed to recover from a trashed
library would be welcome, since I would use floppy only - your mileage
would differ.

     Not wingeing - doing something to fix it!

Hmm, couldn't let this pass...

I know that Microsoft Word and Excel aren't the best, most bug-free pieces
of software available anywhere, but they work well together, enabling the
sum usefulness of the packages to exceed the usefulness of each individual
program.

IMHO Microsoft have used dubious tactics to slow other manufacturers down in
the windows arena and shouldn't be supported for this, however, when I need a
graph in my text document I have no choice, since Quattro pro for Windows seems
to make a hash of putting graphs into Wordperfect 5.2 (which is even more
of a piece of buggy junk than word :-( ).

Nothing gets to be the number one application by accident - there has to be
some reason.

Does anyone know anything about these people?  I saw their add
with the Linux logo (looks nice) in the back of UnixReview.  I filled
out the little Reader Service card and sent it in.

Just curious if anyone else knew anything about them.

Dang, I was just about to say that!!!!  The key commands in my book are "mv",
"ln", "sync", "halt", "mount" and suchlike.  I can theoretically do without
the rest, but they are nice too.

If we at least had "mv" statically linked, it would be far easier to upgrade
libc.so (hint,hint).
