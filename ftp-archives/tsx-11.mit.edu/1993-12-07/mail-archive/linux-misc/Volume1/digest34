I'm rather tired of seeing the microkernel listed as a feature.  I'm
glad Linux isn't a microkernel or a message-passing OS.  There is
no *inherent* value of having a smaller "kernel" and having the
rest in "processes."  Look at Mach: they're technically amazing, but
on single-CPU machines, they're always playing performance catchup
to the monolithic systems.

It's interesting that the 50k figure is harped upon.  Linux runs in
4 MB like a dream (I know, most of my time using Linux has been on
a 4 MB machine).  From what I hear, the NT betas thrashed the disk
all to hell with even 12 MB.

Well, they probably use floating point offsets :-)  integer bignums
would be interesting, though.

You *always* use segmentation on the 386.  You can't avoid it.  The
TSS is a segment.  The IDT is a segment.  You must have valid segments
for cs,ds,es,fs,gs,and ss.  You simply cannot run without segments.
The process memory model is not segmented: it sees a flat 3 GB address
space.  The kernel sees a flat 1 GB address space, but it can use
segment overrides to access the process's address space.

Technically, no.  Every executable you use has to be paged in.  I think
the incorrect term "swapping" is actually more correct here.  Linux
can simply "release" executable pages without having to copy them to
swap; there is still some memory reclamation at work.

I won't touch the majority of the errors in this ``feature'' list, which was
obviously written by someone who has never used Linux---most of them have
been thrashed about to the point where I'm sure people know about the
errors....  But there are a couple of things that really shocked me....

I run X (XFree86 1.2) in my little 4 Meg sometimes, myself...and I do *NOT*
use fvwm---I use twm.  I do use rxvt for a couple of xterms that I don't
use much (e.g., I keep a window open that I just use to monitor UUCP stuff),
but I use the real xterm for anything where I plan to actually do much.

It's a bit slow sometimes (not always, though), but it does work.  Of
course, I've gotten so used to just using the virtual consoles and
selection (for snarf-n-barf) that I don't really use X unless I need the
graphics aspects of X.

>>>min required disk space     60 meg                      120 meg (all series)

Wait a minute....hold on here!  Are you saying that without 120 Meg, I can't
run Linux?  My entire hard disk isn't even that big, and I still have a
small dog partition (I have a shareware program that I still need to compile
every now and then, and I'm still using emTeX for its 24-pin DVI driver,
plus, well, games <grin>).

Oh, and of course, you can have a limited system on just one 1.44 Meg
floppy (basically just good for demos, admin., maint., etc.)....

You'll notice that I haven't said anything about NT---there is a reason for
that....I don't want to be guilty of the same thing that [whoever made up
the list that started all of this] is apparently guilty of.  In other words,
I don't want to start making claims about an OS that I've never even seen,
and have virtually no facts on.

16 Meg of RAM....  120 Meg of disk....  Geez....  Next thing you know,
someone will be saying that msdog no longer has any of these prehistoric
``features'' like 640k limits, 64k barriers to some data structures,
different memory models, etc.---yeah, right.  Umm, while we're at it, I
have some great land for sale.  Really nice location---it's about 25 miles
south of Ft. Walton.  {\tinyprint Submarine and/or scuba costs extra.}  :-)

No, the new QIC-80 driver actually runs under Linux; people are actually
using it to backup their systems.  And, amazingly enough, the QIC-80
driver loads via the Linux loadable device driver mechanism (which is,
admittedly, not included in the Linus-distributed kernel).

I do real work under Linux.  I simply do not understand how that can 
be considered a "toy" OS.  Could you define this term?  If it means
"not in shrink-wrap," which is mainly how I see it used, then I
agree.  But if it means not really useful, I disagree.

"The new unix" sounds more fanatical than anything I've heard from a
Linux user.  Sounds like a mantra to me.

Hmm.  I suppose your followup to this will claim how advanced NT is
because it started at version 3.1?  Methinks you are too susceptible
to numbers.  Try this trick: remove the leading "0." from the Linux
version numbers.  Relax.  You are getting sleepy.  Now repeat after 
me: Linux is at version 99.  It is the singlemost stable and mature
OS in existence.

Now, let's be intelligent about this.  Linux is not late.  "Late"
is not being released on time; Linux is in a perpetual state of
re-release.  Linux has more features now that were promised for
1.0.  

>Somebody said that and all the sheep kept echoing it! Tell me, can you

Er, no.  Why would you want to?  I rather like booting from my
hard drive.   And if you're going to be using the drivers, why
don't you just compile them in?

>some sheep would say you can enable that by recompiling the kernel.
>That's loadable alright! Heh.

Well, you do understand that you must compile the kernel at some point.
While NT seems to spring whole from the Microsoft factories, it
indeed has been compiled by little gnomes deep beneath the forest.  
Trust me.  

>The current loadable modules project doesn't have the blessings of the

Uh, it was created -- by definition -- by a Linux developer.  It's
being used by the QIC-80 developers.  And when there is a great enough
need for it, and only then, it will be integrated into the standard
kernel.  That need has not been demonstrated yet.  If you're always
going to be loading the same set of drivers upon bootup, loadable
device drivers doesn't help the user at all.

>Not a single applicaion running under linux uses drag and drop, unless
>of course you count the demo included with Motif!

To be honest, I'm not very fond of "drag and drop."  This is another
magic word like "microkernel."  I'm sure you can quote me some
numbers showing how "drag and drop" has increased productivity?

Incorrect.  There are in fact 2 projects underway.  The one included with
SLS is as you describe, minus the incoherent ranting.  The other
is called Wine, and it is a Windows binary loader and emulation
package.  It runs a couple of simple Windows programs.  They're 
hard at work now writing it so I won't offer it as an example of
working code.  But it has promise.

>Well, it's getting too long. More later if find the time.

Oh, please.  Just how many times can you leave yourself logged in

        Why would anyone want NT?  Someone that loves multiple processors for
parallel computing -- probably.  I use OS/2 2.1 (in it right now :) ), Linux,
AmigaDOS 3.0, and NeXT Step.

        1. Yes, there is a FileManager for Linux and X-Windows in general.
           I am also creating a FileManager (similar to DiskMaster on Amiga).
        2. Drag and drop is cool!  I use it a lot on the Amiga and OS/2.
        3. NT has a place in computing -- but it's not meant for the home user!
           Unless Microsoft makes an NT-Lite?
        4. For mission critical Applications I rely on OS/2 2.1...nuff said.
        5. Clients needing a cost-effective unix environment I suggest Linux or 
           other 'free' unixes.
        6. For Graphics,Sound,Animation (...multimedia) I use Amiga 4000/040.
        7. NT received a lot of hype, but needs to prove itself.
        8. I'd like to see NeXT Step come down in price -- it's a good OS --
well for Application development!

   Isn't it just simpler to run term/txconn and have a genuine xterm from
   the other side on your screen?

No, because even with a 14.4 modem, the thoughput that term gives you is
fine, but the interativity really lacks.  (Yes, I tried lowering the
packet size, etc., but I wasn't able to get an acceptable setting.)

 I seriously doubt that this will be the case.  Windows NT doesn't presently
stand much of a chance in this market.  But go on...

 I don't think that's a fair comparison.  Linux is waiting for 1.0 to work
out all the bugs.  Microsoft is just releasing it hoping the users will
report some bugs.

 I'm not currently aware of where loadable drivers are being used.  It's a
new development, but it does appear to exist.

 I don't quite think you grasp the situation yet.  I personally don't think
that loadable drivers is that great of a thing.  None of the other Unices I
work with use them.  We just relink the kernel, which isn't that hard of a
task.

 I don't think this really matters, and I don't understand why this was

>Not a single applicaion running under linux uses drag and drop, unless

 Now this is patently false.  I have an application called Ftptool which was
written using the Xview libraries by Mike Sullivan at Sun, and it uses drag
and drop.

 Again I don't see this as being terribly useful, and don't understand why
it's being used in comparison.

 What does WABI have to do with SLS?   I'm kind of curious about that.
And I don't quite understand what declining SLS sales has to do with
anything.  I don't believe that anybody is developing anything specifically
for SLS.  SLS is just on distribution.

 Why if Sun can do it on a Sparcstation, cannot Linux do this on a 386?

 Just curious, you seem to be blowing some steam out of your ears.
