Part of this is very possible, unfortunatly it is very difficult for any

This will probably never happen. XFree needs to know exactly what hardware
you have, and what scan rates to use. The could be cured with a BIOS call,
but unfortunately for this, the BIOS is completely shut off and ignored. 
This could be solved with a new kernel system call for setting the video
mode, but that would be completely unportable. XFree is not made _for_
Linux, it's made to be ported to (theoritically) any Unix-like 32 bit OS.
Every one of these OS's would need to have this unprotable video kernel

This sounds great. All we need is for someone to donate time to make it
(not an easy task). We may even be able to convince a 3rd party vendor to
produce one, but then we would have to pay for it.

This sounds very reasonable. The basic kernel + minimal user utils can fit
in under 8meg. There are also 'lite' versions of X. 60M or less is
definately possible (but including user apps would definately make it bigger)

:       completely different widget sets we can use.  The whole collection
:       should also be passably attractive with a 3D look or other adornment.
Sounds good in throey, but this requires much programming effort.
painting, calculator, and clock are available, but a 'nice' user interface
with the other apps you mention aren't there yet. Programmers and
organization are what's needed...

:       6) There should not be 17 different installations from as many

Impossible. Almost everything here is free. Everyone has the right to do
what they want with Linux so long as they don't go against Linus, GNU, and
all the other hard Linux workers wishes. If someone makes an excellent
easy to use super-duper system, people will find it. 

:       7) Reasonable attempts to set things up in such a way that the user
:       does not have to be a Unix expert or even be really familiar with it
:       at all in order to run his/her own machine in a single user type

:       8) Etc.  Obviously, all of these things imply that someone is going to

:       apps that already exist or have to be written without pissing off more
:       than 50% of the target audience...
Almost all OS's require that a person have some clue as to what's going
on.  

I'm not trying to flame anyone here at all. All of these are great ideas
except for one thing - Unix is not DOS. DOS cripples the abilities of your
machine. Even DOS is a nightmare to configure properly to get the most use
out of your system. The other big factor is that all this Linux stuff is
free.  That means that the only real reward people get for their
programming effort are their names highlighted on ReadMe pages, and flames
from people when it doesn't work. Free doesn't pay the rent, so
development is often slow, tedious, fustrating, and undirected. The only
way that a 'nice' solution for UNIX/Linux/BSD will happen is if some PC
distributor pre-packages the OS and apps for you and supports what they sell.

I don't think Linux is dying off....the rate of increasing new
installations may be leveling off though...

OS's like Univel, Linux, 386BSD, Mach will never be simple for end users
to install and operate. Free OS's will lag behind commercial ones due to
the lack of money. It is unfortunate, but true. Programmers for free OS's
strive for solid _basic_ functionality - the more you glom onto crap, the
less usable a system is. Unfortunately, this means that ease of use, easy
installations, and cute interfaces are not high on the priority list. The
only thing we can all hope to for short-term is for other groups to
develop good free applications (or at least reasonably affordable ones)
and for us to improve documentation.  Linux and other OS's will come around
eventually, but I'm still in favor of getting end-users to learn something
for a change.  If people are interested in getting away from MeSsy-DOS and
Windoze then they should expect the have to learn new concepts, and be
curious enough to dig around and find what they need.

Well, poor 5,10,20-bogomipsing linuxees.....;-)

As worldwide discussion about bogomips started, groups of scientists all over the world began to fight the humanbeingterrifying bogomip-crisis in a heroic and holy war.

Now, weeks of fear & hope later, the bogomip-question (THE question) has found to be solvable - and more... is already solved by numerical approximation and methods using fractal-evolution (dd41-Mutation, 20ssi).

The result:     41

Some of you probably wonder about 41, since many scientists expected at least 43 before, I think, naked fear made the bogomip bigger it actually is.

OK, net.gurus, tell me if this is possible:

We have an internal tcp/ip ethernet that hooks a lot of PCs to some Sun file
servers using PC/NFS. These PCs have Telnet and FTP software running on
them.

We'd like to provide our PC users access to at least some Internet services
-- especially Gopher. 

A full-bore T1 link bridging our internal net to the Internet would cost
about three times as much as a SLIP link and would require routers and some
sort of firewall machine to protect our mission-critical stuff from
net-wandering idiots.

So it occurs to me that we could just put a cheap PC running Linux on our
net, and hook it to an Internet service provider with a v.32bis modem and a
SLIP link (on a fulltime phone line).

PC users could then telnet to the Linux box, log in, run
Gopher/WAIS/whatever, and log out. The Linux box would talk SLIP to the
outside Internet world.

The Linux box probably would handle email, Usenet and some UUCP connections
as well. It would have at least one modem free for our users who aren't on
the ethernet. It would probably be an IBM PS/Valuepoint 486DX33, 8MB. (I
know I might have to recompile Linux to get it to deal with the IBM disk
controller -- I saved that message!)

1. Will this work at all? Can the Linux box deal with two networks at once?

2. Is the Linux networking code stable enough, or should we be looking at
386BSD or a commercial Unix? (I have Linux at home, but no experience with
tcp/ip.)

3. How many users could it accommodate at once? I know when I boot Linux, it
prints out something about SLIP being configured for four channels.

4. What have I forgotten?

Thanks in advance for any tips/pointers/warnings.

/* The first time didn't work out. Here it goes again... */

   I want to give a humble (and maybe a little naive) comment on that. 
If, as you say, all the needed video info can be gotten by BIOS calls, a few
lines of code could be added to the kernel before it goes into protected mode
to find out this info. Then, a little program can be written to install
XFree, which asks the kernel "What did you find out?", and then fill in the
information in that file that XFree uses when it starts (xcongif or something 
like that, I think). Now, this may have already been done; so, I may be talking
too much...
And don't ask ME to do it because 1) I don't have Linux yet, 2) It would take
me a few months to learn Linux before I could do it.

Perhaps you miss the point.  Although it might be easy enough for us
to interrogate the BIOS in Linux, it will not be so easy to do that
for the dozen or so other OS's that Xfree runs on.  The Xfree folks
are not interested in solutions that only work on one out of many of
the operating systems that they support.

        Who uses lines that aren't complete 8-bit clean anymore? The days of 
parity, etc are long gone (thankfully!), and almost every line is end-user 
reconfigurable for full 8-bit clean operation (I know from experience how to

Well, *I* need PPP.  I am about to connect a line to a PPP server full-time
in order to connect a BBS to the Internet full-time.  I need to have a sync
line to my host, and I as know (heard) only PPP will support that kind
of link.

Anyways, I figured that if I want it, I just can't rant and rave for some-
one to do it.  So I put myself to it.  Here's what I did so far :

1- Got the address of the current 386BSD PPP source code.
2- I downloaded it.
3- I printed the kernel diffs out and took a look.  I guess Linux and 386BSD
   kernels aren't the same, duh! :)  This might be harder than I thought
   (and I thought it was going to be impossible...).
4- I prayed to all the gods I know to spontaneously change the source
   code to be a clean compile on the linux kernel.
5- I woke up the next day and the source hadn't changed.  Bummer...
   (I was very depressed, as this is the technique I used in University,
    and I was sometimes sucessfull :) )
6- I am writing this to ask for an amazing amount of help from the Linux
   community.  I will coordinate the effort, but I don't think I can re-
   write a PPP driver inside a year...

 I will coordinate in the following matter:

- I will list the functions necessary to run the PPP core, and these functions
  will need to be reverse-engineered into the linux kernel. I need a Linux
  kernel hacker.  PLease line up, one at a time :)

- I will start a few runs to compile the PPP core and ask for help on the
  compiler errors that will appear.  I need a dedicated person to answer
  my pleas.  Someone who knows C (obviously) and who knows the quirks of
  the current GCC implementation.  I don't want to have to post in 
  linux.help everytime I get a compile error that I cannot handle.

So, until someone tells me I am full of sh*t and that there already is a
team working on this, please consider *me* as being the PPP effort
coordinator.

My name is Patrick Naubert and I live in Ottawa, Canada.
