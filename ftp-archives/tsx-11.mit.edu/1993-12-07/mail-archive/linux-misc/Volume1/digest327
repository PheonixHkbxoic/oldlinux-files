The Linux Distribution HOWTO              -*-Outline-*-
by Matt Welsh <mdw@sunsite.unc.edu> 
v1.0, Last Modified 20 November 1993
============================================================================

* 0. Introduction

There is no single distribution of the Linux software. Instead, there
are many such distributions, available both via anonymous FTP and mail
order on floppy, tape, or CD-ROM. This document is an attempt to present
information on many of the available distributions of Linux. This document
also contains information on many miscellaneous services and goods available
for Linux, ranging from consulting and support to T-shirts and virtual beer.

The purpose of this document is to provide short summaries of the many 
Linux distributions and mail-order services, and to provide pointers for
the reader to find more information. You shouldn't base your decision of
which Linux distribution to use based soley on this document. 

This is a PRELIMINARY version of the Distribution HOWTO. It is far from
complete; there are many more Linux distributions and services than are 
listed here. Unfortunately, I have not received submissions from many of
the organizations providing these services. Please see Section 5 at the
end of this document for information on making a submission. It's easy
and fun and won't take you five minutes.

** Organization
        The following is an index of each section in this document:

        * 0. Introduction

                *** How to submit
             ** Acknowledgements

        This document should be compatible with Emacs outline mode, but I
        won't promise anything. :) Each section heading begins with the 
        '*' character in the first column. 

** New versions of this document
        New versions of this document will be posted periodically (about
        every month) to the newsgroups comp.os.linux.announce and 
        comp.os.linux.misc. (Soon it should be posted to comp.answers
        and news.answers as well.) The document is archived on a number
        of Linux FTP sites, including sunsite.unc.edu in pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.

** And so on...
        Please see Section 5 at the end of this document for information on
        comp.os.linux.announce policy and how to make submissions to this
        document. 

        Feel free to mail any questions or comments about this HOWTO to 
        Matt Welsh, <mdw@sunsite.unc.edu>.

        And now for the good stuff.

* 1. Linux Software Distributions
        This section describes complete distributions of Linux software,
        available either via anonymous FTP or from mail order. 

        Note that SLS is missing from this list. Peter hasn't sent me
        a submission for it. A few others haven't mailed in submissions
        (such as Yggdrasil) and I would really like to include them in this
        HOWTO (in fact, we probably won't accept submissions to c.o.l.a 
        unless you are listed in this HOWTO). Please send in those entries!

        In each of the following entries, my own comments are followed by
        the information from the distributors themselves. You may safely
        disregard anything I say. :)

** MCC Interim Linux
   Last modified 31 Oct 93

        The MCC-Interim Linux distribution is one of the "oldies but goodies".
        it has been around for some time, and my own Linux system was 
        originally installed with MCC-Interim back in the 0.95/0.96 days. 
        It is a very complete Linux system, and users rave about it. It has
        an easy installation mechanism and is very solid. New users will
        have very little trouble using MCC-Interim. The one thing that it
        doesn't include is X Windows, however, X is very easy to install
        on top of it. It also doesn't include a lot of other large packages
        like TeX; but again, those things are simple to install. MCC's real
        benefit is that it is a very solid base to start with; you are free
        to install other software on your own as needed.

        The current MCC-Interim release is based on 0.99.pl10, which is quite
        robust. If you are one of those people who demands to be on top of
        the current release, you'll need to upgrade your kernel (easy to do)
        and possibly your version of GCC and libraries. However, I see no 
        reason why 0.99.pl10 shouldn't be good enough, at least to get you
        started.

        Distributor: LeBlanc@mcc.ac.uk (Dr. A. V. Le Blanc, Manchester 
        Computing Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, 
        England, +44 61 275 6035)

        Description: Base Linux installation. Complete sources and patches 
        for all included software are available. Full details vary from 
        release to release; see /pub/linux/mcc-interim/*/Acknowledgements at
        ftp.mcc.ac.uk. Roughly: this includes the kernel (with source),
        C, C++, groff, man pages, basic utilities, networking. The binaries
        fit on 6 or 7 floppies. It is also possible to have them on a DOS
        or Linux partition on a hard drive (plus one floppy) or on an NFS-
        mountable partition (plus two floppies).  New versions appear at
        2-3 month intervals, depending on various factors. 

        Availability: By anonymous ftp from ftp.mcc.ac.uk; mirrored at 
        tsx-11.mit.edu, nic.funet.fi, and elsewhere. At ftp.mcc.ac.uk, in
        /pub/linux/mcc-interim. 

        Miscellaneous: Suggestions and contributions are welcome.

** TAMU Linux Distribution
   Last modified 31 Oct 93

        TAMU is a very complete distribution of Linux including more or
        everything, including X. One of its great benefits is that it
        has a simple and complete X installation procedure. Users that I
        have spoken to about TAMU have spoken well.

        Distributor: Dave Safford, Texas A&M University,
           dave.safford@net.tamu.edu

        Description: TAMU.99p12+ is the latest release in the TAMU linux 
        series.  Unlike previous releases, this one includes both *integrated 
        source* and binary sets, with the entire binary set created from a 
        single top level source make. This ensures that all programs are 
        compiled and linked with the same current tools and libraries, and 
        guarantees availability of working source for every program in the 
        binary set. In addition, the new boot diskette fully automates the 
        installation process, including partitioning, lilo bootstrapping, 
        and network configuration. Installation requires no rebooting, and 
        requires the user to know only the host's name and IP address. At 
        every step of installation, the program provides intelligent defaults,
        making it a snap for novices, while allowing experts full flexibility 
        in setting installation parameters. Reliability has been improved 
        over past TAMU installation by the use of labels on all disk images, 
        so that the program can detect and recover from bad or misordered 
        diskettes. 

        This release is a full featured package, including XFree86-1.3,
        emacs-19.18, net-2, bootutils, and sources for all installation
        programs (without any use restrictions :-).

        Availability: The latest TAMU release is available by anonymous ftp 
        from net.tamu.edu:pub/linux.

** SlackWare Linux v1.1.0
   Last modified 5 Nov 93

        Slackware Linux is a distribution of Linux modeled on the SLS 
        release. Many people have found Slackware to be preferable to
        SLS, but I have never used it personally.

        Distributor: Patrick Volkerding <volkerdi@mhd1.moorhead.msus.edu>

        Description: Slackware Linux is a full featured distribution of the 
        Linux operating system designed for 386/486 computers with a 3.5" 
        floppy. Slackware changes rapidly, but here's a current (partial) 
        feature list:

        A series (14 disks): Base Linux 0.99pl13 OS and utilities. 
          Networking, UUCP, gcc/g++ 2.4.5, libc 4.4.4, and more.
        E series (5 disks): Emacs 19.19.
        F series (1 disk): FAQs, HOWTOs, and other documentation.
        OI series (3 disks): ObjectBuilder 2.0 for X.
        X series (5 disks): Base XFree86 2.0 X windows system with fvwm. 
        XAP series (2 disks): X windows applications such as seyon and 
          ghostview.
        XD series (3 disks): X windows program/server development.
        XV series (2 disks): XView 3.2 release 5, Open Look Window Manager.
        Y series (1 disk): Games from BSD, such as "hunt".

        Availability: The home site is ftp.cdrom.com, where the latest 
        distribution can be found in /pub/linux/slackware. To make it easy 
        to download, the disks can also be found pre-zooed in 
        /pub/linux/zooed_slackware. (Zoo is just a compression utility for
        MS-DOS). 

        Ordering: FTP only, although various independent distributors provide 
        it on disk, floppy, and CD. 


** Debian Linux Distribution
   Last modified 31 Oct 93

        Debian Linux is an attempt to create the ``Mother of All 
        Distributions''. Sure, there are several such attempts out there,
        but no need to be competitive. Debian is currently under
        development, and an ALPHA version is available. For the full 
        take on Debian, join the mailing list. See below.

        Debian features a smart installation procedure, easy upgradablity,
        a file system standard base on the FSSTND channel discussions, and
        an obscure name. It might be worth checking out. (I am including
        information on Debian here, even though it is currently in ALPHA,
        because it's important for people to aid the development of 
        distributions. The thing that Linux lacks the most right now is 
        a working, mature distribution. No distribution of Linux should ship
        with broken binaries. Period. 

        Distributor: Ian A. Murdock <imurdock@shell.portal.com>

        Description: For those of you who are not familiar with Debian 
        Linux, it is an effort to create a well thought-out, powerful, 
        flexible yet complete Linux distribution. The effort has been 
        underway since approximately August, and there is an ALPHA version 
        of Debian available to developers and testers on the Debian mailing 
        list (see below for details). Though still labeled 'ALPHA', Debian 
        is quite stable in it's current state. It should move into BETA 
        within the next few releases. I am truly hoping for a public release 
        by the end of the year.

        Please 'finger imurdock@sage.cc.purdue.edu' for the latest 
        announcements.

        It should be pointed out that Debian Linux is still ALPHA; therefore, 
        if you have no intention of being actively involved in either 
        development or testing, then please wait until it is publically 
        released.  It shouldn't be much longer now, anyway.

        Availability: Not yet publically available. To obtain Debian Linux you 
        must join the Debian mailing list:

        For help, send mail to <debian-linux-request@netcom.com> with 'help' 
          in the body of the message.
        To join, send mail to <debian-linux-request@netcom.com> with 
          'join debian' in the body of the message.
        The actual mailing list address is <debian-linux@netcom.com>. No 
        special keys (i.e., 'X-Mn-Key') are needed.

        Ordering: Not yet available by mail, but it will be eventually 
        (specifically, when it is done). More details will be forthcoming 
        when appropriate.

** Linux from Nascent CD-ROM
   Last modified 31 Oct 93

        Yet another Linux Distribution with a bizarre name. Soon we'll be
        seeing CD-ROMs from ``Throatwobbler Mangrove Labs''. 

        Note that there are many other CD-ROM distributions of Linux than
        those listed here. I have not received submissions from the maintainers
        of those CD-ROM distributions.

        Distributor: Nascent Technology

        Description: The Linux from Nascent CDROM is a new distribution of 
        the Linux operating system which includes over 400 mbytes of source 
        code, binaries, and documentation for Linux and applications. It 
        features automated root, swap, package, network, and user account 
        installation from CDROM. Linux can be can be run directly from the 
        CDROM and floppy. The Nascent CDROM features Xwindows, Openlook, TeX, 
        GNU compiler and utilities, Magic and Spice electronic design tools, 
        and over 100 high resolution images translated from Kodak PhotoCD(TM).
        Each source archive is distributed with an associated notes file to
        allow you to browse and install applications using a consistent
        interface.

        A listing of the contents of the Nascent CDROM as well as a current
        copy of the CDROM announcement and order form may be obtained via
        anonymous ftp at netcom.com:/pub/nascent.

        Ordering: The Linux from Nascent CDROM, Version 1.0, is only $39.95 
        plus shipping and handling.  Nascent also offers the Linux from 
        Nascent Plus package for only $89.95, which includes six months of 
        email support and a 30% discount off a future release of the CDROM 
        with your CDROM purchase. Nascent accepts Mastercard, VISA, checks, 
        and money orders as payment.

        the software itself. 

** SLS on Diskettes (Takelap Systems Ltd.)
   Last modified 31 Oct 93

        SLS is one of the most popular distributions of Linux. In recent

** SLS or Slackware on disk or tape (Clark Internet Services)
   Last modified 31 Oct 93

        This is a distribution of SLS and the SLS variant ``Slackware''
        Linux distribution on diskette or tape. This is a very affordable
        distribution. They also sell printed copies of my book on 
        installing Linux. 

        Distributor: Clark Internet Services, C/O Stephen Balbach

        Description: The latest version of Linux on disk and tape direct from 
        the net at affordable prices.  120MB installed on 3.5" disks. 90MB 
        installed on 5.25" disks.

* 3. Layered Software Products
        This section contains information on layered commercial software
        packages that are available via mail order only. Linux of course
        has much, much software available for free via anonymous FTP; this
        section only lists those few commercial software products that you
        can't get via anonymous FTP.

* 4. Consulting and Support Services
        A number of organizations and companies provide commercial support
        for Linux. Unfortunately, this version of the HOWTO doesn't contain
        any of this information; hopefully a future release will contain
        this information. 

* 5. Miscellany
        This section is for all of those services and products which don't
        fall into any of the above categories. This includes things like
        T-shirts, Linux-specific documentation sales, and so on. If you
        provide any kind of Linux-specific mail order service, please see
        Section 5 below for more information. Thanks.

** Pre-installed Linux systems 
   Last modified: 20 Nov 93

        These folks sell complete desktop and notebook systems pre-installed
        and configured with Linux.

        Name: Pre-installed Linux systems (desktops and notebooks)

        Distributor: Fintronic Linux Systems

        Description: Linux is a wonderful OS. But installing it can be 
        trying to even experienced UNIX hands. Shopping for compatible 
        hardware takes time as well. Configuring all of the parts to work 
        together at optimal performance is just plain hard. It can easily 
        take weeks. We save you from all of that. We sell fully installed,
        custom configured Linux systems for about the price which you'd pay 
        for the hardware alone. We offer desktop and notebook machines. We
        ship worldwide and accept payment by check and credit cards. If you
        have any questions or would like to be added to our mailing list
                send mail to linux-sales@fintronic.com

        Our installation of Linux includes is built from the lastest stable
        releases of standard Linux distributions (like Slackware) available
        at the time your machine ships. We test the software to ensure
        that the appropriate libraries are there. We add software that the
        distribution may leave out. But most importantly we configure
        things so they work. Your monitor and video card will be configured
        for opt imal performance. Your hard drive can be partitioned to
        allow dual boot (DOS/Linux).  If you buy a modem from us it will be
        configured to allow dialin and dialout.  In short, you will have a
        fully working Linux system with none of the pain of configuring it
        yourself.

        [Boy, that takes all of the fun out of it! :) -mdw]

* 6. Submissions to this document
        Here's information on how to make submissions to this docuement, and
        on the policy that we are using for postings to comp.os.linux.announce
        regarding commercial and mail-order announcements.

** New comp.os.linux.announce policy 
        One of the purposes of this document is to present short summaries
        of the many Linux distributions in a compact form for new users to
        browse over. This document is not merely a concatenation of the 
        various announcements of Linux distributions and the like. 

        Another purpose of this document is to remove some of the 
        `advertisement' traffic from the newsgroup comp.os.linux.announce.
        The moderators of c.o.l.a (as well as many of the readers) feel 
        that those people who are re-distributors of Linux distributions
        which they do not maintain should not be allowed to post periodic
        advertisements in c.o.l.a... after all, c.o.l.a is for announcements
        important to the Linux community; it is not a moderated sales board.

        Therefore, if you are distributing Linux software which you do not
        maintain, the only way that you will be allowed to post information
        to c.o.l.a is through this HOWTO. Information on submitting entries
        to this HOWTO is given below. (To submit a posting for c.o.l.a, mail 
        it to linux-announce@tc.cornell.edu. Please include a `Keywords' line
        in your header.) Exceptions are given below.

        Here's an example. If you are, for example, reselling the SLS
        distribution of Linux on floppies via mail order, the first
        time that your mail-order service is available, you may post
        an announcement to c.o.l.a. Thereafter, you must submit an 
        entry in this HOWTO, which will be periodically posted to the
        newsgroup. Only in the event that you do something dramtically new 
        with your service will you be allowed to post to c.o.l.a about it. 
        (`Dramatically new' does not include changing your prices or the
        versions of the software that you distribute. The moderators have
        the final say on just what consititutes `dramatically new'. :) ) 
        The purpose of this is to reduce the number of periodic postings 
        from people who are using c.o.l.a as an electronic billboard.

        However, if you maintain and organize your own distribution of 
        Linux (whether it be available for anonymous FTP, mail order, or
        both), then you will be allowed to post to c.o.l.a whenever you
        release a new version. You will not be allowed to make periodic
        postings about your distribution, in order to `advertise' it
        every month; only when a new version is released will you be allowed
        to post to c.o.l.a about it. Of course, you should include information 
        on your distribution in this HOWTO.

        I hope that this policy is not too confusing; the one basic rule
        is that we won't permit postings to c.o.l.a which are merely 
        advertisements for your distribution or mail order service. The
        posting must include new information which is of interest to the
        Linux community at large. Remember that c.o.l.a postings are
        archives on sunsite.unc.edu; once your posting is out of the
        news spool it is not gone forever.

** How to submit an entry for this HOWTO
        I encourage anyone and everyone who maintains a Linux distribution
        or mail order service (or consulting service, and the like), to
        submit information on their service to this HOWTO. It's easy and
        fun, and it's free advertising. This document is posted to many
        places and is archived (see the next section). 

*** Types of submissions
        We are interested in submissions for: 
          * Complete distributions of Linux software, available either 
            via anonymous FTP, UUCP, or mail order. By `complete distribution'
            we mean any set of software which can be used to build a complete
            Linux system from scratch.

          * Layered products or individual software packages available only
            via mail order. If your software package is available via
            anonymous FTP, chances are people can find it. Software products
            only available via mail-order include commercial things such as
            Motif, and any other commercial software ported to Linux.

          * Any other LINUX-SPECIFIC goods available via mail order, such as 
            Linux-specific books and documentation, T-shirts, and assorted 
            paraphrenalia. 

          * LINUX-SPECIFIC services such as telephone or e-mail consulting
            and technical support. This category also includes miscellany
            such as development contracts. 

        If the number of submissions for services and layered products
        is large, I'll create a separate HOWTO for these items. 

*** How to submit
        To submit an entry to this HOWTO, please send mail to 
        mdw@sunsite.unc.edu with the following information. This `format' 
        is not machine-parsable; any of the fields may be any length that 
        you wish, but I'd like to keep each entry down to, say, 50 lines.

          Name: <Name of service or distribution>

          Distributor: <Name of company, person, etc. who distributes/maintains 
            the service or distribution>

          Description: <Description of the distribution or service that you 
            provide. If this is a software distribution, please include 
            information such as what software is included, versions, general 
            overview of installation, requirements, and so on.>

          Availability: <Where your service or distribution is available. This
            can be an FTP site (including directory pathname, please), a 
            mailing address, phone number, e-mail address, etc.>

          Ordering: <How to order your distribution or service, if 
            applicable. Include prices, shipping information, methods of 
            payment, etc.>

          Miscellaneous: <Anything else that you find relevant.>

        Please keep your entry as short as possible. If you need to include
        extensive information, please make a reference to where one can FTP
        or mail to get more information on your distribution; these entries
        are only meant to be POINTERS to where one can find information on
        your service or distribution. 

        Please mail entries to mdw@sunsite.unc.edu. If you provide more than
        one service or distribution, please use SEPARATE ENTRIES for each.

        Some things (such as books, t-shirts, etc.) won't fit exactly into 
        this entry; just be sure to include all relevant information. In 
        other words, this "entry form" is simply the bare minimum that you 
        must include in your submission to the Distribution-HOWTO; feel free 
        to change, add, or leave out "fields" as you see fit. 

        Here is an example entry:

          Name: ShoopWare Distribution v1.0
          Distributor: Virtual Pizza, Inc., goober@shoop.vpizza.com
          Description: The ShoopWare distribution is an all-new distribution 
            of the Linux operating system together with the "vpizza" software 
            development platform. This software allows you to develop 
            applications for pizza delivery services on the Internet. The 
            distribution itself is based on MCC-Interim 0.99.pl10 and uses 
            Linux kernel version 0.99.pl13. Other software included in the 
            release includes XFree86 1.3, Emacs, TeX, TCP/IP networking, and 
            more.

            The release is distributed on 42 floppies (for the full system), 
            each floppy may be installed optionally.

          Availability: ShoopWare v1.0 is available via anonymous FTP from 
            shoop.vpizza.com in the directory /pub/ShoopWare. 

          Ordering: n/a (this is only an FTP distribution)
          Miscellaneous: Mail goober@shoop.vpizza.com if you have questions or 
            comments about this release.


        I will more than likely edit your entries to some degree if I find 
        any irrelevant information, or if the entry is overly verbose. 
        Otherwise the content should remain the same.

        When making submissions to the Distribution-HOWTO, you grant implicit
        permission for me to use the entries in other materials, such as books 
        from the LDP, and other online documents. For example, information
        from the Distribution-HOWTO may be included in a published Linux book.
        If you do not want me to include your entry in materials other than
        the Distribution-HOWTO, please say so.


** Acknowledgements
        Thanks to Bill Riemers, who produced the first version of the
        Distribution HOWTO and provided helpful advice. Also, thanks to 
        all of the people who have contributed to this document. I hope
        that future releases of this HOWTO will be useful to the Linux
        community; unfortunately, gathering information on the many services
        out there is a difficult task. Your contributions make this task
        much easier.
