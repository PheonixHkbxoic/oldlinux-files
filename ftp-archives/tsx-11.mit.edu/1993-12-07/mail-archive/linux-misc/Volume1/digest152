        Does any Linux guru know why the following would happen or know 
        of a solution???

        I get general protection error 0000 and swapper failing to free space
        whenever I over-use or cause repeated BELL events (BEEPS) on the 
        console.  If I cause the BELL (BEEPS) on non-console ttys all is fine
        no errors.  The ctrl-g (bell) also causes this *crash* to happen.

        I am losing my mind as to why this happens (Using Slackware and pl11.).
        It does the same thing with .99pl13...not sure what to do.

        The same setup works without any problems whatsoever on my Linux 
        setup at home (486/33 Gateway 2000).  Could the BELL events cause 
        the OS to die or conflict with other parts like CARDS etc..??

        Is there 
Paul

        Uploading a development version of a software without asking its
developper, me for the e2fsprogs, first is not a courtesy !

        e2fsprogs version 0.3b is a *DEVELOPMENT* version and should not
have been released to the public.  I won't support it and I'd like people
to use it with care.

        The next official version of the ext 2 fs programs will be numbered
0.3c and will be available in a few days.

I've  looked at the FAQ and can't seem to find this out... will 
Linux function as a domain name server?

Also, since I lost the compatibility list, can Linux work on a token    
ring network with IBM 16/4 adapters?

I believe there is a *free* manual, but it's from Motorola, and it only covers
the MPC-601 processor, not the entire PowerPC system.  

It gives tech details, instruction sets, timing diagrams, pinouts, etc for 
(hopefully?) those wishing to (dirty word, ahead) clone the MPC-601?  At the
very least it should give _more_ than enough detail for programming the low
levels of the processor.  

Now for the rest of the system, guess it's back to big blue... :(

Earlier on this newsgroup, (.misc) someone posted a summary/brief about how
they booted dosemu and installed the stacker driver so they could access their
msdos drive via dosemu, even though their drive was "stacked".  

Could the person (or anyone with a copy) please send me this message, or

As I'm still searching for answers on booting dosemu, please include any

Check in /etc/fstab -- look at the line for your root partition
If it is

POSIX doesn't say anything about SIGBUS, and Linux will never
generate it.  The solution you used should be safe.  I thought Linus
said a while back that he was going to #define SIGBUS SIGUNUSED to keep
this from coming up on a regular basis?  <tries it> Yes, in my pl13alpha
headers that's in fact the case.  I had been doing the #define thang
for quite some time to make porting easier.

        My Linux/OS2 box at home works great -- using pl13.

        Using Linux at ISU Univ crashes like no tomorrow -- using pl11 or 13.

        I should mention it only crashes when I hit ^G (BELL) on console and
        it doesn't matter what package I am in to make the bell go off.  It
        give me General Protection error 0000 -- then the swapper dies and
        I am all locked up :( .  Using this machine from telnet works fine..
        no crashes or locks.

I know of this driver too, I even tried it around the middle of
the year, but was somewhat disappointed. So I decided to write
the *DOS* driver to circumvent the potential problems ftape had
at that times, because I wanted to be able to backup my Linux HD
(I heard recently, that the last version ftape-0.9.6 should be
much more stable and reliable than earlier versions, but I
can not install it until I'll upgrade to at least 0.99pl12)

For now I'm able to take complete snapshots of my system (or at
least of my root partition) and are able to boot immediately after
restore. Something that is of some interest to me is exchanging
different free Unix OS's (ie Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD) on the same
partition in around three quarters of an hour via tape (or even shorter,
if I zip the complete partition into a file on our Novell server :-)

In terms of QIC specs you may be right (I don't know them), but
I used the term in the usual common sense to denote the type
of tape drive I have. But to clarify another point: I did not
write a QIC-xxx device driver for DOS, but a driver that maps
an arbitrary portion of my disk (my Unix partition) into a regular
DOS file, which I am capable to compress and backup using my
Central Point Backup Software delivered with my IOMEGA tape drive
(this gives me an image backup of my Unix partition in QIC-80
format, to be exact) or using any other useful DOS program and
storage medium (see paragraph above).

back,up & away

Subject: Setting active partition on second hard drive
Date: Fri, 24 Sep 1993 01:56:44 GMT

Hi everyone,

    I have two hard drives: Westen Digital 340MB as master, Maxtor 130MB
as slave.  I was considering using the 130MB dive to run linux on while 
leaving the 340MB drive solely DOS.

Question: Can I make the linux partion on the 2nd drive the active partition?

I tried to do this with fdisk (with both drives having DOS partitions) and 
it said that only partions on the first drive can be made active.

Does this mean that I am unable to run linux on the 130MB drive because 
I can't make it the active partion (short of physically swapping the drives).

Admittedly I haven't delved much into linux, so I don't even know if this
makes a difference.  But if I have to have the linux partition on the first 
drive (the 340MB), I'll have to backup and repartion the whole thing (yuck!).
I'd really prefer to keep my O.S's on separate drives if possible.

Any info is appreciated.

Thanks,

Tim

        Is this BIOS supported: American Megatrin ???
