        Hmmm...did we get the same copy? :(  Mine wouldn't evenc compile...
the nnmaster wouldn't ln because of a whole bunch of missing functions
(that should be in db.c, and are in db.c.orig).  I cheated (or think I
did) but adding those functions to stubs.c and then it compiled.  Then
I got a problem with the active file...it couldn't find it or read it
or something similar to that, which I figured was a result of those
missing functions :(

        I would really like to see this working so that i don't have to
create those massive database files that are already created by INN, so
recommendations are appreciated :)

Subject: Want more than 2 IDE Drives?
Date: 23 Aug 1993 22:00:00 GMT

I just ran across an IDE controller card made by Wonder Systems
in Fremont,Calif. (510) 490-6298. This card supports four hard
drives and four floppies. I paid $65 for it yesterday. Caveat:
I couldn't get it to work with my system, but you might give
it a try if you can get it with return privileges.

If it works like it is supposed to it would eliminate the
need for atdisk2 or, for dos, 3_drives (which also never seemed
to work for me).

The card seems to contain two separate IDE controllers that can
be enabled individually as far as the hard disks go. I wish it
worked for me.

Normally, yes! Theoretically, the only thing you have to do is to put the
doublespace driver into the config.sys (autoexec.bat ???) of DOSEMU 's boot
partition (image file) ;-) But, perhaps (I 've never tried because I do not use
doublespace), DOSEMU crashes when loading the driver ... :-( Then, there is no
way. Anyway, the driver must be there to have access to the doublespaced files.

Oh my goodness. Is that the real truth ? No.

Sorry. You forgot to say, that the new libraries are compatible
to the older ones. I think that's more important !!!

Don't know what problems your friend had ... ?!

An example: I started with SLS 1.01
That was a system with the shared lib release libc.so.4.3.3.
I had gcc 2.3.3, gas 1.38, ... and the kernel 0.99 pl 8 or so.

Then I wanted to compile and install the newer kernel 0.99 pl 11.
What was to to ...

I saw in the README, that the kernel can only be successfull compiled
with gcc-2.4.5. Ok I fetched this one via ftp mailer. No problem.

I saw, that gcc-2.4.5 was compiled with newer shared libs
(I had libc.so.4.3.3, I needed libc.so.4.4.1). NO problem...ftp mail...

The only thing I had to do, to upgrade the shared libs, was
to do an

        cd /lib
        ln -sf libc.so.4.4.1 libc.so.4

No problem under a running system !!!! 
Important is the option f to force the symbolic link.

And what I want to make clear .... the new shared libs are compatible
to the older ones ... I could use every binary, that was compiled and
linked when the old shared libs were in use !!!!!!

Hi there!

One of these days Linus posted a small patch to the pl12-kernel to
keep it from dying under heavy load. Well, that thing helped quite a
bit. My machine has been able to bear its hard life for four days, but
then, heavy loaded (TeX, X, emacs, ...) the death appeared. Same
thing, server quits, you press any key and the machine tells you
"unable to handle kernel pagind request" and there we stand still.

Just thought I should tell, maybe it helps to find one more small bug
biting bits in there.

        I tried it and had it running fine, but I can't get it to save
files (this isn't really where I expected the problem to lie).  It acts like
it's saving them, but when you load them, they're just garbage.  Some
word processor.  If you want to do all your work in one sitting, you should
be ok.  And you can load files saved under dos (not dosemu).

        My config file is rather simple.  The imporant options are (maybe?):

keybint off
timint on
RawKeyboard

        You also might want to activate dosemu's graphics or work your way through all
the WP config menus to set the screen to some "normal" mode.

Well I just tried a UUCP transfer of an 800kb file using a Hayes
14.4K modem ... and only averaged 700cps.  Not good, since with he
same modem on a DOS machine (the same machine actually), I get 1600+.
Also I noticed (using 'top') that uucico was using excessive amounts
of CPU time (something like 14%!!).  This is on a 486/33 with 16mb,
16mb swap, .99P12, 16550AN on the port.

Subject: How to Use a Mitsumi CDROM
Date: 24 Aug 1993 00:03:42 GMT

I recently got a Mitsumi CDROM and I couldn't get it to run
under Linux. With help from Jim Nance (extraordinary person),
it is up and running and I want to pass on the procedure. Please
forgive me if this is available elsewhere, but I didn't see it in
the FAQ or in the installation guide. At least I don't remember it.

The default settings on the dip switch for the mitsumi CRMC set
the i/o port at 0x300 and the IRQ at 10. You have to enter these
numbers into the file /usr/src/linux/include/linux/mcd.h. They go
into the lines 25 and 28 in SLS1.03. Check your switch/jumper settings,
refer to the mitsumi manual and make the necessary changes to mcd.h.

You then have to make config for the kernel and say yes to the ISO9660
file system and yes to the mitsumi cdrom. After the kernel is finished
you have to use lilo to install it again.

Then when you boot SLS1.03 you should see the message mitsumi installed
or something like that.

Put a CDrom into the drive and do:

mkdir /cdrom
mount -t iso9660 /dev/mcd0 /cdrom
ls /cdrom
umount /dev/mcd0

or whatever. That is as far as I have got. Hope this helps and
remember all is due to Jim Nance.

Thanks.

Bob's argument was not whether or not OS/2's OO shell was painful, it
was whether or not it was more functional.  Personally, I agree with
both of you.  :-)

However, I don't understand this comment.  OS/2 has simple mouse-

PMterm indeed sucks raw eggs.  However, it's not even *slightly* OO.  It
uses exactly *zero* SOM features.

Use OS2toyou.  :-)

And the problems with PMX are why IBM is releasing a complete new 32-bit
version that includes an X client and xlib.  The current version is for
OS/2 1.x.  Which should say just about everything right there.  :-)

OC, this points up one small advantage of OS/2 (sorta).  Currently you
can run TCP/IP, PMX, and NFS on a 286 using OS/2 1.x.  Try running any
flavor of Linux on a 286.  :-)

Hello,

I think one should make this clear:

Ther was NEVER a problem with the Adaptec 1542C. The signals of the C version
has steeper flanks, so you need a better SCSI cable if connectiong something
externally and only if you want to use a "round" cable. The "flat" SCSI
cables used internally and, if you want, externally can be as cheap as you
want it (mine cost 6$).
If you use the Adaptec 1542C (I do .. and one of the first ones :) ), then
disable the 3 options in its BIOS that give you a warning when enabling
them (don't remeber the exact wording :-) ) and everything should work.

happy adaptecing

If you look at the pace of development, you can know that these things
to come soon are no joke. In the past other things were announced and
have become a reality very fast. Compare that to how long it took for
Microsoft to make Windows a product that was ready to sell. They
started in 1985 and untill 1992 it was too unstable and useless to
sell. What came out was acceptible only to computer users that had
only experience with DOS before, so they were very easy to make happy.
Everyone who was used to decent computers, like Unix workstations with

even a great step forwards.

Simply not true. I have two serial ports on the same IRQ (a total of

I know what drag and drop is. Everyone who has used OpenLook knows.
You can have OpenLook for free (including source code) for Linux. So
you can have drag and drop. By the way I don't like it, many don't
like it. Why do Windows-users like it? Because they are not used to

operating systems. And that was also not the original goal. It allows
me however to run all the nice Unix apps at home, for free. The most
important thing is to be able to experiment with/hack on a real
Unix-like operating system. I think people typing letters on a
computer are a completely different class of users from software
developers or people working in a technical environment. NT or Windows
is fine for wordperfect etc.

I do agree that there will not be a single winner. But what makes NT
so aggressive, and what makes other react to it the way it is done, is
that Microsoft with its aggressive marketint keeps on saying that
windows will be everywhere and that NT will conquer almost the whole
OS market. And some of the analists and others even repeat that, as if
they were hired by Microsoft! Without almost anyone has even seen NT,
the whole 'world' is talking about it. Microsoft makes the most
arrogant claims about it; that provocates OS wars and anti-reactions.

If only Microsoft would be more cooperative and would want to work
together with other OS suppliers/developers for common standards and
inter-connectivity. But they do not do that, they follow a policy of
war and clearly want to make a monopoly.

The stupid thing is that there are already systems like NT that offer
the same things, but even a better implementation of a true
microkernel; for example Mach. But many people seem somehow hypnotized
by Microsoft, they only gaze at what Microsoft is doing, and the rest
of the market just doesn't seem to exist. When they claim that 'NT is
the best operating system', with what do they compare? Only with other
Microsoft products. Or maybe with a few other products, selected by
Microsoft itself as comparisons that NT will look good with.

Subject: Why not create/use auto VESA SVGA X11 drivers? (Possible FAQ entry?)
Date: Tue, 24 Aug 1993 02:22:24 GMT

Can someone tell me why there is not currently a VESA autodetecting SVGA driver
developed for Linux?  I'm thinking primarily of one like the one bundled with
"fractint"...sure it's not as efficient as writing card-specific drivers...but
it'd make my life a lot easier...:(

Or another option would be to write a driver that would use the code in a
Windows driver [eek!]

There's got to be a better way than coming up with yet another proprietary
format for drivers...

[And before you tell me to write my own, give me the $50-$100 it'd cost me to
purchase the books on writing SVGA drivers to do so.  Then I'll do it.]
