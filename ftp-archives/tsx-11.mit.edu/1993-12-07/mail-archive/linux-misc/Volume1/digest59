    This is a common misconception.  In fact, PC serial chips are the
exception in their inability to do hardware flow control in hardware.  Most
modern serial chips such as the Signetics 68C94 (quad uart) have no problems
doing hardware flow control in hardware.  The 'transmit shift register empty'
interrupt is simply inhibited on chip when CTS is negated.  Hell, the old 
Commodore 6551A could even do that!

    With the right chip, you never have overrun problems.  Any modern modem
running V.42[bis] also implements end to end hardware flow control.

    Your are right on the first count, and probably right on the second count.
In fact, a two or four way set-associative cache is MUCH better then a  
direct-mapped cache.  8-way set-associative caches generally do not improve
performance much above 4-way set-associative caches and can even slow things
down due to design considerations.  You see a lot of direct mapped caches in
the PC industy because they are easy to design, even if they do not do all
that much.

    I do not think going from 64K->128K in a direct-mapped cache would help
all that much.  Going from 64K->128K in an N-way associative cache would
probably help quite a bit.

    You can't really tune direct-mapped caches with your physical page
allocation scheme because programs all have different behavior... 'fixing' it
for one program will probably break it for another.

    I have a 486 DX2/66 box and am currently running a dedicated SLIP link

is hard disk activity, I get a whole hell of a lot of packet errors due to
overruns.

    In terms of modems ... I would suggest the Zyxel U-1496E (around $300)...
It's V.32bis, really solid, and has averaging modes to help with poor PC boxes
that can't do hardware flow control in hardware (like all PC boxes with
national serial chips?).  I also have a Supra V.32bis modem but I would NOT 
reccommend anybody buy the Supra.. the Supra uses the Rockwell chipset and
flakes out on a lot of connections... I can connect my Zyxel at 14.4KB dialing
up one place where my Supra only works at 7200bps!!!  Also, the Supra drops out
sometimes whereas the Zyxel never has, and power glitches can 'crash' the
Supra to the point where you loose the configuration and have to power cycle
it.  The Zyxel is much more reliable.

It's amazing that some people keep bashing Peter MacDonald for problems
with SLS.  SLS is not a perfect release, but it is the release responsible
for getting thousands of people started with Linux, including me.  For this,
we owe Peter our gratitude.  His product must have taken a lot of work, but
it's effectively free for the asking.  The simple installation of Linux
is something that can always be improved upon, but Peter made it happen.

Yes, I know SLS is sometimes slow to upgrade to new tools releases, and
his distribution sometimes is lacking in completeness, but it's wonderful
considering the price.  I certainly appreciate Peter's work.

Lighten up, grouches.  If you're willing to devote the time to produce your
own binary Linux distribution that's better than SLS, then you have a right to
complain.  Otherwise, just describe the problem objectively and keep the 
childish remarks to yourself.

[ Stuff about programs dumping huge core files deleted. ]

Yes, Linux can produce disk-filling core files when tools are run with
incompatible library versions.   This happened to me trying to run an
xpilot binary with an older library.  This can be prevented in bash and tcsh.
Here's the entry from the latest FAQ:

Question 6.5.  How do I stop producing core files ?

If you use bash put
  ulimit -c 0
in your .shrc or .bashrc; if you use tcsh put
   limit coredumpsize 0
in your .cshrc.  For other shells check the shell's manpage.

    That happenned to me too... 600+ MB core dump from rlogin.  It also
crashed the system, but that turned out to be another problem.

    You can limit core dump sizes with 'ulimit' from bash and 'limit' from
    tcsh:

tcsh:
    limit core 0                - disable core dumps entirely
    limit core 1m               - 1M maximum size
    etc..

bash:
    ulimit -c 0                 - disable core dumps entirely
    ulimit -c 1000              - limit to 1M (I think, I'm a tcsh user myself)

    NOTE:  resource limits such as the core size limit are local to the
    process and inherited by children, but will NOT effect other shells
    unless you put the command(s) in the appropriate *rc file.

Subject: xtank: Anyone have working threads?
Date: 27 Aug 1993 03:38:35 GMT


As is a rather well-known fact by now, the only xtank program available for
linux on the standard ftp sites is a binary that is wired into some archaic
libraries. I have no idea if that version had working threads or not.

Anyway, I got a fresh source copy of xtank-1.3f off of export and compiled it
with minimal effort on my linux box. Unfortunately, whenever I tried to run it
with the THREAD_MP enabled, it would core dump as soon as I tried to play it.
So I was forced to compile without it and now the computer robots don't move at
all.

I asked someone in the #linux channel on IRC and they said that they knew
people that had gotten the threads working for linux (either by tweaking
THREAD_MP or by writing all new threads just for linux, they didn't specify) so
I'm assuming that SOMEONE out there has the patches necessary. If you do, I'd
like to ask that you mail them to me or make them publically available on an
ftp site and mail me as to their location or post as to their location. I'm
certain that many others are interested in this.

If you're as interested in this as I am, it's probably not worth your time to
mail me and say "mail me too when you find out". I promise I'll post about and
put on ftp anything conclusive I find. :)

Thanks all.

Nice?  It's an understatement.  I just finished putting a Linux box a
(486/33, 8 megs of ram, 210 IDE, 2x16550, Orchid 1280) together,
installed, and running in a powerplant in the California desert.  It is
talking over a 4 wire leased line, to a terminal server running SLIP. 
The Terminal server is talking 56k to the ZyXEL U1496PLUS modem, and
the Linux box is talking to another U1496PLUS modem at 38.4k.  Guess
what it replaced?  An AT&T PARADYNE 19.2k modem!  What's great about this
setup is the speed it gets between the two modems..  19.2k, minimum
between the two!  And if the line quality goes down, it will cycle
down, and then come backup when the line quality returns. Most HS modems
don't come back up..  All this on 40 miles of desert phone line!

The fun thing we did was when I had to replace a executable on the
linux pc from Omaha NE..  ftp'd it up there, and then, to really blow
the admin's mind, I decided to run it!  We did a rxvt session over a
56k line, through the terminal server running SLIP, and it just flew..

Now, that's networking!

The moral of the story?  Cheap modems are just that!  Cheap!  Get a
good heavy duty modem, and have zero, zip problems.

Both will give you this, at least with the correct options.

Unfortunately, tar won't restore the right ownerships unless the password file
is intact, because it records user and group names instead of uids and gids;
and the only option I've seen to change this (in the SLS version of tar, at
least) also prevents it from backing up device nodes.  So if you boot from the
a1 disk and restore yoru backup to the hard drive, everything ends up owned by
root.  :-(

cpio uses the numeric uid and gid.  It backs up everything.  (Specifically:
everything that you send to it with "find".)  It *restores* everything,
including ownerships.

I've been using "cpio -H crc" to back up my system for several months.  I did
a restore *today* (trying Yet Again to track down the 16MB gremlin in my
!@#$%&* motherboard) and it worked fine.  Then again, I didn't need to
restore from a boot floppy.  But I've done that as well, and it works.

Subject: Re: NT versus Linux
Date: 21 Aug 93 16:51:55 GMT

There's been enough discussion already about the errors in the
original posting that I don't want to talk about that.  I would
however like to talk about what might be done to make NT more useful
to people who have needs similar to those of most Linux users.

Many people -- particularly in universities -- either need or want a
software environment in which they can look at and change the source
for the system software.  Loadable device drivers may reduce the need
for this, but they are unlikely to eliminate it.  Furthermore, even if
one can in principle write a loadable driver or file system, if source
to all the existing ones is secret, it is much more difficult for
people to write new ones.  One of the big advantages of Unix has
always been that you could look at the source.  (I could never
understand why anyone would want Unix without source.  This is
probably why it didn't spread very far outside the university
community, where source has always been available.)  This makes it
much easier to figure out how to do new things.

In principle it should be possible to build a Linux (or BSD, or
whatever) subsystem under NT.  It would have a full set of Unix-like
utilities, and be distributed with source.  Then you could do your
hacking in that subsystem, and use the native NT subsystem for
commercial applications.  However this is a fairly large project.  In
practice it's unlikely that it will happen without Microsoft's help,
as the expertise to build a new subsystem doesn't seem like something
many people are going to have.  I'd bet that in practice you'd need to
look at code for parts of NT.  It's even possible that something like
this could be done by porting Gnu code to the existing POSIX
subsystem, though descriptions of the POSIX subsystem don't sound all
that encouraging.  There are also architectural issues involved.  For
example, the Windows subsystem has a privileged position in NT that
may (or may not) make it difficult to do X in a way that I think we'd
want to do it.  (I would certainly want my Windows windows to be under
the control of the X window manager, not the reverse.)

In the short run, the most helpful thing for NT would be to begin
building up a body of system code whose source is available.  Ports of
the Gnu utilities would be one possibility.  This certainly includes
things like network drivers.  I have a copy of NT.  In some ways I
like it.  But I can't use it in any serious way until there's a SLIP
driver for it.  I've seen several public software repositories for
NT.  However so far I haven't seen source for the software that's
there.  I think the Linux community is unlikely to become interested
in NT as long as the existing NT community is unwilling to share
source.  (I've also been chagrined to see that most of the software in
these repositories doesn't work in the final release.  I tried loading
up a sample of it.  The only program that worked was ls, and it was
compiled recently enough that I think it may have been built on the
final release.)  Note that I am not a Gnu bigot -- I have no moral
objections to companies producing commercial software and keeping
their source secret.  I'm even willing to use software from that realm
to do my income tax.  However I also see the need for the traditional
Unix community, which operates by sharing knowledge and source.  (I
*do* have problems with universities producing software and not
sharing source with other universities.)

Some of jwiegand@manny.eng.temple.edu (Don't Panic!)'s comments about
NT are out of date.  Just for background, let me note that I'm
primarily a Linux user, and will probably stay that way.  My
experience with NT and OS/2 2.1 is brief, and in general I think I
slightly prefer OS/2 to NT.  (This is partly because none of the
software I want to run is available for NT, whereas the OS/2 hacker
community has been busily at work porting just about everything that's
available under Linux.  I'm really quite impressed.  As usual OS/2's
P.R. has been lousy.  Also I slightly prefer the PM user interface to
Windows.  However each systems has its advantages, and I do see a
number of good things about NT.  A year from now I hope enough will
have happened in the NT hacker community that my evaluation might be
different.)

>NT is vaproware. Where is the shrink-wrap version? Egghead? Not!

NT is available commercially.  It's been sighted in Egghead.  I
got a copy from an equivalent store (Software, Etc.).

>The QIC-80 driver is loadable.  You can install it today, along with

While this is true, one needs at least to point out that the ability
to load drivers is not in the distributed kernel.  While kernel
patches are no problem for me, I believe a number of users would be
reluctant to do it.

I had no problem backing up a 128 MB partition to a Colorado Memory
Systems 250 drive under NT, while simultaenously doing other things.
(The other things were not heavy computing. But I did use the serial
line and look around at files.)  I also had no trouble using the tape
drive under OS/2 from a DOS session (using PCTools Deluxe pcbackup)
while doing other things.  (This is a far less attractive backup
approach than having the system's backup utility understand the tape
drive.  The DOS software won't see files with long file names.  I
mention it simply to indicate that the system level problems may not
be as bad as some had feared.)

Not surprisingly, posts here tend to be bug reports.  Unfortunately
this can give the wrong impression to people who are trying to decide
whether it's worth trying something.  Thus I thought I'd report that
I'm reasonably pleased with the status of TCP/IP in 0.99pl11 and 12,
for use with SLIP.  I'm not able to comment on the reliability of
Linux on Ethernets.  I have some reason to think that there may still
be problems there, particularly if you try to use the machine as a
server, with lots of users using lots of different TCP/IP
connections.  But many of us aren't using our machines that way, and
I think it's worth noting that many people will find the current
SLIP implementation quite handy.

Like some other people, I've seen problems with rlogin and talk, but
these seem to be problems with the application, not the basic TCP/IP
(and based on previous messages, there may be versions of rlogin and
talk that are fixed).  I have multiple telnet sessions going most of
the time, and FTP substantial files regularly.  Now and then I'll use
an X application.  (I don't do that regularly simply because X windows
take so long to start up over a dialup.  Rather than using xterm on
the remote machine, I get similar results with much better performance
by running telnet in a local xterm window.)  I haven't seen any
trouble, other than having to change my startup script for 0.99pl12 to
get past the "network unreachable" problem.

Given that Linux is free, it's not clear that there's quite the same
need for "demo copy" as with commercial software.  You can try the
real thing.  If you want a way to try out Linux without freeing a
partition on your disk, the packages/GCC/rootdisk or the first couple
of disks in the SLS distribution (a1 and a2) might work.  However if
your goal is to test X, that's going to be hard without doing at least
some level of real installation.  Because of differences in monitors
and display adapters (which the vendors handle for you under DOS, but
Linux users have to deal with themselves), configuring X probably
causes more trouble than the rest of the installation combined.

The code is different in pl12.  There is a check to see whether it's
safe to allocate more memory.  The only thing that bothers me about
the code is that it looks like if the expansion fails it simply
returns the current break, rather than generating an actual error.
Maybe I'm missing something...
