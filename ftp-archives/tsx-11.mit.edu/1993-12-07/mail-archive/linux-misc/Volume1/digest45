Oh come on. There is a host of good X-Windows Software, like xfig, xv,
several games, now emacs is coming in heavily (version 19.xx), several
games, communication packages...

I know several people who have switched from commercial systems like
Interactive Unix and SCO to Linux, because Linux is more POSIX-compliant
and offers a host of good (free) software which you have acquire,
install, make work with linkers/loaders/compilers/Assmeblers etc etc.

Well, let's admit that g++ is still pretty buggy. Unfortunately,
the raw power that an encapsulation of the GNU assembler templates
imbedded in inline class methods offers, is not attainable by any other
compiler. The assembler templates are transparent to the optimizer,
and do not disturb register allocation etc.

With simultaneous runs, IFF the disk drivers have good position optimization,
running things simultaneously will have less I/O waiting times.
No guarantee.

No, but there is a script /usr/bin/f77 which copiles fortran pgms using
f2c (fortran to c) and gcc.

I have heard that some buffer pages are not properly returned to the
memory pool on exiting programs. There is a patch around for pl12,
but it is not in, say, SLS.

Due to that, it MIGHT be prudent with frequent process spawning to
reboot when the memory usage gets ugly without apparent reason.

At last year's USENIX Microkernel and other kernel architectures workshop,
Dave Cutler himself clearly stated that NT was not a microkernel OS.  So
whatever component it is that is 50K in size, clearly, it can't be the
"microkernel".  :-)

I can see it now...Peter MacDonald becoming the Salmon Rushdie of the
Internet...Running from site to site, logging in for only minutes at a
time before jumping into the trunk of a non-descript car.  FSF hit-teams
following closely behind.

Seriously though...does everyone remember the flurry of messages back in
July (August) 1992 when Peter first started selling SLS?  Sacrilege!
wow Peter is such a controversial guy!

btw: don't you just need to make the source code "available somewhere"
under the GPL?  I don't think you have to distribute it with your package.

Now Mark, that's not fair! We both know you get what you pay for (except for
Linux itself, in which you get much much more than what you pay for ;-). I
do apologize for equating Unix and Linux but since the original message was
posted in a linux newsgroup I thought a Linux based response was resonable.  
WP hasn't ported WP 5.1 (or any other version) to Linux. And the COFF 
compatibility you've been asking for doesn't exist yet. As for 4.2 I was 
simply describing the last Unix based version they had at work. I wasn't saying
that was all that's available. Surprisingly enough, the folks at work now run u
DOS WP 5.1 under the SUN-PC emulator on Sparc-2's.

And the fact of the matter is that many of us, as much as we hate to admit it,
have dozens of DOS applications on our disks that we find useful. Many are
shareware and will never ever have a UNIX equivalent. The emulator gives me
an opportunity to give those apps new life without sacrificing the power and
flexibility of having Linux at my immediate beck and call.

So while the emulator will never be the same as a native app it does have
a viable place in the Linux world. My wife and sister occasionally use DOS
apps (I very rarely do - most everything I need either runs under Linux
natively or I ported myself to linux). It's easier for them to log in under 
Linux and fire up the emulator to run them instead of having to take the 
machine down, boot DOS and run them there. And remember these are apps from 
simtel20 primarily (electronic address book, checking account manager) , that 
have no Unix equivalent.

Since I don't have an unlimited budget I have to balance price and performance.
And for my dollar the DOS emulator and my DOS apps are the best bang for the
buck.

I do agree with you however that if you have the available cash, and you're
currently running an OS (like SCO) that has the native apps available, then
purchasing them is a good idea if they are vital to your work and used often.
But for the occasional use of an DOS application that you already own, the
emulator can't be beat.

Later,

BAJ

This is a hasty overgeneralization. I don't know what native apps are 
available in this arena. My apologies for overstating my case here. In fact
I'd love to see a Xwindows based address book and / or checkbook manager.

When you look at DOS machines, you have to pay close attention to just what
the benchmarks measure.  Often, you will find the Unix-ish system had to 
support 32 bit integers and a megabyte of memory, while the DOS system got
to get away with 16 bit integers and 64k.

Your friend probably did a fair chunk of shuffling things around in large
model.  

It probably also helped that you used GCC as a code generator.  You might
try running the same fortran through f2c and compiling it for DOS with
a good compiler like Turbo C (or whatever they're calling it these days).

BSD is quite good, but you need more knowledge of unix/bsd 
for many people Linux is easier to install,
easier in setup,
easier in building new kernels, 
easier to get drivers for exotic hardware and ...
faster in development (this includes : find & produce bugs)

I think Linux-Distributions are better than comercial-ix-versions.

The Unix version of WordPerfect 5.1 does indeed support X windows GUI as
well as text GUI.  If/when Linux fully supports COFF, one will be able to
run the real version of WP 5.1.  WP also has an extremely decent upgrade
policy to Unix for those who own WP for MS-"DOS".

For now you are stuck with dosemu.

Tcl 7.0b2 builds and installs with no trouble. It installs tcl.h
in /usr/local/include and libtcl.a in /usr/local/lib by default
which aren't searched by default with my set-up (use -I and -L
or just make symlinks in /usr/include and /usr/lib.)

I had two mishaps with Tk 3.3b2 (don't forget the tiny patch to
cure the XConfigureWindow race condition for toplevels):
(1) It wanted the Tcl source tree in a sibling directory and
I'd already installed and removed it. I used a flag on GNU make
(can't remember which) which made it pretend that its target
was up to date. It's probably easier to build Tcl and Tk at the
same time.
(2) You need to give it a definition of fd_mask.
typedef long fd_mask
will do the trick. Linux doesn't define fd_mask because
it's not strictly necessary and the recommended way of
handling select masks doesn't absolutely require it. Tk builds
up large bitmap tables to keep track of its ins and outs and
the easiest way to get it to work is to tell it fd_mask
is 4 bytes.

I am extremely impressed with Tcl/Tk and Tk (via wish) runs
amazingly fast under Linux/XFree86.
