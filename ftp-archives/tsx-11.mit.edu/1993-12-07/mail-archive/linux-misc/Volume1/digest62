Ok, so Sun is now proclaiming (in public, at least) that Wabi is not an
acronym.  However, we all still know what the acronym stands for! :-)

For those of us in the user community, the threat of Microsquishy
winning their appeal to have the word "Windows" trademarked is mostly
irrelevant.  But perhaps the Linux group should consider calling their
version of Wabi "WAW" ("WAW ain't Windows(tm)").  This would preserve
the grand old tradition of recursive acronyms, and would also be a good
nose-thumbing at the sorry gits in Redmond.

Just an idea....

I would agree, I was very positively surprised, when I installed SLS
on some PC's. The installation went much smoother than on some very
big names in the Unix business.

I don't really care how UPS works internally, and I don't really care
about the C interpreter features.  It seems to me that someone ought
to rewrite xxgdb, or whatever it's called now, and copy the same user
interface across (minus the un-X like features like the weird
scrolling).  Then we'd have something almost as nice as UPS which
could do C++ and (ultimately) Fortran, ...

Besides, what is meant here by "leech a living off free SW". When I look on
Linux FTP mirror sites, I see a subdirectory SLS in the directory
packages, so it would appear that, provided you have mail ftp or direct
ftp access, you can get the SLS for free. Now that's what I call a
generous contribution, not "leech a living off free SW". The
conrtibution being that there is an easy-to-install Linux out there for
the masses for free (even if there are others).

Just my $0.02 worth on this "leech a living" thing. Keep up the great
work folks.

So long,

    I hit a major out of memory condition on 99pl12 a few days ago, when
I tried to delete about 99% of a 3.5 meg text file in vim as root .
(don't ask)  It took about 3 or 4 minutes of eeverything being as slow

exited with no problems.

Although unrelated to your question (answer below), I'd recommend
you use tar cvf /dev/rmt0 . (with . instead of *). Tar can handle
`everything under current directory' fine whereas shell globbing
of `*' will miss files beginning `.'.

That should be `tar tf /dev/rmt0' unless you've mistyped that here.
From a quick `strings' of GNU tar I see that it looks for /dev/rmt0h
(although /dev/rmt%d appears too.) If it's not that, I don't know.

Good.

>ummm.....  So I try just  tar.  It says  'tar +help'  for options.  
>I try  tar +help  and I get an error screen.

I'm fairly sure I can explain this. Newer versions of libc
have option getting functions which disallow `+' (in favour
of `--'). + has been deprecated by POSIX for a while and
POSIX 2 disallows it. Of course, tar itself just prints
"tar +help for options" but then uses getopt to parse...

I won't take the credit for "porting" it to 386BSD, because I "just compiled"
it and it worked. That's it.
And, I can tell you, it's VERY NICE to work with.

Come on, Linux MUST be better than 386BSD, somebody should do the port,
I am waiting for it :-) :-)
No O/S war again, please.
I know the differences between 386BSD, NetBSD and Linux well enough to do
my own decision. It wouldn't be 386BSD any more, now.

Norbert.
P.S.
Is the Zorn-shell (zsh) available on Linux ? It was easily "ported" (ah,
configured and compiled) on SunOS, 386BSD and even SVR4 (Unisys == Convergent ?)
but NOT on ISC V.3 Rel. 4.0

I think the real reason for the speed increase lies with gcc. I use gcc v2 under
DOS and it blows Borland C out of the water... I suspect that if you compiled
your C program under DOS gcc, you would find a similar (if not greater) speed
increase.

I don't think it's the state of SLS that bothers people so much as the
way people keep on about it as if it is the only release. Lots of people
I've spoken to seem to think SLS is Linux, and Linux is SLS. There are
other better distributions around, even if they don't include everything
including the kitchen sink. Try MCC for example. I was pleasantly

...but nearly all C++ compilers convert to C.  That's accepted, it's
pretty reliable and it's used very heavily in industry.  There's absolutely
no reason to mistrust multiple translation steps as long as one has faith
in each layer of translation.

Where would you get the Sun binaries?  You would still have to purchase

It's not that hard to compile povray for Linux.  In the
system-specific file, (unix.c or xwindows.c), one must comment out the
matherr() function by placing comment marks (or #if 0, or whatever) at
the start and end.

No alterations of the Makefile are needed.

If there's interest in having a POV binary available, I would be
willing to upload one to Sunsite in about two weeks (Until then, my
