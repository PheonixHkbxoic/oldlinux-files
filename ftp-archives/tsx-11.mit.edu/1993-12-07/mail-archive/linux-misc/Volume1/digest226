Sorry about the format, won't happen again. I had the editor run in a VERY large
xterm and saw that only after posting.

To the subject: I can only repeat: There are people who don't have access to the

you can't ask of somebody who posts the article for you, to continually scan the

  So, why can't the SLS people gather all the bug reports/complaints
 off the net and get everything fixed? Seems like the most obvious
 solution to me. Unless they're doing this part time, and it's getting
 far too complicated and time consuming. SLS has potential, I think, it
 just needs a bit of polishing!

Subject: 3 SLS problems
Date: 19 Oct 1993 16:13:46 GMT


I have successfully installed SLS 1.03: a1-a4, b1-b7 and c1-c3. 
In general, it all woks quite well (thanks to the excellent Installation Guide)

However, I have the following three problems.

1. when I tried 'cc test.c -g -o test', I get
   ld: No such file or directory for libg

   (I searched the while fs for libg.a but it wasn't found)

2. When I tried 'man cp', I get
   man: unable to find the file /usr/lib/manpath.config

   (Indeed /usr/lib/manpath.config was not found either)

3. When I tried 'emacs', I get
   Segmentation fault (core dumped).

   (During the install I had a warning that xshlib.tgz should be
    installed but that file was also not on my fs).

In summary, it appears that three files were missing from the disks I used:
libg.a, manpath.config and xshlib.tgz. Any ideas?

I'd like to hear too because I'm considering buying an SLC-2 motherboard.
I also have some issues about the SLC-2 that I want to verify:

- Is it the same as a 486DX/2 without the math coprocessor? i.e. 32 bit
  bus, 66 Mhz internal, 33 Mhz external right?
- It has a 16K cache instead of a 8K like the Intel parts.
- Can it interface to external coprocessors any faster than 33 Mhz?
- Have any Norton, Landmark, or specmark numbers on it?

This is the deal. Some companies are selling 486SLC-2 MB with coprocessors
in the $450. This is the same price ballpark as a 486DX40 from AMD and about
$70 more than an Intel 486DX33. However since it is a full 33/66 486 and
has double the cache it should blow both the others out the water for integer
performance. I'm just trying to find the pitfall of the IBM SLC2 motherboard.

Any suggestions?

Of course my ideal MB would have an AMD 486DX2/80 on it. But I haven't heard
if AMD is working on it or if/when it will be released.

BTW Roberto there is no reason to think that this MB won't run Linux like
any other 486 based MB. But if my perceptions are correct then you should
get 486DX2/66 ballpark performance (except for floating point) for $200 less.
As for X it's more a function of the video card than the MB. Look at S3 for
best performance.

Any help appriciated.

Subject: [Q] Can I use a CGA card and VGA card together?
Date: 19 Oct 1993 17:01:54 GMT


Greetings,

   My question is:  Can I use a CGA card and VGA card together at the
same time in a Linux box?

   Yes, this is a strange request.  I've read through FAQ's, hardware
lists, etc, and I haven't seen anything that addresses my question.  (I
might not have looked in the most recent versions.)

   Here's the scoop.  I currently have a Linux '386 box with VGA card, etc.
I also have an older PC (running MSDos) that I'm thinking about turning into
a environment monitor -- monitor temperatures, etc.  I have a CGA card that
can output composite video.  My plan was to run some software on the MSDos
box and have it display nice graphs and such in low res CGA mode.  This way
I could run the CGA output to one of my video inputs on my TV.  I've tested
bits and pieces of this setup and everything is happy.

   Well, I'd like to be able to access the environment information on my
Linux box.  I was originally thinking of networking the two boxes together,
then thought it would be cheaper to use a serial (or parallel) link to
transfer the information (whip up my own 'protocol' for transferring the
information).  Now, my latest thoughts are to just put the environment
box functionality into the Linux box (I'd prefer to write the environment
software to run under Linux instead of MSDos).

   So, I was wondering if it's possible to run the CGA card (in graphics
mode) in my Linux box without affecting the VGA card (ie, I'd like to
still run X-windows).  I remember reading some stuff a long time ago
that VGA cards were designed so they could operate in graphics mode
with other graphics cards.  I don't remember any of the details, and
the above information may not be correct.


   Has anyone heard of or attempted such a setup?  :-?


   Given that this probably isn't a common request, feel free to email
me the replies and I'll summarize if there's interest.

   Thank you.

Hi !

I posted a question in this newsgroup about a C-Browser-Tool and got many
answers! Thanks to all of you for you effort !

Unfortunatly, noone was really satisfactory (also the couple of mails regarding
XCoral) !

So I began to write a browser-Tool for Linux. My intention is to provide a tool,
which can tell me the following things:

for functions:
- where is it defined
- which parameters does it have
- which functions does it call (normal/library)
- by which functions is it called itself
- which global data does it use
- which scope does it have
- print a call-tree from this function (including/excluding functions,
  and special library-calls)

for variables:
- which Type
- which scope
- where is variable defined
- where is it used (which function/module)
- where is the type defined

[...to be continued ...]

This tool should be able to produce listings but should also be interactive, so
you can enter a function and you get all the information shown in a window. This
might be useful for analysis of unknown C-code !

How should it be done:
You need a parser for C, which should be as close to the GCC as possible. Well, I
took the one which is provided by GNU and patched the GCC (2.4.5) itself ! While
parsing a C-File, GCC produces a Browser-File, containing the needed information
in an easy-to-parse way. I've choosen a tagged ASCII-format, since it can be
processed through various Un*x-tools !


What's working allready:
GCC does produce this browser-file (still buggy, of course), and I have a
flex-Programm called "calls", which tells my the functions, which are called by a
specific function.

I need people, who are willing to contribute to this project. Maybe, in a final
state, it will be a kind of CASE-tool, at least for reverse-engineering unknown
C-Code. I am a little short of time right now, so they might have to make most of
the work by themselfs !

What is needed now are people, who are experienced in writing
user-interface-programs with a lot of interacitivity. If it would be in X11, I
would appreciate it too !

I am not willing to make a public release, unless there are some useful tools
present ! Comments are wellcome, but if you want to contribute, you need at least
30 Meg free disk-space to compile the GCC 2.4.5 sources !

O.k., that's enough for now, please email me if you're interested.

I have just received a Product Overview for FS/370,
a S/370 emulator for Intel 80386 UNIX systems.  If
this literature is to be believed, one can obtain
for $5000 US software that will emulate S/370
architecture sufficiently enough to run OS/MVT,
VM (I assume VM/370 pre-SP), and possibly MVS and
DOS/VSE.  Has anybody else heard of these guys?
The company is:
    Liberty Computer, Inc.
    14674 North 78th Way
    Scottsdale, AZ  85260
    (800) 422-3638
They appear to be teamed with another Arizona firm
that provides bus and tag adapter cards for ISA bus
machines.  It is unclear if that hardware is needed
(along with some honest-to-God CKD (or FBA!) DASD)
to emulate all the devices they claim to support.

They claim their product makes a 486/33 = a 4331.
Talk about sounding too good to be true...  I
need to give management an opinion.  Have these
folks succeeded in making Linus look like a

If you're looking for the math library to link into your C programs, the
SLS distribution (at least) contains libm.so.4.4.2.  I also see
libm.so.4.3.3.z in the ls-lR from sunsite, so if you don't already have it
you can get it there.

If you're looking for higher level mathematical software packages, there's
tons of stuff at netlib.  Send email to netlib@ornl.gov containing the
message 'send index' to learn what's there and how to get it.  Or ftp
to research.att.com and give 'netlib' as the login name.  Most of this
is fortran source, but there is also some stuff in C.

I expect the trig functions are in libm, and you would want fftpack from
netlib.

I saw a table in the Sept. issue of BYTE magazine that the IBM SLC2 chip had
a 16-bit data bus and the fact that you can add simms in pairs seems to confirm
this fact.  Some of the MB that I have seen have only 4 simm slots so 16MB is
the max you can install with 4MB simms.

It sounded like a simple problem to me, also.  Maybe the SunOS version

"valid" values of BPI and length.  It took a _lot_ of trial-and-error
to find numbers it liked that would fill a DC6150.  (And each try took
10-15 minutes.)

If dump would just let you tell it how many bytes to write per volume,
I wouldn't hate it so much.  Maybe it was all operator error, but
I've been using Unix for over 10 years, and have always found dump
very hard to use.
