I am trying to compile and install epoch-4.2 on my newly installed SLS-1.03.
Since the current epoch binary on tsx-11.mit.edu (and sunsite.unc.edu) was
linked with older libraries, I can no longer run it under SLS-1.03. So I 
ftp'ed the epoch source from ftp.uu.net. After some trial and error, I managed
to compile epoch correctly with CANNOT_DUMP defined. And epoch runs well and
correctly.

However, I am unable to get epoch to dump its preloaded core so that it won't
have to reload everything every time when I start it up. The core that I get
after undefining CANNOT_DUMP always core dump on me (sorry if this is a bit
confusing, but you will know what I mean if you have tried compiling epoch by
yourself...) I suspect this has something to do with the fact that the epoch 
source was written without knowledge of Linux's shared library convention.
So when it attempts to dump an executable core, it failed. 

So what do I need to modify/define in order to make epoch dump an executable
core? Please help. Email reply is preferable.

Thank you very much.

Reply-To: niemidc@oasis.gtefsd.com

I have been trying to follow Microsoft and NT fairly carefully (if from a
distance).  It does not appear that NT is much of a threat, particularly
since it has "missed" the mainstream hardware target (486 DX/33 8 MB RAM)
during a DRAM panic.  Hence, NT is being re-targeted as a server-only OS,
and it does appear to have a niche as an alternative to some Novell server
setups.  It is not much of a threat to UN*Xes due to its poor or nonexistent
server capabilities in TCP/IP, NFS, and X.

It was also supposed to be a threat for the "power-user" desktop, but it
appears to have missed that one due to being too slow and too much of a
memory hog.  It will surely be used by people who have Win32 apps or who
are committed to Win16 apps, like to play with multitasking, and are for
some reason opposed to OS/2.

So if you are a UN*X fan, don't worry too much about Windows NoT.  It's
not a threat.  What you have to worry about now is Windows 3.1, followed
by much hype about the barely-alpha "Chicago" successor which will likely
follow it in 1995.  I think there will be an interim upgrade (Win 3.2?)
ca. 1994 that is far less ambitious than Chicago, but Microsoft has yet
to announce any such product.  Chicago is very ambitious, and it may be
beyond Microsoft's capabilities to get it to come in on target (i.e. to
run well on a 4 MB 386SX/16), but the hype is likely to be more powerful
than the reality, as it was with NT (and most previous Windows versions).

This gives UN*Xes with a Wabi a window of opportunity big enough to drive
a truck through.  A minimalist UN*X oriented towards standalone machines
or small networks, with emphasis on easy installation and use, could be
very competitive with Windows 3.1 in resource use and potentially faster.
I am very interested in looking at what components are necessary to enable
such a package; many of them already exist in Linux and/or *BSD, and the
remainder are mostly already under development.

WINE (Wine is no emulator!) is an absolute must for this market.
Dosemu is also a must, and needs to be preinstalled and more integrated.
Native DOS-like tools (perhaps a port of 4DOS?)
Minimal version of X (lots of small games and demos for flash)
Programming tools and big, ambitious tools optional (e.g. Emacs, TeX)
Networking optional and repackaged (including UUCP, news readers, and mail)
Sound/multimedia, SCSI support, Ethernet all options
Kernel reconfigured and tuned, probably with loadable device drivers
Abandon MINIX and ext file systems, integrate e2fsck/mke2fs into fsck/mkfs
Update the user-creation and other administration commands
Simplify use of LILO, including giving it a boot menu

The biggest remaining challenges here are:
1)      WINE and Dosemu
2)      Make all the big stuff optional, but make options easy to install
3)      Somehow make X transparently support a wide range of video options
        with minimal user expertise required
4)      Make configuration of SCSI and Ethernet more automatic and reliable

I know UN*X is inherently much more complex to configure than Winders, but
making it easier can't hurt.

Sure, if you can. 

Look,  DOS can't run by itself, either. It too needs a bootstrap loader.

Using an inferior OS as part of the bootstrapping sequence is  
common practice nowadays. My SGI Indigo has a tiny OS in ROM which
has more functionality than DOS has - it even can do some networking,
and, of course, it can load and run programs. Usually, it's only used
for firing up the IRIX kernal and for maintenance purposes.  IÄ'm told
that SUN workstations have a complete FORTH interpreter contained in
their monitor/boot ROM. My PC BIOS offers a lot of functionality, it
manages resources (memory, devices) and even allows me to load and
run a program. Usually, on my machine, it's only used for firing up DOS 
or NT.

Does this make IRIX, SunOS, DOS or NT not an operating system, just
because none can run "by itself", and needs something as a loader
(and perhaps as an interface provider) which meets most of the
criteria for an OS and *does* run "by itself"?  Of course not!

If it makes you feel better to call Windows not an OS, just because
it has a three-step boot sequence (i.e. BIOS -> Boot record -> DOS -> 
Windows) instead of the more common two-step one (i.e. BIOS-> Boot 
record -> [NT/OS2/what have you]), feel free to do so. 


I prefer the more traditional view that an operating system is a
hierarchically constructed or layered set of interacting programs 
which together manage the basic resources: time, memory, storage, I/O.

Most textbooks I am aware of don't discuss the question where the
exact lower boundaries (to the "bare machine") and the upper
boundaries (to the "applications" or the "user") are. Some take
a broad approach and include everything from compilers and utilities
down to the bootstrap loader in their examples of OS components,
others discuss more central components like memory managers,
process managers, device drivers etc. only, and ignore everything
else above and below.

IMHO, this dosn't constitute a disagreement between the
various authors, but just a different point of view, and most
consider the question whether something *is* an operation system and 
whether something is part of it or not to be quite futile. So
do I. If a piece of software contains most of the well known parts
of an OS, and behaves like one, I'll call it an OS. 

[BEGIN OBQUOTE]

Madnick/Donovan: "Operating Systems", McGraw-Hill 1974, p. 8:

"We will present a framework for the study of operating systems
based on the view that the operating system is a manager of
resources. In this section we discuss these resources and define 
what the modules of the operating system must do to manage them;
in Section 1-4 we present a model to demonstrate the sequencing
of the management of these resources (process view); and in Section
1-5 we present a model to demonstrate the interrelationship and
primitive functions of these modules (hierachical and extended
machine view).

These three views are not in conflict with one another; they 
represetnt three dimensions of one object - an operating 
system. Each view aids in the understanding and study of an
operating system, and together they form the framework for 
this book. The models used are extensions of the work of others,
most notably, Dijkstra (1968), Donovan(1972), Hansen (1970,1971),
Saltzer (1966), and Madnick (1969).

The primary view we take in this book is that the operating system
is a collection of programs (algorithms) designed to manage the system's
resources, namely, memory, processors, devices, and information (program
and data). [...]"

If you have some space left on disk, use '-finline-functions' ,too.
I've compiled it on OS/2 and Linux, and on a 1024x768 pic with full
quality (-q9 -a) it uses 2 minutes less (of 18 !) compiled with this.
Shure, it grows awfully big, but what the hell....

I started with stock MIT X11R5 when porting it to Linux, using the X386
server therein and making the Linux kernel look like SVR4, since that was
one of the best supported OS' in the distribution. X386 was a heavily
massaged version of a 386 port of X11R4 by Thomas Roell, and MIT replaced
much of the assembler code with straightforward C (for portability, no
doubt). When the original folks of XFree86 got together, they wanted to
merge the speedups that each had made to MIT's X11R5. What grew out of
this is a very fine development and distribution team that is actively
involved in server architecture, OS portability and driver delelopment.
XFree86 is X11R5, with essentially the same copyright, and just as
freely available as the original. One could take some of the XFree86
code pertaining to Linux and merge it back into stock X11R5, but there
would be no advantage to be gained.

Subject: Re: Stacker-like Compression?
Date: 2 Sep 93 18:30:32

People interested in compressed file systems might find the following
magazine article interesting: "Inside MS-DOS 6" (Byte, July 1993, p.197).
After skipping the first page about the MemMaker stuff you
find a relatively detailed and clear description of the DoubleSpace
compressed file system. This system solves the problem of random
access by having two levels of allocation blocks: Files are made up of
some number of 8k FAT clusters, which are then compressed and stored
into 1 to 16 512 byte sectors that do not have to be contiguous on the
disk. The mapping from clusters to sectors is kept in a separate table.
This compression scheme runs under a normal MS-DOS file system. I think
some similar trick is also used in Stacker and its competitors, and I
do not see any reason why this idea of two-level allocation could not
be used in Linux, too. Might it be feasible to modify one of the
existing file systems to use it?

Another relevant article is "On-line Data Compression in a Log-structured
File System" (Michael Burrows, Charles Jerian, Butler Lampson, and
Timothy Mann, ACM SIGPLAN Notices vol. 27 #9, September 1992). The authors
argue that on-the-fly compression and a LFS is a very good combination.
They also provide summaries of other compression schemes.

        10 MBits/sec even ISA DMA doesn't have much of a problem.

You could use the shell script

#!/bin/sh
exec tcsh | tee /dev/tty8

as the login shell for these users. This will give you a log. 

In straight text mode (ls, cat) you will have a clear impression
of what is going on. If your users start using vi/emacs and other
curses programs you might be in trouble.

If your terminal is more or less the same (i.e. the modem user also 
has a 24 line vt100)  your screen will still be more or less be the same.

                Good luck "spying"

Maybe because he's on vacation, with just a daemon auto-posting
the helpful daily posting?  Maybe because he hasn't seen a question
he can answer better than some of the other helpful people on c.o.l.*?
Maybe because just keeping up with the "READ THIS BEFORE POSTING"
post is all the time and effort he can spare helping the Linux/USENET

Maybe you'd care to explain why you use an apparently

those who helpfully volunteer their time and effort
helping people they've never even met, whereas you
choose to attack people you've never even met in public?

They're called Frequently Asked Questions for a reason; they come up
a lot, and they usually have simple answers.  Face it, IF PEOPLE READ
THE FAQS LIKE THEY'VE BEEN ASKED TO, THE TRAFFIC ON THIS GROUP WOULD
GO DOWN BY HALF.  (Sorry for shouting.)  Not that reading the FAQs is
very common; I'm guilty of not reading them closely enough myself.
But if there's not a pointer to them like Ian's daily post, people don't
know they exist.  Not everybody bothers to check rtfm.mit.edu...

The Linux groups need to calm down; some of the readers are biting the
hands that feed them (Ian Jackson, Peter MacDonald), and if it keeps
up, they'll leave.  That would suck for everybody.

Just go away if you don't have any better to say.
