I think there are at least some of us who RUN LINUX who *still* don't

but I don't know much about what differentiates them.

Date: 23 Nov 1993 16:31:04 GMT

In June 1994 NeXT will release "OpenStep" to the public domain
This will be a full and open version of their operating system
interface, with the full object heirarchy, the Interface
Builder, and the underlying messaging system.  NeXT expects
to have a full port running on Sparc by Q4, and Sun expects
to have the interface, with DPS, running on top of Solaris,
and bundled with every version of Solaris sometime in 1995.
Apparently, Sun is moving away from X in favor of NeXT, but
not necessarily in favor of Mach.

The Gnu folks have discussed the production of
a public domain heirarchy of Objective C objects, 
but not much has happened partly because they wanted
to avoid conflict with NeXT commercial products.  This
new announcement means that GNU can simply build on
NeXT's existing heirarchy of objects.  
Comments, Dr. Stallmann?

Also, how about a version of OpenStep for linux?

I have a friend who is getting Linux up and running.  Two questions.

1.  What is the status on a driver for a Colorado QIC-80 tape drive?  Is
there one out there in the works?

2.  We have gotten X to work on the IDEK 5217 17" monitor only in 912x684
mode but not in 1024x768 mode (or any other mode for that matter.)  
Anyone have the numbers needed for this monitor to go in the Xconfig file?

Thanks,
Erik

I was looking for a distribution to install Linux. And finally I set
my mind on Slackware not only because it had the latest version of
anything but was reflecting a better attitude. The latest version of
GNU c/c++ was included as a separate set and there was a note about
possible problems with using this version and that was why the older
version was still the official version etc. From what I hear around the
Tex package with SLS is not working with some other possible problems.
I am planning to go all the way with Slackware distribution and if you
guys need a vote for the official distribution my vote will definitely
go to Slackware. I believe it is well above the standards you can
expect from a volunteery service and even better than some commercial 
services. Thanks very much to all who made it possible.

Is there any free/shareware DTP avaliable under Linux/Unix? 
I want to kill my DOS-Partition. But the last thing I need, to do this,
is a DTP under Linux.
I can imagine three posibilities:
1)      There is the posibility to run dosemu with MS-Windows and
        than an DTP-application. But it's not very fast. 
2)      The other idea is wine. But there is a lot of work to do, 
        till I can run a DTP-application under Wine. 
3)      The third - I think the best - posibility is a new project.
        The DTP-Project. It will be the best way to design a 
        new DTP-application.
Please paritcipate and add your comments.

I'm waiting

You could perhaps try to lie to Xfree86, telling it a clock over 85 is not. 
E.g., if you have a clock at 90, change all references in mode lines and 
in the clocks line to a number you aren't using for a real clock. E.g. just 
change all 90's to 37's or somesuch.

NOTE: I am NOT responsible if anything gets fried by this however!

Toronto, November, 23 1993

JANA Publishing is pleased to announce that we have selected
Morse Telecommunications as the exclusive, worldwide distributor of
our current and future Linux products. Effective immediately,
Morse Telecommunications has assumed complete responsibility for
distributing current and future releases of the Linux CD-ROM,
both single copies and subscriptions. Additionally, we are happy to
announce that with this agreement, Morse Telecommunications has agreed
to provide support to our existing Linux customers.

Both of our firms will work together on compiling all future
releases of the Linux CD-ROM. This should result in a better
product for end-users, with Morse Telecommunications providing
technical assistance and recommendations on the Linux compilations,
and JANA Publishing handling the production and quality control.

What does this mean to existing Linux CD-ROM subscribers?

JANA publishing will continue to fullfill existing Linux CD-ROM
subscriptions, but will not accept any further orders for them.
Orders for such subscriptions should be forwarded to order@Morse.Net.
Additionally, existing subscribers can now receive support from Morse
Telecommunications. Refer to the end of this message for contact
information.

What if I want to purchase a Linux CD through JANA?

JANA Publishing no longer sells Linux CD's directly. All orders
are handled by Morse Telecommunications, our exclusive distributor.
With this agreement, you can now get support with your Linux CD-ROM's.

I haven't received my CD yet. Who do I call?

All the Linux CD-ROM's have been mailed out to our existing
customers. Please email linux@jana.com if you haven't
received yours yet. Be sure to include your mailing address.
and we will take care of this ASAP.

What about my subsriptions ?

If you are a subscriber you will continue to get Linux CD-ROM's. The
same CD-ROM that will be sold and suported by Morse Telecommunications.
We will be publishing only 4 CD's a year, but if you have paid for 12 CD's
you will get them. (Eg: Your 2 year subscription has been transfered to a
3 year subscription. ).

For further information, please contact:

BPF is broken as designed. Linux uses SOCK_PACKET for this. Which is clean
and rather neat (except for 802.2 - and if you use 802.2 and you do your
own 802.2 decoding it works for that).

Writing a protocol layer for the kernel is easy providing you know what
you are doing with volatiles, interrupt masking and timers deadlocks and
race conditions all mean something. 
To start with stick to SOCK_PACKET and pl13r (or wait for pl14 if you
want a 'safe' 8-) kernel)

I've done IPX for the kernel (roughly) and if you want that as a

I installed the Yggdrasil Fall'93 distribution (pl13) and I would say it's
worth the money. Besides not having to shuffle floppies, it has some more
advantages:
1. The complete installation runs automatically. I just had to spent 5 minutes
to answer a few question, and then after the file system was created i had a
ready-to-run-Linux.
2. A prebuilt Kernel which should work with most of the usual hardware. (It
didn't work with my network card but this is another story) So you mustn't
build a kernel by yourself. The handbook includes delivered with the
distribution contains all cards (including used IRQs) supported by the kernel.
3. A lot of extra programs which don't belong to floppy-distributions (The
CD-ROM is nearly full)
4. The possiblity to boot from CD-ROM and one floppy. So you can run Linux
(slowly) on any machine which has a CD-ROM but not enough space on hard disk
left, to hold Linux.
5. An update service on CD.

Sure there is one main disadvantage:
YOU HAVE TO SPEND SOME MONEY...

Uh . . . that's not what I've been reading.  If my interpretation of the
articles are correct, OpenStep will simply be an API of base objects.  That's
it.  In addition, OpenStep will be operating-system independent, though it
hasn't been made clear *how* OS-independent they will be (Mach-independent?
Unix-independent?).  Are you getting hard information on this, or are you just
not reading very carefully?

OpenStep does not include IB, according to what I've been reading.

NeXT expects to have a full port of NeXTstep running on Sparc, not OpenStep.
OpenStep isn't an operating system.

Absolutely no evidence of that in the articles so far.  In fact, OpenStep will
be going to the X/Open committee for standardization.  Again, do you have any
hard information at all on this?

Wrong again.  OpenStep will be an OS-independent API.  GNU might be able to
build on top of OpenStep objects (depending on legal issues), but that does not
mean that GNU can just start using NeXTstep objects.

| Also, how about a version of OpenStep for linux?

It's possible, once the OpenStep draft goes to the appropriate standardization
committees.  But don't expect NeXTstep-like functionality from OpenStep.
