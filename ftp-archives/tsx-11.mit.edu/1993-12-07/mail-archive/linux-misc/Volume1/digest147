    Well, I wrote it because of all the questions online about exactly
these problems. If my joking introduction offended someone, I'm sorry,
but I really do think that if someone is going to run linux, they should
be at least willing to learn a bit more than how to insert 20 odd disks
into a floppy drive. I'm not criticising the packagers at all.
    I for one, am extremely grateful for the packagers, and as I've
replaced and upgraded various parts of my system this year, I gain more
appreciation for the work they put into the packages they distribute.
    However, there seems to have been a carryover of versionitis from
the dos world to linux. Unless a particular program's bug is affecting
you, why exactly should you upgrade it? If something is changed to fix a
bug when attached to a particular network card, wehy upgrade to it if
you don't have that card and the program works fine on the one you do
have? 
    Anyway, thanks to those who have sent suggestions to make the
upgrading howto more clear. I'll probably submit it to Matt soon for
monthly posting, for those who want to do their own upgrading.

This sounds a lot like what happened to me today.  I don't understand
it at all: my machine at home works fine.  With the same software (I
think) on a machine I'm setting up for a user here, I get nothing but
trouble.  I finally concluded that there are wierd things happening
with the speed and modes of the serial line.  For example, dip seems
to leave the line set at 38400 even though I tell it to use 19200.  I
don't know why -- it works on my machine at home.  And something is
turning on CRTSCTS.  (I'm trying to run without flow control in this
particular configuation.  I suspect some problem with the modem
configuration or cabling.)  I finally got things to work reliably by
doing

  stty -crtscts </dev/ttys0
  stty 19200 </dev/ttys0

after running dip.  And of course when I kill dip, it puts crtscts
back on, causing kermit to hang the next time I try to use it.  So I
do

  stty -crtscts </dev/ttys0

in the script that I use to stop the network, after killing dip.

I would suggest that if you think you've got the network on, and
nothing is flowing, do 

  stty -a </dev/ttywhatever

and make sure that the speed and other modes are set appropriately.
Also make sure that the modem itself is set correctly, of course.
Modern modems have entirely too many options.

  I just installed the latest Slackware Distribution of Linux and I have run into
a problem with my mouse and Xwindows.
  The mouse is configured for IRQ 4 (my sound card uses IRQ 5).  I went into the
Linux source directory and altered busmouse.h to reflect the new IRQ #.  I recompiled
the zImage and yet the mouse is still not working.  It worked just fine at IRQ 5
(before I installed the sound card) and with the same Xconfig file.  The only thing
different is that the mouse is now installed at IRQ 4. 
  What is my problem???

We have got the same problem with elvis (vi) on our MCC-distribution too...
I'll try to compile xvi to see if that editor hasn't got that bug.

FYI --

I set this up to run on the Sun system here and caught a little typo
in the makefile (the current version on the FTP server has been fixed,
so I'm told).  If you have a Sun4 running SunOS and have the older code
and not the fixed version, change the section of the Makefile that reads

# Sun-4 with assembler speed-up
S4a_mpqs: sparc-sunos.s mpqs.c lip.c
        $(MAKE) all CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O -DCONTRIBUTION_8" ASMFLAGS="-P -DFPU"\
        OBJS="mpqs.o lip.o sparc-sunos.o" FILE=made_S4a_mpqs

to

# Sun-4 with assembler speed-up
S4a_mpqs: sparc-sunos.s mpqs.c lip.c
        $(MAKE) all CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O -DCONTRIBUTION_8" ASMFLAGS="-P -DFPU" \
        OBJS="mpqs.o lip.o sparc-sunos.o" FILE=made_S4a_mpqs

[the only difference is the insertion of a space before the \ character]

Otherwise gcc will fail to link the code properly.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

   This is not correct. Commonly-used RSA systems use key sizes significantly 
   larger than 425 bits. Common RSA key sizes range from 512 bits to 1024. 
   Factoring RSA-129 does not in any way jeopardize the security of widely 
   used versions of RSA. 

You are both correct.  It is very common to use RSA keys in the range
512 to 1024 bits.  However, PGP (for example) provides 384-bit keys as
an option and quite a few people have taken up this option.  Get hold of
the keyring from a public key server if you wish to check this claim.

I have been telling people to use at least 512-bit keys and they really
ought to be using much larger ones.  Nonetheless, running RSA on a small
computer, in the 8086 class, can be so slow that some people trade off
security for convenience.

We can estimate that factoring 512-bit numbers is somewhere between a
hundred and a thousand times more difficult than factoring 425-bit
numbers.  This increase in difficulty is sufficiently small that one
should be concerned about the security of 512-bit keys in the near
future.

Subject: [A]RAWDISK.SYS: QIC-80 Backup of non-DOS disks
Date: 22 Sep 93 11:41:12 GMT


Currently a lot of work is done, to implement a driver for
QIC-80 (Floppycontroller-) Streamertapes. In the meantime I
decided to write a DOS device driver, that enables logical
access to non-DOS disks/partitions under DOS.

RAWDISK.SYS is a DOS device driver, that maps an arbitrary
portion of a harddisk (given by a start- and endcylinder) onto a
logical DOS drive. The HD area is accessed (read or written)
through a regular DOS file. Logical drive administration areas
(bootsector, FAT and rootdirectory) are totally virtual, hence
no additional HD space is required.

The primary intention for this device driver is to get logical
access to harddisks and partitions foreign to DOS, to enable the
usage of any QIC-80 streamer and its DOS based backup software
for making image backups of this HD area. The general approach
of this driver, however, makes it possible to use almost any
useful DOS utilities to manipulate the HD area.

I recommend reading the documentation carefully. This is
especially true, if you use this driver with a DOS version other
than MS-DOS 5.0 or with a partitioned disk or with a disk that
has more than 1024 cylinders or 63 sectors or 16 heads, because
some features/limitations should be taken notice of. It is easy
to destroy the contents of the whole disk misusing this driver.
The driver requires partitions laying on cylinder boundaries,
as long as you want to access a single partition only.

The driver is available from:

Hi all,

I'm that nutty guy who's giving out Internet email and netnews for free.

If you have a home computer (anything from an Atari to a VAX), you can
get compatible freeware to communicate using the widely accepted
UUCP standard.  The system operates as a store-and-forward forwarder
for email, and provides access to a full newsfeed (5549 groups at last
count) and to anonymous-ftp servers via email.  It runs Linux which has
proven rock-solid since last December.

There are no fees and you can download up to about 1.5Mb (after
compression) per day.  Your system will be programmed to dial a number
in the Somerville MA calling area for a few minutes a day.

I'm especially interested in connecting people who haven't yet had the
opportunity to see postings like these.  Do you have a friend or
relative who recently got a home computer but hasn't been introduced
to the world of Internet yet?

Interested?  Write to uucp-admin@pioneer.ci.net and you will be sent
a simple application and additional info.

Hi,
I have recently found some problems using the linux 'ed' command.
(I'm using SLS 1.03, linux 0.99pl12). 
I was running an ed script which worked fine on many other unix boxes.
It seems that the linux 'ed' does not recognize the following script
correctly:

#!/bin/sh
ed <<EOF
r edtest.in
g/^#DELETE#/d
g/#CHANGE#/s:::
w edtest.out
q
EOF

where the content of edtest.in is:

#DELETE# this line should be deleted
^#DELETE# this line should not be deleted
this line #CHANGE# should be changed

The problem is the leading ^ which means begining of the line, but
the linux 'ed' is treating it like a normal character.
Where are the sources of the ed located? Are there any other
sources which could be used instead?
