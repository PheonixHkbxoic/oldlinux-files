not quite correct... it did have a shell, some weird pre-release of
bash with half of the documented features not working, but it was
usable. It did not have an init or login, so you could only boot into
single user mode and once you logged out, the only key accepted
further was Reset. :-)

0.12 (or was it 0.11?) corrected this: it had a mini-init inside the
kernel (which is still there, in case there is no user space init
available) which spawns /bin/sh, waits for its demise ('child xxx
died with code yyy' or something) and re-spawns it.

A working init/login package (by Peter Orbaek) was among the first
'third-party' software available for Linux. :-)

Right. In fact, the structure of the original Linux kernel was heavily
influenced by minix.

Europeans pull their Linux software mostly from tsx-11 at MIT. :-)
(nic.funet.fi has a terrible connection to the rest of Europe, there
were times when IP traffic from Finland to Germany had to be routed
via the U.S.!)

Erm in case people really don't know, I'd suggest reading the JARGON
file.  A dickless workstation (round here at least), is the normal
name for a machine which is lacking in (enough) local disk.

IT WAS NOT A TYPO.

Well hopefully that will stop my mailbox being flooded by weenies who
assume that I can't type or it was a Freudian slip.

UFS addresses this with fragments; small blocks at the end of a cylinder group.
I think the ext2 fs does this as well.

A problem that should be addressed though is a fs type that is interoperable
between Linux and other popular OS's. Like UFS itself. (aka FFS) I've got
Syquest removable SCSI Winchester drives, I can only use MSDOS (UGH!) fs to
transport between machines using these drives, since that is the only fs in
common. True, I can tar.Z or gz files, thus retaining their > 8.3 names, but
this is a pain in the @$^$

In Search of Open Systems, what is the consensus (esp among developers) on
this matter?

Does anyone have source to an ASCII to PostScript converter?  Preferably, one
which will do 1,2,4 pages per sheet of paper?  It doesn't sound like a terribly

even works on postscript files.  It is available from ftp.uu.net as

There's also Berkeley lex, which has been compiled for Linux.  Check
the LSM for blex and/or byacc (they should be in the same place).

        IMHO, try for the ATI.  You might be able to get a good deal on
        the original Graphics Ultra Pro.  (Be sure to get the good DAC
        and 2MB VRAM).  I know that the Viper is faster, but the 
        feud between Diamond and Xfree is well known.  If you actually
        hold out for the XLR, it may be pretty close to the Viper
        once the new drivers come out for it.  I don't know about 
        software support for the Viper, but the ATI has a very nice vesa
        driver that supports modes up to 24 bit color. Plus the ATI
        has an 8514/a emul mode.

Is it just me, or was the claim on the "checklist" that NT's kernel is
only 50K a little bogus-sounding?  I'm sorry, that's almost impossible,
especially from MS.  (Then again, they're loading drivers dynamically,
so that does cut kernel size.  Still...)
