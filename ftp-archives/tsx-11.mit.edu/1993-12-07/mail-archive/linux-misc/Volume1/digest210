It's not..  it's licensed software- source is freely available, but you have
to get a license to use it..  (Unfortunately?) the place you're supposed to
get the license from is no longer around, which raises the question of do
you still need a license to use it?  Who knows..  (Personally, because the
question is still up in the air, I'm going to continue using it until there's
a definite answer- I'm using the AKCL (I do have a license for AKCL) version
of Maxima- the CLISP version still had a few bugs the last time I checked)

I think the sunsite administrators are just playing it safe by removing it..
but you can still get it from a variety of other sites anyways, so why worry?

Okay so far...

This isn't necessary.  In fact, the fact that you had a mounted filesystem
on the device might be why you had problems.

>mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /floppy   # I created a directory /floppy previously,

Now you have a filesystem mounted on /dev/fd0, which means that the
superblock has been loaded into memory.

>cp /zImage /dev/fd0              # although it does not seem to be used here

This is okay, too, despite claims to the contrary.

>unmount /dev/fd0

*This* is likely to be why you had problems.  Unmounting a read/write
filesystem will cause the superblock to be written back to the device
if there have been any changes, and perhaps even if there haven't been
any changes (though it doesn't look like it, given what the source code
seems to be saying).

Was there activity on the floppy disk when you umounted it?

>This stopped with

>Uncompressing Linux...

>invalid compressed format

Yup.  This is probably because you umounted a filesystem that resided on the
same device.

Try the following:

    rdev zImage /dev/hda2       # already done, so this isn't necessary.
    cp zImage /dev/fd0
    sync                        # *Always* sync to be on the safe side.

And then reboot.

However, if you use SLS, installing it is about as easy as falling off
a horse for most hardware.  Once I have a system up and running, it
would be nice to be able to see how to setup, say SLIP, or what I need
to do to upgrade my libraries, etc.

And with ObjectBuilder, the user interface part of the X viewer would
be a piece of cake.  I'll say publicly that I'd be happy to work on
this project as my free time allows.  And the resulting application
would be as fast, or faster, than a similar Motif or athena widget
app.  I have 32M of memory and a fast, large disk, so it isn't a
problem for me in my development cycle to hack this stuff together.

Amen!  And to the people who say Linux will never be useful to the
"end user" (non-CS major) I can tell you the following:

a) A physician friend of mine, Dr. Gray, recently bought a laptop for
use in his practice and for his research.  He is using Linux
exclusively on it.  Dr. Gray is not interested in kernel hacking, but
uses Linux to do his work.

b) In my laboratory, we use 2 machines running Linux as X
workstations.  One of them runs Linux exclusively.

c) I have recently gotten several inquiries about Linux from
professors who are considering getting new equipment.

d) A friend of a friend gave me a phone call the other day; he asked
how to set up Linux on his laptop.  One of the things he told me on
the telephone was that he already had erased his DOS partition,
because he did not want to use DOS at all.  [I had to tell him to get
more RAM first; he only had 2 Mb and wanted to run X.]

All these people are intersted in Linux not because it is neat-o to
hack with the latest versions of kernel x.y.z, but because they want
a powerful, multitasking operating system that doesn't lock them into
a hole.  X-windows, multitasking, and TCP/IP has been the most
desirable features of Linux in my experience.

Subject: Problems with swapfile & df
Date: Fri, 15 Oct 1993 09:50:14 GMT


Hi,

I have Linux fully installed. Now I have some problems :

1. I want to have a swapfile (not partition) So I created the file (with dd ...)
   When I make swapon /swapfile I got the message :
        unable to find swap-space signature
        swapon:/swapfile:Invalid argument
  When I make swapon -a /swapfile no error-message occures, but the swapfile
  will not be used. (the program top tells me swap:0k)
  
  So when I run X and start some programs, I got the message :
        Error:Cannot perform malloc
        Virtual memory exceeded in 'new'

2. I have mounted 2 local dos partitions. When I run the program df to
  see how much space is left on all my local disks, I got only information
  about these two partitions. I don't get any information about my local
  root linux partition.

3. xdvi makes a lot of trouble. Although I only want to have a look on a 
  small dvi-file, this program makes a lot of things, showing me pages, he 
  is working on (example:[10] [11] [12] [13] ....) and than he wanted to
  overwrite some latex files 

Can anyone help me ????? 

Just send me a mail if you have some hints for me for solving my problems ...

Reply-To: koch@math.uni-duisburg.de

Dear readers:

I am about to buy a notebook. It must have a DX33 processor or
better, 9.5" TFT display, a docking station and an internal modem.

I got one offer so far that matches my requirements, namely a
Arima Notepro 486DX, manufactured by Arima Computer Corporation, Taiwan.
I was offered a SunRace-notebook too, but there is no docking station
available for this brand.

I heard little about IBM-notebooks and Toshibas and have neither offers
nor documantation about these.

My main concern is to make sure that Linux will run, the built in
trackball will be supported and X has no problems with the color display
(I was told the Arima contains a Chips&Technologies graphic-chips).

Has anybody out there experiences with any of the mentioned notebooks?
Any comments or hints are welcome!

Thanks

PS: I still do not know where to buy the notebook, so if someone
    knows a good german computer store were I could order the
    notebook, he might send me his adress too.

I heard from a co-worker who was visiting Intel that in a comparison of
Windows NT running on Pentium and the DEC Alpha, the Pentium system was
much faster.  3D rendering was smooth vs. choppy.

Note the test was setup by Intel, and the DEC Alpha Windows NT is in
Beta.  Who can vouch for the validity of the test?

It's nice that Linux comes with vi, but it is a subset.  I can't do real
vi operations like Ctrl-Shift-^ to switch between the last two files.
I can't do a colon operation like ":123,s/tic/tac/g" and expect it to
substitute all occurrances of tic for tac starting from line 123 to where
the cursor is currently.

So, anyone have a vi which is really vi compatible?

That's exactly what I think, too. Even though Linux is still probably
more a hackers' OS than an end-user product, there are already many
people who use Linux for "real work". We have a Linux machine as a dos
file server (with pc/tcp), so it serves quite a few "non-freaks". They
also send and read mail and news with the machine etc. True, it is not
maintained by them, but how many unix machines are?

Another installation I know (I put it up :-) is a mail/news server in
a commercial college. They now keep it running all by themselves. Also
some other software is being run on the machine.

 I was trying to do a rlogin on another system... The password was wrong,
 and just after the message "Login incorrect", I saw my harddisk working
 a lot... Linux began to be slooooooow, very sloooooow... (around 30 sec
 to see a letter typed on the keyboard...)

 But the top command was running on another session and I saw :

 I have a 486 with 16mo RAM and 10mo swap.. I saw that the swap space
 was growing a lot... So I tried to do a kill... The kill was accepted
 by Linux after 2 minutes around... And I found in my home directory :

 My disk was full, and after an e2fsck I saw that there was a lot of errors.

I have some problems to understand why one needs linux?

1.) Only because gcc and the linux-OS is "free"?
2.) You all know the restrictions MS-DOS has, if you want to run big programs. 
    All pc-users switch to linux, because this is the way you can work around
    this problem?
3.) There is only a small change to debug a f2c-ed-program. So you always need
    another machine with a fortran-compiler/debugger. If the results are 
    "identical" on both machines then you may use the linux-machine, but 
    there is still a risc, that f2c translates wrong.

Who knows how f2c/gcc behaves unter MS-DOS??
Who knows how often f2c "fails"?

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.
