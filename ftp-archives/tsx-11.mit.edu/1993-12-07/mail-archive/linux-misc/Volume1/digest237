Of course, if we could run EXISTING binaries of commerical software
(SCO/ISC/V.4 binaries) then this whole issue, is again, a mute point.
We can continue doing whatever we want, and as a bonus have the ability
to run that software if we choose.
 
This means no pestering of vendors. Little worries about which "version"
of Linux to develop on.  No pleading for certain packages to be ported.
An increased interest in Linux.  An expanded market for commercial Unix
software.  No complaining about the Linux ports being more expensive
because there is not enough demand for any one port to reduce the price.

On this, I agree also.  That is if any commercial developer have any
interest at all in "porting" their software to such a small, volitile,
and changing market....  Remember:  in theory, we CAN change LINUX to
run all existing SCO/ISC/V.4 binary software; and in one swoop gain
access to countless 1000's of applications.  It is my understanding
significant work is being done on this route as we speak...

Not necessarily. First I assume your disk geometry needs only
one sector, or not? Second it could be placed in a hidden file
with continous sectors, e.g. in DOS FAT partition. (It's safe
because os-bs checks always the checksum.) Third, if
you have an Extended partition the first logical partition starts
also at head 0, same space is free like beyond the MBR.
Fourth, all this can also be places on a second/third/... disk.
Fifth, you can overwrite a installed OS/2 Bootmanager :-)

As you see, many opportunities. This is why it will be selectable
in the final os-bs v2.0.

: improvement to using a separate small partition for this purpose, like
: the OS/2 boot manager does. Ok, you lose a partition, but this is not
: a big problem on Linux, since Linux can use extended partitions.

Maybe, but I wrote os-bs not only for Linux. Believe it or believe
it not there a folks which want to use 4 systems which all needs
a primary partition entry.

: It's a modern machine all right: ICL 486CX33. And you *can* store the

: setting called "Auto" which tells the BIOS to read the geometry from
: the disk. This feature is quite handy: when something zaps your CMOS

: is recorded on the disk, but there's always the "standard" way, if
: this isn't the case.

Hmm. As far as I know IDE disks store their disk geometry like
SCSI disk on hidden sectors. I.e. sectors which are not accessible
at all from out side. IDE disks have like SCSI disks a command
to read this geometry specs. If you have a newer AMI BIOS and
the menu entry called "AUTO Detected", the BIOS will read these
values. And there is also a warning, that if you did format the
disk with other parameters then the "AUTO Detected" ones you
must not use "AUTO Detected" again, because it gives you not
necessarily the same values.
Or am I wrong here?

Storing them in this location is quite dangerous, not only because
os-bs. There are also older systems (like ISC 1.x and 2.0 which fdisk's as
far as I remember started the first partition at c0,h0,s2
- btw, the main reason I included the warning in README.1ST).

Could you please tell me which BIOS do you have, which sectors
"AUTO" need and maybe send me the uuencoded sector(s)?

Thanks,
Thomas

Note that, once the libraries are cleansed of GPL code and have only
LGPL, and BSD, etc. code, there is no *legal* hindrance to having
commercial software on the system.  {Hey library wizards, has this
happened yet with 4.4.4?}  Linus has himself said that he invites such
things.  Nevertheless if the community is hostile, the companies still
won't port.  That is, if every developer to stick his/her nose in here
gets flamed, they won't bother.

I purchased my machine through Moujan at 20/20 in the middle of
August, after reading Mr. Tisdale's ad.  Below are some
specifications, impressions and opinions.

The System

My system is a 486/33 with a 1.2 meg 5 1/4 and 1.44 meg 3 1/2 floppy,
240 meg hard disk and Colorado tape backup unit.  The brand name on
the box is Accel.  There's a monitor, a 15" CTX CMS-1561
non-interlaced.  One parallel port, one serial port and one "mouse"
port, on which runs a Leadgen 3-button mouse (with 2-button emulation
built-in).  [These are just the most basic details; if anyone wishes
to have more, I'd be glad to provide them by e-mail.]

The system came partitioned, into a 10 meg DOS and remainder Linux
partition at my request.  I wasn't aware of swap partitions under
Linux, and one wasn't suggested to me.  [Potential buyers may wish to
request for one explicitly.]  The Linux installed was 0.99 pl 7, with
many of the utilities that one finds in the standard SLS distribution.

Preliminaries

I have several good things to say about 20/20 -- Moujan was extremely
helpful answering my questions even though I assailed him with no end
of them while trying to choose a system.  He also admitted to not
knowing certain specific details, rather than trying to bluff or
hand-wave his way through them.  They have an 1-800 number, and I was
informed by him that it was okay to use that number to call him about
problems.  Finally, it was decided -- since I live in Houston, and he
is in LA -- that we would attempt to solve problems over the
telephone, and if need be, would mail defective parts back and forth.

Original System

The system arrived after several delays.  There were some problems
with it in the state in which it arrived, most notably that one disk
drive had come unconnected, and the serial port hadn't been properly
connected either.  It may be that UPS was the cause of this, but it
seems a little unlikely given the kind of connectors we are speaking
of.  It makes me a little suspicious about Moujan's claim to have done
a 72-hour test run.

The Linux installed was 0.99 pl 7, with the X suite as well.  There
were a few small extras that were a result (I believe) of having used
the Yggdrasil system, but there were also several pieces of the latest
SLS system missing (it may have been due to being an older version; I
don't know for sure).  Also, the Emacs was horribly broken, and almost
was unusable for much anything other than generic text editing.  BUT,
I had a running X machine right out of the box.  This being the
primary purpose of ordering from 20/20, it mitigated many of the other
problems.

Changes

Since then, I have re-installed SLS on my system four times, and
finally have a stable, satisfactory system.  I had to grub around with
the innards to get the drive and serial port to work, and made some
wiring changes in the process.  All this done, however, I have a
system that does exactly what I would like it to, and has shown
extraordinary stability after I learned from previous mistakes and
went to the trouble of re-doing things.

Mr. Tisdale make a remark that initially made my skin crawl, to the
effect that he expected I would be re-installing my system many times
over in my first few months.  He's not kidding.  At least until
Moujan's installations get much better, most any user will end up
wanting to do this.  It's not a hard procedure, however, and gives the
user tremendous flexibility in how they want their system to turn out.
In fact, it's almost recommended that users do this at least once, so
as to learn of the structure of their system.

The most important issue is this: through all the changes and
installations (of the basic system and of other software), I have
never once run into a hardware problem of the sort often reported in
the relevant newsgroups: no problems with the drives, the controllers,
the motherboard, the clock rate, the graphics card, nothing.  This is
the single most significant reason that I ordered from 20/20 for, and
this desideratum was more than met.  The more inexperienced the user,
the more this should be a concern.

Concerns

I do have some unpleasant things to relate about Moujan's subsequent
service, however.  In trying to get my serial port problems solved, I
made four (or more) phone calls to his office trying to speak with
him.  Once I was told that he was out of town, and would not return
for another week.  I then called, appropriately, a week later.  Each
time I called, I was informed that Moujan was on another line, or was
with a customer, and that he would call me back.  I never once
received a call back from him.

Finally, I got confrontational.  When I was told he would call me
back, I informed the secretary that I intended to stay on the line for
as long as it took to speak with him.  (The secretary is most
courteous, by the way -- no rude disconnects or anything.)  He finally
came on the line about twenty minues later and said he'd call me back.
When he did, he was very curt, and was clearly displeased with my
behavior.  I explained to him why I did what I had, and he brusquely
informed me that he had been out of town, and hence hadn't called me
back.  I pointed out that if he was out of town, his secretary
shouldn't have said "he's on the other line" or "he's with a customer"
-- both clearly suggesting he was right there, in the store -- which
softened him up.  His response was that he'd "have a word with her".

I'm going into detail about this because it particularly inflamed me.
I don't want to go into whether Moujan was telling the truth, or the
secretary was, or even whether their versions are indeed inconsistent.
I managed to solve the problem myself eventually, and I don't care any
longer.  It is important that potential buyers be aware of this,
however.  This may have been isolated to me; I don't know.

Also, he sent me very sparse, photocopied documentation, with several
pages missing.  When called, he promised to send me a proper copy (as
well as give me other information).  I never received the call or the
material.  In the conversation mentioned above, I raised these things
again.  He claimed the only copy he had was with the missing pages;
and he finally gave me the username of someone to contact to discuss
my problems.  (This wasn't done as a rude gesture, to clarify.)

There are two more concerns I intend to voice.  The first is that the
Linx installation that Moujan shipped was woefully out of date, and
incomplete and not entirely functional at that.  He will eventually
upgrade, for sure, but it's not clear how up-to-date he'll stay.
Hence, any serious user is almost certainly going to have to upgrade
not too long after they first get their system.  *This is not a hard
procedure*; it may be slightly intimidating, but one shouldn't have
any significant worries about having to do this.

The other concern is related to the above: Moujan is not very
technically competent in software matters.  If this makes a big
difference to you, I would unequivocally recommend that you not buy
from him.  If, however, you have had at least basic Unix experience,
then the combination of your resources and his will likely get you
through many difficulties.  In addition, for appropriately posed
questions, the Linux newsgroups are an excellent forum.

Summary

I don't regret having purchased from 20/20, though in retrospect it
would have helped to know some of the things I now do.  (I suspect I'd
still have purchased from them, simply because of the intial start-up
time it saved me, and also due to the hardware compatibility.)  I have
learned a lot simply in trying to get this system in order, and
working my way around various difficulties I encountered.  Also,
Moujan -- who is clearly a key player here -- seems to have different
faces, and the good ones I've seen are perfectly adequate.  If these
are all you see, you won't have much cause for complaint.

If you need a lot of hand-holding, or are really unenthusiastic about
getting into your system (ie, the black-box approach), the chances are
20/20's system -- and even Linux itself -- might be unsuitable to you.
If, however, all you need is a quick start, something like 20/20's
deal is ideal.  (I called and asked several vendors in Houston, and
most were rather unaware of Unix itself, much less Linux.  Computer
City tried convincing me that if I had MacX, I have no need for the
Macintosh operating system, and so on.)  You do have to be willing to
open your box and get your hands dirty.

Finally, Linux itself has left me with no regrets as to my decisions.
Likewise, I think the idea of mail-order workstations of this sort can
be made most workable.  Obviously, it does take the appropriate
combination of user ability and mentality -- it isn't for everyone.
Given the right factors, however, it can be a most rewarding
experience.


I would be glad to answer any questions anyone might have.  In
addition, let me use this forum to thank Mr. Tisdale for his efforts,
his helpful responses, and his desire to see a good idea work out.  It
is clear that his work has done much good for the Linux community.
