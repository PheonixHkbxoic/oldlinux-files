Hi,
        I am trying to install kernel 0.99.13, and I got
"unknown device" when I did "make dep". Then, I
looked at loop.c and sdpcd.c. Their MAJOR_NR numbers
(14 and 25) are not included in blk.h.

Another problem I had is about df and free command,
I am not able to use them. I looked /proc directory
and found it empty. How can I generate or copy the
necessary files??

Thanks

hello,

i have a problem installing the aktual slackware distribution on my
scsi-disk. this is because my scsi-controler isn't recognized by the
boot-disk ( i have a adaptec ah152x compatible controler). i need to
have a bootdisk WITH AHA152X support. i know there is a patch for this
controler that works (and i have this patch), but how can i replace the
boot-image on the boot disk with a new kernel?

I've used and like both TAMU releases. However, it doesn't have "everything".
For instance, it doesn't have cpio. I have some cpio diskettes, and I
need cpio. Slackware does have cpio. TAMU does a very good job of providing
the errata info needed. However, slackware is more up to date than either
SLS or TAMU. Also, slackware lets me choose if I want to include the
X development environment or just X or neither (about 20 meg for X, 30 more
meg for X development). TAMU doesn't. If I didn't have slackware,
I'd choose TAMU. Since I do have slackware, I'll choose it. Maybe when
something else comes along, I'll choose it. I don't see any need for
"official" distributions. I would like to see more documentation on the
other releases, but I haven't read the distribution HOWTO, since I only
got it yesterday. Maybe it has the info about the others.

        When FSF starts shipping Linux to customers, you will not be suprised
neither SLS nor Slackware will be the candidate.  I know today is not April
first :-) This rumor is reliable and coming very very soon. Just watch,
don't debate.   --yuan
