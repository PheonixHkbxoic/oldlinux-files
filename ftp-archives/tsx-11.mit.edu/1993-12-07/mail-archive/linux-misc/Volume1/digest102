        Does linux implement supplementary groups? (From what I can see, it
doesn't, but maybe I just don't get it).  Is it a planned addition, if not?

Whups.  *This* I didn't know (or, rather, didn't remember.  Thanks for setting
the record straight).

Hmm...okay, so what other chips were available at the time?  The NS32016 (I
think) wasn't out at the time, was it?  I would guess not if Motorola wasn't
shipping the 68000.  What about the Z8000?

Argh.  My memory for what chips were out when is quite hazy, and I didn't
really keep up with anything but the 68000 and 808x families.

Even if Motorola wasn't shipping, it somewhat surprises me that someone
didn't come along and design a cheap PC around the 68000 and get into the
competition.  Unfortunately, they would have been hard-pressed to compete
against the image that IBM had back then.

Yes, you could argue that Apple did just this with the Macintosh, but that
was too expensive even at the time to really count as "competition"...

When *did* IBM want it?  According to some Motorola books
I was browsing through, the 68000 was introduced in '79.

This is regardless of the operating system.  2) Which UNIX'es have YOU seen

Any complex SYSTEM is going to require a certain amount of EXPERTISE to
set up and maintain it properly.  It is par for the course.  The same can be
said for any complex type of system, not just computers.  If a business does
not want to INVEST in choosing the right system hardware, software, OS,
installation, and maintenance, then it WILL hurt them in one way or another.

MS-DOS is ****NOT**** a complex system.  Sure, it is fine for a single-user,

Exactly.  The vast, vast, vast, majority of computer end users have no
business selecting hardware or OS's or installing such stuff.  And the
businesses who LOOSE soo much productivity by allowing them to do so
deserve what they get!

Well, no...it was a better *machine* than what was otherwise available, but
that a machine is better is not necessarily because the design is better.  You
can, like IBM, use a worse design around better components than what are being
used elsewhere and end up with a better machine.  Think of it like running a
less efficient ray-tracer on faster hardware.

But I certainly agree that, compared with what else was out at the time, the
PC was a big win.  However, if you recall, it *was* more expensive than the
less powerful competition.

Alas, it turns out that they *couldn't* use the 68000, at least not without
delaying things for a (possibly considerable) period of time.

So I'm afraid I'm going to have to concede the CPU point.  However, there's
still the bus, the OS, etc...

It is rather a shame that someone didn't come out with a cheap 68000 system
to compete with the PC in a timely fashion.  Things would be a lot more
interesting now.  :-)

Sure.  But most people *don't* do this, else applications wouldn't have
grown so much.

My point still stands.  As an application loader, DOS itself *fails* for
anything bigger than 640K, and that's why you have all the application-
specific code out there to load external modules at runtime.  *DOS* isn't
doing anything at that point but being a filesystem.

More to the point, DOS is no longer any good at being an application loader.
That part is basically being taken care of by the application program itself,
and DOS is just acting as a bootstrapper.  Now all DOS is doing is being a
filesystem.

DOS doesn't do a very good job of being a filesystem...

Well, that's definitely a big use of it, but you have to admit that it's a
use.  :-)

They also use it for running the file manager, email (if in a corporate
environment), etc.

While I agree that most people don't make *full* use of the multitasking
features, Microsoft wouldn't have invested the time in making Windoze
multitask unless there was a *significant* demand for it.

Well, no, if this were the case then cars like the Ford Mustang wouldn't be
in production in its same basic form for 12 year stretches.  Of course, that
might be an exception to the rule.

Car manufacturers come out with new lines every year because people's tastes
change rapidly.  Cars aren't unique here.  Most consumer products follow the
same trend.

Features are added to WordPerfect, and to all the other application programs
out there, because users want to be able to do things that those applications
can't, at the time, do.

"Cheap" meaning that your mileage won't suffer as badly as a result of the
extra power.

Yup.  But they also sell us things like more ergonomic cockpit designs,
sleeker bodies (producing less wind drag), more adaptive engine control
systems, etc.  And some designs hit the mark so closely that they stick
around a while.  The Mustang is one such example.  The 300ZX might be
another (should be interesting to see).  The Camaro is certainly an
example.

If people didn't demand these things, they wouldn't buy these things.  Yes,
the marketing hype has something to do with it, but because the car market
involves significant competition, there has to be real demand for a feature
for it to be incorporated.

That is good news!  It seems beter to join an existing group than to

Being an APLer I must have perhaps become insensitive to being regarded

that in many cases don't know how to turn on a PC much less what 
DOS/Windows is.  I don't know why Linuxers should be received any less
well.  On the other hand there might be some satisfaction in bringing 
a bit of enlightenment to a wilderness so to speak.

It is a wee bit beyond my ken how constructive a sugestion to use 'rn'
would have been owing to the fact that that BBS system has been running
for about ten years on the same donated, non-standard, and now obsolete 
equipment that runs only DOS (no windows!).  The CPCUG volunteer 
tradition that invented RBBS (the software that runs the CPCUG BBS), 
built it and maintained it over the years, and distributes it free for 
the copying costs, should be in line with the mainstream Linux culture, 
I would think.

Thank you for your response.  I am glad to hear of the doings at WAUUG.

68000 was the first oen announced but shipped late.  8086/8088 and Z8000 came
out at about the same time, and the NS chip shipped after that.

As far as the Z8000 was concerned:  it was, in effect, an 8086 with even
*more* brain damage (hard as it is to believe).

A cheap 68000-based PC would have had one *big* problem compared to the
original IBM PC:  Intel made it very easy to convert existing 8080 assembly
language to the 8088, and MS-DOS 1.x was "API compatible" with CP/M 2.2.
Existing CP/M-80 business applications could be moved to the IBM PC very
easily; doing this for a 68000 would have been much more difficult even with
CP/M-68000 (which shipped too late to be helpful anyway).

How about this: revise and expand the current Linux "mail order list" into
a Mail Order HOWTO. This would essentially be a list of Linux distributors
who distribute via mail (or means other than the Net). It would be a simple
matter to poll for the requested information.

If anyone wants to do this, please get in touch with me. All I want to
do is review it (as I'm the HOWTO coordinator guy). 

In this way, no preference is given to any particular release;
every release would be batched into a single posting. I would keep
advertising hype out of it. 

I see that some distributors (such as JANA) don't announce on c.o.l.announce.
A sad thing, too, because I'm sure that a lot of folks are missing out on
these distributions because of it.

Very difficult to do. Just about everything says "Read me first!"

We try to point people first to Ian's new FAQ, and then to the Installation
HOWTO. Once "everything" is moved over to the HOWTO format, it is a simple
matter to have INFO-SHEET, META-FAQ, etc. to say "for more information about
Linux, see the FAQ, and then check out the HOWTO documents on sunsite..."

All of the HOWTOs have last-revised dates. As more things are moved over to
HOWTO format the problem should (mostly) go away.

We're looking at it, yes. (Michael, I assume you're reading this? Nudge nudge.)
Let it suffice to say that "something is in the works."

I was considering releasing the books on Microfische, which, say 150 pages 
could fit on about half a spool, cutting cost down to about $.50 per book.
Of course, then you need a Microfische reader, or very thick glasses..

I myself would like to have a printed copy of the I&GS. I honestly don't
have one.

Thanks... I hope that in the future it will be more admissible to MS-DOS
types (several MS-DOS users have had trouble getting gzip to work.)
I know there are some things in the I&GS which are incorrect and
possibly outdated (ahem, SLS), and I hope that before long I'll have 
a new release. However, people's comments on the book have been very
positive, and not very much needs to change from what I can tell.

Cheers,
