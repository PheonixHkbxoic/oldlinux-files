Well, I saw a statically linked with Motif version of Xmosaic on
sunsite.  I also saw a patch to allow Xmosaic to work over term.
Unfortunately I don't have motif on my system, so I can't recompile
Xmosaic with term enabled.  Has someone done this?  If so, can you
send me the binaries or put them up for anonymous ftp somewhere.

Thanks.

Anyone who has been around for a while might 
remember that I have repeatedly asked people to take over administration
of series or packages.  The only respondants ever were Thomas Dunbar (TeX) 
and Vince Skahan (newspak).    And Vince is no longer on board.

Putting a distribution together is not too tough.  But keeping it up to
date with all the interdependancies is harder.   Compounding the problem 
is that I also seem to do a lot of kernel tinkering.  I have long said
that this is to big of a job for one person.  There are some outstanding
bugs or shortcomings with SLS.  However, it is also true that many of
the reports are not exactly straightforward.  For example,  someone
posts that the way to make a swapfile is:

        dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/swap count=4096 bs=1k

The subsequent damage is blamed on SLS having a soft link for /dev/swap.
This was just a harmless oversight, until someone followed the above bad 
advice. And, just about all manor of user problems are blamed on SLS. 
Despite this, I daily get mail from people using SLS successfully.

On the other hand, I have been thinking for some time that it would be
a good idea to have a test site for upgrading to new releases.  It
just seems few heed the warning not to upgrade right after a new
release.  Also, SLS has a great many installation options.  Testing
all of them myself is out of the question.  A case in point:  

I always install on a single partition.  But in 1.03, a bug crept
in with the /root in fstab, only for multipartition installs.
Although it was fixed in 3 days, I still hear reports of it.

If anyone wishes to help by taking over control of some portion
of SLS, let me know.  However, to be frank, I don't know if I am
too optimistic about people stepping forward.  It is much easier
to criticise and tear down, than it is to particpate and become
the target of criticism.

How would this work when you performed some operation that accessed

Perhaps semantics but- NT is NOT Multi-user.  It may have aspects of
multiuser support in it, but it is operationally not multi-user.

Oh, btw, besides a non-existent telnet session with NT, what devices would
even enable NT to support real-life multi-user functions?  It can't talk
to terminals, has no termcap/terminfo, can't use X or Xterminals.
Perhaps if it really ever does support multi-user, should all the users
share the console?

From: upham@cs.ubc.ca (Derek Upham)
Subject: "tip" (dialup term program) available for testing
Date: 29 Aug 1993 16:49:24 -0700

There's now a version of "tip" that seems to work correctly for Linux.
It's in "ftp.cs.ubc.ca:pub/pickup/upham/tip.tar.z".

For those of you who have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about,
"tip" is one of the granddaddies of remote dialup programs (it's from
the late 70s or the early 80s, at least).  I decided to port it because
it's really really small---my static binary is just over 100k, compared
to ~330k for a shared "kermit".  The interface is also much simpler
than other available terminal programs, which will make it easier to
automate dialups (I hope).  The main changes I've made are as follows:

 * The terminal drivers are now Posix, not BSD.  This meant abandoning
   support for everything but Hayes modems (that's the only type I have
   to test).

 * "tip" used to catch ^A and ^P characters, doing uppercasing with
    them.  I've put those functions onto tilde escapes like the others.
    This means "tip" is now suitable for use with "tcsh" and "emacs".  :)

 * I've trimmed the run-time messages slightly (just to be a bit less
   verbose, and easier to write regexps for).

 * Sending tip an empty string ('', for example) now connects you
   directly to the modem without dialing.  Then you can set registers
   or do whatever you want.

This version of "tip" seems much better-suited for use on a small
system than any of the alternatives.  For example, "tip" and "rz" on
a bootable diskette should be enough to snarf other software from
a BBS or mainframe in an emergency.  Try out the program and let me
know if there are any bugs.

Wrong (sorry).

What you need is this:
rarpd - to get the IP-address
tftpd - to load the boot program
bootparamd (NOT bootp) to get info on root and swapfiles/filesystem. Not a 
    problem since it is included in Xkernel, written by someone@nada.kth.se.
NFS (rpc included)

If SUNs had used bootp as for example RS6000 does life would have been 
much easier.

Hello netting Linux users!

I find myself in the fortunate position of getting an ethernet connection
to the internet.  I have read the NET-2 FAQ, but I still have one question
with which I would like some help:

Does anybody have any recommendations for 10baseT ethernet cards?  I am
unsure which models in the FAQ are 10baseT, and the FAQ does not really
make any hints as to price/performance for these cards.

Any help you could give for these cards would be GREATLY appreciated
(distributors and prices would even be a bigger plus!) since I will be
buying the card sometime this week.

Thanks a lot!

        Ummm... This has the downside of requiring a _significant_ amount
of extra code in the kernel.  This is gzip on my system:
  57 -rwxr-xr-x   3 root     wheel       56610 Jul  1 18:29 /usr/bin/gzip*
That's using shared libs and optimized/stripped as far as it'll go.
You don't get to use the shared libs with the kernel.  60K is a hefty chunk
of code to be adding to the kernel, the word here is "bloat".

        Leaving it as a user-process is going to a) horribly slow (gzip
is not what you'd call really fast) and b) create MASSIVE admin headaces.
(like the ever-present problem with the /lib/libc.so.4 symlink, but 10
times worse).

        A compressed filesystem needs its own compression algorithm,
designed specifically for the purpose it is being used for, a general
purpose program like gzip is too inefficient in this role.  I, personally,
dislike compressed filesystems because A) they're slow (don't tell me
about how much faster a 486/50 CPU speed is compared to disk access,
I've got a 386/25).  and B) cleaning up from little 'accidents' is
much, MUCH harder.

Well, i don't have time myself.  But there are other distributions out
there!  Try the MCC distribution, for example, which i found to be
much simpler and far more reliable.  It doesn't come with X you say?
Well it does come with instructions for getting X, so this is hardly a
drawback.

SLS bashing happens not because we don't appreciate Peter's job but
because we also appreciate the better job being done by the compilers
of other distributions.  Don't take it personally...

        I'd assume that you could maintain an "offset-into-file" counter
for each block in your inode.  This would require 4-bytes per block,
assuming 4K blocks that's a 0.1% increase in space used, well offset
by the savings from compression.  Random access is doable.  I'm
still not in favour of compressed filesystems tho :)

I think that you're missing the *point*: a compressed filesystem is really
only optimal for certain types of files, no matter how it's implemented.
Large non-writable files (executables, Info pages, etc.) are excellent
candidates for compression, especially if they're rarely accessed.  Random
access read and sequential write are fairly easy to support in the (de)compression
code, and I think that's whtat Stephen Tweedie is aiming for.  The
compression will be done in-kernel, but I don't know if he's using the
gzip algorithm or something else.
