...grab the Ethernet-HOWTO from your local Linux FTP site. It has all the
info you want. The present reccomendation is the Allied Telesis, and the
Intel EE is not supported yet.

Better yet, wait for the next version, as I have a bunch of changes to

I've just placed the source code to swm, the ParcPlace (formerly
Solbourne) Window Manager on ftp.x.org in contrib/swm.tar.Z

Below is a portion of the README file.

=====================================================================

September 29, 1993

Enclosed you will find source code to swm, the ParcPlace (formerly
Solbourne) Window Manager.  With the source code, you'll find the swm
man page (swm.man) and a postscript copy of my paper that appeared in
the Summer 1990 USENIX proceedings.  These will hopefully give you
enough information to get you started.  Even though it's four years old,
it still has some very unique features:

    1. No default look and feel.  Templates are provided for motif and
       open look.
    2. Was the first X window manager to implement a "Virtual Desktop."
    3. Configuration is done completely through X resource files.
    4. Allows panels of buttons on the root window.
    5. Provides primitive session management.
    6. Can be sent window manager commands from outside programs
       (swmcmd).

swm was developed on top of and relies upon the Object Interface (OI)
toolkit.  If you don't have a copy of OI, get one.  If you're using
Linux on a PC, you can get a free copy of ObjectBuilder and OI as
follows:

The release is available from tsx-11.mit.edu in
/pub/linux/packages/OI.  The files under that directory are:
        COPYING         States the terms and conditions of copying
                        this release.
        oi1, oi2, oi3   subdirectories that correspond to three 3.5"
                        floppies that are in SLS format and can be
                        installed with sysinstall.
        oi40.tar        The above subdirectories as one file

OI for Linux is also available directly from ParcPlace for a nominal
fee that covers our manufacturing costs. In addition to 3 diskettes
containing the software, you will get a 250 page book for ObjectBuilder
and a 1200 page book for OI. Books alone are $60, books and media are
$100 plus shipping and applicable taxes.  Send email to
info@parcplace.com or call 1-800-759-7272 (USA and Canada) or
1-408-481-9090 (ask for international sales) for more information.

As far as I know, swm has not yet been ported to Linux.


***  MAJOR DISCLAIMER  ***

Most of swm was written in 1989, before OI had many of the features
that it sports today.  Because of this, swm implements many things
itself rather than relying on the toolkit.  Among these are:

    1. X resources.  swm fetches all of its resources with little
       assistance from the toolkit.
    2. Layout of the window frames and icons are all done by swm rather
       than using any of the OI layout methods.
    3. swm handles all mouse and keyboard translations itself rather than
       depending on the translation manager code in OI. 

swm was my first OI program AND my first C++ program.  It is
absolutely horrible in its use of the language.  It should NOT be taken
as an example of how to write an OI program, how to program in C++, or
used as a gauge of my current OI/C++ abilities :-)  I do not currently
plan to maintain this stuff or send out new releases or bug fixes.  It
is provided "as is."

That is one way of renormalization I hadn't thought of!
But I think it is not terribly scientific either; I doubt most Windows/NT
users will see E-mail access as critically important to the continued
well-being of their system, meaning that you will get *much* more severe
undercounts in the other OSes.
Perhaps one day next year, when I'm feeling adventorous, I will scan
the subject lines for other opsys names.

You don't really need much more memory than you do for normal operation.
However, the nfs daemon is a real cpu hog even if you have only a few
clients attached.

I'm running a Linux NFS server. The machine is a 486/66 + 16Mb RAM.
Performance isn't great -- this is partly because the nfsd isn't
particularly efficient, and partly because nfs on linux is slow anyway.  The
latter would be difficult to fix, as it would mean rewriting the kernel
kmalloc() routines.

(BTW, has anyone profiled the nfs daemon code?  It could be of benefit -- no
other nfsd daemon I've seen sucks 99% cpu with 4 machines attached.)

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

Hi, dear Netter,
I need to get help from experienced people for the following problem:
I have a PC 386DX25MHz, with an IDE 82MB Seagate HD. I am going to install
a 340MB SCSI HD with Adaptec 1542c bus master controller. The configuration 
is that I use the IDE drive as the boot drive. Since the total space
is 82MB+340MB=422MB, I am going to format it to 2 part(how?), one part
is 100MB reserved for DOS5.0, while the rest is for Linux. My question
is, can I do such partition? If this is possible, is there any trouble
or tips for running both the two OS(not the same time, of course)?
Please send reply to:

Thanks in advance for any advice!

it is very simple: tell gdb to 'help' you; and it will tell you about

or fast and concise: type 'info register <name>' or any abbrev like

This is not R.Nation's fault ... it's your's!

The misunderstunding in this problem is that you think seyon call the emulation
as a normal child-process. As far as I understand the xterm it has a special
client interface which makes it capable of being used as a slave-emulator.

rxvt is that small, because it doesn't have this facility (And some others,
either!). So its absolutely ok that rxvt doesn't work!

Use xterm and be it only for seyon! The capability of changing the emulator is
meant to exchange xterm with some xterm-derivate (color kanji or whatever!).

Subject: pl13 problems

  Hello everyone! As I wrote before, I'm using MCC linux and finally I
compiled and installed the latest kernel (p13), but I'm still having problems
with it. First, everytime I boot up with it it does this:

                        1. Checks root directory
                        2. Checks bad blocks list
                        3. Checks lost inodes
                        4. Checks inodes count

  Along with all of this it displays some stats (More like a chkdsk command
output) and this happens over and over. Needless to say that the keyboard is
mapped differently (My best guess, since I can't no longer get the colon nor
the semicolon) and sometimes it just locks up and refuses to accept any input
(it constantly beeps when this happens) but shortly after I press a couple
keys it comes back to normal. What is wrong here? Maybe I compiled with the
wrong configuration options...Can anyone help me out of this one?
