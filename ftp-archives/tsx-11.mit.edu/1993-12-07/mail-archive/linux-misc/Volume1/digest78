XFree86 *is* X11R5.  To run X11 on any system, you have to port it.
You have to have device drivers for the display adapter(s) for
example.  You can also do optimizations for that specific
architecture.  That's what XFree86 is all about.  I believe XFree86
diffs are now distributed with the standard X11R5 tape (at least, it's
in the contrib directory at export.lcs.mit.edu).

Yes, X11R5 would take more disk space.  That's because you'd need the
source to do the port to Linux that the nice XFree86 people have
already done for you.

Motif does not come with X11R5 (nor with XFree86).  It's a separate
product sold typically to software vendors to include with their
systems.  You can buy Motif for Linux from several vendors that have
been mentioned from time to time (I don't remember their names
offhand).

Look at it this way: since Linus (or anyone else) is not making money
off of Linux, what's he got to lose from someone plagarizing it?
Prestige? (ask him if he wants it.) The time he has spent on it?  Not
really lost, since presumably Linux would not die completely just from
someone plagarizing it. In order for anyone to sue for damages there
have to be some damages... and the amount of protection you afford
something like your copyright on Linux should be proportional to your
potential damages!

The only thing I can possibly imagine Linus (or any of us) really could
lose is the freedom to continue developing it, i.e. if someone managed
to legally say "This is now mine and it is no longer under the GPL, you
may not change it or have the source code or give it to anyone."

This is a sign that Linux is using a good libc.  It is exactly why the
statically linked utilities should be limited to only those truly necessary.

I believe a couple of things are already statically linked (e.g. ash).

After some discussion with a couple of other people, "sync" emerged as the
single most important thing to statically link.  I personally would like to
see "update", "mv", and "halt" as well, in that order.  You can get by without
such luxuries as "ls" and "mkdir" pretty easily, while "ln" and "mount" might
be a bit more important.  At a lower priority, there are also "tar" and "ftp"
to consider (handy when files are missing).

I am basing this primarily on what commands I HAD TO have when fixing badly
crashed Suns that I did not have an alternate boot medium for (or did, but
did not have shared libraries available).


>There is, however, absolutely nothing that prevents you from
>installing statically linked copies on your own system if you want.

I think it would make sense to install some things later on that are not on
the boot floppy; that only makes sense.  But all of this is, of course, up
to the creators of boot packages, and users who want to do this stuff later.

MS-"Windows" ties to MS-"DOS" go far beyond just booting.

You seem to be under a very strange allusion, XFree86 _is_ X11R5 just very
much improved for i?86 architectures, and support for more operating systems.

>But it'd be nice to have motif programs running on my PC.

This has nothing to do with X11R5 or xfree86, you have to buy motif, atleast
one company (metrolink) sells motif for linux.

>Since X11R5 is free (from what I here), then what's the point
>of having XFree86?  What's the difference (pros/cons) ?

It runs on you machine. X11R5 doesn't support linux, nor does it have
compressed fonts, support for many vga cards, ... or is anywhere near as
fast.

All in all, pretty good choices (although sort your systems in a way
that makes complete overinstallation easy. Separate the user disks/partitions
etc. from the system ones).

Watch out: gcc is a good quality tool, g++ is not. It has lots of bugs,
and although they are being fixed by Cygnus, releases are done that
infrequently as to make fast bug turnaround nonexistent. They collect
bug reports, though, and so some hope is there that next releases have
a considerable number of bugs fixed.

  Based on preliminary testing, a 386-DX 40 with a Cyrix 83D87 40 Mhz
 FPU chip is faster than a 486-33.
 
  This is based on POV 1.0 tracing the file ntreal.pov.
 Results:
 386-40 with Cyrix:       9 hours 23 minutes
 486-33           :       11 hourand 10 minutes
 
The tests were executed on unloaded machines, using the same quality
and size options for the rayracer.
 
Since I purchased my Cyrix , X performance has improved dramatically.
PostScript rendering has also improved a lot.
 

If anyone is thinking of buying a new system (and price _does_ matter for you)
I definitely recommend the 386-40 with a coprocessor combo over against
a 486.

BSD and OSF/1 on top of Mach can't run by themselves.  Not that I'm arguing,

I am trying to install Linux for the first time.
My system is a 386/33, 16meg ram, 100meg IDE (2 FAT partitions

The IDE is the main controller and is defined in BIOS.
The ESDI is the secondary controller and is accessed through

When I try to FDISK from Linux, only the IDE is recognized.
Any attempt to access /dev/hdb fails.
Is there any way to get Linux to work with the IDE?
Even just being able to install and use it without access to the 
IDE drive would be OK.
