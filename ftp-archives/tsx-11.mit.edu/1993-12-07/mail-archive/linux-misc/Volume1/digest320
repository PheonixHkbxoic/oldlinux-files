Date: Fri, 19 Nov 1993 13:02:11

Hi,

I´ve installed the TOSHIBA CD-ROM drive with an DC 193 SCSI-Controller. With 
the given *.sys files anything runs fine under DOS.

But if I want to install the CD-ROM under LINUX (i´ve bought the 
INFOMAGIC-CD), I got always the message "ISO9660 not supported by kernel".

I do have recompiled the kernel with the iso9660-Option, I do have verified, 
that the corresponding #defines are set in the header files and I do have run 

  mknod -m 500 /dev/cdrom b 11 0

as proposed in one of the docs on the UNIX-CD (for heavens sake, I can read it 
with DOS!). I´ve tried the same procedure several times, always with the same 
result.

During boot, there is a testing of SCSI-Devices taking place (thus the 
SCSI-option is definetly enabled) but it reports 0 SCSI devices & 0 CD-ROMs.

What is my fault? Sorry, if this is a newbie question being already answered 
serveral times. If there are docs or FAQs, dealing with this problem, please 
reply.

Bye
Michael Luebbeke

Reply-To: hevans@wm.estec.esa.nl
Date: Fri, 19 Nov 1993 11:05:06 GMT

A few weeks back I asked about whether there is a users group for Linux in
the Netherlands.  Here are the results:

>Does anyone know of a user group in the Netherlands?

The answer is Yes, but not specifically for Linux.  The HCC (Hobby Computer 

Club) provides a Unix User Group which has its own Linux distribution.  
They 
do meet regularly and the contact is: Hans Oey, hans@mo.hobby.nl

    Thanks to:  devet@adv.win.tue.nl, 
                dassen@sthp.wi.leidenuniv.nl,
                HOOFT@EMBL-Heidleberg.DE,

                rnzll3!pe1chl!rob@relay.NL.net,
                

As to the second question:
> If not, are any Nederlanders out there interested in establishing one?
The answer is also Yes, but since the HCC already provides something, I am 
uncertain how to proceed.

In addition, dannyth@hacktic.nl mentioned:
>Try and call our free linux machine with:

He's right, man!  I run Linux and X11 on a 368DX-25, 8MB, no cache and
a herc monochrome board.  X performance and usability suck rocks
compared to a SPARC-10 with 32MB, a 19 inch color monitor.

So skip Linux and get a SPARC-10 with a nice 19 inch monitor.


OTOH, compared to anything else on a 386 machine like I've got, Linux
flies.  Especially when you consider the price.  With an accellerated
SVGA board and a 486 it must be great.

It's all relative.

You have to build your own GCC-Compiler with the appropriate options enabled
(read built in by compiling).

Unfortuinatly, the sources of GCC 2.4.5 are about 5 Meg's of gezipped Tar, I
think GCC 2.5.3 is even almost 6 Meg's

That means, you need about 35 to 50 Meg's of free disk space to get it compiled.
You need also a 68k-compiled version of the runtime library, if you want
to get executables.

If you want to have more information, please email me

One of the "kits" that comprises IBM TCP/IP 2.0 contains both an X server
and an X client. I don't use X, so I don't know anything more about it.

Subject: [Q] Cheapest card for 1280x1024 72Hz
Date: 19 Nov 1993 22:29:18 GMT

Has anybody got that under Linux/Xfree86 at all?

I currently run a Diamond Stealth S3 with 1280x960 49 Hz interlaced
in MS-Windows and 1024x768 NI with Linux/Xfree. Since I have a
Eizo/Nanao T560i 130MHz Monitor, I would like to get a new graphics
accelerator card.

I heard of the ATI Ultra Pro (Mach32) being able to handle 1280x1024
at 74 Hz, cost in Germany is around 700 DM (450 $).

Unfortunately, the Xfree Mach32 driver does not yet support > 80MHz,
so 1024x768 is still the limit.

Any clues?

That depends.  It's not hard to get a 486 which is faster than
a SPARC 10, modulo bus, disk, and video speeds.

With that attitude, why should anyone lend you a hand?

C'mon, buddy, if you "can't remember" then at least read the FAQ.

Please try comp.windows.x. This is *not* a Linux question in any way.


(Specific note: this question belongs in comp.windows.x.i386unix,
where XFree86 is discussed. -T)

Hi there.

You (may) have posted your Linux-related message to the wrong newsgroup. 

That's OK. Everyone does it once if they're new to the groups.
Please read on so you can understand how to use the Linux  
groups in the future.

Please understand that Linux is being developed cooperatively on the 
net and that, considering you paid nothing to the authors of
Linux for the software, you are expected to make at least a modest 
effort to understand the etiquette of the Linux newsgroups *before* 
posting to them.  It's not much to ask in exchange for free support!

Now, what the groups are for and how to use them:

** comp.os.linux.announce: EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS GROUP!

When a release or other change that affects the whole Linux
community takes place, it'll show up in this group, which
is moderated and quite low in volume. Take 30 seconds now
and then to look it over. The dozens and dozens of 
people still asking what happened to term last week could
have avoided this by keeping up with comp.os.linux.announce.

** New user and general Linux questions: comp.os.linux.help

*Read* comp.os.linux.help, especially the FAQ (Frequently
Answered Questions) posting. FAQs are written so it won't
be necessary to repetitively answer the same question
thirty or forty times a month. The answer to your question
is very likely in a FAQ. If not, if you're new to Linux,
comp.os.linux.help is probably the right group to post in.

EXCEPTION: if your post is about X windows, please try
comp.windows.x.i386unix first.

WHAT IF I CAN'T FIND THE FAQ?

You can ftp to rtfm.mit.edu, which has virtually all FAQs
of all groups under pub/usenet; if you're not familiar with
ftp check out the group news.newusers.questions which has
regular postings on how to use virtually all standard net tools.
Also see news.answers which has nearly every FAQ posted
anywhere in Usenet.

** Questions and other posts about administering your Linux system:
   comp.os.linux.admin

Try comp.os.linux.admin. Again, read the FAQ first- there's
no reason to waste the time and money of others if the
answer is there.

** "Any new stuff come out lately?"
   comp.os.linux.announce

Read comp.os.linux.announce. It's a moderated group and the volume
is very low. Again, everyone should do this.

** Other questions and musings or chitchat of general interest
   to the Linux community:
   comp.os.linux.misc

Use comp.os.linux.misc. It's a catch- all group for things that
don't fit into the above categories. Again, read first,
post second.

** When should I post to comp.os.linux.development?

ONLY if your message has to do with the actual *development of
Linux itself*. Even then, if your message is a question and not input
on the development of Linux, make every effort to study the
FAQs first and make sure you can't answer it for yourself. This group
is intended for those developing Linux itself, not for development
of applications *using* Linux. Even if you think a question is
relevant to developers, TRY COMP.OS.LINUX.HELP FIRST.

Feel free to ask me for help in selecting the right groups.

** I disagree- I think you erred in sending this to me
   and it was posted to the right group after all.

Well, perhaps I did- I'm fallible (GASP!). If I was in error,
I apologize. I'm not in this for the ego points. If you
have input on these guidelines or feel they should be changed,
feel free to let me know.

Subject: Help ! Can not runup the SLS 1.0.3 bootdisk on ADAPTEC 1542 
Date: Fri, 19 Nov 1993 14:45:37 GMT

 I have SLS 1.0.3 (I believe, well at least it reported linux kernel 0.99 p12)
 and when booting with the boot disk from a machine with the Adaptec 1542
 controller I get the following messages, and then the machine hangs. Why ?

 Aha1542_out failed (1) Configuring Adaptec at IO:330 IRQ 11 DMA priority 5
 Aha1542_out aha1542.c interrupt received, but no mail
 SCSI0: Adaptec 1542
 Adaptec 1542 scsi: 1 hosts


 I might have skipped a few lines but none the less, at this point my machine
 just sits there. I have check my Adaptec BIOS and the above IO, and IRQ
 configurations are correct. Also with the BIOS settings, amongst other things
 I have the following enabled or disabled.

 Host Adapter BIOS                    enabled
 System boot                          disabled
 Extended bios                        disabled
 Bios support for more then 2 disk    enabled

 I remember seeing something about this. Please could someone refresh my
 memory on the subject. I have quickly browsed linux SCSI HOWTO but have
 not located the problem I am seeing, I guess I will read it better later
 on today but for now I thought this query might be quickest in resolving the
 problem. Mind you I have to confirm whether I am dealing with a straight
 Adaptec 1542 or Adaptec 1542 Revision C board.


 Thanks for any help.

  Has anyone ported the Berkeley Packet Filter to Linux yet?  If not,
you won't be able to talk to macs on Ethernet, though you will be able
to talk to Macs on Localtalk on the other side of a Shiva Fastpath,
assuming the Fastpath is using IPtalk, not Ethertalk, on the Ethernet
side.

  If the Packet Filter _has_ been ported (which it hadn't been the
last time someone asked this), it should be pretty easy to convince
CAP's EtherTalk drivers to compile on Linux (it should be the same as
the Ultrix code).

        Agreed.  Jus fooling around yesterday I did a VERY UN-Scientific
experiment (but it was fun!! :-)  I compiled some code I found
that computes PI up to 15K decimal digits and hard wired it to
compute to 5K digits.  I then ran it on my Linux Box (486/66 16MB)
and TIME gave me somewhere around 37 seconds real time.

I then ran it on a Sparc10 at school.  I was the only person logged in
(there isn't a news feed going to this machine and VERY little mail)
and it took about 1:25.  Since I figure all the NFS stuff on the
Sparc had it bogged down I decided to load down my Linux box
(logged in 4 virtual terminals, kept them busy editing files
and running TOP)  and wrote a script to run 20 concurrent iterations
of the computation.  I also ran 20 concurrent iterations on the
Sparc.  Final results;
                Fastest time under Linux ~12:39
                Fastest time under Sparc ~23 min
                Slowest time for each was approx fastest time + 2 min

Your mileage may vary, but I say I DEFINITELY have much more 
bang/$
