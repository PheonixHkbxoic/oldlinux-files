One can get from CMU a rather nice package install/deinstall utility
called 'depot' that does this rather elegantly. Unfortunately it
requires a bit of hand munging of most makefiles, as under it the
installation directory is not the same directory as the directory under
which the program will be run (each package is installed in a subtree of
its own; depot then merges packages into a single subtree for users to
use). As far as I know only perl has the right configuration options
that allow for separate architecture dependent/independent install dirs
and separate install/run subtrees...

        I meant that you shoud run iozone with reads and writes blocked in
something other than 512 bytes.  It does make a big difference as you get up
towards 8192 bytes.

        There was a second misconception about iozone posted here in someone
elses note.  This had to do with the notion that when you write you merely load
up the buffer cache, so that when you start reading again you are merely
reading back from the buffer cache again.  It is ESSENTIAL that you choose the
size of the file that iozone writes so that it is larger than the physical
memory on the machine you are running it on - the rule of thumb is that it
should be 2.5 times the physical memory available, and this will guarantee that
you are not measuring the speed of the buffer cache.

        The question of the size of the allocation blocks on the filesystem is
a different one entirely, although increasing this can also improve
performace.  This is not quite ready for people to start using but we are
getting real close now.

So e.g. the zip code 60327 designates an area in Frankfurt am Main,
Germany ? ;-)

The zip code alone is not sufficient. You need a country prefix like

and Principe.

And do _not_ assume anything about the zip code. I've heard that the
British have a blank space as significant part of the zip code
(like 4YX 5TG != 4YX5 TG). Be prepared to deal with such kind of
atrocities committed by the national post boards.

This entire thread has got to be the dumbest one to grace these newsgroups
in a long time.  The initial "features" list was obviously compiled by
someone who was using at least year-old data, since the answers for
both Linux and NT were wildly out of sync with reality.  In particular
the claims about disk space and memory image size seem to imply that the
person in question had never actually installed either operating system
or tried to run it.

I run NT both at work and at home, and have off and on for 8 months.  I
have also been running Linux at home for about 8-9 months, so I think I
know whereof I speak.  It is upsetting to see supporters of both
sides undermining their own credibility by offering only lies and name-calling
instead of fact-based debate.  Since I consider myself both an NT
supporter and a Linux supporter, I feel particularly embarrassed by it. :-)

Only a fool can believe any more that there will be a single winner in the 
OS wars, whether it be NT, OS/2, or any flavor of Unix.  Why not turn 
some of this energy away from making up ridiculous and ignorant claims 
about competing operating systems, and turn it instead toward making 
the system of your choice the best it can be.  The proof is in the 
pudding, after all.

The whole situation boils down to:
1) NT is a good operating system -- very late, and rather more 
   resource-hungry than I would have liked, but very powerful.  
2) Linux is also very impressive, particularly considering its
   "humble origins", and becoming moreso all the time.  Use whichever 
   fits the need.

My own personal wish would be to see a Linux subsystem for NT.  Then I could
run NT running Linux running Windows running DOS running a telnet session 
back to...  no, I'd better stop now.

Regrettably, that is entirely true and I agree with you. But the reverse is
also true. .advocacy groups are about, um, advocacy. I'd also like to point out
that I like some Microsoft products, and I don't actaully give a toss about
Bill Gates and whether or not the product I am using happens to be connected to
him in some way. I run Linux at home purely because I happen to prefer Unix,
and am not blessed with great wealth.

Perhaps Linuxers are a little bit pissed off about having a bunch of lies told

Yup. Again, all the .advocacy groups are guilty.

Well, shit, guess I better reinstall DOS now! Obviously that flaw outweighs all
the benefits that Linux brings.

NT is inferior to DOS - it doesn't have a command line.

Is this relevant? I think not. FYI, _I_ know what drag and drop is, I also like
it. Haven't got round to installing xview yet though.

Oh, and you say 'you cannot drag and drop between motif and Xaw apps'
It strikes me that I cannot drag and drop between NT and Xaw apps either -
what's your point?

Seems to me even when networking is absolutely perfect people are stil going to
point to a 0.1 kernel and say 'look! the networking's flaky!' Do we keep
picking faults in DOS 1.0? No.

        Zip codes might be a good idea, but simply have the
entries arranged by country, state and then towns.  This could be one 
simple "standard" for the world.

p.s. I'm going to discuss this idea with a friend and maybe we'll pick
up the states.  (Ofcourse I have to get my machine connected to
internet first though.)

How very neutral to use adjectives like 'moronic'.
The snide remarks are actually less common than you think... comp.unix.misc
has a lot more of them. Some of them exist, true, but not all think that
way. It's just because we get our work more easily done through unix and
find that many popular interfaces (including windows gui) are really inferior
when doing real work. But this is a matter of opinion.

But QIC-02 we do. Someone made a mistake. Does NT support 4 IDE disks?
And how easily do you adjust a microsoft driver to do something like that?
With no source?

The comparison was posted to comp.os.linux.misc. If that's not our

any ms groups.

Hmmmm, what were you saying about snide remarks???
And sheep, lynch mob and fanatic mentality? When someone tries to correct
some facts in a posting, you jump on us for posting vulgar flames?
An OBJECTIVE comparison? The only mistake in the corrections (about 80%
of the items were corrected) was QIC-80.

The OS has been here. The development is open, and free. You can
give a hand. With NT, you eat what the MS engineers gave you.
Also, it has been mentioned elsewhere that your first items:
loadable device drivers, drag&drop and dosemu are already there.
WINE (wabi) is coming along, but there I can SEE the development,
estimate when it will be ready. None of the MS delays. I can even
get the code and help if I wanted.

Loadable device drivers, as I said, are there.
But does DOS do two DOS apps next to each other? 
What about virtual consoles? Long filenames? 
This is just like the comments about NT not having a command-line interface.
Misinformation and fanaticity.

What's your point? Should I really buy NT so I can drag and drop some
funny items between some applications? Are you really serious?

This is true. But most people are not so interested in having a midi

Tell me: what does NT do?

What flaky file system? Xiafs has given me zero serious trouble.
No lost files, nothing. Only one time was there a hint of something, but
that was patchlevels and eons ago: some blocks were lost but a file system
check found them again promptly and I've heard nothing since.
Two machines, heavy use more than half a year.

What a very objective and neutral statement!!! I commend you on maintaining
that friendly and neutral attitude throughout your article.
Have you ever run linux? If not, what do you know about it?

I don't know who started it, whether it was a ms'er or linuxer or someone
making an intentional flamebait... but this has been coming for a long time.

Next time, please don't say that you're neutral when you aren't. Please?
I admit right now to being non-neutral.
