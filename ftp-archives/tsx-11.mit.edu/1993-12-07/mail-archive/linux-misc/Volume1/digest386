You didn't mention that LILO overrides this value, so the real way to
do this if you boot with LILO (who doesn't?) is to specify the desired
mode in your config file.  Of course, if you don't specify it in the
LILO config, perhaps it still uses this?

Linux supports both the Etherlink II and III cards.
Linux currently does not support Novel Netware, though there
are a team of people, I understand, who are interested in
developing same.

Before anyone takes this advice let me point out that there are such things
as compilation copyrights (which I can get for taking your Linux and adding
a whole bunch of things to it), copyrights for printed materials that may 
come with the disc, etc.

Don't go giving anybody else's work unless you are sure what you can legally
give away.

YES! Bas is up and running again (using a smaller hardrdive and an Ygdr***
CD-ROM). In fact, ftape 0.9.7 is on tsx-11, sunsite, and nic.funet.fi.
ftape 0.9.7 contains patches relative to pl14. IT WILL ONLY WORK WITH pl14!!!
- the ftape driver simply *checks* the kernel to find out if it's pl14 or not!
If you got the pl14a kernel, i've got a (dead simple) patch to cure the
problem.

Other Q's can be directed to me directly,

 I have a cirrus logic 5426 w/1 meg and was following the discussion on
getting it to work at 1024 X 768. Right now, when I enter that mode, it
looks like its losing the sync. Whats the solution? (I'm using a CTX 13"
monitor)

I agree, HTML is very nice and _easy_ to write. I believe it takes a
lot more training to write a texinfo-manual than to write a
corresponding HTML-document. It only takes some conventions,
ie. always put in
   <a name=see_also><h2>See also</h2>
etc.

I haven't looked at LDP's efforts. This isn't intended to slouch that
work.

First off, please direct any general GNU Public License discussions to 
the appropriate newsgroup(s).  I feel that this is still relatively Linux
oriented now, but gnu.misc.discuss might be more appropriate for follow-ups.

I wouldn't presume to know anything about actual law, but the intent of
GPL as I understand it is to prevent restrictive derivations of GPL'd work
such as compilation copyrights other than GPL for Linux (which was under
GPL still the last time I heard).  To the letter your hypothetical Linux
distribution recipients could redistribute the GPL'd Linux portions of your
release, and I believe that the spirit of the GPL would require your own
additions to be equally accessable.

Good advice in any case--I just hope people dig deeper where they aren't 
positive, rather than simply avoiding the issue by not distributing.

Don't expect any speedup for dump SVGA cards. There is no new speedup code
for Trident/ET4000 and others.
