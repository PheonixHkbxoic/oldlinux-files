        I'm looking in to buying an ATI Ultra Pro with 2M, but have heard that
the card requires a memory aperture to run correctly which causes problems when
run on machines with over 16M of ram.  I know this can be fixed under DOS 
(isn't messing with hardware fun?), but I was wondering if this caused any 
problems under Linux?  

Thanks in advance.

        Eve;

   Does your driver & host adapter work under DOS?? That's always a
good check, though with the ST01 _under_DOS_ it won't recognise some
drivers. My ST01 won't work w/ my Quantum under DOS, but will under
Linux. 

   Your drive _might_ need to be re low-level formated. I know it
sounds weird, but a friend of mine as both an ST01 and an adaptec-1542
and when he moves his drive from one to the other he has to re
low-level format it.  I've not a clue why, but it works fine after
that. This is assuming that your drive does infact work, I've got a
drive with a half-fried controller chip. I'll only do some, but not
all, of the SCSI commands.

As long as *distributors* are interested in the Consortium, that's
good enough for me. I don't suppose that the so-called core
development group has any plans of cornering the distribution
channels, do they?

Who here is really against quality assurance? Why?

Nifty: it looks like I don't have to buy an accelerated video
card, at least not as soon as I thought. My lowly Trident 8900C
1 meg SVGA card is actually fast enough. Jump scrolling in Xterms
is really well done.

I was used to using the video card in OS/2 2.1, and command line
windows would take AGES to scroll; it was pathetic. On another Linux
machine with an ATI in Xfree 1.3, performance wass pretty shabby,
and I thought my Trident would be even worse. But it's OK, certainly
*useable*, which I wasnt expecting. (btw, I've never run Xfree
on this setup before, so I don't know what 1.3 would have been
like).

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

AA>I know that there are problems on some notebooks but I don't know
AA>if my notebook is among these. Is a 120Mb HD enough for linux as

Does the IBM Thinkpay 350 use MicroChannel Based Architecture? If it does
then you could run into problems as Linux doesn't support MCA as far as I
know - at least the Yggdrasil Fall 93 version doesn't. 120 Mb I've found
is a good size partition. I'm only running a 245 Mb harddrive with 122 Mb
for MsDos and 122 for Linux. This gets on heaps of stuff as well as a
reasonable swap file. I've cut my swapfile down to 4 Mb as I've 8 Mb of
Ram and I've found no problmems with running things like Xwindows etc.

What brand of Linux are you intending to run? I'ld definitely recommend
the Yggdrasil version. It comes on a Cdrom with a pile of software. If you
do the full install including source code its a full 680 Mb but otherwise
you can do a full executable install which occupies 245 Mb or do like
myself with the runtime which is approximately 35 Mb and then just add the
other stuff like UUCP etc. I've still got 5 Mb free after doing this and
theres a pile there to work with. If you've a Cdrom you can just do a
Cd-Based install which requires 2 Mb of Harddrive space and some for a
swapfile but it'ld be so slow its not funny. They say SLS is pretty good
but I haven't had a look at it yet. Linux is definitely better than SCO
Unix. You get alot more for your money.

I don't think it is possible. I tried this for a while myself and the only
way I could get it to work was by running the Fdisk under each operating
system whenever you wanted to change to the other one. Not what I'ld call
a very easy and cooperative system. I got this going in the end just by
using Linux as the Boot manager. Its a hell of alot easier and Linux
recognises quite a large variety of filing systems including HPFS. Good
luck.
