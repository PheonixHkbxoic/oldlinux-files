I think, you should leave it in because most of the unix boxes I've
seen show exacly this behavior. How about a warning message which tells
the user something like 'WARNING: this job will be executed tomorrow at 12:00' ?
Btw. I like your at(1); nice program

In short, this critic of SXPC must confess that it is useful.

My previous, less formalized observations were made with
respect to sxpc-0.9, but this more objective look made use
of sxpc-1.01, which I believe has benefitted from some
enhancements.

For those who want the executive summary, below (from worst to
best) are what I assess to be the advantages of using various
compression techniques with X11.

                                      V.42bis:  84% speedup
                             Sxpc compression: 109% speedup
                   V.42bis + Term compression: 123% speedup
              Term compression (i.e., txconn): 128% speedup
V.42bis + Term compression + Sxpc compression: 146% speedup
          Term compression + Sxpc compression: 147% speedup
                   V.42bis + Sxpc compression: 148% speedup

In brief, it is counterproductive to use TERM compression along
with V.42bis compression, presumably because they are based on
the same algorithm.  Therefore, if you use TERM compression (without
SXPC), you should see a 2% speedup by disabling V.42bis.

If your modem doesn't have V.42bis compression, then you are well
served by using a combination of SXPC and TERM compression.

If you do have a modem with V.42bis compression, you should see a
speedup of about 9% by using SXPC in conjunction with V.42bis, over
using TERM compression alone.
 

THE DETAILS:

This analysis assumes that the bottleneck lies in the telephone
(modem-to-modem) connection, and it is therefore beneficial to
reduce the number of bytes carried over that link.

Two tests were run:
                    1) the emacs test consisted of running an
emacs 19.16.1 X client on a remote computer, using the file sxpc.c
as the file to be edited.  Ctrl-L was then hit 5 times to refresh
the screen.        
                    2) the xfig test consisted of running Xfig 2.1.7a
as an X client on a remote computer, initially loading the file
dresser.fig, and pressing each of the 12 edit mode buttons along
the lefthand side before quitting.

The data was collected by doing nothing more than logging in, performing
these operations, and logging out.  Subsequently, the link status report
information provided by the modem was used to determine the number
of bytes transferred.

XFree86-1.3 was in use on the local computer which was running
Linux alpha-0.99pl13h, the remote host was a Sun running SunOS 4.1.3.
Xauth was not run, so as to ease the tedium of collecting the data.
TERM refers to the term108 package, and SXPC refers to sxpc-1.01.

Certain precautions were taken to ensure that results weren't
adversely effected.  First, noise logs were kept on both sides
of the connection and were examined to make sure that no more
than 10 bytes were discarded by TERM.  Characters such as those
from the TERM escape sequence typically find their way into the
noise log.  Second, such things as fortune were eliminated from
.logout (I thought of that only after getting one of those
Dave Berry articles, which I enjoyed nonetheless).

A negligible number (22) of additional characters were typed when
invoking SXPC over TERM.  For SXPC the required sequence transmitted
was "setenv DISPLAY `sxpc remote pollux:0`;tredir 4000 4000" while
for TERM the sequence was limited to "setenv DISPLAY `hostname``txconn`".

The numbers shown below from the modem link status reports include
the following terms, defined by ZyXEL as follows:

 Chars - data characters transmitted between DTE (computer/terminal)
         and modem.

 Octet - Data bytes transmitted between the modems, handled by error
         control protocol, may be compressed data.  Data compression
         efficiency may be seen from the ratio of chars count to
         octets count.

For the executive summary, I considered only the octets sent and
received.  As a baseline, I added the octets sent and received for
each of the 2 tests, with V.42bis disabled, TERM compression disabled,
and using txconn.  Combinations of compression techniques were assessed
using the same numbers, but for the appropriate algorithms in use.

Below are the raw link data reports.  Preceding each is a line indicating
the conditions under which the data were gathered, using the following
abbreviations:

V.42 = V.42 (no modem compression)
V.42b = V.42bis (modem compression)

C = term compression in effect
NC = term compression NOT in effect

T = using txconn
S = using sxpc-1.1

E = emacs test
X = xfig test


So, for instance, a connection in which V.42bis modem compression is
disabled, TERM compression is on, txconn is used, and the test run is
the xfig test would be denoted as "V.42bis/C/T/X".

It can be noted that for the Chars Sent / Chars Received data, the
presence or absence of V.42bis should make no difference, and as
measured it made very little difference.  The speedups as measured
by the Chars Sent / Chars Received data is somewhat more impressive
than that given in the executive summary, but with the ordering
(SXPC, TERM, SXPC+TERM) preserved.

In short, while the TERM and V.42bis algorithms are the same, and
nothing is gained by employing both, the SXPC algorithm shares
a symbiotic relationship with either V.42bis or TERM compression
and should be used in conjunction with one or the other.

Holy Toledo,

I've been having exactly the same kind of problem with
a Hyundai 2400 baud modem and both an Orchid and a Tseng
ET4000/W32. Well, not exactly the same, in my case the modem
will sometimes lock up after playing games under MS-DOS
and under Linux X, communication sometimes ceases abruptly
and the modem disappears until a hard reset!

Looks like it's worthwhile to do a little port shuffling,
even though I'd practically given up on the sucker.
Thanx pal! Sorry that I cannot help with your original
problem (I suppose you have though about moving your
current com1/2 into com3/4? Not possible on your system)

        Peter

When you take a look at /etc/lilo/config, you find lines like
(sorry, if this is only 90% exact, I am not answering from a
Linux box):

image = /vmlinuz
    <some more information, like vga mode>
other = dos
    <information about the dos partiton>

Now, simply put the dos part first.

First of all, good job!!!  I thought this was a wonderful idea so I
quickly d/l zlibc and installed it.

Problem: emacs info mode refuses to load gzipped files.  Something
about the naming confuses it.  I tried hacking info.el but to no
avail.  Any ideas??

Why is the most important language compiler for my system?
What is it?

How about a few lines of description?

While you are at it you could also post the correct internet address to ftp
from and the exact path and files to which are needed for those of us who
have to ftp over a mail server.

      I'm planning to install a Japanese TeX/LaTeX package on my Linux PC.
      Before I invest lots of time to compile and install or get megabytes
      of software from the JE package I would like know
      .
      .
      1. Which of the two packages (NTT-jtex or ASCII-jtex) is better?
      2. Does any of the two packages support top to bottom/right to left
         writing?

        I'm not sure what you mean by "better", but
   ASCII-jtex with it's pTeX extension (included in the
   jtex1.7 package.  You might want to get the
   pTeX-JIS-patch too.) supports top->bottom writing.
        The main differences between the two are;
           1. NTT-jTeX supports newJIS, whereas ASCII-jTeX,
              in it's original form (without the
              pTeX-JIS-patch) supports only shift-JIS and
              EUC kanji-codes.
           2. NTT-jTeX requires font files for japanese
              characters too, and these are available (no,
              they're NOT free) from Dainippon Printing.
              There may be some free fonts around
              somewhere; I'm not sure.  ASCII-jTeX requires
              only the font-metric files, so if your
              printer/previewer/whatever has it's own
              kanji-char-set, this saves a lot of disk

I'm not sure this is actually correct.  I believe that no TeX-based system
needs fonts.  TeX pays no attention to the characters themselves, only
their sizes (and other spacing information) which comes from the font
metric files.  In this respect, both versions of JTeX are equivalent.

But of course when you want to actually PRINT anything (or indeed preview
it), something somewhere actually has to have some fonts.  And this is
possibly the heart of the matter.  When I was setting up JTeX under 386
BSD, it appeared to be the case that ASCII JTeX was only usable if I bought
the fonts from Dai Nippon, which weighed in at a cool Y90 000, which I
decided was too much to spend for just occasional domestic use.

In contrast, NTT JTeX will work with a set of fonts which is freely
available (although I'm afraid I don't actually remember where I got
them---utsun I think) from (Hideki?) Watanabe, together with a version of
Latex (jawatex).  The fonts come as a bitmap font, plus a program to
extract something from the bitmap that meta-font can work on, plus some
scripts to drive this chain to produce usable fonts in a number of sizes.
Turn your CPU loose (it took my 33MHz '486 a week--->150 hours!) and you'll
end up with a font family which Ghostscript can eat and direct to a
printer---mine happily drives a deskjet or laserjet emulation to produce
reasonable quality output.

Now, it is possible that I missed something---that there is some other font
available without fee, or some such.... would anyone care to enlighten me?
I'll probably be upgrading my BSD soon, so I could change at this point...

Robert.
