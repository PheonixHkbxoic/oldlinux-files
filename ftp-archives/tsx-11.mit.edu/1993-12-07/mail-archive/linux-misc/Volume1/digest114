There is a PC virtual machine for running MS-DOS and applications
("dosemu"), but using DMA and interrupts is Right Out.  While it's
possible to translate an IRQ into a user-level signal, that won't be
fast enough for the kind of application you are talking about.  And
there are major difficulties dealing with general DMA in the
user-level address space of 'dosemu'.

You can write a Linux device driver, and then hack that into the PC
virtual machine, but once you start you'll probably end up rewriting
your entire application in Linux.

It's too much to expect to be able to run an arbitrary MS-DOS device
driver under Linux, or any real OS.  You have to deal with virtual to
physical page mappings, physically contiguous pages, DMA boundaries
and limits (64K, 128K, 16M), wiring down pages, and a slew of other
issues just to make DMA work.  Some device drivers also depend upon
software timing loops, being able to turn off interrupts, and
accurate, unimpeded access to the system timer chip.  None of these
are compatible with the scheduling fairness and protection expected of
a general purpose operating system.

First of all, you'll probably want to change your 3c503 to use shared
memory.  The jumper is shared with the boot PROM, so you may have
missed it.

What does this have to do with the 3c503 probe?  Well, the probe for
a 3c503 in programmed-I/O mode was turned off in a panic reaction to
the general device driver probe explosion.  (The 3c503 shared memory
probe is a safe read from memory, rather than a scan through I/O
space.)  The new pl13 kernel has a I/O port registrar that makes I/O
space probes safer, and the programmed-I/O 3c503 probe has been
re-enabled.   You still shouldn't use the programmed-I/O mode though,
it's noticeably slower.  It's there only for compatibility (long story
omitted).

This means the MCC people fixed the ethercard IRQ at 15 when they made
the kernel -- a truly evil thing.  The 3c503 can only use IRQ{5, 2/9, 3, 4,}. 
The autoIRQ code should work with everything but the non-EEPROM 80*3.

The best thing you can do is to give them "screen" as their login shell.

Screen is able to give you multiuser terminals (aka "spying" or "giving
users a hand" :-), map terminal types, have multiple virtual terminals,
among others.

The only thing you need will be more swap space because users tend to
leave their screen sessions logged in as soon as they figure out the
heap of neat things screen can do for them. ;-)

Can we stop the child-like reactions?

The Linux crowd can only benefit from what NT has to offer.  A smart
person looks at both the strengths and weaknesses of the competition
and works to improve themselves from this analysis.  Yes we may all
secretly wish that Linux will spring up from out of the underground
taking the computer communities by storm causing them to throw away
and divorce MicroNT in droves! Don't hold your breath.....

Better to learn what makes their product so desireable that you would
want it in Linux, and then incorporate it into our true free and open 
Linux society.  Because the development of the Linux products is not
for monetary reasons, but rather for the free giving to human-kind,
no monolithic software company (the evil empire) can stand up to 
the sincerity of an such an open system.  

My wish, is that the Universal OS becomes completely non-proprietary.

Just a few years ago everyone said the same about IBM. "We all
know there systems suck, but IBM mainframes will be the main
systems forever.". If only I had the money back them to buy
options on IBM stock going down :)
If I get $1K that I don't know what to do with its definitly
going into microsoft stock options. Microsoft is going to go
the way of IBM or maybe worse.

So where do we ge the $100Million for a marketting campaign? No one
has even seen NT yet and its popular. It could be the worst OS on the
planet and it wouldn't matter, microsoft has the money to sell anything,
they could even sell used cat litter......
I'd rather program used cat litter than a microsoft OS.

I have the same problems on 3 machines (2*486 and 1*386) when I 
tried to boot from the original 3,5" bootdisk in driva A. The 
loading stops after the message "Detecting soundcard: AdLib

There is something of a fallacy here.  You seem to be arguing that
because when something is free you shouldn't demand to have exactly
what you want (true) therefore whatever you're provided with must be
good (false).

The whole problem, as those of us that dislike SLS see it, is that SLS
is *not* great.  If it were great I wouldn't end up cursing every time
I have to work with it.  I often have no control over what is
installed by someone I go and help with their Linux system, and I
certainly have no control over what people install before they post
about their problems to comp.os.linux.help.

Note that I'm not demanding that Peter produce something better.
However I am saying that the kind of `blind gratitude' mentality is
unlikely to produce better results in the future.  I'm glad to see the
appearance on the scene of the new Debian release, under construction.

In the meantime I will continue to recommend in the strongest possible
terms that anybody considering using SLS install MCC instead and untar
the X tree on top of it themselves - it will be easier, and the result
will be better.

Subject: SIGSEGVs, FS reliability, kernel/fs version ... connection?
Date: Wed, 8 Sep 1993 04:13:01 GMT

Until recently, I was running 0.99 PL6 and was using the minix filesystem.
Some of y'all may recall a post a while back about problems I was having
with regular files suddenly becoming directories (or so the FS thought),
data being trashed, and so on.  When I upgraded to 0.99 PL9 and started
using the ext2 filesystem instead, these problems completely vanished.  I
can now compile the kernel without a single SIGSEGV (I did have one
seg-fault/core dump, but I suspect that was caused by something else).
Before, I often had to re-start the compile on a new kernel at least 5 or
6 times....

I'm pretty sure it isn't the filesystem version, because someone recently
posted about how they were having the same problems, but with the ext2 fs.
I'm also pretty sure it isn't the kernel, because this same person was
using 0.99 PL12, so you'd think if it went away in PL9, it wouldn't be too
likely to suddenly reappear in PL12 (though I do seem to recall having a
SIGSEGV-free OS when I was on some patchlevel of 0.98).

The only other thing I changed when I made that conversion (which, as I
said, is when the problems went away) was the filesystem structure.  I
moved the news spool (/usr/spool/news) to its own partition (/newsspool)
and let a symbolic link point to it.

Does anyone have any idea what could be going on here?  I can see how moving
the news spool off to its own partition could help reduce the filesystem
corruption...after all, if it's the partition that's getting the cr*p beaten
out of it every day, it's the most likely to see a failure.  Btw, I should
mention here that I've stopped seeing errors in my news spool dirs, too....
Anyways, what I can't see is how this would eliminate (not reduce,
eliminate) the SIGSEGV problems.

Anyone have any thoughts on this?  Thanks,
   --jim

There has been some discussion about IEEE style arithmetic on the GCC
activists channel. It might be worth directing your question to that
group.

The main problem is the lack of a standard in this area. The various
workstation manufacturers appear to have chosen their own conventions
and there is rightly a resistance in the Linux community to adopting any
of these non-standard approaches.

The Numerical C Extensions Group (NCEG) of ANSI (formally X3J11.1)
is examining a number of topics related to floating point operations
in C and their work is intended to lead to a standard. Of particular
interest is their document X3J11.1/93-001 "Floating-Point C Extensions"
which is summarised by P J Plauger in the September issue of "The C
Users Journal". Of interest to you may be their recommendation of a
function 'isnan()' and a number of new relational and equality operators.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently

from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
