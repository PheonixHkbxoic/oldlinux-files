Shame! Shame! Now I know that you didn't even look at the FAQ because
the linux-activists information is right there in part 1. The FAQ can
be obtained from sunsite.unc.edu in the directory /pub/Linux/docs/faqs
and has the answer to your question and many others.

I didn't pay much attention to this on the mailing list, but I have
thought about this for a while and have a few points.

1.  IMHO, Linux is not really meant for inexperienced users.  Just
about everything for it is still ALPHA or BETA and is, to an extent,
crash prone.

2.  Who will have the time and resources to fully test a distribution?
The people doing this would more or less need a spare PC to do
everything.

3.  I don't really think the consortium would have much power.

I have said this many times before, and I am going to repeat myself.
All the distributions are too damn big.  They try to install too much
at once.  What is needed is a good _base_ package with what is needed
to have a useable system.  I think the following would be sufficient:
        The kernel
        Bash
        The GNU fileutils
        The GNU shellutils
        The GNU textutils
        The GNU diffutils
        Emacs
        The grep family
        GCC, libc, make, patch, m4, et al.
        Gawk
        Groff
        Gzip
        Perl
        Sed
        Tar
        The net-2 (network, that is) tree
        Kermit
        And the linux specific /etc and /bin utils

And I probably missed a few things.  Trying to include all the
compilers/interpreters, TeX, X, the X contrib, etc. is really stupid.
After people can add what they need.  The days of porting software is
gone; most things just need 'make' or some trivial changes.  I
compiled almost all of the above without any problems (perl gave me
trouble).  A lot of the BSD NET-2 tree compiles without trouble once
you install pmake.  The really big stuff (XFree86, Emacs, GCC, TeX) is
already compiled and ususally just needs 'tar xvfz'.  If people would
actually take some time and try to understand their system and install
what they need instead of grabbing every new toy, then there would be
fewer problems...

Subject: lpd problem solved
Date: 28 Nov 93 23:16:57 GMT

I've seen many complaints that lpd wont stay active.  At least on my system
the problem was solved by creating the directory /usr/spool/lpd

lpd aparently wanted to create a lock file 'lpd.lock' there and if the
directory didnt exist he died.

I made this discovery by looking in /var/logs/notice (this is where
syslogd puts his messages) there were many complaints from lpd that
then file /usr/spool/lpd/lpd.lock didnt exist, also several complaints
that a filter i had specified in /etc/printcap didnt exist either.

check /etc/syslog.conf for where syslogd writes output, it may be different
than
mine

hope this helps.

Gee, thanks for biasing your "results" by only including stuff that your

Folks, INCLUDE THE ENTIRE RESULTS, PLEASE!

Since yesterday I run slackware 1.1.(0).

What can I do to tell my deskjet to print out ordinary ascii-text?

What do I have to write into my printcap?

At the moment lpr prints out two blank pages, sometimes only

Genoa recently announced a new SVGA card called the Phantom 8900VL,
based on the ET4000/W32i chip.  It is supposedly a *very* fast card.
(check out the marketing blurb, below).

Can anyone tell me if XFree86 supports this card?
Is there anyone out there that is using one of these under Linux?

It is not our intention to 'fully test' the distribution. As far as I

to make disapproval easy. Wrong links, wrong permissions, programs
that don't work at all, that are not correctly set up etc.

It is not intended to. However, I think the need that it targets is a

"add what they need". If the CD-ROM they bough don't work properly,

If you get XFree86-1.3 binary for Linux, then PEX is already included.
If you downloaded XFree86-2.0, you need to re-make server to include PEX.
All informations are in the docs of XFree86.  Get them first.

Hello,

somehow I am not able to pass options to the MS-DOS filesystem. I
specify them in fstab or with the -o option to mount, but in function
parse_options() in ./fs/msdos/inode.c the options argument always is
empty.

I think to remember that some patchlevels ago of the kernel I could
pass options to the MS-DOS filesystem.

Does anyone know what is wrong or if the whole support for options was
removed?
