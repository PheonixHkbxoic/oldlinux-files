No.  The way it works is programs compiled with version 4.x of libc 
will work with libc 4.y as long as y>=x.  If y<x, then the binary won't 
work until you upgrade to libc 4.x or higher.

Eventually, linux may move to ELF format binaries - but it will keep the 
ability to run the old a.out format binaries as well, I've been told.

>Has anyone ever checked if new binaries work on older kernel releases?  

binaries are usually dependent on your version of libc (current is 
libc4.4.1, 4.4.2 is in alpha).  Unless your binary is something like the 
kmem-based ps, or some of the new network code, it doesn't depend on 
kernel version.

>Do the archive sites even keep around older version very long?

Depends on the archive site, the number of old versions, and the disk 
space available.  Most of the time, you don't want old binaries anyhow - 
they're based on old source.  :-)

>There are lots of people using Linux, but which version is used the most?

I suspect that almost all of the Linux community is running a kernel of
version .99 pl6 or higher, with most people running pl9, 10, 12+small,
or 13a (a=alpha).

Binaries produced now, will work in the future, until/unless we get to
libc5.x, which indicates a _major_ change in libc.

You'd want to make the program dynamically-linked, anyhow.  it'd be 
smaller.

Hope this helps!

Thinking of Computer Algebra Systems that have been ported to Linux the
following come to my mind:

1) MuPAD from the University of Paderborn
   You can get it from: Host: ftp.uni-paderborn.de
                        Dir:  /unix/MuPAD/UNIX
   Claims to have a nice graphical user interface (might be interesting for
   Mathematica fans).
   I have never used it, so I can't compare it with Mathematica.

2) SACLIB from RISC-Linz
   You can get it from: Host: ftp.risc.uni-linz.ac.at
                        Dir:  /pub/saclib
   If you want to program computer algebra algorithms instead of just using
   them, this library of C functions is probably the right thing for you.

I would be interested to hear from other people, who are using Computer Algebra
systems under Linux, what experiences they have made.

I hope that helps a bit,

Hello,
        Could someone please tell me if there is any SLIP software
that can be used with 0.99.pl9 WITHOUT patching the kernel and upping
to "NET-2."
        Also I've been to tsx and sunsite and see kernel upgrade patches
from every version to every version EXCEPT from 99.pl9 to 10 or 11.
        I really need this SLIP or PPP up and running but cannot afford
to reinstall.
        I would really appreciate any input on the best way todo this.

1) As Linux is ported to other hardware (Like 680x0, MIPS, etc),
binaries for that platform will not work on i386, and vice versa
2) Sometimes, features are added to Linux and to the libraries.  When
this happens, programs compiled using the new features will of course
not work on older kernels.  Furthermore, programs compiled using
currently shared libraries will not work on previous shared libraries.

I am not sure what "binaries are not compatible" means in this
context.  "compatible" requires a prepositional phrase which is
missing here...

Providing statically linked binaries is perhaps best if you want to
make sure that your executable can work on the oldest kernel possible.
However, I think that anyone writing a commercial app should start
with the current kernel and current libraries, as it takes a while to
move a product through to distribution, and most people are willing to
upgrade their kernel if an app requires it.

   Has anyone ever checked if new binaries work on older kernel releases?  

It's not a thing you can check, in general.  If you recompile a
program that worked on a previous release with a new release, it is
likely to still work on the previous release, assuming that you don't
change to older libraries.

   Do the archive sites even keep around older version very long?

No.

   There are lots of people using Linux, but which version is used the most?

Doesn't matter too much.  Most people keep within a few revisions, and
this is enough.  When it starts causing trouble, upgrade.

   Once commercial products are being sold, doesn't this create a lot
   of pressure to make sure old binaries still work and constrain future progress.

No.  Old binaries keep working on new systems, with very few
exceptions.  It's putting *new* programs in *old* systems that *can*
cuase trouble.  (Just like new wine in old wineskins -- such a shame
that no one ever reads the Bible any more... :-)

   Is anyone responsible for maintaining binary compatibility?

No one is "responsible", in the sense that they are paid to do a job
and required to do it or they are fired.  However, the people who
maintain gcc and the libraries have done a bang-up job at this, and I
applaud them.

   I can see this being a problem for proprietary products like SimCity.

There is no problem, as far as I can see, with just providing a
dynamically linked version of their executable.  That's what everyone
else does.

   The cost of commercial products for Linux just might be /more/ expensive
   than DOS or SCO if supporting/maintaining them is more time consuming.

It should not be more time-consuming.  The only significant
conceivable problem is trying to make the executables work on old
systems with old libs and old kernels, and I don't think it is worth
it.  Just compile with the latest libs, and require that people use
those or later libs to run the program, and advertise that
requirement.

In other words, old binaries should work with a new Linux kernel/libs,
but not the other way around. If I compile something using libc-4.4.2, I
should not expect it to work on libc-4.4.1 (in most cases the loader will
complain and tell you that the library versions are incompatible.) 

However, if I compile something using libc-4.4.1, it should work using
libc-4.4.2. In several rare instances changes were made to the Linux system
which broke old binaries under a new kernel or libs. As far as I know,
this has not happened recently. 

One solution to this pronblem is to statically link your binaries. Another
solution is to simply link your binaries against and older, stable version
of the shared libraries which everyone almost certainly has installed.

>>   Has anyone ever checked if new binaries work on older kernel releases?  

Generally, as long as the system-call interface is the same (and it does
not change often), then yes, they should work. The real sticking point is
usually the shared library version. As long as someone has the newest
shared libs, then you have no problem.

What is the Bible? And where can I get some? :)

I agree with this as well. Providing dynamically-linked commercial
binaries should be no problem. If you are paranoid, just statically link
your binary, and provide a link kit for someone to roll their own 
dynamically-linked binary.

Unlike MS-DOS, Linux does not strive to always emulate older versions of
the system. While backwards-compatibility of kernels is always desirable,
Linux is undergoing constant development. Otherwise, I would be sitting
here watching an endless stream of "AAAA....BBBB....AAAA....". :)

   I've acquired an AST CC-432 4 port serial board. I bought it
   because I recalled AST boards were Linux-friendly.

   But I checked the HARDWARE file and saw no mention of it, except
   indirectly.

   1) What do I have to do (if anything) to my kernel (99.12)?
   2) How should I configure the board's switches?
   3) This board was OEM'ed as an Olivetti product {Anyone need 286-Xenix
   installation instructions in German, French or Italian;-?} Does anyone
   have the AST doc's I could get copies of parts of?

It'll just work.  (It helps that I, as the serial driver maintainer,
*own* two AST CC-432 Fourport serial boards.  :-)  

Depending on whether you have the board set up to use ports 0x1A0-1BF,
or ports 0x2A0-2BF, they will appear as /dev/{cua,ttyS}{4,5,6,7} or
/dev/{cua,ttyS}{8,9,10,11}.

The xlock that comes with the SLS Linux distribution is broken; it

to getPassword() in xlock.c to get it to use getspnam().

Sort of.  0.99.9 and 0.99.12 are mostly compatible, although there are a few
differences between them (which SimCity isn't very likely to stumble into,
IMHO).  In any case, going for 0.99.10+ compatibility is a safe bet.

Not entirely true.  There have been changes that affected many binaries, but
the most recent changes affected only network code --- which needed it.
Desperately.  The rest of the standard C library is fairly safe, until/unless
we switch to ELF binaries --- which won't be any time soon.

>There are lots of people using Linux, but which version is used the most?

0.99.9 and 0.99.12, depending on how bleeding-edge you are or how much you
need networking :-)

Dynamic linking pretty much solves both the kernel problem (though not
completely) and this one.

While Mathematica might not be available, you can always try calc, the
gnu emacs calculator. No, I'm serious! It's sometimes described as "The
Poor Man's Mathematica", and that isn't far off. It can do a surprising
number of things, including symbolic algebra and calculus, linear
algebra, graphing (with gnuplot), statistics, and more.

It does have its drawbacks. It's in elisp, so it's not a speed wonder.
But hey, it's free, it's programmable, and if you get desperate you can
hack the source.

Available from the elisp archive somewhere under
archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive.
