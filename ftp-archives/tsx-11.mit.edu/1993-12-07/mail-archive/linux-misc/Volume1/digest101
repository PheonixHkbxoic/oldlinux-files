I was wondering if anyone is planning or has already implemented functions
similar to the nan functions in the IEEE floating point library used on
SUN archetectures? I have quite a bit of library code using these functions
and I wanted to port them to Linux. Is there an alternative to these functions
if they don't exist anywhere else?

 I would make sure that you don't have the jumper set on your motherboard
for coprocessor support.
 Some motherboards like mine have this jumper, and if you don't have
an actual coprocessor installed, Linux won't boot into protected mode.

Nicholas Vargish <vargish@sura.net> asks if there is interest in 
forming a Linux User Group in the DC area.  If there is an 
interest, it may be that there is also an unusual oppertunity to 
do so.

If there is interest in forming a Linux User Group in the
Baltimore-Washington DC area (Md., Va., WVa., ...) it might be
worthwhile to consider forming it as a Special Interest Group of
the Capital PC User Group (CPCUG).

Founded in 1982, the CPCUG has almost 5000 members, is a
501(c)(3) scientific and educational organization (ie. it is a
non profit organization contributions to which are
tax-deductible) that is run by volunteers.  The CPCUG has an
infrastructure that provides excellent support for its Special
Interest Groups (SIGs) and provides an opportunity for its SIGs
to make their presence felt by a substantial segment of the local
computer community and of the local community as a whole.

The steps needed to form a CPCUG Linux SIG are simple:

  1.  A SIG Chairman, who must be a member of the CPCUG, must be      
      chosen (this may well be whoever volunteers for the job).

  2.  A SIG becomes a recognized unit within the CPCUG when:

      a.  A meeting is held to discuss the formation of the SIG. 
          All interested parties are invited.  (In my opinion a
          virtual meeting via the Internet might meet this
          requirement.)

      b.  The following documentation is presented to the Board
          of Directors:

          1.  A SIG charter that includes:

              a.  An outline of the purposes, interests, and
                  activities of the proposed SIG.

              b.  An identification of the SIG chairman.

              c.  An estimate and analysis of any expenses or
                  anticipated revenue associated with the
                  activities of the SIG.

          2.  A description of the SIG for the CPCUG newsletter.

          3.  The Board of Directors votes and formally
              recognizes the SIG.  (Current practice is to grant
              provisional recognition for a period of about three
              months before final recognition.)

  3.  In order for a SIG to maintain its status as a recognized
      SIG and keep its membership on the board of directors, the
      following are required:

      a.  The SIG chairman must submit quarterly SIG membership
          rosters.

      b.  The SIG chairman or his representative must attend, as
          a minimum, seven of the Board meetings in the course of
          a year.  (The board normally meets monthly.)

      c.  The SIG must perform one of the following functions
          during the course of a year:

          1.  Give a presentation at the regional meetings.

          2.  Provide an article for the CPCUG newsletter.

          3.  Conduct a training seminar.

There are experienced volunteers who are willing to help in all
aspects of forming and operating a CPCUG SIG.

In exchange for abiding by the bureaucratic requirements above a
SIG benefits from being part of an established ongoing
organization with access to an office, well equipped meeting
places (albeit in competition with others), a BBS (the MIX
301-738-9060), a well edited monthly newsletter (The Capital PC
Monitor (ISSN 0884-0830)), postage for meeting announcements, and
a recognized identity.

Because all meetings of the CPCUG and its units are open to the
public there is no absolute requirement for any member of a CPCUG
SIG other than the SIG chairman to be a member of the CPCUG. 
(Many SIGs define their membership as "those present.")  CPCUG
membership is strongly urged however (like public radio).  The
inducements for CPCUG membership include a subscription to the
Monitor, extended use of the MIX, access to a lending library
(books, etc.), and reduced rates for a number of other services. 
(There is currently a move underway to do Internet access from
the MIX.)

The CPCUG is largely oriented toward the needs of computer
consumers (its logo states "Users Helping Users") but there are a
substantial number of members who are computer professionals and
a fair number of those whose professional computer work is not
solely with PCs.

I am willing to help organize a CPCUG Linux SIG, but I am not in
a position to take the major responsibility because I already
have substantial volunteer commitments.  (I serve as the Chairman
of the Potomac ACM SigAPL Chapter, as the Chairman of the CPCUG
APL SIG, and on a demanding ad-hoc committee of the CPCUG BoD.)

Please indicate your interest in this option for a
Baltimore-Washington DC Linux group by responding to Nicholas
Vargish <vargish@sura.net> whose message I am responding to is 
shown below.  It would be particularly encouraging to have
responses from both present CPCUG members and those who are not!

Subject: SLS 1.03 Problems using ESDI drives
Date: Mon, 6 Sep 1993 20:32:33 GMT

 
      Dear Linuxers ,
 
      A week ago I posted a question regarding SLS 1.03 installation using
      ESDI HD. I saw another similar questions, but no answers.
      The problem was inability to boot Linux from/onto HD.
 
      I have 2 ESDI drives : Maxtor XT-760E (760Mb unformatted) and CDC
      383H (380Mb unfomatted) and WD1007A ESDI controller.
 
      I've tried to install the system onto the Maxtor disk. As a last
      instance I've tried to install SLS onto CDC 383H on /dev/hda2
      partition and it worked perfectly.
 
      I suppose that the problem is in PC-BIOS limitations. WD1007 works
      in translating mode as 1024 cyl. , 16 hd. , 63 sec. and the disk
      space is limited to 512Mb while another part of disk remains
      unreacheable for BIOS. There is no problem of this kind with the
      smaller HD when all the disk is used.
 
      Beware !

I prefer the solution with xfig, 'cause you also can use the drawings in
other programs then LaTeX. I've found it on tsx11 in the ported drawer and
it works fine.

Hmm. Interesting. The problem is probably an explicit chec in
'permission()' in linux/fs/namei.c, which looks like this:

:       int permission(struct inode * inode,int mask)
:       {
:               int mode = inode->i_mode;
:
:       /* special case: not even root can read/write a deleted file */
:               if (inode->i_dev && !inode->i_nlink)
:                       return 0;

Right now I can't remember why I disallowed the deleted file open.. 
Hmm.  It's probably enough to remove that test to get it working, but I
have this feeling I actually wrote those lines for a reason (that may or
may not be true any more).

I personally think that there are many excellent applicatinons that have
been released... especially in the MSDOS arena...  it is the only reason
why I use such a limited operating system...

: A "decent" OS does *not* mean a "bug-free" OS.  It means that the OS provides

: DOS is not what I consider to be a "decent" operating system (if it can even
: be called that) because it fails all three of the above criteria.

yeah: i still disagree though: stability is DEFINITELY a major factor
for choosing/using an operating system.  Fair enough if you enjoy
hacking away to fix things, but for the average, third party, non
c-programming end user, it aint much use if things have consistent
problems.

It is true, but hey, look at all the problems with Windows 3.1/NT etc

basic as a Microsoft Product (limited power -> limited problems) ;)

Lets face it - if you have time to have a hack at it, or time to let a
few other people have a go at it, then you have a very good support team
on the Internet.  Also, one might mention, Linux is still in Beta
stages, hence the 0.99 status...

(Jeeez... i didnt read this whole article before i followed it up, and
have just realised there is 40 pages of this argument.. hehehe)

Ill put it like this:

DOS is useful because it has been developed to its very limits: if Linux
had been developed as much, and had as many high-quality apps available
for it, it would probably be the ONLY operating system that i would
use..  as for xwindows more elegant than windows, ill stay out of the
arena because i think it is really just personal choice..

: There's more to an operating system than just being able to run programs,
: and people who don't think so quickly learn otherwise.  Why else do you
: think Consumer Reports rated the Mac GUI above Windoze?  Why else do you
: think they even *bothered* to put multitasking (such as it is) in Windoze?
: Why else do you hear *normal users* complaining about the broken filename
: limitations in DOS?

hmmm.. as far as the Mac GUI goes, I used it for a few years, and then
starting windows, and i must say i prefer the Microsoft product simply
because you arent STUCK in the GUI... (I find i am very limited in power
in such an environment..)
