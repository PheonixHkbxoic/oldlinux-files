You probably aren't thinking quite right about this.

You ask for the "HP 3D look" for your X.
Well, now....
the 3D look is a property of *programs*, not of X.

1) The HP window manager (VUE) has a 3D look to borders, icons and
   so on. You can get similar effects from CTWM (my favourite WM) and
   probably from the MOTIF MWM, maybe also from the GNU GWM, by
   specifying appropriate resources.

2) Quite a few applications in the HP environment are written for MOTIF,
   and use those buttons. If you have MOTIF applications running on your
   Linux box, you will get the same 3D look for them.

3) If you want a 3D look for existing "flat" applications, you might want
   to check out replacing the Xaw library with Xaw3d, which will make a lot
   of the buttons look "3D-like". But don't expect this to be 100%
   trouble-free!

Good luck!

Even though my 486 doesn't have nearly the raw processing power of a
sparc10, it certainly *feels* faster -- and does it with less memory,
a slower disk, and < 1/5 the total cost. 

In my opinion, responsiveness is more important than raw compute speed --
after all, you have here a multitasking operating system, sometimes you
can just let the compute-bound stuff run in the background and get on
with other things.

Konban wa, Peter

I guss you could have received many mails from Japan on this question.
However, I am afraid that no one writes for the other persons on this
NG, which may come from some kinds of Japanese custom :-)(I mean
Japanese never say on himself ^_^).

I am ASCII-jTeX(jLaTeX) user on linux and SVR4/386 system, currently
only its linux version(because I'm now in US only with notebook/486).

>1. Which of the two packages (NTT-jtex or ASCII-jtex) is better?

 in ASCII-TeX, yes.  Maybe NTT-jtex, too.

Sorry, I don't know what is JE.

>4. What experience did you have using jtex?

ASCII-jTeX is super-set of TeX completely.  You don't lost anything
when you would like to use Roman literature on jTeX.

One of the most important points might be which kinds of dvi-ware you
would use.  ASCII-jTeX distribution includes some kinds of dvi-ware
for X11 and some laser printer having Kanji fonts in it.  If you have
such laser printer you can get a woderful print out(in my case using
Canon LaserShot in Japan), but for X11, the quality is not so good.
This is because it uses the default 24 dots kanji fonts included in
the X11 distribution.  I can say, it is hard to be patient with its
fonts, particulary if it is enlarged :-)

I'm now using dviout for VGA display(not for X, linux + kon), and
dviprt for Canon BJ-10e on linux.  As you knoe, this printer has no
Japanese fonts in it.  In addition, the dviout can use 16 dots kanji
fonts, but in this case, you could not be grateful of its quality on
screen by the same reason of its X11 driver.  In these cases, to get a
high grade output, you may need some outline Japanse (kanji) fonts.
I'm using Zeit's vector fonts, New Mincho and New Gothic (this is a
product, not free, about 8,000 yen each). Unfortunately, I have not
its address on hand.

*********Please help me, MIXen in Japan ^_^.*********

ASCII-jTeX source reside in four 1.4M floppy, and dviout/dviprt is in a
floppy.

I hope this may help you,

        Such a beast already exists.  It's called debugfs and is included in

Normal . It's in the README-file , that the fixkbd* on't work with pl9

Several OS's malloc() routines allow for malloc'ing uninitialized memory to
high extents. You start getting problems when you touch (i.e. initialize) the
malloc'ed memory because (I think, please correct me if I'm wrong) the memory
manager releases `physical' memory upon initialization. calloc() fills the
pages with NULLs, as I remember. Thus, the pages get touched immediately
and are spiited out by the memory manager.

Certain OS's even allow for malloc'ing much memory, killing the biggest
process when out of physical (including swap) memory. This OS is called
AIX (yup!).

Hope that was not too wrong. Anyone?

Ciao,

Ok, I am doing this with some hesitation but I will do it anyway. We are going
to allowing people from the Linux background access to our mini network.
We have 2 Machines ( a 486DX50 running Slackware 1.1.0 which is the main
NFS Server and a 386DX40 which is a Dataless client.)  which are named
kpw104.rh.psu.edu and exg106.rh.psu.edu. These machines are named this way 
because we are students at Penn State and this is how the Center for Academic 
Computing issues such accounts. These machines are sitting in our dorm rooms
here. We are running what I like to refer to as "Cheap mans NIS". Which means
that it is a pain in that &^$ to keep the UID's and groups and etc. the same on
both machines, But so far so good. If you want more information about this 
system, there is going to be a first come, first serve system of giving out 
user accounts. We like to share with every one so this is why we are opening 
this up, (hopefully we will not get burnt). You must have a decent purpose 
for wanting to get an account. We are also doing this for the support that
we can get from you. In order to apply for an account, telnet to either machine
and login as guest. There is no password for this. It may take awhile to grant
the account to you as we are students and have our own work to attend to.
Any feedback about the system once the account has been established should be
sent to either root, me (wilcox), Lance Knight (knight), Eylon Geva (geva),
or Mike Cramer(cramer). {Mike is a little busy so please refer to the last 
group of people.} By the way, mail to either machine goes to the same place,
so take your pick of machines to send to. I will be waiting to see the people
that will apply and I hope that you can get some insight into the Linux 
environment (If you are getting started) or we can all learn together from this.


-Ken Wilcox

Ps. Disk space will be very limited so do not be surprised if you can not 
write that much. Any installation of software should be done by the 
"source" group. You can send mail to "source" if you want a program installed
or if you want to become part of the source group, send mail to "accts" 
requesting such.

I've been told that the S3805 cards are much faster than the ET4000/W32
cards. Is this true?

And another question: When I start up linux, it checks if the card installed
has a ET4000 compatible chip or not. Does this mean that ET4000 based cards
run faster under linux than others?
