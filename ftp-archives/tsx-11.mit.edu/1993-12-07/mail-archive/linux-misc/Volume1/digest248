The disk partition table on the disk has ten bits for each of the
starting and ending cylinder. 2^10 == 1024, there you are.

However, I don't know if the disk drivers use the above values or
recalculate the cylinders from the starting absolute sector, length,
and disk geometry. In this case, your limit would be 2^32 blocks ==
4 TB capacity.

If you've browsed the code, then you could check whether the drivers
read these {start,end} cylinder numbers from the partition table or
calculate them from the absolute sectors. Please post your findings.

The partition table layout is in Thom Hogan, The Programmer's PC
Sourcebook, 2.24 on p.2-27/8, ISBN 1-55615-321-X (1991). Mail me if
you can't get it.

Just for grins, I tried out the kernel I built that didn't include
proc fs support.  It did a panic when it tried to mount the root
filesystem and failed.  

:       The install program didn't copy some files.  Do a mkdir
:       /usr/src/linux/fs/proc and copy the files off the cdrom
:       from the same directory into the newly made directory.
:       I have no idea how they get forgotten.

Unfortunately, I returned the CD to the person from whom I borrowed it
(I also returned the CD-drive from whence it was borrowed).

I did manage to get a copy of of the 0.99.13 sources from
sunsite.unc.edu (which took a while at 2400 baud).

When I copied the fs/proc directory into the LGX supplied source tree
and compiled, I got an error because one of the files (link.c)
referenced a field called i_dev in the inode struct.  There ain't one.
There _is_ a field called i_rdev.  So I changed link.c and recompiled.
It compiled and linked OK, but I haven't tried to boot that kernel.

Are the LGX sources _really_ pl13?  Has anybody else recompiled the
kernel from LGX sources?

It seems that I've had to change way too many source files to get the
thing to compile.  It's starting to smell like I've got source files
from mixed patch levels or something like that.

I think I'll start over with the 0.99.13 sources from sunsite.

Get the libgr1.3 from sunsite and you'll be OK. (in /pub/Linux/libs )
You'll find all libraries you need compiled (both .a and .sa) and the possibility
of recompile (even if not suggested!)

                    The Unnkulian Unventure Series
                     Adventure Games for the 90's


Remember the good old days, when adventure games challenged you with
great puzzles and evocative descriptions without resorting to any
graphics at all?  We really miss that emphasis on gameplay rather than
glitz, so we've decided to write our own adventure games along the
lines of the early text games we liked so much.

If you're looking for top-quality interactive fiction comparable to
1980's commercial offerings, check out the Unnkulian Unventure series,
available from an archive site near you!

In _Unnkulian Underworld: The Unknown Unventure_ you play the part of
Kuulest's slave, and must recover the Orb of Studosity from the evil
Unnkulians.  Kuulest, the old geezebag, has died and left you with
nothing to go on but a cryptic message about saving the planet.  You'll
encounter amazing Acme products, the infamous Guardian, those witty
creatures known as Drolls, a giant beaver, and even the Dread Unnkulian
Warrior.  <Gasp!>

In _Unnkulian Unventure II: The Secret of Acme_ your adventure
continues as you try to create some good press for yourself -- wouldn't
want to fade into anonymous obscurity, now would you?  Along the way,
you'll find the answers to these compelling questions, and more:

        o What happened to the Unnkulians?
        o Why are Acme products so bad?
        o What is this cheez stuff, really?

Plus, you'll get to explore Dawg Rock, a Duhdist Retreat, Acme's
clandestine prototypes laboratory, and even pay a visit to Acme HQ.

In _Unnkulia One-Half: The Salesman Triumphant_, you'll play the role
of a down-and-out Acme salesman, forced to work out of the Golden
Dragon Inn, dangerously near Dread Unnkulia.  Will you accumulate
enough loot in this frightful backwater berg to turn your fortunes
in your favor?

And, in _Unnkulia Zero: The Search for Amanda_, will you, the Valley
King's most trusted warrior, rescue his Lady Amanda from the gruesome
clutches of the evil Unnkulians?

The Unnkulian Unventures have already gotten rave reviews from numerous
adventure game connoisseurs around the world, so why not give them a try?

The games are available for FTP from the if-archive at ftp.gmd.de.

        the files listed above are TADS .GAM-file only archives that
        can be used with any machine that runs TADS.  The tricky bit is
        that before you can play the games, you need to get the TADS

        Fortunately, this isn't hard to do.  Just grab the TADS

        The source to TADS 2 is not distributable.  However, if your
        machine isn't on the list yet, and you would like to volunteer

A Word About TADS
=================

We at ADVENTIONS use a programming language called TADS to write our
games.  TADS is a product of High Energy Software, and you can get it
via FTP.

TADS (and TADS goodies) are available for many systems from
ftp.gmd.de.  Look in the if-archive/programming/tads directory.

TADS is also shareware, and we strongly encourage you to register it if
you use it, since we feel it is a powerful, innovative, and very
inexpensive development system that deserves to be paid for.

I have a similar problem... no matter what I do my Fourport cards no
longer work. They worked ok with pl9 and before but now the driver
does not autodetect with CONFIG_AUTO_IRQ and CONFIG_ AST_FOURPORT
defined in kernel/chr_drv/serial.c. If I do not define auto irq and do
an explicit config of the Fourport ports with setserial... they are
reportd coreectly with "setserial -g /dev/cua?" ... but when I try and
talk to the modem through the port... it just dribbles through. I get
a slow echo back and a <return> produces a "-" on the  terminal
screen. Trying to send anything also reslts in a sluggish flickering
of the rd and sd led's. 

I have two 16550A's and two 16450's in each card... though I'm just
trying to get one of them working. I am using SLS stuff with a
0.99pl13 kernel which I compiled. Setserial 2.02 was also compiled.

Or, "Where are the applications?"

The basic problem with Linux is that (as I understand it, and I could be
way off base) you can't run any "real" applications with it.

If Linux could run, say, SCO binaries, this thing would really take off.
In fact, the commercial guys would probably sue us.

Are there any plans in this direction?

I don't think so.  It may never have been true in the first place.  I think 
GNU tar uses owner and group _names_ from the /etc/passwd and /etc/group 
files as well as, or instead of, their numerical equivalents.  This should 
allow you to do a correct cross-system backup-restore for a user, even if a 
numerical UID or GID on the target is different from the ID on the source, 
as long as the name is the same.  I infer this from some of the tar documents, 
but I may be wrong (flames from informed sources will be noted).

However, experiment has shown that I can do a successful compare with "tar -d" 
iff all UIDs and GIDs for all files are correctly defined in /etc/passwd and 
/etc/group at the time of the backup and at the time of the compare.

In the SLS 1.02 distribution there were droves of files with undefined UID 
and/or GID.  When I tried "tar -d" I got pages of UID/GID errors.

So I went through the entire file tree and either (i) defined a missing UID 
or a missing GID in the /etc/passwd or /etc/group file, or (ii) changed the 
file's ownership or group to a defined ID.  Now "tar -d" reports no errors.

John
