    I compiled and installed TCL 7.0B2 and TK 3.3B2 (I think I popped them off
ftp.uu.net) without any problems... didn't have to change a thing, in fact!
Just ran the configuration script followed by make.

    This under the latest SLS dist.

    Well, some problems.. sometimes I have problems with Tk windows not  
recognizing mouse buttons (where other X windows have no problem)... I dunno
what that problem is.  Tcl also dies on the test suite in the expression test,
trig functions aren't generating the appropriate signal on EDOM errors.  I'm
not too concerned...  Tk passes all of its test suites.

So I should mount the a1 disk and copy the password file to it every time I
add a user, just so I can recover from a trashed partition?  Bleech.  Or
restore from tape to the a1 /etc/passwd.

What if your a1 is full (mine is...) and your /etc/passwd gets a block larger?

This isn't a usable solution.  cpio is reliable, doesn't need hacks, why
should I do all sorts of screwy things just so I can use tar???

Agreed!

   however like to talk about what might be done to make NT more useful
   to people who have needs similar to those of most Linux users.

   Many people -- particularly in universities -- either need or want a
   software environment in which they can look at and change the source
   for the system software.  Loadable device drivers may reduce the need
   for this, but they are unlikely to eliminate it.  Furthermore, even if
   one can in principle write a loadable driver or file system, if source
   to all the existing ones is secret, it is much more difficult for
   people to write new ones.  One of the big advantages of Unix has
   always been that you could look at the source.  (I could never
   understand why anyone would want Unix without source.  This is
   probably why it didn't spread very far outside the university
   community, where source has always been available.)  This makes it
   much easier to figure out how to do new things.

Unfortunately, the majority of commercial UNIXs do NOT include source code,
and getting a license for that source code tends to be too costly for anyone
other than large universities doing research in operating systems...
you can thank AT&T for this...

   In principle it should be possible to build a Linux (or BSD, or
   whatever) subsystem under NT.  It would have a full set of Unix-like
   utilities, and be distributed with source.  Then you could do your
   hacking in that subsystem, and use the native NT subsystem for
   commercial applications.  However this is a fairly large project.  In
   practice it's unlikely that it will happen without Microsoft's help,
   as the expertise to build a new subsystem doesn't seem like something
   many people are going to have.  I'd bet that in practice you'd need to
   look at code for parts of NT.  It's even possible that something like
   this could be done by porting Gnu code to the existing POSIX
   subsystem, though descriptions of the POSIX subsystem don't sound all
   that encouraging.  There are also architectural issues involved.  For
   example, the Windows subsystem has a privileged position in NT that
   may (or may not) make it difficult to do X in a way that I think we'd
   want to do it.  (I would certainly want my Windows windows to be under
   the control of the X window manager, not the reverse.)

Ummm...perhaps I'm being a little dense here, but *why* would you want
to have *any* UNIX running as a subsystem of Windows NT? For some reason
that just doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. The *primary* advantage
of Windows NT is the Windows applications available for it. This you could
accomplish via something along the lines of the Sun Wabi product. The other
conceptual problem is running a *multi-user* subsystem under a *single-user*
system. To me, it would be conceptually more straight forward to run
a *single-user* subsystem under a *multi-user* system. Isn't that basically
what you're doing when running bash or tcsh under UNIX ? Why not just
have a new UNIX "shell" called say "wntsh", then if an individual user
wants to run in a "Windows NT" environment, then they only need to start
up the appropriate shell. As an individual user you *are* in a single
user environment...

I *do* agree that I would want my Windows windows to be under the
control of the X window manager, but how would you do that *if* you're
running X as a subsystem of UNIX, which you want to run as a subsystem
of Windows NT ?

Of course, this assumes that the complexity of each compiler is about the
same.  I don't think this is going to be the case in practice.

For instance, the Fortran to C translator is probably going to be a lot
simpler than the C to assembler translator, simply because many of the
constructs involved in the two languages are similar (e.g., variables).
The Fortran to machine code translator will have at least two separate
passes in it, and possibly even 3.  It has to translate from a very high
level language directly to machine code, which is a more complicated
process than going from Fortran to C.

The C to assembler translation process is almost as complex as the
Fortran to machine code translation, but the former can take advantage
of some of the symbol resolution capabilities of the assembler whereas
the latter has to account for such things directly.

The assembler to machine code translation isn't much to worry about.  It's
a relatively straightforward transformation.  Writing an assembler is a
more or less straightforward exercise for the advanced undergraduate.

In the environment where the Fortran to C translator would be used, the C
compiler and the assembler will both be very well tested and relatively
bug-free.  The confidence level in these two passes will be relatively
high, so the only remaining question is the confidence level in the
Fortran to C translator.

I think it ends up being more or less a wash.

75% as fast means .75 the speed.  I would surmise that 75% slower means
(x - .75x) = .25x.

Really?  Why's that?

100% slower means that the application crashes, perhaps taking the system
with it.  :-) :-)

I thought zsh supports Linux. I have been using zsh for more than a year
now. But I had to configure it by hand since it used /bin/csh to config
and had some very interesting configuration stuff. I think the authors
should take a look at GNU autoconfig.

Yes, it is nice.  You can get it from sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/X11/xapps/comm

I know that it's up to at least version 2.14 though.  Anyone know

Greetings-
    I'm looking to buy a '486 from Comtrade (the EISA SCSI-2 VL-Bus system)
and the disk controller that comes as standard is the DTC 3270. I want to run
Linux on it, so I checked the SCSI portion of the most recent FAQ I could 
find (July '93) and while it mentions that the Adaptec-compatible DTC 
controllers DTC3290 and DTC3292 are supported, there is no explicit mention
of the DTC3270 as either supported or not. Does anybody know if it is (or
soon will be) supported under Linux or not?

Thanks in advance,

OK. It seems that the technical problems encountered by the group trying
to develop a driver for FDC based tape streamers are unsurmountable, for
the moment at least, so I'm looking elsewhere for a backup system. During
my search I came across the following (affordable?) solutions:

- SCSI based Sankyo tapestreamer for about $450. 250 MB capacity.
- SCSI based Archive ""          for about $600. 525 MB capacity. (includes
  an Adaptec SCSI controller, which I don't need).
- IDE based Summit tapestreamer for about $350. 300 MB capacity.

has anyone used these gizmos (un)successfully with LINUX?

Oh yeah.  I hadn't noticed that.  Btw, what's TC/PIP ?  :-)  Is that
