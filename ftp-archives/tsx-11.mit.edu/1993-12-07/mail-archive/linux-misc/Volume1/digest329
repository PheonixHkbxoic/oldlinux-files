I don't remember when, but I had conflicting declarations of panic()
in linux/sched.h and linux/kernel.h.
In sched.h, I changed "extern void panic" to "volatile void panic",
according to kernel/panic.c, then the kernel compiled and worked.

Subject: Linux counter: Register your friends!
Date: 22 Nov 1993 12:27:25 GMT

Hello,

I have now upgraded the Linux counter to support "friend registration".
There are also other features to support telling it about your machine,
telling it what country you *really* belong to and so on; insert the
word "help" in the *text* of your message to get the details.

But: To register friends:

Send a message containing, in the BODY of the message, the lines

//FRIEND
Email-address@domain.name: At home
Email-address@domain.name: At work
Email-address@domain.name: At school
//END

That's it!
If you want to register someone who does not have an E-mail address, you
should start with a question mark, such as:

?Givenname.Surname@city.state.country: at home

Use 2-letter country codes (GB for England, US for USA, otherwise, it
is more or less the same as the domain name) for the country. "State"
should be 2 letters in the US, and may be left out in other places.

PRIVACY NOTICE:

The Linux counter will give back *NO* information about individuals,
except for (possibly) information about individuals who have asked for
the information to be made public. (See HELP message)

A consequence of this is that duplicate elimination for "friends" is
somewhat hard, and that you will *not* be told if your submitted
information is dropped because of a detected duplicate.
If you want to know what is registered from your E-mail address, send
me an E-mail; no automatic reading is implemented yet.

Comments are welcome!

Good luck!

Oops - I forgot to include this:

If you do not include one of the special commands, the counter
will register you as a Linux user based on the Subject: field,
as before.

Good luck!

Having written svgalib, I may be able provide some hints.

Basically, porting real X applications is almost impossible (and not very
useful), since they use more than a few X calls. However, if the program only
writes images or framebuffers to the screen, porting to svgalib can be useful.
For example, I hacked the Berkeley Software MPEG Decoder (mpeg_play) to use
svgalib, and it can use pretty full-color (truecolor) dithering. I'll probably
upload it to sunsite soon.

The main use of svgalib is in hicolor/truecolor modes, 320x200x256 (full-screen
animation, games?), some applications on X-deprived systems, and doing things
like restoring/changing the VGA textmode font.

        That depends.  How much do you want to run in X?  If all you
do is twm and a few xterms, 8M is plenty.  On the other hand, if you
want xv, emacs 19 in X-mode, etc, etc, you'll want more.  I've got 10M
in my system (maxed out, it's a weird motherboard) and I want more.
I'm normally sitting at around 18-20M worth of processes. <sigh>.

Subject: term performance
Date: 22 Nov 1993 13:32:10 GMT


I'm trying to improve the performance of term between my home linux
box and my SPARC IPX running Sun OS 4.1.1. Term is running on top of
kermit at 9600 baud. My modem is 14.4 and is capable of going up to
57.600 but since the modem at work is a 9600 and not configured right 
(not set up to run at it's optimal configuration) the modems negotiate
to run at 9600 (hardware compression and error checking is turned off
so people with slower modems can dial-in). So to improve the
performance I have been playing with the term parameters on both sides
and discovered that I get the best performance if the term on the
linux side is set to send data at only 2400 baud (set in termrc). 
Term on the remote side (sun) is set to send data at 57600. This is
very surprising to me - I thought that term should be able to send data
from linux to sun at at least 9600. But if I do that the performance
is noticably slower. Why?

Thanks for any hints.

 The behaviour of unlink (rm) is configurable: You can either chose to ignore
unlinks on virtual files (i.e. unlink("filename") will not try to unlink
"filename.gz", but will report no error if it exists), or to not ignore them
( i.e. unlink("filename") will unlink "filename.gz" if "filename" does not
exist, but "filename.gz" )

 In either case, rm works normally on uncompressed files. (i.e.
unlink("filename") will remove "filename" if it exists)

 Unfortunately, the default behaviour is to ignore unlink request. To chose
the other behaviour, just put "commands default use unlink" in your zlibrc 
file.

I got a copy of the Yggdrasil LGX CD.  I think, there are two advantages
of Linux on CD versus Linux on floppy for me:

- You can leave data on the CD.  For example, there are Megabytes of
  font data for X windows, for ghostscript, etc. . You can delete
  them on your hard disk and make a soft link to the CD ROM instead.
  Saves hard disk space, but requires to have the CD ROM mounted all
  the time you use something from it.

  If you have a really fast CD ROM, you can even run executables
  from it.

- A CD ROM is much cheaper then the equivalent in disks.

Yesterday we were trying to connect a Archimedes computer as terminal to my
Linux system. A friend told me to uncomment an entry in /etc/inittab. After
a reboot there still wasn't a getty 'polling' the terminal. When we looked
in the manual for getty we found that all entries in /etc/initttab have the
line and the speed of the connection swapped. Is there a reason for this?? 
After we swapped the speed and line in the entry we used and a reboot there
was an getty entry for the line, so we think all the entries should be like
the getty syntax dictates.

/dev/sda is your first scsi disk drive.
/dev/sda2 is your extended partition.
/dev/sda5 is one of the logical partitions (?) within the extended

I got the Bustek BT742A, which is the BT747S predecessor.  Anyway, I
don't think there is such a thing such as enhanced mode on the
BT742A, like what the Adaptec AHA 1742 has.  I does have a 32-bit
addressing mode which requires software switching to.  The 32-bit
addressing mode allows the mailbox structure to be 32-bit (4 
gbytes addresses) instead of the standard AHA1542B 24-bit mailbox
address.  IMHO, the BT742A is an exact clone of the AHA 1542, except
that the speed is very fast.  I don't think there will be any speed
increase when it is switched to 32-bit addressing mode.

Are you able to get this drive working under DOS?  You may want to
give Buslogic tech support a call.  I think there may be some hardware
incompatibility there.

1. You can't put arguments for the shell program in /etc/passwd.

2. Create a script file. Put the execution of your command and its
arguments in there. Make sure that the script terminates with an
exit directive. Put the name of the script as the name of the
shell.

i.e.:

#!/bin/sh
/my/bozo/program -e whatever -n something else
exit 0

3. Secure the file for execution (i.e., make the file have "x"
authority for the proper user who is identified by the UID field
of the /etc/passwd entry.)

Actually, using exec would be a better and cleaner solution.

#!/bin/sh
exec /my/bozo/program -e whatever -n something else

No exit command needed (the exec replaces the shell script, so when the
program ends, there is nothing to come back to).

Gateway is determined to provide a moving target in the video card

the CLX and that it had DRAM.  This was verified by their ads at the

new card, the LX which sports VRAM instead of DRAM.  As usual, they
tell me that this card at $170 is strictly identical to the $350
Graphics Ultra Pro.  For some reason I don't believe them.  However,
if it does the job and can give you 1270x1024 resolution at 256
colors, who cares.  I certainly have better things to do with $180 
than to opgrade if there is no reason.
