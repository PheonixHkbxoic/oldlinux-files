Reply-To: wb8foz@skybridge.scl.cwru.edu (David Lesher)

I've found a bug in 1.4G. Checking back, it seems to exist in 1.4B, too. 

If you select full-screen mode on the file transfer setup menu,
starting a download totally scrambles the keyboard layout. This
makes it difficult ;-} to get out of minicom to reset things.

Now, here's the weird part. While ALT-F1/F2 etc was FUBAR, the
new ALT-PNTSCR "previous VC" was not. Presto, I'm root. Now I
can at worst, reboot.

NOT. Somehow, the keyboard mapping was deranged for that VC,
also. Blindly trying keys looking for letters such as "r" "e"
etc, didn't work out. Red Switch Time. [I just LOVE watching
fsck working over 4 filesystems...]

Note that I do load a new keytable with rc.local, but how could
that affect things? 

The cure, howeever, is unpainful. Just be sure that minicom does
not have full-screen mode set for any protocol.

Suggestions?

    I would tend to agree with you.  There is no Linux distribution robust
    enough to be commercially saleable.. yet!

    But it's getting close.  The networking is the last big hurdle as far
    as I'm concerned.  I figure another 6 months will see the networking
    stable and robust, but right now it's too incomplete and crashprone for
    anyone other then an expert (i.e. like the people who frequent these
    groups) to be able to use.
    
    This is not a critism!  Networking is one of those things where attention 
    to detail is ten times more important then people think and so I believe 
    the networking work (Net-2) to be progressing about as fast as possible
    for what it is succeeding to accomplish.  Very few from-scratch networking
    ports have ever been done.

    Second on my list would be the myrid small problems with XFree -- things
    like the video modes getting screwed up, inability to exit/restart more
    then a couple of times (or even more then once!) with some video boards,
    lack of video driver integration (maybe 2.0?), etc...  I tried out about
    half a dozen different video cards and only the Bocca card (the slowest
    of the lot) was stable enough for me use.

    I think the rest of the system is in very good shape.  The only crashes
    I am having at the moment are network related, and I've been able to
    compile and install tcl, tk, groff, Inn, and other myrid packages with 
    almost no modification.  This says a lot for the system.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

Reply-To: bf703@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Patrick J. Volkerding)


That's right, another revision of the Slackware release of Linux
has arrived at ftp.cdrom.com in /pub/linux/slackware. It should
show up on some mirror sites today, and on the rest by tommorrow.

Support for the 5.25" boot drive is greatly improved, athough it still
requires that your second floppy drive be a 3.5". Due to space
considerations I don't think there's an easy solution for people who
only have 5.25", although they should still be able to install from hard
drive or NFS from the old test system in /pub/linux/old103/test.   

Software can now be added to an existing system via floppy, hard drive,
or NFS from the new boot disk. Just boot it up and go along like you're
going to install from scratch - it will detect your existing system and 
ask if you want to add software to it.

Many things were upgraded - XView has been upgraded to v. 3.2, for
instance. Tin has been upgraded to 1.2p2. There are now two file
managers on the X series for you to try, as well as the Seyon tele-
communications package. Lots of little things here and there were fixed
up throughout the A series, too.

More things are in the works, but I figure this should keep you busy for
a while! ;^)

Have fun, folks!

The .profile file (or the .login) starts once at login time.
The .cshrc starts each time you start a new shell.
If you want to start X11 at login time insert the line 'startx' in
your .profile.

As I understood it (but I may be wrong) turbo can mean different
things on different machines. For example, on my computer I can
switch off turbo mode either by disabling the internal cache or
by reducing the clock speed. The first doesn't alter my 7.55
Bogomips, while the second reduces it to a value of 2 or so.

How about some nice mathematics ?

Like computing ;) 'e' or 'PI' ?

Should look like getting the actual time, go for 'e', show time, go for 'PI'
show time, get the actual time and give me the difference to the first.

This should be pretty good to show, how fast your machine computes, as long as
you use fix floats (e.g. 100).
And on different machines this will vary, depending on built-in coprocessor
(either in kernel or motherboard) and MHz.

No flame, but I don't think *just* giving the time results of

even represents a typical usage/application mix for a typical Linux
user...It also would not be a very good basis for comparison with other,
non-linux, machines.

While there is no one *true* benchmark that can be used to say that
machine A is faster than machine B for *your* applications, I've found
that the BYTE UNIX benchmark suite tests a fairly broad spectrum of
items that typically impact system performance, including C compiler
performance. For one data point:

gats486.larc.nasa.gov:
  gateway 2000 486/33C, ISA Bus, 8MB ram, 200MB & 340MB (Western Digital)
  IDE drives, ISA IDE controller, ATI Graphics Ultra, standard cache for
  8MB (don't recall what that is).

Benchmark was run on an "unloaded" machine: no other jobs/user running,
only standard tcp/ip networking daemons running...

Results: (I'm still trying to figure out the problem with the file copy
          test results)

After using Fvwm on my linux box at home, I've even started using it on the Sun
machines at Uni!  Indeed, Rob's Fvwm is an excellent piece of work and getting
better.  I'd recomend it to any Linux'er.

Cheers,

Howdy,

Just installed MCC pl10.  No LPD with distribution so I ftp'd the lpd tar
package.  Installed it according to the one page instructions.  I have
been attempting to follow the FAQ but it wasn't a smooth go.

LPD is running, checked via ps -ax.  I lpr a file, and nothing happens.
No queue entry, nothing.  So.. I checked out /usr/adm/messages and 
found that an error was being generated the error had to do with an
invalid file or directory.  /usr/lib/lpf is the offending comment.  Hmm..
What gives?  Should I touch it in to existance?  If so, what permissions 
do I need to give it.  If it should be a directory, again what permissions.

Oh, then I ftp'd the interrupt lpd package.  No docs!  I guessed I needed
to gcc the lpcntl.c file.  So I did.  Ok, it runs.  Add it to my /etc/rc
just before the /usr/etc/lpd entry.  I still get the same error in /usr/
adm/messages.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.
Roll Tide!!
Rod

The more is said about this BogoMip-stuff, the more I come to this:

        BogoMip is LAME !!!!!!!!

Don't you know, that, if you start Linux on DOS (ROTFL), it deletes all
files with the string 'Microsoft' in it?

From the previous posts I conclude that BogoMips is only dependent on Processor
type & speed, and on caching abilities?

I mean, it does NOT depend on mem size, AT-bus speed, availability of Local Bus,
speed & mem size of video card, hard disk speed etc. etc.

Is that correct?

Wouter.
