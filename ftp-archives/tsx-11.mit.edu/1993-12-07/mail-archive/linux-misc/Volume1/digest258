Can someone out there please tell me what is wrong with SLS ?
I read the faq and it pointed me to the SLS.   
Which one do you recommend over SLS ?  Can you give me a summary 
of what is bad about SLS and good about others ?
I am new to Linux, less than 1 day :-) 
I got stuck last night with the creation of file system when I
installed SLS, so it might not be too late for me to switch to
other package if SLS has too many bugs (what kind?)

Thank you for any information.

There is a much better option - try the DFI MU-440 instead.  This is
a clone of the old AST 4-port card - it is BUILT to use a single
interrupt for all four ports.  Much easier solution, and the cost
is comparable.  

BOCA also has some multi-port boards that are a LOT less expensive
than the $1200 or so that Michael was describing!

Date: 31 Oct 93 17:27:46 GMT


With 'enscript -2Gr' it's fairly simple to send nice two-column output to a postscript
printer...however, my printer is a dot matrix, and linux doesn't seem to want to
be fooled into thinking it's postscript.  I know the printer can handle it, because
I've printed out GIFs on it before with a reasonable degree of resolution.

I've tried piping nenscript through ps2ascii with no result.

You're right, col.admin doesn't have a daily at the moment.

The reason for this is that it's not clear (to me, anyway) what is and
isn't appropriate in col.admin.  It needs to be very clear in order to
to say something concise and meaningful in a daily posting.

If you read Matt Welsh's "Welcome to the comp.os.linux hierarchy",
posted weekly, you'll see that he's not exactly clear on what it's
for, either.  Personally I think the creation of col.admin was a
mistake.

Essentially, whether a posting is to do with "administration" seems to
me to be orthogonal to whether it is an announcement, bugfix, question
or development suggestion/discussion.

Also, most of the issues that are raised to do with Linux affect
system administration, to greater or lesser extent.

These factors mean that it's not at all obvious which postings should
go to col.admin and which elsewhere.  This is presumably the reason
why there are so many "off topic" posts there (depending on what "off
topic" means).

If we can come to some kind of consensus here as to what is
appropriate in col.admin I'll be perfectly happy to put out a daily
posting.

Btw, I've been seriously considering a daily posting in
col.development.  What do people think about that idea ?

No, I don't think so.  There's the Hardware Compatibility List (now a
HOWTO) to answer that kind of question.  If a piece of hardware isn't
in that list (either as supported or not supported) the question
asking about it should be in col.help.

IMO questions of this nature should be answered in the Hardware
Compatibility List.  Again, if they're not they should be posted to
col.help.

Here in Chicago one can get unix accounts with unlimited internet
access via a 56kb line for $25.00/month, or $65.00/quarter.  A freind
of mine uses this to connect to the internet.  In London, a company
called "Demon" has a similar price structure for internet connections
offering SLIP access.  It sounds like some entreprenuers should look
into Holland as a ripe market for setting up business ...

Even better opportunities exist in Moscow.
There you are supposed to carry diskettes to a computer to send
mail!

Compared to that the Holland offer is a bargain.

So, if there are any Linuxers in Moscow with an internet connection:
write me and I'll help you get a customer.

I just read the last Linux faq from Ian Jackson. Brouse through it
and you will see, that recommendations are _not_ to use SLS.

"...The SLS 1.03 distribution (which I would recommend you stay well
clear of - it has a number of serious and annoying bugs) takes around
100Mb..."

"Question 6.14.  Emacs just dumps core.
You probably have the old version of Emacs that comes with SLS.  It
doesn't work without the X libraries....."

"Some versions of SLS have an entry for the root partition in /etc/mtab
made in /etc/rc by using rdev.  This is incorrect -- the newer versions of
mount do this automatically..."

"Other versions of SLS have a line in /etc/fstab that looks like:
    /dev/sdb1   /root   ext2   defaults
This is wrong.  /root should read simply /."

"You should read the Installation HOWTO for more details on how to go about
installing Linux.  Note, though, that despite its heavy emphasis on the
SLS release I would not recommend using SLS for any new Linux
installation; you should consider using MCC-Interim, TAMU or Slackware
instead."

I think it's obvious enough, that SLS isn't something superior...

So much perfection as possible. What I absolutely don't like is,
that Peter Mc Donald concentrate his activities on his *commercial*
SLS version, after he climed the 'hall of fame' with SLS at a time when 
no other package was so large and complete.

I was very disappointed, that P. McDonald didn't respond to

If somebody is making a release with updates, with respect to the fact,
that thousands of users use his system then he should do his best, to
fix bugs, that are reported by the community who use his product.

I believe, that Peter Mc Donald fixes only his commercial version a lot
using the bad experiences his non commercial users made.

Otherwise I can't imagine another reason, why SLS 1.0.3 has so many
flaws after 1.0.1 and 1.0.2.

Compared to that Patrick Volkerdings Slackware Releases since 1.0.1
(now 1.0.5) made real jumps from release to release. And he is someone
who knows about the 'r'eply key in elm.

I would recommend to delete any recommendations about SLS in the
howtos or Linux faq's. Put in something other like Slackware....

But gnu people are making fixes when there is a bug. In SLS
you have the same errors in three different releases ....
No feedback from P. Mc Donald.
