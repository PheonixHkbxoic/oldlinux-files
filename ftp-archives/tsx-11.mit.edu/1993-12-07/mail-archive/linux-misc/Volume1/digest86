This one is nice. It reminds me of the Dec Alpha PC with NT as OS that we have in our office:
The only USEFUL application we found on that system was the CD-Player SW.
But since everybody in the office was too lazy to switch CD's and nobody wanted to hear the same CD all day long, we changed back to the old radio and powered the Alpha down.

Date: Thu, 2 Sep 1993 18:58:11 GMT

I have a nice ftp-client called "ftp-rl" (rl stands for gnu readline),
which won't compile anymore under NET-2 Linux

In file included from ftp.c:33:
/usr/include/netinet/ip.h:43: dev.h: No such file or directory
/usr/include/netinet/ip.h:44: linux/sock_ioctl.h: No such file or directory
/usr/include/netinet/ip.h:159: eth.h: No such file or directory


Is there a newer version of this ftp-client, which will work with the new
NET-2?

I totally agree, but to properly describe what CircleMUD is defies
"one sentence description".  Briefly, it is a multi-user network game.
For more info, you probably would want to read the FAQ on MUDS and mudding,

May be I should try upload a working diskette demo.  But I suggest someone make

promote Linux.  For example, you can bring the diskette to local user group

So some will prefer pay the fees.  Though this way they hard to keep track of

I had this thought a while ago.  There are lots of problems.  The
first one is that g*zip is not reentrant, which means that you could
only have one stream open at any time, or worse.  There are also lots
of performance issues that would make it hard to do with any
reasonable performance.

Agreed.

If you can detect things like

void foo()
{
        char *bar;

        *bar++ = '\0';
}

then it will be purify like.  Otherwise, it is just a very good
malloc debugger.  Purify does check for memory leaks, but it also
checks for lots of other things, like parameters to functions that are
overlapping, the above code, etc.

Agreed...  Purify offers significantly more functionality,
specifically:

        - it puts "red zone"'s around all (?) variables so when
          you reference immediately past the end of an array it
          will be immediately detected
        - it knows if you access unallocated storage, so to help
          in finding references to freed storage, it "ages" freed
          storage, keeping them in the heap free list for an
          extended period of time

And like Checker,

        - it uses conservative collection to (try) to detect storage
          leaks, and it also attaches partial call stack information
          to allocations to aid in debugging

Purify probably does more stuff, I've never actually seen the product,
this is what they describe in the 1992 Usenix paper, "Purify: Fast
Detection of Memory Leaks and Access Errors"

The primary disadvantages of Purify is that its not portable (it
rewrites object code) and it does *not* provide full coverage for
memory access errors, e.g., its possible to dereference a pointer past
the end of a variable, into the next without detection.

Hopefully, I'll release Safe-C next month -- it solves both of the
aforementioned problems.  Its a portable package based on GCC which
provides complete coverage for all memory access errors, both spatial
and temporal (except in the presence of casts from non-pointer values
to pointer values).  The software (developed under Linux) is complete,
I'm just holding out (not easy) on posting it until I have published a
report on the methodology.  When that occurs I'll make it available with
the report.

Be safe,

This has been posted about a dozen times before, but...

        THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN -O2 and -On, FOR ANY n GREATER 
        THAN 2!

I would love to know where this piece of folklore came from.  All it
takes is reading a couple of files in the gcc to learn that there is
absolutely no effect whatsoever.  -O1 and -O2 are defined by gcc itself;
any n greater than 2 is available to be defined by the various architecture
support files.  No such definitions exist for x86.

Using -O6 by habit may lead to problems later if someone does define
a -O3 optimization, and it turns out to not be a good general optimization.

We did extensive testing of -m486 when building the very first binaries
for XFree86.  We needed to determine whether we had to build 386 and
486 binary kits.  We ran tons of benchmarks, none of which showed any
noticable difference in server performance.  Outside of the kernel, you
are not likely to find more complex code than the X server.  Hence we
use -m486 for all of our binary distributions.

I would think the only place you might see a difference is a very
old/cheap 386 with no cache.  But then you deserve what you get anyhow.

Ok, here is the the question that has always burned in my heart.  I figured that
as soon as I had a machine to run Linux on, I'd ask, but now seems as good a 
time as any.  Just what is meant by a "distribution?"  Why can't we just dload
related programs as a "package?"  We could get the boot disk, the root disk, and
the compiler package, the X package, network package....etc.  Then we could 
simply dload our favorite install script for each package and people would be
supporting their own install-script-religion. ;^)  This would be much simpler
than fighting over entire directories of packages.

Hey there,

  I'm using Seyon on my Gateway 4DX-33 with a Supra 9600 baud fax modem.
Seyon seems to compile and run fine, but I can't use it to dial cause
it thinks I'm online already and aborts the dial.  All the control panel
lights are on (except for ring, of course) all the time the modem's on.

  Just thought somebody might've seen it before.

     Thanks,
        Brad
