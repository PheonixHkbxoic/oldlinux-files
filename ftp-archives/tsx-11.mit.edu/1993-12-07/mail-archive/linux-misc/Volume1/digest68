Date: 29 Aug 1993 03:14:01 GMT

Ultrastor 34F SCSI, SCSI-2, local bus controller.

Less than 6months old. latest bio chipset 200080.006 (not the
earlier buggy version, which has problems with MS-DOS)

Worked perfectly with DOS, Linux (but it is supposed to work with OS/2,
SCO and other commercial UNIX systems).

In original packaging, with all software drivers (one floppy disk) and
documents included. (just one brochure)

Paid $279 +s/h from DC Drives, I believe it's still the best price now.

Asking: $225 or best offer, I'll pay UPS shipping.

Nor was NT!  If NT is so portable, why are chip vendors falling over
themselves to make little-endian/switchable CPUs?

It wasn't enough for the program I was trying to port, it assumed yytext
was a copy of the text from the file buffer, rather than a pointer into
the file buffer with a NULL patched in; so it edited the contents of
yytext, sometimes even lengthening it then doing a yymore. Yukk.

Well,I think 2.3.1 needed some minor fixes for Linux (it's at sunsite :
/pub/Linux/system/shells), but the 2.4 beta works fine - you just have to say
  buildzsh
  
  and it builds fine...
  
  The latest beta version is 2.4 pl 216, which needs a small fix to work
properly, but then is fine.  One of the major improvements over 2.3.1 is
dynamic completion (similar to tcsh's), which finally puts zsh ahead of tcsh
in the really-cool-shell stakes :)

zsh source is available at ftp.sterling.com, as well as a place in the
netherlands that I can't remember offhand...

Hassle me if you need that little patch for pl 216 (I don't know if it's on
the ftp sites yet)

Another happy zsh user,
 Andrew

Here's two more hacks which will work for a particular directory:

        cp /dev/null core
        chmod a-w core          # core can't be written
OR
        ln -s /dev/null core    # core will be written to /dev/null

But then all programs are language translators.

e.g. grep:
        input language is REs + text
        output language is text matching REs
wordperfect:
        input language is commands + text
        output lanugage is printer controls + window controls.

Subject: Re: SLS considered harmful (wasRe: Bashing Peter MacDonald)
Date: 29 Aug 1993 15:08:18 GMT

I have to agree that childish complaints against Peter's work are
unwarranted. However, I feel personally responsible for at least some 
of SLS's popularity: after all, I advocate it in virtually all of the
current Linux documentation. 

Why? I don't think that SLS is the best release available. I think that
SLS needs a lot of help, from someone who knows something about packaging
and distributing a trouble-free, mature, and robust UNIX system. There is
simply no excuse for many of SLS's shortcomings: there are installation
problems with SLS that I have seen since 0.98 still in the current 
distribution. This makes my "job" as documentor and consultant extremely
difficult, and unreasonably so. For this reason, I am not obliged to
document SLS in the future as I have done so faithfully in the past. If
there aren't some serious changes in the direction and robustness of the 
SLS release very soon, I am dropping it from all of the docs in favor of
another, more mature, release.

That being said, I do appreciate Peter's work on SLS. I think we all do.
Instead of complaining to Peter about it, however, people need to step
forward and volunteer to help work out the bugs in the SLS release with
test installs and the like. And Peter needs to incorporate those changes
in the SLS release proper. Long ago, I made several attempts at reorganizing
the TCP/IP software (NET-1) for SLS, which Peter responsed positively to,
but never incorporated into the main SLS release. If Peter really wants SLS
to be the bona finde Linux distribution, he needs to do as Linus and others
do every day: accept corrections and modifications from the user base. 

SLS does have many many strong points, aside from technical problems.
First of all, it includes just about everything, including X (it can be
argued that SLS contains "too much"). It is also available via mail on
diskette, tape, and CD-ROM directly from Softlanding. And they sell support.
If only MCC had this availability, and included X, then perhaps it would
replace SLS. The reality is, most new Linux users simply don't know enough
about UNIX to install X by hand, although it only means gzipping and untarring
a few files from /. (You'd be surprised how difficult that is for a new UNIX
user.) Secondly, because MCC doesn't have CD-ROM, tape, or diskette mail
distributions, it's difficult for me to advocate it in books like the I&GS and
elsewhere: after all, if you can only get MCC from the Internet, it doesn't 
do anyone else much good.

Now, I feel that there is a real solution on the horizon, in the form
of a brand-new Linux release from someone not only with a full distributor
but also from someone who knows a lot about UNIX. I will say no more at 
this time, but let it suffice to say that I don't think that SLS will be
around within a year. The Linux community does demand more robust standards
than it has in the past: it is no longer a shaky, weak hacker's OS in which
we accept technical shortcomings as are seen in SLS. If SLS fails to meet
these new standards, it will disappear.

        It can be found on ftp.ctr.columbia.edu, and it does indeed
give a sun3 good performance.  Our sun 3/50 stations boot in around 45
seconds, and login takes about 10 seconds 8).  Performance feels like
an slc, I'd say, and you get that huge monitor 8).

TFTP is no problem.  That's a standard IP protocol, and the server for
it could be ported to Linux with no special problem.  Ditto bootp.  So
booting Cisco boxes and NCD X terminals should be no problem.  However
diskless Suns use RARP instead of bootp to find out their IP address.
RARP is not an IP protocol.  Thus it needs special kernel support.  I
wondered whether Linux has the necessary code in the kernel, and
whether anyone has actually ported an RARP server to it.
