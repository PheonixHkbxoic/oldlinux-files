on a sunsite mirror). If you can't find it, mail me.   

Btw: we use PiCTeX as export format, so we can see the pictures in the

We use Xfig (interactive) to produce PiCTeX output. We also use 
PiCTeX command to generate graphics via programs that we wrote at 
our insitute. In other words: PiCTeX is a language which describes
pictures, but it is not restricted like LaTeX concerning line slopes 
or size of circles.

Btw: PiCTeX is free, as far as I know the manual is not. We use
a (german) book from Helmut Kopka, which describes PiCTeX. The 
german title is ''LaTeX Erweiterungsmoeglichkeiten'' (LaTeX 
extensions). I don't know if there you can find an english version of 
this book.

I know that there is a special style or program to produce flow 
charts, but I don't know the name. Maybe you should ask again in 
comp.text.tex. Look out for a list of style files.

From: m91dps@ecs.ox.ac.uk (Disaster prone simpleton)

Acording to a unix wizard you can create a directory /tarz which sees opens,
etc and mangles things so /tarz/foo/bar is /foo/bar but with .tar and .tar.Z
files converted into dirs. So if /foo/bar/baz.tar.Z exists you can do
cd /tarz/foo/bar/baz as if it was a normal dir with automatic untaring and
uncompression (read only access for everybody inc. superuser is planned).

Is this true? Where can I find the amd source (to see how to set up
daemons which see opens etc via the NFS)? Does this trick work anyway?

I will be gone by the end of the coming Friday...

True.. But years ago, when my dad worked for NCR.. I grabbed one of those
free subscription forms from an Infoworld.. and like sent it in saying I was
a director of purchasing for some gizallion dollar company.. so I wouldn't
have to wait a week to read the X.Cringe collumn :).. and now, several years
later, I get such an amazing array of junk in the mail, you wouldn't believe!
Every fly-by-night company in the free world sends me flyers about their
wasteoid database program (with complimentry WinDoze cartoon calendar)! Those
folks with the free CD can send me anything they want.. chances are it'll get
lost under one of Microsoft's triplicate mailings and I'll never see it!

Moral of the story: If you'r going to fill out free subscription forms,
make sure they come from either Beverage World or that the new Linux Journel.
That and direct mailings stink, unless its one of those cool minute-man flyers
trying to see you a giga-watt UPS. :)

There is also the package I support, Andrew.  The current version has
it's own object-oriented system called Class but we've already converted
to C++ for a future release.  If you're looking for an application
framework I think Andrew is really the answer.  Thanks to Michael

Yes, thank you.  I have been considering a handbook myself.  The pricing is
still kind of steep, and I also have been wondering very much about the
resume and X myself.  Also been wondering about battery life running Linux
(I assumed that some of the power saving options would not work properly
 under a REAL OS, or perhaps be too annoying).

Please do keep us informed of your progress!!! :)

Not SOLARIS, it is a multithreaded OS and from what I have read, it will creat
multiple threads and they get queued on to the available processors, no matter
how many of them exist, so it is not one processor to one process(at least
in theory)

        I checked the FAQ for a reference to COMPAQ's QVision video board
        for compatability and found no reference positive or negative. I
        am considering placing and order for a new prolinea MT CDS as 
        described in the Dec 93 PC World. I have used my deskpro 386sx
        for five years and I love Compaq Quality. (no COMPAQ FLAMES PLEASE!)

        I plan on getting this configureation:

                        QVision 2Mb Vram

        Does anyone know of any inheirent problems with this setup comming from
        the QVision Board, COMPAQ BIOS, or anything else that I have overlooked?

        I want to run Linux with Xfree86, GCC, Vi, G++, to do X programming

The PRECISE reason that I continue to vote against splitting newsgroups

Yeah!  Me too.  I know that TeX has to read a file multiple times, but
that seems like a simple problem to work around.  If someone else
followed the original flame-fest to the end, could they summarize the
results for the rest of us that gave up?

I use _both_ TeX and FrameMaker, and I can see valid uses for both of
them.  I see advantages and disadvantages in each that aren't in the other,
(and vice versa).  IMHO, an editor that combines both would be way cool.

I know that this has been beaten to death already, I just wanted to know
what the obituary reads. :-)
