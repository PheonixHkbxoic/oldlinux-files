Right above this line is:

# Set it to -DSVGA_MODE=NORMAL_VGA if you just want the EGA/VGA mode.

If you read the man page for "vidmode", you will also see how
you can change it after you compile the kernel.

Hi all. I'm new of this newsgroup and maybe my question could
be an old question. Can I install Linux on the IBM ThinkPad 350?
I know that there are problems on some notebooks but I don't know
if my notebook is among these. Is a 120Mb HD enough for linux as
I need space for my DOS programs too?

If possible, replay by e-mail to geronimo@cs.pitt.edu

Similarly in bash, 'type -all command' (or 'type -a command').

In tcsh, 'where command' will do it.

Read the FAQ!

Linux does not work on MCA busses (ie PS/2)

also, this is a deaed newsgroup, post you questions to comp.os.linux.help

I would rate the first USENET posting about Linux more interesting.
(Back then I had just started reading comp.os.minix for information
*before* buying minix, but seeing the Linux 0.11 advertisement quickly
convinced me of not doing so.)

and then I'm remembering of the days...

... when there was no init, having to push reset after exiting the (only and
root) shell?

kernel was mainly untested for non-root users?

Seems to me they (the flames) are still around.

But what about remembering...

were praising this SLS 0.something for being *bug-free*? (sigh...)

One thing which I know will help is to find a copy of regexp.h from some

errors in Multilist.c and one other program which use the functions compile()

wound up doing was `make >& make.log` and then browsing the file, since
there's just too much information written to the screen to digest while

Basically, I managed to get enough of the library to compile to run the

This and a check to see that the kernel release and module driver release
are the same was implemented some time ago by Bas (but not yet publically
released).

Hopefully with a bit of further cleaning up modules will apear in a future
offical kernel release.

With this I'm not aware of any security or reliability problems not already

I have my linux+X system up and running in 40 Mb + user space.
Using the Slackware distribution, it is not to hard to get
an X windows linux system in under 40 Mb.  This is especially
easy if you don't want the c/c++ compilers and/or emacs.  
Even with c but not emacs, it is possible.  (with emacs, it
might be possible, but it would be very hard.)  
The SLS distribution does make it harder however.  

With the slackward distribution you need:
Boot disk
Disks A1-A14
X1-X5
This is a total of 20 disks, each holding 1.4 meg,
so you have around 30 meg installed & compressed.  
You don't need to install everything, so that after
compression, it works out to very close to 30 meg
and that gets you a very reasonable system.  If
you only have 4 meg ram, then you need to add another
6-8 meg of swapspace.

I run both OS/2 and linux in a 170 meg total hard disk
space.

Agreed, Linux Consortium is not a good name. Linux Review Group is
better, but it doesn't convey that only distributions are reviewed.
Linux Distribution Review Group is IMHO just too long.

As soon as these things are settled I'll make a call for volunteers
and choose a few testers.

Once we have approvals, we'll put together a small guide to getting
Linux for the inexperienced unconnected, including 'how to order' info
for the approved distributors. I think we should be able to get this
published or at least referred to in several magazines.

For the record; I have recieved a large number of positive responses
to this initiative. Criticism on news, raves in mail. Wish it was the
other way around. :-)

Some of the problems are because of the "development system" arrangement.
If one did not need/want that, it would save a lot of space be be rather
difficult to build kernals, no?

I have always wanted to see how small stuff can be made.  SLS installs
tons of stuff which one may not want, and can get rid of.  The main problem
is one could spend months getting things working perfectly and very small,
and then have to upgrade again to get new features.  This can often undo
a lot of what was done :(  (of course it can be done).

A problem for beginners and new intermediate users is that it can be very
difficult to know exact what can be removed without causing problems later.
I think one of the other Linux distributions has the ability to selectively
install just about everything (and remove them to?), kind of like "custom"
or "systemadmsh" in SCO and other Unixes.

X can take tons of space if not shaved down- look at all the fonts!!

If anyone is interested, I have built a distribution of

to have a couple folks grab it and make sure it works
fine on their machine.

It is built "out of the box" but this takes about 65 megs of
disk space so some folks might not have the room or the time
to do it themselves.  Once built it takes about 5 megs.

If you want to evaluate my distribution, drop me a line.
I cannot have the whole world doing anon ftp from my

I actually USED it yesterday on a 0.99pl13: Some nice guy at business with whom
I share the PC fiddled around with the partitions (for the use of NT, arghh).
Actually I did not have any boot/root combo or anything else to be able to
access my root disk, which has changed from hdb6 to hdb8. The only way to get
it back working was to change those offsets in my boot-diskette (YES I prefer
to have a boot diskette and not using LILO). I am glad that I still remembered

Linux works in my PS/2 model 70 using a Future Domain MCS-600 SCSI controller
connected to a Maxtor SCSI HD.  I didn't do anything special to make it
work.  I used the SLS 1.03 package.  Linux can't use the IBM hard drive
though.
