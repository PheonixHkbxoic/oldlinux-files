Well, here are the recommendations I received:


1 for MCC - basic. Good documentation. Stable

2 for SLS - easy install, stable

5 for Slackware - few problems, more user configurable, more up to date, easy
                  installation/setup, robust, correct file setup, complete,
                  better organization, better feedback

Not too many responses, but from what's been said in the group as well, it
looks like Slackware is the definite winner for newbies.

So the name is a collective noun, referring to the N+1 servers running under
Mach used to implement the thing?  I.e., it's a herd of servers, called
simply the hurd?

Mach on the Mac.  That was a list of platforms for the Mach 3.0 kernel.
Putting the Hurd on top of the Mach kernel is a separate issue.

        Hello,

There is a problem on tsx-11.mit.edu in the Xfree86-2.0 for Linux:

220 tsx-11 FTP server (Version wu-2.1b(17) Mon Aug 30 20:50:36 EDT 1993) ready.

This in the path described in the last "Linux XFree86-HOWTO" posted november 5.

I'll try sunsite.unc.edu.

This problem have been reported to ftp-linux@TSX-11.MIT.EDU

Yep, it does that, but I haven't run into a gopher client that's 
perfect yet.  ^C will cancel the ^Z nonsense - it would be nice
if ^Z would do a suspend, however.  In 2b4 there were many other
functional problems (like capfiles being disfunctional even when
you used the compiler directive to compile them in).

There are some people out there somewhere who've compiled some
of this stuff using ncurses.  I'd be kind of interested in 
seeing some of these conversions.  Any takers?

I've got a new-user question here.  I've down loaded SLS from an ftp 
sight and I'm trying to install it on an IBM PS/VALUE POINT and later
I'll be installing it on a Gateway 2000.  My question involves the first
disk in the set, a1.3.  I ftp'd the a1.3 file to my ULTRIX account and 
used the dd comand to copy it onto a 3.5" floppy.  No problem.  When I 
try to boot the IBM under LINUX, the system seems to stop after searching
for an AdLib sound board (ie. that's the last message it prints on the 
screen.)  Is this normal? I've let the machine sit for over ten minutes
but it doesn't do anything else.  Does anyone out there have any pointers
that might help me out here?

                        Thanks!

notes file that lets you browse collections of archives to see what's
available, along with its current status, and includes simple
instructions for compiling and installing an application.

Did you go through all the official channels to get the IP number for your machine? Most places are fairly strict about how you choose one.

Date: 12 Nov 1993 14:48:53 -0000

I'm look for arguments for or against setting up a Linux box as a *nix
server for 35-40 final year computer science students.

I'd appreciate any comments from anyone running Linux in a university / 
industrial environment, with the following points in mind:

        - What kind of hardware are you using ?

        - What kind of load is the machine under ?

        - How reliable do you find it ?

        - Why did (didn't ?) you choose Linux ?

        - Did you have any trouble convincing the 'powers that be'
          to pay for / install / allow the machine(s) ?

What I have in mind is setting up a machine administered by the students,
for use by students, for mail / news, project work where appropriate, and
to give the students who come forward to manage the system experience with
system administration before they are unleashed on the real world next summer
;-)

Any replies would be greatly appreciated.  If anyone wants to see a summary
posted let me now.
