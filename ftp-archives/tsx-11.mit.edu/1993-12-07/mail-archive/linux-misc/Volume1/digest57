The reason I went with the keycode approach was that I was also
swapping around the Escape and `~ keys, the Control and Caps Locks
keys.  It was easier just to crank up xev and to find out the keycodes
from that.  It isn't portable, but it does the job.  Your solution, at
least, is portable to all X implementations that have both a BackSpace
and a Delete key.

People have done this before and were told it would cost them EXTRA because
the company would have to spend time to UNLOAD it (several postings a few
months ago).  I think the overall situation in such cases does become
unethical; or whatever other word which would be better used.

Well I don't have any paperwork to support it but I have talked Face to

anything".  He then went on to explain that they did want it to stand for 
Windows Application Binary Interface. but their lawyers told them they
better not.  

P.S. this rep was giving a presentation for NASA at the time so I doubt
that he just made it up..

P.P.S He went on to to add that there was a group inside of SUN who wanted
to call the project Windows Application Binary Interface Technology.  That

Porting isn't just compiling so it will run; it includes running a validation
suite, and, in many cases, regression testing as well.

Of course, if Linux passed SVID or some other validation suite itself so
that software vendors could be guaranteed particular behaviours from
interfaces, and if it were possible to write to just those interfaces
to produce your applications, I suppose a port could be as simple as
compilation -- then again, you'd have to trust the compiler not to put
out code that did what you said and not what you meant (a great fault of
modern optimization assumptions).

In some industries, a port takes less than 2 weeks, and the testing can
take several months to validate -- especially if the validation is of a
source licensed product ported by the licensee but certified by the
licensor.

This is in line with ISO requirements for quality for products to be sold
in Europe right now, and many other countries are in the process of adopting
the same standards.

False.

(1)     Abstraction of interface from video hardware from applications
        means a good video driver in the kernel is a win.  Knowledge of
        the video hardware can be shared between multiple applications
        (X, PostScript, MGR, DOSEM, etc.) rather than coded into each
        one.  This saves reinventing the line draw each time.

(2)     Internationalization for Localization requires the ability to
        at *least* display alternate fonts (ISO8859-1 through ISO8859-9).
        This requires a more general interface.  For full support of
        internationalization, support must be provided for Kanji, Katakana,
        Hirugana, etc. (large glyph set written languages -- the alphabets
        needed for the full written language don't fit in 8 bits) and
        Hebrew, Arabic, Tamil, Devengari, etc. (ligatured languages which,
        due to porr design of standards, can't be rendered from 8 bit
        fonts even if they are coerced into 8 bits).  Font cell rendering
        is insufficient.

(3)     The inability to restore modes in a panic situation, since things
        like X servers and DOS emulators must be running to put the display
        back into a known state using the cooperative model requires state
        shadowing if the cooperation can't be had (for instance: running a
        kernel debugger).  The cooperative model also fails in DOSEMU when
        it is (a) run under virtual consoles (because the DOSEM didn't set
        the video modes, the application did, the DOSEM can't save and
        restore them on the vast majority of hardware) and (b) run against
        a pseudo video memory store to dislay the DOS session in an X
        window.

(4)     An integrated GUI buys you a common "look-and-feel" across all your
        applications -- thus reducing training costs, since training in one
        application generalizes to others.

(5)     NT's GUI is not integrated, it is a configuration option that is
        only turned on by default, not required to be on for the system
        to operate.  It's a false comparison in any case.

What do you make think that UPS is ported easily to Linux ?
It uses a, let's say, system-call like interface to the OS which is,
I am sure, completely different between both.

I agree it's the best C debugger I have seen, too.

That's one of the reason why I am not sure whether I will want Linux or
not.

I emailed the guy with the same problems with another sliding window
protocol and a Sun machine -- here's the gist of it:

1)      The input buffer is 128 bytes.
2)      The amount of bytes in a "window" is larger than 128.
3)      You get buffer overrun.
4)      Flow control can't help unless your packet size is smaller than
        your buffer size *and* smaller than the difference between the
        high and low wather marks *and* smaller than the difference
        between the high watermark and the end of the buffer.
5)      The exception to #4 is devices which behave in such a way as to
        suspend writes when flow-controlled.  Very few modems and fewer PCs
        and UNIX boxes do this because it means you can't have an interrupt
        driven serial driver with "write buffer empty" interrupts to trigger
        the next transmit -- the way most PC comms likes to implement fast
        serial I/O.

Zmodem (at least as Chuck Foresburg wrote it) is a sliding window protocol
and so falls into this category.

You can avoid *some* of these problems by:

1)      Run the serial driver at a real high priority compared to other
        things.
2)      Bump up the serial driver input queue so it's larger than the
        biggest window (SLIP and PPP generally do this).
3)      Bump the low water mark (where flow control is deasserted) in
        the driver way down.
4)      Write your program such that the reader is a seperate process
        and doesn't spend time doing anthing other than reads followed
        by an async IPC of the data to the processing part of the program.
        This will let you use the full window ACK as a flow control.

Hia ppl!

I'm a rather happy linux user. I know that linux is rather fixed upon pc's
(the kernel that is). Are there any efforts in porting it to other
architectures besides m68k?
I thought on that, cause there are new cool chips coming out or dropping
dramatically in price:

- the MIPS R3000 (there was a discussion somwhere in here, right?

- the PowerPC chip 601 .. this one will cost around 250$, has only a tiny bit
  less SPECint's than the pentium and is 30-40% faster than the pentium in
  FPU speed.

Well, first of all, there must be motherboards. Are there any? And if so:

Is it possible to port linux to these processors? The price of this
processors, esp the 601 added with the price of linux 8(0$) would form
a phantastic duo: a very fast machine running a great un*x for less money
than a 486/33 or even less!

Let me hear your voice :)

This is not true. In the US, copyright infringement that is "willful"
and done for commercial advantage or private gain *is* a federal offense
(17 U.S.C. 506(a)). Depending on the number of illicit copies produced and 
their retail value, the offense may either be a felony or a misdemeanor.

Under the Berne convention, I believe Linus had copyright protection from
the moment the first version of Linux was put on disk ("tangible expression").
Neither registration nor placing the copyright notice on copies is required
for protection anymore. Placing the notice prevents a violater from claiming
that the violation was "innocent" or "unintentional". Registration (in the
US) allows collection of "statutory" damages IN ADDITION TO "actual" damages. 
Registration costs $20.

Because the US and Finland are signatories to the Berne convention, Linus has 
the same protection under US copyright law as if he were a resident of, 
and had developed Linux in, the United States. 

Check the Copyright FAQ in news.answers for more information.

I don't think this is true. I think the only standard for criminal 
prosecution is whether or not the infringement was willful and done
for gain. The only thing registration affects is the *amount* of 
damages that can be collected in a civil suit. I believe that requiring
registration as a condition of criminal prosecution would be a violation
of the Berne convention (to which the US is a signatory).

Nope. Copyright infringement that is willful and done for gain *is*
a criminal offense under federal law. I believe the "Copyright Police" are 
known as the "FBI". They are reputed to be a rather humorless bunch. ;-)

The holder of the copyright *also* has the right to sue for damages.

Rick, who told you that copyright infringement wasn't a crime?

If the copies are sold or bartered, he can also get the Feds to throw
the SOBs in jail.

Putting people in prison tends to impede the rate at which they can generate
illegal copies ;-)

DIP is supposed to issue these commands for you through "system()" calls,
but the "route" commands that 3.2.2a issues in "attach.c" don't seem to be
appropriate to the pl12 version of NET-2.  I modified it slightly so that
it now issues the following route commands after you give the "mode SLIP"
command:

        route add $rmtip
        route add default gw $rmtip

This eliminates the "Network unreachable" errors on my box. (SLS 1.03
99pl12 of 8/19/93 at tsx-11).  ASCII and uuencoded patches follow.  Note
that these are applied against the source after application of the
earlier patch which generates 3.2.2a from the "net-010" sources.

Hope this helps,
