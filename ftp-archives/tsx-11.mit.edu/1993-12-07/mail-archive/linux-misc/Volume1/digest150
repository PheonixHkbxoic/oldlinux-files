I am currently running DOS with a Diamand Stealth w/ VRAM.  I am
planning/hoping to run Linux w/ X windows and I know my current card is
not supported.  So.. What video cards are supported that will give good
performance in Windows as well as Linux w/ X.  Local Bus is an option
and I would like to keep prices in the low $200s. Any suggestions are
welcome.

Thanks

Exactly what support does the kernel need to provide for EISA? I know that
there are Linux *device drivers* for EISA cards which, from reports,
work fine. The only limitation on using EISA under Linux that I've heard
about is that it wont do DMA to memory under 16M, which isn't a great
limitation given hardly anyone has more than 16M.

Thank you.  The disclaimer was to make it abundantly clear (if you couldn't
tell from the rest of the post :) ) that I'm not THE authority on SCSI.  I
certainly wouldn't want anyone to go plop down a bunch of money just because
someone said on the net that SCSI is great.

)
)# "scsi2", etc really ARE.  Better dig considerably deeper before you

)Always a good idea, but SCSI-2 is a fairly safe bet.  SCSI peripherals
)(before SCSI-2) allowed for too many differences in the interface (thus
)the old way of having a separate and a ...kinda proprietery SCSI
)interface for each manufacturer's devices... YUK!).  But with SCSI-2,
)the vast majority of drives are just plug and play.  The
)incompatibilities that one might find may be no worse than with any
)other standard.  IF YOU BUY SCSI and plan to use it for more than one
)specific peripheral BUY A SCSI-2 CONTROLLER (be sure it's SCSI-2, not
)just SCSI).  A SCSI-2 controller can talk to a SCSI (1) device, but
)very likely not the other way around.

)Fast, future expansion capability, God, printers and scanners are using
)these things now.  There's even SCSI standards that will let more than
)one computer share a SCSI bus (OK, Adaptec won't do that.. to my knowledge).

I really like the plug and play cabability of SCSI.  The DAT drive hooked
to the physics department's HP workstation works just fine on the NeXT in
the ACM office, or the RS/6000 upstairs, or (gasp) the Macintosh down the
hall.  Most of the unix workstation peripheral devices I've seen (I'm most
experienced with HP & NeXT) are SCSI.  I like widespread acceptance.

)# but there are costs.  Weigh them.  Then pay your

)Ouch, you know how to hurt a guy :-).

)Then again, it's not so bad except up front.  If you share your SCSI
)interface with CD, 2 or more hard drives, tape backup and maybe one
)more thing, the cost of the interface may end up saving you from buying
)tons of interface cards.  The nicer SCSI controllers will controll up
)to seven devices (3 bits, 1 id taken by the controller, leaves 7).

I know that it's harder (nearly impossible?) to do a low level format of a
SCSI drive than on an IDE drive.  Big deal.

I know that you have to (sometimes) work some magic when turning on
peripherals in a long SCSI chain to get all devices recognized.  This 
generally only happens if you have several devices on the SCSI chain.

)Now this I do disagree with.  God how I wish I could remember the review

)more recent) test (Maybe PC Mag?? was on stands last month) that showed

)
)Could you have had a particularly slow EISA SCSI?  I don't understand this.

)# #2 is cost.  You can get one heck of a decent system for less money.

)True enough.  One could argue from other points of view justifying the
)SCSI choice (which I made, and am impatiently waiting for), but this
)cannot be refuted.  IDE with inexpensive tape drive and a sound card
)with CD-ROM interface... cheap and works well.  (Anyone want a Colorado
)Memory Systems Jumbo 250?  Make me an offer, I'll be tempted to sell.)

Yes, you could go with something other than SCSI and pay less money (in the
short run, anyway). The ability to have multiple devices on a single SCSI
controller generally nullifies the extra expense of the controller.  And if
you want to upgrade your system in a couple years, odds are very good that
your already purchased SCSI devices can come with.  The odds are much less
likely on IDE.

)Tim said:
)# There are 3 types of SCSI-2 - fast SCSI-2, wide SCSI-2, and 
)# fast & wide SCSI-2.  Fast SCSI-2 is here now, and when most manufacturers
)
)Actually (insert standard disclaimers) SCSI-2 is a standard.  Wide and
)Fast are like extensions to SCSI-2, and they can go together.
)Peripherals can negotiate the protocol to use (although if you have a
)wide scsi peripheral, I think it cannot talk to a "narrow" scsi
)controller, although I suppose the peripheral could be made to be able
)to do that.  It would then just "agree" to not be "wide").

Ok.  That jogs my memory a bit.  That corresponds to what I've read (but
partially forgotten) about SCSI-2.

)# talk about SCSI-2 they really mean fast SCSI-2.  Wide SCSI-2 is just
)
)No, they mean normal SCSI-2, not fast.  Fast is 10MB/s whereas normal
)SCSI-2 is 5MB/s

Unfortunately, this isn't always the case.  At last Friday's computer fair,
Sun had a number of brochures for their workstations.  I grabbed one that
has the specs for a SPARCstation 10 (I think) on back.  The brochure states
that it has SCSI-2, but quotes a 10 MB/s transfer rate.  This would
correspond to fast SCSI-2, even though it's not listed that way.  I've seen
the same kind of thing with HP's literature.  Am I misinterpreting
something?

This might be a dumb question... but here goes:
is there any way to use NMP protocols from within Linux ?
I'd rather use modem connection from my home Linux then use
any DOG vt100 emulators, but some of them do support MNP.

Is MNP commercial ?

Would slip be any faster ? (why use it if it's not ? just the
"joy" of using pseudo TCP/IP ?

As far as I know there is an drive for floppy tape streamers

As an aside I would like to say that we should not talk fo

The signal interface is defined in (QIC-117 - hope that's right,
i don't have my QIC interface list at hand). 

For the same reason you talk of QIC-02 interfaces and not of
QIC-24, QIC-150 and so on. I'am not even sure wether the floppy
tape drive uses the QIC-80 format - to me it would not make sense
because - for backup purposes - QIC-80 is overspecified.

I have similar problems.  I get a HD timeout every once in a while.  I think
mine is being caused by a cheap IDE contoller.  When I replace my controller
with my brother's I never see the error.  Also, if I set by clock to 8Mhz
(I am running a 386sx, as if it wasn't slow enough already...) and I never see
the error.  The easy answer for me would be to buy a new controller, but I
think I will look at some of the timings in hd.c to see if I can't get it to
work with my current hardware.

in Hamburg/germany.

I have seen a test of a Gigabyte Eisa/VL board but with 
SIS-chipset ( this board had a pretty fast memoryinterface).

If you have any information on the following questions 

please mail:     guldager@daimi.aau.dk.

How is the compatibility ? 
Is the Eisa-bus fully 32 bit ?
Will ATI's Graphics Ultra Pro run with this chipset ?

How is the EISA performance ?
How is the VL performance ?
How is the memory performance ? 
 ( maybe testet with Cachemess from the German CT'magazin ? )


Thanks.

I noticed that when I was running on GMT time with the EDT conversion
that my time was not right always.  For file stamping and a lot of programs
(utree for example, w/time in the header) it worked.  However, I noticed
that Revision Control System (RCS) would never get the right conversion.
It always got GMT and used that instead.  So, at midnight local when I
did a checking with RCS, it dated the file 4am.  All other times that I
remember were correct.  Since I use RCS all the time this was a big deal
to me so now I run local time, having renamed /usr/lib/zoneinfo to something
else.  Everything works perfectly now, I just have to remember to do the
time changes myself.  No big deal anyway.  Have to set the clock a few times
per year as it is.

with setkbd but it asked for files I don't know where they are.
The README file is not very clear for me.
same problem with the doc of X11, I haven't found the doc for my video card,
to change the clock parameter and so.

Any help greatly apreciated, if any one around here is using a NCR 77C22E 
video card and have a runing Xconfig file, send it to me via email.

I would prefer email answers if any, there's a lot of trafic in this newsgroup

Thanx a lot
