I've got this little game for MessyDos, in which you program (in a somewhat 
simplified version of C) a robot to fight in an arena with another 3 robots.
The four robots wander around the arena, acting only according to their
pre-programmed CPU's.

Does anyone know what game I am talking about, and if so, is there a Linux
version of it floating around anywhere? I know that there is least a 
MessyDos version and an Ameagre version floating around.

   I'm looking for a cdrom with a 'recent' linux kernal.  Also,  I'd like to
   be able to 'run' from the cdrom.  To make things interesting, the cdrom
   drive is a panasonic 562b running off my Soundblaster 16asp.

The Nascent CDROM has over 400 mbytes of source code, binaries, and
documentation for the Linux operating system and applications.  It
features the Linux 0.99.13 kernel with all the currently available
cdrom drivers (including the SoundBlaster Pro), magic and spice
electronic design tools, over 100 high resolution images translated
from Kodak PhotoCD(TM), Xwindows and OpenLook, Ingres database
management and spreadsheet, TeX and ghostscript, and much more.
Automated installation, system and network administration scripts are
included.

  Version 1.0 is now available for $39.95 plus shipping and handling,
and comes with a 30 day money back guarantee.  VISA/Mastercard, checks
or money orders accepted.  The Nascent CDROM announcement, order form,
and cdrom file listing are available for anonymous ftp at
netcom.com:/pub/nascent.

Yes it sounds like the problem was more serious than I  thought.  Nearly
everyone that has contacted me has told me I should have still had both
keyboard input and a mouse cursor.  Since I didn't, there is either a  
significant bug, or I did something stupid that I haven't realized yet.
So, I'll try setting up a test partition to see if this problem is easily
reproducable, or was just a fluke.  Then I'll try to figure out if this
is a problem with xfree2.0 or 0.99pl13p and notify the appropriate people
of what I find.

        I sent some email to the original poster offering to send him a
copy COD if he'd send his physical mail address.  Yggdrasil ships all
US orders by UPS Red, so the original poster would have received his
order by 10:30am tomorrow if he had responded.

        We have gone to great lengths to ensure quick delivery of
LGX to everyone who wants it.  We are continuing to automate our
shipping and order processing operations.  Because of our shipping
volume, we were able to arrange with United Parcel Service to locate
an Air Letter Center physically inside our office suite last week.
This has enabled us to push back our 6pm Eastern/3pm Pacific cut-off
time for next day delivery and to have the delivery done by 10:30am
the next day instead of 2pm.  As you might expect, our $5 shipping
charge does not come close to covering the Next Day Air delivery
that we include at no additional charge for our US domestic orders.
In fact, having a UPS Air Letter Center doesn't on the premises
doesn't save us any money in comparison to Federal Express (which
is what we would otherwise be using), but but it does increase our
quality and efficiency of service.

        Also, to make shipping more reliable and faster, we began
experimental use of a system whereby your UPS Red tag is printed while
you are on the phone.  In addition, starting tonight, we are adopting
an experimental policy of making everyone leave by 7pm, in the hopes
that this will result in people coming in earlier so that fewer calls
spill over to our 24-hour order taking service.

        Yggdrasil has shipped almost 9,000 copies of LGX Fall 1993 in
the past five weeks.  That is more than all of the Linux CD's shipped
by everyone previously, including us.  Consider that if a vendor ships
200 CD's and 0.5% of the people experience something that causes them to
post to the net, you will see 1 posting.  If 0.5% of our customers decided
to post to the net, you'd see postings from about 45 different people.

        It is unfortunate that some orders have apparently slipped through
the cracks.  We pride ourselves on fast efficient service and we have
been taking concrete steps to improve service since long before the
posting which began this thread.

        We accept American Express and Optima, and I assure you that they
would land on us even harder than Visa and MC if there were a problem.
We are working on accepting Visa and MasterCard, but it is difficult
right now if your charges are 100% mail order, you sell software, and

You can also use the -s flag of lpr to make a symbolic link to the data file

  I just installed XFree86 2.0 and pl13o of the kernel.
I am currently using the most recent version of tvtwm and everything
works just fine until I try to access the pull down menus by using the
mouse on the root display.  Once I try, the entire computer locks up!
I can't do anything at that point except reboot.

  I didn't have these problems with XS3.

"Don't dream it, be it."

I'm big fan of the GNU project, and have worked on and with various pieces of
GNU software since about 1986.  But this this is a little overboard.  I've
been hearing about Hurd for years, and the story has always been that the
design was pretty much complete, the implementation was nearly debugged, and
"outside" suggestions and help wasn't welcome.

This seemed to be confirmed when the "official" GNU people weren't interested
in Linux.  I heard statements that Hurd was going to be so much better that it
wasn't worth working on Linux.

Luckily I only listened for a while.  Eventually I thought for myself and
decided to give up the narrow-minded view that the officially-sanctioned Hurd
would be _the_ Free OS.  Linux is reliable, complete, fast and innovative.
Yes, you read that: innovative.  The innovation might not be obvious at first
because Linux doesn't start by throwing away traditional interfaces just for
the sake of doing things differently.  Instead it conforms to open, de-facto
standards wherever it makes sense. 

To echo the converse of earlier Hurd vs. Linux conversations: let's put the
Hurd work over in the corner with the Lisp Machines.

I'm not bitterly opposed to it, but I'm coming to the conclusion that the
'bpf' functionality should not be provided by the kernel, but should be in a
(hopefully little-used) compatibility library.

For those not in the know: 'bpf' (the Berkeley Packet Filter) is an mechanism
for specifying to the kernel networking layers what packets you are interested
in.  It's implemented as a specialized stack language interpreter built into a
low level of the networking code.  An application passes a program written in
this language to the kernel, and the kernel runs the program on each incoming
packet.  If the kernel have multiple 'bfp' applications, each program is run
on each packet.

The problem is that it's difficult to deduce what kind of packets the
application is really interested in from the packet filter program, so the
general solution is to always run the filter.  Imagine a program that
registers a 'bpf' program to pick up a low data-rate stream sent to a
multicast address.  Most ethernet cards have a hardware multicast address
filter implemented as a 64 entry hash table that ignores most unwanted
multicast packets, so the capability exists to make this a very inexpensive
operation.  But with the BFP the kernel must switch the interface to
promiscuous mode, receive _all_ packets, and run them through this filter.
This is work, BTW, that's very difficult to account back to the process
requesting the packets.

They really aren't comparable, except from the `narrow-minded-view' 
of them sharing a common ancestry, Unix.  Furthermore, there doesn't have to be
_a_ free O.S..

Linux is fast and mostly reliable, but architecturally it is just
another Unix (and yes, I've been using Linux a long time).  There are
`innovative' approaches in Linux, like the fast networking, the
/proc filesystem extensions, the expanding body of shared libraries,
etc.. but the overall architecture is pretty much the same.

Read mib's paper of the Hurd architecture before making inappropriate
comparisions.

I'll take the FSF's word for it if they think they can get more
done on the kernel in isolation.  It is just one component of the
O.S., after all.  In the long run the fact that device drivers, filesystems,
etc, developed outside the kernel will enable more users to aid
in development.

Linux may have thousands of users, but there aren't more than a few kernel
developers.  The marginal benefit of a few part time developers
early on has to be weighted against the heavy burden of support.  
I'm amazed that Linus, Eric, and H lu, Donald and the rest
have the patience they do.  It certainly isn't anyone's place to
expect it from them, or the FSF, just for the sake calming everyones
curiousity.
