   I have been contacted by a representative of the SimCity development
team, Bob Adams.  He indicated that they may be interested in a Linux
port of SimCity, but he has a few questions regarding the size of the
Linux user base, etc.

   Please watch for his upcoming post in this newsgroup.

   This is an excellent opportunity to validate Linux as a viable OS.  I'm
not saying that a port of one commercial game/simulation is the defining
metric by which viable OS's are judged, but this could be the first step
in getting other 3rd party vendors to notice Linux.

If you run term as root, tredir will break - it will bind the wrong
ports and you won't be able to telnet on these. This is an error in
Linux (0.99.12 but I suspect it is carried over from at least 0.99.9.)
See my posting "bind() is broken" for an explanation.

Subject: bind() is broken
Date: 9 Sep 1993 01:18:05 GMT

Just wondering why my tredir suddenly stopped working, I found out
following really annoying kernel bug: if bind() on a given port # is
called by root, it will assign an arbitrary port #, like when it is
called with port 0. It won't bind the intended port but rather some
other (making things worse, it will happily pick that from the
privileged port numbers).

This only happens when called as root. An ultra-quick look at the
source seems to tell me that I'm right and some checks on the port
numbers are commented out and/or marked as "buggy". Apparently the bug
is carried over from at least the 0.99.9 version, i.e. from the Net-1
version...  (But now we have netstat to see it...)

Anyone working on that problem?

That's not an "unexpected interrupt", that's a "read-only file system" or
similar.

My job would be much easier if I could point to some organization that

Shipped in '81.  I started to work at HP then; HP ordered one

Which is why I sometimes wonder if future computers (at least for the

...yes, and there are a lot of patches that should/could be sent through

Matt -- is there any reason why you can't bounce articles like the afore-

are not obligated to do so, and that it means more time that you will spend

Perhaps just doing this for a short term would make people realize that 
col.ann was meant for more than "announcements".

Alternatively, someone (anyone) else could just forwarard any such postings
that they spot directly to linux-announce@tc.... but this would mean more

I heard that INTEL had a larger number of support chips for the 8088/86.
If IBM had wanted to go with he 6800[08] they would have had to gone by 
using 6800 type perifial chips, thus async bus ( and we might have been in
deeper do-do today). Supposedly Intel had a full set of periphial chips,
tuned for 808x,  while Motorola had only a few. 

Another reason might have been that Motorola seem to belive in well
defined and spec'ed buses while Intel don't which is a cheaper
solution. Motorola came out with the first VME spec in this time
periode which might indicate that they had aimed for other markets
with the 68K, thus higher end, higher performance.

In hindsight it is of course clear that the 68K is a much cleaner
and better design, somebody commented that the 68K could address 16Meg
Vs 1 meg on the 808x. Not quite the 68K has a 32 bit address space, while
only 20 of teh 32 address bits was carried externally. the 808x is 
limited to 1 meg both interally and externally.

IBM made a marketing decision and not an architecure decision,
they wanted to push the PC ASAP, and they could achieve a sooner lauch date 
by going with intel.

Another thing is that they probably didn't expect the PC to last as
long as it did, what had been the average life cycle on the previous 
micros? Apple II did last long. 

STrange, IBM made rash marketing decisions before that cost them, THey
where in the progress of developing a new main frame (i don't remember
which) and while in prototype production they decided they had to push
it some half a year ahead of schedule. They asked the HW people if it
could be done, they said "yes, if they got  more money and people"
they asked the OS people who said "No".  Management said "you have to
you can have any resource you want", but the reply was "No, debugging
can't be speeded up by hireing  more people."
THe management sacked the whole OS dept. and hired a new one, the 
system was shiped ahead of schedule, but the OS never really worked
properly. 

Another classic story is that Xerox had the while windowing and
iconing system developed, and made teh policy decicion that they were
in the paper business and not in the information business, and gave
the whole thing to Steve Jobs, who then took it and made an apple.

The moral seems to be, keep management out of teh architecture
decisions, and long term planning.

        Look at all the resistance to Solaris vs SunOS. Netware 4.0. And
Lotus still supporting 123 V2.X and 123 V3.0.
        Indeed that would probably be a more effective way to kill OS/2 than
Chicago. Just slowly creep Win3.1 to 3.2 with small but important improvements
(and of course difficult incompatibilities for WinOS2). Produce Excel and Word
versions that only can run under Win3.2.
        If Chicago is too different from Win3.1, companies like Gateway will
give the user a choice: 3.1 or Chicago, like they did with DOS 4 vs DOS 3.3.
But make a Win3.2 and everybody will flock to it.

Hi.

Re: Linux 0.99pl11 SLS1.03 Shared Libraries

I have noticed that a number of linux libraries are shared type,
libc.so.4.4.1, et al. I have been trying to port a later revision
of Tcl/Tk to that distributed with SLS 1.03 but I cannot build the
library shared. It seems that the assembler /bin/as (gas 1.38) does
not understand the output from cc -fPIC (gcc 2.4.5).

So,
Q1: How were the linux shared libraries built?
Q2: Where can I pick up the required versions of as/ld to do it?
Q3: What is the relationship between libxxx.so.nnn and libxxx.sa?
    I only know how to do SunOS 4.1 style and Solaris 2 style, I'd
    hoped the Sun method would work for linux, i.e.
     cc -fPIC *.c
     ld -assert pure-text -o libxxx.so.nnn *.o
    At present I can't get past the compile stage
Any help gratefully received.
