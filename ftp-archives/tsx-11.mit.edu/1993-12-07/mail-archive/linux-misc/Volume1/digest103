I have decided to enter the exciting world of LINUX !

I have a CDROM and would like to know the best place to purchase
Linux operating system ! 

I recently heard about Jana Publishing and it seems like a good
deal ... I would like to hear from anyone who has dealt with
Jana.

Please e-mail your response .. and I will post a summary.

Thanks in advance.

And at the time IBM, Intel, and MicroSoft made much of the fact that they
were designing it all to be backward compatible to the greatest degree
possible, and that they would continue to do so with future designs.

Since I'm a techie type, I understood what a stupid move that was!  They
would be held up for years before the best technology would be usable in
such a system!  Terrible idea!

Of course they all made millions because they did it that way, and most
of those who did what I *knew* was technically the right way to go...
went broke.

Well...  they are *still* technically behind.  And I bet they cry all
the way to the bank about it too!

Yup. Me. I am in the process of porting it. (It is re-compiling now.

The ez editor works, help works. In fact, everything except a program
called 'sched' works. I have no idea what 'sched' does. :)

let me know if you want binaries. I'll drop them on sunsite if there
is interest. I have no idea just how large the binaries will be.
Figure at least 30 megs. (there is a large number of dynamicly loaded
objects).

I've got the same problem but no solution.
On my Intel 386/33 linux works fine, but on my AMD 386/40 it has the problem
to detect a copro where noone is :-(

maybe a problem in the routine for detection.

Huh??? First of all, putting a computer  -  any computer  -  on the same
circuit with large electric motors is just plain stupid.  I can't imagine
a factory actually doing this.  If they do, maybe they should stick to
DOS, they probably shouldn't use computers at all :-)

The file-system integrity problem is due to disk cacheing  ...  you'll have
the same problems if you use a disk-cacheing package under DOS/Windows.  
At least with Unix you have a good chance of fixing your problems with fsck.

Another bit of overkill :-( apparently mailx is a port of BSD's Mail. The 
version on sunsite includes binaries but uses sendmail for delivery. I
don't need it on a stand-alone system. Unfortunately, you can't switch
between mail.local and sendmail without recompiling.

Hello.

Has anyone got some information on UMC's EISA/VL chipset. 
Are there any testreports ?

How is the compatibility ? 
Fully 32 bit DMA ?
Will ATI's Graphics Ultra Pro run with this chipset ?

How is the EISA performance ?
How is the VL performance ?
How is the memory performance ? 
 ( maybe testet with Cachemess from the German CT'magazin ? )


I would also like to have some information on a 
DTC 3270 VL - SCSI 2 controller from Data Tecnology Corporation.

Are there any testreports ?
How is the compatibility ?
Can it do VL-Busmastering/ VL burstmode DMA ?
( I suppose that this is the 32bit DMA on the Vesa Local bus )
How is the performance ?
( compared to Adaptec 1742 / Ultrastore 34F )


Has anyone run Linux or OS/2 on these components ?


Please E-mail to guldager@daimi.aau.dk

Well, DOS needs a software interface to the real hardware (basic 
input/output system) while it runs. In a way, DOS is just a shell
around the BIOS capabilities (program loading, sector input and
output, character input and output to various devices), and is *not*
able to run without the services of the BIOS it depends on, including
but not limited to the initial program load.

I have no idea, and don't consider the answer to this question to 
be essential for the question whether IRIX is an OS or not. 

But I have a better example: AIX, which is a Unix variant for
IBM RISC workstations (formerly RT, now RS/6000, if I'm not mistaken)
doesn't access any hardware at all while it runs, because it runs on top 
of a software layer which hides the hardware completely.

Of course it does. It uses DOS as a bootstrap loader and replaces most
of its functionality. It's not a perfect replacement, because it 
still uses DOS for logical disk access. On the other hand, it runs
DOS in virtual 8086 mode as one of many tasks and is able to handle
disk IO internally for certain disk controllers, so one could argue that
even in that area Windows is the resource manager in control, not DOS ...

The fact that they don't use the *BIOS* (which is restricted to 
real mode operation on non PS/2 hardware) is much more important. 

Neither NT nor OS/2 completely replace the functionality of DOS,
because both implement a large part of that functionality, just
for compatilibility purposes. Most of this is probably done simply
by using polished and slighlty modified original DOS source
code (or some translation there of).

It still relies on DOS for some of its functions (well, for a single
one, but that's not important), but the list of functions where
it completely *replaces* DOS by managing the resource in question
itself - and in a very different way - is much longer:

CPU (task management),
Keyboard, 
Serial ports and parallel ports,
Pointing device, 
Video display hardware,
Printing devices,
Memory,
Audio hardware.

Well, I would say if Windows runs in protected mode, Windows is the
base OS which continues to run DOS in a virtual machine in order to be
able to provide some of its services, and for compatibility.

DOS is a real mode operating system and is not able to run protected
mode applications.

No. By your argumentation, DOS by itself isn't an OS either, because it 
needs an IBM compatible BIOS beneath. You can't have it both ways.

I've got all the nifty groff stuff that came with the SLS-1.03, but it

I looked around with "find" and have deduced that I need a directory called

So, where do I find this directory?  (...and why wasn't it included in SLS?)
