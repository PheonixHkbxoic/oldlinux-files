There is no man page for GNU tar at the moment.  If you read the
documentation that comes with the package, it says that there will be one
included with the next release.  If you're really stuck, get the man page
from another unix system.  The main functions (at least) are the same.

   Hey, there's nothing wrong with NeWS - I know the guy who ported

preferred using postscript to any other widget set.

  Of course, this is the fellow who wrote a vt-100 emulator in

It won't, bind() is not broken. To make it short, I screwed up my file
systems and confused two older versions of term, and got a nonworking
term binary as result. So the bind() confusions were exclusively my fault.

Apparently I owe the network people an apology. :-)

NeWS was a wonderful idea.  Unfortunately, any display manager that starves
every other process on the system while realizing/rendering/whatever-the-
proper-word-is-for-whatever-the-heck-its-doing-while-updating-the-display
isn't going to make it in the real world....

I've got the tar file for ix/MBox for Linux on sunsite.unc.edu.

Fixed it up and it compiled.

The problem is that I created an anonymous user id called 'bbs'
so the public may dial in and use the BBS.

But for some reason, ix/MBox always uses the last user name when
logging in.

For example, I create a 'test user' on the BBS, then when I login
again via 'bbs', I get 'test user' back!

Anyone successfully running ix/MBox?

Subject: Problem installing LINUX with OS/2 2.1
Date: Sun, 12 Sep 1993 01:36:32 GMT

I was trying to install LINUX (the latest SLS release) on a disk where OS/2
2.1 has been installed.  When I tried to format the linux partition with
mke2fs, error always occurs.  The following is how I did it (according to
the instructions in OS/2 manual and LINUX faq):

1.  installing OS/2 2.1 and making the following partitions on the hard 
    disk (405 Mb IDE drive) with the OS/2's fdisk:
        a.  Boot manager: 1 Mb
        b.  Linux partition: 120 Mb  (on or not on boot manager menu, 
              unformatted)
        c.  DOS/WIN partition: 50 Mb (on boot manager menu, FAT)
        d.  OS/2 partition: 80 Mb (logical partition for OS/2 boot, HPFS)
        e.  OS/2 partition: 150 Mb (logical partition, HPFS)

2.  installing DOS 6/WIN 3.1

    (Every thing was fine to this point)

3.  installing LINUX:
        a.  using OS/2 fdisk to set the linux partition as installable
        b.  rebooting from the LINUX installation floppy disk (SLS a1)
        c.  using LINUX fdisk to change the linux partition ID to 83
            (for LINUX Ext)  (Is id 83 a right choice?)
        d.  rebooting or skipping reboot (which made no difference)
        e.  mke2fs -c /dev/hda3 123060 (hda3 is the LINUX partition 
            prepared by OS/2, 123060 is the size in block shown from 
            the LINUX fdisk table)

Finally, I got "mke2fs: Unable to find a block for the inode table."
Did I miss something?  Any help would be appreciated.

My system is a 486 DX2-66 with 16 Mb RAM if that helps to clarify.

this is a joke right ? Even today 16M of physical memory is enough for most of
the systems and apps. Also there is nothing implicit in the software architecture 
of 68000 which creates a 16MB limit. The only problem is that the chip has 24 address
lines and it is in no way reflected to the software. All the address registers are 
32 bits. The moment you upgrade to a 32 bit address bus, you get all the 4G space.

Again there is nothing implicit in 68000 which requires such an implementation.
This is because of the brain-dead design of Apple. They didn't want to use 32 bit
offsets and their compiler generates jumps only with 16 bit offsets so the problem
of 32K segments. 

> quite similar to the 286s 64K segmenting, without bounds checking and, 

but unlike a 8086 vs 286 comparison, there is no mode switching in 68000 family.
68000 doesn't force you into using only 16M, it keeps all the 32 bits addressing
info. Of course if you are dumb and use the top byte of the address for book-keeping
(against the advise of Motorola, saying that 32 bit processors are on the way)
then you deserve all you get and have to wait for "32 bit clean" software to run on
your Quadra.

Also 286 forces you into only these 3 segment cache registers at any time and only 
8K segment tables.  So at any point in time, your window of the world is limited to 
196K of your all possible space and changing any of these segment cache registers
takes MILISECONDS. (maybe tens of miliseconds). So the brain-dead segmented architecture
of 286 is not very usefull. I agree that hardware bounds checking maybe usefull but not
with the limitations of 286 (64K size and only 3 caches); maybe not even with 386 (which only
solves one of the problems (This requires another discussion: In x86 family, all the new 
modes of the CPU (286 protected mode and 386 32 bit mode) are all incompatible with
previous modes. You can't run some real mode sw in PM and you can't even switch the stupid
286 back to real mode without hardware resetting the thing. I think nobody can argue that
the x86 family of processors was the worst problem we have had in the last 10 years.)

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is very true. These limitations have nothing to do with 68000 family. It 
is all in the limited imagination of Apple.

Subject: Probable SLS 1.03 Kernel BUG
Date: 11 Sep 1993 20:30 PST

Bill Javurek (javurek@garnet.msen.com) reported difficulties with umount-ing
floppies; getting a device busy message. I too have seen this problem,
only my problem is worse than Bill reported.

Problem: Files systems won't "umount" following certain operations.
Kernel: Stock SLS 1.03 and rebuilt 1.03 kernel
File systems exhibiting problem: ext2 (on IDE) and minix (on floppy);
        others not tested.
Symptoms: Following certain operations it is impossible to "umount" the
        file system.
Impact: Even using the bootutils-0.1 and careful shutdowns, file system
        corruption has occasionally occured.
To Reproduce:
        (boot and login as root, mount an (expendable) FS)
        # /etc/umount <FS>              <== verify it umounts!
        # /etc/mount -t <type> <dev> <mount point>
        #cd <mount point>
        # emacs test.test
        <create some text and write out the text; exit emacs>
        # cd /
        # /etc/umount <mount point OR dev>   <== should get device busy!
        # logout                             <== rest is optional
        <login as root>
        # /etc/umount <mount point OR dev>   <== no help!
Fix: Get the original (i.e. straight from Linus) 0.99pl12 distribution,
        patch it with Linus's patch, and rebuild the kernel. Adding
        the sound driver is safe.
Other Info: I rebuilt the SLS 1.03 kernel turning off most all the patches
        put into the SLS 1.03 kernel except the sound driver and file
        quotas and still had the problem. I tried to turn off the quotas
        but the "ld" failed with a missing symbol so I had to reconfigure
        and rebuild! The umount problem remained. I can ante-up my
        kernel "config" file if needed, but the stock SLS 1.03 kernel also
        exhibits the problem.

I urge others out there verify this.

OK, what you evaluate here may be correct in terms of math, but you have to

of computation time, so your above 122 clocks result can't really be derived

c't 4/90 p. 162 f. (published in German) which states the following relative
speeds  (with intel 80387, 25 MHz, no cache as 100%) :

Cyrix Fasmath 25 MHz                146 %       284 %      Mandelbrot (ovrAll)
Intel 486     25 MHz                130 %       443 %      real
(25 was a lot at the time ;) )      152 %       197 %      trigon & logarithm
                                    112 %       448 %      Matrix
let me just say that appearantly the measurement conditions are seemingly ok.

So, according to this, you say correctly that performance over 387 is 4 times,
except at special arithmetic (triLog), where it is only 20 % ,roughly.

Now, caching comes into play: Since Cyrix is an I/O device, there should be
now queue flushing when FLOAT ops are encountered.

That is to say that external caching improves float performance linearily.
Since 20% less performance already take into account the 8K onchip RAM of 486,
I do not find it hard to imagine that a cached 386/Cyrix FasMath can overtake
a 486 at particular operations, given the current design problems with
486 Boards (writeBack and such).
Yet, in general, it is hardly feasible to get onchip-integration-comm-speed
(like internal 486/487) with on-PCB integration (like Cyrix 486S + CoPro).
Nonetheless, I believe that a Cyrix machine really is nice silicon to put
in a socket...
