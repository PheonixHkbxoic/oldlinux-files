A 14.4 Modem will usually need to communicate with the UART of
the PC with at least 19200 bits/sec, better are 38400. If you don't
have a FIFO in the UART, that means an interrupt every 500 or even
250 us. If you don't serve it in time, you lose characters and
have to ask the other side to retransmit ===> your throughput goes
to zero, and your telephone company will get rich.

So you need an UART with FIFO eg. 16550A/AF/AFN. The 16550s without
A are IMHO early models where the FIFO doesn't really work.

When I see this, and further comments, I believe you should _not_
have done any homework (however nice it was from you to do it),
because the usenet addresses seem to be far too irregular for you
to ever succeed in a sensible amount of time.

My suggestion: Let anybody who wants to be registerred for a
country add an _optional_ [countrycode] somewhere to the subject.

While you're at it, you might consider adding +n to the voting
which means "I know n people who use Linux but can not mail you".
The count of these must be kept separate and will contain duplicates.

So e.g. somebody from sub.org who knows 5 other people who use
Linux but can not e-mail to you would write:

Subject: [de] I use linux at home +5

All these additions should be optional and may be put either at the
beginning or the end, of course.

I had purchased a Zeos 486/33 in Spring 1992 with the intention of running
Unix System V Release 4 with X Window 11 Release 5.  My Zeos box worked fine
until I brought it in for a minor maintenance job (which was a virus on
my Unix boot drive!).  After I got my machine back I noticed that Zeos did
a free upgrade of the video BIOS.  I had a Diamond SpeedStar.  Now I have
a Diamond SpeedStar Plus.  This sort of screwed up my X386 timings.  To
compound matters a little more, the NEC 4fg monitor I used before the BIOS
switch had a small convergence problem so I traded it for a NEC 3fgx.
Bad move.  Timing problems again.  I finally got my video sync timings ok
after a year of fiddling.  I don't get *any* flicker under X at 1024x768
but I get it under MS-Windows at the same resolution.

Overall, I am satisfied with the Zeos machine.  Yes, it falls short of the
Sun SPARCstation I like to use, but it feels good to have a full-blown Unix
machine at home that I can afford.  But don't complain about Zeos.  Instead,
THE FULL BLAME SHOULD BE DIRECTED TOWARD DIAMOND.

  My resolver is not working properly.  It is only using the host table and
not the resolv.conf info.  Because of this the sendmail (smail) is trying
to uucp everything that is not in the host table.

  Is this a linux feature?  Does anyone have it working?  How can I get

I have this theory that Linus Torvalds is not a real person at all!
"Linus" is in fact a persona created (perhaps by a group of graduate
students) to project this aura of superhuman. After all, no one
person can do all this. Yes, I know I have e-mailed to Linus a few
times and "he" is a great guy and all that; but it is just front.

(Of course this is meant as a joke, but remember Hitchcock's

Shhhh!  You're not supposed to let that out!  We're waiting for the famous
USL lawsuit to come to trial, at which USL claims their intellectual
property is worth how many _millions_ of dollars?  But it was all duplicated,
ab initio, by one college kid in a year of spare time!  [maybe ab

   I disagree.  ( Surprising, eh? ;-)  Most people that I've encountered in

fed up when they can't figure out what to do, and then go look at the
manual.  Eventually, they learn that it's a good idea to at least *skim*
the manual before trying something new, at least if they value their

   I find it highly unlikely that the people who are asking the silly
questions in *this* group don't know what Unix is.  Well, I have to 
qualify that - I've seen a couple of posts asking more or less "what is
Unix?"  But that's still irrelevent when the person obviously has *some*

spending their money if they don't use the most basic tools of their

   Ahhhhh.... but you've just noted that it starts them thinking.  That's 
the *MOST* important first step.  The qualification about looking stupid
is invalid when it comes to USENET.  We're using the most effective
means of anonymous communication ever devised.  I'm a great believer in the
effectiveness of making people uncomfortable to force them into
certain socially acceptable behavior patterns.  Just think of how many more
kids would be in trouble if they weren't "uncomfortable" using drugs,
drinking to excess, and having sex in front of their parents.  It works
the same way for adults, as well.
