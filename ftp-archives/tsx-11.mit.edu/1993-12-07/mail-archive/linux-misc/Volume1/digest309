        I recently put in 16M in 4M simms, and am using 4M in 1M simms from my
bank of 8 that I used to run with.  The BIOS recognizes and tests all 20M of my
memory....yet free returns that there is only a little over 15M (I realize the
15M is due to the kernel being in ram, and apparently Linux thinks there's a
total of 16M memory.  I've played with a lot of different options in the BIOS,
and I have all ROM shadowing turned off except for the system ROM ... I have
tried with both Memory above 16MB Caceable: Yes, and No ... and neither seems
to have effect.  I'm running pl12 still (cause it's been a lot more stable
for me than pl13), and I compiled it with Limit Memory to Low 16MB: n


Any suggestions?

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.

When configuring the kernel (via "make config"), you get a question:

        Limit memory to Low 16MB

Answer "no" to this question.  It makes life more complicated for the SCSI
drivers, but probably still is, what you want.

i think you will find that you can ftp the SLS distribution from
  src.doc.ic.ac.uk
i don't know which directory but it's prob something like 
 /operating-systems/Linux/packages/SLSor something like that. the SLS is a very 
 complete distribution. and seems pretty stable to me.

This will work (and yes, the IDE has to be the boot drive).  I don't
know that I'd go this route, simply because it leaves you with a drive
you can't get to.  Also, unless you get one of the more expensive IDE
boards, your CPU is going to have to be intimately involved in disk
accesses and this will slow you down, particularly under multitasking
OS's like UNIX derivatives, NT, OS/2, etc.

Yes, this works.  However, it works a lot better with SCSI.  Once
again, the problem is the involvement of the CPU in data transfers for
IDE. 

: 3.)  Add another SCSI adapter card (EISA or VESA ?)  Then get a second SCSI

I would do this, moving the current SCSI drive.  Multiple SCSI drives
with multiple swap (one on each drive) tends to be a big win under
most sorts of UNIX, so you may still want to buy a second SCSI drive.
Multiple SCSI is typically not a problem.  I'm currently running an
IDE (of the cheap variety) plus two SCSI controllers.

It makes a big difference if you happen to have one of the controllers
that is exactly what Windows expects.  Otherwise you either can't use
32-bit access or it will let you and then hose your data.

Hello.

   I'm planning to install a Japanese TeX/LaTeX package on my Linux PC. Before
   I invest lots of time to compile and install or get megabytes of software
   from the JE package I would like know

     I've never installed jTeX on a PC before, so some
(or maybe even all :-) of what I'm writing may not be
accurate.

   1. Which of the two packages (NTT-jtex or ASCII-jtex) is better?
   2. Does any of the two packages support top to bottom/right to left
      writing?

     I'm not sure what you mean by "better", but
ASCII-jtex with it's pTeX extension (included in the
jtex1.7 package.  You might want to get the
pTeX-JIS-patch too.) supports top->bottom writing.
     The main differences between the two are;
        1. NTT-jTeX supports newJIS, whereas ASCII-jTeX,
           in it's original form (without the
           pTeX-JIS-patch) supports only shift-JIS and
           EUC kanji-codes.
        2. NTT-jTeX requires font files for japanese
           characters too, and these are available (no,
           they're NOT free) from Dainippon Printing.
           There may be some free fonts around
           somewhere; I'm not sure.  ASCII-jTeX requires
           only the font-metric files, so if your
           printer/previewer/whatever has it's own
           kanji-char-set, this saves a lot of disk
           space.
     These are the main differences.  Which one you
consider better depends a lot on your system
configuration.  If your machine is running X11R5 with
kanji fonts installed, the ASCII version will probably
give you less trouble.

   3. Which of the two packages is included in JE?

     What's JE? (This might have been a stupid question.
As I said before, I have no experience with PCs running
UN*X.)

     If you get the fj* newsgroups, asking someone there
might be a better way of getting information.

Your right, it was never published in *any* journal. I have a copy
sitting right in front of me; it was written by Brain Kernighan though.
And yes, it is a good paper. It is an internal AT&T Bell Labs Technical 
Memorandum (TM) dated April 2, 1981 (for anyone who cares, it's number 
is TM 81-11272-12; Case No. 39199-11).

The cover sheet says "The information contained herin is for use of Bell
Laboratories and not for publication". But, doesn't say it is proprietary.
Thus, I shouldn't get into trouble :-)

If you can not get a copy, I would be perfectly happy to send off
a handful of requests via snail mail (I have no electronic copy).
Disclaimer: If I get *many* requests; I will only send copies to the
first several that I recieve (don't have the time to send alot out :-)
