tar would be exempt, but the SLS scripts would not be:

"For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all
modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus
THE SCRIPTS USED TO CONTROL COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION of the executable.
However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with
the major components (..) of the operating system on which the executable
runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable."

tar would be exempt, the SLS install scripts would be covered.

This is why NT runs in a minimum 1 Meg configuration, right?  500K for
the system with 500K to spare for apps, eh?  ;)

The NT "kernel + necessary extensions to run" is presumably somewhere
in the order of 7 or 8 Megs, or it would run comfortably in less than
12 Megs.

I believe you are somehow mistaken here - it's more about the OS/GUI in

Oh my god - not again. If you don't believe linux has QIC-80 support, then
call +49 40 7654276, log in as guest and do "findsoft ftape". It's there.
It's working. People use it to do backups. What else do you need to believe
it? So though I agree that many linux users are somehow, well,
over-confident about their OS, most if not all responses I have seen so far
were right on technical aspects (this is far more than I can say about the
NT supporters side).

Well, how would you react if I posted an article claiming that NT won't run
in under 64MB, won't run DOS or Windows apps more complicated than "hello
world", uses 16 bit 286 protected mode, doesn't support the majority of SCSI
cards and costs $15000 to a linux group, and somebody else crossposted a
reply to this group?

Right. One of the greatest dangers linux is in - that fanatic users try to
thrust it upon people it is really not ready for yet (not the other way 
round :-).

There. Called modules. Call the above mentioned site, do a "findsoft
module". It's there. It's working (the qic-80 support uses it :-). What else
do you want?

Well, I said this before - show me how you run lemmings 2 under NT, and I'll
admit that you have an emulation that is at least equal with linux'. Until
then, be careful what you declare vaporware. BTW, this time do "findsoft
dosemu" :-)

> Running Winodws apps... "WABI is almost here"
Yeah - the development has gone on for exactly two months now - and I can
download a new experimental set every week. This isn't what I call
vaporware! Something is vaporware when you speak about it on CeBit '90, show
a version "Beta, close to shipping" on CeBit '91, show another version
"Gamma, we just have to tweak that last bugs out" at CeBit '92, and
introduce it to the market with lots of PR on CeBit '93, and several months
later really start shipping..... Been there, heard it!

This isn't true (OK, I haven't tested with parallel ports, but I have used a
3434 four serial setup during the last 5 weeks. It works!
BTW, why should I have interrupts enabled for my parallel port if not using
PLIP? If using PLIP, the kernel is expecting IP-packets every microsecond...

OK, I was among those that answered along this line. To tell you the truth,
at least I have a rather clear concept of WHAT IT IS. Only, I have no idea
as to what it is good FOR.... This all comes down to filemanagers in the end
(surprise surprise... at least on of the FMs for linux supports D&D :-), and
I strongly doubt that they improve efficiency.

OK, this is nice - BTW, how much memory is wasted when the driver for that
gimmick is dynamically loaded?
The unix approach is more along the lines "if we have a tool for it, we
don't waste any energy on reimplementing it. And if we can do it in
userspace, we don't bloat the kernel with it". You want a full motion video?
OK, write something like "this software requires that mpeg_player is
available on the system. It is available from xxx.yyy.zzz and compiles out
of the box", then simply spawn a shell executing it. Same for sound (ever
heard of .mod-files? How do you play them under NT? Oops :-). What is needed
at the kernel level (sound support, CD support) is there, the user programs
are there ("findsoft sound", "findsoft mpeg"), what else do we need?

Oops, didn't I read this several pages above? You seem in desparate need to

Was true until, well, I think about a month ago. Well, nearly true. It first
started throwing away the program code, then started to swap. If you
invested 16MB for swap, it was REALLY hard to have the machine crash because
of low memory. 
But this is history, linux now handles this situation more gracefully (plus
- I wonder what NT does? Ooh, you mean if I malloc 16MB under NT, it really
takes 16MB to fulfill my wishes?!?).

>Need I say more? There is still lots to talk about: the flaky file

You obviously haven't used a current version of linux for at least half a
year. I haven't used NT ever. I don't think I'm in the know to flame NT. Why
do you think you are for linux?

>Linux users, get a clue! Your os is shit. And remember, we didn't

Well - you did. One of you. He posted a really ridiculous list comparing the
two. most I have seen from the linux side has been technically correct,
though the tone sometimes wasn't very nice. Calling what runs on my computer
"shit" isn't that nice, either! And what your side said about linux was
mostly plain wrong....

When my system comes up, my master boot record (winiboot) asks me
which partition I want to boot.  If I don't choose something
(with one keypress) within the timeout period, Linux is automatically 
booted..  If I press some key for a different OS, it gets booted instead.

How can multi-OS operation be simpler than that?  

While this isn't the default installation (with LILO), winiboot is 
available as part of the shoelace package, available in source
and binary form.

>i hate Linux, but i'm still curious why they decided to have this silly
>off-the-standard booting scheme (LILO). 

LILO is a bootblock replacement for the bootblock within a partition,
there's nothing non standard about that.

As far as the LILO bootblock being different from BSD's - it 
was developed under a different set of design constraints.  Size 
is more limited than with BSD because we don't have things sub 
partitioned with an area for the disklabel / bootblock set aside.
This limits the amount of functionality.  We can't work like the
BSD bootblock and prompt to boot any file, since users must be
able to boot of more than one type of FS, and we don't have room
to support the proliferation of filesystems in the bootblock.  So,
we needed a minimal bootstrap that could locate a block mapping for
various kernel immages and load them as directed.

>With *BSD using a normal dozz
>boot scheme (load MBR, and then load the active partition's boot sector),

That's how Linux + LILO and the master boot record of your choice.

The same thing applies to Linux.

>(Another problem of Linux is, they occupy a full dozz partition for swap 
instead of sub-partitioning their primary one.)

Linux supports MS-DOS extended partitions, if you choose to use 
them you can have multiple Linux / DOS / etc. partitions in one 
physical partition.

>Btw., i've been working with my old cheep PC from older dozz times.

As are many starving college student and unemployed hacker types :-)

The key word there is "original".  The original implementation of shared
libraries under Linux was deficient in this regard, since they were 
statically linked.  This got you very low disk space usage, low 
memory usage, etc, but none of the benefits of dynamic linking and
ease of fixing library bugs in all your binaries. In other words, it 
was still better than no shared libraries.

After that, Linux got the so-called "jump table" libraries, where
the jump table was at a fixed location but the routines could move.
This let us upgrade shared libraries without recompiling anything, 
making it easy to fix library bugs.  

The currenty Linux shared library implementation is dynamic.

The same thing applies to all unices.  Any good system administrator
will trim out everythign he/she doesn't need to maximize the amount 
of free memory and consequently the size of the incore page set.

( after various rlimit checks, code from .99.12, it was originally added
to one of the pre-.99.11 alpha releases and was generally available in 
.99.11 )

        freepages = buffermem >> 12;
        freepages += nr_free_pages;
        freepages += nr_swap_pages;
        freepages -= (high_memory - 0x100000) >> 16;
        freepages -= (newbrk-oldbrk) >> 12;
        if (freepages < 0)
                return current->brk;

So, we figure free memory as the sum of truly free pages, size of the
buffer cache, and how much sawp we have left.  We deduct some based
on memory size for padding, figure out how much would be left if this 
brk() succeeded, and if that value is negative, fail.

It was available in alpha patches against .99.10, .99.11 was the 
first publically available distribution that handles things 
correctly.
