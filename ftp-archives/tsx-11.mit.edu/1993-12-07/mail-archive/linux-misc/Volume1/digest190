I'd be interested in takin' a peek at that source -- I could stand to learn
about TCP/IP servers too, and what better way to do it then with a single .C
file. I'd be happy to post it to another newsgroup if you tell me which ones.

Your kernel didn't recognize it because there isn't an EtherExpress device
driver for Linux.  Unlike most other devices, ethercards vary wildly in their
interface and method of operation.  The EtherExpress is no exception.

I started writing a driver, but two things have kept me from finishing it.
1) I talked to some Intel guys at spring InterOp, but they never sent the
programming information they promised.  That still leaves the Crynwr packet
driver source as documentation, but
2) it uses a damn Intel chip.  What, does Intel send its designers and
tech writers a special school or something?  I've found Intel parts
unnecessarily complicated and their documentation obfusicated every since the
late 70's.  OK, flame off.  Simple version: "It don't work yet."

I'm not sure if this is the right forum for my question, so don't jump
on me if it isn't.

All I want to find out if anybody here has any experience with the
Acculogic ISApport SCSI-2 adapter card.  I am considering buying it, but
I don't see it listed in the hardware guide. On its box it says: "Corell

...the Intel based cards are not presently supported. Look in the Ethernet-
HOWTO to determine what cards you can and can't run with Linux at present.

Subject: Scanning + writeonce CD-ROM suggestions?
Date: Fri, 8 Oct 1993 06:08:34 GMT

We're looking at a heavy duty document scanning and retrival problem.
The sheer speed of scanning is a constraint; i.e. the usage is not
once-in-a-while.

We're biased towards either of SPARC+SunOS or PC+Linux.  But if the
scanner itself likes to get plugged into a MS-DOS box, we can take
files it generates over the NFS into some sane place.  Will the speed
of NFS writing be a constraint?

We want to write the (gzipped) scanned material onto write-once
CD-ROMs at the end of each day or so.  How practical is that right
now?  Again, a write-once drive which plugs into Unix (Linux ok) would
be perfect, we want to avoid PC industry OS offerings wherever
possible.

Do you have any suggestions on hardware/software options?  If I had a
book of 100 letter sized pages how many minutes would the scanning
take?  Does the scanner have to be on SCSI for speed?  What are the
issues in color vs. BW scanning?  What image formats should we be
using?  What glue software will allow for the tagging of a document
with keywords or codes or whatever?  We can fluently hack up scripts
etc. if the scanning software itself will allow itself to get invoked
from shell scripts.

We're biased towards 600 dpi since it can goto HP4 printers, 300 dpi
printers, and fax with less loss.  Is that a smart idea?

What does all this cost?  Who is a good shop to buy from?

Thanks a lot,

        -ans.

right. One problem though: pcnfsd.c is not ANSI C ! You have to use
'protoize' to convert to ANSI C. I managed to compile on Linux but
haven't tested it yet.

besides 'protoize' you need to add '(char *)' in the line:

      (strcmp(p->pw_passwd, crypt(password, p->pw_passwd)))) {
so:
      (strcmp(p->pw_passwd, (char *)crypt(password, p->pw_passwd)))) {

Subject: Re: Linux Magazine [how much work?]
Date: Fri, 8 Oct 1993 09:49:45 GMT

Hi Linuxers:

Just a few thoughts. I'd very much appreciate a Linux-magazine, and I'd like 
to share some thoughts on the publishing strategy.  At our departement I've 
started a (small) magazine for `internal' publications, which has developed 
into a `de facto' standard for internal and external publications.  The 
setup of this magazine may perhaps provide some ideas.  

In `my' magazine, I've chosen to create a set of LaTeX macros which take the 
typesetting burden off the shoulders of the submitters.  The macro set is 
available to all who want to use it; either for the magazine or for personal 
use.  The reason to choose this path was that I *did* want the magazine to 
appear, but *didn't* want to put too much work into it.  The result is, that 
my collegues can write texts using the macro set, can preview the results, 
can change the layout to suit them, etc., *before* I receive the final 
submission.  Therefore, I in fact get an error-less article, ready to 
include in the next issue.  The macro set has proven thus helpful that even 
other publications, which do not relate to this magazine, are now created 
using this macro set.  

I'm not advocating LaTeX (or TeX) per se, but hopefully this setup generates 
some good thoughts.  Publishers beware!  The amount of work which has to be 
put into the magazine is always larger than you'd think, and my experience 
is that having to look after the magazine month after month is no fun at 
all, especially when the workload increases.  Receiving an error-less 
submission, ready to include in the next issue, helps a lot.  I therefore 
*do* advocate a typesetting system which allows the submitter to preview the 
article in the same form in which it will later appear.  The responsability 
for the form of the article (e.g., error-free, with the figures and tables 
at the right places, etc.) is then not in the hands of the publisher, but in 
the hands of the submitter. And this helps, believe me!

Well, that's my $0.02.
Happy Linuxing, Karel.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

Indeed, and the PCNFS authentication system isn't too hot. Its ok for in
company type things but don't let the mass crackers of the internet near it
pcnsfd I've been told compiles up ok on Linux and will do the job it should.
In theory you could modify it so that it talked to the uid/gid mapping
server of the Linux nfsd and make it truely secure by only mapping the
uid that goes with the pcnfs login used. I've been meaning to have a crack
at this with the floppy disk nfs booted linux kit, so it starts up logs you
in, authenticates you with the nfsd maps only your uid mounts /usr readonly
and /home r/w for the one uid only. Would be a nice way of doing things.
However I'm debugging the Linux tcp/ip at the moment and trying to get a 
kernel IPX stack working (ha!) so it will have to wait.

Yes, commercial software availablity.

======> COFF/SCO/ISC compatibility,  ELF/Unixware compatibility,
        MS-"Windows" (WINE) capabilities.

I would have several uses for Linux IF it could run existing commercial
Unix software such as WordPerfect, Lotus, Aster*x, ClockWise, Codelink,
Mlink, Grammatik, AOM, Foxbase, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc....

For now, it stays at home :(
