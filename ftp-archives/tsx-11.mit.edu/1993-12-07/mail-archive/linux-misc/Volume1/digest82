I can believe this figure actually. I was very suprised how fast the
Cyrix coprocessor was on sin/cos/tan operations. Some rough timings
suggest that if you do vast amounts of these operations the Cyrix is
indeed faster than the 486, but on the simpler operations it is 
nothing like as good. I guess somehow sin/cos/tan are popular on
raytracers...

you are right! I saw this on the net and got/compiled screen no prob. BUT

        There was a fair amout of discussion on the FSSTND list about
statically linked binaries.  It makes sense to have two, ln, so you can
fix the "whoops I broke the symlink" problem and sync, so if there's
something worse wrong you can sync your disks before hitting the
reset switch to reboot with a boot floppy.

It would also probably lose you your case.  If someone tried to do this in
a copyright or patent case I am sure that you would hear the squeals of
glee from the opposing counsel half way around the world.  Contrary to the
glib "judgements" rendered on here by net.pseudo-lawyers, copyrights and
patents, particularly relating to software, is not for the faint of heart or
the untrained.  You would, quite simply, lose your socks along with your
program...

Check out sash, by David Bell.  It has:

    alias      [name [command]]
    cd         [dirname]
    -chgrp     gid filename ...
    -chmod     mode filename ...
    -chown     uid filename ...
    -cmp       filename1 filename2
    -cp        srcname ... destname
    -dd        if=name of=name [bs=n] [count=n] [skip=n] [seek=n]
    -echo      [args] ...
    -ed        [filename]
    exec       filename [args]
    exit       
    -grep      [-in] word filename ...
    help       
    -kill      [-sig] pid ...
    -ln        [-s] srcname ... destname
    -ls        [-lid] filename ...
    -mkdir     dirname ...
    -mknod     filename type major minor
    -more      filename ...
    -mount     [-t type] devname dirname
    -mv        srcname ... destname
    -printenv  [name]
    prompt     string
    -pwd       
    quit       
    -rm        filename ...
    -rmdir     dirname ...
    setenv     name value
    source     filename
    -sync      
    -tar       [xtv]f devname filename ...
    -touch     filename ...
    umask      [mask]
    -umount    filename
    unalias    name

built into it.  It's 100k when statically linked and has the ability to run
external binaries.  It does filename expansion the way you'd expect.  It
doesn't have a scripting language, though.  It's only useful for recovering
from problems.

Speaking from my recent experience with SCO UNIX, it is NOT compatible
with the 174x drivers.  Adaptec has released new drivers that are sitting
on their BBS for SCO and Interactive UNIX.  The 1.0 Release of the EZ-SCSI
software for DOS (and their ASPIEDOS.SYS driver v1.1) does not recognize the
2740 either.

One important thing to note about the article is that they reviewed the
twin-channel 2742T, not the standard single-channel 2742.  This may affect
the performance of the unit.  I'd also imagine that since the board is
brand new, they (Adaptec) haven't had enough time to fine tune the drivers.
They also tested it under Netware (yuk) instead of UNIX.

My two cents on the 174xA controllers is that they stink.  They are (according
to an engineer I know) slightly outside of EISA timing specs, and if you try
to run them on a system with tight bus timing (e.g. a DEC 433mp or any other
Intel-based MP system), they lock the system up.  They're really fast when 
they work, but that's if you can make 'em work.

I've taken on supplying a local DOS BBS with Linux files.  I just sent
them all 5+ hours of SLS. But as much, or more so that those of us with
Real NetNews (tm) access, they would benefit from doc.

By doc's,I mean anything in text that explains how to do something in
Linux. Thus the FAQ's, the recent Matt Welsh book on installations, you
name it...

Help me choose what to send.

The only proviso I think I should include is the data must be
bootstrapable. If it is compressed with ZXCV!@#$, then I need the
location of a DOS-based ZXCV decompression program. If the text is
_not_ in straight ASCII, include the name of the needed DOS viewer/
formatter to read & print it. (No fair providing anything that needs
compiling/hacking/etc before it will work -- the idea is to help these
poor DOSvictims, not discourage them.)

I'll summarize & post.

This really makes me mad.  Mad enough to botch my first reply and mail
it to the guy who had gall enough to say this.  The internet used to
be free of commercialism like this, but I guess supporting your
software (which isn't theirs anyway) is an idea that went out with MS
Windows and MS-DOS.

As, a general rule, although I respond to at least several c.o.l.help
messages a day, I will not respond to any SLS bugs.  People who buy
releases like this ask dumb questions that can be answered by reading
the FAQ.

Although the vendor of the product claims I work for him, I do not.

Subject: Speed testing different versions of POV
Date: 1 Sep 1993 20:46:03 -0400


Background for Linux folks:   There has been a lot of discussion in
comp.graphics recently about 'Fastpov', which is a DOS version of POV
compiled with the Watcom compiler.


I decided to run off a few quick tests this morning to see how different
versions of POV performed on my no-name 486/50 (8Mb ram).  
I used the standard POV benchmark test - ie rendering CHESS.POV to /dev/null
with no antialiasing, no display, quality 9 etc etc etc.

The results were as follows:


POV version       | Render time (320x200) |  Chesstones (pixels/sec)
==================+=======================+=========================
Standard DOS      |       337 seconds     |          189.91
                  |                       |    
Fast POV for DOS  |       289 seconds     |          221.45
                  |                       |
POV for Linux     |       281 seconds     |          227.76


The Linux version of POV was compiled with standard cc - would gcc or
any other compiler produce faster code?

Of course, the tests above only compare raw speed - I haven't had time 
to render any complicated scenes to compare output quality.  If anyone
can suggest any scenes that might show up any differences then let me
know - I'll throw the scenes at all three versions and post the results
to alt.binaries.pictures.misc

An alias cannot truly replace pwd, since some shellscripts need pwd,

No, in the meantime a lot of damage will be done. It's not like in the 60s,
when there were still hardly any alternatives. But now there are perfectly
fine and well-designed operating systems with pretty wide acceptance. It is
only because so many are uninformed and fall into the traps of Microsoft, not
at all because of a fair comparison on technical grounds, that people might
choose microsoft and such bring a lot of damage on themselves and the whole
industry.

Indeed. I hope for that. The sooner the better. That's my whole point. Of
course they kill themselves only if people, as a result of their stupidness,
refuse to be dictated by Microsoft, and make NT flop.

But if the whole world will use NT and everyone want NT software, also for
small scale techincal projects, that is also going to affect me. I'll be the
victim of others stupidness or immorality. Therefore every well-thinking
person should boycott Microsoft. This is very easy because alone for
techincal reasons there is no reason at all to use a Microsoft 'operating
system'.

XFree86 is X11R5.  It is a pre-packaged version of X11 for the Intel

X11R5 does run under Linux.  Question is, does the user wish to spend
the time compiling it?  And by compiling it, I also mean making any
unique adjustments for video display system, network communcation
protocols, and etc...  Not an easy task.  Also, does the user have the
lavish amounts of time and disk space to do the installation /
compilation.

Many thanks and kudo's to the XFree86 development team.
