Does anyone know if there is a driver for the abovementioned ethernet card
available for linux? It is a relatively new card so I am not too hopeful,
but I would like to do some linux-sco nfs performace comparisons and this
is the only card I have.

The address of a ftp site with driver code would be fine.
Thanks,
Mattw

    A side question: I've still got one binary that uses the old stat()

    I'll bet if you check, micro-emacs will complain about an old stat()

Hahaha! Should I mention that I recently lost my ext2fs because I made thte
bad mistake of using MS-DOS fdisk? It really managed to totally destroy
partition table, and that just (so I assume) because it was somehow
disturbed that I had more than one primary partition....

Subject: linux/mgetty again...
Date: Wed, 15 Sep 1993 08:06:53 GMT

  Sorry to return back to this topic, but I still have some small problems
with mgetty/sendfax.

  I am using the ACEEX 1496 faxmodem under Linux .99.8 and mgetty/sendfax
0.13. After enforcing the hardware flow control (mapping the ioctl calls to
tc{get,set}attr), sending faxes is working perfectly. The only problem is
faxrec. The received faxes are legible (somehow), but many lines are corrupted;
even g3topbm reports a problem of premature EOF, so I had to hack it in order
to get something at least. I fear the problem might still be the flow control,
but dunno...

  Another surprising fact is that sending a fax at 14400 bps sendfax consumes
only about 10% CPU (80386, 33 MHz), whereas receiving at 9600 mgetty consumes
something in the region 70-95 % CPU !! I seem to have noticed that even during
the fax receive, OPOST and OCRNL are active; is it quite OK?

  Would appreciate any hint, thanks in advance,

You're probably right that an HPFS implementation would be of use to more
people, but NTFS would be far more interesting - usually a good indicator
of whether something will get done <grin>.

An HPFS implementation would look kind of like a FAT fs (ie: horrible)
because there is no provision for file ownership or "real" permissions.
NTFS, on the other hand, understands at least ownership, and has built-in
ACLs. If I were going to do one of the two, I think I'd prefer to tackle
NTFS due to the "interest" factor. As for the relative difficulty, neither
is particularly hard if adqeuate documentation is available, although
disk allocation strategies might be a little tricky to get "right". This
is not something restricted to either of them, however...

BTW: I mean "horrible" in the Linux view - all the files would have the
same owner and group, much like the current FAT fs.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

No, only when I use <TAB> in connection with ^x^f to expand the path for me.
Reading/Writing don't use the stat() call.  The rest of uemacs works just fine..
Anyway, this is all of curiosity of course.  The point was just to show that it's not
that much of incompatibilities that has been introduced in Linux *since the very
beginning*.  Ok? :-)

Version 1.0.3 of the Slackware Linux distribution may be found on
ftp.cdrom.com in directory /pub/linux/slackware, or
/pub/linux/zooed_slackware. 

This is primarily a maintenance release incorporating suggestions and
bug fixes mailed in or discussed in comp.os.linux.*.

The most interesting new features are the Pine mailer, svgalib v.0.7,
man/xman patched to comprehend .z, .gz, and .Z extensions in the cat 
directories, and groff v. 1.08.

As far as the rest of the release, basically if you sent your bug report
in to me (or posted it) since the release of 1.0.2, it should be fixed
now, although there always seem to be more :^)

Thanks to everyone who sent in suggestions, bug reports, diffs, etc.
You've made the rapid debugging of this release possible.

I have a Bubble jet 20, for which I use ghostscript to print
postscript files. As the device I use 'bj10e'. Perhaps the latest
release of ghostscript has a special device for the Bubble jet 200,
but I am not certain (I actually think that it has not). Anyway, just
try 'gs -help' to see if there is any more suited for your Bubblejet.
To use device bj10e (which should work, also for BJ 200), do :

gs -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=bj10e -sOutputFile=/dev/lp1 file.ps

This is of course if your printer is recognized as lp1.
ALL OF THIS IS IN THE PRINTER FAQ.

Hope this helps,
