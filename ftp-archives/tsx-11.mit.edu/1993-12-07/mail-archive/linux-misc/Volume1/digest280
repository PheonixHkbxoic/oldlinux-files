There exist microkernel OS's that allow you to write drivers (interrupt
handlers and all) as user-level processes that can be started and stopped
like any other process, and debugged with the standard system, full-screen
symbolic debugger.  This makes writing device drivers MUCH easier than the
traditional "rebuild OS, reboot OS, test until it crashes, reboot OS, etc".

There also exist microkernel OS's that are at least as efficient as their
monolithic counterparts.  A well-implemented microkernel OS makes a lot of
sense.

Hello,

I'm using a Escom Tower 486DX/2 50, Standard-Controller with a Conner
170 MB HD (part of the sold Package) plus one Conner CP30254 (250 MB),
Standard Isa-Bus, 8 MB Memory (don't try less if you're going to use
X: it's terribly slooow!)

Graphics: 2TheMax ET4000, Escom Trinitron 14" (works fine with 
    1024x768 if you can't afford 17" like me :-( )
CD: Mitsumi CD-Rom LU305 (might be the wrong Name - it's the Standard
    CD-Rom which is supported by Linux
Tape: Colorado DJ-20 Floppy-Streamer 
No Ethernet

The above configuration works fine with 0.99pl12 (pl13 works as well,
I'm still using pl12 with the ftape-patches, which are already available
for pl13).

If possible, you should get at least 250 MB, preferrably more disk space
- but the 170 MB HD is usually sufficient for a start. If you're planning
to use large disks, consider buying an Adaptec SCSI: it's fully supported
and can handle up to 7 devices including CD-Rom and Tapes. (Couldn't
afford it yet, but I guess it's the next thing in line...)

Bye,
Uwe

Subject: Linux & OS/2, can it be happy family
Date: Sat, 6 Nov 1993 09:42:07 GMT

Let me run this by you folks:

I have been craving a Unix box for some time now, because I get to play
with one at work, but I have no real power on it.  I do own bootptab and
have super user access to the WordPerfect terminal editor, but that does
not a system administrator make.

I can't give up my OS/2 machine, or even share it because I need it to
do "real" things, like run SAS, Quicken, Lotus 1-2-3, and such stuff.

I have been looking at old used Suns, SGIs, and have even considered a
minivax running Ultrix.  Now that XFree2.0 is out I am considering an
386+ running Linux (I had no luck with 1.3).  These base systems are 
readily available.  A new 386/40 motherboard is under $200 and even a 
486SX is not much more.  I have seen used 386/387 boards for under
$120, and I have a spare VGA monitor.

The biggest dilemna is hard drive space.  No matter what cheap processor
I get hard drives are still failry expensive. However I have lots of
space on my OS/2 machine, 560 usable megs, and 100 slow megs.  I also
have a 40 meg drive not being used at all, and can always pick up a 100
meg ide for around $80.  Unix + X would require at least 120 megs, and
then a swapfile.

So this is what I am thinking.  I could put a 120 or so meg ide and
possibly the 40 meg mfm on a Linux box.  That would be enough room to
install the os and X, plus a the normal array of nifty Unix things.
It wouldn't be enough room to do much else.  So I am thinking I could use
NFS to offload a bunch of stuff on to the OS/2 machine, particularly
things like TeX fonts and styles, and emacs lisp byte-compiled files,
which are non-machine dependent and could be shared by both platforms. I
could also use the OS/2 machine for tmp space and scratch space.

Does this sound like a sane setup?  Is there something inherently wrong
here, or should it work ok?

The Unix machine would essentially be a toy (but aren't all
computers?) so I am not terribly interested in speed.  I like the fact
that it is contorted because I will have fun with it, I just want to
make sure I am not setting out to do the impossible.

Any advise would be greatly appreciated.

Hmm, I can't seem to find the distribution-howto...
but in the two hours I've been catching up on the Linux groups, I've
put together the following (alphabetical) list of vendors:

vendor           voice phone        distributions on CD-ROM
MCC              ???                own? (very tight)

Yggsadril        +1 408 261 6630    LGX

Can anyone fill in the blanks or post the missing distribution howto?
(Or tell me why alphbetical order seems to be reverse telephone number order?-)

The real reason why the FSF guys don't like Linux is of course the size.
Linux is way too small and can be run even on 2-3M machines.

I don't see why the chroot environment would necessarily be safer.  In any
case, when you use an environment which makes every user 'bbs' you have to
recode everything to get around this 'feature' when you want to add
functionality to the system -- like adding chat, news, or MUDs (etc).  The
point of just writing an easy-to-use-bbs-style-shell rather than a bbs
program is that you don't have to spend so much time reinventing the
wheel.  Also, security should not be a problem if you set up your group
stuff correctly and implement shadow passwords.  Further, (maybe this isn't
a desireable solution if you like to login from work, but...) setting only
console as the only secure tty might be a good idea as well.

I've got a plasma display connected to a Diamond Speedstar Pro
through the VESA feature connector on that card.  I've tried
the suggestions for that card, but was not able to develop a
working Xconfig.  I also tried the Paradis PVGA and that did
not work either.  So, is there anyone out there who has settings
which work with a plasma screen?

My guess is that lcd displays use the same VESA feature connector
mechanism, so information about lcd displays would be welcome,
also.

I've only been following the linux groups for a short time, but I've 
noticed two things: comp.os.linux.help gets far more traffic than the
rest of the groups, and comp.os.linux.help gets many many installation
questions.  My not-so-revolutionary idea for whomever it is that 
maintains linux groups is, how about a comp.os.linux.install.(help)
group? Cut the traffic in comp.os.linux.help to a reasonable size,
and also allow people with installation questions to solicit exactly
the right group.

(Yes, I know that many installation questions are the result of 
insufficient reading by the poster - but there are still lots of
legitimate installation questions.)

I won't comment on the actual proposal except to say that it isn't
as far-fetched as a lot of the more common proposals.  However, anyone
interested in creating new newsgroups would be advised to read the
related guides and other material in news.announce.newgroups (and
news.answers).  The way to start the process for creating a new 
newsgroup is detailed there; if you are serious about the proposal,
why not do it properly?  

Before starting the actual process, it can be a good idea to get some
general feel for what people think.  However, at least as far as the
Linux groups are concerned, the opinions vary too wildly, and there are
too many too vocal people on either side.  Hence, it is too difficult
to get any valid picture, and it would be better to just get the process
started anyway.

(Followups redirected to news.groups, which is the proper group for
discussing new groups.  That's discussing; the first article is
of course best posted to the affected newsgroups as well.)

Greedy question:

I've got a 14,400bps modem, and I'm running term. tmon reports
around 1200 characters per second, whereas I gather my modem
should be able to get closer to 1440 characters per second, or
even higher due to v.42bis compression (which does exist on my
line). I've seen higher rates with other transfer protocols.

Is anybody faring better than 1200 cps? If so, what did you
tweak? What's your term configuration file like?

My apologies to the 2400- bauders who will be enraged

The Linux CD-ROM $15.00

A snapshot of the linux archive from tsx-11.mit.edu taken 20 September
1993.  Includes kernel version 0.99.12.  All files have been uncompressed
and all tar files extracted.  This disc will be updated at two (2) month
intervals and will have additional material included as users suggest to
us.  It is in ISO-9660 format with Rock Ridge extensions.

I have one from them containing tsx-11.  It's *great*, the best $15
I ever spent.  All the linux-activists mail archives, all the distributions,
all the software.  Linux software changes like a flock of hummingbirds
so you won't give up FTP, but this is a great one to get.

I think the plan is for bimonthly updates, too.

I'm running term 1.0.8 with a zyxel 14.4 modem and getting around 1570 cps avg.
tuploading large files while sporadically running trshes.  Sometimes it will
stay over 1600 for a fair bit when I'm doing nothing else.  My termrc is
quite standard..
baudrate 19200 (hardware compression and flow control on both ends)
window 3
timeout 50
compress off

and that's it.  Moving my baudrate from 14400 to 19200 helped a lot.  Somebody
said something about getting a faster rate when they used /dev/cua- rather
than /dev/ttyS- , so I suppose make sure you are using cua devices (which you
should anyway...) I'm lucky and do not have to escape or ignore anything...if
you have to do that, you can count on slower speeds.  

Apologies for not redirecting this to comp.os.linux.help where it prob. 
belonged, but I'm using a lousy VMS newsreader and I don't think it's even
possible (petition my school to give me an ethernet connection so I can rn
from my Linux box. :)  )

Here's a fix the problem.
Replace line 38 in misc.c, which was:
current_time = t.tv_sec * 20 + t.tv_usec / 50000;

with

current_time = (t.tv_sec & 0xffffff) * 20 + t.tv_usec / 50000;

Problem is t.tv_usec is currently around 0x2cdc459b, and will overflow
when multiplied by 20. I don't know why it was working before - I guess
it overflowed to a harmless number before, but now doesn't.
