Try to lay your hands on vim (Vi IMitation) by Bram Moolenaar.  The
latest version is 1.27 and it is the ultimate best vi implementation
I've yet come across.  It has several extentions like multi-level undo,
filename completion on the command line, stream, interactive marking of
line and column blocks, history for the command line and much much more.

Unfortunately I don't remember where I got the original copy from, but
a copy of the source can be found on
        ftp.sun.ac.za:/pub/unix/misc/vim-1.27.tar.gz
Compilation is quite painless, just type `make'.  :-)

Subject: Source for xdaliclock-jmp?
Date: Sun, 17 Oct 1993 20:42:19 GMT

There is a binary on sunsite called xdaliclock-jmp.Z which presumably loads
Salvador Dali's "The Persistence of Time" into the root window.  
Unfortunely, this binary was compiled with libX11.so.2.0 which doesn't
seem to be available anywhere.  (I grabbed so.2.1, and linked it to
so.2.0, but the binary complained of an incompatible binary.

Can anyone tell me where the source to this is?  (And this *is* a

Hello. I'm curious if a driver exists for Plus Hard Cards, or if one
is necessary. I can get use of a 52 meg hardcard for free, but since 
I'm runing Linux, the DOS drivers won't do any good.

Does a driver exist for these cards, or (doubtful I know) is there
an autodetect that would pick this up and make it usuable?

Any information will be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Linux Distributions...
Date: Mon, 18 Oct 1993 10:23:34 GMT

i've currently got SLS 1.03 installed (but with a "pure" 0.99pl13 kernel - the
SLS kernel doesn't work with Wangtek PC-36 tape drives).

I've installed everything but X (X doesn't recognise my crappy ACER 512K VGA
card) and am not completely happy with the way things are set up, and the
config options that many of the binaries were compiled with.

I'm considering getting another distribution, or maybe just getting the kernel
and installing everything else from scratch.

Slackware sounds pretty good, but it doesn't support 5.25" drives...if I had
$80 (Australian $) spare for a new drive, then i'd put it towards my CD-ROM
drive fund rather than a floppy which I'll hardly ever use.

(does anyone know if Slackware can be copied on to and installed from 5.25"
HD floppies formatted to 18 sectors per track?)

So, what are my alternatives?

MCC is the only other one i've heard of, but i'm not sure exactly what comes
with it.

I need uucp, Cnews, smail or sendmail, nn (I don't like tin), elm, PC-36 tape
drive support, gcc, and of course, the usual binaries and man pages.   Does 
MCC have all this?  Networking stuff and SLIP would be nice, but I can add
that later if/when I need it.

This is probably an MCC FAQ, so could someone email me with the MCC FAQ or
installation notes (I don't have ftp access).

what else is there apart from MCC?  If I were to start with a pl13 kernel 
and build the rest myself, what would I need and where would I get it from
(i can get stuff ftp-ed for me if I tell my friend exactly where to go and 
what to get).  Are binary packages commonly available, or just sources?

Yes, I also noticed that vi doesn't go back in to cbreak mode when
you 'fg' it.  Very annoying.  (This is elvis 1.7 from the MCC dist)

I don't like vim, because I noticed that its screen redraws are
less optimized than real vi, even after you turn off showcmd.  It's
not noticable on fast displays, but is at serial speeds.

It does have nice online help, though.

All people with internet access have access to a newsreader, either 
locally at their site or on a public access system like nyx.cs.du.edu.

In your case, since you had located a public NNTP server that let anyone
connect, there was nothing stopping you from running a local newsreader
that supports nntp, like trn, rn, etc.

I am also getting this message.  It then continues and gives the following

It looks as if it's installing everything fine, but it goes way to fast

boot from the hard drive, there's nothing there, so it hangs.

I'm booting off the a1.5 disk and trying to do the install from drive B
(3.5").  My swap partition and root partition seem like they're setup
fine.  It just seems like tar or gzip are having troubles being found.
I've repeated this several times.  It does the same thing when logging in
as install as when I log in as root and do things manually.

Any suggestions?  Thanks,

I use  vim  rather than  elvis.

Elvis is only half bad, and missing commands are easily added since the
source code is freely available.  However, the buggy screen updates (when
lines longer than 80chars are displayed) really cause lots of grief.

Vim doesn't seem to have that bug, and it does support the :dx
and "assumed ." syntax and other nice "real vi" things such as long lines
fully displayed in wrap-around format.

Arrow keys still work in input mode (unlike vi on many systems),
but they don't have the modified behaviour of "remembering" the insert
column when moving up/down.. that feature is very nice in elvis.
No big deal though, it's only a one line change to vim (which I've done).

vim is a very nice vi clone.  Recommended.

Sure, but only if nobody is going to get hurt, and the people who live
there don't mind.  We wouldn't want to send the military somewhere
dangerous (e.g. Somalia), or where they wouldn't be welcome (e.g.
Haiti).

I have an elliptic partial differential equation solver (finite elements,
adaptive refinement, multigrid) that was originally written on a Sun.
The bulk of the code is fortran; it uses C for the X Windows graphical
output.  The fortran code is "almost" fully complient with the standard
and portable (ftncheck only complains about 'include' and one nonstandard
format statement).  There was absolutly no work involved in porting this
to Linux.  It compiled and ran first time using f2c|gcc ala the f77 script
in SLS (isn't standard complient code wonderful).  In fact, I used Linux
for the final stages of development before releasing the code (MGGHAT
available from netlib -- might as well stick in a plug here).  I'll also
say I had no trouble using gdb with it.  In fact, I was suprised at how
well it worked considering the intermediate step of translation to C.

The only problem with Linux and a code like this is large memory usage.
Linux does not prevent you from running a program in which the total size
of the declared arrays is larger than the available memory and swap space.
(On a Sun, you get a 'not enough memory' message, and the program won't
run.)  If the program does actually exceed the available space during
execution, the whole system hangs and the only thing you can do is turn
off the power (ouch!).  I should point out, this was back in March that
I was doing this, and it's possible this situation has been improved since
then.
The second problem with large memory usage is swapping.  Linux swaps like
a dog.  I can run top in a second virtual console while running mgghat
without a window server in the first.  The program begins with a very
coarse grid (finite element mesh) and uses more and more memory as the
grid is refined.  Until it exceeds the real memory available, I get about
99% user for cpu usage.  Once it starts swapping, I get 5-10% user.  Of
course, this program is an extreme example of this because the irregularity
of the adaptive grid tends to scatter data throughout memory, so it will
have page faults more than your average code.

Speed?  On this program my 486DX 50Mhz Linux box took twice as long as
a Sparcstation 2 -- not bad considering the price difference.

I say the Linux box is practical for number crunching fortran programs
(just get a lot of memory) and that a _properly written_ fortran program
will have no porting woes.
