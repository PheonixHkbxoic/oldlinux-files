Yeah! I'd support this!  I've been considering working on something I've
named XStep. I love the next interface.  IB is great and it will be fun to
have it for Linux.

What does this say for the future of Next? Are they as on the rocks as I
think they are?  

They've gone from a good soft/hardware company to just a software company
and now they are giving the software away??  

What DOES this say for Next?

Nope.  I have permission to post this, and it looks like I'd better before the
rumors get TOO rampant...  (This was in response to my first post on the
subject, where because I suspected it really *wasn't* the code that was being
released I posted several reasons why the claim didn't make sense.)

Cc: rweissman@NeXT.COM

Dear Mr. Allbery,

I'd like to clear up a bit of confusion about OpenStep. We're not freely  
licensing our IMPLEMENTATION of our software; we're freely licensing the  
SPECIFICATION for the non-OS portions of NeXTSTEP.

By the end of June, NeXT will release the OpenStep specification which will be  
freely available for use as will the OpenStep trademark. This is NOT the same  
thing as releasing NEXTSTEP. OpenStep is a specification, like the Red Book  
for Adobe Postscript. You still have do develop the code which meets the  
spec.

NeXT is also licensing our implementation (code) of OpenStep to Sun for  
which we're being compensated. The spec and the implementation are two  
different things. As in the case of PostScript, vendors wanting to use it have  
the choice of taking the spec and building their own product (it cost us $100M  
to build NeXTSTEP) or to license an implementation from NeXT.

Proliferating NEXTSTEP in this way is our strategy to become a large volume  
supplier of object-oriented software. Everytime we or Sun or any other partner  
sells a version of our implementation of OpenStep, this is a win, financially and  
market-wise for us.

Does this clarify things?

Ronald Weissman
Director, Corporate Marketing
NeXT

===============================================================================

So, can we now forget that original mispost?  It's fairly clear that all
they're releasing is the specification --- much as COSE is doing.  (It started
with TrueType vs. PostScript... where will it end?  :-)

---On the other hand, once it's released I could very well see a Linux or
generic *ix free implementation of the specs being written by somebody...

One more comment.  In hindsight, it looks to me like the original poster saw
both NeXT's announcement about releasing the *specifications* and Sun's
announcement about their *implementation*, and either got them confused or
jumped to conclusions.  This may merely have been a problem with bad timing
(e.g. they may have arrived at virtually the same time, thereby implying a
nonexistent relationship).

Ok, let me translate.  (Gee, here I am editor of Linux Journal and I don't
make sense? :-) )

By the "spirit of Linux" I am talking about the amazing cooperative effort
that is going on to make Linux a reality.  The sidebar in the article was
titled someting like _SLS Linux System_ and went on to describe an
opeerating system that sounded like a product of Soft Landing Software
with no pointers to the fact that Linux was this effort of many and that
SLS was one of the "packages".  It went on to say that SLS was available
on floppy disks.  Then it said that it (where "it" doesn't indicate
there was anything different -- just the same old Linux) was also available
on CD-ROM from Yggdrasil.

In other words, the sidebar was true -- you can get "a" Linux on floppies
from SLS and "a" Linux on CD-ROM from Yggdrasil.  But it sure didn't do
any work toward painting the real Linux picture.  This is why I offered
to write an article on Linux for Sun World.

There really isn't any FAQ that does justice to the choice of Linux
packages that are available.  I have written a short story about what
is the right answer for your situation and sent it to many people.  I
will probably write an expanded version as an article for Linux Journal.
Once it is done I have no objection with making it available to the
net as well.

You completely missed the point of the original poster, so I inserted
some smilies for him (I hope that wasn't too presumptious:-). I've
also included the rest of his post:

You and him are on the same side in this "debate"; you shouldn't fly

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.

Subject: 4 COM ports that share IRQ3,4
Date: Fri, 26 Nov 1993 03:20:48 GMT

I posted a message suggesting this is possible. Running 4 serial ports
where only IRQ3 and IRQ4 are used (i.e. shared). I got numerous responses
asking for the information. I have posted it below.

DISCLAIMER: I did not write the following. I can testify that it does work
if and only if germanium diodes and 470 ohm resistors are used. DO NOT
ATTEMPT THIS ON YOUR SERIAL CARD UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT A DIODE AND RESISTOR
ARE AND HOW TO SOLDER PROPERLY. You can easily destroy two good serial
cards if you don't know what you are doing. Use a grounded soldering iron.

Someone might want to add this to the serial FAQ.

==================================


  If you're the hardware hacking type, the following is a message I sent a
friend about this.  Works great, without too much effort.

---
  I'm not sure if I ever told you of my final solution to the problem.  It's
sleazy, but it works fine.  I did a diode ORing of the interrupt lines.
I've run two ports simultaneously without any problems.  One thing I
noticed while doing testing is that there is a huge difference in
processing overhead between 16550 UARTs and 8250 UARTs.  At 38400 baud,
the 8250 was really dragging the system down.  At 38400, the 16550s were
hardly noticable.  Nasty ASCII drawing to follow:

  This has some advantages (and some disadvantages).

  The advantages:

  It works.

  It's backwards compatible.

  The only real modification you have to make to the card is the
addition of the resistors to the first one.  I put the diodes in place
of the IRQ jumper selection on the serial cards (takes some careful soldering).

  By just replacing the IRQ jumpers with diodes, you can string as many serial
ports on an IRQ as your software and number of card slots will support
(they all have to be uniquely addressed).

  Linux works perfectly with this setup out of the box (earlier bugs
have been fixed).

  The disadvantages:

  Electrically a bit hokey.  The 470 ohm resistor is on the small side,
[added note: my friend used 1K resistors with no problems]
but the drivers that are used for the interrupts are tanks and should be
able to provide sufficient source current.  You should use a germanium
diode for a low voltage drop.  I measured the drop of a bunch of small
signal diodes (silicon) out of my junk box and used the ones with the
smallest drop.

  DOS still won't work for two ports simultaneously (if you care :)
because the software drivers won't handle two-interrupts-at-once cases
right.
