   Actually, ThinWire NICs run about $5-$20 less than 10BaseT, depending
   on the manufacturer.  Though you are right about the hubs, 8 port hubs
   usually go for $200 wholesale, and that is an econo-hub.

You don't need a hub if you connect just 2 machines by 10BaseT, make a
cable crossing the tx and rx pairs and you're all set (that's what I
did, and it works fine so far).

Sorry guy, but this is an rtfm, at the very least, it is for tin.  From the
tin manpage:

:
:     A signature in $HOME/.Sig will be pulled into the editor for both

Also, this really isn't the right newsgroup for this posting.  You would 
probably want something like comp.unix.questions, since this is a unix 
(usenet?) related question, and not a linux related question.

No. LILO must assume that you place your kernel below the damned 1024-cyl-
boundary, the reason being that the ol' PC when booting cannot access
higher cylinders. So when you try to make a new-built kernel known to
LILO, it will place the information  about the absolute location of 
the kernel somewhere on the disk (gurus: where is that? On track 0 of
head 0?). LILO is intellifgent enough to give you a decent warning before
it lets you try to boot without success.

Good luck!

Date: Tue, 17 Aug 1993 22:18:54 GMT

Hello,

I just upgraded to 0.99pl12 from pl10. Now, when I reboot, my root
filesystem (ext2fs) is no longer clean and is checked each time. In
pl10 this was not the case. I use a shutdown which unmounts root
filesystem. My other (ext2fs) partition is still clean.

Has something changed in this respect?

Subject: Reboot problem tied to shadow BIOS
Date: Wed, 18 Aug 1993 18:11:30 GMT

Just a quick note about a peculiarity: I've run Linux SLS 1.01 and now
1.03, using kernels pl 9, 10 and now 12.  In all cases I've had a
problem with re-booting; "shutdown -r" sends the right signals to all
the processes, but then instead of re-booting, it hangs.

The other night, for no known reason, I decided to try it with BIOS
shadowing turned OFF, and guess what?  That cured the problem!  My
Linux now reboots normally.  But of course I'll want to re-enable
shadowing sooner or later -- it makes a big difference in speed.

I'm using a Gateway 2000 386/33 with Phoenix BIOS.  Anybody have any
insights into what's going on here?  I'd be interested to know.

Rich> Apparently Linux mmap() doesn't work right now.

The official word from Linus Torvalds is that mmap works *only in COW or
read only mode* (RW private, RO shared). You cannot use it to share
files in read write mode. A lot of sw uses mmap() in ro or COW mapping
mode, e.g.  shared libraries.

Unfortunately Linus Torvalds has not put in any error code if it is used
in RW shared mode... Eventually he shall add the bits needed to support
it.

Well, we can just wait for the next release (0.99999PL207 perhaps? :->).

How about using latitude and longitude?  It works for uucp mapping, and

: Well, there's a couple MatLab clones (Rlab and something else), a simple

The "something else" is called Octave, latest version I know about is 0.74.
It's a Matlab-clone with a gnuplot interface for graphing.  The core and 
interface are c++, and the numerical functionality is provided by f2c'd Netlib
routines.  The PD packages implemented are blas, dassl, fftpack, fsqp, lapack,
linpack, minpack, odepack, quadpack, ranlib, and villad.  In addition, there
are hooks for the npsol and qpsol packages, if your site is licensed for them.

I've got the packages running on my R4000 Indigo at work, as well as my Linux
box at home.  It seems very complete, and should be script-file compatible 
with Matlab.  (The comment character is different, but the syntax is the same).
I've corresponded briefly with the author about an extension I'm working on, 
and he was very helpful with info about the internals and calling structure
(now if I can just figure out how this c++ stuff works...).

Anyway, I'm very impressed with the package, particularly when you compare its
cost with that of Matlab 4.1 for a workstation.

Source and precompiled binaries for i486-linux, i486-svr4, m68k-next-bsd,
mips-dec-ultrix4.2, rs6000-ibm-aix3.2, and sparc-sun-sunos4.1.2 are available
