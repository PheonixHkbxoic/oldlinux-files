Well, slowly I'm beginning to understand why Linus needs all this beer
(as we saw on the pictures Lars distributed some time ago). My system
has been running w/ XFree1.2 and the kernels up to .99pl9 for months,
with the only reboot being to install new kernel patches or to put in
some new hardware. No problems, I loved it!

And now, what did I do? I put in pl12, even switched over from extfs
to ext2fs, which cost me hours, because that SLS-a1.5 disk wouldn't
boot my machine, and I installed XFree1.3 as well as libc4.4.1. Once
every six months or so, I thought, you can make a big update action.
And now I getting crazy! X never runs for more than 12 hours, then the
machine crashes totally. Sometimes this looks like the big slow-down:
xterm scrolls a couple of lines, then you see some pixel lines being
scrolled, then the machine stands still. I've seen this on Sparcs when
the network gets crammed by some stupid machine (a linux box I had
somehow mis-installed). But the network seems ok now.

What seems to go along with the crash is a heavy load on the machine,
like X and TeX running with lots of output in a xterm. Then sometimes
it takes four or five reboots until I can open a file in emacs w/o a
crash. Certainly doesn't cheer you up if you have a deadline for a big
paper. Hell, who did what to this great system???? This sure tells me
we're still far, far away from 1.0 (even in P-space).

Nope. I ("we  europeans") had  access to  386bsd as well  as to  Linux.

In order to get  a running system plus kernel sources, you  just need a
hard disk with a size multiple of what you need for Linux. When I first
installed  Linux (Oct/Nov. 1992), it was so  slender that you could get
all  the base utilities including cc,  emacs and kernel sources into as
much as a 32 MB hard disk!

Plus there is  much more support for  "cheap" hardware and for  two-or-
more-OS's-on-one-harddisk. Traditionally, when you wanted UN*X, you had
to buy the hardware  that was supported. And  imho, 386bsd still has  a
bit of this attitude. Linux goes the other way: it makes  the OS run on
the hardware you've already got.

Question,

What's the distance record for slip connections under Linux.  I think
I am doing pretty well,  I am running Linux on a TI TravelMate in
Melbourne Australia, dialing my home in Austin, Tx USA.  That's got to
be pushing over 8000 Miles.  Maybe more!  Can anyone beat that?

Inquiring minds want to know!

The SLS install disk stupidly insists on having millions of drivers installed
You need to find someone with Linux up to build you a kernel that doesn't
go looking for SCSI, strange sound cards and other things you don't have.

***Will the SLS people __PLEASE__ include an A1.3SCSI and an A1.3GENERIC
disk that contain nothing extra but SCSI, and nothing extra at all. The
SLS boot disk fails on far far too many machines because of all the fancy
device detection code.

Exactly!!

Or maybe the [386]bsd[386] suffer from the
association with one specific instruction set?

        [hey, finally I've a 486 now!]

Or are there just so many Linus, Charlie Brown, Snoopy,... fans around?  :^)

You should be lucky to see these lines. This means your syslog daemon
is up and running. It is a simple information, that your system is
alive. Take a look at /etc/syslog.conf. There's a line kernel:
mark.debug. If you don't want to see the mark notice anymore, just
comment it out.

well, I've made the switch from Coherent to Linux.
It looks great!  Here's some things I ran across while installing:
(this is SLS 1.03 from 081193)

- always start with a good set of disks :-)
  I wasted 4 hours becuase I made a mistake when doswriting the
  disks on my RS6000 - redoing them solved the problem

- always write protect the disks
  If not, they are effectively transformed into gibberish,
  neither a DOS disk nor a UNIX one

- even with 4Mb of RAM, I always saw problems with memory (ramdisk)
  until I read about swapon before installing.  I think this solved the problem.
  I didn't think that this would be a problem though.

- now that the system is installed, with one user on if I run top
  I see that of 4Mb, only 250Kb or so is available.  Why so
  little?

- I'll have to check the uucp FAQ, but there appears not to be a uulog
  command.  uucico -x9 should provide full debugging output but
  doesn't.  I'll poke around with this some more.

- Coherent uses MMDF style (^A) mailboxes, so linux can't read them.
  I'm writing a script to convert these...

- overall, performance is excellent, much better than Coherent at a
  prompt level.  I'll seee what I/O looks like, although cpio to disk 
  is pretty good speed-wise.

Comments/Advice welcomed (uhoh)...

I received the package some weeks ago and think it's absolutely GREAT.
It takes very short to build a working gui with the builder. There is
a context-sensitive online Documentation with examples (takes fewer than 
an hour to build a calculator application). You can run any application
either as openlook or motif by a comand line switch. Only Problem is 
resource consumption (there were some points where the builder ran out of 
memory with my 8+8MB box; the binaries are really large). I think shared libs
and working on the memory management would help gratefully.

        I do not think that there is any deficiency - the problem is that it is
hard for iozone to determine when writing has finished and reading has started
since the writes are all deferred.

        These numbers seem a little low to me as well.  I can offer the
following suggestions.  First of all, start out by using a fast filesystem like
minix, ext2 or xia.  Do not even bother trying to benchmark ext.  A relatively
clean filesystem will give the best indications of the actual SCSI throughput -
once a disk starts getting full then the file starts getting fragmented.  The
actual throughput also depends on the drive you are using as well, and whether
it has a cache or not.  I have seen numbers in the 500-700 Kb/sec range from
several people.  There are caching controllers which from a software point of
view are clones of the 1542B, and I have heard about numbers like 1.1Mb/sec.

        Finally, linux by default has been using a 1Kb blocksize for
filesystems.  In newer kernels there is support for larger blocksizes,
and I have also seen better results under these situations.  There was some
strange problem whereby the disk access speed dropped quite considerably when
4Kb blocksizes were used with the ext2 filesystem, and I do not know if this
has been resolved or not.  When I run iozone on a naked partition I get numbers
> 1Mb/sec with a 1542B.
