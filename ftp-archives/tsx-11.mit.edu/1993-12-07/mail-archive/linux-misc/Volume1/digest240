Ian is right on this one.  Ever hear of the "Golden Rule"?  This
should be a corollary - "Don't expect something from others which you
are not prepared to give yourself."

Then there must be nothing wrong with ignoring such arrogant requests.
There ARE other resources for answering questions that Ian spends
*his* time bringing to our attention.  You just complain about it.  I
consider his time more valuable to the Linux community than yours.

People should make use of them rather than waste other people's time.
When you take 1 minute to post an asinine question, upwards of 1000 or
5000 people will spend 10-20 seconds to decide it was stupid and
perhaps 10 will take the time to reply (when the question could be
answered by RTFM.)

> Ian, please give it a rest and give us all a break.

[low]  "my" minute -> 1000 * 1/6 = 167 minutes
[high] "my" minute -> 5000 * 1/3 = 1667 minutes

Could all the people wasting our time out there RTFM and give us all a
break?

[best] "my" hour reading the FAQ -> 60 minutes
[best] "my" 5 minute period scanning the FAQ for one answer -> 5 minutes

I have a Compaq 386DX-20 and I'm running the tinyX distribution successfully.
Believe me, it was painful to install mainly because the Compaq video 
controller suc*s and I had to disable it and put in a Trident 9000.  It's
slow but works fine.  If you don't have a swap space you might want to make
one.  I have 10 meg of swap space and I'm using it all the time.

You can find the tinyX dist at sunsite.unc.edu.

I think it's in the directory /pub/Linux/X11/tinyx but don't hunt me down
if it's not but it's close.

Good luck.

But what harm does it do for Linux to be able to remain free yet run both
commercial and free software?  Many would have use for Linux in other places
if it ran commercial software....  Without SCO at our work (or some other Unix
with commercial software capabilities), we might as well not even have
computers because little "free" software would meet our needs.

:Steve
:harringt@netcom.com

    I have 16MB of ram and 64MB of swap.  I admit to going overboard :-)
    but basically speaking, the more swap you have the better.  If you
    have a 200+ MB hard drive I suggest reserving at least 16MB for
    swap.  If you have more, I suggest reserving at least 32MB for swap.  
    And I suggest you use a swap partition instead of a swap file!  The
    more recent kernels can take advantage of a large partition without
    having to resort to (messy) multiple swap partitions or files.

    There are quite a few programs that use a lot of space:

        X               nominal 3-8 MB
        mosaic+xv       nominal 4-16MB
        groff           2 MB
        gs color->X     2 MB
        gs mono         2 MB  (i.e. postscript->bitmap for lpr)
        gs clr printer  6 MB  (i.e. postscript->bitmap for lpr)
        xterm           1 MB

    Quite a bit of this space can be swapped without effecting performance,
    but you need to have enough swap space to hold the swapped stuff.

    For example, take a look at X (pid 434), and xterm (pid 21016 and 20788).
    Also note the large number of programs which are swapped out completely,
    taking no real memory, but still requiring swap space.

the keyboard LED's as load indicators. The Xfree86 xload bin still 
enables the flag but it doesn't seem to work. Anyone have this port?

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

It's done and should be in pl13k. There are some important warnings however.

Do NOT have any ip routes etc setup on the promiscuous mode interface if you
have IP_FORWARD enabled. The IP code doesn't understand the promiscuous mode
to tell and becomes a rather busy gateway. I'll fix this soonish. 

Apart from that its great. I've been monitoring and debugging my Linux IPX
stuff with the code.
