Hahah..  'kay, sure, whatever. I'll stick to Linux. even WITH the
occasional glitch.  You get what you pay for, and when i pay for NT all i
get is ripped off..

>Angry that after all the gloat about how lean and mean linux is, NT's

I'd like to see just how fast NT is on a 386/25 with 8mb ram compared to
Linux.   Thats all I wanna see.  *SOME* of us cannot afford a DEC Alpha AXP
to run our 'pathetic' OS.  

(BTW: When we gonna get Linux Alpha *grin*)

I dunno, I'm too lazy to do backups of my system, so i've got the exact
same Minix filesystems (4 of 'em, count 'em. ick. I know, i know) that I
had waaaaay back when Linux was in release 0.12  

seems stable enough.  Lighting storms, cat attacks, thousands of ungraceful
three-finger salutes during program development..  my disks havent'
complained once..  You're supposed to have to Sync on a Unix box, right?
Guess linus fixed it *smile*  He is a god.



>For crying out loud, you even have to recompile the
>whole os in order to add the littlest of drivers!

Okay.  Fair enough. Kernel compilation is a bitch.  takes me about 15
minutes to compile a full kernel.  the kernel is 350k.  it boots up
compressed. I dont care. It's better than the sun's I use with 2mb kernels
and 4 hour compile times.
NT, you're outta your league.

>You know what your problem is? You stare at your os too much! I mean,
>let's face it, you have *NO* applcations, and as such all you can do

No applications? i have *ALL* the applications.  Everything ever written fo
a unix machine anywhere in the world ever is easy enough to port.  I have
every application I want on my linux pc.   I now even have Messy-DOg
support, which is nice because occasionally I want to use a term program.
Qmodem is nice.   We got WINE on the way.. binary compatibility. very nice.
I'll be able to run CakeWalk professional *without* needing to load up
MS-Windows 3.0 in my DOS emulator first. that makes me smile.  Can NT run
cakewalk professional? I even have *APPLE II* games cause the apple II
emulator compiled clean on my system.  go away. You lose.

And I suspect the first thing the Amiga Linux people are going to do is mac
a mac 'wabi' for their systems considering amigans can already run mac os
stuff with an appropriate set of rom images..

What the shit is drag and drop?  izzat that horrible creature that makes me
have to have icky evil little icons for all my text files all cluttering up
my screen at the same time?   Naff off, pal, I dont *want* it. (and yes, we
do have it. XView 3.0. you lose again, evildo-er.)

>don't even have a file manager for pete's sake!

Do too.. Xdtm.  But i think its horrible. Pardon me, but my keyboard
generates letters, its only appropriate that all my windows be filled with
them too.   You can do what you like tho. We've got it.  You lose.

Mine does my jobs better than DOS/Windows ever did. Maybe you're jobs are
just too menial for a superior OS like linux.

Didnt i just mention that above. We can already run DOS and Windows apps
(by runnign Windows under the dos emulator on another VC).  so.
Winword - put it up for anonymous ftp and i'll run it on my system once.
Word Perfect - I run this under the dos emulator since running the X11
version from my schools campus over a 9600 term connection is kinda slow
and horrible and i dont wanna think abotu it when i'm writing a term paper.
helllloo dosemu. :)
Lotus 123 - I dont need it but it runs. windows version too. ftp it
somewhere and i'll prove it to you.
"any spreadsheet" - you dont believe my claim for Lotus 123. Fine. You're
an OS bigot, i didnt expect you to anyway.  we've got 'calc' or whatever it
was called. its in the comp.sources.unix archives somewhere.  it runs.
Procomm, Xtalk - yeah, but qmodem's better anyway. once again, dosemulator.

Only difference i see between your apps and our apps is that you're trying
to justify having spent $500 on Word Perfect for Windows and flaming on our
hand crafted os.  

Your superior os runs less programs than ours. go figure.

No, you sure didnt. at least the guy who wrote that checklist bothered to
at least pick up a copy of linux somewhere, possibly.   Maybe i'll bother
to pick up a copy of NT when its released.  Oops, sorry.  its not for FTP
is it.  Your loss of a user then, i guess.  I'll spend my $110 on *EATING*
not on my OS.

When Ham Radio operators make contacts at that distance (or even across town
in some cases :-) they exchange "QSL cards" in the mail afterward.  Of course,
since you're just calling home, you can send yourself the card.  :-)

>Can anyone beat that?

Not me.

Seriously, you've got a lot of us at a disadvantage so I can see why you
wanted to make a contest out of it.  :-)  My maximum hop for SLIP is about
5 miles.

Hmmm... kremvax.hq.demos.su is 700ms from Santa Clara to Moscow and back.
Sheesh!  I can barely beat your 8000 miles if I change the rules! :-)

I don't expect many people can get much better than your number because
12,000 miles is the maximum surface distance... and we have a disadvantage
from the U.S. since that opposite point on the globe is probably in the
middle of the Indian Ocean.  (Anyone got a globe?  Don't post it - it's off
the subject... :-)

Right.  But you know that most people don't do things that require much
of their machines anyway, right?  Word processing isn't exactly a CPU-

Yeah, I've noticed.  :-)  Broken hardware is actually more of an issue to
the Linux community than it is to various software manufacturers.  Why?
Because if your hardware's broken, most software manufacturers will just
say "Tough shit.  Get working hardware", whereas we're actually concerned
about getting it to run on whatever hardware is out there (thus the effort
that goes into the device drivers to support broken hardware).  This is a
huge plus for Linux in the long run, since the more hardware it'll run on,
the more people will use it.  Some flavors of Unix support as impressive
an array of hardware, but not many support the wide variety that Linux
supports.

Right.  Someone posted about the memory problem and how Linux gets real slow
when something eats all available memory.  But I'll bet that most systems
will have problems with a program like that.  If you want to really be evil,
you can do something like:

main(void)
{
char *foo;
int size = 1024 * 1024;

    while ( 1 )
        if ( ! ( foo = malloc ( size ) ) ) size /= 2;
}

Bounce the connection off a satellite, or two.  That gives you much
more than 12,000 miles:  more than 71,000 km.

You could also try phreaking the connection around the Earth several
times.

Anybody know if the Voyagers have dial up SLIPS?
Hmmm...

Probably true, but probably not for quality reasons.

Besides, we don't *really* care.  We can run whatever we damn well please.
If it ends up being NT, it's no skin off my back.  We'll just write an
emulator for it, so that people don't have to buy the real thing.  :-)

>Angry that after all the gloat about how lean and mean linux is, NT's
>kernel is less one fifth that size? Tough! 

Before or after you add the networking code?  Before or after you add the
filesystem code?  Before or after you add the device drivers?  Before or
after you add the GUI?

I'll bet the kernel size you tout is before you add anything to make the
system actually *function*...

If your kernel is so small, why do you require 60 meg of hard drive space,
MINIMUM, to install it?  Why do you require 12 meg of memory, MINIMUM, to
run it?

I can install a fully functional Linux setup on a system with 2 meg of
memory and 20 meg of hard drive space.  Been there, done that.  I can put
X and other such things on a system with 4 meg of memory and 40 meg of
hard drive space, WITH ROOM TO SPARE.

Try *that* with your "small" operating system...

>Or that your file system
>falters more often than it works? (how many times a day does the extfs
>get corrupted?) 

Okay, let's see a show of hands.  How many people using extfs?  How many
using ext2fs?  How many using xiafs?  How many using minixfs?  How many
using minixfs with 32 character filenames?

I've got news for you, pal, xiafs has been *completely stable* for me.  ZERO
PROBLEMS.  Period.  Judging from the lack of bug reports I've seen on the
net, I'm inclined to think that my experience isn't unique.  End of
discussion.

>For crying out loud, you even have to recompile the
>whole os in order to add the littlest of drivers!

Wrong.  There's a patch to the kernel that lets you load device drivers
at runtime.  Not many people use it, but it *is* there.

And, in any case, we have this nifty little utility called "make", which
causes recompilation of only those things that have changed.  So you have
to re-link your kernel, or compile the whole thing if you've removed all
your object files, but during development you only recompile the things
you've changed.  Nuff said.

>You know what your problem is? You stare at your os too much! I mean,
>let's face it, you have *NO* applcations, 

Emacs.  Tex.  Ghostscript.  X.  Any application running under X for which
source is available.  Any Unix utility for which source is available.

To my knowledge, there's one, and only one, application that doesn't exist
for Linux directly, and that's a word processor.  Everything else is there.

And oh, by the way, you can run a word processor in the DOS emulator if
you really want to.

And oh, by the way, just about any language you want is available just for
the asking.  FOR FREE.  That means: basic, fortran, C, C++, lisp, prolog,
smalltalk, Ada, etc.

I think you'll find, like I have, that there are certain cases where it's
real useful to have a file manager around and there are others where the
command line is a lot faster.  Just depends.  But a file manager isn't
the be all and end all that you seem to think.

I agree that X could use a good one, though.

However, the Windows 3.1 file manager (haven't seen the NT one) leaves much
to be desired.

Under dosemu, yes.

Yup.  Oleo, from the FSF.  Or SC.

>Procomm?

You're joking, right?  There are a number of communication programs floating
around for Linux, some of which do more than Procomm.  But the big killer
that Linux has is:

    UUCP.

I know that MS-LOSS has Waffle, but let's see it do something real.  I've
set up a nifty remote execution facility through UUCP that keeps me from
having to log in in order to do what I need to do.  Works like a hose.
Try *that* with Waffle...

Not sure what this is.

>Go figure. And on top of that we now have the superior os!

That remains to be seen.  All the reports I've heard say that NT is buggy
as hell.
