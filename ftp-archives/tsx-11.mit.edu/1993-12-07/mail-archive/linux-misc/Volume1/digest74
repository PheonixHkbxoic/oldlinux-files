First this doesn't need to be in the kernel - you can do it in user space.

And second, it's called gzexe :) Read the man page...

     NAME
          gzexe - compress executable files in place

     SYNOPSIS
          gzexe [ name ...  ]

     DESCRIPTION
          The gzexe utility allows you to compress executables in
          place and have them automatically uncompress and execute
          when you run them (at a penalty in performance).  For
          example if you execute ``gzexe /bin/cat'' it will create the
          following two files:
              -r-xr-xr-x  1 root  bin   9644 Feb 11 11:16 /bin/cat
              -r-xr-xr-x  1 bin   bin  24576 Nov 23 13:21 /bin/cat~
          /bin/cat~ is the original file and /bin/cat is the self-
          uncompressing executable file.  You can remove /bin/cat~
          once you are sure that /bin/cat works properly.

          This utility is most useful on systems with very small
          disks.

This comes with gzip so it's probably kicking about somewhere on your hard disk
(it's in /usr/bin on mine - I know where everything on my system came from).

Of course it's a bit of a cheat, it just uncompresses to /tmp, but it is good
for things that you usually do in the background and you don't mind if they
take a little longer than normal (like the more esoteric parts of groff for
instance). I can't imagine it being much use in a multiuser environment
somehow, and of course if you want to do something similar with data that you
expect to write to as well as read it all gets very very messy which is why we
don't have Stacker for Linux (yet?).

I have a CTX monitor with a ET4000 based vga card...
anyway, now, when I turn on the monito, the light doeoesn't come on,

I checked the fuse it's fine...
It seems that the entire monitor isn't dead thouogh..

I didnt have this behaviour with Linux pl9, but now I'm getting it
in pl12. It could be kernel related, or maybe shared libraries.
Anyway: if I am in elm or trn, and I start vi (elvis) with a reply or
post; vi/elm/trn gets really confused when I type ^Z suspending vi;
then when I type fg in bash, I have returned to both vi and elm.

I havent seen this behavious since about pl6 or so. Is it bash? vi?
linux?

...except that this only works if you compress each block independently.
Otherwise you *still* have to start compressing earlier in the file so that
the compressed block you want can be uncompressed.  And if you're doing it
this way then there are better implementations and, I suspect, better
algorithms (gzip being optimized for compressing large files, you'd need a
horrendously large blocksize to get the same result you get outside the
kernel).

No, you're missing the point I was responding to:  putting /usr/bin/gzip in
the kernel is *not* the way to do it.  Compressing individual blocks is easier
and faster to implement than trying to use a stream-compressing algorithm,
although I think Stephen was aiming at something else again.

    I disagree. The number and quantity of 1 around now is a plus
compared to when I installed my first linux just back in February. I
look at the quality of information available now and wonder sometimes why
there's 100 questions a day on the newly created c.o.l.help. 50% of the
questions there are from people who obviously didn't read the messages
on the spool, much less the fags and how-to's. It seems to me that a
fundamental problem is that with linux as easy to install as it is,
people seem to expect that everything about setting up a unix system
should be that easy. 
    While many people are also working hard to try to make everything
easy to set up, I wonder if this doesn't create a false impression about
linux and unix systems in general. Unix is much easier to use once you
know a bit about what you are doing, but it requires that you put some
work into learning what you are doing. Making so much as easy as it is
becoming, IMO, builds a false sense that it's all going to be as easy as
the installation. As someone said in another post, grep is your friend,
and I find 90% of what I need to know by keeping all the FAQ's and
postings about linux that I've read for the last 3 months that look like
they might be handy someday in a folder where I can do keyword searches
really quickly.

>There are only a few possibilities to avoid whining about the

    This is the key. Read the linux groups, if available, for at least
a month before trying an install would be my suggestion.

    As a suggestion to package creators, I'd suggest integration of the
docs in the various packages rather than on a separate series. I get the
impression that a lot of people don't bother getting the SLS 'd' series,
for instance.

    I think the new install.how-to qualifies in this case.

Is this really a bug in the kernel?  What's going on?  

Putting /swap on a little-used disk is usually a very good idea,
because it reduces disk seeks.  But if it crashes GCC (which, BTW, is
not a bug in GCC but in the kernel) it should obviously be avoided.

They are a little company in Mount Clemans, Michigan that does the Linux
distribution sales thing.  I think for around $60 or so they can get you a
copy of SLS.  I've been propositioned by them but alas, havn't had the time
to mess with anything more than the LSM.  I talked with Dan Irvin for quite
some time and he seems to be a pretty straightforward fellow with reasonable
business objectives and a good sense of what Linux is all about.

You can get it touch with Linux Systems Labs at (313) 954-3152 or you can
email Dan at  dirvin@vela.acs.oakland.edu

In an "official" LSM Maintainer capacity, I won't endorse anyone, but you
could do worse than LSL.

From your local Linux Book Store, of course. Geez. Doesn't anybody go
to the mall anymore?

All right, all right. Linux Installation and Getting Started is probably
the book refered to here. You can get it from sunsite.unc.edu in 
/pub/Linux/docs/LDP. It is a complete book on getting and installing Linux,
mostly the SLS release, and includes full chapters on beginning UNIX
usage, UNIX system administration, and other fun stuff. It is for the UNIX
novice and wizard alike. 

Check out the README there for more details.

A few folks out there are selling printed copies for huge prices. Too bad
Kinko's isn't cheaper for bulk-rate photocopies, but that's life. I don't
sell printed copies of the book myself; I really don't have time (even if
I did have a nice printer and Xerox machine).

On the side, I think that Peter's response is appropriate. I think he's
a good guy. If you don't like SLS, you should help to fix it or put out
your own release (it makes my job a lot easier if you just help SLS or
another exisiting release in some way... keeping up with dozens of separate
releases is starting to become difficult). If you have problems with 
Peter's philsophy and design, nobody is forcing you to use SLS. And, Peter
shouldn't be held responsible for everything. 

The best thing to "save" SLS would be to have a knowledgeable group of
volunteers help to fix it up. I would, if I had the time.

All newbies have to read is the (new, SMALL) Linux FAQ by Ian Jackson.
It is on sunsite.unc.edu in pub/Linux/docs/faqs. Then they can read
the Installation HOWTO, by myself, in pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. All of the
pointers are in place. There's no reason for a newbie to read 100's of
documents: there are really only TWO documents (the FAQ and the Installation
HOWTO) of interest to newcomers. We stress that as much as possible.

The new organization of the HOWTO's should make it very easy for newcomers
to find the "right" docs and to know which ones to read and which to ignore.
Things are pretty clear these days; at least, on sunsite, the docs are
well-organized. :)
