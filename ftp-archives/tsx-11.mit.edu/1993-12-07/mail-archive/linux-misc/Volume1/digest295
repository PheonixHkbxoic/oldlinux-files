Subject: Dell Pentium Linux
Date: Mon, 08 Nov 93 20:37:59 GMT

The memory bus in Dell "Standard" Pentium based computers is clocked
at the same speed as the 60 MHz Pentium processor and moves 64 bits
at a time between the processor and the 70 nanosecond Dynamic RAM.
They use Intel's 32-bit 30 MHz PCI bus instead of the VESA Local Bus
architecture used by AMBRA.  They have a larger hard disk drive
but only a 16-bit 30 MHz disk controller.  You will wait at least
SIX WEEKS for delivery from the day you place your order.

I was able to get the information I needed from Dell immediately.
Their Sales Representatives new much more about their product
than their counterparts at AMBRA knew about theirs.

Dell will install DOS 6.0 and Windows but NOT Linux.

I called the toll free number (1-800-879-3355) for Dell Computers
and got Sales Representative Mike Eckert at extension 67071.
He quoted me a price of $3499 for their "Standard" Pentium based
system which includes:

*       60 MHz Intel Pentium processor
*       16MB 70 ns system memory
*       528MB IDE hard disk drive
*       3.5" floppy disk drive
*       16-bit disk controller
*       15", 0.28mm dot pitch non-interlaced Super VGA color monitor
*       1MB 1024x768 S3 video controller on the PCI bus
*       Desktop case
*       Keyboard and Microsoft mouse

This system compares with the Gateway 2000 "Best Buy" Pentium based system.
The difference in price can be accounted for in the extra 8MB system memory
and the extra 100MB disk space.  Bob Tisdale (edwin@cs.ucla.edu)

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

Bad behaviour on the part of the sitemaster, unless he explicitly
knows that all those 500 people actually do use Linux, and,
much more importantly, _want_ to be counted and possibly
put into a list of Linux users.

I'd say the best thing is to not count any of those e-mails
and send back an explanation to the sitemaster telling why.

Encouraging others to do the same thing is a bad idea.  Don't
do it.

Subject: Does Linux run on Pentium and/or PCI bus machines?
Date: 12 Nov 1993 16:46:16 GMT

Hi,

        I am trying to decide what system to get for linux and I wanted to know
if Linux ran
on Pentium and/or PCI bus machines. And if not, what kind of support
would I have to add
to the kernel. I know that an EISA/VESA system would work but I need the
floating point
performance of the Pentium and would rather not buy a new system in 6
months to a year
the new 486dx3 will be pretty fast but not for floating point as compared
to the Pentium.

    Thanks,

I don't know what's needed for ncurses. It's not enough to just change
the Makefile to -lncurses.

vacation is the utility answering mail when you're absent, and it

I'm looking for a program which can automagically retreive new files from an

Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.

I think you should stick with the SCSI interface (option 3, get a decent
SCSI card).  The IDE interface is good only for DOS and Windows.  For
advanced operating systems, SCSI is the choice.

Subject: Q: mounts via msdos chunks ?
Date: 12 Nov 93 18:05:07 GMT

My goal is to mount large files from the dos partition as
a filesystem on the linux side. Then it could be possible
to have some of these smart all-on-one boot floppies
together with a special installation procedure, that installs
additional disks on these mounts. So it would be possible
to give a big LINUX demo (incl. X), without running any fdisk!

It could work like this:
the dos partition is mounted as /dos and has 50 MB free.
An 'empty' file with 40 MB is created as /dos/chunk1
mount -t fileMount /dos/chunk1 /myDir

All following actions in /myDir would access blocks within the
XX MB chunk. Which gives a full filesystem (longnames etc.)
which  resides  physically on the dos disk space.

I once made a test with the 'loop'? filesytem which allows this kind
of mounts even with encryption. But as far as I remember it failed for
files which were on a dos mount. I think the mount was dead waiting
for some io stuff.

Finally my question:
Did someone else think in this direction ?
Has anyone more experience  with mounts from files  (the 'loop?' fs) ?
Is there any reason that this kind of mount/demo is NOT possible ?

regards,
    HeDu
