I was wondering if anybody has ported BSD's Mail (aka /usr/ucb/mail) to
linux. I don't care very much for elm, and would like to have the same
mailer at home as on netcom. Would anyone care to document the different
mailers on sunsite.unc.edu:pub/Linux/system/Mail/ ?

Unfortunately, two of these programmes have shell escapes, so someone
can run termftp, !/bin/sh and have a shell with effective gid of term.
This then allows them to run tredir and trsh:

>term programs I dont want the general user population to run

This could be fixed quite easily by changing the source to the setgid
programmes to do setgid(getgid()); or something similar just before
they shell out.

Date: 5 Sep 1993 04:06:42 GMT
Reply-To: bf703@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Patrick J. Volkerding)


There have been a few minor updates to Slackware 1.0.2:
A1: tagfile, tagfile.org replaced.
A2: vgalib.tgz removed, diska2 edited.
A5: vgalib12.tgz and tvgalib.tgz added, smail.tgz removed, diska5 edited.
A12: install.end removed.
A13: Disk added: smail.tgz, diska13, install.end

Two more new disks were added: G1 and Q1.
G1 is a games disk. So far, this just has the "fortune" program on it.
Q1 is a disk containing the source for the new .99pl13 alpha kernel, and
two precompiled kernel packages, one for IDE and one for SCSI. The Q
series will contain alpha software, and may change or disappear at any
time.

Here's a copy of the official announcement sent to

I don't think anyone has the authority, or right, to prevent someone from
posting an add to c.o.l  -  However, I think vendors have a responsibility
to not create undo traffic with too many adds.  And with a lot of vendors
this can create a problem.

Linux vendors come and go as fast as new kernal pacthes, so to require
posting only in announce is hard too do, and besides who is going to enforce
this rule anyway?  The only group that can have any restriction is c.o.l.a
since it is moderated.  And a simple and enforcable rule that cuts down
traffic, creates a more equitable market place and better informed
consumers is a catalog.  However for those vendors who like to stick out
and get more attention, of course the catalog is a bad idea :)  Just a
thought. 

c.o.l* might have a standing rule of no more than one post a
week/two-week/month from any one vendor as another idea.

Hmmm! use -I/usr/include/bsd in CFLAGS and -lbsd when linking.
Note that /usr/include/bsd/sgtty.h does not define gtty and stty. use ioctl

I can't remember the answer to this one, but it is one ptr - another ptr. It

code should not use internals of stdio, try and avoid it.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix.
The FAQ for this group is available on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq.

I think you guys are making this much more difficult than necessary.
All you have to do is #include <bsd/sgtty.h> and link with the bsd
library.  It may even be easier than that; you may get by with 
defining _BSD_SOURCE, but I haven't dug far enough to say that with
any certainty.  Porting BSD stuff you would probably want to define
_BSD_SOURCE anyway, so it's not going to hurt.

What kind of co-processor are you using? There have been problem-reports
with some clone 387's: if you have a clone, you might try the "no387"
command-line option to LILO to see if that changes the behaviour at
all..
