Ghostscript is a fully postscript-interpreter. It converts mostly
any PS-file to the most important printers or file-formats. To
test, start X and type 

              gs /usr/local/lib/ghostscripts/examples/tiger.ps

The only problem occurs, when using a non-standard font (I think).

I agree ... the installation of Linux is in general so simple....
Nobody should blame Peter for minor failures. I know other commercial 
installations with bigger problems !

I see another problem ... there are now so many FAQ's to read ...
A newbie, who got only a copy of the Linux disks is overtaxed in
getting and/or reading all !!!!

There are only a few possibilities to avoid whining about the
installations and so on:

a) Learn a bit about Linux before installing
b) Buy the Linux Installation Book and read it prior installing
c) Make installation disks with a bit more help concerning
   creation of swap and filesystems ....
   "More help on the first steps"
d) Create a weekly posting that contains the most important
   installation stuff. Not more than on 2 pages.
   This printout could be included on top of the install disk
   or could be printed out if you give your Linux floppies
   to a friend....

Too much infos aren't as good as to few.....

Sorry if this is a stupid question. But could someone point out to me how to
start slip? I just installed the new version of SLS and assume that slip
is built into the kernel. But I have no idea about how to start it. Moreover,
I can not find any information about it at any place. Any help is appreciated.

Date: Mon, 30 Aug 1993 16:09:59 GMT


Last week I decided linux was something I wanted to become familiar with.
I bought a PC a few months ago, and had never worked with DOS or Windows, 
but am a long time UNIX/C engineer.  I am relatively disappointed with the
capabilities of Windows, after programming with X + Motif, DECWindows and
Openlook for years.

Anyway, I downloaded the SLS version to 30 floppy disks on Saturday afternoon
(I set up a script the night before to download the entire fileset from the
net).  This took a few hours.  Then went home and repartitioned my hardidsk,
with FIPS, making a 75 meg linux partition.  I first used the MS-DOS 'defrag'
utility to consolidate all my data to the front of the disk.  Defragging and
repartitioning took about 10 minutes.  The FIPS documentation was precise,
Mr. Schaefer has done a good job with that utility.

I then took the Matt Welsh 'Linux Installation and Getting Started' 
documentation in hand and installed linux.  After making the swap and primary
filesets on the linux partition, it took about 35 minutes to install 'a', 'b',
'c', and 'x' from the SLS fileset.  At the end of the installation, linux
made a bootfloppy for me.  I then booted linux, and there it was, a working
UN*X system.

I typed 'startx', and it did.  It did need some tweeking of the pre and post
syncs, which took another 40 minutes (with the help of the README.MODEGEN 
file by Mike Jagdis).  Then I was off and running, playing with the GNU
development tools, setting up user accounts, mail, playing with kermit, etc.

From the time I started the installation process (after creating the
floppies), an hour and a half later I was setting up a personal X
environment.  Amazing.

The purpose of this posting is express my appreciation to those who have 
given their time and effort in providing this environment for anyone who
wants it.  Over the course of my career, I have installed many software
packages, full OS's, upgrades, third party products, etc.  I have never
had a more trouble free installation.  I am impressed.

Hi Rodrigo !

About what problems are you speaking here ? Would be interested, 
what's really _wrong_ with SLS. Did I overlook something on my
(from SLS 1.01 to SLS 1.03) upgraded system ????

Ok, groff was missing some things in 1.01. But ok, I've fixed it.

I have the same feeling like Peter Mc Donald. It's really simpler
to flame someone, than to cooperate.
The same thing happended in the 386BSD group. One 386BSD distrib
chases the other ....

=============================================================
Why not making a TODO list for SLS 1.03 prior creating many
other alpha, beta, .... releases, 
which will have their flaws in the beginning, too !!!!!!!!!!!

Reply-To: abg1@midway.uchicago.edu
Date: Mon, 30 Aug 1993 17:26:06 GMT


A co-worker has finally convinced me to install Linux on my home box 
rather than buying UnixWare.  However, I am told that X drivers for
many Diamond products are not available, due to the folks at Diamond
being assholes about releasing technical details about their products.

I have a Diamond Speedstar 24x.  Since this is an older card, I was hoping
that an X windows driver might be available for it.  If this is the case,
could someone kindly e-mail me and let me know where to find it (my friend
is giving me the SLS distribution disks; is it already there?)?  

If it's not available, then I suppose I'll end up buying UnixWare afterall :-(

Here's an abridged list. (some only applies to SLS as it stood
in mid-July) 

 1. emacs requires X shared libs
 2. SLS.FAQ not updated since Mar12
 3. kernel used is an alpha release
 4. filesystem has gratuitous link in /dev
 5. gzip on root disk was at one point older than that
    used to compress packages, which caused problems. (i'm not sure
    about this one.) 
 6. net-2 installation was a mess in 1.02 because the scripts that
    were supposedly going to make it easier were only half-baked and
    very cluttered with what appeared to be someone else's config.
 7. scattered throughout the disks i have found packages that weren't
    even listed in the corresponding `disk??' file so they would never
    have been installed.  On two occasions this problem caused disks
    to contain more than the 1.2M limit for 5.25" floppies.

Considering the difficulty involved and the fact that this is
completely volunteer, SLS isn't really that bad of a job. 

My only point is that MCC is better.  That's all.

> I have the same feeling like Peter Mc Donald. It's really simpler
> to flame someone, than to cooperate.

I cooperate with the linux community by suggesting MCC as an
alternative distribution, and i have never flamed Peter personally.
Calling attention to the deficiencies of SLS is not flaming.

I can't speak for the majority, but I personally like Windows
because the box, with documentation and all, is perfect for
propping my office door open.  I have worried that someone
might steal it, but decided that in that case, it would be the
theive's problem to find a new use for it.

1) MS-Windows has a good base of easily accessed software
2) MS-Windows is bundled with most systems
3) MS-Windows is inexpensive
4) MS-Windows is rather easy to install and use in a single-user
   environment

These are the reasons I come up with.  Not that I like MS-"Windows", quite
the contrary.  It would be hard to knock MS-"Windows" off that pedestal, and
I really don't care if it is.  I prefer real operating systems but would
like access to the MS-"Windows" applications through WABI or whatever.

Win-blows is number one because most computer companies ship it with their
