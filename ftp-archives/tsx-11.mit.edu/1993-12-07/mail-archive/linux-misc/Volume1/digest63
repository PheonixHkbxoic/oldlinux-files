        any level n-way associative cache is very difficult (esp on 66dx2
        or true 50 mhz machines).  You need a VERY fast cache controller
        which would be very expensive.  Direct caching requires minimal

        cheaper.

There is a Sun Xkernel for machines like this. It doesn't run SunOS
binaries. It just acts as an Xterminal. I think that's what the original
poster was asking for. Also because it doesn't have all the other OS
overhead old Sun 3's actually get pretty good performance using it.
Does anyone know where they can be found? 

No clue on the RARP and TFTP problems,

I have it working, and I don't do it quite like you've explained...

You need to have two files on your boot disk - DBLSPACE.BIN and DBLSPACE.INI
They do not have to be in config.sys.

Edit DBLSPACE.INI so it uses drive D: instead of C: (since dosemu mounts
your normal C: as D:)  Now you should be able to access D: just fine.

I have not been able to boot off of the doublespaced drive.  I just use
a disk image file containing DOS and the above files.

You might want to check out the August 1993 issue of 
IEEE Micro magazine
It compares the influence of
cache line size versus associativity versus cache size versus unified
or separate data/instruction cache by simulating the SPEC benchmarks and
looking for cache misses.

Interesting data comes out!

Yeah, I made the fatal mistake of assuming something inside the PC was
designed *correctly*.  Sigh.

On the other hand, there *was* a slight slowdown when I disabled my cache last
night (trying yet another scheme to find out why Linux crashes when I put 16MB
in this motherboard... I gotta trash this thing.  SOON).

Std boot disk sounds good.  How about some with just the Linux logo, and

Yeah, I felt that way for quite some time, too. Then the first time I
tried to use some of Peter MacDonald's code in one of my own projects, I
found out about how "free" it really is. Mind you, this is code that was
released with a notice that said I could do whatever I wanted with it,
provided I did not try to take credit for it. I left all the copyright
notices intact, adding a couple lines noting that I had modified it.

Peter ordered me to cease and desist, saying something to the effect
that SLS is a business and that as such, he was going to run it like
one. He's selling his distribution for >$100, while mine is only offered
by FTP and those people offering to provide a download service for $2 a
disk. I have nothing to do with those people, who also offer SLS.

In my book, throwing obstacles in the way of a free software effort
because your profits may suffer constitutes leeching a living off of
free software. I'm still going to release my newer Slackware 1.02 once
the scripts have been reengineered. So, what's the bottom line? Because
Peter took a stance more befitting large software companies that shall
remain nameless, everyone using Slackware gets to wait an extra month
for the new release, which had been finished. Anyone who is able to get
Slackware for free could just as easily gotten SLS for free anyway.

You make the call.

Sun did initially announce the acronym.  I recall reading in the Sun
newsgroups that Sun was advised by their lawyers that it was a
mistake.  Recent announcements from Sun have not referred to it as an
acronym.  It is spelled Wabi, not WABI -- as it would be if it were an
acronym.  The notes say simply that Wabi is a trademark of Sun.

I think SunWorld is simply out of date.  Magazines have fairly
