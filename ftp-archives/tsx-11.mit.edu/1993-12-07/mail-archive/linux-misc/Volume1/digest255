Linux will ignore the setuid bit, just like SCO, because there are
a lot of easy ways to exploit setuid scripts.

I have a patch for Linux which fixes the security problem in the
kernel, and allows you to use setuid scripts, but you still need to be
*very* careful that there aren't any security problems in your shell or
your setuid shell scripts.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.

I did.  3 weeks ago.  That means I have about 4 weeks left to wait. :-|

Actually, the standard system comes with one more feature:

* Mitsumi CD-ROM drive  (still watching c.o.l.* to see if this is
                         the one the is already supported under Linux.)
* (You also get a CD-ROM disk with all the Messy-Glob SW on in. ) 

They claim they are using DRAM in the video card because VRAM
gave no performance increase.

Also, the have another package for $1000 more ($3995 total):

Same as above, with:

* 16MB of memoryinstead of 8MB
* 512MB (or thereabouts) IDE Hard drive
* 17'' monitor (CTX 1776)
* Choice of (Messy-DOG/LoseDoze) SW package (not useful for Linux,
                                             but you get no `delete' credit.)

Note that the 14'' monitor goes only to 1024x768.  The 15'' monitor
will go to 1280x1024 but it is interlaced.  The 17'' is the CTX
that will go to 1280x1024 non-interlaced.

Disclaimer:  It is 5am.  This is from memory.  I have a slight cold.
             Maybe I ordered 4 weeks ago.  Hope so :)

Read /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/console.c
(or /usr/src/linux/kernel/chr_drv/console.c if you have an older kernel -
the location was changed recently).
You will see that there are three translation schemes:
Latin (roughly: ISO 8859-1), VT-100 graphics, and none.
With the null translation you get what DOS calls code page 437,
which contains IBM graphics.
The virtual console is in one of two character-set states.
You switch between character sets using ^N and ^O (shift in / shift out).
You select the character sets you switch between using ESC ( x and ESC ) x
where x is one of B,0,U. The former defines the first character set, the
latter defines the second character set. The letter B,0,U defines what
translation you want.
The default is as obtained by ESC ( B ESC ) 0 ^N.

Subject: Expiriences with S3-Cards
Date: 30 Oct 1993 14:25:04 GMT

Does anyone have expiriences with S3-Card and Linux ?

The University brought a S3-Videocard (miro 8s/VLB) and is not satisfied with
it. I learned that this card had an S3-Graphic-Processor Typ 801 or 805 with
only DRAMs. I expected at least a S3-Card with VRAMs :-(

The S3-server for Linux refuses to use  linear-memory-accessing  and  higher
resolutions that 1024x768 (although 1152x900 should work with 1MB :-(
Later I learned some (or all ?) 801/805-chips had an bug preventing the
linear-memory-accessing...

My questions:
=============

  - Is this bug fixed ?

  - When yes:
     * Does the S3 X-server recognise it ?
     * Can I force the X-server to access the memory linear ?
     * Does the Spea-V7-Mirage use a corrected chip ?

  - When no:
     * Which S3-Videocards (with VLB) are able to access the memory linear ?
       (928 ?)
     * Which of these card have VRAMs ?


We want to repace the miro-8s card and want to buy another (a second) one.
Our dealer offered us a Spea-V7-Mirage....

We want an fast videocard, speed is important ...


Thanks in advance,

   Sven

So?  What do either of these have to do with an ad that basically says
"We sell such-and-such"?  Advertisements are not the customary place to
acknowledge who wrote a given piece of software.  As far as misleading
people, how does "we sell this" mislead people?  They are stating what
they do.  Nothing is stopping the potential customer from finding out
about other ways to get Linux.  If you want to publicize these other
ways, you can take out a BYTE ad of your own.

I agree, I run SLS and have no probems with it. Except for the fact
that it's hard to compile some things. But i blame that on having an
old GCC (and being to lazy at the moment to upgrade :)

all the other small problems that are found with using a new OS i fixed.

Subject: Looking for recommendations regarding SCSI equipment
Date: Sat, 30 Oct 1993 01:56:11 GMT


I am going to buy some SCSI equipment for my Linux box and I would like to
hear from people who have similar setups. The list of the supported and 
unsupported controllers is more or less clear; however, there have been
numerous complaints regarding apparently supported but misbehaving pieces
of equipment.

At his moment I have a 486DX66/33 EISA motherboard with 16MB of memory,
256KB cache, two internal disks (250Mb each), and a GUS sound card. A few days
ago I visited my dealer and came up with the following possible additions:

      CTR SCSI ADAPTEC 1540C (ADP-71-0021 JB)
      HD 1.03GB SCSI2 Fujitsu (FJS-70-000 JB)
      TD 525M SCSI VIPER 2525S (MND-71-0006 JB)

Apparently, 1540C is supported by Linux at this time. I wonder if somebody
has been using the above (or a similar) equipment and can share with me
their experience. I am flexible and can buy anything in the price/capacity
range of the above items, thus I am very open for suggestions.

It seems to me that a publicly available list of configurations that various
people are using happily may be of enormous help to the newcomers who try to
build their boxes. Most traffic in the groups is related to problems, and
(quite understandably) nobody bothers to write that he/she is happy with
his/her setup. Owing to the diversity of the PC-compatible machinery, a
database of this sort may not be completely useless.

Nice description... If I switch "turbo off", the 19.97 BogoMips (tm)
melt down to 4.41 BogoMips (tm).

So, if you do not have a turbo button, put a "turbo jumper" onto the
turbo switch connector pins on your motherboard.

I'm quite sure there'd be more than one explanation - but how about those
two kernels placing the BogoMips code at two different locations, and these
different locations happening to fall into two different (1MB) chips?

But there is another one - all else being equal, do you always get the same
BogoMips rating when you boot your system 10, 20, 30 times? ALWAYS?
