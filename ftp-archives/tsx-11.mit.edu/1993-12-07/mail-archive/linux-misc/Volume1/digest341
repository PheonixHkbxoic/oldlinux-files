Hi, Folks,

If you are a C++ developer or Linux package developer, there are
somethings you have to know about the upcoming Linux C library.

There will be a major change in the Linux C library in the coming
weeks. Starting from the next 4.5.x release of the Linux C library,
the C++ supports will be dropped from the Linux C library. The iostream
will be moved from libc.a to libg++.a. That means all the C++
binaries linked with the shared libc 4.x.x will be broken. If you are
a C++ developer or Linux package developer, you have to relink/recompile
all the binaries written in C++ when libc 4.5.x and libg++ 2.5.x are
released. The new shared C library will be binary compatible with all
the binaries written in C linked with the shared libc 4.x.x.

Besides that, /usr/lib/lbgcc.* have to be removed when libc 4.5.x
is out.

Right now, we are testing the new libc 4.5.2. It looks very good.
You can join the GCC channel on the Linux mailing list if you want
to participate the alpha/beta testing.

BTW, don't use libg++ 2.5.1. Please wait for the next release. I
hope it will include my fixes without which you will get core
dump.

Thanks for your attention.

That was my point:  I disbelieved the claim that the *implementation* was
being released, and posted reasons why I considered it unlikely.

I have since received clarification from NeXT about it, confirming that it is
in fact the *specifications* that are being released.  So can we lay this to
rest now?

Anyone else know something about it?

Subject: HELP - *big* problem installing Slackware 1.1.0
Date: 24 Nov 93 21:03:34 GMT


Hi there,

I'm currently trying to install version 1.1.0 of the Slackware distribution
for Linux onto my PC and I'm running into big problems.  The hardware I'm
trying to get Linux to *install* on (-nevermind run!) is as follows:

486DX2 @ 66MHz (256Kb cache)
8Mb RAM
340Mb hard disk 
  - controlled by a Vesa local bus, 2Mb hard disk cached
    controller (Promise Technology DC-4030VL)
1Mb Vesa local bus graphics card (SPEA VideoSeven Mirage)


Okay, what actually happens when I'm trying to install?  Well, I boot from 
the recommended Slackware bootdisk and everything goes okay there - no
strange messages.  The installation disk quotes my system memory availability
as:

Memory: 5748k/8448k available (576k kernel code/384k reserved/1704k data)

I login as root and run "fdisk" setting my partitions so that I have the 
following partition table:

  DEVICE   BOOT BEGIN START  END  BLOCKS   ID   SYSTEM
/dev/hda1   *     1     1    621  204902+   6   DOS 16bit >= 32M
/dev/hda2        622   622   963  112860   83   Linux native
/dev/hda3        964   964  1010   15510   82   Linux swap

I reboot my PC, as requested by Linux, to allow the new partition table
to come into effect.  Again, I let the bootdisk load and then login as
root.  Now, I run "setup".  I choose the UK keyboard layout (-as, strangely
enough, that's where I am) then, after briefly testing it's the correct
layout, I move onto the next part.

Setup correctly detects my inactive and no-filesystem swap partition, I
allow it to use /dev/hda3 as my swap partition and let it "mkswap" it.
Next, I choose the full installation option of the Slackware disks, choose
the filesystem type to be ex2fs and then re-confirm that I want a full,
fresh installation.  Again, setup detects my /dev/hda2 partition and offers
to set it up for the filesystem - I choose the 'check for errors too' option.
After a while, the filesystem is setup and I'm asked if I want to be able
to access any of my DOS partitions - I set it so that /dev/hda1 is accessible
as /dosc (-as given in the online example).

Finally, I am asked what set of disks I'd like to install - I choose the
complete installation series and select the "prompt" mode.

Okay, so everything appears to have gone smoothly so far - now comes the
bad news...  Sometimes at disk A1, sometimes at disk A5 or A6 and sometimes
immediately after I press the key to read the A1 disk the system crashes.  :-(

An example of the standard error message is as follows:

VFS: Disk change detected on device 2/28
Unable to handle kernel paging request at address c00000000
Oops: 0000
EIP: 0010:0010cc93

ds: 0018    es: 0018    fs: 002b    gs: 002b
Pid:0, process nr:0

task[0] (swapper) killed: unable to recover
Kernel panic: Trying to free up swapper memory space
In swapper task - not syncing


Now, even *I* can tell that is a serious error.  The question is, what on
earth is causing it???


Separate attempts I have tried to fix the problem:

1. Switched off the caching function of the HD controller and stopped
   the same card's BIOS being shadowed to another area of RAM.

2. Obtained a slightly newer bootdisk - I originally downloaded Slackware
   on 1st November.  I got a new bootdisk on 22nd November.

3. Switched on the 15Meg swap file with swapon /dev/hda3.

4. Obtained kbd-081.tgz, apparently it contains a newer version of either
   the loadkeys or keyboard maps.

5. Endlessly fiddled with the setup program, taking different "routes"
   through it.

Alas, it would seem that Linux still doesn't want to allow itself to be
installed on my machine.  And I mean installed.  I thought any problems
I might have with Linux and XFree wouldn't start till I was running them.

Please help me realise my dream of running Linux on my PC - I can't
stand MSDOS!!!  :-(

Thanks, in anticipation,





Colin.
P.S.  Well done!  You actually made it to the end of this long posting!!!  :-)

Subject: Re: TeX, SGML, and graphics?
Date: 25 Nov 1993 15:41:26 GMT


When reading my own message I found that I could have been a little
more specific.   As a matter of fact here is a description from the
readme file

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

DESCRIPTION:

  pstricks.tex is an extensive collection of PostScript macros that is
  compatible with most TeX macro packages, including Plain TeX , LaTeX
  AmSTeX and AmS-LaTeX. Included are macros for color, graphics, rotation,
  trees and overlays. It has many special features, including:

    * There is a wide variety of graphics (picture drawing) macros, with
      a flexible interface and with color support. All lines and outlines
      can be solid, dotted or dashed. Lines and curves can have arrowheads,
      t-bars, brackets or circles on the ends. Regions can be filled
      with solid colors, lines or crosshatch.
    * There is support for polar and cartesian coordinate systems.
    * There are macros for plots and axes.
    * Nested rotations can be made with respect to the physical page.
    * There are flexible node macros, useful for trees, mathematical
      diagrams, and linking information of any kind.
    * There is a powerful loop macro that is useful for making pictures.
    * There are macros for coloring or shading the cells of tables.

  PSTricks puts the icing (PostScript) on your cake (TeX)!

DISCLAIMERS:

  This is just an elaborate hack. Not for use as children's sleepware.

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

(love that disclamer)

I cannot recommend this package enough.  There is even a gnuplot
driver for PStricks which is very nice (albeit slower than using PS
and epsf/psfig).  You should find this driver in current versions
of gnuplot.  (Just 'set term pstricks unit' and gnuplot creates a
plot of size one unit, square.  Scale it to any size your heart 
desires using \psset{unit=6truein,xsize=6truein,ysize=4truein}
for instance.  This generates a 6"x4" plot (unit is a reference for
linewiths etc. and should be set approx. equal to xunit as a first
unless wider/narrower lines are desired).

As an example, here is a smiley that I rigged.

\def\smiley{
\psset{unit=1pt}       %set default size of a unit to be 1pt
\pspicture(3,0)(10,10)
\pscircle(5,5){5}      %transparent circle
\pscircle*(3,6){.5}    %solid  circle
\pscircle*(7,6){.5}
\psarc(5,5){2.5}{200}{340}
\endpspicture
}

If you get this package, you can say goodbye to all problems you may
ever have had rotating and positioning stuff in TeX.  PStricks can 
even scale a chunk of text, although if you use this with unscalable
fonts you have to be careful (hint: use PostScript fonts).

Flow-charts are easy, once you've figured out linking 'nodes'.

The PSTricks package comes with one of the best users manual I've seen
anywhere.

I really do not understand why they are turned off.  The reason the high
speed modems take so long to handshake is that they are sitting there
talking to each other negotiating the set of capabilities they share.  If a
v.32bis or v.32 modem with all the goodies is talking to a modem of lesser
capabilities, it will use the capabilities they share and no more.  Maybe
the system people at your site really do not understand this.  I have found
that not many people at all really understand modems.  There is also a
possibility the modems are not recognizing each other.  This happens between
modems of different brands or with different levels of the ROMs even if they
are the same brand.

This sounds like a network tuning problem at UTK.  The receive buffers on
the modem server may not be large enough, or the TCP packet size may not be
tuned properly.  I found that tuning had a major effect on speed.

One thing you do not say is whether you are running term in a manner that
allows you to monitor the noise.  If inbound handshaking is not working
right at UTK, then you may be getting a lot of timeouts.  I had this problem
until I took over the job of setting up and tuning our Xyplex 1600 modem
server to handle hardware handshake properly.
