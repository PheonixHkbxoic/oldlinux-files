Supposedly, for performance reasons, UDP checksumming is turned off
in many machines as shipped by default.  DEC is one of the few that ships

Yup, more like 486dx2/50.

>BAJ

The IBM 486slc/2 part is more similar in features to the Cyrix 486slc than
either the Intel 386sx or the Intel 486dx.  But it's lineage is Intel -> IBM.

  - 24 address lines,  maximum of 16 MBytes addressable memory.
        This is why the motherboard design only has sockets to allow up to 16 MB.

  - 16 data lines.  On the plus side, it allows cheaper memory expansion
        (2 MBytes at a time).  On the minus side, it means easier bus saturation.
        The effect of this is masked in DOS/Windows because the code is 16 bit code,
        and most variables, pointer, constants are one word.  Linux and other 32 bit
        systems will feel this limitation to some degree.

  - 16 KByte on-chip primary cache.  This masks the effect of the 16 bit data
        bus.  Since the on-chip cache can run at full 66 MHz, you get good looking 
        performance figures.  

  - no on-chip fpu.

  - IBM has a license to the Intel micro-code.  However, they are prohibited from
        selling chips that are not on a "planar" (circuit board).  They are selling 
        these motherboards as a way to ship chips.

  - IBM's clock doubling circuits & 3 Volt process.

I've seen one of these boards that my friend bought.  Good price for great performance.
(He runs just DOS/Windows.)  Watch out though, as on the board I saw, the math co-
processor (Cyrix) was a 50 MHz part clocked at 66 MHz.  The CPU was hidden by a heat
sink, so I don't know if that was being over-clocked, as well.  It likely was.
The oscillator is in a socket on that board with provision (unused) for separate
FPU oscillator.

Interesting.  The first thing I can put my hands on is the Sun
PC-NFS Serial Communications Guide (revision C, Mar 1991), although
I can dig deeper if necessary.  On page 16 it says "Services such
as telnet, ftp, rsh, rcp ... use the TCP protocol, which provides
end-to-end data integrity.  However, much of PC-NFS is based on
the UDP protocol, which in most cases does not include data
integrity protection."  The manual then goes on to discourage
the use of NFS over error-prone lines.

I looked into this about a year ago, and obtained the relevant RFCs
from some ftp site or other.  As I recall, these supported the further
generalization to NFS over the internet.  I have them around
here somewhere (I think), but they are locatable through the file
RFC-INDEX.TXT on nic.ddn.mil.  I have the same man page entry
you quoted, yet I came to the conclusion that the preceding
paragraph is correct when I read the RFCs.  Now you've got me
wondering again ...

It's rather normal :-) since a microsoft mouse is a two button mouse.
When your mouse is in microsoft mode, the middle button is disabled. the
"3ButtonMouse" option merely emulates the middle button on a microsoft
mouse when you press both buttons at the same time.

I use "mousesystems" rather than "microsoft". You should set you mouse
to it's native mode so that it's a 3 button mouse and the "3ButtonMouse"
option has no effect.

        I think most of us use Quick mouse 8)
With Savio's advice, one thing may be useful is that while use
mousesystem driver be sure switch your mouse to PC rather that MS.
Your mouse(so as mine) should have such switch(physical one).

I've used both the atixlmouse driver, the microsoft busmouse driver, and
a serial mouse.  They all seem not to report a button press until the
mouse is moved, which leads me to suspect something higher up than the
mouse driver.  The mouse test software in /usr/lib/X11/mouse ... 
does not seem to exhibit this problem.

Well I guess you're looking for US connections, but if you want all
connections (so it will be usefull to everyone on the net), in the UK
there's Demon Internet (all of us with .demon.co.uk :-) in our names).  The
charge is 11.75 UK pounds (about $17) per month with about the same as a one
time startup fee.  That gives you modem access (up to 16.8k I think, but I
always run at 14.4k), with full mail, news, ftp, etc.

The demon ftp site holds scripts for Linux mail, news, and SLIP connection.

Not much help, but here in the UK, Demon Internet Services offers SLIP
dialup for UKP 10 /month - about $17/month. There are no setup charges
and no connectr time charges - except the phone company itslef. They run
three dial in sites around the country - one in London, one in Warrington 
about halfway up the country, and one in Scotland. Each customer has
a permanently assigned IP address. Demon acts as an MX site and holds
mail for users. While connected, you are a full internet host - demon is
simply a router. They also take a full Usenet feed - about 300Mb/day and
hold news for 10 days. All in all a superb deal. In about 1 1/2 years of
operation they have gone from 150 users to about 2000 odd, plus commercial
links for businesses.

Dial-up SLIP access is getting more and more common.  It's available
quite inexpensively from a number of suppliers.  Check the PDIAL list
(posted in several newsgroups and available at rtfm.mit.edu) for a good
listing of Internet providers, including a number of SLIP/PPP providers. 

I know that in the Chicago area alone there are several suppliers.  My
UUCP host offers SLIP links for the same price as UUCP links.  That is,
approximately $1.00/hour, $15/month minimum!  Now *THAT'S*
entertainment!  There are other competing vendors, but I don't know much
about them. 

My host is MCSnet, run by Karl Denninger.  Write to info@genesis.mcs.com

In your summary of ways for individuals to get connected to the Internet, you might want to mention Ed Krol's book, The Whole Internet Resource Guide and Catalogue.  In the back is a list of access providers, broken down by geographic region, which tells how to contact them and what kinds of access they offer.

You might also want to mention the NIXPUB list, which also serves as a directory of service providers but is available online and so gets updated regularly (monthly, I think).

In addition to its standard access service ($25 monthly, $250 annual),

I'm not sure it you wanted non-USA internet connections but I connect my
linux machine through demon internet services who offer a SLIP connection
to internet for 10 pounds per month.

[IMHO, this is another excellent way to go]
  **** One can get many of the benefits of Internet through a UUCP connection.
This can be gotten for cheap or for free in many places.  A uucp connection gets
you email and News.

     A free uucp connection can be found by:

    1)  Getting the uucp maps for your area from comp.mail.maps. ( I know, chicken&egg here )
    2)  Looking through the maps for occurrences of the name of your home town, or other
          towns that are in your local calling area.
     3)  Calling up the nice sysadmins whose name and numbers are listed in the list entries.

Subject: NCR SCSI Controller
Date: 22 Oct 93 05:18:06 GMT

I have an ICL ErgoPRO D486/66dXG that has on the motherboard a NCR 53C94
SCSI controller. DOS (via BIOS) can use the controller fine, but Linux
does not know how to handle it.

Does anyone know where I can get
        a) either a driver for that chip
    or  b) technical specs so that I can try and write the driver myself
          (if that is not too hard to do)?

Any pointers are appreciated.
