I guess I would qualify on the low end of ES expert...  I wrote a C++
collection of classes that implemented a forward and backward chaining
expert system with an extensible rulebase.  I was very proud of it but
I wrote it as a contractor, and although the company didn't do
anything with it, I couldn't get clear rights to it.

If someone was willing to work on populating it, I'd be happy to
rewrite it and GNU it.  Although I thought about making it a product,
I don't want to be in that market yet, so I'd just as soon do that.

It was much easier to use than Clips BTW.

A perl version might be nice also.

I originally wrote it to analyze a log of distributed logs and then go
investigate problems and possibly correct them for a large network of
workstations.

I also have some expertise in natural language and boolean search
(read: exposure, some good books, and understanding).

I really get tired of responding to this misinformation.  I have routinely
been able to saturate the link into a Sun 4/490 (later turned into a
4/690Viking), regardless of the number of other users (serving as many as 40
or so terminal users, many compiling, plus 16 workstations in a lab
(dataless), plus about 5 other workstations in offices.  This is INTO ttyb,
standard Zilog parts and driver, with a v.32 modem.  Both ends of the link
are Suns, with the ports locked at 38K, and the termrc files at both ends
are set at 38K.  Hardware handshaking is enabled on both ends.  Saturated
here means compressed binary data at no less than 990 cps, usually about
1200 cps.  Text files would usually compress 2-3 times.  If Mr. Cutts is
using anything other than an SS1 or IPC and cannot achieve better results
than he reports, then something is misconfigured.  There is a hardware
design problem (no fifo) compounded by a somewhat inadequate driver, but the
performance is nowhere near as bad as he insists.  When I have criticized
systems or system components in the past I have always tarred with a brush
that was no larger than it needed to be.  Mr. Cutts should at least specify
every component of the failing system when he posts this opinion about Sun's
serial ports.

        I've installed both the SLS 1.03 and the Slackware 1.04 distributions
on my system (Sorry, haven't tried the MCC distribution.  I don't have easy
access to it,) and as far as I'm concerned, Slackware was the hands-down
winner.

        The SLS 1.03 installation was difficult and hard to follow.  The
install script didn't give the user good prompts, IMHO, and I also
had a problem with a couple of the .tgz files, as the installation script
claimed that gzip didn't understand the format.  This might not have been
a big deal, except for the fact that a few utilities didn't get installed
(nothing major.  Just stuff like mv and rm. :-( )  The boot disk which the
installation script created didn't boot, so I had to use the install
disk to get my system up and running.  This is *not* what I would call
"stable".

        Slackware 1.04, on the other hand, was much more friendly.  The
install script gave a reasonable explanation of what was going on, and,
on the whole, just seemed to be better thought out.  Everthing installed,
and the boot disk was created properly.  After booting the system, I was
able to get in and start doing things (like rm'ing files I didn't need :-)
right away.  This was one of the few Unixes I've installed that I felt
actually created a stable system right out of the box (I was able to do
the same thing with Microport SYSV, but only after I created my own
local installation procedure.)

        One of the few things I *didn't* like about Slackware was that
the installation didn't list the files as they were being uncompressed,
and where they were going (maybe it's just me, but I like to see this
type of info.)  Another possibility would be an installation log file
of sorts, were the various packages are listed with the files and
pathnames.  There could probably be a better description of how
the disk needs to be partitioned in fdisk as well.  However, most of
these are minor nits.

        I would suggest that *anyone* thinking of installing Linux
should get the Slackware distribution.  I'll give it **** 
(4 out of 5 stars :-)

sounds like a really complicated solution when a simple one is available:

why not just connect a terminal server or two with ethernet?  16 port and
32 port servers are readily available.

admittedly, good terminal servers aren't cheap, but if the guy can afford
30-50 modems, then he can afford to spend a bit extra to have something
that works with no fuss.

                 Announcing the Linux Disk Label Sale

I was going to print myself a set of Linux Disk Labels until I called
to order the labels.  Well, to sum it up, they are not cheap.  They
aren't expensive in comparison to other disk labels, but who needs
that many laser printer labels.  Some people might also lack laser
printing ability, so I decided to help out some other folks.  So, I
will keep this offer up as long as interest lasts.

Thanks to Chris D. Johnston <chris@surfcty.com>, The Community has
access to very nice labels for 3.5" Linux disks.  The labels that
these are printable on come in a quantity of 630 (more than alot of
folks want or need), so I will print and sell sets of these for a cost
of $6.50 per set (domestic shipping included).  I will continue this
as long as interest is not exhausted.

If you would like to purchase a set of these labels, please send mail
to the address below and I will send you order information.

I have been using the dbmalloc library from Conor P. Cahill on a Sun
quite successfully. I tried to build it on Linux and ran into all sorts
of problems. Has anyone successfully built this library or any other
debugging malloc one?

The problems were: In the Configure script, "ed" screwed up so the
generated malloc.h file had to be hand-fixed; Configure failed to find
the size "unsigned int" for WRTSIZE; then I hit this one:

From dbmalloc.h:

/* changed sbrk arg to int which it should be on all systems */
sbrk(int)

whereas in Linux's unistd..h

/* these are kind of Linux specific */
sbrk(ptrdiff_t __increment)

Here is when I bailed out. Has anyone worked through these to get a
working  debug malloc library, or should I ty to fix it myself? Thanks,

From: volkerdi@mhd1.moorhead.msus.edu (Patrick J. Volkerding)
Date: 12 Nov 93 21:20:30 -0600

A few people have reported problems compiling the kernel, and sure enough,
it seems 0.99pl13 does not compile under gcc 2.5.2.

To fix it, do one of these three things:

1. gcc 2.4.5 packages are still on ftp.cdrom.com, in /pub/linux/old.
   These will recompile the 0.99pl13 kernel source.
2. The alpha 0.99pl13q source compiles fine. This is why I hadn't noticed
   there was any incompatiblity between the kernel source and the new gcc.
   So if you install the Q series, no problems occur.
3. Fix the 0.99pl13 source. The compile seems to fail from differences in the
   way "volatile" is handled by gcc. If you want to take a stab at
   this, you'll have to at least change this line in sched.h:
        extern void panic(const char * fmt, ...)
   to:
        extern volatile void panic(const char * fmt, ...)
