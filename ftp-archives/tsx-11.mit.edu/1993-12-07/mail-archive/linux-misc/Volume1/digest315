>Excuse me?  Crack-4.2 already runs on Linux why go back to Crack-1.4?

nb1) This "marauder" chappie was talking avout Crack 4.1f and got this 
     wires crossed.

nb2) There is no such thing as Crack 4.2 *at* *all*. I should bloody well 
     know, I wrote the damned thing.

     - so beware of cheap imitations.

nb3) Crack v5.0 is alive and well and being developed on Linux, and
     broke its first password last saturday.

nb4) I agree that it seems a bit silly to bother putting Crack up as a 
     binary distribution, especially since Crack is one of those annoying
     programs which assumes that it exists within a development environment
     (ie: has a C compiler + make) - and it whinges when it can't find one.


- it's probably worth axing it off TSX. It'll be out of date soon, anyway.

        Hmm, your problem may be something else.  I've been able to
view the file on a NeXT cube and an Intel box running NeXTSTEP, in
monochrome and color -- no problems.  (NS 3.1 in all cases.)

  This is also the approach used by "poorman's Japanese TeX"  [ftp from 
blackbox.hacc.washington.edu]; poorman's does not do vertical formatting or 
other exciting things, but it also does not require a non-standard version of 
TeX.  Everything is done with macros and fonts.

Yes there is.  It's called wxwin and I saw it announced on
comp.os.ms-windows.announce some weeks ago.  I cannot remember exactly where it
was available from.  It is a set of C++ class libraries that allow the same
source code to be compiled under DOS with MS C or Borland C/C++ 3.0 for Windows
and under Unix for either Motif or XView using gcc.  I didn't try it, since its
functionality seemed somewhat limited, but it's free software and will do what
you want.

Noticed the line labelled "Organization" said Reuters London City West - in

post-code area. I couldn't traceroute to *.uki.reuters.com nor find it using

There are serial boards that allow you to use different addresses
for the COM ports.  However, I'm not sure if you can have 4 ports
in use, and still not use the 2e8 address, without going to
a real multiport serial card.  A configurable 2 serial port 
board about $10.  I would double check this is your problem, though,
as I have a hard time believe such a new modem has this problem.
I would try moving the terminal to COM4 and see if the modem works
on COM2.

I also seem to remember that a new service offered by the UKUUG Archive
at Imperial is the pressing of invidually customized CDROMs: you can
order a CDROM contaning any subset of the archives you want. I don't
know about procedures or prices, but it sure looks like an attractive
proposition. In particular getting a full CDROM with all of
/packages/Linux (if it fits in 600MB) updated to today seems nifty.

Help!  I can't dail into my linux box.  I have tried using uugetty, and

I am running Slackware 1.1.0 LInux 0.99pl13.  Can someone tell me

P.S. My modem is on COM2 (ttyS1).

You can use nfs mounting and Novells network mounting with FTP's

our tcpip kernel to run together. 

As far as a share-ware product to do this...?
