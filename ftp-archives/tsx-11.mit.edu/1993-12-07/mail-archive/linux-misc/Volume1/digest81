To elaborate, the nominal fee is <= $20.  The form that is required is
simple (~1 page).

There are two very good reasons to register:

(1) Statutory damages.  If you don't register, you are only going to be
able to recover actual damages.  For software that you give away, this
is going to be small.  U.S. copyright law allows people who register
to opt for damages specified in the copyright law, rather than actual
damages.  The range of statutory damages is something liek $500 to $10000,
with the actual amount up to the judge.

(2) Attorney fees.  If you register, when you sue and win the other side
has to pay your attorney fees.  If you don't register, you have to pay
your own attorney fees.

Ok, my turn.  On a true 486DX-33, the built in coprocessor is FOUR TIMES as
fast as a 386/387 combo running at the same speed.  Let's do a little math
here:
        33 MHz "487" = 129 MHz 387.

This should mean that the "487" should go 3.225 times FASTER than your Cyrix
386/387 running at 40 MHz.  But, according to the above results, your Cyrix 
is running the test in 84% of the time.  Which means that, for example, the
SIN operation on ST(0) is running at 241/(3.225/.84)= 63 clocks!!!  I can only
wish for a coprocessor like that... especially since the MINIMUM time for a 387
SIN operation running at 33 MHz is 122 clocks, with the *AVERAGE* somewhere 
around 400 clocks.

The question here is:  Was that 486-33 a DX or an SX?  I can see a 486-33SX 
w/ floating point emulation running that slow.  Getting a coprocessor would
*definitely* improve X performance and PostScript redering.  What we should do 
is write a program that uses a giant loop of floating point and test it; 
I've got a 486DX-33, so I could do one test; you could test your Cyrix 386/387
combo.

The summary said something about wasting bandwith, but failed to
specify whether it was Ian or keating who was doing that.  From the
tone of the posting quoted above, I can only assume he/she/it/they
meant Ian, so I guess it's the provocation I need to defend the daily
posting (again).

Some people claim that the daily posting wastes bandwidth.  At first,
it might seem that way, since it is, after all, several kilobytes and
is posted every day.  However, this calculation does not take into
account the fact that the daily actually reduces the number of
articles posted to the Linux groups because it makes known some more
or less generally accepted guidelines of good behaviour on the groups,
and points out some places where information can be found without
posting to the group.

You are free to not believe it has that effect.  There are, to my
knowledge, no hard facts that support it, but it has been my "gut
feeling" (if that's the expression I want [1]) that it does, or at
least used to.  For a while, since some time before the split of
comp.os.linux, I've noticed more and more inappropriate posts again.

Of course VLB will work faster!  The interface is clocked at 33Mhz
rather than 8.3Mhz, so assuming a fast IDE drive, data transfers can
be much faster!

Coming soon to patch near you..

I have the "IDE multiple commands" working on my system as of last night,
and the difference is awesome on benchmarks:  2Mbyte/sec data transfers
on WRITEs, versus roughly 1Mbyte/sec without multiple mode (Micropolis 2112A).
Curiously enough, the READs only seem to achieve about 1Mbyte/sec, probably
since the onboard cache in the IDE drive helps more for writes than for reads.
(with writes it can buffer the data and write it while linux prepares the next
request, making effective speed seem greater -- drive can do 5.6MB/sec -- but
for reads it has to wait for the data, and linux grabs it as fast as it arrives,
and the drive probably doesn't guess what to read-ahead next).

More importantly, kernel overhead is now roughly 40% (or less) rather than 90%
of the total time reported by time(1).  This makes sense in theory too, as most
disk transfers are for 1024byte blocks = 2 sectors.. using "multiple mode", only
half as many kernel interrupts are required.  For larger numbers of sectors,
the kernel overhead drops even more, as expected.

Still to do:  scatter/gather to combine multiple requests into fewer 
commands to the drive (using multiple mode).  I expect to post the (short)
patches to hd.c later this week, possibly including a simply scatter/gather
implementation.

I also would like to add DMA support for IDE drives, but the two IDE cards
that I have don't have the DMArq/ac signals connected to anything.. cannot 
barnacle them either, cuz they don't even have the ISA "fingers" for those
signals from the backplane.  Oh well.  'Guess I'll have to cobble something
together later once I get a copy of the IDE standard (ANSI X3.221).

Boot floppies are a very powerful tool, especially when they are as well-
implemented as they are under Linux (and fit so much good stuff onto one
floppy).  Many times, I wished I had such a thing for SPARCs (I do for
the Sun386i).  But some Suns don't even have floppy drives.

What's wrong with a bit of both?  It is not always practical or necessary
to use a boot floppy.  Furthermore, what do you do when you ACCIDENTALLY
hose your libc and cannot shut down properly?  A boot floppy is of no help
there.  That is why I believe "sync" and "update" gotta be statically linked,
if nothing else.  "mv" gives you a good chance of fixing the problem, too.
I certainly don't advocate doing "lots" of statically linked binaries, but
some are ESSENTIAL.

True on SPARC SunOS 4.x.  The Sun386i has "fsck" in /sbin, along with about
580 KB total stuff (presumably more than we'd want to be statically linked for
Linux): fsck init netconfig sh ifconfig mount reboot

Note that reboot is used instead of sync, and they also added ifconfig/netconfig
and mount.  "update" is statically linked too, but not in sbin.

Subject: Compressing file systems
Date: Wed, 1 Sep 1993 17:33:50 GMT

I am familiar with an SunOS package called Power Drive which invisibly
(de)compresses your files.  It operates somewhere around the file system
interface but does not show up as something you `mount' anywhere.

When a powerdrive-compressed file is accessed (for read) power drive
kicks in and decompresses the file.  So on the first block there's a pause,
then every other read happens at normal speed because the file is completely
uncompressed.  It stays uncompressed until recompressed.

At 3:00 in the morning (or whenever you tell cron to do so) you start
up powerdrive telling it to compress the files in your system.

You list in a file which files to *not* compress.  (Important things like
dump, restore, /vmunix, the programs ran in `rc' before the powerdrive driver
is loaded, etc).

All this solves, at least, the problem of random access into the file.

Something that is being missed here is that the third-party "387" vendors
generally have faster implmentations than the Intel'387 series.  They require
fewer external clocks to complete their calculations. This (and price) is their
prime raison d'etre.

So yes, perhaps this "487" is being run 3.225 times faster, but if it is 
only 1/3 as efficient internally, they might come out about the same.

The problem is, which utilities _are_ truly necessary?  

The answer depends heavily on the preferences of the user/sysadmin on
the machine.  E.g., I'm more than glad to save even a couple of
hundred kilobytes on my hard disk and risk having to reboot a system
without shutting down properly (syncing is done by /etc/update or
/etc/init every 30 seconds or so, so that is usually not a problem for
me).  Other may disagree.

Also, the answers depend on exactly what kinds of scenarios one can
think of; if I happen to log out of all shells before noticing the
problem, getty, login, the shell, and ln need to be statically linked.

I have the impression that the problem of missing shared library
images occurs mostly when updating the symlink (using rm/ln instead of
ln -sf), so for most people the truly necessary program to have is a
program to install a new shared library image, or, failing that, a
statically linked copy of ln.
