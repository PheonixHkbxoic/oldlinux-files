Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

And of course the /var/spool/lpd path *and* the printcap(5) man page
are included in the lpr package of slackware. Works fine with SLS installations,
since it is based on SLS.

Egads!  And I even checked for updates before reinstalling last night!

Oh well.  Here are some Obligatory Cleanups for slackware103:

        /etc/rc.local looks for /etc/syslog[dk],
        which are actually located in /usr/bin, so they never run.

        Also, some of the commented out examples in syslog.conf
        do not actually work when uncommented..

        There are still many duplicated man pages in /usr/man/cat1,
        mostly of the form:   xclock.1.z  xclock.1x.z

        There are several games manpages in /usr/man/cat1 that
        really belong in (and are formatted for) /usr/man/cat6

        Not all of the /usr/man/{cat[0-9],man[0-9]} dirs are created.

Subject: XFree ?????   and TAMU ?????
Date: Tue, 21 Sep 1993 18:00:00 GMT

After reading about Linux and XFree86, I was wondering,
when (if not allready) XFree86 2.0 is planned to come out.
I've seen one post that mentioned someone currently running XFree86
v2.0, but I thought it might have been a mis-type.

Another question I have is where, and how up to date is the TAMU
installation?  I have checked TSX-11 and SUNSITE, but I cannot
find a package more recent than March.  Does the current release have 
the .99pl12 or newer kernel?

Please send mail to me, or post responses.
Thanks in advance,

Subject: A Linux tee shirt would be nice
Date: Tue, 21 Sep 1993 18:59:06 GMT

I'm new to the linux family, so this may not be a new idea. But:

I was thinking that if someone was of an artistic (NOT autistic) nature
they might design a tee shirt for Linux users. If it could be put into
postscript it could easily be printed and then applied to a tee shirt
by any of the many tee shirt stores found at any tourist hangout.

This would be great for wearing to places like UniExpo, etc.

  Two basic questions:
  
  1. Give me a simple command to show the current
     version of Linux that I am using?

  2. Show me how to init a floppy in Linux?
     ( i.e. create a partition + formatting an ext2 FS)
     Have tried 'fdisk /dev/fd0' 
     Also tried 'mount /dev/fd0 ./floppy -type none'

  3. Do you know if we can allow theese 2 operations,
     ( fdisk + format ) to other users than 'root'?
     Although I do not want to allow someone doing
     a  catatrophic 'fdisk /dev/hda' !

   Thanks and Linux is wonderfull ...

Subject: Relocation of the NET Channel Flamewar
Date: 21 Sep 1993 12:04:05 GMT

        If you are not suscribed to the NET mailing channel, then you 
probably want to hit "n" now.

        However, if you are one of these people who just sit waiting for
a flamewar, then jump right in -- the temperature is rising!

Background: (described as impartially as possible)
==========
        
        In a recent post to the NET channel, Russ Nelson (nelson@crynwr.com)
questioned FvK's (NET-2 developer) input to the NET stuff in a rather blunt
fashion. This may be due to the fact that he was unaware that Fred is 
connected to the Internet by a piece of string and two soup cans.
        However, this resulted in an immediate flood of junk being sent
to the "developers channel" in defense of Fred, and also for the converse.
This is very annoying for the developers, and for those who just like to
sit in the background and follow the development.
        In an effort to move this drivel off the NET channel, it has been
(hopefully) redirected here. So if you want to get your $.02 in, go ahead,
follow up this thread.

Unlikely, as we mirror our SLS distribution from tsx-11, which is the
authoritative source for the distribution.

The Trans-Ameritech CDROM does just that - I linked in manpages, emacs lisp,
info files etc from their CD-ROM and saved a lot of disk space.
I agree that pictures are not terribly useful, but with 660 Meg who cares!

The problem is that Fred's work isn't meeting our needs.  This is our
problem, not Fred's.  For some reason, someone felt that Fred owns
this problem and told him that he was being flamed.  And *he* decided
that we thought he owned that problem, and tried to deny that it was
his problem.

It isn't.

I proposed that someone might want to do their own distribution of
Net-2 that *does* meet our needs.  I don't have the time to
contribute any more to Linux than I am already doing.  I have to
limit my contribution to Linux to writing GPL'ed MS-DOS packet drivers.

   This may be due to the fact that he was unaware that Fred is

Probably not -- I offered to help pay for his Internet connection.

This is not correct. Commonly-used RSA systems use key sizes significantly 
larger than 425 bits. Common RSA key sizes range from 512 bits to 1024. 
Factoring RSA-129 does not in any way jeopardize the security of widely
