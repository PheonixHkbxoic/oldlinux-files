        I've had the same problem on a 25 Mhz 386dx with an IDE card
and two daisy chained drives (as well as with a different card and
only one drive).  I posted last week or so and recieved one suggestion
that it might be my bus speed or my memory.  But kicking the turbo
down to 8 Mhz, I was able to move files without corruption, but I'm
not particularly running at 8 Mhz ;>.
        One friend suggested I poke around my BIOS setup and see if
there's an adjustable bus param there that might take some tuning.  If
that doesn't work I'll probably swap memory chips around.  I'm sorry I
can't help more, but I must say its nice to see I'm not imagining it!

Whee.

Well, I've been at it for a week or two now, and I have a few
observations for the Linuxing public to chaw on.

1. Response to the original proposal:

About 90% of mail I received was strongly in favor. Of the other 10%,
the most common sentiment was that the task was impossible but
my message was not objectionable, or that net.copping in general
is distasteful but my message was nonetheless reasonable.

2. Response of those receiving the message (to which I usually add a note):

I haven't been recording it all, but I would say that about 50%
do not reply, though I rarely see them mispost again. Of the
remainder, about 75% (to my astonishment) thanked me for the
assistance. The remaining 25% were pissed off.

Of the last group, to all of whom I have responded personally,
most replied to apologize or acknowledge the mailing was correct
in their case. There were also a couple of cases in which I
basically missed, and apologized for doing so.

3. "Oh there's so much irrelevant garbage in .linux.* it's so terrible":

Well, folks, in actual practice, it seems that around 5-10% of
comp.os.linux.help is X questions, which I redirect, and there's
a certain amount of easy-FAQ-asking. And in comp.os.linux.development,
I send something like 5% of posts a note explaining the group's purpose.

But, by and large, *even in comp.os.linux.help*,  most messages
represent genuine questions, confusions and bug reports that fall between the
cracks of the FAQ. And I don't see a whole lot of high- powered
answers being handed out. 

Yes, there's some noise, but it's far from a majority. 

Now, my standards are probably a bit lax, since I'm easing into this
and trying to avoid sending too many incorrect messages. But
it's still not as bad as I keep hearing from the Defenders of the 
Linux Faith. (:

4. Conclusions

The project seems to be helping the people I'm coming in contact with
through it, and hopefully cuts down on the number of second- time
misposts considerably. (Nothing will cut down on first- time
misposts until newsreaders are smart enough to put
news.newusers.questions first in the newsgroup list and
present FAQs first on first-time entry to a group, reliably.)

But quite frankly, the volume of comp.os.linux.help is not due
primarily to misposts. It is due primarily to the fact that
installing an under- documented, still- beta (and absolutely
wonderful) operating system like Linux (or, more accurately,
like the available distributions of Linux) is, well, a bitch.
Especially if you haven't administrated 'nix before.

If anything, part of the volume problem is that many questions
are asked repeatedly, never answered, and never put into the FAQ.
In other words, experienced users are a big part of the problem.

If you're a skilled Linux user, it might be time to hold
your breath and start reading comp.os.linux.help again, because
nothing would improve the group like seeing *answers*
posted to it. And nothing would improve the comp.os.linux.development
crossposting problem more.

Subject: Actix GE32 + USR modem on COM4 doesn't work??
Date: 17 Nov 1993 22:19:27 -0800


Hello all,

I just bought a new Actix GE 32 video card.  I works great.
But I have one problem.  I have a USR Sportster 14.4k modem
and I am unable to connect to it when the Actix is in
graphics mode.  The USR is on COM4 IRQ5.   I read
in the Actix manual that some cards are modeled after
XT (as opposed to AT)style bus thus responding 
to address [n]2E8 where n is > 0, even thought they shoudl
only respond to 02E8.  Actix uses [A-E]2E8 for I/O ports.  
It also says that COM4 is on 02E8.

Now, my question is: Is USR Sportster really that dumb.
(My USR Sportster version is 4.1).  If not, what can
I do to correct this problem?

Oh, and I can not move it to COM1 or COM3 since COM1 is
used by Mouse.  COM2 with usual IRQ has a dumb terminal attached
to it so I can not move to COM2 either. ( I hate the COM
port architecture in IBM PC :-()


Some more details:
Noname ISA motherboard with AMD 386/40Mhz processor
8 MB memory.
AMI BIOS.
Actix GE32 video card 1MB.
USR Sportster 14.4modem 4.1 in COM4 IRQ 5
Mouse on COM1
Running Linux PL13 + XFree86 2.0
 or DR DOS 6.0 + Windows 3.1

Thanks in advance for any help  you can offer.

I currently owe motif for Linux (bought through MetroLink). As far as the
royalities are concerned, this, to the best of my knowledge (trying to
remember what the software license agreement said), only applies to
binaries that are dynamically link (i.e. you cant redistribute the
shared motif libraries without paying a royalty). This does not
apply to statically link binaries. This, again, is from conversations
with Maheesh at MetroLink (a product I highly recommend). Maheesh, comments?
Maybe, this changes in version 1.2. Which, if it is the case that the
royalities apply to statically linked versions, then just buy version 1.1.

I had this problem since many patch-levels: after some time memory is
filled. It was stopping my 386SX/25, 6 MB RAM, 6 MB swap machine after
8-10 days when I wasn't using it much or 3.5 days when it was loaded
about 1.00 all the time. It is fifth day when I'm running Crack all the
time, now simultaneously with X (big leakage source before) and tin.
The system nicely kills the jobs overflowing memory and these jobs work
again after adding some swap manually.

Good! Thank you Linux Gods!

This is only something that's started happening recently on my

I just press the ALT key, and it hangs and churns out a message 
which contains:

task[0] (swapper) killed: unable to recover
Kernel panic: Trying to free up swapper memory space
In swapper task - not syncing

at which point it completely hangs.
What does it mean? and how can I stop it from happening?

Touche'...a Trident 8900cl card "works" but if you have to wait for
an ls output, then you need a faster card.  I'm running an Orchid
Fahrenheit 1280 ISA card, with like a 2000 line scroll back buffer,
and YIKES! is it quick with the new S3 server that is shipped with
the XFree86 2.0 release.  Get an accelerated card for sure...a
S3 card seems to cruise along.  The Actix, STB PowerGraph, and
the Orchid can all be found under $200.  Well worth the investment,
IMHO, of course.

I have to doubt that I am the first one to do this, but it's come in
handy for me a number of times.  Problem.  At various times of the
day, I will have the monitor off or a screen saver on.  I don't
want to have to run over and open up a mailer every time I hear
that little beep that notifies me of incoming mail.  So I picked
up the speak package in the apps/sound directory on sunsite, set
up a filter-rules file in my .elm directory, and used a short
shell script to feed the from field into the cheesy speech 
program.  Of course, for the most common people, it's very easy to
have filter play a sampled audio file so it's clearer.
I don't think this merits a package, as I wrote this quickly in
a half-hour or so.  Just thought this idea might interest some of you
