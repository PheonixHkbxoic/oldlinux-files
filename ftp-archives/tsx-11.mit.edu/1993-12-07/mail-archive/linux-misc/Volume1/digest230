Usually that solves most of the problems, but GNU's configure screwed
me over one time.  (What is getcap, anyway?  It's not in the ncurses
headers & configure took it from the curses ones.)

Alright, so I can't really complain... but I like convenience, and

Hi.  I don't know a whole lot about Linux at all, or X for it.  However,
I'd be interested in finding out what it has to offer.  Right now I am
running OS/2 2.1, and I'm pretty happy with it, but I'm also the sadistic
type of person who actually likes switching operating systems semi-daily. 
What added functionality does Linux and/or Linux+someXplatform offer over
a system like OS/2?  Any?  Is it just different?  What are the differences
in basic approach to computing?

I'm running the following system : 
        386DX40Mhz
        8 Meg RAM
        237 Meg (one 105M C:, one 132M d:)
        Both floppies
        All the regular ports, etc.
        Roland MPU-IPC-T MIDI interface
        Niscan/GS 256-greyscale scanner (may be selling)
        ATI VGA Wonder w/512k
        TTX Multisync Monitor
        may be buying ATI Stereo audio card + Mitsumi CD-ROM

Will my system run Linux?  How well?  Will I have a lot of trouble finding
support / apps for my system?  Oh yeah, and also I have a PC Logic 14.4kps
v32b/v42b MNP1-5 faxmodem.  What about support and apps for the quirky
hardware setup?  (It's quirkier than it looks -- trust me.

I don't want to sound like I'm defending Diamond, but not all of
their cards are completely useless under the standard XFree86 server.
My SpeedStar Pro VLB is Cirrus-based and works perfectly with the
drivers in SVGAlib and XFree86 (except 1024x768, which I can't test
thanks to a fixed-frequency monitor).

I know the Diamond FAQ mentions that the Pro is Cirrus-based, but it
still seems to be lumped in with the rest of the 'evil' cards since it
doesn't explicitly state anywhere that the Pro will work.

I have bought SLC-2/50 here at work ( I did not test Linux on them ) and they
are quite nice. I would say they are about the same as 486DX-33 if
you do not use math copro. So I would suggest 40 MHz AMD if the price
is not a problem. 

And yes the SLC is 16-bit as it replaces 386SX. I think it is quite nice
as you can add two SIMMs at a time. By the way the IBM's SLC-2 runs at
3 volts, and the power regulator is quite hot, so check the design so
that the regulator has some space around it. Also I think the cover
of the PC should be on.

Yes and No.

IBM's blue lightning, is a 486 with the clock triped @ 99Mhz.
Intel is suppoesed to release a clock tripled @ 100Mhz.  Same
difference ?????

Basically, (I guess) they're the exact same thing, or so close that it
really doesn't make a difference.  IBM did beat Intel to market
though.

The 586 is a different beast.  IMHO, it is (for the time being) a
better idea to stick with the 486 technology.  See where the 586
(pentenium) goes, before worrying about it.  Though, there is supposed
to be significant gaine in the built-in fpu.  It's supposed to execute
FP instructions in a single clock cycle, which outperforms the 486
built-in

The Clock tripled is supposed to be the go-between the 486 (curent)
and the Pentenium.

As I see it, there is no such thing as a three button MS mouse. MS mice have 
by definition only two buttons. If yours has a third button, there should be 
a way to switch it into PC Systems Mouse mode, or something like that. It 
seems to be usually done by pressing a button at boot time - check your mouse 
documentation and change the entry in Xconfig.

Yea, that was the beginning of the end of SLS. While people are
willing to put up with the faults of something they like, they're
intolerant of things they disfavor, and Peter's last few moves
certainly steered people away from SLS. I was flamed back then when I
pointed out those moves were against both the spirit and letter of the
GPL, but that's all academic now, I guess. Too bad SLS will be
remembered only for its bad moments, it certainly had a lot of good
when it started.

Subject: OS-BS v2.0 Beta8 released (Yet another boot loader)
Date: Thu, 21 Oct 1993 01:00:48 GMT


Hi,
I've uploaded os-bs v2.0 Beta8 to ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de under
/pub/pc/os-bs. It's called osbsBETA.exe and a self-extracting
archive running under DOS, like the previous versions. (DOS is
only needed for running the installation program, i.e. a bootable
DOS floppy is enough).

What's new?
It is completly rewritten. Os-bs is now able to boot from logical
partitions in extended partitions and from every disk which is
accessible via the BIOS during booting (i.e. if you have e.g. a AHA1542C
and e.g. three disks it should be possible to boot also from the third
disk = drive 0x82).
But in the moment only Linux/LILO is known to boot with os-bs 2.0 from
other partitions then a primary. If you have Linux in a logical par-
tition you can install the LILO loader also in the boot sector of this
partition rather in the extended partition's sector since os-bs 2.0 can
load LILO from this location now.

For DOS and OS/2 I'll probably add workarounds for booting from second
(maybe other) disks in one of the next Beta's.

Os-bs has now a nicer (colored window) boot menu similar the OS/2 boot
manager and you can stop also the timer. Also the installation program
is much more comfortable ("ASCII Windows" desktop) and you can edit also
system IDs in the partition table with it now (this is sometimes necessary).

In the moment os-bs needs except the Master Boot Record the space of four
(will probably grow) additional sectors. For this it uses the almost always
unused sectors 2, 3, 4, 5 on cylinder 0, head 0, disk 0 for which it computes
a simple 'xor' checksum. But this place will be selectable in the future.

This Beta is not complete yet, and has still some restrictions, so please
read README.1ST first.

Thomas
==========================================================================
   OS Boot Select is a replacement of the ordinary master boot
   program. It provides a customizable boot menu with a timeout
   and the abiltity to automatically set the active partition
   before booting. This avoids boot problems with some UNIX
   systems. Unlike the OS/2 2.x boot manager's it only requires
   the 512 byte of the master boot sector (sector 0) and some
   additional sectors which can be anywhere on the disk (see below!)
   but no seperate 1MB partition.
   OS Boot Select comes with a installation program running
   under DOS.

in microsoft mode, i think you need to put the line 
  Emulate3Buttons
in your Xconfig (if you wish to copy in Xwindows)
then you can use the left and right buttoms *simultaneously* to simulate a
middle button ! not ideal, but hey ... what do you expect from microsoft?

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.

   Hi !!

   Is a SCSI-CD-ROM needed for the Nascent-Linux-Distribution ??

   What about Philips CM 205 ??

The Sony CDU-31A and Mitsumi cdroms as well as SCSI cdrom drives are
supported.  Unless the Philips drive is SCSI, it is most likely not
currently supported by Linux.
