Hi all there,

Does anybody know of a CIS B+ protocol implementation for Linux/unix ?
It should be a seperate program (external protocol) in a similar fashion as
rz/sz so that I could implement it into seyon.

thanx in advance

It is the operating system that the Free Software Foundation

This is one of those "but they mean well questions"

I have a 486dx266 pc with the following:

        16 meg RAM
        EISA (5 mastering, 3 not) and 2 VESA slots
        on the motherboard Fast SCSI-2 (Adaptec 7770 chipset) (Uses ASPI7DOS)
                (Also wide if the manufacturer ever figures it out.
                 Anyway two channels are available)
        1 gig Quantum SCSI Hard Drive
        Toshiba 3401 SCSI Internal
        Conner 525MB SCSI Tape backup - Channel 0 required

I (need/want/lust/choose one) more hard drive space for the following reason(s):
1. Linux doesn't support this particular Adaptec chip set (only temp I hope).
2. Need more space.
3. Currently the machine is MBR DOS/OS2, and I want to add at least linux, 
   if not also NeXTStep4Intel, Chicago, Solaris for Intel, etc.  Eventually.

I am looking at a some of options, for the reason ennumerated.

1.)  Add an IDE drive, cause I know it will be supported by Linux.
        (Course, all the stuff on the SCSI drive won't be accessisble)
        (And I get the idea the IDE would have to hold the Master Boot record)

2.)  Add two IDE drives.  That way, I could maximize the responsiveness
     of the computer by putting the swap partition on the second IDE drive.
        (I've heard that putting the swap partition on a different physical
         device theoretically increases system response by reducing 
         head movement when swapping is required.  Does this REALLY happen?
         Not, is it economical, but is a performance increase reailzed?)
        (Could also put swap partitions for other operating systems on IDE
         drives for same reason(s).)

3.)  Add another SCSI adapter card (EISA or VESA ?)  Then get a second SCSI
     and load Linux on it.  Or transfer the first SCSI to the Added controller.
        (SCSI Controller adapter conflicts ?)
        (Choose this because the IDE would add load to the CPU, which 
         may not be a big deal, but then again, I am looking for the 
         best choice.  Stay on the SCSI bus regardless? Is there an advantage?)

Other options ?

Admittedly, I being no guru, have heard the old wives tales without 
being able to separate the wheat from the chaff (mixed metaphor). If 
there are some guru's rules (GURU'S RULE!) to guide the mixing of 
storage devices in a multi-OS system, I'd appreciate a pointer or help.

This is not an attempt to build the ultimate system, but my experience
has been that choosing rightly up front and paying a little extra for
the tweaks is very helpful in the long run.

Thanks for getting this far.  Posting to the newsgroup is okay by me.

Seemingly you haven't learnt anything about fascism except that it's bad.

If somebody strongly advises you not to go into a theatre, up to the

Sigh. Read c.o.l.* lately ? There is something necessary, but what ?
Will it work as supposed to (here: scaring the arrogants and/or idiots
AND ONLY them) ? The best thing would be to automatically cancel
inappropriate postings to keep personal issues out of it. However,
the problem is how to automatically decide what is inappropriate,
and as that seems to be a superset of decidability in Goedel's sense
it is insolvable. Sigh.

So (to boutell@netcom.com) it's alright with me if you do what you
proposed to do. But do not expect to be able to keep doing it for
long because it's bound to have detrimental side effects on your
psyche.

I think that the 13mb/sec they are talking about is the transfer rate of
the controller, not the read rate of the drive itself. For instance, the
specs on my Toshiba 3401b say that it can transfer up to 4.2MBytes/sec
over the SCSI bus in burst mode, but the sustainable transfer rate is
limitted to 330 Kbytes/sec, which is the read ability of the drive.

Guten Tag!

Is there any font for X which resembles the font used in text mode in MS-DOS?

The idea behind this on first glance somewhat barbarian question is the
following: I'm using Seyon, a terminal programm for Linux, which uses xterm
as terminal emulation. When I call a BBS running on a MS-DOS machine lots
of it's output gets unreadable due to different graphic characters.

Any information will be appreciated. Thank you for your help!

  I got 93737 on our 10/30 GX, so that's about right.  What really suprised
me was the 10/51 turboGXplus getting 93242 xstones!  It's line drawing was
far superior to anything else I tested, and it's filled rectangle rate was
10 times that of a 10/41 GX, but it's tiled rectangle rate is very slow.
3 times slower than a 10/30 GX!  This brings the xtones rating down a lot.
My ATI XLR, even with XFree86-1.3, gets much higher arc rates (though
filled arcs are about the same) than any of the Sun graphics cards.  It
looks like the tGX+ didn't accelerate arcs.

  What I don't like about raw xstones:

    Sun 10/51 turboGXplus versus 486/66V, ATI XLR XFree86 2.0, times faster:

line   1.9
fill   0.4  (don't forget, 400x400 filled rectangles are 13.8 times faster!)
blt    2.8
text   1.6
arc    0.4
cmplx  2.5

  If we used an arithmetic average, the tGX+ would be 1.6 times _faster_
than the ATI.  Does xstones show this?  No.  It says the ATI is 1.1 times
faster than the tGX+.  I doubt anyone sitting in front of the two would see
it this way unless they were drawing arcs or doing tiled rectangles.
Everything else is faster on the tGX+!  For many of the operations, the size
10 numbers are pretty close, but the ATI drops off as the operation gets
larger, while the tGX+ keeps up.  For instance:

Wide Lines:        10       100        400
ATI XLR         17433.6    4957.1     1536.0
turboGXplus     21734.4   21196.8    16051.2

Screen Copy:       10       100        400
ATI XLR          6630.0    2256.0      192.6
turboGXplus      6271.2    6117.6      558.0

These numbers are for OpenWindows 3.0, which is X11R4, includes the NeWS
server, and also SunView support.  Sun claims a 60% improvemwnt in OW 3.3
which is X11R5 based, and drops SunView and NeWS.  There have been rabid
anti-OpenWindows posters who've claimed much more than this in the past,
so it wouldn't surprise me.  Maybe that will even out some of the results.
Still, it does show that single-figure xstones miss most of the picture.

  In the future, could we at least get the "summary" information, including
figures for all 6 areas?


  (Oh, BTW, I really like my ATI card and computer -- the 10/51 tGX+ costs
over $20,000 with $3,000 or more being the graphics card -- my whole
computer cost me $4,000 with maybe $300 being the graphics card.  Still,
for Arc/Info or GRASS, the 10/51 tGX+ really screams.  Love that 20" TCO
compliant monitor with remote control too!)

Personal finances permitting & good price for the hardware I'd be

Please note that my interest would be contingent on the Linux port
