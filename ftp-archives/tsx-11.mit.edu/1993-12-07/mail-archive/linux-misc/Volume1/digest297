Indeed 'crond' is the culprit here, and slackware enables it by default.  I
tracked this down after the linux laptop that I use didn't spin down the disk
after I programmed the 'IdleTimer' value to 35 seconds.

Another problem I had was the backlight not timing out.  This was solved by
running 'selection', which slackware doesn't do as packaged.   I previously
had the problem that programming the WD7600 laptop chipset to timeout the
backlight didn't work, and I had to hack display.c to shut it off with the
screenblanker(*).  I found out that something had to be _enabled_ on IRQ4, even
if you didn't have a mouse, since the circuit that checked for (presumably)
mouse activity was level rather than edge sensitive.  When nothing was enabled
on IRQ4, the interrupt line floated high and it looked as if the device was
constantly active.

(*) If you try this at home kiddies, watch out: the X server switches screens
with screen_blank().  You'll have add a new screen_timeout_blank(), which is
different from screen_switch_blank().

BTW, I'm currently working on figuring out how to use the complete laptop
suspend mode on the wd7600.  But the wd7600 chipset will probably be
obsolete by the time I figure it all out...

There are some machines, like the Z-Note, that handle suspend mode
transparently.  This means no extra hacking, but has the disadvantage that the
clock(!) is suspended also.  If you a laptop chipset that does suspend "by
hand", you have the opportunity to "do the Right Thing", at the expense of a
lot of work.

Hotline, Fax or Email, provided the user (company) is porting software
(also commercial packages) to linux and is located in the European

Their organization wants to develop and distribute ``free'' software

operating system that can interest not only the hackers but also
commercial developers.

Their version is based on 99.pl13 and will be upgraded twice a year.
They will not include ALPHA packages. They claim to have linux
debugged fully and have made changes so that id diverts from the
``offcial'' patch facility.

I evaluate this as another distribution targeting the German speaking

                yeah, I know, kinda small, but they were old.) and two
                1.2 GB scsi drives in the same system.  I was using one
                IDE for boot/root/swap and the other for swap while keeping
                the more active DATA files (usr/home/spool) over on the
                scsi devices.  If anything, I must say that I've lost some
                performance with the scsi-only setup and the reason appears

                One point to consider, while having sufficient and high

                a system-performance perspective should be to never have
                to swap!  Any time we have to go to disk we are slowing
                down by at least one order of magnitude!  You might want
                to weigh the cost/benefit of more real memory and slower
                swap devices. An additional 16 MB might actually be cheaper
                and insure that swapping almost never occurs.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.

Normally I would agree with you. Someone posted some numbers on a terminal
server with 48 lines. Came to about $4500. That's not a bit extra. That's
a 63% increase over the costs of the modems (assuming $150 14.4K modems
that are readily available.)

I'm fortunate to have the knowhow to replace that $4500 cost with some
design knowledge. It's my wish list, not a suggestion for someone with
$12000 to spend.

Winter is coming and the power here around goes out whenever one

some rs232 signals about the state of affairs. What I need now
is a daemon that watches a serial port for the 'battery low'

Strange thing: I have such a daemon: pwerd. I don't know with

Did you check the output of the X server? Were there any messages you didn't
get with the old server? Are you using the same timings as before? I suspect
your timing is corrupt. Have a look at the ModeDB part of your Xconfig.

Try look into sipb.mit.edu:/pub/seyon/MISC. There is a font that
includes IBM graphics characters and an ANSI compatible xterm (color xterm is
not 100% compatible with ANSI emulation, causing messy screen) also.
You can also grab your BIOS's fonts and convert it into an X font using
evafont.exe (a DOS based font editor) in the following package:

sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/utils/nls/LinuXinterDOS.tar.z


        Hope this helps.
