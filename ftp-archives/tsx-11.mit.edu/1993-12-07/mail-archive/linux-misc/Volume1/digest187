One other data point:  It seems that the random crashes happen more

        What the first author is suggesting would actually have no
portability impact on XFree86.  He is asking for a utility that
runs during boot that sucks out the video timing values from the
bios.  That information could easily be written to in an Xconfig
format file.  That file can then be used by an XFree86 server with
absolutely no modifications to the server source.
        I agree that this sort of program would be a very good thing.
I ask that anyone who writes such a routine make a version that
runs under native dos as well as during the linux boot sequence.
That way anyone who wants to automagically determine their video
mode information, but doesn't necessarily have linux, can do it.
After all, the program would only need to be run once unless a new
card is installed.

Obcourse this misses the point that you are free to patch your own driver
into Xfree86.  If you want to write your own BIOS driver for Linux, great.
Test it out, if it improves performance, increases speed, or has some
other advantage upload it to an ftp and all the Linux community will
appreciate it.

I've the same error coming up on my system. Conf. is:
Adaptec 1542B 3.2 ROM Normal Settings (No Parity, like every other device)
Internal:
Maxtor LXT-213 S ROM 4.18 id 1
Conner CP-30200 Rev. 4343 id 2
Tandberg TDC 3660 ROM Archive Viper Emulation 21247 Rev. B07: id 4
Seagate ST-296 Rev. ?     id 0 Terminated

External:
Apple CD-300 (Sony 561)   id 3 Terminated

When I try to use the SCSI bus with tar cvf /dev/nst0 /pub/cdrom
i will get the same error within a short time. If I am trying to
backup my disks I will see this error sometimes (about 90%).

If I am going to read the CD-ROM or tape, I will see this error  too,
but only if the system tries to access the disks. It seems it is not
stable when more than one different devices (tape, cdrom or disk) are
in use.

I've seen this error since 0.99 pl 2 (in words: two!). Now I am running
pl 13. The scsi-patches for pl 13 on nic.funet.fi are not useful to get
rid of this "bug?".

It does not help if I disconnect one of the devices. This happens with
the CD-ROM *XOR* tape installed, no matter where I install it.

Maybe it's got to do something with "slow" devices?

If I am using a VERY LARGE buffer (tar cvbf 3000 /dev/nst0 .) I'll see this
error very late, sometimes...

So, is there someone out there fixing this bug???

Yes, it depends on what you like.  I happen to prefer the "viewport on a HUGE
root window" that olvwm (and, for that matter, tvtwm) uses.  But You can make
olvwm behave more like a "room" paradigm by changing a resource

ctwm probably has much simpler decorations, if it's like the other members of

I don't think they'll *ever* be "perfected".  Usable, yes, but remember that
this is largely a hacker system:  there'll *always* be one more neat feature
to add :-)

This scheme doesn't have to have anything to do with the X Free 86 code.
All it needs to do is write a locally correct XConfig file.

Whether I'd trust the information or not is a different matter. How
would it get the monitor bandwidth for example.

        Is this a dead end ?

Ok, ChatMUD 1.0 is available via FTP from suncad.camosun.bc.ca in the
/pub/morley directory.  The file is: chat.c.z

This is a single C file that you must compile like this: cc -o chat -O chat.c

Once compiled, run it like this: chat &

Now people just have to telnet to your machine on port 7000 (you could
have specified an alternate port on the command line: chat 1234 &)

You do NOT need to be root to run this and have people use it.

This is my first attempt at writing any kind of server code, so be gentle. :-)

Have fun!

I think it's a great idea -- I'm a (pretty new) Linux user, and I
happen to own a (pretty new) publishing house. Maybe we can work out
some sort of division of labor. We can't really afford a lot of
unremunerated overhead, but the mag probably doesn't have to be glossy
and probably doesn't have to be expensive. Typesetting/DTP could be
done by whomever, copy-editing likewise. It would be probably be
useful to set up printing and shipping in three places: one for North
America, one for Europe and one for East Asia, Australia & NZ.

The financial model I like best would distribute the profit to
whomever does the work -- authors, typesetters, copy-editors and
fulfillers.

Does somebody know if it's okay to continue this discussion in this
newsgroup, or would direct e-mail be more in order?

What about support for MakeTeXPK..? Has it been done? Is it possible?

I have got eps02 running on Linux and it works extremely well with my EPSON LX-800
(well, that's all relative though... :-) but if a font doesn't exist it doesn't create
it like e.g. xdvi does. My current workaround is to run eps first and log which fonts
it can't find, create these fonts and then run it again in the printer spooler...

This is what OS/2 actually seems to do.  Is has you run a command called
"svga on" in a dos window, where it traps the writes to ports and keeps
track of what it did to go in and out of all of the vesa modes.  It then
uses this information to set its svga modes itself.

Of course I may be totally wrong (I just figured this out by playing
with it), but it seems to be what it is doing.

This would allow someone to write a driver that would read similar files
and output the same commands to the same ports to change video modes. 
Might even be a way to pick up ideas on new cards.

Yeah, that's what some other programs do too, like ColorView by
Millenium Technologies (shareware viewer for DOS.)  It

run it (it doesn't use a config file though), and finds 
all my resolution x color combinations all the way
