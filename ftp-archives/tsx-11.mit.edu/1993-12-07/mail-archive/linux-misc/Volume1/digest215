LGX isn't updated very often.  It can't be, as a practical matter:  CDROMs
aren't read/write, so if you update monthly you end up with either (a) a *lot*
of outdated, non-reusable CDROMs (now there's an idea:  CDROM recycling :-) or
(b) a lot of expensive, inefficient small runs and potentially a lot of
customers who "miss out" because the runs are sometimes too small to meet the
demand.

"getting"????  I thought 1.02 was a mess until I tried 1.03...

What if we don't have one - what would the price be then?

It looks like there will be at least two efforts at a Linux "magazine".
Our effort, which has been underway for about six months is clearly
going to be on paper. Electronic efforts are also underway.

When we were first talking about Linux Journal one of the questions
was how we would distribute it: paper, on the Internet, disks, ...
The primary reason we picked paper is that there needs to be something
to do the "outreach" work for Linux.  By that I mean:
  * something to show to people unfamiliar with Linux
  * vendors and others in the computer industry

Linux already has one of the best support networks of any software
I have worked with.  I contrast the "post to c.o.l.h" approach to
support with the "phone call, wait, person who doesn't know anything,
wait, schedule a callback, wait, ..." approach of commercial vendors.
But what is missing is the way to show someone what Linux is about
without having to tell the story from the beginning every time.

A paper magazine can solve that problem.  It can offer background
along with the current developments in a form that is easily delivered
to those less well connected than those of us on the Internet.

A paper journal, done well, also adds credibility to the who Linux
project.  I see it as something that will help "sell" vendors on the
idea there Linux is real and supporting it is in their best interest.
And _their_ best interest can be _our_ best interest.

For example, it would be great if some PC vendors knew what Linux was
and could offer people systems configured to run Linux.  This could
increase the size of the community while decreasing the "should I buy ..."
traffic in these newsgroups.

Add to this intelligent communications boards, books on Linux, T-shirts,
etc and you are well on your way to building an alternative to commercial
Unix packages.  Without this exposure I am afraid Linux won't get
taken seriously in many circles.

Enough of me being an evangalist.  Someday paper won't be necessary.
But I don't feel we are there today.
