I am sorry, if I was too fast with the "it's not possible" but I think the
Author of the Question ment how to access the LINUX Filesystem from a bootet
DOS-System without copying the needed files to the DOS-System before. If
you have any programs, that can do, please let me know.

Just to add one info, though it might be somewhere in the FAQs. I
guess the second best way after writing a C program would be to use a
perl-script, which is often easier for things you first wanted to do
with a shell script, and have it executed by suid-perl. Sources in the
gnu-archive, have to tel it to compile with suid-option (leaves you
with a normal and a suid-perl).

  Try reading the newsgroup, instead of blindly posting!  I am defintely
one to encourage questions, as I can remember my newbie days...
But when the answer has been posted at least 5 times, and people neglect 
to actually read the newsgroup, and instead just post, that gets really annoying.

  Please note that I have no spite towards you, Glen.  This was just getting
out of hand...

  The answer to the "Term 1.0.7 just mysteriously stopped working" is that
you should update to Term 1.0.8

I really don't like the finger that comes with Linux or Net-2, so I downloaded

I just noticed that dvilj2p (which I got with the SLS 1.03 TeX package)
does not print $-$. All I get is a blank. Close perusal of some testfont
printouts revealed this problem: dvilj2p seems to print char32 instead
of char0 regardless of the font in use. Since I have not tampered with

Well, as of this morning I had no idea what the LSM was.  Now that I know
what it is, I'm not so sure that I want to know :-)  I think it's a very
good idea, but a lot of the LSM entries are now out of date.  The reason
I discovered this is that I now have a Hypertext link to the LSM from my
Linux WWW server.  I simply made ftp links to the Site?: entries from the
LSM database entries.  I went through and was randomly trying entries, and
much to my dismay the first 10 I tried didn't work due to the Site:
references being out of date.  I did enevtually find some that worked,
but the majority that I tried did not work.

  I guess what I'm actually trying to say is, if you have an lsm entry,
please check it and make sure that it is up to date.  You're bloody insane
if you think I'm going to go through and check over 1100 entries to check
for their correctness :-)

Subject: Missing socket features? linger and SOMAXCONN
Date: Fri, 29 Oct 1993 16:44:41 GMT

I originally posted this message to comp.os.linux.help, and got no response,
so I'm desperately reposting to c.o.l.misc.

I'm trying to port a library to Linux, so I can run a corporate
scheduling program; the library uses sockets a great deal, and was
originally written to run under HP-UX and AIX.  At one point in the
code, there is a definition requiring a structure called linger,
defined as:
        struct linger {int l_onoff, l_linger}. 

This is in sys/socket.h on the other operating systems; as far
as I can tell, this doesn't exist in Linux.  Is this now in the new
version of gcc's libraries, or does it simply not exist under Linux?

Second question: the code also refers to a #define'd label, SOMAXCONN.
Again, this isn't mentioned anywhere in the include files.  However, 
the Linux Doc. Project's man page for listen(2) has the following note:

BUGS
       The  backlog  is currently limited (silently) to 5. [Docu-
       menter's note: is this true for Linux?]


        I repeat the documenter's question: is this value of 5
correct?

  As far as I can tell no other programm is accessing the modem device. I also 
tried to set it to /dev/modem.   No change.  I put qbasic on and all of its 
support files for a test to see if it is only modem related programms.  When I 
run it things start out great.  As soon as I ALT (any option) that brings up a
menu waiting for a single character input. It dies..  I can run the tutorial
that takes single character input and it works great...  I think it is a I/O 
problem with the keyboard to programm.  

What are you running.  Which patch level.   and did you applie any of the 
patches that they talk about in the handout?

this goes out to all of you who replyed to my message about term 1.0.7.  I
got about 30 responses.  Only about 4 of them said anything nice.  Most of
them went something like this

'if you took the time to read the newsgroups first, i wouldnt have to be
telling you this.'

Well, i -did- read teh newsgroups...  and nowhere did i see anything
mentioning term.  i only read c.o.l.a and c.o.l.m, but it should have come
up somewhere...

Our news server is very flaky.  i still have not seen anything come thru on
the problem with term.     

Please, when responding to user questions, show a little respect.  when i
got into linux, i was told that the community was very friendly and always
willing to help out.  i have seen that a few people fit this description,
but there are others who are ruining the reputation for the group.  If you
keep flaming people for asking questions, no one will ask questions anymore
and linux will not proliferate as it has so far.

don't get me wrong, i love linux, and will not go back to dos/win nor would
i hesitate to recommend it to new users, but i would tell them to be careful
what they post, because they might get flamed for just being curious.


anyway...  off my soapbox...

thank you to teh ones who sent helpful responses.

to start up after a reboot from linux. Rebooting from dos to linux or dos 
to dos works fine, but if I reboot from linux it checks my keyboard, memory, 
POST, does a scsi prob, and then hangs (right when it would access the disk 
(I cant even boot from a floppy).  If it matters, I have ACER bios, I think.
I tried /etc/shutdown, halt, and the three fingered salute...  I do have lilo 
installed, but I don't believe that is a factor, as it never reads the boot
sector...

Hello,
    I have an application where I want to to use Linux to communicate

From what I've read I need either X.25 or HDLC/LAP B protocols running

  I have not seen any Postings/FAQs/HowTos on this subject so I suppose
that there are no public drivers available.  If anybody has investigated

To paraphrase Ian, summarize, baby, summarize. If more summaries were
given mail would be a better solution more of the time. As it is, many
questions do not get answered publicly. As a result, people who do make
an effort to scan through previous subjects probably find that even if
their question has been asked, it has not been answered. For example,
I was just curious about non-SCSI tape drives and marked all the linux
groups unread, then scanned for 'tape'. Several people had asked about
floppy- and parallel-driven tape support but there were no answers.
(Some postings about ftape pretty much answered my question, so the
technique worked anyway.)

I've recently purchased a Hercules Dynamite VLB card.  Its a nice card.
Its running Tseng's ET-4000/w32 Accelerator chip.  It gives me about
2.2X the performance of an old Trident 8900C 1MB using 3dbench under
DOS (Trident = 18 FPS, Hercules = 44 FPS - DX2-66 CPU).  Under
Windows I'm getting 5X performace over Trident, but then the trident is
unaccelerated.  A review I read on the Hercules said its one of the fastest
DOS based cards for the price but pretty mid range for windows versus
other accelerators but always faster that non-accelerated cards.  Its 
total hardware compatible with the ET-4000 and I've had no problems 
running X under linux.  Its definitely faster than my Trident but I don't
have the Xstones program to tell you how much.  Considering that I paid
$160 for the Dynamite, its a really good deal.  Unless maybe you're a 
big windows lover, which I'm not.  I'd rather have good DOS graphics
performance (gee gotta run that Flight Simulator 5.0 fast as possible :-)

Idly perusing /etc today, I noticed that bootptab is a link to

directory as /conf, which I thought was a relic of SLS 1.02.

The system appears to be booting ok.  I thought bootptab ought to
contain such things as the startup level, at least in SLS 1.02.

Anybody shed any light on the mystery?  (Apologies if this is a
