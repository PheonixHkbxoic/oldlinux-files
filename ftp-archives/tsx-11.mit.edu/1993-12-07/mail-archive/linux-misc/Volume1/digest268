Exactly. I guess that most people have been abused by MS-DOS for so
long, that the concept that the operating system is "its own BBS" is
totally alien.

Which is what I'm working on right now. I have a temporary menu in
right now, which is hard coded (along with terminal typing and the
multilingual stuff just isn't being used yet...) Its been slowed up
because I've been waiting for stuff to get to me via FTPmail. (Like
the IRC server... why bother with a cheezy chat system when you can
have the Limosine of Chat Systems?)  Everything I'm using is "out of
the box" stuff. Trn for "messages", IRC for "chat", Elm for "email", ,
'?' or 'help' puts you into the INFO system for hypertextual help.
(Granted, I've had to take some manual pages and format them into
Texinfo, but I see that as an improvement of the help system...) and
some of the usual Unix games like Moria for diversions...  Just to be
"stupid", the temporary menu displays the current date, phase of
the moon, and a new fortune after every iteration...

Hell, here's a snapshot of the cheezy thing:
==============================================8<====
November 03, 1993; Wednesday    The Moon is Waning Gibbous (84% of Full)
[Logname]: test2                [Full Name]: The Other Test User


Have you noticed that all you need to grow healthy, vigorous grass is a
crack in your sidewalk?
_____
Menu:
~~~~~
  'trn'          Threaded Read News
  'Pnews'        Post News
  'mail'         Read Electronic Mail
  'bash'         Run Bash Shell
  'help'         Help Using Emacs and Other Programs
  'moria'        Explore the Mines of Moria
  'moria-scores' Moria Scoreboard
  'fortune'      There's Contaminant in *my* COOKIE!
  'NC17-fortune' NC17 Rated Fortunes!
  'chat'         '/help' to learn how to use IRC (which isn't working yet)
  'quit'         Log Off System

['help' or '?'] Command>

--->8------------------------------------

And this is hard coded.  It needs some polishing for handling signals
better and doing some time accounting... Other crazy ideas are doing
things like maybe, making it "iScreen" aware, and letting the user
open up several simultaneous sessions...

Exactly. Pull no punches, stop wasting everyone else's time. But I
recommend getting a book about Unix security, clean up your system,

I have found (on three different system) that the BogoMips rating is
within about a 0.03 range.  That means 5% accuracy on the slowest
system and 0.1% on the fastest one... pretty consistent IMHO.

Emacs 19.19 is usually compiled by default to include all the X support, so
not thet is not Peter's "fault" or anybodys.  You can grab Emacs 18 off of
tsx-11 if you really do not use, or do not want to use, X.  Try the MCC
version if you want a small distribution where everything works out of the
box, but be warned that it has very few "extra" stuff, stuff that we found
we needed (mail, SLIP, uucp, etc).

It may also be that there were more anonymous users than the
system could accept.  Depending on the configuration, you may
or may not get a message to that effect.  In any event, they
are allowing anonymous logins.

Hi Gang:
        Has anyone out there setup printcap and associated filters
under LINUX so that one can print text and postscript files transparently.
Automatic detection of other formats would be nice but I am primarily
interested in text/postscript. I know I can write a simple shell script
filter if I need to, I just want to avoid reinventing the wheel if 
not neccessary.  If it helps I am running the recent
TAMU release as a base but have been adding/upgrading packages
to get to where I want.

I think he's talking about me, and they did offer to ship it COD at no

I was going to call some of their resellers, but t turned out to be a

As I related in previous posts, I did a "complete" install, and am
pretty happy with my system.  Getting the pl13 sources from sunsite
solved all of the problems that I ran into when trying to recompile
the kernel.

If you've got 250M of space for the complete install, I can recommend
LGX.  Others seem to have had more hassles doing a runtime install and
selectively installing packages.

Do you have a 16550 UART? I use a serial speed of 38400 bits/sec with a
ZyXEL modem running at 19k2 and INN's rnews and innd do not give problems
when run concurrently with uucico. Not using a 16550 UART can give problems
when using CPU/IO intensive programs.

Get bash 1.13.cwru. Bash 1.12 has too many problems for running INN 1.4

You need not fear. What you hear is the update deamon who syncs
every 30 seconds. update is started by the init process, and you

        Has anyone setup the neccessary printcap entry and filters to support
automatic recognition of the file type by lpr for printing to a postscript
printer.  I have a ps printer hooked to my TAMU based linux system and
would like to be able to transparently print text and postscript files
without needing to remember to run the filters.  I can set up a shell
script as a filter to do this but I hate re-inventing the wheel.  I am

(Troff, GIT, etc) would also be usefull.  Thanks for the help in advance.
