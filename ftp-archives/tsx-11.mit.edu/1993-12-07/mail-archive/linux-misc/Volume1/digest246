Date: 26 Oct 1993 14:31:56 -0700

Greetings.

I just upgraded my kernel to 0.99-13, and I fetched bootutils 0.1 (srce
only?).   I wanted to use bootutils to try and make the ext2fs system
complain (Q 7.6, FAQ).   I did:

1)      Build the bootutils and install it.
2)      Use basically the same rc file as in bootutils/mount/etc/rc.

Linux boots, and e2fsck takes its 10 or so minutes to check the whole
filesystem.   the README of bootutils in mount/README says linux automagically
does a 'umount -a' during shutdown, but I do not think things are working
properly, as e2fsck still takes 10-15 mins each bootup.

Is bootutils really working even if e2fsck still complains?

Is bootutils 0.1 the latest version?

am I going to have to mount a floppy with umount so I can umount root?

Thanks to all for your continued help.
Ronan

No it isn't working. What you have to do is modify the kernel image to initially
mount the file system read only. You can do this by typing 'rdev -R kernelname 0'
or something close to that (I can't remember where the 0 goes). Not all versions
of rdev support the -R option, there should have been one included with
bootutils I believe.

Date: Wed, 27 Oct 1993 01:13:59 GMT

I am using Linux 0.99.13 and noticed a problem which
I thought I'd report.  

If I enable (define) CONFIG_AUTO_IRQ and CONFIG_AST_FOURPORT
in serial.c X11 doesn't work.  If, however, I define 
CONFIG_AST_FOURPORT and hard code the correct irq both
the serial port and X11 work fine.

Except for some cheaper OEM boards, all ATI Mach32 products
have the 68875 RAMDAC.  Any of the boards (GU+, GUPRO, VLB
MCA, etc.) in an ATI retail box will have the 68875.  What
you want to be sure to get is the latest rev of the Mach32.
This is indicated by the last digit in the Mach32 part number.
It should be 688006 or higher.  The -6 revision made major
improvements to the Mach32 performance.

Subject: Mitsumi cdrom - experiences???
Date: 27 Oct 93 01:04:43 GMT

Hi:

I'm interested in hearing from persons with experience installing the
Mitsumi LU005S cdrom.  Please tell me:

1) is the file tsx-11.mit.edu /pub/linux/.../mcd-0.3.tar.Z the latest
and greatest release.  Who maintains this anyway?

2) what do you have to do to get it mounted under /mnt.

3) how does the above driver work in terms of performance, compatibility
etc.

4) would it be wise to save my money and forgo this in favour of this
as opposed to some of the more expensive drives if all I want is to use
it as a library?  I'm planning to use this disk to get some junk from
the cdrom and play with it on my hd where speed is much better anyway.

5) is there any restriction on interrupt number and io location using
this drive.  This may be important when I consider a network card.

My system is a 386/40 clone with 8 Mb of ram, ide disks, ATI XL.  Had
no problem with compatibility so far.  I've got SLS 1.02 from about the
middle of May '93 downloaded from tsx-11.mit.edu.  Haven't done anything
to the kernel except rdev it to make /dev/hda4 the root partition.

So I'd appreciate comments about this before I part with my money.

Last time I tried to (with tar) run a --diff after a tape b/u, every
file complained that the UID/GID had been changed. Someone smarter than

Is this still true?

It even has an english/german option!

There are easy solutions to this. In ascending order of niceness/usefulness and
descending order of nastiness/personal satisifaction/stupidity :-

        - People periodically post a list of fixes to releases. Why not store this 
                and re-post as required, or ask the ftp site owners to store such a 
                file, thus creating a release related mini-FAQ.

        - It may even be possible to create a tar file / shell script that can be run 
                to correct some problems. Certainly I have done this for my various 
                installations of SLS, Slackware and LGX. Damned useful in the case
                of a HD crash, so this to my mind makes sense anyway.

        - Give them the answer;

        - If it is a linux problem tell them read the FAQ/HOWTO, indicating where & 
                how to get the FAQ/HOWTO;

        - If it is not a linux problem tell them so, point them at the right newsgroup,
                tell them to read the relevant FAQ, indicating where & how to get the 
                FAQ;

        - If it is a linux problem tell them to read the F'ing FAQ/HOWTO, indicating 
                where & how to get the FAQ/HOWTO;

        - Don't bother to answer the question. It's a fact that a lot of people do
                not post, or even read certain newsgroups at certain times of the year
                - around Sept/Oct time for example :-). It is also a fact that a lot
                of questions are answered by email rather than posts to the 
                newsgroups - the obvious flaw in this point is that if no-one bothered
                to answer then we would be left with a person with a problem :-(;

        - Tell them the question should be re-directed to c.o.l.development and in
                particular addressed towards Ian Jackson <Don't try this at home kids>;
        
        - Tell them to email me with the question ( as retaliation to this posting 
                :-( ) <don't try this at home kids>;

        - Post a full-monty flame. Nothing beats a damn good flame now and again. After
                the c.o.l.* hierachy is un-moderated, despite what certain people would
                have us believe;

        - Email them, from a anon account, a uuencoded core file claiming it is a 
                uuencode tar file containing a fix. [ UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES DO THIS
                AS IT IS A TOTAL ABUSE OF THE ANON SERVICES. THESE SERVICES EXIST FOR
                VALID REASONS AND SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR INANE STUPIDITY ].

[ Well that's quite enough of my ramblings. It's back to the real world ... ]

I'm sorry this is not a problem with SLS. You did not properly test the package that you provided. You tested something that you ported onto SLS and then assumed that the SLS port was correct. Given your obvious misgivings about SLS I am surprised to hear this. Cardinal rule : Never assume *anything* about *anything* in computing. This is 
not intended as a flame, so please do not take it as such. I am merely pointing out 
that in the case you cite I do not feel that SLS was ( totally ) at fault.

If there are any flames or followups to this could I ask that they are directed to
me by email so that the people on c.o.l.m are not bored and we do not all become kill-file entries ( this subject is now in my kill file BTW :-) ).

Subject: What framegrabber cards does Linux support?
Date: 27 Oct 1993 18:11:03 +1000


I'm getting real close to convincing my company that Linux can be used
as a platform for some of our software. But I need to find out what
framegrabber cards have existing drivers written for Linux...

Can anyone help me out here?
