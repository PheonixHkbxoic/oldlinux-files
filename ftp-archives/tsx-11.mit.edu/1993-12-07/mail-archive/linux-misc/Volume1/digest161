Subject: Linux questions & problems
Date: 27 Sep 1993 01:46:45 GMT


  Hi All! I'm having some problems with MCC linux and the latest linux
kernel. I just got the p13 kernel and compiled it. After I got down to the
"make zImage" command and completed it, I did this:
     1. cp /usr/src/linux/zImage
     2. copied zImage to where /etc/lilo/config pointed to as "Image" instead
        of "zImage" (Because config says "Image" and not "zImage")
     3. Ran "/etc/lilo/install"

 Now, when I boot up with Linux (from my HD) it still says p10 instead of p13
and it locks up shortly after I log in. I have 2 more files left named
"zBoot" and "zSystem.map". What should I do with them? What is going on here?
What do I need to do to make this thing work? I'm very frustrated as I have
worked my whole weekend in this thing with no result and I'm about to format
my HD and toss Linux out of it..:-( Very good system but too much trouble for
a starter like me. It just disappoints me. Any1 cares to help a dismoralized
user out? (That's me, of course!) :-( BTW, I installed everything with the
defaults and Linux, once it boots it keeps checking the disk as if it was
peforming a chkdsk-like command.

I really beleive that Linux _NEEDS_ a screen-saver like After-Dark's
TREK stuff, both for the normal console and X-Windows.

I've seen PC's at work dedicated to running the start trek screen savers
(after all, once loaded they take over most of the hard drive).

You are lucky. Your Monitor has a self protection feature,
when you are using it outside of the specifications.
After a while it manages to synchronize, but you should not rely on
that. So calculate a standard mode like 640x480x256x60Hz before going
for the ultimate. vgaset may help you (and your Monitor).

Perhaps you should look at GNU recode, mcopy's '-t' option,
and the lpf standard printing filter before?
Of course you could equally use a simple C program or sed

An alternative to this is to have your .xsession run your .profile
as one of the first things it does.  Have it start your favourite
window manager later in the script, and any other clients, like a 
xterm console, a clock etc.  Your WM will inherit all the environment
variables from your .xsession (which in turn got them from your
profile)  And any X clients started by the window manager will also
know about your environment from your WM.  Something like this:

  # highly simplified .xsession

  if [ -f $HOME/.profile ]
    . $HOME/.profile
  fi

  xclock&
  xterm -C -T console&
  vtwm

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

ISA is not too bad for most video applications. For most standard programs, 
wordprocessing, spreadsheets etc. you get between 0 and 15% improvement with a 
local bus card, depending on the speed of your CPU.

X gets a tremendous performance boost if you use the accelerated features of 
an appropriate chipset. I at present use a 486/33 8 MB with the old Ati 
graphics ultra. This works much faster when I use the 8514a part with the 
x8514scale server than with the Ati VGA part with the normal svga server. 

The combination of inexpensive, and as well good DOS as good X performance is 
at present problematic. At present, only S3 and 8514a chipsets are supported 
as accelerated chipsets. If price does not matter, a Ati graphics ultra pro is 
probably your best choice. With the soon to be released Xfree version 2 a card 
with the Cirrus GD5426 or 5428 chipset is probably a good idea, if the 
card should be inexpensive. (I intend to buy one, for another computer on 
which I want to install linux, as soon as I get the necessary harddisk 
space. I only do not know, wich model works best or at all. Spea V7 Vega or 
Genoa 8500 come to my mind. But I will probably wait until I get information 
that one of those or another card actually works with Xfree. ) The Tseng 
ET4000/W32 is good as DOS VGA card, but unfortunately not supported as 
accelerated card by the Xfree server. (It works only as a normal ET4000.)

Buying a Diamod card will give you extra headaches, because Diamod keeps 
important technical information secret. This prevents Diamod cards from beeing 
supported by Xfree.

There's C source available as

which includes a program "ANIMFLI" which is supposed to produce fli
files.  I don't know how eaasy it may (not) be to compile, but I
