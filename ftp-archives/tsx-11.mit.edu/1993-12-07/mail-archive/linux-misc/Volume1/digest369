I am quite new to this whole thing about unix but I have managed to set
up linux using the slackware package and even got openwindows running !
Now I wanted to try ctwm but I can't compile it. should I do anything else
but "make" or is not compatible to slackware ?

please reply by email.

Subject: Boot Linux with OS/2 Boot ManagerHi,
Date: 3 Dec 1993 22:00:14 GMT

I seem to have a problem with booting linux from disk.

On my site there are 2 harddisks. On the first disk there is one
primary partition with OS/2 and Boot Manager on it and a extended
partition with a logical drive, HPFS formated.
On the second drive there are 2 more logical drives, the first
HPFS formated and the second is the Linux partition.

Now is there a chance I can get the OS/2 Boot Manager to boot Linux ?

thanks, Frank

I have encountered a couple of interesting behavioral anomolies in the
bootup of pl14.

1) The boot-up log output keeps running even after the login: prompt.
Quite a bit of it is duplicates of what came before (SCSI disk checks,
et.al)

2) My HP-Deskjet locks up in mid-recycle on boot.  The device just
freezes, and wont respond to printer resets or power cycles.

My HP works fine in pl13.

I believe that you have to have freshly formatted floppies.  I also ran into
this problem, but I was able to read the files from dos, reformat the floppies,
and the return the files to the floppies, fixing the problem.

The Adaptec does.  I ran it with floppy disabled on my 386, then enabled the
floppy when I got my 486 m/b (floppy was on the motherboard of the 386).

Typically, it does not matter, whether you formatted a floppy, before writing
a file on it, unless the file system is broken, or other nasty operating
system errors.

More likely, if you get errors with tar.gz files, is that you transferred
them via ftp in ASCII mode.  Try to re-get your files, giving the "binary"
command (on a line of its own) before any "get".

I remember snaffling linux 0.10 the day after it was released, and having

Well :)

How about when the kernel source was 500k or less, or when you didnt need
to use compressed Images for booting because the kernels were nice and
small

or when fifo's and symbolic links had not been implemented

when the serial code was still in assembler

Subject: Does linux on an ISA allow >16Mb memory?
Date: 24 Nov 93 15:09:26 GMT

Can anyone tell me how linux would use memory above 16Mb on an ISA machine
whith a SCSI controller on the ISA bus vs. on the VLB?

I've heard that you can get away with more memory but that the OS must make
sure that DMA boards use memory below 16Mb. Does linux do this?

I would get a VLB controller but I've heard that VLB has some problems.
I don't know what kind of problems. Are there any stable EISA SCSI-II
controllers which work with linux?

Thanks.

Why don't you use LINUX .... ?
It is FREE, has the real X11R5, and SLIP runs fine now.

Perhaps there is something smaller under DOS, doing a little part of that,
but one thing is sure: It will not be cheaper :-))

Linux in particular would serve as a great base for a "near-native" oberon.
Going straight to the hardware on PCs is a nightmare .. hundreds of
devices, all different.  Linux has an impressive catalog of hardware
support.  You can do things like use svgalib to go almost directly to the
video hardware, and get a huge boost in performance. Use networking.
Use lots of different SCSI and CDROM devices. The list goes on and on.
Recreating all these hardware devices again would be a nightmare.

And Linux isn't just any unix .. because you have all the source code,
you can tailor it however you like. I think it would be the most popular
port, possibly other than Windows.
