This is typical because there are few good systems administrators in
such businesses.  Computers are treated as if they are phones or calculators.
There is nothing special about their "system", if fact- I would say they
most are personal computers, there is no "information system".  This is
the price of "computers to the massess" and then management beliving such
crap.

I don't think people see Microsoft as evil- competition is the foundation
of a working economy.  But we are the competitors; and so people will
naturally take an adversarial (sp) role.  Imagine the stagnation of the
market if Microsoft DID have something which wipes out open systems.
personally, I think they are too big and bordering on being a Monopoly
(especially if they keep growing or starts buying up competitors). 
Monopolies destroy free trade, lower product standards, raise prices,
etc, etc...   I think people are annoyed by Microsoft's somewhat unethical
practicies (intentional or not), like having MS-"DOS" automagically included
with almost every personal computer sold today (regardless of customer's
wants for a different OS or unbundling).

I have a similar setup.  However, I've been having problems with zmodem
transfers.  Due to other discussions, I'm thinking that it might be due to
the way rz/sz software was compiled and/or changed as of late.

Most motherboards seem to be using a direct mapped cache. Isn't this in fact 
a strategy not at all suited to a multi-tasking virtual memory OS? The kernel
page allocation doesn't know about the cache. If you are unlucky, processes
are trashing each others cached pages. Even in a single process, if the two
most used pages of a process happen to fall in the same cache 'page' (the
physical addresses of the pages modulo 256K are the same), things slow down.

I've observed the speed of (benchmarked) programs change between runs. Can this
be due to page trashing? I wonder if a kernel page allocation routine can be
made to allocate pages for the sake of cache effiency.

Trade magazines have to be very careful. If they show bias to one product
the competition jump on them and complain, the users no longer trust
the magazine after they buy the product. What is common however is we'll

Many companies would be very very worried about such a claim, especially
with regards to what they often see as the Gnu Public Virus. The prospect
of suddenely losing support or of finding they have written GNU licensed
code by mistake will sway many.
In addition one other thing which makes pretty much sure is that anyone
can go and rip off 386BSD legally.

Like it or not, DOS is what most people buy a computer for, so when
companies like Gateway, Zenith, Dell, etc. ship computers they do their
customers and extra "favor" by including DOS (and more often than not
Windows) with the computer, because they know that's what about %95
percent of the people want.  There is nothing unethical about that.
Microsoft has very little to do with it, outside of selling the rights
of DOS/Windows to companies so they can put their logos on the disks
and manuals.

Call a company and ask if they could include SCO Unix instead of Dos/Windows
with the computer you want to order from them.  Would make for a fun
experiment.  For even more fun, call IBM and ask to have Windows included
instead of OS/2 :)

Subject: SLIP question
Date: 26 Aug 1993 16:12:57 GMT

I'm trying to connect the 2 computers in our room with a TCP/IP network so
we can login and NFS mount stuff between our machines. What I've tried doing
is connecting them together with a serial cable and starting a SLIP
connection on both of them. 

The ifconfig line for my computer is
  ifconfig sl0 100.100.100.2 pointopoint 100.100.100.3
and my roommate's is
  ifconfig sl0 100.100.100.3 pointopoint 100.100.100.2
ifconfig reports that the sl0 device is (UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING) on both ends.

I then start dip on my roommate's computer to set things up and get no errors.
When I start dip on my machine, it immediately prints 'wombat: Error 0' and
exits (wombat.local.net is my machine and weasel.local.net is my roommate's)

If I try 'ping wombat.local.net' from weasel, it sits there and (apparently)
tries pinging, so I believe weasel is set up OK.

Finally my questions... Will this setup work at all? and why won't dip start
up on wombat?

Thanks in advance...

[ Mark Davis' statements about Microsofts questionable bundling practices, 
and Dan Newcomb's response to same deleted ]

Basically, the thing which people object to about Microsoft's bundling deals
(and one of the areas of focus in the rescent FTC probe) is that Microsoft
offers a substantial discount to dealers who bundle DOS on a per CPU basis.
That is, microsoft says something like, "o.k., we'll sell you Dos (plus
liscences, manuals, etc.) at $x per copy for y many copies, or, you can pay us
$z dollars for *every CPU/system* you sell, and include DOS (plus liscences,
manuals, etc) on however many of those CPUs/systems you want." (where z << x)
So, if I call up Gateway and say, "I want a 486..., how much?" they quote
me a price.  I say, "That includes DOS(/Windows)?"  They say yes.  I say,
"How much less if I don't want Dos?"  They say, "Sorry, Dos is included in
the puchase price."  If I push, I might get them to knock of the $15 to $20
they paid for DOS (of course, they still have to pay Microsoft that $15 to $20)
Now, when I ask them to install OS/2 (or UnixWare, NeXTStep, etc.) are they
going to charge me the wholesale price they're getting it for (probably
about half what I'd pay for it retail, if not less - i.e., a price comparable
to the price they were going to "charge" me for DOS) or am I going to have 
to pay the full retail price?  Bingo.

Basically, Microsofts pricing scheme locks out other OS's at the system
purchase level.  If I want a system with OS/2, it's going to cost me about
$200 more than the system with DOS/Windows, even though comparing retail 
prices DOS+Windows is nowhere near $200 cheaper than OS/2.

Of course, the FTC hasn't recommended any action against Microsoft (though 
I hear the Justice Dept. has taken an interest in the case).

If you really insist on my digging up paperwork, it can be done --- next time
I get to the office; I'm working at a customer site and may not get in to the
office until next month sometime.  But Sun has told us (I work for a Sun VAR)
that it's *not* an acronym.  Moreover, none of the sales literature they've
sent us mentions the acronym --- it just talks about "Wabi".

Our guess is that Sun's lawyers told them that the acronym was a *bad* idea,
so they changed it.

Well, yes and no.  Copyright violation does have specific penalties
associated with it.  These penalties may be "civil" in nature, rather
than "criminal" in nature, but I seem to recall that the FBI can and
will get involved in cases of video tape "piracy."  I fail to see how
that is different than software "piracy," but maybe there is specific
statutes in the USA that make this distinction.

Linus Torvalds, or his agents, can always sue, or threaten to sue,
someone who is violating the terms and conditions of his software.  It
would be relatively easy for him to produce a number of expert
witnesses that would testify that the code in question was written by
Linus, or at the very least collected by him.

Felony laws do not prevent people from being killed.  They just give
people the right to prosecute and fair chance at winning.  They don't
actually stop anyone. :-)

>I sincerely doubt that there would be *any* legal retaliation.

Depending on the stuation, I can see various groups getting involved
to help out.  The FSF and EFF spring to mind, but I'm sure there are
others.

This thread is starting to stray off the beaten path of FAQs and
failure to read the release notes questions that the comp.os.linux.*
tree is famous for....

BTW, I don't see anything wrong with using Linux as a base to build
things on.  After all, it is only the kernel that is GPL'd, if someone
supply all the other software after that.  And you can point to where
the sources are (or even give them away) for the kernel.  If you don't
have the sources to the rest of the <whatever> system, then they won't
do you much good.  I can see this situation coming up more easily than
I can see someone filing the copyrights off and claiming that he or
she wrote it.

No.  I have (had) a VESA system with a UltraStor 34F and a Tsung Labs

Give everyone a break and read the posting before responding.  The above
statement was something called a hypothetical example.  No one is
suggesting that Sun or Sun users would do anything with Linux.
But if a small company
did such a thing to gain competitive advantage and it worked (IE they
were stirring up a controversy) you can bet that other businesses in that
market would flock to defend Linux if it were in THEIR OWN best
interest.  It happens all the time in many industries!

Nobody is denying that.  But something *could* happen in the future 
(mostly volume and features) which would make Linux come to the forground
and get the attention of medium and big companies.  Certainly that is
not the case right now when Linux cannot run existing comercial software.
