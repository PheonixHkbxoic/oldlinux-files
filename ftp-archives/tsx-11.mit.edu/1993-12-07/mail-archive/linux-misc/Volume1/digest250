A rule of thumb is to multiply the amount of RAM that you have by 2. So in the case
of 4M RAM an 8M partition should be OK.

As I say this is just a rule of thumb, should not be taken as the definitive
equation, but in most cases is a good estimate.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

Subject: Headland Shasta 4-1-1-1 Memory Burst
Date: Thu, 28 Oct 1993 12:15:27 GMT

WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?
=======================
This is another patch to the Linux kernel setup code (setup.S).

The 486 internal cache usually loads/stores 16 Byte cache lines in a
4-word burst access. The Headland Shasta Chipset supports fast
interleaved memory bursts (4-1-1-1 processor cycles) if both RAM banks
are used. Both banks should be the same size, either 4MB or 16MB, so
this patch is only suitable for a total of 8MB or 32MB of RAM. Usually,
this feature is not supported by the motherboard BIOS, but the
following short program can be used to enable it. Under DOS, memory
access performance is boosted about 30%.  I'm still looking for a
benchmark to measure the increase under Linux, but it sure is faster.

In comparison, motherboards with second level (external) cache often 
manage 2-1-1-1 bursts in case of an external cache hit, but often show
dismal performance on a cache miss. This is no problem under DOS, as 
most programs fit entirely into a 256K cache, but for Linux, IMHO forget 
second level caches, get a motherboard with a decent chipset.

If you have a 486 motherboard with the Shasta chipset, try and insert
the following piece of code into the file setup.S located in the
directory /usr/src/linux/boot. The code should go to the same place
were the bogoboost (tm) patch lives, if you have installed this patch
as well (see bogoboost description). Recompile your kernel. Have a
working kernel image at hand if something goes wrong. Do not expect the
BogoMips rating to increase, as the bogomip test obviously fits into
the internal 486 cache.

WARNING!
========
This patch is, if at all, only suitable for motherboards with the
Headland Shasta Chipset. This patch may damage your system. Use at your
own risk. When in doubt, forget it. Don't blame me if something goes
wrong. BE SURE THAT YOU HAVE A WORKING IMAGE TO BOOT FROM IN CASE OF
TROUBLE.

Just a point: I did this with a Pl13 kernel as supplied by slackware.  I
went and got a copy of the *ALPHA* PL13m kernel from nic.funet.fi, (to
pick up the net2-debugged stuff) and SL/IP dies after a short period of
time when loaded.  This was compressed slip, which works (at least
initially) with my work server, as opposed to the older version, where I
had to take compressed SL/IP out to get SL/IP it to work at all.

Also, my system won't boot until I remove the Sound Support, which is
the same code that I was running with the base Slackware.  But then
again, this was an Alpha kernel.  When I installed it, I signed up to
test.  I just wanted to point out that this is highly variable, and
depends on level.

Subject: [HELP] IN2000 SCSI with IDE
Date: Thu, 28 Oct 1993 00:16:40 GMT

Well, I have aquired two Always IN2000 SCSI cards. I run a 368/40 with an
Conner IDE drive as the main drive. For the moment, I am doing testing with
a Toshiba SCSI CDROM drive. I can use an Adaptec 1540b with no problems,
but since this is a loaner, I have to give it back once I get an IN2000
card working with Linux. I will be adding a 700M SCSI drive in a week or
so.

Searching through the source for this driver, I find comments suggesting it
may not work with an IDE drive in the system. I'd really hate to have to
buy another SCSI card.

I have 0.99.13 compiled with IN2000 and Adaptec 1540 support compiled in.
I have tried the card with various configuration including BIOS enabled and
disabled. The two cards perform about the same even though one is a very
old revision.

When the kernel boots, it may detect the card. But, with the CDROM drive
attached it usually times out and gives an "IN2000 abort" message with some
numbers (and I know I should have written them down). It does this about 4
times and then the screen fills with error messages that scroll too fast to
read. The only option at this point is to reboot. Occationally,
disconnecting the CDROM allows the system to come up...not always (no pun
intended :)).

Anyone had any experience with this type of arrangement that could possibly
shed some like on the subject? I guess the best way to describe my
situation is: HEEEELLLLLLLLPPPPPPPPPPP!

Kind of a heavy statement.  I don't know of a way to do exactly what you
want the way you phrased it, but if you just want to get the file to your
dos file system and work with it you can do that.  Mount a dos floppy
while in linux and copy the file to it.  You could also mount the dos
file system while in linux and copy the file to the dos file system.

There is no current support, but symmetric multi-processing (where each CPU 
sees a coherent view of the same memory space) is not too hard. When I fixed
the sk_buff code in the networking I thought about the issue and adding it
to the networking would be fairly easy now.
Looking at the other kernel code I see some problems but nothing truely
horrific except for the virtual memory management races.

Has anyone built a gcc cross-compiler that permits a Linux box to generate
SunOS, HPUX, and/or AIX binaries?  Will this work for OI binaries?

Is this the best approach to releasing software on multiple platforms
while developing under Linux?  

I'll post a summary if I get any responses.

Fantastic!  I have called both the Wordperfect Corporation and Boreland. 
Wordperfect will not rule out developing for linux - actually, what I was told is
all they need is a flood of letters.  Call them for the address
(1-800-321-5906) and ask for unux marketing and development.  I  *hate* using
wordperfect, but I see it as one of the products that people want to use.

Another route that would be interesting - the Wine project.  Supposedly wabi is
shipping - how is wine going?

OK, it seems the problems I have been having building the
libc.so.4.4.4 and libm.so.4.4.4 are probably due to obsolete
binaries for /usr/dll/bin or obsolete files in /usr/dll/jump.
I've checked and dll is nolonger avialable on sunsite.unc.edu

been replaced with something else.  What is the name of the
