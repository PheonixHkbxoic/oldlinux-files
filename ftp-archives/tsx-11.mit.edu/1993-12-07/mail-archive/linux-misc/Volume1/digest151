Date: Thu, 23 Sep 93 15:50:08 GMT

I remember back to the days where a new SLS was comming out every three
weeks, the news groups were filled to the point of breaking with new 
updates and the project was full speed ahead.
  I hope not to start any crap (to put it mildly) with this, but I think
that we (you) have a great product going here and I don't want to see it
dying out.  I have introduced at least ten people to the Linux system and
they love it.  We wait patiently for a new update and quickly grab it.
We all also dab a little in fixing bugs, but times are tight.
  I hope that we can rejuvinate our love for the project and continue full
speed again!!! 

I believe that the Wine project is a great idea, and it will get many a DOS/
Windows user over to the Linux system.  I hope also the the dosemu project
will liven up a bit (160+ days since an update!?!?!?) since that will drag
the rest of my collegues over to the system (they can't live without their
Star Wars.)

Keep it goin' guys!!!!!

Sincerely,
Rob Grzywinski

RCS uses gmt by default.  You can change it at compile time.

I noticed that when I was running on GMT time with the EDT conversion
that my time was not right always.  For file stamping and a lot of programs
(utree for example, w/time in the header) it worked.  However, I noticed
that Revision Control System (RCS) would never get the right conversion.
It always got GMT and used that instead.  So, at midnight local when I
did a checking with RCS, it dated the file 4am.  All other times that I
remember were correct.  Since I use RCS all the time this was a big deal
to me so now I run local time, having renamed /usr/lib/zoneinfo to something
else.  Everything works perfectly now, I just have to remember to do the
time changes myself.  No big deal anyway.  Have to set the clock a few times
per year as it is.

Well, I think that the total traffic of the col.* groups put together
is about the same as the old col, with maybe a little less noise.

But as for new SLS's often, you're confusing one _distribution_ with
the OS.  The Slackware distribution has been updated (to 1.03?  Or
some such) just recently.  The Debian release is soon to come, and I
think I saw a note about the upgrade of Tamu.

The kernel is still being enhanced -- pl12 is less than a month old
(out of alpha) and pl13 is in alpha.  The work on net stuff seems to
be proceeding.  Wine and Slap are going on "behind the scenes."
(Perhaps some of the traffic you're missing has moved to one of the
Channels..)

It's still going -- I really doubt that anything could hurt Linux at
this time, except an possibly the simultaneous destruction of all x86
chips in the world.  (Of course, there's the 68K port...)

I doubt any degree of development will allow me to run Xwing or Dune
II while I render in the background (At a decent speed for both.)
What we really need is people writing good shareware games to run
under Linux, using svgalib or the like.

(Anyone want to send lots of mail to people @idsoftware.com telling
them they should make DOOM run under Linux in a native fashion? :-)

But seriously -- Is anyone out there writing games for Linux?  Games
are the only thing that my DOS partition from becoming /usr2....
Surely something of at least the quality of Apogee's "sixteen colour
platform game, for the sixteenth time.  But we *did* change the
sprites" series of games is possible... 

(And just think:  In one year's time, CFV on comp.os.linux.games... It
should happen!!)

What's a computer for besides games?

        Sigh.  So much incorrect information, and so little time.  It is the
ISA bus, not the EISA bus that has a 16Mb limitation.  EISA bus cards should be
able to access the full 4Gb of address space.  The linux scsi drivers for ISA
bus cards that do DMA all use intermediate buffers so that systems with more
than 16Mb work correctly.  Finally, there are lots of people with more than
16Mb.  Me, for instance.

I've been using OS/2 for the past 1 1/2 years, and have been slowly moving away from DOS/Windoze
(at a run).  A friend of mine has been running Linux here at Mot. for the last year.  Since I
use a Sun Workstation at work, I'd like to get a disk for my home system which would allow me
to also boot Linux.

Is there a FAQ, and where is it?

It's not a bug (unless it is a bug with Linux BSD tty emulation), it
was just compiled incorrectly. I noticed the same problem with an elvis
binary I downloaded; I think a change in libc helped show up the problem.
In any case, I noticed the same problem: the thing was that the tty was not
being set properly, and the default signal handlers were catching ^Z;
and this confuses elvis. Elvis wants the tty in raw/whatever mode, so it
can see ^Z as just another character, and then elvis will process ^Z
as a command (which does some stuff, then it sends the suspend signal).

You have to recompile elvis with the SysV options and termios.
I can upload binaries to sunsite or tsx, I suppose. I'd rather send
diffs (even though my changes have some kludges); after all, we
do have source for everything.

I get the same kind of behavior on my SLS 1.01 release.  The compiler screws up
sometimes, especially if it has been compiling lots of stuff.  I just reboot,
and things then compile without errors as expected.  My guess is that the 
page faulting system is buggy, especially since I also sometimes get messages
about bad page tables, etc.  This happens on both a .97 kernel and the 99 1.01
kernel, and with different CPU's (386sx and 486sx), different memory (8mb, 16mb)
and disks (IDE and ESDI), so I think its a software problem and not hardware related.

It's not dying off... not at all. It's simply stabilizing. Things aren't

Believe me, we're running at 105% maximum warp, captain, and I'm not sure

Granted, there are some projects that have fallen by the wayside, but I don't
