Not true...  I've never had Ctrl-Alt-F<x> do anything from a console with 
any of the kernel patch levels I've used.  Purhaps you are using a different
keyboard mapping that maps Ctrl-Alt-F<x> to Alt-F<x>?  Whatever it is that
you are doing diffently, I'd like to find out, so that I could use 
Ctrl-Alt-F<x> from all environments.  As far as that goes, on my system it
is actually:

Ctrl-Alt-F<x> switches to a console:

LeftAlt-F<x> switches between consoles and back to X.

i.e. RightAlt-F<x> doesn't work on from a console either...

I'm using a 123 key anykey keyboard with standard key mappings and
US kernel key mappings. (default)

IMHO, the problem of Linux being used by newbies is not wether there is
documentation or not.  The real problem is to be able to do things
without having to refer to the manual at all.  Take a look on the way
one install Linux and the way one would be installing MS-Windows. 
For a newbie, Windows installations is just a matter of running setup,
picking express setup and then picking a printer driver.

Can you say the same thing about installing Linux?

From my limited experience, there are a large number of users that would
rather NOT read the documentation even if it is available.  You can have
a perfectly written manual, but if nobody ever bothers to read it...
 
The real problem with Linux is not wether there is documentation to say:
configure your Linux machine for UUCP.  The problem is that in order to
set up UUCP you have to much around with several configuration files, 
remember what commands you are supposed to use to do test, dial-out,
handling incoming lines.  What arguments to use.  Figure out chat
scripts, etc.
(I am using UUCP just as an example)
Now, I am familiar with Unix in general, but when I was trying to 
set up UUCP (first time for me) I did have a tough time.  And I am 
technically inclined.  Also, the UUCP that linux have is very very
standard (as far as Unix standards go).  So the documentation for
Unix UUCP abounded.  (And linux conformed pretty much to it).
However, it was no walk in the park.

In the same way, there are a lots of things in Linux (and Unix in general)
that are not easy to do.  For example, adding new users.  You must use
the "adduser" command or "useradd"?  Depends on your Linux distribution.

Ouch!!!!!!!!! That means that if someone decides to implement it, there will 
people rallying against it?! I sure hope not! Maybe make something like that 
configurable.

I don't like to see development discouraged.

I myself and a friend have quite a few things we would like to see in Linux. 
Things like raw devices, async I/O, etc, etc. Things that would make Linux 
a more complete operating system. We (and other contributers), would be 
willing to implement stuff ourselves, but certainly not if it isn't going to 
be in the main kernel distribution.

Hacking something into a kernel to get a feature I need is acceptable.

(I am willing to implement features I need/want. I am not going to just sit 
back and whine and do nothing useful. I can understand developers frustration 
at those type of users.)

But:

Hacking something into every kernel that comes out to get a feature I need is 
_NOT_ acceptable!

In other words, please give us small-time developers a chance to contribute. 
It will make us all much happier and Linux much better. If it works, let it 
go into the kernel, unless there is a _very_ compelling reason to do 
otherwise. If it is questionable, just put a config option to enable it.

This is _NOT_ a flame, merely a suggestion.

Steve> How about having *multiple* X-window servers running?

This is awfully easy: just start the X server with a different display
number each time (:0, :1, and so on). The X server will automatically
allocate a new free VT every time it is invoked with a display
number not used by any other concurrent X server session.

So, assuming you have 8 VTs, of which 4 are used by a getty, starting
the X server with :0 will get you a session on /dev/tty5, then starting
it again with :1 will get you another session on /dev/tty6, and so
on. You could have 4 getty sessions and 4 X sessions running at the same
time, or any other number you care to configure.

There are two ways to arrange this: the complicated one I don't like is
to have multiple xdm sessions each one on a different VT, say /dev/tty5
to 8, so you can login using getty on the first 4 VTs and using xdm on
the last four; the other one is simply to login via getty into one of
the first four VTs, and then say something like "xinit -- :1 &", or any
other unused display number after the colon; the actual value does not
matter, as long as it is unique.

Incidentally, as somebody remarks elsewhere, you can use Ctrl-Alt-Fn to
switch from an X mode VT to any other VT, one that runs X or getty, and
the same using Alt-Fn to switch from a character mode VT to any other
VT.

Since I don't want to bother with two different switching sequences, and
the X one cannot be changed easily, I have just defined Ctrl-Alt-Fn in
my keytable to switch sessions under character mode too, so I just
always type Ctrl-Alt-Fn, and that's it.

>>I would also like to make a plug for ASCII documentation.  No doubt there are

While I, too, like to have ASCII docs when I'm compiling (I usually
have README in one buffer, and a shell in another), there's a certain
clarity that can be achieved with fanicer formats that ASCII cannot
capture.  And, you can generally translate from PS/TeX/*roff/etc into
ASCII, but the other way around is pointless.  So I would say that we
should keep "fancy" documentation, but provide ascii too, for those
who don't have the space to install all of the converters.  (And, for
that matter, writing the installation docs for, say, Ghostscript in
Postscipt is an especially useless idea.)

Yes, I understand linux is free.  I'm thinking about getting it.
Has anyone created shareware for the linux system?  Has anyone
ever got anyone to register?  Do people sell commercial apps for
the linux platform?
