Hi,

        I was wondering if anybody would know if there is a piece
of hardware for a PC that can be used for accessing a VCR, for tape
back ups.
        Or if someone would know where I could find a schematic for
building one?

        The best possible device would be one that attached to either
a parallel or serial port.

                Thanks for your help,
                        Tom Monk.

Since my post brought the PPP folks out of the woodwork :-) you're much better
off checking with them...

...in the meantime, if you're *really* desperate you can see about running
SLIP over a pty and attaching the other end of the pty in nos (you may need
a program to connect two ptys back-to-back, since both dip and nos expect to
see the slave end).  Then attach a real serial port inside nos for PPP.  The
result would look like you were using a PPP gateway machine, except that the
gateway would really be a separate process.  (...talk about ugly hacks!)

This project can be found in the Circuit Cellar Project file, Volume One.  It
included a schematic and source code (assembler and C).  It is designed to
work off the expansion port.  As to how fast it backs up...  Well, you might
time it with a calendar I would guess.

Subject: Linux Mosaic doc server??  Idea
Date: Tue, 16 Nov 1993 23:33:09 GMT

I'm sure someone *must* be working on this...

What about converting some of the docs from the doc project to HTML for
browsing via Mosaic?  Also, a Linux Introduction through Mosaic could
be really interesting, with inlined images (of Linus himself, of
course!), audio clips and hypertext links.  Now, of course, this server
would *have* to run on a Linux box connected to the net.  As I happen
to have one connected through ethernet to a 56Kbps leased line (yeah,
I know, a bit slow), I would be willing to volunteer to start the
project, though I'm afraid I couldn't devote all my resources to 
converting 100's of K of docs to HTML.  But I could get it started
and work on scanning/converting images and making at least some of the FAQs
available.

I know this is not the best place to post this...but I'm afraid of
comp.os.linux.development! :)

I get exactly those two figures on my DX/2-66, but always running the same

Yes, it was the problem. I have installed 387/25 (Intel) and Linux
runs happy. The funny thing is that although I have a 386/25 processor
and motherboard, Norton's SI (under DOS/Windows) thinks that it is
386/20. However, Linux seems to disagree by rejecting a 20 MHz
companion ;-)

Another thing that I am surprised with is that on my system there is
no visible difference in speed between XFree 2.0 and XFree 1.3 nor
there is in the system with co-processor and without. There were some
who reported considerable speed gains.

Date: Wed, 17 Nov 1993 05:47:15 GMT

There has been a lot of interest in Tcl/Tk for Linux lately, including
the desire for shared library versions.  Well, my shared libraries are
finally ready for public release.  The following files have been
uploaded to the /pub/Linux/Incoming directory on sunsite.unc.edu:

        tcl7.2-bin.tar.z
        tk3.5-bin.tar.z (includes addinput)
        tclX7.1a-B5-bin.tar.z
        blt1.0b2-bin.tar.z
        itcl1.3-bin.tar.z

All libraries require libc-4.4.4 and those using X11 also require
XFree86-2.0.  Additionally, all tcl/tk applications must be linked
with libieee.a to avoid problems with floating point exceptions.

I'll upload the source and build scripts in a few days, after I've had
a chance to document the build procedure.

Please report any problems or suggestions to me.

Subject: Using serial port terminals
Date: 15 Nov 93 11:44:16 GMT

Hi...

I'm trying to hang an Amiga off my serial port as a dumb terminal,
but I'm not having any luck. I've made up a lead with TX/RX crossed,
GND and DTR wired straight through. I've set up the init state to
spawn a getty to the serial port, and set the speed and terminal
characteristics. The getty process is definitely running (it shows
up on a `ps' command), and the Amiga has its terminal settings correct,
but there is just nothing. I've tried it with a dedicated terminal
instead of the Amiga, but still nothing. Any ideas?

        Tet

PS. Replies by e-mail only please - I login by modem, and can't afford to
    read news :-(

PPS. The serial port works fine when used for a mouse in X, so I assume that
     the problem is not with that.

Mach implements threads already, don't worry about it.

The process server is only a bookkeeper and wouldn't do anything

Hiya alls - I'm using an old burroughs terminal hooked up to my roommate's
linux box, and I need a termcap entry for it.  This terminal has no name
markings or anything like that on it, other than the word burroughs on
the screen.  It was the terminal that was used for their XE systems years
and years ago.  It has a weird status line thing, so lines get messed up.

Also, another problem that I have with it, is that if a line is 80+ 
characters, an extra newline gets through in.  I.e. if a line has exactly
80 characters in it, and extra line is thrown in between it and the
next line, and this gets VERY annoying (esp. when people post with things
more than 80 chars/line), any ideas on how to fix that?

You all've been very helpful in the past, thanks in advance for this time!

You could try ftp to ftp.ibp.fr:/pub/linux (an ftp server located in
Paris, France, at universite Paris 6 Jussieu- Institut Blaise Pascal)
which i believe mirrors linux on tsx-11.mit.edu and/or
sunsite.unc.edu.

You could also try ftp to nic.funet.fi:/pub/OS/Linux (an ftp server
located in Finland). In particular, the great Linus Torvalds himself
puts ALPHA kernel releases in /pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus.


Both ftp servers ftp.ibp.fr and nic.funet.fi also contains numerous
other stuff, in particular GNU software distributions.
ftp.ibp.fr:/pub/vsta also distribute VSTa, an interesting publicly
available microkernel for PCs i386.

I don't know about any British ftp server distributing Linux, but I
believe there are some.

For the sake of convenience, so the proper routines don't have to be 
downloaded for each function. If I'm to believe Digicom's documentation, 
the problem has been solved for Windows, but if you don't run Windows -- 
or if you have an Atari or an Amiga or whatever and you want to use an 
external DSP modem -- you're out of luck.

Thanks for making Ray Burr's smodemdl for Linux available on your ftp 
site, by the way. It solves the problem for outgoing data, although it 
doesn't do it for incoming FAX. (Not that I have any incoming FAX at 
home, you understand....) 

Unfortunately, smodemdl has to be run by the superuser, and I really do 
not want my daughter logging in as root so she can call the slow modem at 
the public library. One of the reasons I'm running Unix is to protect my 
hard drive from junior-high-school fingers!

I'll try that one. I can also probably come up with a way to use a 
crontab entry belonging to root to reload the modem with v.42bis when 
dialing out to a uucp site that supports compression. But I hope Digicom 
comes up with a way to fit 1200->14.4K with compression into one module.

I think I'm probably going to hang onto this modem. The newer version of 
the 144B file seems to have cured my uucico problems. And I'm too lazy to 
take it back and mail-order an AT&T. :-)

Hi ppl,

I wonder, whether there will be (or even is) a port of Linux
to an alpha-CPU based board to increase speed dramatically ?

Let me know

Thanx

        Actually, dip -t and the kernel both seem to work okay with either end 
of a pty... What a blecherous hack tho... ;)
