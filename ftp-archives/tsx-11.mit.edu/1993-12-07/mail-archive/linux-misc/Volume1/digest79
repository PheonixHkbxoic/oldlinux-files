If you're using tcsh, the behaviour of changing directories through
symlinks can be defined.  "set symlinks=chase" will give you the real
directory.  "set symlinks=ignore" or "set symlinks=expand" will give
you the link name (see the manpage for the difference between ignore
and expand).  For example:

  % alias pwd echo \$cwd
  % cd /usr
  % ls -l info
  lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           10 Jun 12 03:07 info -> local/info
  % set symlinks=chase
  % cd info
  % pwd
  /usr/local/info
  % cd /usr
  % set symlinks=ignore
  % cd info
  % pwd
  /usr/info

zsh has this capability as well; I don't know about other shells.

Yes, but really actually, in time-order(?)

Microsoft ported UNIX System III to a (non IBM) 8086 box called a PDP-11
and called it Xenix.   Not a lot of room left on an RL-02, and you really
wanted split I/D.

Didn't Microsoft also port to VAX, Fortune, Altos..  ???

    How does this compare for integar math, shifts, compares, etc. It
would seem to me that this recommendation only holds true if your
interest is in numeric operations.
    Kernel compile times I see from 486's at ~30% faster than my 386/40,
and I doubt gcc or g++ use a lot of floating point math.

        You could probably do it by compressing, oh, 10 blocks at a time,
in which case you'd have to read out the 10 blocks, uncompress them, 
write your new data into it, recompress them, and have some way of
dealing with it if your new data doesn't fit into the same space
as the old data.  This last is the hard part.  Plus the fact that
you're hitting disk a lot more often than you need to in an uncompressed
filesystem.

        Certainly, gzip is not the correct solution here.

        I had to bring up a smoked sparc today, and I found myself
repeatedly wishing I could just pop the boot/root combo into the 3.5
drive, just like Linux.  As it happened, we booted off of two seperate
hard drives, a cd-rom and a tape drive before we got anywhere.  (not
that we got very far).
        Oh yeah... my point.  First, what use are statically linked
binaries when a boot floppy with a root partition fits onto a floppy
or two?  This is vaguely hypothetical, but I think that is a very
practical way to fix things -- I've used it on my linux box several
times.  Better than static binaries, IMHO. 
        Secondly, and another idea that hit me whilst playing doctor
to that 'puter today, wouldn't it do to have a floppy with selected
static binaries on it?  Then all you need is "mount" on the system and
you can get that floppy mounted, from which you'll have most of the
commands you need.  Sort of a "Linux doctor disk."  I'd be willing to
look into building one if people thought it would be useful.  If you
do, drop me a line; if I get enough lines, I'll have a page... er, I
mean I'll investigate what utilities people would want (although I'll
tell you RIGHT NOW emacs won't fit.  Learn VI. 8).
        Sun trivia question: fsck is not _really_ in /etc; its a link
to /usr/bin/fsck.  Which is the most annoying thing in the world when
you keep trying to /etc/fsck the /usr partition.

I'd tend to think of this as using blocks that are 10 times larger...  I also
don't see the problem with "if your new data doesn't fit" --- why should it?
The compressed FS simply allocates more physical blocks as appropriate and
updates its internal pointers.

Actually, a more optimal way to handle block compression is to allow different
blocks from the same file to share the same code table (is that the correct
term?).  The advantage is that an essentially identical code table doesn't
have to be stored in every compressed block for a file with many duplicate
strings, which improves the de-facto compression ratio; the disadvantages are
that (1) every compressed block has to have a pointer to the code table; (2)
if the code table gets trashed, it takes multiple blocks with it; and (3) a
random-access write to an existing block with strings that only partially
match the code table might not be compressed as fully as if it were compressed
on its own.  And (4) that some pathological cases might result in every block
getting its own code table anyway --- but because the tables aren't stored in
the compressed blocks, the resulting "packing" of the data might be sub-
suboptimal; in the worst case, the "compressed" file would actually *expand*.
But then, pathological cases are a calculated risk.

Still more optimal in terms of storage would be to allow blocks from different
files to share code tables, but the overhead in determining which code table a
given block is most "compatible" with would be prohibitive.

I'm not sure just what your point is here.  Are you trying to say that
your stats indicate that the summary posted earlier doesn't include the
smaller files that aren't valid for throughput tests?  If so, you may be
right, but since you've deleted parts of the Stats file, it's hard to say.

However, if you're trying to say that your stats somehow indicate that
very small files *ARE* valid for throughput measurement, that isn't true.
Trust me---I'm a professional in data communications, and very small data
transfers tell you *NOTHING* about throughput (which, btw, is not measured
in baud---the baud rate is the symbol rate, and is definitely not the same
thing as the bit rate, expressed in bits/second, or throughput, which is
expressed in either cps or bps...there are times when the values are equal,
but they still aren't the same thing).

If you have any doubts about how meanlingless the throughput measurements
from very small files really are, just look at the following excerpts from
my Stats file---I've trimmed the timestamps, etc., and have added comments
at the end to tell you what the file was:

received 16725 bytes in 9.903 seconds (1688 bytes/sec)   # compressed news
received 136 bytes in 0.031 seconds (4387 bytes/sec)     # X.* command file
received 3663 bytes in 1.690 seconds (2167 bytes/sec)    # compressed news
received 136 bytes in 0.093 seconds (1462 bytes/sec)     # X.* command file
received 21983 bytes in 13.082 seconds (1680 bytes/sec)  # compressed news
received 136 bytes in 0.035 seconds (3885 bytes/sec)     # X.* command file

The connection was V.32bis/V.42/V.42bis, and the serial port is locked at
38.4 kb (therefore, the maximum possible throughput is 3840 cps).  The news
batches were compressed with gzip, so it's safe to assume that V.42bis
isn't going to do anything with it except transfer the original data.  So,
for news batches, we use the estimated throughput for a plain V.32bis/V.42
connection, which amounts to right around 1724 cps (1800 cps absolute
maximum minus protocol overhead).

Notice that the second transfer shows a throughput of 4387 cps, which isn't
possible given the configuration here (would require a serial port speed of
at least 43,870 bps).  The last transfer shown (3885 cps) is also impossible
for the same reason.  Then, notice that the third transfer, a compressed
news batch, shows a throughput of 2167 cps---well above the 1724 cps
maximum that we can expect for compressed data.

As any datacomm pro will tell you, if you want valid, meaningful throughput
measurements, you have to transfer a *LOT* of data.

The first 3 packages were very, very small files---the throughput numbers
are basically meaningless.

Ever heard of generating test data?  If nothing else, find a huge
compressed file on your feed site and uucp it (or ask the sysop there to
do something like that).  Remember, you need to pick a file that will
take at least several minutes to transfer (for general-purpose measurements,
a transfer that takes 4 to 5 minutes should be just fine).
