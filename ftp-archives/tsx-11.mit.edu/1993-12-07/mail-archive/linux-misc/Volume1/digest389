I have the Toshiba XM-3401B installed with my Adaptec 1542CF and I have
had no problems running it with 0.99P10.  (I'm about to ugrade to P14)
I did, however have to recompile the kernel with support for CDROMs and

This is a standard problem. I had it consistently (even when I didn't
use LGX's distribution.) Strangely, the problem went totally away when
I stopped using BASH 1.12 and started to use BASH 1.13. . . .

(It would fail 4 out of 5 attempts with bash 1.12. It has yet to fail
with bash 1.13. This would tend to indicate that the bug is not with
script, but the shell. You might wish to verify this yourself.)

I hope that the Winter LGX version will include, atleast as an option, the
pre-release bash shell.

Of course you're right about that.

However, I have found that with CD-ROM discs with many errors, something
is indeed going haywire.
I have one of the batch of defective Trans-Ameritech discs, which has
been replaced with a good one.  When I mounted the defective disc and did
things like 'ls -lR', 'find' or 'dd /dev/cdrom /dev/null', I noticed that
there appeared to be a memory leak.  Like if all buffers supposed to be
used for the transfers that failed were never freed.
In the end this causes trouble (hang/crash)

I have not been able to do much on the Linux system lately, but when I
pick things up I will see if the current kernel still has this behaviour...

(of course this has nothing to do with the original subject, my drive
isn't even a Toshiba, it is a Philips CM-110 (SCSI, on Adaptec 1542B))

        I am sorry if I get short with people, but this thread keeps coming up
again and again like the energizer bunny.  There was even another one this
morning.  I can post until I am blue in the face and people keep asking the
same questions over and over again, and jump to conclusions about the 1542
driver being broken, not being able to use > 1Gb disks, or needing new
firmware.  Sometimes my descriptions are not sufficiently descriptive to cover
all of the different cases out there.

        With the 1542C, you do not need to disable the BIOS, it is just the
three special options in the firmware that need to be disabled.  These are the
support for disks > 1Gb, support for more than 2 disks, and an automatic scan
for devices.  All three of these options must be turned off or you get the
message about "no mail".  None of these three options are supported by Adaptec
for use with any non-DOS system, so there is nothing that can be done to the
linux driver to "fix" this.  Most of the time that people have problems with
"no mail", it is because of the >1Gb option being enabled - but enabling either
one of the other two also can give you the same problem.

        As you have observed, it is possible to run with the bios disabled if
you want to - this should also work just fine, but I do not think that you will
be able to boot directly from a scsi partition if you do this.

        Sorry if that was not clear, but I was talking about the 1542B, not the
1542C.  With the 1542B the standard firmware does not supprort disks > 1Gb
*with DOS*, so if you want to use DOS with a disk > 1Gb, you have to order a
special set of ROMs.  You do not need these ROMS for linux, but if you happen
to have them there is a jumper that you can use to disable the extended
translation feature.  Instead of saying "should not use", I should have said
"do not need".  The 1542B does not have firmware settings (that I know of) for
more than 2 disks or the autoprobe.  I would not know for certain - I do not
have the special ROMs for my 1540B.

        Even then I must admit that I was kind of pissed when I wrote that, and
because of this I did not explain myself fully.  In the post that you cited, I
was responding to someone who felt that the 1542 driver was broken, was begging
someone to "fix" it, and was explaining what the extended translation mode was
and how to get the new ROMS (as if none of us had ever heard of this feature
before).  I was quite aware of the function of these special ROMs, and no such
explanation was required.

>installed it under DOS and it worked fine; then, without disabling its BIOS
>(but, of course, disabling its extended addressing feature) I tried it under
>Linux and it failed with the notorious "interrupt received but no mail" message.

        In pl14, the message was changed, so that it now tells you that you
have unsupported BIOS options enabled.

>BIOS! Especially the Eric's posting was damaging, because having co-authored

        You were obviously misled by the fact that you did not know the
difference between the 1542B and the 1542C - since you were not aware of this,
you assumed that my comments were also relevant to the 1542C, and hence you
thought you had the wrong ROMs.  Since I was only talking about the 1542B, I
also did not explain about the other two options with the 1542C that must not
be set.  This is evidently the reason that in your case the board does not work
with the BIOS enabled even though the extended translation is turned off.  I am
sorry, this was my fault for not being clear enough.

        Much of the reason this keeps coming up again and again is that a lot
of people assume that you must use the >1Gb firmware if you want to use a disk
that is > 1Gb.  On the surface, it is a logical conclusion, and I think the
fault is with Adaptec for not making it more clear in their documentation that
this is only for DOS.  Once people find out that they must not enable any of
these options, they then assume that you cannot use disks > 1Gb, and this leads
to another round of articles on the subject.  You can in fact use > 1Gb disks,
or more than 2 disks even though the firmware options for this are turned off,
but you are restricted somewhat.  Here is what you must do:

        Using a > 1Gb disk under both DOS and Linux (or any other non-DOS OS
for that matter) is quite possible, but it requires a bit of planning.  For one
thing you must not enable the >1Gb firmware under any circumstances or you will
not be able to boot Linux at all.  Secondly, all of the DOS partitions and all
of the bootable partitions must be below 1Gb on the disk.  You can have
non-bootable linux partitions above the 1Gb mark, which you should be able to
use without any problem whatsoever.

        With the 1542C, must not enable the more than 2 disks option even if
you have more than 2 scsi disks.  You must have all of your bootable partitions
on disks with target ID of 0 or 1, and under DOS you can use the APSI stuff to
access any other disks that you may have.  Linux does not care anything at all
about the ID numbers of the scsi disks, but any bootable partitions must be on
disks that have an ID of 0 or 1.

The monitor almost surely cannot handle 1024x768; try interlaced mode,

Date: 7 Dec 1993 22:00:13 GMT

Hello.  I am running Linux 99pl14, libc 4.4.4, and "script" from Rik
Faith's distribution of usrbin-utils.  The script command was
compiled by me on the above system with gcc 2.4.5.  I am running on a
486/66.

9 times out of 10, the "script" command fails as follows: 

linuxmach $ script
Script started, file is typescript
Script done, file is typescript
linuxmach $

The file typescript is created, but it is empty, and the script command
exits immediately.

The funny thing is, about 1 time out of 10, it works correctly!

I think there is something wrong with the wait3 system call, or perhaps
the wrong subprocess is receiving a SIGCHILD.  Beyond those guesses,
I'm really not sure what is going on, but I will try to investigate
further.

This is an excellent point and one that more boot disk makers should
perhaps take into consideration. We are so used to our login mindset
that we forget we can get away without them.

passwd and group are actually useful to have, and they're pretty small
(say 1-2k each). They will let usernames/group names show up in
file listings for one thing. But getty and login can go.

I expierenced the same problem with script under pl13s.  My "script"
programme has been working before, with plain pl13.  I would guess,
it is a race condition between the parent and the child of script,
or something was changed with pseudo-terminals.

Did this article turn up in this group? If it didn't, how do I go about

Or perhaps nn is too smart for itself, and it really did turn up but it

What is the story? Normally I end up making a bunch of individual posts,

Subject: New Yggdrasil LGX boot floppy
Date: Wed, 8 Dec 1993 00:13:19 GMT

        The Revision B boot floppy for the Yggdrasil Fall 1993 release
of LGX is now available by anonymous FTP from:

                yggdrasil.com:pub/boot-floppies
                netcom.com:pub/yggdrasil/boot-floppies

        These directories contain images of the high density (1.2MB)
5.25" boot diskette, the low density (720kB) 3.5" boot diskette, and
the complete source tree for the new kernel.

        You can use the floppies as replacements for the boot floppies
that come with LGX.  After you have installed your system, or if you
have already installed your system and you want to upgrade, do the
following:

                        mount /dev/fd0 /mnt
                        cp /mnt/vmlinux /
                        lilo -C /etc/lilo/config

        If you want to rebuild the kernel from source, be sure to copy
linux/include on top of /usr/include before you type "make" in the
linux directory.

        Summary of changes from revA (the first updated floppy) to revB:
                1. upgrade to 0.99.14 kernel, which brings:
                        a. Numerous SCSI and networking changes.
                        b. ProAudioSpectrum 16 SCSI driver.  This
                           driver hung with a "host timeout" message
                           when I tried it with a Texel dm3021, but
                           you're welcome to give it a try.
                2. Mitsumi FX CDROM drives supported.
                3. Retries added for Sony cdu31a data errors.  
                4. Untested Philips/LMSI cm205 CDROM driver added.
                5. More IO addresses supported for Soundblaster-type
                   CDROM controllers.
                6. Updated IN-2000 SCSI driver
                7. Fix for Teac CD-50 CDROM drive
                8. Minor change to support for a new unreleased
                   CDROM drive.  (Until recently, there were only two
                   of these drives in the United States, one of which
                   was at Yggdrasil.)

        Summary of chages from original release to revA which have
been carried over into revB:
                1. PC sound driver turned off.  This driver was
                   causing some <40MHz 386's to hang.
                2. Fixed problems with the Ultrastor driver hanging.
