Hi.

    I have a 386/33DX2 with 8 megs of ram, 387, etc...  Using OpenWindows
    stuff, text input worked fine, but under Motif, any place that
    requires me to type in from the keyboard looks as if I was typing
    over ar 110 baud modem.  It takes a long time for the text to come up
    and even then it's sluggish.

    Anyone else have this problem or know what may be causeing it?

    Is there a Motif*textinput*speed: Today   that I should set :)

    Thanks...

Maxima is available via anonymous FTP from ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de

Maple is certainly much better (and faster) than Maxima, but Maxima is free :-)

Well, it works, but respawning the X server each time has some problems.

1) Delay for startup of actual server
2) Server has to reinitialize, start new clients, page back in
3) When X starts, during the transition from text to graphics, the screen 
   is put through some strange states which may be bad for the monitor.
   Some monitors click a couple of times, etc, when X is starting.

   Maybe X should blank the video while switching, and this is a separate bug, 
   but using the respawn server workaround in environments where users log in 
   and out often could wear out hardware.

4) Its an ugly kludge

Better, move this line earlier in the file and precede it with the command:

  makehole $TMP/mnt/lib/libc.so.4

This will save you about 300k, so you  can copy gzip, tar, ... instead of
making links to it.   Afterall, if you want the disk to be useful for install-
ation and crash recovery, you  have to consider the case when nothing is 
available on the harddrive.

I get random crashes quite regularly..:) . One definite is if I 
run X. It seems that as soon as things start swapping I get into trouble.
Interestingly, often these crashes (seg faults) (elm and nn being the 
classics) go away if I leave the system up and do something else for a while.

My system seems to be much more likely to start barfing if someone is
logged in over the modem (the DT seems ok but it doesn't get used as often)
and, before you ask, yes I am using 16450's :) (DTE speed 19200). I could be
imagining things though. I guess I should start counting.

Same for me. Got mine two weeks before Easter, so I guess it's one of the first (?)
I have two HD drives (Maxtor and Seagate) and a Wangtek tape drive installed
*internally*. Should I ever get any external SCSI stuff I'll make damn sure I get

Using an "old" 1542C with external cables that don't match the SCSI-2 specs is

I have recently installed Slackware 1.04 (great package) get it. But I

Yes my machine has to take email to others within my domain and forward
it to my uucp neighbors. I have a smarthost defined at van-bc just a uucp
call away. And I have two downstream feeds (ve7lad.can.com or ve7lad and
provar.can.com or provar) If mail comes in to my machine it should be
should put it into their /usr/spool/uucp/provar and /usr/spool/uucp/ve7lad.
Which would make sense. (they would call me and pick up their mail)
But it does not, it just gives it to my smarthost. This is very frustrating.
Also if I type mail ve7lad!bj or provar!root  it still gives it to the smarthost
If you have any suggestions please email. I am desperate for advice.

I recently saw a SyDOS parallel port CDROM drive for $309 in the DELL

        Well, I've tried olvwm.  It was very comparable to ctwm.  Olvwm had
a few advantages that I could see.  Colors were changeable on the fly.
As well as just about anything "tuneable" on the desktop.  In ctwm, the 
tuning must be done from within ctwmrc while olvwm does the changes for you.
I wasn't impressed with olvwm's workspace manager.  I could see it's 
advantages, (the ability to move projects around withing the manager), but
I still prefer ctwm's buttons.  I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I like
the way ctwm works.  The workspace is more like seperate rooms than on olvwm.
Or maybe I just like pushing buttons with my mouse :)
Ctwm also seems to be a tad bit faster when running big applications like
OI, UIB.  Maybe if I had put as much time into olvwm as I did in ctwm, I'd 
prefer it.  But in realizing the fact that they are so similar, I think I'll
stay with ctwm, since it's the one I am currently most familiar with.  I still
have to take a look at ftwm.  Maybe I'll have to resort to that when I run
out of space, which will probably be pretty soon.

        Anybody else notice how your dos partition keeps getting smaller 
and smaller the longer you've had Linux?  Right now, I have 130 meg set
aside for Linux, and I'm still running out of space.  I can envision
a day when dos is gone altogether.  That'll probably be the day when
WINE and DOSEMU are perfected.

I installed Slackware on three different sites and have no major complaints :-)
Some files have ever wrong Permissions :-), but I found only two of them.
One, was reported to Patrick and immediatly fixed, the other one was found
while 1.0.4 was released and I decided to check again before complaining.
