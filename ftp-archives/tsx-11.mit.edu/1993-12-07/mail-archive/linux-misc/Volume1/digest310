Took me longer to make windows vaguely work. Linux is currently less than
perfectly easy to configure but remember two things - its more powerful
and thus has more options and also its the configuration tools that are the

Well, Ed, don't ever try one of the $150ish S3-801 or S3-805 based
cards (STB PowerGraph and Actix GraphicsEngine32 come to mind), or
you will lose your happiness with your obsolete non-accelerated card!

You'll have to throw a wrapper around it, since /etc/passwd does not 
support command line args.

I took a different tack, and installed jem2tex, which is a front-end
which allows Japanese to be printed in ordinary LaTeX documents. Works
fine, quality is quite acceptable.

Date: Wed, 17 Nov 1993 20:46:48 GMT

I just discovered a problem with ext2fs, I think. I'm running on a 50 Mhz
486DX/2 with EISA bus, ADAPTEC 1542b SCSI controller, and a SCSI hard drive.
Anyway, I noticed that when I manipulate large files - whether copying them
from another partition or creating them by gunzipping smaller files, or by
copying them from tape - the file system becomes corrupted. Has anyone else
had this problem with large files and ext2fs? By large, I mean anything over
about 7 Meg. Is this perhaps due to some limitation in the ext2fs?

Reply-To: sdh@po.cwru.edu

[ For some reason I can't post this to c.o.l.announce, I've tried twice in the
  past few days, Who's moderating it, Matt?  Can someone get it over there? ]

============================================================================

        This is lde, the Linux disk editor for Minix/Linux
partitions.  Currently only the Minix fs is supported (i.e.  no
ext2fx, xiafs, etc.) and it really isn't an editor, more of a viewer
(it only has a read-only mode).  Someday, it will be an editor, but
right now it's main purpose is to recover files which may have been
accidentally erased or just to poke around the filesystem to see what
it's made of.  I've written a LaTeX introduction to the Minix file
system and am including it with the distribution, one day it may work
it's way into the LDP.

        This project started as a major hack to fsck.  Because
of this, it is possible to compile fsck out of the same code,
and I hope this will become the standard Minix fsck distribution.
I've added a few options to fsck which are best documented in
the man page.  They allow you do dump single or multiple 
inodes or blocks to standard out.  Also, there is some primitive
search code to aid in recovering trashed files.

        Also, in fsck the functions write_table() and map_block() 
were allowed to write to the disk even if the repair flag was omitted.
I have deactivated this "feature" and wonder if anyone can tell me 
why it is there?

This is a pre-release version.  I'm kicking this out to get some feedback
on the program and will release an official version in the next month,
if I get any useful feedback.  It is very usable, but there are probably
many bugs which I have overlooked.  It is read-only, so it won't hurt
anything.  I am interested to know how many people still use the Minix fs,
feel free to write me if you have problems or if you find this program useful.

Also, if you act now, you get a free mkfs patch which allows you to 
specify the number of inodes on the fs.  This is useful to cut down the 
overhead on floppies (-i 32 frees up 14k -- from 1421 free blocks
to 1435).  This may also be useful to increase the number of inodes
on a spool partition.

This is a src and binary release, you get it all, even a free
mkfs binary (6k, S&H included).

In London, there is src.doc.ic.ac.uk, (Imperial College),
look in /packages/linux/{tsx-11-mirror,sunsite.unc-mirror}.
It holds more information than you could shake a stick at :-)
However, the closest electronically depends on your routing - If you
get Net access from elsewhere then who knows?

To find out which is closest, use a program called 'traceroute', which
lets you know all the machines/networks traversed on the way to a destination.

if you wait a little while, the Debian distribution will be out - if you
can't wait then Slackware is supposed to be very good (though I haven't used
it myself).

The most important question is actually - how much disk space can you spare?

I have heard that, with the proper software, it is possible under OS/2 to run an X-server

I have some questions regarding this.

1. Is it really possible?

2. What software is needed to do this?

3. How fast would the modem have to be for this to be useable?

Subject: Strange behaviour of malloc!! Is it (gasp) broken?
Date: Wed, 17 Nov 1993 17:11:23 GMT

Hello all,

After having installed the brand spanking new Slackware 1.1.0 in a 486 DX/33
with 16M memory and 16M swap space I wanted to see how gcc performs with
the program 'enquire.c'. When it came to the part of checking mallocable 
memory, it just died giving a seg fault. So I isolated the following code
segment and ran it as shown (with malloc). It seem to allocate 100's of megs
before seg faulting. When I ran it with calloc instead (commented part), it
terminates normally, giving me approx 22M mallocable memory. 

So the question is 'Why malloc doesn't return NULL when it runs out of memory?'

Perplexed,
Bandu
