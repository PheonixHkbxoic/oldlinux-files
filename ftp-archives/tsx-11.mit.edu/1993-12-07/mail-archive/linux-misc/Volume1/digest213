No, he said 3.000 users, not 3,000 users.  3,000 wouldn't make much
sense since you can't have fractional users.

I read the opposite in a German PC magazine (sorry, I do not remember
which one).  The 586 was only a bit faster then the 486, and the Alpha
was ways ahead.

There are two modes, in which the ALPHA can run NT applications:

- One by emulating an 386.  This mode is slow.  However, library calls are
  still done in ALPHA mode, so you won't see the low speed on a word processor
  (which spends most of the time calling graphical libraries), but you will
  see it in a programme, that does extensive calculations (like 3D rendering).

- Or real ALPHA mode, if the applications were compiled for this.  This mode
  ist fast.

>Note the test was setup by Intel, and the DEC Alpha Windows NT is in

You are totally right.  I would not buy NT anyways, whether on 586 or ALPHA.

I may repost something, but there is much better data available:

German iX magazine recently had a survey under their readers.  One of their
questions was, which operating system(s) they use at home and at work.

They asked 260 people, which is a bit less then 1 percent of the iX readers.

        29 % used Linux at home.
        6 % used Linux at work.

If 260 people are one percent, then there are 26 000 readers.  29% of them
are over

        7 500 Linux users

and they all live in Germany or German speaking countries, and they all read
iX, Europe's biggest Unix magazine.

I may be completely wrong, but wouldn't the Gnu Copyleft prohibit
binary distributions of commercial software for Linux?

I can't imagine any developers would want to write their own complete
library for linux, and there aren't any commercial C compilers/libraries
for linux around that I know of.

I just  thought I'd mention this seeing as there's been discussion about
the possible release of various commercial packages for linux

Which is all well and good, and probably true to a large degree.  However:
Linux is usually not a prepackaged thing to the extent that other commercial
software is.  There is often *no* manual to look at to begin with, unless
the FAQ comes prepackaged with the various distributions that are available.

And even so, most people would prefer to *not* have to look in the manual.
They do so as a last resort, which is my point.  Rather, they will ask
someone *first*, not *last*.

Now, the net represents a huge community of people to ask.  Guess what
most people end up doing?  Right: they ask before reading the manual.

Well, my point is that if there isn't a substantive difference between
users who know what Unix is and those who don't, then my comments apply.
If someone knows what Unix is, does this imply that they are likely to
be significantly more knowledgable about computers (and thus more likely
to know how things work) than someone who doesn't know about Unix?

You are aware, of course, that editors are invoked automatically by the
newsreaders, and that the ability to post news does not imply the knowledge
necessary to invoke the editor?  Even so, it says nothing about the person's
ability to *use* the editor, save for the ability to type in text.

However, I think I'll have to concede this point at least in part, because
most people who post have .signatures.  :-)

Well, modern times have brought us mouse-based editors with menus and the
like, and *these* are what people seem to use these days.  Thus, the ability
to search for something is obvious because it exists in the menu.  I was,
however, referring to the editor on the VAX (under VMS), which is something
that few people really know how to use.

Now ask yourself how many people know how to use vi, or emacs, or any other
editor for which help isn't available or for which it isn't obvious how to
get to the help facility.

Sorry, but it doesn't work that way.  :-)  Basically, USENET is an anarchy,

newbies for posting inappropriate material.  :-)

And you fail to really grasp my point:  people are people, and they're going
to behave the way they do regardless of how you might like to change it.
This is something we must deal with (one way or another) regardless of

And why is that?  Because they did it a few times and the mechanic asked
them to describe the symptoms.  The mechanic did *not* flame them into
oblivion for not knowing anything about cars (such a mechanic wouldn't get
a lot of repeat business).  Eventually, the person catches on to the fact
that when their car breaks, they have to tell the mechanic what the symptoms
are.

Yeah, but the response of a lot (but not all) of people here on USENET,
and c.o.l.d. in particular, is *not* to ask them about the symptoms, but
to flame them for asking a stupid/inappropriate question!  People aren't
going to generalize their experience with cars to computers, because
computers are perceived to be *different* (even though we really know that
dealing with each is much the same in an abstract sense).

But they *are* treating it the same way as they would a live conversation.
The difference isn't with the *initiation*, it's with the *response*.  In
particular, in a live conversation you *would not* flame them into oblivion.
You'd ask them what the symptoms are and they'd tell you.  Eventually, they
would have the answer to their question, if it were a live conversation.

But here on USENET, the respondees are flaming the initiators into oblivion.
In short, it is *they* who are conversing differently than in real life.

Yeah, but it starts them thinking about the wrong thing.  Do you seriously
believe that as a result of one or several flames that they start thinking
about looking in the manual?  Nope.  What they do is start thinking that
(a) they're not going to ask *these* bozos any more questions, and (b) they'll
have to ask someone else who might be more receptive to such a question.

Bzzzt.  Thank you for playing.  Yeah, it's "anonymous" but peers are peers
no matter what the communication medium, and people feel stupid if it's
pointed out to them that what they're doing is stupid no matter *how* it's
pointed out.  People don't feel stupid because *others* think of them as
being stupid, they feel stupid because they regard *themselves* that way
(at least with respect to whatever action you're talking about) as a result
of what others tell them.

Sorry, but for this particular case this doesn't apply.  Discomfort only
works to *discourage* a certain behavior, and the only way it can possibly
encourage another *specific* kind of behavior is if that other behavior is
the only other available choice.  That's *not* the case here.  If you flame
someone into oblivion over posting a question to c.o.l.d., there are a
number of things they can do:  they can give more details and post the
question again (not likely, but possible), they can ask their question on
a different (but still inappropriate) newsgroup, they can ask someone in
person (or call someone), they can send mail to someone they've seen being
reasonably receptive to such questions, or they *might* do what you want
them to do and check the FAQ (and (*this* assumes that they have access
to it to begin with).

Either way, it's quite likely that such a newbie will *not* bother to ask
*any* question of people in c.o.l.d. again, EVEN IF THE QUESTION IS VALID, 
because their experience with people in c.o.l.d. will be that the people
there are intolerant, holier-than-thou types who have "better" things to
do than to answer questions.

Is that really the effect you're shooting for?
