Subject: Xinfo can't find TOP node
Date: 1 Oct 1993 14:12:20 GMT

Hello Linuxers,

I compiled xinfo and ran through a lot of warnings but finally got an
executable. Now I can access some of my Info files but some others not. xinfo
issues an errormsg like 'can't find TOP node'.Those Info-files it cannot
handle seem to be the TAG files (I have the following line in my dir file):
* GCC (gcc).  ...

and gcc.info conatins tags for all nodes. Naturally it won't find any TOP node
in that file, but it should be able to find them in gcc.info-1 ?

Has anyone compiled xinfo for Linux pl12 since I can't neither find sources
nor binaries :-(

Thanks a lot,
Steve

It doesn't exist. If you read the documentation for gtar, it says that it
will be included in the next release. Real Soon Now, I'd say.

Well, it isn't difficult to compile it, but it won't run.
I just end up with an empty xterm-window, which doesn't react on
any keystrokes.

I anybody get it to work, please post your diffs.

The "benchmark" calculation does its job fine, and that job is to
calibrate a kernel delay loop.  It makes no pretense at being a
real benchmark.

And it might be more apropos to say that BogoMip is Bogus.

Install the info-files from the d-series, tell emacs to M-x info (preferably in
X with the mouse) and look at the last menu option.

I can't reach esoc.bitnet as well... (he should be about 5 km away from me now:)

One question: which slackware release  ?

[ lot's of usefull contents ... ]

Do you mean the original 386BSD 0.1 release ?
In it's original distribution with the 256k files etc01, etc02....
bin01, bin02, bin03 ... ? Or an already unpacked version which 
would be more interesting for direct file access ?

It would be a good idea to include all Linux sources so that everybody
is free to compile the stuff new with up to date compiler and libraries.

I think all gnu sources and Linux diffs would be a good start ...

Hi !

I'm looking for a Cross-Referencing-tool for C-Source-Code. I would like
something, that tells me where a special function is defined, in which files it
is used and by which functions it is called. The same should be possible for
global or static data or structure-definitions !

It would also be nice, if it would be possible to view (or maybe also edit) the
file at the found position.

What I have in mind is something like the C-Browser-Tool in M*cr*s*ft's C 6.0 PWB!

Is there something similar (or even better) for Linux ?

If not, maybe there is someything that waits for beeing ported to Linux !

Please reply to:

stolz@fiffi.sta.sub.org !!

I have been having a problem with random program crashes as well.  However
the problem occures when I access my modem at 38400BPS at the same time
as intensive hard-drive activity, or the CDROM and the harddrive at the
same time.  (I haven't tried the modem and the CDROM intensively at the
same time.)  One time the random process was the kernel, so the machine
rebooted.  Normally it is an xterm, seyon, term, or the window manager.

       Linux 0.99 pl 13 , libc 4.4.2, xfree 1.3
(also with) Linux 0.99 pl 12 , libc 4.4.2, xfree 1.3
       Gateway 2000, 486-66 VLB, 8MB RAM, 16MB swap
       IDE harddrive, Mitsumi CDROM, ATI Ultra Pro VLB

Linux worked normally under 0.99pl8a, xfree 1.2 and before.  So this
is a new problem either in the kernel, xfree, or libc.  My guess is
that this is an xfree 1.3 problem, since I've never noticed any 
processes dying befor starting my x-window manager.  (Other than the
famous mitsumi driver bug, I haven't bothered to patch yet.)

This sounds great. I'd really like to use it, but...

it is very important to me to use the same window manager on every of
the many platforms I use. Off course I cannot buy OI for all of these.
So I wonder whether swm can also do without OI.

By the way, are you not also the author of twm? I still like that
(ctwm version in fact) very much. It looks simple and not very nifty,
but because of that it works efficiently. And it is very configurable.
The icon-manager is very good. For years already I do never display
icons (which clutter the screen IMO with all the different sizes and
colors) but have an icon-manager instead on my screen. Does swm also
have an icon-manager? I wouldn't want to do without one.

Howdy,

I have recently installed the MCC pl10 version on Linux.

Will NET-2 work with this release?  Should I upgrade to pl12?
If so, do I need to build XFree386?  And, can I just grab the pl12
patch, or do I need to go to 11 then to 12?

One more thing, where is the best place to get release 12?

Thanks,
