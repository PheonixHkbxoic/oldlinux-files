I misunderstood your reference in that case. You're differentiating
problems with underlying software from the packaging -- I agree with
that approach. So my response to you would then be, "I always thought
that was what software *distributors* are supposed to do. Have I
missed something?" In fact, this makes my argument even stronger. The
developers we're talking about here are working for peanuts, in effect
contributing their time, probably in almost all cases. Distributors,
on the other hand, are charging the consumer *REAL MONEY* for their
product. I can't see the LC or Review Board or whatever you want to
call it doing this work for the distributors, and for free to boot.

BTW -- I have installed from CD-ROM; the only way I ever *have*
installed. Have never had any kind of problem with installation. But
then, it wasn't Yggdrasil -- maybe that's the difference. I'm glad I
was able to *GUESS* correctly at which CD to buy; I certainly couldn't
get any help from anybody else within reasonable bandwidth.

True. But as I mentioned, I don't see the LC as free personnel for
distributors who are actually getting paid for their efforts,
relatively speaking.

I have seen several places that crypt is not to be exported outside

Give me a break, they sat on people's money for 6 months!  I can see a few

Subject: A Linux Users Manual
Date: Mon,  6 Dec 1993 00:08:00 GMT

Gidday Fokes.

As a MsDos user who had problems himself with installing Linux I figured
it wouldn't be a bad idea if somebody wrote basically a Installation and
Command Reference Book for new Linux users. I've started work on it
already and was wondering what people would want in a book like this. I
mean we've no doubt all gone out and brought Unix books and found that
some of the commands just don't apply and spent the next day trying to
find something remotely similar.

Okay - so you're going now after working it out but wouldn't you rather
have had a quick reference book of some type. If you're like myself you
probably didn't even know about the FAQS. Okay myself I seem a bit denser
that the average user but I didn't have access to the Internet at the
time. I wouldn't want anybody else going through what I did to get started
with Linux, Would you?

Well I've made a start on a reference book but I've a few questions to
ask that you can answer that would help make if easier for people in the
future to go to Linux from Dos or Os/2. Your help with this would be
greatly appreciated.

1.   What commands do you think would be of most benefit to the new
     user and how involved would you want the commands?

2.   What type of format would you want the book arranged in and a few
     reasons as to why? What sort of chapters would you find useful.
     ie Installing Linux, Linux Commands etc.

3.   Would you want if taylored to suit a specific brand of Linux ie
     Yggdrasil, Sls etc or just in general with references to each
     specific brand of Linux.

4.   How about a Dos Command/Linux Command equivalent section? Would
     you find this useful if you knew the Dos command and could just
     look up the equivalent Linux command.

5.   How about a list of available software for Linux with info like
     where to get it and what it does. Great advertising for you
     software authors out there. If you want your software included in
     this Email me at Davin.George@f370.n771.z3.fidonet.org along with
     a description of the software, version number, any specific
     requirements ie needs SLS 99.13.25 and the filesize and where it
     can be obtained from.

6.   Any specific topics you'ld like covered in detail ie Installing
     and Running UUCP etc.

Okay so this is going to take a while to do so I allowing for it not
being finished for about 18 Months. If you a know a specific topic or
subject backwards and would like a bit of recognition for it Email me.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I use a Panasonic 562 and have no problems with the patch from
Eberhard Moenkeberg (thanks, Eberhard!). Is this the same one You are
using? 

Anyway, my CD-ROM is reported correctly upon boot-up. Yours should
be, too. Have You correctly created the device /dev/mcd0 ?

Try creating  '/cd0' if You did not already do so.  The MS/DOS-FS won/t
be of any use to You, as the CD doesn't feature a MS/DOS-FS. It's an 
ISO-9660 FS, which needs a driver for dos also.

>I am not entirely sure /dev/mcd0 is the correct device; if it is not,

You have to create Your own device (which may or may not be named mcd0.
It must reside in /dev, though. Read the docs that came with Your 
patch and create the device according to it.

>Also, how do I know if the kernel knows my CDROM drive even

If the kernel knows about Your drive, it will say so on bootup. 
Double-check everything You did with the patch. Read the docs for the
patch. Sorry to sound like a teacher, but there are some real important 
hints in it. (I also have the tendency to ignore docs at first and
to consult them only if nothing works.)

My problem is, I made a C++ Programm on a SUN-Workstation and try to

Sun-Unix, p is a normal looking adress, but under Linux it is 0xc what

Is the elvis manual there?  Is the Xlib guide there?  Are guides to
awk and bison and flex and groff there?  How about the gcc info files?

All these documentation is available.  But often, you have to get the
source code of these, to get the documentation, people make binary
distributions (thats fine) but cut off the docs (thats bad).

Crypt uses very old algorythms.  The first electronical computer,
build in Britain and operated on valves, was used to crack the
cipher produced by the German Enigma during World War II.  crypt
uses the same algorythm.  Using crypt is like telling to everybody
experienced with cryptoanalysis: "Well, here is something of
importance, please read it."

Use PGP instead.  Its main use is encrypting e-mail, but it can be
used to do plain encryption as well.  There are several non-US
archives of it around, I think, one is nic.funet.fi.

>Please email - this group expires much too fast (don't they all? ;-)

Talk to your newsadmin.  Very likely, they is missing disk space to

 Could you post a small exerpt that produces the error.
 What kind of compiler (version) are you using ?
 What command line options do you give it ?

 Then we'll take it from there...

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

AFAIK, the Linux shared libraries use a hardwired library path and
therefore don't suffer the Sun library problem.

Replace "Linux" with "Un*x" (generic term) and you're (a bit) correct.
Many aspects of security are not part of the Un*x design, on which
Linux is built, other (such as user/group based file permissions) work
well just as designed. (The days you could run Linux only as root are
long, long gone. I suppose the Linux kernel is *more* secure than the
average Un*x implementation. The problems arise with broken
distributions - programs that don't fit are shipped together and thus
create holes even if the programs in itself would be secure. rshd is a
prime example - you simply can't fit shadowed and non-shadowed logins
on the same box...)

> With the widespread distribution of its source, people with a little

Right. But with the widespread distribution of source, finding the
bugs implies fixing them. So the system gets *more* secure.
