Heh. Try and write one sometime. It's a bit of an eye-opener. I had a

VFS is not very compatable with the LFS structure, and it looked like
takeing a LOT more time than I had thought, so I dropped it fast.

Perhaps the easiest way of doing things that springs to mind, is
simply useing a significantly larger block size (i.e. 8K and up), and
makeing inode pointers byte wise rather than block wise.

Maybe. You'd pay a big price for not haveing things on sector
boundries, but you would save a lot of space..

: V.42bis which compresses small blocks of data but still gets ~50% on
: uncompressed files).

I'm not certain, but I don't this is true. Unless V42biz is
particularly stupid, it retains a dictionary. Yes, it compresses in N
byte blocks, but the dictionary wouldn't be discarded after each
block. Real time compression on continuous streams is a vastly
different kettle of fish from compressed file systems. Trust me on the
one ...

: In my opinion, the gzip algorithm would be good since the

First, don't advocate a compression scheme unless you know whats it's
doing... :)

Now: gzip is a so-called 'distribution' compressor, meaning that it's
build for good compression ratios + fast decompression. But!

Gzip uses an lz77 variant. The lz77 variants usually have the very
neat property that you can trade of compression for speed in a number
of different ways. Curious people are directed to lzrw3-a. Having a
fast initial compression, followed by a user-mode program that updates
untouched files with better compression would be pretty cool.

: The compression speed 
: isn't a problem since you can do lazy compression, first writing a file
: normally, and then compressing it later. You could also have compression

Yup, this is cool, but as I mention above, you can get pretty fast
compression out of lz77's. Easily a few hundred K per second if you
resort to assembly.

This starts getting complicated, and you need to move this out of the

Date: Tue, 7 Sep 1993 11:56:51 GMT

Here is something to stick in your /sbin -- a small staticly linked sync,
for the times when you've trashed your dynamic libs, killed update,
and you want to sync before you power off to boot your rootdisk.

I wouldn't normally post binaries, but here is the uuencoded binary
for sync:

begin 755 sbin/sync
M!P%D`!0````(``````````````````````````````"X)````,V`N`$```"[
3`````,V`````````````!```````
`
end

Yep, that's right.  Only 64 bytes.  (And yes, I do know anything less
than 1 block is as good).

I should say that the inspiration for this came from James Bonfield,
who had a sun4 version of "Hello, World!" in a small number of bytes, I
then created a sun3 version.  Now, it is actually 'xyzzy' and prints out
"Nothing happens.", and following a posting by Linus works under Linux.

Here is the source for sync, "sync.S":

cat << \SHAR_EOF > 'sync.S'
# include <sys/syscall.h>

        .text
        .globl  _main
_main:
        movl    $(SYS_sync),%eax        /* sync () */
        int     $0x80
        movl    $(SYS_exit),%eax        /* exit ( 0 ) */
        movl    $0,%ebx
        int     $0x80
SHAR_EOF

Compile using the following "Makefile":

cat << \SHAR_EOF > 'Makefile'

sync: sync.S
        /lib/cpp $< > $@.s
        as -o $@.o $@.s
        ld -s -N -e _main $@.o -o $@
        rm -f $@.[so]

Here are the replies I received.  Many thans to all who took the
time to respond.  Overall, it looks like the way to go is SCSI, 
albeit an expensive route at that...

From: jgomezr@neptune.calstatela.edu (JL Gomez)

I'm using an Archive Viper QIC-02 unit using 6250 tapes.
It's works great under Linux.
It's an external unit so can be shared between machines.
I'm selling it to get a higher capacity tape drive.
Gotta backup those gig drives! :-)
Wangtek QIC-02 are also supported.  You'll need to get the latest
kernel (PL12) because the driver is built-in.
---
From bmc@cblph.att.com Wed Aug 25 10:40:55 1993

Dan,
  I use a Wangtek 5150EN tape drive and QIC-36 controller card on my
Gateway system (486DX33, ISA). The Linux QIC-02 used to be a separate
patch, but is now included in the core kernel distribution (as of
99.12, possibly 99.11). You may have to configure tpqic.h before
building the kernel.

  I've been using this setup for several months now (originally
started with a patched 99.8 kernel) and it meets my needs fine. My
tape capacity is 150 MB and it takes about 40 minutes to back up a
120MB partition. I have also done a full restore from tape and that
worked fine (P.S. make sure the kernel on your disaster recovery/boot
disk has the QIC driver configured in :^).

  I'm pretty weak on the hardware side of things, so I'll not go into
the ins and outs of the various QIC features. It's kind of complicated
and I don't think I understand it properly. Ergo, any explanation I
give is likely to be wrong or overly simplistic.
---
From wfkonij@cs.vu.nl Wed Aug 25 11:57:14 1993

Well, QIC-02 is one possible interface to QIC-24/QIC-120/QIC-150/QIC-525
quarter-inch cartridge tape drives.  There is also QIC-36 and (most
popular) SCSI.

I suggest you aim for a drive with a SCSI interface and QIC-150 or
QIC-525 tape format.  Most drives can also read most lower formats
and fewer can also write some lower formats.  (e.g. a QIC-525 drive
may be able to read QIC-24/120/150/525, and write QIC-150/525)
Capacities are:
        QIC-24  on DC600A tape           60 MB  (600 ft)
        QIC-150 on DC6150 tape          150 MB  (600 ft)
        QIC-150 on DC6250 tape          250 MB  (1020 ft)
        QIC-525 on DC6320 tape          320 MB  (600 ft)
        QIC-525 on DC6525 tape          525 MB  (1020 ft)

If you buy a SCSI drive, you shouldn't have much trouble connecting it
to a SCSI controller and having the driver recognize it.  (Some drives
might require a recent firmware ROM, check the FAQs)

I myself have bought an Archive 2150L/SC402 QIC-02 combo, mostly because
it happened to be dead-cheap from surplus.  However, a QIC-02 interface
card will take up yet another IRQ line (a scarce resource), and I doubt
you will find a QIC-525 drive with QIC-02 interface anywhere.
---
From mjohnsto@jpmorgan.com Wed Aug 25 12:18:13 1993

Dan,

I think that most, if not all, the QIC-02 drives running are probably
SCSI QIC-02's. Finding a driver for a a tape that uses an adapter board
is a bit tricky. As an example, I have one of the Archive 250 Meg drives
which attaches to the Floppy controller. Drivers support for this are
currently still in Alpha. In effect, I need to buy a SCSI drive just
to backup my system. Networking options are being considered as an alternative.
Backups, particularly on a system as unstable as Linux is are never an
option.

I think, though, that to summarize, you'll avoid a lot of problems by using
SCSI tape drives.
---
From jpd@usl.edu Wed Aug 25 16:16:12 1993

I am using successfully the tpqic02-2g package with Linux 0.99PL9.
My tape unit is a Tecmar QT-90e, which yields ~ 100MB on a DC600a.
This is a qic24 device, apparently.
---
From jjctc@chevron.com Wed Aug 25 18:51:13 1993

Yes.  I'm normally using DC6525s, though I have fed DC6150s (much lower
capacity, of course) into my drive and Linux never complained.

I use the Wangtek 5525ES (attached to an Adaptec 1542C).  Works fine
for me.  I generally use tar, but occasionally use dd.  I bought it
from a local dealer at about $575 (US).  I don't think the driver is
in alpha.  It is SCSI.

I agree whole heartedly, but I have a very naive question nevertheless.

Does Windows NT actually exist yet, or is it merely a figment of someone's
imagination?  Is it perhaps merely a threat by Microsoft to produce something
sometime?

The world is raving about Windows NT, yet, here in Germany at least, I have yet
to see a supplier that actually sells it.  In fact, I have yet to meet somebody
who knows somebody who knows sombody who has even seen the carton in which
Windows NT is sold.  Microsoft was supposed to go public with Windows NT on the
4th of May this year; has it been delayed, or has it been a total flop?  I have
just spent 6 weeks in the United States of America, but, although I admit that
I did not make a great deal of effort looking, I still did not even see an
advertisement for Windows NT!

From jprhode@eos.ncsu.edu Wed Aug 25 11:10:22 1993

The mitsumis work fine.  Get the faster one though.  It should have about
a 300 ms access time.  These are the ones you see for about $199.  The old
ones are 800 ms access time drives ( like I have ) and can be -slower- than
floppy drives under Linux.  The slow ones are already incompatible with
some DOS games which require < 350 ms access time.  Hope this helps.
---
From david@emc2.concordia.CA Wed Aug 25 10:40:52 1993

If it's that cheap, it could be the old model.  The new model is
the one with "S" at the end of the model number.  Something like LUO5S
or whatever.  The new model is good under DOS, and even reads
multisession Photo CDROM, but I haven't tried it with Linux.
---
From mjohnsto@jpmorgan.com Wed Aug 25 12:13:05 1993

I have heard some conflicting reports on whether this drive works w/Linux.
If you get a definitive answer from someone, let me know! I'm tempted to
buy one at today's prices.

---
From rwebb Wed Aug 25 15:13:39 1993

Make sure it's the "new" fast model (which isn't even so new anymore).
The older 8-bit interface LU002 had an access time of 650ms or worse.
The newer 16-bit model LU005S gives you expanded interrupt 
selection, and has an access time of 350ms.  I have this one.
Note that the current Linux driver for the LU002/5 does not use
DMA.  For the price, the newer drive was a very good deal when I
bought it.  Some LU005S drives manufactured during March 1993
(mostly "D" series serial number) had some chip differences that
caused problems with drivers under OS/2, Linux, and maybe Photo-CD
compatibility.  I think this has been resolved with updated drivers 
since then.

Mitsumi also has a new model coming out soon that is still single-speed,
and around 280ms access time: no great thrill.

Keep a sharp eye out for the new Panasonic drives (300kb/s).  I've
already seen Software Etc. OEM versions of these for $250--you might do
a little better via mail order.  These prices for a double-speed 
CD tend to lessen the value of a 150kb/s Mitsumi, unless you're 
utterly unconcerned about access time and transfer rate.  They're 
proprietary, just like the Mitsumi, but do allegedly work with 
the alpha SB Pro CD interface drivers available for Linux.  Panasonic 
SCSI 300kb/s SCSI versions are also apparently in the works, but if cost 
is your main concern, these may not be the most optimal solution.

I suppose I'm very happy to have had a 150kb/s Mitsumi, but I'm
definitely wanting a faster CD since I like CD-ROM games under
DOS as well.   I would recommend one if you're not concerned about
cutting-edge applications that beg for a 300+kb/s drive.

---
From grina@fujitsu.fai.com Wed Aug 25 16:45:33 1993

That sounds like a great deal.  The only thing to know about Mitsumi is
that the older ones have a 650ms access time, but the newer ones are
350ms.  They didn't raise the price when the speeded it up, BTW.

My guess is that you're looking at a 650ms CD drive, but $139 is a great
price nevertheless.
---
From rogersd%chaserv.UUCP@oneb.UUCP Wed Aug 25 23:23:59 1993

We've been using one under Linux for a couple of months now.  Since
Patchlevel 12, the kernel sources include the driver.  Previous versions of
Linux required patches to the kernel.  All in all, it works pretty good.
---
From mchapman@eis.k8.rt.bosch.de Thu Aug 26 04:02:46 1993

Short answer: y.

I have a mitsumi CDROM and it works fine under Linux. I only have the old
driver for it so I can't play music CD's on it (I think the new driver supports
that too) but for data its fine but not very fast. (Any normal speed CD is 
slow).

I think there are two models, one with a 16 bit card (which I have) and an 
older model with an 8 bit card. As far as I am aware linux only uses the
thing in 8 bit mode anyway. Linux doesn't use interrupts for it either.
If your machine is networked with lots of users that might upset you because
anything involved with the CD swallows up gobs of CPU (but not all of it)
with the polling. For my typical usage this doesn't worry me at all as
I am waiting for the data anyway!!

$139 seems to be a bargain, here it costs DM 330 at the moment including
15% TAX (which translates to $170 without tax at the present exchange rate).
---
From bhenning@wimsey.com Thu Aug 26 02:00:36 1993

Actually it works quite well. I just had to rebuild the 0.99pl12 kernel

the mood strikes me.

If you want to run stuff under DOS go for it. The price is
good and you can get cdroms with, say, the wuarchive.wustl for
less than $30 (MSDOS section). You can go crazy just looking
through the software.

BTW, if you have little children the multimedia stuff is a must,
but some of it is beyond the capability of the mitsumi.
