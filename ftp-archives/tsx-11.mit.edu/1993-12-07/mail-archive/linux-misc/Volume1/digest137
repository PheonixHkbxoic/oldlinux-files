Ditto here..  XS3-4.4 must be the problem, or so it would seem.  I've
tried tweaking my Xconfig some, to no avail...

But, you know what's really strange; csh makes it act differently.
The text still shows up *in*correctly* however, it shows up completely
differently, so maybe it isn't a server problem...  I don't get it...

I have messed around with the help files some, and found that if you
edit them with the ez-editor ( you need write permissions of course),
you can make it quite viewable by turrning justification to
left-justified.

Select the whole document, and then Justify -- Flush Left (or right,
if you prefer :-).

It seems that the server doesn't understand the concept of full
justifications.

Hopefully this font overtype will be correct with XFree 2.0.

With all due respect (Dave has always done a remendously good job),
how come xinvaders is more important than a decent X comm program? I
wish you included sewon, I hate hunting down sources and binaries.
It's especially inconvenient for folks not on the internet.

I wish somebody comes up with a distribution that has a compelete set
of X apps. A distribution that is intended for use under X, and
doesn't treat as an afterthought. All the ones I've seen are complete
only a text-mode systems. I want one that has an X file manager
(Xfilemanager), comm program (seyon), news (xrn), mail (mumail),
system inforrmation (xsysinfo), ..etc. ..etc. Why does all
distributions only include things like xclock and the like? Any
takers?

Just my 0.02 :-

SLS and Slackware are fairly close in terms of their s/w content, both supply 
pretty much everything that you need. The differences are really to do with the installation scripts and problems. Recent postings would indicate that SLS has
more 'undesirable features' than Slackware, but these are being fixed fairly
quickly. A recent upgrade to Slackware has also had reported bugs, again these
are being fixed quickly. Both are damn good releases IMHO but are not yet 
plug-and-play, you will have to be prepared to fix minor problems/inconveniences 
such as file permissions, keyboard mappings, etc. With both releases it is possible 
to configure the system at installation time, choosing what packages you want, etc. 
It is always possible to add futher packages to either release. IMHO the choice 
between the two is abitrary.

MCC this is a self-confessed 'interim' release. It does not have as much s/w
as either SLS or Slackware, it was not intended to do so, and is thus smaller in size. One advantage, or disadvantage depending how you look at it, is that it tends not 
to replicate functionality i.e. there are not 3 newsreaders, etc. If functionality 
is not present in the MCC release it should be trivial to port.

If you are newish to Linux/Unix I would suggest either MCC, or a small 'base'
installation of either SLS or Slackware ( all are small and thus easy to reinstall
when things go badly wrong ) and when you outgrow it in terms of functionality ( 
i.e. you would like X ) then move on up to the 'full' version of either SLS or 
Slackware.

For more info get hold of some of the README documents for all of the releases.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.

=================================

                3c509 --
                        A new card for 3Com. It should be cheap and have
                        excellent performance. The drawbacks are that it
                        _requires_ very low interrupt latency, and it isn't
                        rated for bus speeds greater than 8Mhz. The driver is 
                        written, working, and included in pl12. But it
                        seems to triggers a Linux TCP bug, so it's not built
                        as part of the default kernel.

                        There is also an alpha version of a Linux 3c509
                        diagnostic and EEPROM setup program, but for now
                        users that don't like the defaults should use the
                        MS-DOS EEPROM setup program.
 
                3c579 --
                        The EISA version of the 509. The current EISA version
                        uses the same 16 bit wide chip rather than a 32 bit
                        interface, so the performance increase isn't stunning.
                        The 3c509 driver should work with the EISA
                        version, but I have neither an EISA machine nor
                        a 3c579 to test it on.

Thank you for brightening my day!

Interleaf has a dos version which from what I've heard is dog slow.
It a memory hog under SunOS. I love it but don't know if it's
actually such a feasible product for small machines. I know
Interleaf is on the net... anyone have an address to suggest a Linux
port? A trimmed-down version *might* be plausible and perhaps they
could take the route of ParcPlace and consider it a free demo of the
real thing for other platforms.

Mentor is a similar resource hog. 8.2 recommends 64M ram! More likely
you would be able to get something like (semi-)autocad. Mentor
is also super-high priced, absolutely nobody would be able to afford
a linux version that would make Mentor any money, and the price/performance
ratio would be horrible.

I'm not sure about frame but with Mentor behind it, we know the only
way it can go resource-wise...

Or were you just joking?

This sounds very similar to the trouble a guy here at work had with
Comtrade (after I had a good experience with them and recommended them
to him). I ordered from them specifically because they advertised the
configuration I wanted to run Linux and the price for that configuration
was better than other places, after adding in all the options to
"upgrade" their advertised systems. Shipping was slow and my salesperson
was semi-incompetent but the system was a good deal.

But when this other guy didn't get his system at the expected time (he
ordered right before the ram prices went up), he called them up and
found out it hadn't even been shipped! They told him they had been
calling people for more money due to the ram prices. He hadn't been
called or charged any more but they just hadn't shipped his system. He
complained pretty loudly and they shipped it to him next day air. Anyway
I think this idea of trying to raise prices after the orders are placed
is poor business. I don't mind prices changing after being advertised
(his initial price was actually *lower* than the ad he bought from) but
once you place your order, and especially once they charge your card,
is a different story. Especially since they had to have had *all* the
equipment in stock at the time his order was placed and they didn't pay
any more for the ram that was put in his particular system.
I don't care about the business or legal validity of what they did --
it is still treating their customers like crap and they're not getting
any more business from me.

This was told to me by a person from the net and I think it is very good
advice and I plan to use it when I buy a system.  As you close your order
with the salesperson, have them FAX you your order in all its details.  
That way if anything goes wrong you have a hardcopy of your order that they
