I know it was going to come to this. Linux vs. NT is a silly debate because
we're talking about two different products for two different audiences.
I really wish the person who started this thread (who is probably laughing
his/her fool head off now) would have just left it alone.

The original post is full of inaccuracies about Linux. It seemed to be
phrased is such a way to put Linux in a worse light than it actually is
and NT in it's best possible light.

So please folks if your going to argue (and you're going to argue) at least
take a deep breath before you post you scathing counter-attacks.

I'd like to point out the inaccuracies about Linux in the post below.

There's no competition here. NT is going to get it's clientele and Linux
is going to be used by folks who like it. I run Unix at work, I run Unix
at school. Linux gives me an opportunity to run Unux at home on fairly
efficient, commodity cost equipment.

You are correct that in the current release that all the device drivers
are in the kernel. However there is a loadable kernel driver out and has
been put in the latest SLS release.

I can only speak from personal experience about the file system. I've had
the ext2 file system on 4 different machines for a grand total of about
6 months of system time. I've never had an fs failure. I usually don't
check the file system each and every time, but I am careful about 
explicitly syncing the disk each time before I shut my machines down.

Exactly how do you use an OS with no applications? I use my Linux boxes
to do the same types of activities I perform on SparcStations and
Decstations I have at work.

- Document preparation using TeX
- file transfer and remote login using ftp and telnet. At home I use
  the wonderful term program to have multiple session over my modem.
- I do software development for my single board computers.
- I play games under Xwindows
- I use xv to view GIFs.
- Read mail and News.

By the way I'm downloading the Motif file manager to my box here
while I respond to your message via term. Of course I'm staring at the
OS the whole time. ;-)

Of course I can drag out my list but I prefer not. I have on my Linux box
the tools that I need to get the job done. I'm sure your DOS/Windows/NT
setup does the same.

> Go figure. And on top of that we now have the superior os!

That's right a superior OS that require more memory to run Win 3.1 apps
slower than Win 3.1 runs them now.

And just like you're superios OS Linux can run DOS apps in a virtual
window and will be able to run Windows 3.1 apps.

And unlike your superior OS Linux is and will always be free with source
code available. I'll have to remember to send my NT purchase price to Linus
one day....

I guess comp.os.linux.misc isn't ours.

We're not bitter. We simply want our OS represented as it is. Micro$oft
probably cringe if we asked the same of NT.

As for your assertion that we should get out of your group we finally
agree on something. Someone posted the list as flame bait. Someone is
doing a good job. If everyone (including myself) would shut up and
ignore the thread it would go away.

I wouldn't trade Linux for anything else, you feel the same about NT.
Let's agree we disagree and let that be the end of it.

No he cannot. These scripts were made specifically for the interface
and installation of a GPLed product (linux), hence they fall under the
GPL. If Peter made them for OS/2 or NT it would be another matter, but
not here.

It's also against the spirit of the GPL. Take a GPLed software and
start imposing restrictions on its distribution. That's *exactly* what
the GPL is intended to impede. You cannot have it both ways: make
money out of GPL software and then complain when people start making
use of the fact that it's under the GPL.

 Bah, your attempt at a flame does not bother me in the least.  I have read
comp.sys.amiga.advocacy and survived!  Can you say the same, coming from
your nice safe ms-windows.advocacy group!?

 I'm not sure why your kernel is less than 200K in size.   I also want to
know why if it's so small, the entire system requires 12 Meg?
I was going to buy it, but in order to spend $300, I'm going to have to
spend $600 upgrading my computer. :(

 I agree, I don't think one should have to recompile the kernel to add
drivers.  It's disappointing.  At least with SCO Unix, you only have to
relink everything.

 I'm not sure what you mean by drag and drop.  I guess since I don't
understand what you mean, then it must not be important to me.
 If you mean cut & paste.  Oh, I love doing that every day using xterm's.
It makes programming so much easier.  But then you probably wouldn't know
what it is to do real work, as you're spending half your time getting
windows to run. :)

 I'm not sure what applications you want.  I guess for a machine at home I
have what I need with Linux.  Sure it doesn't have the same apps as our
DECstation at work, but at least it's friendly to use.

 Actually you still don't have ESRI's Arc/Info. Not that Linux does either,
but until you have ESRI's Arc/Info for Windows NT, I'm not going to care too
much.  That's what I use our DECstation for, and that's what is important.

 He does have a good point.  I'm not sure why people crossposted this.  I'd
prefer to keep the advocacy stuff out of the linux groups and in the
windows/amiga/os2/mac groups where it belongs.

>P.S. I have nothing to do with that checklist.

 Oh, obviously.  I wasn't about to give you that much credit.

P.S. Anyone want to start an AmigaDOS vs. Linux flamewar?  Then we can
crosspost that one to the amiga.advocacy group.  I don't think that's been

It's a bit early for that yet, don't you think?  Wait until Linux is up
and running on the Amiga, at least.  About five minutes after we have a
stable distribution, the c.s.a.a flame machine will start up - mark my

Yes, but how much of the size increase is due to the several 
filesystems, a bunch of SCSI drivers, the networking code (and the 
accompanying ethernet drivers), and the 387 emulator that now 
comes with the kernel?  None of that is part of The Bloat, because 
if you choose not to compile those features in, you don't get 
them.  And if you do configure the world, you deserve a huge 
kernel.

I too have noticed that my compiled kernel sizes have gotten 
somewhat larger since early '92.  Maybe even twice as large 
(system sizes are now about 430k pre-compression).  Of course, I 
compile in xiafs, ext2, procfs, msdos filesystems and (just the 
way things have gone) either networking or the 387 emulator.  I 
have not noted the sizes, but I can almost guarantee you that the 
patched-pl12 kernel I'm running now (or the alpha-10, which was 
the last one to have 387 code in in) was not 5x bigger than 
whatever the current kernel was in early '92.

finally, as recently as 3 months ago, I had X (including the linux 
xview package), a full set of development tools (no emacs), kernel 
source, and various other goodies installed on a little under 
30mb on the /usr partition.  I didn't use SLS for most of it, 
though.

I normally do not post to Linux groups (but tend to read everything)
except as a result of following up a crossposted article;; However...


You say that you have nothing to do with the compare/contrast list, but
you defend it.  Please contact the originator of the list and ask them
to make the same list for:

*BSD, VMS, SVR4.2, Solaris, and SunOS.

If they need help filling it out (there were enough Linux errors that this
is probably the case), I am sure the various developement groups will be
happy to help out, if they are allowed to add categories, like "Is trusted
to run embedded applications like NMR equipment and blood-gas monitors",
"Allowed to connect to the Defense Data Network", or "Licenses source code".

I don't know about that.....  I haven't had this happen since I've upgraded
to PL9, but under PL6 and PL8, I definitely saw cases where the system
didn't exactly crash, but it did reach a point where *NOBODY* could do
anything, and attempting to run any command would cause you to be logged
out.  This applies to existing root logins, too.

Then, when you try to log back on (as root), you are instantly logged back
off again.  Can't do a shutdown, can't do anything except wait a bit, hope
the disks are sync'd, and then use that magic little button on the front
of the machine (i.e., reset).

I saw this under PL6 once when I was running X, and made the mistake of
running GCC while in X (I only have 4 Meg of RAM).  I saw this under PL8
while compiling the kernel.  Oddly enough, I went back to compiling again
after a reboot (this time compiling the PL9 kernel), and it went smoothly
all the way.

Strange, eh?
   --jim

PS:  I haven't seen this, or any SIGSEGV problems, since moving to PL9.  :-)
