hello, I have a wantek 5502enc drive and am in need of a driver.  I do not know
whereto begin.  I have tried FAQ, hardware-howto and they did not help.  Trying to configure Linux from the beginning is a little tuff for a new-unix user.  I
need all the help I can get.  

Thanks...MIke

Yes, there is the linux-activist mailing list. You can find out all about it
by reading the Linux FAQ which is avilable from any decent archive site
(try sunsite.unc.edu ot tsx-11.mit.edu).

    The 274x series is not compatible with 174x.  The old drivers
won't work.  If I ever manage to find some free time, I'll be attempting a
driver for the 274x. It currently looks like serious development won't start
til late December or January.  I'm not sure when I'll have an Alpha driver 
ready for testing.

I hear that they did not even do this on their last CD. Of course I have not
even seen mine so this is just hear-say (read-say??).

Don't forget that they are also providing a bad reputation.

About the giveaway, I'm not sure that the winners will be all that lucky.
If they have to wait half a year to get the CD...

Any idea what is causing this and/or how to fix it?

I have rebuilt the kernel a few times, and this is what happened on the

Ftape is a package to allow floppy controller QIC-80 drives
to be supported by tar, the unix tape archive program.
If you have a supported scsi drive, you don't need this,
_just_  recompile the kernel and make sure you have scsi tape support
selected when you "make config".

See LDP install-guide.

Hi to all the LinuXers out there in the matrix,

I have a question about a platform for LinuX - perhaps many have
asked before (but I curently haven't got the time to read all the
news) ... :-(

Has anybody installed LinuX on a Pentium machine ?
If somebody has, please mail me Your hardware setup and what kind
of problems You faced installing it ... and is this setup worth its
money ?

If anybody else wants this kind of information, just send me a mail
and I'll forward You any mails I'll (hopefully) receive.


Thanx in advance

        You have to type 'shutdown ' and the time you want it to shutdown.
        ie. If it is now 5:00 pm and you want it to go down in a half an
        hour, you type 'shutdown 17:30'.

        You can also type 'shutdown now' for immediate use.

        If you've already done all this and it still doesn't work,
        sorry, I only know the basics.  That is unless you've got 
        some sort of error message.

Ah, you forgot the non-MailNet linux-activists mailing list! :)

Hey now, I *still* use pax, and am the one guilty of breaking the FAQ by
using it on the boot/root diskettes. Of course, I finally broke down and
implemented the z option. (Yes, the creeping featuritis thread is hardly a
new one to the Linux community - features won last time, in the case of pax
vs. GNU tar (and ash vs. bash).)

Anybody interested in getting the source for pax? I wouldn't have time to
release it until next year (around February, at best), but if there's
significant interest....

> ...new filesystems were a dime-a-dozen?

They still are, really, although most of the new ones seem to be genuinely
new, rather than variants on the minix fs with longer filenames.

How about:
 ...support for non-color monitors? (0.11, if I remember right)
 ...ash? (bash won this one hands down, too -- so much for minimal features)
 ...simpleinit? (call me old-fashioned, but I'm still using it)

 ...pfdisk? efdisk?
 ...banjo.concert.net?
 ...the Linux Directory Structure Standard?
 ..."Remember, the only stupid questions are the ones you don't ask."?
 ...impure executables? (still exist, but they didn't always)
 ...libsoft and libhard?

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

I'm looking for a programm with the the funktions of Pagemaker, Calamus or Arts&Letters.
Yes, I know that this is quite impossible. But I need a word-processor with the functions
of a DTP programm. If the WORD-project does this, I'm going to force it, instead of writing
a new program.

What is the status of the WORD-project. I joined the channel yesterday.
