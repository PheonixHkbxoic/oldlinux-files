Subject: Call for printcap entries and print filters
Date: Thu, 18 Nov 1993 22:33:10 GMT

Hello all fellow Linux adventurers:

        After posting a question a little while back about printfilters
for Postscript printers, I have seen a large number of questions on
printcaps and filters for various printers.  As a small service to the
Linux community I have decided to put together a package of
printcap entries and filters for various printers.  I recieved several
after my post but am interested in getting others.  If you have
a printcap entry and/or filters for either PS or Non-PS printers please
mail them to me.  I will be putting this package together over the
next several days (and with a little luck will get it out before
turkey day).  If anyone knows of any archive sites which have filters
or printcaps let me know and I will add them.

        If this is totally useless,     because there is already
such a beast out there let me know also.

Linux should probably change - this behaviour is not permitted in the
current draft of the POSIX.12 standard, where the timeout parameter is
declared a const struct timeval *.

This may have been changed as a result of the ballot, but I would
hope not since POSIX is supposed to codify existing behaviour where
possible and that has been not to change the value.

As far as I know the answer is nobody is doing it. Token ring is a pain in

Since libc.so.4.4.4 requires ld.so, wouldn't the following be much smarter
(and safer):

cd /lib
ln -s zlibc.so.4 libc.so.4.z
ldconfig

This way, you have less dangers of what happens if you mistype one of the
commands.  "ldconfig" is designed to be safer than ln -sf, so why not take
advantage of it?

Even better, with your next release you can include this like as part of
the tar file, so all the user has to do is type "ldconfig".  (Assuming 
they correctly installed ld.so).

> With the source distribution, there is no problem, "make install" takes care

I hope you don't make the same mistake that the "libc" distribution does...
With libc, libc.so.4 is copyied to libc.so.4.old.  So when you type "ldconfig"
the old version is used instead of the new version!

lar3ry gensch (a coauthor of xcomm) also mailed me, telling me the same. Now
the product is called xc, a successor of xcomm. The B+ is implemented as an
INTERNAL protocol, i.e. it is NOT a standalone program. As I want to integrate
it into SEYON I need a standalone program. lar3ry suggested to try to make it
standalone (from xc); I've tried, but uhhh, doesn't seem to be very easy. So if
somebody knows another solution, please tell me; in the meantime I keep hacking
with xc.

BTW: J.P. Radley (the current maintainer of XC) sounded not too excited about

Subject: Re: Intercal & Linux
Date: Fri, 19 Nov 1993 00:22:18 GMT



I appologise  if my posting about intercal & linux left some people
confused. I made a couple of silly assumptions:

a) That most people in this group would know about intercal. ( Hands up,
   how many people have NOT read 'The Hackers Dictionary' )
   Here is a small excerpt from the intercal manual:

             The  other  major  importance  of  INTERCAL lies in its
        seemingly inexhaustible capacity for  amazing  one's  fellow
        programmers,  confounding programming shop managers, winning
        friends, and influencing people.   It is  a  well-known  and
        oft-demonstrated   fact   that   a   person  whose  work  is
        incomprehensible is held in high esteem.   For  example,  if
        one  were to state that the simplest way to store a value of
        65536 in a 32-bit INTERCAL variable is:

                         DO :1 <- #0$#256

        any sensible programmer would  say  that  that  was  absurd.
        Since  this  is  indeed  the simplest method, the programmer
        would be made to look foolish in  front  of  his  boss,  who
        would of course have happened to turn up, as bosses are wont
        to  do.   The  effect  would  be no less devastating for the
        programmer having been correct.


b) That most of you wuld have access to an 'Archie' somewhere to get the
   location of packages.

For those of you who wish to get intercal, I ftp'd intercal0.9.tar.Z
from sequoia.lle.rochester.edu:/pub/intercal. Our local Archie came up with
the following other references ( note that some of these are newsgroup
archives, intercal versions written in perl etc. and may not be relevant. )

Yes, but you're being somewhat confused.  You're calling it 'server'

As fast as possible.  This isn't going to be an optimal solution, but

The client side to run the actual applications while your OS/2 server

emacs can read gzipped info files already. It tries to gunzip these files, but

I think that we have seen this before.
From the sunOS man page on select():
     select() should probably return the time remaining from  the
     original  timeout,  if  any,  by modifying the time value in
     place.  This may be implemented in future  versions  of  the
     system.   Thus,  it  is  unwise  to  assume that the timeout
     pointer will be unmodified by the select() call.
I believe that Linux DOES modify the time value in the
timeout field as suggested, so

Only waits the first time through.
