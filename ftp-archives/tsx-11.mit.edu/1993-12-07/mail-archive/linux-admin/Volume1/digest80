Folks are *still* trying to tell me it's a permissions problem...  It ISN'T.

Others are *still* trying to tell me it's because my .profile doesn't get
executed by xdm, but it DOES (I included it in every shell-script there was).

It seems that no matter where I define LD_LIBRARY_PATH (and export it),
the programs JUST DON'T SEEM TO BE SEARCHING THAT PATH!  Why?

Well, I solved the "more" problem by adding a line to my .profile:

        unset TERMCAP

For some reason, the TERMCAP variable gets set to a bad value when I come
in through xdm.  I don't know why.

I suspect that this has something to do with the fact that LD_LIBRARY_PATH
isn't being searched.  I've hacked a quick workaround by linking the shared
X libraries into the root directory, but the fact that the binaries are
looking for "//libXaw.so.3" makes me think the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable
isn't getting used properly.

I suspect this was the reason the TERMCAP variable was getting set wrong
since the /usr/lib/terminfo file is *not* linked up to root.

I do *NOT* want to link all my libraries into my root directory.
Can someone give me a clue why TAMU.99.12+ would be behaving this way?

    Thank you for posting thousands of lines of your configuration

Especially when I'm paying for my feed.  I *LOVE* paying for stuff
like that.


   Do I think you're doing anything wrong?  Yes.  How about showing
a little bit of awareness of proper posting techniques?  The one in
question says that you *DON'T* post huge copies of source/configuration
files.  You *MAIL* them to the .00005% of the people who respond to you
and say that they might have solutions, instead of clogging the net
with otherwise useless data.

   Please keep this in mind in the future.

Date: Mon, 27 Sep 1993 17:40:04 GMT

I am using uugetty(getty_ps?) and have the ringback feature enabled.
We have a USR Internal Sportster 14.4 modem, and everything worked
fine for a while.  After restarting my computer however I could not
get the modem to answer.  I set the appropriate DIP switch so that ATZ
would reset the modem to its factory defaults instead of the
Non-volatile ram setups, and now the modem answers fine, but screws up
in the getlogname() call.  I have the debug option turned on in my
uugetty.ttyS1 file, and the debug output doesn't report any errors.
After the modems connect though I get a line of about 30 characters of
garbage (though all the characters are the same).  Anything I type is
echoed as garbage.  My uugetty.ttyS1 file is as follows, and worked
for some time before the reboot.

SYSTEM=nmrlab-pc
DEBUG=777
VERSION=/proc/version
LOGIN=/bin/login
ISSUE=/etc/issue

Any help would be greatly appreciated. One of our undergrads has
been diagnosed with cancer but would like to continue with her

Thank you very much for your time.

   Here is the problem : I trid to use SLIP of my linux box to connect to
the SLIP server of my school. After the connection, and entering the server's
SLIP mode, the server only gives me my ip number but NO server's IP. Therefore,
I can not use 'remote' in dip to set the remote's ip. This SLIP connection
works well under DOS using NCSA telnet with BOOTP. How do I make a SLIP
connection with BOOTP under linux.
Thanks in advance.

Subject: Disk corrupted during Slackware install
Date: Mon, 27 Sep 1993 18:37:54 GMT


A few days ago, I tried to install the Slackware 1.0.3 distribution using the
"test" 5.25 boot-root disks from ftp.cdrom.com.  I wanted to put Linux on my 
Western Digital Caviar 2340 drive on /dev/hdb1.  (/dev/hda is a WD 2220
which I use for MSDOS).  The disk was already partitioned with the ext2fs
file system from an earlier SLS installation (which was working okay). 
The Slackware fdisk said that I had "Native Linux" on the partitions.
Everything went well until the end of the installation.  I chose to install
LILO, and there were no complaints, but I did not yet understand how to make a
boot disk.  When I rebooted the machine from the original boot disk, LILO did
not appear.  After "messing around" with LILO for a while, I decided to run
fdisk and repartition the disk.  After I did that, fdisk produced the message:
       "Partition 1 does not start on cylinder boundary:
           phys=(0,0,2) should be (0,1,1)"

What does this mean, and what can I do about it?  I re-partitioned the
drive under MS-DOS, and it seemed to be fine.  So I don't think that this
is a hardware problem.  I also booted from an old SLS disk and fdisk produced
no warnings, but I am unable to re-install SLS.  Back to Slackware - same
warning message, no LILO, and unable to run 'dd' to make a boot disk.

Could LILO have caused the problem?  Is Slackware's fdisk at fault?  And how
can I *fix* it?!!

I would appreciate any help.

The shadow suite is correct. It *does* create accounts which are locked as

Yes, Peter damn well *IS* to blame for that! When SLS first went shadow he 
deliberately broke it and has *never* *EVER* *bothered* to fix this 
glaringly stupid security hole despite the seemingly endless traffic it 
generates from people who blame every package under the sun - but *NOT* SLS 
itself for being terminally brain damaged!

It isn't a stupid Unix problem. It's a stupid SLS problem (and anything 
based on SLS - I see Slackware recently "discovered" it).

  I agree that any half competent Unix sysadmin should spot something like 
that. The fact that it has been in SLS so long should sound more than just 
the odd warning bell.

  Yeah, this is a flame against SLS :-). A significant proportion of traffic 
on the Linux newsgroups seems to be because SLS can't, or won't, make the 
effort to get it right. I can only assume that that is because they take 
more notice of their paying customers. i.e. people who don't have access to 
the net so can't download SLS for free and therefore aren't aware of the 
major security problems they have...

It seems to be a law of "nature" that our maintainers of the really big
distributions
   a) are a "first choice" target of stupid annoying
   b) can't avoid feeling that and reacting accordingly.

Patrick, please do not get as upset as pmacdona seems to be. :->

It more and more seems to me that SLS and Slackware (and mcc and tamu too,
if more people get "interested") are synonyms for PBS ("pearls before

Obey the pearls before the swine.

Subject: options hardwired in kernel?
Date: Tue, 28 Sep 93 09:28:17 GMT


I was trying to recompile the kernel under SLS 1.03, to get rid of
some option I don't plan to ever use (I always do the same in 
office with my Suns). 
Unfortunately I noticed that sbpcd.c *wants* that the SoundBlaster 
CD-ROM option is enabled (eventually I deleted all references to the
file :-) ) and when building kernel.o it complains for lack of 
_sys_quotactl symbol or something like that (and I had not yet 
found a workaround)

Is it just a problem with SLS, or quota should be present in all
kernels? I prefer to get rid of it, if else for philosophical
reasons - I am the only one who use my machine.

Slightly on a tangent, free reports only 13800 K total on my 16 M
machine. Its .99pl10, btw.

Does anyone know where did the rest go (I know that 1 meg is kernel text
plus IO space; I'm still missing at least a megabyte?)

Included in hte kernel:
SYSV IPC,
ext2, minix, dos,
no SCSI,
inet,
no soundcards.

Thanks,

/Alby.

BTW, I read I have to enable IPC during boot. How?

Garbage.
It's because tbe people who put SLS and Slackware together 

1) Didnt set the system up with all shadowed passwords as :x: instead of ::
2) Used an in.rshd and in.rlogind built for non shadow password systems.

For once 8-) the network software is fine.

CPIO is an old braindead format that uses 16 bits for inode numbers.
Your machine has over 65535 inodes so CPIO can't store inode numbers
correctly.
