The method used to start the mount daemon on HP-UX has changed in
HP-UX 9.0x.   Look in the file  /etc/netnfsrc  for the comments about
starting mountd (at about line 38 in the file).   Otherwise, you
should not have any problems.

Oh, by the way, the format of /etc/exports has improved at HP-UX
9.0.  You should also be aware of the command  /usr/etc/exportfs.

Hope this helps, Alex!

cheers,
Chuck.

You forgot another solution, pick up something like a used Wangtek 5150EQ,
they have their own controller card, but are fully supported under Linux,
and can store up to 250mb uncompressed on DC6250 tapes.  They can be had
for around $200-250 regularly, and are faster and double the capacity of
the CMS Jumbo 250.  As a matter of fact, I have one of those tape drive
that I replaced with a DAT drive, anybody looking for good Linux backup? :-)

I'm running 99pl13r on a local Ethernet network here, and it's been up

No, the files which are already on disk are not that critical. But when I do
some software development, the files which I changed recently are most critical,
because they usual are not yet on the backup media. So I better renew this 
listing quite often.

And, second, that's not that much a waste of resources as it looks. On a fast
machine with enough memory and fast disks one does not see any performance
impact when this 3-hourly task is running at some nice level in the
background.

   I'm going to have to buy SOMETHING by the end of this week.

   Has anyone here actually saved data to a tape and restored it? What

Indeed!

Let's be realistic here....
That is an incorrect statement.  Even in the best of light, my experience
shows that it is not as stable as most commercial Unixen.  A comparison to
SCO/ODT/MPX: I have run an entire hospital on a single MP Altos 15000
supermicro running SCO/ODT/MPX.  I have never found out what the max. 
continuous uptime is because I usually have to do somthing which requires
my taking the system down every 6 months or so :)  This box handles 100 users,

Well, obviously you're talking about mgetty+sendfax.

Seems that I have to explain it a bit now... - mgetty+sendfax allows
dial-out and dial-in on the same line, and manual answer of the phone. If
you use ttyS for mgetty and cua for sendfax, sendfax will fail with EBUSY.
If you use cua for mgetty, programs will mysteriously fail because there's
no controlling tty on /dev/cua devices.
If you use ttyS for both programs, it works.

Well... all linux systems *I* have installed mgetty+sendfax so far, it
worked on ttySx. It did *not* work on cua (did ya ever get a complaint
from bash about unavailable job control? That's what will happen if you
use a getty program on /dev/cua).

And please cut the crap about "flow control not working on /dev/ttyS". The
kernel doesn't differenciate *at all* between /dev/ttyS and /dev/cua
except when opening the device and assigning a controlling tty (or not
doing so). All flow control / data i/o stuff is completely independent of
that.

Oh... btw... if you cite from my documentation and tell later on that it's
crap and what I write is wrong, why don't you tell *ME* what problems
you've got?

Well, listen, guy: the linux developers do that *for free*. If you pay me,
I'll write you every manpage that you want. If not, write it yourself.
What, you don't know about anything about the Kernel? Then read the
source.

Well, you don't have to read the brains, it's enough to read the source.
That's what you have it for. The source is the ultimate, ever-correct,
ever-up-to-date documentation anybody can wish.

Who needs to know that? If you really need to know, look into the kernel.

>    I'm just asking for keeping me from asking stupid questions.

Ok, then take a weekend off, read all the kernel source, and stop whining
that somebody else should ease your life instead of improving the linux
sources. That's more important than documentation.

Try pl13 ALPHA s. I had this problem too so I fixed it. Its because of bogus

:>Regards, Peter

you could at least try to get information before you post such  a post.
There is the Linux Documentation Project (LDP), which has a set of manpages
put together as well as the Kernel Hacker's Guide, which can tell you much more 
about device drivers than you probably want to know.
You can find all this stuff in the docs/LDP subdirectory on tsx-11 and all
mirrors. 
There are not yet manpages for all devices, but if you want to know more
about it, you always can read the kernel sources (it's not that you 
have to deal with some kind of mystery).
I think it highly offensive if somebody who get good stuff for free complains
about those people doing the hard stuff not doing all the work for you.
If these manpages ar lacking from your system, complain to the distributor
or whoever gave you the system, but not to the people doing the work.
Linux is something some people are doing for fun. Furthermore nobody stands 
in the rain at all. If people would look at the introductory documents
before crying for help, there would be much less bad blood in the newsgroups
and they would get answered most of their questions nevertheless.

Perhaps this is an avenue you have already explored, but have you retrieved
the man pages from sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/docs/LDP ?  I have found
this and the LDP publications a very very good source of information and
IMHO, far better written than the documentation produced by some commercial
Unix vendors for their high priced and (again IMHO) less functional *nix
implementations.  But then, if one pays $5000.00 or more for a *nix system
then one also purchases the privilege to complain about the documentation?
I personally LIKE having the source to go to to find out what's really going
on and where I have misinterpreted something!

        To all the developers and LDPers goes my unending praise and 
respect for their knowledge and efforts.  It is most appreciated.

        Sincerely,
