But if they have root access, why bother with the rigamarole?  Just touch the

Following Linus' suggestions I went and checked my /etc/networks file
as well as upgraded my libc to the current one (v4.4.4).  So now
my flags look correct.  (They are N routes)

Well, now my routing table doesn't look bogus anymore, yet the results
are identical.  (Or at least as far as I tested).  Basicaly, what it
comes down to is the routes have flags "UN" for networks (Which is what 
it should be, I think) yet as soon as I start "routed", networking
to other machines stops working.

My routing table lists:
150.8.4.0       *                       UN      0  23   eth0
150.8.4.0       utx.unitrx.com          UGN     0  0    eth0

Same for the other  route.

Yup, was using v4.4.1 and was indeed giving me 'network unreachable' errors
some of the time.  (Not always, perhaps, that is why I had the messed up
routing table, allthough messed up routing or not I was still able to
connect to other hosts)

For a e2fs use:
        mount -t ext2 /dev/_your_hd_ /mnt

Then you have to create the symbolic link in /mnt/lib:
        ln -s libc.so.4.4.2 lib.so.4
(The exact version # depends on that what comes with SLS)

Now everything should work fine.

Subject: Pb after installing SLS
Date: 22 Oct 1993 08:34:09 -0400

Hello everyone,

        I'm having a problem after a full install of the latest
tsx-11.mit.edu SLS release.

        If I try booting off the HD it gives the L and then the I
and freezes.

        If I try booting off the FD it goes almost to the end
(it would be with .99 pl9-1) and finally sends the following error
message :
                init: can't load library /libc.so.4
                        No such library.

        Now the install goes great from start to finish.

        Now I found a /usr/lib/libc.so.1 file and copied the file
to /usr/lib/libc.so.4.  It did something for the Floppy boot, but it
aint great, now I can't make out what it says.  The HD boot procedure
gives the same thing.

        Anybody knows about this ?

        Did I get SLS, while they where upgrading it and got mixed
version floppies ? (Nothing anywhere points to that)

        Should I re-install for the 4th time ?

        I did install .99pl9-1 from SLS and didn't get that problem
earlier this year, so I think I know a little bit what I'm doing.  But
now I'm confused.   HELP...  This has been dragging for a small while
and I have to boot off my DOS floppy now.

Thanks in advance,

- Richard

What difference does this make?  I've had no problems with the "foo"
installation.  Is the "Linus&net" flag built into the generic GNU
distribution, or are you speaking of a specific port at some site?  To
wit, the etc/MACHINES file from prep says

    Intel 386 (i386-*-isc,          i386-*-esix,
               i386-*-xenix,        i386-*-linux,
               [...]
    
      In the above configurations, * means that the manufacturer's name
      you specify does not matter, and you can use any name you like
      (but it should not contain any dashes).

as I'm sure you're aware.  So what extras does "Linus&net" buy me?

Also, are you sure you mean "Linus" and not "Linux"?

Hello all!

Well things are pretty much great:  Linux 0.99.13, libs 4.4.4, 
Xfree 1.2, Networking, its all fallen together quite gracefully...
THANKS to everyone who has made it possible.

Now if I could just take care of these last few problems, I could 
get back to my research:

1       I can't access NFS mounts.  I have no problem mounting 
the directory, but when I look inside, nothing is there; I also 
can't cat to a file in the directory (I get a permissions error).  
I have read TCP/IP Net. Admin. and man pages on both my Linux and 
the server's SUN.  Nowhere is it mentioned how to mount a remote 
directory into a local users directory, WITH read-write permissions 
for the local user.  Does the local user have to have the same UID 
as his account on the server?  If anyone can point to docs, I would 
appreciate it.

2       Actually this is just a question:  _TCP/IP_N_A_ mentions 
the biod, lockd, and statd  daemons that run on the client machines.  
I can't find them.  My rc.inet2 just mounts all the nfs filesystems 
as its first order of business.  What's UP?  Once again a pointer 
to docs would be a great help.

3       A distinct problem with ftp:  It doesn't seem to look in the 
file /etc/ftpusers to find out who CAN'T ftp.  Isn't this what it's 
supposed to do?  I would like to setup anonymous ftp but not until 
I get my regular ftp working alright.

Let's see.....YUP, thats it.  As I have mentioned before, docs are 
most appreciated (or pointers to); E-Mail is fine, but I also try 
to keep up with the newsgroups.

        I am as of yet unfamilar with linux (other than I know what
it is). I have heard of people running X on it, but no real opinions
about how it worked.

        What I am looking into is making a portable X-Term, by buying
a 486 laptop installing Linux and X-Windows on it, then connecting it
to the Ethernet. Does this sound at all possible?

        What I need to know if it is, is:
1)      what size HD to get? (Are there any problems with various HDs?)
2)      Are there any problems with network interface cards?
3)      What would be the preformance of such a creature?
4)      Is there a NFS for Linux?
5)      I know of one place that sells laptops with the nice palm rests,
        are there any other companies that have integrated the palm 
        rests into the design? (Palm rests like the Mac Powerbooks.)


        Please respond to my e-mail. Sorry if this is not the appropriate
newsgroup for this, please be kind and direct me to the appropriate news-

I've got CNews loaded on my system from SLS 1.02. Whenever I use the newsrun

     relaynews: recursive loop setting permissions (Bad File Number)
(Sometimes it's not "setting permissions", but it's always the same. I can
force the error if I run setnewsids.

After this, if I check /usr/spool/news/in.coming, al the .Z files are changed
to .Z.t.

Question: What is it trying to do, specifically? I know that setnewsids is
trying to setuid root so that it can play with the file permissions, but
_which_ files is it looking for?

Also, can someone point me to the source for cnews and the linux diffs?

Yes, it's easy to install, BUT ...

I've got one glaring problem.  Entering text requires vast amounts
of CPU power.  On my 386-33, xsysinfo shows the cpu load shooting
to the sky whenever text is typed into a Motif application.  As
a result, it's roughly equivalent to using a 300 baud modem.  I'd
really love to get this problem resolved, because otherwise it's
a fine product.

I heard this complaint recently from another poster, but I've
lost his address and he didn't respond to my reply.  I'd love
to hear other people's experience with this.  David Johnson has
told me that his 486-?? performs OK, but he's not yet checked the
system load in this situation.

You just have to talk to the right person.  You don't just dial the operator, 
and say "How do I connect to the internet?"  Asking for the "corporate" number 
is usually the first step.

If you think the local telco is bad, try calling AT&T, Sprint, or MCI without

I made a quantum jump yesterday from gcc-2.3.3, libc-4.3.3,
and 0.99pl9 to gcc-2.4.5, libc-4.4.4, and ALPHA-0.99pl13h.

I still haven't upgraded from XFree86 1.2 to 1.3, but with
2.0 around the corner it seemed like a waste.

About the only problem I'm having is that when I link an X application
statically I get a segmentation fault as soon as I try to run it.
The same application runs fine when using shared libraries.

I installed the libc image, include, and  extras; the required ld.so, 
and the newest binutils.  Does anyone know if I've  got to upgrade
to XFree86 1.3?  Other suggestions as to what the problem might
be would also be appreciated.
