PLIP is very very limited by the speed of a hardware interrupt being
taken and processed. While PLIP is transferring a packet no interrupts
occur. For any net of >2 machines use ethernet.The PLIP protocol assumes
only 2 people (per port) and the machine time hit required to process
plip packets is diabolical. PLIP is a hack for the not very rich (like me 8-))

In case anyone cares, we are seeing the same thing using BSD/386 v1.0.  If
we run with a certain debug level, the chat script is fine.  If we run with
no debugging, it fails.  This is becoming a major problem and I don't
believe has anything to do with running Linux or anything else.  It is
a problem with Taylor UUCP v1.04, which is what we are seeing the problem
with.

Any help would be appreciated.

The console uses the latin1 charset (ISO 8859-1). You can convert files
between different charsets with the utility recode (from GNU/FSF).
recode can be found on most ftp servers.

Try adding -v200 to that command line so you can see what is
really happening to the address.  It sounds to me like you have
alias or forward files that are pointing things off into space.

The following is copied from the minicom Install file:

The Linux console only maps 1-to-1 in a special mode. Therefore you need to
make a special termcap entry in /etc/termcap that initializes the
console on startup:

mc|minicom|mc80x25|termcap entry for minicom on the console:\
        :is=\E(U\E[m\E>\E[4;20l:\E[?8;25h\E[?1;5;6;7l:\
        :rs=\E(B\E[m\E>\E[4;20l:\E[?7;8;25h\E[?1;5;6l:\
        :bc=:as=:ae=:am=:vb=\E(B\007\E(U:\
        :tc=console:

To use this information instead of the normal 'console' information,
minicom has to be invoked with the '-t mc' option (meaning use TERM=mc
instead of the normal TERM environment variable).

And, in my /etc/profile I have added the lines:

        if [ "$TERM" = console ]
        then
                MINICOM="-l -con -tmc" ; export MINICOM
        fi

So when I log in on the console I can use minicom in full color full
ANSI mode to call all kinds of BBS's and the like!

I seems to me that it's not /bin/login that's the problem if
you are not asked for a password. In such a case rlogind does not invoke
/bin/login at all.

You should instead check /.rhosts and /etc/hosts.equiv on the linux
machine, they may be too permissive.

Subject: SLS1.3 local TCP setup HELP!
Date: 2 Nov 93 11:38:48 GMT

I know that this question comes up again and again and I read the net.faq
but it's driving me crazy that there's never a detailed description of HOW 
TO SETUP A LOCAL TCP ENVIRONMENT (no nameserver, no other networks, no
ethernetards, di nada). 

I temporarily "solved" the problem by just putting my local host behind the
127.0.0.1 local 
entry in /etc/hosts, but meanwhile this put me into some trouble (programs 
needing another address than 127.0.0.1, rcmd complains about socket permission
denied (even as root)) so I would like to have a proper 
setup. I know that with SLS 1.2 the whole setup worked perfect from
the beginning. 

Could someone do me the favor and either post or mail me his _working_
local version of /etc/rc.net /etc/hosts etc?

Thank you very much in advance!!!

When you're logging in to a heavenly in use linux machine, and login
times out, and you login immediately again, you get the last input 
of the previous timed-out user. This means that if the last user
timed out AFTER typing his password, the next user SEES that password

Kinda an unwanted feature I guess........

Sorry, but you've misunderstood me. I have NO .rhosts for root on the
linux box, and if I TELNET onto the linux box as myself and then execute
su - I AM asked for the root password. I also have no .rhosts entry for root
at any machine in my account so when I rlogin in from being root I AM asked
for a password. rlogind executes login to get the password and thence my 
uid/gid is 0 and euid is my uid. 

The problem was cured by going back to my old login for which I have no source.
