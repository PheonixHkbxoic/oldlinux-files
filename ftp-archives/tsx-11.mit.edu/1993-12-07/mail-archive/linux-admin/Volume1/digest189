There definitely must be. We are on quite a busy network and have experienced
three different problems that must be caused by something "coming from outside":

- Heaps of portmappers get started for no apparent reason.  

- Heaps of popd processes. I think this is caused by Macintoshes running the
Eudora POPmail client, since I traced the machines trying to connect and they were
without exeption MACs.  

- From time to time there are tons of the following message: 

ARP: ARPing my own IP address 127.0.0.1 ! 

This means that either something is really sending out ARPs for 127.0.0.1 or the
kernel is tricked into thinking so. This always occurs in bursts, so I think that
some machines on the net in a particular configuration are started up and cause
this.  

I have upgraded to 99pl13s as of yesterday, but we have had this problems for
all of Patchlevel 13, including 99pl13s.

I agree.  Source code is not enough.  I believe people who
release material for public consumption have a responsibilty to
document their work.

The only thing I can suggest is that you keep clear of
undocumented sofware.  Lack of documentation is often an
indication of poorly conceived and executed work.  

The problem with lack of documentation for Linux in general (and
the serial driver in particular) is that the code is based on
documentation for BSD-ish systems (SunOS, SysVR4) or Posix.  This
documentation is readily available to the developers but can't be
released with the code since it is not in the public domain(?).

In any case... the following explanation is taken from the
README.linux file from mgetty_ps.  It should give you an idea of
how it's meant to work.  Also, if you have access to, for
example, SunOS documentation (man 4 zs) you'll find that other
cua devices work in a similar way.

========================================================================

1.  NEW SERIAL DRIVERS

    To many people's surprise (and a few people's disgust), the serial
    drivers have been upgraded.  The basic idea behind the new drivers
    is that callin and callout devices should not try to use the same
    line at the same time.  In the past, this was accomplished by jug-
     gling lockfiles.  The new scheme takes care of the problem in the
    kernel.  Instead of one modem device, there are now two: a callin
    device, named /dev/ttyS# (where # is the port number), and a call-
    out device, named /dev/cua# (again, # = port number).  The callin
    devices are used by programs like getty; the callout devices are
    used by programs like Seyon and Kermit.  If you don't have the
    callout devices in /dev, you create them with the mknod command.
    They are character devices, major number 5, minor number same as
    the corresponding callin device.

    So how does it work?  Simple...

    Suppose that kermit wants to open /dev/cua1 for a callout session.
    The kernel allows the line to be open if and only if no other
    program currently has the corresponding /dev/ttyS1 line open; if
    it does, the error EBUSY is returned in errno.  

    The /dev/ttyS1 line is a bit more complicated.  By default, the device
    'blocks' on open.  This means that the program will be stopped until
    the device is clear to open.  For the device to be clear, two things
    must be true:  no process can be using the corresponding /dev/cua1
    line, and the carrier detect line of the serial port must be high.
    While the device is blocking, it is not busy, so callout devices can
    use the line.  In other words, if getty is running on /dev/ttyS1, as
    long as no incoming calls open the line (causing the carrier to go
    high), other programs are free to use the line.  Blocking can be dis-
    abled by setting the O_NDELAY flag to the open system call.  In this 
    case, carrier detect is not needed to open the line; however, if 
    /dev/ttyS1 is busy, EBUSY is still returned in errno and the open fails.

    So... why didn't getty_ps work with this?  Getty_ps opened the line with
    the O_NDELAY flag set to do modem initialization and wait for RING to
    come over the line.  By doing this, the device is always busy, and any
    other program trying to use the line is not allowed.  This behaviour
    is the major change in the getty_ps package.

Subject: Taylor UUCP 1.04 fails EAGAIN on 0.99.12
Date: Fri, 26 Nov 1993 21:24:24 GMT

I can't establish an outdial connection to any of my Dialers with
either cu or uucico.  For example, cu SYSTEM will print the
"Connected" message, then the first 10 or so characters of the remote
login prompt.  (I assume that those characters are printed by the
flush code before the child process gets control.)  The child process
does its read() from the modem and returns -1 with errno=EAGAIN, and
at the same time, DTR drops.

The symptoms are the same no matter what system I dial.  But if I
bypass the chat script with cu -l /dev/cua1 and dial manually instead,
there's no problem.  I get the entire login prompt, and log in without
losing DTR.  Of course that's no use, since I'm really trying to get
uucico working, not interactive logins.

The difficulty with uucico is similar.  The Dialers chat script work
fine, but the Systems chat script dies right off with EAGAIN.

Any insight would be appreciated, because I've been deep into the UUCP
code and the terminal driver without any results.

Most any SCSI drive will work with LINUX distributions.  I have an
Archive 4mm DAT, but any of the 6150 drives also work well.  I'm not
fond of the DC2000 series tapes because of the DMA problems with the
floppy drive controller, Nevertheless many LINUXers use them anyway
with moderate success (Anyone want to buy a Mountain Mach II
controller and streamer?).

But hey, as cheap as large SCSI drives are getting, you could almost buy
a spare external SCSI drive and just mount it periodically when you need
to backup.  ;-)  Of course this wouldn't apply if you were doing serious
LINUX development work or needed to archive mounds of data.

Good luck with your decision.

Date: Sat, 27 Nov 1993 01:47:07 GMT

I have one DOS partition on my IDE hard drive (/dev/hda1), and I have
a SCSI drive with several partitions, Linux root on /dev/sda1.  From
reading the LILO docs it seemed my only chance was to put lilo in the
MBR of the IDE drive.  Unfortunately, lilo only gets to the `L' stage
and then the machine hangs.  I'm running the Yggdrasil LGX F93, but I
have also tried the lilo on the TransAmeritech CD.  No luck with
either.  I restored the original MBR with dd, but I'm left booting
linux from floppy (ugh).  Does anybody have any suggestions about how
to proceed?

Date: Sat, 27 Nov 1993 02:07:03 GMT


I'm running the Yggdrasil LGX F93 kernel, and any attempt to use
/dev/cua1 (including to run setserial) results in "Device or resource
busy".  (Ditto /dev/ttyS1, unsurprisingly.)  I have a mouse on com1
(/dev/cua0), and I can use kermit to connect to the mouse and see
gibberish at 1200baud when I move it.  I have an external modem on
com2.

I checked the serial-FAQ, but didn't get far:
  -- there are no getty processes on the serial line, just on tty[1-4]
     (my four virtual consoles).  I checked both inittab and `ps aux`
  -- the FAQ suggests remaking the kernel, but I tried that and the
     kernel sources as distributed won't build.

I have an SMC Ethernet card plugged into the system that I have never
used.  Could it be causing the problem?  If so, is there a cure other
than ripping it out?  

Can anyone suggest any other cures?  My linux box is pretty useless if
I can't talk to the world...

No.  While this lets users create files in /tmp as required, it also
allows users to delete eachother's files.  Instead, /tmp should have the
sticky bit set so that users can't delete files they don't own unless they
own the directory (which they don't).

Change the protection of /tmp to 1777.

This is more a general unix programming question, and as such, has been
redirected into comp.unix.programmer.  If you want to look into 
socket program, I would suggest the book Unix Network Programming,
by W. Richard Stevens, it's an excellent book, and while I was familiar
with network programming before I got it, I've found it to be an
invaluable reference tool.
