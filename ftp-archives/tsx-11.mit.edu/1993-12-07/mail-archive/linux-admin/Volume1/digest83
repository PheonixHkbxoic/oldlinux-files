Subject: SLS (Softlanding Linux System) 
Status: O

The new version of SLS (Softlanding Linux System) is now available on tsx-11.  

Features of this upgrade include:

 - Network installation from 3.5" disks
 - Linux 99 alpha p12
 - libc 4.4.1 and gcc 2.4.5
 - net 2 support
 - XFree 386 1.3 (with shadow xlock and xdm)
 - Tcl/Tk  (this replaces the IV libs)
 - rebuilt versions of idraw and doc
 - First cut of Windows3 API (based on Tk)
 - mailx
 - Quotas
 - Eric Youngdale's ELF support for SVR4 binaries
 - national video font support
 - the new mitsumi driver
 - ifs and loop fs
 - selection
 - clean up of man pages and duplicate binaries, etc
 - fixed version of bash
 - enhanced installation

Also a set of boot time configuration options have been to the kernel, such 
as forcing the hard drive params (for PS/VP) and forcing the net card,
and busmouse params.  The install program automatically sets up lilo
with these parameters at install time.  Lilo now uses the root partition 
rather than the boot partition.

The SLS install program, doinstall, now fully automates installs, including
setting up swap, running "fdisk", and using "mke2fs" automatically, if you
omit the parameters.

The syssetup script has been extended so that it now sets up your tcpip
for your hostname, ipaddr, nameserver, etc.  Mail is now setup with
this info, for internet based nodes.

Subject: Debian Channel Created
Organization: The Debian Project
Keywords: debian distribution development mail list channel
Status: RO

I'd like to announce the creation of the DEBIAN channel on the linux-activists
mailing list.  To join, send mail to linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi
with the following as the first line of the message body: 

        X-Mn-Admin: join DEBIAN

For further instructions on using the mailing list please refer to the Linux
FAQ.

What is "Debian", anyway?
=========================

Debian is a brand-new kind of Linux distribution.  Instead of being developed
by one isolated individual or group, Debian will be developed by its *users*
in the tradition of the Linux kernel and other critical components of the
Linux system.  In this way I hope that it will eventually develop into a
powerful yet flexible product just as Linux in general has done under the
same development philosophy.

Debian Linux is currently in ALPHA.  It is not yet available in a public
location; however, if you feel your contributions could include early testing
and improvement, then I invite you to join the DEBIAN channel and then
to mail me for the location of the distribution.  Please mail me at
imurdock@shell.portal.com with a subject of "request", and include in the
body of the message a brief description of what you have to offer the Debian
project at this early stage.  If I tell you where to find Debian Linux before
it is released publically, then I *will* expect you to participate.  Do *not*
think of this as a way to get the distribution before anyone else. 
 
I invite all interested to join the channel and become a part of the Debian
project.  As soon as Debian is made publically available the channel will
become the center of communications for the project: bug reports, discussion
concerning developing and improving the distribution and the organizational
center of development in general.

For the latest Debian Linux announcements, finger imurdock@sage.cc.purdue.edu.

Thanks,

Subject: MCC Interim Linux
Status: RO

Introduction
************

The MCC interim versions of Linux are designed to allow people who
are not Unix experts to install a version of the Linux operating system
on a PC.  The installed system should be self-contained, but easy to
extend.


What are the MCC interim versions of Linux?
===========================================

When Linux version 0.10 first appeared in the autumn of 1991, it was
released by Linus Torvalds as a pair of floppy disks, known as the
"boot" and "root" disks.  Linus himself released several utilities
which did not fit on these disks.  Eventually quite a number of
contributions were available.  Software distribution was rather
chaotic, and you needed a lot of effort to collect a complete base
system.

The Manchester Computing Centre (MCC) is a part of the University of
Manchester, supporting computing at the University, at UMIST (the
University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology), and at
several other British universities.

We began to make Linux available by anonymous ftp in November 1991,
and we released the first MCC interim version of Linux (version 0.12+)
the following February.  This version made use of ramdisk code written
by Theodore Ts'o to mount a virtual root disk at boot time from the
kernel floppy.  (This type of distribution was used earlier by Andrew
Tannenbaum to distribute his operating system MINIX.)  With version
0.99p8+, we abandoned the ramdisk-as-root and adopted a combined
bootable root disk.  The first combined root disk was created by H J Lu
(who made essential use of Werner Almesberger's LILO software).  Unlike
H J's bootable root disk, the MCC disk does not contain an executable
shell.

Very shortly after the first MCC interim version of Linux appeared,
other people released similar versions: Dave Safford's TAMU releases
and Martin Junius's MJ versions were eventually followed by Peter
Macdonald's massive, comprehensive SLS releases and H J Lu's small base
systems.  What distinguishes the MCC versions from these others?

Since its first release, MCC interim Linux has included basic
utilities, the GNU C compiler, and the sources to the current kernel
release.  The software included in MCC distributions comes from a wide
variety of sources, but we try to make sources to all of it available,
though not as part of the distribution.  MCC interim versions aim to
provide a stable base system, which can be installed in a short time,
and to which other software can be added with relatively little effort.
Every binary file in an MCC distribution has been compiled under that
version of the kernel, by that version of `gcc', is linked with that
version of the libraries, and has been tested to some extent.  The only
exception to this is the GNU C compiler and libraries, which we take
directly from H J Lu's distribution.

We install this version of Linux on small 386-SX machines for our C
and Unix courses, and we need to be able to install it on twelve
machines in about one hour.  We also distribute this version of Linux
to our clients in Manchester.  We make no attempt to include a wide
variety of packages, or large packages such as X386.  The emacs and
info packages were added to MCC interim Linux only because we have been
using them for our courses.  People who want a distribution which
contains nearly everything should get the SLS versions, which are about
five times the size of MCC, and quite comprehensive.

Our versions are called "interim" because they are not intended to be
final or official.  They are small, harmonious, and moderately tested.
They do not conform to everyone's taste -- what release does? -- but
they should provide a stable base to which other software can be added.

This version of Linux is prepared to allow you to upgrade an existing
system, as well as to install a complete new system.  The limitations
are mainly that partitions must contain minix or ext2 file systems: ext
and xiafs file systems are not supported in the installation, though
they can be mounted from the installed system with no difficulty.
Upgrading an old system looks just like installing a new system, except
that you don't need to run `mkswap' and `mkfs' before installing.
Instead you should run `fsck', which you can do from the boot disk.
Old binaries are deleted, except for some old libraries, which may be
required by programs which you have acquired from somewhere else.

Text files, especially the configuration files in `/etc', are more
of a problem.  We don't want to throw away the old files, which you may
have spent some considerable time polishing, but we must install new
configuration files, or else the system may not boot properly, or may
work badly if it boots at all.  For this reason, the installation
creates a special directory named `/backupdirs'.  In this directory it
creates subdirectories such as `etc', `etc/lilo', `root', and
`home/user'.  Any old configuration files which might be overwritten
during the upgrade are moved to these directories before the new files
are installed.  After installation, you may cautiously compare the new
files with the old ones, and incorporate your personal preferences into
the new files.

You must be particularly careful with files such as `/etc/inittab'
or `/etc/rc', since mistakes in these may prevent the system from
booting, or cause serious problems while the system is running.  It is
a good idea to read the man pages for `init' and `inittab' before
making any changes to these files.  A number of other `rc' files are
created in `/etc' during the installation; these are described to some
extent in `/etc/inittab'.  See README.adapt


Copyright and conditions of distribution
========================================

Software today comes under a wide variety of copyright restrictions,
and it is important to know what conditions apply to the software you
use.  The software in MCC interim versions of Linux, and other software
which can be added to it, is copyrighted in a variety of ways.  In
general, all of it is available to be used by anyone, and the source to
all of it is available as well.  If you intend to use Linux or any of
its parts for commercial purposes, you should get the source files and
read the copyrights contained in them.  (A list of the sources can be
found in Acknowledgments.)  Most Linux software falls under one
of the following categories:

GNU copyleft
     The GNU General Public License applies to the Linux kernel, to the
     GNU C and C++ compilers, to all utilities distributed by the Free
     Software Foundation, and to many contributed utilities.  This
     copyright, also known as a copyleft, is designed to ensure that
     the source to software is available, and that you can give away or
     sell copies of the source and of compiled binaries.  There is no
     warranty, but you are obliged to notify anyone of any changes
     which you have made to the original.  You are obliged to publish
     on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and a disclaimer of
     warranty.  Works derived from copylefted works must be released
     under the same terms.  The terms are specified in the GNU General
     Public License, which is available by anonymous ftp.  See
     README.ftp

GNU library license
     The GNU library license applies to the GNU C++ library and to all
     works that must be linked with this library.  This allows
     commercial binaries to be supplied in an unlinked form, so that
     purchasers can link the binaries with other versions of the
     library.

BSD copyright
     The BSD copyright applies to all source from the University of
     California at Berkeley.  Source may be reused freely, but it
     should contain a notice to the effect that all or part of the
     software was developed by the University of California at
     Berkeley.  Moreover, the name of the University may not be used to
     endorse or promote such products.

MIT copyright
     The X Window System, version 11, is copyrighted by the
     Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and `X Window System' is a
     trademark owned by MIT.  Most of the source for this software was
     developed by the MIT X Consortium, and is covered by the MIT
     copyright.  This is similar to the BSD copyright in permitting
     free commercial use of MIT code, subject to the inclusion of
     similar notices giving credit for any MIT code used in the final
     product.

Public domain software
     Some programs in this distribution are in the public domain.  They
     have no copyright attached and can be used in any way without any
     obligation or restriction.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                                       18 February 1993

        Yggdrasil Computing, Incorporated is now shipping a beta CDROM
release of a bootable Linux/GNU/X-based UNIX(R) clone for PC
compatibles, tentatively named LGX.  The system uses version 0.99.5 of the
Linux kernel, which is being developed from scratch by Linus Torvalds
and an international group of skilled contributors working over the
internet to complete the GNU project.

        LGX beta is the first PC UNIX(R) clone to include multimedia
facilities as part of its base configuration.  The beta release also
features X-windows, networking, a complete source tree (including X
windows and TeX), a demonstration facility, an easy installation
mechanism, and the ability to run directly from the CDROM.

        Some of the otherwise unused space on the CDROM has been used
to distribute other interesting software.  On the beta release, this
space holds a copy of the X11R5 MIT contrib tree with an updated
version of the Andrew multimedia system.  Future releases will include
different things in the otherwise unused CDROM space.

        The LGX beta CDROM is in standard ISO-9660 format with
Rockridge extensions, so it can easily be browsed from other types of
computers or other operating systems.

CONTENTS OF THE BETA RELEASE

        Almost every piece of software on the distribution has been
updated since the previous December 8th alpha release.  The 34,557
files on this plug-and-play CDROM include:

    SOURCE CODE
        o  Complete source tree, including X (with Xfree86 1.1
           code) and TeX sources.  You cannot yet do a complete
           build from the top of this tree, but you should be able
           to easily find the source code for any binary on the CD.
        o SPECIAL FOR THE BETA RELEASE: the complete X11R5 MIT contrib
          tree with the Andrew 5.0 tree replaced by a snapshot of an
          Andrew 5.1 tree in the process of being ported to Linux
          (this is not automatically installed as part of any
          installation, but it makes the CD useful for reference even
          after the beta release has been superseded),

    USER INTERFACE FACILITIES: X-WINDOWS AND MULTIMEDIA
        o  X windows (X11R5) for S3, 8514/A and VGA displays using
           ET4000, ET3000, Paradise, Trident 8900c, Genoa, or
           ATI VGA Wonder chipsets.  (NOTE: due to trade secrecy
           Diamond Stealth is not supported),
        o  The full motion video (MPEG) viewer from Professor
           Larry Rowe's research group at UC Berkeley.
        o  Sound players and Hannu Savolainen's drivers for the
           AdLib, SoundBlaster 1.0-2.0 (and compatibles including
           ThunderBoard and Ati Stereo F/X), SoundBlaster Pro,
           and ProAudioSpectrum 16.  (ProAudioSpectrum+ is not
           supported yet.  The original ProAudioSpectrum is not
           supported nor is it likely to be supported the near
           future.)
        o  CD audio support,
        o  Tcl, Tk, wish and expect.  Tcl is a scripting language
           ("tool command language") written by Professor
           John Ousterhout at UC Berkeley.  Tk is a toolkit that
           allows one to quickly write X-windows programs in Tcl.
           Wish is a Tk/Tcl interpretter.  The beta distribution
           includes versions of wish with support for "drag and drop"
           applications, and compound documents and hypertext.  Expect
           is a system written in Tcl by Don Libes that "performs
           programmed dialogue with other interactive programs."

    ETHERNET NETWORKING: TCP/IP and NFS
        o simple installation script,
        o clients: finger, ftp, nslookup and its cousins, ping, rcp,
          rlogin, rsh, talk, telnet, tftp.
        o daemons: fingerd, ftpd, inetd, ntalkd, rshd, telnetd, tftpd,

Subject: Getting MCC Interim Linux
Status: O

There are two ways at present by which you can get a copy of MCC
interim versions of Linux: by anonymous ftp, and by visiting MCC.  The
latter method is available as a service only for students and members
of staff of the University of Manchester and of UMIST.


Getting MCC interim Linux by anonymous ftp
==========================================

MCC interim versions of Linux are released on ftp.mcc.ac.uk
[130.88.203.12] in the directory `/pub/linux/mcc-interim'.  In this
directory there are subdirectories `dos-utils', which contains some
commands which you may need if you install Linux from DOS, `0.99.p10+',
which contains the current release, and `old', which contains one or
more older releases.  The current MCC release is also available from
sunsite.unc.edu [152.2.22.81] in the directory
`/pub/Linux/distributions/MCC', and also from nic.funet.fi
[128.214.6.100] in `/pub/OS/Linux/images/MCC-interim'.  Other sites
sometimes maintain mirrors of the current MCC distribution.

The directory `0.99.p10+' contains the current `README' files and
the file `BUGS+WARNINGS', which contain important information.  (The
contents of all of these files have been incorporated into the present
document.)  It also contains the following subdirectories:

`images'
     This contains the gzipped image of the bootable root disk.  `gzip'
     is the GNU compression utility.

`packages'
     This contains the packages which are optional parts of the MCC
     interim distribution.

`extra_kernels'
     This contains additional kernels which may be installed as if they
     were packages.  You should not install more than one of these
     kernels.  They contain no support for SCSI or XT disks, and one of
     them contain no support for NFS or networking.  All three MCC
     kernels contain maths coprocessor emulation code, and support for
     IDE hard disks and for the minix, ext2, msdos, and proc file
     systems.

    boot
          SCSI, XT, NFS, networking.

    ide
          No SCSI, no XT, no NFS, no networking.

    ipide
          No SCSI, no XT, networking and NFS support.

`extra_packages'
     This contains packages which for one reason or another have a
     secondary status.

    emacs,
    elisp
          contain a cut-down version of the `emacs' editor, which we
          use in our courses at the Computer Centre.  A more complete
          version, which is compiled with support for X windows, is
          available by anonymous ftp.

    locinf
          contains info files which I did not wish to include in the
          main distribution; these describe `gcc' and how to port it,
          `cpp', some of the odder parts of `emacs', and other subjects.

    manpages
          contains unformatted manual pages.  The formatted pages are
          all that most people need, and they are already contained in
          the other packages.

    maps
          contains the available keyboard maps.  It is not needed for
          US or for UK keyboard maps, which are included in the base
          package on the root disk.

    patches
          contains the patches which, when applied to the corresponding
          source files, produce the sources compiled in the current
          release.

`source_files'
     This contains the source files which were used to compile all
     binaries in the current distribution.

After you decide what you need, you may transfer those files in
binary mode to any machine which supports ftp.  The bootable root disk
must be gunzipped and copied to a high density floppy disk, either 3.5
inch 1.44 Mb or 5.25 inch 1.2 Mb, of the sort which can be used to boot
the PC on which you intend to install or upgrade Linux.  If you have a
Linux system which you are upgrading, you may put a formatted floppy
into your 0 drive (which DOS calls `A:') and give these commands:

     fdformat /dev/fd0H1440                 (for 3.5 inch disks)
     fdformat /dev/fd0h1200                 (for 5.25 inch disks)
     gunzip boot-uk.z
     dd if=boot-uk of=/dev/fd0 bs=18432     (for 3.5 inch disks)
     dd if=boot-uk of=/dev/fd0 bs=15360     (for 5.25 inch disks)

If you are installing Linux on a machine which already contains a
version of Linux, you may wish to put the MCC packages in a directory
in the existing file system.  MCC interim versions at present support
only the minix and ext2 file systems.  The kernel will not allow you to
mount older ext or xiafs file systems.  The packages you wish to
install should be in a single directory, and they must have the same
file names (in lower case) as they do in the MCC distribution
directory.  You may put all the packages in a DOS directory on the same
machine, or you may copy them to floppies.  The MCC interim
distribution prefers DOS-format floppies, though minix or ext2 floppies
will work as well.  DOS format floppies will hold more, and will not
produce spurious error messages during installation.

If you are installing from DOS, you need commands which will gunzip
the disk image and copy it to a disk.  The commands `GZIP.EXE',
`RAWRITE.EXE', and `RAWRITE3.COM' can be found at `ftp.mcc.ac.uk' in
the directory `/pub/linux/mcc-interim/dos-utils'.  Transfer
`GZIPxxx.EXE' and one of the `RAWRITE' commands in binary mode.  (The
version number `xxx' is currently 123.) The command `GZIPxxx.EXE' is a
self-unpacking archive, which creates `GZIP.EXE' and a documentation
file.  Documentation for the two `RAWRITE' commands can be found in the
`dos-utils' directory with the commands; you should normally transfer
documentation files in text mode.  After unpacking `GZIP.EXE', you
should give the following commands:

     FORMAT A:
     GZIP -D BOOT.GZ
     RAWRITE
     Enter source file name: BOOT
     Enter destination drive: A:
     Please insert a formatted diskette into drive A: and press -ENTER- :

The program `RAWRITE3' is screen-oriented, and may work rather
faster than the older `RAWRITE'.

If you are installing Linux on a system which already contains a DOS
partition, you may find it convenient to put MCC packages in a single
directory on that partition.  You can also copy them to DOS format
floppies.  As explained above, the file names must be the same as in
the `packages' directory, though under DOS they will, of course, be in
upper-case.  If you get all packages, they will fit on floppies as
follows:

   3.5 inch high density floppies:

       disk 1     base, flex, gpp
       disk 2     bison, gccb, info
       disk 3     gcca, gdb, gprof, kermit, tcpip
       disk 4     gawk, groff, linux, tar

   5.25 inch high density floppies:

       disk 1     base, info, tar
       disk 2     bison, gcca, groff
       disk 3     gawk, gccb, gdb
       disk 4     gpp, kermit, tcpip
       disk 5     flex, gprof, linux

In the latter case, the final disk contains enough space for one of
the extra kernels, or for anything else you wish.  In either case the
maps package fits on the final disk as well.  If you wish to get all of
the extra packages and kernels, you can fit them on floppies like this:

   3.5 inch high density floppies:

       disk 1     base, gawk, gpp
       disk 2     elisp, gcca, tar
       disk 3     gccb, info, patches
       disk 4     groff, linux
       disk 5     bison, emacs, flex, gdb
       disk 6     locinf, manpages, tcpip
       disk 7     gprof, ide, ipide, kermit, maps

   5.25 inch high density floppies:

       disk 1     base, info, tar
       disk 2     bison, gcca, groff
       disk 3     gawk, gccb, gdb
       disk 4     gprof, linux
       disk 5     gpp, kermit, ipide
       disk 6     elisp, flex, tcpip
       disk 7     emacs, ide, maps
       disk 8     locinf, manpages, patches

This system allows you to create your own packages, which can be
installed along with mine.  They must be gzipped tar files with the
extension `.tgz'.  Each package is unzipped and untarred in the root
directory.  If it contains files `install.setup' and `install.clean',
these are executed as shell scripts respectively before and after
untarring the archive.  If you wish, you may include a file
`install.info', which is copied to the screen during installation.  The
MCC packages all contain a file filename`.crc', which must have the
same basename as the `.tgz' file, and which has been generated with the
command `brik -Gb'.  If such a file exists, the installation uses it to
verify the included checksums after `install.clean' is executed.

You may omit any packages you wish.  Obviously, you cannot recompile
the kernel unless you also install gcca and gccb.  Bison, flex, gdb,
gpp, and gprof are also of little use unless gcca and gccb are
installed.

The default kernel in the boot disk contain all SCSI disk drivers
and XT disk drivers in the kernel as distributed by Linus Torvalds, as
well as networking, NFS, and kernel maths coprocessor emulation.

It is also possible to install MCC interim packages from a directory
on a remote machine which can be mounted on your Linux system using NFS.
To do this, you must have a supported Ethernet card.  You must already
have networking software installed and configured.  If necessary, you
can install the base and tcpip packages from a floppy disk, get the
networking software working, and then install other packages.


Getting MCC interim Linux from the MCC shop
===========================================

MCC interim Linux is available from the MCC shop to members of the
University of Manchester and of UMIST.  You can buy a set of diskettes
containing the bootable root disk, all the packages, and the two
optional kernels with no SCSI support.  See above in this file, where
these optional kernels are described.  You can also obtain a free copy
of the printed documentation for MCC interim Linux.

Zoological information are available for reading and open discussion. Some
of the more popular areas offer both source code and programs for many popular
computers including the IBM PC and Compatibles, Apple Computers, Sun
Workstations and many other systems.

Through our service, you may choose to receive some or all of these groups
for one low, monthly subscription rate. You choose which groups you want, and
those which you do not want. The information you receive is entirely at your
descretion and you may change your feed characteristics as often as you like.


WHAT IS REQUIRED?
=================

At a minimum, you should be capable of running the UUCP file transfer
protocol. This will be enough to allow you to receive Internet Email, although
you may want to augment your software to include more full-featured mail
programs and/or newsreading software.

To receive Usenet News, you should be running a version of Usenet News
Software. Again, if you're running Unix, you may already have the software
required to process newsfeeds, although this isn't always included on Unix
systems. Unix versions of all popular news reading and processing systems
are available on MorseNet.


WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE THE PROPER SOFTWARE?
=========================================

Versions of UUCP and Netnews software for several popular computers are
available at no charge to MorseNet subscribers. With your subscription,
you may elect to receive a starter UUCP disk for your system type. This will
enable you to establish a link to our system in order to download the Netnews
software and other utilities you might desire.

For PC's we provide FSUUCP, precompiled and ready to go. You only need 
configure it to go online. For Unix sytems, we'll send you the latest version
of Taylor UUCP, in source form, which will need to be compiled and configured
for your local system.

Please note: All utilities we offer subscribers are either public domain 
or shareware. We provide these programs as a convenience to you so that you
may get online with a minimum of fuss. Some of these programs may require
that you pay the respective authors for their continued usage. Please read
the documentation that accompanies each package for more details.

We do not sell these applications. By the same token, we don't want to
get into the habit of supporting them. However, we understand that for many
sites the initial learning curve associated with establishing UUCP links can
be considerable. Therefore, we will offer *some* assistance in order to help
you get online. Contact us if you have difficulties.


SUBSCRIPTION RATES
==================

We offer two types of subscription, with either having the option of
Internet Email or Internet Email Plus Netnews. Our rates are as follows:

Type Account            Email Only      Email & Netnews
Student (1)              $5.95/Month    $12.95/Month
Personal Account         $9.95/Month    $19.95/Month            
BBS (2)                 $19.95/Month    $39.95/Month
Corporate Account       $29.95/Month    $79.95/Month

(1) You must provide us with a photocopy or fax of a valid student
    identification card to qualify for this low rate.

(2) For BBS's with less than 500 users.


All accounts offer the same, flat-rate, no connect-charge, unlimited
amount of service. Corporate accounts allow an unlimited number of users
to access our services. To qualify for student rates, you must fax or mail
us a copy of your school identification card or other suitable documentation.


REACHING US
===========

You can connect to our computers via our direct dialup lines in the 516 area
code. In September we plan to offer additional POPs (Points of Presence) in
the 718 and 212 area codes. Service to additional areas will follow as
required.

Additionally, we are investigating several other means of communication,
including the use of either Compuserve or GTE Sprint's packet networks. This
will allow us to offer local dialup numbers in most of the country to those
sites wishing to save on telcommunications costs. 

All of our modems offer connections from 300 to 14.4/Kbps. While it is entirely
feasable to use 300 baud for Internet Email, you should bear in mind that 
Netnews volume can be substantial. You should have at least a 9600 baud or
better modem if you plan to take anything more than a token newsfeed. Most
sites receiving substantial feeds use 14.4/Kbps modems.


PLANNED UPGRADES
================

In November, we plan on installing a dedicated 56K/bps link to the Internet.
This will allow an ever quicker turnaround time on news and email than that
presently available.

Late September will see the inauguration of our MorseLink Service, dialup,
interactive Unix accounts with access to Netnews and Internet Email. The
later inclusion of Internet connectivity will add FTP, TELNET and other 
popular services to the compliment of features available. Watch for more
announcements on this exciting development. This will also be a flat-rate,
"as much as you want", type service.
