With all of the furor over SLS and all recently, I have a question as
to the differences between all of these new "distributions" going
around.

You see, when I first found out about Linux, I first just got copies
of the kernel and all of the utilities and all. I also got the little
readme file that detailed how I was supposed to run fdisk and then
mkfs and all that crap. It never did work for me.

That's why I was pleased when I found SLS, because it installed itself
for me and I was up and running. <shwing!>.

Now that there all of these competing distributions out there now, I
was curious what the difference between all of them are. The last time
I checked the faq, it just mentioned that SLS was a little easier to
install than the others of that time. 

Specifically, what are the perks offered by each of the
distributions?

Date: Tue, 14 Sep 1993 00:37:32 GMT




I checked in the new NET-2 HOWTO (howtos are a very good idea by the
way) and could not find a reference so...

Is there a PPP (Point to point) driver/solution for Linux. Here at IU
they are putting in a Xyplex terminal server that is going to support
PPP and I would like to be able to use it but I'm having no luck
finding PPP for linux. 

I have heard of someone who works (worked?) for Sun that had it
running on his home machine, so I'm pretty sure it exists.

Thanks,

Hello,
        Could someone please tell me if there is any SLIP software
that can be used with 0.99.pl9 WITHOUT patching the kernel and upping
to "NET-2."
        Also I've been to tsx and sunsite and see kernel upgrade patches
from every version to every version EXCEPT from 99.pl9 to 10 or 11.
        I really need this SLIP or PPP up and running but cannot afford
to reinstall.
        I would really appreciate any input on the best way todo this.

Hi ! It's me again. ;-)

Maybe my last posting (you know it, don't you) was a little to tough, so
please let me explain my opinion a little clearer:
I thought, these newsgroups are a forum, where people using Linux meet and 
discuss problems and so on.
And, what i can't understand, is how can someone refuse to help because
i don't use his preferred distribution of the SAME operating system.
And that, and ONLY that, "i refuse to help people plagued by SLS" is what
i wanted to call arrogant, NOTHING ELSE !!!!!!! *apologizes for that*

 And *please* believe me, SLS work 100% for me. It's true, that after
 installation you've got to fix serveral things, but i never wrote :
 "it installs perfectly".   ;-)

So please take my apologizes for misunderstandings (maybe caused by my
english), but i still believe it's better to answer "YES, I CAN HELP YOU !"
Ciao,
Stefan

No. You can only log onto the system as root if you are on the Console.

I have a terminal connected to my Linux box with a NULL modem cable.
It's no problem. The only tricky thing is to set up getty in a way
that it doesn't check the status of the control line (RING, DTR, DCD,
...). This is done either manually by stty clocal /dev/ttyS?? or by
inserting a CLOCAL in /etc/gettydefs in the appropriate line. Note
that the newer getty also uses files like /etc/default/getty.ttyS??
for individual settings.
Example: /etc/default/getty.ttyS1:

# [ put this file in /etc/default/getty.<line> ]
#
# getty configuration file for a dumb terminal

# timeout to disconnect if idle...
TIMEOUT=30

# wait for a carraige return before trying to display the /etc/issue
WAITFOR=\r

Hope this helps,

Tom.

I sent e-mail to becker@super.org, and he sent me a nice reply.  Bascially,
the Linux nfsd is not smart enough to handle 8K packet sizes like the
sun is.  That is, until linux gets packet fragmentation routines...
Becker said these routines are pretty easy to implement...

He then came up with a suggestion for me - compile up the linux nfsd
on the sun and use it instead.  Unfortunately, even though I got an
nfsd to compile, it didn't work on the sun :(  when I invoked nfsd by
hand, I got an error message: "Can't make UDP connection"  and when I
replaced the sun's nfsd with the new one, nfs stopped working altogether...

If anyone does manage to compile up a linux nfsd for sun (mine's a sun3/60),
I'd appreciate a tar archive of the source tree to it :-)

Help!
        I have recently installed / setup 0.99.9 on 3 machines 
using NE2000 cards and all is wonderful! No problems on the local
net at all.  BUT  I need to get a SLIP going and do not see that
it is included here (unless I'm missing something). I have seen
and read the "NET-2-FAQ" but was wondering if there was ANY way todo
this without all the kernel patching/installing etc.
        Is there something for 99.9? KA9Q maybe?? What is (was) used
in the past before "NET-2"???

Well not exactly true. This feature is controlled by the /etc/login.defs file.
With it you can select which devices allow root logins. So you could set it
to you modem line. Of course it's probably not a good idea. Also even if root
logins are not allowed you can su from any valid account. So preventing root
logins from the modem does not prevent root access.

Hope this helps,

You apparently know unix and stuff pretty well, don't you? You know
how to fix the glitches after installation. But other people might
not, please keep that in mind. Even though it works 100% for you,
ironing out the bugs from a system is not something that many people,
especially first-time installers coming from DOS can do. I feel that
this has taken many possible users from linux, because of the things
they should fix but have no idea how to begin.

>So please take my apologizes for misunderstandings (maybe caused by my
>english), but i still believe it's better to answer "YES, I CAN HELP YOU !"

For people like the above, I think that the original answer about not
helping people plagued by SLS *IS* exactly "YES, I CAN HELP YOU!"
It would be a long and tiring attempt to debug someone's SLS system through
the net for the helper and helped. It doesn't give one a very good picture
of linux, let me tell you. First impressions count. To really impress
someone, the system has to install and work flawlessly, without fixing
several things at the outset.

And do we want linux to impress people or not?

Ok, I'm done, I will not post any more (I hope...)

Uncomment and edit the lines in /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1. When you reboot the
net config is set up properly. Patrick has done a nice job with net setup.

Well, I went ahead with the NET-2 "howto".  I get the same "network not 
found" messages as with SLS v1.03.

Question:  What is a good, recent version of the kernel source which will
           work with the NET-2?  I would like to compile my own kernel
           and install NET-2 again.
