Several people were kind enough to e-mail me and suggest that
libc.4.4.4 and/or pl13s would supply adjtime(). I grabbed both, but
cannot find any interface routine by that name, only the kernel
internal routine sys_adjtimex. It's clear that this is set up to support

Subject: Questions concerning Passwords.
Date: Tue, 23 Nov 93 21:46:38 GMT

I understand the basics of passwords, both shadow and regular, but I
can't seem to solve a few minor problems.

First, I only want a password on the root account.  I don't need or
want passwords for the regular users.  How do I do this, short of
eliminating shadow passwords?

If I replace the appropriate binaries with non-shadow versions, what
future ramifications do I need to worry about, and what binaries do I
need to change?

Also, I added a "shutdown" user, with UID ang GID of 0, with shutdown
as it's shell, otherwise identical to the root line in passwd, but I
can't log in as shutdown.  What am I missing?

Email please, and I'll sumarize unless I'm the only one who doesn't
understand this.

Thanks to all the emailed replies, I have "reset" working fine now.

For any others who might be experiencing the same problem, here are a
couple of the various solutions that recently found their way into my
mailbox:

First, the problem is that the ^Ncharacter throws the vt100 terminal
into line drawing mode... this is what happens when garbage or a
binary flie zaps your "font".  The ^O character brings it back to
alphanumerics as usual.  So what you need to do is send a ^O to the
screen to fix things.  This can be done in a few ways.


The method I chose was to edit my /usr/bin/reset shell script, and at
the end of the file, I added an "echo ^O". That's the control-char not
a caret next to an O.  The way one does this in "vi" (or clones) is to
hit the ^V and then ^O.  The control-V tells vi that the next
character should be inserted into the file "verbatim", and not acted
upon.  You hit the ^V while you are IN the insert mode, too.

So the keystrokes to make this mod are (from the beginning of a new
line, in command mode):  Iecho ^V^O[ESC]

BTW, one of the email respondents to my post said he liked to execute
this same sort of command from "more" (or less) by typing the !
command to send a command to the shell, as in !echo ^V^O  .  He said
that this didn't clear the screen like reset does, which is true.  So
I also commented out the line in /usr/bin/reset that clears the
screen.  Thanks for that idea, too!

The other way to get your chars back, if you don't want "reset" to
stty all those things on your session, is to write a very simple C
program that contains the line "putchar(15);".  15 is apparently the
decimal code for ^O.

Soaking your monitor in an HCI solution to remove deposits is NOT a
good way to fix this problem! :)


Thanks to all who responded!


(Now all I need is someone to help me decipher the docs on setting
Xconfig values)   hehehe

Subject: [Q]: Is /etc/group supposed to have split lines?
Date: Tue, 23 Nov 1993 03:18:17 GMT

I have using the shadow password library that came with Linux. I updated
it once but have no idea what the version number is.

I have a UNIX question. If the /etc/group file suppose to have broken group
lines? This is what I mean:

group:*:user1,user2,user3,user4,....user100,\
user101,user102....

I have about 100 users or so on my system. The above has started to occur
due to the way the shadow password library is written. The lines are broken
as above. This is all fine and dandy, however, the shared libraries don't
seem to be written to handle this in the same fashion. When the split lines
occur, the group file is rendered useless and permissions become listed by
ls as numbers. This causes ALL KINDS of other problems effectively not
letting users on the system.

For the moment, I am using the vi to join the lines back together. I would
like to know if this is a bug in the shadow password library (which I can
fix very easily) or a bug in the shared libraries that handle the group
file. 

Anyone?

        There are two solutions:
1)  change your zImage with rdev ( with option -R, if I remember well, check your man on rdev ):
        rdev -R /zImage 1
2) add to your /etc/lilo/config string
                READ-ONLY
        after
                root= ...
Run lilo again. Reboot. Reboot again ( of course with sync;reboot );

pretty close...  but echo sends a newline after the +++ character sequence.
try this:

        sleep 1; printf +++ > /dev/modem; sleep 1; echo ATH0 > /dev/modem

or, if echo worked correctly, which is doesn't (to the way *I'm* used to...
not necessarily the way it should be...):

Hi, all!  Remember my dire post on emacs swallowing up the ^S and ^Q
characters when I was modemming into my school and telnetting into my
Internet-connected Linux box via our school's terminal servers?  I
struggled with this for weeks.  Well, I finally came to a solution,
thanks to Charles Hedrick, who recognized this problem and went to
great lengths to fix the many original coding errors which caused it.
I'm including my notes on how to use his patches to recompile a new
telnetd daemon so Emacs/Mg/others will work.

Thanks to all those who responded, but especially those who
recognized this as a legitimate bug, and not my general incompetence.

Let me know your experiences. Believe me, I want to know if doing it
this way does not work for you, so I can change the directions and
save others time, too.  My e-mail address is jstern@eclectic.ss.uci.edu.

By the way, I only had this problem with CISCO terminal servers.
Granted, the problem *was* with Linux, but telnetting into my Linux
box from elsewhere did not create these problems.  I played with the
debugging reports for days, and even had some of our support staff here
at UCI volunteer their time to look at it (thanks, Mike Richey! :)

Since the original bugs had to do with telnet protocol negotiation and
switching of flow control flags, it is highly likely that CISCO
servers negotiate TELNET protocol slightly differently, and that this
is what made the difference in my case.

Which brings me to a lesson I picked up about human (or at least
North American) behavior:

This is what is called in statistics an 'interactional' problem:
Linux works fine *most* of the time (which is why most of you haven't
noticed this bug).  The CISCO servers work fine *most* of the time,
(which is why our support staff here at UCI had not heard of the
problem). But when Linux and a CISCO terminal server interact, they do
not successfully negotiate flow control.  Interactional problems are
inherently difficult to diagnose (some day I'll write a book,
co-authored by Clifford Stoll: Cuckoo's Egg II).  I think we as humans
prefer single-cause problems. 

Please let me know if you had a similar experience.  For reference, I
was working with SLS 0.99pl12.  Do all this as root, of course..

HOW TO REVIVE ^S/^Q IN EMACS/MG/ETC. WHEN TELNETTING INTO A LINUX BOX:
======================================================================

Basically, this fix involves applying the patches from Charles to the
ancestral headers used to build telnetd, and then recompiling telnetd.

============
1) Get these two distributions from tsx-11.mit.edu:

   a) /pub/linux/packages/net/net2/sources/telnet/telnet-552.tar.z
         (for the patches which fix this problem)
   b) /pub/linux/packages/net/new-net2/telnet-rlogin.tar.z
         (for telnetd source, if you do not have it in your
          /usr/src/net-src/telnet directory, or if, as in my
          case, it would not compile)

Doesn't matter where you untar them, though in the end, the contents
of the first ended up for me in /usr/src/net-src/telnet, and the
second ended up in /usr/src/net-src/export.

2) Untar them with tar -xvf <filename>

3) Read the README file from Charles Hedrick in the export directory.
Apply the patches with chr_drv.diff and termios.diff as he's said to.

3a) I'm not sure whether there are other programs (besides telnetd) which
these header files (which the diff files apply to) affect, so I went
ahead and recompiled my kernel, too (including the make clean
command). You may have success without this step.  I don't know enough
about where these headers are used.

4) After applying the patches from telnet-rlogin.tar.z, then go to the
telnet-552.tar.z source, and recompile telnetd (since it will be using
the header files you've just patched.)  I believe it expects to run
from the termcap file, though I took out the -DTERMCAP flag in the
Linux section of the Config.generic file, so as to run from terminfo,
which I prefer.  Your choice, here.  (Warning, I believe telnetd will
still compile if you take out this flag, but telnet will not. I didn't
care. Telnet was not broken, so I didn't need a new one.)

5) cp /etc/telnetd /etc/telnetd.old

6) cp telnetd /etc/telnetd
       ^---the one you've just made.

7) PLAN A:
   Comment out your old telnet line in /etc/inetd.conf and replace with:

   telnet       stream  tcp     nowait  root    /etc/telnetd    telnetd

   PLAN B:
   (The above does, of course, bypass security lockouts via hosts.deny and
   hosts.allow via /usr/etc/tcpd, but I do not lock out specific machines
   anyway.  If you wanted to keep your old tcpd format, you could
   probably use this line instead, but I haven't tried it:

   telnet       stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/etc/tcpd   in.telnetd

   This is in fact the way that SLS is shipped, I believe.  Just remember
   that if you keep it this way, use the in.telnetd that comes with SLS,
   don't use Charles': His in.telnetd *includes* telnetd in it, instead
   of *calling* another telnetd.  This is, I believe, non-standard. Thus,
   if you used Charles' in.telnetd (the one from telnetd-rlogin.tar.z)
   what would happen is you would not end up calling the telnetd from
   Pete's distribution (telnet-552.tar.z) which you just compiled and
   copied over.  I know, it's wierd, but Charles himself recommends that
   you not use his in.telnetd, to just apply the patches he gives you in
   steps 1) and 2) of the README, but to use Pete's telnetd, since it
   includes the newer telnetd features.)

8) ps -ax (look for the process number for inetd. Suppose you find out
   it's 35).

9) kill -HUP 35  (restarts inetd)

10) Log out, log back in.  Should be done.

I agree with Bob throughout, but you forgot to include the -n switch
when you echo +++.  Without it, echo sends a \n, and you've already
broken the trailing guard time.

I highly recommend that you do so. A few of us here at Penn State are running

for gopher, ftp, and some other services. I think the address is archive.phish.net or ftp.phish.net or gopher.phish.net. Try it. I think that you will see that

If you require a 100% stable system for 'mission critical' application then
I would advise you to go for a comercial package such as HP/UX or ULTRIX on
the appropriate hardware. HOWEVER (Before you warm up your flame guns!)
As I said above I run (and have for almost 12 months) linux on 2 machines,
one at home and one at work and have found Linux to be stable, friendly,
expandable and EASY TO ADMINISTRATE, a must when it comes to un*x clones.
My other box is ULTRIX, and whilst reliable above and beyond the call of duty
you need a PHd in perverse thinking to get it to do anything out of the
ordinary.

If you, or anyone would like any pointers then feel free to mail me at home
or work:-

I have found that under 99pl13 (Alpha).... The one with the drivers dir:-)
route works o.k., but under 99pl12 patched to 13 the only way round
SIOCADDRT is :-
ifconfig eth0 up
route add <net> eth0
.. .. ..
.. .. ..
ifconfig eth0 <addr> broadcast <bcast> up
Hence I have changed to the Alpha release :-)

P.S. Does anyone know where i can get a version of 'routed' that works?
