As long as you don't have length and/or loading problems you _can_ connect
thick and thinnet together with a $3 passive connector.  I have both thick
(10base5) and thin (10base2) ethernet at home, and that's how they are
(sometimes) connected.

You network administrators probably think that thicknet and thinnet signalling
is somehow different.  The way to convince them that it isn't is to point out
that old-style external transceivers -- the kind the other department probably
uses -- have standardized network taps that can be easily detached, usually
with two screws through the transceiver.  This was so that a _thinnet_ tap
could be installed instead.  This was a relatively expensive way to run
thinnet, so your network admins have probably never seen one.

If they have length or loading worries, a $200-$300 thin-to-thick repeater
might provide peace of mind.

It depends on the IP addresses.

That's no help at all if the program you need to fix the problem with

Ultrix?! _BAD_ example!!! ;)

Running mission critical stuff on a Ultrix system is like allow a doctor to

Sorry, I just couldn't resist!

But Ultrix really does have some _SERIOUS_ problems!!!

Date: 23 Nov 93 22:34:26 GMT


Hello Folks,

I recently updated from Linux 0.99.8 to kernel 0.99.13. 
Compilation and installation worked fine, but I found out that my
serial line cua1 where the modem is attached does not work. The mouse 
works fine however.

When I try to cu or kermit, it always says 'all ports busy'. There 
is no lock file in /usr/spool/uucp and with the old kernel it works
fine.

I would be glad for any hint. Please respond by e-mail too
(gegu@spectrospin.ch) , it seems that our news installation is currently
a bit confused. I currently don't get any linux news.

Thanks,
Gerry

Buying one of these floppy controller controlled tape drives is a BAD
IDEA in the sense of linux (and in my opinion, any system, they are slow).

The drive will not work under linux without some ALPHA drivers, of which
a couple of friends have tried numerous times to get working and failed.

I understand, the drives are cheap, but you get what you pay for and the
driver for these drives have to be very specially written.  Not a 'one
night hack' perse.

My suggestion, go with either an 8 or 16 bit scsi supported by linux and
pick up a 150 meg drive (ARCHIVE 2150s, WANGTEK 5150ES, etc) and use it
with gzip compression.  Or, if you have the money, the WANGTEK 5525ES
holds 525 megs and there are DAT drives also.

Good luck and hope this helps you some.

 Hi,

 If you can, grab the alpha release of the Kernel Hackers Guide from
 the LDP. At pages 79 - 84 "How System Calls Work", you'll find at
 page 84.

 "At this point, you will either have to add a syscall to your library
 or use the proper _syscalln() macro to your *USER* program." (Mind you,
 not a literal quote, but it gets the point...) How this macro works, is
 explained in the KH guide. The macro itself is defined in unistd.h 
 in the usr/include/linux/ tree (in fact /usr/src/linux/include/linux).
 Note that the "n" in _syscalln stands for the number of parameters in
 the call to the function.

 Hope this helps you out...

Telnet freezing occurs with term, on hitting Ctrl-C in a variety of
contexts.  Are you using term to log in remotely?  If so there is a kludge
solution (very nasty) and a nicer solution.

Kludge:

rlogin or telnet localhost as soon as you log in, so that you don't send a
Ctrl-C to the pty term has logged you in on.

Better solution:

Get the telnetd sources (look for telnet-552.tar.z).  In the Config file,
under the linux section, add the following to the DEFINES variable:

-DNO_URGENT

And recompile telnetd and install it.  The problem will go away.

Not trying to start a flames or anything, but Michael asked about "commercial"

Commercial environments are often VERY different than edu and development
sites.  One big way is the lack of experimenting, and the lack of wanting or
needing the stock gnu-type tools.  What makes an OS work in business can be
summed up in three words:  APPLICATIONS, APPLICATIONS, APPLICATIONS!!
(Well, not quite that simple, but you get the idea :)  )

There are two things I can see Linux doing for
"real life environments" (read: normal business world) at the moment-

1) Act as a good news/mail machine
2) A free way to turn a clone into a good X-terminal type arrangement for
   connection to a "commercial" Unix host.

Both seem to work quite well, from the info I have gathered.  Outside that,
I'm not sure it is of any interest to the business (real) world.  The
reasons are the same ones which have been discussed before- no commercial
software available (please keep flames to yourself, Motif and a few packages
are hardly enough to compare to the many 1000's of commerical APPLICATIONS
available elsewhere), no binary compatibility with SCO/ISC/etc, documentation
which is scattered all over the place and often incomplete, out of date, and
differing in format, no "liability" (or percieved "liability") by the
makers of the OS (in other words, many businesses want to be able to hold
someone mentally liable for problems), and lack of larger tools (such as
special drivers for higher performance devices, multiprocessing, etc).

I use Linux at home, it is both fast and complete as a developer's system.
It is one of the best things to happen to clones since the first Unix
flavor was ported to it.  But there are things which must be done before it
is attractive to VARs and non-educational, non-software businesses.  Give it
some time, I have a feeling things like WINE, the documentation projects,
the binary compatibility projects, and countless other developments can turn
it around :)

Keep in mind, though, that I don't think the goal of Linux development has
been to create a business Unix....  if it were, it probably would
not be a popular as it is now.

  Well, I work in a commercial environment (Company with held), and I have 
been pushing my company to expand on the Linux network I set up as a cheap 
xterminal to be run over the modem.  Expanded from that, a network of 3 Linux
machines and 2 SPARCS.  The major use of the L:inux machines is as Xterminals
for the larger machines, but some of the programmers have found that devlopment
was fast and easier locally on the Linux machine, then after completion, 
building on the SPARC machines.  Though slow to respond, I am getting some
headway, and will be expanding the network slowly.  One of the draw backs
so far is most of the office is on 10 Base T, and I have not gotten Linux
to boot up with the cards we have...  
  Most of the managers here are impressed with it, but are still
afraid of losing there Word Perfect and Di Vinci mail.  I am pushing for a 
full Internet connection as opposed to the method of a UUCP site we have
now.  
  The most attractive thing about the Linux has been its price, and the
desire for more and more customers wanting to move to a Unix enviroment.
This combination is very attractive to penny pinching customers, especially
when they see that the 486 running Linux out performs most of the similar
applications done with a 486 running Windows.
  I have to agree, that the applications do lag, but if more people push Linux
into a commercial market, applications will follow.

Date: 24 Nov 1993 12:48:13 GMT

(Is there a *GOOD* FAQ about this?)

I just installed getty_ps2.0.7b, with all the options except ringback.
It works fine for console-logins, but there seems to be a problem
or to in serial logins.

I have a SupraModem 2400 (V22bis without error-correcting etc..)
connected to ttyS1.

1) DELAY=x in /etc/default/uugetty.ttyS1 (really a link to
/etc/default/getty.ttyS1) doesn't seem to work.  Debug-log says DELAY
is loaded (3 seconds in my setup), but immediately after the connect
issue is sent.

Error-correcting modems have problems with this.  Their handshake is
interpretet as "BADSPEED".  My /etc/gettydefs file says:

2400# .... #2400
1200# .... #1200

So the speed is really the one taken from the CONNECT\s\A string.

2) "Blocking" doesn't seem to work either.  I cannot use cua1 when
the getty is running - it still takes all the characters I type in
Kermit.

Kill me if I am wrong, but doesn't mount tell you just that your
