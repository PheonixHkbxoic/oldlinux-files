The ext2fs includes a file allocation heuristic which is quite good at
keeping related files close together, so it does offer good
performance for news partitions in which operations often have to be
repeated over all files in a directory (eg. news expires).  However,
obtaining objective results is hard, because no matter which
filesystem you use, performance will degrade somewhat over time due to
fragmentation.  From the evidence I have, ext2fs does appear to suffer
less from fragmentation than other filesystems.

There's another point - filesystem checking.  There is a new version
of e2fsck under development, and the latest public pre-release is on
tsx-11.mit.edu in /pub/linux/ALPHA/ext2fs.  Although it is still
officially in ALPHA, I don't know of any major problems with it, and
it does fix filesystem faults which cannot be fixed by any of the
other filesystems' fsck systems.  The only buggette I
know of in the public ALPHA is that it is occasionally necessary to
run e2fsck twice in order to correct some really nasty problems (for
example if the root directory inode needs to be reconstructed for some
reason).

It is also *very* much faster: of the order of 500% faster than the
old e2fsck.  The new version is much better at lost+found handling
than older ones.  You can thank Theodore Ts'o for this code.

Cheers,
 Stephen.

OK, Harald Koenig supplied the straight dope: the routine was included
in pl13c-pl13n (or thereabouts). It was temporarily removed because of
a library conflict, but will re-emerge in all its glory in the next official
release of the kernel/libc. He suggested grabbing it from one of those,
which I did (pl13j, linux/include/linux/timex.h, for the record).

I noted several responses to this thread from educational types, so I
thought I would make some input as a Linux user in a true commercial
environment.

I work for a small software development house, where we develope embedded
software for 680x0 and various RISC controllers.  We have run PCTCP
networking for years, using sevral Unix-based file/mail servers, and DOS
based PC's using FTP Software's PC/TCP package for DOS.  We first learned
of Linux back in Febreuary of this year (2/93), and started off then with
several user's PCs coverted over to Linux "workstations".  Since then,
most of our programmers have begun to use Linux for most of their work,
except for those cased where we must boot DOS (typically to run a
debugger or emulator tool).  But, at least in my case, most of my
coding happens under Linux, and my preliminary compilations are performed
with GCC.

We now have a network server that is running Linux, and is exporting
both its hard drive and a CD-ROM drive to the network.  In fact, that
is its main purpose - to share the CD-ROM drive, which none of our
commercial Unices have a driver for.  Works great.  This server has
been up for several months now, with a load varying from 2-15 users. 
Uptime has been up to 20+ days, and would be longer, except for local
power outages that seem to happen at least once or twice a month.

Proably the biggest reason I keep DOS around at all is for intensive
word processing, and for a few DOS-based development tools that I
need from time to time.  Other than that, Linux is very viable in
a commercial development environment, in my opinion.  At the very least,
even if Linux doesn't meet the needs of end users on your network, it
provides a VERY economical alternative for a network server OS.  It
is at least as stable as Intel-based Unices that we have paid 1000's for!

The mistake is not with the mount programme - it is with different
versions you may have.  With a 99p13 kernel, you have some of ext2fs
0.3c, or 0.3d, depending on the ALPHA level you use.  Changing the
binaries (mke2fs, e2fsck, etc.) does not change the kernel code, too.

Anyway, as far as I understand things, the functionality was
changed, but the data format kept the same.  This was possible,
because ext2 was carefully designed to be extensible.  You should
not discover incompatibilities between 0.3 and 0.4 (of course, you
will discover incompatibilities, when using the new features like
synchronous files, etc.)

Shadow passwords move the password information from the publicly readable
/etc/passwd to a more restricted /etc/shadow file.  This file also has
some extra fields to carry info like password expiration date.

It is possible to disable it by recompiling some programs with different
options, but you will certainly have more trouble with that (and the effects
on future installation of upgrades, networking etc) than you now save by
keeping things like you are accustomed to!

I agree, on a HP-UX troubleshooting course we learned to use fsdb (File
System DeBugger). We took the output of a fsck and then look with fsdb what's
really wrong and fix it like it has to be. We did it during lab exercises and
it work fine. Even just looking with fsdb and answering yes and the correct
places in fsck helps a lot. We just miss fsdb.

Another reson to go with the shifting of executable files from /etc to
/sbin is that it more closely follows the System V standard. Most 
commercial vendors these days use /sbin for utilities needed during
booting like fsck and mount.  In fact, these utilities are usually 
statically linked. /usr/sbin is used for sys admin utilities like mkfs,
route, reboot, and ypset. Often, you will find dynamically linked 
versions of the same utilities found in /sbin.

By being more conforming to the current standard will make using 
other Unix systems more "comfortable".

I did this many months ago to use on guest logins. A version that did just
the watch-part was posted on a German linux group (it was hacked from
script), and I then added the other part. But it has mahor drawbacks - the
main one being that the controlling tty of the user's shell isn't the serial
port anymore, but a pseudo-tty. Thus the user has no control whatsoever over
the serial port, and this messed up Z-modem downloads for me, so I decided
that sneaking wasn't a nice thing from the start, and deleted everything.
Sorry. It can be done, but to do it right might be very hard.

Subject: ld.so save space?
Date: 24 Nov 93 15:09:28

I am still running Linux SLS1.01 and Xfree86 V1.2 and have been
considering upgrading.  Space is tight on my disk and I would like to
know if shared executables now result in a smaller distribution for
Linux.

Also, I would like to mount my root partition read-only, or at least
have nothing in it which should be changing so that my system would be
more fs-damage resistant and could run e2fsck on the rest of the
partitions.  On my old pre-linux Unix system this was done by having
/usr be a separate partition (which had all the user and spool
directories).

So my question is: Which directories should be in the root partition
(/etc and /bin?) and how large should my root partition be to hold the
Slackware 1.10 versions of these directories?

Is this information in Slackware 1.10?  It wasn't in SLS1.01.

The allocation policy in FFS gets drastically worse if it doesn't have
a fair amount of free space to pick from.  This is where the magical
"10% free" number comes from. The need to leave 10% free in order to
keep reasonable (write) performance is one of the drawbacks of FFS,
although some feel it's a reasonable tradeoff.

Hello, world!

I'm having some difficulties with process tables filling up.  If my box sits
idle for more than about 2 hours, I find that the process table gets filled
with zombies spawned by rpc.portmap.  I can get rid of the zombies by
killing rpc.portmap, but I'd like to know if there is a solution.

The only common denominator I've been able to find is idle time.  Load, 
network connections, number of processes running, none of these matter.
It only happens when no users are logged in.

For details, I'm running pl13r, 16 megs RAM, NET-2-debugged.  Please email
me with any leads.

I think the point being missed here, is that only the latest
bootutils umount command cleanly unmounts root.  For those
who prefere the usermount version of mount and umount, the
simple solution is to rename the bootutils umount to 
root_umount.  Then in brc use "root_umount -a".  All methods
I've tried to use usermount's umount in brc have always resulted
in a failed to unmount error, and the root partition being left
