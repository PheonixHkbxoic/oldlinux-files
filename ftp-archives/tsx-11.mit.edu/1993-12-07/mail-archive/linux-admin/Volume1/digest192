Hard drive manufacturers already do enough unethical things already!

1) Use unformatted capacity in ads and specs, which is always much more than
the usable space

2) Define megabyte to mean 1000000 bytes instead of 1024^2 (1048576)

Subject: How to use function keys under X-windows
Date: 27 Nov 1993 23:10:18 -0800

I am absolutely excited about running X on Linux. It took some
figuring out and kernel recompiles and other tricks, but it works.
EXCEPT that I haven't figured out how to get the function keys in 
emacs to work like without X. I mean, I made a nice vt100.el and
keypad.el so that the PgUp key scrolls one screen up, the - and + keys
on the numeric keypad do cut and paste, and so on. This all worked
nicely on the VAX/VMS, and on Linux emacs. But now, running emacs
in X, these keys don't work anymore. 

I tried to set the TERM environment variable to vt100 (is default xterm)
in the xterm window right before I launch emacs &, and emacs seems to
see this value (M-! echo $TERM shows indeed vt100), but to no avail.

Is there something I need to know about X to get my function keys back?

Thanks,

I have the following detup and it works flawlessly:

Adaptec 1542B

The ?? refers to the actual model number, the manual seems to have got
lost and the only reference what the streamer is called is printed onto
it, but unfortunately INSIDE the computer. If you really need the info
I can unscrew it, but any Wangtek SCSI streamer should work (See also
the hardware compatibility list). If you do not have SCSI yet it is
a good idea if you can afford it: Easy upgrade to more disks, CD Rom
and tapes.
And yes, I have saved and restored about a gigabyte with it, just
use the normal SCSI tape devices (see also SCSI HOWTO).

You seem to totally ignore the inexpensive alternative of DC-600 tapes that
use the QIC-02 code, the original code for tapes with Linux.  I've used
a Wangtek 5150EQ with Linux for close to a year, it's much faster than
the floppy based solutions, and you can get 250mb uncompressed on DC6250
tapes.  The are in the $200-250 range in the for-sale conferences, and
a much better solution to tape backup with Linux.

I think this is a wrong procedure in SLS.  I had no end of trouble because 
of this.  The correct way, I think, is the following:  SLS uses shadow 
password, which uses the file /etc/login.defs for setting up defaults for all
login sessions.  You will find a line there which sets up the terminals.  It 
looks for a file called /etc/consoles, which should look like this:

        console tty1
        console tty2
        ............
        console tty12
        ............
        vt100   ttyS1
        ............

and so on.  The whole thing is quite clearly explained in /etc/login.defs, 
with plenty of comments.

Likewise, I use an Adaptec 1542B and an Archive (now Conner) Viper 5150S.  I
can assure you that it works... I just used it to back up and restore large
parts of my system while upgrading to Slackware 1.1.0 (finally!) and used it
rather heavily a couple of months ago to back up and then restore my *entire*
system after an abortive attempt to install SLS 1.03.

Linux's SCSI support includes SCSI tape support; you do not need additional
drivers if your SCSI controller is supported.

it always routed to my smart host. Also mail to `machine2' is routed
to my smart host. What gives ?.
Does the order of the entries make a different ?

properly after re-order the entry (don't know what I did).

How do you set permissions so you can only "su root" from a

switch to root.  I thought it was /etc/securetty...

I removed all entries except "console" from /etc/securetty, but
remote logins can still su to root.

When i tredir port 4000 to port 23 of my local machine , i can
telnet to the remote host at port 4000 and it tells me my escape
character and connect message but then i get a message on the term
window showing connect: Connection refused.

Why would term do this?
Is it a local configuration problem? txconn and trsh and damn near
everything else works flawlessly (even termtelnet which is great!)
but incoming telnet does not work.

I have configured my machine for NET-2 in hopes of finally getting

when i used the original telnet, it told me network not reachable.

Well, here comes one from someone who used one in the comany he worked for :-)

We used it as a news/mail-machine because the dos-stuff was to annoying, nothing
really worked as good as the typical sendmail/cnews/taylor_uucp-stuff, but
instead did cost money...

We used it to fax away via modem 400faxes at one night, it used 10h to do this,
and it was first-class-quality output... I had to think half-an-hour and then
wrote 4 lines of shellscript to do the job overnight, including logfile :-)

Commercial versions lack the features the gnu-type tools have. 

But on the other hand, this can be very expensive to the company because
we had to invest a lot of time into the machine to do what we wanted.

It would have been faster and probably cheaper to buy solutions from commercial
companies, at least in the shorter term, but it would never have worked that
nicely in the end...

...I installed a 1GB-scsi-drive at 4am from home via modem. I had to login
trice because of the reboots after partitioning and filesystemstuff, copying
the system from the old ide-drive to the scsi-device, but it worked!

All they had to do was plug in the news scsi-drive and mail me that they
wanted me to put the system on it, at the other morning they could take
out the old ide-drive and that's it.

> What makes an OS work in business can be
>summed up in three words:  APPLICATIONS, APPLICATIONS, APPLICATIONS!!
>(Well, not quite that simple, but you get the idea :)  )
We had \LaTeX to create nicelooking faxes, awk to process data like faxnumbers
and the like, emacs to edit, sendfax/mgetty to let people login and send/receive
faxes. 

And X was running via the network to the silly dosmachines, which was not half
as nice as a real X on linux, but this was the fault of the bad X-implementation
on the dos-machines.

Ah, and I did some development with it in C which I could use then on the
dos-machine, some simply cryptstuff, and it was much more fun to do this
on the linux with X and gcc and emacs than it would have been on DOS with 
BC or the like...

Exactly. It provides a nice unix-enviroment for the students at home because
most of them cannot afford suns or the like... and some companies can make
use of it, but the goal is not to sell anything...

Date: 29 Nov 93 05:27:42 GMT


I downloaded and successfully compiled the kernel release 0.99
patchlevel 13, but the kernel doesn't have the iso9660 CD-ROM file
system even though I asked for that at `make config' time, and the
file .config contains the following line:

CONFIG_ISO9660_FS = CONFIG_ISO9660_FS

I can't mount my CD-ROM without this file system.  Any idea what is
wrong, or to whom to report the problem?  I would like to use this
kernel to track down a bug in lilo, but I want access to my sources on
CD-ROM. 

I was also surprised that the kernel seemed to do an fsck of the root
file system at boot time; I brought down the system cleanly, and the
boot disk I made from the Yggdrasil distribution doesn't do such
checking.  I assume that ROOT=CURRENT in the makefile means use
whatever the root file system is now (in my case /dev/sda1), but
perhaps it means something else?

Subject: reporting bug in lilo-12 + Yggdrasil
Date: Mon, 29 Nov 1993 05:40:07 GMT


I tried to compile lilo version 0.12 in order to get better
diagnostics for my hard-disk boot problems, but when run under the
Yggdrasil F93 kernel, lilo has an infinite recursion :-(.
The offending code is in device.c:

  static int scan_dir(DEVICE *dev,char *parent,int number)
  {
      DIR *dp;
      struct dirent *dir;
      char *start;
  
      if ((dp = opendir(parent)) == NULL)
          die("opendir %s: %s",parent,strerror(errno));
      *(start = strchr(parent,0)) = '/';
      while (dir = readdir(dp)) {
          strcpy(start+1,dir->d_name);
          if (stat(parent,&dev->st) < 0)
              die("stat %s: %s",parent,strerror(errno));
          if (S_ISBLK(dev->st.st_mode) && dev->st.st_rdev == number) return 1;
          if (S_ISDIR(dev->st.st_mode) && strcmp(dir->d_name,".") &&
            strcmp(dir->d_name,"..") && scan_dir(dev,parent,number)) return 1;
      }
      (void) closedir(dp);
      *start = 0;
      return 0;
  }

What's happening is that lilo goes groveling in /dev/fd, which is a
link to /proc/self/fd, and guess what!  One of the files in
/proc/self/fd is the very same directory /dev/fd, and so lilo
continues to grovel because it assumes there are no loops in the file
system.  The fix is to keep a list of inode numbers currently being
visited, and to cut off the looping when such an inode number is
reached.   I'll post a patch when I have one.
