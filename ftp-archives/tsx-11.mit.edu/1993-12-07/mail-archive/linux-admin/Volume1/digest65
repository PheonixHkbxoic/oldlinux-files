:3.5" floppies also tend to be much more flaky than 5.25" floppies, at
:least in my experience.  Among high-density floppies, I've never had a
:5.25" disk go bad.  I've had several 3.5" disks go bad on me (bad
:enough that they can't be reformatted to full capacity).

    That particular problem has hardly ever occured with me, but I'm careful
to use only HD disks in HD drives.. when I have to use a 720K disk in a
1.44MB drive I either only do it for reading, or when I write to it its
extremely temporary.  My 3.5" disks go bad about as often as my 5.25" disks
did.  Also, cleaning the drive every once in a while is a good idea :-)

    Frankly, the compactness of 3.5" disks alone make them worthwhile.

Hello,
we tend to set up a low cost Unix-Cluster with Linux.
To incorporate these Linux-Boxes into our local
Unix-Cluster (AIX) a Network Information System (NIS, formerly called
yellow pages) would be useful/necessary.
Has anybody out there ported NIS-Software to Linux or
is somebody working on this problem?

Hello,
        I have been using Linux for a while now. Have 3 machines running
99.9 and just decided to upgrade to 99.12 to take advantage of the NET2.
        So I backed up and did a NEW install (NOT a patch) of 99.12
        All went GREAT! All installation was smooth (except for the creation
of a mucked-up fstab).
        Got the net back up and running in less than a few hours, everything
is fine until I went to the NET2-HOWTO.
        NOTHING seems to jive??? There is no /etc/rc.d/rc.inet.1 or 2
nor is there any of the config files referred to in the FAQ.
        Also on this new system there are links like:         /etc -> ./
and all sorts of links to /conf/net which does not exist at all!
        As I said all is well but I am really confused as to the conflicting
info. Is there a "FRESH-INSTALL-FOR-NET2-FAQ" or something somewhere??
        Any help or hints as to what is going on would be greatly appreciated.
                                                        Thanx,

Date: 19 Sep 93 01:23:24 GMT

Hi folks!  I built a pl12 kernel, but now I can't seem to use SLIP.
The connection gets established (my address is dynamically allocated)
but the carrier gets dropped when dip exits.

If I reboot with a pl11 kernel, it works fine.  (The connection stays
up.)

I tried recompiling the net-010 stuff, but it doesn't seem to make a
difference.  

Any suggestions on what's wrong or what I should try?  

THANKS!!!!

Date: Sun, 19 Sep 1993 01:32:20 GMT

When I cat a file with ANSI escape characters to the screen, it doesn't
show the control characters properly!

The file in question is /etc/issue.  On the console (or any of the virtual
tty's) it doesn't show up properly.  The ANSI codes (line drawing characters
and such) show up as so much junk - but when I dial in or use a straight
serial connection, it works just fine!

Is the problem in the console driver, or what?  I'm confused!  Please email
to erc@apple.com.  Thanks!!

Funny, I thought all of this was explained in the NET2-HOWTO.  It was in
the copy I just used last night to get SLIP running between two machines.

Did you install from SLS?  There are plenty of notes in the NET2-HOWTO
explaining how SLS is different.  It also explains how to straighten out
the mess.

But you don't get the stuff onto one 5 1/4" floppy.
Buy a 3 1/2" floppy and everything will be fine ...

Yes.  He will need to become *extremely* fluent in Unix to make things
work, particularly if he's installing SLS from scratch.

Good luck.

NO IT DID NOT.  You installed NET-2 code over SLS's old networking code.

This is what happens when you install NET-2 over SLS tcpip.  Don't do
it!  You'll have to change all the links so they are created, instead
of just warnings that file already exists, etc.  Basically this
means you have to do everything manually, figuring out while files
to erase, etc.  A pain yes.

If you read the NET-2 FAQ VERY CAREFULLY (word for word) and create
the proper directories/erase all impertenant ones, you will eventually
get it installed correctly.  Either that or go erase everything in
your HD and install a properly configured NET-2 package (such as 
Slackware).

don't know if this is the right place to ask, but anyway:
since i've installed(tookoff&reinstalled) linux on my system, i've
been trying to figure out where it gets the root's aliases, etc.
from.  i can't find a .*rc (.cshrc like) file anywhere.  where is
it? or is it built in & needs a program to modify it? please help.
