A set-UID root shell script is equivalent to giving every user on
the system unrestricted root access.

I suggest you find a way to do it without set-UID shell scripts.

The way I do it is this: I start X with the command `exec startx &', this 
starts X in the background and replaces my login shell with the shell 
started by the startx script.  Then I switch back to the VT I started X from,
and logout.

Start xdm with the option `-nodaemon' and `-terminate'.  I forget the exact 
syntax, it is in the man page.  In fact, I start xdm directly from the 
inittab like this:

 xd:3:respawn:/usr/X386/bin -nodaemon -terminate

Hope this solves your problem.

I just realised that xdm no such option called `terminate'.  What I actually 
did was to put the following in /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config:

Reply-To: mark@macs.ee.mcgill.ca
Date: Fri, 17 Sep 1993 23:13:31 GMT


I've been having networking problems with SLS 1.03, 0.99pl12, running SLIP.
This problem has manifested itself in many forms.  I've got my mtu set to
600, but I've tried other values... no success.  Basically, the problem is
that transfers from the local host to the remote host fail whether using NFS,
rcp, or ftptool, whereas transfers from the remote host to the local host are
successful.



1) NFS mounting:
================

I can successfully mount a partition from our Suns at school on my Linux
(home) over SLIP.  I can browse through the mounted partition, cat-ing files,
etc...  When I try to copy a file from my Linux machine onto the mounted
partition, it seems to work for small files but gives an error for large
files.  Here's an example session:

mark@olympus:[src] 489> df
Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
/dev/hda4             226380  182528    32533     85%   /
/dev/hda1             163552  105792    57760     65%   /dos
defiant:/.export.home/mark
                      201167  125661    55390     69%   /home/vlsi/mark
mark@olympus:[src] 490> cd /home/vlsi/mark
mark@olympus:[mark] 491> ls -l /etc/motd
-r--r--r--   1 bin      bin            69 Aug  1 10:58 /etc/motd
mark@olympus:[mark] 492> cp /etc/motd .
mark@olympus:[mark] 493> ls -l motd
-r--r--r--   1 mark     vlsi           69 Aug  1 10:58 motd

* At this point, everything seems to be fine.  I managed to copy this small
* file.  Now try to copy a larger file.

mark@olympus:[mark] 494> cp /zImage .
cp: ./zImage: Invalid argument

* Now it gives this strange error.  It seems to give the same error for all
* large files whereas small files get copied successfully.
* On the other hand, when copying files from Sun to Linux, they get copied
* successfully no matter how large.



2) Transferring files using rcp:
================================

If I rcp a file from the Sun to my Linux machine, all goes well.  However,
when I try to do the opposite (i.e. transfer a file from Linux to Sun), a
part of the file is transferred after which rcp just hangs



3) Transferring files using ftptool 4.3b3:
==========================================

Regular ftp seems to work fine.  However, when using the latest ftptool to
transfer files from the local host to the remote host, and after part of the
file is transferred (typically after 150K or so), the tool gives as error
which is something like:

Write on remote host failed.  Disk full?

The disk is certainly not full, and I have no quota limitations.


Any ideas anyone?  I'm totally clueless.

Thanks in advance,
Mark

Find a partition with a *LOT* of free space in it.

'dd if=/dev/zero of=name_of_swap_file bs=8192 count=2048'
will create a 16 MB file.

'mkswap ./name_of_swap_file 16384'
will initialize the file as a swap-space 

'swapon ./name_of_swap_file'
activates the newly created and initialized swap-file

'free' shows the total amount of memory and swap space.

I have a shell script that automatically launches term and etc etc (its
quite long and complicated) that also broke when using the new bash...
so either I was exploiting bugs (unknowingly) in the old one, or finding them
in the new one...

As of 0.99.12 linux will mmap() files over NFS (readonly), but swapping
over NFS is still not possible at this time, and nobody is working on it
as far as I know.

I wonder if you're having flow control problems or are overrunning a
buffer somewhere.  Modern modems tend to be setup up with tty speeds
faster than the effective line speed, so they require that hardware
flow control work.  I'd check the settings on the modems, and also
make sure that flow control is enabled on your machine, the machine at
the other end, and both modems.

Reply-To: lam836@cs.cuhk.hk

        Since I started using SLIP, security becomes a concern. I would
like to send a message to root whenever there is someone who attempts
to login my machine from the outside. My /etc/syslog.conf contains this
line: "auth.notice;mail.info     root". This will send message to root
even if I carelessly typed a wrong password from the VCs. Is it possible
to set it up so that root is only notified for login failures from the
outside (i.e. not from the VCs)? How about if I want the machine to "Beep"
also?

        Thanks.

Regards,
Savio Lam.

The problem with set user id root scripts is that it is easy to call them
with an appropriately modified environment which will change the default
bahaviour of the shell. For example, setting some weird aliases, or
environment variables such as IFS, or even just the prompt string PS1
(which can contain `cmd` sequences) can then influence the shell
script's behaviour in ways that are not always intended by the script
writer.

I cannot make any guesses about how your system works exactly, but shell
procedures with suid root are not to be recommended.
