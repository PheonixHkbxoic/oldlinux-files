    The one from uunet is indeed 2.4.22. What appears to go wrong is
that you must change the ranlib line by using the shell escape at the
end of configure, rather than editing the file when configure stops
running. That's the only thing I did different when it worked, so that's
my guess.
    Anyway, it all works fine now, so I can again use bash 1.13. 

    As a side note, the recently released strn, the scoring version of
trn compiles and runs fine with linux, using Vince's news pack 1.7
suggestions for trn 3.n. I suggest even people who aren't all that
interested in the scoring features check it out, as it has a lot more
online documentation than trn.

Subject: Adding users under Slackware
Date: 22 Sep 1993 05:08:42 GMT

HELP!  I can't add users under slackware.  I have it installed and connected
to Internet okay, but I can only login as root, and I can't add users.
Useradd seems to run okay, but when I try to change the passwd from the
root account for the new user, or try to modify or delete it, it says
'user does not exist' or something to that effect.  I'm sure I'm making
some stupid mistake, but I can't find any info about it in the Install-howto
or the FAQ's.  I tried to install the user manually, as per the FAQ but
it still didn't work.  When I try to useradd the user again, without
deleting its entry in passwd and shadow, it gives me that the identifier
exists, but nothing else can find the user.
 
Help extremely appreciated...

Say what?  With the possible exception of IBM, I don't think there's
anybody here in the US that ships systems with only 3.5" floppy
drives.  In mixed-drive systems, the 5.25" drive is almost always
configured as the boot drive.

I have the October issue of Computer Shopper in front of me.  On the
cover, they show a Quantex 486DX2-66 system with dual drives; the
5.25" drive is the boot drive.  This photo goes with their cover
story...turn to that story (begins on page 222) and we see systems
from Insight, HD Computer, and some unknown company...all are
dual-drive systems with 5.25" drives mounted as boot drives (the
Insight even has the 5.25" drive labeled as drive A:).  Let's turn to
some ads, now...we see 5.25" boot drives in systems from Ares (p. 37),
Computer Sales Professional ("PC Professional") (p. 43), TC Computers
(p. 50), Zeos (p.  163)...personally, I wouldn't buy a machine if it
didn't have a 5.25" drive available as at least an option.

Subject: eth0 receiver overrun...please repost (or email me) the patch
Date: 22 Sep 1993 08:31:39 GMT

The subject line pretty much sums it up...I'm trying to get Linux running
on a department computer for the students, and I'm using an old
WD ethernet card (can't offhand recall model).  Every so often,
I get the eth0 receiver overrun error, along with error messages
about inability to allocate...I have to reboot to unlock the machine.
Since I want this machine on the net, I obviously need to fix this
problem.

I read a post that there is a patch out for this (apparently the
kernel is storing packets that aren't meant for it, as I understand
things).  I'm running 0.99pl11.

(If you don't have the patch, but now how to fix this problem, I
would certainly appreciate your help.)

What about bootb.zip ? ( from ancient SLS times yet available at
clio.rz.uni-duesseldorf.de:[/rz/ftp/]linux/sls102 )
Or is that no longer usable because of the double ramdisk copyings (the 
second one after the kernel configuration messages and so presumably not by

Subject: crond output=>mail problem
Date: Wed, 22 Sep 1993 12:55:53 GMT

Hello:

   I've recently installed the full slackware 1.03 distribution. ( Which
includes Vixie cron, smail, and elm. )  Normally, when cron runs, it
should redirect all output to mail which is then posted to the owner of
the crontab in question.

However:

   In this case, whenever output is supposed to be mailed, cron spawns:

/bin/mail -d root   ( or the appropriate user )

which leaves an mbox.root file in /tmp.  And never exits.  So of course
no mail gets sent. ( And root can run elm until the file gets 
deleted. )

Has anyone else encountered this partiular problem?  Better yet, any
solutions?  :-)

- Rich

This is not necessary. That was Patrick's entire point of creating a 5.25
boot/root combo. Use it to boot off the 5.25 then load the distribution off
the 3.5.

In Slackware 1.01 there was no 5.25 boot/root combo and I had 2 machines with
5.25 boot drives and 3.5 secondary drives. On the first I did what you
suggested. On the second I built my own 5.25 boot/root combo disk. I also
asked Patrick to address the issue. He did. He just responsive like that ;-)

This is irrelavent in terms of the original argument (which this thread has
strayed away from). What I got from Greg's post is that most new machine have
a 1.44M 3.5" floppy. That's all you need to install Slackware. It doesn't
matter if it's the boot floppy or not.

Let's kick the question out again: How many new machines are sold without
a 3.5" 1.44M floppy at all?

Sorry to say that this seems to be real nonsense. A script is simply fed
into a shell or another interpreter. It is the shell's permissions which
counts - not the script's.

Try it out and you will see that you cannot give someone root permissions
with a setuid root script as long as you do not make the shell run setuid
root (The latter is equivalent to "rm -rf /" as root :-).

That is true with some Unices, but not Linux.
With standard Linux, the setuid bits are ignored for shell scripts.

I do have a patch to Linux which provides _secure_ setuid shell scripts,
so long as there aren't any security problems with the shell itself.
Linux's standard shell (bash) has only one security problem ($ENV)
for which I also have a patch.  If you install both of these patches,
then you can have completely secure setuid shell scripts.
(Of course, as with any setuid program, you still need to be careful!)

I have found that .a files being corrupted occurs only when I am doing
static linking. Dynamic linking works normally. Static linking works
only with the processor cache disabled. Note that I updated the dynamic
link libraries a few weeks ago, but I left the .a files alone.  Is the
code to flush cache lines been moved in the last few library releases?
It wouldn't bother me, except that I can not compile with the -ggdb

Sorry this is not true the setuid on a script is VERY meaningful, and is a
very large security risk (though maybe not quite as bad Valdis Kletnieks
implies)

However some unices do have the option of ignoreing the setuid bit, and some
do ignore it by default.

I have the following problem with gdb, both with the gdb 4.8 bin that
comes with slackware and with gdb 4.10.pl1 that I compiled (GCC 2.4.5)
myself.  (The gdb 4.10.pl1 that I use on a SPARC does not have this problem.)

When I interactively "call" one of my own functions to print out some
data, the data is printed, but the function does not exit properly and
I get the message

    writing register number 10(0): I/O error.
    Unable to restore previously selected frame.

(This happens every time I call one of my own functions.)  Then I cannot
continue execution.  Here is an example.

Program received signal SIGINT (2), Interrupt

============

xxgdb - a separate problem (the bin that comes with slackware).
Control-c does not interrupt the process.  (It does on my SPARC.)

BTW - when xxgdb uses gdb 4.10.pl1, we don't get the "not a typewriter"
message like we do with 4.8.
