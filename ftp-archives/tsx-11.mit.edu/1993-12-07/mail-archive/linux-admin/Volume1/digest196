There   are    several  rzsz-versions around:   stock-, Linux-patched,
graphical-  and  X11-versions. The   Linux-patched and  X11   ones use
STDIN/STDOUT  again  instead  of the  controlling  tty  or  consult an
environment-variable "RZSZLINE".

You can make Xrz work with Seyon for example, if you tell Seyon to use
the dial-in device /dev/ttyS# and  fire up Xrz  with "$xrz".  The  "$"
makes STDIN/STDOUT beeing the modem-device Seyon uses.

If you use /dev/cua# instead (as you should  and have to with kermit),
rz finishes immediately :-(

These problems come up again and  again.  You can't use the cua-kermit
with the ttyS-mgetty for instance :-(( mgetty doesn't notice kermit on
the corresponding cua-device and eats all characters from the modem.

For your problem  with "sz": use the  new 9305-rzsz, the Linux-patches
(which  will make sz  use STDIN/STDOUT  and/or  RZSZLINE, depending on
Makefile -Ds), use a terminal-program  that works with dial-in devices
and write a macro like

DEFINE sz RUN  RZSZLINE=\v(line) sz

(for kermit in this case, which doesn't work, see above)

An easy way to do this is to, as root, untar an archive which includes an
entry for `.' directly into /tmp.  I once hosed permissions on
/usr/spool/uucppublic in this fashion, causing no end of confusion for a while.

SCHED is broken in 2.0.7b.  Take a look at the source code.  It will only
process the first schedule interval, and will sometimes try to sleep until
Jan 1, 1970.

I have an incomplete patch which I have used successfully (although it once
had an unexplained episode of core dumps, which is why I haven't offered
it to anyone else).  It is of somewhat limited utility, as the maximum
input line length restricts the number of scheduling intervals which can
be defined.  I've also been working on this, but since I have no need for
dialin access at the moment, my attention has been focused elsewhere.

Anyway, if the maintainers of getty_ps want to play with this, I'd be glad
to mail them what I have so far.

Subject: FTP-Problems with LINUX and NCSA
Date: 30 Nov 1993 19:08:27 GMT

Hi,

last month we installed some linux-machines on our network. One of the more serious 
problems that we can't solve, was the file transfer from linux to our DOS-PC's.

  Configuration:  DOS-PC - NCSA-Telnet 2.3
                  Linux  - pl13 and pl14 
                           ftpd from new-net2
                           diku-ftpd

Whenever I try to 'get' a file from a linux-machine that ist greater than 1023 bytes
ftp freezes. Same happens with 'dir' in big directories.
A workaround is to configure the DOS-PC as a telnet server (telnet -s). Then it is
possible to log in from the linux-machines an 'put' and 'get' files.
Ftp from DOS to other Unix-machines works.

Ftp from other Unix-machines (SGI,Apollo) works well with the diku-ftpd.

Is this a bug or a configuration-problem?

I suspect that this may be a local configuration problem.  I still
recieve this message even though loopback works properly, and 'telnet
localhost 23' works fine on my home Linux box.

For some unknowable reason, "tredir 4000 127.0.0.1:23" works
correctly.  I really don't know why this is the case, and finally
tried after some suggestions on IRC.  It might work for you.
(Actually, though, I think my message was "gethostbyname: Connection
refused", so your case may be different.  In this case, read the
net-2-howto to set up inetd and loopback first.)

The "screen" package can do this. The only disadvantage is that the user must 
have a reasonable terminal; "glass TTY" mode won't work.

I did some more looking and found it.  Keeping source on my machine
finally came in handy.  The su in admutil-1.7b.tar.gz does the group
check.  I didn't see in on sunsite, but it can be found on any tsx-11
mirror in .../linux/sources/sbin/admutil-1.7b.tar.gz or on
daimi.aau.dk (the latest version will always be here).  Rik Faith's
utils can always be found on ftp.cs.unc.edu in /pub/faith/linux/utils
and most of these are taken from the GNU sources, which compile
without a hitch.

They do.  But there's another problem not mentioned in the top-level README
for smail configuration:  methods/table as distributed contains the line

        *       smtp

If you don't change that to "uux" instead of "smtp", guess how it tries to
send everything?  :-(

First of all, I am not really a smail expert, but I am busy
configuring it on our soon to be gateway to .NA so I learned some
things the hard way, by RTFM, gosh :-)-O

From the looks of it, you haven't configured the routers and/or
transports files properly (or they are not there at all?).

It might help very much to try something like:

      echo eeeee | smail -v1000 user@machine1.his.full.domain 2>&1 | more


This will show you exactly how smail arrives at using the smart path.


Then I always do the raw paths file, never the paths file direct and
run pathalias (well, I have a little Makefile for it actually).


machine1        =       machine1.his.full.domain
localbox                machine1(DAILY)
machine2                machine1(DAILY)

util/pathalias should now do it.

As always you can try the author (tron@veritas.com) and if all fails,
you may well have to RTFM :-)-O.

I would guess that your hosts.conf is set to look the name up via a DNS.  Set
to use /etc/hosts instead and you'll be away, since all you will need is like
the following (which is mine):

/etc/host.conf:

order hosts

/etc/hosts:

127.0.0.1       localhost cyclin.zoo.cam.ac.uk cyclin

/etc/rc.net:

# /etc/rc.net
# Linux networking startup script.  Should be run by /etc/rc.local at
# boot time.  Configures the interfaces and starts the deamons.
# It assumes hostname has been set.
#
#
CONFIG=/usr/etc/ifconfig
INETD=/usr/etc/inetd
ROUTE=/usr/etc/route

HOSTNAME=`/bin/hostname`

# You may need to add a /usr/etc/ifsetup command to set the parameters
# for your ethernet card.

$CONFIG lo up 127.0.0.1
$ROUTE add 127.0.0.1

if [ -x $INETD ]; then
        echo starting $INETD

The only clean way I can see to do this, so that it didn't require the
cooperation of the user, didn't end up with the user on a pty, didn't
involve extra processes, (etc...) would be for the kernel to have some
method of `tapping' the tty queue.  Any characters sent to the `tapped'
tty would also be sent to the designated tty.

You would have to deal with problems when the `tappee' tty is unable to
accept further characters, and other such details.

This is before you start worrying about the fact you are watching on a
vtxxx, and they are using a vtzzz.

I think that the `legitimate' uses of this would be so small that somebody
is unlikely to go to the bother of doing so.  

Probably a much easier scheme would be to build a tapped cable feeding
output from ttyS0 into ttyS1, and "cat < ttyS1".
