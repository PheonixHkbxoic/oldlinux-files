INN supports both NNTP and UUCP feeds very easily. See my INN 1.4 for
Linux port:

>(The idea here is to have an internet host that doubles as a fileserver...)

Having TCP/IP as a transmission protocol does not guarantee the upper layers
are compatible.

Linux uses the UNIX model. Software such as telnet, ftp, nfs, lpd, etc.
serve the networking functions of Linux.

MSDOS uses a NetBios model. That LAN uses NCB and SMB system. The two
are not compatible.

The bottom line is that it can not be done with the present state of software
for both systems. There is software for MSDOS which will inter-operate with a
UNIX platform. There hasn't been much of a call for software on UNIX to
recognize SMBs. It may be an interesting project. Are you planning on writing
it?

Try to compile your gopher-client with ncurses instead of the default
curses-library. Version 1.8.1 of the ncurses gives 8-bit clean

NO. You will have to involve your system administrator. PPP is treated
as if it was a device for a local area network. You will have to route IP
frames to the device. Routing frames requires root access.

If you just wish to retrieve files, then check out sz and rz. If you wish
a general server function, then try Kermit's server mode.

If you wish a "peer" connection to your LAN via PPP, then you will have
to talk to the administrator of your system. On the server side, there is
normally a "ppp" user whose shell is the pppd program. You would logon
as this "ppp" user (using the normal getty/login program). The login will
then start the PPP link.

Date: 4 Dec 93 21:21:58 GMT

This little problem I am having is sending me through the roof and
I have no clue how to fix it.  I assume it is a admin problem since
these are global user commands.

Anyways, when I am using any program, erase is always the backspace (^H)
key and delete is always its own separate thing (^?).  However!  When
I start vi or ed, and try to comment out lines using the '#' key, I
have discovered that '#' is now the erase key sequence and the regular
erase sequences just spit out what keystroke they are (^? or ^H).

Now this is VERY irritating as I can not edit squat (other than with emacs
*grumble*).  How do I fix this problem?  

FOR YOUR INFO:
        Slackware 1.0.5, .99.pl13.  Xfree86 1.3

[...personal opinion mode on...]

First, if it ain't broke...do NOT fix it unless you're looking for
an opportunity to learn something new.  Same goes for upgrades to
new packages, kernels, libraries, etc.  Don't mess with stuff that
will get you nothing in 'net value' (unless the experience of messing
with it and understanding it is the value to you).

[...sendmail+IDA zealot mode on :-)...]

I don't know how things can be easier to configure and maintain than
sendmail5.67a+IDA1.5 - it does everything all the others do and it's
extremely simple to configure, test, and maintain.

sendmail without IDA enhancements is a bit of a pain to 'get fancy' with
but for normal stuff it's ok.  You can make a career out of sendmail.cf
configuration however :-(

sendmail8.6.4 is the new kid on the block and has lots of improvements over
sendmail5.65.  It's also supposed to be easier to maintain like
sendmail+IDA.  I personally find it more complicated to figure out and I
can't make it do all the same things I can make sendmail+IDA do.  However,
that might be because I'm still 'thinking IDA' and it isn't IDA :-)

I can't think of too many nice things to say about smail3.1.28 these days.
The others blow its doors off IMHO in terms of functionality, ease of use,
and size of the expert admin community on USENET.  It *does* get the job
done once you get the hang of it however, but I find it extremely
complicated to do fancy stuff with.

My recommendation is to read comp.mail.sendmail, buy the O'Reilly
'sendmail' book that's out, and pick either sendmail+IDA or sendmail8.6.4
(both of which have clean ports to Linux).

I run sendmail+IDA here and on 300+ systems at work and can't think of
anything it can't do simply and effectively.  If you're talking Linux only,
Rich Braun has a real nice port of sendmail5.65c+IDA1.4.4.1 on sunsite.

Based on Rich's work, I got the current version (5.67a+IDA1.5) compiled and
run it here from the vanilla sources from ftp.uiuc.edu.  Maybe someday I'll
complete putting a package of the new version together and uploading it
to the normal Linux sites.

The only advantage in functionality of cpio is the ability to
archive files with names longer than 255 characters.  Also, older
versions of tar had problems archiving special devices.  Other than
these slight differences, it is just a matter of taste.  Personally
I prefere tar, because that is what I'm used to.  It looks like cpio
takes about 0.5% less space, but both tar and cpio fail to preserve
holes, and take up much more space than really needed for directories
like /lib.

        I would guess, you log in via xdm.  Xfree86 has an xdm, which is
        broken in many ways - it messes up terminal settings, group settings,
        and may hang your server, when logging out the second time.

To fix the problem with #, type:

        stty sane

before starting vi, or include it into your .profile/.login file
(depending, on which shell you use).

After using sendmail5.65+IDA for a while, I changed to smail.3.1.28
because smail is capable of sending 8-bit mail. Due to local
configuration, I found that attractive. I've not found an easy way to
get sendmail to cope with 8-bit mail, but I've not tried the two

I backed libc down from 4.4.4 to the libc.4.4.2 included in the yp-linux

  I have to disagree.  All I was asking for was if someone has found a way
  for a Linux box to share files with other (DOS based) stations.  This
  shouldn't be rocket science.  Notice I said nothing about record locking
  of databases or even read/write access.  I'm concerned first with the DOS
  machines being able to read DOS files on the Linux server.  After all,
  a Un*x machine can FTP files to a DOS harddrive, and I wouldn't be at all
  surprised to learn that it could NFS mount that same drive.

  What I'm getting at here is that I want a server for DOS files on a network
  (10BaseT) and I want a Unix box on that same network.  It would be spiffy
  if they could both be the same machine.
