All:

        I have getty_ps v2.07b installed, and while the waitfor script works
wonderfully, the Ringback option does not work.  I have the line set for
cua0, and the /dev/cua0 is correct configured.  Does anyone have a working
script for /etc/default/uugetty.ttyS0?

I had a similar problem when I tried to get RINGBACK to work.  Basically what
you need to do is to play with the value of the RINGBACK variables until it
works.  The values you will need differ from phone company to phone company.
Take a look at the file README.ringback or something like that in the getty_ps
2.0.7b kit, which describes the different variables.  Sorry, I can't remember
them offhand.

Good luck,

Ian

The limit for a single swap file/partition is 16MB (16380).
If mkswap "lets you" use 32984, then I'd be very suspicious.

26*26 will give you all the possible combinations of 2 letter, lower
case passwords (all 676 of them). Assuming that most people use 8 letter
passwords, the total number of passwords using lower case letters only
is  26^8  (26 to the power of 8), a total of 208827064576 possible
combinations.  If uppercase and numbers are taken into this (still
exclusing special symbols, etc), there's a total of 52^8=53459728531456
combinations - so the total time to crack a password is a little more
than the 108 hours above.

Yep, you got it!!

This does not work, because the problem is that the "backspace" key
does not send CNTRL-H (backspace) but "Delete".

To get it right, you just have to modify the keytable you use to map your
keyboard, and replace the line:

keycode  14 = Delete           Delete   

        by:

keycode  14 = BackSpace            Delete         


This makes the backspace key send the real backspace, and send Del when
shifted.

(And now stty erase ^H will work)

I use a Sony SCSI streamer (Wangtek inside), usually connected to Sun'S or

It works perfectly whith this device:

Hello fellow System Administrators,

We are interested in performing an evaluation of two Unix script
languages, TCL/TK and Perl.  So that we can look at
relevant criteria for such an evaluation we would like some feedback
from Systems Administrators as to what you feel are criteria, relevent
to such an evaluation of the languages.

The criteria should be listed in order from the most important to the
least important.  Any other comments on either of these languages would
also be appreciated. 

My address is   maxwells@jasper.ucq.edu.au

Thanks for your interest

Samantha Maxwell

I have had problems with RINGBACK not working:  getty had detected the first
(arming?) ring and when it saw the next call it sent out the answer sequence:
ATA...  But the modem ignored it!
The answer (sent by a fellow-netter) is to put a delay before the
ATA:  \pATA ...
(This is with a PackardBell 2400 modem)

If that doesn't help, try turning on debug.

Clever code that getty_ps.

The SAK causes a kill -9 because it is an absolute requirement that the SAK
kills _ANY_ process currently operating on that terminal. The theory is that
hitting SAK ensures no smartarse has left a fake getty running on the terminal
or used any similar attack. vhangup() ought to work as it disassociates the
tty stream, but kill -9 is well.. reassuring

 Here in Umiacs we run Crack on users accounts just to make sure they aren't
using dumb passwds. (A few people still like to use there names.)  And this
take alot of time even on and Alpha.

 We have a parallel computer cm5-32nodes.  And believe me that even with a
fully loaded cm5(1024node) you are not going to be cracking passwds on a
regular basis.  To be complete its 96 possible chars for each passwd letter.
So thats     96  1 character passwds
          9,216  2 character
        884,736  3 char
     84,934,656  4 char
  3,858,759,680+ 5 char   (My calc ran out of bits..)
 (8,something  )

 Even if you make a for loop just to loop throu all those passwds your still
going to take a long time.  On a 32 node i860 hypercube and ran throu all
3 character passwds in ~2 minutes.  So for all 5 characters that would be
12 days.  So all 6 characters would be ~38 months.

 Your mileage will be different.

 About Shadow.  I think its a good idea since it keeps people who run Crack
on a system that doesn't run it themselves safe.  I know a university just
down the road from here that had over 400 passwds cracked by Crack in just 
a short amount of time (2 days.)  I'm not saying that was umbc or anything.

 One Vote for Shadow.  I still think its a pain.
