        I've seen a lot of conversation on the Linux and BBS newsgroups
recently about running a freeware Linux BBS.  The responses haven't been
too appealing, especially from the 'freeware' standpoint.  I've got an
idea that's perfect for the Linux environment.
        Why can't we write one?  I'm not up to it myself, but I'd be

Well, you must be installing certain packages then or asking for 3.5's. 
Like I said before, my entire system sofware (DOS/Windows/Word/etc) came on
5.25's less than a year ago.  5.25 is still VERY common.  I have yet to see
software that didn't have a 5.25 option.

If Microsoft said 'Tough Turnips' this often, they would be dead now.  
(we all wish) 

The POINT is that a person who has never tried Linux might have to go out
and BUY another drive just to see it run.  This means that LOTS of people
WON'T BOTHER TRYING LINUX.  Lots of people aren't even willing to switch
their floppy drives to try installing something (thus the development of a
Slackware 5.25 boot image).  

I am speaking as someone who runs a BBS, and who is trying to keep available
a version of Linux everyone can try.  Restricting who can run Linux in any
way will only hurt it.

I'm hardly whining.  I'm just pointing out that the Slackware distribution
is cutting people out where it doesn't have to.  All that needs to be done
is restrict the disk images to a size that fits on both types of disk.  Is
that so tough?

Slackware looks to me like the best distribution around.  I'm disappointed
that it doesn't come in a format that everyone can use.  Like I said, I only
have room for one set of disks on my BBS, and for now that will have to stay
SLS.

Who's spewing garbage?  I'm not the one swearing like a street urchin.  Of

From: ritchiej@osshe.edu (John Ritchie)
Subject: security and Linux binaries
Date: 22 Sep 93 18:00:20 GMT


Hello fellow Linux sysadmins...

Recently I was reading some Unix System's administration book or other,
and in this book it mentioned that a security-conscious sysadmin should
"never" use pre-compiled binaries supplied by an unknown (such as
Public Domain) source, especially programs that run setuid root or
handle sensitive things such as passwords.  The book, furthermore,
stated that a sysadmin should carefully read through any public-domain
source code (or other source code of questionable, well, source) before
compiling it, and not compile it if there is anything that isn't
understood.

Although I think that the above view is a bit on the paranoid side, it
does raise a hairy question for the Linux community.  Most Linux users
are _extremely_ vulnerable to security attacks, especially since Linux
is becoming so popular among Unix neophytes who install binaries
packaged by a thousand different "vendors", without reading or
understanding the source code.  In such an environment of sharing and
trust among Linux users it would be child's play to propagate any
number of hidden surprises inside packages that would be freely passed
around a huge community.

I guess the point I want to make is three-fold:  First, users, be aware
of the possibility that binaries you use may not be as secure as you
assume they are; Second, packagers (such as SLS or Slackware), many
users are trusting your packages to contain clean binaries so YOU
should be sure that they all are clean; and thirdly, this problem once
again points out the importance of the Copyleft policy of having
source-code freely available.  If you can't find source code for
something to inspect and compile yourself, realize that you're taking
an increased risk by using that package.  For example, users of
"termtelnet," to name one, should think about the fact that this is a
program for which we can't find the source code (I, and several other
posters on comp.os.linux.help), that may pose a serious security risk
(do we know everything that happens when we answer the "Password:"
prompt?).

I don't mean to denigrate Linux in any way with this post, I think that
the whole Linux concept of freely shared development and use is part of
what makes it such a fantastic operating system.  But I do want to
point out one danger that is inherent in such an environment.

: and the script is owned by root.

So is it the kernel  or the script  interpreter? What is necessary  to
enable or disable setuid execution of scripts?

I think it must be in the kernel since a non-setuid shell cannot apply
the setuid bit of a script  to itself. It may ignore  it if the kernel
passes setuid permissions to the shell, but the other way around?

Since this is  a  Linux newsgroup  I   suggest that we   should mainly
discuss Linux   related  stuff  - especially  in  THIS  newsgroup.   I
sometimes get  a bit  confused  by  postings  about non-Linux  systems
without explicit statements about the system meant.  So: Thank you for
your note about SPARCs (which OS?).

I think we are  coming to the point  where we need  a grand wizard  to
clear our minds. On my Linux 0.99pl13 box the kernel and/or the shells
(tcsh-6.04 and  bash-1.12) ignore the setuid bit  of scripts.  I tried
it!  I do admit that I did not test it on older kernels.

Are there older kernels which showed the feature discussed?

BTW: I  feel very satisfied of the  discipline of this discussion - no
flames, no injuries (maybe I had left this road a little bit. Sorry).

The same problem disappeared here with the new kernel 0.99pl13.
For older kernels look for ip_forward(something) in net/inet/ip.c

Thanks to those who sent me help following my original posting, but perhaps
I wasn't very clear... Of course I know how to make my modem hang up
using Hayes commands.

The point is, if the serial device is configured correctly it should
hang up the line after someone logs off, or when its baud rate is set
to 0.  This has got nothing to do with modem commands, but rather a
particular line being set low.

     Rajesh,

     I had this problem a few times myself.  The way I got around it  wasn't
eloquent at all, and is quite uninformed, but for some reason it  worked.  One
time, I "sync"ed and exited the shell I was in, then logged  into another
console (Alt-F2) and tried again.  The other time, I  "sync"ed, "reboot"ed, and
tried it again; it worked.  I don't know why  the menu didn't work for me those
two times, but then again I don't  think that the menu was updated for the 1.03
SLS release.  I could be  wrong...

     That's all I can offer.

Sacrilege! Perl has excellent sys-admin functionality.
Its security checks for suid scripts make them more secure
than some naively written C code. I'm intrigued as to what
features seem to be missing from perl from that documentation.

If there is only a 5-1/4 drive, this doubling cannot be avoided. 
If however the problem is a 3-1/2 B: drive, the solution is simple:
At least with the slackware v1.03 bootdisk (I didn't test any other)
you can boot LINUX from a 3-1/2 B: drive with the help of the bootb
utility.
Either unpack (a remainder from an early SLS distribution)
  clio.rz.uni-duesseldorf.de:linux/sls102/BOOTB.ZIP
under msdos and use it to prepare a 5-1/4 floppy for your A: drive,
or rawrite or dd (the 512 byte (!) result of a bootb usage)
  clio.rz.uni-duesseldorf.de:linux/slack103/BOOT5ATO.3B
to a 5-1/4 floppy.
Then boot with this 5-1/4 floppy in your A: drive and the slackware
3-1/2 bootdisk in B: holding down the left ALT key so you get to
the lilo  boot:  prompt.
There enter
  ramdisk root=/dev/fd1
and lilo will happily load the kernel from B: and the kernel will
happily copy the ramdisk from there.
Hope this helps,

No, I have an even better one. Whenever crond tries to send mail to some

earlier sent mails. Of course, I have removed the original "mail" and
replaced it with a link to elm. Linking it to smail doesn't help at all.
