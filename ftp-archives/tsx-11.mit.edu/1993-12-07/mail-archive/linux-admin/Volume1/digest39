Hello 

I tryed to install Linux 99pl12 SLS 1.03 on an ARC Pentium System
it did not work! The Bord was a combitype EISA / VLB, 1542C 32MB RAM

It hanged at boottime after that line whis trying Alib....

sorry about my English 
Thanx

Okay now.

Since I've gotten Linux up and running on my machine (alas, w/out a HD
bootstrap), I've started porting the C framework to my BBS-package-to-be to
Linux, removing all the DOS-specific junk.  IT IS NOT A BBS YET.  Don't ask me
for a copy because it don't do much.  However, here are the features I had
planned to incorporate:

o Standard UNIX login, controllable sh access by user
o FidoNet front-end and mail tossing/packing (big job tho)
o Any termcap emulation supported, including AVATAR (which I will probably
  have to write myself .. *sigh*)
o File transfers with Zmodem via SZ/RZ

I was also thinking of writing a very simple message editor with obvious
control/function keys along the bottom of the screen, since I only know of two
UNIX editors, and both have a steep learning curve (EMACS and VI).  My main
goal with this was to write a FidoNet front end, actually, since I'm
reasonably well versed (and stocked) with the specs for Fido mailers, having
run one for several years.  I have no plans to put in Usenet mail, because I
have *no* connections to get it, and haven't got a clue how to even set up
something like nn, let alone code one.

What features would you folks like?  The system would probably start
beta-testing around January.  (Hey, folks, I'm taking a full courseload and
working a half-time job, too! :-)  Small features, no major modules just yet,
please.  I'm going to have a hell enough of a time with the FidoNet front-end
and working with database structures for the user/msg/files databases.  And I
don't even yet know how to use the termcap library .. :-)

If anyone has "useful" source code (C or C++, please), mail me, wouldya?  It'd
be appreciated.  Useful meaning something that might be of value in a project
like this.

I'm a diehard sysop but I want Linux and only have one machine! Wah!
Solution: write a BBS in Linux. There we go.

Contact me at dhs1@lehigh.edu, or at 1:2607/203@fidonet.  I'd really like to
get this project rolling, time constraints notwithstanding, so send in your
comments and suggestions!

BTW, someone told me Binkley (the DOS fido front-end) was originally written
for UNIX.  If this is true, does anybody have the source code?  I saw the DOS
version up on a programmer's bbs near me, but it was for DOS ..

I recommend you to get the original groff sources from prep.ai.mit.edu
(pub/gnu/groff-1.08.tar.gz) and install it yourself. It's quite simple.
Besides the PostScript stuff you get some other things, that are missing in
SLS, too. For example, a nice groff previewer for X11.

   Hope, that helps.

Did you change the default settings for irq and i/o-port in the sourcecode
to your settings ?

Did you made the right device for /dev/mcd ?

These are the 2 problems I also had installing the
mcd-driver. After checking these two things all worked
ok.

Bye

I also have a Colorado, and know that the driver is alpha.  But, is there
a way to use GNU tar to backup to floppy?  Kinda like MeSsyDO's backup 
and restore, or Fullback?

                                POLL RESULTS

    Well, for my first major poll I think I did pretty good.  There were
    approximately 213 respondants, we got lots of good stuff!

    There were a number of problems in the poll... answers not on lines
    containing "->" could not be handled.  There were two exceptions: 
    question:  questions 1F and 1D.   Answers placed next to the question 
    rather then to the right of the -> WERE handled.  Next time I will try
    to make it clear that you MUST answer to the right of the "->" fields.
    My statistics program doesn't care about other garbage to the left of
    the "->", but it needs the "->" to determine where the answer begins.

    People who removed or shortened the first line of the question... about 
    5 people, I think... sorry.

    I forgot to ask for serial and mouse info... maybe next time! (like in
    6 months to a year, or somebody else can poll for that info).

    In 1F I made the mistake of sayiung 'EISA or ISA computer? (if not 
    an intel 486)'.  486 machines CAN have ISA busses.  Fortunately, most
    people with that sort of setup typed in ISA anyway for that question.

    Also, some people put in long answers for questions expecting short
    answers... those stats will get chopped off a bit in the generated tables,
    sorry.

    THE POLL RESULTS ARE POSTED IN THE MAIN LINUX GROUPS AND ARE ALSO 
    AVAILABLE VIA ANONYMOUS FTP.  THE ORIGINAL MAIL MINUS THE HEADERS
    IS ALSO AVAILABLE VIA ANONYMOUS FTP:
