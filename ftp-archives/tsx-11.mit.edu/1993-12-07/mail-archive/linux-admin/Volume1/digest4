I have a BusLogic 545S attached to a Tandberg 3600 SCSI tape drive.

Doing a 'tar -c -b 128 . -f /dev/nrmt0' followed by a 'mt weof' makes
the tape drive rewind.

What I want to do is append a new directory path to the current tape
position.

How do I do this?

 I'm in a similar situation. I can run xlock in 'swarm' mode and it
really crawls. This is on a 386-33 with 16 megs ram and a ET4000 ISA
SVGA board. I'm running Xfree386-1.3 color server. I dont believe
system memory is a problem.

I've noticed that xboing runs reasonable fast, whereas xlander or
ico are dreadfully slow. I figured the case for the later two was
that they are floating point intensive. Anyone have a feel for how
much adding a 387 would help the floating point? Is it going
to be 50% faster or 3 times faster?

The standard 'passwd' file can be read by any user.

The passwords are encrypted, but you can find some packages like 'cracklib',
using dictionaries, algorythms and... time, capable to guess some elementary
passwords used by too many users.

These programs are obviously designed for system administrators, to make
security tests... But anyone can use them... :-)

If your machine is used by many  people, it is preferable to hide the
encrypted passwd into a file owned and readable only by root (or setuid root
programs). This is password shadowing.

I personnally prefer the traditionnal passwd file, but as a victim of the
softwares previously described..... I now use shadow-passwds on my machine :-(

Because someone with lots of CPU time on a CRAY can read the encrypted
passwords and do a brute force guessing of passwords through this. If
you are not too afraid for this rare case, indeed it is simpler to use
no shadow password (with its multitude of support programs which
clutter your system). I don't use it; I want to edit just /etc/passwd
to add a user and resent those SYSV-ish administration 'tools' and
scripts. But I grew up with BSD so that might be a reason...

It's not a real problem if your users use "uncrackable" passwords, ie 
non-alphas, mixed case non-dictionary words, long length, etc. where the
increased search space makes brute-force attacks impractical.

Competant users will choose such passwords by themselves, competant
system administrators will force users to choose "uncrackable" passwords
using /bin/passwd replacements like npasswd.

    Dear people,
         ifconfig, setup the ip stuff (works fine)
         ifsetup sets up the option on a device driver ie wd003

With the just newly installed new version of linux, it
seems to me that a) /dev/eth0 is missing b) /dev/wd0 is missing
(and also /dev/inet)

I wish to be able to, with out recompiling linux to
ifsetup -v /dev/eth0 io=280 irq=3 etc.....  
I assume that this is what the programme is for. (ie man ifsetup)

Does any one known what the story is. ??
NB MAKEDEV does not known about /dev/eth0 /dev/wd0 /dev/inet

A week ago I posted a question on getting SLIP working. I got an answer. I

It works for me! 

Notice also that you should set your 'mtu' not too high. I use 256. Otherwise
you may get effects like: 'I can get the first few Kbytes and then the link
blocks'.

If I list the modules in libbsd.a tthen there is no bsd_ioctl in
this lib.
According to Olaf Flebbe I have an old system if I have a file like
<bsd/ioctl> and should upgrade my libc.a to version 4.4.1.
But I installed SLS in the beginning of june, so that must have been
SLS1.02 and I am NOT prepared to do a new installation of 
SLS 1.03 untill all the problems are ironed out by the more
`profesional' hackers.

Well I have worked with Esix before Linux and it can never get as
bad (as Esix) again (I hope).

It's a problem of System V. System V don't know additional groups.
You have to delete all additional group entries for the user, who mounts.
(Root in almost every case.)

We run CRACK on our Un*x systems every so often to catch users with bad

This is a popular and very dangerous myth. A bog standard 386 PC is more
than enough to do effective password cracking by running a dictionary over
a password file. Crack takes a day to run on a 4Mb 386 here (also doing
other work) and the first time I ran it to tighten up our password file
it got 1/3rd of the passwords.

If you did install from SLS and plan to run the cron daemon on your system, be
sure to change the permissions of the directories /usr/spool/cron and 
/usr/spool/cron/crontabs from 1777 to 700. The current permissions allow to
create files like /usr/spool/cron/crontabs/root which are interpreted as
