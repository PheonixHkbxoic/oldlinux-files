Date: 26 Oct 1993 14:31:56 -0700

Greetings.

I just upgraded my kernel to 0.99-13, and I fetched bootutils 0.1 (srce
only?).   I wanted to use bootutils to try and make the ext2fs system
complain (Q 7.6, FAQ).   I did:

1)      Build the bootutils and install it.
2)      Use basically the same rc file as in bootutils/mount/etc/rc.

Linux boots, and e2fsck takes its 10 or so minutes to check the whole
filesystem.   the README of bootutils in mount/README says linux automagically
does a 'umount -a' during shutdown, but I do not think things are working
properly, as e2fsck still takes 10-15 mins each bootup.

Is bootutils really working even if e2fsck still complains?

Is bootutils 0.1 the latest version?

am I going to have to mount a floppy with umount so I can umount root?

Thanks to all for your continued help.
Ronan

No it isn't working. What you have to do is modify the kernel image to initially
mount the file system read only. You can do this by typing 'rdev -R kernelname 0'
or something close to that (I can't remember where the 0 goes). Not all versions
of rdev support the -R option, there should have been one included with
bootutils I believe.

   Please ignore the fact that the IP address in the ifconfig is different
from the address assigned by the TS, this is not so. (it happened
because i pasted a log from an older TS session)

   Thanks again! 

P.S. I have tried different MTU values and also with and w/o -DSL_COMPRESS

I've just found a program called 'chat', written by ml@brumuc.muc.sub.org
which I've 'ported' to linux in the last hour (just changed it to use
ncurses, and had to '#undef refresh' actually).  It uses named pipes
so I guess it doesn't need TCP/IP?  I haven't tested it other than
to prove I can chat to myself on another VT.

It even has an english/german option!

If there is a huge amount of interest in this I guess I could post
it somewhere, though I only have rudimentary and expensive net access.

Date: 27 Oct 1993 08:38:46 GMT

I recently bought a nice notebook for using Linux everywhere. Now I would
like to get a connection to my main linux box. Probably PLIP is the cheapest
solution. I prepared the necessary null printer cable and compiled the PLIP
support in the kernel but I did not manage to get a connection.

Is there anybody who ha setup a connection via PLIP sucessfully? Please
send me your setup files (/etc/hosts, rc.net, ...) via e-mail.

What transfer speed can I expect from PLIP? Perhaps it makes more sense to
buy a D-LINK adapter?

Most likely the shell of the username you are using is not included in
/etc/shells.
