I was having this exact problem.  I just upgraded my modem from a 2400 baud
to a 14400 baud.  When I ran uucico with a debug level of at least 2 (-x 2)
everything worked.  When uucico was run at a debug level below that I got
"ERROR: character not echoed" in my log file.

My solution...  I added a delay between the "AT" and the "OK" of my Dialers
chat script.  Now everything works great.

Hopefully this will work for some of you as well.

Subject: mv feature?
Date: Wed, 3 Nov 1993 18:50:27 GMT

I haven't seen this mentioned so...

On pl12 and with the e2fs file system, doing mv `dir1' `dir2'
with two existing directories, will actually move dir1 and all that is
under it to dir2!

Normal mv behavior does not allow relinking directories into different
places in the hierarchy.

Is this a feature? It certainly is unexpected behavior. E.g. i
commonly perform the following (sloppy) set of commands:

        cd dir
        md subdir
        cp * subdir

expecting some error message like `dir is a directory' on subdirs and
therefore leaving them alone and simply moving all regular files in
dir to subdir.

Subject: Xmh for linux
Date: 3 Nov 93 18:36:26 GMT

I just installed the latest slackware version.  Everything is 
up and running fine except for mail.  I modified the smail stuff
so that I can receive mail, but am not able to send mail via 
'mail'.  Also, I can not use Rmail from Emacs.  I tried to use 
Xmh, but received a bunch of errors, which led me to believe that
mh was not installed on the machine (there was no 'inc' file).

So I ftp'd the mh 6.8.1 distribution and tried to install it.  But it
gave me some errors (the installation was quite a chore, but make inst-all
failed in the end).

Does anyone have this working?  

I have a direct Ethernet connection, so have not need for UUCP stuff,
which the HOWTO's seem to spend most of their time on.

Is there anyone who can help me with this?

(the next step will of course be to set up Cnews :( )

Thanks,

Justin

I made up some "reference-cards" under xfig for beginners and people migrating 
from DOS and VMS systems. Basic Unix and X11 stuff to get you going and allow 
you to learn how to help yourself. If there is interest I will post it (hence
why I posted this note :). Otherwise let me know if you want them and I can Email
you postscript versions (or fig if you prefer).

        adios

I managed to fix smail's behaviour(so far anyway): I got the sources

I recompiled it. I think there was a problem in the way smail was cacheing
/etc/passwd entries caused by the version of the include files, the dynamic
libraries etc. I didn't have to make changes to the code, so it was just
something funky with the compilation.

Subject: Help! Name lookup failure.
Date: 3 Nov 1993 18:33:19 GMT



        I just installed Slackware (from ftp...) and am having the same
problem that SLS 1.03 was having.

        If I type "nslookup eris.cs.umb.edu" it comes back with the
correct address for the nameserver and the machine, eris in this case.
        BUT, If I type ftp eris.cs.umb.edu, it says "Unknown host".
What gives? If the resolv.conf is setup correctly, nslookup works fine.
And I can always use the IP number, so the routing tables are correct.
What else can I do?


Thanx in advance.

Brian Pedranti

Post here or reply to me directly, doesn't matter.

Subject:  Quota -1.1
Date: Wed, 3 Nov 1993 20:28:16 GMT

I am experienceing some difficulties with the quotaing system.

Symptoms:
        added kernel patches to virgin 0.99.13 sources (ok no failures there)
        make config wth quota's on
        make dep and zImage
        run /etc/lilo/install
        reboot (all well and fine at this point)

        cd /usr/src/quota
        make clean/install (everything is going fine no problems)
        
        edited /etc/fstab to taste and ran quotacheck -augv (files created successfully)
        now then,.... 
        ----------
                edquota -u m_oddity
                Warning: Quotas are not compiled into this kernel
        Quotas for user m_oddity:
        /dev/sda1: blocks in use: 4, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)
                inodes in use: 1, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)

                inodes in use: 11036, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)
        ----------
        after editting the file to taste, I try quota -u m_oddity
                Disk quotas for user m_oddity (uid 6199): none
        Arrrraagghhh!
