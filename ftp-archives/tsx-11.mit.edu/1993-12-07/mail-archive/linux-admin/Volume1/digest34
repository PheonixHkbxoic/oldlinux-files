   MS-DOS also won't print to some printers because it thinks they're always off
   or are on only until the printer actually prints something... there appear to
   be some standards problems in the area of flow control signaling.  I saw this
   on several PCs including a true IBM XT.

   Of course, not being the author of the parallel driver, I don't know if that's
   actually related.

Being one of the authors of the parallel driver, I can say that is
likely to be exactly the problem.  The driver does the error detection
it does because it made it least likely to completely fail on the
largest number of cards.  I spent a lot of time tracking down little
inconsistancies from one card to another.  Unfortunately, parallel
port designers have tended towards the most minimally standard and
minimally functional design they can get away with.  YUCK!

If you don't like the way it works, you will have to edit lp.c and
re-work the error checking so that you can tell if you are off.  The
names of the bits are in lp.h, and the rest will have to be done by
trial and error, and then you can make a diff that you can apply to
each set of kernel source you get.  Since it will screw some people
over, please don't ask to have it in the standard distribution... :-/

Best of luck!

I found that in the SLS 1.03 distribution /etc/rhosts, the code:
        if [ "$IPADDR" != "" ]; then
                if [ "" != "$ROUTER" ]; then
                        ROUTERPARM="gw $ROUTER";
                fi

set up ROUTERPARM if the router line was uncommented in /etc/hosts,
but ROUTERPARM was never used.  Adding:
        route add default $ROUTERPARM
after
        route add $NET $IPDEV

seemed to fix the problem.

Subject: News FAQ Lack of tcpip support.



This is some feed back to Vince Skahan's News Howto / FAQ
for me it lacks some usefull notes hints on howto configure NNTP/News over
TCPIP connections. Most of the books that are avaiable are also very bad
In that there is only info on how to setup news feeds via UUCP
Since a lot of us are Internet connected, it makes no sence for me
to contact my local UUCP partner for config help.
I dont have one,
Contacts via the news groups so far has been a wast of time.
again mostly one only gets silly RTFM replies. Not a lot of help.
So.

Many thanks for the FAQ on mail...
I have read RTFM on NNTP all the availiable man pages Your news faq
the Creaig Hunt Book
I still cant figure out how to configure Cnews with NNTP-1.5.11
Im useing SLS - 103 base + TIN
I can post with TIN i can read with TIN
I can connect with TCPIP socket 119 and do IHAVE <mid>
I can also do POST
all works..

But if i do NEWNEWS <group> date-time  distr

I get an error bad distr.

If i do the same but with out  distr
eg. NEWNEWS ampr 920101 010000 GMT

I get Instant session closed. ??
WHY ???   RTFM is fine but its not in the FM.
nntpd does a core dump.?


Also if another system calls
askes for newnews
it sometimes sends the
newnews follows etc
. 
 dot cos i have no new news.
the other system tries to send i have  and this results in QUIT.
 WHY ??   not in C.Hunt book or FAQ's
Sometimes Ihave <mid>
is met with 350 OK.
and then never askes for the ARTICLE.
just goes direct to
250 Thanks.



also i cant figure out how to get the nntp server to post news down stream
OK this is in the FM but all biased to UUCP and not a thing on tcpip soc 119
connects.

I do use the sample.crontab

I have lots more FQ's that are not in the FM (RTFM) or any FAQ.

Can you help or tell me who might.?  the news nntp groups have not given help
at all except RTFM's

Im sick of haveing stupid replys saying RTFM etc. I HAVE.

MFBM

Ok thats my feed back on your FAQ for news/mail

So any offers of help ??
Im sure there must be some systems on Internet tcpip i cant believe that You
Lot on this group are ALL UUCP nodes.
Na.. maybe ...?

Barry.

Subject: [HELP] tar and compression
Date: Fri, 3 Sep 1993 07:18:41 GMT

Hi Wizzes:

I know that my question is not relevant to Linux, but please help me out if
you can. I failed to find a suitable (unmoderated) newsgroup for GNU utilities
or for GNU Tar.

The question is this. I'm using GNU Tar 1.11.2, and I don't seem to be
able to get the compression working when making tape backups to a remote unit
(i.e., across the net, indirectly using rsh which is started by tar).
The typical error messages are, "can't close device (128,-1)" or "IO error".
Another distressing one is "tar (child): archive at EOF not at block
boundary".

Any suggestions? The strange thing is, that backups without compression seem
to work ok.. but whenever attempting compression with either -z (gzip) or -Z
(compress), the child program tar, which reads the data back from the
compression program, seems to go haywire (or for that matter, possibly the
compression program goes haywire).

Any suggestions are welcome -
Karel.

Subject: Long shadow passwords less secure than normal ones?
Date: Thu, 2 Sep 1993 20:42:55 GMT

Hi,

I recently looked through the source of the shadow-packet and discovered
that, given a password longer than 8 characters, the routine pw_encrypt
simply splits it into two parts, one being the first 8 characters, the other
being the rest. These get encrypted separatly, and the result is stored
separatly.

This looks like an invitation for a security hole to me - most people (me
included) tend to think "A long password is a good password". And, as we all
know, a password should containn some punctuation and some non-letters. Now
lets say I take "RecEiver:9@" as my password. This will be an easy one for
Crack. One part that is encrypted is just some variation of "receiver", the
other one is only three characters long.

So the long passwords in the current shadow implementation look more like
two passwords to Crack, one of which can probably broken by brute force
(even the second part of a 13 character password could be found within a
couple of hours), the other one probably less obscured by digits/punctuation
than a standard one.

My advice for system administrators thus seems to be: "Either force your
users to use REALLY long words and make sure that they know the way the
passwords are encrypted, or recompile the shadow stuff without the option
for long passwords enabled."

If I remeber the purpose of shadow passwords correctly, the shadow 
password file is root read only (the regular passwd file is still
there, but passwords are in separate file).  No one else could read it.  So,
unless someone makes the blatant goof of making it world readable,
there should be no problem.  No one could get the file to crack it.

This is normal if there is no job currently being printed, at least
in my experience with Sparcstations and an HP9000.

It might be worth mentioning here that at least some versions of Xfree
require the -pn option in order to start up without TCP present.  I've been
told that -pn is the default with Xfee86 1.3, but I haven't verified it.
You use it like:

xinit -- -pn  (or startx -- -pn)

OK, well, how does one change the default prompt for the MCC distribution,
.99pl10?  It looks like this 23:26:09>.  It's the time and I'd like mine 
to show what directory I'm in, like this: host>etc>docs>.  And then when 
I move up one directory level, I want it to show host>etc>.  This is more 
useful than always being told what time it is, to the second.

Same problems over here. But we solved them.

There is a weird problem with ifconfig.
You must provide a broadcast address with 0's. ifconfig
automatically define 255's. So change the ifconfig line in rc.net to:

  ifconfig eth0 130.161.145.230 up netmask 255.255.0.0 broadcast 130.161.0.0

So explicitly state those 0's in broadcast.
After this the regular route commands should follow:

  route add 130.161.0.0 130.161.145.230
  route add default gw 130.161.180.25 metric 1
  
Insert your own network numbers of course.

Hope this helps.



Richard.
