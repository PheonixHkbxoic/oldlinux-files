Subject: Can't run VI
Date: Wed, 17 Nov 1993 05:34:48 GMT

When I log in as a user "other then root" I cannot use programs
such as VI.  I get into VI but cannot edit a file.
The message I get when I open a file, for example a file name 'test'
is the following:

        garbage() failed to read oldhdr?? [More...] 
        "test" [READONLY] 1 line, 1 char [More...]
        Trouble writing to tmp file 

This problem just occured when I tried to install a "csh" program
that I got from the Internet.  I think some files were corrupted
while I was installing the "csh" program.
Any ideas??????????

Find and compile ytalk, it does wonders for being able to talk to machines
that use both the old talk system, as well as the new talk system.  I'm
not sure where I got it, but it compiled VERY cleanly on my roommate's
linux machine.

Well, this machine is running 0.99.13p with the networking utilities
on the Yggdrasil CD-ROM.  It's been up almost continuously since Oct. 26,
and I've had absolutely no problems with the network code, other than stuff

Since 0.99.13k, the networking stuff has been stable for me. :)  I get a full

that goes through this site is considerable.  About 400MB a week, all of it
via the net.

I don't think this machine was on sale the last time an Hardware
Compatibility list came by, so, can anybody tell me if they have
had any experience of trying to get Linux to compile/run on the

        Gateway 2000, P5-60  (Pentium with PCI-bus)

Are there even Linux device drivers for PCI-bus cards ?
If it's not possibly to run Linux on such a machine now, will it
be in the future (near or distant ?) ?

Most can -- but what about the firmware on the SCSI boards, if any?

The Alpha kernel already has the ability to send generic SCSI commands.
Receiving, i.e. target mode, would be a very good idea, if at all possible.

You don't need a file system for this. Just take a disk and use
one partition for a->b and another for b->a.  Managing free block
lists is left as an exercise (it's fairly easy, actually).

On the other hand, any bidirectional traffic means that the thing
would constantly be thrashing between these partitions. Using two
disks is a somewhat suboptimal solution.

The other problem is that you still need a way to notify B that A has just 
stored some data on the shared disk. Either you have target mode, and then
you don't need the disk, or you string a separate (serial? the SCSI bus has
a few spare wires anyway ;-) cable between the boxes and send a character.

That reminds me -- I had a massive differential SCSI cable between the living 
room and the kitchen (the disks were too loud and a long monitor cable gave a 
fuzzy picture) using twisted-pair flat cable. Ethernet between the two? Easy 
 -- grab two pairs of wire from the bus and run 10base-T. Serial? Another 
pair. The remaining two free pairs were used for the ISDN bus between the two 
rooms.  ;-)

They are *generic* attributes, not *driver specific*, therefore they
go before the ";" like this:

uux:    driver =pipe,
        inet,                     # change to Internet stype addressing from
        from,                           # supply a From_ envelope line
        max_addrs = 50,                 # at most 5 addresses per invocation
        max_chars = 200,                # at most 200 chars of addresses

        ;

        cmd = "/usr/bin/uux - -r -g$grade $host!rmail $((${strip:user})$)",
        umask = 0022,
        pipe_as_sender


I got burned by this a few times too.  :-)


OK, here's another hint if you're hacking smail files a lot:  The
syntax allows you to end a line with a separator, even if another
attribute follows.  So if you're playing around with a configuration,
it's convenient to exploit this to be able to simply comment and
uncomment lines.  To do this, format your entries like this:

name:   
        driver = foo,
        someattr,
        anotherattr = bar,
        ;
        cmd = "/bin/something",
#       color = red,
        color = green,

Each attribute is on its own line, and ends with a comma, even the
last one.  The semicolon is on it's own line, which makes it obvious
where the generics end and the specifics begin.  Each attribute can be
easily switched on or off by removing or adding the '#' at the start
of the line.

Subject: SCSI timeouts: worse on a different machine
Date: Tue, 16 Nov 1993 19:04:24 GMT
Reply-To: dan@dyndata.com


I posted before about seeing "SCSI timeout - command aborted" errors
when running my tape drive and hard disk at the same time when running
multiuser.  The post generated a lot of "I'm seeing that too"
responses but not anything pointing to a solution.  I just resigned
myself to having to shut the machine down to do backups and restores.

Until I installed Linux on a second machine.

The second machine is a 486DX33 instead of a 486DX50, and the SCSI
timeout error will appear sometimes even if the tape drive is not
running.  :-(  Both machines have 1542B controllers.  The 33 has Linux
99.13, and the 50 has Linux 99.12.

Is there anything that can be done about this?  I know I'm not the
only one having the problem, and it seems to be fairly serious in that
it can corrupt the filesystem.

Are there any SCSI driver wizards around that can explain what's
happening?

Anybody have any suggestions?

This question is system dependend. Slackware offers a pkgtool to
easily rm packages.
But uninstalling XFree is normally easy, since all related programs
are usually found in 

        /usr/X386

So a rm -r /usr/X386 should help (done as root).

other places might be (usually only symbolic links):

        /usr/bin/X11
        /usr/lib/X11
        /usr/include/X11

And possibly X11 related libraries in /lib or /usr/lib.
And perhaps some manpages contaning the letter 'X' in 
/usr/man ....

There is a very neat port of it using some kernel changes to /proc on sunsite
It has a couple of minor problems but seems pretty good. I've merged the kernel

This last statement isn't true.  In general, in the FFS, the file
consists of 0 or more blocks, plus 0-7 fragments, where both the
blocksize and fragment size can vary.

Thus I could have a 18K file which consists of 2 full 8K blocks, and 2
1K fragments.  The other 6 fragments from the block *my* fragments
were allocated are available as fragments for other files.

        I agree.  I downloaded the 0.99pl13r kernel sources last night.
Nowhere on ftp.funet.fi could I find a description of what changes had
been made in going pl13p to pl13r.  This type of information would be
extremely usefull for determining whether or not to download a 
specific release.  The readme file with the sources only describes the
base pl13 changes and has nothing about the a-r patches.  Did I just,
miss where the information is?  As an example, if I had not been
watching the tar output, I would not have known that the sound drivers
where included in the 13r release and would have probably over written
those with the seperate sound distribution.
