I use vgacopy to copy directly 3.5" to 5.25" now for a longer time and
run both formats in parallel. Under Linux you just have to use the
corresponding /dev/fd* name, that's all.
Booting works only with correctly (1.2MB) formated disks with that technique.

Here are my expiriences:

I hadn't any problems with different drives so far. Computers with both
diskdrives understand also the high formated 5.25" disks whithout
additional software under DOS, too. If you have only one 5.25" drive you need
the fdread (or vgaread) program.

That's correct. In the last time I get more and more sector not found or
other similar disk errors, when transfering my disks to an other computer.

I agree, too. Lot's of disks get damaged and I get read and write errors
frequently. Especially if the disks get older, it's really a problem :-(

I do it only if I get filled 3.5" installation disks and I'm forced to do, so.
Maybe I should really by an 3.5" disk soon :-(.

So from my long time experience with this, I wouldn't recommend it, too.
Just use it if you have no other choice, only.

HI,

I just installed the latest release of LINUX, 99.12, and love it.  The only 
problem I am having is getting the SLIP connection going.  The environment I 
have is as follows.

                     -----------------
                     | Home PC       |
                     | IP Address is |
                     | 192.94.40.246 |
                     -----------------
                            | Telephone line
                            |
                     ---------------------------
                     | Decserver 300           |
                     | Port IP Address         |
                     | 192.94.40.246 (static)  |
                     | Terminal servers IP     | 
                     | Address is 192.94.40.18 |
                     ---------------------------

Simple configuration.  I am using DIP and don't understand which address to give 
for remote?  Can the address give for local in DIP be the same as the address 
specified for the port on the DECSERVER 300?  Why would Linux need the address 
of the DECSERVER 300?  Is DIP setup more for host based SLIP instead of Terminal 
server type?  I can't find any documentation on the pointopoint argument to
ifconfig.  I know there is two kinds of SLIP connections and with a DECSERVER
300 the only choice I have is a non routing configuration.  In other words
only one node could be attached to the DECSERVER not another network.  I don't 
know the terminology for this.  Anyway, I would love it if someone could send be 
the DIP, ifconfig, and route commands to make this work.  Also, if someone has 
set this up on a DECSERVER 300, I would love to have the port setup they used 
and what kind of flow control setup was used on the modem.  If anyone would need 
more information let me know.  Yes I did read the NET-2-FAQ thoroughly.

Thanks a ton,

Subject: crontab entry for sendmail?
Date: Thu, 30 Sep 1993 15:22:02 GMT


I'm trying to set up mail over a TCP/IP link using smail/sendmail
included with SLS 1.03.  Reading the Network Administrator's Guide, 
everything seems to be clear except that at the bottom of page 179 it 
says

"   With this setup, you still have to make sure the mail queue is
processed periodically. This can be done by adding the following line to
root's crontab:

10  *  *   *   *   /usr/lib/sendmail -q >/dev/null "

Unfortunately, this means nothing to me. I don't seem to have a man page
for crontab (or cron for that matter), and the smail/sendmail man page
doesn't mention this. The System Adminstrators Guide simply refers me to
the missing manpage.  :( 

Could someone plese help a novice on this? Thanks.

Jim

Read "The Cuckoo's Egg" by Cliff Stoll for an excellent example of a bug
like this in an older version of Emacs.

Information like the Gecos field (contains full name of user), home
directory location (for shells and tools with ~user expansion), and
the mapping of user and group id's to user and group names (for the ls
command) would become impossible. Some tools will probably break, for
example elm, complains about "You have no passwd entry". The passwd
access routines are designed to be world accessible and unix
programs rely on that since the very beginning.

The passwd entry is the only critical entry in /etc/passwd. The shadow
method is a solution to that. Another solution is NIS+ from SUN,
which let you define access rights per column (among other things).

i hope i am in the right newsgroup.
i hear from a friend that linux is the system to be able to get unix/xwindows 
on a 386 machine.  is this true?  if not, do you have any suggestions?  i would
like to be able to run an sgi machine remotely from my computer over a slip 
server.  if this is possible please let me know and tell me where i could get 
this os.
thanks,

Reply-To: hb15@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de

Hello 

I'm still a little bit confused where I should locate this query.
I hope this newsgroup fits.

The problem I run into is that we program some interprocess SW which
passes messages in between some processes and the processes use a
shared memory too. Since Linux hasn't a tool like 'ipcs' or 'iprm' 
the only way to get rid of unusable queues and shared memory 
is a reboot! :-\

Does anybody know how I can handle this problem in a more accurate way?
Or is there somewhere a free bundle of 'ipc' tools?

Subject: (followpu) problems with mitsumi
Date: Fri, 1 Oct 93 09:30:19 GMT


Judging from the replies I got, I was not clear at all in my 
question - so I'll try to explain myself better.

Now I am running SLS 1.03, and at boot time I use the command line
boot: linux mitsumi=11,0x300
which let me see the cdrom. 

I got 0.99.13 kernel and I compiled them eliminating SCSI support,
network support and other things I don't have nor I need. I
retained the "Enable mitsumi" and "ISO9660" options, of course.
I had made zImage, copied to /zImage2 and added to lilo that
image, with the name linux13.

Now, if I boot with linux13 mitsumi=11,0x300 the system works
*except* for cdrom support (the message "mitsumi init failed"), while
linux mitsumi=11,0x300 keeps working with the old kernel. 

I tried to add some printk lines to mcd.c, and the kernel could
not decompress anymore. 

By the way, is there a chance to try mcd.c without putting it into 
the kernel? It could be easier for me to debug it...

        It makes no difference what mailer use <Elm, mail, etc>,
