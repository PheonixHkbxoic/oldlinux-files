I had the same problem.  I circumvented (sp?) it by booting at low speed.  It

        I thought about suggesting this, but didn't.  The simple reason is
that the legality of PGP use (at least in the USA) is still under question.
I personally hope (pray) that public key cryptography will become widely and
cheaply available with no restrictions; but I don't want the Linux community
to establish a "standard" distribution mechanism that requires this to
happen.  Maybe the patent holders in the USA (PKP?) won't come after
individuals that infringe; but if I was a commercial distributer of Linux
systems (SLS, Slackware, etc.) I don't think I would want to "bet my
business" on this.  If these distributers don't use whatever "standard"
mechanism we come up with then we may not be able to generate sufficient
momentum to make it happen.  Of course, maybe they are willing to take that
risk (or in some cases aren't based in the USA and may not be at risk).
Still I think this issue is worth considering.

Date: Tue, 28 Sep 1993 16:41:56 GMT

I'm curious why _ALL_ modules must be recompiled when any options are
reconfigured for the kernel? The primary reason for using make it so
only modules with changes need to be recompiled. By having all modules
recompiled it takes hours instead  of minutes to do this job.

I do understand the the config process requires that the dependences
need to be recheck on _ALL_ modules. But, why has the process been
set so that _ALL_ dependencies are updated, instead of just where 
there have been changes?

I am a person who _LIKES_ to waste time. But I prefer to be able to
choose my vices. And, waiting for the kernel to compile is not one
of my choices, expecially considering I wish to tinker after I get
my system setup the way I want it.

Color me curious!

Since I seem to have started this, I now need to say that I have gotten a
copy of the Slackware release along with the 5 1/4" boot disks. This
installation (except for some problems with LILO) went smoothly and I will
continue to use Slackware for my upgrading.

Hello,

well, what follows is my opinion and not an order :-)

Oki, there are some things that this PC *must* be:

- It must have a processor 386sx/16 or higher (intel, amd .. whatever)
- I think you must have at least 2 MB RAM
- A Harddisk bigger than 20 MB (for basic systems)

You will not get very far with these minimum requirements. I would suggest
you get a 486dx or dx2. A 386 can do it, too, but as you will need to
compile a lot with linux (kernel updates all the time), you better go for a
486, since 386 are not much cheaper. For memory: get 8 MB if you will not use
X windows and 16 MB if you want to. You can run X with 8 MB (even with 4 I
heard), but it won't be very pleasant. Harddisk: get at least a 245 MB drive,
IDE or SCSI. Get SCSI if you want to use several disks, cdroms, scsi tapes
or if you simply want to ensure you can move the HardDisk when switching to
another computer system (which will support scsi for most cases). Note: IDE
drives are not slower than scsi ones (well, depends on what model of course).
Monitor: get at least a 15" model .. I would go for a 17" monitor, which is
ideal for 1024x768. The video card: get an accelerated one. Linux runs
with most cards, X with many. I would suggest an S3 chip based cards, since
they offer good speed at good prices. Avoid diamond cards (well, not all are
bad, but you won't get into trouble hopefully without a diamond card).
Especially don't buy a viper: this one is fast, but will maybe never get
drivers in Xwindows. I'm using an orchid VA vlb, and it gives me great speed
under Xwin (there are a *lot* of other nice S3 cards, the best are the S3 928
based ones). Floppy drives: at least a 3.5" drive. Buy a 5.25 drive only if
you need compatibility to your friends 5.25" disks or similar. Then, get a
mouse (needed for Xwin or selection, a cut'n'paste "driver" for terminal use).
Linux supports many mice, even bus mice.
Note that I didn't cite a minimal konfiguration, but with this system you
will have no problems originating from hardware. An estimated price would
be ranging from 2000 to 3000 US$, you may even find it for less (also for mor
:)). If you need more details, send me a mail or ask people on #linux in IRC.
Hope I helped you a bit.

Philippe

PS: I would not buy anything less than the above :) It's more expensive at the
    start, but you won't regret it.

If I was to upload a BAD program somewhere, I don't think any one would
catch the hidden feature, be it in source or binary form. Those who
think so are dreaming. Currently the MSDOS world is taken by storm by
all kind of virus (It is a way of life
these days). Don't believe that a BAD program will show its bad side
within five minutes. It may be months. And it may even do its hidden
things randomly once in a while.

And of course, do not believe that the BAD part of the program
will be surrounded with lots of comments in the source code. With
clever use of the C preprocessor, one can hide bad code to even
to most talented programmer. Hidding bad code in 10000 lines
is very easy. (Especially when all is BAD spaghetti code :-) )

On the other hand, if I was to create such a Bad program, I would
look for something else than a FTP site, simply because there is
too much chance someone track me as the author.

And if I am not the author, I won't put my name on a package by
uploading it to a FTP site (unless I know the author and I know why
he can't do it himself).

One thing the FTP site should do, is put (make sure) the email
adresse and name of the uploader with each package. The is normally
done by uploader.

At US4BINR (archive for SVR4 Binaries), I do a two way communication.
Each uploader must send me email to upload. I then respond with
a positive or negative answer (if the package is already available).
The uploader then send the bits in. With this kind a trafics, there
is simply to much risk for a BAD guy.

Comments welcome!!

Hi !

Well - here is my solution to install the slackware dist. without an 3.5" disc.
There is a tool for MS-DOS called "fdformat" and "fdread"
It must be available on many ftp-sites.
This tool allows you to format 5.25" discs with more capacity and with
"FDFORMAT A: /F144" you can format your 5.25" floppy like a 3.5" floppy.
(you must have installed the fdread-driver before, of course)
Then you are able to use "RAWRITE" to make your slackware bootdisk.
Now you have to "FDFORMAT" the other disks up to 1.44 MB and write the
slackware stuff on them.
Finaly you have to reboot your computer and run the setup program to tell
him that your 5.25" drive is an 1.44 drive - and SURPRISE :

YOU ARE ABLE TO BOOT AND INSTALL THE SLACKWARE RELEASE WITH THE 5.25" FLOPPY !!

At leaset that works for me (386/40 with AMI-BIOS)

bye,

Markus

        O'Reilly & Associates, Sebastopol, 1993
        ISBN 0-937175-80-3 
        to be very helpful in this area.  Lars' SAG seems to be progressing
        along the same vein as the other books in the Linux Documentation
        Project, which is to say "most excellent" and will undoubtedly, like
        the others, far outstrip anything else on the market in terms of
        readability, accuracy, detailed analysis, and real-life applicability.
        But, as Lars makes very clear, it is still in ALPHA release.  Thus,
        for the interim, I have found the aforementioned book to be most
        useful in that it presents many variants of *nixen, from SVR4 to
        BSD, to SunOs , Xenix, and even "also"-ix from a certain vendor based
        in New York!  Since Linux has taken the best from SVR4 and BSD as
        well as blazed some new ground, this is a good place to start, in 
        my opinion.

In typical end-user configurations, the address doesn't matter, as
long as it's on the right network.  As a hack, try adding one to your
IP address and using that as the server's address.  (Technically this
is buggy, since it will fail if you end up with x.x.x.254, but it's
probably good enough.  At many sites, another reasonable approach
would be to remove the last octet of your address and replace it with
1.  That's probably easier to implement in a script.)

What I do is run KA9Q and have it do bootp.  It prints out both my
address and the server's address.  Setting up KA9Q is probably more
than you want to go through just to get the server address right, but
it will work.  I've got the right version of KA9Q (I made a slight
change to get it to print both addresses) and the script (startnet) on
athos:/pub/linux.  But I think that's more trouble than it's worth.

Hi nettors,

I am interested in installing Linux on a 386/486 machine with 4-8 MB ram
and about 340 MB HD.  I used to follow this newsgroup and it has been
quite a while since I have read any items in these groups.

I understand that the SLS version is available on 3.5 disks.  If so
could one of you send me an email about procuring it.  I need all the
utils including X, gcc, all tools, sources etc etc. 

There was some DOCUMENTATION effort goiong on in Linux.  Has that group
produced the results of that effort i.e. The "LINUX BIBLE".

Answers to the abopve questions are appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

novell ne2000 card. The other was a no-name black box 40 mhz 386 with an
adaptec scsi card and a _novell_ne200_card_. NONE of the adresses or irq's
appeared to conflict. I solved my problem by changeing the novell card to
use 300h and irq5, (supposedly a non-standard setting, but it works).
The troubleshooting was vexing..different kernels..6 mchines...differnent
