cp /usr/X386/lib/X11/Xconfig.1M Xconfig

set your mouse entry

just keep pressing CTRL-ALT-+ until you get a config you like.  The
modes are named "1", "2", etc.  CTRL-ALT-+ cycles through the modes.
After you find one/some you like, remove the other modes from the
mode line.  I went with mode "20" on my old NEC IId.

My SLIP connection is now working reliablym with no problems not caused by
my own confusion but...its slower than I hoped (eg 12-14kbps effective on a
nominal 38.4kps connection, on GIFS which should compress fairly well). 
Watching the lights yields what I'd expect (receive on continuously, an
occassional flash on transmit) so...

Is there any way existing tool that will dump error counts,
retransmissions/duplicates, etc.  Netstat does that on many systems, but
apparently not this one.

If I missed this written down some place, feel free to flame me, but please
tell me _where_ while you're doing it.

Too bad. Looks like you worked on a not clean filesystem. I ran into the same
problem with SLS 1.0.1. The standard mount and fsck programs are so dumb, 
that they doesn't force a filesystem check, if the fs is unsane.
This is the normal case on a commercial Unix system. Not so with
"standard Linux".

All you get is a warning "mounting unclean fs running fsck is recommended"
or similar.

Slackware and probably other Linux Packages have therefore the package
bootutils-0.1 included into the distribution. If the filesystem status of 
a fs is unsane, then a fs check runs automatically prior mounting any 
filesystem. After changing from SLS 1.0.1 to Slackware I hadn't any 
filesystem problem any more.

I recommend you to backup your user data. But keep the last backups,
because some files might be modified. Too bad if that happens to
zipped tar (source) archives ... this was the case when I ran SLS....

Install bootutils - you get from Linux ftp servers - and make a complete
new fs from scratch (mke2fs ...). After that restore your data.

A better idea would be to get the Slackware 1.1.0 release with 
the new gcc 2.5.2 compiler, ld.so and XFree-2.0 ! But keep your
t1-t3 disks. Slackware comes without TeX. But you can easily
install the SLS TeX package using Slackware's pkgtool.

Did you read the docu closely ?
Did tou try the Xconfig values for the Prodesigner card from

Did you try the monitor data about NEC 3D from the modeDB.txt file ?
Did you redirect the stdout/stderr of startx to a file to look more
closely to errors ?
Did you make sure, that your Fontpath is setup correctly in Xconfig ?
Did you choose a proper mouse definition in Xconfig ?

I can't believe, that you can't get it running with all that information
included in Xconfig and the modeDB.txt file !!!

The most difficult things (creating correct entries for card and
monitor are ready to use for you in modeDB.txt.

And next time it would be very fine, if you would tell a bit more
about your configuration and what you have configured already.
Then it would be much more fun and more easier to help you
instead of asking everything that could prevent you from running
X11.

BTW: Are you using the correct X11 Server ?Look where the symlink
/usr/lib/X11/X is pointing to !

Good luck !

Here is one I use for just text.  I am still working on setting things
up for postscript.  All you have to do is compile the following C
program and set up your /etc/printcap similar to mine and you should
be able to print text.


filename: /var/spool/hplj.c

/* "hplj", a HP LaserJet PRINT FILTER */

/* This is brain dead it uses:           */

#define _POSIX_SOURCE 1

#include <stdio.h>

main ()
{

int     d_char;

printf("\033E\033&k2G");

while ((d_char=getchar()) != EOF)
   putchar(d_char);

printf("\033E");
}

Maybe you are checking a mounted filesystem...

This is not a fault/deficiency/whatever of the mount or fs-utils.
If you check the /etc/rc file that comes with SLS, it mentions
something like:
should check filesystems here.

The programs in the bootutils package have found successors in
a package called something like utils-etc.

I suggest booting from floppy, use a floppy rootdisk, and check 
the unmounted filesystems on the harddisk. If no errors are reported,
you are in the clear...

This seems a little overkill to me. Just get a mount that supports 
the remount option, and an rdev that handles the -R flag to mount
the root filesystem read-only. The doc's in the util-etc (and bootutils)
package tell exactly what to do with them...

If you want a clever lpfilter for Hp Laserjets, then look into

Main feature is automatic file type recognition and printing
ps files automatically on non-ps-printers which are supported

Neither could I.  The problem turned out to be my mouse.  The X
server wouldn't start up until I had my mouse correctly configured,
and I had rather boneheadedly plugged it into COM2 and configured
it for COM1.

Sorry for the bother, and thanks for the responses.  I do like

        I doubt it.  You should not be trying to run Linux with the extended
mapping in the first place - Adaptec only recommends that this be used with
DOS-only systems.  It is possible to use all of a >1Gb disk with linux without

You will need the newer libc4.4 or better.  Don't get the source
kit, get just the binary kit.  (oops...)  The only problem that
I has with installing XF2.0 (a great program) was that someone
(when creating the SLS distribution) forgot to link the 'ln' command
