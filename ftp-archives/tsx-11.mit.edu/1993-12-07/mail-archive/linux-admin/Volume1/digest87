The point is some 5.25" drives support variable gap sizes, while others only
allow fixed gap sizes.  The easy way to tell if it works is to try it.  On my
machine it doesn't work, on yours it does.

Two things to make sure of: you must be booting with your root
partition readonly, and you must be using at least version 0.3 of
e2fsck.

If root is being mounted readonly, you will get a message
        VFS: mounting root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
at startup.  If it misses the 'readonly' bit, then root is being
mounted writeable, and you should add a 'read-only' flag to the
/etc/lilo/config file and reinstall lilo (/etc/lilo/install).

If you need a newer e2fsck, you can find the latest e2fsprogs on
ftp.ibp.fr or tsx-11.mit.edu in /pub/linux/BETA/ext2fs.

Cheers,
 Stephen.

You need to get the ipcdelta.tgz file from tsx-11.mit.edu in
/pub/linux/patches, I think.  I once suggested to Rik Faith he
include ipcs and ipcrm in his Linux utility packages, but
since he hasn't made a new release since then...

Subject: lilo and empty map sections

I'm running lilo and getting
the following error message:

Added linux
Empty map sections



my config file looks like:

boot = /dev/hda
install = /etc/lilo/boot.b
delay = 20
image = /Image
        label = linux
        root = /dev/hda3
        vga = normal
image = /dev/hda1
        label = dos
        table = /dev/hda


Any ideas? thanks, Steve

Hi,
I compiled the pcnfsd sources by sun for linux, but when logging in
from a dos-box i get authentication errors.
I suppos it has to do with the SLS shadow-password suite.
Does anyone have a working copy of pcnfsd ?

Thanks a lot

Date: Fri, 1 Oct 1993 22:58:17 GMT

Hi everybody,
following problem:
I have an internal net, class C, ip 200.200.200.0 (nothing to do with a
real existing net).

When I use 200.200.200.1 to connect via slip to the real existing 
192.109.159.1 I have to be 192.109.159.132. How can I do that ?

It would be fantastic if I can furthermore connect from 200.200.200.10
to any existing host in the internet. Is that possible ?
