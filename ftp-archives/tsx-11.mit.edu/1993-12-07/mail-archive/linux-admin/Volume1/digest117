So far so good, but then the kernel compiles fine and works a treat!
Next problem is with "driver.o", will compile fine with c++, but insmod
can't use it.
    Similar treatment with c++-isms complains of parse errors and
multiple defines in kernel-interface.h when compiling fdc-io.c and
ftape-rw.c
    Any further ideas. The boot floppy at sunsite /pub/Linux/kernel/images
named something like ftape-096-boot-floppy works fine when booted up, as
it is compiled with c++, you can't use it to insmod a kernel complied with
straight C.
Regards
Sid.

This should of course be
        umount /usr; fsck -t ext2 -a -f /usr; mount /usr

(note the -f to force execution of e2fsck). That is because umount would mark
the filesystem as clean which is not true.

Look at them and see if they contain anything you want to keep. 
Otherwise delete them. Do this only after a completely clean e2fsck run
on the unmounted file system.

I bet you did not have a completely clean e2fsck run before you did that.

This means you buggered something you want to keep! Maybe its there in lost+found.
Maybe its even in one piece.

As far as I understand it, there is no man page for xftp, because the build in

selecting General help and after that the Selections menu).

I have compiled pcnfsd to use shadow-passwords. If somebody else wants it
let me know I'll send it to you (Makefile or binary).

Subject: Sending mail to MX forwarded mail addresses with Smail
Date: 19 Oct 1993 13:18:04 GMT

I noticed that Smail will not send to some mail fowarding arrangements, most
notably those that do not have an ip address in their nameserver entry, but
rather a reference to another host.

% host cs.tamu.edu
cs.tamu.edu mail is handled by clavin.cs.tamu.edu

Such is one case.  Is there anyway to get linux Smail to send to such
addresses without having to manually specify the fowarded-to host?

Thanks for any help,
Dan

That's something I would like to know too. We do it here for years now without
any problems. We have Sun and HP clients and Sun Servers and as I said: NO
PROBLEMS. So what's this all about?

Yeah, amen.  These don't work under SCO SVR3.2, either, thank goodness!

Should be able to mount a floppy without being root and without using 
anything setuid.  I don't have Linux booted at the moment to check how I
do it, but as I recall it involves /etc/default/filesys (or some such name)
having an entry for your floppy with (amoung other things) a mount device,
file system type, mount directory, "mount = yes rcmount = no" and so on.
Of course there are security holes here too, give me a non-privileged 
logon to your system with the ability to mount a floppy and I can be
root even faster than the fifteen seconds a previous poster mentioned,
all I need is a setuid binary on my floppy.  But of course, given
physical access, there are other security holes (I can do more damage
faster with an axe than I can with an "rm -r *", so what the heck).

Mail sales@metrolink.com, they have a port of 1.2 for Linux.  Needs
Xfree86 and maybe XS3, see the X faq for details, a suitable
graphics card, tweaking, etc.  Rumor was that the Metolink install
had a few warts, maybe they've made it slicker since the post.
I have the package but have not yet installed it, am waiting
for the household budget to accomodate the computer for it.

Perhaps, a second computer would solve your problem.
