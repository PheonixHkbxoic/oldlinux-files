What NET-2 are we talking about here? If you mean the the NET-2 as in the
linux kernel pl9-pl12 then the NET-2 "howto" should give you all the correct
answers. If you mean the ALPHA NET-2e4 then things are a little different.

If you want a very simple way to test that you are doing nothing wrong, you
can try my network boot/root disk. They are on ftp.robots.ox.ac.uk in
/pub/linux/ox-usr/rootdisk/

current versions are

boot-0.99.pl12.gz
and
root-0.99.pl12.gz

See the README in that directory.

This rootdisk will "self configure" on the initial boot up by asking you the
approriate questions.

I also have a version NET-2e4. But I don't think NET-2e4 is anywhere near
stable enough to give to poeple having problems with the current kernel.

Subject: Want to add swap and repartition
Date: Tue, 14 Sep 93 23:06:26 GMT

As the header says, I need to add a swap partition (though I have 16MB!)
since some jobs dont run simultaneously with X on my 486 (SLS1.02).
I also want to repartition my hard disk (reduce the DOS and
increase /user1 and so on...) . Can someone let me know the best
way to handle this? I have a lot of users and need to minimize
down time and retain all the accounts and configuration!

And please give me details on how to add the swap space. Any disadvantages
in doing this?

Thanks in advance.

The method that I use is a program called doas. The source is in
source/usr.bin I think on tsx-11. It basically sets up a control list in
which you place user:program pairs. This is a way to give limit root privs
to select users. Of course you have to trust the program to do the right
thing.....

Everybody complains about SLS, and I will admit that it has its
problems.  I know because I have now put two different versions on my
machine, but when dealing with an operating system that is is new as
this one, and still in alpha, you should at least know how to control
the thing.  I have learned more about Unix operating systems trying to
fix mine than I have learned in four different classes that employed
unix for one thing or another.

I clap for SLS for making me learn in depth the operating system that I
have decided to run on my computer.

Well even though I don't have a major problem with SLS at the moment, I
should state that when I went to get the newest release(1.03?)  I wound
up using an old boot/root disk, and then installing all the new stuff
with that rather than with the new boot/root disk.  The new root/boot
disk could for some reason not set up a ramdrive... go figure.

I just set up a linux box on a small ethernet with a Mac running 
NCSA Telnet.. everything went very smoothly (learning all the damn
configuration files is the hard part).

Anyway, a tip to anyone doing the same: make sure the Mac's IP
address is in the /etc/hosts file, or it will take around 2
minutes to get a login prompt after opening the connection.
I assume the linux machine was trying to resolve the name via an 
external nameserver.

I had this problem, too, with the NET-2-HOWTO. The problem was that I got 
the network up and running, but if I (as mentioned in the HOWTO) routed
the localhost in rc.inet1, route will complain about network unreachable.
As this does not to be 
        a) needed (all works correct)
        b) working 
this should be revised in the HOWTO. 
The line #567  of the HOWTO :
/etc/route add ${IPADDR}
is the cause of this error

Assume? There are only these two ways to get the name, or do you
already have the alpha telepathy driver working? :-)

Seriously, you seem to have a slow or overloaded DNS or network
leading to it, in which case it's best to list the most frequently
used hosts in /etc/hosts anyway. And look at both the Mac and the
Linux box which nameserver they are using - perhaps it's one far away,
in which case you should change the setup.

If the hashed (long) password is to be encrypted anyway, then the hash 
algorithm need not be cryptographically secure; an easier (and faster) 
algorithm than MD5 or SHA might do as well (like the one by Pearson 
published in CACM June 1990, pp 677-680; I posted a C source to sci.crypt 
a few weeks ago). 

In this case there would be no incompatibility: Short passwords (<= 8 chars) 
are encrypted as before; any longer password is hashed down to 8 bytes 
and encrypted in the same way. 

Thus a long password (or passphrase) is a substitute for some weird 
8-byte string which would be hard to remember (and near impossible to 
type in!).

Ditto.  That change fixed all my problems with networking in SLS 1.03.
