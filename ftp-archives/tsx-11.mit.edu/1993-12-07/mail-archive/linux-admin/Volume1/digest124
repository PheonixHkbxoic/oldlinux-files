My net-2 connection seems to hang when syslogd is running.

Apparently, I seem to be getting this error at random times ONLY when
I'm running syslogd.  Any suggestions?

recvfrom unix: Bad file number

Currently, syslogd is off (even though inetd still routes through
tcpd)... although, I don't like the idea of leaving syslogd off.

Any suggestions?

Ok I have compiled Circle Mud (Yea)
now when I run it under my user ID under screen 
and shell another screen (circle in one)  then type rlogin 4000
I get permission denied.  (PS I'm loged in on a modem ...)

How do you login to the MUD? telnet obviously won't work *no net*

Ideas?   Help of any sort would be appreciated

Do I need to chang the ID  (setuid)?
Or am I just clueless (don't answer that!) (big smile)

Maybe in Pennsylvaina.  I was Talking to a Car Tel "Engineer" who was
telling me that ISDN was about worthless, & probably wouldn't be
available very many places in the US for another 10 years at least and
thought that the T1 tarrifs were OK, and couldn't tell me what V.35 was,
nor could he tell me what I needed on the computer end.  ie.  He didn't
know the required boxes either.

I have.  Our MCI rep immediately gets an engineer on the phone whenever
we have a technical question.  No problem.  BTW we have 3 T-1's.

Hello,

scsi-disks normally must not be parked, because they have an autopark-
mechanism.

This is kindof strange. I got the source from prep.ai.mit.edu for

make. I typed make install. There were no problems. I didn;t have to
jump thorugh any hoops, or do parlour tricks to get it to build. I have
been using it extensively ever since 19.19 was released with no problems
under X and in a VC.  I don't know if it matters, but I build it under 
.99pl12, with GCC 2.4.5.

Interesting, I have been running 6 scsi devices off of one HA1542b with
no problems although I am installing a second HA1542b for performance
reasons.  Configuration is :
        scsi 0  Toshiba 1.2GB disk
        scsi 1  Toshiba 1.2GB disk
        scsi 2  NEC CDR-84

        scsi 4  Exabyte 2.3GB 8mm tape
        scsi 5  Archive Viper 150 QIC tape
I did have to configure the HA as suggested and set the CDR-84s to SCSI-1,
but other than that have experienced no problems other than perhaps not
achieving maximum speed on backups to the 8mm tape -- that's why I'm 
adding the second HA.  I would be interested to know of any "gotchas"
lurking out there involving two (or more?) HAss.  Are there any??  Any
suggestions are welcome.

Subject: Serial Ports - How to Configure !!!!
Date: 24 Oct 1993 10:23:53 -0400

Hello all,

        I have a simple question Today : First, I finally finished
installing the full blown SLS Release (all 29 diskettes worth).

        Now, I have an internal modem in COM3 with IRQ5.  Now the
default Linux config, tells me that it is in IRQ4.  I search the MAN 8
directory, and found a nice little command named SETSERIAL, which tells
me that I can reconfigure all my ports to whatever I feel like.

        The big trouble is that this command is nowhere to be found !!!
It is not in /etc like man says, and whereis doesn't find it.

        Q: Where is it really, if not in /etc ?

        Q: In what package is it on the SLS release, so that I can
           re-install it, or re-get the faulty or missing package ?

        Q: Is there another way to reconfig the Serial ports ?

Thanks for the time you will take to answer this, I will really
appreciate it (I might just finally destroy my DOS/Windows environnement
if I get to call on my modem, so HHHHHEEEELLLLPPP !!!!)

As far as I know SCSI disks do that automatically, since they
are a bit more intelligent than MFM/RLL/... disks.

This is more of a different problem.  Don't allow other host to mount your

Date: Sun, 24 Oct 1993 18:05:18 GMT

 Well, I was looking into doing this. There is a reference to it in either the
Ethernet or Net-2 Howto( Don't remember which off of the top of my head, sorry).
What I had to do to get my machine to recognize both cards, Elite 16 Combos, 
was to boot from lilo w/ the following arguments :

boot: linux ether=15,0x280,0xcc000,0,eth0 ether=5,0x300,0xd0000,0,eth1

 This tells my machine exactly where the cards are and lets me work with 
both of them. I was having a problem trying to compile this information into the
kernel using variables, so I just added the eth1 device in space.c and specify
at boot time. Can someone tell me how to put these arguments into a lilo
configuration file so that I don't have to type them when the machine reboots ?

I just wnet through this and will help as best I can.

If you have your a1.3 disk, still. Try the following. Boot off of it.
After logging in as root, do 'doinstall /dev/hda (or whatever device has the
boot sector). Now when it asks where you are installing from pick 'tape'.
Then pick floppies as your destination. Voila! 

Good luck!

PS when you said you corrupted your boot floppy you weren't talking about your
a1.3 disk were you?

The above message seems to provide some light on the subject. I would
rather avoid disabling parity on the bus... It leaves unprotected the
most crucial link in your machine, and given that the SCSI bus can have
electrical noise on it... It should not, and parity is really minimal
protection, yet!

BTW, I am afraid I once read that up to some ROM release, the Nec 74/84
has the rather dubious quality of not doing disconnect/reconnect, thus
holding the SCSI bus for possibly long periods of time.

Has anbyody got any info on this subject? Has by any chance NEC improved
their SCSI implementation in some recent firmware release?
