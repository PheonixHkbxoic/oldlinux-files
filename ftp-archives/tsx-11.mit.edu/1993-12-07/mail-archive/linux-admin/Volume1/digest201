Here is what occurs:

Using more then one gateway sometimes confuses the kernel. The routing 
table (static) gets mixed, i.e. the proper order of static routes is
no longer maintained. Thus as soon as the kernel tries to establish
a connection it doesn't get there. (This was pointed out for pl12
some months ago and still happens, Linus knows about it but so far
not to many people have been reporting this and nobody was sure
whether it is really a bug or just a (corrupted) installation.

Here is what helps:

In the inet.rc (or whatever you use to set up routes) set up
all your routes in the correct order (and you'll notice that
the routing table (route -nv) does change this order). A workaround
is now to delete the mixed up route (I believe it was the 
network to which your computer is directly connected to - and this
one has to be last), and to add it again.

Example:
/etc/route add ${NETWORK}
/etc/route add ${NETWORK2} gw ${GATEWAY2} metric 1
/etc/route add default gw ${GATEWAY} metric 1
/etc/route del ${NETWORK}  
/etc/route add ${NETWORK} 


Hope this helps

Check again and make sure that you are using the BIND router
(arpa-something-or-other) and NOT the GETHOSTBYNAME router for SMTP
delivery.  The machine you are having trouble with has no published A
records so GETHOSTBYNAME can not reach it.

I've seen this problem with a LOT of smail installations on the
Internet, including the default SLS distribution!  This comes about in
part because the smail installation files generally default to
GETHOSTBYNAME rather than BIND.

i am trying to set up a Linux box for nntp type of news server to my local
network. I have no news admin experience and so have to ask a few questions
before I can start setting it up.
I am using INN as the news server instead of cnews. This package calls for
another nntp as the news feeder to it instead of uucp feed as the cnews.
I am wondering if it is possible to sue the same scheme for news feed from
the feeder as cnews instead of using nntp feed because I can find a uucp feed
easily but nntp feed seems to be a problem .
I cannot use cnews supplied with Linux becsue it does not provide nntp
server for my local network here.
Any one can give me some suggestins on which way is the best??

For a long time, I managed to use /dev/ttyS1 to dial out with my
modem.  From time to time, the modem did not respond, when opening
that port.  I now understand, this is due to the behaviour of
/dev/ttyS*, that they will "hang" until a carrier detect signal
is there from the modem.

However:
- Most of the time, it did not hang, even when there was no connection.
  This may be a fault with my internal modem, though.  Or it is
  a problem, that the "carrier detect" is by default "on" after
  an reset, and the modem has not send an "carrier loss" yet.

- I suffer lots of problems with bad connections.  Until I switched
  from /dev/ttyS1 to /dev/cua1, auto retrain did not work.  In
  other words, the line disconnected, when line quality got
  worse.  Now, the modem switches to a lower speed, as you would
  expect auto-retrain to work.

In other words: there are many subtle differences between /dev/cua
and /dev/ttyS.  I am not experienced with modems, and I do not
know much about all the many lines on a serial port, either.

But is there someone, who really knows about things, and can write
a precise and detailed explanation for the FAQ?  Something, that
says more than "/dev/cua* are for dial out, and /dev/ttyS* are
for dial in".

For example: a friend of me suffers badly under both MS-DOS and
Linux.  He sends an ATDP.... command, the modem dials one number,
then stops.  With another machine, the modem works fine.

Erm, I think you missed the point. A picture, a 1000 words, all that jazz:


Internet <-----> Linux 1 <--->|
          SLIP                |
                              | LAN
                 Linux 2 <--->|

The question is how to connect the Linux 2 box to the Internet. Since the
only common connection is through Linux 1, then Linux 1 has to be set up
as a router. Once this is done then Linux 2 can get to other machines on
the Internet. This is a "Good Thing" (TM) and not the waste of resources
you describe.

>
>Might I enquire just exactly what you want to achieve?  I cant think of any 
>earthly use for the scenario you have just outlined....

So I guess all the machines you use are directly connected to the net without
a router. This is the exact scenario you need to connect a subnetwork to
the Internet.

As to the problem, I've done this with Ethernet networks so the principals
should be the same:

Linux 1
=======
- Enable both the SLIP interface and the eth0 interface.
- Set the gateway of the SLIP interface to the internet gateway machine on the 
  other side of the SLIP connection.
- Run routed

Linux 2
=======
- Enable the eth0 interface
- Set the gateway to the IP address of the eth0 interface of Linux 1

routed should bridge packets between the eth0 and SLIP interfaces on Linux 1.
The gateway setup of the SLIP interface should route all packets to the
Internet gateway machine. The gateway setup of Linux 2 should route all packets
to Linux 1.

Hope this helps,

BAJ

   We're trying to set up a cluster of PC running Linux here at the
   University. We started out with SLS 1.03, and have upgraded the kernel
   to 0.99.13s, libc to 4.4.4, and installed the binaries from the
   yp-linux package (the lib-source in yp-linux seems to have been folded
   into libc by now). gcc is 2.4.5.

Whoever handles YP for Linux should get in touch with me: there's some
bug fixes and a serious change that you *really really really* want!

First of all, there are a couple of bug fixes. You should get the new
code and merge the changes (which, last I saw, is not going to be
easy: whoever made the code in Linux saw fit to change the formatting
of most of the files.) There are some important fixes.

The change causes the /var/yp/bindings files to be the same as with
Sun NIS.  This is a good idea for future binary compatibility: if SVR4
binary emulation is added to NetBSD or Linux, we would like those
binaries to talk to YP correctly. (Heh. Or SunOS -- that is actually
my main concern at the moment -- since NetBSD/amiga can run SunOS sun3
binaries today.)

(The Linux and NetBSD YP code should also be compatible, so that if
NetBSD ever gets a Linux binary emulation mode that YP still
functions..)

   I've looked at NYS, but it isn't near a finished state. Peter Erikson
   suggested I replaced yp-linux code (partially) with NYS, but this
   isn't trivial, so that would be my absolutely last option.

I have no idea what NYS is. What is it?

Oh and please, a request: The code that I wrote is simply called `YP'. It is
not called `NIS' -- as far as I know `NIS' is a copyright/trademark/whatever
of Sun. `Yellow Pages' is a trademark of British Telecom, but `YP' is NOT
a trademark held by anyone. So call it what I call it -- just plain simple
`YP' (YP is not an acronym for anything, except perhaps "Yucky Poo!" )

Try running 'paths' through sort first and then putting back into place

I have my system setup sorting the paths list, even though I should NOT

Well, not really. It depends on how you configure smail. Default is
sorted, but you can configure unsorted as well.

Date: Fri, 3 Dec 1993 09:42:22 GMT

Hello,

I am trying to install Linux on my 486/33, 8mb RAM, 210 Meg IDE
hard drive, CMS Jumbo 250, 2 floppies... pretty standard stuff.

My only weird thing is a Session 8, a direct to disk digital
audio recording system. It has a SCSI card as part of it.
The entire unit eats one interupt, and lives at 0x200.

I have a foolish dream to use one SCSI Seagate ST11200 for
the Session 8, and another for Linux (using the Session 8's 
SCSI controller. I know I'll have trouble with the SCSI card,
but the trouble is, I can't even get it to boot.

During the boot sequence (disk a1.5), I get this:

   loopback device init
   8390.c: v0.86 4/8/93 for 0.99.6 Donald Becker (becker@super.org)
   HP-LAN ether card probe at 0x200: dc f0

... and it hangs. The next time I tried, it hung on the previous "Becker"
line.

I have tried from ramdisk, and from floppy: same results.
   
Can anyone offer me some advice on getting this to boot? I obviously
need to disable the HP-LAN probe (removing the Session-8 is *not* an
option!). And why does it sometimes hang on the line above and how to
fix?
                  
Email responses please.

Thanks in advance,

experience) on any of the following:

              LINUX
              386BSD

I am soon to start a project wherein I need to install one of
the above onto a 486DX2 VLB with a 430Mb IDE HD,
16Mb RAM, an SMC ethernet card, and a VGA monitor. (I'll change
any specific item(s) if necessary, but this looks like the most

I need to know which is the best route to go and *your* opinion
as to why.  I am also curious as to ease of installation, compatibility
with third party software packages, etc. - anything one can think
of that's important.  I am not looking for FAQs; I have downloaded
