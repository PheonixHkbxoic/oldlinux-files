You say it yourself. mke2fs -m 0, or to change an already filled up floppy,
tune2fs -m 0 will do the same.

Although I suggest this, I myself prefer raw-written floppies 
( tar cvf - > /dev/fd0 ) to create archives. Sure, I admit that I don't 
then have the lost+found capabilities, but I can take my archives over
to SUNs without any trouble.

I have an ET4000 (Orchid ProDesigner II) and a NEC 3D, and
have been fiddling with this thing for days with no luck.
I read every man page and README.Config and the long documents
on video displays and timing and such.  I even printed them all
out and took them home to study them.  What I don't have yet is
X working.

No...

J> A 42k file WILL consist of 8 full blocks followed by 2 fragments.

No, it will consist of 5 8KB (always assuming an 8KB/1KB fs, instead of
any other more or less plausible one) full blocks plus a 2KB fragment; a
2KB fragment is not just 2 consecutive 1KB fragments.

Thus the 1KB (in an 8KB/1KB fs) usually mentioned as the "fragment size"
is actually the "fragment granularity".

The FSS must keep separate lists of free fragments for each of the 8
possible fragment sizes; if the list for the fragment size one need is
empty, a full block (or a larger fragment) is broken in two; the two
parts are added to the free list for the appropriate fragment
size. There might well be many 1KB fragment free, but no 2KB fragment
around.

The same is true in memory, with the modifications to the availability
of VM (if the VM page size is equal to the fragment granularity one only
needs a single size of buffers, or perhaps two, as one can make
virtually contiguous the granules of a fragment that are physically
discontinuous).

Just to bury once and for all all this nonsense about blocks and
fragments, as if Eric Youngdale's work were not enough, I will mention
here the really terrifying details of the consequences of the FFS
fragmentation scheme on incore buffers -- if you are under 18 years of
age, or you are impressionable, or suffer from a weak heart, don't read
on.


You were warned!


Ok, most files grow by appending at the end of the file. Suppose the
file size starts such it is an even multiple of 8. One byte gets
written: the FFS buffer manager finds a 1KB buffer and puts the byte
into it. Now 1024 bytes are appended. The buffer manager finds a 2KB
buffer, and moves the byte in the old 1KB buffer, plus the new 1024
bytes, into it.

Every time 1KB more are written, a buffer with the larger size is
allocated, the contents of the previous buffer are moved to the new
larger and so on. This sad thing happens for all blocks that make up a
file, as they are filled they grow from a 1KB frgament to a full 8KB
block (if ever), KB by KB.

When the buffer that overflows is finally 8KB long, or the file is
closed, space for it is allocated on disk, and it scheduled for writing
to that space. If the space requested is a full 8KB long, a full block
is allocated; if it is 1-7 KB long, the "free list" on disk for that
size is searched; if it is empty, a larger fragment or a full 8KB block
will be split; as in a 6KB free fragment being split into say one 4KB
free and one 2KB newly busy ones.

If you have VM pages that are <= 1KB then growing an N KB incore buffer
into an N+1 KB buffer can be done without copying by changing page
tables.

If VM pages are large, as on a Sun3, for example, one might consider
copying things around every time a block grows, which is impossibly
expensive (for each 8KB written to a file, the first 1KB gets copied 7
times, the second 1B gets copied 6 times, and so on...).

The alternative is to resort to using 8KB buffers thruout, which is is
only very expensive, as many files are way smaller than 8KB, so the
amount of memory devoted to buffers will be in general wasted for well
over 50% of its capacity, but this for one thing did not trouble the Sun
people, who has ensured that in general memory was over 50% wasted in
internal fragmentation anyhow.

Now does anyone see why a block/fragment scheme is crazily complicated?

        The problem with this idea is that while the disk controller
knows everything about the disk, it doesn't know anything at all about
the filesystem structure.  Said fs structure information becomes
necessary to do cylinder grouping, etc.  If the OS can do
cylinder/head/sector positioning, it can make much more intelligent
choices about what to put where than the controller hardware can.
Take as an example a filesystem doing striping in software, if the
disk controller remaps your request to somewhere else on one drive,
but not on the other, you've lose a lot of the benifit.

Sounds like your problem is with the machine you are calilng in with doing
xon/xoff stuff for you.  Use hardware handshaking and you should be fine.

(also, make sure your modem is setup to do this also)

Unfortunately, unless the man page for tar is wrong (imagine that :^), the
'z' option to compress the resulting tar file is incompatible with the
option (and I don't remember which one it is either) that lets you specify
the output file size...  If it wasn't for that, I'd use tar by itself to
back up my drive.  As it is, I end up making a filesystem on the floppy
(usually dos, so I don't have as much trouble remembering which floppy
has which filesystem...  Funny, I could have sworn I got rid of that
problem when I stopped using my Atari... :^).
