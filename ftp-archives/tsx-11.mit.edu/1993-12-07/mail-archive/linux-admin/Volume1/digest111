It is not possible for  DOS to use any hard disk controller that the bios
doesn't know about. Therefore unless you have a hard-disk controller with an
bios that allows DOS to recognise it as secondary, you cannot use a secondary
controller under DOS. Linux will recognise a secondary hard-disk controller if
the atdisk2 patches are applied. However you still need to boot the Linux kernel 
either from floppy or from a hard disk on your primary controller. Your best
bet is probably to use the IDE as primary with DOS and a small linux root
partition, and the MFM as secondary. That assumes that the MFM controller can
be set up in this way, of course. This in essence is how I have my system set
up.

Subject: lost+found cleanup ?
From: csron@wizard.weizmann.ac.il (Ron Edgar)
Date: Fri, 15 Oct 1993 09:44:49 GMT

After a crash, the rc boot script ran e2fsck -a on my Slackware (0.99.12#2)
and some anonymous files ended up in lost+found, err...what do I do with them ?
I ones removed them on previous SLS installation and destroyed my system...
On the e2fsck man (8) page it said there is no "lost+found cleanup".

Some things work different now (for example my Xdefaults is not read any longer
and I get the whatever defaults.

Thanks for any help.

Subject: Problems with setuid shell scripts
Date: 15 Oct 1993 12:54:16 GMT
Reply-To: mackintosh@ug.eds.com (Alasdair Mackintosh)



    I've been unable to get setuid shell scripts to work under Linux.
    I create the following shell script owned by root:

>    #!/bin/sh
>
>    id
>
>    echo "Hello" > tmp.file

    I use 'chmod 4777' to set the permissions on the script, but when I run
    it as an ordinary user, 'id' simply prints out my ordinary user id, and
    'tmp.file' ends up being owned by the ordinary user, not by root.

    Trying a similar thing on HP and Sun systems at work yields the expected
    results, which suggests that there is something funny about the setuid 
    mechanism under Linux. 

    Has anyone noticed this behaviour? Is there a known fix?

    Thanks,

APUE is well worth the money.

If you want to get into POSIX programming, take a look at "The Posix
Programmer's Guide" published by O'Reilly & Co.  It's quite a good reference
manual, and gives a good introduction to writing portable Unix programs.

Here're some lines from the comp-sys-sun-faq:

10)     Why does the talk command fail between SunOS
        and any other manufacturer's equipment(like DEC)? 
 
        SunOS has the old BSD 4.2 version of talk. The old talk
        uses "machine dependent" byte ordering. Since
        DEC has different byte order the two talks can not
        communicate(even if you use "otalk" on the DEC
        machines).
        
        Also, most vendors have the newer version of 
        talk from BSD-4.3 and this version is not compatible
        with the Sun Version(which is BSD-4.2).
 
        The solution is to get and install the new version
        of talk because it uses "network" byte ordering and
        it is compatible with most Vendors current talk 
        implementations.
        
        "New Talk" is available via anonymous ftp from several
        sites including thor.ece.uc.edu(Get the file 
        /pub/sun-faq/ntalk.tar.Z). 


So I guess, one way to solve your problem might be to install a
news version of 'talk' on the sun and not on linux.

Is it possible for the swap file to reside on an msdos file system, or 
on an nfs server disk?
That would help running linux on  a PC that boots from floppy and its own
hard disk is dedicated to msdos.
When I tried it, swapon complained that it could not find the swap signature,
although I have used mkswap.
If anybody has tried to setup such a swap file, I would appreciate it to

        I have been using ytalk from linux and sunos 4.1.3 now and it
works just fine. In fact ytalk is much much better than any other talk
programs out there that I have seen. You can get the ytalk v3 pl1
source from any archives that have the comp.sources.unix stuff on 'em.
It compiled pretty much with just a make on my part. You will love
ytalk because it does things like word-wrap, and multiple people in
one talk session, auto-ring and auto-invite and other neat things.
Plus it works were other talk programs for me have failed.

Suns use a prehistoric broken talkd. Replace the sun talkd with ntalk

The original talkd is obsolete and why sun never shipped the right talk

   user passwords on unix systems are normally stored in the
file /etc/passwd, along with the user's uid, gid, home directory,
shell, etc.   the file is (of necessity for any program
that needs to know a particular value for the current user)
publicly readable.   the downside of doing it this
way is that someone could collect all the passwords for
a system out of that file, then try to crack them
by various means.
  what the shadow passord suite does is to
store those passwords separately, so as to
not compromise security while still allowing
programs to access the rest of the fields
in a user's /etc/passwd entry.

  i have never heard of them causing any problems, and
removing Shadow would probably not be worth the effort, since
it will not affect anything might do.

We have a problem getting our Linux machine to interface with our lan.
Here are the symptoms:

-When I telnet to Linux, I never get a login prompt
-Other clients (ftp,mosaic,etc.) send packets ok, but receive nothing
after the first packet.

-Outbound from Linux we get a 'Network is unreachable' error when
running any client apps.

Here is my configuration:

I think they are just hints for those with not enough HD-space :-))
OPT means optional
REC means recommended
IMP means important (I'm not quite sure about that one , never seen with
                    SLS 1.01 , and I didn't install the later versions

So these abbrevations should just tell you , whether the asked packages

I have tried ytalk on Linux, but the compiler barfs at something
missing of curses stuff (there is one object module required for which
there is no source, if I remember correctly - taking it out gives link

Have I missed something fundamental? :-)
