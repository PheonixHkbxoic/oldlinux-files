Bug, methinks - happens exactly as you describe right here too. 
What I haven't tried yet is newer than pl13 kernels - this may be a
good move as rumour has it that a few net-2 bugs have been fixed in
the interim.  It could also be NCSA - it has some problems with messages
but not quite the same symptoms...

Also I have had problems with FTP to a Novell 3.11 server - I always get
the error "Bad directory components" whenever I try to get or put anything.
Other un*x ftp clients connect to this server ok. 
Looks like Linux ftp has some problems...

You can assist your users, of course, by making judicious choices for

make good use of the motd/issue files to include a pointer for first

You're comparing apples to rotten oranges, there is no comparison between
the cheap, floppy based tape systems and the QIC-02 drives.  The QIC-02
tapes are about three times the speed, and have double the capacity of
the QIC-80 tapes, hardly a valid comparison.  Are they cheaper?  Of course,
and you get what you pay for.  If you have 300-400 megabytes of stuff on
your Linux machine, backing it up on a 60mb or 120mb capacity tape drive
at floppy speeds is pretty painful...

Gee, if you're so demanding, why not jump right in and fix the QIC-80
stuff, you sure seem to expect a lot for free software!

I have a similar problem coming from my system with WinQVT 3.94, Linux
as a server has big problems, for both telnet and ftp, but I can go the
other way with no problems.  WinQVT talks to my Sun with no sweat, and
there's never a problem, so it's certainly something unique to Linux
networking...

In this case, you aren't even addressing the same question.  The SC01
and the 1542 are both SCSI controllers, that's not what's being discussed!
I have a couple of Wangtek 5150EQ's with QIC-02 controllers, they are
just as fast as any DC600 150/250mb drive on ANY SCSI controller, since
the speed it determined by the physical tape transport.  Since the format
is the same, and given the right software I can keep these drives 
continuously streaming, that's as good as it gets.

Hi,

   I had the same problem with the man that comes with SLS.  The best solution
is to get the source to man from tsx-11 and `make' it.  The result works.
While you are at it, pick up the sources to `script'.  The SLS script appears
to be nothing more than:

   echo "Script started, file is typescript"
   echo "Script done, file is typescript"

I am joking of course but the result is the same.

   Are there other broken utilities in the SLS distribution?  I'd like to
replace them ASAP.

Thanks.

You say pretty well.........
You remember that old horror movie....

I run ftape on pl14
I can almost always write a full tape,
but when I try to restore, I get read errors.
This drive works.... under MESSSYDOG6.0

Even on the rare occasion that I don't get an error,
I check the files that I restored, and there are 
differences between those and the ones I backed up.

Still waiting for ftape-0.9.7.  But my compliments
to the brave author of ftape-0.9.6.

Why won't he/she reveal his/her self so we can send

Maybe if every linux user that has a QIC-40/80

[Various forms of complaining deleted]

You obviously haven't run a large system where users are spread out over
several hundred miles (or any large distances, larger than 20 feet).  If
you have, you almost definately would have run into a problem at some
point or another where a user is having a problem, and you can't figure it
out without seeing EXACTLY what he is typing, and what he is getting back
(because we all know users tell us EXACTLY what they are typing/seeing!).
This has happened to me quite often, and it's frustrating to not be able
to figure it out.  Alot of times it turns out to be REAL stupid things
like, saying "type C D <SLASH> H O M E <SLASH> ABC <RETURN>", and come
to find out, they keep typing cd \home\abc or something.

Hello all,

I have my net splitted into 4 subnets,  and my linux box connected to the
first one, so I use netmask 255.255.255.192
and broadcast 143.107.66.63. Is Linux able to work with such netmask? When
I telnet to Linux from the same subnet it is in, it works, but telneting
from another subnet, there is no response. I'm using Novell servers 3.11
(sorry:) as routers and tcp/ip configured with forward=yes and rip=yes, as
showed in the "picture" below.

Obs: 
 1) Others Unix sites in the same Linux's subnet work correctly.
 2) Linux notice that it is being called but the "answer" doesn't
reach the caller.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!
