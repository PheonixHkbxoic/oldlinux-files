Hmm.  Looks like some of those new linux groups were finally created.  I
suppose that comp.os.linux should become dead soon...  Ah well, I suppose
I should cross-post this a bit then...

In any case, I finally got my Linux box to network outside the local zone now.
The fix?  It seems that the "route" command is very order sensitive.  So I put
everything in a certain particular order and now it works.

But some things don't work:  I can't do an nslookup on addresses in the
/etc/hosts file, although I can use that file for aliasing.  And the fingering
doesn't work right:  Nobody on my system has logged in.  Bull.  And solutions
for that?

Here is my rc.local file:
---------------------------- rc.local -----------------------------------------
if [ -x /etc/rc.inet1 ]; then 
        /bin/hostname -S `cat /etc/host`
        /etc/rc.inet1 
        (sleep 2;          # wait for daemons to get a foothold 
        mount -av -t nfs)&
else
        /bin/hostname -S shemp.cosc.brocku.ca
fi 

if [ -f /etc/lilo/bootargs ]; then
        (cd /etc/lilo; /bin/sh ./bootargs)
fi
if [ -x /etc/clock ]; then
        /etc/clock -s
fi

if [ -x /etc/syslogd ]; then
        syslogd  # turn on logging of su's, logins etc.
fi

if [ -x /etc/syslogk ]; then
        syslogk on > /usr/log/kernel&  # log all kernel messages.
fi

if [ -x /etc/lpd ]; then
        /etc/lpd        # printer daemon
fi
------------------ end of rc.local --------------------------------------------

Notice that I put in /etc/rc.inet1 instead of /etc/rc.net.  Doing that cleared
up a few problems, as I followed through most of the NET-2 FAQ, and _it_ used
rc.inet1 and rc.inet2, so _I_ used them.

Here is my (slightly edited) rc.inet1 file:
------------------------------ rc.inet1 ---------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
# rc.inet1: configure the network interface

# IF YOU HAVE AN ETHERNET CONNECTION, use these lines below to configure the
# eth0 interface. If you're only using loopback or SLIP, don't include the
# rest of the lines in this file.

# Edit for your setup.
IPADDR="my.site.address"  # REPLACE with YOUR IP address!
NETMASK="my.network.mask"  # REPLACE with YOUR netmask!
NETWORK="my.network.address"  # REPLACE with YOUR network address!
BROADCAST="my.broadcast.address"  # REPLACE with YOUR broadcast address, if you
                           # have one. If not, leave blank and edit below.
GATEWAY="my.gateway.address"  # REPLACE with YOUR gateway address!

/etc/ifconfig eth0 ${IPADDR} netmask ${NETMASK} broadcast ${BROADCAST}
# If you don't have a broadcast address, change the above line to just:
#/etc/ifconfig eth0 ${IPADDR} netmask ${NETMASK}

/etc/route add default gw ${GATEWAY} metric 1
#/etc/route add ${NETWORK}
/etc/route add ${IPADDR}

/etc/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
/etc/route add 127.0.0.1

/etc/rc.inet2
# End of rc.inet1
------------------------ end of rc.inet1 --------------------------------------
Notice that all of the addresses are put in this file explicitly, rather than
figured out from the /etc/hosts file.  For some reason the rc.net script that
came with the initial SLS 1.03 file mucked up the broadcast address.  Mine was
aa.bb.cc.255, but it set it to aa.bb.255.255.

Also note that I put the gateway first, skipped the network, then put in the
local machine, and finally the loopback.  Having skipped over the network seems
to be what fixed up the seeing-outside-my-zone problem.

I call the rc.inet2 file from rc.inet1.  The file contains almost exactly the
stuff from the NET-2 FAQ (ie. I copied it from the distribution files into
/etc instead of /conf/net.  It doesn't matter where it resides as long as it
can be found.) except that I uncommented the named stuff.  However, doing this
didn't fix up doing an nslookup on entries in the /etc/hosts file so I'm
probably going to comment it out again.

I hope this helps some of you other Linuxers get your machines working on the
network...

Subject: Soundcard Compiling...
Date: 13 Aug 1993 17:16:44 GMT

I spent part of last night trying to compile soundcard support into the
kernel.  Unfortunately it did not work.  I was using
snd-driv-1.0c.tar.gz obtained from sunsite.  I am using kernel pl10
(from the MCC release).  I have *completely* messed up my source code
kernel at this point.  Before I try this again, can someone tell me what
kernel patchlevel the 1.0c distribution is for?  How about 1.0b?  There
was no doc giving info on kernel releases in the dist files, so this
might be a wise thing to add, to whoever is maintaining the soundcard
support drivers... :-)  Thanks!

Oh, while I'm here, I have a simple question.  It relates to WorkMan.
I don't have OpenLook installed on my system, but I'd like to use
WorkMan.  I got the binaries off of sunsite, but under XFree86 1.3 and
pl10 kernel, it seg faulted.  Anyone know, does the program actually
work?  (Oh, I have a mitsumi CD-ROM, and the 0.3 driver.  I did tell 
Workman to use /dev/mcd, but to no avail.)  Do I need to recompile it
for my libs and kernel?  Does it even work with a mitsumi drive?  Hmmm...

Thanks again!

As for my experience, I can confirm that the system I run - the most
important applications are UUCP based mail/news and TeX - is
rock-solid.  Currently I have Linux 0.99.9 installed, but I'm using it
since 0.11 or so and never had stability problems. Once I got it to
run, it always kept running.

My advice on configuring a system is: Use only known good hardware,
i.e. check the compatibility list before purchase even if some may find
this over-careful. (I think it over-careful myself but if reliability
is the main concern...) IDE disks are best wrt. headache-less-ness
(and cheapest, btw.)
And use only known good software, i.e. the second-newest kernel
release after having scanned c.o.l. for the most frequently reported
problems.

Anyway, 
        I have had 'similar' problems recently. Using pl11 with CSLIP configed,
I can use telnet, ftp, and other tcp functions. But, I could not use NFS. This
was a big problem for me. Experimentation and recompilation showed me that with
CSLIP off ( just using SLIP ) the amount of error in each packet decreased
significantly, yet, there was still some error. I believe this error is 
associated with the calculation of packet lenghts.
        But, using pl10 kernels, or, using a pl10 client and pl11 server, I can
use NFS. But, without CSLIP on both ends, I can't use tcp, only udp.

Has anyone else noticed this problem? As soon as I find a fix, I'll post.

[...stuff deleted...]

just out of curiosity, what should the permissions on the other
directories in /usr/spool be?  i've got:

777 for ftpd (and for msgs, a directory inside ftpd)

        and
777 for smail (and for log, a directory inside smail)

it doesn't seem that these should be ther permissions, but there might
be something i don't realize about these directories, i.e. they might
need to be set this way.

There are different versions of loadkey etc. for linux 0.99pl10 and
pl11. You have to use the right set of utilities for your kernel.

Hope this helps

Yes. When you run doinstall just specify whatevery partition you want
as root (and usr if it's a separate partition) on the command line.
Type the command by itself to see the possible options.

Also you'll need to set up LILO yourself unless you're using the OS/2
Bootmanager.

                 Welcome to the comp.os.linux.* hierarchy!

Background
=========================================================================
        This posting is an introduction to the comp.os.linux.* hierarchy 
        of USENET newsgroups. 

        Linux is a free implementation of UNIX for 80386/80486 machines 
        covered by the GNU GPL. Most of the development of the Linux 
        kernel has been done by Linus Torvalds, an internationally 
        reknowned UNIX wizard from Helsinki, Finland.

        For the past two years or so, the newsgroup comp.os.linux has 
        grown be one of the most popular groups on USENET. Late in 1992, 
        a CFV for splitting comp.os.linux was posted; the only group which 
        passed was comp.os.linux.announce, a moderated newsgroup for Linux 
        announcements and patches.

        Six months later, during the summer of 1993, another CFV for 
        splitting comp.os.linux was posted. The voting period for the 
        comp.os.linux reorganization results ended at 23:59:59 UTC on 
        4 August 1993 (4:59PM US Pacific Time, 7:59PM US Eastern Time.) 
        The results are as follows:

        comp.os.linux reorganization results - 1842 votes

         Yes   No  : 2/3? >100? : Pass? : Group
         ---- ---- : ---- ----- : ----- : -------------------------------
         1692  135 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.admin
         1741   90 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.development
         1647  177 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.help
         1660  155 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.misc


        Because of this split, the newsgroup comp.os.linux will be 
        deleted on 11 November 1993. The new newsgroups will be created 
        on 11 August 1993. This posting describes these newsgroups, 
        including comp.os.linux.announce, which will remain entact.


General Policy
=========================================================================
        The general policy for the Linux newsgroups is simple. Who sets
        the policy? We all do. All of us on USENET are interested in
        communicating openly about a number of topics. That's why we
        have USENET. If you want the Linux newsgroups to work for you,
        a few suggestions:

        * Read the Linux FAQ and follow the newsgroups for some time 
          before posting questions. This is very important. comp.os.linux 
          suffered from HUGE amounts of noise and traffic because much 
          of the growing readership never bothered to READ the newsgroup;
          they only posted questions.
          
          The same thing will happen with the new newsgroups unless you 
          read the FAQ (found on sunsite.unc.edu in the file 
          pub/Linux/docs/FAQ) and read the newsgroup for some time before 
          posting questions. Chances are, your question has already been
          recently answered, and a simple browsing of the newsgroup
          will answer it. We suggest using a threaded newsreader such as
          "trn" which will allow you to browse and mark articles by 
          subject, so you don't have to read each and every article in
          each newsgroup.

        * Crossposting between the Linux newsgroups is STRONGLY 
          discouraged. If you do crosspost questions between Linux 
          newsgroups, expect to be flamed to oblivion. The reason we
          have a newsgroup split is to categorize discussions into 
          separate newsgroups. Crossposting negates this effect. 
          If your posting cannot fit into ONE of the newsgroups
          c.o.l.admin, c.o.l.help, or c.o.l.development, then you 
          should post it to c.o.l.misc. 

          The one exception is for announcements. Occasionally, an
          important announcement (such as this one) will be crossposted
          between c.o.l.announce and one or more of the other c.o.l.*
          groups. These announcements must be approved by the .announce
          moderator; see below.

        * Reply to questions via e-mail if at all possible. While 
          discussion in the newsgroups is encouraged, if someone is
          asking a simple question to which the answer is well-known,
          there is no reason to post the reply. Don't assume that 
          the person posting the question actually reads the newsgroup
          or will even note your followup if they do. Reply via e-mail
          unless the reply is of general interest. 

        * Don't flame newbies. Over the course of the past few months,
          the Linux community has developed an oversensitive ego and
          a reputation for being unfriendly towards newcomers, mostly
          because of unwarranted flaming by a handful of righteous 
          individuals. If someone posts, saying, "Hi! I'm new to
          this group! What is Linux?" (which will inevitably happen
          as the new newsgroups are propagated), DO NOT FLAME THEM.
          When someone sees a new newsgroup pop up within "rn", they
          are justifiably curious about the new group and probably
          don't know that well over 80,000 people who know EVERYTHING
          about Linux read the group. Right? 

          Instead of being rude, you can send a polite note to the
          poster, saying, "Hello, Linux is a free implementation of
          UNIX for the 386 and 486. You can get the FAQ from 
          sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/docs. Let me know if I can
          be of help!". That's all. Not difficult, eh? You can even
          save your stock reply in a file and simply send form-letters
          to newbies if you wish. But there is very little point in
          flaming or ever being rude. It goes against everything that
          Linux can and should be. 

          Just remember that nobody knows everything---not even Linus---
          and that you were a newbie once, too. :)


comp.os.linux.announce
=========================================================================
        Comp.os.linux.announce is a moderated newsgroup for Linux 
        announcements and source patches. The purpose of this group was
        to get all of the ``important'' Linux information out of the
        regular newsgroup and into a place where all Linux users could see
        the important announcements without having to wade through a 
        jungle of other postings. So far, this group has been very 
        successful. 

        The moderators for this group are myself (Matt Welsh, 
        mdw@tc.cornell.edu) and Lars Wirzenius (wirzeniu@cc.helsinki.fi). 
        We will be sharing the moderator duty, and backing each other up 
        to make sure that postings to this group will be approved as soon 
        as possible after they're submitted.

        Submissions to this group should be mailed to the address:
                linux-announce@tc.cornell.edu

        If you have any problems or questions about c.o.l.announce, please 
        send mail to the moderators at
                linux-announce-request@tc.cornell.edu
        Or simply mail us directly. This is not a request address for 
        mailing list subscription; see below.

        A separate posting details the guidelines for submitting to this 
        group.  I plan to approve just about anything that's posted to this 
        group, except for questions or discussions about Linux. So, please, 
        post away.  :)

        There are also archives of comp.os.linux.announce available at a 
        number of Linux FTP sites: check 
                sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/linux-announce.archive

        There is a mailing list mirror of the comp.os.linux.announce 
        newsgroup; to join, send mail to
                linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi
        With the line
                X-Mn-Admin: join ANNOUNCE
        at the top of the body (not in the subject). Approved postings to 
        c.o.l.announce will automatically be mailed to this mailing list 
        channel.


comp.os.linux.admin     
=========================================================================
        This newsgroup was created simply to thwart the unique newsgroup
        acronym "c.o.l.a", previously used by c.o.l.announce. However,
        this newsgroup is also used for discussions and questions about
        running Linux systems, either in a single-user or multi-user
        environment.

        Clearly, there is no large distinction between c.o.l.admin and
        c.o.l.help. However, .admin should be mostly used for discussions
        about RUNNING Linux, not USING or PROGRAMMING it. Unfortunately,
        especially with Linux, the line between system administrator and
        system user is very fuzzy. In short, we anticipate c.o.l.admin
        to be mostly about questions with installing, setting up, and
        configuring Linux systems, as well as other discussions relating
        to system administration. 


comp.os.linux.development
=========================================================================
        c.o.l.development, or "c.o.l.d" for short, is a newsgroup for 
        questions and discussions about Linux kernel and systems-level 
        development. Please note that this is a newsgroup about 
        development OF Linux, not development FOR Linux. In other words, 
        c.o.l.d isn't for questions about programming or porting software 
        to Linux. Instead, this is a newsgroup for discussions about 
        developing the Linux kernel itself, including writing device 
        drivers, adding new features, and so on. In addition, discussions
        about development of shared libraries, and other essential 
        systems-level projects, are welcome here. 

        Hopefully, this newsgroup will embody some of the content and
        scope of the linux-activists mailing list channels such as GCC, 
        KERNEL, SCSI, and NET.


comp.os.linux.help
=========================================================================
        Comp.os.linux.help is perhaps the most general of Linux 
        newsgroups. It is for any general user, programming, or 
        setup questions and discussion about Linux. If your question
        is about Linux development, post to c.o.l.development. If
        it is about system administration, post to c.o.l.admin. 
        However, if your question is of a more general nature, such
        as "How do I set up Linux for use with an NE2000 card?",
        c.o.l.help is your place. 

        Remember that you should not crosspost between .help and
        other Linux newsgroups. This means that if you are asking for
        help in .development, that's fine, but .help is for those
        questions which don't fit into .admin and .development.


comp.os.linux.misc
=========================================================================
        This group is the canonical ``catch-all'' for discussions and 
        questions which don't fit into the other Linux newsgroups.
        While c.o.l.help is generally for questions, c.o.l.misc is for
        discussions of a general nature about Linux, such as setting up
        a file hierarchy standard, questions about Linus' personal life
        and virtual beer, and the inevitable flame war. Again, it should 
        be noted that crossposting between c.o.l.misc and other Linux 
        newsgroups is strongly discouraged. If your posting or question 
        does not fit into ONLY ONE of the other Linux newsgroups, post 
        it to .misc.


Comments
=========================================================================
        If you have questions or comments about this document, please
        direct them to mdw@tc.cornell.edu. Flames to /dev/null; cheques
        and money orders to Linus Torvalds. Thanks.

Subject: Why use shadow?
From: eekim@husc11.harvard.edu (Eugene Kim)
Date: 14 Aug 93 23:39:18 EDT

I installed a version of SLS Linux ages ago.  It used the normal
passwd stuff for login, etc.  When I installed a more recent
version of of SLS, I noticed it had switched to using shadow
passwords.

What is the advantage to using shadow versus just passwd?  I
actually seemed to have more trouble with shadow; when I use
useradd, shadow automatically creates a password for me
(a problem I got around by making the password expire 
immediately).

Using shadow also prevents me from just editing the passwd
file to add new users.  Does anyone know why shadow is better
than passwd?

Subject: NEW USERS: How to get the Linux FAQ (please read)
Date: 15 Aug 1993 08:58:04 -0400

NEW USERS: WHERE TO GET THE LINUX FAQ (please read)

PLEASE: EVERYONE read the FAQ for this group before posting questions. Many 
people (myself included) worked hard to produce the FAQ to accurately answer 
all of your questions. The new version of the FAQ (with many updates, 
clarifications, etc.) will only come out every month! So you won't see it 
posted that often. In the meantime you'll have to get it in one of the
following ways:

1)  ftp to tsx-11.mit.edu. It's the directory /pub/linux/docs/FAQ. 
    It's split up into 5 files: the table of contents and the four parts of
    the FAQ itself. Each part is about 50K.

or  ftp to sunsite.unc.edu. It's the file /pub/Linux/docs/FAQ. This is one
    big ASCII file containing the entire FAQ (about 200K).

or  ftp to any news.answers archive site. For example, you can find 
    Linux-related postings from news.answers in the directory
    /usenet/comp.os.linux and /usenet/comp.os.linux.announce on ftp.uu.net.

2)  If you don't have FTP access, you can retrieve it via the mailserver at
    rtfm.mit.edu. Send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the word "help" 
    in the body.
or  If you simply can't find the FAQ, I will mail it to you myself. Just
    send me mail (mdw@tc.cornell.edu).

3)  The most recent FAQ will be posted to comp.os.linux, comp.os.linux.announce,
    and news.answers every month (if you want to wait...).

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: Read the "Meta-FAQ" posted weekly to c.o.l.announce
(also available from the various FTP sites). It gives you all of the pointers 
on where to look for Linux information.

Thanks.
