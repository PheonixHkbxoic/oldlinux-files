        The format of the hosts.deny file is described in the manual page:
        hosts.access (5).

        In case you don't have that page, here is the format:

        daemon_list : client_list [ : shell_command ]

       daemon_list  is a list of one or more daemon process names
       (argv[0] values) or wildcards (see below).

       client_list is a list of one  or  more  host  names,  host
       addresses,  patterns or wildcards (see below) that will be
       matched against the remote host name or address.

        Example:

        rlogind : apple.domain.? 

        all closed is:

        ALL : ALL
        
        There are more operators see the manual page.

Bullshit, for a given format the QIC-02/36 and SCSI interface operate
at exactly the same speed, this being determined by the physical tape
speed and the format.
I have both a QIC and a SCSI drive for 150/250MB and there is no
difference *at all*!

As I understand it, you have make sure the root filesystem is mounted readonly.
Either by defining CONFIG_ROOT_RDONLY. (Shouldn't that be in the config.in 
file?)
Or by typing 'linux ro' at the LILO prompt.

It does.  When I was using the scheduling features I used GMT, after comparing

Hi Linuxers!

Well, I think I'm in trouble with my 0.99p12 NFS-daemon. I would really like to 
export some (more than one) filesystems to other PCs running linux. But actually
I wasn't able to export more than one. I only got the following error-message:
                           
                               RPC: timed out 

(i.e. the NFS-server doesn't like to export more than one filesystem, or what?)
BTW, I have applied the "dirty trick", i.e. root in less than 8 groupsi, the portmapper
and one nfsd are running and the /etc/exports-file is o.k.! This problem occurs 
regardless from which machine I try to mount the filesystems!
My configuration:

  486/33 20 MB RAM clone
  SMC Elite 16
  0.99p12; 
  ext2fs

Please reply by E-mail.
Thanx in advance

I don't know of one for linux, but I've seen a really nice one for Sun
machines.  It involved a kernel-loadable module, so maybe a similar
method could be used to patch a linux kernel.

Spend a little extra and get the bigger drive, plus all the advantages
of SCSI.

        For the rest of us poor users (who already have the Coloradro
drives... ), yes, the ftape driver seems to work pretty well on my
system.  I have formatted a bunch of tapes, and am now doing regular
backups of the system here where I work (Sciences Libraries at UCR).
As the author of the ftape driver goes to great pains to mention,
however, the driver is still in BETA/ALPHA - and is not for the
faint-hearted.  Heh heh.  Basically, to use use drive, get the lastest
version of the ftape driver (I got mine from sunsite.unc.edu), compile
it, compile the modules programs that come with it.
        Then, I got a new kernel, applied the module patches for the pl13
kernel (which I THINK is still necessary), recompiled, rebooted using
the new kernel with module support.  Follow the instructions in
install file that comes with ftape to create the devices in /dev, and
then try it out.  I personally use tar.  I have the Jumbo 250 also.

ie.
        mt -t /dev/ftape rewind
        tar -cvf /dev/ftape /home
        mt -t /dev/ftape rewind

        Seems to work pretty well.  My thanks and appreciation to the
author.

If 23 isn't the right file, then you can read off the correct one from

I took the clocks from AccelCards file for this card & modes from some file. I could start
with startx. I am having some display related problems:

1. When I exit from fvwm, the font on console gets screwed up. Sometimes I get vertical lines.
   Sometimes I get broken chars.

2. If I display xterm with black bg & white fg, different characters have different intensity.
   For example my 'a' & 'g' has different brightness.

3. I tried with 640x480 mode, I got 4 split root windows very tiny on screen & all sort of weird
stuff.


I would appreciate if someone can provide me a good Xconfig file or solution to this problem.
