Try xc ... derived from xcomm. It compiles effortlessly as ported and
has auto z-download in the version called, I believe, xc+rz.tgz at
tsx-11.

It has a good script capability, supprts rtscts, etc. - pretty nice
and better than pcomm or minicom IMHO. If you don't like xc then
kermit is good too of course. Kermit is available in powdered form at
Safeway stores... diet too I think. 

Get Seyon if you use X.

Hello,

Just want to ask, if every of my computer have 2 or more parallel ports,
can (theorically, dispite the bugs) PLIP forms a LAN which is connected 
like this :-

        +-----> Computer A <----+
        |                       |
        \/                      \/         SLIP 
    Computer B              Computer C  <--------> SLIP server (Internet gate)
        /\                      /\
        |                       |
        +----> Computer D <-----+

In a chain, each computer is connected to two other computers. All Linux boxes.
One of them is connected to a SLIP server that serves as Internet gateway over
a telephone line.

Thank you.

Read /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/console.c
(or /usr/src/linux/kernel/chr_drv/console.c if you have an older kernel -
the location was changed recently).
You will see that there are three translation schemes:
Latin (roughly: ISO 8859-1), VT-100 graphics, and none.
With the null translation you get what DOS calls code page 437,
which contains IBM graphics.
The virtual console is in one of two character-set states.
You switch between character sets using ^N and ^O (shift in / shift out).
You select the character sets you switch between using ESC ( x and ESC ) x
where x is one of B,0,U. The former defines the first character set, the
latter defines the second character set. The letter B,0,U defines what
translation you want.
The default is as obtained by ESC ( B ESC ) 0 ^N.

The answer is surely yes, although the routing tables would have to
reflect this.  (In thinking carefully about my suggestion below, I
realized that in the configuration above if A is talking to D via B, B
will have to take 2 interrupts (one in, one out) for every character
passed along, which will limit your throughput.)

What I've been thinking of is:

        +-----------+-----------+-----------+---- pullup resistors
        |           |           |           |
        \/          \/          \/          \/
     Computer A  Computer B  Computer C  Computer D <---SLIP to Internet

by connecting all the parallel ports via open-collector driver chips.
You would have to do an ethernet like ``check busy before talking''
protocol, but that wouldn't be too hard to do.  The advantages: only 1
parallel port required per computer, fewer interrupts on intermediate
computers (they'll get the interrupts but can ignore them unless the
message is for them), you can plug/unplug computers at will (handy for
laptops) and the throughput should be the same (which is to say you're
not losing anything without the second parallel port, as somebody
quoted 25Kbytes/sec which is clearly interrupt-handling limited, as
the hardware is capable of 400Kbytes/sec).

Any comments from any people who know more about hardware than I do?

Subject: Lazy uucico works only when I watch it!
Date: Sat, 30 Oct 1993 22:45:33 GMT


Hi, folks,

I ah happily running Linux on 3 CPUs for about a year now, but there are some
things that puzzle me.
I have mail via uucp all set up and going, but it only works when I have a
debug -X flag set in the uucico invocation line. So I added a cron job to
clean up the Debug file, but this is a hack at best. Another weird thing -
after I installed new Slackware on one CPU, uucico didn't work any more. The
debug file had the last line like "calling system ... at device ACU..." and
that was it. It also created a lock file LCK..ttyS3 and died. So I copied all
uucp stuff from the working host. Same thing. I got the uucico source and
recompiled with -g flag, but couldn't find a problem with gdb, because it now
worked, but only with Taylor style config files. That's OK with me - I did'n
recompile it again, but it does it again - the @#$%^ uucico doesn't work
without at least -X 2 flag. Gdb is no help, because it's a different thread
that is supposed to do the work.
Any ideas?

Thanks.

-Alex.

Hmm, wouldn't simply booting to a floppy and mounting the hard drive,
followed by edditing the /mount/etc/passwd and/or /mount/etc/shadow files
work?  I would give it a try before re-installing.

By default the top bit set characters are those found on the Latin-1 set
(or as near a translation as matches).  You have two choices, convert
your files to use these characters, or place the console in PC graphics mode.

I'd recommend the first approach but as I guess you want the latter you can
send the following:

        ^[)U            - To select IBM display set
        ^[)0            - To return to default set

        ^N              - To enable graphics
        ^O              - To disable graphics

        (Where ^ indicates control)

i.e use: ^[)U           - To initilise
       : ^N             - Before your graphics
       : ^O             - After your graphics
       : ^[)0           - To restore

Note: there are some characters that won't print, those with the following
      decimal values:  0, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 27

I may have some of the above wrong, (if so I'm sure someone will correct me),
but give it a go.

Propably because root's lastlog struct is the first one in lastlog
file and the ll_time field is always the same size.

I decided, at last, yesterday fix this last login -problem in my
system. I have (and had) three different fingers installed. Now
two of them work just fine.

I grabbed this new finger-523.tar.gz and tried it. At last when I
got it compiled (it didn't compile just out of the box), I
noticed that it is using wrong lastlog struct definition. I use
shadow passwords and I had to get lastlog.h from shadow passwd
sources. <bsd/lastlog.h> has also hostname field and it's missing
from the struct used by shadow passwd suite. This is how shadow
passwd suite defines lastlog stuct:

struct  lastlog {
        time_t  ll_time;
#ifdef SVR4
        char    ll_line[24];
#else
        char    ll_line[8];
#endif
};

After realizing this I also fixed the term based finger to tell
correctly last login times. It has the lastlog struct definition
builtin in the source. 

I suggest that Linux gets its own lastlog.h headerfile and
lastlog struct since the confusion between different lastlog
formats gives us those faulty never logged in messages.
