I have to agree, one has to remember that there are software
distributers that accidently release viruses with distribution disks.
I forgot what the name of the company that did this recently was, but
there was a HUGE uproar over it.  IMO FTP sites are fairly safe, and
if you are really worried, remember that if anybody has problems with
it, they will probably post a message on the Usenet.  If you are
worried, you can wait a few weeks until the software ahs been out for
awhile, then get it.

I'm having the same problem in which I get mail back saying that my
smart host can not be found.  I have no problem pinging the smart host.
I've tried several different hosts and all return the same thing.  I can
send mail to machines, but not to domains names.  Could someone post
about a solution to this.  I'm using the smail that comes with SLS 1.03

Thanks

Subject: ext2fs INODES
Date: Mon, 27 Sep 1993 01:27:13 GMT

I tried to back up my system using 'cpio' tonight, and started
seeing things like the following:

cpio: usr/local/lib/news/batchlog: truncating inode number
./usr/local/lib/news/batchlog
cpio: usr/local/lib/news/batchlog.o: truncating inode number
./usr/local/lib/news/batchlog.o

Is there a known problem with INODE numbering in ext2fs?  
Looking at the directory in question, I see inode numbers like
this:

# ls -li batchlog batchlog.o
113871 -rw-rw-r--   1 news     13           3127 Sep 26 21:15 batchlog
113873 -rw-rw-r--   1 news     13           5664 Sep 26 05:00 batchlog.o


Is it just 'cpio' that is broken, ie. can't handle ext2fs's inode
numbers?    It seems to me that it probably doesn't matter what CPIO
does with inode numbers ... since if I use cpio to Extract a file
(or files) from the backup, it will generate a new inode number when
it restores the file to the filesystem, no?

This is SLS 1.03, upgraded to the p13 kernel.  Should I replace the
cpio pgm with something else?  What I *really* want is a "dump" program,
but haven't seen one yet for LINUX.

Thanks in advance.
Bill

        Well, to get really wierd, Ive seen the more problem, and its

Slackware Does support 5.25 booting.  And, I supppose, if you were even
barely technically competent, you could roll your own distribution from
Slackare on 5.25.

I'd like to make just some general Unix points about all this.  

* The kernel is FAT.  You people have demanded so many features that the
kernel is now beyond a reasonable size.  The zImage on my system is well
over 200K. Bash is almost 300K. Libc.so.4.4.1 is 600K. 

Lets see. I make that at about 1100K and we havent added in the stuff that
we actually NEED to make a boot disk be functional. I sure hope ls, mkdir,
rmdir, /etc/passwd, mount, umount, shutdown et al are all under 100K.

Speaking of file sizes, anyone know how libc-lite.so.4 is made?  It shows
up as 600k, but only really takes 200k on the floppy.  So if you do a du
on SLS a1.5, you find 1600k worth of files...  I realize the trick is
to point the extra sectors at the end of each of the shared library functions
to dummy sectors, but how does one edit the file system to do this type of
trick?  The reason I ask, is because I'm trying to update the library version
on my emergency boot floppy.

An alternative to this is to have your .xsession run your .profile
as one of the first things it does.  Have it start your favourite
window manager later in the script, and any other clients, like a 
xterm console, a clock etc.  Your WM will inherit all the environment
variables from your .xsession (which in turn got them from your
profile)  And any X clients started by the window manager will also
know about your environment from your WM.  Something like this:

  # highly simplified .xsession

  if [ -f $HOME/.profile ]
    . $HOME/.profile
  fi

  xclock&
  xterm -C -T console&
  vtwm

I've run a small Sun network for a few years, but am getting some PCs very
soon, and thought Linux + X would be perfect. Just wanted to chat about it to
someone with some experience.

Basicaly want: micro-emacs, xterms, gcc, &c. No network cards &c. Just 3
stand alone machines, for now.


Even if you're not in the UK, we could still have an e-chat maybe.  Some general advice/reasurance would be helpfull.

        dump is not available for Linux.  Actually, dump needs to understand
the physical structure of the file system and that's why it has not been ported
to Linux (Linux ext2 fs is quite different from BSD FFS and I guess that
porting dump to ext2 fs is not trivial).  I may try to port it someday but I
have lots of other things higher on my TODO list.

Hello World,
        I have a fully functioning Linux system on the InterNet and all
seems to fly. However, I can not publish my Linux FilSystems to other machines
although I am able to mount other FileSystems on the PC.
        showmount to the Linux machine shows that there are no puslished
machines, where as showmount -e directly reflects the contents of
/etc/exports.
        Would someone try and tell me what is wrong. I thought that as soon 
as the exports file was OK and that the two deamons were up and running that
you could see the published filesystems...

DUVAL@ELPP1.EPFL.CH

ps: showmount and showmount -e from all sorts of other machines gives the
same replies. It appears to see the exports file, but not export the FS
