  I have been using a STB Powergraph X24 for the past couple months and it
seems to work great.  I can't say what its speed is since the machine is a
386SX-16, but it does work right out of the box...  The STB X24 is an
S3 801 card, and I think they have a localbus version also.
  I purchased mine toward the end of summer for around $130US, but I have
heard that they have gone down in price since then.

Subject: Setting up SLIP gateways and PLIP
Date: 28 Sep 1993 03:03:52 GMT

I was wondering if anyone has or knows how to setup a SLIP gateway via linux.
My roommates and I are trying to hook up their Amigas with AmiTCP. 
We have slip working, but before we can petition the school to give them ip addresses (as I'm the only one with a net connection), we'd like to know if being a gateway was possible. 

On a side note, has anyone gotten PLIP to work....at all?
I keep getting device timeouts and a screen full of garbage...

I had the same problem, but the clue is: fsck only marks the
partition clean, when called WITH the '-a' flag, otherwise
it only checks 'read-only'.

Yes. I have the same problem (0.99.12, SLS 1.03). The mountd on the
server machine seems to go <loop> in 9 out of 10 mount requests.
Moreover, if a mount request succeeds, the fs is always mounted
read-only, even if the exports file says (rw).

Hey everybody,
        I'm trying to rebuild my new kernel Linux 0.99.13 for support of the
3C509 ethernet card. But I keep stumpling over an "unknown blk devive" error.
make depend returns with the following:

In file included from loop.c:27:
blk.h:193: #error "unknown blk devive"
In file included from sbpcd.c:175:
blk.h:193: #error "unknown blk devive"
make[3]: *** [dep] Error 1

the files loop.c, sbpcd.c and blk.h can be found in kernel/blk_drv.
I tried several 'make config' and 'make dep' with the same result.
I disabled SCSI and enabled networking with the 3C509 card enabled only.
Any ideas?
Regards/Gratien

PLIP doesn't work in vanilla Linux 0.99.13. The new Net2E is in
beta test, and PLIP works there (at least it did in alpha 4, which
I use.)

Join the NET channel, or better wait just a little longer.

That is quite simply not correct, and is verging on personal insult.

It _IS_ the contents of the script, because if the script started
with
        #!/bin/sh -
instead of
        #!/bin/sh
then the -i command would not give you an interactive shell.

Yes, but this C program might invoke ./echo instead of /bin/echo.

I'm NOT promoting them in general.  My experience is not limited to Linux.
I'm just correcting some of the misinformation that has been put forth
in this thread, and pointing out that just becomes _most_ versions of
unix do things badly, doesn't mean that _all_ versions do.

In fact I don't think I've given anybody any advice whatsoever in
this thread as yet, but let me start now, just to clear up any
misconceptions:

If you are using a unix system that doesn't support secure setuid scripts,
then of course don't use them!  If you need to be portable, then don't 
use them.  But if you are on a system which does support them, and
you don't need to be portable, then it's worth considering.  Of course,
as with any setuid program, you will still have to be very careful, and
it may in some cases be easier to write it in C.

If you are writing a scripting language, then give some consideration
to setuid scripts - ensure that it should be possible to write secure
setuid scripts in you language, presuming that the kernel supports it.
If you want, support secure setuid scripts even if the kernel doesn't
support it (as is done by perl).

If you are developing a unix system, then put support for setuid
script in your kernel, but configure it out by default.
Advise your users about the risks of setuid scripts / insecure shells,
and let them make their own decision.  Provide a utility which
detects obviously insecure setuid scripts (scripts which are vulnerable
to -i, scripts which don't use a shell known to be secure, sh scripts
that don't set PATH, etc.) so that users who decided to enable the
setuid script support in the kernel can ensure that they don't make
any of the obvious mistakes.

That's why I said SUPPOSING YOUR SYSTEM SUPPORTS SECURE SETUID SCRIPTS.

Sheesh.

This is completely wrong.  Have you actually tried this?
The shell would get invoked with '-' as the first character of argv[1]
not argv[0].

I'm NOT ignoring it.  I'm not suggesting that people use setuid scripts
on systems which don't support secure setuid scripts.  What I am
pointing out is that just because some versions of unix aren't as good
as say Linux doesn't mean that all of us have to stick to the lowest
common denominator.

   Hi everybody,
   following problem:
   I have an internal net, class C, ip 200.200.200.0 (nothing to do with a
   real existing net).

   When I use 200.200.200.1 to connect via slip to the real existing 
   192.109.159.1 I have to be 192.109.159.132. How can I do that ?

You have to set up the SLIP interface to be 192.109.159.132 and the
other interface (presumably Ethernet) to be 200.200.200.1.  Then
everything will work fine.  You might find it easier to use, though,
if you give the two interfaces different names.

At home, we have a similar arrangement: nsict.demon.co.uk is a PPP
interface on the connecting machine, and taki.nsict.org is an internal
name for the Econet interface (yes, Acorn Econet - it's an Archimedes
running RISCiX, which unfortunately means that my Linux box is left
out in the cold... 8-( ).

   It would be fantastic if I can furthermore connect from 200.200.200.10
   to any existing host in the internet. Is that possible ?

Nope.  Unless your class C network is registered on the Internet, then
no-one's going to know where to send packets to you.  And that tends
to cost a lot of money.  The simple answer is to keep routing switched
off on your gateway box and telnet into it with other machines when
you want to talk to the outside world.

Hello world:

I wonder if there is any backup tools for Linux besides cpio. I use dump
to perform backup on SUN workstations and it is very good backup tool. I
thought of tar but somtimes tar does not backup symbolic links. Also, I
have to backup my Linux PC to a remote SUN since I don't have a tape drive.
I don't know if cpio allow me to do that. I know that dump does allow me to
perform backup to a remote drive. I would greatly appreciate your time to
