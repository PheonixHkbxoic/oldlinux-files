Well, I might be totally off the planet here, but what about linux
running pc-nfs, and the dosmachines running some sort of pc-nfs too?

You could then mount the wanted directory as you like. Not perfect,
probably not very secure (I think it depends on what nfs-protocol you
use), but you should get access to your dos-files stored on the
linux-machine.

That is, I think so..

Hello all!

  Is anybody likely to send me some pieces of information (Docs, FAQ, own
infos) about setting up routing tables and configuring slip under linux?

  I am a little experienced with DialupIP and routing unter NeXTStep but
some things under linux seem to be completely different. We're planning
to get our own Class C Net via ISDN-Gate to our local provider and offer
the users a dialin service via slip.

  So the question is on how to route an entire subnet of our Class C net
that is located outside and connected to the local ethernet via slip.
What is the best way to offer slip logins with dip? Is linux patchlevel 14
capable to handle cslip and slip correctly? How can we configure that?
Are there any known bugs in the TCP/IP part of linux so that it's wasted
time to spend the nights desperately searching for an error that appears
rather to be a bug in the kernel than a misconfiguration.

Please send out some stuff if you want to.
thanx in advance
tim bernhardt

You have a hacked version ?! ;-) My guess: compresses batches with gzip ?!  ;-)

A couple of site here use inn uucp only, because it's fast and reliable.
Only a few scripts do a bunch of work. Look out. You need bash-1.13
because some scripts won't run with bash-1.12.
But if you do so, then you really have fun with it !

according to the manual, support for the "standard" irq & dma settings is

I have a Colorado Jumbo 250 and I'm trying to get it to work
using the latest linux kernel (99.13).  I follow the instructions
to load the tape module into the kernel - and it loads.

However, the tape unit still won't work.  The documentaton seemed
to suggest that the tape software was a hack and that you couldn't
count on it - I believe the author said that.

I appears to write to tape, but when I try to extract - no luck.
It chokes.

HAS ANYBODY gotten the new linux (QIC80) tape system to work
for their Jumbo 250??

The source code for pcnfsd is supplied with the PC-NFS package.  It
should be fairly simple to compile pcnfsd, and run it on the linux 
server.  Although I can't guarantee it would work without tweeking,
it does use standard socket calls.  I believe I saw some mail out
there in one of the c.o.l.* news groups a few months ago from some-
one who was doing this.

This discussion is taking place on the FSSTND channel of the linux-activists
mailing list. Look for an archive site of this channel (Dan, does something
like that exist at all ?).
Also there are already some references to the FSSTND draft (as in lilo.13)
this discussion is not yet closed. Everything is in the draft stage for now
(but we have come pretty far). ASA we (the FSSTND channel) reach a final state
it will be presented to the whole linux community (as a proposal that is)
That will most likely be done by Dan Quinlan and will most likely appear on
the c.o.l.announce newsgroup.

So if you want to follow the discussion, then listen to the mailing list.
But don't start another discussion in the newsgroups. That won't help at all.

I do not know if there is an archive of the channel or not.  If not,
there may be a FSSTND ("filesystem standard") channel reader with less
discriminating tastes than myself (someone who saves *every* article).
If that is the case, then such an archive could be made available.

Yes, the discussion is open to reasonable and hopefully knowledgeable
Linux users, and I especially encourage =developers= (and experienced
administrators as well) who could be affected by any possible "movements"
in the Linux directory structure to either contact me or join the FSSTND
channel.  If you do join the channel, please consider that we have
discussed these issues since early August and almost everything has been
well-covered.

Eventually, but not too far off in the future... The set of recommendations
that we plan to publicly release are, naturally, not enforceable, but if
the weight of developers following our recommendations is as high as it
promises to be, then it could become a de-facto standard or something of
the sort.

The most important thing to consider is that any possible improvement
over the current disarray of ideas is a good thing, no matter what anyone
may disagree with in the recommendations.

Yes, newsgroups are generally not a good forum for discussion.
