Has anyone out there tried to install the annex communication software for 
release 7.0. I am very new to Unix and Linux so I am not really sure what 
the hell I am doing, but Iknow someone out there can answer some or one of 
these questions or just offer someadvice or comment on what they found.  
First of all it asks during installation what typeof OS that you have and 
the choices are 1) 4.[23]BSD Unix (&UMAX BSD) 2) System VUnix (& UMAX V)  3) 
XENIX System V  4) MACH 5) SVR4 ?  Then depending on whatyou answer to the 
above question it will ask for additional loader options for 
networklibraries, and alternate include directory for network code, and 
where are the networkinclude files located?  Then it will ask what kind of 
network software does your OS have, 1) 4.[234]BSD or compatible 2) Excelan 
EXOS package 3) CMC package 4) WollongongWINS package 5) TLI. Transport 
Layer Interface?
 If anybody has any idea please e-mail me at Thompsoc@kerr.orst.edu

I didn't have any such problem, using the .ps file.  My only problem was
that the page numbers don't appear on most pages.

Yes.  This is why root is mounted readonly at first, so that no other
process can modify the partition while fsck does its thing.

Nothing usually.  fsck should fix it and then /etc/rc continues as normal.

Wrong.  If there's a crash, fsck will fix it and continue.  The only time
you get dumped into a shell is if *fsck* failes to fix the problem.

I've never seen this happen, and I guess only happens if your filesystem
is hopelessly ruined.

I've been thinking of one possibility that should be safe and still
not cause a headache with keeping access permissions up to date:

Run all users in a custom chroot environment where the user is put
into one of a number of standard environments and possibly RO
nfs-mount certain directory subtrees.  Symbolic links could be used as
needed to 'put-together' the proper structure.

Linux does have chroot, right?  I'm pretty sure it has something like
it, but I didn't find it the last time I perused quickly.
Can anyone email me definitively to put me at ease...

Mounting RO would prevent tampering with /etc, etc.

In any case, this would be for bbs style logins.

Not guilty.

I am guilty of wasting bandwith with this post, however.  If I were
less vain I would have replied via email, but I don't want you (the

Ok, I overlooked it. What about compiling taylor uucp and cnews complete
new. Then you learn the most ..... When configuring the sources and
so on, you get a better idea of what the package is doing ...

Otherwise ....make a backup of your already configured files ...
and install cnews and uucp completely new ... read the faq ...
And everything should run.

BTW, I'm using cnews from SLS 1.01 and compiled taylor uucp 1.04
completely knew, because I upgraded gcc to 2.4.5, gas to 2.2.1 and
the shared libs to 4.4.1 ...

Since the lpd program doesn't run under a certain "meta" user id
lp or daemon, it runs under the user id of the user, who initiated
the print job ....
Therefore each user needs permission for reading and writing in 
the spool directory. My spool directory - as predefined in the
SLS 1.01 installation - has the permissions rwxrwxrwx like /tmp.

Do a chmod 777 /usr/spool/lp1, and it should work ...

  I have upgraded from SLS 1.01 to SLS 1.03 because it seemed to make
a lot of changes that I was making manually.  Anyhow, the net-2
software doesn't seem to communicate with the rest of the network at
any level?  Does anyone have any suggestions as to why the network is
unreachable from the newly upgraded machine, but the other machines on
the network that are still SLS 1.01 can ping the upgraded machine?  No
other network communication works (telnet, ftp, rsh, rlogin).

Wrong. lpd is always run as root. If you want others to be able to
start it make it suid.  And the spool directories should not be
public since lpr is sgid. The spool directories should have group
write permission and should belong to the same group as lpr (usually
group=lp). See printing-FAQ, or printing-HOWTO or whatever we're
calling it this week :-) 

BTW /tmp should be rwxrwxrwt not rwxrwxrwx unless you want
non-priviledged users to be able to delete each other's files.

How do I eliminate the 'hostname login:' and restore to just 'login:' on
incoming telnet connections? MCC's getty doesn't have an /etc/gettydefs or
/etc/gettytab file, so I'm wondering where do I change this and how?

I find this layout rather annoying and would like the regular:
login:
Password:

Any ideas on how to set this up? (I've also tried getty_pos with no luck,
as it doesn't mention ttyp*)

rnews has to be in the PATH. That was a problem I had with my SLS 1.02, but 
I think the log file would tell something about "rnews: permission denied" 
in that case... "Exit Status 1" looks more like wrong file/directory 
permissions somewhere...

The total RSS is 9780. If I substract ps aux process, 224, it
comes to 9556. So by simple arithmetic, it has exceed the used memory
number reported by free. Why?

Also, for the swap file, I run ps axmp, the results are as follows:

The total SWAP is only 89 which is must less than the figure
in free for swap: 356. So I am wondering, is there a problem
with the free program, or did I miss something?

Sorry for the long post.

If your printer can print on both sides of the paper you must
also add an empty page near the beginning or you will get odd page
numbers on the left end even ones on the right.
