Actually, I've wondered about using inexpensive SCSI cards to create a network.
Maybe 5 MBytes/sec for SCSI-1 or 10 MBytes/sec for SCSI-2 fast mode.  I gather
that some SCSI chipsets can handle being targets as well.  10 MBytes/sec
beats ethernet (until one of the 100Base?? schemes comes down in price at
least).  Sounds more attractive than parallel ports, anyway.  Some SCSI
cards aren't much more expensive than enhanced parallel ports.

(Of course, you are limited to short distances, and 8 nodes).

Does anyone know of a shareware/freeware version of the xterms' that
come with DEC machines? It comes with DECs' version of Xwindows and
is really just a very fancy xterm. I can't say that I like Ultrix
a whole lot - but I do find the DECterms' quite nice. Pointers to
ftp sites or sources would be greatly appreciated.

Hey kids, could I get a copy of the answer, too, please ?

Then, Is the LapLink Parallel cable wired correctly for PLIP ???

well... for me the problem was a timing problem with the modem.
i solved it by adding delays in all init-strings.

use \d in /etc/default/uugetty.ttyx init-strings
use \d in /usr/lib/uucp/Dialers init-sequence

hope this helps...

I had this problem, too (although the mentioned tricks with high debug level
didn't work). I converted my configuration files to Taylor mode. In Taylor
mode, it's possible to increase the timeout value.

I think I figured out how to enable SVGA text mode switching:  use

vga=ask

in the /etc/lilo/config...

I haven't tried it yet, someone else is using my computer, I'll check on it.

I can't  help... But I can say that I am running Taylor-UUCP 1.04 under
Linux since it came out, and my machine calls every day two 386BSD systems,
running the same uucp program: No problem for months.

We just compiled the Taylor sources, nothing special... I use the HDB
config, they use the Taylor one.

I had a sony_535 for a long time (on my DOS-machine). I moved it to
my Linux-machine when I reveived the Yggdrasil distribution (Fall '93).
That's pl13 and the boot-floppy recognizes the sony-drive and installs
from it right out of the box (it has /dev/sonycd_535). However, moving
from SLS to Yggdrasil means setting up everything from scratch and in
a completely different way.

Your name seems to be german, you are from Dortmund and you have a *.de
mail address. So I brilliantly conclude: you understand german.

On the g1 disk you will find the dintro package. It's a 70 pages Unix
introduction in german. You should find it at every german linux-ftp-server,
for example down here in Duesseldorf on 134.99.128.3.

I mount the floppy as root (I will eventually make a setuid program to do
this), and the permissions are rwx------.  I do chmod on the directory
(both before and after the mount) to make it 777, but the permissions
remain rwx------.  

Am I missing an option for the mount command?
  (Nothing in man pages on this)
Is there an easy way to solve this?

Thanks for your insight.
