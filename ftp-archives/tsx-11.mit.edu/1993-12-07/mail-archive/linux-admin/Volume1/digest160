GIFs should compress well?  What makes you say this?  Generally, things
that are already compressed (such as GIF files) don't compress well when
passed through a second compression.  Normally, they expand.

   a good number of the programs are duplicated.  There is a /bin/cmp and
   a /usr/bin/cmp for example.  The binaries aren't exactly the same.
   If I were just to guess, I would think that some came in gnu packages

   I was just wondering which binaries I need and wich ones I should
   get rid of?  (If I have to, I'll just get rid of them all and make

I would suspect that the binaries are duplicated to support "single
user" mode. Single user mode only mounts the root partition (assuming
one has multiple partitions). Thus, the binaries in /bin are available.
If everything (meaning / & /usr) is in one partition, then they are
indeed superfluous. I would then suggest linking /bin to /usr/bin
mainly because of shell scripts that expect sh, csh, etc to be in
/bin. On my Sun for example, /bin is linked to /usr/bin.

Typically (at least in my experience), binaries for single user mode
would be found in /sbin and would be statically linked. I find it odd
that shared libraries are in /lib and static libraries are in
/usr/lib. Although, I suspect that this also to support single user
mode when needed.

you will never see 12-14kbps (i am assuming a 14.4K modem).  i get about
2.5Kbytes/sec for text files and 1.5Kbytes/sec for binary and compressed 
files.  from the people i have talked to, this seems to be typical

The Linux HOWTO Index 
Matt Welsh, <mdw@sunsite.unc.edu>
=============================================================================
Last Modified 31 October 1993

This is an introduction and index to the Linux HOWTO documents. 

0. What are Linux HOWTOs?

        Linux HOWTOs are short online documents which describe in detail
        a certain aspect of configuring or using the Linux system. For 
        example, there is the Installation HOWTO, which gives instructions
        on installing Linux, and the Mail HOWTO, which describes how to
        set up and configure mail under Linux. Other examples include the
        NET-2-HOWTO (previously the NET-2-FAQ) and the Linux-vs-386BSD HOWTO.

        Information in HOWTOs is generally more detailed and in-depth than
        what can be squeezed into the Linux FAQ. For this reason, the
        Linux FAQ is being rewritten. A large amount of the information
        contained therein will be relegated to various HOWTO documents.
        The FAQ will be a shorter list of frequently asked questions about 
        Linux, covering small specific topics. Most of the ``useful'' 
        information in the FAQ will now be covered in the HOWTOs. 

        HOWTOs are comprehensive docs---much like an FAQ but generally not
        in question-and-answer format. However, many HOWTOs contain an FAQ
        section at the end. For example, the NET-2-FAQ has been renamed to
        the NET-2-HOWTO, because it wasn't in question-and-answer format. 
        However, you will see the NET-2-HOWTO named as the NET-2-FAQ in many
        places. The two docs are one and the same.


1. Where to get Linux HOWTOs

        HOWTOs can be retrieved via anonymous FTP from the following
        sites:

                sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO

                tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/docs/HOWTO

        The Index, printed below, lists the currently available HOWTOs.

        HOWTOs are also posted regularly to the newsgroups comp.os.linux
        and comp.os.linux.announce. In addition, a number of the HOWTOs
        will be crossposted to news.answers. Therefore, you can find the
        Linux HOWTOs on the news.answers archive site rtfm.mit.edu.


2. HOWTO Index
        
        The following Linux HOWTOs are currently available. The list
        is small, because this is a relatively new project. 

        * INSTALLATION HOWTO. How to obtain and install Linux. This is the
          first document which a Linux newcomer should read. It discusses
          how to obtain Linux, both from the Internet and via Snail-mail,
          and how to install it. Focuses primarily on the SLS distribution
          of Linux, which is the current de facto standard.

        * Linux INFO-SHEET. A general technical introduction to Linux,
          listing its features, supported hardware, and other general
          information. 

        * Linux META-FAQ. A list of sources of information about Linux,
          such as documentation, newsgroups, FTP sites, and so on.

        * NET-2 HOWTO. Describes how to install and configure the Linux NET-2 
          TCP/IP code, in kernels 0.99.pl10 and above. (This has nothing 
          to do with the so-called BSD NET-2 distribution.) Discusses various
          aspects of TCP/IP networking under Linux, including the use of SLIP.
          The complete instruction manual for TCP/IP under Linux.
        
        * Ethernet HOWTO. A HOWTO about the various Ethernet device drivers
          which are available for Linux. Should be read along with the NET-2
          HOWTO by anyone using Ethernet for TCP/IP on Linux.

        * XFree86 HOWTO. This HOWTO describes how to install and configure
          XFree86-2.0 for Linux. Most of this is Linux-specific, and expects
          you to read the documentation included in the XFree86-2.0 package.

        * Mail HOWTO. All about configuration of electronic mail with Linux,
          including UUCP and TCP/IP mailers such as Smail and sendmail.

        * UUCP HOWTO. How to configure UUCP to transfer files, mail, and
          news to other UNIX machines on a UUCP-based connection. Includes
          discussion of Taylor UUCP for Linux.
        
        * News HOWTO. Setup and configuration of news software, such as 
          C News, INN, and newsreaders (such as rn and tin) under Linux.

        * Printing HOWTO. How to configure and use printing software under
          Linux, such as lp, lpr, etc. including remote printing.

        * SCSI HOWTO. All about SCSI tapes, drives, and CD-ROMs under Linux.

        * Hardware Compatibility HOWTO. An extensive list of hardware 
          supported by Linux.


        WANTED. I would be very happy if someone would write the following 
        HOWTO documents, and submit them to me (see the instructions in
        the next section below). Most of these are modifications of existing
        FAQ documents, and should be easy to put into HOWTO format. Keep in
        mind that HOWTOs generally aren't in FAQ format, but can contain an
        FAQ section at the end.

        Some of these are under construction; however, if you're interested
        in working on one of them, please let me know.

        * GCC/LIBRARY HOWTO. Discussing installation/upgrading of the GCC 
          and shared libraries under Linux. How to build shared libraries.
          Most of the material would come from Mitchum DeSouza's GCC FAQ. 

        * KERNEL HOWTO. How to upgrade and compile the kernel. Basic kernel
          tweaking, including how to turn on debugging output. How to decrypt
          panic messages. Basic introduction to kernel structure and hacking.
          (Under constructions, mdw@sunsite.unc.edu).
        
        * SERIAL HOWTO. All of the ins and outs about serial communications
          under Linux, including use of getty for dialins. Perhaps a section
          on FAX software.


3. Writing and submitting a HOWTO

        If you would like to write a Linux HOWTO document, there are a few
        guidelines that you should follow. 

        * Format the document neatly. HOWTOs must be available in plain 
          ASCII format, but you are free to use a formatting tool (texinfo,
          LameTeX, nroff) to format the document. Try to use meaningful
          structure and organization, and write clearly. Remember that
          many of the people reading HOWTOs do not speak English as their
          first language.

        * Make sure that all of the information is correct. I can't stress
          this enough. When in doubt, speculate, but make it clear that
          you're only guessing. 

        * Make sure that you are covering the most recent version of the
          available software. Also, be sure to include full instructions
          on where software can be downloaded from (FTP site name, full
          pathname). 

        * Include an FAQ section at the end, if appropriate. Many HOWTO
          documents need an "FAQ" or "Common Problems" section to cover
          information which can't be covered in the regular text.

        * Use other HOWTOs as a model. It is nice to have a common look and
          feel to HOWTO documents--- this document being an example. The
          easier the HOWTO is to browse, the more useful it will be to
          readers.


        After you have written the HOWTO, mail it to me (Matt Welsh) at
        mdw@sunsite.unc.edu. I am the HOWTO coordinator---I will look 
        over the HOWTO, and make any editorial remarks. I will also take
        care of approving and posting the HOWTO to the various newsgroups
        and uploading the HOWTO to the FTP archive sites. Of course,
        all credit for the HOWTO will go to the author.

        It is important that you go through me when submitting a HOWTO. I
        maintain the HOWTO archives and need to keep track of what HOWTOs
        are being written and who is doing what. If you don't submit a
        HOWTO to me, I can't include it in the archive or add it to the
        HOWTO INDEX. 

        I can also help to reformat the HOWTO if needed to make it look
        nicer. :) Once I have approved the HOWTO, I will post it and
        upload it to the FTP sites. I will also send you (the author) 
        the "final" version of the HOWTO with any changes. All you have
        to do is send me periodic updates (every month or so, as needed)
        and I will take care of posting the HOWTO regularly. 


3. Miscellaneous and Legalese

        If you have questions, please feel free to mail mdw@sunsite.unc.edu.
        The Linux FAQ rewrite is being coordinated by Ian Jackson, 
        ijackson@nyx.cs.du.edu, with help from others.

        distribute verbatim copies of HOWTOs in any medium, provided that
        the copyright notice and authorship remains intact.
