Actually, you need an older version for pl11 - the kbd.tar.gz archive is
for the newer pl12 kernel which is in alpha right now (hope to make it
official by the weekend).  The pl12 kernel allows a much more complete
re-mapping of keys, so that almost *anything* is re-mappable (it's not
perfect: it might be useful to install separate maps for different VC's,
and separate maps for the "sticky" mode keys like caps-lock and num-lock
would also be even cleaner than the current setup).

reason _not_ to use shadow passwords.  "Impractical" applies only if a
hacker is not bound and determined to break into your machine -- in
the extreme case, someone might set a transputer onto your password

complicated passwords are usually syllabic.  Why leave a security hole

Anyone know any tips on getting SLS 1.03 up on the net?  I have been
using SLS for a few versions, with no trouble.  This time, though,
the NET, for me, is a no-go.

I checked EVERYTHING per various postings I have seen, as well as the
NET-2-FAQ.  No joy...

All I get are lots of annoying "eth0 ..." messages.

Does SLS 1.03 not work with the WD8003 (without building a kernel), or am I
just an idiot?  Any good docs to read?

Is Slackware easier to get up?  I have Adaptec 1542C and WD8003.
I need to get this up FAST so I can load OS/2!

Minor point: "Crack" is a password cracker, "CrackLib" (above) is a
library designed to enhance the functionality of many password
protection suites (eg: shadow) by preventing users from using obviously
guessable passwords.

Here's the software setup;

SLS 1.02/.99.p11 (soon to be .p12)/gcc-2.4.5/libc-4.4.1/include-4.4.1/image-4.4.1/
net-2 binaries.

I am trying to get an HP DJ500C working with my system.  It's attached to
/dev/lp2, using int 5 as you'd normally expect.  I've installed the filter to
convert lf=lf+cr (get around staircase effect), and have been able to
successfully do :

/usr/lib/hpif <~/Xconfig >/dev/lp2   (hpif is the filter name)

However, for some reason I can't seem to get anything out of the system if
i do:

lpr -Plp2 ~/Xconfig

I have a seperate spool area, /usr/spool/lp2, to handle this printer.  when 
I issue lpq, i get a message saying that there are no entries (more than likely
due to default to lp1 area).  But, when I use lpc and check the status,
I see that there are a number of jobs queued in the spool area....that the
printer is enabled, and all the other stuff...but the daemon isn't active.

if i then type in 'start lp2', i see the 'daemon started' message but still,
no output from the system.

what am i missing?

After reading every post I can find, NET-2-FAQ, and double checking
everything, with SLS 1.03 and a WD8003 I still get

  eth0: bogus packet size, status=0x0 nxpg=0x0 size=0x0
  eth0: bogus packet, status=0x0 nxpg=0x0 size=0x0
  eth0: mismatched read page pointers   c vs 0.

Also, I get the all-too-common "Network not found" error after the
route add commands.
Naturally, pinging myself works...

The rc.net looks like:

  ifconfig eth0 131.158.54.21 broadcast 131.158.54.255 netmask 255.255.255.0
  route add 131.158.54.21  # tried with and without this

  ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1 up netmask 255.255.255.0
  route add 127.0.0.1 lo

My /etc/networks is just

  nmimc 131.158.54.0

Note that I made up the "nmimc" - it corresponds to nothing else.
I don't know what to put here.  My hostname and domain, I don't think,
fit...
The hardware is good, works with DOS and SLS 1.02.

This is only true with bootlin.com 1.3. Version 1.4 is supposed to
solve that problem. Bootlin.com does work in the config.sys very
nicely. :) If you have MS-DOS 6.0, the built in menu works great!
It also has the advantage of having multiple compilations to
chose from. If you want, you can keep pl9 to boot from as a
standby when trying a new alpha kernel or drivers. :)

You can do this easily enough after loading linux by using the rdev
command on your Image file that you place on your MS-DOS partition.

Thanks guys!  I changed the Linux machine's /etc/group so that root is
only a member of the root group.  Then I could NFS-mount.  The limiting
number of groups might be more than just one, I didn't experiment.  (The
/etc/group file supplied by SLS 1.03 lists root as a member of about half
a dozen groups, but this is redundant since root can do whatever she
pleases anyway :-).)

I did *not* have to reduce root's group membership on the HP machines.

It appears to me this is a genuine bug in the Linux NFS implementation:
if it can't cope with more than one group, why doesn't it just use the
current GID and be done with it?

In the short run, this problem and its workaround probably ought to be
listed in the FAQ.

(Side note: if you encounter this problem, you must log out and in again
after fixing /etc/group, but it is not necessary to reboot.  Apparently
the group membership info is cached on a per-session basis?)

Despite the paranoid hysteria, the chances of your system being broken into
aren't very high.  Just use intelligent passwords (ie *not words from the
dictionary*), run COPS (or something similar) every now and then, and don't
give out your password to anyone.  IMHO shadow passwords are overkill for
a Linux workstation (unless you allow access to a bunch of bored cs
undergrads :-).

Think about it ... if someone really wants to gain access to your Linux
system, all they need is a bootable-root floppy.

You don't need a cray for this! Especially if you have some nice people

It rewinds because the default device for mt is /dev/rmt0, which is
the rewind device.  If you really want to do mt weof, say "mt -f
/dev/nrmt0 weof", but see below, since this is rarely needed.

The kernel will automatically write an eof on the tape when tar closes
/dev/nrmt0.  At that point, you can issue the second tar command and
it will create another file on the tape.

You also need good passwords that are not in any of the current
dictionary attack schema, or if they are, are part of schema that are
so huge that it would be impractical to try them in general.

Generally mixing case, numbers and punctutation will help.  Two words,
slightly mispelled, can also be good.  Random characters are the best
(unless they appear in system documentation as good passwords).

As with many things ... it depends. For example, my Linux system at
home is not connected to any network. The modem won't accept incoming
calls (plus, there is no getty running on the modem). The only two
people who have a key to the house are my wife and me. For all it
matters, we don't even need passwords; we have family members visiting
once in a while, they are usually not computer-literate enough to pose
a threat. If a burgler breaks in, he is much more likely to cart the
whole machine away, than to set up a network, NFS-mount the rootdisk,
crack the passwords, and log in and do damage to my system :-)

Obviously, any machine used (a) on a network where other people can
get access to the /etc partition or (b) where other people can attempt
to log in or (c) physically accessible to possible malicious people is
in a very different situation. Obviously, in such a case shadow
passwords (or NIS) is not only a good idea, but a necessity. Even
then, I would worry much more about someone walking into my office
while I'm at lunch, carrying a bootable rootdisk and hitting the reset
button (or for that matter, walking away with my CPU box in his
backpack).

I don't feel the floppy drive setup on my machine is
as good as it could be.  Anybody out there have any
ideas how it could be better?

Right now they are set like:
brw-rw-r--   1 root     floppy     2,   0 Aug 29  1992 fd0

and I end up su'ing to root to do anything with a floppy.
I don't like doing that every time I use a floppy.

Mtools do fine reading from MS-DOS floppies as a general
user.  If a non-su tries to mount a minix floppy, even
if the floppy is protected rw-rw-rw-, he/she/I get the
 "can't create lock file /etc/mtab~: Permission denied"
error.  I am attached directly to internet, so I shouldn't
just make /etc world writable.

I tried monkeying with groups, but since I both don't
know the rules on group setup, and I am not really sure
what I am trying to do with the permissions, I naturally
did not come up with anything constructive.

My setup came from SLS a long time ago, I am running
0.99pl6 on one computer (its about time to upgrade)
and 0.99pl11 on another.  Thanks for your comments.
