Why not just update the version of  libc?  It is not to
hard.  

cd /usr/src/libc-linux
make LITE=true
mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /mnt
rm -f /mnt/lib/libc*
cp libc-lite.so.4.4.4 /mnt/lib/libc-lite.so.4.4.4
ln /mnt/lib/libc-lite.so.4.4.4 /mnt/lib/libc.so.4

Likewise you can always replace the  kernel as well...


If you  want to make your own boot disk instead, then you can
use the makeboot script someone posted a couple of weeks  ago.
The only modifications needed for 5.25 is to:

   1) copy libc-lite instead of libc
   2) copy ash instead of bash
-or- alternatively you could with a little work use csh526.

In fact this leaves you enough space that you can add a couple of
extra goodies to your emergency disk.

mv doesn't use a link(), unlink() pair, it uses rename(). It is

This will work fine. No probs. There is no 'mv' command in the above.

This IS the normal behavior. Remember that Linux is not MS-DOS, and
`mv' is not `move'. B^>

>Is this a feature? It certainly is unexpected behavior.

I consider the inability of the DOS `move' to do this a misfeature.
I use this feature of mv very often and find it quite the expected
behavior.

Did you have excessive contact with a DOS system recently? I heard you
have to put your right index finger into your left ear and stand on

directories.

Date: Thu, 4 Nov 1993 14:02:20 GMT

I am thinking of getting a SL/IP connection and would REALLY appreciate
the input from any Slackware 1.0.5 users out there on...

  1) Does SL/IP as included with Slackware 1.0.5 WORK (once configured)?

  2) Is there a USENET reader included with Slackware that works over
     SL/IP and supports NNTP?

  3) Does mail (SMTP) run over SL/IP?

  4) My SL/IP connection will be limited to 2 hours/day ($35).  Is it
     reasonable to expect to be able to download about 30 SMTP e-mail
     messages and about 15 newsgroups a day in 2 hours/day???  I am
     especially concerned about how quickly the SL/IP server will
     recognize my system and start downloading after I connect.  If it
     takes an hour to notice my system is there, and I only have 2 hours...

It sure would be nice to get my Linux system on the net, free of the shackles
of my employer! 

Any comments, anytime, anywhere VERY MUCH appreciated!!!

  This works in Slackware by using /INSTALL/packages as the directory.

  But...this only works on things you have officially intalled.  What
about that package you put in your home src/misc/games/video/ directory?
There is always the find command, but for people used to 20 NFS mounted
partitions each with 1 gig, that isn't really acceptable.  There is a
program called locate which is part of GNU find, which is of help.  If
you look in /usr/lib/locate, there is a program called updatedb, which
will make a database of all the files on your system.  You should modify
this to correctly handle your system, then run it in cron (or by hand
every now and then if you're really lazy).  Then the command:
  locate <whatever-I-can't-find> | less
will return in a few seconds with _any_ file on your system that matches
your text.  You might want to narrow this further with grep in some cases.
(neat feature: locate / | wc tells how many files are on your system)

My suspicion is that the modem takes a finite time to bring up carrier detect.  
So the computer hangs up when it looks at it.  On the other hand the -x
option eats up enough cycles so that by the time the computer gets to look
at the modem, the carrier detect is up.  I had this exact problem with
a USR Sportster internal.

Send a /p delay after receiving the CONNECT string in the Dialers chat script.
So that uucico doesn't look for DCD until about 0.5 sec after CONNECT.

Hope this works.  Considering the number of "me toos" when I myself posted
this problem on c.o.l.h a while back, it oughta be in the FAQ.

(Minor nit: even though there is much more work to read it, this proves it's 
worth following c.o.l.help!)

Okay, I didn't get any reply, so here goes once again.

I have SLS linux 1.3, and have setup lpd spooling. I can now print,
but it only prints out banner pages indefinitely. When I remove banner
printing using ':sh:' in /etc/printcap, nothing comes out, which I guess
lpd/lpr/lpf whatever is trying to print banner in an infinite loop
but doesn't since ':sh:' is set. ps shows lpd and lpf are running, and
lpq shows 'Printer ready and printing'. lprm, lpc all works fine,
either from root or user.

So what causes this infinite banner printing, and how do I fix it?
Thank you.
