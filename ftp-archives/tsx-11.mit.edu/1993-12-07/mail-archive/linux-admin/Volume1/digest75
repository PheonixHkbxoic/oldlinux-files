Date: 24 Sep 1993 18:26:22 GMT

I've had a hell of a time getting things working right under the latest
TAMU Linux release.  Now, finally, everything *works*... except "more".

No, it's *not* a permissions problem, and yes, I *know* that "less" would
still work... but it really makes me nervous.   What could be the difference
between logging in then doing startx and logging in through xdm?  Why on
earth would it screw up "more"???

Here's the scoop:

In the beginning (when I installed Linux [TAMU.99pl12+] onto a clean drive),
all I had to do was login as root and type "startx"... and everything worked.
 (Actually, I had to futz with the Xconfig, but that's beside the point.)
Then I thought, "It's not good to be root all the time."  So I created "rick".

I copied all the 'hidden' files from / to /home/rick, then logged in as
rick.  Then I tried to "startx"...  The "File Manager" and "xclock" came
up alright, but no "xterm".  Flipping back to virtual console #1 showed
me that xterm couldn't find "//libXaw.so.3".  Well, I thought that was
strange, since LD_LIBRARY_PATH was properly set in my .profile.

Why wasn't the proper library path searched for "rick" even though it
showed no problem for "root"?


WHERE SHOULD I DEFINE LD_LIBRARY_PATH SO THAT IT WILL GET SEARCHED???


Starting "xdm" showed similar troubles, which I'm still sorting out.

I've got an interim solution (a workaround, really) where all of the
shared libraries in /usr/X386/lib are symbolically linked up to the
root directory.  It's *ugly*, folks.   ...and "more" doesn't work.


It's really wierd!  Any user, logging in then using "startx", has no
problems at all.  It works great.  But if I use "xdm", *NOBODY* can get
"more" to work properly.  It displays the first 24 lines, then exits.


Can anyone give me a clue what could cause "more" to behave this way???

It is not system dependent. If a system allows setuid scripts to be executed,
then they can be gotten around. I am referring to current system's here.
Even if you fix the race condition, the environment coming in plays a big
factor. Also, as one person already pointed out, the -i trick still works
plenty of times as well.

Are you going to clear the environment for setuid scripts as well? If not,
its rather simple to get around it once again.

That linux does this has always been a good thing in my mind, but I really
doubt no matter what you do that shell scripts can made secure always.

I don't think so. What if I do this before I run your "safe" shell script?

cd /tmp
cat bin

#!/bin/sh
IFS=" "
export IFS
/bin/sh

PATH=.:$PATH;export PATH
IFS="  \";export IFS
<run script>

Are you going to require the kernel to clear the environment before calling
setuid shell scripts?? This is a groddy hack to have to put in a kernel,
and definitly shouldn't have to be in the shell either.

Setuid shell scripts in general are a bad idea, and people really shouldn't
watse valuable time trying to hack in a "safe" way to do them when  other
easier methods could be used.

OK, I read quite a bit of Linux documentation, from old FAQ's to new
HOWTO's and even ALPHA version of SAG, but I haven't found an answer 
to this question (which is why I'm posting it to this newsgroup):

I'm going to install Linux on my machine within next two weeks.  I'll
be the sole user and administrator of it so I want to get a good
sys admin book on this.  I read a few bibliographies, and in Unix
Review August 1992, Richard Morin writes "BSD (SunOS 4.x) administrators
should get the classic _UNIX System Administrator's Handbook_.  SVR4
(SunOS 5.x) administrators should buy UNIX System V Release 4 Admini-
stration..."

Well, here is the problem: which one of these is more applicable to
Linux administration since it is neither/both BSD and SVR4??  Or maybe
some of you have some other personal favorite that you could recommend to
me?  BTW, I've got the SAG ALPHA 1, and it is really ALPHA.  I definitely
need some other book in addition to it.

For Slackware (where this discussion originated a long time ago) you have the
right answer but the wrong reason. Slackware has a 5.25 boot/root pair or
disks at ftp.cdrom.com:/pub/linux/test. You can boot your system with the
pair and load the distribution with the 3.5" floppy.

Rick has reported that he has run into problems running more under xdm.  I have experienced problems running gdb under xdm.  Furthermore, a program we were writing using curses spontatiously bus errored every time we ran it while waiting on input within the standard curses calls.  Looking at the core file, we didn't even find a main() frame..??!  Also, (using ext2fs),the file system sporadically fails.

The gdb failure I am speaking of is strange.  It complained that it could find the file that we requested to debug, even thought we could attempt to run it, and it started.  (It was the curses program)

All this is very confusing to me.  How could one process conflict with others?  ALL the problems went away, when we took the same actions from within a console.

   Personally, I use the Unix System V Release 4 Administration book
published by Hayden Books.  I've been through just about every major
section, and have yet to find anything that didn't relate pretty
directly to Linux administration.  It's a little simplistic at times,
but useful.

Hmm, which is more of a problem?  Which is more likely to keep people from
trying Linux out:  "Oh no, I have to format these 5 extra disks," or "Oh no,
I have to go out and buy a new drive"?  

A 386 with just a 5.25 should BE a reasonable setup for running Linux.  It
was before Slackware came out.  You just seem to consider what YOU have to
be what is reasonable.  What if Slackware was only available on tape?  Lots
of people have tape drives (I and most of my friends do).  Is that
reasonable?  I don't think so.

True, but many people don't get Linux electronically.  Many people get it in
a box.  That's the whole idea behind putting distributions together in disk
images.  

Even if they were downloading it, why should a person have to call another
computer 3 or 4 times to install Slackware in pieces when they don't have
to.  They don't have to with SLS.

Kinda tough when you are  Joe average-BBS-caller.

This increases the space needed to install Slackware from about 90MB to
130MB.

This is no better than telling people to buy one.

The point of a distribution is to help people.  If you have to jump through
hoops to get it installed, what is the point?  Your recommendations still
leave out the HUGE number of potential Linux users out there with a 386, a
100MB HD, and a 5.25" floppy drive at home.  SLS doesn't leave these users
out.  Why does Slackware?

You obviously know what you are doing.  I'm concerned about the average DOS

Well, I think Slackware is great!  That's the whole point.  But you are
leaving quite a few users behind in your striving for being up to date, and
you don't have to.  

I don't mean to sound like I am flaming Slackware.  I see Slackware becoming
the STANDARD Linux distribution like SLS was before Peter MacDonald decided
to be very un-linux-like with his install script restrictions and turned
people off.  I would like to see this happen because Slackware seems to be
much better put together than SLS, but this 3.5-only restriction will hold
it back.

Thanks to a lot of very nice advice, I've gotten the test boot images and

Date: Sat, 25 Sep 1993 03:43:05 GMT

I came home from work today to find that UUCP had failed to poll for 10
hours on this system.

Although I have Taylor UUCP 1.04 configured to hunt through 3 different
outbound modems, the configuration isn't smart enough to skip over a
wedged modem, only a busy one.  It repeatedly tries, once every half hour,
to use the wedged unit without skipping to the next one.

Any solution to this?

Oh, and I'm wondering if anyone has gotten a multiline UUCP system
running without hung modems under Linux--I've been running mine for
months, and have upgraded to better modems which themselves don't
hang, but once every few days I have to reset a line because of
software glitches.  It's probably a combination of effects between the
ZyXEL firmware rev level, the Linux serial driver, and the combination
of UUCP and getty software I'm running.  If you have a stable
combination of these elements I could try to recreate it here.

thanks,
