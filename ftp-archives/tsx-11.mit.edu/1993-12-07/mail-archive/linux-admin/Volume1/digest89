Hi,

After a bit of tweaking, I managed to get my keyboard remapped to support
French characters (for a Qwerty instead of an Azerty keyboard, as defined in
fr-latin1.map).  Anyways, what I want to do now is to allow pressing F1 in the
us and qc keyboard maps, to allow toggling between the two mappings.  How do I
do this without breaking the key entirely for other programs?

I have a Diamond Speedstar 24X and desperately want to get X running.  Does
anyone out there have one or know of someone who has got it working?  Any
info (besides go buy another card) would be great.  You can post a response
or send me e-mail to szmansky@cps.msu.edu.  Thank You in advance.

I'll second the nomination. This is the only book that I carry to work
and bring back home with me every day. It's beginning to look a little
ragged :)

For un*x internals try: "The Design and Implementation of the
4.3BSD UNIX(r) Operating System" by Leffler,Quarterman, et al
An amazing book, and quite a bit of it applies to Linux.

BTW, I won't buy computer books without some variant of lay flat binding
anymore, which restricts me to Nutshell (funny, I don't feel restricted).
Rule does not apply to K&R or K&P

It only costs about 2 or 3 bucks to take a paperback to Kinko's and have
them cut off the end and spiral bind it. Pocket change next to the price
of most of those books...

Date: 3 Oct 1993 02:39:59 -0500

I just installed a Netcom 3c503 card in my Linux box (pl13, net2 debug 2)
but I have had some problems with the autoirq routine.  It grabs
IRQ3 (which is used by the com1).  I can use lilo to tell it to use IRQ9
by doing the "lilo: linux ether=9,0x300,0,1,eth0" but that is a pain.
Can I force it to use IRQ9 some otherway?  Or can I configure this as
a "default" option in lilo???

The regular NIS services use well know ports. It is there for
not very complex, but time consuming to implement
a paswrd, group or other info sharing.
From what I have read, you can use NFS to export you directories
nut you will need the NIS services for user info.
Why not use RPC and write your own passwd query program.
Install that Daemon on the server at a well known ports.

As a reference, and a good example of implementation
of NIS, look a the book
Power Programming with RPC from John Bloomer,
edition O'Reilly & Associates, Inc, 1992.

The essence of such a project is time, rather than complexity.

WHAT ??
With a regular PC you use dumb drives, which offer access to the raw
surface, and it depends completely on the controller in the PC, what bits
you put where on the disk.  The controllers are quite flexible these
days (you can even run floppy streamers off most of them (all?)).

Writing short gaps even works with IBM PS/2 mickey-channel machines,
so it should work on every other available hardware out there.

You will have some problems with reading the format depending on the
OS you're using.  OS/2 wont read nonstandard formats, and with MS-DOS
you might have problems with the bios.  With Linux you have to fiddle
with setparms to get it right.  For MS-DOS there is a program called
FDFORMAT (should be available via simtel20 as FDFORM18.ZIP), which
contains a small TSR that will disks with a nonstandard format
(short gaps, more sectors per track) readable under DOS.
It's funny, though, that OS/2 will boot from such a drive, even though it
can't read files off the disk once it's up and running (at least when
I tried it).

Too bad that LILO won't boot a floppy with a nonstandard format either.

Subject: Mounting with NFS
Date: 3 Oct 1993 17:58:52 +0100

  Has anyone managed to get one linux machine to export an nfs
mount to another machine which was READWRITE? No matter what I
try, I can only get READONLY access. The mount reports that everything
went well, but trying to write to the filesystem gives a readonly
error.

 I tried an export like:
   /usr nucleus 
and
   /usr nucleus rw

and a fstab like
   obsidian:/usr  /usr  nfs
and
   obsidian:/usr  /usr  nfs     rw

But nothing appears to make any difference. The only thing I can think of
is that I have commented out syslogd from the rc.d/inet.rc2 file. This was
necessary since it caused a number of errors, probably brought on by shadow passwords.
I still have a syslogd line in thr rc file though. I would have installed 
the networking with shadow passwords support, but someone has deleted it from
the archive (location described in NET-2-HOWTO).

 Any ideas?
Gordon

Date: 3 Oct 1993 19:56:19 +0200

Since upgrading to Linux 0.99.12 (via SLS 1.03) the mountd process is very
unstable. It sometimes accepts the first mount request from 0.99.10 Linux
box and then stops responding altough the mountd process still exists.
The PC executing trying to mount reports rpc time out while on the
server the rpcinfo reports before the first mount attempt:
                program 100005 version 1 ready and waiting
but after it it reports:
                rpc info: RPC: Timed out
                program 100005 version 0 is not available
Such problems did not exist when the server was running 0.99.6
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Hi there, although my 2cents come a bit late, I had a similar problem using
sysinstall and solved it quite different than suggested in this thread earlier.
Maybe my problem and solution are unique to SLS 1.03 of August 18/29 1993, but
here it comes:

        problem:        sysinstall -series whatever
                        did not do anything but printing the usage-statements
                        and short help

        solution:       in the following exerpt from sysinstall a ; was missing,
                        replaced it, and it worked fine.

The excerpt:

        elif [ "$1" = "-series" -a $# = 2 ]; then
                DoInstall $2;
                            ^--- this here was missing!

Please remember that this may be unique to SLS 1.03, but who knows...

Hi,

I am trying to re-install SLS 1.03 (some X stuff was garbled when I
first downloaded it). I deleted previous partitions, repartitioned
the hard disk and did mke2fs and mkswap as required. The a2 disk
installs ok, until the very end, then a3 refuses to install, complaining:
"can't create lock file /etc/mtab~: File exists".  As I understand it,
there should be nothing on my /dev/hda2 after the "mke2fs -c /dev/hda2 ...".
I tried it several times, no success.
Please help!
