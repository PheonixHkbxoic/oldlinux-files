1) Recent benchmarks have put Linux and the *BSD's in the same speed class
   other than FS speeds, but this is due to the BSD FFS doing things a bit
   safer with regards to filesystem.  (Yes, you may not have problems, but
   the possibility of damage is much less with the BSD FS as compared to
   the publically available Linux FS)

2) Compatible with what?  Most of the code that is on the Net compiles w/out
   ANY modification on the BSD's, while much of the Linux code (used to)
   require minor tweaks.  This is less so now that Linux fixes have been
   integrated into the main-stream packages, so compatability is not much 
   of an issue.

Depends on what you are doing as to which one is better.  If there are 
1000 Linux users locally and no BSD users, then by all means use Linux.

However, I think you'll find that if you are a University site with
Sun or Ultrix workstations and you have good sys. ads., you'll find they
can help you more with the more standard (to them) BSD systems.

BSD systems have a lot more commercially available documentation than
existing Linux versions (and for those who cry source code is the best
documentation that also exists), but that is changing.

Finally, the two biggest advantages/disadvantages of both system (IMHO) are
actively being changed right now.

1) BSD needs shared libraries, Linux has them
2) Linux needs better networking code, BSD has it.

Both of the above are being implemented NOW, so the differences will be
less clear in the future.  (But that's good for everyone)  When that happens
Linux will be in the running with it's DOS emulator for DOS weenies ;), and
BSD is going places with all sorts of new kernel developments in doing things
more effeciently.  (Some have stated we're dragging the BSD kernel into the
90's, but it's more like the 80's)

The difference between sendmail (any version) and smail is more
a religious one. It has to do with relative ease of getting
some jobs done and readability of configuration files:

- sendmail configuration is said to be a secret science
  including donors of young living cats to a dark godess at
  midnight. sendmails configuration files have similarity to
  line noise or the winning entry into a regular expression
  abuse contest.

  smail configuration files look much more straightforward and
  are easier to read aloud, but this is a trick. The devil is
  in the detail and one should not let himself be fooled into
  the false belief that one understands what is being done in
  this configuration file just because it only contains plain
  english words.

- Certain tasks can be done more easily in sendmail, other
  tasks can be done more easily in smail. Most common mail
  delivery problems are painless in both programs.

In my personal opinion smail is much better for UNIX
beginners, because it does throw that many special characters
at you ("How shall I learn to write a sendmail configuration? I
can even type it if it were given on a sheet of paper to me!").

Another startpoint for religious discussions is the general
approach of both programs to mail headers. Whereas sendmail is
base on header rewriting and actually transforms a message
header, smail only reads it in and parses it, but reproduces
the original header except when explicit rewrite commands are
included into the configuration.

That's not strictly correct.  There have been Unix versions of both Lan 
Manager and Novell available for several years on the commercial market.  
Of course they cost bucks, and are ported only to specific platforms.

Until this fall I ran an early version of a Unix file server for the 
pre-LanMan Microsoft network protocol on an NCR Tower 68020-based system; it 
provided (slooowww) file and print services to a couple of Windows for 
Workgroups clients using TCP/IP transport.

install with a 3COM Ethernet driver, but I fail and can not can
the eth0 interface driver.

        I have no problem with the older release.  Can anyone

Which older release support this adaptor and ethernet adaptor.

Thanks a lot

Subject: Where's the source for /bin/login ?
Date: 4 Dec 1993 01:20:11 GMT

I am now using the modem (mdm206) server that came with slackware's
source code.  It is easier to dialin/dialout with it as it does not
lock the device.  Anyway, the problem i'm having now is that it isn't
printing the /etc/issue before it gives a login: prompt.
I would like to get the source code for login and edit it to add the
cat /etc/issue command to it. Since i'm not a good c programmer (have not
ever had the course actually) I figgered it'd be easier to modify
login than modem206.  With login i could just add it in before
it prints the login: prompt, the way modem206 is made, i would
have to program in a subroutine and modify some code.
Is there a site that has all the source code used to compile the
different distributions?

Date: 06 Dec 1993 19:20:34 GMT

We are using Linux pl12 on IBM 486-DX2/66. When mounting this Linux PC
via NFS on an IBM RS6000 Workstation (AIX 3.2.4) we get the following
message:

UDP: send: length 3040 > mtu 1500 (ignored)

Mounting the IBM RS6000 on the Linux PC works fine. We tried to
enlarge the parameter dev->mtu in 8396.c, but the new kernel told us
something like: kmalloc is called with impossibly large argument(43..).

What must we do to get NFS working correctly ?

This is true of the sendmail.cf file, which no longer needs tweaking

No no no no no. :-)  Read below.

Read the docs which come with sendmail on how to transform this into a
.cf file.  It is a one-liner ("mf < bugs.mc > sendmail.cf" or
something in the appropriate directory), but IMHO basic mail
configuration is something which should be thoroughly understood by
the admin of any box hung off of the Internet.

Does anyone have an Imake template file for Linux/XFree2.0?  I'm running 
0.99pl14 (original installation was the Slackware system...is there an

Even some information about how to set one up would be handy.

I suggest that you start by installing the newest kernel (0.99pl14), as many
network bugs has been corrected since pl12.

The error you get is really that you tried to do a kmalloc() >4Kbytes. The old
pl12 kernel can only allocate one page at the time (ie: 4Kbytes), but that
has been fixed in pl14. This is also why you can have swap devices >16Mb
nowadays (16M = 4K * 4K)

Good luck,

Is this for real?! Can someone confirm this? Linux now allowing kmalloc > 4096 
bytes is a _MAJOR_ development! Heck, it would be really nice if people told 
us things like this, so lazy people like I would get off our *ss and upgrade 
more often! :)

This will help fix/improve many, MANY things! Heck, this is the biggest 
development since thee Big Bang! (okay, perhaps I'm getting carried away... ;)
