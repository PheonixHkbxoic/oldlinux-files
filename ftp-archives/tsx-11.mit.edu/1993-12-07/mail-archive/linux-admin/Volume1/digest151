Hi,

Does anybody can give me an advice about Linux networking and laptop
parallel port Ethernet adapters. Sure, I've saw smth about D-Link pocket
adapter, but all my efforts to find it was in vain. So how about Xircom or
smth other?

Thanks in advance,

Max

        These days, virtually everyone is using an FFS-style
filesystem.  SVR4's ufs does the same sorts of things, and I'm fairly
sure ext2fs does as well.  Not positive, but fairly sure :)

        Now, it would be nice to have an _actual_ BSD FFS for linux,
so that one could communicate between the BSD du jour and linux, using
something other than DOS :)

Subject: Can I recover form partition table loss?
Date: Wed, 10 Nov 1993 22:16:44 GMT

I have left to my son to patch the DOS 6 with 6.2 disks, and he must
have done something wrong with fdisk there, so that now I do not see
my linux partition on the disk any more.

My (IDE) disk was divided into 4 partitions, 40 M DOS, 50M DOS, 16M
Linux Swap, and the rest (approx. 145M) Linux Root. Now only the first
two are there, both MS-DOS and Linux fdisks show only them. Their
starting locations and sizes match to what they were before, which
makes me think that if I could patch-up the partition table, i would
be able to take my Linux Root Partition back...

It is likely that I may not be able to find my notes, about the
starting addresses of two missing partitions, which will make my task
difficult at best, but I hope not impossible.

Please give me any and all advice/suggestions you have. I do not have
e-mail but a friend of mine "hilmi@bnr.ca" accepted to receive and
forward any input on this. 

Please post or e-mail, as you see fit...

Thanks * (10 ^ 6)

If anyone can get the figures on this, I'd *love* to know.  It's not a
particularly USEFUL benchmark except to people who want to use Crack,
but then, I have a vested interest. 8-)


Using UFC's SPARC assembler stub, I measure a SS2 as an easy to
remember 1250eps (ie: encryptions per second).

This was measured on a lightly loaded SS2 using UFC's "speedf" program.

I can't remember what the ss10%50 managed, I think it was about 3100eps


I was interested to find that my PC at home (Dell EISA 486dx2/66
running Linux) can just about match the SS2's performance, but only in
erratic bursts (ie: speedf returns empirical values: 1000, 1050, 1100,
950, 1200, 1280, 1100, 1100, 1050, 850...)

I can't be bothered to do a proper statistical evaluation on it.

The SS2 is a more constant 1240 +/- 10 or thereabouts.

For those who are interested, Eric Young's "libdes" clocks closer to
1400eps on a SS2 but has not (yet) got the same level of
plug-in-and-play compatibility with Crack, that UFC has.

Also, on Linux, if you use UFC in it's incarnation as the stdlib
crypt() in libc.a, rather than obtaining a fresh copy and compiling it
into Crack statically, you *LOSE* up to 200eps, presumably due to
interrupts cause by the shared-library interface.

ext2fs does not yet support fragments (at least as far as I know).

ufs IS BSD-FFS (at least as far as I know).

It looks to me as if the linux superblocks have to contain some
additional information about file sytem type etc. So I think it would
require some major restucturing of the fs code to have a linux-BSD-FFS
be compatible with ???BSD or SunOS.  And there might be a problem with
sector sizes and inode types.

With some reverse engineering the NetBSD file system utilities like
tunefs, newfs and fsck compile nicely on linux, though.

Crossposted to comp.os.linux.development, maybe someone there knows more
about this?

I had about the same thing, with the last two logical partitions messed
up in the partition table. I just linux-fdisked the partition table to
the previous values and got everything working again.  As simple as
that. I hope it works for you, too.

Thank you for your ARP solution!

I have a follow-on question regarding SLIP.  Our company is small and
has a single class C subnet assigned to it (254 addresses- the lower
byte basically).  There is no way we'll ever need 254 SLIP lines,
so it is unreasonable to ask for a new subnet wasting 254 addresses
on a handful of SLIP lines.

I want to subnet our net down to say, 6 SLIP lines, say for instance
what would normally be host addr's 249 to 254.  If I set my netmask
appropriately (255.255.255.248), should I expect any complications?
(like the ones i'm getting, although i haven't tried the arp sugg yet)

Thanks for any suggestions.  Has anyone else tried subnetting at this
fine a granularity?  Does anyone else feel guilty about raping 254
addresses for a SLIP line?

Why would you have to reverse engineer anything from NetBSD.  The source

Subject: filesystem for archive disks
Date: 11 Nov 1993 19:03:13 GMT

Since I don't have a tape drive (and don't have much chance of buying
one anytime soon) and do have a stack of HD floppies, I'm using floppies
for archiving software packages I get on internet.  For example,
I FRP some GNU stuff at the computer lab, take it home, install it on
my Linux machine, and have it at the same time archived should I need
to reinstall it.  The question I have is which filesystem should I use
on those floppies: with msdos I can't have long filenames, but with
ext2 (i.e. ext2fs) I'm loosing 5% of disk space that is reserved for
root.  On the other hand, e2fs will automatically put lost chains
in lost+found directory on the floppy as at least some form of
protection.  This is (and long filenames) are the main reasons why
right now my archive floppies are in ext2 format.

Could somebody suggest which filesystem to use for the purpose of
archiving (maybe mke2fs with '-m 0' option so I use all of the disk)?

Guten Tag!

Is there any font for X which resembles the font used in text mode in MS-DOS?

The idea behind this on first glance somewhat barbarian question is the
following: I'm using Seyon, a terminal programm for Linux, which uses xterm
as terminal emulation. When I call a BBS running on a MS-DOS machine lots
of it's output gets unreadable due to different graphic characters.

Any information will be appreciated. Thank you for your help!

Fragments are not necessarily a good idea.  There are two independent
values here:

  1)  How big should the block size be when allocating space for a
      file?

      On average, you will waste about half of the last block
      allocated, unless you make the block size _way_ too big and most
      files fit in less than one block, in which case you will waste
      more than half.

      On a typical Unix system, approx 40% of the files will be 1k or
      less, and 90% of the files will be 4k or less.

      If you make the block size too small, then too much space will
      be wasted keeping track of the blocks.

      So, the allocation unit should probably be somewhere around 1k,
      maybe as small as 256, maybe as large as 4k.


  2)  How much data should you read off the disk at one time?

      If you read too little data, then you are going to spend a lot
      of time dealing with the overhead of reading blocks.  You also
      won't be able to read consecutive tracks, causing rotational
      delays to be added in.

      If you read too much data, then you may well be wasting space on
      I/O buffers that could better be used for programs or data.

      Typically, 8k-128k should be read at one time, if you detect
      that the file is being read sequentially.  If it is being read
      randomly, then read the smallest amount possible.



The old Version 7 file system used 512 byte blocks, which is great for
an allocation size, but horrible for a disk access size.

The Berkeley Fast Filesystem changed things to use a 8k block size,
which is better for a disk access size, but horrible for an allocation
size.  In order to "fix" the problem with the allocation size, they
created fragments, which are 1k.  Unfortunately, you can only use a
fragment if the entire file fits in the fragment, so the FFS wastes,
on average 4k any time the file is over 1k in size.  Fragments add
additional code and complications when something needs to be moved too
or from a fragment.  The 8k block size also isn't large enough to get
really good throughput from the disk when reading sequentially, and it
is too large when reading randomly.


So, what is the solution?

Well, allocate things using a 512-2k blocksize, and read/write _many_
blocks at one time.  This is known as clustering.  It works better
than the FFS and the code is simpler to boot.


The Berkeley FFS also suffers from several other problems on modern
disk drives.  In particular, they made the assumptions that the users
knew how many heads, tracks and cylinders the disk had, and the the
number of tracks per sector stayed constant across the disk.  With
SCSI drives, you don't know this information and the tracks per sector
isn't constant.  IDE drives usually lie about the number of heads and
cylinders in order to work under DOS.


While the Berkeley FFS was much better than the Version 7 file system,
it is far from being an ideal filesystem.

Tar floppies/tapes? That's how one communicates between any two Unix
