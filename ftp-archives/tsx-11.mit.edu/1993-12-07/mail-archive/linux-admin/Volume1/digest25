~/.rhosts is a generic UNIX thing, and will let users login / rsh 
without a password.  Host names should be fully qualified, and this 
file should be read-write owner only.

Unix system also support /etc/hosts.equiv, although I don't recommend
using /etc/hosts.equiv for security reasons.

The most important factor in determining build speed is the amount of memory
you have.  GCC2 is a pig, and will thrash in 4M of memory.  In 8M or 
more, it's quite tolerable.

Yes.  

>How do I restore the bootability of the Linux system?

Traiditional unices only support one local filesystem, and the 
bootstrap loader knows enough about the layout to read any file 
off of it.  This was the case with Linux, the minix filesystem,
and shoelace, but is no more now that Linux supports a myriad 
of local filesystems.

Supporting every filesystem in the boot code would be a nightmare,
so instead we leave the boot program a map of what blocks the kernel(s)
occupy on the raw device(s).  The LILO bootstrap finds the map, and 
reads the appropriate blocks off the raw device.

If you merely copy a kernel onto the disk, and don't update this mapping,
Bad Things(tm) happen when the wrong blocks get loaded.  Rerun 
/etc/lilo/lilo with the appropriate switches and config file, and 
things will straighten themselves out.

Subject: Rnews problem in UUCP
Date: 30 Aug 93 01:26:52 GMT

Hello Everybody;

Hope you can help.  I am trying to set up a UUCP site to receive email and news.
i have got the UUCP faq, the recommended reading, and this one still escapes me.

I have the UUCP feed mostly working, can send and receive email, but i cannot get my news to come in properly, it gets sent over , but then seems to dissappear into the bit bucket.

In the file /usr/spool/uucp/.Log/joesys I get many many messages like:


Executing X.joesysX0ctr (rnews)
ERROR: Execution: Exit Status 1
Execution failed (X.joesysX0ctr)

I have don e everything that the Cnews README said to do but, it doesnt work.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

This isn't a LINUX question, but I'll answer it :-)

You could try changing the directory "group ownerships" of the spool
directories you want to restrict.  Then put your users in appropriate
groups and set the read permissions of those spool directories
accordingly.  This might be a pain to keep up though, if you allow your
Cnews to automatically process "newgroups".

Ahhh ... I have 16mb of memory ... but was running X when I
did the kernel build, so there wasn't much memory free.  Next time
I'll quit X before rebuilding the kernel :-)

Speaking of which ..h ... there must be a memory leak, possibly in X386.
When I first start X, I have about 4mb of memory free, but it seems
to disappear even when I don't start new apps :-)

Once of the biggest farses with most UNIX bbs program is they expect

BBS setup a headache.

I am running a pay for access BBS and want to charge by the

with UNIX (Linux). With my setup, the user will have a real UNIX
login, and the .profile will controls what the user see. As for not

option to point to WHAT active file to read from. If this is not an

With a build time that high (My perceptions of what's right are 
probably skewed by my experience with ancient Linux revisions, GCC 1,
and partial builds where I only tweak one source file), I assumed it 
was a memory shortage, but with 16M you shouldn't have any problems 
compiling the Linux kernel, even under X, and the bulk of the Linux
code is device drivers, networking code, etc. that don't usually 
find there way into the systems I build.

Other programs are a different story - I ran into a case under BSD, 
m68k,  where I had to raise the hard RLIMIT, since GCC2.3.3 needed 32M to 
compile a file including an X bitmap and the default hard limit was only 
16M!  GCC 2.4.5 did nicely with a 16M limit in place, but memory
usage was still frightening, not to mention the size of the .s files
it spewed without using the -pipe option!

Try -pipe, you should see some improvement since disk access is 
reduced because cpp and assembler intermediate files are never 
committed to disk.

(BTW, why isn't this an option in the default CFLAGS?  If you aren't
thrashing, it reduces disk access)

Is this on an otherwise idle system, or with other things going on?

With how generic / pruned down of a kernel?  Most of Linux's weight
is in the diverse driver support, this should have a real impact 
on compile time.

>Speaking of which ..h ... there must be a memory leak, possibly in X386.
>When I first start X, I have about 4mb of memory free, but it seems

If you're running the networking code, there are reliable 
reports of memory leaks in the net-2 code in .99.12.  

Some X server implementations have memory leaks too, I'm not sure about 
Xfree86 specifically.  On the systems I administer, I use 

DisplayManager*terminateServer: true

in my  xdm configuration files so I get a new Xserver for each login
session, minimizing the impact of an Xserver memory leak.  You always 
have the problem where a user level free() can't return freed pages
to the heap, so this is probably a good idea even if there isn't a real
memory leak.

There's also the Linux unfied buffer cache, which basically grows 
to fill all available memory that's not in use for something else. 
People used to traditional unices often confuse this with a real 
memory leak, but you can consider "real free memory" as that marked
free and that marked buffer cache.

run ...

Could it be the case, that your rnews isn't found by uux ?
Check your local config files in /usr/local/lib/uucp
(Permissions is a good start) if your news feed is permitted
to run the rnews program ....

Why can't your newsfeed help ?! He has obviously a running system ?!
I think you aren't experienced in configuring uucp/news/mail ?!
Then your newsfeed should help you in this - general - points
of questions ....

I agree, I was able to compile the kernel in about 30minutes under X, and I
only have 8 megs of 80ns RAM.  This is kernel v0.99p6-26 (or so the SLS
says) without SCSI or NFS, but everything else.

    In the contrib/ directory in the Taylor 1.4 source there's a program
called savelog that will save the Taylor style log files. I don't know
if it could be adapted to HDB. Otherwise, a simple script run daily could
accomplish the same thing.

    I just tried using pipe on an 8 meg machine, while using nn, with
just the normal sendmail and selection daemons running. Under this
setup, using gcc 2.4.5 and compiling 99pl12, it was a tossup on whether
-pipe did any good at all. Real time was 35 minutes for -pipe and 34
without. Free showed 1.5 meg swapped out compared to 800-1meg without
-pipe. 
    As a comparison, compiling 99pl9 with gcc2.3.3 would take 20-25
minutes on the same amchine and didn't go into swap at all.
