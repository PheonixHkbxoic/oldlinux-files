Subject: UUGETTY respawning too rapidly?
Date: Fri, 5 Nov 1993 11:35:36 GMT

I am currently trying to get uugetty (getty_ps) working with 
Slackware 1.0.5.

With everything configured, at boot time I get a message about

"c7: respawning too rapidly: disabled for 5 minutes"

(note that the message is not verbatim - it is from memory).  Anyone
know what might cause this?  I know it takes some doing to get this
working...

Can anyone comment on:

  1: The respawning too rapidly message?

  2: Must echo be DISABLED on the modem (Q and E AT commands)?

  3: What about the DTR modem response (&D AT command)?

  4: Is DEBUG=777 in /etc/default/uugetty.ttyS0 all that is required for
     trace?  I have this, but get nothing in /tmp.

  5: In /usr/adm/getty.log, I get nothing but "cannot connect" messages.

I have all the READMEs, the HOWTO, and the NET-book (doc project) -
and I read them.  Read man pages for getty and gettydefs too.

Still I am missing something...

Subject: Net2? in pl13p with errors
Date: 5 Nov 1993 13:26:00 GMT

Hi,

because of problems with the existing net-2 code i changed my system
from pl13 (net-debugged) to pl13p. In the old versions of net-2
I had problems with fragmented IP-Packets. I know, the weren't 
supported.

As I got to know in pl13p (including net2debugged) this missing feature
might be implemented. Now I got the following error message:

<6>*** tcp.c:tcp_data bug acked < copied

Can somebody help me. I know that this occurs when I should receive SMTP-
Packets and try to connect to my newsserver.

Thanks for your assitance.

I am trying to install the most current version of SLS (from tsx-11).
I have a 486, and a Future Domain TMC-1680 ISA SCSI Controller,
controlling 2 Seagate drives.  When I boot with A1, (A1.5), I get the
messages:
scsi: 0 hosts.
scsi: detected 0 SCSI disks, 0 tapes, 0 CD-ROM drives total.

The drives work fine in DOS.

Can anyone suggest anything?

Subject: fsck and .99.13p..
Date: 5 Nov 1993 16:36:43 GMT

Hello,
  Just recently, I downloaded the 0.99.13p ide kernal from slackware
(the November 3rd or 4th release) and put it in as "/zImage.99.13".  Then
I added it as option "Beta" in LILO.  I also kept my .99.12 slackware as
"/zImage".  Booting with the .12 kernel, when it comes time to run
the "/bin/fsck -A -a", it runs just a second, sees the "clean" flag on the
partition and does not run the fsck.  When I boot linux with the .13p release, 
it runs what appears to be a complete fsck each boot.  I am still doing the
same shutdown procedure as before....  
  My orginal Slackware release was installed on August 17, and is probably
the version just a couple days previous.

 - Did I miss discussion about a new kernel/other fix killing the e2fs 
   clean flag?  
 - Is this a new with the .99.13p kernel?  
 - Is this a classic case of user error?

  Thanks!

  Dan

Huh? What mv are you talking about? The LinuX mv always did that and the
mv of HP-UX did so, too. Why should it not do so? Directories are files,
too, in principle.

Greetings,

Subject: 'protecting' areas of physical memory?
Date: Fri, 5 Nov 1993 18:28:35 GMT

Is there a way to build a linux kernel that avoids specific
physical address ranges?  For example, in my old ESIX 5.3.2d,
there is a file available at boot-time describing the available
memory layout.

I'd like to experiment to see if I can get linux to run with
my cache enabled by simply having it never use the parts of
memory that seem to crash linux when running with cache. (Yes,
it does appear that I have to avoid using cache on specific
areas of my memory {and not just for linux}, and without cache,
I get a lot of NMI errors with my old motherboard/memory
combination. sigh.)

Subject: Debugger wants libc source?!
Date: 5 Nov 1993 19:25:17 GMT


Guten Tag!

Unfortunately, while debugging various pieces of code, I really that my
debuggers -- gdb and ups -- demand the sources of libc when libc calls,
like printf or whatever, are reached.

I can pass it by using "next" instead of "step"ping into the call. However,
it's not very comfortable. Moreover, I always get a disturbing little "beep"
for each call with a missing source.

My libs are from image-4.4.1.tar.gz (or so) from the GCC directory on sunsite.

So: what I am doing wrong? 

Thank you in advance! Any information will be appreciated!

You have an entry in your inittab (or whatever Linux uses) to restart
UUGETTY whenever it dies.  However, it's exiting/crashing/whatever right
after it starts up.  To keep your system from becoming unusable, init
won't try to execute the command again for 5 minutes.

You can usually find out what the problem is by executing the command
directly, and looking at the output.  Around here, we get that message
a lot because ttymon dies whenever the access permissions or major/minor
number on a /dev/ entry are wrong.  (In fact, this very morning... urgh.)

>  5: In /usr/adm/getty.log, I get nothing but "cannot connect" messages.

Try running it manually; hopefully it'll tell you why.

I don't know, was ext2fs 0.4 rolled into 0.99.13p?  If so, this could
cause behavior similar to this, because 0.4 marks links a little
differently, so if an earlier version was run, it will fsck the
volume.

Does it do this if you boot .99.13p twice in a row?  And do you have
the READONLY flag set in the BETA lilo definition?  If it does and you
do, then I think you have found a proble, otherwise, it's the changes
to the ext2fs.

I was a little startled myself at this feature.  There are other UNIXes
that will not allow a user to mv a directory.  SCO UNIX and XENIX for
example only allow users to rename - not move - directories.  SCO provides
a mvdir command (which can only be executed by root!), on the off chance 
someone *might* need to move a directory.

Ah, well... Such were the UNIXes of the bygone era!  :^)


Snide comment added to force postnews to let me post:

It seems like it was just yesterday: I way trying to decide between 
spending $1500 for a "full" copy of UNIX or accepting the archaic 
limitations of DOS/MS Windows...  Today I have a full UNIX system in
my home and have enough cash left over to buy a real hard drive. The best
part is I never have to hear the words "Oh, that's only available as 
part of the XXX module"!

I'm trying as trying to get the NYS "yp" interface hacked into my linux box.

I've gotten the code, and ypcat, etc. seem to work fine.  However, I'm sure 
that somehow the login program must have to know about using the yp 
maps instead of the contents of the passwd and shadow files. 

Mail to the NYS developers has gone unanswered.  No one knows for certain how 
to tap into the NYS developers' channel (at least, no one who I've contacted)
and unless I can find some kind of documentation about how to use this stuff, 
it's not going to be of much use.  There's essentially no documentation 
included with the distribution.  I have version 11. 

I'd be much obliged for any pointers anyone out there could give me? 

Thanks.
