I've got a problem using XDM with sessreg in my XStartup and XReset scripts:
whenever it executes the line 'sessreg -a $USER' or 'sessreg -d $USER' or the
BSD variations of them (although I think the sessreg binary I have is SYSV
compiled), I get an lseek error, and the session does not start.

I suspect that maybe my /etc/utmp and /etc/wtmp are broken and/or incompatible.

I got the xdm and sessreg binaries from the xf86-2.0 binary distribution.

Date: Tue, 7 Dec 1993 01:11:56 GMT

Well, I've read the FAQ, I've asked Ian Taylor via email, and now I'm
asking for help publicly.  Here's the problems.  First, uugetty does not
appear to be working right (although it may be init that's the problem)
in that, instead of spawning once, I've had as many as 9 copies of uugetty
spawned one second apart and still running as far as ps can tell.  Needless
to say, each tries to grab the serial port and the result is mayhem.

The second problem is that, when either uucico or cu tries to dial up another
system, I get all the way through the chat script, the connected message
comes up, and then, when the first characters come from the other side,
my machine drops the DTR line and hangs up.  This happens on both a 486DX-33
with 16450's and a 386DX-40 with both 16450's and 16550's.

I am running high-speed modems, and have pegged the serial port speed at
38400, with the modem locked at 38400 as well.

Any clues?  Suggestions?  This thing won't work as a uucp box as is, which
is what I need right now.

Charles.

That would work fine, but NFS client drivers for MS-DOS cost $100's for
each machine, so if he has more than one or two PC's, he could just set
up a dedicated DOS LAN server for less money. :-)

You have to reduce the blocksize for read and write operations on the
RS/6000. I quote from my /etc/filesystems on the AIX-machine:

/pc6usr:
        dev             = /usr
        vfs             = nfs
        nodename        = achpc6
        mount           = false
        type            = linuxnfs
        options         = bg,soft,intr,rsize=1024,wsize=1024
        account         = true

With these options I don't have a problem accessing the linux fs's.
My problem is the other way round. If I write a file from the linux-
box to an NFS-drive on the RS6k performance is very very bad (I estimate
it at perhaps 40times slower than using ftp between the two machines).
Any comments, ideas?

Subject: Problem w/display after shutting down X server (ATI card)
Date: Fri, 03 Dec 1993 17:26:16 -0500

I'm running the XF86_SVGA server over linux 0.99pl13r using an older
ATI card with 512K of RAM.  It has the 28000-2 chip, which isn't
supported by the server.  X works fine at the 800x600 resolution, but
when I shut down the X server, all characters on the console are
replaced with vertical lines.  The card must not be going back to the
proper video mode.

I've just been going 'su' and rebooting the system.  Is there a more
graceful way of dealing with this problem?  Getting a new video card
is an option, but I'd rather get the current one to work.

Thanks.

Subject: ttyS1 time-out problem?
Date: Fri, 03 Dec 1993 22:27:55 -0500

I recently installed Slackware 1.1.0 on my 386-33 with 12mb ram. Linux is
installed in a 89mb partition.

My problem is this:

        I have a properly configured null-modem connecting the linux box with 
another 386 running telix under dos. The null modem is configured as follows:

2 & 3 crossed (send/recieve data)
4 & 5 crossed (cts/rts)
6 crossed to 8 and 20, 20 and 8 crossed to 6 (dsr/dtr)
7 straight through (sig. ground)

I also have a null modem with just 2,3, and 7 wired.. (no cts/rts/dtr/dsr).

No matter which cable I use, i get the same results. Upon bootup, when the
main
machine has printed the login: prompt, the remote terminal only has about
10-15
characters of the issue file printed.. 

Sometimes, the remote terminal will actually make it to the login: prompt ,
but
its usually can't manage to print the whole thing, usually printing:

Welcome to li

..or..

Welcome

..or..

Welcome to linux 0.99.13.

lo

etc.. It never makes it COMPLETLY to login: and never accepts any input.

running top reveals that there is indeed a getty running for that tty
(ttyS1).

when I reboot the machine using ctrl-alt-del, the next character that would
have been printed had it worked correctly on the remote terminal is >THEN<
printed.. Very odd..

I have used MANY different settings in inittab/gettydefs, and am to the point
which i think it to be a hardware problem.. Has anyone else had this happen
to
them? I would like to hear from you, either by reply to this thread, or via
email.. 

Thanks in advance..

Read

How about using setserial in the /etc/rc scripts ? Since all kernels
after pl10 ( I think) had the auto_configure of the Serial Ports
disabled and you needed setserial (This I was told by the README) and with
2.01 of the setserial package it works fine.. so it should
do it with your machine too...

If you can read german books, there is a German book "Linuxhandbuch" available.
You can get it as .dvi-file on some german ftp-servers as well as a printed
book. For more info send a mail to linux@lunetix.de

I'm attempting to install the new LGX CD on an AMI BIOS 486 that
has an Adaptec 1520/1522 SCSI with a Chinon 535 CD-ROM. It gets
as far as the boot diskette with line:

aha 152x Vital Data: PORTBASE=0340; IRQ=11 SCSI ID = 7 Reconnect=Enabled
Adaptech 152x SCSI Driver; $Revision 9.4$

(at this point, the floppy spins and the screen saver kicks in after 
 a while)

Is this an unsupported setup? It even runs Windows-NT without problems.
IRQ 11 is free and clear - and without conflicts.
Thanks,

We do just this...It works fine...The only problem is that there isn't a

Yeah, I have noticed the same thing with the syslogd that came with SLS.  I 
wanted to redirect the messages from my linux machine to another machine on
campus that I am usually logged on.  I have done this already to several other
BSDI machines, and it works fine.  But it doesn't seem to work at all with 
the Linux machine.  The man page *does* say that you can redirect the messages
to a server machine located elsewhere on the network... 

Where can we get a syslogd that will work on Linux that does its job?  (I guess
I can try to find a BSD version and compile it... but I just don't relish the
thought of porting it over myself...)

As someone has recently explained on *x.i386 group the problem can be 
solved with the svgalib0** package (it comes with slackware). Once installed
it allows to save screen font data in a file /tmp/fontdata befor xinit is
run via restorefont routine, and upon exiting X restore it back. It is all
done automatically if you start X with a script "runx". It worked for me.

You can go into your linux kernel sources ../linux/drivers/char/serial.c, and
edit the serial.c file to reflect the proper IRQ, and then recompile your
kernel.  That way the proper IRQ will be hardcoded in there.  Don't forget to
make this change with each kernel update you get, though.

Does it work if you ctrl-alt-fkey to switch vc's? If not, you are still _HOSED_!

Plus I think there are non-broken versions of the X server around, are they not?
