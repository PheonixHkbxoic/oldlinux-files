Don't worry about it.  I have yet to see someone explain what
col.admin is for.

Should one post an admin question (which well over half of the
questions are) to .help or .admin ?  Should one post about Linux
development in .admin or .development ?

I said this during the RFD but they ignored me ...

Crossposed to and followups to col.misc.

YES !!! I mentioned this before. What we need first, that we can talk
about cleaning up SLS, is a proper version-numbering ! *every* little
update of the SLS released to pulic should get an own subrelease-number
so that we can distinguish between the many versions floating around.

I have to agree.

I've been stung by the "BTW, we moved some things from a1 to b3,
and from b4 to c6, and....." and it took hours to figure it out.
I've still got some patch files that I have no idea where they
go, and what to do with them.....

    As someone's sig file says. Unix allows you to do stupid things in
order to allow you to do clever things. If you try this as an ordinary
user, passwd is a lot stricter on what it will allow.  I guess root is
assumed to have a darn good reason to want to use a stupid password. If
the ordinary user restrictions were enforced on root, you couldn't even
create an account with the password guest. 
    Personally, I like the behaviour the way it is. I had to use the
root account to give my ordinary user account an empty password, but at
least I could do it. If, I couldn't, I would have nuked shadow passwords
completely.

Ok, have a look to the postings about the Demian project
for nn:
750174007:comp.os.linux.development:+s/:Standards
750174036:comp.os.linux.development:+s=:Linux Standards (was Re\: Debian\: a brief status report)

My goal
        one union base distrib with kernel + developement system
        one exactly matching source disk to the base distrib !

        everything else should be distributed in SVR4 pkgadd/pkgrm/...
        format. Reason: binary compatibility to SVR4 is coming (soon?).
        SVR4 is a consolidated platform for the 90's on PC's.

Support the diskussion, maybe this way, too.
The pkgadd... utilities a la SVR4 provide all needed features for
clean package removing, pkg creating+listing, permission fixes ....

You're a slyboot, too.
The other point was, that originally somebody was asking for help
for a specific product. The reply to help him, if he would use
another package than SLS wasn't asked and didn't help much.

If somebody wants to help, then he should *do* so and 
not start to prattle. If he can't help, because being religious 
fanatic against some other product, then he should keep it for himself.
It wasn't asked by the one who wanted help !

Oops, sorry for the scare...

I've had it pointed out to me that assigning a null password with
passwd as root is a feature not a bug...

I've been a sysadmin for a couple of years now (mainly SCO Unix, gag)
and I've never noticed this feature before because when I've run
passwd, I usually do it on purpose to change a passwd.  However, the
other day when I posted this, I was just messing around with passwd and
happened to hit enter a couple of times for "new passwd:" and "retype
passwd:"... 

You learn something new every day :)

If you have your adapter set for IRQ2, you should specify

If the problem is just caused by an incorrect IRQ setting, I think a simple
mt rewind should still succeed. Check your settings in linux/include/linux/
tpqic02.h.

I also have a 5150EQ, so it should work ... ;)

Oh, if you're trying to recompile from SLS 1.03, try to get a clean
kernel source from nic.funet.fi first, I've seen several reports from
people having problems with recompiling the tape driver in that. Perhaps Peter made
some mistakes when making some changes to my driver?

Assuming you are talking about my SysVinit 2.4 package, you can't.
The GNU who does not have support for this, and neither does init.
I assume that the runlevel has to be kept somewhere in /etc/utmp ?

SysVinit 2.4 can and does do this. When going to single user mode (s)
it does a 'kill -9 -1' so that all processes are killed, and it then
spawns just a single shell.

I have begun with this in my SysV init package. If you are using SLS,
you cannot see this is SLS still uses the old style of dealing with
/etc/rc. You don't need a test for the runlevel with who -r or something:
just pass the number from /etc/inittab like:

r2:2:wait:/etc/rc1.d/rc.daemons 2

I'm still trying to get more info on the subject. I have access to a
SysV R3.2 machine, and will try to find out what the "official" way
of dealing with this is.
