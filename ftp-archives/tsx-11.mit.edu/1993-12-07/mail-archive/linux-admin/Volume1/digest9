hi -- thought i'd share this little script -- it's saved my butt once now,
i hope it will again someday.  i have a two drive system -- a 120 and a 40
(i know they're small, but hey, they're mine.).  i do backups of the
interesting stuff on the 120 (no, it's not full) onto the 40.  depending
on how heavily i use the system, i can easily fit a full and a weeks worth
of incrementals on the 40meg disk.

'nuff said -- script follows.

Subject: [Q] /etc/shutdown by non-root
Date: Thu, 19 Aug 1993 15:12:25 GMT

I have a standalone Unix workstation (Linux, as it happens) at home.
This is used by me, and by my generally computer-illiterate flatmate.
While I can cope with becoming root and invoking /etc/shutdown to
bring the system down properly, I don't want to give my flatmate the
root password! (Nor the hassle of a complicated procedure, which he'll
screw up...)

Is there anyway of setting things up so that a non-root user can bring
the system down cleanly? Run /etc/shutdown setuid? Have a setuid
"wrapper" program that calls /etc/shutdown only with the halt option?
Other solutions?  What are the issues and dangers?

Responses by e-mail preferred, though I'll try and follow any
discussion that takes place here. If there is sufficient interest I'll
summarise and post.

Hello,

well :-) that's logical. Since pl10, the whole netpackage has been replaced by
Net-2. You will have to get the net-2 packages from an ftp server and install
it .. that should solve your problem. Btw: Get the NET-2 FAQ first .. it
(nearly) perfectly explains, how to get a proper setup. Easy to understand and
step-by-step.

Do the users on the linux machine and the Sparc have the same login?
Is the hostname of the linux machine in the .rhosts file on the Sparc?
Did you set the DISPLAY variable on the linux machine?

xon <machine> /usr/X11/xterm

I am making a `ash for linux' release which works with INN 1.4. I'm
currently busy with some UUCP problems so I haven't had the time to make a
release yet. It looks *very* promising but I think there are still some
bugs.

One is a *VERY* strange one: the following code is from rc.inet2:

=============================================================================
#!/bin/sh
# rc.inet2

PATH=/usr/etc:/etc:$PATH; export PATH
echo -n "/etc/rc.d/rc.inet2: "

HOSTS=/etc/hosts
CONFIG=/etc/config
INETD=/usr/etc/inetd
NAMED=/usr/etc/named
PORTMAP=/usr/etc/rpc.portmap
NFSD=/usr/etc/rpc.nfsd
MOUNTD=/usr/etc/rpc.mountd

#if [ -x $PORTMAP ]; then
#       echo -n ", `basename $PORTMAP`"
#       `basename $PORTMAP`
#fi

if [ -x $INETD ]; then
        echo -n "`basename $INETD`"
        `basename inetd`
fi
=============================================================================

My /usr/etc/inetd was first owned by bin.bin and had r-x------ as
permissions.  The result was that it wasn't executed by ash (inetd:
permission denied). But after I changed the owner to root.root it worked!
Can anyone explain this?  Under bash 1.13cwru beta it works OK with owner
bin.bin.

The second one is a possible problem with trn's Pnews script which thinks
all groups are moderated when using ash as /bin/sh.

I hope to have an ash release ready tomorrow, unless UUCP keeps giving
troubles.

[and similar buck-passing from mbeattie in another message]

Sorry guys, my two HP machines are perfectly capable of NFS-mounting each
other with root as a member of a dozen groups.  I know HP is frequently
behind the times on networking, so I checked very carefully before blaming
the Linux code.  Whatever the problem is, it's not that HP software can't
cope with multiple groups.

If there are indeed two flavors of RPC out there, methinks it would
behoove Linux to be compatible with both of them.  Or at least document
how to work around the problem.

I assumed that the user has a good password so that brute force
checking of all printable-character-combinations is necessary, not
just from the dictionary. For that you (still) need a supercomputer,
if that even helps.

Crack only checks words (and variations on these) from the dictionary.
If you have good passwords you STILL NEED A CRAY :: YOU _DON'T_ NEED
SHADOW PASSWORDS. And many of todays /bin/passwd programs enforce the
use of a 'good' password.

In the future however normal computers might be fast enough to do a
brute force check of passwords, but at that time I guess we use some
completely different authentification mechanism, like Kerberos.

You have to set the active partition to where you are booting SCO from,
because the SCO-boot-program looks for the active partition to read further
blocks (see man boot on SCO).
Then I configured SCO just like the DOS example which came with lilo.

when i said ''messes up the tty'', i didn't mean that i get all of the

this only happens when dosemu crashes and burns.  the exitemu exits
fine.  but when i have to kill -9 it, the session is logged off, and
i get this problem.

It works (LILO as the MBR). I installed Linux (SLS 1.01, if I remember
right) on a friend's PC which already had SCO loaded. I set up LILO
like usual and it still boots SCO happily. Don't remember the details,
but it was pretty straightforward. If you have a hard time I can get
