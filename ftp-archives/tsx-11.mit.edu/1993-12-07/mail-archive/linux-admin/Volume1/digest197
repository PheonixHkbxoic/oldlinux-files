Use /dev/ttyS<n> for incoming (getty).  Use /dev/cua<n> for outgoing
(kermit, lpd).

As far as I know this only defines which terminals you are
allowed to _log in_ as (not su to) root from.

(Thankfully - the ol' dumb term's been a bit of a bonus
ot times (-: )

You could make a (or use an existing) group ``trusted_users'' 
(whatever you want to call it) and make su mode 4750 and group 
``trusted_users''.

With mgetty+sendfax, you can do scheduling via cron.

Well, as for serial program authors, there are some features that you
cannot use if you use the new serial driver behaviour, especially have the
modem answered manually (RING->ATA) or logging of the CONNECT strings -
which can be quite important in some environments.

(Especially mgetty+sendfax can*not* use the ttyS/cua scheme because of
said restrictions)

Check out the post in comp.windows.x.i386unix.  I'll post it here as well.
Basically it warns that the Xconfig file (Xconfig.1M) included in slackware
1.1.0 is NOT sanctioned by XFree86 core team and they have recommended 
that the maintainer of slackware drop it from the distribution.  The reason
is the same reason given by Andreas Klemm, above.

If you are talking about Gert Doering's mgetty+sendfax package, you're
definitely wrong. This mgetty is _designed_ to work on ttySx solely. 
I have mgetty installed on ttyS1 and play UUCP, dial-up BBS, kermit, and
all that on ttyS1.

While you are basically right (from my own experience with my BBS), I wouldn't

Subject: up 33 days! But...
Date: Wed, 1 Dec 1993 19:44:19 GMT

This awesome Linux box has been up for 33 days on a network, processing mail and
nearly a full feed of news.  That, in itself, is worthy of applause!

Especially a 386-40 with 4 Meg of RAM and a few hundred meg of IDE drives
running PL11.  Like, I don't dare touch anything because it is working so
well, even though I could upgrade practically everything on it!

But...  with so little RAM it swaps a LOT, so it takes a little time to
do a C News expire, for instance.  In taking a peek at the system today,
however, I saw it using almost 5 Meg of swap, which is more than I usually
see.  The "top" program showed that crond, of all processes, had a resident
size of around 6400 and was at 187% of memory usage.  Pretty funky numbers,
I agree, and I didn't get any memory back when I killed the crond process,
so I did reboot the box.

Now, I know that PL11 is ancient, as are 4.4.1 libs and all that, but I did
want to report that 1) the box had been up running Linux and working HARD
for quite some time, and 2) I observed a possible memory leak.  I am not
asking for help here -- just trying to submit a small observation to be
added to that smallest of databases:  the set of Linux machines that have
large uptimes.  (After all, my home machine gets a software upgrade and
a reboot weekly, if not daily, which is GREAT -- don't get me wrong.)

Later,

Hello all,

        I am having problems with the new Linux Kernel PatchLevel 13.  I had SLS
1.03 installed on my machine and running on the network at work. 
However, when I upgraded to the new Linux Kernel, I get 'network
unreachable' messages.  I looked at the configuration and everythings to
be OK.  I have an SMC Elite Plus card which gets recognized during the
bootup at the right IO(0x280) and IRQ(5) values.  Even the loopback gives
me network unreachable.

        What is going on wrong?  Should I go back to the kernel version that I
was using?  Can anyone give me any hints as to what to do?

Thanks in advance,

There are good examples in the directory smail-3.1.28/samples.
Smail can be configured at compile-time, or by external files.
Try to start by putting something like:

        smart_transport=smtp

In your smail config file. I think you will not find in this linux newsgroup,
