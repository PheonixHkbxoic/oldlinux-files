Hello, I am student enrolled in a course called System Engineering.  The course's objective was to set up an electronic network to allow companies to share information.  We have many companies that are interested in participating but we have had some trouble finding the proper communication software to run our network.

The following are the requirements for our network:

- full graphic interface between PC and VAX mainframe with normal phone line

- VAX architecture might be too old and we do have the capacity to upgrade to
  an new system architecture which will be able to handle our demands.



- PC remote station must be able to execute mainframe programs example :

                 - ANSYS
                 - UNIGRAPHICS
                 - MATLAB
                 - XMATH
                 - ALGOR
                 - etc
                 
- menu driven software

- cost minimal; remote station must be able to use this network with minimal cost for
  upgrade

- screen sharing capabilities (real time and transmission rate > 2400 baud) 

- file transfer must have choice of common communication protocols


So far we know of :  PC-X
                     VISIT from Northern Telecom ( cannot be accessed from a                            remote station not having VISIT software)

                     
Any recommandations to what kind of commercial or public domain software we should use will be appreciated.

Yesterday, I recieved a reply to address the comp.os.linux.* groups for help and it also mentioned that the software requirements I need may be meet by a software package called XFREE ?  Will it, if so where can I get some information on it ?


Thank you,

Marco

This costs money, but PCNFS should work with a just about any UNIX type
system, and I thinkt here is a specialized daemon for linux, but I could
be wrong and have been before.

I have NCSA telnet and ftp setup on a dos machine connected to my home
network, works great, but there is no NFS in NCSA stuff :(

If you know how to talk to your users, then you can find the problem,
if the user can't tell you what is going on, then the user isn't trying
hard enough himself to solve the problem and it is not the administrators
fault at all.  If the user can't tell you exactly, then you need to find
where the problem lies, like is he/she using the right terminal emulation?
or what application is the user in.

the slash problem can be fixed very easy (your example) by saying before
you tell them what to type that when you say the word 'slash' it means
the slash under the '?' key, not the backslash and when you want them
to type a '\', you will say it as 'backslash'.

I am doing this right now as we speak.  I am using Linux as a standard
NFS server and I have in my DOS machine NFS client software from
FTP Software.  (PC/TCP kernel + Interdrive).

Also you can get Beamse&Whitside NFS software.  (You should be able to get
demo versions from them  till the end of december)

There is one more option.  There is a PD Pathworks server for Unix.  Compiles
just fine under Linux.  It supposedly implement NetBIOS over TCP/IP.
If you have a LAN Manager client you might be able to access files on the
Linux machine using NetBIOSs over TCP/IP

     Certainly the library is not all that large, but the library size has
little to do with the actual amount of memory used at run time.  

     I do not have the exact numbers available, but I recall that the Motif
list widget (in 1.1.x) used an exorbitant amount of memory.  I did a project
that used very long scrolled lists (30 k lines).  These lists would take up
6 to 8 meg of memory in the list widget itself.  (I haven't tried this with
1.2.x
so maybe its fixed now.)

     So, the impression of Motif being bloated is not completely off base as 
far as I am concerned.  It wouldn't take alot of long list widgets that the 
gui builder creates to add up to 35 meg.  The program that I worked on which
included these long lists routinely ran at 20 megs.

     Just my 2 cents worth.

It's not in the "Linux spirit" to ask for money. (Although Bas could have
used the money a month ago, when his disks burned (Literaly!))
The author is Bas Laarhoven, of Holland.

The main problem with the ftape code at the moment is the Error Correcting
Code (ecc) implementation. That's why you can write a backup and when you
retrieve it, find out that it's bogus :-(  Bas and I are working on it
(well, Bas mostly as I have a deadline for my master's thesis soon)

  The printer daemon requires an entry in the services file for the

  This was more than a year ago that I fixed this. After that its

  I'll agree that if what you have works, then stay with it.  I pieced stuff
together in my setup, and when it came time to add the email stuff, I didn't
know which to use, and had no currently running stuff.  I chose sendmail (the
one with IDA-1.5) and it seems to work.  I think I saw earlier in the thread
that someone had mentioned the sendmail book recently put out by O'Reilly &
Associates, it's a good book (at least so far, I am not done with it yet).

From /usr/lib/zoneinfo/time.doc:

1) set /usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime and /usr/lib/zoneinfo/posixrules.
You should copy the file for your time zone.  E.g. if you are in the
U.S.  Eastern time zone, do

   cd /usr/lib/zoneinfo
   cp US/Eastern localtime
   ln localtime posixrules

Localtime defines the local time zone.  Posixrules defines the zone to
be used to interpret the TZ environment variable.  Since it's far more
convenient simply to use the right time zone file, nothing more will
be said here about how the TZ variable is used.

I was wondering if there is any standard in Linux for making application
distributions.  So far the only de-facto standard I have seen seems to 
be the one used by Slackware/SLS disks.  Allthough useful I think it is
missing
a couple of key features.  Namely being able to handle upgrades of existing
software.  (So users configuration files and not overwritten) Also version
control.  I could be installing an older (obsolete?) version of a program
and don't know any better.
 
What do you guys think?
