Subject: swap "weirdness," kernel page directories, and other puzzles.
Date: Mon, 23 Aug 1993 19:58:04 GMT

My system has gone unusable with a very wierd set of symptoms.  I've
studed the FAQ, the Welsh et al. Linux Guide, and Frish's book on Unix
system management.  I've tried everything I can think of short of
reformatting and reinstalling from scratch.  But my system is still
broken.

SET-UP:

I'm running linux 0.99.11 by way of the full SLS-1.03 distribution
on a generic 486 box with two non-scsi 220Mb hard disks.  The disks
are partitioned like so:

 /dev/hda1  cyl 2 + 120Mb     linux ext2 for root  (it seems cyl 1 is reserved)
 /dev/hda2  cyl 497 + 32Mb    swap
 /dev/hda3  cyl 630-967       DOS

 /dev/hdb1  whole disk        linux ext2 for /home

I have LILO installed in the master boot record, /dev/hda, where it is
set up to give a boot prompt by from which I can start either dos or
linux.

Just after the SLS install procedure, I found that the line "swapon -a"
in /etc/rc was not causing swapping to be actived even with a
seemingly correct swap entry in fstab, so I changed the command in
/etc/rc to "swapon /dev/hda2" which worked.  Also, from the very first
I've always got warnings at boot time about "mounting unchecked
filesystem" apparently because the SLS etc/rc has the line to run
e2fsck commented out (for good reasons?).  For powerdowns, which I do
when we're not using the system, it has been my practice to log out,
type "sync" to the login prompt, and shut off the power.  With this
set up, I've had about three weeks of relatively trouble free
operation.

PROBLEM:

The trouble started when I was logged in as a regular user with my
home directory under /home, running Xfree86, doing a large file
transfer via kermit in an xterm window and playing xmahjong while
waiting for the transfer.  After the transfer, the ls and df commands
stopped working (produced no output).  Exiting X-windows and poking
around ended in a system crash.  The rest of the chronology is too
complicated, so I'll give the main symptoms:

If I try to boot to multi user mode from the hard disk, I sometimes
get messages like:

   swap_free wierdness
   Trying to free kernil page-directory: not good

This is followed by a number what I suppose are program crash register
dumps of the form:

   general protection: 0000
   EIP: 0010:001211B0
   EFLAGS: 00010206
     [various hex numbers for eax: ... gs:]
   Pid: 1, process nr: 1       <-- [numbers here vary, this is last one]
   39 78 18 74 a7 8b 40 10 85 c0

and then it's dead; or sometimes there are no crash register dumps but:

   () Bad page table: [006fca8]=80000000
   Bad page table: [006fca8]=80000000
   , , , Aug 21 23:32:36 named[38]: restarted
   Aug 21 23:32:36 init[1]: Entering runlevel 6

and then it offers a login prompt.  However, things are usually screwy
(see below) if I do log in.

I can usually reboot to single user mode from the hard disk, although
on one occasion, this failed with "Loading Linux, Uncompressing linux,
crc error."  In single user mode, things are usually OK at first, but
then it goes into what I shall call the "output inhibited state."  In
this state, some commands, such as ls and df produce no output to the
screen, while others, such as cat, man and vi work normally.  It's not
that ls can't see files though.  If I do "ls > foo" and "cat foo" I
get a file listing.  "echo *" works too.

Error messages occur from time to time.  In order from most frequent
to least:
    swap_free wierdness
    Trying to free nonexistent swap-page
    Trying to duplicate nonexistent swap-page
    [crash with register dumps as descibed above.]

One of these messages is almost always followed by entry into the
output inhibited state, if it is not already in that state.
These errors occur even if swapping is off (as it seems to be
in single user mode).

Entry into output inhibited state can also occur without error
messages.  This often follows attempts do use df, mount, umount,
mkswap, swapon, or e2fsck (see below).

Naturally, I thought of corrupted swap space and/or file partitions,
so I've made many attempts to run "mkswap /dev/hda2 32984" (sometimes
with the -c option) and e2fsck on both /dev/hda1 (root partition) and
/dev/hdb1 (/home).  Mkswap or e2fsck sometimes crash (mkswap crashes
more often with the -c option).  If they do not crash, they generally
leave the system in the output inhibited state, so I cannot really be
sure they have "worked."  Sometimes e2fsck reports problems with the
disks and then crashes, sometimes it reports problems and does not
crash, and sometimes it issues no (visible) problem reports and does
not crash.  Neither e2fsck nor mkswap has helped solve my problem, as
far as I can tell.

I can also boot from the SLS a1 disk.  I can run e2fsck or mkswap from
there, but the results seem no better that those described above.  I
can also mount /dev/hda1 on the /root mount point provided on a1.
Entry into the output inhibited state occurs here too, but always
after some sort of interaction with the hard disk ext2 or swap
partitions.  On one occasion, "ls -l /root" listed "usr" as a
directory with size a 2147484672 bytes!  But after doing a "mkswap"
this returned to a sane value.

Linux has eaten my weekend, and I'm still stumped.  Have I lost everthing
on my disks?  Must I do a do a complete reformat and reinstall of SLS?
Must I kiss all data in /home goodbye?  Oh wizards, please help me!

Assuming that you don't have a broken rshd or rlogind installed on
your system that wasn't compiled to use shadow passwords and assumes
that no password in /etc/passwd means no password...

The problem is that if you get the encrypted password, you can then
use the fast machine to guess what the plaintext password is.  Then,
once you know that, you can log into that system with just one
attempt.

I just installed .99P12, and so far so good.  But I need to use
my SCSI tape (Archive 2150S on an Adaptec 1542b).  The MAKEDEV
doesn't (yet) support SCSI tape.

non-rewind devices, etc.

   This program worked fine. I booted Linux and ran fdisk to add the new

Ummmm...I think you made a mistake here...system id #5 refers to an "Extended"
partition, as in the DOS idea of an extended partition (i.e. you can have 4
primary partitions or 3 primary and one extended partitions under DOS. THe extended
partition can contain several "logical" partitions (or as DOS likes to think of them
as logical drives...)). I think what you *really* want to do is change it to 
system id #83 (Linux extfs).

(Please send replies to wayne@cs.odu.edu)

Ok, this is really getting weird!  I have four Linux machines now:
kimpeck, locutus, lore and hugh.  Of these machines kimpeck is the server,
is supplies /usr to the other three machines.  I mount /usr ro,suid.  Now,
this is where it gets bizzare.  I try rsh from kimpeck to anywhere, it
works fine...  I try rsh from locutus and I get permission denied.  Now I 
alt F2 and login as root, execute rsh with no parameters, I get the usage 
blurb from rsh...  Alt F1 back to the login as me, and rsh works fine...
Now, to make things even more intresting, I have to do this for each suid
file, and then after a few minutes, it goes back to not being suid....
and when /usr loses its suid, the machine is no longer trusted.....

kimpeck:~$ uname -a
Linux kimpeck.vb.comptek.com 0.99.pl9-1 04/27/93 i486

does anyone have any suggestions?  I have heard that there is a newer mount,
but I would think that this problem is more than just mount.

Ummm..check out the /etc/hosts.lpd file of the remote machine.  Your machine
hostname MUST appear here in order to allow it to submit jobs remotely.
It also wouldn't hurt if your hostname also appears in the /etc/hosts file.

        Wouldn't having the kernel use vhnagup on the tty instead of kill -9 
be a better option? As for current support, I only think Secure Attention Key 
exits for the serial lines, but it is easy enough to hack into the keyboard, 
etc drivers (I have, but I'm still stuck at 0.99pl9, gotta look at new kbd 
code....)

        Vhangup on the tty would prevent killing of processes, when all 
that is needed is revoking tty access. The kill -9 solution could knock off
processes innocently still attached to the tty, instead of detaching them.

Not for me to say.  The specs for the Secure Attention Key came from the
Orange Book, I believe --- what I am certain of is that the specs say "kill",
not "vhangup".  In any case, the vhangup() otpion already exists, as the
default.  The SAK is just an extra bit of security for those who insist on it.

I have also found this problem using an ATI VGA Wonder V4 with busmouse.
Before I upgraded to SLS 1.03, I had this working (SLS 1.01) in mono chrome
(640x480 and 800x600) and color (640x480). After installing SLS 1.03 the
mono chrome is not working and the mouse will not budge from the lower
right corner. I've defined the mouse as "Busmouse   /dev/mouse". I've
also tried othe configurations such as "Logitech   /dev/mouse" which
plants the cursor in the upper left corner. Moving the mouse will get
the cursor to move about a third of the way to the right or bottom, but
the cursor jumps back to upper left immediatly. Kind of irritating.

I have it working now.  I had to obtain the pl12 kernal and comppiled it
with logitech bus mouse support. Apparently the SLS kernal's support   
is broken. (I think it must be in there, since it detects the mouse?).
Anyone who has a GU+ and wants to see my Xconfig, drop me some e-mail and
I'll send it out.
