Go to /usr/lib/zoneinfo, here you find all the files you need.
The file time.doc explains all the things you need. In short form:
Switch your hardware clock to GMT time (the Greenwich time), then
you have to find the correct timezone you are in (is it US/central?
I have no idea where Idaho is :-) )... Then you copy this file to
localtime and posixrules:

rm -f localtime posixrules
cp US/central localtime
cp US/central posixrules

Finally you will need a line

/etc/clock -u -s

in your /etc/rc.local file. This should set your time correctly when
you boot your system for the next time.

Cheers,
Kai

Hi,

Could someone explain some pros and cons on using Sendmail vs
smail or others? I'm using smail with Linux, it works ok so far. But
have heard other saying sendmail is good *and* easy (yet I've read some
posts comp.mail.sendmail about problems...) 

Should I switch to it? Or follow the universal golden rule:

        "If it ain't break, dont' fix it."

Thanks.

Subject: Date shows wrong timezone (zoneinfo set right!)
Date: 3 Dec 1993 18:22:39 -0500

Everything worked fine with pl10.  When I upgraded to pl13 the date command
would report that it was linked wrong or something and that it needed to be
recompiled.  This would happen whenever I ran it, however it would still
display the correct date/time/timezone info.

Now when I run date (under pl14) I get no errors at all, and it reports
the wrong timezone.  I think that I need a new date.  Should I just grab
the one out of a newer distribution, should I get the source someplace
and recompile it, or do I have another problem?

Thanks so much!!!
John

Okay,I know this has been asked before,but I cannot find the answer
anywhere...including the FAQ's and HOWTO's.
Lpr is broken,or the lpd is broken
when I try to print with lpr I get the familiar
lpr: connect: No such file or directory
jobs queued, but cannot start daemon.

I have all the files with the right permissions,including the ones
in /dev and that didnt work.

I'm using SLS 1.03 with kernel pl13 and I am running the tcp/ip

As a follow up, I found out why this was still happening. I had entries
in my /etc/networks file of the form;

net-a   192.9.200.0     alias1 

This form works fine on Suns, but Linux doesn't like the alias and
doesn't treat it like a network.  This drove me crazy because I KNEW I
was setting the network, but the static routes weren't showing up
correctly. Just using

net-a  192.9.200.0

works fine. Now my box is running like a dream, NFS client/server and all!

This should be in the NET-2 faq.

Cd to /usr/lib/zoneinfo; if you don't have this directory, get the file 
~/sources/sbin/timesrc-1.2.tar.gz from your favourite mirror site, or
the  binary distribution "zoneinfo.tgz" if you prefer.

Read the file "Time.doc", make the appropriate copy as explained,
and you're done.

First of all my apologies for the delay in posting this summary, I've been
a bit busy of late.  Secondly my thanks to the many people that replied.

OK, where do I start...

My original post was about setting up a Linux machine as a *nix server for
about 40 final year Computer Science students, not as a machine for any sort
of serious development work, but as a testbed where they could play around
with a real *nix system in a safe environment.

Rather than try to cover the many and varied replies I got I'll give the
overall conclusions I reached.

I had responses from people using Linux boxes as mail/news servers, personal
workstations, and people running labs full of Linux boxes!  Most people
found Linux stable and reliable.  I had several responses from people who
thought the idea of having the students run the system themselves was a good
one, as it gives them a chance to pick up some very useful practical
experience.

The hardware side was straightforward enough - you can never have to much RAM,
especially if X is to be used, or there'll be a fair bit of compiling going
on.  A 486DX2/66 with upwards of 16MB of RAM should be able to handle 10-12
'well-behaved' users concurrently.

Linux was recommended as the OS to use by everybody bar one - this is not
exactly surprising seeing as I only posted to the c.o.l hierarchy ;-)
The reasons put forward for Linux were generally:

        - Its free

        - You get the complete kernel source

        - It works

        - It sometimes doesn't work ;-)
          (as in it will occasionally crash, giving the students a chance
          to loose some sleep trying to get things fixed)

        - Its resilient - if something goes seriously wrong you can
          (hopefully!) re-install everything from scratch and have a 
          working system back in a matter of hours

        - It makes better use of the hardware than other *nixes

        - Its a complete *nix system

        - It gives you a *nix workstation for half the price of a typical
          *nix box

        - There's enough rough edges to keep people challenged / busy
          improving things


The reasons against Linux were:

        - Networking still needs some work (though it _is_ getting there!)

        - Lack of Documentation

        - Not uniform enough to provide a good teaching system.


Now for the results!  I submitted a proposal to the CS dept looking for a
machine to set up.  However at this stage things don't look promising, for
two reasons:

        - its a 'distraction' for the students (fair enough, its almost
          half way through the academic year, we've got plenty of other
          things to do)

        - there's a horrendous amount of politicking involved between the
          CS dept (the good guys) and computing services (the bad guys),
          who don't like the idea of a machine they don't control on the
          campus net.  (<soapbox on> Not that it'd make much of a 
          difference, they hardly seem to be able to manage the machines
          they already control ;-) <soapbox off>)

However!  In the longer term, say for the next academic year, there is the
possibility that something could be set up next summer, so all is not lost...


Thanks again to everybody who replied.

I assume that you start lpd in /etc/rc or similar. If so the problem
is probably that lpd dies after checking for any queued jobs.

I've had this same problem as well. My solution was to remove the
tcp/ip out of the kernel! Suddenly lpd stop dying and everything works
ok. 

I suspect that when lpd is run in an tcp/ip-environment it expects to
be called from inetd when needed.

Will PPP allow me to create a point-to-point link to a machine

Actually, it doesn't need to use just one or the other of SMTP & uux. I have
it selecting which it uses from some lookup tables. The configuration
options you want are :

/usr/local/lib/smail/config:

smart_path=<name of smart mail router>
smart_transport=smtp

Which will send all mail to your smart router (you probably have one).        
Certainly in the UK academic community, it's very unlikely indeed that you
won't use a smart router because of all of the (somewhat overbearing and    
complex) policy which governs JANET mail. However, you probably aren't in 
the UK, but whatever organization you are in, you're bound to have a 
smart mail host somewhere that will do the actual routing for you.

If you *really* don't want to use a smarthost, perhaps you should try
putting a pathalias entry in your "routers file" at the top as follows:

routers file:

pathalias:
  driver = pathalias, transport=smtp;
  file = /usr/local/lib/smail/paths, proto=lsearch


then, that paths file :

*       *!%s

.. *might* do it, but I haven't tried it.

There has been a lengthy thread on this topic in the 386bsd groups, NETbios
and SMB server software that will run on UNIX using TCP/IP.  Sounds like
several people have it working or are near.  I also remember a thread here
about a year ago.

This does not answer the original question, which was "What format
should the floppies be initially formatted in, before I use them for
backup?" Or does cpio format automatically, if it detects an
unfomatted floppy? (Hope not...)

To answer the question: probably any format is ok. Tar (and cpio)
treats the disk as containing a stream of blocks without any
structure. As long as the disk is "formatted", i.e. it contains the
needed sectors, address marks etc, it's ok. I have used floppies
formatted with DOS, Sony workstations and even Macintoshes (only
1440K) to write tar arcives on. The original file system written by,
for instance, the DOS format command is lost, of course. Btw, even
Linux has a 'format' command...
