   I can't get printing to work in Linux. I am getting errors such as "jobs

   These errors are discussed in the Printing-HOWTO doc, and the solution is
   to "configure yourself as a single node network".

   Can someone elaborate on how exactly to do this? I am on a single node
   network connected to the Internet..

I had the exact same problem last week but got it to work. Thanks to
all who sent suggestions. It turns out that my problems were related
to invalid file permissions/nonexisting files directories (courtesy of
SLS 1.03). Also, the suggestion in printing-FAQ is misleading (at
least in my case). 
I had to do the following:

1. Create /usr/spool/lpd that belong to user root, group lp.
   Contrary to what printing-FAQ says, i left this directory empty.
   lpd will put it's lock file in it when it gets started.

2. Create /usr/spool/lp1 (assuming this is your printer port) and also
   make sure that it belongs to user root, group lp.
   Go into /usr/spool/lp1 and create (touch into existence) the
   following files:
   /usr/spool/lp1/status, /usr/spool/lp1/lock, /usr/spool/lp1/.seq.
   Make sure all three files belong to user root, group lp.
   Make sure all three files have the permissions exactly as described
   in the printing-FAQ (notice that in my case these files are in lp1
   directory, not in lpd as sugessted in printing-FAQ). 

3. Make sure that your /usr/lib/lpfilter belongs to user root, group
   lp. If you do not have this file get it from somewhere - it's 
   printer dependant. The one I got was posted by someone on the net
   (for hp-deskjet500C).

4. Start lpd and try to print using lpr. If it works add /etc/lpd to
   your /etc/rc.local

This did it for me. Contrary to what the printing-FAQ said, I did NOT
have to configure myself as a single node network.

I still have a problem with lpq reporting empty print queue even when
something is in the process of being printed. If anybody can explain
why this may be happening please let me know.

Good luck.

Subject: empty /etc/fstab directory

Hello,

I ran e2fsck to maintain the file system on my Linux  0.99.12 and got the 
following messages

# e2fsck /dev/hda1
e2fsck 0.3, 93/04/22 for EXT2 FS 0.3a

    [lost of stuff deleted]

Then I tried "e2fsck -af /dev/hda1" to fix it.  It does not really fix the file
system.  It appears that /etc/fstab is a directory on my filesystem.  I 
recalled at some point when I read about fstab and I thought it was a FILE. 
Was I right?

Then I tried to check /etc/fstab and found that it does not even have
the file ".", the message is given below

# cd etc/fstab
# ls -al
ls: .: No such file or directory

I learned from the man page of fstab that "it is the duty 
of the system administrator to properly create and maintain this file."
But I do not grasp enough clues to maintain it.  Could some one tell me how
to fix the problem on my file system or show me where the docs to maintain
the fstab is?

Please e-mail me.
Thanks in advance.

   Greetings Networld,

   Reading O'Reilly's "Essential System Administration" (Nutshell serie),
on page 250 of my edition it talks about the BSD Fast filesystem.  Compared
to the "Traditional System V filesystem", it sounds quite impressive.  I
was wondering where ext2fs stands in comparison to these two?

   If anyone has technical documentation about Linux' fs'es I might have
missed, I would be much obliged if you could point me in the right direction.

   Thank you.

PL13p slip is broken - badly broken (as are all the current ALPHA's). I've

No the problem was that pl13p was corrupting the prev pointer chain of queued

The CCSO ph client shouldn't be a biggie (compiled 'out of the box' for

I think I've found where some of the confusion comes from.  If I'm correct, you
need an unqualified (short) host name in /etc/HOSTNAME and the fully qualified
name in /usr/local/lib/news/whoami.

Both of those are contrary to at least some of the documentation, but it does
appear to work.

>> Is the IBM ambra Blue Lightinig supported byu Linux. I had

I've been using the IBM BL with Linux pl12 & pl13 for the past couple of weeks.   
It works, but with some caveats. I thought a nice summary might be useful for  
you and others.

My Ambra Blue Lightning has the following:
        80486/DLC2 66Mhz processor (I think this is correct)
        8MB memory
        340MB IDE disk drive
        15 inch Ambra monitor (to 80Mhz bandwidth)
        on-board Adaptec AIC-6260 SCSI-II adapter
        Video controller - Western Digital WD90C33
        PS/2 auxillary mouse
        Colorado Jumbo 250 tape drive
        on-board 10base-T ethernet adapter
        3COM Etherlink II/16 (503-16) ethernet adapter

I'll only talk about things that posed a problem for me.  So if you don't see  
it mentioned, it works just fine.

(1) 80486/DLC2 66Mhz
        No floating point, but its not a problem for me. Have yet to find
        anything that does not work.  Seems fast to me.  19.02 BogoMips
        which is slower than a true DX2 processsor.  I have not played with
        the various caches to see if this might change.

(2) Adaptec AIC-6260 SCSI-II adapter
        I have been told, but yet to verify, that the 6260 is the same as the
        AHA1510 which is no supported in the default SLS configuration. However
        a driver is available.  The adapter works fine with my SCSI-CDROM using
        MS-Windows, so I know the H/W is OK.
        
(3) Western Digital WD90C33
        This is not supported in either XFree distribution.  The latest version
        supports the C31 and I am hoping these are close enough to work. No
        word on this at all though, nor have I tried XFree2.0.  I have been 

        using the XFree_Mono driver in 1024x768 mode. It looks a bit peculiar, 

        but it works well enough to get some serious work done.  It seems very
        fast (probably more a function of the fast processor).

(4) Colorado Jumbo 250
        This is not supported yet, but recent postings say there are versions
        of ftape that will work.  I hope to test this RSN

(5) on-board 10base-T
        When I ordered it, I did not really understand what 10base-T meant.
        What a piece of junk - works fine, once you buy a $500 hub. Geez.
        So I disabled it and bought the 3COM card.

(6) Rebooting
        This is a real inconvenience.  When rebooting, the BIOS routine being
        called does a "soft" boot (i.e. not like at power-on, no memory check
        etc.).  After calling the Adaptec BIOS, the machine hangs.  To get
        going, I hafta power-off/on.  Someday I will go into the kernel and 

        fix this.  But I almost never go into DOS, so its not that bad.

Hi folks,

I'm reasoning about partition sizes on my harddisk for Linux.
The drive's capacity is 200 Megs.
I'm planning to have /home and /usr each on a separate partition, plus a 
partition for / and all its subdirs (except /home and /usr), plus
a swap partition.
My machine has 4 Meg RAM, so I want to install the complete SLS release,
but without X.
Is the above partitioning a good choice?
Can anybody give me some hints on the sizes to choose for
my partitions?
