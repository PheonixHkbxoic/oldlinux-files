Actually, if you run SCO at higher security levels not even root can get away
with it.  Or at least it wasn't possible under 3.2.2; I haven't tried 3.2.4 at
higher levels than the purportedly "standard Unix" level.

This is the basic philosophy behind the Debian project!  The "base" system is
being put together right now, and is *very* solid.  Debian isn't publically
available yet, as it *is* really just a "base" on which the development teams
can build upon at this point.  My purpose is to serve as the overall
coordinator and organizer of the effort, the maintainer of the distribution as
a whole (i.e., incorporating the team contributions and packages into the
release), and the one who keeps the base up-to-date and bug free.  The other
development teams will have coordinaters to serve the latter purpose (still a
matter to be worked out).

The Debian project is currently cooperating with the FSSTND effort to implement
a well thought-out standard filesystem layout, and we are willing to work with
any other such groups.  A "standard" package installation method is obviously
a major issue in the Linux world at present.  I am willing to work with anyone
who wants to work on such a project.  Just let me know.

If there's anyone out there interested in helping out with a specific project
(i.e., X11) then also let me know.  I'm looking for people to coordinate such
projects.  I already have a few coordinators, but at present the organization
of the Debian project is a little shaky and combined with the time that I've
been spending on base development I haven't had much time to devote to it.
It'll all fall into place, eventually, if I can find people to help.

: My goal
:       one union base distrib with kernel + developement system

Currently under construction.

:       one exactly matching source disk to the base distrib !

A very real possibly, though not an immediate concern of mine.

:       everything else should be distributed in SVR4 pkgadd/pkgrm/...
:       format. Reason: binary compatibility to SVR4 is coming (soon?).
:       SVR4 is a consolidated platform for the 90's on PC's.

: Support the diskussion, maybe this way, too.
: The pkgadd... utilities a la SVR4 provide all needed features for
: clean package removing, pkg creating+listing, permission fixes ....

All other packages besides my base that are developed by the above-mentioned
teams will be seperate and optional.  One of things that hasn't been decided
upon is package format; I'm interested in hearing about whatever they have come
up with (is someone working on this?)

If you're intersted in Debian Linux, there is a DEBIAN channel on the
linux-activists list.  It's not very active now, but as soon as development
gets under way I'm sure that discussion will pick up.  Also, if you have
something specific to contribute or coordinate please contact me personally.

Yes.  System V utmp stores an "entry type" in each utmp entry; the run level
is stored in one which is appropriately labeled RUN_LEVEL (a manifest constant
declared in <utmp.h>).  who -r just prints any RUN_LEVEL entry in /etc/utmp.
The RUN_LEVEL entry also contains the *previous* run level, which some System
V rc scripts use to decide whether to do a full or a partial startup (say,
from init 2 to init 3 vs. init S to init 3).

If it is automatically deleted after init gets a SIGHUP, maybe removing the

hmmm... no wonder I've never run across it then...

I administer systems at hospitals and, in order to guarantee a certain
level of confidenciality, I set up SCO (3.2.4) (during installation
options) with their highest (they claim C2) level.

Not that C2 is very high (supposedly most Unix systems by default meet
C2 requirements), but I have to do everything I can. :)
For a good security book, check out O'Reilley's "Computer Security
Basics" or NSA's "Orange Book".  But that's a different thread and

Ah, to post knowing someone is going to flame me...

I've hacked my login program from the poeigl package such that, if
any non-root user is logging in on a secure terminal, bypass password
checking.  Basically, if you can sit down to my machine, then I trust
you enough to be who you are, but I still don't trust you enough to
give you root access.  The only problem with this scheme is, sometimes
when I have my machine term'ed onto the net and try to log into my account
from another machine, I don't know my password (because I don't use
it enough...)

works well enough for me.  if anyone can see any obvious hole that is
usable to gain root from a non-console machine, please tell me...
(yes. /etc/securetty is properly setup, with proper permissions)

    No but it sounds very easy to do with /proc 

    One thing I've noticed is that when I have a swap file (not swap

Aren't software bigots a wonderful thing.  I wonder what ever happened to
the internet of the old days. Where people were less inclined to flame or
abuse and more interested in helping others.  This attitude is typical of
so many. It's just so sad.

So he'd have to help you fix your ten-year-old totally-broken trabant?
Are you really serious? Any repair-shop mechanic would ALSO tell him
to get a better car. SLS is broken, live with it and accept with it.

Not fixing ten-year-old totally-broken trabants FOR FREE is hardly because of
being a religious fanatic. It's because they're so broken to begin 
with that the problems are yours. Why don't YOU help him with his SLS
problems? You're flaming someone for offering help, if the other one
decides to pick up a new car FOR FREE. I see this as a very good measure,
but apparently this is not good enough for you.

I'm working on configuring dialups.  I've set up mgetty-sendfax to
answer the phone (and receive faxes, I think).  It works.  You can log
in and do stuff, BUT you can't use sz or kermit to transfer files.
When the program starts, it drops carrier (hangs up the phone).  I can
also hang up the phone by doing a 'stty crtscts < /dev/cua1', but if
crtscts is already set it doesn't hang up the phone.

I was hoping that my boss could dial in and use uqwk * the helldiver

BTW, I'd tested uqwk & HPV (using FTP to download the file).  It looks

Again the points about SLS have been missed:

Point 1 - Peter initially released his install scripts with a freely 
          distributable copyright which he then recinded. 
Point 2 - Peter is distributing GNU copylefted software with his now non
          copylefted scripts. This is a violation of the GPL.
Point 3 - SLS has major installation problems because of insufficient testing.
          The testing release had bugs, insufficient documentation, and was
          avaiable only for an short period of time. It was as if Peter 
          didn't want anyone to test the distribution.
Point 4 - Many of the SLS 1.03 errors have yet to be fixed even after repeated
          postings on the same problems.
Point 5 - Peter is making the bucks off of the SLS distribution (to non-netters)
          so saying that it's free in the money sense and that Peter is doing
          this only from the goddness of his heart is somewhat misleading.
          At the point you receive cash for a task it becomes a profession.
          SLS 1.03 doesn't look very professional at this point in time.
Point 6 - THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE! SLS is not the end all and be all of Linux
          distributions even though many folks out here seems to think that's
          the case. At one point in time that may have been true but MCC,
          the soon to be released Debian and especially Slackware are available
          with much less hassle and much more responiveness. Patrick Volkerding
          has done a wonderful job with Slackware. When his release has problems
          and people post/mail suggestions not only does he respond to them but
          he even incorporates changes in his new releases. Also be aware that
          when Peter finally decided to drop his scripts "hammer" that Patrick
          was the named target. Peter stared all this. I think we have a right 
          to give him "hash" as you call it.

As I've been saying 1st impressions are extremely important when you're talking
about initial distributions that go on peoples machines. SLS 1.03 just isn't
cutting it. Just because it's free dosn't mean it can't be correct or more
importantly correctable. Peter's attitute and distribution comes across as
very unprofessional. We don't need that at this point in Linux's development.

For my money ( or lack thereof) Slackware 1.02 is where it's at. Check it out.

Disclaimer: This is an unsolicted opinion. I'm just a satisfied Slackware
            user. In fact I just put the new release on my home machine 2
            days ago. And only minor problems (like reboot doesn't exist).

I don't think any of this is in dispute.  Some points though:
1. SLS is available free, but there _are_ plenty of people who pay for it.
   Not all the world has net access.  Technically what they're paying for
   is the service of putting it on disks and shipping it, but that's a pretty
   fine point.
2. Nobody claims to be perfect.  It's a given that there _will_ be problems
   with any distribution.  What I'm on about (and many others, I think)
   is that when we generate bug reports, they seem to be ignored.  Even
   simple things like the rdev > /etc/mtab thing.  It was unfortunate when
   it didn't work in the first release it stopped working in.  It was
   more than unfortunate that it didn't get fixed in the next version
   (nor apparently has it been fixed _yet_).
3. There's a lot of grumbling about fixing it or shutting up about it.
   I've fixed these and many other problems on *my* machine, but there's
   nothing I can do about SLS.  I can't even fix blatently broken things
   and redistribute it.  Well, I could; I don't think Peter's position
   with respect to his copyright holds any legal or ethical water, but
   I will go along with his wishes and not do so.  
4. What Peter charges for SLS has no bearing on his responsibility to
   maintain some semblence of quality.  The fact is, SLS seems to be the
   most common method for new installations of Linux.  It would be a
   different matter if we were talking about a quick n dirty hack I wrote
   that broke often, but which I gave quietly to only a few of my 
   hacker friends and told them it wasn't very good.  Most (many) people
   using SLS don't have the knowledge to fix things that are wrong without
   outside help of some sort.  Peter has a responsibility to these people
   to at least try to get things so they work.
5. Some say we've outgrown SLS.  I'm not sure about that.  I wouldn't
   want to use SLS for a new install, even if it worked right.  But I'm
   probably not a typical first time user.  I think if it worked properly
   it would be a good thing.  Sad fact is, though, it doesn't.
