Try ".profile" 
The C-Shell ("csh") uses ".cshrc" files, while the
Bourne shell ("sh"), and the Bourne Again shell
("bash") use ".profile" files to store initial
commands.

Hi, there!

        That you got messed up is your own fault. Sad but true. The very
first pages of the NET-2-HOWTO explain how to get the NET-2-Software you need
to run the NET-2 stuff on the user's end. As it is in UNIX-land: there is
a kernel-side and user's side.
        These few pages direct you to get the net-ext*, net-std*, net-base*
packages (don't know the names excactly any more) from tsx-11 or whereever.
Follwoing the instructions, you'll find yourself having /etc/rc.d/rc.inet[12],
the symbolic links to /conf and so on.

        RTFM and enjoy

        Teggy

I need to reinstall my X11 part of the Linux system. I am using
the /dev/fd1 (3.5 floppy) and do

        sysinstall -instdev /dev/fd1 -series x

I get something like 
        insert disk x1 in floppy drive or enter q to quit.

I hit enter and I get the 'same' message again. 
The script exits after repeating the above message thrice.

I have the same problem using the "menu" install software option.

If anyone has any pointers, please let me know.
Thanks.

You're right...I helped write that part of the NET2-HOWTO (my input was 
included in it by the the overseer, Matt Welsh).  The HOWTO specifically
tells you that /conf/net/* must be created by hand.

The other stuff is covered as well...

O.K., it wasn't until I went through this that I could see any
problem, and it seems to be a perceptual one on your part.  free
reports K, it just doesn't say so, so free is saying 13792K used, so
there is most of your memory.

If that isn't your problem, you must be saying you have 32 meg, and
only 16 is showing up in linux, in which case you need to recompile
your kernel to use memory above 16M (though I thought SLS did that
automatically).

Doesn't seem clear what your problem is.  Do you have 32Mb of RAM but
Linux is only recognising 16?  In this case, recompile the kernel with
the option to allow extra memory, and try that.

If you are saying "why have I only got 1172Kb free when I'm doing nothing"
then you have been caught in the great memory coverup.
Linux is a clever system that allocates memory to the disk buffer on
demand.  The free output shows that 10Mb of the memory is currently
assigned to this.  As your program load increases memory will be dropped
from the buffer and given back to program use, and when the program load
drops the spare memory can be reallocate to the buffer.
There is one downside to this caching system: when memory is needed for
programs, the buffer needs to shrink, and this can lead to a pause as
parts of it are written back to disk.  This is one case where a hardware
cache can be beneficial!

Hope this helps.

I had to do a big kludge to get proxy ARP and SLIP working under
Linux.  Solution: use another machine on the same network to respond
to ARP requests!  In my case, I added a public arp entry onto a
machine running KA9Q.

It's not elegant, but it works. Perhaps I missed something with Linux,
but after looking through the kernel source (net-2e alpha 4 for
networking) I can't see how Linux would do the ARP reply; it just gets
ignored.

When proxy ARP is finally added, Ill be ready: I patched the arp
program to handle the right flags (maybe I should mail the diffs to
FvK).  Anyone know when Linux will be able to handle proxy ARP? It
seems to be a big feature that's missing, and it is very handy with
SLIP connections.

Check out /etc/profile, lots of things like aliases are defined there
as well.

Subject: TeX from SLS
Date: Sat, 18 Sep 1993 21:01:02 +0200

Hi.

Just read the thread about installing the SLS-T-Disks if one wants to install
TeX (yes, I know, I'm a little "behind" -> I get the news with modem...).

Just a hint. Also! the TeX-Disks from SLS seem to be screwed up. In the
archive texbin.tgz (on T1) is a file /usr/Tex/lib/tex/inputs which really
shouldn't be in there. It prevents two or three following archives to install
correctly 'cause in them there are files which should be extracted to
/usr/TeX/lib/tex/ inputs/* (a directory).

I solved this just by NOT-installing the archive texbin during "normal"
installation of the T-series (btw just grep for pkgtool in the setup script to
get an idea how to use it). I installed this package then manually.

One more word to pkgtool. I'd really like to see coming up some help lines
when it is started without parameters.. (and - please - mentioning the real!
switches - not like SLS's sysinstall :->, I just say "series").

bye,
    Peter

Why not just make the scripts rx only for owner/group, set owner to be

If you have got the money for memory, put it into main memory for linux
not a hardware disk cache. 
If you don't need the memory for programs then you have a bigger
buffer cache. If you need the memory for programs then your hardware disk
cache is not going to help a whole lot.
