  I'm beginning to suspect my cable. It's plugged into a 25-pin serial
port, runs through a HW Flowcontrol null modem, and into a Macintosh 
(Macs make great terminals).

  Anyway, very often I'll get a few (one, or two) characters before
getty dies. /etc/issue is set for "Sequential Systems BBS" and I
get "Se", "Seq". Very rarely getty will survive and I can log in.
I didn't have this problem with the pl9 kernel; this is new with
pl12. Should I still be using ttyS*, or are there other devices
to use with the new kernel? The permissions aren't set right on
cua1 for this, and cua1 is for dialout anyway, right?

  This thing is too much like Unix :-) perhaps plan9 will be
more of what I'm after. I'm still sticking with Linux because after
all, there's nothing better.

Everyone should have a bootable root floppy for emergency repairs. You
can get these ready made but it's quite easy to make your own. For
example here's the script I use to make mine. It only supports single
use mode because that's what I want.

Note I don't use a ramdisk which means I can't take the floppy out of
/dev/fd0 but I don't usually find this a problem. If someone would
like to post a ramdisk equivalent I'd be interested.

You probably have an older version of mbox. Get mbox10
which is "the first international release of ix/MBox" 
(excerpt from the README-file). Low-level error-messages
and comments are still in german, anyway the users should
never see them ;-) (The README contains a translation, though)

I got mbox10 either from sunsite or from tsx-11 (/pub/Linux/bbs)

Hello.

I'm not sure if this is the appropriate place to post, but here is my problem.

I have set up a number of Linux boxes in my lab, but some people still program
on the MSDOG side and require access to my code and some executables...
It would be preferable to me to have full access to the binaries, and to worry
about the ^M problem on a file to file basis, yet... I do not know what options
to set in my fstab.  All the options i have tried have failed.

What options would I set in my /etc/fstab to be able to copy binaries from my
MushDOS partitions to the PC-NFS mounted partitions?

Thanks a million,
James

Don't waste a ton of paper printing the Net Admin Guide, until you've
inserted the proper scaling commands into the PostScript to make it FIT
on LETTER-sized paper (or print it on LEGAL-size).

I don't have a LEGAL-sized tray, so I insterted the line:

        1.0 0.9 scale

immediately after each and every one of the 240-odd "%%Page ### ###" lines.

That scales it down to LETTER size.  You'll hardly notice the distortion.

What a pain, eh?

I have a crontab entry that cuts off all log files once a day,
something like

FILES="/usr/spool/smail/log /usr/spool/uucp/Debug /usr/log/*"
# all growing log files on my system...
OLD="/tmp/old.$$"
for i in $FILES; do
    mv -f $i $OLD
    tail +50k $OLD > $i
    rm $OLD
done

(quoted from memory, forgot the correct tail syntax)

Depending on your definition of 'prevent'... (complete prevention can
usually not be done, and whether such action makes sense is a
completely different case, but...)

You could maintain two active files with different access permissions
and two different newsreaders, respectively (difficult); or set the
permissions of the spool area accordingly (i.e. world-readable vs
group-readable, and give the adults a setgid newsreader and the
non-adults [!=children, but that's still a different question] a
non-setgid-one)

This will fail because newsreader programs are often setuid or setgid
to 'news'. A different approach would be to maintain two different
versions of them, or two different front-ends which are setuid, check
the effective uid and ecxecute the real newsreader in setuid mode or
not, accordingly.
