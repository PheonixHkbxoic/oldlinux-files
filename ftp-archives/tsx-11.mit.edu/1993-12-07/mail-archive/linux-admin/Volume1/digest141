Boy, has this generated some storms...;-{.

Anyway, no, I NEVER use dos. from a Unix SYSV standard man page:

      Only mv allows file1 to be a directory. In which case, the
      directory rename occurs only if the two directories have the
      same parent; file1 is renamed target.

This is the standard behavior i have expected in ~15 years of using
(mostly att based) unix systems.

I want to install Linux to my 486 system with an AHA-1522.
When I read Linux documents, I got something like "To use
AHA-1522, bootable kernel is not available".  What does this
mean ? 

Thanks.

Indefinite banner printing may be a result of false lpd<->of cooperation.
The output-filter is supposed to SIGSTOP itself after recieving \031\1
in its stdin. That is happening when the burst page is finished (that's
the only output of lpd, isn't it?).
A bug in lpd causes the of being restarted everytime it stops, so it
prints the burst page again and again.

The bugous line is somewhere in printjob.c:

#ifdef LINIX
!  if(!WIFSTOPPED(status)){
#else

You can fix lpd, or you can simply disable output filtering in
/etc/printcap.

        int handle = shmget(IPC_PRIVATE, size, ______);

flags should be SHM_R | SHM_W to read and write (as I read it).
However, those symbols are defined only if symbol kernel is defined.
As I understand it, by default it is read/write, and you can use SHM_RDONLY
to mean read-only access.  So, I passed in zero.  The handle returns as
an error, and nothing else works.  What should be passed in?  What am I doing
wrong?

I am using MCC-based linux PL10 with IPC built into the kernel, 16M 486DX33,
670M SCSI (not that that should matter).

From man mv on a Sparc 10, SunOS 4.1.3A:
        mv moves files and directories around in the file system. A
        side effect of mv is to rename a file or directory.
        ...
        BUGS
        mv will not move a directory from one file system to another.

All the UNIX machines here at MTU I've ever used had this
behavior.  Some BSD, some SysV.

It works for me (I got it to work with UUPC which is a DOS version of
uucp). I did not use getty_ps that came with SLS (don't trust anything
that comes with SLS any more - all the UUCP file permissions were
wrong). Instead I got getty_ps package from sunsite and compiled it myself.
At this point I can remotely login using uugetty, copy files (uucp)
to and from my remote Linux box, or send mail to users on my Linux box
(all through uugetty from getty_ps package). When you are setting up
uucp Systems and Permissions files just make sure you follow
O'Reilly's "Managing UUCP" (nutshell series) and you won't have any
problems.

For me, the solution was similar:  The *other* system was dropping
characters if the local responded too quickly to its prompts.

So if my chat said

        expect send ...

I changed it to

        expect \dsend ...

and the problem was solved.

Oh Dear. Nice theory. However

        a) I compiled with shadow passwords
        b) I (for my sins) have a password for root in /etc/passwd.

Re b), if you are using shadow passwords then the password field in 
/etc/passwd should be set to * rather than blank, this stops non shadow
compiled programgetting in thru /etc/passwd.

Sorry but I don't think this is the problem.

The solution is simple. Define -DSHADOW_PWD in the makefile if you use the
shadow library and don't forget to specify -lshadow as well. By default,
login does NOT use shadow passwords, which is good, since the shadow passwd
encryption is incompatible with the standard. Just copying encrypted passwords

Try this :
cd /usr/src/linux
make config  ( to select the driver options for the kernel (e.g. scsi)
make clean   ( clear out any old compiler output )
make dep     ( set up dependancies)
make [zImage|zdisk] (these probably are the 2 most used options)

You might also want to edit the Makefile to set defaults for vga or

Apparently it matters whether you login from a root account on another
machine or whether you rlogin from an ordinary account, right?
If this is true, I would think the problem is in rlogind, as /bin/login
shouldn't know anything about the far end of the conection. At least that's
how I understand it.

If you use telnet from the other end of the network, do you experience the
same behaviour?

I really can't see how you can get reported behavior from "my" login program,
as one of the last things it does is a "setuid(newuid)" just before starting
the shell.

Just as a test, you might want to build the login program without shadow
support, and see what happens then.

We've installed the Linux SLS 1.02 (= not the most recent version)
distribution on a Thinkpad 300C (IBM's 386SL color notebook) the day
before yesterday.

It works ok, though we had a little trouble with the Linux extended fs.

We also managed to run Xfree (pre-2.0) in monochrome mode with a Microsoft-
compatible mouse on the serial port.  We only have 4M RAM installed + 8M swap.
It's slow but won't crash.  We'll try Xfree 2.0 with 16bit color next.

This probably means you can run Linux on *any* ThinkPad [fingers crossed].
