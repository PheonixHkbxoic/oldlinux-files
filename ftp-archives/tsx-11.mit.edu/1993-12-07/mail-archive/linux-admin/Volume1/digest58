Date: Mon, 13 Sep 1993 00:00:27 GMT

I'm wondering, has anyone else run into problems where CRON jobs
don't all seem to run?  I have a number of crontab entries, some
of which run, others of which don't ever seem to do anything.
Is cron in .99P12 (SLS 1.03) flakey?

Subject: UUCP connection troubles
Date: Mon, 13 Sep 1993 00:06:29 GMT

I've been running into a case where I have troubles establishing a
UUCP connection (using .99P12 [SLS 1.03]).  Whenever I initiate a
poll using "uusched -x 2 -S systemname" (2 or higher), it works fine.
However if I don't use the debug flag, when the modems connect no
login takes place.  I'd just turn debugging on, but am not sure how
to get elm to send that flag to uucp (uux?).  I set the -x2 flag on
all of the "uux" lines in my smail "transports" file, but they don't
seem to make a difference.

This only happens with one system I call (which happens to be another
LINUX .99P12 machine).  One other system I call is OK.  But one *other*
system I call fails to establish uucp protocol.  The errors
are as follows:

uucp other-system (9/12-06:35:40,3219,0) DEBUG: fgsend_control: Sending control INITA
uucp other-system (9/12-06:35:40,3219,0) DEBUG: fgsend_control: Sending control INITA

What's going on with UUCP in P12?

Thanks in advance.

Thanks but there must be more to it than that.  I made that change,
but the same symptoms persisted.  Also I am wondering, when a new
kernel rev comes out, will the patch not apply correctly if I've
made changes like this to the kernel source tree?

The latest version is beta051.  The program's author is busily tidying up
loose ends, and the official release (in about a week) will compile out
of the box on linux - no install/makefile tweaking neccessary.  The kernel
requires a minor patch to make FIFO's work like they're supposed to, and
this is included - see port/linux/README.

This is what I did. Not hard at all. Login to bbs in sig as guest. Go to

Now I am working on a simple line editor for the bbs using shell scripts.

HEY MAN!
When you prefer MCC instead of SLS, it's your problem.
But in this case, a guy tries to install SLS, has a problem and needs
some help.
  - You can and want help him -> fine !! 
  - You won't because you dislike SLS ?? -> it's your choice,
    but PLEASE don't behave so arrogant.
SLS works for me (100% perfect) and i don't see a reason to change.
(when you are unable to install it - it's your problem, not SLS's)

To the other crazy guy (Tuomas Lukka) :
1.) I never saw *YOU* help, too, and
2.) Ever thought about the possibility to help via email instead of
    posting hints?
 
TO PHIL RICHARDS:
Oh, wait!
If i ring a mercedes-repair-service, i really don't expect, they'll fix
my buick. BUT :
If i have a problem concerning LINUX, i'd post it in a LINUX-group.
(and there's no c.o.l.SLS or c.o.l.MCC available) ;-)
 

hope i'll never have to read such BULLSHIT here anymore,
Stefan

Sorry, no answer. But I got exactly the same problem. I realized that I can try
to mount the second or third "NFS-partition" may be 10 minutes later and this will
sometimes run!!! On the other hand I saw the mount-daemon on my NFS-server (LINUX too)
crashing my whole system when taking more than 97% of my CPU-time. After killing
the mountd and restarting it, I sometimes can mount more than one "NFS-partition".

We got this far with a televideo... even to the stage that we could
get chars to./from the terminal. Getty/login would not cooperate hoever.
Suggesstions that we got were not to use a null modem cable (wouldnt
work) and to try and spawn getty by hand. This, we found didnt work
either. Hmm Getty would be disabled by init because it respawned too
quickly. I think that it is something to do with the control signals
are not what getty wants to see. We havent foudn a way of getting getty
to accept what it sees however.

 
not much help i know..

I don't want to stop your flame wars about distributions, but:

What may be the reason for the hang ?

What is Alib ?
If it is a scsi-driver, a other kernel without scsi-support will help.
If it is a soundcard-driver, a other kernel without this support will help.

I can't see any need for a Alib on a EISA / VLB ...

This isn't necessarily true. You can argue that since the broken (;-)
install scripts of his own vintage and the copylefted programs (e.g.
Linux kernel, gcc) he happens to package on the same set of disks are
completely distinct programs which don't depend in any way on each
other, he can do what he wants. Nothing in the scripts is a derived
work of GPLed software (as far as I'm aware).

Btw., there is other non-GPL software on the SLS disks too - Berkeley
stuff or smail, for an example.

Well, the thing is, some of us find that the best solution to
SLS installation problems is to go for MCC. Are you sure that the
guy really wants to install just SLS? For beginners in unix, MCC might
be a lot easier to digest, install and so on. There's even DOCUMENTATION!

>To the other crazy guy (Tuomas Lukka) :
>1.) I never saw *YOU* help, too, and

Maybe I am crazy, but I just don't see why suggesting the use of an
alternative release and an offer to help him with it via email could be
considered offensive. I also find that suggesting a non-SLS release would
be of the greatest help to many people. So he actually could and wanted
to help him with his problem.

1.) I help when any time I see a question that I can answer and a hundred
 others can't. It doesn't happen too often, but it does.
2.) This is why c.o.l.* are writeonly groups. It's usually better to
 post, so the information may be shared by the FAQ maintainers,
 others having the same problem and people knowing better so they can
 correct you.

Let me quote you again

>SLS works for me (100% perfect) and i don't see a reason to change.
>(when you are unable to install it - it's your problem, not SLS's)

The second sentence of these is the more arrogant one. Many people know
how SLS is and how it compares to MCC... it's your problem, yes, but
your problem is the use of SLS.

I really think I should stop posting on this thread, but some of the 
things said are just too heavy to digest.

Unfortunately the install scripts just don't happen to be on the disk. They 
are not only an integral part of the distribution, they are the KEY part
of the distribution. Therefore they must be included under the GPL or
not be distributed at all.

>

Key difference: No one is trying to restrict their distribution.

Moot point anyway. Soon there will be enough different distributions that it
won't matter anyway. If SLS continues to have problems people will stop using
it. If if isn't used then folks will stop answering questions about it not
out of meanness but simply because they won't know the answers due to not
using the distributions.

The real question I have is: Does Peter really care since we are not the source
of his funds? He gives away SLS and sells support. Folks who pay for support
get their answers and their problems fixed. It seems that netters are left high
and dry in SLS land.

Anyway this is my last post of the subject. Use Slackware, use Debian, use MCC,
even use SLS. It doesn't really matter. Just please stop saying that "it's free,
so don't complain" or "Peter is trying real hard." when in fact SLS could be
as solid a product as the others.

Later,

I didn't do any tests as accurate as you did. But I moved my complete /usr to
a NFS mounted drive on a dec-utlrix 3100. And from this time on, rebuilding
the kernel (/usr/src/linux) using gcc (/usr/lib/....)
took me about 1h20m as opposed before about 20m. Before reading your msg I was
always thinking it is the ultrix system to blame, but now ?

The basic 99.10 continues to work fine, but at boot time I get
