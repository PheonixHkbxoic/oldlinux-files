I am  having problems with mounting nfs suid.   It works when it feels like it.
I have to umount, and the remount two or three times before the suid is 
actually working.  Has anyone else meet up with this?  Also, I did have my 
network trusted, but now some of the machines no longer trust each other, and 
I didn't change a thing...  it seems the trusting of the machines has something
to do with it being mounted actually suid....

I'm updating from .99pl6 to .99pl10 (I'm still running a relatively old
(~3 release old) SLS distribution).  When I boot the new kernel the root
filesystem (minix) is read-only.  Do I have an outdated 'mount' or ?

  Thanks!

   There seems to be a lot of traffic (over time, at least) asking
about what tape backups are supported under linux.  Also, the FAQ
really will only help someone who's REALLY up on tape drive tech.
SO... could anyone who's gotten a tape drive to work please mail me
with the make of the controller (if needed), the drive, and what
(if any) work is needed to get it to work (special drivers, kernel
hacking, pulling it out of the box, etc.)  I'll put together a
complete list (if it already exists and I haven't seen it, PLEASE
tell me, to save me a lot of time) and post it here.  Thanks.

I'd like to know this too.

If not, is there a cd player for linux and a mitsumi drive?

The driver seems to have audio support.

Guys, I don't believe this is an administration question...

cola is for administration, and thirst quenching!-)

Anyway, I'll try to answer your questions.  I think the most
appropriate answer, would be to refer you to pl12.  You can find it on
sunsite.unc.edu, under

/pub/Linux/kernel/linux-0.99.12.tar.gz
/pub/Linux/kernel/linux-0.99.patch12.gz
/pub/Linux/kernel/linux-0.99.12.small-patch

I would suggest getting the whole package, which is

linux-0.99.patch12.gz

and the small-patch, to fix a but n the pl12 code.

This has the mitsumi-cd & sound drivers.

don't forget to edit the linux/include/mcd.h to specify your cdrom

Subject: How to add a new partition.
Date: 21 Aug 1993 23:21:36 -0400

 
I needed to make more HD space for my Linux (SLS 1.03). I found
fips01alpha.tar.z on sunsite.unc.edu in pub/Linux/system/Install. This
DOS program splits off a new partition from your free space on a dos
partition. It's necessary to run a disk de-fragger first.

This program worked fine. I booted Linux and ran fdisk to add the new
partition and change the system id. I tried to make the system id #5 (e2fs)
but that didn't work: fdisk says "you cannot change to extended filesystem".
I was able to change it to Linux/minix (system id #81). Then I ran mkfs.
After this I was able to move my manpages to the new partition /dev/hda3 and
save some space on my root Linux partition (dev/hda2). 
 
My question centers on how to best utilize the new partition. Presently I
mount it on /e. I've inserted a line in /etc/rc:
        mount -t minix /dev/hda3 /e

Also I editted manpath.config to reflect the new location of my manpages.

I'm wondering if this is the best approach. I'd like to put more stuff on
/dev/hda3. Also I don't understand the function of /etc/fstab, although I've
searched the faqs for info on it. If anyone has suggestions or comments I'll
be grateful - I'm sorta new at this. 

Thanks,
Dan

Regarding Shadow, what kernel and pl are you using with it?  I'm running
99pl8 (I know, 10's out... slow me), and have never had any trouble with
adding/modifying users by hand.  If there's a problem I may be running into,
I'd like to know about it before I really hose up some (or, heaven forbid

Only if that machine could try out each of those 2704 passwords on the
actual machine it is trying to break into.  What system would anyone have
access to like that?  (Honestly, I'm curious).  Our system, for example,
gives 2 chances on the modems, with 6 second delays, 20 second total chance
time, then hangup city.  If 20 invalid attempts made on any port on the
system it is automatically locked out.

And most commercial Unix's have at least SOME built-in password restrictions
(ours is 6 char min with at least two alpha and 1 number, login names and
real names, departments, etc, are checked and blocked too). 

Add no blank passwords, no outside ethernet or trusted hosts.

I guess I don't understand how a system can be broken into with those rules 
in effect except maybe through telnet or rlogin- but I think those have
time-outs and lock-outs and # of chances too...

I think the most common way would be to grab the /etc/passwd file
via ftp or tftp.  This is even more helpful to the cracker, since
they can ecrypt one word at a time and then check each against all of
the passwords for a match (considering that the crypt takes much longer
than a compare, this is a big win).  Salting the password file slows things
down alot, or simply not keeping the passwords in a world readable file
(shadow password file) will prevent this sort of attack.

In Linux using shadow passwords, it would take an extreme amount
of time, because you would have to go through the login interface
and would run up against the mechanisms you describe.

  There is a xenix filesystem for Linux, and you should be able to do

 Unfortunatly that doesn help those of us stuck using 'broken' machines. My
'main' machine is a Tektronix's workstation, it has the big disks, my
Linux box ( currently PL9 ) has most of its files on the Tek. Fixing the
Tektronix NFS is rather out of the question, besides the fact I couldnt
afford Tektronix support for the machine, they dumped their workstation
line several years ago! My only option is to 'fix' linux.
 Would it be so bad to add an option to the Linux NFS to use the
older NFS spec ?. Cant be that hard to have an option to force it only
to send one group id, instead of many.

 I would imagine there would be a few linuxers in similar position, having
aquired old high performance workstations, with old Unix software, and 
also run Linux on a not so high perfomance PC for hacking on..

 BTW, Solaris wont have any thing to do with my Tek's NFS either, id already
figured that the NFS problem was with my Tek, but its also the machine I
cant fix !

UFC-crypt duplicates the password encryption algorithm used on most (I'm
tempted to say "all") *ix systems, so all you need from the target system is
the encrypted passwords.  Which brings us back to the beginning of the
discussion:  that's why there is a root-only shadow password file.

By the way, you misread it --- I was saying how much to multiply the quoted
times by to get the time to check all of them (basically airchecking myself),
not how many passwords.

Generating cleartext passwords is cheap --- you could generate all possible
8-letter passwords very quickly on even an Apple II or TRS-80 Mod I.  The
point of UFC-crypt is that it generates the *encrypted* passwords quickly,
compared to the "standard" algorithm.  And the point of the massively parallel
(I think...) machines mentioned above is that they can take advantage of
UFC-crypt to turn into high-speed "crackboxes".
