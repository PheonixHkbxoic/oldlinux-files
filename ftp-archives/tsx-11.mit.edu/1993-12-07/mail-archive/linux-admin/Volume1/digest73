You might want to make it executable by everyone - it should 
be clear if the other or group executable bit isn't set then 
only root can execute the script.

Well i think you have made a good point here. But if i get problems
with e.g. SLS1.03 i know imediately who is to blame: The guys from
tsx-11.mit.edu. Because thats where i ftp it from. And i think they
can be trusted. Same story holds for linux on CD-ROM.

so... happy linuxing :)

Has anyone set up X Windows (using xdm) under TAMU.99pl12+ ???

I just can't seem to get it to work, and I can't figure out why not.

Starting up X with "startx" works fine... for root, but not for users.

Date: Thu, 23 Sep 1993 16:02:58 +0000

I have linux running on two different machines and both of them will
crash as various times.

The hardware :-

   386/20, 387 copro, 8Mb ram, 300Mb ESDI hdd, clone ne2000

   486/50, 16Mb ram, 500 + 340 Mb SCSI hdd, Adaptec 1542B, clone ne2000

The software :-

   SLS 102 based installation. pl10 kernel ethernet drivers hard coded
   (auto probe hangs with my cards :-( )

The problems :-

   The 486 machine invariable just dies. No keyboard response, nothing.
   system requires re-boot.

   The 386 machine either hangs or panics with the following information :-

and the line :-

was positioned after the 'Pid: 0 ......' line

Please could someone tell me what is causing these crashes, or let
me know where I can look to find the relevant information.

Many thanks in advance. I look forward to your replies.

Well, there is a program called pkgtool on the boot disk for Slackware,
but for some reason it was not included in the install set. You can just 
boot using this disk, and then mount the root filesystem and copy that
file to the root system so you can use it when you need to, or I guess
you could just install the new set after booting from the floppy.

        I agree with you in general; but binary distributions are not going
to go away.  One thing that might help (a little) is if people who put
together packages would provide some kind of checksum of the package as a
whole.  This would not only help to verify that the binary XWYSIWIG 2.0
release that you just downloaded is clean (according to the original
packager); but would also help to quickly find the occassional corrupted
file that occurs.  Since checksums are much smaller then whole packages; they
could be distributed through some other channel then binaries.  This may
only work for the larger packages that have recognized authors; but it still
would be an improvement.

   I've discovered what the problem is.

   When crond tries to send mail, it uses the command line

   sh -c /bin/mail -d user

  Since the slackware 1.03 mkconfig program relinks elm to /bin/mail, it
chokes on the -d switch, and starts interpreting the contents of the
output file as commands, etc.

   So it royally screws things up.

   As a temporary fix, I've edited crond so that the "-d" switch isn't
used, and everything seems to be OK now.

   Does anyone know *why* crond is using that switch?

Er, they just make it available for ftp.  If you got it from sunsite,
would you blame them if something was wrong?  If you got it from a
friend who would you blame?  The friend?  He (probably) just got it
from another site, and that is exactly what happens with ftp.  They
just get it from somewhere else and make it available.  If you think
every ftp site tests every piece of software available on their
site, you're nuts.  Especially with binaries; they'd have to have
the inclination to test everything, plus the hardware to do it on.

If there's something wrong with a distribution, (and the problem really
does originate with the distribution), blame it on the person(s) who
packaged it.  Don't blame the guy who passes it along as a favor.

Your point is well taken- the only true security is intimacy with the source
code (just a casual glance won't do), but for cases like the about, the strace
tool can provide some level of assurance. Strace(1) gives a listing of all
the system calls used by a binary- run it on suspicious binaries to find
out what is going on.

Indeed! :^)

The "-d" flag is included in the config.h file that comes with Vixie
Cron. Apparently some systems use it to signal local mail delivery and
save a little CPU time. The config.h comments do note that the flag is 
undocumented.  Although "mail" will accept it, elm doesn't like it at all.

I've recompiled crond so that it no longer uses this flag. The binary
can be found on ftp.cdrom.com in /pub/linux/binaries. The binary in
bin.tgz will be fixed soon, too.
