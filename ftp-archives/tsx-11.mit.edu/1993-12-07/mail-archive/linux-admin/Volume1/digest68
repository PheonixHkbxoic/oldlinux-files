I've forgotten how this thread started (after wading through a 100 messages) 
but if you want to allow users to shutdown the machine why don't you just 
add the users to the group operator (or it's equilvalent?) 

Type

        ls -ldg shutdown 

and then add the user to the group id of shutdown. On a SPARC, this is 

        operator 

I agree with a previous poster, never install a shell script with the root 
UID bits set - convert it a C program and compile if you must use root UID 
bits!

This is exactly why I don't keep Slackware on my BBS rather than SLS (even
though I would very much like to).  I don't have disk space for both
distributions, and I have to cater to the lowest common denominator--those
people who don't have 3.5" drives.

This is a good start, but some of the other disk images still don't fit onto
5.25" disks, so you still need a 3.5 as a second drive to install it.

Exactly.  Most people have hard drives less than 100MB.  If you want install
everything from a DOS partition (which needs to have, what, 40MB free?),
this leaves only 60MB for Linux.

So he should move everything over to 5.25.  The convenience that exists now
for people with 3.5's hardly makes up for the trouble that 5.25-only people
have to go through.

What planet do you live on?  It is true that most computers sold now have
3.5" drives or both sizes installed, but there is a huge installed base of
386's out there that only have 5.25" drives.  When I got my 486 less than a
year ago from Gateway 2000 (the 3rd largest manufacturer of PC's in North
America) it had the 5.25" as the boot drive.  I have never seen a software
package that didn't have 5.25" floppies available.

That's great for YOU, but how about everybody else.  Like I said in another
post, Slackware should be in a format usable by EVERYONE.  5.25" disk images
fit onto 3.5" disks, but it doesn't work the other way around.

personally, I find it easier to have a sane action for "ctraltdel"
in my inittab.  Currently it reboots, I could make it halt, of 
course.... that way, only the person on the console could reboot 
the machine, but there's no "dangerous" script lying around.

Leave it out, the Slackware distribution is free pro gratis and costs nothing, 
5.25 is dead as a format, I install software every day, I havent seen 5.25 
ship in a standard distribution with over 2 years. If it doesn't work well 
'Tough Turnips' a 3.5 drive is a very cheap option. I dont want to hear 
stories about lack of drive bays, bios problems or other bollocks. If you are 
not statisfied get the sources and roll your own and shut up whining about it.
 

The amount of garbage spewed here on this topic is unreal, no one is Forcing
anyone to use any distribution, If it doesn't suit, well tough shit!!!!. We
are lucky to have distributions at all.

I have had no trouble with 4.4.1 and gcc2.4.5 -  I'm assuming you mean
4.4.2 above in which case no, I haven't tried it yet.

it's a typo.  The 2.3 version was 2.3.11
the latest released 2.4 is 2.4.22 but the tar archives generally
just say 2.4 on them :-(

In any case, because the user id of the shutdown account is 0 this counts
as a root login and is only allowed on the devices listed in /etc/securetty,
so you just need to make sure this file only lists virtual consoles.

I built it a night or two ago (after being bitten by the bash 1.13
problems...) and it works fine - no big hassles as long as you modify the
config.sh from newspak properly...re: paths, etc.

the one on ftp.uu.net is actually 2.4.22 I think.
(i either got mine from there or wuarchive)
the latest version of elm is just called elm-2.4.tar.Z (or something similar)
 - the only mentioned of it being pl22 is if you look in one of the files
that mentions about patchlevels (can't remember the exact name).

In any case, it works fine now...

What exactly went went wrong ?

Andrew.

If your system pauses "for a couple of seconds" when it flushes the
cache to disk, you have a worse problem than lack of buffer cache. I
just have a wimpy 486-33 and while I can tell when it flushes the cache,
it causes at most a blip of my mouse movement (or a little jump of the
ball if I'm playing xboing).

   In the first place, I'm not required to improve anything until the day
   you start writing out my paychecks. Also, I think the advice is valid.

Hmmm...is anyone *requiring* that you do *anything* ? Obviously you're upset
about the example I used. The point of the post was *not* to *demand* that you
support *anything*. The only reason Slackware was mentioned at all was because
it was the topic of the original post...As far as the advice being valid, 
you're welcome to your opinion, but when a post requests help/info on how to
do something THAT *IS* SUPPORTED on the *existing* hardware, the answer IS
NOT "buy more hardware"...That response is typical of the "Microsoft" mindset,
"hey, lets just *require* everyone to buy more hardware to run our software..."

Do, you by chance work for Microsoft? 

   Should people with 286's start demanding Linux work for them? How about
   people with 720K floppies? Linux supports those drives too, you know.

Linux does not run on a 286 (obviously) because there are *major* differences
between the 286 and 386/486... class chips...perhaps Linux can boot from a
720K floppy, but its not large enough for any decent installation startup...
besides, by far the majority of people have 1.44MB 3.5" drives, not 720K.

My point was NOT about what Linux or Slackware or SLS or whatever supports, it
WAS about saying "buy more hardware" when it is NOT needed...if anything
using the "buy more hardware" response tends to make many newcomers think that
Linux/Slackware/SLS in fact does *not* support their exisiting hardware and
therefore they shouldn't even try to acquire/use it...

   Hey, time marches on, pal!

And a 1.2MB 5-1/4" floppy is configured as the boot floppy drive on the majority
of 386/486 machines sold today, so why *not* support what is a defacto standard?
And since it *is* supported, why even *suggest* it's not by telling someone to
"buy more hardware..."

Then that group has unrestricted root access, which may or may
not be better. A setuid shell script is a *major* security hole.
A former employer of mine didn't believe it until I provided
unassailable proof. Another risk was allowing users to have access
to the physical machine, complete with a bootable DOS partition with
a sector editor (part of the Norton Utilities) on it. Whoops.

What planet those thise statement come from ? I have just showed this to a 
friend of mine who is a OEM/VAR and I had to pick him up off the floor 
laughing, His figures state that less than one in one-hundred new machines
shipping today come with a 5.25 drive let alone come configured to boot off
one.

P.S. He is now just mailing the message to his mate in the PC business 
in the states for a good laugh.

This topic is getting out of hand. Patrick is justifiably upset that folks
are saying he has no 5.25 support for Slackware. Other people are screaming
for a complete 5.25 distribution. These are the facts.

1) Slackware is distributed as a series of DOS disks.
2) These disks are sized to fit 3.5 1.44M floppies.
3) Patrick has a 3.5 boot disk and a 5.25 boot/root combo disk.
4) Slackware has three distribution modes: Floppy, HD, and NFS.

Now these are the conditions in which Slackware cannot be installed. Note that
all of these must be true.

A) The machine does not have a 3.5" 1.44M floppy.
B) The machine does not have enough HD space to temporarily store the 
   distribution while it is being installed.
C) The machine has no NFS access.

Now exactly what percentage of machines qualify with first 3 criteria? The 
argument is that for this group that it's Patrick's problem to do item D and 
that all of the rest of the folks that does not qualify with criteria A-C
must go through the extra expense and hassle of formatting and copying to 10
extra diskettes.

Be aware that it doesn't take much disk space to store the distribution. The
whole thing is 40 Meg and it can be installed piecemeal (A, then X, etc.)
and each series takes less than 16M of temporary storage.

Think: Most linux machines need a swap partition. You can temporarily store
       parts of the distribution there while installing. When you're done
       the swap parition can then be set up and added to the system.

The bottom line is that Slackware has the facilities to be installed on a
large majority of the machines that it can be installed on. On the few machines
that fit criteria A-C Slackware can still be installed with some effort from
the user (By either hand shuffling the distribution or installing piecemeal).

My advise is that if you have a 5.25 only system with minimal HD space that
you look at another distribution (MCC or TAMU). Patrick goes out his way
to make sure that Slackware is reasonably correct and installs correctly
the first time over a variety of machines. He watches for bug reports and
quickly fixes bugs as he gets reports. He does a DAMN GOOD JOB! I'm tired of
hearing a vocal minority of users complain that their needs are not addressed
when they won't take the effort to see that Patrick went out of his way
to create a mechinism to load Slackware off a 5.25 boot floppy with 2 other
reasonable methods of accessing the distribution.

Lastly here are your options if you have 5.25 only:

1) Temporarily hook you machine to a network with NFS (This can even be a
   larger Linux box.) Use the NFS option.
2) Temporarily store the distribution on a local HD. Use the HD option.
3) Temporarily borrow a 1.44M floppy drive. You only need it for the 
   installation.
4) Shuffle the distribution yourself. Build a extra set of disks. Move
   the install.end and z*fix files to the last disk. 

If folks are unwilling to do any of the above then they are unwilling to
help themselves. Let them complain.

Later,

BAJ
