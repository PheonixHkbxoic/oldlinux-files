I just love the "technical" advice from people who *think* they are right but
never tested their theories.

I didn't test ALL  5.25" drives, so no comment.  


  2.  It is dangerous on all 5.25" drives.  It will cause your drive to
      go out of alignment sooner.

How is that? The only difference is 18 vs 15 sectors, so the gaps are smaller.
Not only the same number of TRACKS is used, but also the same density inside
the sector. I would be very interested to know how can a smaller gap (unused
space between sectors) affect the drive's alignment.

  3.  Standard 5.25HD/DS disks will normally still have a few bad sectors
      when formated this way.  (The boot disk can't have any errors!)

Again, I didn't test ALL  5.25" drives, but I never had bad sector this way.

   Hmm, I think the assumption here is that you'll be getting
slackware across the net, then writing it to floppies and doing
the disk install from that point.  If you're buying floppies from
someone else, then it's more of a point, but since it is possible
to do it, certainly you can look for a vendor who'll be willing
to load the installation onto 5.25" disks for you.

I am having problems in using cpio to run a remote backup.  When executed
locally on the Linux system, all works fine, but when I put the command in
a script, and run it from rsh command from another system, it does not
work, and I get an error 'cpio: write error'.  The same script and cpio
command ( find / -depth -print | cpio -oBc ) work on another Unix box.  Does
it have anything to do with lack of a controlling terminal when using rsh ?

Thanks,

Even after downloading the latest kernel and bootutils and sysvinit
I am still being told that root is unclean when booting up.

If I modify inittab and set up a single user mode then I find that
after the shutdown, all filesystems have been unmounted and root is
read only.

Why would root not be marked clean? Is there some vital instruction
that I am not issuing? I got the impression from the bootutils docs
that if root was read only then it would be marked clean.

Since, the dark ages of UNIX this file has been readable. Now, I do not
believe that something just because that`s the way its always been done.
Unfortunately, in this case there are many applications tha depend on
the accessibility of user account information by reading from this file.

There may be other reasons, but to suddenly have many applications stop
working if a strong motivater to me.

While bootb does indeed boot the b drive, the 3 1/2 inch boot disk appears
to have /dev/fd0 hardwritten into it. When it attempts to load the ramdisk,
it wants to access A:.

I'll just stick with the 5 1/4 test boot disks. They work for me.

/etc/passwd is misnamed: it contains most of the data pertaining to a user
account and not just the password.  For example, ls looks at /etc/passwd to
translate the pid of the file's owner to an account name for the ls -l
display.  If /etc/passwd were not world readable then any program that needs
to look at a field in the password file would have to have the necessary setuid
or sitgid privileges.  This would be a security hazard of itself (people have
exploited bugs in setuid-root programs to break into systems - the Internet
worm exploited such bugs - and the chances of a setuid/setgid program having
an exploitable bug rises as the number of setuid/setgid programs increases).

The shadow password technique allows the non-sensitive information about
user accounts to be world-readable while protecting the sensitive data (the
crypted password).

        I'm running SLS1.03 (0.99pl12 kernel) and am connected to our

        of the Net-2 code except that the local terminal servers keep

        trying to connect with my linux box and when they do they use

        the bootpd deamon to look for /etc/bootptab or look for /etc

        /in.timed (without the bootpd deamon). These files don't exist

        on my system and since I'm not sure what they do or look like

        I'm unable to create them. Also the reason I'm trying to solve

        this is when all of this occurs (about every few minutes) several

        log entries are made in /usr/log/notice and this file is accumu-

        lating about 40-50K every day. If someone could give me some

        info about these files along with the function of the bootpd

        deamon I would appreciate it. I have looked on some of the other

it's cpio rather than tar (which isn't a big thing) the important difference
and the one that's cogent to the discussion here is that each and every file

information.  Furthermore, the installation software knows to check actual

just won't work.

It's been a _long_ time since I did this, but this is the general idea:

1. Create the partition using OS/2 fdisk. This is important. Create a
DOS partition (primary or extended, it doesn't matter).

2. Install Linux, using Linux' fdisk to change the partition id to ext2.
Then, 'mke2fs', etc.

3. Install LILO v. 0.9 or 0.12, just use the QuickInst script to install
on the Linux partition.

4. Go back and use OS/2 fdisk to 'add to Boot Mgr menu'.

(You may need to do step 4 as part of step 1. I can't remember....)

The fact that you say this exposes the fact that you don't know why the
little one liner shell script is insecure.  The contents of the script
are not insecure.  The fact that the -i command invoking a script makes
the shell run as an interactive shell INSTEAD of executing the commands
in the shell script.  Again, this is regardless of the contents of the
script.

No it would not because this C program doesn't do anything with a -i
option.

Yes, but most versions of unix do not support secure setuid scripts, so
promoting them is a bad idea.  If your experience is limited to Linux
and then think it applies to the other versions of unix out there, you
might give very bad advice to people using most versions of unix.

As I said in an article I posted a minute ago, setuid scripts are
insecure not because of what you put in them.  They are insecure even
if they have no commands or just an echo statement.  This is because of
various behaviors of shells (not shell scripts).

For example, in most versions of unix, /bin/sh will execute your
.profile if it is invoked with a '-' as the first character of
argv[0].  So if a mortal user makes a symbolic link to a setuid shell
script with a name starting with '-', his .profile will run BEFORE the
shell even opens the setuid shell script.  It will run
.profile as root.  And any environment checking the setuid shell
script does will happen AFTER .profile gets run as root.  So the user
can put whatever destructive commands he wants in his
.profile.

Never mind that this is not a problem on some versions of unix.  It's a
big problem on many versions and ignoring this fact does not make it
less true.
