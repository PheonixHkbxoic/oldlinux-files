SLS version: 1.03
Machine1: NEC Powermate 386
Machine2: Amax PC/386

I've installed the SLS v.1.03 release on three machines.  The two
listed above had the same trouble after installing, making a
bootdisk, and trying to boot from that bootdisk.  The trouble that
came about was when I tried to boot from the bootdisk (5.25" floppy
drive A:).  Just after it prints out that it's trying to detect
sound cards (one of the machines has no sound cards and the other
has a PAS), it just sits there and never goes on.  Can anyone help
me get beyond this?  I've been booting from the install disk and
telling LILO to go to the harddisk where it's installed but I'd
really like to get the boot floppy to work.  The boot messages are
included at the bottom of this post.

The third machine that I installed on (an Insight 486 with a PAS16)
boots fine off of it's boot floppy.

Subject: Re: Long shadow passwords less secure than normal ones?
Date: Mon, 6 Sep 1993 18:28:40 GMT

The 16-character handling of the shadow password package seems suboptimal.
Though I think it is better than the standard Unix procedure which discards
everything but the first eight characters: At our place I cracked the passwords
of some users, and found they had used long words with some special
characters, but the first eight characters formed a simple word.
How could they know that their good passwords were silently truncated?

I think the best solution would be to XOR the characters past the eighth
character with the others, like this:

        ThisIsAV
        eryLongA
        ndGoodPa
        ssword
        -------- (XOR characters in the same column).
        XXXXXXXX (Crypt this value)

The XORed password would form a pretty random and difficult to guess
word. This would work with arbitrary long passwords, and it would be
compatible to systems that don't use this procedure as long as short
passwords are used.

Subject: SLS 1.03 and tcp/ip
Date: Mon, 6 Sep 1993 20:50:02 GMT

I just upgraded to SLS 1.03 and am having trouble
getting tcp/ip going. I am using an ne2000 clone board with IRQ=5 and
I/O memory at 0x300. It is detected fine on startup, and rc.net is being
run. I configured by editing the /etc/inet/hosts file and running
hostcvt.build. (In fact, I saved the hosts file from the earlier
release and tried it also.) Whenever I try to telnet out I get the 
message 

telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Network is unreachable

The same hosts file worked perfectly with the earlier SLS release (1.01,
I believe).

When I try to telnet in from another machine connection is made, and the
Linux console echos:

ARP: Bad packet received on device "eth0" !

I'm pretty sure the board is ok because it works fine with DOS.
I tried moving the board to IRQ 2, but it was detected on IRQ 9 at boot
and didn't work either.

Has something changed since with new release of SLS that I am missing?
Any help will be greatly appreciated!

How can I use other text modes in my VCs than only the standard
80x28 and 80x50? I have a Sigma legend 24LX which has an CL-GD5426
on it. The kernel source seems to support Cirrus modes like 100x
and 132x, but when I select ASK_VGA, it only displays me the
two simple modes mentioned above. Kernel version is 99pl12 with
Linus' patches. Any help or hint welcome.

I can't get lpd to work either - I have the same symptoms that Chris
has.  I type lpd and it just returns.  I have set all the permisions
as suggested (in addition to the setgid etc.  described in the
installation) and created the /usr/spool/lpd with 775, and it still
just returns.

The valid() function call in the the shadow lib, although the version which
came with SLS 1.02 had an error in the makefile which caused valid.o NOT to
be included in libshadow.a.  The recent posting of the shadow suite to
comp.sources.misc (or was is c.s.unix ? I don't recall) did not have this
problem.

I've got all the nifty groff stuff that came with the SLS-1.03, but it
doesn't seem to include a directory needed by "groff" to produce PostScript
output.  The error I get is:

        gtroff: can't open `DESC'
        gtroff: fatal error: sorry, I can't continue

I looked around with "find" and have deduced that I need a directory called
"/usr/lib/groff/font/ps" (which would contain the file DESC, among others).

So, where do I find this directory?  (...and why wasn't it included in SLS?)

This is a Bad Thing.  xor is a linear transformation - all you'll be doing 
is flipping bits in some predetermined manner (eg if you map 16 -> 8 chars 
by xoring then you'll end up clearing the high bits which the two lots of 
chars will have in common).  Since people will use standard phrases rather 
than `P8;!KL,2P,)!PL)"PD'%@<(!@4&!P8%-@<6%PL*!@@*"P4&%00&%P4*"`4&' as long 
passwords, it will allow you to perform a frequency analysis of the language 
in use and determine the most common bit patterns which will result from 
this xor-ing.  The longer the password, the closer the statistical analysis 
will be to the real text.  You can then use the probable bit-patterns to 
mount an attack.  This may even be easier than an attack on the standard 
password system.
 
I'll repeat again what I said in a previous message, if you're going to make 
an incompatible change you may as well use a secure algorithm like MD5 or 
SHS to do it.
 
Peter.
