                 Welcome to the comp.os.linux.* hierarchy!

Background
=========================================================================
        This posting is an introduction to the comp.os.linux.* hierarchy 
        of USENET newsgroups. 

        Linux is a free implementation of UNIX for 80386/80486 machines 
        covered by the GNU GPL. Most of the development of the Linux 
        kernel has been done by Linus Torvalds, an internationally 
        reknowned UNIX wizard from Helsinki, Finland.

        For the past two years or so, the newsgroup comp.os.linux has 
        grown be one of the most popular groups on USENET. Late in 1992, 
        a CFV for splitting comp.os.linux was posted; the only group which 
        passed was comp.os.linux.announce, a moderated newsgroup for Linux 
        announcements and patches.

        Six months later, during the summer of 1993, another CFV for 
        splitting comp.os.linux was posted. The voting period for the 
        comp.os.linux reorganization results ended at 23:59:59 UTC on 
        4 August 1993 (4:59PM US Pacific Time, 7:59PM US Eastern Time.) 
        The results are as follows:

        comp.os.linux reorganization results - 1842 votes

         Yes   No  : 2/3? >100? : Pass? : Group
         ---- ---- : ---- ----- : ----- : -------------------------------
         1692  135 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.admin
         1741   90 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.development
         1647  177 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.help
         1660  155 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.misc


        Because of this split, the newsgroup comp.os.linux will be 
        deleted on 11 November 1993. The new newsgroups will be created 
        on 11 August 1993. This posting describes these newsgroups, 
        including comp.os.linux.announce, which will remain entact.


General Policy
=========================================================================
        The general policy for the Linux newsgroups is simple. Who sets
        the policy? We all do. All of us on USENET are interested in
        communicating openly about a number of topics. That's why we
        have USENET. If you want the Linux newsgroups to work for you,
        a few suggestions:

        * Read the Linux FAQ and follow the newsgroups for some time 
          before posting questions. This is very important. comp.os.linux 
          suffered from HUGE amounts of noise and traffic because much 
          of the growing readership never bothered to READ the newsgroup;
          they only posted questions.
          
          The same thing will happen with the new newsgroups unless you 
          read the FAQ (found on sunsite.unc.edu in the file 
          pub/Linux/docs/FAQ) and read the newsgroup for some time before 
          posting questions. Chances are, your question has already been
          recently answered, and a simple browsing of the newsgroup
          will answer it. We suggest using a threaded newsreader such as
          "trn" which will allow you to browse and mark articles by 
          subject, so you don't have to read each and every article in
          each newsgroup.

        * Crossposting between the Linux newsgroups is STRONGLY 
          discouraged. If you do crosspost questions between Linux 
          newsgroups, expect to be flamed to oblivion. The reason we
          have a newsgroup split is to categorize discussions into 
          separate newsgroups. Crossposting negates this effect. 
          If your posting cannot fit into ONE of the newsgroups
          c.o.l.admin, c.o.l.help, or c.o.l.development, then you 
          should post it to c.o.l.misc. 

          The one exception is for announcements. Occasionally, an
          important announcement (such as this one) will be crossposted
          between c.o.l.announce and one or more of the other c.o.l.*
          groups. These announcements must be approved by the .announce
          moderator; see below.

        * Reply to questions via e-mail if at all possible. While 
          discussion in the newsgroups is encouraged, if someone is
          asking a simple question to which the answer is well-known,
          there is no reason to post the reply. Don't assume that 
          the person posting the question actually reads the newsgroup
          or will even note your followup if they do. Reply via e-mail
          unless the reply is of general interest. 

        * Don't flame newbies. Over the course of the past few months,
          the Linux community has developed an oversensitive ego and
          a reputation for being unfriendly towards newcomers, mostly
          because of unwarranted flaming by a handful of righteous 
          individuals. If someone posts, saying, "Hi! I'm new to
          this group! What is Linux?" (which will inevitably happen
          as the new newsgroups are propagated), DO NOT FLAME THEM.
          When someone sees a new newsgroup pop up within "rn", they
          are justifiably curious about the new group and probably
          don't know that well over 80,000 people who know EVERYTHING
          about Linux read the group. Right? 

          Instead of being rude, you can send a polite note to the
          poster, saying, "Hello, Linux is a free implementation of
          UNIX for the 386 and 486. You can get the FAQ from 
          sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/docs. Let me know if I can
          be of help!". That's all. Not difficult, eh? You can even
          save your stock reply in a file and simply send form-letters
          to newbies if you wish. But there is very little point in
          flaming or ever being rude. It goes against everything that
          Linux can and should be. 

          Just remember that nobody knows everything---not even Linus---
          and that you were a newbie once, too. :)


comp.os.linux.announce
=========================================================================
        Comp.os.linux.announce is a moderated newsgroup for Linux 
        announcements and source patches. The purpose of this group was
        to get all of the ``important'' Linux information out of the
        regular newsgroup and into a place where all Linux users could see
        the important announcements without having to wade through a 
        jungle of other postings. So far, this group has been very 
        successful. 

        The moderators for this group are myself (Matt Welsh, 
        mdw@tc.cornell.edu) and Lars Wirzenius (wirzeniu@cc.helsinki.fi). 
        We will be sharing the moderator duty, and backing each other up 
        to make sure that postings to this group will be approved as soon 
        as possible after they're submitted.

        Submissions to this group should be mailed to the address:
                linux-announce@tc.cornell.edu

        If you have any problems or questions about c.o.l.announce, please 
        send mail to the moderators at
                linux-announce-request@tc.cornell.edu
        Or simply mail us directly. This is not a request address for 
        mailing list subscription; see below.

        A separate posting details the guidelines for submitting to this 
        group.  I plan to approve just about anything that's posted to this 
        group, except for questions or discussions about Linux. So, please, 
        post away.  :)

        There are also archives of comp.os.linux.announce available at a 
        number of Linux FTP sites: check 
                sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/linux-announce.archive

        There is a mailing list mirror of the comp.os.linux.announce 
        newsgroup; to join, send mail to
                linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi
        With the line
                X-Mn-Admin: join ANNOUNCE
        at the top of the body (not in the subject). Approved postings to 
        c.o.l.announce will automatically be mailed to this mailing list 
        channel.


comp.os.linux.admin     
=========================================================================
        This newsgroup was created simply to thwart the unique newsgroup
        acronym "c.o.l.a", previously used by c.o.l.announce. However,
        this newsgroup is also used for discussions and questions about
        running Linux systems, either in a single-user or multi-user
        environment.

        Clearly, there is no large distinction between c.o.l.admin and
        c.o.l.help. However, .admin should be mostly used for discussions
        about RUNNING Linux, not USING or PROGRAMMING it. Unfortunately,
        especially with Linux, the line between system administrator and
        system user is very fuzzy. In short, we anticipate c.o.l.admin
        to be mostly about questions with installing, setting up, and
        configuring Linux systems, as well as other discussions relating
        to system administration. 


comp.os.linux.development
=========================================================================
        c.o.l.development, or "c.o.l.d" for short, is a newsgroup for 
        questions and discussions about Linux kernel and systems-level 
        development. Please note that this is a newsgroup about 
        development OF Linux, not development FOR Linux. In other words, 
        c.o.l.d isn't for questions about programming or porting software 
        to Linux. Instead, this is a newsgroup for discussions about 
        developing the Linux kernel itself, including writing device 
        drivers, adding new features, and so on. In addition, discussions
        about development of shared libraries, and other essential 
        systems-level projects, are welcome here. 

        Hopefully, this newsgroup will embody some of the content and
        scope of the linux-activists mailing list channels such as GCC, 
        KERNEL, SCSI, and NET.


comp.os.linux.help
=========================================================================
        Comp.os.linux.help is perhaps the most general of Linux 
        newsgroups. It is for any general user, programming, or 
        setup questions and discussion about Linux. If your question
        is about Linux development, post to c.o.l.development. If
        it is about system administration, post to c.o.l.admin. 
        However, if your question is of a more general nature, such
        as "How do I set up Linux for use with an NE2000 card?",
        c.o.l.help is your place. 

        Remember that you should not crosspost between .help and
        other Linux newsgroups. This means that if you are asking for
        help in .development, that's fine, but .help is for those
        questions which don't fit into .admin and .development.


comp.os.linux.misc
=========================================================================
        This group is the canonical ``catch-all'' for discussions and 
        questions which don't fit into the other Linux newsgroups.
        While c.o.l.help is generally for questions, c.o.l.misc is for
        discussions of a general nature about Linux, such as setting up
        a file hierarchy standard, questions about Linus' personal life
        and virtual beer, and the inevitable flame war. Again, it should 
        be noted that crossposting between c.o.l.misc and other Linux 
        newsgroups is strongly discouraged. If your posting or question 
        does not fit into ONLY ONE of the other Linux newsgroups, post 
        it to .misc.


Comments
=========================================================================
        If you have questions or comments about this document, please
        direct them to mdw@tc.cornell.edu. Flames to /dev/null; cheques
        and money orders to Linus Torvalds. Thanks.

The shadow passwd is there for security reasons.  If the encrypted passwords
are in the passwd file, anyone with access to your system can copy them and
run the publicly available crack program on them, and chances are they'll
crack quite a few.  By shadowing the passwords, non-priviledged users simply
cannot get access to the encrypted passwords.

I don't know if the older version used in SLS supports it, but version
3.3 of the shadow password suite was just released a few days ago and
it allows useradd to be compiled without shadow support.

Subject: Linux standard for system UID/GIDs ??
Date: 15 Aug 1993 17:42:37 GMT

I looked through the linux-standards, but I couldn't find any references for
a standard list of UIDs and GIDs that a linux box should have.  Obvsiouly,
root is UID=0 and GID=0, but what about other "standard" users and groups
such as bin, daemon, sys, etc...?  It seems like it would be a good idea for
everyone to be using roughly the same scheme for these things.

This is included in the bootutils package. It looks about like this:
(fsck -A looks in /etc/fstab what type the filesystem is and wether to
run e2fsck, xfsck etc.)

# Check the integrity of all filesystems
/etc/fsck -A -a

# If there was a failure, drop into single-user mode.

Subject: cron listed as /USR/BIN/CRON ???
Date: Sun, 15 Aug 1993 20:18:53 GMT

Running pl10, on startup when I have the cron daemon enabled in
my /etc/inittab, I will get an entry that looks like:

  PID TT STAT  TIME COMMAND
    1  ? S     0:00 init
   50  ? S     0:00 /usr/bin/crond
   51  ? S     0:00 /USR/BIN/CROND

Why is the entry for PID 51 there?  I can kill it and it will go
away.  For an experiment, I restarted the machine and left it
there.  I see no ill side effects, just that it does not look
right.

Why is this happening, and does it cause problems?

Subject: LILO like DOS executable Loader?
Date: Sun, 15 Aug 1993 20:26:36 GMT

Has anyone considered putting together a DOS-based loader
that would allow you to link the zImage file into a
DOS executable so that you could launch Linux from DOS?

I use DOS for QMODEM so I can call out to other BBS type
systems and download files.  I then reboot to Linux and
mount the DOS partition and copy the files into Linux
directory space.

Wouldn't it be neat if you could simply launch linux
by typing in a DOS command line?  Save the trouble of
rebooting every time?

Better yet, is there a version of minicom or something that
works without having to reset the screen each time it
scrolls off?  I would rather not deal with DOS if at all possible.

The advantage of shadow passwords is fairly simple .. if you can't physically
see the passwords it's awfully hard to just simply run those characters 
through a decrypter ...

There are other advantages too ... but someone with a lot more experience
could probably explain it a little better.

        There is a "bootlin" program that can be used from a config.sys
file to boot linux, allowing you to set a linux boot option from
a multi-config.sys package.

        Back before getting a slip connection, I found kermit inside
an xterm to be quite usable for this task.  Setting the modem to
ignore DTR, I could even do zmodem transfers by loading sz on the unix
side (I dialed into my network accessable unix account, rather than a
BBS, but that's irrelevant), closing kermit locally, and loading rz <
/dev/ttys0 > /dev/ttys0.  Inside the xterm, I got scrollback with the
scrollbars, cut-and-paste, and real vt100 emulation.  Basically the only
comm program feature you're missing is a dialing directory, but that's
simple to fix.  Keep a list of your phone numbers in a text file, and grab
one with the mouse, and paste it over into the modem :)


        I must say though, that I much prefer the slip connection :)

This all sounds like a bad idea. Let try to figure out a way to keep
DOS out of this.

Kermit has a phone directory. It also has a script language so yet can
pick and choose who you want to dial. Here is my kermit .phonedir:

gatech T853-0874 38400 none
gatech44 T853-0844 38400 none
 
The fields are name, number, baudrate and parity respectivly.
once in kermit The use the dial command to dial a number. You can even
put a script in .kermrc that is automatically executed every time you
run kermit. Mine sets up some parameters, dials, logs me in, runs
term both remotely and locally, and dumps me right back at a prompt. From here 
I can use term to do whatever I want. I don't even bother to exit kermit just
push a shell to work from. When I'm done the script picks up where it left off
by bringing down the remote term, logging me out, and hanging up the phone.

It doesn't get much easier than that.

If we're going to fire up one os from another let's make sure we do it
the other way around. I'll bet DOSEMU can run your terminal program. 
But kermit, minicom, and seyon can all do the job.

Later,

Subject: Where to get the Linux FAQ (PLEASE READ)

NEW USERS: WHERE TO GET THE LINUX FAQ (please read)

PLEASE: EVERYONE read the FAQ for this group before posting questions. Many 
people (myself included) worked hard to produce the FAQ to accurately answer 
all of your questions. The new version of the FAQ (with many updates, 
clarifications, etc.) will only come out every month! So you won't see it 
posted that often. In the meantime you'll have to get it in one of the
following ways:

1)  ftp to tsx-11.mit.edu. It's the directory /pub/linux/docs/FAQ. 
    It's split up into 5 files: the table of contents and the four parts of
    the FAQ itself. Each part is about 50K.

or  ftp to sunsite.unc.edu. It's the file /pub/Linux/docs/FAQ. This is one
    big ASCII file containing the entire FAQ (about 200K).

or  ftp to any news.answers archive site. For example, you can find 
    Linux-related postings from news.answers in the directory
    /usenet/comp.os.linux and /usenet/comp.os.linux.announce on ftp.uu.net.

2)  If you don't have FTP access, you can retrieve it via the mailserver at
    rtfm.mit.edu. Send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the word "help" 
    in the body.
or  If you simply can't find the FAQ, I will mail it to you myself. Just
    send me mail (mdw@tc.cornell.edu).

3)  The most recent FAQ will be posted to comp.os.linux, comp.os.linux.announce,
    and news.answers every month (if you want to wait...).

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: Read the "Meta-FAQ" posted weekly to c.o.l.a (also
available from the various FTP sites). It gives you all of the pointers on 
where to look for Linux information.

Thanks.

Subject: stale LCK file after uucp session
Date: Sun, 15 Aug 1993 23:59:43 GMT


I have a remote site that calls my machine for e-mail delivery.

I never call this machine.

However, uucico leaves a stale LCK file for this machine, even when
the session is over.

I'm running Slackware v1.01 with uucp1.04 binaries.


Thanks for any info!

Subject: NFS mount fails with authentication error
Date: Mon, 16 Aug 1993 01:15:03 GMT

I'm a new user of Linux, so please bear with me if this is a FAQ.
(Couldn't find anything about it in the NET-2 FAQ though...)

I'm trying to network SLS 1.03 with a couple of HP workstations.
I can't get Linux to NFS-mount the workstations' filesystems;
it fails with this message:

rpc mount: RPC: Authentication error; why = Invalid client credential

Everything else I've tried works great, including mounting the Linux
machine's filesystems via NFS on the workstations.  I can invoke other
RPC-based servers like rstat without problems.  The two workstations
can NFS-mount each other, and yes I have the Linux machine added to
/etc/hosts, /etc/hosts.equiv, and /etc/exports.

It's possible that this is an HP bug, but I see the same results with
machines running both HPUX 7.0 and HPUX 8.0.  Seems more likely that
Linux is failing to adhere to the RPC authentication protocol.  Or
perhaps there is a configuration file I haven't set up correctly?

Any info gratefully accepted ...

                        thanks, tom lane

        /USR/BIN/CROND signifies an active cron event.  When crond
notices that it's time to do something, it spawns a new process to
execute it.  I would assume that PID 51 should go away after a while,
if it doesn't, maybe the process would be better invoked from 
/etc/rc rather than cron.

If you have a machine that will have at least one user who does not
also have root, then it will increase your security.

The file /etc/passwd contains the encrypted passwords for everybody on
the system.  It also contains useful information about all the users,
like uid, names, home directory, etc.  You want to keep the former
secure to prevent dictionary attacks.  The latter is generally
considered public information (to the sytem at least) and need to be
readable by finger, ps, ls, most shells and any other program that
needs to know about users in general (like expanding ~bob, for
example).

What shadow does is to separate out the public stuff from the private
stuff.  So, the encrypted passwords go into a file that only root (or
a certain group, in some implementations) can read, while the rest of
the stuff goes into a file that everybody can read.  The passwords are
kept in /etc/shadow (this varies from os to os), while the public
information is still in /etc/passwd.  Most programs that need it can
get to it.

There is at least one bug in the shadow password stuff that will make
your system LESS secure if you use it.  When a user has a password in
the shadow file, the password entry in the /etc/passwd file is null
(rather than "*" or somethine else like in other implementations).
Certain programs that haven't been hacked to use Linux's shadow
commands will assume that a user (say root) can go ahead and log in
w/o a password.  Programs to watch out for are rshd, ftpd or any other
that asks for a user name and password.  I think ftpd has been fixed,
but I don't know if rshd has yet or not.  The shadow that is on SLS
1.03 definitely behaves like this (I just tried it), so be careful out
there.

This will likely bite you if you are trying to port software to linux.
It is a severe bug in the shadow implementation, since it does not
work with "prior art" very well.
