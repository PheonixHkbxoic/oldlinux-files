What do they have to do with each other?
Anyway, 360k disks are certified one-sided. If the second side works as
well, this is not so very much surprising, since it has the same surface,
just not certified. So the leap really is 720k to 800k, which is
just 11% more. From 1.2 to 1.44 is 20% more. The main problem here is
supposedly not as much the media, but the precision of the drive's
speed. If the inter-record gaps are so small, it might easily happen
that
a) The sectors do not always fit on one revolution (formatting fails)
b) Writing one sector will affect the header of the next. This is
   pretty bad, since it leads to bad sectors which can not even be
   checked for with verify, since the sectors going bad are not the ones
   being written.

Note again, the limits are *not* the quality of the media, but the
drive's speed. If, as one poster wrote, the disks are getting worse
and worse, then obviously the gaps are too small, definitely!

Storing data on such disks is playing with fire. You might use it to send
software to someone, but not before verifying the whole disk in one
procedure, and write-protecting it. A write in another drive is
certain to destroy it if the other drive's speed is just marginally
higher.

Subject: NFS performance
Date: 8 Oct 1993 07:29:11 GMT

Has anyone had success improving the NFS performance by tweaking
parameters in /etc/fstab (or elsewhere)?  I have excellent file-transfer
rates (Linux to Sparc and vice versa) via ftp, but unusably slow
NFS performance (>10 sec to do 'ls' on a small directory, not to
mention copying).  Sparc-to-Sparc NFS links on the same network
work very well, so I suspect the Linux machine.

Anybody have any experience/ideas?

Thanks in advance,

Yes, that would also ease porting it (I already think of porting it to our SUNs,
- as most of the functionality probably isn't Linux-specific -
though not a single line of code has been written ;-) ).
And usually noone owns the "commercial" OI/UIB.

The best way to do this.
Though UIB is quite simple too use, doing subclassing needs further
documentation than supplied on-line (at least I had some problems).
So "C" programmers can supply functions code without working into OI.

Yes. There's too much functionality needed than a single programmer can supply.

Hello Fellow Slip Users:

I am having the following problem when I attempt to login after getting
attached to my local SLIP server from my Linux box running 0.99 pl12.  

I can attach fine and ping works perfect.  I can even telnet to machines
via our router, but I cannot get past the password prompt.  I get the 
login prompt - I enter my login, then the password prompt - I enter my
password, then I wait and wait and wait ... forever!  I CAN anonymous ftp
without a problem, but an ftp which needs a password also hangs.  Argh!

Has anyone seen this problem?  Thanks in advance for any help.

Mhm, now that I read just another load of follow-ups, I think it would be 
good to create a language as someone proposed.

This would describe screens, and actions, acting on curses and X in the
same script...

The advantage is clear: many users can contribute their configuration-
scripts and do not have to bother to much with the userinterface.

Only - this I think I cannot do - it is to big a task. 

If someone can do such a great thing, I think I would retreat to using
the language creating some scripts - if not, I think we should stick
to the OI/uib-stuff.
While xview is nice, I think OI is much more real
ObjectOriented - and it is more easy to provide two userinterfaces
using the same functionalitycode with true objects...

root is in more than 8 groups. The old NFS spec didnt permit this. Take
root from a few groups and it will be fine.

   This is for Linux, but these things are fairly standard.  The problems
I have with this definition are:

1) Using the left arrow erases the characters on the screen, yet, if I do
a screen refresh, they are printed back.  (They are not erased in the
documented, a space just seems to be printed over it.)

2) My reverse (or so it seems to be) is not continuous.  Spaces between
the words are black.  Another example is the hanoi shipping with the 
ncurses package; it doesn't print the rings.  (Though I figured this
might be a color problem since the program is trying to use different
colors for each ring.)

   Is there anyone that can find out what might be wrong with the above
entry?  It is possible that Linux' curses be broken...

Subject: Anybody used an ISA memory card with Linux?
Date: Thu, 7 Oct 1993 21:33:38 GMT

        I have tried with absolutely no success to use an Everex 159
memory card with Linux. I got all kinds of Memory Fault errors, although
I could use the card with DOS with no problem. I had Checkit test the
board for a pair of hours with no errors... so at least it is not its
fault I guess.

        Anyway, I read about the Speed path for memory refresh times,
and thought maybe I could change some value in my kernel to sacrifice
some speed for RAM.

        Can anybody elaborate a little bit on this? I have not enough
knowledge in PC hardware to know what I'm doing in this area.

        Thanks for any answer...

Hm, I was convinced that I made a stupid beginner's mistake, but maybe
for once it is NOT me. 

My boot disk made by SLS does not work, either. I just installed the
last version of SLS ("0.99.12 #6 from August 10") and my boot floppy
(made at the end of the installation menu) stops right after saying

"Press <Return> to see SVGA modes available, <SPACE> to continue or
wait 30 secs

I waited for a LONG time (several minutes) but nothing happened.

I also tried to make a boot disk by the method described in the
"Installation Guide" book (great book, btw!), but this did not work,
either. For the record, I did the following (being root in /):

rdev zImage /dev/hda2            # ( I have a zImage in / )
mke2fs /dev/fd0 1440
mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /floppy   # I created a directory /floppy previously,
cp /zImage /dev/fd0              # although it does not seem to be used here
unmount /dev/fd0

This stopped with

Uncompressing Linux...

invalid compressed format

 -- System halted

I can boot the system by using the a1.3 disk, then booting in LILO
from /dev/hda2.

Can anybody tell me how I can make a floppy on which I can boot?

Thanks a lot!

Doesn't it set all of these mailboxes to group "mail"?

Unless Smail is using the user's groups (which it shouldn't) there's no
problem with rw-rw----.
