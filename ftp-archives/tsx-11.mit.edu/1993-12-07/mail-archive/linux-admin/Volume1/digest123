Dear Linuxer,
   Where can I find the binary code of xmosaic 1.2 for linux? All I can get are
the source files from ncsa ftp server. Since I don't have motif, I cannot do 
anything about it. I was able to get the binary code of xmosaic 1.1 by using
archie though.

Thanks in advance.

        I typically use i386-unknown-linux, when compiling gnu software
that wants such a flag, since it's what I saw on the first gcc binary
I downloaded.  <shrug>.  Doesn't make much difference, really.

Date: Sat, 23 Oct 1993 13:49:18 GMT

Trying to hook a Seagate ST2383N SCSI drive up to Seagate ST02
V3.2, 386DX-40, Kernel .99pl13

Under DOS, scsi drive is 323 Meg, quite usable, works fine.
Under Linux, scsi drive is not even seen.

Using a ST157N 48 Meg drive in place of the ST2383N for a linux
boot works, linux sees the ST157N drive but not the other.

DOS sees it, fdisks and formats fine. Linux can't see it.

Any clues?

Farly easy (for me at least to begin with) First, recompile your kernel with
XT harddrive support enabled (see make config). Since your card doesn't
appear to be directly supported (according to linux/kernel/blk_drv/xd.c,
supported cards are DTC 5150x, WD 1004A27X and ST11M/R) you will have to
define XD_OVERRIDE in linux/include/linux/xd,h and modify
linux/kernel/blk_drv/xd.c line 55  -change xd_override_init... to
xd_wd1004a27x_init... (see the readme stuff in the same file about same
manufacturers..)
You will probably have to change the irq of your 14.4 internal modem since
the XT used irq5 for the fixed disk - maybe your card is configurable though.
If so you will have to change line ~512 of xd.c, xd_irq = 5, appropriately.
Probably easier to move the modem irq.
If you get it going you should get a couple of lines when you boot about
override and attempts to get disk geometry. If it succeeds, try mounting
/dev/xda1 somewhere and see. If it doesn't, try using the xd_override_init...
routines instead of the xd_wd1004a27x_init... routines - but that didn't
work for me.

My problem is I can only get the card I have (a DTC5150X) to talk to the
20Mb drive it was supplied with and none of my other, larger MFM drives - but
that is not linux's problem I don't think. Msdog doesn't like it either.
I suspect it could be a card bios problem. Oh, and my machine then doesn't
like talking to the 2nd drive on the secondary AT controller I have - really
weird stuff happening there. I have no idea about that at all :-<
Good luck with it,

Subject: NTP / XNTP ?
Date: 23 Oct 1993 14:43:13 GMT

hi there. I'm trying to get either ntp or xntp to compile.

XNTP 3.1 is dying not being able to find FASYNC and FNDELAY

XNTP 3.3 (which apparently has some linux support built in) is dying
        with undefined symbols (_adjtimex in xntpd/nyp_loopfilter.0
        and _adjtime in lib/systime.o) These symbols seem to be defined
        in include fiels in /usr/include/sys and /usr/include/protocols.

has anyone succesfully compiled xntp 3.x? I assume 3.3 is doable, since
the config file is there, and up to the linking of xntpd, the compile
goes ahead rather cleanly.

Any help or a pointer to a more appproriate forum will be greatly appreciated.

I am not talking about root privileges on the NFS mounted partition.

Let's say I am mounting /var/spool/mail.  And someone on another
machine is mounting it also.  If the user on the other machine has a
uid of 12345, I could create the same uid (12345), and do what I want
with the mail for uid 12345 from the login on my machine (not the root
login).

Ok, the story is this. It works because Torsten Duwe and I did the
port from a previuos port made by Philipp Gladstone (thanks!). There
are just a few minor things left over. First of all use xntp3.3a.tar.Z
as base. Additionally you need patch level 13(something > g i believe) or
wait until pl13 comes out officially. Then the only problem left (sorry for that)
is the the distribution contains a file include/sys/timex.h which must be
removed (or re-named) for Linux. This naming conflict stems from the way
adjtime() is supported already (with pl13) in Linux and is not yet supported
by all other OS around out there (remember xntp has been ported to quite a few
Unix versions). I hope that this issue can be cleared up in the future. Things
tend to get more complicated the more parties are involved in it (Base line code
production, porting to >>10 platforms, vendors, OS bugs, ...).

The good news is: I seems to be working pretty good. Our machine (usually
lighly loaded) stays within +-300us of our precision time servers on the
same network (<< +- 30us).
Unfortunately we have been sometimes observing some lost interrupts resulting in
jumps around 10-80ms. We have not found the reson for that. It seems that
sometimes something still goes amiss - maybe somebody can discover the culprit
for lost interrupts.

Hi, 

Can someone give me any information on this file? Each time I run
e2fsck at bootup, I get an error about the size of this file (i-node).
This is automatically 'corrected' by e2fsck, always increasing the
size of the file. Is this the way this should work?

Thanks,

Before you make yourself crazy on this - almost all SCSI disks self-park
when the power is shut off.  I've only seen a few that don't do this.
