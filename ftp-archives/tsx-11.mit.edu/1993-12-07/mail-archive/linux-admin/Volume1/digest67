But shouldn't that be solved by a small utility BOOTB.ZIP which had been 
included in very early SLS versions, and which is still available from e.g.

After running "pkgtool" on the T-series disks on everything EXCEPT texbin,

   But you don't get the stuff onto one 5 1/4" floppy.
   Buy a 3 1/2" floppy and everything will be fine ...
 
Not to rag on Andreas in particular, but
 "Buy a 3 1/2 floppy and everything will be fine ..." 
is about as worthless bit of advice as I've heard in a long time...

Look at it this way...the original post was about not being able to boot
Slackware from a 5-1/4" floopy...Linux supports 5-1/4" floppy, other distributions
boot from the 5-1/4, so how do you get Slackware to boot from a 5-1/4" floppy
(i.e. READ: "Hey Slackware maintainer, how about a 5-1/4" boot disk...")

Suggesting someone buy hardware is not the answer to the problem...
In the majority of cases, if the person *could* purchase the hardware,
they *would* purchase the hardware. But unfortunately many of us live
in the real world and have to worry about things like food, rent, heat,
transportation, insurance, spouses, kids,.... need I go on? There are
probably *many* things that have a higher priority  than shelling out
$75 (US) on a 3-1/2 in floppy drive...(hey, if I had extra money, do 
you think I'd be running Linux on a 386-33DX  with 4MB and a CGA 
monitor ?  I would *love* to have a SVGA card and monitor and 8MB
so I can run X at home, but other things come first...

"How do you get X to run in 4MB ?" the answer is *NOT* "get 8MB" 
(unless of course you'd care to contribute to the cause :-)

Again, I'm not flaming Andreas, I just suggesting that instead of
immediately suggesting "go buy more hardware" the person responding
to a post should try to come up with a solution that *doesn't* involve
the expenditure of cash...

The problem lies in the fact that swapfiles must be on a *local* partition
because the kernel uses a mapping from file to physical blocks and then
uses the block device to access those blocks. In case of an NFS mounted
filesystem this does not work (we don't have a block device for it).

I'm working on a solution that uses the VFS layer to access the swapfile.
It is working, but I still need to do some stress-testing to make sure
that all the hacks I made actually work. The main problem is that when
swapping you can't really allocate memory (as this may cause a need to
do some extra swapping). I made a dirty hack to support this anyway but
I need to test some more....

                                                        Paul.

Look, I ignored it the first time, but now you've gone and posted for
the second time that I need to support a 5 1/4 boot disk, when at the
time of both posts you'd have seen that I *do*, if you'd bothered to go

In the first place, I'm not required to improve anything until the day
you start writing out my paychecks. Also, I think the advice is valid.
Should people with 286's start demanding Linux work for them? How about
people with 720K floppies? Linux supports those drives too, you know.

Hey, time marches on, pal!

Finally, if anyone had bothered to check ftp.cdrom.com, they'd have seen
that the Slackware distribution does support a 5.25" boot disk. It even
did at the time that the lack of that feature was first falsely reported
in this thread.

Hi All,

Originally, I posted this article in c.o.l.misc, but I didn't get any answers.
So I'm giving it another try in c.o.l.help and c.o.l.admin.

I'm looking for recent benchmarking programs to compare overall performance 
of Linux, HP-UX and SunOS on different HW-platforms. Anyone know of such 
programs + where I can get it? Preferably benchmarks that includes X 
performance as well.

Please respond via e-mail.
I will post a summary of all the programs and their location (if I get
response of course, which was not the case with my first try).

Thanx,

Jorre

Under normal circumstances this is perfectly true.  However I just installed
dx2/66 16Mb RAM local-bus IDE 0.5Mb cache.  Now it is VERY annoying every
so often to find the machine pausing for a couple of seconds just to flush
this cache to disk when the program memory requirement grows by a Mb or so.
Here a hardware cache *is* beneficial.  (the 0.5Mb is essentially non
existent because of its relatively small size)

Well, just a viewpoint.  This subject has been killed lots of times before,
but just having DONE a top-rate setup that has this problem I know that my
next system will have at least 2Mb disk cache.

Is there a way to have MCOPY copy the file and give permission to the
person who copied it instead of root?  (I haven't checked yet to see if
it uses root's current umask).

Copying files TO floppy doesn't matter, but copying FROM floppy sets
the file perms to root-only.  I suppose I can write a front end script 
to do this, but I'm trying to avoid this situation :-)

My standard way of allowing anyone to shut down is to have a *user*
called "shutdown", with UID = 0 and no password.  "shutdown"'s login
shell is, of course, a script that contains

        #!/bin/bash
        /etc/shutdown -f now

One shuts down by logging in as "shutdown".

There's another user called "reboot" that has "-rf" in place of "-f".

Both these users have a home directory, /home/etc, which is writable
only by root, so nobody can mess with their .profile, and to give them
a suitable environment for starting up via "xdm".

Works great!

You can easily use 1.44MB floppies if you only have a 5 1/4" drive.
Use the popular FDRORM18.ZIP package.  With it you format your 1.2MB
floppies as 1.44MB.  Then adjust the CMOS setup to tell it your 1.2
drive is a 1.44.  Then Linux will work with your 1.44 MB 5 1/4"
floppies.   I didn't try this, but I told a friend with this problem
to do this, and he reported back to me that it works fine.  So there
is no reason to have 1.2 MB versions.
 
Don't forget to set interleave 2:1 if you format with CMOS set
"wrong".  Also you have to tell FDFORMAT the disk size you want
and interleave to use since your CMOS is lying to programs in
this setup.  It will only matter to formatting type programs.
