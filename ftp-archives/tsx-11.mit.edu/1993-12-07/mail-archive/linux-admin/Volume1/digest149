A good place for questions like that is 'comp.editors' where you

Subject: termcap entry for "IBM-3278-2"?
Date: 10 Nov 1993 07:12:51 GMT

I run a Linux box on the net.  A friend of mine has net access through
a CMS system on an IBM mainframe <shudder!>.  When he telnets in,
telnetd negotiates with his end and sets the TERM vaiable to
"IBM-3278-2".  This causes some problems, as he wants to run some
programs which require proper screen usage, and most have no clue how
to use his terminal because my termcap has no entry for "IBM-3278-2".

Does anyone have a termcap entry for this terminal, or know enough
about it to write one?  Or does anyone know of another terminal that
would be close enough to his for use whose termcap entry is available?
Any help is much appreciated!

hallo,
i was wondering if there is a version of lilo/bootprogramm that is capable
of booting the kernel per bootp/tftp. this would make a much easier
administration if you have more than just a few linux boxes.

you could have a setup with just a local swap,/tmp and probably /usr.
i think compeetely diskless is not possible if you want to runn xfree
(right???)

thank you

How about a replacement for NFS? :-)

Having two Linux hosts on one SCSI bus would still allow for
6 other devices, but I guess you would need a filesystem that
can take it.

Something equivalent to NFS, that would permit two machines to
access the same SCSI disk partition without getting their inodes
in a twist!

Anyone like to implement this..?

Andrew.


P.S. Talking about filesystems: This afternoon I installed the
new ext2fs 0.4 (grabbed the files off the funet mirror on
ftp.mcc.ac.uk around 2pm GMT)

I had installed the bootutils package, hoping it would give me
clean filesystems on boot-up. Unfortunately either my e2fsck (0.2c)
wasn't noticing the flag, or shutdown wasn't umounting the fs.

I thought a new e2fsck might do the trick. It did do quite a trick,
it completely scrubbed my root partition! No files left whatsoever!!!

Anyone else had this problem yet..????

There are several files at login.qc.ca (via ftp) which support bootp-protocol
(client side). This files can be found in directory /Linux/dkl.

NO this is not the case. Please see my latest posting. Both my SLIP-host
and home machine are on the same subnet. I simply do:
arp -s <ether-addr-SLIP-host> <IP-SLIP-host addr>
as root on the SLIP-host and it cured the problem for me.

I find my slip setup now (99plo) pretty robust (even nfs runs!).

Subject: getty-ps RINGBACK problems
Date: 10 Nov 1993 17:53:00 GMT


Guten Tag!

After setting up a dial-in on my Linux system I felt the intense urge to be
able to answer incoming voice calls again. (Yes, I have only one phone line.)
So I decided to set up the ringback feature of getty.

I recompiled the sources, defining the appropriate symbol to create a ringback
getty, installed them and started to test them. According to the debug output
(got with DEBUG=777) the ringback is correctly recognized. Unfortunately,
when sending the CONNECT sequence ("" ATA\r CONNECT\s\A) the modem does not
answer. In the debugging output I found (don't have the file here but you'll
get the idea if I retype the output from my remembrance)):

        ... performing connect sequence...
        EXPECT: nothing            Ah, that's the "" from the CONNECT sequence
        SEND: ATA\r                Yea, my modem should answer now...
        EXPECT: CONNECT [speed]    .. and get back this nifty little string.
        GOT: ^M^J^M^J^M^JRING^M^J^M^J^M^JRING^M^J^M^J^M^J...

Well, seems as if my modem does not really accept the ATA but only reports the
incoming RINGs.

It's somewhat interesting that the same CONNECT sequence works fine when
getty is set up without the ringback feature.

Changing the ATA\r to \r\r\r\r\r\rAT\rAT\rAT\rATA\r and such did not show
any more positive result.

I'm using the pl11 kernel (should I expect anything else with pl13?) and
the getty_ps 2.0.7b.

Any information will be appreciated. Thank you for your help!

HI,
        I posted this to *.help a couple of days ago and got no
response and figured this group might be more appropriate since this
is admin stuff. so her goes, does anyone have software to use the
following devices from linux

1) Jumbo Trakker 250 from colorado memory systems it plugs into the
line printer port.

2) Smart UPS-600 from APC

now I have the latter and have access to the former I would like to be
able to use them any help apreciated. Please email me at

Hi,

I'm using SLS 1.03 p12.  Everytime I type "e2fsck -a /dev/hdb2" I get tons
of errors relating to Bad inodes and bad directories. Everything gets sent
to the lost and found. My Linux system is on /dev/hdb2.  Is this a normal
occurance, or is my file system messed up?  Everything seems to work ok.

In truth, renaming and deleting directories in MS-DOS is exactly the same
