A moderated newsgroup would be useful for this purpose.  The only
drawback I can think of is: the knowledgable person who moderates
would have less time to track down and fix the bugs.  On the other
hand, independant confirmation and documentation of a bug is a
very useful contribution...

Other ideas?

Well, this must not neccessary be a joke...

The sco or interactive (I do not remember) used to generate passwords for
users which where easy to remember, but rather guaranteed not to find in
a dictionary. (diskipa or similar things) 

However, they are generated by an algorythm, so some hacker targeting such
a system could generate a database of these passwords, could he not?

So it would be very unsecure to use these seemingly secure passwords...

Maybe we should take this to alt.security, though.

...hey, wait a minute! What happened to Ross Biro's setup! Did it just
die silently? This is the exact purpose that he wanted it to serve! THe
idea was that people could mail linux-support@sunsite.unc.edu and if
their problem wasn't a user error, then a *very descriptive* bug report
would be sent to the appropriate people. Geez, that sure sounds pretty
similar to me. Here is the posting announcing the support from (gasp)
almost *three* months ago.

The address is now officially linux-support@sunsite.unc.edu
although linux-bugs@sunsite.unc.edu will continue to work
for some time.

I'm reposting the whole announcement with the new address in
case people missed it the first time by.


SAVE THIS! SAVE THIS! It contains important instructions.

        The Linux Email Support System is now ready for general use.
It is not bug free, and there will be delays and other teething
problems for a while.

Purpose:
        The purpose of the Linux Email Support System is to provide
a forum for people to ask questions without worrying about being
flamed for a non-Linux specific question or for asking a FAQ.

Who Should Use it?
        The Linux Email Support System is for anyone who is having
a problem with Linux.  It is not intended to replace comp.os.linux[.announce]
or the mailing lists, but rather to supplement them with a forum
designed specifically to deal with the volume of questions on
comp.os.linux which are easily answered.

Why Use It?
        If you send a question to the Linux Email Support System, it
will be routed to a single individual who will take responsibility for
answering it.  If that individual can't answer it, (s)he will forward
it to someone that may be able to.  Everyone is likely to benefit
because there will be less traffic in comp.os.linux, and each question
will get a single individual to deal with it, rather than many people
answering one question while a second question is ignored.

When Should I use It?
        This is a tough question, and is really a judgement call.  If
you believe your question is interesting or otherwise very current, you
should probably post it directly.  However if you are having problems
with a common program or subsystem, you should probably use the
Linux Email Support System based on the philosophy that if it really
worked that poorly, everyone would be screaming about it.  Also if you
don't have much experience with Unix in general you should read the
FAQ from comp.unix.questions and use the Linux Email Support System
until you feel more confident (or get asbestos underwear 8-).

How do I know the answer I got is correct?
        There is no guarantee of the correctness of any given answer.
However to help prevent the distribution of misinformation, all answers
(The first time they are answered only) are sent to the appropriate
channel of the mailing list.  That way many people see the answer, and
if it is incorrect, someone will probably say something.  You are
also free to ask the question again in a more public forum
such as comp.os.linux and point out why you think the answer as in error.

SAVE THIS PART !!!!

How do I use It?

        You just mail your question to linux-support@sunsite.unc.edu
There is one caveat; however, the Linux Email Support System has been
designed to be easy for the software maintainers and volunteers to
use.  The net affect is that there is a reasonably rigid format.
Every message must contain the following fields.

Keywords:
Summary:
Program:
Kernel:
Hardware:
Description:
Expected:

The order is not important; but ALL the fields must be present in ALL
problem-reports, or the software will return the question to you.  The
format purpose of each of the fields is

Keywords:  Single line.
Used to try to see if this is a FAQ and can be auto answered
by machine.  Proper use of this field will greatly increase the number
of messages which can be handled per day.

Summary: Single Line.
Quick summary of the problem.  Also used by the software to see if
it's a FAQ.  And makes it easier for the Volunteer to answer it.

Program: Single Line. 
Program and Version number that is causing problems.  This should be
included whenever possible; even if you think it is a general problem
as it makes things easier to reproduce and track down.

Kernel: Multi Line. 
This is kernel version number and options configured in.  You should also
include where you got it (compiled it yourself, SLS, ...) in case it turns
out to be a kernel problem and a system map file is needed.

Hardware: Multi Line.
This is the hardware you are experiencing the problem on.  It is not
always relevant, but it is often hard to tell, and should be as complete
as possible.  Especially include things like the type of hard drive
controller etc.

Description: Multi Line.
This is a complete description of the problem; including how to reproduce
it.  Include transcripts generated via the script program, dejagnu scripts,
or xterm whenever possible.

Expected: Multi Line.
This is mostly for cases when something happens that is different from
what you expect; i.e. select alters the timeout value.  It should also
be included when you are asking about features that you don't think
are present in Linux, or need to be emulated.  If you can include a
portion of a man page or other documentation which backs up the
behavior you wish, it would be helpful.  You can also leave this field
blank in cases of programs simply crashing, or if you feel the Description is
enough.

Here is an example
======
mail linux-support@sunsite.unc.edu
~Subject: problem with gcc

Keywords: gcc link ld math library
Summary: Math externals not linked in.
Program: gcc -lm foo.c
Kernel: .99 pl9 from SLS with tcp/ip and ipc_delta patches

Description: gcc -lm foo.c can't find floor.

script done on Mon May 31 12:22:36 1993
--- foo.c --
#include <math.h>


main ()
{
  int x;
  x = floor (12.30);
}
--- end of foo.c ---

Expected:
. 
=====
End Example.


This is great how can I help?
        If you would like to help, there are many things you can do.
If you feel capable, you can volunteer to answer questions.   You
can fix problems with the software.  Donating resources (hard drive
space etc.) might also be useful.  You could combine our scripts
with GNATS for an incredibly powerful bug tracking system.
If you would like to help mail bir7@leland.stanford.edu and tell me
what you would like to do.

Who do we have to thank for this?
        You should thank all the volunteers as well as the sunsite admins,
especially jem@sunsite.unc.edu, and Ted.  Currently the volunteers are

Ross' robot first tries to match every question to a FAQ, replies
automatically if any FAQ fits and forwards the question to a human
(me or someone else) if it doesn't.  The human's answer is then
entered into the FAQ database.

It works, kinda, I get a question now and then, and since their code
numbers keep rising I assume the robot answers a lot of questions
from the FAQ database. 

Very few, maybe no questions are real, new, bugs worth submitting
bug reports for.  Generally they seem to be already reported on the
activists lists or fixed-but-not-in-SLS type problems.  Typical
examples are someone who has an unsupported chipset and wants to use
X, or someone who has an old ftpd and can't get mget to work.

All this is IMHO and from my experience, naturally.

And my reply was that you can't, you define another swap partition
in the same manner as the first (only I used four lines, not two).

Lighten up Andreas :-)
You are making many assumptions about what Steve did not do to get help
elsewhere. "Der moralische Zeigefinger" does not help! 
In virtually all the cases I have seen in the past the permissions were
indeed the culprit. I have seen the exact symptoms Steve mentioned and it
took me three days to find the problem. Turned out to be bad *permissions*
on ..... taataa : /tmp. After restoring my root partition from tape I did
not have 1777 any more. The only symptom: no news! Well, maybe there would
have been others, but I like to login as root. (THIS IS *MY* 'PUTER!)

The return status of 1 from rnews suggests that rnews was found an run.
Check the scripts. So it is almost guaranteed the permissions. But there
are so many, ach ... ;-)

Forgive me if you've already seen this post in "comp.os.linux", but I've
just discovered that this new hierarchy exists, and this is the place where
the question should have gone originally.

I've just installed the SLS 1.03 linux implementation on my 486/33.  I'm
trying to get printing working, following the instructions in the FAQ.
I have a printer on LPT1: which works - I can copy a file to /dev/lp1 and
it prints fine.

My problem is that the printer daemon "lpd" refuses to run.  If I run it,
it terminates with no error messages immediately (exit code 0, if that
helps).  When I try to print through "lpr" I get the message "job queued,
but no daemon present".  When I run the printer control program lpc and
give the "restart" command I get the message:

    lp:
         cannot open lock file
    lp:
    lpc: connect: No such file or directory
         couldn't start daemon

I've edited the "printcap" file to simply say:

    lp:\
        :lp=/dev/lp1:\
        :sd=/usr/spool/lp1:\
        :mx#0:

I've create the directory "/usr/spool/lp1".

This is getting VERY fraustrating.  If anyone can help me with this problem,
I'd really appreciate it!

Thanks!
