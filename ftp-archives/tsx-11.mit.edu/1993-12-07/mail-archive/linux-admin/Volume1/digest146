        I wish to install LINUX on my system but I am not sure how I can
go about it since I have a boot manager for OS/2 installled.  I have 2
IDE drives C and D. D is just a bunch of data so is of no consequence.
Presently I have my C drive (245 MB) partitioned at 60 for OS/2 and the rest
for DOS...I wish to repartition th eDOS partition to install Linux, however
I want to also add the Linux partition on the Boot Manager.  

Could someone please give me some insight ...the FAQs are not very
helpful when it comes to installing Linux on OS/2.

Hi,

I am having problems sending mail to node "shell.portal.com". This node
isn't directly on the internet. I'm not sure how it's setup, but it's
routed through portal.com somehow.  If it's not directly on the
nameserver, does linux have to be configured differently to handle this
kind of address?

Thanks,

Not sure that I have a definitive answer, but I have been running 
Slackware 1.0.4 (0.99pl13 with NET-2) with the short form of the hostname 
(not the fully qualified domainname) and have not noticed any problems.  
Which is actually contrary to the NET-2 HOWTO, but kept Smail's Automatic 
Configuration Scripts happy (avoiding foo.bar.com.bar.com) and generates 
compiled Kernel Images which were in keeping with the "darkstar" Kernel 
which came with the Slackware Installation.  This I do with a "short" 
"/etc/HOSTNAME" File (with a "/bin/hostname -S" in the "/etc/local" file) 
and the domain coming from the "/conf/net/resolv.conf" File.

On our SunOS 4.1.3 I was also running with a "short" host name in the 
"/etc/hostname.le0" File, but more recently this NEWS Reader (vn.jan.88)
required the full domainname for its postings (so I switched to the full
domainname for the SUNs).  Although both seemed to be running correctly 
(other than this NEWS Reader!)?

Some other Linux Users may have reasons for the full domainname, but so far 
I have not come across one!

Subject: SLIP:  *Almost* working
Date: 8 Nov 1993 10:17:19 GMT

After much head-beating and hair-pulling, I've got a SLIP connection
between my Linux box at home and the terminal server at work.
However, for some reason, I can only telnet/rlogin/ftp/ping machines
on the local net at work.  If I login to a remote site (outside of
work), and ping my Linux box, and run "route", I can see the use count
growing, so the packets are presumably being received.

I've tried various combinations of netmask and broadcast address, but
no luck.  Does this sound familiar to anybody?

I have got SLIP to work a bit further for me. I can "tcp/ip" to many outside
the local net internet nodes, but mysterioysly it fails on some (?) - I played
with the mtu setting on the ifconfig command and managed to have some 
success with a few.
I use 99pl13o kernel and I also managed (for the first time I think) to 
nfs mount directories from the slip host (nfs is dead slow 
over slip though but it works!).
All the above with the SLIP (not the CSLIP) setup.
One extra point: I have NEVER managed to "tcp/ip" to nodes on the local
net (apart from the slip host of course). I wonder how you did that.
I had discussed this with people using slip over 386bsd and there seems
to be a slip design problem with regard to local-net routing ???

My local setup looks like this:
ifconfig sl0 A.B.C.101 pointopoint A.B.C.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast
        A.B.C.255
route add A.B.C.101
route add default gw A.B.C.101

A.B.C is the class B address of the subnet on which the slip host A.B.C.1 is 
(the slip host is also the router for the subnet).
I cannot speak to ANY machine with address A.B.C.xxx


Hope someone can clarify this furthermore...

I did this too, but from an ordinary account. Just rlogin as usual,
give your own passwd, and I found myself running with ruid 0. euid was
ok though.

I was only able to do this 4 or 5 times, then it worked properly
again.

Yes, like this:
        (void)setuid(pwd->pw_uid);
        execlp(pwd->pw_shell, tbuf, (char *)0);

Why is the return value from setuid not checked? This is *the*
most important syscall in login.c, and a failure will go by
unnoticed.

I suggest:
        1. checking the return value from setuid.
        2. Calling getuid() before exec'ing, in case
           setuid() failed silently. Can't be too careful.

I have also been able to achieve ruid = 0 by rlogin, as the original
poster described. And I remember that there was no syslog entry
that root had logged in. From reading login.c, I can deduce that
the passwd file entry has been properly read (pwd->pw_uid is correct).

This means that either setuid fails, or exec mysteriously
resets ruid to 0 (as far as I can tell.) Remember that euid
was correct.

That's correct. But using my old /bin/login cures the problem, without 
changing rlogind.

No you don't.

After I have logged into my machineas myself from one that I am root on,
executing id reports

        uid=0(root) gid=0(root) euid=123(ceh)

so although I am effectively me I have root power. This only happens if
when rloging on I am asked for a password, i.e. I have no .rhosts entry.

Will do when I have a moment.

I'll do that... At least 1. Can't imagine why setuid() should fail, unless
/bin/login is not setuid root or /etc/passwd is corrupted.

I just peeked at the man-page for setuid (on hpux):

           +  If the euid is not zero, but the argument uid is equal to the
              ruid or the suid, setuid sets the euid to uid; the ruid and
              suid remain unchanged.  (If a set-user-ID program is not
              running as super-user, it can change its euid to match its
              ruid and reset itself to the previous euid value.)

Is your /bin/login program setuid root as it should be?

This means that an average user is able to prevent the system going being

I think part of the problem with your building the kernel is that you forgot
one very big step in there (which for some reason is letting you get by
and it shouldn't).

You list your building steps as so:

        cd linux
        make dep
        make clean
        make zImage

When it should go like so:

        cd linux
        make config
        make dep
        make clean
        make zlilo

The make config prompts you for pertinent configuration information and the
zlilo will invoke your /etc/lilo/install script (or program) to get lilo up
and going on the new kernel.  (Which may have to be changed cause zlilo causes
the kernel to be named /vmlinuz and /vmlinuz.old.)

Good luck

We completed the installation process correctly and made a bootdisk. While booting with the new bootdisk the system hanged up.

If you have the kernel source installed (which you should, especially
if you are running an Alpha version, you can do a grep for that line
of code in the /linux/net/inet directory.  I believe the file is tcp.c
and just comment out that line of code (it's a printk() if I remeber
