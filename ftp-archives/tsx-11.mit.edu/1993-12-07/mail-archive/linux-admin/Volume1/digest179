  I cured the problem :).
  The 0.99.13 kernel has a signal.h that doesnt quite support SIG_DFL
  (its supposed to be a bug, as per the man pages).
  So, what i did was, i downloaded a copy of talk from sunsite.unc.edu
  (ie the source code), and then added the line -D__USE_BSD_SIGNAL in 
  the Makefile's CFLAGS line.
  And, now.... voila..it works! ;)

                                                        -Mohan-
  PS: if you still notice any bugs lemme know.. so that i can look into
  these and see what to do...:P

Sorry, but this is incorrect.

/sbin is primarily created to move all of the administrative
executables out of /etc.  Including both binaries and configuration
files in /etc makes it more confusing and harder to maintain for
inexperienced users or system administrators with especially large
systems.

/sbin is also used in most modern Unix systems and the Linux
filesystem should also try to conform to these basic ideas so our
filesystem doesn't become known as "odd" (like Xenix or Ultrix).

/sbin doesn't imply "static binaries", but rather "system binaries" or
"super-user binaries" (in some older usage).

Still, some emergency recovery material is stored in /sbin as well as
/bin.  Linking statically is up to the administrator although it
really doesn't buy you much in terms of safety.  This is especially
true now that 'ldconfig' has being released and is packaged with
libc...  you don't have to worry about axed symlinks in /lib any more.

Yes, this is possible. I run a BBS on a modem line and have two PC's
connected via serial cables running Telix. Telix's terminal emulations
suck, but it works for all intended purposes.

If you need help, try posting what you have done, what didn't work, and
what your setup is or that you have no idea what you are doing. I would
suggest reading the serial FAQ first (or serial HOW-TO as it's called now).

Well you could FTP it from sunsite.unc.edu in the /pub/Linux/distributions/SLS
directory or I believe there are some companies who will sell you the necessary
disks.

By the way Joey, will you be able to keep your PC while serving time? 8^)

Every _three_ hours???

Am I insane, or is this a gross waste of resources given the little that
inodes change?  If your files are that critial, I'd say invest in a
more stable filesystem, RAID, a UPS, and frequent backups.

A simple transceiver should be all that's required, that comment about you
"messing up the net" is total bullshit.  You can tap into the network with
a transceiver and run your thinnet segment from that, shouldn't be a problem.
