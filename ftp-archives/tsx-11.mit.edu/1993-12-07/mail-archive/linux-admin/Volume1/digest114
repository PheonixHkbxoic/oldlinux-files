Assuming that they did so without making it secure, as you describe
below, then someone could definitely break into the machine while holding their
breath.  But they would have to exploit the race condition - the
method you suggested using execve("-", ...) doesn't work. (Try it!)

The way I implemented it, the kernel only passed /proc/self/fd/3 to
set[ug]id scripts, not to all scripts, so normal shell scripts would
still work if /proc is not mounted.

That is true, but it shouldn't be any worse than the danger of
having / or /etc writeable.

I agree that it is somewhat ugly, but the startup code contains some
magic filenames: /dev/tty1, /etc/init, etc., so this is not completely
unique.  On the other hand, I think that from an architectural point
of view it doesn't make sense for the kernel to support #! interpreter
scripts if it's only going to do a half-hearted job (i.e. not support
setuid #! scripts).

The disadvantage you didn't mention is setuid shell scripts can't use
$0 to print out error messages, etc., since $0 is now /proc/self/fd/3.
Also it looks a little bit ugly in your ps listings.  Oh well, you
can't have everything.

Further disadvantage: you need to have a setuid root interpreter,
even if the shell scripts are only setgid to unimportant groups.
To some extent, the security of your system is inversely proportional
to the number of setuid root executables on it ;-), so this is
undesireable.

I have 6 machines in a local network connected via SLIP to the internet.

The one machine with the SLIP and ethernet talk beautifully to everyone
locally and everyone on the outside.  

The local machines have arbritrary IP numbers, on a different network than
the SLIP connection.

If I put all the machines on the same "network" as the SLIP connection,
nothing works.

If I try to access the SLIP connection from another machine I get "network
unreachable".

Can someone with some experience with this sort of thing PLEASE give me some
hints?

Thanks,

Add there login name to /etc/group for the groups you want them to be able
to newgrp to.

i.e. give juser acces to wheel group

wheel::100:juser[,root,etc]
           ^-----------------user's login id ( more than one followed by comma)
       ^---------------------groupid (does not have to be 100)
^----------------------------group name      

This entry should be in the file somewhere

yes, it is possible. but the SLS shadow passwd login is broken and
doesnt set the user's groups properly when he logs in. poeigl login
works out of the box. I had to patch the shadow login to set the

Date: 18 Oct 93 05:17:56 GMT

Well if you've been reading any of the linux newsgroups you are aware
of the raging debate going on about the quantity and types of questions
to the newsgroup comp.os.linux.development. I decided to start asking
folks who post questions on c.o.l.d and c.o.l.admin why they put their
questions there. I've done this simply by E-mailing a survey question
to the original poster and saving the replies. Maybe we can use this
info to make some intelligent decisions about how to manage questions
in the linux hierarchy.

Here is the summary so far. Anonymous of course. I have been indiscriminate 
of the type of question posted. Every new question that has been posted to 
c.o.l.d or c.o.l.admin I've send a survey to. This is about 5 days of 
summaries. I plan to continue my survey and post a cumulative summary
every week or so. All followups to this post should go to comp.os.linux.misc
so as not to stir up any more traffic in the other groups. I've set
the follow to c.o.l.m.

Please feel free to comment on the contents of this. I've asked the
respondents if they minded an anonymous summary and no one has objected
so far.

First the survey E-Mail:
==========================================================================
Hi,

I can't help on your problem. I'm conducting an informal survey. I wanted
to know why you posted a question to comp.os.linux.development when the
comp.os.linux.help group is specifically for questions?

It's no problem to me and no flame to you. I'm just trying to gather info
so that I can intelligently respond to folks when they ask me this 
question. There is a big debate going on in the linux newsgroups over this 
topic.

Also I wanted to know if you objected to an anonymous summary of your 
answer at some later time.

Thanks and waiting for your reply,

BAJ

Hi Byron,

well before posting this message to *.admin I thought about where to
post it. I was not not sure if to post it to *.help or even to
*.developement. What made me to post it to *.admin was finally the

Hi Byron,

I believe I can post for requesting help in c.o.l.d because
I have problem with gcc and profiling, and I need profiling
to do development under linux.

Do you understand the term development only kernel hacking or those
who attempt to do that or who already contributed a lot
to LINUX, e.g. Linus T. ?

The compiler is one of the central part of an OS, maybe my request
points out a general problem, a feature leak and so it is of common 
interest. Due to this it is not only a help request !
Just remember it went fine with gcc 2.3.3.

Hope, You means the same thing as I do, with profiling I surely
do not mean .profile for bash (actually in discussed in c.o.l.help)
but execution profile of a program at runtime, how often a function 
was called and how much time it consumed.

Because you ask me to post to c.o.l.help and in the context 
of the actual discusion on c.o.l.d (see "Questions are permitted on c.o.l.d")
I feel very confused, sad and a bit ill about that what is going on
and due to this you receive this flame like reply.

BTW, I am the one of many who voted for the c.o.l.* and 
believe to know where questions should be posted to.
Before my posting I already investigate lots of time to find
out what are missing, I compliled gcc my self and check every
files to find out if I could generate the needed files myself.

Hope, You will be aware by judging what should belong to c.o.l.d
and what not.

Sory, You will receive this email with a bit delay. My own 
private host is connected via uucp, I use to call out only 
once a day for emails and news.

If you can, your help will be greatly appreciated.

Because, at least to me, this seems like an ADMIN type problem.  The Help

what file do I edit when I want aliases to be recognized upon login?
Aren't questions about administration type problems supposed to be asked
in an admin group?

I don't believe that you will be able to gear all the questions that people
will ask to a certain news group just by posting "post only discussion about
X here" because possibly people, like me, may not read these messages due
to time/work whatever.

BTW: Should ALL linux questions go to linux.help?  This seems rather 
unreasonable.

Subject: Re: Is a MAC FS under development?

> [ Survey Deleted ] 
No problem.  The reason for this post in c.o.l.d was basically because of
topic.  This particular group was created for communication on system
development issues (kernel, file systems, device drivers, difficult porting,
etc).  Since this question concerned the development of a particular fs
support, I posted it here.  Simple enough? :)

AS to the c.o.l.h vs c.o.l.h... c.o.l.h is for general help, ie, 'how do I
get such and such a program to work?', 'why am I getting this error?',
'how can I make this compile', etc, etc.   Any issue that relates to
LINUX DEVELOPMENT belongs in here (c.o.linux.development :).  There are in
fact some questions that may fit into both groups, as they have a fine
overlap area.  Unlike c.o.l.a there was no condition stating that no
questions of any sort would be allowed in c.o.l.d when we voted/split.  It
is my personal opinion that questions definately contribute to the
developmental process, so long as they are appropriate.  

As to the occasional 'off-topic' posts that end up in c.o.l.d.  I just
don't read them, or if I do, I respond via email.  There is no
reason to generate even more garbage in the group.  'off-topic' is not
defined (defining it in a weekly post of some sort would be a good idea),
and therefore opinions will vary. 

There will always be a stray post or two (or three, or four), especially
with new lnux users every day.  There is no reason to discourage these new
users with 'flames', or irk your fellow c.o.l.d reader with more off-topic
posting.  Simply moving off-topic discussion to other c.o.l or private
channels will maintain efficiency.

I have an Everex QIC-02 tape drive, and I'm using Linux 0.99pl12. My
tape devices are configured like this:

crw-r--r--   2 root     root      12,   6 Sep  7 21:08 /dev/tape
crw-r--r--   1 root     root      12, 136 Sep 11 01:31 /dev/tape-d

In the kernel, the drive is set up as IRQ 5, DMA 1, and I/O address 338H.

Typing in "mt -f /dev/tape-reset reset" does exactly what it's supposed
to do: The tape drive makes some noises, and stops. Any other combinations
of -f parameters and commands (for example: "mt -f /dev/tape tell") will
result in:

rewind failed in do_qic_cmd(). stat=0xfffffffa

Any suggestions?

Subject: UNIX sysadmin FAQ- proposal and volunteer
Date: Mon, 18 Oct 93 06:49:38 GMT

I'd like to volunteer to keep a general UNIX system administration
FAQ.  There are many resources and FAQs available for the UNIX system
admin, but I have yet to see a good document addressing most of the
relevant issues in one place.  One would would need extensive
experience to see the many interdependencies (eg NTP helps ensure NFS
consistency which can improve the reliability of mail-delivery).

There are, of course, some good books available.  However, the ones
that I've looked at omit many tips & topics that are especially useful
and/or necessary to heterogeneous, Internet-connected sites.
Furthermore, they typically don't document the many (freely and
commercially) available tools that can be invaluable to a system
manager.
 
Since some of these issues have detailed FAQs of their own (eg MIME,
security), I would just mention them briefly with a pointer to the
other FAQs.  Others would be addressed in more detail.

I'd like to know if people feel this would be a worthwhile thing to
have posted regularly.  If I get positive feedback that this would be
useful to the community, I'll go ahead and come up with a rough draft
based on what I've got here and post it in the near future for
editing.

Here is my initial proposal for stuff to be addressed.  I'd also
appreciate input on issues or tools that I've forgotten or only
partially covered.
