The libc-4.4.4 documentation says that if gcc is invoked with -g then it will
link to a set of libraries with debugging on.

I only installed 4.4.4 yesterday so I haven't played with this yet, but two
posibilities come to mind:

(1) do the compile only with -g, then invoke gcc again to link, (this does not
need the -g flag so the normal libraries will be used). 

(2) specify the non-debugging libraries explicityl on the gcc command line.

Not here.  We've got a laser printer on a Sparc 2 and an HP plotter on a

Subject: Can't run VI and other programs!!!
Date: Wed, 17 Nov 1993 20:58:12 GMT

I have trouble running VI, CU, and other programs on my computer.
I have been running Linux on my computer for several months with
no problem.  Therefore, this is not due to incorrect installation. 
When I want to run programs such as CU or VI I get an error message
saying:  "No space left on device"
In VI it would prompt:
        garbage() failed to read oldhdr?? [More...] 
        "test" [READONLY] 1 line, 1 char [More...]
        Trouble writing to tmp file 
In CU it would prompt:

        cu: No space left on device
        cu: work: All matching ports in use    
        Disconnected

        ('work' is the systems I am trying to call)

Does anyone recognize this problem?????

Subject: Re: Default shell on login [ANSWER]
Date: 17 Nov 93 16:23:52 GMT


  Thanks to all who responded.

  The problem boiled down to bash not reading the .bashrc on login.  I had
assumed that sh was being run (which I know is also bash, but it
behaves differently when run that way) from some sort of default.  Bad
assumption.  The answer is that on a login shell, bash reads .bash_profile,
and not .bashrc.  On anything else it appears that it runs .bashrc and not
.bash_profile.

  I don't feel too bad on not figuring this out, because I can't find this
documented *anywhere* (except maybe the source :).

I'm afraid that I haven't closely examined the details of ext2 or
the others, but I want to point out, while the topic is hot:
Interactive Unix boosted performance of the SysV 1K filesystem 30% by
just keeping the free block list in core as a bitmap.  They flushed or
invalidated it on the disk on unmount/crash.

This had the effect of keeping a sorted freelist that was easy to
allocate the largest contiguous set of blocks.  Worked great, except
that the first version took a while on large disks to mount/unmount,
unless the disk was mostly full...

Note that they still kept the safe inode freelist structure
technically, just handled it differently internally.  You could
optimize memory by not having it on readonly mounts and only keeping a
limited number of references (say the next N MB's worth of free
blocks) in core and scanning the free list if you used those up.

This comes up again and again. You don't need no /dev entries or anything
of the sort unless you are playing with Fred Van Kempens NET2E code. Neither
2D (in Slackware/SLS/...) nor NET2Debugged (in pl13f-r  [ALPHA pl14]) need

Subject: Should at(1) bump days?
Date: 17 Nov 1993 23:44:04 GMT

Hello, fellow Linuxers;

I've put a bug/feature in my current at(1) implementation which,
although sometimes useful, may also cause surprises.

To quote the manpage:

      At allows some moderately complex TIME specifications.  It accepts
      times of the form HHMM or HH:MM to run a job at a specific time of
      day.  (If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.)

So, when I run a command via

$ at -f myscript 12:00

myscript will get executed at 12:00 the next day, if it is 13:00 (for 
example).

Do people actually find this useful, or should it be removed in the
next release (which is due within a few days, anyway)?  Does anybody
depend on it?

Input appreciated, either via discussion or E-Mail.

The only time I see this is when the tape drive is performing a lengthy
operation that does not involve an ongoing data transfer.  Rewind is the
big culprit, but the first read operation on a newly loaded tape also
takes a while.  I haven't yet examined the SCSI operation with a logic
analyzer, but judging by the blinkenlights, it would appear that the
drive is not disconnecting, but hangs onto the bus during the entire
operation.  Perhaps the firmware on the host adapter is not giving the
target the disconnect privilege.  I'll have to check into it.
(Gimme a chance!  I haven't even got this thing booting reliably yet.)

Have you tried 'man bash'?

However, I do agree that the first snippet should also be mentioned in
the invocation section.

Archive-name: linux/announce/intro
Last-modified: 8 August 93


                 Welcome to the comp.os.linux.* hierarchy!

Background
=========================================================================
        This posting is an introduction to the comp.os.linux.* hierarchy 
        of USENET newsgroups. 

        Linux is a free implementation of UNIX for 80386/80486 machines 
        covered by the GNU GPL. Most of the development of the Linux 
        kernel has been done by Linus Torvalds, an internationally 
        reknowned UNIX wizard from Helsinki, Finland.

        For the past two years or so, the newsgroup comp.os.linux has 
        grown be one of the most popular groups on USENET. Late in 1992, 
        a CFV for splitting comp.os.linux was posted; the only group which 
        passed was comp.os.linux.announce, a moderated newsgroup for Linux 
        announcements and patches.

        Six months later, during the summer of 1993, another CFV for 
        splitting comp.os.linux was posted. The voting period for the 
        comp.os.linux reorganization results ended at 23:59:59 UTC on 
        4 August 1993 (4:59PM US Pacific Time, 7:59PM US Eastern Time.) 
        The results are as follows:

        comp.os.linux reorganization results - 1842 votes

         Yes   No  : 2/3? >100? : Pass? : Group
         ---- ---- : ---- ----- : ----- : -------------------------------
         1692  135 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.admin
         1741   90 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.development
         1647  177 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.help
         1660  155 :  Yes   Yes :   Yes : comp.os.linux.misc


        Because of this split, the newsgroup comp.os.linux will be 
        deleted on 11 November 1993. The new newsgroups will be created 
        on 11 August 1993. This posting describes these newsgroups, 
        including comp.os.linux.announce, which will remain entact.


General Policy
=========================================================================
        The general policy for the Linux newsgroups is simple. Who sets
        the policy? We all do. All of us on USENET are interested in
        communicating openly about a number of topics. That's why we
        have USENET. If you want the Linux newsgroups to work for you,
        a few suggestions:

        * Read the Linux FAQ and follow the newsgroups for some time 
          before posting questions. This is very important. comp.os.linux 
          suffered from HUGE amounts of noise and traffic because much 
          of the growing readership never bothered to READ the newsgroup;
          they only posted questions.
          
          The same thing will happen with the new newsgroups unless you 
          read the FAQ (found on sunsite.unc.edu in the file 
          pub/Linux/docs/FAQ) and read the newsgroup for some time before 
          posting questions. Chances are, your question has already been
          recently answered, and a simple browsing of the newsgroup
          will answer it. We suggest using a threaded newsreader such as
          "trn" which will allow you to browse and mark articles by 
          subject, so you don't have to read each and every article in
          each newsgroup.

        * Crossposting between the Linux newsgroups is STRONGLY 
          discouraged. If you do crosspost questions between Linux 
          newsgroups, expect to be flamed to oblivion. The reason we
          have a newsgroup split is to categorize discussions into 
          separate newsgroups. Crossposting negates this effect. 
          If your posting cannot fit into ONE of the newsgroups
          c.o.l.admin, c.o.l.help, or c.o.l.development, then you 
          should post it to c.o.l.misc. 

          The one exception is for announcements. Occasionally, an
          important announcement (such as this one) will be crossposted
          between c.o.l.announce and one or more of the other c.o.l.*
          groups. These announcements must be approved by the .announce
          moderator; see below.

        * Reply to questions via e-mail if at all possible. While 
          discussion in the newsgroups is encouraged, if someone is
          asking a simple question to which the answer is well-known,
          there is no reason to post the reply. Don't assume that 
          the person posting the question actually reads the newsgroup
          or will even note your followup if they do. Reply via e-mail
          unless the reply is of general interest. 

        * Don't flame newbies. Over the course of the past few months,
          the Linux community has developed an oversensitive ego and
          a reputation for being unfriendly towards newcomers, mostly
          because of unwarranted flaming by a handful of righteous 
          individuals. If someone posts, saying, "Hi! I'm new to
          this group! What is Linux?" (which will inevitably happen
          as the new newsgroups are propagated), DO NOT FLAME THEM.
          When someone sees a new newsgroup pop up within "rn", they
          are justifiably curious about the new group and probably
          don't know that well over 80,000 people who know EVERYTHING
          about Linux read the group. Right? 

          Instead of being rude, you can send a polite note to the
          poster, saying, "Hello, Linux is a free implementation of
          UNIX for the 386 and 486. You can get the FAQ from 
          sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/docs. Let me know if I can
          be of help!". That's all. Not difficult, eh? You can even
          save your stock reply in a file and simply send form-letters
          to newbies if you wish. But there is very little point in
          flaming or ever being rude. It goes against everything that
          Linux can and should be. 

          Just remember that nobody knows everything---not even Linus---
          and that you were a newbie once, too. :)


comp.os.linux.announce
=========================================================================
        Comp.os.linux.announce is a moderated newsgroup for Linux 
        announcements and source patches. The purpose of this group was
        to get all of the ``important'' Linux information out of the
        regular newsgroup and into a place where all Linux users could see
        the important announcements without having to wade through a 
        jungle of other postings. So far, this group has been very 
        successful. 

        The moderators for this group are myself (Matt Welsh, 
        mdw@sunsite.unc.edu) and Lars Wirzenius (wirzeniu@cc.helsinki.fi). 
        We will be sharing the moderator duty, and backing each other up 
        to make sure that postings to this group will be approved as soon 
        as possible after they're submitted.

        Submissions to this group should be mailed to the address:
                linux-announce@tc.cornell.edu

        If you have any problems or questions about c.o.l.announce, please 
        send mail to the moderators at
                linux-announce-request@tc.cornell.edu
        Or simply mail us directly. This is not a request address for 
        mailing list subscription; see below.

        A separate posting details the guidelines for submitting to this 
        group.  I plan to approve just about anything that's posted to this 
        group, except for questions or discussions about Linux. So, please, 
        post away.  :)

        There are also archives of comp.os.linux.announce available at a 
        number of Linux FTP sites: check 
                sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/linux-announce.archive

        There is a mailing list mirror of the comp.os.linux.announce 
        newsgroup; to join, send mail to
                linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi
        With the line
                X-Mn-Admin: join ANNOUNCE
        at the top of the body (not in the subject). Approved postings to 
        c.o.l.announce will automatically be mailed to this mailing list 
        channel.


comp.os.linux.admin     
=========================================================================
        This newsgroup was created simply to thwart the unique newsgroup
        acronym "c.o.l.a", previously used by c.o.l.announce. However,
        this newsgroup is also used for discussions and questions about
        running Linux systems, either in a single-user or multi-user
        environment.

        Clearly, there is no large distinction between c.o.l.admin and
        c.o.l.help. However, .admin should be mostly used for discussions
        about RUNNING Linux, not USING or PROGRAMMING it. Unfortunately,
        especially with Linux, the line between system administrator and
        system user is very fuzzy. In short, we anticipate c.o.l.admin
        to be mostly about questions with installing, setting up, and
        configuring Linux systems, as well as other discussions relating
        to system administration. 


comp.os.linux.development
=========================================================================
        c.o.l.development, or "c.o.l.d" for short, is a newsgroup for 
        questions and discussions about Linux kernel and systems-level 
        development. Please note that this is a newsgroup about 
        development OF Linux, not development FOR Linux. In other words, 
        c.o.l.d isn't for questions about programming or porting software 
        to Linux. Instead, this is a newsgroup for discussions about 
        developing the Linux kernel itself, including writing device 
        drivers, adding new features, and so on. In addition, discussions
        about development of shared libraries, and other essential 
        systems-level projects, are welcome here. 

        Hopefully, this newsgroup will embody some of the content and
        scope of the linux-activists mailing list channels such as GCC, 
        KERNEL, SCSI, and NET.


comp.os.linux.help
=========================================================================
        Comp.os.linux.help is perhaps the most general of Linux 
        newsgroups. It is for any general user, programming, or 
        setup questions and discussion about Linux. If your question
        is about Linux development, post to c.o.l.development. If
        it is about system administration, post to c.o.l.admin. 
        However, if your question is of a more general nature, such
        as "How do I set up Linux for use with an NE2000 card?",
        c.o.l.help is your place. 

        Remember that you should not crosspost between .help and
        other Linux newsgroups. This means that if you are asking for
        help in .development, that's fine, but .help is for those
        questions which don't fit into .admin and .development.


comp.os.linux.misc
=========================================================================
        This group is the canonical ``catch-all'' for discussions and 
        questions which don't fit into the other Linux newsgroups.
        While c.o.l.help is generally for questions, c.o.l.misc is for
        discussions of a general nature about Linux, such as setting up
        a file hierarchy standard, questions about Linus' personal life
        and virtual beer, and the inevitable flame war. Again, it should 
        be noted that crossposting between c.o.l.misc and other Linux 
        newsgroups is strongly discouraged. If your posting or question 
        does not fit into ONLY ONE of the other Linux newsgroups, post 
        it to .misc.


Comments
=========================================================================
