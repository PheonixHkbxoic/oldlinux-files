Well, how about this:

Read the SCSI HOWTO (or FAQ) and the hardware compat guide, they will list
known tape drives that work.

Formats that work:  QIC-02/36 interfaces        slow slow slow :)
                    SCSI tape drives, all       can be very fast

I personally have used and/or own:

        teac 155 megger
        archive 150 megger
        wantek 5525 525 megger
        wantek 5150 150 megger
        wantek 4mm dat
        exabyte 8mm dat

All of these are scsi and work wonderfully.  Spend the money on a good
scsi controller and a tape, then later if you need more drive space, just
purchase a drve, and when you need more, just add another.

How about a more positive attitude. I routinely use a program to do exactly

I would use this feature for people who call into my system and don't
know what they are doing.  For example, one person kept telling me he
couldn't login, even though I had set up an account specifically for
him.  It finally turned out he was using all caps to try to login.

I would find it very useful to see exactly what a user sees on the
screen, so I could be of more help in diagnosing (often very silly)
errors.

Progress

  #2 with BIOS enabled, lilo can now successfully boot dos or the

NEW PROBLEM:

  When booting linux 0.99pl13 with SCSI BIOS enabled, the kernel hangs
  after complaining that `aha_1542.c: got interrupt, but no mail' or 
  some such (linux is at home).  This is true whether I boot from the

  Has anybody used this kernel with the AHA 1542 BIOS enabled?

That's it.  When I configured my machine for the soon-to-appear ethernet 
connection, it broke loopback as well.  Comment out the stuff to do with
external networks.  If you can telnet localhost, then the tredir will work.

Subject: SUN NFS, 3button mouse & Kernel Questions!
Date: Mon, 29 Nov 93 23:28:46 GMT

There are actually three unrelated questions:

I have the SLS 1.03 release with Linux pl13 running nicely ony my
two 486s. My setup has the complete SLS on one master machine , with a
large hard drive etc. and the other one has only the basic SLS and runs 
all the stuff (including X) over NFS from the master machine.
All accounts are replicated on both machines, and the home directories
on the slave accounts are actually the master machine's accounts
mounted over the NFS. So the only basic difference in logging in the slave 
or master is that a different CPU/memory is used.  I've had no problem, 
except that disk-intensive jobs on the slave run slower (obviously, since 
the filesystem is over NFS!)

Now the questions:

1. My LINUX boxes also mount my SUN home directories for easy file
access (and vice versa). Linux programs access files on the SUN easily. 
But code (especially my own programs) on the SUN bombs out if I access the 
LINUX files on the LINUX boxes from the SUN. The machine
says "NFS server time out" or something like that? Any idea why??
Commands like "cp", "mv", and even "vi" on the SUN work fine with
the NFS mounted LINUX fs! But my programs bomb!

2. For some reason, I can't get X to work with my slave's 3button mouse
(it's a generic)! Two buttons work great, but I'd like to have
cut and paste . Any idea how to work the 3 button emulation that
I see in the Xconfig? 

3. I just got the SLS 1.03 and I see 0.99pl14 is out already!
What is exactly involved in updating my kernel? Just bring over
and compile? Where do I get the necessary info? What about my SLS setup?
Does it change in any way if I update the kernel?

I would appreciate an email response directly, since our newsfeed is
somewhat problematic!!

If you are using DC2120 tapes you are looking at 120 MB uncompressed (using

: a much better solution to tape backup with Linux.

There are a couple of things I don't like about QIC-02 tapes.
Mainly its the extra adapter.  Partially its the $200-$250 for a used drive,
when I have seen a NEW conner tapestor for $128 (HITECH - SHOPPER).
I already _have_ a jumbo 120 drive which, albeit a bit slow, does work,
and I got it for $100 new.  I am waiting for the price on NEW SCSI DAT's to
become reasonable, and I am also waiting to have the kind of money 
available to buy one.  Until I can afford a device capable of mirroring 
my entire fs on one tape I might as well have the cheapest device available.

I am still paying off the rest of my over-stocked computer.......
I don't have that much data worth backing up.

I see the demand and the rationale for implementing drivers for 
widely available drives.

I have used the drives extensively under MS DOG.  If CMS can make it work,
why can't we?  I don't expect overnight success, and I am not asking anyone 
to write the best driver _now_.  I have the available code, and I understand
that as a user of the pre-release of Linux, I am as much responsible 
for the implementation of said drivers as the author of the ftape package.

I would, however hate to see the linux community turn its collective backs
on QIC-80 tapes merely because everybody lusts after a $1000 DAT.
Soon, newer QIC-80 type drives will come out, and one will probably find
the conner tapestor and like drives for under $100.  When a full 
SLS linux system fits on about 90 meg, this is a good size tape for 
a linux workstation, and hell, its cheap, and readily available.

Like it or not, I think economics are forcing the following:

QIC-02 is being replaced by more expensive SCSI drives.

QIC-80 is replacing QIC-02 for small scale storage.

I also have a considerable ($60) investment in DC2000 tapes.
And they're so cute and small too......

I would like to see a kernel which directly supports the QIC-80
interface in the future, buggy DMA or not.  The dynamic modules 
package available will not compile with a kernel later than the 
strict BETA pl13 kernel.  I might be able to fix this, I'm just not 
sure it's worth it to keep patching the latest kernel when it seems
the Linux community has turned its backs on QIC-80 since the power
users (most very capable developers) have switched to SCSI tapes.
Maybe It will land on me to learn my share of kernel hacking and 
fix this problem.  I am considering the challenge.

Just to be different, I'm going to answer the original poster's
question. :-)  Yes, there is such a program.  It's called expect.
Actually, expect is a general purpose program for automating
dialogues with interactive programs.  It's based on Tcl and is available
from the Tcl archives at harbor.ecn.purdue.edu.  I believe it comes with
a script that does what you want - I think it's called kibbitz.

For those of you who are worried about Big Brother ;-) rest assured, you
can't use this program to spy on a user without his authorization.  In
other words, if a user calls you for help, you can tell him to start
?kibbitz? and from that point on you can see everything he types.

By the way, this is all from memory.  Although, I've used expect, I
didn't use ?kibbitz?  Maybe it'll do what you want, maybe not.  But if
not, you can do what you want with expect.

Good luck,
Tim

I have Public Linux system that ANYONE can get account, but in here

writes "note" to sysop on screen (I find few these "notes" from login prompt

Of course, that's why only admin can "see" them.

If Linux admin really WANT to read user's email, I think that he/she really
not need watcher for it.. Just go into /usr/spool/mail or
/usr/spool/uucp/???? and read what's in there...

Also, where is your mouse device linked to?  Is it to cua? or to
tty?  You might want to check your /dev/mouse entry for a soft link
and then look at your inittab to veryfy the usage of the port.

You may have uugetty or getty or some other driver that locks the
port active.

Has anyone every tried running uustatus or ping from a remote
serial terminal?  Have you ever tried to kill the process with
the intr ^C keystroke?  ^U ^D or any other character of the
alphabet does not seem to help much.

I use uugetty on my serial port for uucp mail as well as my dial
ins from my office.  I have learned (the hard way) that there are
certain commands that you never ever use.

Uugetty is very useful for proper handling of the serial port
when it is used as a dial-in dial-out port.

I have verified my stty settings to confirm the setup.  It is
EXACTLY as I have on my SUN terminal server and still has
this problem.

Any hints or suggestions are appreciated.
