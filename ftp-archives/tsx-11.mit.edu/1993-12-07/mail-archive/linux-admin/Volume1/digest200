I have SLS 1.03 with the .99pl12 kernel.  I have tried to use
the patch to upgrade to .99pl13, but the patch only seems to
include a binary file called diff.  When I run this, it just
give me a bunch of meaningless errors... what's going on...

thanks

Subject: /proc
Reply-To: gast@CS.UCLA.EDU (David Gast)
Date: Thu, 02 Dec 93 22:20:08 GMT

Since SunOs does not use /proc, I have to admit I am somewhat
uncertain about this directory, which gets mounted automatically
as part of the boot process.

Due to file system corruption, I believe, I have three problems.

First, /proc/9/exe, /proc/26/exe, and /proc/28/exe are supposed to
be symbolic links (based on the l in the leftmost column of ls -l),
but they have zero length and no link.  According to ps, process 9
is update, process 26 is /usr/bin/lpd and process 28 is
/usr/net/daemons/inetd.  The time of last modification on the files
gets updated each time I reboot, but the link problem still exists.
Do I need to fix this problem?

Second, /proc/26/fd/[0-5] are symbolic links.  The 0-3 seem to be
ok, but 4 and 5 are bad.  If I try to do an ls on these files, I
get a long series of error messages.  Some of which are listed
below:
  ls: proc/26/exe: no such file or directory [see first problem]
  unable to handle kernel paging request at address c0000000
  Oops: 0000
  ...
  Segmentation fault.

Third, /proc/self/fd/3 does not seem to exist, but find expects
to find it.  This problem may be related to the way find works
and not related to the problems above.

I believe these problems happened because two files got put into
/lost+found.  One of them seems /etc/mtab.  This one does not seem
to be a problem.  The other one is a zero length file.  I believe
this may be related to the /proc/26/exe problem, but I am not sure.

Since I am writing, I would like to report a bug (or at least an
interesting feature).  I tried to mount my floppy, but it failed.
I got repeated messages about a failure.  ^C and ^Z failed to
stop these messages.  I opened another virtual terminal, logged
in, did a ps, and then kill -9 PID.  The messages still continued.
So I did "halt" and it said it was safe to turn the power off.
It was not safe to  turn the power off, as the file system became
corrupted.  Is there a proper channel to report this type of bug?

Any help would be much appreciated.  BTW, is /proc a system V
feature?  I'd like to read up on it a little although it seems
pretty obvious what it's used for.

Typo.  Archive SC401, a QIC02 controller.  The current modem is the SC499R,
and it *might* give similar performance to an ST02 SCSI controller... but I
doubt it'll match the AHA1542.

There's a readme file in the zoneinfo directory. /etc/zoneinfo I think
(or was it /usr/lib/zoneinfo ... It was only last night that I did it. ).
You need to link localtime to the file representing your area.

I just bought a system which was *not* supposed to have a SCSI
controller.  When booting Linux, it says it detects one scsi
device, an Always IN2000.  I believe from reading some FAQ in
the past that this device is actually related to controlling
the floppy drive.

Am I wrong?

Gasp.  Retch.  I used to maintain a sendmail configuration for a (then) major
local site.  There were always some things that not even the sendmail gurus at
CWRU could get working right...  I use smail under Linux, MMDF on other
systems, both are enormously easier to configure and both do everything I
need.

Unless by "true mailing system" you mean true UCB-style hacked/slashed code...

Well, I am happy to say that after 3 sleepless nights, a long distance
call to jon@wariat.org, and many messages posted to different newsgroups,
I finally got slip working.

This is my story...

My computer with access to the internet is at work and it's a DOS machine
(only used for telnet). I have a Linux box at home.

I got ka9q.zip (use archie) for DOS and got it working with the ethernet
card at work. After it was working with the ethernet, I tried getting
slip to work. My <autoexec.net> for ka9q follows.

[
attach packet 0x60 eth0 8 1024          # ethernet card uses packet driver
hostname DOSBOX
ip address DOSBOXIP
ifconfig eth0 ipaddress DOSBOXIP
ifconfig eth0 broadcast xxx.xxx.x.0     # DOSBOXIP with last number as 0
ifconfig eth0 netmask 255.255.255.0

attach asy 0x3f8 4 slip sl0 1024 576 BAUDRATE
# 0x3f8 is io address of com port (com1)
# 4 is irq of com port (com1)
# 576 = mtu, anything too big died on me (i.e. 1500)
# I have no idea what the 1024 is

ifconfig sl0 netmask 255.255.255.0

route add default eth0                  # default is ethernet
route add LINUXIP/32 sl0                # slip is another choice
arp publish LINUXIP ethernet 00:aa:00:0d:cc:ad
# arp publish line isn't necessary (heck, I don't even know what it does)

domain cache clean on                   # not necessary
domain addserver NAMESERVERIP
domain suffix DOMAIN                    # i.e. foo.bar.edu
start echo
start discard
start telnet
start ftp
start finger
start ttylink
]

When I get into ka9q by "net -d .", I type
"tip sl0" <-- this gets you into a dump terminal mode
type anything you want (it doesn't show up).
hit F10 to return to command mode
type "reset"
type "reset" (again)

This apparently activates the COM port.

The slip server should be up by then.

Go to the linux machine and do what the faq on SLIP says.

BTW. I had to disable the loopback device on bootup and just use
sl0 (on linux).

If there is enough interest I can write detailed instructions on
the linux and dos side (for my particular case).

Subject: Routing tables getting corrupted
Date: 3 Dec 1993 04:37:51 GMT

I had originally posted this as problem with the network interface, 
but thanks to help from someone, have isolated my lockup problems to
a corrupted routing table. Heres my situation;

I have about 5 sub-nets on my network.  I set a default gateway on my
Linux box.  When I access the sub-nets, the route gets redirected, and
the correct gateway gets added into the table.  Its doesn't happen
everytime, but many times, the presence of this new route prevents me
from accessing any other network.  I tried adding static routes for all
the sub-nets, but I STILL get a new duplicate route added when I access
a sub-net.  Its almost like the system is not able to use the static
route, defaults to the gateway, and then a identical redirected route
gets added, which appears to mess things up.

I reported problems getting the CD-ROM filesystem in 0.99.13.  Yes, I
double-checked all the obvious things about a clean source tree and so
on.  For what it's worth, these problems don't exist in 0.99.14, so

Subject: backup using floppies
Date: Mon, 29 Nov 1993 16:53:04 -0500

Organization: MDSSC

Need help with backup. I have gone through the linux documentation. The
suggestion to backup the system is using the tar command.

"The easiest way to make a backup using floppies is with tar. The
command


       # tar cvfzM /dev/fd0 /


will make a complete backup of your system using the floppy drive
/dev/fd0.  The "M" option to tar allows the backup to be a mul-
tivolume backup; that is, when one floppy is full, tar will prompt
for the next."

The above quote is from the linux documentation. My question is,

        What format should the floppies be initially formatted in, before I use them
for backup?

Please let me know, either through the net or directly to me at

Wait a couple of days and I will post our syslogd/klogd package to one
of the major archive sites.

This implementation supports both UNIX domain and TCP/IP sockets and
can propagate as well as receive messages to network connected machines.

Works VERY well on our corporate Linux network.  I need to clean up a
couple of gotchas imposed by the PL14 kernel and than I will release
the code.

Erm, why would you want to???  Strikes me as a complete waste of resources and 
time.  If the two machines are on the same LAN, there should be no need to 
send packets out over slip and have them come back again.  Even if you should 
want to do this, you would need to persuade DEMON to change their routing

We are evaluating the possibility to use linux as graphical workstations on
a network (ethernet, tpc/ip).
For both, for safety and for to have minimal work, we would use
diskless pc's, wich were booted from a server (without floppy!).

So my question:

Is it possible to boot linux over a net (with an eprom on the
ethernet card, where can i get such an eprom)?
Has someone experiences with booting linux over the net?

Does someone use linux only as an X-Terminal?
