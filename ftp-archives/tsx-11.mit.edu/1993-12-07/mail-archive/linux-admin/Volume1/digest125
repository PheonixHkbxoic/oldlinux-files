This command seems to be severly broken in all the SLS packages . Forget
about it . Best way to install any additional packages within SLS is
via the menu / Installation / Adding additional Software

this is yet-another-non-linux-question that should not be in the
c.o.l.* areas...sigh.....

to restore the file, boot off the spare boot disk and:
        - stash the existing /etc/passwd and /etc/group
              and /etc/shadow and /etc/gshadow if you have
              shadow passwords so you can look at them
        - copy known good ones from the boot disk to get
                booted off the hard disk.

Assuming you still have your installation disk, boot with it.

Login as root.

# mount -t ext2 [linux root partition] /root
# cd root
# ls

You will see the file 'zImage'.  This is your boot floppy file.
Insert a low level formatted floppy in drive a.

# dd if=zImage of=/dev/fd0 bs=1024

This does a block copy (in 1K blocks) of zImage to your floppy.  That's it.


(More generally, you use the source code and 'make zdisk', but you have to
 have installed the kernel source code, and this is only needed if you want
 to change the kernel)

Crossposted-To: comp.os.linux.help

I realize this may be a faq, but I have looked all over sunsite and
tsx-11 for the answer and can find no help.  I want to install Linux
via the network/NFS option of doinstall.  It asks me for the site and
/.install/ directory and I give it tsx-11's Internet address and the
/pub/linux/packages/SLS directory, but it is not able to mount it.  I
can't even do it via mount -t nfs.. for some reason.  Now I know the
mount -t nfs command is working because I have been able to mount
muarchive's /archive directory from Linux in this state, so I know the
network is not the problem.  It appears the aforementioned tsx-11
directory is not mountable.

Is this an option which has been abandoned practically, but the script
'doinstall' still has it by mistake?

If not, what site address and directory should I give it:
for SLS?
for Slackware? 

Just for future reference, where is there any help on this?

My reason for asking the last question is that if there isn't help
available, I'd like to write a little FAQ for it so no one else has to
go through the same frustration.. If there is help, however, I'd be
interested in how the file organization of tsx-11 and sunsite
prevented me, blind as I am, from being able to find it easily... 

Loading from the Internet would be much preferable to making the
floppies, since I do have Internet access, luckily. 

Thanks for any help.

        Log in as root, go to /usr/bin, vi sysinstall, and change the

        Yup.  Works fine.  An extremely impressive package, although
it runs a bit slow since it's pretty big.  I have 486DX50 and the lack of
speed is pretty noticeable on mine.  With anything less, I'd expect
the speed to be annoying, to say the least.

I had a similar problem with an nec cdr 72 running under OS/2.

  I solved the problem by disabling sync negotiation on my
1542a card.  After I did that, it worked fine for playing audio
cds.  Prior to that, it would read data cd's with errors, and
not recognize audio cds at all.  Now it works fine.  The cdr72
is just the earlier version of the 74.

I got bitten by the same kind of bug, loosing about 40 Mb of files (all
of my user-area... which I luckily backed up just before it happened).
After reinstalling, installing bootutils-0.1.tar.gz directly at the
beginning, my setup ran more stable than before. 

The next thing I saw was, that after adding another partition, this new
partition was almost always checked, even if I did a correct shutdown
(Hey: I'm using UN*X for about five years :-)).  I tracked this down to
some directory inodes being marked as being accessed. I thought: OK
this is a hackers OS, so get hacking. I spent the better part of last
weekend debugging, only to find out:

- There are two bugs in the quota patches included in SLS 1.03 0.99pl12.
- Quota can smoehow not be configured out of the kernel.

So my advice is: get a real 0.99pl13 kernel and maybe your problem won't
happen again. Of course then you don't have the quota-patches included,
but who cares... at the moment. I will of course mail the person doing
the quota stuff of my findings.

BTW: The safest way to do a fsck on a root partition is always using a
bootdisk, (like the one included in the SLS-Distribution) and running
fsck from that on your root-Partition.  Of course you would need the
newest e2fsck from the archives on that disk...

BINGO.  That directory is most likely not exported.  I have set up
a world exported directory that you may use at your own risk for
just the purpose you ask...

al.me.iastate.edu is exporting /SLS to anyone who would like to install

Guten Tag!

Users can access my machines via a dial-in port, using getty 2.0.7b
and the shadow login suite.

I want to enforcer maximal login times for users dialing in. That means:
not only periods of time during the day when they are allowed to log on
but the maximal time they are allowed to be logged on should be limited.

Unfortunately, browsing through the documentations of the above mentioned
package gave me no insight how to reach this. Any idea?

Any information will be appreciated. Thank you for your help!

Hi, 

I just read the Hardware.HOWTO which indicates that the Adaptec 1542 conflicts
with PAS16 because both are bus mastering cards. I have a PAS16 installed on
my system, and am thinking about getting a VLB SCSI card like the BusLogic 445S
or Ultrastor 34F. Would these cards also conflict with the PAS16 sound card
I have?? 

My other choice is to get IDE drives, but that is another post.

Hi,

I have the Gateway 2000 DX2-66V which comes with 2 IDE controllers built-in on
the motherboard. The standard Linux harddisk driver allows me to use the primary
IDE controller to hook upto 2 IDE drives, with the PC standard IRQ=14. I looked
up the GW manual, which stated that the secondary IDE controller uses a
different I/O port base (can't remember off hand), and a different IRQ (15 as I
remember). 

I also looked up the Linux harddisk driver file, which seems to limit the number
of IDE drives to 2. My question is how can I enable this secondary IDE
controller so that I can hookup the 3rd and the 4th IDE drive in my system under
Linux? Is there a modified driver that will allow me to do that, and where
can I get it??

Please advice.
Thanks -- John
