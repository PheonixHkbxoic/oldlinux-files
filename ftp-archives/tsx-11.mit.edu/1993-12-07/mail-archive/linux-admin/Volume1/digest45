"IMP Data" (Swedish reseller)  15"             I paid 100$    
        PROBS   No cable delievered with it. Soldered it myself.
        ATTRIBS It isn't steady (which is why it was cheap).

        PROBS   Connects with RGB + Vsync + Hsync coaxials. No cable
                included.

                broken picture
                distortion correction circuits. (Should be quite easy to
                fix when
                I get to it but if works quite well anyway). Anyway ever

        PROBS   Seems to have a under sized power supply. the size of the
                image get smaller as more white(bright) is displayed.

                Works 
                fine with standard timings
        ATTRIBS Cheap, small, low refresh rate.  Bottom of the line.

        PROBS   This is a "tri-sync" not a multi-sync.  I therefore can't
                safely mess with the timing (not an issue with X8514)
        ATTRIBS Tri-sync is a little strange.
                every other line in a xterm window will be tall or short
                for example
                a : on one line will have the dots very close the next
                line (after a 
                scroll) they will be far apart.  This may be an X problem
                since I 
                remeber it under ms-windows.

        ATTRIBS I like the price
                I don't like the image quality at the right and left
                screen borders,
                and it seems not to be very tolerant in the sync puls
                timings.
                Documentation was not very good for configuring X
                (timings missing)

        ATTRIBS Cheapo duff monitor. Upgrading to a better (and bigger)
                monitor
                would extract much more performance from the card, I
                feel.

        PROBS   Initially none. Recently there seem to be synchronisation
                problems
                when the hardware is "cold". I've not yet been able to
                locate them  
                (since I'm planning on upgrade the entire video block, it
                seems like
                a waste of time to investigate it further).
        ATTRIBS There's a serious distortion near the vertical edges of
                the screen.
                In graphical modes, changing the color of an object has
                quite noticalble
                impact to the size of the image. I'm looking into buying
                a good 17"
                monitor to accompany the abovementioned ATI GUP.

Citizen Pro14i                 14"             $1300, new, in

                (interlaced at 1024x768). Runs 800x600 at 70 Hz,
                adequate.

CrystalScan 1024NI             14" :-(         ?              
        ATTRIBS Hard to look at fonts smaller than 10x20, but that's
                probably due
                to the monitor size.  10x20 is slightly fuzzy.

                the
                room is too big for my desk.

                have enough span in settings.

        ATTRIBS Very crisp display. Uses microprocessor control so all
                modes can be
                stretched to fit the FST tube, so I get MUCH more screen
                real estate
                than a regular 14" monitor.
                It's a bit slow responding to mode changes, loses sync
                for a second.

                Specs say
                it's good to 1024x768, but I've successfully pushed it to
                1280x1024,
                with a little veritcal shrinking.

        ATTRIBS Monitor is only edge to edge in Y dimension.  Would prefer
                one that is also
                edge to edge in X dimension.

        ATTRIBS Gives me a headache when using resolutions over 640x480.
                (But it was cheap...)
                I only use higher resolutions when previewing TeX dox,
                using xfig,
                or something similar.

                cheap.
        ATTRIBS It has ALL controls, and, they are ALL placed in front
                where I can
                get to them.  It has excellent crispness, and, it fits
                nicely in
                the cubbyhole I have for a monitor.

                windows

Eizo/Nanao F550i-M             17in (max. 15.6 DM 2300.-      
        ATTRIBS Moire patterns, but they can be removed by tuning the size
                of the
                screen.  The monitor memorizes up to 30 different
                settings and detects
                them automatically, syncs horiz 30-65 kHz, vert. 55-90Hz
                and beeps,
                when video signal is out of specs (NO harm!). Adjusting
                screen size to
                remove moire patterns can reduce visible screen size
                considerably!
                Other than that, the picture is sharp and clear, and the
                colors good,
                and with the high refresh rate (>= 77Hz) rock solid.

                can't quite sync
                at 1024x768 resolution.  It should be able to do it in
                interlaced mode,
                but I haven't been able to get the Xconfig incantation
                right.

        ATTRIBS The horizontal sync isn't high enough at 38Khz. This is
                the biggest
                drawback. Also, it tends to 'smear' at high clock rates
                (due to low
                overall bandwith).
