Hi,
   I haven't been reading news lately, and I hope this is the right place to 
post this. I'm trying to set up my linux box to our JetDirect 
equipped LaserJet 4siMX, which, as far as I know, will act as an lpd. So, I 
think I should be able to print to it. I have the HP Unix CD for It, but so 
far it doesn't look like it has the answer for me. 

Has anyone gotten a system like this working?

TIA.

Stephen.

I accidentally erased /tmp/.X11-unix/X0 and I'm having trouble

likely reinstall XFree to get the socket back, but I'm curious!

Hi.

 We are experiencing some problems with the talk that comes with the
 distribution package for SLS .
 After the talk <whoever> is executed, it goes well for ringing the
 party...
 But, after the first "[Ringing your party again]", it just gives 
 "Alarm clock" and then aborts straight away.
 Any suggestions as to what i should do? (or is there a new version
 of the talk program? )
 Thanks for your help.

Date: 18 Nov 1993 19:28:00 GMT


Guten Tag!

During a major upgrade session on weekend I installed the kernel 0.99.13 and
libs 4.4.4. Everything seems to work fine, except the fact that programs
refuse to dump core.

That's good news, you say.

Not really: Those programs are buggy and cause segmentation faults and other
nasty problems. After a segmentation fault I do not find a "core" or
"core.<progname>" file anywhere. Moreoever, in the message "Segmentation
fault" the usual "core dumped" is omitted.

Does anybody else experience that problem? How can I get rid of it?

Some experiments have shown that the new kernel is the problem. Going back to
older libraries does not change anything. Switching back to an older kernel
(pl11) makes me happy again with lots of cores!

My next thought was that the quota and job accounting patches may be
responsible. I unpacked a pure kernel and quickly compiled it and still
experienced missing core files.

Any information will be appreciated! Vielen Dank im voraus!

Agreed.  However, (and I noticed this when running 386BSD) after a
while of using (or abusing, take your pick) :) the FFS, adding and
deleting files, etc., not much else aside from fragments is available
for new files, and one cannot create 'large' files anymore without
newfs'ing the filesystem.  To me, that's a disadvantage.

Nope.. I don't forgot it.. I tried it many times, but I coudn't get shell
from that script. Becaus it is working like shell (defined in passwd).
If user like to interupt that script he/she can press CTRL-C, and that
script bounces back login.

I've been trying to get X windows up and running when for some unknown reason,
my mouse driver seems to have gotten wedged.  Trying to run startx or

There must be a way out of this problem, or so I hope.  I've tried everything

Please help!

Since there seems to be some interest, I will go ahead and post this.
Here is a shell-script filter for printing simple text files on
LaserJets.  It does essentially the same thing as
wescott@spectrum.cs.bucknell.edu's C-language script (i.e., prints in
brain-dead, default font and spacing mode).  The things you need to do
to use the script are:

1. Make sure your /bin/sh is actually bash, so you can use echo -ne
2. Put the filter script file in a sensible place (I use /usr/lib/lpf).
3. Do a chmod on the filter script file so that it is world-executable.
4. Point to the script file using the "if=" statement in /etc/printcap.

If someone is interested in changing the font or spacing, email
me with your specific need and I will try to come up with a customized
script.  For more info, grab the "Printing How-to" documentation from
the docs section under Linux on sunsite.

============ cut here ========================
#!/bin/sh
# We assume that /bin/sh is really "bash", so we can use echo -ne
# First, reset the printer to its defaults 
echo -ne \\033\E
# Avoid stairstepping --- convert "LF" to "CR+LF"
echo -ne \\033\&k2G
# Print the text 
cat
# Issue a form feed
echo -ne \\f
# Reset the printer on exit
echo -ne \\033\E

=============== cut here =====================

There is also available on sunsite a LaserJet version of "enscript",
which does 2-up, landscape mode printing with fairly nice page
formatting.  It is actually a perl script that generates the necessary
PCL commands, avoiding the need to convert to postscript and invoke
ghostscript for printing.  Instead, you use the perl script as a bogus
"cif" filter, and then do the printing using the "lpr -c" command.
Works like a charm.  If you're interested, grab the file sqprint.c
from the /pub/Linux/system/Printing directory.

Happy printing!

According to the McKusick, Joy, et al. paper on the FFS, if you
are in a situation in which your disk is "mostly fragments", you
cannot create any large files because your disk is "mostly full". A
newfs would fix this problem by erasing the contents of the disk. :-)

The FFS will always allocate fragments from already fragmented blocks
in the same cylinder group, if possible. Fragments will only be used
for the last few bytes of a file, never for anything else.

Generally, the performance of the FFS should stay constant over time.
The performance of more traditional Unix filesystems goes down as the
file system is used and it fragments.

Linux has its advantages over BSD, but the lack of FFS is not one of
them.

  Look in /etc/host.conf.  It should look like this:  [Indenting mine]

        order bind hosts

  If you have the hosts before the bind (and probably "multi off"), you

Or even worse: Once in a while, while disconnecting, it trashes the

  If you have a bus-mouse and selection is running, then you will need to kill
selection first.  selection won't release a bus-mouse.  It does for serial
