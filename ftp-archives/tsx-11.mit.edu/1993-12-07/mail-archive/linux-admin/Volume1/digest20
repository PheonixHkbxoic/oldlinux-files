Precisely why I said to *multiply* *by* 26*26.  Learn to read.

So if you tried, say, ten possibilities a second, in the worst-case
you'd get the password in something like 170,000 years.  BUT, if you
make the (reasonable) assumption that there's at least one password
that's all lower case and, say, exacly 6 chars long, your chances
improve drastically.  If you further assume that you don't need to
guess any >one< password, but just >any< password out of a list of 150
in /etc/passwd, the worst-case drops to less than a month.  And if you
now use 10 computers, you'd likely have an answer in a few days.

So, there are two possibilities.  Either make sure users use >very<
hard to guess passwords (like "UUwb3QbN") or use /etc/shadow, and just
make sure users don't use stupid passwords (like "password" or "test").

Subject: SUMMARY: Ringback
Date: Thu, 26 Aug 1993 03:11:14 GMT

Ok, I had some problems and two peoples posts combined helped solve it.

Dave Bullis ave@sillub.ocunix.on.ca gave me on part of it, it seems that my
Hayes is not fast enough to keep up with the computer, and was ignoring the
ATA my Dell kept throwing at it, so the following line for ATA paused ATA
(using /pATA) enough that my modem could read it.

CONNECT="" \pATA\r CONNECT\s\A

Unfortunetly this was only part of the problem, now my modem was cheerfully
answering the phone... on the second ring.  Not waiting for any sort of
ringback.  So the obvious answer is changing the settings on how long a
pause inbetween rings is, and what the default time space is.  

Mike D. mdickey@sage.cc.purdue.edu gave my the following settings for
uugetty.ttyS? 

MINRBTIME=7
MAXRBTIME=21
INTERRING=6
MINRINGS=1
MAXRINGS=2

And they work just fine. :-)  I would recommend increasing MAXRBTIME if you
are going to be calling LD using a credit card, as this is too short for the
computer to recognize a ringback (of course your girlfriend calling, letting
it ring, hanging it up, and dialing 10 seconds later is going to get an
earfull of modem-noise :-( ).

Thanks for everyones help!

Why do you need BBS software? If you run Linux all you need is a shell
to get to elm, tin, and something for a file section? I use the menu
that came with Linux and utree for the file section. It works.

If it matters, I am also writing my "BBS" program (more like a
collection of BBS-like utilities) to support automatic addition of new
users, color, etc.. Look for in a few months.

One of the main reasons is that you'd want some type of protection mechanism
for accessing either files for downloading and/or newsgroup reading.  I'm sure
that you wouldn't want kids getting onto your bbs and downloading files/messages
from alt.bin.pic.erotica.* or getting into discussions on the alt.sex.* tree
either.

I'm running Uniboard right now, and have had some good responces so far.  I do
have the ability to limit newsgroup access (yep, i get over 2100 newsgroups on
my Linux system at home -- thank god for WorldBlazers and TurboPep.)  One
of the drawbacks so far is file transfers; I need to get some of the protocol
sources and recompile them.

p.s.  If you need an ftp address for uniboard, let me know...

I have found my problems with the nfs I have been having.... but I
didn't like what I found...  my nfsd changes ownership on the fly....
upon bootup it is owned by one user, a few seconds later a different
user.....  really weird expierence...   anyway, has anyone else had  similar problems with Linux 0.99.pl9-1?

Subject: Peculiar e2fs problem
Date: Thu, 26 Aug 1993 15:20:50 GMT

I suddenly got this very peculiar problem yesterday:  
   I booted as usual from LILO and got login prompt. But other file
systems were not mounted.  When I tried to mount them manually (after
logging in as root), I got the error 'cannot create /etc/mtab'. I could
edit /etc/passwd and save it peacefully. Verified that the permissions
to directory /etc are proper.  (i.e. owned by bin, rwx for bin and rx
for others.  I did 'touch /etc/mtab; touch /etc/mtab~', and tried to
mount again. It said 'only supervisor can mount'. 'id' gave me proper
value of id=0, gid=0.

I used another partition to boot, and I could mount this partition and
access all the files!  I tried e2fsck on that partition. There was one
error (which I forgot) which it corrected. However, same things 
repeated, plus, it could not open tty's for writing.(So no login prompt
also.) I did e2fsck again on that partition (after again logging from
another partition) and this time it just quit without doing anything and
without giving any message also. 

I am really surprised! But I can access this faulty partition as usual 
after booting from another partition!

(I have still retained the partition, if anyone requires any info which
I can get by using dd and send.)

-Vinod.

PS. I am bit confused whether it should be posted to admin or
development (or help)! Someone please comment!
