Probably because it was using the old getty and not getty_ps.

Mail me if it still doesn't work as I'd be interested to know what it is.

Peter modified the SLS version of getty_ps to accept them in either order.
He's posted that before.

There shouldn't be any reason why dump is restricted to the BSD FFS.

I've used both dump and tar to make backups (onto floppies, sadly), and
essentially the difference is that dump does an image backup whereas
tar does it file-by-file.  For me, file-by-file is a bit easier to
handle, and I suspect that's true for most users.

If you want an image dump, yuou could do a 'dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/rmt?'
or whatever, no backup software really needed.

Not to denigrate Tom's contribution to the BBS world, but in contrast to
MS-DOS based BBS systems, waffle is pathetic.  But so is damn near every other
BBS system I've seen for unix.  Even the free ones for MS-DOS are miles
ahead of the best that unix has to offer.  With RIP graphics now available,
MS-DOS BBS systems are pulling even farther ahead.

Most unix-based BBS systems don't even have curses-based menus... :(

Sigh.  "It reads the raw disk" means that it doesn't use the filesystem.  It
*knows* what the filesystem looks like on disk.  Therefore it only works with
the FFS; Linux versions would have to be written for (at the least) minix,
ext2fs, and xiafs.

>I've used both dump and tar to make backups (onto floppies, sadly), and

Not really, it's a variant of a generic tape-oriented filesystem.  It has an
inode table at the front and files afterward, but the format doesn't match the
BSD FFS or any other filesystem.

Subject: LINUX HARDWARE POLL
Date: 28 Aug 1993 19:54:13 -0700

Distribution: world



    I'm interested in knowing what kind of hardware configurations people are
using under Llinux.  Specifically, ethernet controller, hard disk controller,  
serial port board if applicable, etc....  Not only what hardware works (which
you can get out of the FAQ), but also how well it works... cavets or lack of,
speed, stability... which is not in the FAQ.

    It occurs to me that many other people would be interested in this  
information as well so I have decided to conduct an email poll on it.

    If you have time, please fill out the below form and email it to  
poll@moonshot.west.oic.com ... do NOT respond to the net!  I will post the  
complete results after one week of information collection (next saturday).


============================= snip snip snip ===========================

     POLL ON LINUX HARDWARE CONFIGURATIONS, I/O BOARDS, AND PERCEPTIONS

A.  This is a poll on linux hardware configurations, I/O boards, and your 
    perceptions as to the reliability of same.  If you are a Linux user with
    knowledge of the hardware configuration of your machine then this poll is
    for you!

B.  If you have time, please answer the below questions and send the results
    to:

                        poll@moonshot.west.oic.com

    POLL ENDS ON SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 4 1993 12:00 HOURS AT WHICH TIME I WILL
    POST THE RESULTS TO COMP.OS.LINUX.MISC.  COMPLETE RESULTS WILL BE AVAILABLE
    VIA FTP.  ALL RESPONSES WILL BE KEPT PRIVATE (EMAIL HEADERS WILL ALL BE
    REMOVED)

    If you do not have the answer to all the questions, please fill in those
    answers that you do have!  This poll is being conducted by Matthew Dillon,
    dillon@moonshot.west.oic.com .  Please email poll answers to

                        poll@moonshot.west.com

0.  How would you categorize yourself?  Mark appropriate boxes.  This will help
    me organize the answers and my comments to them.

    0A. [ ] Joe end user with little technical knowledge and little application
            knowledge (i.e. only used a few commercial applications in
            your lifetime).  Hint: if you check this box maybe you shouldn't
            be filling out this survey!

            (i.e. hardware knowledge)

    0C. [ ] end user with a reasonable amount of ability installing boards and
            using applications but not much on programming languages (shell,
            interpreted, or compiled).

    0D. [ ] power user who knows his way around PC boxes and maybe knows
            something about programming, but not so much about UNIX.

    0E. [ ] power user who has no problem with hardware and can even write
            shell scripts and modify text files in /etc without too much
            havoc.

    0F. [ ] expert UNIX user

    0G. [ ] expert UNIX user, reasonable operating systems / machine management
            skills.

    0H. [ ] power expert UNIX user - highly skilled in most things.

    0I. [ ] UNIX guru - highly skilled in all things, experience modifying
            kernel code, writing device drivers... can pick up random source
            code you've never seen before and hack on it, etc...  Can become
            an expert on a program after ten minutes of fiddling with it.

    0J. [ ] UNIX god - 0I + over 1000 hours of kernel hacking, includes network
            protocol hacking but not system level hacking.  Also must have
            posted at least one clandestine message to the internet (mail or
            news) in his/her lifetime and be able to become root on any machine
            he/she has an account on (in order to fix problems, of course!).
            Also must have crashed the kernel while hacking at least two dozen
            times (or you aren't on the leading edge :-)).

1.  What type of machine do you have?

    1A. Brand   (e.g. Dell)             ->
    1B. Cpu     (e.g. 486DX2/66)        ->

    1J. If available, please give an approximate price for this platform NOT
        including any additional boards you might have purchased for it.
        PLEASE INDICATE WHAT I/O BOARDS, IF ANY, CAME WITH THE PLATFORM.  I
        am specifically interested in hard disk, video, and ethernet boards.

    ->
    ->
    ->
    ->

2.  What brand of physical hard drive do you have? (the bare drive, not the
    controller.  Do not answer this question if you have a hard-card):

    2A. Brand (e.g. Quantum, Fujitsu..) ->
    2B. Approximate price of bare drive ->
    2C. Please comment on any hardware specific problems you might have had
        and the reliability of the drive itself.

3.  What type and brand of hard drive controller do you have?  Note that ISA
    cards can be stuck into EISA busses (reason for question #3B).  THIS
    QUESTION APPLIES ONLY TO CARDS, NOT TO MOTHERBOARD-BASED CONTROLLERS.

    3A. Type (e.g. SCSI, IDE, STANDARD) ->
    3B. Approximate price               ->
    3C. Bus Interface (e.g. EISA, ISA)  ->

        and the reliability of the card itself (if you can discern between
        drive reliability and card reliability :-))
    ->
    ->
    ->
    ->

4.  What are your perceptions as to the speed of your disk controller?  The
    two categories will help separate out power user from joe user perceptions.

        impressions of BOTH controllers, and list the second controller.

    ->
    ->
    ->
    ->

    5H. Please comment on any installation problems you might have had
        installing the board.  This includes dip switches, kernel patches you
        may have had to made, and Xconfig problems beyond the normal dumb
        stuff.  Please differentiate between problems installing the board so
        the system would boot using it and problems installing the board to
        make it run under X-Windows (or other graphical environment).

    ->
    ->
    ->
    ->

6.  Questions related to your physical screen, only if you have a multi-sync
    and run it in a high resolution graphics mode (i.e. under X-Windows or
    other graphical environment under Linux).

    6A. What brand of monitor?          ->
    6B. Approximate price               ->
    6C. Size, in inches (or approx)     ->
    6D. Please comment on any problems you may have had interfacing the
        monitor to your video board, leave blank if you did not have any
        problems (most people will not have had any problems!)

    ->
    ->
    ->
    ->

    6E. Please comment on special attributes of the monitor you like or dislike
        (e.g. has a nice stand, display exceptionally dull, etc...)

    ->
    ->
    ->
    ->

7.  Questions related to your ethernet adapter, if you use one.

    7A. What brand of adaptor?          ->
    7B. Approximate price               ->
    7C. Bus interface (EISA, ISA, ...)  ->
    7D. Please comment on any installation problems you might have had
        installing the board, including having to change default IRQ,
        Kernel reconfigurations, etc.  If you had any difficulties getting
        packets to start running across it beyond the normal dumb stuff,
        please comment on them.  Do not comment on difficulties getting
        ifconfig or routing setup unless they are hardware-related.

    ->
    ->
    ->
    ->

    7E. Ethernet boards all run at about the same speed, but if you have done
        any comparisons and found any significant differences, please comment
        on them below!  DMA *can* make a small difference though at
        10 MBits/sec even ISA DMA doesn't have much of a problem.

Atleast with the SPARC machines I've used all thats required is a
.rhosts file in the directory of the user you want to rsh into. 
However they have all used SUN OS I don't know is solaris is any
different.

...yes. If using the kmem stuff, change the define in the sources
for ps-0.99.11 that points to System and set it to zSystem. Then
recompile it. Or just specify the full path to the zSystem file
to `ps -U' If you are using the proc versions, there is a program
included in there to update /etc/psdatabase -- it is discussed in
