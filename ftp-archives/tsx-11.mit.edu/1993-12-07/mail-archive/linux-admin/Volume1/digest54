The SLS Anti-Defamation Society is still trying to convince everyone to stop
mentioning SLS bugs, I see.  It's far better to hurt Linux by making it look
like a buggy piece of sh*t than it is to say anything even remotely bad about
the SLS distribution, obviously.

NOT.

Get a clue already.

As for Unix editors, take a look at joe (it comes with the SLS distribution).
It uses WordStar style keys (^K^B to mark blocks, etc)

Talk, telnet and rlogin (mostly talk) sometimes decide to start dumping
core...and don't stop until the disk is full (about 100 megs).  I've seen
other people talking about these big core dumps, but does anyone know what
causes them and how to fix them?  Also, I have trouble getting in ftp
from a linux machine in binary modem; usually fails with "illegal seek".  
I'd like to fix these problems because I often come back to my machine
and find the disk full with a 100 meg core dump.  Thanks..

Date: 12 Sep 1993 17:25:55 GMT

I have been working with the system call 'times' which is suposto return
the user and system times in a buffer. Well, I have trying to characterize
a convolution routine for image processing. I have noticed that when I
surround a piece of code with two calls to times and subtract the results
that I get a time which is significantly larger than the user time reported
by the time shell command. Im using the user time from the structure tms
as indicated by the manual page. The times reported by times() are about
80% larger than the user time reported by the time command. I have converted
the time to seconds by dividing by 60.
Can anyone shed some light on my problem? Which is more accurate, and why
the difference?

Sigh.  There ***ARE*** problems with SLS.  They haven't been corrected
over time, even though bug reports have been filed.  SLS is a good
base, but it has lots of security problems (some things compiled to
use shadow, others do not).  There are permission problems for people
that are used to DOS.  Some of the utilities are duplicated.  Some are
slow to update.

That said, however, I must agree that SLS is the best that is
currently available (I haven't tried Slackware yet) for the niche that
it fills.  Just because I'm not 100% happy with it doesn't mean that I
give up the right to point out problems that I see with it.  It is a
stable system, for me, and I've been able to get real work done using
it.  I have had to tweak a lot to get the system to the point that I
like it.  I shouldn't have had to do half of the stuff that I did to
get it to where it is on my system today.  I've found that it is a
very good base to work from, despite its flaws.

Err, ummmm, that's the point.  We'd like to change it, but we can't
distribute the changes at all, due to Peter's stance wrt modification
and redistribution of SLS.  Look at what Slackware is having to do to
be able to distribute their stuff.

Use the command :-

        tar cvMf /dev/fd0h1440 ./*

from the directory you want to start the backup from. The 'M' option is the
important bit which tells tar to use multi-volume support.

You use 'tar xvMf /dev/fd0h1440' to read the files back again.

This has two major drawbacks....
a) There will be floods of mails like "I can't compile xboing. I have SLS
with a few thrown in goodies of my own". This is really no bug report!

b) (The more impiortant one)...

Hi, this is your form to report bugs. PLease do it!

Can you describe the bug? --> the mail program is broken and sends all

The Linux HOWTO Index 
Matt Welsh, <mdw@sunsite.unc.edu>
=============================================================================
Last Modified 6 September 1993

This is an introduction and index to the Linux HOWTO documents. 

0. What are Linux HOWTOs?

        Linux HOWTOs are short online documents which describe in detail
        a certain aspect of configuring or using the Linux system. For 
        example, there is the Installation HOWTO, which gives instructions
        on installing Linux, and the Mail HOWTO, which describes how to
        set up and configure mail under Linux. Other examples include the
        NET-2-HOWTO (previously the NET-2-FAQ) and the Linux-vs-386BSD HOWTO.

        Information in HOWTOs is generally more detailed and in-depth than
        what can be squeezed into the Linux FAQ. For this reason, the
        Linux FAQ is being rewritten. A large amount of the information
        contained therein will be relegated to various HOWTO documents.
        The FAQ will be a shorter list of frequently asked questions about 
        Linux, covering small specific topics. Most of the ``useful'' 
        information in the FAQ will now be covered in the HOWTOs. 

        HOWTOs are comprehensive docs---much like an FAQ but generally not
        in question-and-answer format. However, many HOWTOs contain an FAQ
        section at the end. For example, the NET-2-FAQ has been renamed to
        the NET-2-HOWTO, because it wasn't in question-and-answer format. 
        However, you will see the NET-2-HOWTO named as the NET-2-FAQ in many
        places. The two docs are one and the same.


1. Where to get Linux HOWTOs

        HOWTOs can be retrieved via anonymous FTP from the following
        sites:

                sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO

                tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/docs/HOWTO

        The Index, printed below, lists the currently available HOWTOs.

        HOWTOs are also posted regularly to the newsgroups comp.os.linux
        and comp.os.linux.announce. In addition, a number of the HOWTOs
        will be crossposted to news.answers. Therefore, you can find the
        Linux HOWTOs on the news.answers archive site rtfm.mit.edu.


2. HOWTO Index
        
        The following Linux HOWTOs are currently available. The list
        is small, because this is a relatively new project. 

        * INSTALLATION HOWTO. How to obtain and install Linux. This is the
          first document which a Linux newcomer should read. It discusses
          how to obtain Linux, both from the Internet and via Snail-mail,
          and how to install it. Focuses primarily on the SLS distribution
          of Linux, which is the current de facto standard.

        * Linux INFO-SHEET. A general technical introduction to Linux,
          listing its features, supported hardware, and other general
          information. 

        * Linux META-FAQ. A list of sources of information about Linux,
          such as documentation, newsgroups, FTP sites, and so on.

        * NET-2 HOWTO. Describes how to install and configure the Linux NET-2 
          TCP/IP code, in kernels 0.99.pl10 and above. (This has nothing 
          to do with the so-called BSD NET-2 distribution.) Discusses various
          aspects of TCP/IP networking under Linux, including the use of SLIP.
          The complete instruction manual for TCP/IP under Linux.
        
        * Ethernet HOWTO. A HOWTO about the various Ethernet device drivers
          which are available for Linux. Should be read along with the NET-2
          HOWTO by anyone using Ethernet for TCP/IP on Linux.

        * Mail HOWTO. All about configuration of electronic mail with Linux,
          including UUCP and TCP/IP mailers such as Smail and sendmail.

        * UUCP HOWTO. How to configure UUCP to transfer files, mail, and
          news to other UNIX machines on a UUCP-based connection. Includes
          discussion of Taylor UUCP for Linux.
        
        * News HOWTO. Setup and configuration of news software, such as 
          C News, INN, and newsreaders (such as rn and tin) under Linux.


        WANTED. I would be very happy if someone would write the following 
        HOWTO documents, and submit them to me (see the instructions in
        the next section below). Most of these are modifications of existing
        FAQ documents, and should be easy to put into HOWTO format. Keep in
        mind that HOWTOs generally aren't in FAQ format, but can contain an
        FAQ section at the end.

        Some of these are under construction; however, if you're interested
        in working on one of them, please let me know.

        * GCC/LIBRARY HOWTO. Discussing installation/upgrading of the GCC 
          and shared libraries under Linux. How to build shared libraries.
          Most of the material would come from Mitchum DeSouza's GCC FAQ. 

        * KERNEL HOWTO. How to upgrade and compile the kernel. Basic kernel
          tweaking, including how to turn on debugging output. How to decrypt
          panic messages. Basic introduction to kernel structure and hacking.
          (Under constructions, mdw@sunsite.unc.edu).
        
        * PRINTING HOWTO. How to install and use printing software such as
          lp/lpr on your system. How to configure /etc/printcap for
          various types of printers. Information can come from existing
          Printer and LPR FAQs. (Under construction.)

        * SCSI HOWTO. All of the ins and outs about SCSI drivers for Linux. 

        * SERIAL HOWTO. All of the ins and outs about serial communications
          under Linux, including use of getty for dialins. Perhaps a section
          on FAX software.

        * X WINDOWS HOWTO. How to install and configure XFree86 under Linux.
          Much of this is general, not Linux-specific, but the current
          XFree86 documentation consists mostly READMEs which most new users 
          don't understand. What hardware is supported, tweaking the Xconfig
          file, getting xdm to work, and so on. (Under construction, 
          mdw@sunsite.unc.edu).


3. Writing and submitting a HOWTO

        If you would like to write a Linux HOWTO document, there are a few
        guidelines that you should follow. 

        * Format the document neatly. HOWTOs must be available in plain 
          ASCII format, but you are free to use a formatting tool (texinfo,
          LameTeX, nroff) to format the document. Try to use meaningful
          structure and organization, and write clearly. Remember that
          many of the people reading HOWTOs do not speak English as their
          first language.

        * Make sure that all of the information is correct. I can't stress
          this enough. When in doubt, speculate, but make it clear that
          you're only guessing. 

        * Make sure that you are covering the most recent version of the
          available software. Also, be sure to include full instructions
          on where software can be downloaded from (FTP site name, full
          pathname). 

        * Include an FAQ section at the end, if appropriate. Many HOWTO
          documents need an "FAQ" or "Common Problems" section to cover
          information which can't be covered in the regular text.

        * Use other HOWTOs as a model. It is nice to have a common look and
          feel to HOWTO documents--- this document being an example. The
          easier the HOWTO is to browse, the more useful it will be to
          readers.


        After you have written the HOWTO, mail it to me (Matt Welsh) at
        mdw@sunsite.unc.edu. I am the HOWTO coordinator---I will look 
        over the HOWTO, and make any editorial remarks. I will also take
        care of approving and posting the HOWTO to the various newsgroups
        and uploading the HOWTO to the FTP archive sites. Of course,
        all credit for the HOWTO will go to the author.

        It is important that you go through me when submitting a HOWTO. I
        maintain the HOWTO archives and need to keep track of what HOWTOs
        are being written and who is doing what. If you don't submit a
        HOWTO to me, I can't include it in the archive or add it to the
        HOWTO INDEX. 

        I can also help to reformat the HOWTO if needed to make it look
        nicer. :) Once I have approved the HOWTO, I will post it and
        upload it to the FTP sites. I will also send you (the author) 
        the "final" version of the HOWTO with any changes. All you have
        to do is send me periodic updates (every month or so, as needed)
        and I will take care of posting the HOWTO regularly. 


3. Miscellaneous and Legalese
