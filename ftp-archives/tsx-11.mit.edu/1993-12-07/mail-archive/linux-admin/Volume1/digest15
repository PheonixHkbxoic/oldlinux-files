Not to change the subject, but does anyone remember the old way of hacking 
passwords?  In my old hacking days, for the fun of it, I would put a watch
on tty's.  When a user would try to login in at one of the terminals on 
campus, my account would send a fake login: and password: prompt to them.
They would obviously type there info in, then I would send them a 
login failed, and give them back the real prompts.  I am pretty sure that 
the permissions in Linux do not allow this, but that's what we did in the old
days.

EEEK- forgot about that.  So the real point is to prevent access to the
passwd file or to have the encrypted passwords in another non-readable
file.  I have resisted using shadow for many years due to the same
"I like quicky editing the psswd file" reason as some others have.
I have so many users and so many changes, that even one extra step can be
painful.  But security *IS* more important, even on a system such as mine
where is would be difficult to even access the /etc/passwd file.  I
will reconsider our non-use the use of shadow mechanism.

Well, I wan't really responding directly to your post, but rather the

Hmm, this would assume that you, as a normal user, had access to inserting
an offending executable program into the target user's path.  This is 
unlikely is the system were set up properly.

The other way, to run a background task interfacing to their terminal should
also not be possible in a well set-up system as the normal users should not
have write/read access to terminal port devices not in use.

   There is still the possibility of trojan horses of a simpler sort
that you just run directly on your terminal to give a login
prompt.  This is dangerous because any user can think that up,
and it works much of the time too!  Very short and easy - less
than a page of C code can get you lots of passwords.
   This is not a concern for home users of Linux, because one
would have to have access to the box, but what about in a
shared-workstation environment like most universities?
   I don't know how to get around this in general, but one
thing that would help would be to use xdm.  To make
a trojan horse that would fool someone in this environment would
require getting and hacking the xdm source code.  Much tougher
to do for a normal user.

   NT tries to improve security by catching the interrupt that
CTRL-ALT-DEL generates, and disallowing user processes to catch
that interrupt themselves.  Doing a trojan horse of NT would not
(shouldn't at least ;-) be possible while NT was running.

Could this be done for Linux?  Would it be worth it?  A user
could sit down at a Linux box and hit CTRL-ALT-DEL after
a banner, to get the login prompt.  They could then be sure
that if Linux was indeed running, that this was not a trojan
horse.

Comments anyone?

Ah, you're asking for a secure attention key. I hacked one up for pl9 
(it would need to be changed to fit the new keyboard code, plus I'd have 
to make diffs, etc. My sources are a mess lately). Just bind a key to 
do a vhangup on the tty (I know there is SAK code in the serial driver, 
but it uses kill -9 on the processes, which isn't as elegant a solution, 
'badly' backgrounded processes would get killed then too, not just lose
tty access).

I don't know much about the new keyboard code, but I'll take a look 
at hacking it in for that (no promises, I'm already deluged with stuff 
to do, and my IDE drive has a bad sector, and might be losing some more 
still ;( ).

Hi,

Does anyone have sample DIP scripts which they could send me?  I'm trying to
write a script to start SLIP on our CISCO souter, but things are, alas, 
less than perfect".

BTW, should one send "\n" or "\r\n" to emulate pressing return in term mode?
Furthermore, "send slip 132.xxx.yyy.zzz" gives an incorrect usage error for
some reason.

Thanks for your help,
Mark

Date: Mon, 23 Aug 1993 05:51:19 GMT

Thanks, I can now do both at last!
My post stated:
: | I am having SCO and linux both on same disk on different partitions.
: | Has anyone configured LILO to boot SCO? 
: | Please  mail me the config file.

: | I also would like to have a common partition  between SCO and DOS
                                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^
I should have written SCO and Linux! I did receive right answers though.

: | containing user's home directories. Can you recommend any 
: | common file system? Which file system  recommended? (Apart from MSDOG ...)  
: | I am trying to go in for Xenix.

Booting of SCO: LILO should be installed as MBR. And one of the entries
should be:

boot=/dev/hda
...
other = /dev/hda4
        label = sco 
        table = /dev/hda

It didnot work if LILO was installed as boot sector of Linux partition
(and using DOS MBR). 

I have just received xenixfs patches, to the kernel code of .99.8. I
could not find them in both sunsite/tsx-11. I am yet to compile them -
they need to be converted to C++.

(My special thanks to  Anthony Wesley <awesley@canb.auug.org.au> who
sent me both the above information.)  If I can successfully get some
local C++ guru, I will place the diffs against the latest kernel in
sunsite.  It may take some time though.

As Wm E. Davidsen Jr (davidsen@sixhub.UUCP) wrote, there may be
performance issues - especially because there are no mkfs, fsck for
xenixfs in Linux, I need to see the implications.

Well, I'd still debate the use of a "cray", but in essence this is
correct; if you do not use passwords devived from dictionary words or
personal information, a cracker's last remaining resorts are:

1) outre' guessing ("what's the SA's wife's pet hamster called ?
Footles ? Let's try that...")

2) so-called "brute force)"

- which is why I ripped a lot of code out of the ongoing Crack-v5
effore and turned it into CrackLib; a library routine to check
passwords against a specially compressed dictionary, to see if it's
crackable.

The latest release of "shadow" supports CrackLib. If I (ever) can
afford the homebox I specc'ed up, I'll do up a suite and archive it.

Wrong! (well, sort of)

Crack will take dictionary words (eg: foobar) and try:

foobar
raboof
foobarfoobar
raboofraboof
foobarraboof
rabooffoobar
FOOBAR
Foobar
foobaR
f00bar
F00BAR
FBR

It's already there; look up the "Secure Attention Key".  When enabled, it kill
-9's all processes on the current terminal/VT; getty takes over from there if
it's still enabled, so you can log in from a known secure state.  (Assuming
nobody replaced /etc/init or /etc/getty with a Trojan horse....)
