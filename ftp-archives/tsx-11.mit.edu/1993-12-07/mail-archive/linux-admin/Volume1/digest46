I just had the same problem with a much older version of SLS.  I got
version 1.06 of groff from sunsite and everything is fine now...

I have the same problems on 3 machines (2*486 and 1*386) when I 
tried to boot from the original 3,5" bootdisk in driva A. The 
loading stops after the message "Detecting soundcard: AdLib 
(type 3)". I have no soundcards installed.
