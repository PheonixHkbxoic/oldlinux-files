        NOT JUST ANOTHER LINUX + 386BSD CD-ROM.

Trans-Ameritech presents LINUX SLS/Slackware AND 386BSD and MULTYMEDIA CD-ROM.

A new Linux CD-ROM is available! But not just Linux. Also 386BSD and more.
Here is a brief summary of why we think this CD-ROM is the best.
As the price of only $30 puts it in the same price category as the JANA 
product, I'll base my comparison on it.


We provide 2 versions of SLS distribution - a very stable 1.02 and the new 1.03
and also the SLACKWARE distribution! Linux installs directly from the CD-ROM
on almost any hardware configuration.

1. The Trans-Ameritech Linux CD-ROM is not just a mirror of some ftp site. 
In addition to the full SLS distributions we supply a "live" image of a 
configured system. This is great if you don't want files that are not used 
very often to garble your hard disk. One example is manpages - use them 
directly from the CD-ROM. Same applies to emacs lisp files, info files etc.
How many fonts do you need? Have them all! Space is no problem.

2. Uncompressed sources are available for instant reference.

3. Several versions of the Linux kernel are provided precompiled to cover 
different hardware options including drivers for Sony-31A and Sound Blaster 
CD-ROMs.

4. Patches to support sound cards are included. Take this compiled kernel IF 
YOU WANT. If not - use a small kernel with no unused ballast.

5. Install Linux directly from the Sony-31A or Sound Blaster CD-ROM drive as
well as standart SCSI and Mitsumi types.

6. We are running Linux on several PCs to make sure that our configurations
really work. We don't wait for official SLS release for certain extra drivers
and utilities. If they work here, we include it as an option on the CDROM.

7. For your convenience a full recent distribution of 386BSD *NIX is provided
on the same CD-ROM.

8. Some space is dedicated to what takes too much room on hard disks - 
sounds and pictures. They are usable with the Linux sound/gif tools and under 
MS-DOS too!

9. A few choice MS-DOS applications are included in the assumption that the
majority of Linux users run DOS occasionaly. Or use it from dos-emu!
Most of the MS-DOS stuff comes from the SIMTEL20 archive. Naturally only part 
of it made it to the first CDROM. However the new releases will include other 
files from SIMTEL20, GARBO etc. So if you subsribe to the Trans-Ameritech 
Linux+ CDROM, you will not only get updated Linux, but over a year you will get
the full SIMTEL20 collection as an extra bonus.

10. Trans-Ameritech is a well established company with efficient organization
to guarantee on-time printing and shipping of this product. There will be a
significant discount if you subscribe for future releases.

But the best part is that YOU will decide what to put on the next edition!
We'll count votes and provide most popular software on the next one.

Credit card orders are wellcome. Call Trans-Ameritech at (408) 727- 3883.

Hello,

I have been getting a lot of questions on the low cost Linux
CD-ROM I am doing. Due to the large volume of E-Mail I am sorry
that I could not give individual answers, So I have made the
following FAQ which should give answers to the most common
questions, if you have any more questions please call me at
1-800-363-2083.

What is Linux CD-ROM bimonthly ?

        Once every two months you will get a CD-ROM with Linux and
Linux related software, SLS, comp.os.linux.* archives, FAQ's
etc. This project was started so people without net access or
slow connections to the net can obtain Linux. The first disk contains
about 150 Megs of Linux related software including the 0.99pl5

Will this CD-ROM work on my drive ?

        If you can read your a CD-ROM from Dos then you can use this CD.
This CD is in ISO 9660 format. To install Linux you have to copy
some files from the CD to floppy disks and then install.

How many subscribers are there ?

        At present about 200 but we are growing very fast. Also we have
about 300 subscribers in the NeXT computer side so we are not a
fly by night company.

How much does it cost ?

One sample issue U$25.00
One year subscription U$59.95
Two year subscription U$99.95

If you purchase a subscription you will get 6 CD-ROM's a year.

Do you ship to foreign countries ?

Yes, if you live outside of US or Canada then One sample issue
will cost you U$29.95 and subscription will cost you an
additional $20( So one year is = U$79.95 ) per year for air-shipments.
Payments should be made in U$ cheques or in International Money Orders.
We do not take credit cards at this time.

Why should I subscribe ?

With each subscription you will get the updated version of
Linux. Also new Linux related software and comp.sys.archives.
Also we are selling you a subscription(6 CD-ROM's) for the
price of what others charge for one disk :-).

How can I order ?

        E-Mail me your address and phone number and I will put a disk
on mail for you. Once the disk arrives you can send us a cheque
or money order. If you don't like the disk then you can send it
back to us too but no one has done that so far.

When will my CD-ROM ship ?

        All orders received before 10th April 1993 has been shipped,
any orders after that will ship on 30th of April 1993. Shipment
is done in bulk to save on postage.

Do you provide technical support ?

        Nope, we are not selling Linux, we are just a distrubuter. Our
job is to get Linux in your hands on a affordable way. If you
have technical questions, then you can find them in the FAQ's or
on the comp.os.linux  group. The disk contain information on how
to install Linux on your system.

How can I submit software ?

        If you are on the Internet, you can submit Linux software which
you have either written or ported by uploading it to the FTP
archive site tsx-11.mit.edu.  After you upload it, please send
mail to ftp-linux@tsx-11.mit.edu.  Software thus uploaded will
generally be included in the next CD-ROM.

friends about this CD-ROM

                     September 9, 1993

  Announcing Version 1.0 of the Linux from Nascent distribution on
cdrom in ISO9660 format with Rock Ridge extensions.

  Linux is a freely distributable Unix(R) compatible operating system
for the IBM(R) 386/486 PC and compatibles written by Linus Torvalds
from the University of Helsinki, Finland.  It was developed by a
unique world-wide collaboration of programmers over the internet, and
is covered by the GNU General Public License.  It is a modern, high
performance network operating system, much like ones used for years on
engineering and professional workstations.

  The Linux from Nascent cdrom is an entirely new distribution of the
Linux operating system, and includes over 400 mbytes of source code,
binaries, and documentation for Linux and applications.  The Linux
from Nascent distribution features:

* cdrom demo account
* dos install script to create boot and root floppies directly from cdrom
* automated root, swap, and package installation from cdrom
* simple user account and network administration scripts
* Linux 0.99.12 plus net-2 networking
* extensive online documentation and manuals
* network printer support
* X Window System(TM)
* OpenLook(TM) 3d window manager
* SCSI disk and tape support
* TeX(TM) and ghostscript word processor and viewer
* Ingres database management
* GNU C compiler and utilities
* GNU emacs, vi clone text editors
* sound and graphics support
* Over 100 high resolution images translated from Kodak PhotoCD(TM)
* magic, spice, and chipmunk electronic design tools
* GNU Chess, Shogi, pooltable, xpilot, flight simulator, ...
  
  The Linux from Nascent application archives have been organized
using a consistent makefile interface; the vast majority compile and
install without modification.  Each archive comes with an associated
notes file that lets you browse collections of archives to see what's
available, along with its current status.

  Version 1.0 is only $89.95 plus shipping and handling, and comes
with an 30-day unconditional money-back guarantee.  If after 30 days
you aren't completely satisfied, return the cdrom with your receipt
and the purchase price will be refunded to you.  In addition, there is
a one time BACK TO SCHOOL SPECIAL: save 25% off the purchase price,
good now through the month of September 1993.  Registered owners of
Version 1.0 of the Linux from Nascent cdrom will receive email
support, and a 30% discount off a future release of the cdrom.

  A listing of the contents of the cdrom as well as a current copy of
this announcement and order form may be obtained via anonymous ftp at

Subject: Getting SLS on CDROM and floppies; Softlanding Software
Status: O

        Softlanding CDROM Info:

The SLS CDROM is $99 for the single, or $199 for the Quarterly subscription.
Add $15 for S&H (all prices in US funds).  It contains:

- the SLS 1.02 packages (features 99p9 kernel and libc 4.3.3) 
- SLS 1.02 unpacked and pre-installed
- the SLS source tree
- Werner's Inherited File System (IFS)
- mit and contrib X dists 
- misc X windows srcs (like interviews and the TK X tool kit)
- sources for non-SLS things (like snd-kit and rlab)
- unsupported Linux patches (like Xenix fs and kdebug)
- two boot disks (3 & 5) 
- at least 1 patch floppy (contains updates)
- the booklet, Using SLS

The  above  list is not  meant to  be comprehensive.   Things  such as
multimedia (sound and graphics support) are a given.  Just a few words
are in order for a couple of the contents:

The first item, the SLS 1.02 distribution, is included  in both packed
and unpacked form.  The unpacked form, of course, allows access to all
the distribution  contents without having to install the entire system
onto  a hard drive.  Infrequently  used man  pages and executables may
best be used directly from the CD.

Inclusion of the  packaged release serves several purposes.  It allows
installing from the CD.  It also permits the floppy distribution to be
easily generated from the CD, even from DOS!  This means that each SLS
CD  is  a  miniture  floppy  distribution  producing  facility.   More
importantly, it also means that, even if Linux does not currently have
a device driver for your particular CDROM drive, you can still install
and use  SLS  on your hard  drive, by  copying the files either to DOS
floppies or to  a DOS hard  drive partition, and then  installing from
there.   All  that is  required  is  a  DOS  device  driver  for  your
particular CDROM drive.

The inherited file system, IFS, is the key to the effective use of the
online source and data for read-only media such as CDROM.  It allows a
read-only directories to be mapped over by a  writable directory, such
that only the modified files occupy space in the  writable  directory.
Gross  networks of symbolic links  are unecessary.  Complete directory
heirarchies are mapped  at a  stroke, rather than just the contents of
one directory at a time.

The booklet,  Using SLS, has several parts.  The  first, describes the
various installation  procedures and  options  at  your disposal,  and
gives example installs.  The second section is of the format "A Day In
The Life  Of  The  Linux Hacker".   It depicts  a  somewhat  contrived
session that attempts to take  the user on as  complete a tour through
the SLS system  and it's facilities as  possible.  Pains are taken not
only  to describe what kinds of problems  are  met,  but also  how and
where answers to these problems are found.  We end up with a survey of
the major subsystems of SLS, touching briefly  on topics such as using
GhostScript,  GCC, term  and TeX.  The goal of this guide  is  brevity
rather  than  comprehensiveness, which  is better  handled  by  online
documentation.

  all other costs remain the same.

* Before you mail your order "finger tguez@jade.tufts.edu | more" to

* So don't waste your time downloading 30MG+ of data, it doesn't worth
  your time and energy!  And now that you also get 152 pages of printed

  Besides what is a better way to reduce the traffic on comp.os.linux?


Linux is free and can be obtained from numerous ftp sites such as
tsx-11.mit.edu and sunsite.unc.edu under GNU license.

Downloading the entire SLS with a 9600 baud connection takes about 8
hours, and with a 2400 baud connection about 20 hours.  Instead of
wasting all this time and energy order the entire SLS on disks for a
modest price:


        US$1.5  copying charge per disk
        US$1.2  per 3 1/2 disk
        US$1.0  per 5 1/4 disk

        US$15.0   Shipping and handling 


Your *TOTAL* price (includes shipping costs)       
Series          #Disks          (3 1/2)         (5 1/2)      
a               4               $25.80          $25.00

(all prices are in US$, not including Tax if in MA)

Of course one can order individual disks, series or any combinations.
Prices may change at any time without notice.  Please add 5% tax, if in
MA.

To order:
                Mail a check or money order in advance 
                for the entire sum, and receive the disks
                UPS or by AirMail, as appropriate.

NOTE: All disks are verified *twice* before they are mailed.  All
shipment leave us within a week with a blue UPS label (2nd day air) or
Air-Mail, as appropriate.


        When you order please include:
        
        1) Your name
        2) Phone number, (and an email address if possible)
        3) a UPS deliverable address
        4) The type of *boot* disks you need 5 1/4 or 3 1/2
           (note: only disk a1 is required to boot)
        5) The type (5 1/4 or 3 1/2) of non-booting disks
           you would like.

        Please mail your order to:

                ATC, Computer Science Dept.
                31 Memorial Dr., P.O.Box 504
                Avon, MA 02322
                
                Please make check payable to ATC, Computer Science Dept.
                        
                Questions can be addressed to:
                 tguez@jade.tufts.edu
                

        Also available is our SLS accessory disk which contains
        all the necessary utilities to setup partitions, setup
        up sls to boot from HD (easily), and a few more
        invaluable dos/linux utils that do not come
        with the SLS and are certainly necessary to complete
        the integration: $1.5 copying charge, $1.0 for 5 1/4 disk
        or $1.2 for 3 1/2 disk.

        When a new version of the SLS is available, you may
        send back your disks to receive a copy of the new
        version.  You will only be charged with a copy charge
        of the usual $1.5 per disk updated.  If any of your disks
        becomes defective by the time it reaches us, we will
        replace it for you with the usual $1.0 for 5 1/2 or $1.2
        for 3 1/4 for each defective disk.

        Do not waste time downloading something of that size,
        order it-- it's worth it.


Comments:  
1) Any GNU software is freely distributable.  Hence, if you
want to divide the cost among several friends and use the same
installation disks, then that is perfectly legal and a nice way to
save money!

2) We don't simply download.  The system is installed on a 486/50DX
16MB machine and on a 386/16SX 4MB machine to make sure that the new
release is stable.  If not, we fix things to make it more stable and
useable.
