Could someone please tell me what OPT, REC, and IMP mean, respectively?
I saw these next to each package during the installation of SLS 1.03.

Exactly the same happened to me on a 486. Cured it by a few random changes
to my hardware including disabling one floppy controller and enabling another.
As far as I can tell everything else is back how it was now.

The floppy controller I disabled was on an IDE MULTI-FUNCTION CARD,
IDE PLUS-V3. The one I enabled was on a SuperIDE ISA IDE Caching Disk
Controller DC-99/99M. Both are on a PAT48PR ISA/VESA Local Bus System Board.
I also lost my CMOS set up - must have shorted the battery while making
changes. Maybe that's not back as it was.

I dunno if it is still a problem with SLS 1.03 but I had to update sed
before my posts would work right.  (I currently have sed V 2.00 but I
think the previous version was ok too.)

Subject: Latex goes bananas
Date: Thu, 14 Oct 1993 16:01:49 GMT

Hi,
  whenever I run LaTeX on my PC, I will load some style files from an
SUN NFS server. Every now and then, latex will report an error when 
reading these style files, as it encounters bogus characters (which are
not really in the file!!!). Has anyone else encountered such a problem?

I have tried mounting the nfs filesystem with rsize=512, and wsize=512. This
did not help. I am not sure wether it is a problem with net-2, the
d-link (yep its a notebook) driver, or with latex. Conversely, when 
a SUN sparcstation mounts a filesyzstem from my Notebook, the latex
running on the sun works flawlessly....

Subject: Help upgrading 0.99pl9 to pl13 ----- Have I waited too long??
Date: 14 Oct 1993 09:37:01 -0700


Dear People:

I need to install emacs 19, and I am having problems extracting enough
contiguous information from the various READMES, HOWTOS and FAQs.

I have apparaently waited too long between upgrades and now I am faced
with having to get a binary compiled version of gcc2.4.5 for i386.

I would like to download the source for 0.99pl13 and compile it as I 
usually do, but It seems that HJ does not provide binaries for i386.

        o Is there another ftp site where i386 versions of the latest
          gcc/libs can be found?

        o Should I give up and spend days downloading another
          SLS/Slackware release?

        o Can the gcc-2.4.5/lib-4.3.3 be built from gcc-2.3.3?

It is impossible to learn the system by downloading 'distributions'.
I would appreciate any help you can offer.....


My current configuration:

i386
libc.so.4.3.3
libm.so.4.3.3
libX11.so.3.0
Linux 0.99.pl9-3
gcc 2.3.3
mostly SLS 1.01 utilities.

emacs-19.19-A.Notes says:

Use at least:
0.99.11 and
libX11.so.3 (DLL Jump 3.0pl0)
libc.so.4 (DLL Jump 4.4pl1)
libm.so.4 (DLL Jump 4.4pl1)

release.gcc-2.4.5 says:

i486 Binaries only included.
must have 0.99pl10 with C library 4.4.1 to run it.

RELEASE-0.99.13 says:

Make sure you have gcc-2.4.5 or newer installed.


Sincerely,

Ronan

First, please don't cross-post to so many groups.  There are flame
wars going on now over things like this.  Thank god you didn't post
this to c.o.l.d.  :-)  Your original post went to comp.os.linux.help,

First, binaries compiled for a 486 will run on your 386.  They're
just a little bit bigger, and you won't see the improvement in
speed that this affords 486 owners.

>It is impossible to learn the system by downloading 'distributions'.
>I would appreciate any help you can offer.....

True, and unless you've done virtually nothing to enhance the usability
of your installation since originally installing it, I would advise
against downloading another SLS or Slackware release.

1) As I've stated, you can use the 486 binaries.
2) It's been noted by others that gcc 2.4.5 doesn't *really*
   require 0.99pl10, it will basically work with 0.99pl9, but
   some of the networking code might be adversely effected.
3) So the best advise I've seen for this process would be
   to:    a)  get and install libc-4.4.1
          b)  get and install gcc-2.4.5
          c)  get the source for 0.99pl13 and make your kernel.

You will probably find that your /lib/cpp is a symbolic link to
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-linux/2.3.3/cpp, so you'll want to change
that to /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.4.5/cpp when installing
gcc-2.4.5.

It looks like you don't necessarily need to upgrade XFree86 yet.

I hope this helps, but of course if it trashes your hard disk,
smokes your monitor, or otherwise causes minor inconveniences,
you're on your own. :-)

They use different versions talk protocols because the old one is
fatally flawed:  It depends on byte order.  Linux uses the new one
(I think :-) and Sun the old one.

The solution is for Sun to use the new one, but in the meantime you
can get and install ytalk on both machines.  The latest version is
3.0.1.  It's in the USENET sources archives, and I can make it
avialable for FTP if anyone wants me to.

As for the following:

This should definitely be in a FAQ.  Here's an article I posted in August
to comp.os.linux:

In article <1993Aug9.200819.5097@nstn.ns.ca>,
Hai Pham <pham@px1.stfx.ca> wrote:

Correct.  Sun still supplies the old talk client and daemon programs
with SunOS and Solaris.  The old talk programs were written when all
the world was a VAX, and you didn't have to worry about silly little
things like network transparency between different architectures.

The folly of old talk was seen quickly, thus the ntalk protocol was
designed, and using ntalk anyone can talk to anyone.  Sun, however,
neglected to notice the rest of the world, just like they still use
foo.0 as the default broadcast address. [Actually, this is fixed in
Solaris 2.x .  Yee haw.]

If you really want to talk to the people on the Suns, get them to
install ntalk.  You *may* be able to use ytalk from your Linux machine
to talk to someone on a Sun, but it's doubtful.

I'm setting up Linux for my own personal use.  Odds are that it will never

I installed from the Slackware 1.04 release, and find it quite nice.  But
I see that it also uses the Shadow Passwords.  What exactly are Shadow
passwords?

How are they different from a normal setup, and will they cause any problems
at all for future software packages??  Is there a way to remove them if they
do?

Sorry if this is a FAQ, but I haven't seen it mentioned.

Is is possible to boot and use DOS off of the 2nd hard drive controller
in your system?  I have 2 MFM drives with Linux installed on them (with 
LILO), and just got an IDE hd+controller that I want to run DOS off of.

Must I install the atdisk patches for LILO to recognize this other 
controller in the system, when it will be DOS only?  Then if I can get
this to work, will DOS even work using the 2nd controller in the system?
(I realize that was not a Linux question, but I figured someone here 
would know)

We just copied a package by Swen Th"ummler of the Uni Paderborn that supplies
some of YP functions. You find it in 
        ftp.uni-paderborn:/pcsoft2/linux/local/yp
It has a replacement for lib.cso.4.4.2 and contains the binaris
for ypbind, ypcat, ypmatch, ypset, ypwhich and domainname and the sources as 
well. It includeds source for yppasswd as well but they reported problems 
with yppasswd in connection with Sun hardware.
We will install the package on our box in a couple of days.
If you have more questions relating to that package you might want to ask
the originator (its based on the work of others) - swen@uni-paderborn.de
