The pl13 and earlier plip driver is a dud. To run plip get the newer pl13
alpha test for pl14 (and remember its an alpha test so you may need to
do some debugging!) or join the net channel and install net2e-beta1 which
is also serious debugging needed stuff.

I get 25Kbyte a second over PLIP between a 386DX40 and a 386SX33. With a 
pair of faster machines the speed should go up.

Thomas Uhl posted a query regarding setting up PLIP

Firstly - PLIP does not work with Net-2d so probably forget it

I would like to hazard a guess that there are quite a few people
out here on the net who would like to know the answer to questions
like this so reply by mail would be inappropriate.

If you want the Net-2e code and (supposedly) working PLIP wait for
linux 0.99.14 or join the net mailing list.

I need routing.  Does anyone have first-hand experience getting routing

Date: 28 Oct 1993 18:34:21 GMT

Well, I guess I'm another fool who shouldn't really be trying this, but
please read on...I swore I wasn't going to do this, in fact I've been
wrestling with things for about a week an a half, but here goes:

# stty PANIC

I'm providing technical assistance for my wife's presentation about
interactive Internet services. I've set up a SLIP connection from my
home Linux box to an Internet service provider (ISP) in order to do a
live demonstration of IRC, telnet, and xmosaic.  We can do everything
but xmosaic by dialing in with kermit, but we *really* want to show
xmosaic.  'term' is not useful because the X11 drawing commands have to
come across the connection (too slow).  The presentation is in 18 hours
(!!!!!!!) and things aren't working properly.  I've administered
ethernet networks for many years, so I figured setting this up would be
easy...NOT!  So much for my technical skills...

I'm using the official 0.99.13 + Matt Dillon's big set of patches + the
endian fix + Matt Dillon's dev_delque() patch + Brian Edmonds' routing
patch.  Furthermore, Brian was kind enough to send me a copy of his
linux/net source tree; it didn't make any difference.  Please note that
his connection runs at full speed.  I have net-0.26.tar.z from tsx-11.

[Since I'm so close to the deadline, I'm including my setup scripts
 after the description, just in case someone wants to see them...]

I have one major problem: the connection seems unusually slow.  Here's
some information:

    My Linux box is called "tolly"; the ISP end is called "pp.uunet.ca".

    When 'ping'ing pp.uunet.ca, I'm seeing delays of ~500ms.

    Furthermore, when connecting from tolly to empress.com (connected
    directly to pp.uunet.ca), I'm seeing turnaround times of > 1000ms
    for interactive use (hit key, wait one+ sec, see char on screen).

    Output seems to "stall" for large amounts of data (> 1K or so).
    Transmitting a packet from my end (pressing a key) seems to restart
    output.  When output *does* occur, it seems very fast.  I'll get a
    block quickly (full-bore transmission, it seems), see a long pause,
    then another block quickly.  I'm NOT dropping packets, nor am I
    seeing transmission errors.

    Lastly, if I try "telnet tolly chargen" or "telnet localhost
    chargen", the connection gets closed after 102 lines, unless I have
    another network connection going (ie busy), in which case I could
    get 200, 300, or even 500 lines before it closes.

Hmm, how about some silly questions:

    Is this performance normal?                         I doubt it.
    Is my machine misconfigured?                        Likely :-)

Some not-so-silly questions:

    Does this have anything to do with CSLIP?  I doubt it, since stuff
    is getting through, but...

    Is there a recommended set of modem settings for 14.4K,
    v.42/v.42bis, Hayes-compatible modems?

Miscellaneous questions, not connected to my problems:

    I've been using pp.uunet.ca as my nameserver.  Acceptable?

Thanks for any help anyone can give me.  I'll be pulling an all-nighter
trying to get this thing going tonight.

P.S. Please excuse spelling and grammar mistakes; I haven't the time to

Subject: Summary: Questions in non-help groups
Date: Thu, 28 Oct 1993 22:39:06 GMT

My effort has petered out after a couple of weeks. I received a few basic
classes of responses:

1) "I think my question is appropriate for the group."
2) "There is too much traffic in c.o.l.help."
3) "I post where the gurus are."
4) "I wanted more visibility/faster response."
5) "I didn't know."

In addition from my observations many of the groups are write only becuase
the same questions come up over and over and over again. If posters just
scanned the last week of messages, much of the time they would find an
answer and would not have to post. Also many questions/answers can be found
in the FAQ's and HOWTO's. People don't read them much of the time.

It seems to me that this a bad situation and it's not going to get any better
because the querants don't do any basic research before posting. After
running this survey for a couple of weeks my conclusions are the same:

1) Don't answer inappropriate questions.
2) Direct people to the correct answers (HOWTO, FAQ, whatever).
3) Redirect questions to comp.os.linux.help.

Comments welcome. Survey responses upon request. Followup to c.o.l.misc only.

Later,

Subject: finger not reporting last login time!
Date: 29 Oct 93 05:10:05 GMT

I am having a weird problem where finger doesn't report the last login
time of a user you finger on my system.  Instead, it says "Never
logged in."  (If the user is logged in when you finger him, you do get
the appropriate message about when he logged in and his idle time, if
any.)  I suspect that this is a problem with fingerd, rather than
finger, because when I finger a user at another system from my system
it works fine.  When other systems finger at mine, it has the
problem.

Does finger/fingerd read this information from wtmp or lastlog?  What
should the permissions be on any relevant files?

Here are my system specs: I'm running Linux 0.99.13 on a 486DX/33 with
the libc 4.4.4 and finger 5.2.3.  Most of my networking stuff comes
from the SLS v1.03 distribution of the Linux 0.99.12 kernel (I've
upgraded just about everything else).

Any help would be appreciated!

I've been getting the same error fairly frequently as well, with a variety
of kernels - an extract from one of my syslog files:

Oct 26 20:55:24 scamall9 syslogd: recvfrom unix: Bad file number
Oct 26 20:55:55 scamall9 last message repeated 55845 times

Oct 26 20:59:20 scamall9 last message repeated 40665 times
Oct 26 20:59:20 scamall9 syslogd: exiting on signal 15

I'm not entirely sure what causes it, put once it starts trying to log
messages 100,000 times a second, the load average rockets, and _anything_
that tries to use syslog will hang (including a root login in order to
kill the syslogd process...).

Xntp version 3.3a (beta) compiles with ALPHA-pl13l.tar.gz fairly fine.
Official patchlevel 13 doesn't.
It doesn't contain timex.h in /usr/include/linux.

The deamon xntpd doesn't run, though.
It doesn't complain at all but there is no xntpd running in the process.
I have some trouble in tickadj too.
It fails in "nlist fails: can't find/read /vmunix or /unix".
There is /zImage but no /vmunix nor /unix, do I miss something?

If you could e-mail me or post the file Config.local and associated files,
it would help many.
If there is any suitable ftp site for Linux xntp exsists, it will be fine too.

Subject: Trick to backup Linux to a Sun tape drive (tip)
Date: Thu, 28 Oct 1993 23:36:45 GMT

I found a nifty trick to backup the Linux file systems (both local and 
NFS mounted) to a Sun workstation with an Exabyte tape drive.

The problem:  Linux root user can't spawn remote shells on the Sun
workstation, because he doesn't know the root password on the Sun.  Hence,
no simple way to write data (as root) to the Exabyte tape drive on the Sun
(/dev/rst1).   Root user on Linux can't use rmt tape protocol either. 

The solution:  Ordinary user acount under Linux with same UID and login name
as Sun account can spawn remote processes, no problem.  The problem is that
the tar backup should be done by root, in order to read all files under
Linux, but that the data needs to be written to /dev/rst1 on the Sun by the     
unprivileged user.

The Trick:  Create a pipe with "mknod /tape p", and then start a user
process to read from the pipe and write to the tape drive with
(from a user shell with rsh privs on the Sun)       
"rsh Sun_machine dd of=/dev/rst1 </tape "
and then invoke tar as the root user with
"tar czf /tape /"   in order to write the tar stream to the pipe.

The pipe converts a "root" datastream to a "user" data stream, and it
happily swirls down the drain into "/dev/rst1" on the Sun workstation. 

Now that I've contributed a meager quantum of wisdom to the net, I'd like to
ask if anyone has found a way to get the screen saver built into Xfree 1.3
server to invoke "xlock".  I want to set up my machine so that "xlock" gets
invoked after 10 minutes of inactivity.  Any ideas?

plux:/home/rene man rm

NAME
       rm - remove files

(...)
       GNU  rm,  like every program that uses the getopt function
       to parse its arguments, lets you  use  the  --  option  to
       indicate that all following arguments are non-options.  To
       remove a file called `-f' in the  current  directory,  you
       could type either
              rm -- -f
       or
              rm ./-f

        But you forgot about /etc/gateways file! I did not find any doc's
or man's in my SLS1.03 discribed the 'routed' demon and /etc/gateways.
But I know that this demon is controlled by this file.
