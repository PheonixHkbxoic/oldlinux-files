Date: 16 Aug 1993 05:47:31 GMT

I've been playing with the X color server for the Trident 8900. 

I've tried just about every option to get the thing to speed up
to no avail.  

Is it just slow ?  Has anyone successfully seen a marked improvement
in configuration?

Subject: bsd_ioctl is where?
Date: Mon, 16 Aug 1993 07:55:29 GMT

Normally I don't like to be a system hacker but this time I
have to compile a big physics code, including some low-level
system hacks.

Ioctl is used for tty handling (I know, ioctl is not very
portable, should use select instead) and 
#include <bsd/ioctl> 
sits at the head of the subroutine.
In ioctl.h ioctl is redefined (at least when _SGTTY_SOURCE is not set,
which should not be the case otherwise, for instance, RAW is not 
defined properly) as bsd_ioctl.
So now the linker starts complaining that it can find bsd_ioctl.
My question: where is it???

I've got a 486DX33, 8Mb RAM, 1Mb TVGA8900C.  Make sure that you've got a
fair bit of swap space - I've got about 9-10Mb.  The Trident cards
aren't particularly fast, but with pl10+ (shared libs.) it is quite
usable.

Let's face the facts, TVGA8900 is SSLLOOWW. I think it's only useable
in mono mode. Of course your mileage may be different...

Some implementations of NFS have trouble if the client user is a
member of too many groups (i.e. appears in too many lines in
/etc/group.) Here, `too many' can mean 4 or 8 or 16, for example.
Type `groups' to see how many groups you're in.

Is this group alive ... It was empty so I just had to post 
my stupid admin story ...

Well I just installed SLS 1.02 a week ago sunday and everything
was going fine (no need to post any questions .. GREAT FAQ ),
anyway, this past monday i though it would be a good idea to 
do an fsck ( you know what happens when people start trying to 
think :^). 

Well the fsck (e2fsck) said the super block was corrupt. But,
everything seem to be going fine? So i tryed a new copy, ran 
it through debug, and It just didn't match up! We i figured 
the best thing to do would be to fixed it now ( before it blast
my work into never-never land). So I back everything up and 
re run fdisk, mkfs ... and tryied the fsck again. STILL fails!!

Ok so I decide I want a real swap partition anyway and I might
as well do a low level media analysis. So now I install my 
my dos ( on the first partition ) and my new SLS 1.03. 

Here i go putting everything back on (130mb) dos and linux. 
Boot to the real os (linux o course) and start working on the 
configuration. Now dos is on hda1, prim linux hda2 and swap
on hda3, so I like descriptive device names and I do the following:
   ln -s /dev/swap /dev/hda3
   mkswap /dev/swap 16???

and walla! whip out my dos partion (SLS /dev/swap point to /dev/hda1)
and I just pointed hda3 to swap (not quite what i wanted.)

Ok so I put dos back together again and mount, boot, mount, boot,
(to stupid to put the dos mount in my fs tab). Well this makes 
me REAL good a typing /dev/hda1 ( after doing it 50 or so times.)

So everythings running fine for a couple of days and I descide 
to do another e2fsck ( you know just to make sure ). And guess 
what i type  ... e2fsck /dev/hda1 ... I look at it ... and look
some more ... HEY this is tring to check the DOS partition.

This was exactly why my original e2fsck fail. When i run it against
the linux partistion .. e2fsck /dev/hda2 .. everythins is find.

bootlin works nicely for loading linux from DOS.  One Caveat: loading
linux with bootlin will fail heinously (hard reset necessary) IFF you
install a memory manager (e.g. QEMM, 386^MAX).  Linux wants to put the
cpu into protected mode from real mode, which can't be done once your
memory manager is loaded (already in protected mode).

Reply-To: newcombe@aa.csc.peachnet.edu

After reading a posting earlier on how to get X to run faster on
a Trident, perhaps it might be a good idea to put together a list
of ways to get the best performance/usage out of your equipment.

This could include ways to save disk space, kill un-needed junk,
speed the system up, etc...

Stuff like:

To save some disk space: use strip on your binaries
                         compress your X fonts
                         remove the 40 megs of GIF's and JPEG's :)
To speed up X:           Don't use gtwm or olvm as there is too much
                            overhead, use a lightwieght window manager
                            (not that their is anything wrong with the
                             above)

Sound like a good idea?  Opinions?

Nice idea.  But what first needs fixing/correcting is the 10's of small
inconsistences throughout the SLS distribution (for more info read the
install & config article that I posted a few days ago in c.o.l).

surely this is not right. smail runs setuid root anyway. If I remember
correctly, on my home machine /usr/spool/smail is 750 root.mail or
something, but surely not world-writable (nothing is world-writable
except /tmp).

Everything else works fine.

In pcnfsd, the `pr_init' function completes its initialziations,

bsd_ioctl is in the BSD libs - when compiling, do something like
"gcc -blah bob.c -lbsd"
                 ^^^^^ this is the important part.

The typical Linux-cron is a derivative of the (excellent) cron

Vixie-Cron uses an all-uppercase process title for its active
child processes (that are fork()'ed off by crond to execute the
crontab entries). The all-lowercase instance of /usr/bin/crond
is the master crond that is always running; /USR/BIN/CROND is
an active child just executing a crontab entry.
The close sequence of the pids (50 and 51) is suspicious, espacially
if pid 51 is still around when the system has finished booting.

When, from where and with what parameters do you start crond ?

  | Why is this happening, and does it cause problems?

If the /USR/BIN/CROND instance hangs around for an unusually long time
or does not die at all, then yes, you may have a problem. Most likely a
cronjob that does not exit (and the crond child keeps wait()'ing
for it to die).

Examine your crontabs and the crond logfile, typically located in
/var/cron/<something> .

        Hmm! I got a 486DX with only 4 megs of RAM, 16 megs of swap

        with Linux 99pl7. I can even do reasonably large compilations and

Subject: FAQ: SAGE, The System Administrators Guild
Date: Mon, 16 Aug 93 04:54:16 GMT

In response to a zillion requests, here's the first FAQ about SAGE.  Much
of it is taken from our past press releases, especially a recent writeup by
Cynthia Deno of the USENIX Association.  I'll be reposting this monthly;
more questions and additions are welcome.  This first one is kind of
scattered; it's a midnight throwtogether.

Steve Simmons
scs@lokkur.dexter.mi.us


Questions:

1.  What is SAGE?
2.  How did it get started?
3.  How big is SAGE?
4.  Who does what?
5.  How can I join?
6.  What do I get for my money?
7.  Who's the current board and staff?
8.  Who do I contact?
9.  What is the USENIX Association?


1.  What is SAGE?

SAGE stands for the Systems Administrators Guild (don't ask what happened to
the E).  It is a subgroup of the USENIX Association (see below).  Sage is
Devoted to the Advancement of System Administration as a distinct profession,
within the realm of computer science but with similarities to facilities
management and other service industries.

SAGE answers the widely felt need for an organization dedicated to advancing
the profession of systems administration.  SAGE brings together system
administrators to:

  o recruit talented individuals to the profession,
  o share technical problems and solutions,
  o establish standards of professional excellence while providing
    recognition for those who attain them,
  o promote work that advances the state-of-the-art or propagates
    knowledge of good practice in the profession.


2.  How did it get started?

SAGE was started by a group coalescing around Bay-LISA around the
beginning of 1992.  That original group was Shoshana Abrass, Tina
Darmohray, Arnold deLeon, John F Detke, Paul Evans, Laura Kirk, Bryan
McDonald, Paul M. Moriarty, Arch Mott, Bjorn Satdeva and Elizabeth
Zwicky.  They did yeoman work in bootstrapping things, which eventually
resulting in a linkup with the USENIX Association.  The USENIX board
appointed two additional members, Steve Simmons and Pat Wilson.  This
was the board of directors at the time of the formal announcement in
June, 1992.  Formal elections were held later that year, and the first
elected board met in January, 1993.


3.  How big is SAGE?

Response in the first year has been tremendous.  Our membership as of August
1 is 978, much larger than expected.


4.  Who does what?

There are a number of working groups staffed by volunteers.  They
focus on various issues relating to system administration: policies,
tools, job descriptions, education, local groups, etc, etc.  Please pardon
me for being vague on details, but we (the board) are currently evaluating
the working groups.  Some will be pronounced successful and retire in glory,
some will be dropped until some future date, some will be modified or
encouraged to continue on their present path.  Details when available.


5.  How can I join?

To join SAGE, you must be a member of the USENIX Association (again, see
below).  As a member of USENIX, you are eligible to join any special
subgroup of USENIX (at the moment, SAGE is the only one).  It's kind of like
the ACM and SIGS.  USENIX membership is $65.00/year, SAGE membership is
$25.00/year.  If you attend a USENIX conference, you will find a checkoff
box on your registration form that allows you to apply part of your 
registration to a USENIX membership, bringing your out-of-pocket costs
to zero.  If you attend a conference which is sponsored or co-sponsored by
SAGE, you will see a similar box including your SAGE membership.  And if you
already are a member, you'll find your conference membership is cheaper
by number suspiciously familiar.


6.  What do I get for my money?

You get all the usual USENIX benefits (see below).  You also get the
benefits of the ongoing work of SAGE, which thus far include:

  o Joint sponsorship with USENIX of the annual Systems Administration
    Conference--the largest conference devoted exclusively to system
    administration.

  o Co-sponsorship with USENIX and FedUNIX of the Conference on Tools
    & Techniques for System Administration, Networking & Security.  Sans-III
    will be held in 1994.

  o Planning with USENIX to offer tutorials/invited talks on managing
    and administering distributed systems and networks at the UniForum
    Conference in March1994 in San Francisco.

  o Creating an archive site--ftp.sage.usenix.org--for papers from the
    Systems Administration Conferences and sys admin-related documentation.

  o Actively encouraging the formation of local SAGE groups.

  o Continuing working relationships with newly formed international related
    groups and affiliates.  Two affiliates, SAGE-AU in Australia and SAGE-UK
    in the United Kingdom, have in recent months formed and held their first
    conferences in part in response to the formation of SAGE in the USA.

  o Establishing working groups in areas such as jobs, policies, and education
    that are important to sysadmins.  Much of SAGE's hard, hands-on work is
    carried out by working groups which focus on a particular goal, set of
    milestones, and schedule.  One example of a current project is the
    preparation of job descriptions for system administrators at various
    levels. The Jobs group plans to offer its model job descriptions in the
    form of templates before the end of 1993.  

  o Initiating production of a series of very practical pamphlets on sys
    admin-related issues and techniques.

Your money goes to pay for these activities, many of which are cheaper for
SAGE members than for non-members.  In addition, the general costs of
running the organization are covered by your membership fees -- insurance,
employee salaries, etc, etc.  See "Who's the current board and staff" for
info on salaries.

Note that the Board of Directors and members of the working groups pay all
their own expenses.  This may change in some future year should Sage get
Really Rich, but we aren't holding our breath.



7.  Who's the current board and staff?

The current board of directors is Carol Kubicki, Paul M. Moriarty, Pat
Parsegian (secretary), Peg Schaefer (treasurer), Steve Simmons (president),
Pat Wilson and Elizabeth Zwicky (past president).  The terms of Kubicki,
Moriarty, Wilson, and Zwicky all expire Jan 1994; the terms of the
rest expire Jan 1995.

In addition to the elected board members, Bryan McDonald has been appointed
by the board as official editor of the various SAGE publications.

Tom Christiansen is the official liaison between the USENIX board and the
Sage board.

The SAGE board and membership is supported by the USENIX professional
staff, including Executive Director Ellie Young, Conference Manager Judy
DesHarnais, and the entire office staff.

9.  What is the USENIX Association?

The official name is the UNIX and Advanced Computing Systems Professional
and Technical Association, but everybody just calls it USENIX.

USENIX is the original (soon to celebrate its 20th anniversary!)
not-for-profit membership organization of those individuals and
institutions with an interest in UNIX, UNIX-related and other modern
operating systems and, by extension, in C++, X windows, and other
advanced computing technologies and tools.  USENIX is dedicated to:

  o sharing ideas and experience relevant to UNIX, UNIX-related and advanced
    computing systems,
  o fostering innovation and communicating both research and technological
    developments,
  o providing a neutral forum for the exercise of critical thought and
    airing of technical issues.

As a member of the USENIX Association, you receive:

  o Free subscription to ;login:--the bi-monthly newsletter with technical
    features, international calendar of events, book reviews, Snitch Reports
    on various ANSI, IEEE, and ISO standards efforts from the USENIX
    representative and others.  SAGE,with its own editor, publishes in each
    issue of ;login: SAGE News, views, features, book reviews and other items
    of interest to system administrators 
  o Free subscription to Computing Systems--the refereed technical quarterly
    published with the University of California Press.
  o Discounts on registration for the two general conferences, the annual
    System Administration and C++ conferences, the single-topic symposia, and
    associated tutorial programs--as many as ten technical meetings each year.
  o Discounts on proceedings from USENIX conferences and symposia and other
    technical publications. 
  o Discounts on the USENIX Association book series published by the MIT
    Press.  Now available the first in the series:  The Evolution of C++:
    Language Design in the Marketplace of Ideas, edited by Jim Waldo of Sun
    Microsystems Laboratories.
  o Savings on titles from McGraw-Hill, PTR Prentice Hall, John Wiley & Sons,
    the MIT Press, Addison-Wesley, and UniForum.

Subject: Running the SLS off of a NFS mounted Novell server.
Date: Fri, 13 Aug 1993 05:53:20 GMT

I work at the Indiana University Cyclotron facility, and I have managed
to get the Computer Electronics group here to give Linux a try.  I did
this by bringing my Linux home box in and quietly utilizing it.  Linux
made its own merits apparent, and I put in the right word here and there.

Well, now I am taking my home box home, and I will be installing a 
permanent Linux setup.  I imagine it will catch on, and I will be called
on to get Linux and especially X working on minimal machines, 386's with
4 megs.  I believe this will work with the tiny X set up.

What I think the next step would be is to put the SLS on a central file
server, in this case a Novell file server, and create a boot disk that
NFS mounts it.  I would also create a swap partition and if necessary
a small ext2fs partition on the PC.  In effect, I want to make X
terminals out of the 2nd tier equipment (PCs) the non-researches get.

I have put the Novell NFS daemon to a good deal of testing, so I think
that will hold up.  But I have concerns about actually running Linux
with a group of users.  Is anybody actually using Linux as a multiple
user platform?  How many users?  How much administration is required
comparatively?

I think making a central installation would be a giant step in making this
workable.  The alternative is to have the software distributed on
every machine, and my sneakers have enough holes in them from keeping
the DOS/Windows PCs running.  Has anybody tried to running Linux off
of a central mount point like this?

Any input is welcome.

Well, that's a nice idea at first appearance.  It might be handy for
people who have standalone systems, or isolated networks, just to give
them some idea what groups they should have, but I'm not convinced that
everyone being different in their choice of ids is likely to affect
anything.

The problem comes with those who are on networks with other machines
(esp. NFS), as they really need to have their ids match the others on
the network, or things start looking rather wierd, and you can get some
interesting security holes.  Any standards document must certainly
mention that for cross-platform NFS none of the linux standards should
be considered to apply.
