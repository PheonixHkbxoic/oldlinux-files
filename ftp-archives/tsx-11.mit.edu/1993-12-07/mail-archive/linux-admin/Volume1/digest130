Subject: PC-NFS Based Printing
Date: 29 Oct 1993 13:06:03 -0000

  I was wondering if someone could tell me how to set-up
remote printing to use a PC-NFS Printer Demon interface, rather
than standard Unix-based demons. My problem is that the network
system manager will not give me an entry into the
hosts.lpd file, and instead has informed me that, as far as
he is concerned, PCs operate using PC-NFS printer interfacing, and 
a pc running unix is far to big a security loophole to allow
us to interface to his systems.

 Anyway, I can use the network printers from DOS via PC-NFS, but
using the rm entry in printcap results in an error message stating that
my machine does not have permission to print. I had a hunt through the
FAQs for this one, but I must be blind because I could not find anything
in the printer or general HOWTOs.

 Thanks in advance,
    Gordon

Make sure you have a file called /usr/adm/lastlogin (or /var/adm/lastlogin)
created.  This is where that information is stored most of the time.  (On
my system and my friends systems, this is the way it is).

Hope this helps.

No. It's /var/adm/lastlog.
Even touching this file may not help.

Seeing as this question comes up _so_ often, (I'd guess about 20 times in
the last 6 months), here are some clues. (Note: obviously it depends what
version of finger, login, last, you're runnning. Check out the archive sites)

i)   if you have an old version of login, it won't even be trying to
     put records in the 'lastlog' file. You'll need to get a newer version
     and re-compile.

ii)  finger may need re-compiling to look in the right place for this file.
     Look in the relevant pathnames.h config file, and re-compile.

iii) /var/adm/lastlog, along with /etc/utmp and /var/adm/wtmp all need to
     be mode 644. Obvious, but easy to overlook.

You may also have problems with the utmp/wtmp files; some programs will think
they are SysV format, others in the old BSD format. This may mean you'll get
pty's left 'logged in', and other problems. Your version of 'init' may be
able to fix this.

You could also check out Jeff Uphoff's modified finger. I've also got 
patches it you prefer to show the location of the user.

Hope this helps some people out there; it _can_ all be fixed.

Subject: a (unique) kind of boot/root floppy?
Reply-To: teffta@cs690-3.erie.ge.com
Date: Fri, 29 Oct 1993 15:21:33 GMT


I had an idea which I'm currently working on and just wondering if
anyone else has done anything similar (I know a lot of people have made
bootable root floppies; I'm not looking for ideas on what to put on
such a filesystem :-)).

First the background: I regularly boot Linux using a floppy which has 
LILO installed. The kernel itself lives on the hard drive. I much prefer
this method to installing LILO on the hard drive -- makes me feel much safer.

So here's my idea:

1. Make an ext2 filesystem on a floppy, copy a kernel and other basic
utilities to it similar to any other emergency recovery floppy.

2. Install lilo on the floppy, with the default kernel being the one on 
my hard disk, and a second kernel choice being the one on the floppy,
with the root filesystem being set to the floppy.

Then I have one standard boot floppy which I can also choose to use as
a recovery bootable rootdisk, by holding down shift when booting. 

Sound good? A waste of time?

The only problem I've encountered so far is that LILO loading a kernel off
the floppy is WAY slower than booting a kernel dd'd directly to the floppy.
But for emergency situations I guess it's ok. And it seems to be a lot
easier to maintain than a filesystem sharing space with a raw kernel file
(I think I saw a method to make boot disks like this, no?)

Well anyway when I come up with something good I'll post the relevant
details here.

How much memory do you have?  During the beta program, my brother was
running it on his 386DX-25 and he reported that it was pretty snappy
once it had started up.  He has 16M.  If you have only 8M of memory
and are running lots of other things on your system (multiple clocks,
xterms, emcas, etc) then you may find that you are swapping.  Anytime
you swap you take a BIG performance hit.  I've had reports from people
with 8M who have achieved acceptable performance from uib.  This is
why we recommend that people have at least 16M of memory.  I did most
of the initial port of the builder and library on a 486DX33 with 16M
and I never the builder was slow.  g++ was slow, almost painfully, at
times, but the builder was fine.  I've since added 16M of memory to
make linking faster while I'm running under X.

Also, if you are having problems with the compile time, use -O rather
than the default -g.  There was an article posted a while back that
gave instructions on how to get the most performance out of OI/uib.
Drop me a line if you'd like a copy.  If I get more than 5-10
requests, I'll upload it to tsz-11 in the contrib area.

BTW, I've found a couple tricks to reduce the amount of memory
required for OI and thus uib by 0.5M.  This should help when the next
release happens.

   There are as many solutions, it, seems, as there are instances of
this question...unfortuntely, none of them seem to work for me!
   The 3-4 different finger sources I've gotten don't seem to have any
place where this file is configured. They seem to get the information
from some system calls. So which login/finger/whatever is that I
should use to get this to work????????? Will this also fix the screwed
up "last" entries too???
   One interesting thing, though...fingering "root" always shows the
correct last login time.

I'm sick of this! smail consistently bounces incoming mail for only
a few users on the system. Smail says the user is unknown but the
user *is* in the passwd file. I suspect it is related to the passwd
file: I got mail for one user to stop bouncing after shuffled
a few things in the passwd file. But after I tried to get it working
for another user, it stopped working again. I don't understand why
mail to me (jmorriso@rflab.ee.ubc.ca) works fine, yet it always
fails for other users. I have combed over /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow
with a fine tooth comb. Nobody on the smail users mailing list responded
to me, so I'm resorting to this group. Because it seems passwd related,
it might be the shadow passwd or standard libs in linux. I'm using
the most recent smail binaries uploaded to tsx.

I dunno. I used to run a net with a 3/160 server and loads of diskless 3/60
clients, all running SunOS 3.5. I configured 'em up with about 3M or so of
separate root per client (3.5 used ND for root), however much swap they
needed (ND again), and then shared /usr via NFS from the server's copy. None
of this /var silliness; they just shared /usr (and therefore all of
/usr/spool). I ditched Sun's sendmail and built the then-current Berkeley
one; I ditched Sun's lpr/lpd and got PLP; I configured everything in the
obvious and straightforward way, and it worked beautifully.

Do any of these users have capital letters in their names?  smail will bounce
them if UNIX_LOWERCASE_HACK was defined when compiling or if it is in the
transports file.  THe solution: Create a /usr/{local?}/lib/smail/transports

Guten Tag!

Due to the fact that some of my users are no Unix wizards I am looking for
some introduction paper for them to learn the basics.

It's for a Linux system but needs not to be special written for this OS.

It would be fine if it is available as plain ascii file. However, dvi or
postscript will do it too. Even references to printed books/papers will
be interesting for me.

Please tell me the exact locations and names of mentioned files!

Thank you in advance!

Guten Tag!

Printing some files containing characters of the IBM charset (blocks and
lines and suchs) yields funny results on a Linux virtual console. The
characters seem to be mapped by some scheme to other characters. However,
it's not just a 8bit->7bit conversion.

On the other hand, if someones dials in over serial line and displays the
same files on his terminal (Telemate on MS-DOS in this case) he sees the
completely correct results.

The files contain no ANSI escape sequences. They are plain 8bit text files
with IBM charset.

What's going on? How can I fix this without changing the files? Is it possible
at all to display the IBM charset on a virtual console?

This would be quite important for me because these files are the welcome
screens of my former bbs which was replaced by a linux dial in. It was a lot
of work to design them, my users like them and I would love to continue to
use them, as well on the dial-in screens as on the local consoles where some
of my users work sometimes.

Any information will be appreciated. Thank you in advance.

no, none of the users have upper case. local mail works fine, put for
several users incoming mail bounces. I noticed one site where it was
doing this, so I kept testing it with

mail -s test local_user%rflab.ee.ubc.ca@some_other_host

when local_user is my ID, or several others, the mail works perfectly. 
when I substitute others, it bounces with "user unknown"

I went through the passwd file testing each userid, and they worked
until I got to one that didnt work. I couldnt find anything weird about
the userids that had mail bounce. I found "holes" in the passwd file
where the userids weren't consecutive integers, so I filled in those
userids, and that didnt work. I checked the /etc/shadow file and found
that it was slightly out of sync with /etc/passwd, so I added/deleted
accounts and I made /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow correspond with each
other line by line. No luck. I briefly corrected the bouncing mail
for one two users, but it seems to have reverted when I tried getting
it to work for others.

Subject: Re: finger not reporting last login time! --here's one fix.
Date: 30 Oct 1993 08:59:36 GMT

This works for SLS installs (which don't quite work for last logins, etc.).

I wish I could remember who gave this to me, because it works perfectly.

Here's the email I received and used to fix my problems...

============================================================

Here are the patches you have been waiting for!

In SLS, last login times are not reported by finger.  Through email,
a few of us have figured out how to fix this, and I have now gotten 
around to posting it. :-)

To make the lastlog file be written so that finger can read it, follow the 
instructions below:  (I have added what is in brackets.)

==========================================================================

        Two changes have to be made in /usr/src/shadow.  You should
replace your lastlog.h (probably should change it to point to
<bsd/utmp.h> but I couldn't be bothered) with this:

---cut here-------------------------------------------------------

 *
 *      This file defines a lastlog file structure which should be sufficient
 *      to hold the information required by login.  It should only be used if
 *      there is no real lastlog.h file.
 */

struct  lastlog {
        time_t  ll_time;
        char ll_line[12];
        char ll_host[16];
};

---cut here-----------------------------------------------

and add the line :
        (void) strncpy (newlog.ll_host, utent.ut_host, sizeof newlog.ll_host);
to log.c just after the line :
        (void) strncpy (newlog.ll_line, utent.ut_line, sizeof newlog.ll_line);

then recompile and re-install your shadow passwd suite and reboot. 
Now login will write the same format lastlog as finger expects.

[If /usr/adm/lastlog does not exist, do 'touch /usr/adm/lastlog']

Symbolic link /etc/lastlog to /usr/adm/lastlog.

        [ by doing 'ln -sf /usr/adm/lastlog /etc/lastlog']

==============================================================================

I don't know why the current version of SLS does this, but the correct set
up for last to work requires that the real version of wtmp be in /etc and a
symbolic link to it be in /usr/adm.  I did the following and now last works:

rm /usr/adm/wtmp*
rm /etc/wtmp.old
mv /etc/wtmp /etc/wtmp.old
touch /etc/wtmp
ln -sf /etc/wtmp /usr/adm/wtmp

...and now all seems to be well.  I deleted the old faulty wtmp so
continuous streams of 'still logged in' messages wouldn't be around all the
time.  Happy linuxing!

==============================================================================

*** END OF FIX ***

My modified version of finger (I called it 5.23) ignores the invalid
utmp entries left over by closed xterms, which showed users still logged
in until a user (any user) ran a logout, which seemed to clear up utmp.
It also shows mailbox status, as well as gives the proper time zone.
