the status of this book? I can only check some german ftp-servers because 
down here at the university of duesseldorf they seemed to cut off every 
connection to others countries this weekend (I hate hate hate them) and I 
couldn't find it down here. Is there something available at sunsite or tsx?

Subject: Creating /dev/hda9
Date: Sat, 25 Sep 1993 23:23:43 GMT

I just got linux installed and working with X.  The only problem I have
is that I have too many logical partitions.  I created one for the swap
file, but there aren't enough drivers in /dev to access it.  How do
I create /dev/hda9 so that I may swap on that partition.

Another problem I have is that I would like to boot linux using
OS/2's boot manager.  I have linux booting from the boot floppy now.
How can I setup linux to boot off the hard drive using OS/2's
boot manager?

I hav looked at the Linux FAQ and other sources, but I cannot get
answeres to these two questions.

Carl.

If I am ftp'ing, say, the latest gem from the FSF, I'll often just
grab it from a nearby site and check to see if the SIZE is the same
as on prep.ai.mit.edu.  Or I might even get the software from prep.
Insecure, I know, but I am willing to accept that much risk, and
I'll discount the possibility of someone spoofing the network connection.

I thought it would be better to compare both size and checksum.
But in the readme for the TAMU security package, the authors
tell how crackers managed to alter files such that the sizes and
checksums remained the same. [!!!]

So I guess out of band strong crypto--excuse me, authentication--such as
pgp is the way to go.  That, and acquiring the data from a trusted
source.

I hope that it would be obvious, but let me say in advance
that I'm not flaming the poster.

Reference, please.

A lot of my argument depends on how you define "questionable".
Oh well, here goes:

Flame on.

I'm going to assume that the author(s) of the book meant
"freely distributable" when he/she/they wrote "public domain".
That's fine for code that is on the order of two pages (see the recent
discussion on the firewalls list), but what about packages like gcc or
GNU emacs--or Linux?  Are you (you in general) going to "read and understand"
the entire package?  Would you have caught the setgid hole in emacs?
If so, you've better things to do with your time.

Where I used to work, the Internet was evil, all software on it
was "public-domain", and it all had viruses, even the source code.
You weren't allowed to ftp (or buy on tape) gcc and install it, but it would
be ok if you read it first to be sure it was free of bugs.
  "Bugs or viruses?" I asked, and got a grudging "viruses" in reply.

It would also be ok if you typed it in yourself.

Some people were thinking of forming a committee to vote on whether
a particular source distribution was virus-free.  Gee, there's an
objective evaluation.

All of this while the "high-security" computers were running
MIT X11R5 and GNU emacs binaries included by a vendor with their product.

Flame off.

Having the source gives me a warm fuzzy feeling, but I don't know
how legitimate that feeling is.  It may just be the opposite of FUD.
What am I going to do?  Grep for "exec" "system" "unlink" "open" "#define"?

Getting source code from a reputable, uh, source--e.g., tsx-11 or prep--may
also be a good idea.  In the commercial world this is trusting your vendor.

Having the whole Internet (hi everybody) as beta testers
(guinea pigs? :-) 1/2  Hey, I'm one too.) is the biggest plus for me.
(I remember one time someone posted some Mac program infected with
the nVIRa virus.  You should have seen the hue and cry!)

I haven't read gcc, yet I don't consider myself a Unix neophyte.

(Aside:  The TAMU (Gig 'em Ags) distribution contains source.)

It all boils down to this:  You have to know the risks,
and you have to decide which ones you're willing to accept.

You need to add the linux partition that you're going to install 
lilo on (your root partition usually) to the bootmanager menu.  Then
use linux's fdisk to change the partition id to 83 ( or 2 or 3, for
that matter, but 83 is best).  Install lilo to boot that partition.
Don't use any linux app (like fdisk) to toggle the partition active;
it's not needed, and you may hose your partition table (from OS/2's
point of view, anyway.  That's it..

Thank you to everyone who helped.  I've got both problems resolved

Subject: Linux Clusters anyone ?
Date: 26 Sep 1993 08:36:24 GMT

I'm guessing that most Linux machines are used primarily by a single
person (the owner of the 386/486).  I'm very interested in hearing
comments from people who have setup Linux clusters as part of
a cost-effective general facility.

I'm aware that NIS is not currently available - is there any support
for diskless clients or /usr clients ?  Any projected release dates
for NIS ?

Is RPC available ?  Have people tried using an application such as PVM
to utilize the entire cluster in a computation ?

What are the strategies for upgrading groups of machines (around 15-20) ?

Looking forward to hearing the comments of Linux admins on these topics...

If you need a "quick fix" you can put '*' in the password entry for
root.  That solved the problem for me, and should have been what the
shadow routines should have done in the first place.  Note that rshd
becomes worthless at this point for all users with passwords in the
shadow file.

It does keep the wolves at bay until you can grab a new, improved
version of rsh.

I saw a note about the shadow stuff needed to be udpated to a newer
version that has this failsafe in it.  Maybe it is time to do so.

Hmm..  this is a bug in NET2 that doesn't exist in NET1 (or whatever the
