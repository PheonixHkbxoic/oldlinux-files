The one big problem I see is if the users that are nfs mounting
/var/spool/mail have root access to their machine.  They can add a new
user with a uid of another user (who is also nfs mounting the same
/var/spool/mail), and do what they like to their mail.

Oh, ok, this is just a variant on the '-i' problem which has been
discussed already on this thread.  (I thought you were still talking about
the possibility of your .profile being executed.)
The problem doesn't occur if your setuid shell scripts start with
        #!/bin/sh -
instead of
        #!/bin/sh

Once you know that "| program" in your .forward file gives you the
functionality you need, you have most of it.

The rest is peanuts (and not Linux specific).

        2. What is the relationship between vmlinuz and zImage. Are both

Some of the stuff I mentioned is fairly new (tkined/scotty,
netman...), and includes things that one might not run across without
having either spent a lot of time on the net or hanging out with the
LISA crowd.  I have yet to admin a very large site; my current setup
only has about 10 UNIX boxes, but I have the pleasure of supporting
four different flavors of UNIX.  Trying to maintain a consistent
user-environment across such heterogeneity brings up issues &
solutions that one might not see at a single-vendor site.

It would not be a bad idea to have a FAQ with some of the more
standard questions (how much swap space do I need, performance
analysis, UUCP config...).  However, this stuff has been addressed in
some good books (Nemeth et al, Loukides, etc).

Here though, I'd like to discuss topics and resources that have been
neglected by the commonly available literature.  My advice to a new
UNIX admin would be something along the lines of "Go buy a good UNIX
sysadmin book, and use this FAQ to supplement it."

[ various suggestions deleted ]

>How can I monitor a remote user's terminal?

This, of course, begs the question: "Should I monitor a remote user's
terminal?" 

I have received plenty of email encouragement on this project, so I
will go ahead and start working on a draft.  After I have something
substantial, I'll go ahead and post it.  Thanks to all for the
comments.

One other question- to which groups should I regularly post this
stuff?  Some folks seem to be of the opinion that it should only be in
comp.unix.admin, whereas others would prefer to see it comp.*.admin
groups as well.  In any case, I'm working on the draft, I'll only post
it to comp.unix.admin.

you can get sendmail from sunsite.unc.edu:

I recommend sendmail for machines directly on the net (ie no uucp)

I ported it back in January and made the file "spice.kit.T.Z" available
at Sunsite.  This tar of my project includes a patch file and
instructions.  An archie search shows these current sites for the file:

   nz20.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de:/pub/linux/sunsite/X11/xapps/spice.kit.T.Z
   src.doc.ic.ac.uk:/computing/operating-systems/Linux/sunsite.unc-mirror/X11/xapps/spice.kit.T.Z
   sunsite.unc.edu:/Linux/X11/xapps/.cap/spice.kit.T.Z
   unix.hensa.ac.uk:/pub/sunsite/pub/Linux/X11/xapps/spice.kit.T.Z
   von-neum.uni-muenster.de:/share/public3/linux/sunsite.unc-mirror/X11/xapps/spice.kit.T.Z
   ftp.germany.eu.net:/pub/comp/i386/Linux/X11/Applications/spice.kit.T.Z
   faramir.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de:/pub/linux/simulation/spice/spice.kit.tar.z
   ftp.germany.eu.net:/pub/comp/i386/Linux/Applications/Misc/spice.kit.tar.Z

This is a source level release and never needed revision as far as I know.

But it turns out that the source itself of spice3e2 targeted by the above
patch was never supposed to be ftp'able.  The attention received by the port
to Linux got the file spice3e2.tar.Z pulled from *all* anonymous ftp sites.
The main problem with the distribution of spice source deals with export
issues and not copyright abuse, it seems.  At least that's the case here in
the States as spice was funded by federal tax dollars, i.e., it is the
property of the people of the US.  You can get the tar file of spice3f4 from
U.C. Berkeley for a distribution fee of $250.  ftp ic.berkeley.edu for
details.

If anyone wants me to port spice3f4 for them let me know.

    I have a lost+found directory into a  partition (/user)

    My disk is a IDE 540 Mb. I did 3 partitions on it, they are:

   /dev/hda3               /user           ext2    defaults
   /dev/hda1               none            swap    sw


   Why I have a lost+found directory inside of one disk?

   I have others linux machines and they have not lost+found
   directory.


   $ cd /user
   $ ls
   $ user1/    lost+found/  user2/      user3/

  How can I fix it??
