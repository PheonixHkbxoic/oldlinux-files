                still pretty
                respectable performance.  I used to have an ET4000
                (Orchid PD II).
                I found the speed on that absolutely unacceptable, except
                in mono.
        PROBS   No problem at all.  The DOS software included is
                brain-damaged.

                (solid window
                moving vs. outline moving) and redrawing.
        PROBS   Required the patch to the X386 server to avoid the solid
                line bug when
                exiting.  (Screen fills with about 30 solid vertical

                graphics are
                not running slow
        PROBS   I had some difficultly figuring out what the Xfree config
                file
                should contain for my controller and monitor. 
                Unfortunately
                there was no info on my monitor so I had to figure things
                out
                through trial and error.  I also wish Xfree could use the
                extra
                memory so I could jump from 1024x768x8 to 1280x1024x8.

                Under X11 (Xlinux.8514) Bitmap transfers are slow,
                because of
                the 8514-architecture (everything goes through a 4-bit
                I/O-port)
                The mach8 chip doesn't offer linear memory mapping as the
                mach32
        PROBS   No problems at all.
                Serial port probing under Linux touches a 8514-register
                that uses
                the IO-port of COM4 (modified).  Inport Mouse works fine
                as

                Getting a working
                Xconfig required a good set of clocks from another wizard
                and a lot of

                the fonts correctly on exit.  Patching the driver for 1.3
                fixes it
                for 80x25 text mode, but still scrambles things for >
                80x25.  The
                T8900C does the same for > 80x25 as well.  Solution is to
                use an

Windows Accelerator  Card.  Local 1024x768     8, 256 out o ?           
        SPEED   Reasonably fast.
        PROBS   No supplied XConfigs worked; The supplied spreadsheet
                programs helped
                but I had to most calculations by hand. At the end I
                started out 
                to get 640x480 (the less critical resolution) to work;
                that was easy
                then I used that config line with a higher clock
                frequency, which made
                800x600 possible, and finally I used that line with a
                higher clock
                to get 1024x768 working.
