Hang on 'ere a mo.  I'm led to believe rightly or wrongly that prices for 
hardware are cheaper in the US than over here in the UK, and whilst this has
nothing to do with the argument given here I am astounded at the suggestion a
3.5 inch drive should cost $75.  I can buy (in fact I just have done so) a 3.5
inch drive in the UK for 20GBP, so even at a rather sad exchange rate 1 pound
2 dollars that still only comes to 40 dollars.  Are you really suggesting it
should cost $75 for a 3.5 inch drive..........

The shells launched via xdm do not read your .profile, so whatever is in 
there is not taking effect.  If you want the shell to read your .profile, 
then start xterm with the `-ls' (login shell) option.  So, this is why your 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH does not work.  How have you set up the links?  Do you have 
libXaw.so.3 symlinked to libXaw.so.3.0.1?  Just doing a

    `cd /lib; ln -sf /usr/X386/lib/*so* .'

will not be enough.  About your problem with more, I would check the
.bashrc (assuming you are using bash) to see if there is a `TERM=...' 
statement.  As far as I can see, whenever I login to a vt, TERM is 
automatically set to `console', and whenver I start an xterm, it is set to`
xterm'.  Thus, I do not need to set the TERM variable at all.  I hope this 
answers your question.

        IMHO - the O'Reilly book "Essential Systems Administration" would
        be a good bet for Linux since it covers virtually all flavors of 
        Unix (bsd, sVr4, SunOs, and even "also"ix ;-)   ) I think Lars is

        crumpled-up, tea-stained copy of the FAQ, right!  In the meantime,
        I've been very pleased with the O'Reilly book - with coverage of so
        many *nixen, it provides a good  perspective on the "Platypus".

Not that that really matters, since once your there its just as easy to reset
your real uid as well:

int main (int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[])
{
     setreuid ( geteuid (), -1);
     execve ("/bin/sh", argv, envp);

Ouch! This worked with Slackware, too. I don't know about other
distributions.

Anyway - source and a binary for an in.rshd that uses shadow passwords
(and thus avoids this problem) can be found in /pub/linux/binaries on
ftp.cdrom.com. I've merged it into the 1.0.4 disks I have here, so it
will be fixed in the next release. In the meantime, *especially if you
are on the net*, you should check the security of your in.rshd, and
replace it if you need to.

Upon further testing, I find that the new in.rshd will only execute
commands for accounts with no password.

Anyone know how to fix this?

Oh well, it's still better (IMHO) than the in.rshd you could be using
now. :^)

I do not need PEX so I relinked the X-server (look in /usr/X386/lib/Server

I think that installing the right things (PEX-fonts, -libs, ..) may help

        The error codes are described in David Engel's fsck front-end man
page :

       The exit code returned by fsck is the sum of the following
       conditions:
            0   - No errors
            1   - File system errors corrected
            2   - File system errors corrected, system should
                   be rebooted if file system was mounted
            4   - File system errors left uncorrected
            8   - Operational error
            16  - Usage or syntax error
            128 - Shared library error

        e2fsck conforms to these error codes.

I dont know if it is easy to answer to my questions,

What PC must I have to run linux on it?

Or maybe is-it easier to enumerate what the PC MUST NOT HAVE? Ex.:

Yup. All package admins could add a section to their respective README's
that states:

        *** As all programs will not necessarily use the shadow ***
        *** password system, ensure that all passwords in your  ***
        *** /etc/passwd file have a password of "*". As long as ***
        *** passwords are truly set in /etc/shadow, there will  ***
        *** be little risk from old binaries.                   ***

        *** If you have an old binary that uses passwords from  ***
        *** /etc/passwd, either get a newer version, try to fix ***
        *** it yourself, or copy all passwords from /etc/shadow ***
        *** into /etc/passwd on a regular basis (maybe an entry ***
        *** in your crontab and a shell script or perl program) ***


Not that it isn't nice to see people trying to make the system foolproof,
but a true fool will still find a way to hose their system :-) You can
only do so much for people...

Then get some tape or glue and some cardboard. Cut the cardboard into 1.75"
strips and attach them to a 3.5" diskette to make your own 5.25" diskette.

Copying passwords from /etc/shadow to /etc/passwd is pointless. It negates
the whole purpose of having shadow passwords in the first place. If you
do this, you might as well not install shadow passwords at all; it will
save you many headaches and be just as secure.
