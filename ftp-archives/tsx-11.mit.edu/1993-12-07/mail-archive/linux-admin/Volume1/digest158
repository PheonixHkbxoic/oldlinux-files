Upgrade the Sun to use the "new" talk protocol.  Check archie for

Has anyone tried to install Slackware on a system with an Adaptec 1542B and
one hard drive that is over a gig?  Both a friend and I have identical hard
drives from Maxtor with an Adaptec 1542B.  Neither of us can boot the Slackware
bootfloppy. It seems to hang when it displays the info of the HD.
We think it may be due to the HD having >1024 cyls. If I pull just the HD and
replace it with a 120meg IDE, but leave the Adaptec and the scsi tape and CD,
things seem to work fine.  

It all worked fine with SLS 1.03 distribution.
Has anyone installed Slackware on a >1gig drive?  How similar are SLS and 
Slackware as far as the Adaptec driver go?

Config:
** Slackware 1.1.0 (Linux 0.99p13)
** SMC Elite 16 (8013 EPC) Ethernet card, connected through AUI port
to UTP via Racal Interlan Micro MAU

Problem: Plain doesn't work!!
Details:
Because we're running on thickwire, and there's something about the
Linux kernel that resets the card to the BNC port on startup, I
inserted "wdsetup -m aui" in rc.inet1.  I verify that the card is set
to use the AUI port with wdsetup again, before I "ping -v localhost".
That returns:

When I try pinging other hosts on my office LAN, both the card and the
MAU indicate that something's going out, but there's no response.

Has anyone come across this situation?  (My guess is that packets are
getting mangled somewhere, but what do I know? 8-)

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

I installed slackware as well.  I had a question about what was
in the /bin directory and the /usr/bin directories though.  It seems
a good number of the programs are duplicated.  There is a /bin/cmp and
a /usr/bin/cmp for example.  The binaries aren't exactly the same.
If I were just to guess, I would think that some came in gnu packages
and others did not. ???

I was just wondering which binaries I need and wich ones I should
get rid of?  (If I have to, I'll just get rid of them all and make
a custom setup for the hell of it.)

It seems that i cannot configure them to any resolution higher than
the sh*tty 640x480x16, and my board has 1Mb VL-BUS and can support

It compiles right out of the box, except of one unknown macro:
"#define R_OK 4" from unistd.h has to get defined. I simply attached it
to the AC_FLAGS. A bit dirty, but it works.

Gifs are allready quite compressed (lzw I think) and will not compress 
much more if at all under v42.

The throughput you are getting is about correct for transfering binary compressed
stuff over a slip line ie 14k4 minus a bit of protocol loss. You should get better
with text ie newsfeed or mail etc.

Not that I know of. I think ther is some debug code in the slip source you could
enable (or if not add some) but as per above your setup seems to be working fine.

We have seen many postings regarding lpr/lpd problems. I personally
asked for help several times and eventually got it to work (lpr/lpd but
not lpq/lpc) under SLS 1.0.3. Several days ago I decided to finally
give Slackware a shot and now all of my printing problems are gone. It
works out of box - the only things you have to do is edit
/etc/printcap and create (or get from someone) /usr/lib/lpfilter which
are both printer specific. And that's all. No more screwing around
with changing ownerships/file permissions. By the way, most of the
lpr/lpd related files come owned by daemon insted of lp 
(printing-FAQ says they should be owned by lp). Not true. It works
perfectly as it comes from Slackware. It's interesting that
Slackware's lpr/lpd ownership setup is much closer to Sun OS 4.1.3. which 
(in my opinion) is another step in right direction.

I've have to agree except for one small point. I'm using a remote printer
that's hung off a Sparc 2. It prints fine, no complaints from the daemon.
The only problem is that lpq reports that the link is down always.

Any clues?

Yesterday I FTPed tcl7.1 and tk3.4 and I noticed today that
tcl7.2 and tk3.5 have appeared on the FTP site during the night!
So, I FTPed those as well and will compile them on Linux real soon now.
I am glad to hear that tcl7.1 & tk3.4 compiled that easy.

If you are interested in getting patches for Linux, e-mail me
(after 'real soon now' period has expired).

BTW, someone in comp.os.linux.* was asking about documentation
for tcl/tk. It's there on the FTP sites (books and a one-day 
tutorial, read README).

: Yes.
: I compiled it with only two changes. In tclMain.c i inserted
: #include <unistd.h> (for the definition of R_OK). The same in tkMain.c. 

: Annyone here made dll-Libraries for tcl7.1 and tk3.4 ????

I once made them for tcl 7.0 and tk3.3 Patchlevel 2 each, just
to learn how to make shared libraries. Worked ok, but some of the
tests failed (due to bugs that had nothing to do with the sharedness
of the library), and I had no idea about a possible compatibility
with the earlier shared library versions, so I didn't upload
anything. If someone made the SHARED libraries already, please
upload and announce them.

Hallo !

The XMP-bbs here in Braunschweig, Germany runs under Linux and there is a=
=20=20
Login-Sreen (selfmade). You can use the bbs with Telix or something else=20=
=20
and as a POINT with the new Release of CROSSPOINT (XP) 3.0 (2.92,=20=20
actually). So you can login in the Linux-System from DOS. Running XP under=
=20=20
OS/2 as a DOS-TASK you need a FIFO-ser-card.

bye, Joachim
