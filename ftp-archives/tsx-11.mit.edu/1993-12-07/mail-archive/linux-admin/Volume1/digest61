On the other hand, with such a standard commonly used for new installations
that need not match a previous setup, it would make tar files of system
files more meaningful, especially with extra packages to install.

And when you want to connect previously unconnected linux boxes with NFS,
it saves some effort to have the ids matching already.

I have a similar program on our Suns.  Its called op.  It uses an authorization
file with lines of the form:

        execname:tuname:pwdstat:logstat:username,username,...

Execname is the name of the program to run.
Tuname is the name of the user to become while running execname (usually root).
Pwdstat is a "*" to indicate that no password is required, or "#" to indicate
a password is required.
Pwdstat is a "=" to indicate op should require the user's actual password,
or anything else to indicate op should require the special op password
(which is encreypted in a file which only root can read).
Logstat us a "#" to indicate that a log entry (via syslog), or a "*" to
indicate that the command should not be logged.
The list of users is a list of user names, or a "*" to indicate all users.

Before op runs execname, it sets the path to a known state, preventing the
user from inserting their own version of a program in the path before the
approved version.
To use it, the op directory is placed in the user's path (first), and then
soft links are placed in the directory which point to op (i.e. shutdown -> op).
When the user enters the command, op runs, sees that it was run as the program,
and goes from there.  You can also call op as op, and pass the program name
as an argument.

There are actually more features than can be described in a short space.

KA9Q will work.  It's on tsx-11.mit.edu somewhere, and also in
athos.rutgers.edu /pub/linux/ka9qbin.15.tar.Z and ka9qsrc.15.tar.Z.
I'm not sure why you're worried about reinstalling.  You don't need to
redo all of SLS, just the kernel and network utilities.

Hi,

I tried to install Linux 0.99p12 (the SLS 1.03 Release) on a
486/66 HP-Vectra VL of a friend yesterday evening and run into
a Problem with the HP busmouse.

It seems to be a Logitech compatible mouse (AUTOCAD works fine
with the Logitech-driver under DOS) so I compiled the Logitech
busmouse driver into the kernel, linked /dev/bmouselogitec 
(Major 10, Minor 0) to /dev/mouse, added the line
        Busmouse "/dev/mouse"
to /usr/X386/lib/X11/Xconfig, and startet X.

The X-Server started, but after a few seconds it stopped with the
message 'cannot open device: /dev/mouse'. I tried it again, but
now with a serial mouse attached and everything was fine.

So, whats to do?

Ciao,

Subject: Re: run level testing

I was plagued by the same concerns for display of run-level information
when I re-worked an early version of Miguel's sysv-init for our systems here.

I modified the sources so that init places its current run level in its
arguement list (argv) when it starts and when it changes run-levels. That
way ps and friends can display what run-level the machine is in.  I sent
these changes along with changes which allow the use of syslog for logging
init messages and a recursive alarm scheduler to Miguel but either they
did not get to him or he did not consider them appropriate.

The only trick in this was to re-exec init with a fake arguement if there
were no arguements coming from the kernel/boot process.  This was necessary
to insure that there was a place for init to write the process-level
information to.  Actually the kernel probably needs a proctitle system
call (or whatever POSIX calls it) to handle this cleanly.  Anyway, it
solved a problem for us.

    I never did get the crond from SLS 1.00 to work. I don't know if it

Well, I don't know about Slackware, because it requires me to have a 3 1/2
inch diskette to boot and, believe it or not, I don't.

So for _some_ of us Slackware is worthless.

All of these have their problems. But until the distributor of Slackware
decides to support 5 1/4, I'll have to stick with SLS and MCC.

Subject: using syssetup and changing mouse configurations
Date: 16 Sep 93 03:50:30 MDT

I just finished installing SLS 1.03 on my 486dx33 and screwed
up already. :/  Instead of configuring a PS/2 mouse (like I
have), I entered a serial mouse (don't ask why).  I tried to
change it in the install program, but it wouldn't work; so I
tried to change it using syssetup.  Here's what happened:

#/syssetup
#/

Is there a specific configuration for syssetup or is there
something else I can do to get this fixed.  BTW, my ps/2 mouse
is recognized when booting up, so do I even have to worry 
about this?

I have this version, and cron does its work well. You have to ensure
that the &$%$/!# permissions are set right, though (i.e.
/usr/spool/cron belongs to root.daemon and is not world read/writable
and the crontabs files belong to the respective users, and crontab is
setuid.)

    YES!! Here I just logged in to report this, after spending the last
1/2 hour trying to figure out how I'd broken elm, and what do I see? I'm
not the first to notice. It's definately the new bash, as I restored
everything else to confirm. 
    Also, it's only elm that breaks. Sending mail with mailx and nn
works fine.

In principle you are correct. However Patrick has provided a couple of features
that can help.

1) He has a test version of a 5.25 boot/root pair on 
   ftp.cdrom.com:/pub/linux/tst. The README for the 5.25 can be found with 
   the rest of the distribution.

2) 5.25 is really only required for booting. You can install via hard disk
   or NFS. Unfortunately many people don't have access to a network and
   don't have enough disk space to temporarily store the distribution to
   the HD in order to install it.

Patrick does try his best to keep Slackware up to date. But maintaining 2
separate distributions will slow him down.

As a last resort of course you can shuffle the packages into a 1.2M format.
If you try that you'll see why Patrick doesn't keep track of 2 distributions!

I'll be glad to help anyone I can to get Slackware on their machine. It's
my distribution of choice.

BTW I do have only a 5.25 drive on my home machine. I ended up bringing it
to work, putting it on the network and installing via NFS. Works like a 
champ!
