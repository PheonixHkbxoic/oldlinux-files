Subject: high speed modem problems with getty2.07b
Date: Mon, 18 Oct 1993 11:55:35


 I've been using 0.99pl10 with getty 2.07b now for a couple of months and I've
noticed problems with my v.32bis (14,400 baud) modems. Sometimes an
incoming connection will be negotiated successfully and I get a login prompt
from my linux box, but anything I try to type seems to be completely ignored.
Other times, I can log in but the connection suddenly slows to a crawl. This
only seems to happen with v.32bis connections, v.32 usually works just fine.

I have two 14,400 baud modems on Com's 1 and 2. The inittab entry sets them
up for 38400 baud connections using getty. The gettytab file has entries for
the modems starting at 38400baud with hardware flow control enabled. The
modems have the following settings &c1&d2&k3&q5&s0&r0s0=2. Tried re-compiling
the source for getty/uugetty 2.07b but the executables look exactly like the
one I already have. Has anyone else experienced these problems?

Please e-mail your replies, I don't get to read this news group very often...

This is a followup to my own post.  This is looking less like
an administration related problem, so it's probably the wrong
group now, but look at this:

{~/ss/qbe}: gdb qbe
(gdb) list
97
98      int
99      main(argc, argv)
100       int argc;
101       char *argv[];
102     {
103       Panel  panel;
104
105     /*  mtrace();*/
106       server = xv_init(XV_INIT_ARGC_PTR_ARGV, &argc, argv, NULL);
(gdb) run
Starting program: /usr/home/hal/ss/qbe/qbe

Program received signal 11, Segmentation fault
0xf74b9 in strncpy (s1=0x0, s2=0xbfffe47e "iablm", n=6) at strncpy.c:38
strncpy.c:38: No such file or directory.
(gdb) bt

I can't believe that XGetHostname() could *ever* have gotten away
with calling strncpy() with a NULL pointer for the destination
argument.  Furthermore, the host name is "hiablm", not "iablm".
And why doesn't it dump core when linked with shared libraries?

On another note, many people have mentioned Seyon breaking with
libc-4.4.4.  I never had any problems with it dumping core, but
I've found that if a dialing script has a "waitfor something"
command, it's fine if the "something" shows up, but it *never*
times out if the "something" doesn't arrive.  I've tried getting
rid of all blank line in all seyon configuration files and turning
funMessages off, but it doesn't seem to get around this problem.

No, spice3f4 is not fair game for uncontrolled distribution/export.
But If you have the source, which at least US citizens can obtain for
signing some agreements and a distribution fee, then I would be happy
to port it for them.  I just couldn't make it freely distributable.
And yes, if you have the source, you could legally distribute to me under
some simple conditions we would have to arrange.

I simply haven't obtained 3f4 because over the years I've purchased
three legal copies of Spice for personal use and don't feel I need the
very latest because I'm not simulating circuits but charged-particle
optics today.

Hope this helps to clairify,

>Will Linux support 2 Ethernet Cards in the same machine?

Yes, this is possible (I have done it)  You must first make sure that the
network cards don't conflict in any IRQ, I/O or memory address.  Once you
have done that, you have to look into the kernel, and modify the file:
        linux/net/inet/Space.c
There are several entries for the network devices.  Usually have names like
        eth0, eth1, eth2, eth3, ... etc
this are in a device structure.
Usually defaults are eth0 autoprobes and eth1-3 are disabled.  What I did
was let eth0 still autoprobe, but also added the I/O addr, IRQ, shmem of
my network card on eth1.  Recompile and presto, you get the 2nd ethercard
as eth1.

Note, that the comments say that you can add the network cards using
"boot-time" setup, but I found no docs on this respect.  Also, if you have
kernel ver0.99p13 or better, it says that you can also set to autoprobe
on the other eth devices. 

I am just listing what worked for me...

> Will it route

I am trying to do this and unfortunately with no luck.

>Will it accomplish this without hacking and recompiling the kernel?

You must recompile the kernel to get Linux to recognize the 2nd network card.
About geting routing to work, who knows....

I just came across a couple of followup articles posted by Warner Losh
to c.o.l.help (which I guess is where this should have been) which
answers my question.  Don't use XFree86 1.2 with libc-4.4.4.
I reprint below (and without permission) his posts which coincidentally
relate to my problem:

Yes, but the default is that exportfs denies root access to the
client machines.  (By "touch" I assume you mean read/copy/edit/delete,
as opposed to touch(1).)

Subject: HELP! ext2 filesystem partly corrupted - e2fsck useless
Reply-To: mark@macs.ee.mcgill.ca
Date: Fri, 22 Oct 1993 23:49:17 GMT


I don't know where to start.  My system had been up but idle for several
hours when the power went out.

That was during the night, so the power came back and the system rebooted.  I
decided to run e2fsck (which admittedly I hadn't run for over a month).  I
have just one Linux partition, so since I obviously couldn't umount it before
fsck'ing (I didn't know yet about the mounting read-only and remounting
trick), I ran fsck on a non-quiescent filesystem.  I don't know if that
caused the start of my problems.

First, I trusted fsck and ran it with the "-a" option.  Next thing I knew, my
/tmp and everything in it were gone, my /etc/fstab contained garbage, and who
knows what other files were corrupted.

After a while of fiddling and doing e2fsck right, I managed to get rid of
some problems.  However, weird things were happening.  Running fsck would
sometimes transform my /etc/fstab to a directory!  Everything under
/lost+found is troublesome: Directories (including /lost+found itself) would
suddenly end up with one link instead of 2 or more, and I can't go into them
anymore.  I tried unlinking /lost+found, creating another, and running fsck
to clean up.  No chance - the new /lost+found would soon afterwards be
corrupted.  I was getting errors like:

/lost+found: bad directory: size < 24

I was also getting errors like:

Block 15527 has been used before.  Now in file '/etc/mount'.  Clear?

I haven't a clue of what's going on.  I can understand some inodes having
incorrect information (which fsck should correct I presume), but I can't
understand why a newly-created lost+found would suddenly end up with 1 or 0
links (at least that's what I could see from 'ls').

Any ideas what's going on?  How to get rid of this problem?  Are there any
tools besides fsck that could help?  I would hate to think I have to reformat
and reinstall everything!  I don't know for sure what files are corrupted.
(I presume it's only what was in /tmp + some files in /etc).

Note that I'm running SLS 1.03 with 0.99pl12.

Thanks in advance for any help.

And why not. Please do not make broad statements like this without
some argument. As far as I'm concerned, you MUST mount it NFS.
This is the only way I could figure out that users will actually get
their mail and still be logged onto any given machine within
the domain. I've NFS mounted my /var/spool/mail dir from the
very first day I ever got a sun, never had any troubles. Thats
what the sun sysadmin manuals say to do!!!!

This is not true. root access for NFS mounted partitions
must be explicitly allowed by the NFS server. -root=machine ...

Quite true. It can however be disabled for those of you who
want the mailhost to mount the /var/spool/mail dir NFS for
whatever strange reason you may have (I won't go into our strange
reason :). There is a line 

# Remote mode - send through server if mailbox directory is mounted
OR

Thats does what is described above. For subsidiary machines then
add the mailhost (or even mailhost maybe) after the OR. Comment the
line out on the mailhost. Should work.
