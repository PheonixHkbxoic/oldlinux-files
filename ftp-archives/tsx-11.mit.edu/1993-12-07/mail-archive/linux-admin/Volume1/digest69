Is there support for the now famed Point to Point Protocol (PPP) for Linux.
I didn't see anything in the NET-2 distribution, but there must be some
hacker out there that is working in the middle of the night on this.

Please fill me in.  Thanks

Is the size of the disks the only issue, or is there something else
in the boot process (or the /dev directory) which demands 3.5in boot drives?

   Well, you could simply do what I did - fit as many of the packages on 
each floppy, and install with pkgtool.  Heck, it's better to do it that
way - I don't have to spend time downloading stuff like the smalltalk
interpreter that I'm not interested in, anyhow.  :-)

   Come on - 10 minutes and 40 bucks will get you a nice new 1.44 drive

of commercial software as well.  Why should Patrick force those of us
with 1.44MB drives to use 5 extra disks, just to satisfy the people who
refuse to use a reasonable setup?  If you want to be cheap and not get
a drive - fine, install the packages seperately.  It's easy.  And if you
notice, there are only a few select people complaining about the disk formats.
I'd be interested in seeing how that compares to the number of people
who have downloaded Slackware in total.

Okay, so maybe *your* area has switched en masse to 3 1/2".  But many existing
machines and many new machines still have 5 1/4" boot drives, and heckling

Looks PERFECT to me :-)

Let me try to explain the mem-lines from free an top (correct me if I'm wrong):
a)  13840K +  1124K = 14964K
b)  13840K - 10688K =  3152K
c)   3152K -  1928K =  1224K

(a) total_mem = used_mem + free_mem : no memory is 'lost' (kernel-space is
    already subtracted from your physical memory size to give total_mem)
(b) used_mem - buffer_mem = memory used by existing processes (process_mem)
    where buffer_mem is used as a dynamic disk-cache
(c) process_mem - shared_mem = private memory for the all processes, i.e.
    memory that is neither shared-executable-pages (for multiple instances of
    the same executable, like getty or sh, that share some (read-only) pages)
    nor shared libraries.

Sigh, I wish people could really READ the output-lines from free, top et al. up
to the last character... As long as total_mem=free_mem+used_mem there is really
nothing to worry about (buffers count as used memory !!!).
Hey, enjoy, the kernel has put your expensive memory in use, no chips wasting
your money by not being used at all :-)) (Sorry, couldn't resist...)
Maybe this should be in the FAQ (if it isn't already). But who actually reads
FAQs ? I usually don't as you can see ;-)

I hope this puts an end to this 'help, the kernel has a memory leak' stuff...

And if you do have a 3.5" but the 5.25" is the boot floppy, then open the
box, switch the cables, run the CMOS setup to switch the A and B drives,
and you may find that the 3.5" is now your boot disk.  Worked on mine,
anyway.  Standard disclaimers apply to yours.

Does anyone have a defragmentation program that I can run on my brain?

This sounds very much like you did NOT umount your /dev/fd1!
Probably due to file buffer caching, any read() on the unmounted
/dev/fd gets the old contents, i.e. any disk change is NOT detected.

Umount /dev/fd1  -  and off you (should) go.

Hope that helps,

This slightly misses the mark.  Normally, the buffer-cache shrinking
does not require any buffers to be written out, since every 30 seconds
or so, all dirty buffers are automatically written out anyway.  This
helps to keep most of the buffer cache clean, so that it may be shrunk
quickly.  Only if you have very little space left in the buffer cache
will you get a lot of writes going on all the time.

However, the periodic 30-second filesystem sync() does have its own
problems.  In particular, inodes and buffers get locked while they are
written out.  This is the real cause of most of the delays during
heavy disk writing.

Cheers,
 Stephen.

   Once you have the machine booted and a file system mounted, it is
absolutely irrelevent where you install the packages from.

Some of the hackers at mit in the 70's (stallman?)
were really irate when the security folks insisted on passwords,
and they actively promoted the use of the "empty string" password.
They used to regularly break into the password file and reset
the passwords of the security people to the empty string :-)

I like using the empty string password on my pc at home.

    Not only that, the stock floppy cable in most clones won't reach to
allow switching if you have both drives.
    However, as a constructive (hopefully) suggestion, has anyone
considered that if someone has a 5 1/2 boot drive, installing lilo on it
could cause linux to load from the 3 1/2 drive?
