The Linux Electronic Mail HOWTO
by Vince Skahan, <vince@victrola.wa.com>
v1.0, Last Modified 25 August 1993
===========================================================================

This document describes the setup and care+feeding of Electronic Mail
(e-mail) under Linux.

You need to read this if you plan to communicate locally or to remote sites
via electronic mail.

You probably do *not* need to read this document if don't exchange
electronic mail with other users on your system or with other sites.


0.  Introduction

        The intent of this document is to answer some of the questions and
        comments that appear to meet the definition of 'frequently asked
        questions' about e-mail software under Linux.

        This document and the corresponding UUCP and News 'HOWTO' documents
        collectively supersede the UUCP-NEWS-MAIL-FAQ that has previously
        been posted to comp.os.linux.announce.


0.1 New versions of this document

        New versions of this document will be periodically posted to
        comp.os.linux.announce, comp.answers, and news.answers.  They will
        also be added to the various anonymous ftp sites who archive such
        information including sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.


0.2 Feedback

        I am interested in any feedback, positive or negative, regarding
        the content of this document via e-mail.  Definitely contact me if
        you find errors or obvious omissions.

        I read, but do not necessarily respond to, all e-mail I receive.
        Requests for enhancements will be considered and acted upon based on
        that day's combination of available time, merit of the request, and
        daily blood pressure :-)

         Flames will quietly go to /dev/null so don't bother.

        Feedback concerning the actual format of the document should go to
        the HOWTO coordinator - Matt Welsh (mdw@sunsite.unc.edu).

        There is a smail-3.1 mailing list.  

        To join (or get off) the list, send mail to
                smail3-users-request@cs.athabascau.ca

        make sure that you include the address at which you want to receive
        mail in the text of the message.

        To send a message to the list, send it to
                smail3-users@cs.athabascau.ca.

        Books:
        ======

        The following is a non-inclusive set of books that will help...

        'Managing UUCP and USENET' from O'Reilly and Associates is in my
        opinion the best book out there for figuring out the programs and
        protocols involved in being a USENET site.

        'Unix Communications' from The Waite Group contains a nice
        description of all the pieces (and more) and how they fit together.


0.4 Where *NOT* to look for help

        There is nothing 'special' about configuring and running mail under
        Linux (any more).  Accordingly, you almost certainly do *NOT* want
        to be posting generic mail-related questions to the comp.os.linux.*
        newsgroups.

        Unless your posting is truly Linux-specific (ie, "please tell me
        what routers are already compiled into the SLS1.03 version of
        smail3.1.28") you should be asking your questions in one of the
        newsgroups or mailing lists referenced above.


1.0 Hardware Requirements

        There are no specific hardware requirements for mail under Linux.

        You'll need some sort of 'transport' software to connect to remote
        systems, which means either tcp-ip or uucp.   This could mean that
        you need a modem or ethernet card (depending on your setup).


2.0 Getting the software

        In general, I grab my sources from ftp.uu.net and the other fine
        archive sites on Internet.  In addition, Linux-specific binary ports
        are found in the SLS distrbution and on the usual Linux anonymous
        ftp sites (sunsite.unc.edu and tsx-11.mit.edu in particular).

        The newspak-1.7.tar.z distribution contains config files and readme
        files related to building uucp, news, and mail software under Linux
        from the various freely-available sources.  It can usually be found 
        on sunsite.unc.edu in the directory /pub/Linux/system/Mail.


3.0 Mail 'Transport Agents'

        This section contains information related to 'transport agents',
        which means the underlying software that connects your local system
        to remote systems.


3.1 Smail v3.1

        Smail3.1 seems to be a de-facto standard transport agent for uucp-only
        sites and for some smtp sites.  It compiles without patching from
        the sources.  In addition, smail is provided in binary form in the
        SLS distribution of Linux.

        The newspak distribution contains config files for smail3.1.28 under
        Linux that you can use to start with.
        
        If you're building smail from sources, you need to have
        CASE_NO_NEWLINES=true in your os/linux file.
        
        For a uucp-only system that has a MX-record and that wants a
        domainized header (who goes through a smart-host for everything),
        these are the entire config files you'll need:

        replace 'subdomain.domain' with your domain name
        replace 'myhostname' with you un-domainized hostname
        replace 'my_uucp_neighbor' with the uucp name of your upstream site

        #-------- /usr/local/lib/smail/config -----------------
        #
        # domains we belong to
        visible_domain=subdomain.domain:uucp
        #
        # who we're known as (fully-qualified-site-name)
        visible_name=myhostname.subdomain.domain
        #
        # who we go through
        smart_path=my_uucp_neighbor
        #
        #---------- /usr/local/lib/smail/paths --------------
        #
        # we're a domainized site, make sure we accept mail to both names
        myhostname        %s
        myhostname.subdomain.domain      %s
        #-------------------------------------------------------------------

        To run smail as a smtp daemon, add the following to /etc/inetd.conf:
                smtp stream tcp nowait  root  /usr/bin/smtpd smtpd

        Outgoing mail gets sent automatically, when using elm. If your
        internet link is down when you send mail, then the mail sits in 
        '/usr/spool/smail/input'. When the link next comes up, 'runq' is
        run which causes the mail to be sent.


3.2 Sendmail+IDA

        There is a nice binary distribution of sendmail5.65c+IDA on sunsite
        in pub/Linux/system/Mail that I highly recommend.  I run a uucp-only
        site and use sendmail5.65c+IDA instead of smail3.1.28 due to the
        incredible ease of use.

   To install it...
        - you'll probably want to remove (or rename) all the files from
                smail (see the /install/installed directory if you are SLS)
                to be safe.
        - cd to / then 'gunzip -c sendmail5.65c+IDA.tpz | tar xvf -'
        - cd to /usr/local/src/sendmail5.65c+IDA/ida/cf and copy the example
                local.m4 file to 'yourhostname.m4'.  Edit out the distributed
                hostname, aliases, and smarthost and put in the correct one
                for your site.  The default file is for a uucp-only site
                who has domainized headers.  Then 'make yourhostname.cf'
                and move the resulting file to /etc/sendmail.cf
        - if you are uucp-only, you do *NOT* need to create any of the 
                tables mentioned in the README.linux file.  Just edit
                the .m4 file, make sendmail.cf, and start testing it.
        - if you're uucp-only and you talk to sites in addition to your
                'smart-host', you'll need to add uucpxtable entries for
                each (or mail to them will also go through the smart host)
                and run dbm against the revised uucpxtable.
        - if you change your .cf file, be sure to refreeze your config
                with /usr/lib/sendmail -bz to make the changes take effect.

        Another nice thing is that if you have mail.debug set and you
        run syslogd, your incoming and outgoing mail messages will get 
        logged.  See the /etc/syslog.conf file for details.

        
3.3 Other 'transport agents'

        The following also are known to run under Linux.  Consult
        'archie' for details regarding how to find them...

                smail2.5 - very simple UUCP-based smail
                sendmail8.5 - the newest non-IDA sendmail from Berkeley


4.0 Mail 'User Agents'
        
        This section contains information related to 'user agents', which
        means the software the user sees and uses.  This software relies on
        the 'transport agents' mentioned above.


4.1 Elm

        Elm compiles, installs, and runs flawlessly under Linux.  For more
        information, see the elm sources and installation instructions.

        The only thing to know is that Elm's Configure script incorrectly
        sets the 'ranlib' variable in config.sh.  When Configure gives you
        the chance to edit config.sh before proceeding, please do so and
        set "ranlib='ranlib'" or the binaries will compile but not link.

        Elm and filter need to be mode 2755 (group mail) with
        /usr/spool/mail mode 775 and group mail.

        If you use a binary distribution like the one in SLS, you'll need
        to create a /usr/local/lib/elm/elm.rc file to override the compiled-in
        hostname and domain information:
        
        replace 'subdomain.domain' with your domain name
        replace 'myhostname' with you un-domainized hostname
        replace 'my_uucp_neighbor' with the uucp name of your upstream site

        #---------- /usr/local/lib/elm/elm.rc ------------------
        #
        # this is the unqualified hostname
        hostname = myhostname
        #
        # this is the local domain
        hostdomain = subdomain.domain
        #
        # this is the fully qualified hostname
        hostfullname = myhostname.subdomain.domain
        #
        #--------------------------------------------------------

        One thing you want to be aware of is that if you have Elm compiled
        to be MIME-able, you need metamail installed and in your path or
        Elm will not be able to read MIME mail you've received.


4.2 Mailx

        There is a fine binary implementation of mailx located on the various
        Linux archive sites.  Make sure you grab version 5.3b or later since
        there are security problems in v5.3a.

        The only potential problem I'm aware of is that it seems to be
        compiled in a way that requires /usr/lib/smail rather than
        /usr/lib/sendmail as a transport agent.  You probably need a link
        if you run sendmail on your system.

        I strongly recommend removing the old 'edmail' stuff from SLS
        and replacing it with mailx.  This is rumored to be done already
        in the current SLS.


4.3 Other user agents

        The following also are known to run under Linux.  Consult
        'archie' for details regarding how to find them...

        Pine      - from the Univ. of Washington
        Metamail  - allows MIME support
        mh        - yet another way to handle mail
        deliver   - file/process mail based on rules 
        procmail  - file/process mail based on rules
        Majordomo - manages e-mail lists
        Mserv     - provide files-by-mail

The Linux UUCP HOWTO
by Vince Skahan, <vince@victrola.wa.com>
v0.1, Last Modified 22 August 1993
===========================================================================

This document describes the setup and care+feeding of UUCP under Linux.

You need to read this if you plan to connect to remote sites via UUCP
via a modem, via a direct-connection, or via Internet.

You probably do *not* need to read this document if don't talk UUCP.


0.  Introduction

        The intent of this document is to answer some of the questions and
        comments that appear to meet the definition of 'frequently asked
        questions' about UUCP software under Linux in general, and the
        version in the Linux SLS distribution in particular.

        This document and the corresponding Mail and News 'HOWTO' documents
        collectively supersede the UUCP-NEWS-MAIL-FAQ that has previously
        been posted to comp.os.linux.announce.


0.1 New versions of this document

        New versions of this document will be periodically posted to
        comp.os.linux.announce, comp.answers, and news.answers.  They will
        also be added to the various anonymous ftp sites who archive such
        information including sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.


0.2 Feedback

        I am interested in any feedback, positive or negative, regarding
        the content of this document via e-mail.  Definitely contact me if
        you find errors or obvious omissions.

        I read, but do not necessarily respond to, all e-mail I receive.
        Requests for enhancements will be considered and acted upon based on
        that day's combination of available time, merit of the request, and
        daily blood pressure :-)

         Flames will quietly go to /dev/null so don't bother.

        Feedback concerning the actual format of the document should go to
        the HOWTO coordinator - Matt Welsh (mdw@sunsite.unc.edu).


0.3 Other sources of information

        USENET:
        =======
                comp.mail.uucp can answer most of your UUCP questions

        Mailing Lists:
        ==============

                There is a Taylor UUCP mailing list. 

                To join (or get off) the list, send mail to
                taylor-uucp-request@gnu.ai.mit.edu  

                This request goes to a person, not to a program, so please
                make sure that you include the address at which you want to
                receive mail in the text of the message.

                To send a message to the list, send it to
                taylor-uucp@gnu.ai.mit.edu.

        Books:
        ======

        HDB and V2 versions of UUCP are documented in about every vendor's
        documentation as well as in almost all *nix communications books.

        Taylor config files are currently only documented in the info files
        provided with the sources (and in the SLS distribution hopefully).
        To read them, you can grab the nice 'infosrc' program from the 
        SLS 's' disks and compile it.

        The following is a non-inclusive set of books that will help...

        'Managing UUCP and USENET' from O'Reilly and Associates is in my
                opinion the best book out there for figuring out the
                programs and protocols involved in being a USENET site.

        'Unix Communications' from The Waite Group contains a nice
                description of all the pieces (and more) and how they fit
                together.

        'Practical Unix Security' from O'Reilly and Associates has a nice
                discussion of how to secure UUCP in general.


0.4 Where *NOT* to look for help

        There is nothing 'special' about configuring and running UUCP under
        Linux (any more).  Accordingly, you almost certainly do *NOT* want
        to be posting generic UUCP-related questions to the comp.os.linux.*
        newsgroups.

        Unless your posting is truly Linux-specific (ie, "please tell me
        what routers are already compiled into the SLS1.03 version of
        smail3.1.28") you should be asking your questions in comp.mail.uucp
        or on the Taylor UUCP mailing list as indicated above.


1.0 Hardware Requirements

        There are no specific hardware requirements for UUCP under Linux.
        Basically any Hayes-compatible modem works painlessly with UUCP.

        In most cases, you'll want the fastest modem you can afford.  In
        general, you want to have a 16550 UART on your serial board or
        built into your modem to handle speeds of above 9600 baud.

        If you don't know what that last sentence means, please consult the
        comp.dcom.modems group or the various fine modem and serial
        communications FAQs and periodic postings on USENET.


2.0 Getting UUCP 

        Taylor UUCP (current version 1.04) is available on prep.ai.mit.edu
        in source form and in the Linux SLS distribution in binary form.

        The newspak-1.7.tar.z distribution contains config files and readme
        files related to building uucp, news, and mail software under Linux
        from the various freely-available sources.  It can usually be found 
        on sunsite.unc.edu in the directory /pub/Linux/system/Mail.


3.0 Installing the Software

        [...much of this section is taken verbatim from the README file in
                the Taylor UUCP v1.04 sources - it's provided here so I can
                help you 'rtfm' instead of just telling you to do so...]

        Detailed compilation instructions are in uucp.texi in the sources.

        You can grab 'known good' conf.h and policy.h files for Linux 
        from the newspak distribution referred to in the 'other sources of
        information' section above.  In that case, you can probably go right
        to typing 'make'.

        To extract a gzip'd tar archive, I do the following:
                gunzip -c filename.tar.z | tar xvf -


3.1 Edit Makefile.in to set installation directories.
        
        Here, I set 'prefix' to "/usr" rather than the default
        of "/usr/local"


3.2 Run 'configure'

    Type ``sh configure''. 

    The configure script will compile a number of test programs to see
    what is available on your system and will calculate many things.

    The configure script will create conf.h from conf.h.in and
    Makefile from Makefile.in.  It will also create config.status,
    which is a shell script which actually creates the files.


3.2 Configure the future setup of the software

    Examine conf.h and Makefile to make sure they're right.
        - I took the defaults

    Edit policy.h for your local system.
        - set the type of lockfiles you want (HAVE_HDB_LOCKFILES) 
        - set the type of config files you want built in
                (HAVE_TAYLOR_CONFIG, HAVE_V2_CONFIG, HAVE_HDB_CONFIG)
        - set the type of spool directory structure you want
                (SPOOLDIR_HDB)
        - set the type of locking you want (HAVE_HDB_LOGGING)
        - set the default search path for commands
                (I added /usr/local/bin to mine...)

                
3.3 Compile and install the software

    Type ``make''.

    Use ``uuchk'' to check configuration files.  You can use
    ``uuconv'' to convert between configuration file formats.

    Type ``make install'' to install.


3.4 Set up the config files

        I'd recommend you start by taking the attached known-good
        config files for HDB mode and installing them.  

        Make sure that the Permissions file indicates exactly where 
        rmail and rnews are to be found if you put them anywhere 
        other than in the path you specified in policy.h

        Make sure that your Devices files matches the actual location
        of your modem (cua1=COM2 in the examples)

        Edit the Systems file to set up the system(s) you talk to
        with their speed, phone number, username, and password.
        *PROTECT THIS FILE AGAINST WORLD READ*

        Set up the Permissions file and add a set of lines for each
        site you talk to.  For security reasons, it's recommended to
        make sure they each have a separate account (if you allow dialin)
        and home directory so you can track things.


3.5 Give it a try

        /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -r 1 -x 9 -s remote_system_name

        The -x 9 will have maximum debugging information written to
        the /usr/spool/uucp/.Admin/audit.local file for help in initial
        setup. I normally run -x 4 here since that level logs details
        that help me with login problems. Obviously, this contains 
        cleartext information from your Systems file (account/password)
        so protect it against world-read. 


3.6 It doesn't work - now what ?

        In general, you can refer to the documentation mentioned above
        if things don't work.  You can also refer to your more experienced
        UUCP neighbors for help.  Usually, it's something like a typo
        anyway.


4.0 Frequently Asked Questions about Linux UUCP


4.1 Why is SLS uucp configured in HDB rather than 'Taylor' mode?

        Because IMHO it's the de-facto standard UUCP implementation at
        this time.  There are thousands of sites with experienced admins
        and there are many places you can get incredibly good information
        concerning the HDB setup.

        The uucp-1.04 that's in SLS 1.02 and later has all three modes of
        config files built in.  While I can't test it, I did 'rtfm' and Ian
        Taylor tells me that it should work.

        The search order for config files is Taylor...then V2 (L.sys)...  then
        HDB.  Use the uuconv utility in /usr/lib/uucp to convert config files
        from one mode to another.

        If you can't wait, grab the sources for uucp and specify
        HAVE_BNU_CONFIG, HAVE_V2_CONFIG *and* HAVE_TAYLOR_CONFIG in the
        policy.h file and type 'make'.
        
        The following workaround is ugly, but it does work, if you want 
        to run Taylor configs from binaries that don't have it built in...

        [... From mbravo@tctube.spb.su (Michael E. Bravo) ...]

         - add  '-I /usr/local/lib/uucp/config' to _every_ invocation of 
                whatever program in uucp package


4.1 Why do I get 'timeout' on connections when I upgraded to uucp-1.04 ?

        [... from Ed Carp - erc@apple.com ...]

        If you use a 'Direct' device in the Devices file, there's now a
        10 second timeout compiled in.  Make the name of the Device anything
        other than 'Direct'.  If you tweak the example /usr/lib/uucp files
        provided with SLS, you won't have problems with this one.

        [... from Greg Naber - greg@squally.halcyon.com ...]

        If you get chat script timeouts, you can tweak the sources by 
        editing at line 323 in uuconf/syssub.c and changing the default
        timeouts from 10 seconds to something larger.


4.2 Why doesn't HDB anonymous uucp seem to work ?

        The SLS anonymous uucp only works in Taylor mode because it's
        compiled with HAVE_TAYLOR_CONFIG.  If you want to do anon uucp in HDB
        mode, you'll have to recompile the sources with just HDB defined.
        Ian Taylor is considering which way to deal with this 'feature'...

        Also, Taylor in HDB mode seems to be sensitive to white space and
        blank lines.  To be safe, make sure that there are no blank lines 
        or trailing spaces in the Permissions file.

        Lastly, make sure that you have a file called remote.unknown in
        /usr/lib/uucp and that it's *NOT* executable.  See the O'Reilly+Assoc
        book "Managing UUCP and USENET" for details regarding this file.


4.3 What does 'no matching ports found' mean ?

        In all probability, you are attempting to use a device
        (/usr/lib/uucp/Devices) that doesn't exist, or the device you've
        specified in the /usr/lib/uucp/Systems file doesn't match up with
        any valid devices in the Devices file.

        Following this are *sanitized* versions of my working Taylor 1.04
        HDB config files that you can plug in and use...

        note the 'ACU' in the Systems ?  That tells which 'port' to use in
        Devices

        see the 'scout' word in Systems ?  That tells which dialer to use
        in Dialers.  

        If you had a ACU port, but none that matched the specified dialer
        on the same line in Systems, you'll get that message.


4.4 What are known good config files for HDB mode ?

        The following are 'known-good' config files for Taylor 1.04 under
        Linux in HoneyDanBer mode.  They work on kernels of 0.99-8 or
        later. All files should be in /usr/lib/uucp unless you've tweaked
        the sources to put the uucp library elsewhere.

        If you're running a kernel of 0.99-7 or earlier, change 'cua1' to
        'ttyS1'.
