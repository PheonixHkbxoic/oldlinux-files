I may be experiencing some problems with my phisical memory.

Does anyone know how I can test physical memory?  Is there a utility
to do this?

Subject: Supra Internal Modem, Dial-In
Date: 19 Nov 1993 21:18:38 GMT

I'm having problems getting a Supra 14.4 internal modem to answer the
phone under Linux. Here's the problem: I have two modems connected to
my Linux system, one an Internal Supra 14.4, and one an external Supra
14.4 connected to COM2. I can dial out of the internal Supra just fine,
and I can dial in to the external supra just fine (running uugetty with
a fairly stupid script in /etc/default/uugetty.ttyS1), in fact, I can dial
out with the internal modem and dial into the external modem on the same
machine, etc. (I have two phone lines). However, when I disable
the external modem in /etc/inittab and enable the internal one, reboot,
and try to dial in to the internal modem via the external modem, uugetty
respawns as soon as the phone rings. 

Is there some setup I need to do? Or should I return the internal modem and
get an external one?  Oh, I set the board and serial port to use IRQ2 and
said it was a 16550. 

Thanks

Enough with this! the ext2 fs is competitive with the FFS, and with

Ok, I am doing this with some hesitation but I will do it anyway. We are going
to allowing people from the Linux background access to our mini network.
We have 2 Machines ( a 486DX50 running Slackware 1.1.0 which is the main
NFS Server and a 386DX40 which is a Dataless client.)  which are named
kpw104.rh.psu.edu and exg106.rh.psu.edu. These machines are named this way 
because we are students at Penn State and this is how the Center for Academic 
Computing issues such accounts. These machines are sitting in our dorm rooms
here. We are running what I like to refer to as "Cheap mans NIS". Which means
that it is a pain in that &^$ to keep the UID's and groups and etc. the same on
both machines, But so far so good. If you want more information about this 
system, there is going to be a first come, first serve system of giving out 
user accounts. We like to share with every one so this is why we are opening 
this up, (hopefully we will not get burnt). You must have a decent purpose 
for wanting to get an account. We are also doing this for the support that
we can get from you. In order to apply for an account, telnet to either machine
and login as guest. There is no password for this. It may take awhile to grant
the account to you as we are students and have our own work to attend to.
Any feedback about the system once the account has been established should be
sent to either root, me (wilcox), Lance Knight (knight), Eylon Geva (geva),
or Mike Cramer(cramer). {Mike is a little busy so please refer to the last 
group of people.} By the way, mail to either machine goes to the same place,
so take your pick of machines to send to. I will be waiting to see the people
that will apply and I hope that you can get some insight into the Linux 
environment (If you are getting started) or we can all learn together from this.


-Ken Wilcox

Ps. Disk space will be very limited so do not be surprised if you can not 
write that much. Any installation of software should be done by the 
"source" group. You can send mail to "source" if you want a program installed
or if you want to become part of the source group, send mail to "accts" 
requesting such.

Does anyone out there know a quick & dirty (or clean) way to provide
additional security beyond /etc/passwd for logins?  Ideally, I would
like /etc/profile to start a task to kill the login in 30 seconds if
a "magic command" is not entered.

Any existing scripts/programs to do this would be greatly appreciated!
...or any alternative approaches
...or, just a way for a script started from /etc/profile to know the
   PID or user-id of the person logging in (I can handle the rest).

BTW- the Unix dialect is Linux (Slackware 1.1.0)

Bill is partially right here, what you "should" do is this...

If you are using bash as you Bourne shell ("/bin/sh"), then what you
should do is name it /bin/bash and symlink /bin/sh that it.  If you
are using the pdksh or ash or whatever, do the same.  This way, you
and your users are well reminded that /bin/sh is not a "true" Bourne
shell.

The reason I recommend using a symlink rather than a hard link is
because it is much more "noticible" than a hard link.  They also don't
have that hard link "way of becoming their own file".

I also do the same for my csh replacement, tcsh.

So, in /bin, I have sh -> bash, and in /usr/bin, I have csh -> tcsh.

Getting back to the main issue,

#!/bin/sh should be used and tests done for the $BASH environment
variable.  Hard-coding #!/bin/bash is a bad idea.  Coding anything to
CRASH rather than report good error information is a BAD IDEA and poor
programming, whether it is a shell scripts or C++ ... a bad practice.

It would seem that the core size limit now defaults to zero.  In order to fix
this, you need to put "ulimit -c <size_in_kbytes>" in your /etc/profile (if
you're using bash) or the equivalent command for your shell in whatever place
would be appropriate.

Since the core size limit is a per-process value, I know of no way to change
it on a system-wide basis other than by hacking the kernel or hacking init.

This is solved by editing the /conf/net/host.conf. It should read something
like this:
order hosts,bind
multi on


The resolv.conf should look something like this:
domain your.domain
nameserver ip-num-of-local-nameserver

 You do NOT need to run named on your machine in order to have DNS.
The only reason to have a named running on your machine is if
your machine is going to be a nameserver.

Also, this is a FAQ, and it is covered in the NET-2 HOWTO.
Try reading the HOWTO's before posting a question - they
aren't perfect, but they are helpful.

I have used the (very nicely done) NET-2-FAQ and have still managed to fail

SLIP-FAQ or SERIAL-FAQ exist that would assist me?

(I can give lots of details about my system and the system I'm calling into

Is it a problem with my dip program?  I recently saw a patch for dip on
c.o.l.announce aobout a dip patch for some kernel versions.  I set up my
Linux about a month or two ago using the SLS distribution. 

--> Do I have a buggy dip program?

No, I don't think it acts like an lpd.
But you can talk to the JetDirect Ethernet Card with the TCP/IP protocol.
Have a look at the sources for hpnpf on your HP Unix CP (it is in the /usr/lib/hpnp/spoolersrc tree on my HP-UX system). It should compile with some minor changes. 
HP has a shell script which acts as filter: it captures the stdin and sends it with the hpnpf program to a special IP port (9100 as far as I remember) of the JetDirect card.

You may try out the protocol by open a telnet session with
      telnet your.laserjet.IP.address 9100
Everything you type now is printed on the laserjet.
