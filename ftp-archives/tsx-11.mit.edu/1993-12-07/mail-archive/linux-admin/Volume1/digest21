Date: Thu, 26 Aug 1993 21:33:40 GMT

I recently recompiled getty and installed it in /etc.. at that point,
getty would no longer run.. it would fail (with a note like the following
in getty.log:

Getty: (9600) Cannot open connect line

I had to reinstall getty from the SLS disks, at which point the system
started working again.

I started having this problem after upgrading to the new kernel, pl12.
One of my terminals, when firing up getty, will "spaz" getty via init
with this error.  Occasionally, it will work, but most of the time
it simply bugs out.

I'm using the latest libraries (4.4.1) and gcc (4.5.x?).

Suggestions?

I found that ^_ and ^\ on the uk keyboard were not working correctly
after installing pl12. If this trouble's you here's the patch.

I think on balance this is more c.o.l.admin than anything else.

    There's a shell script called savelog that comes with smail and in
the Taylor uucp package that could be adapted to work. It's saves
numbered backups for up to a week. You can run it from cron.

I guess this is a sort of 'me too' question, but with a few answers :-)
Yes, there are BBSes which work fine under Linux, but most of them are
hopeless (look on sunsite - there's a BBS directory there).

I'm looking for one which supports Internet mail and news. The only one
to do this is 'mbox' - but alas, it is all in German. (well it has some
English support, but there's still some German text I can't get rid of).

If someone knows of a good system, which supports mail and news, and doesn't
need hundreds of daemons to run, and isn't in German, please let me know!
Until then, I'll stick with Nyx's menu system, posted to alt.sources a
few months back.

Cheers,
Jon.

Yes, but due to the way in which unix passwords are encrypted, each
password uses an encryption key (called a "salt"), which is stored as the
first two characters of the encrypted password.  When you are attempting 
to crack a list of passwords, you must actually re-encrypt your test word
for _each_ of the salts used in the password, and as there are (I think)
4096 different possible salts, chances are that you will have to
re-encrypt your test password for each of the encrypted passwords in the
list, and thus it is no quicker to attempt for a list of passwords, than
for each password individually.

Without a doubt, shadow passwords are the best password security system
in use.

Hello,

I'm pretty new to the LINUX stuff but I've been running a small Sun network
(well sometimes it has been running me :-)) and I'm setting up a prototype
system to plug a move of the DOS machines to LINUX and I need to get
YP running.  Can anyone let me know how to set it up or get a copy of
some equivalent software.

What I have now is the SLS 1.02 cdrom, but I do have internet access through
this account.  Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Waffle works with no hacking at all.  I took care of getting the settings

I'm guessing here but it sounds like it's not because those programs
are suid but because they have permissions like -rwx--x--x as would be
typical for an SLS installation.

In spite of the fact that I think this kind of security paranoia is
ludicrous, I have already modified the next version of the nfs-server
so that execute-only programs do work correctly over NFS.

For the time being, you may revive your system as follows:

        # find / -type f -perm +0001 -print | xargs chmod +r

This makes all world-executable files also readable, as they should
be.  Or if you are in a more cautious mood try:

        # chmod +r /bin/* /usr/bin/*

Then again, you are free to pick and choose.

The "any password" assumption is wrong because passworts are salted, i.e.
there are 4096 different methods to encode any one password. This "salt"
value is coded in the first two characters of your (encrypted) password.

Thus, to check if your guess is correct, you still have to encode it
150 times.

I could solve the problem by changing ownership of all the files in

How and why it was working earlier and suddenly stopped one nice morning

I think this is a simple question, but I cannot find the answer:

--- How do I allow non-root user's to write to a MSDOS-formated disk?

    ( All files are owned by root and are mode 644 or 755 )

I use my FAT disk's for common development stash under a couple of
operating systems, and writing is essential.  Plus, I perfer not to
operate as superuser except when needed.

I've scoured the /linux/fs/msdos source code but didn't see anything
