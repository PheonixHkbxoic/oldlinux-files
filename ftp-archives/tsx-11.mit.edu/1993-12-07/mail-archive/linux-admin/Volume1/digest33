Just for fun try adding an entry for one of the remote hosts into the hosts
file on your upgraded system.  Then attempt to telnet to it from the host
that you added into its hosts file.  The message you are probably getting
now if you look into the log file is that you have a name/name mismatch
between what the host sees sent to it and the looked up full domain name
that a dns server may be supplying.  This excersise should help to
determine that.

After a brief look at the source to the MCC distribution's getty (agetty),
I can say that you can't get rid of the hostname without recompiling the
source. Fair enough? <grin>

true.

Well, what we actually want is to have an 'professional' Unix
distrubution. SLS looks very messy in some places and lots of
permissions aren't correct. If you want to use Linux in a company
or something like this you will need to clean up the directory
trees, e.g putting all README's into one seperate directory, putting
detailed comments into config files.
At the end of all this I'd like to see a Linux that you install
easily and that you can put the system to the net without risking
any security problems.

This bug report form sounds good, it will really help a lot. We will
work something out and present it on here then.

Correct, and we don't want to deal too much with these problems, only
with the structure of the SLS and the Linux specific things.

I really hope that our German wide group will be able to support this
and that it won't die like so many other pub ideas after some beers :-)

We have founded a mailing list where we talk about what to improve in
the sls. If there are people outside Germany interested in joining it,
we might think about internationalizing it...

I don't think that a newsgroup would be necessary. We collect the bugs
and post them frequently in a single list to c.o.l.announce, who wants
to contribute bugs or anything that might be improved in the SLS,
should send a report about it to me.

This is not the case under SLS (I'm not disputing your claim, just offering
a data point).  In /etc/gettydefs, each line corresponds to a speed.
In the field before you see login:, you'll find @S stuck in there.
Remove the @S and you'll get login: instead of <hostname> login:.
I know this isn't terribly descriptive, but you know the story about
me being here and it being there...

Before hundreds if not thousands of people panic at the prospect of having to
recompile their kernels and make them 100k bigger just to install X, I think
someone had better point out that this is wrong :)

X runs fine using unix sockets instead of TCP - you do not need networking
support to run X.

Enough misinfomation on this triviality.  telnetd doesn't touch getty.
You need to recompile login, which has been printing the hostname
since the 0.12 days.
