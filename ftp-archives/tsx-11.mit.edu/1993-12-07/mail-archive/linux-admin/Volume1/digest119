In /usr/lib/smail/routers, comment out the "match-inet-addrs:" section,
and uncomment the section further down which starts "match_mx_hosts:".

match-inet-addrs tells the mailer to look up the IP address of the host
the mail is destined for, and then connect directly to its smtp daemon.
This completely fails for hosts with an MX record.

The man page states that match_mx_records is a fully BIND compatible 
mail router that does all the proper lookups of MX records.  I can now
send mail to UUCP hosts and other such beasties that I couldn't touch
before.  

All this is documented in the man page, but it takes a whilel to wade
through it.

NFS-mounting of /var/spool/mail seems to work very well, if two
conditions are met:

[1] All of the NFS-client machines send _all_ "local" mail to the NFS
    server, for delivery by the server's sendmail/smail daemon.  [This
    avoids the need to give the client machines trusted-root access to
    the spool directory, and also avoids sendmail/sendmail collisions
    during delivery.]

    Current versions of SunOS sendmail (and Solaris too, I assume) have
    this feature built in... regardless of what the local-delivery
    ruleset may say, SunOS 4.1.x sendmail does SMTP delivery to the NFS
    server if it realizes that it is an NFS-client of /var/spool/mail.

[2] Some form of network file locking is used to keep the mail
    user-agent (mail, mush, etc.) from tripping over the mail transfer
    agent (sendmail/smail), so that mail is not accidentally lost if a
    user-agent tries to update a mailbox while sendmail is trying to
    extend it (or vice versa).

SunOS seems to do both of these things just fine (these days... things
were not so rosy in earlier versions of SunOS).  I suspect that Linux
would require manual configuration of sendmail/smail to meet the
requirements of rule [1], and I don't know whether it supports locking
as required in [2].

I use a NEC CDR-84 CDROM Driver on my Anonymous UUCP site. I have had
enormous problems with it. The answer is to use this drive as the last
device on the SCSI chain and to disable "sync mode" + "Parity" mode on the
Adaptec controler.

On my system, I have 2 HA1540b:
- 1st SCSI controler: IBM 1Gb SCSI disk, GigaTape (DAT SCSI Unit)
- 2nd controler: NEC CDROM, Hitachi CDROM.

I tried to have all 4 devices on the same controler: it was a real PITA.

I have the following tiny mail-server running on Linux. It's very insecure
but it's only local so I don't bother. The trick is as follows: create an
account to do the auto-reply (in my case: mailsrvr). In the home-dir of
that account make the file .forward that contains the line:

        "| /usr/users/mailsrvr/ms"

This way, any mail is piped thru the shell-script ms which looks like:

#!/bin/sh
cd `dirname $0`
trap "rm -f $$.00 $$.01" 0
csplit -s -f $$. - '/^$/'
fgrep -is mail-server-request $$.00 && for fl in `cat $$.01`
  do if [ -f "$fl" ]; then ( uuencode `basename "$fl"` < "$fl" ) 2>&1
     elif [ -d "$fl" ]; then ( ls -alF "$fl" ) 2>&1; else cat ms.hlp; break; fi
  done | mail `sed -n 's/^From: */</;s/  */>/;s/.*<\(.*\)>.*/\1/p' $$.00`
exit 0

The help-file (/usr/users/mailsrvr/ms.hlp) looks like:

        Dear Requester,
        
        Your request should only contain pathnames, separated by whitespace.
        No pathname may refer to a special file, named pipe, socket, fifo ...
        Directories will be listed (ls -alF), files will be uuencoded and the
        results concatenated. To separate responses, send separate requests.
        
        The rest of your request was ignored.

What you want is not the mail-server functionality, but someway or another,
you have to figure out the return address from the header you get; so, what
you need is something like this line:

mail `sed -n 's/^From: */</;s/  */>/;s/.*<\(.*\)>.*/\1/p' [the-header-you-get]`
followed by the file you want to send as a response.

Good luck!                                                      HdH.

PLEASE REPLY TO u90rjm@uk.ac.ox.prg
===================================
I've been having a few difficulties setting up loopback links for tcp/ip
on my Linux (0.99 pl8) box. Wonder if anyone can help ...

I've set up the kernel to include all the network stuff. I've then set the
machine up so that it runs /etc/rc.net on startup - successfully starting
portmap, inetd, named etc. No errors are reported to /usr/log/*. I've also
set all the config files for named up using the /etc/hostcvt.build script.

So far so good ...

I can then rlogin into my own machine IF I AM ROOT. But I get 'unknown
host' messages if I am any other user. If I run named with debugging switched
on I can see the message missed 'nodename' as '' when I attempt to reference
my machine as a non-root user. Apparently root doesn't seem to use named!

If anyone is interested I can send the named config files to them by mail,
and a debug log!!

The second network problem is that a loopback mount:

        mount <nodename>:/dev/hda7 /mnt

fails with an 'RPC timed out' message, resulting in mountd continuously
retrying ... any ideas?

I'm using the networking stuff that came with SLS 1.01 which I believe is
pre "net-2" (whatever that means). I really don't want to be upgrading
just so I can do loopback stuff. Its not essential to me, but it _should_
work, and talk isn't that great without it (and I _do_ have async terminals,
so talk is a bit useful!).

Here is the scenario. I just applied for and received a domain name
under the .us domain. So I turn to my friendly neighborhood System Admin
(you know, the guy they pay alot of money to figure out things) and I
ask him to set me up for a UUCP mail feed. The very informed response i
got was to figure out myself how to do it and let him know.

I figured the first place to start would be sendmail. I figured that
there would have to be some rule written which would take mail which is
sent to jdoe@callis_group.sf.ca.us (which of course is being routed to
USF) and send it to the uucp spool area for my Linux box to call in and
pick up. So how would I do that, and what files would have to be
updated? The sysadmin has already placed me in the DNS (I thought that
was unnecessary), and i thought that a MX record needed to be created.

Secondly, you UUCP types, I need to know how to set up a machine to
receive UUCP mail request, and forward them accordingly. I have read
Managing UUCP and Usenet from O'Reilly and Associates, but it covers
calling out under UUCP, not dialing in.

Any help would be appeciated.

Date: 21 Oct 1993 08:31:29 -0400

Hello,
        I just finished installing the SLS release out of tsx-11.mit.edu
(the whole thing, a,b c, d, s, t and X), everything went perfectly, I did
it in about 30 min., swapping disks the fastest I could (I got to get to
work), this gives a new meaning to the words 'Disc Jockey' :-)

        Anyhow, when I try to boot from the HD, it goes L then I then it
freezes.  When I try from the floppy boot disk, it goes on pretty good
until almost to the end (it is very close to where the login prompt would
be) and finally says the following :

        init: can't load library '/lib.so.4'
                No such library

        Now, I suspect that either the lib is not there or the link was
badly or not constructed.  I tried to mount the partition from the A1.5
disk to create the link myself (or correct it) but it didn't like any
of the 'mount -t ' commands with either e2fs linuxext or other type of
mount partition type.

        Did I get a bad disk or file, I hear you ask.  I think not since
all the sizes on the net and on my disks compare and no errors occured
during the install.

        Anybody out there can help me out with this.

        Love what all of you are doing for Linux, when will there be a
Linux for IBM RS/6000 (AIX sucks eggs).

Well, you can make lilo boot with vmlinuz, why not?

BTW, one thing which is rather crucial but is not clearly singled out in
the manual is that in order to boot Linux LILO must have three files for
its own use:

        a boot map              {this it builds when you run it}
        a boot loader           {this is usually boot.b}
        a Linux kernel          {this is usually a copy of zImage}

and that since LILO builds pointers to their blocks, if any is altered
LILO must be rerun to recompute those pointers.

I have found that the most flexible option for booting is actually
botting from a floppy; this sounds backwards, but it's actually rather
convenient. It is also easy:

        * fdformat /dev/fd0H1440
        * mkfs -t ext2 /dev/fd0H1440
        * mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0H1440 /mnt

creates and mounts an empty partition on a floppy. The I copy
/etc/lilo/boot.b to /mnt/lilo.boot, zImage to /mnt/vmlinuz, and I
specify in /etc/lilo/config the appropriate lines (I call the map
/mnt/lilo.map); so in the end one has in the root of the floppy the
following files: "lilo.map lilo.boot vmlinuz". Other kernel images can
be added; it's useful to have a generic kernel with almost every device
configured in, and I call it "vmlinuz.any". That's all.

One can not only put several alternative kernels ona floppy, have
different boot floppies, and so on. It is also useful to have another
floppy with a miniroot filesystem on it, for disaster recovery; to use
it one simply boots the usual floppy, but with a different root
directory (the floppy), and perhaps with a suitable RAM disk size.

Having a boot floppy has at least two advantages, apart from flexibility
in choosing what/how to boot: if you have another OS, you need not
change its booting arrangements at all, and installing Linux can be
totally transparent; there is no problem with limitations of the disk
BIOS, e.g. wrt more than 1204 cylinders, as the boot is entirely from
the floppy, and once the Linux kernel is running, there is no problem.

I'm not sure why you have a lost+found on only one partition. But it 
is not a problem.  In fact, you should create one for each partition.
when you run e2fsck, if it finds files, ie inodes, that are allocated
but have no entry in any directory, e2fsck can reconnect it if you 
desire. It is done by creating a file in the lost+found directory with a
name that correstondes to the inode number. This gives you a chance to
"save" the file.

I would recommend you create lost+found directories on _ALL_ of your
partitions. this can be done by the following script:

        mkdir <mountpoint>/lost+found
        i=100
        while [ i -gt 0 ]
        do
                touch tmp$i
                i=`expr $i + 1 `
        done
        rm tmp*

You do need to do the touch part to insure that there are enough
slots already in the directory, so e2fsck doesn't have to try 
and allocate additional blocks for these directory entries when
the free block list might be messed up.

Hope this helps.

It does not require XS3.  I'm using it quite happily with SLS-1.02/XFree-1.2

I had absolutely no problems, beyond getting it customized the way I wanted
it.  It ran fine right out of the box, and in my pinion is a great product.
I got it early on, as well.  I don't know of any problems with installation.

Subject: Help with routing under Linux
Date: 21 Oct 1993 12:03:07 -0700

(Hi, I posted trough the Mailing lists and got an overwhelming
response. ZERO messages, so here it goes again, over here.)

Hi,
(I checked the NET2_HOWTO and I see no mention of ROUTED).
Basically I am trying to use a Linux machine as a router (gateway?)
I have 2 networks, using IP address: 198.187.207.xxx and 150.8.4.xxx.
And I want to route them trough a Linux box.  THis is a 386DX25 with 4MB
of RAM.  (Should only be running as a router, so no X or any heavy duty things)

I installed to SMC Elite 16 cards.
        eth0: 0x300,IRQ10, ADDR 0xD0000
        eth1: 0x280,IRQ11, ADDR 0xD4000
These are 16 bit cards with 16K of shared mem.
Now, I configured computer using IFCONFIG and ROUTE and both ports
work ok (independantly)  I can ping to the network in eth0 and telnet and
everything.  The same is true if I connecto to hosts in the eth1 networks.
When I enter route to lists the kernel routes I guet:

        Destination net/address Gateway address Flags   RefCnt  Use     Iface
        150.8.4.0               *               UH      0       86      eth0
        198.187.207.0           *               UH      0       6       eth1
        localhost               *               UH      0       101     lo

Now, the fun part.  When I try using "routed".  The routes change to:

        Destination net/address Gateway address Flags   RefCnt  Use     Iface
        150.8.4.0               *               UH      0       86      eth0
        198.187.207.0           *               UH      0       6       eth1
        150.8.4.0               utx.unitrx.com  UGN     0       0       eth0
        198.187.207.0           utx.unitrx.com  UGN     0       0       eth1
        localhost               *               UH      0       101     lo

(utx.unitrx.com is the name of the localhost)  When routed is running
I can't neither send nor recieve.  Or at least when I do a "ping", i
get nothing.  That is if a enter "ping someotherhost" I get nothing in
return but looking at the lights on the network card (It has the RX,
TX LEDs, I see those lights blinking.  These lights are usually off if
we are not active)  However, doing a ping localhost works ok.

After a while (say more than 1 minute) the routes seem to reset to the
following:

        Destination net/address Gateway address Flags   RefCnt  Use     Iface
        localhost               *               UH      0       101     lo


I have try running routed with the -t and logfile option and this is
what I get.

Please, somebody help me.  I would really appreciate it if you do I am
completely stump on this.  Also, while we are at it.  How do you do

Subject: Security for dialin
Date: Thu, 21 Oct 1993 17:43:54 GMT

I guess I'm just not understanding my books right, but I still need to
clamp down security for a dial-up Linux system I'll be bringing online
shortly.

I've not been able to lock down the /etc directory files, and users can
copy them freely to their directories.  They can't write back to /etc
because I do have that bit set off properly, but that's as far as I can
lock down the directory because when I kill read access, Pine and Elm,
etc. can't see the /etc/passwd file to tell who's calling.

Am I being too paranoid?  Do I even need to worry about users copying the
passwd file?  I know even if they know enough to nab the shadow file, they
won't get a decipherable password to get in, but I'd rather not let casual
users even get a list of users on the system (for reasons not obvious, but
it's what I need to do).

I've run Cops 1.04 and taken care of most of the other problems it
reported (except it still reports userid anonymous as being too long).

Any help, assistance, etc. appreciated from those who have brought up a
dialin Linux/SLS 1.03 system.

Dave
