I have now included the Linux-specific stuff from Pauline's authd/identd
(which was based on an old Pidentd (version 1)) into the latest version of
Pidentd (version 2.2beta, soon to be non-beta).

You can find it on ftp.lysator.liu.se:pub/ident/servers as the
file "pidentd-2.2beta.2.tar.gz", or on ftp.uu.net at the address below
as soon as it has mirrored ftp.lysator.liu.se (which is the master
distribution point).

You do?  Most of the modern 1G drives have like 256K of cache.  I expect
that number to hit in the 1M range before very long.  Most of the modern
drives are also REALLY fast, and have a WHOLE LOT of geometry wierdness,
bad blocks & re-maps.  To try and build all this into your filesystem
code is plainly ludicrous.  SURE, it might net you another 3-5% in
performance, assuming you get it right and tweak the hell out of it for
each particular drive in question (NOT drive type, each INDIVIDUAL
drive).

Secondly you STILL need to optimize to keep your filesystem clustering
reads/writes on back to back block numbers, letting the drive figure the
best way to actually retrieve/scribble the blocks.  It doesn't take a
mac genious to figure that the closer the block numbers the closer the
data is on disk.

I'd be willing to bet that there is some pretty nifty ROM code on some
of the new superfast SCSI-II drives, to really optimize all this ON the
drive.  I think you'd be hard pressed to actually DEMONSTRATE any
appreciable performance improvement with today's disk drives by rolling
your own cylinder, head, sector optimizations.

The NET-2-FAQ has been superceded by the NET-2-HOWTO posted to c.o.l.announce
just yesterday. I know of many people who are reading and relying on the
VERY outdated NET-2-FAQ although I have tried to make it quite clear that
this document is OBSOLETE. Apparently people are still picking it up from
a few (ahem) FTP sites where it still lingers.

Please, if you see a copy of the NET-2-FAQ with a release date before
November 1993, please nuke it and replace it with the NET-2-HOWTO from
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO.

Thanks.

I am not sure whether or not slip.o being compiled in means anything
or not (you are probably right in assuming that it does), but I had
the same problems until I added a line in
/usr/src/linux/drivers/net/CONFIG that said:

CARDS           = -DSLIP

... and of course the normal:

SLIP_OPTS       = -DSL_DUMP -DSL_COMPRESSED


Hope this helps.

Ahh, but what you quote above is MORE than 12-14kbps.  It takes about 10
bits to send a character; if you get 1.5kBytes/s, your connection is 15 kpbs.
If you send 2.5kBytes/s, your connection is 'effectively' 25 kbps.

My adapter/drive combination (Adaptec 1542B and Wangtek 5525ES) seems to
disconnect during lengthy operations. There is a longer timeout for the
things expected to take long. If I remember correctly, I at some time
found the location where the short timeout was incorrectly used (it was
not an obvious place) and corrected it. The correction must then be
among some other patches which I will submit to Eric Youngdale for
inclusion in the official kernel very soon. I am just waiting for a second
opinion for one of the patches. If someone else wants to try the patched
driver, just drop me a note.

>(Gimme a chance!  I haven't even got this thing booting reliably yet.)

        It is also possible that the tape drive itself is not smart enough to
disconnect.  I now have a utility available that can be used to query all scsi
devices and find out information from their mode pages - the
disconnect/reconnect page would be of particular interest here.  If the drive
does not have a disconnect/reconnect page, this would imply that it would
hold onto the bus during long operations.

        The latest version of the utility is called scsiinfo-1.4.tar.gz on
tsx-11 in pub/linux/ALPHA/scsi, and it has a really cool X-based interface that
lets you modify parameters and send them back to the drive.  You need to have
wish (part of Tcl/Tk) to use the X-interface, but it is still possible to get a
display of the information from the drive without having wish or X on your
system.
