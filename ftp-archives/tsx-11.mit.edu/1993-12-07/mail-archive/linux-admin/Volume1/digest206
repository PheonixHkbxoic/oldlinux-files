Gidday Fokes.

As a MsDos user who had problems himself with installing Linux I figured
it wouldn't be a bad idea if somebody wrote basically a Installation and
Command Reference Book for new Linux users. I've started work on it
already and was wondering what people would want in a book like this. I
mean we've no doubt all gone out and brought Unix books and found that
some of the commands just don't apply and spent the next day trying to
find something remotely similar.

Okay - so you're going now after working it out but wouldn't you rather
have had a quick reference book of some type. If you're like myself you
probably didn't even know about the FAQS. Okay myself I seem a bit denser
that the average user but I didn't have access to the Internet at the
time. I wouldn't want anybody else going through what I did to get started
with Linux, Would you?

Well I've made a start on a reference book but I've a few questions to
ask that you can answer that would help make if easier for people in the
future to go to Linux from Dos or Os/2. Your help with this would be
greatly appreciated.

1.   What commands do you think would be of most benefit to the new
     user and how involved would you want the commands?

2.   What type of format would you want the book arranged in and a few
     reasons as to why? What sort of chapters would you find useful.
     ie Installing Linux, Linux Commands etc.

3.   Would you want if taylored to suit a specific brand of Linux ie
     Yggdrasil, Sls etc or just in general with references to each
     specific brand of Linux.

4.   How about a Dos Command/Linux Command equivalent section? Would
     you find this useful if you knew the Dos command and could just
     look up the equivalent Linux command.

5.   How about a list of available software for Linux with info like
     where to get it and what it does. Great advertising for you
     software authors out there. If you want your software included in
     this Email me at Davin.George@f370.n771.z3.fidonet.org along with
     a description of the software, version number, any specific
     requirements ie needs SLS 99.13.25 and the filesize and where it
     can be obtained from.

6.   Any specific topics you'ld like covered in detail ie Installing
     and Running UUCP etc.

Okay so this is going to take a while to do so I allowing for it not
being finished for about 18 Months. If you a know a specific topic or
subject backwards and would like a bit of recognition for it Email me.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Okay,I did that...and I set up all my file permissions like the
/usr/spool/lp1 should be owned by daemon...
now I get this error:

lpr: connect: Invalid argument
jobs queued, but cannot start daemon.

Any other ideas anyone??
I think this should be added to the faq since it's asked so often :)

Subject: Shutdown: /dev/xx (usr) busy ???
Reply-To: eedwpz@aachen.ericsson.se
Date: Mon, 6 Dec 1993 08:20:08 GMT

I have problems shutting down my Linux system - every time shutdown
complains that my /usr device is still busy.
Understandable, since apparently shutdown does not care (or wait??)
to kill the daemons running under /usr (such as lpd or syslog). [When I
kill then manually before the shutdown the message disappears.]

Since this leaves the FS 'unclean' for the next boot, I'd rather have
shutdown take care of killing daemons automatically.

Any help? (From the time I worked on a Pyramid 90x, I remember that there existed
a program /etc/killall that did the job. Anything like this for Linux?)

TIA,
Walter

 Sounds very nice. How about downloading the "Installation and getting

 work. Maybe you'll find a lot of the things you are planning are
 already done...

 The "Linux Documentation Project", alpha released manuals can be found
 (for instance !) on sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/doc/LDP.

Check comp.os.linux.announce about now, or real soon now, for the

I'd like to know please :)

pl14 handles slip and cslip. Some known bugs are listed.

The NET-2-HOWTO (as are the rest of the Linux HOWTO's) is available on
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs

If after reading the HOWTO you are still stuck, mail me, and I will
offer what assistance I am able, and bounce you somewhere else if I
can't.

I've picked up the following way to do netbios with TCP/IP for Linux - and
if I ever get it compiled under 99.13 or 99.14 I'll post it...

From the README file for Server 1.0.

This is a netbios implementation using TCP/IP and it should work with
any netbios TCP/IPs... *(I'm going to test it with PC/TCP 2.11 and Lan

Nope, that won't do: The problem is that *IF* you get a read error, it will
probably trash a whole sector (1024 bytes). The ecc-1.2.1 package can't
save you there! -- What you have to do is to 'interleave' the ecc; ie you
take, say 32, 1Kb blocks and perform the ecc on byte 0 of block [0..31], then
an ecc on byte 1, ... and so forth. This means that you really have 1024 ECC's
protecting your sector!. The bad thing about this is you have to read blocks
of 32Kb (or whatever), and have to perform 1024 ECC computations.

The QIC-80 standard (used in the ftape driver) guarantees that you can
correct one of the following:
 1 CRC failure (ECC error) and NO CRC errors (ECC erasures)
or:
 up to 3 CRC errors (ECC erasures).
As every sector is protected by a CRC code (the one from your floppy
controller), it's _very_ likely that an error is detected by the CRC code
(this is called  an CRC error / ECC erasure), this is a very efficient way
of doing things. [What's the difference between an 'error' and a 'erasure'?:
An erasure is an error, which you know the position of. This makes the
correction part much easier]

Subject: Re: Linux as a DOS fileserver?
Date: Mon, 6 Dec 1993 14:27:34 GMT



Okay.  Lokks like nobody is answering this guys question - so let me take a
shot:

We have a TCP/IP based network here, which consists of a number of Unix
based servers (including several Linux boxes), and a number of DOS and/or
Linux based PC workstations.

Our primary business involves DOS-based development of software for embedded
microprocessor systems.  ALL of our code development is done using shared
drives on the network servers (INCLUDING Linux NFS servers).  This can be
done using the standard networking software that comes with just about
any Linux distribution.  We are running Slackware here, for the most part.
All you need to do under Linux is make sure that you are running the
PC-NFS daemons (included with Slackware, and REM'ed out in the sample
rc.inet2 file), and that you setup the directories you wish exported in
/etc/exports.

On the DOS side of things, we run a commercial TCP/IP networking packages
called PC-NFS, put out by FTP Software.  It gives you all of the usual
Unix networking clients (ftp, telnet, etc), and allows you to NFS mount
an exported directory from any Unix server, as a drive letter on your PC that
is running DOS.

For example, when running DOS, I have my home directory from the primary
server mounted as H:, with the code that I am currently working on "checked
out" into a subdirectory on that drive letter.  Shared code (shared by other
developers) is on another host file system, which is mounted as S:.  Some
shared development tools that are CD-ROM based, as well as some auxilliary
drive space, are mounted from a Linux NFS server.

Soooo... does that answer your question?  Linux can INDEED perform as a DOS
file server, as long as you use the right networking software (TCP/IP
compliant) on your DOS PC's.  There are several commercial offerings other
than from FTP Software, but I am not totally familiar with them.  There
currently are not PD/Shareware offerings that provide NFS services, whicj
you need in order to mount a Network File System as a drive on your DOS
PC.

Good luck!
