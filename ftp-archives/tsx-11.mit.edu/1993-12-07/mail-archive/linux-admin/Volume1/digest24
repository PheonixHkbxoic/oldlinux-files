Of course you can! The complete source is included so you only have to 
translate some stuff. I compiled/installed the program last nite and I
think that Volker Schuermann did a great job on that one. It is fully
configurable on a per-level basis; you can restrict email to local
email only, allow mails to some given domains (uucp-neighbours, e.g.)
etc, the same with news. Online-games, file-sections, chat-system and
other goodies are also included. It compiles nearly out of the box.

Subject: Making a bootdisk/rootdisk combo

How does one make a bootdisk/rootdisk combo, or a bootable root disk?

I'm asking because I'd like to have an emergency stand-alone boot disk
which doesn't rely on the hard disk.  I can't use SLS disk a1 because
it hangs when it probes my cheap NE2000 ethernet clone board (both
versions 1.02 and 1.03).  Whenever I need to boot without mounting my
hard disk, I have to yank out the ethernet card.  If I can make my own
bootable root disk, then I won't have to yank the ethernet card each
time.

Thanks.

Subject: fsck and partitioning.
From: hjstein@sunrise.huji.ac.il (Harvey J. Stein)
Date: 29 Aug 93 12:31:39


I posted about a week ago, asking about the proper procedure for using
fsck.  I wanted to run it from /etc/rc, but I only have one linux
partition, the root partition, which has to be mounted before the
program can be run (since the program is on that partition, of course).

Juha Laiho (Wolf, jlaiho@ichaos.nullnet.fi), said to look at the
bootutils package (bootutils-9.1.tar.tz).  So I did.  However, I don't
understand exactly how it works.

It's README says that it mounts the root filesystem readonly, runs
fsck, and then if there are no problems it remounts the root and
mounts the other filesystems.  However, what if there is a problem?
If the root file system has been damaged, how can this fsck fix it
if the root was mounted readonly?  Does it write directly to the
device file in /dev?  What should I do when fsck finds an error?

The README also gives an example code fragment for running fsck in
/etc/rc.  Here's the example:

    # Check the integrity of all filesystems
    /bin/fsck -A -a
    # If there was a failure, drop into single-user mode.
    if [ $? -gt 1 ] ; then
            echo fsck failed.  Please reboot.
            sh
    fi

So, after a crash, if there's a disk problem, the system will drop
immediately into a shell and tell me to reboot.  Do I need to run sync
first?  Can I run fsck again at this point to make sure everything is
ok?  Should I reboot with the shutdown command or should I just hit
the power switch?

Also, according to one UNIX book that I looked at, one can run fsck
from single user mode.  How can I get linux into single user mode?
Can I run fsck from this mode?  What is the procedure?

Thanks.

Hi,
I have a problem with creating some user-accounts. Creating and setting
up them with useradd is no problem, but I don't know how to handle
the following:
Normally, a user gets a dummy-password, like 23ycbf or so. When he logs
in the first time, he types user and the dummy-password. 
After this, he should get a message to change his password and the 
usual procedure for changing (automatically). I know that's possible,
I have seen this on some systems, e.g. AIX. But the guy I asked didn't
know, they use a motif-based tool for this .. (aaaaarrrrrgggggghhhhh).
Now, how to play with passwd and useradd to get it go ?
Please reply by e-mail.

Well why on earth was it reporting:
"Getty: (9600) cannot open connect line" then?
From that I would guess (though I haven't been into the code) that
it's trying to open a line called '9600'.
I had this problem and solved it by putting the tty where the man
told me it should be. As far as I can see this appears to be the
problem...What do you think it is?

Because, as the poster originally reported, he had grabbed the original
getty_ps sources and recompiled it.  For that matter, I don't think the
sources in the "s" series are prepatched, either.  Read, please.  I *did*
check that before posting.

Subject: Let's collect KNOWN BUGS
Date: Sun, 29 Aug 1993 10:58:20 GMT

Hello,

on a networking congress here in Kiel some German Linuxers
decided to create a Linux workshop. One of our ideas was
to collect a list called "KNOWN BUGS". This list should be
mainly an index to bugs in the SLS distribution, i.e its single
packages. The SLS is great, no question, but there are some
security lacks, some programs don't work etc.

I'd like everyone who detected a bug (no matter if severe or
not) to follow up to this article or mail the description of
the bug to me. I will maintain this list and post it
frequently to comp.os.linux.announce. I'd also like to see
possible fixes for the bugs in this list. Another entry for
each bug might be a classification of the bug: severe, akzeptable,
not-a-real-bug or something like this.

What does the rest of you think about it?

Kai

Subject: denial of service attacks
Date: Sun, 29 Aug 1993 20:27:22 GMT

Hi,
  While reading the excellent _Practical Unix Security_ by Garfinkel and
Spafford (published by O'reilly & associates), I was made aware of denial
of service attacks.  One of the best ways to prevent such attacks I 
subsequently found out, was to force limits on the user via the ulimit
command.  After doing a 'ulimit -a' however, I realized that I do not know 
what constitutes reasonable limits.  Does anyone else?
  Here are my current unacceptble limits:
core file size     unlimited     # this I could change to say, 2 MB
data seg size      unlimited     # I know what a data seg is but what's normal?
max file size      unlimited     #
stack size         unlimited     #
cpu time           unlimited     #
pipe size          7             # I have no clue what this one is
open files         32            # This one seems ok

  The users will be mostly reading news and mail, I don't expect heavy
compilations, etc.

  I would like to offer certain infamous newsgroups to my users (a.b.p.e).  
However, I would like to be able to have people under age eighteen on my system.
Does anyone know a method whereby I could prevent children from receving these
newsgroups (besides not letting them on my system)?  I was trying to work
out a way using Unix groups, but this is more of a C-news type problem.

1.  It's my experience that many "bugs" aren't bugs and stem from
    users not understanding the correct behavior and what they
    need to do to get it (ie, boards jumpered right, etc).  You
    need to screen bugs for false reports.

2.  SLS is not Linux.  As a collection of the linux kernel and various
    linux programs, it often lags begined the current state-of-the-art,
    and many bugs will be fixed in newer versions of things that aren't
    yet integrated with SLS.  So, some of the bug reports here are going
    to be useless.

3.  The development versions of various pieces of code (ie, many
    of the Linux SCSI drivers, the networking code, XFree86, etc)
    usualyl fix many current bugs (and introduce others) but are 
    only available to a limited subset of the Linux users.  So,
    bug reports on publically available versions of the code may be
    of limited usefulness.

4.  I often get "bug reports" from users who fail to specify their
    configuration, what version they're using, and other important
    details.  In cases like this, it is impossible to track down the
    bug.  

    To prevent these problems, you should use a bug report form (use the 
    MIT Xconsortium bug report form as an example) that gives enough 
    information to track the bug down.  It's also very hard to tell what's
    relevant, so some of the information will be extraneous.
    
Along similar lines, this is what I said (after a list of know bugs that have
been fixed in newer versions) in the SCSI FAQ : 

QUESTION: What do I do if I find a bug that still looks like a
bug after I've read the FAQ?

ANSWER: Your best bet is to send it to the SCSI channel of the mailing list,
where it will be seen by all of the people who've contributed to the
SCSI drivers.

In your bug report, please provide as much information as possible
regarding your hardware configuration, and all of the messages that
Linux prints when it boots.  If possible, try to isolate the bug to
a specific function or line of code. Your chances of getting the bug
fixed increase exponentially with the amount of information provided.

The bottom line is that if we can't reproduce your bug, and you can't
point at us what's broken, it won't get fixed.


5.  Finally, many Linux bugs aren't Linux bugs, but GCC bugs, Xfree bugs,
    bugs in things that run under Linux but aren't necessarily Linux.  Many 
    of these packages have their own bug alias that should be mailed, as is
    the case with X, GCC, etc.  

    You should probably post these bugs on a Linux community group
    incase it's something Linux specific (ie, in the 'C' library
    or kernel, or something that's POSIX rather than the BSD way
    the code expected), but they should also end up with the developers
    who are familiar with the package.

It's definately a good idea, but the implementation needs some work. 

A clearing house for bug reports would be extremely useful for the developers
and users.  It could weed out non-bugs, and insure that all bug reports had 
enough information to reproduce the bugs.  It could then mail the bugs out to
the appropriate people, and could maintain a public list as well.  Developers 
would have concise bug reports with a high-signal-to-noise ratio, making 
problems easier to fix.  Users would have a better chance of getting their 
bugs fixed, and would know about what bugs to expect.

It all depends on what your users are trying to do.  Debugging programs
like GCC and the X server, which can often eat 4M of memory, would be
impossible with a low limit like that.  I'd be inclined to pick a worst 
case scneario with your users usage, make that the hard limit, and put 
a lower soft limit for the normal case, 0 for users not doing development,
in the system wide startupfiles.

>data seg size      unlimited     # I know what a data seg is but what's normal?

Again, it depends on the users.  I've seen older versions of GCC chomp
32M of memory when grinding on initialized arrays, and I heard of one 
instance where a user was buying a > gigabyte drive for swap because 
they're application used over a gigabyte of memory.  

BSD has a default hard limit of 16M, soft limit of 8M.  I've only seen 
problems with the soft limit when running GCC.

>max file size      unlimited     #

>stack size         unlimited     #

A limited stack size will prevent runaway recursion, BSD has a default soft
limit 512K and hard limit of 16M.  I haven't seen any problems with it.

>cpu time           unlimited     #
>pipe size          7             # I have no clue what this one is

The buffer size used for pipes, expressed in 512 byte blocks.  Linux
sets up a 4095 byte buffer for each pipe, which rounds down to 7 512 
byte blocks.

This is not adjustable.

>open files         32            # This one seems ok

Inodes are dynamically allocated, so it isn't as much of a problem
under Linux as it is with other systems that have a fixed size inode 
table.

>  The users will be mostly reading news and mail, I don't expect heavy
>compilations, etc.

See above.  I ran a lab of mostly BSD machines with the hard/soft limits
outlined above, and my users didn't have any problems.
