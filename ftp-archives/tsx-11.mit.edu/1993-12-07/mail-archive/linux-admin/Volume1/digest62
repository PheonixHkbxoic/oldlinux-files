Greetings!

A friend of mine (Dennis Williams) will soon be taking a position
teaching at a small liberal arts college in Oklahoma.  Currently 
the school has no Internet access and minimal computing services.
Dennis would like to change that.

We have been investigating options on our own.  I installed Linux
on my machine at home to see if it was useable, and it appears
that he should be able to use it as the focal point for computing
services at this school.  I have been following the Linux groups
for a while and been assimilating what I can.

We have considered several options, and wanted to get some opinions
from those of you who are administering Linux machines. 

All comments and suggestions are welcome.

Our initial idea:

1) Establish a single powerful Linux machine as the gateway for the
campus.  The machine would have 32Meg of RAM and could hopefully
support 10-15 simultaneous users. (almost exclusively mail/news use.
Initial disk requirements are estimated to be at least 1G.

   Macs and PCs on campus would be connected to this machine via
ethernet. (apparently the campus is wired for this, but it is not
currently being used.)

The Linux box would be connected to the nearest big University (OU)
via high speed modem.  I suppose this means that mail/News would
be UUCP type services.

2) As demand for computing services increase (and they will :) )
addition Linux boxes will be added to provide more disk space
and processing capability.  A direct Internet feed will have to
be added when the modem bandwidth is insufficient.

Is this reasonable/workable?  What kind of time commitment is
required to administer such a setup?  How many users can it
reasonably support?  As a history PhD, with moderate computing
skills, is Dennis crazy to try and do this?

thanks for your assistance in this matter,

Hello!
        I am currently running 99.9 and just got everything needed to upgrade
to 99.10 with NET-2 so as to connect with SLIP. 
        I have a small TCP/IP network running right now with 3 machines 
running NE2000 cards and all is GREAT!
        I have read the faqs but there is no information on _configuring_
the new kernel and net-2 for slip AND ethernet to work together.
        Does anyone have ANY information and/or tips on this before I
blow myself up =;-)

                                                Thanx very much

Ditto here. I assumed it was because I am using
hacked shell scripts for use with PGP inside elm
that caused the problem, but apparently not. Either way,
bash-1.13 does not work correctly with elm at this time,
leaving a message with all the correct headers, but with an
empty message body (it looks like the text is being dumped

Bash 1.12 works correctly and I have re-installed it.

Ditto. The problem seems to be that /bin/sh is dumping the
text of the mail message somewhere and elm doesn't bother checking
to see what has happened, and the message gets send out with a blank
body. This occurs with bash-1.13's sh used as /bin/sh.

Bash-1.12 (as either /bin/bash or /bin/sh does not show
this problem, and replacing 1.13 beta with 1.12 fixes the problem.

        Slackware supports a 5.25" install now.  I used it and the 
        install went smoothly.  The 5.25" boot & root disks were in
        the test/ directory under linux/slackware/.  I'm not sure of
        the exact path right now.  Go in and look around at ftp.cdrom.com.

I had this problem too in the beginning of using bash 1.13 beta. It turned
out to be a bug in Elm 2.4. The fact that this bug does not show up when
using bash 1.12 is a bug in bash 1.12 :-). It has been fixed in the latest
release 2.4.21 (and maybe even earlier).

3.5" floppies also tend to be much more flaky than 5.25" floppies, at
least in my experience.  Among high-density floppies, I've never had a
5.25" disk go bad.  I've had several 3.5" disks go bad on me (bad
enough that they can't be reformatted to full capacity).

He said that the problem was that Slackware required a 3.5" (BOOT) disk.
Not that he didn't have a 3.5" floppy.  The '386 standard is still the
a: drive as 5.25" in general.

The issue is which one is the a: drive that you boot off of.

You'll also find that on a per-MB basis, 5.25" is far (!!!) cheaper to buy
than 3.5".

It seems the pkgtool is the proper command. It prompts you for the series
or package to install. You can work from the hard disk or floppy.

BTW this tool is supposed to remove packages. Not that I think about it
you may need to run it from the root directory considering that all the
paths are root relative.

Hope this helps,

I was wondering, having recently set up a fairly complete Linux system
from a variety of different sources (names witheld to prevent flames)
if there was any idea of what file ownerships should be on what files
and what permissions by the same token.  Many of the archives I
install seem to cough on ownerships and permissions and I end up with
nasty things like X directories being owned by root with read/write
permission to root only!

Basically I'm looking for a trimmed ls -lR of a 'correct'

problems with binaries, shellscripts and config files.

Is slackware yet available in smaller files? When I first heard
of it, it was a 30-odd meg tar file which was impossible for me
to retrieve, and I thought "how stupid."

SLS's multiple-files-per-multiple-directories is not real easy to ftp
but tools like ftptool make that easier.

Of course, I don't advocate *any* distributions beyond the initial
install.

Yes it's now broken up into disk size directories (1.44 Meg). Series and sizes
in disks:

A: 13 base
X: 11 X windows
E: 5  Emacs
Y: 1 Games
Q: 1 Experimental

Note that TeX is not included. The SLS T series can be used.

Actually in standard FTP you can make the directory structure locally and
then mget *. It automatically pulls down all subdirectories that were
previously created.

I disagree. I had major problems trying to upgrade from SLS 1.01 to
kernel PL12, GCC 2.4.5, X 1.3, Net-2, and Lib 4.4.2. It took all of
30 minutes of setup (saving non distribution stuff, putting my machine on
the net, fdisk, and finally setup with no prompts). Slackware loaded all
be itself and everything works fine now.
