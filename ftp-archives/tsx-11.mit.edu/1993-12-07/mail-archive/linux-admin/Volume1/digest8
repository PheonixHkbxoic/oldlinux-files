Well actually, there's a difference between extracting a specific file from
a tar archive and extracting a specific tar archive from a tape.  What you
describe above will extract path[1-3] from the next archive on the tape, but
what I think was intended by the previous poster (David?) was that you
may want to extract the next tar archive from the tape.  You would do this
by executing a 'mt -f /dev/nrmt0 fsf 1' or similar syntax for 'fast-forward
file'.  This is the HP syntax BTW - I'm not sure of the exact syntax under
linux.

Not so.  I took my 386-40, pulled down an 800-or-so student passwd file,
and overnight it found about 50 passwords.  Kinda disgusting.  You might,
however, do better with a passwd program that requires decent passwords...

>passwords and do a brute force guessing of passwords through this. If
Stupid passwords are far easier to check for than random passwords.  If you
just fake tftp or something to get /etc/passwd, having a j random luser
account is a step up.

Date: Wed, 18 Aug 1993 20:44:13 GMT

My syslogd is working fine for messages from the local linux host, but I
would like to log entries from some other hosts on my net.  I am
experimenting with a telebit netblazer which will log to my DEC box with
no trouble, but when I direct the output to the linux box I get nothing!
Syslog -d reports nothing coming from the netblazer as well.

Is anyone else useing syslogd to log from other hosts?

I'm not on a network, so my setup should be simple.  Under 0.99.8, I
had everything set up so I could telnet, rlogin, etc. to myself.  Now,
with 0.99.12, everything's broke.  YES, I have everything in /etc, not
/etc/inet.  Even "talk" doesn't work anymore.  

The error message I get is:

        Host name lookup failure.

I tried telnetting to localhost, and still got that error.

What did I miss?

Thanks.

Subject: Getting X working...
Date: Thu, 19 Aug 1993 01:16:50 GMT

Hello:
        I've just installed Linux using the SLS package.  I've scanned
the FAQ, read various man pages etc., but am still pretty clueless as
to how I get X to work. The script Install does not run as it requires
the source to be present.  Is there a script somewhere in this package
that (semi-)automates the setup? Is there one available elsewhere? Is
there a good doc somewhere I haven't found?

My Hardware consists of:

        486-33 ISA bus, 12 MB Ram, 256K ext cache
        200 MB Seagate IDE drive
        1.44 & 1.2 floppies (w/ Irwin A120 tape drv attached)
        SoundBlaster Pro w/CDROM  (btw, any drivers for this coming?)
        ATI Graphics Ultra Pro, 2Meg, VGA setup as "shared"
        3 button mouse on ATI card

I currently have Linux on a 95 MB partition, with OS/2 on the rest (FAT),
so I don't think I have room to recompile the X sources.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks, Jay

Anyone having any luck with SLS v1.03 and OS/2's bootmanager?  I see that
Slackware addresses this issue, but don't remember seeing anything said 
about using SLS with bootmanager.

I do fine setting up SLS to my second hard disk and booting from floppy
(I can't put Linux on the first HD and LILO can't boot 2nd disk) but
was wondering if anyone could give me anything to go on for setting up
bootmanager to boot /dev/sdb1?

Mosty with all versions of X its important that when you do get things

I have upgraded through the various versions of X but every time i have
used my OLD copy of the Xconfig. and every time i have had a working

The secret of getting X to work is to find an Xconfig for your VGA card

I use vixie-cron, but since it appeared in Linux, it can be found on my
machine as the standard /etc/cron.

Is there any reason to name it /usr/bin/crond under LINUX now... ?

Shadow offers better security against hackers.  Not alot better, but some.

If you setup your /etc/default/useradd file correctly, the useradd program
will behave alot better.  You can specify default home directory tree,
expiration, group accoutability, etc..

If you feel up to it, you can still add new users via the /etc/passwd,
just edit /etc/shadow with some information that looks some previous
information in the file, then just passwd user and change the passwd to
match.

I have been working on setting up a small network of linux machines for my

SPARC station, and I suggested using the Linux machines X capability to 
expand the amount of people capable of working on the SPARC.  Well any how, 
I have all the Linux hosts trusting each other and I am capable of using xon
(when specifing a full path?) but I cannot rsh to the SPARC and hence cannot
xon to the SPARC.  Has anyone succefully accomplished this?

The obvious way is via NIS, which isn't available (at least not in a very
useful way yet) otherwise.
Do the following
do mkdir /passwords on all machines
mv /etc/passwd /passwords on one machine
ln -fs /passwords/passwd /etc/passwd on all machines
put /passwords in /etc/exports on the machine which actually has
the password file and add this machine/directory to /etc/fstab on
all the other machines.

One point do the NFS mounts as read/only, that needs you have to log into
a specific machine to change passwords, but it avoids the risk of corrupting
the password file.
