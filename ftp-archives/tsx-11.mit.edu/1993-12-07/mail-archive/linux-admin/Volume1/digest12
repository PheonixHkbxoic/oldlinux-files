    Several things. To make effective use of fstab, you need to get the
utile* package and compile the mount from there. The other utilities are
also handy. The mount that comes with SLS seems to be an older one that
doesn't have the utility of the new one. Then fstab allows some handy
options. I quote from Steven Tweedie on this.

============================================================================
    Each fstab line has the fields:

    device        directory       type    options         freq pass
        
    and the options field recognises the noauto option.  This option
    merely prevents 'mount -a' from mounting that filesystem.  So,
    in my /etc/fstab I have two lines:

    /dev/hda1       /dos            msdos   noauto,gid=51,umask=002,conv=auto
    /dev/fd0        /mnt            msdos   noauto,gid=51,umask=002,conv=auto
    
    ... which means that although I don't normally have my HD dos
    partition mounted, I can mount it any time I want just by doing a
    "mount /dos".  Similarly I can mount and unmount dos floppies with
    "[u]mount /mnt".   (The other options just set up the group ownership
    of the dos files to a group "dos" which on my setup has gid 51, and
    sets up permissions so that the dos files are world-readable but only
    writeable by the dos group.  Finally, conv=auto specifies that the
    dosfs should automatically decide which files to do dos-to-unix text
    conversion on.)
     
=========================================================================
    Strangely, the man page that comes with the utile* package makes no
mention of most of the options mentioned here, but I have verified that
at least the noauto option does indeed exist and work. Astute readers
will notice that this allows another method of setting user permissions
on mounted directories. 

    On allocating space on multiple partitions. The method I use, which
seems to be fairly common, is to use symbolic links to hang directories
off the main directory tree. In your case, rather than changing man
path, if you mounted the new partition on /f, then moved man/ there,
then you would ln -s /f/man /usr/man. Doing a ls -l of /usr should then
show man -> /f/man. This allows you to have several directories in the
new /f filesytem attached to common directories under /.
    Unfortunately, the gnu du seems to have a problem with this. If you
du a directory with another directory linked inside, du wont count the
linked directory. If you use the -L flag to tell du to follow the link,
du will happily proclaim the normal directories to not exist. This makes
it difficult to find the total space taken up by a tree. This happens
even as root, so is not permission releated. I'm still waiting (Ian) to
hear if this is a du bug or a linux bug.

Previous posters seem to suggest that 8 letter password
can be cracked easily in reasonable time (even Apple-II
appears in the arena).  Can someone tell me what
I have missed here?  I thought dictionary check is
the only way to crack password, which obviously
can be dealt with with a 'good' password.

Subject: fsck and disk care questions...
From: hjstein@sunrise.huji.ac.il (Harvey J. Stein)
Date: 22 Aug 93 15:43:38


Hi -

I have some questions about fsck and proper disk care.  I currently
have the following setup (reported by fdisk):

Disk /dev/hda: 12 heads, 55 sectors, 1010 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 660 * 512 bytes

   Device Boot  Begin   Start     End  Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hda1   *       1       1     249   82142+   6  DOS 16-bit >=32M
/dev/hda2         250     250     950  231330   83  Linux extfs
/dev/hda3         951     951    1010   19800   82  Linux swap

I know that I should be running e2fsck from within /etc/rc, but I've
also read that I shouldn't run the program on a mounted partition.
Since the boot procedure mounts the root partition (/dev/hda2) at
boot-time, how can I do this?!?!?  Or is it ok to run e2fsck from
within /etc/rc even though the root partition has already been
mounted?  Is it better to have at least 2 Linux partitions, a minimal
one with the root partition and with /usr/bin /etc, ... (whatever's
needed for booting) and the other with everything else?  If I do this,
how do I set it up cleanly?  Lots of symbolic links?  And if I do
this, I'll have used up all my primary partitions.  Can I set up new
partitions as extended partitions?  Are there any complications or
limitations to doing this?  Does it go the same way as with a primary
partition?  What's considered to be the best or the standard
partitioning and directory allocation scheme?

Also, I heard in the past that e2fsck doesn't work too well, and that
it should always be run interactively, never automatically.  Is this
still the case?  If not, when did this change?  I'm running e2fsck
from SLS v1.02, and I'm running kernel v .99 pl10 with NET-2.  Should
I get a new e2fsck, and if so, where should I get it from?

Well, that's about it.  Lots of questions and few answers...  I'll try
looking things up in some standard un*x references, but I don't think
I'll find anything about extended partitions and e2fsck :).

Thanks.

What the poster said was that all 8 character passwords could be generated
quickly by an Apple II. All possible passwords are not in the dictionary.
You still need to encrypt the generated passwords and compare against the
passwords in the password files.

That's why shadow is important. If only the root can read the passwords then
you must become root to get the password file. /etc/passwd must be world
readable for the other info in it. Shadow moves the passwords out of /etc/passwd
making it much more difficult to crack because now the cracker doesn't have
the passwords to compare against.

An Apple II is not the ultimate password cracking machine ;-)

Subject: ATI GU +, mouse is hiding
Date: Sun, 22 Aug 1993 16:41:39 GMT

Hello. I have *almost* got X running, but have to overcome one final
snag. When I run startx (or openwin), I get the opening screen, if I
click the left button, it places the xclock then another click places
the bash window. As soon as I move the mouse however, the pointer
hides down in the lower right corner of my screen, and won't come out.
Pressing the left button shows the pop-up menu. The mouse just will
not move. I would be greatly interested i hearing from anyone who has
X working with their Graphics Ultra + using the ATI mouse. Mine is setup
on the primary address, IRQ 5. I've checked and doublechecked and  found
no IRQ conflicts. I've tried setting different scan rates in Xconfig,
and I've also tried different baud rates, though I don't think they
really appertain to a bus mouse.  BTW, /dev/mouse is symbolic linked to
the logitech bus device. It's the only one that seems to work, and during
bootup it says it detects a logitech bus mouse.  I'll be happy to mail
Xconfig to anyone who can help.

Thanks a bunch,
Jay

The Linux HOWTO Index 
Matt Welsh, <mdw@tc.cornell.edu>
=============================================================================
Last Modified 20 August 1993

This is an introduction and index to the Linux HOWTO documents. 

0. What are Linux HOWTOs?

        Linux HOWTOs are short online documents which describe in detail
        a certain aspect of configuring or using the Linux system. For 
        example, there is the Installation HOWTO, which gives instructions
        on installing Linux, and the Mail HOWTO, which describes how to
        set up and configure mail under Linux. Other examples include the
        NET-2-HOWTO (previously the NET-2-FAQ) and the Linux-vs-386BSD HOWTO.

        Information in HOWTOs is generally more detailed and in-depth than
        what can be squeezed into the Linux FAQ. For this reason, the
        Linux FAQ is being rewritten. A large amount of the information
        contained therein will be relegated to various HOWTO documents.
        The FAQ will be a shorter list of frequently asked questions about 
        Linux, covering small specific topics. Most of the ``useful'' 
        information in the FAQ will now be covered in the HOWTOs. 

        HOWTOs are comprehensive docs---much like an FAQ but generally not
        in question-and-answer format. However, many HOWTOs contain an FAQ
        section at the end. For example, the NET-2-FAQ has been renamed to
        the NET-2-HOWTO, because it wasn't in question-and-answer format. 
        However, you will see the NET-2-HOWTO named as the NET-2-FAQ in many
        places. The two docs are one and the same.


1. Where to get Linux HOWTOs

        HOWTOs can be retrieved via anonymous FTP from the following
        sites:

                sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO

                tsx-112.mit.edu:/pub/linux/docs/HOWTO

        The Index, printed below, lists the currently available HOWTOs.

        HOWTOs are also posted regularly to the newsgroups comp.os.linux
        and comp.os.linux.announce. In addition, a number of the HOWTOs
        will be crossposted to news.answers. Therefore, you can find the
        Linux HOWTOs on the news.answers archive site rtfm.mit.edu.


2. HOWTO Index
        
        The following Linux HOWTOs are currently available. The list
        is small, because this is a relatively new project. 

        * INSTALLATION HOWTO. How to obtain and install Linux. This is the
          first document which a Linux newcomer should read. It discusses
          how to obtain Linux, both from the Internet and via Snail-mail,
          and how to install it. Focuses primarily on the SLS distribution
          of Linux, which is the current de facto standard.

        * Linux INFO-SHEET. A general technical introduction to Linux,
          listing its features, supported hardware, and other general
          information. 

        * Linux META-FAQ. A list of sources of information about Linux,
          such as documentation, newsgroups, FTP sites, and so on.

        * NET-2 HOWTO. Describes how to install and configure the Linux NET-2 
          TCP/IP code, in kernels 0.99.pl10 and above. (This has nothing 
          to do with the so-called BSD NET-2 distribution.) Discusses various
          aspects of TCP/IP networking under Linux, including the use of SLIP.
          The complete instruction manual for TCP/IP under Linux.

        
        WANTED. I would be very happy if someone would write the following 
        HOWTO documents, and submit them to me (see the instructions in
        the next section below). Most of these are modifications of existing
        FAQ documents, and should be easy to put into HOWTO format. Keep in
        mind that HOWTOs generally aren't in FAQ format, but can contain an
        FAQ section at the end.

        Some of these are under construction; however, if you're interested
        in working on one of them, please let me know.

        * GCC/LIBRARY HOWTO. Discussing installation/upgrading of the GCC 
          and shared libraries under Linux. How to build shared libraries.
          Most of the material would come from Mitchum DeSouza's GCC FAQ. 

        * NEWS HOWTO. How to set up local Cnews, NNTP, and how to set up an
          NNTP-based newsreader if you don't want to run a news server 
          locally. Most of this can come from Vince's UUCP/MAIL/NEWS FAQ.

        * MAIL HOWTO. How to setup and configure smail, and how to install
          a mailer such as elm or mailx. Information can come from the
          UUCP/MAIL/NEWS FAQ.

        * UUCP HOWTO. How to setup and configure UUCP under Linux, for mail,
          news, and uux file transfers. Some information can come from the
          UUCP/MAIL/NEWS FAQ.

        * KERNEL HOWTO. How to upgrade and compile the kernel. Basic kernel
          tweaking, including how to turn on debugging output. How to decrypt
          panic messages. Basic introduction to kernel structure and hacking.
          (Under constructions, mdw@tc.cornell.edu).

        * PRINTING HOWTO. How to install and use printing software such as
          lp/lpr on your system. How to configure /etc/printcap for
          various types of printers. Information can come from existing
          Printer and LPR FAQs. (Whoever writes the printing FAQ, please
          get in touch with me about this.)

        * SCSI HOWTO. All of the ins and outs about SCSI drivers for Linux. 

        * SERIAL HOWTO. All of the ins and outs about serial communications
          under Linux, including use of getty for dialins. Perhaps a section
          on FAX software.

        * X WINDOWS HOWTO. How to install and configure XFree86 under Linux.
          Much of this is general, not Linux-specific, but the current
          XFree86 documentation consists mostly READMEs which most new users 
          don't understand. What hardware is supported, tweaking the Xconfig
          file, getting xdm to work, and so on. (Under construction, 
          mdw@tc.cornell.edu).


3. Writing and submitting a HOWTO

        If you would like to write a Linux HOWTO document, there are a few
        guidelines that you should follow. 

        * Format the document neatly. HOWTOs must be available in plain 
          ASCII format, but you are free to use a formatting tool (texinfo,
          LameTeX, nroff) to format the document. Try to use meaningful
          structure and organization, and write clearly. Remember that
          many of the people reading HOWTOs do not speak English as their
          first language.

        * Make sure that all of the information is correct. I can't stress
          this enough. When in doubt, speculate, but make it clear that
          you're only guessing. 

        * Make sure that you are covering the most recent version of the
          available software. Also, be sure to include full instructions
          on where software can be downloaded from (FTP site name, full
          pathname). 

        * Include an FAQ section at the end, if appropriate. Many HOWTO
          documents need an "FAQ" or "Common Problems" section to cover
          information which can't be covered in the regular text.

        * Use other HOWTOs as a model. It is nice to have a common look and
          feel to HOWTO documents--- this document being an example. The
          easier the HOWTO is to browse, the more useful it will be to
          readers.


        After you have written the HOWTO, mail it to me (Matt Welsh) at
        mdw@tc.cornell.edu. I am the HOWTO coordinator---I will look 
        over the HOWTO, and make any editorial remarks. I will also take
        care of approving and posting the HOWTO to the various newsgroups
        and uploading the HOWTO to the FTP archive sites. Of course,
        all credit for the HOWTO will go to the author.

        It is important that you go through me when submitting a HOWTO. I
        maintain the HOWTO archives and need to keep track of what HOWTOs
        are being written and who is doing what. If you don't submit a
        HOWTO to me, I can't include it in the archive or add it to the
        HOWTO INDEX. 

        I can also help to reformat the HOWTO if needed to make it look
        nicer. :) Once I have approved the HOWTO, I will post it and
        upload it to the FTP sites. I will also send you (the author) 
        the "final" version of the HOWTO with any changes. All you have
        to do is send me periodic updates (every month or so, as needed)
        and I will take care of posting the HOWTO regularly. 


3. Miscellaneous and Legalese

        If you have questions, please feel free to mail mdw@tc.cornell.edu.
        The Linux FAQ rewrite is being coordinated by Ian Jackson,
