ANNOUNCING the Generic A1 0.50 (still ALPHA)

   This is my own emergency disk/installation disk.  I've
   just uploaded this version to sunsite.unc.edu and tsx-11.mit.edu.
   Since this is still an ALPHA release please e-mail me directly with
   any problems you have, and I will try to fix them for the next release.

WELCOME to the Generic A1 instructions.  Why Generic A1?

  - To install from MSDOS devices that haven't been configured
    for Linux yet...

  - To be able to create your own lilo boot disk, for those who
    have problem with standard distribution boot disks.

  - For one of the most complete emergency boot disks that will
    work with 5.25 or 3.5 inch drives.

  - For installing with a custom made kernel prepared by someone else.

  - For a set of manual pages to help you solve unusual installation
    problems

  - Use csh for your shell during installation, so new uses don't
    have to learn bash until after they install Linux.

What Generic.A1 won't do:
  - Install from a network.
 
  - Provide an easy menu system for installation.

  - Install without an MSDOS partition

  - Act as a reliable source for current binaries.  In cases where the
    new binaries are larger I'm still using the old.  Many programs
    are simply replaced with either an alias or a script.

                             Bill
