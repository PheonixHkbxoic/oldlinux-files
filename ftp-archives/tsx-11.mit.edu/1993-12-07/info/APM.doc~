Ted & Kim -

Based on our standard UROP raise algorithm (which is based on time with 
DCNS & class year) here are the rates I recommend for your UROPers for 
fall93 (assuming any of them continue UROPs in the fall).  If you have 
any questions just let me know.  If you approve these rates please let 
Jane know, or send her the rates you would prefer for your students.

Anne - please let me know if you have any questions re: Gladys's rate.

name        fall93 rate/hour

J.Weiss         $10.75
M.Braun         $10.75

T.Yu            $10.10
H.Tsai          $10.00

G.Leung         $10.00

Hi Mark,

Thanks for the info. If they can/do stick around those numbers look 
fine.

As far as Matt goes, I don't think he can be a urop because he graduated. 
I believe Jonathon will be working for Tim as a full time staff member.

Here's an interesting question though: do we need to make sure
salaries are somewhat consistent across IS? For example, I know
that Matt also works for CSS and I don't think he makes nearly
as much as he does in DCNS. Is this something we should be
paying attention to?

Assuming that Matt and Jonathon are moving on to bigger and better
things, I'd like to hire a UROP around IAP.

	-Kim

Subject: console and keyboard stuff


We are studying the Linux console and keyboard related files
but are kind of lost in it.  We wonder if you could point us
to related information to understand the code.  A high level
explanation would also help too.  For example:  what are these
variables supposed to do:
	in console.c
		sel_cons, sel_start, sel_end
		console_blanked
		translations[]
		G0_charset
	in keyboard.c 
		kbd_dead_keys
		key_handler

We can pick up PC related information, but we don't know enough
of the design of keyboard and console handlers to see the workings
of these highly related procedures.  I guess we need pointers to
	1. general description of the design and considerations
		of keyboard and console drivers
	2. Linux specific design description

Thanks for any pointers.

Non-undergrads can work for us, they just can't be UROPed.  This means that 
if we choose to hire them we have to pay overhead (39%) on their hours.  

Students in the new Course 6 5 year program do not usually receive their 
undergraduate degree until the end of year 5, therefor they can be UROPed 
all 5 years (at least that's what the UROP office said last year -- we'll 
find out this fall with Chris Cotton.)

I don't think that we need to make student salaries consistent across IS.  
I think that watchmakers have different responsibilities and require 
different skills (e.g. more development experience) than support positions 
in CSS & NSS.  (I don't know what NSS pays help desk students, or plans to 
pay resnet students, but I suspect it is less than we pay watchmakers).  
While we pay our student developers more than many on campus jobs, we also 
pay less than some local companies which also compete with us to hire 
student developers.

I think our student salary rates are about right.  Occasionally students do 
reject our job offer or don't continue working with us because they can 
make more elsewhere.  So I don't think we are paying much too much.

I would be interested in what other people think.  Do we pay too much, too 
little, give too many raises, too few, etc.?

Well, since no one else has sent out any information, I guess I should:

For services this Wednesday, we're going to

*** WALDEN POND! *** 

(Yeah, it's great and you can never get to much).
We'll be meeting at the chapel at 5:00 instead of
our normal 5:10, and carpool from there. The service
will be a simple prayer service, followed by a picnic
(bring some food for yourself and to share if you want).

Also, earlier this Wednesday, we'll be having a meeting
of the student planning board. Anyone is welcome to come
with suggestions, opinions, ideas, etc. We'll be meeting
at noon in the Chaplaincy (312 Memorial Drive), and then
decide on a place to go for lunch. (we'll talk and eat at,
well, not quite the same time, but in rapid succession (-; )
If you would like to come, but can't make it on time, we'll
leave a note saying where we went. (It wouldn't hurt to email
me about this either.)

Well, I hope this briefly summarizes what's going on and gives
you enough notice. Feel free to send me questions or even just 
to say hey.

Ted,

Can you guys provide a digest of comp.os.linux.announce
I guess it would be Linux-Announce or some such.  If so, would you add me
to the distribution for it.

Thanks.

Minutes of the Network Operations Group Meeting, 16-Aug-93

Present: Jeff, Ted, Tom, Chris, Ron, Kim

Announcements:

	Jeff has another meeting at 2pm, but so we're going make this quick.

	We got the production model of the Safekeeper box from RSA.

	Jeff is at Interop all next week.  

	Jeff is dealing with the Boston Heart Foundation.

Roundtable....

Chris:	[Any news on the repaeter?]  No good news.  The ship dates on
	the MXRI is August 27th and September 3rd.  [ We should push
	on this one, and possibly remind them about the upcoming 
	dormitory order.  :-]

Tom:	The repeater evaluation is proceeding.  We're looking at them now.
	We were really gung-ho of the Asante repeater, but it turns out
	their MAC tracking software doesn't really work.  Then there's
	the cabletron repeater, which stores multiple addresses per port.
	They make work better in our environment.

Chris:	We're should be getting an evaluation unit for the Telebit Netblazer. 
	[ Jeff would like to have something by the end of this quarter.]

Ted:	Is there a cost recovery model yet?  [ Jeff:  Not yet... ]

Jeff:	Next meeting will be in two weeks.  Tom, could you prepare a list
	of repeater vendor embarassing questions?

Next meeting Auguest 30th, 1:30pm.

	Hi,

	I have received a proposal from Mark Montague about the undelete
feature for the ext2 fs.  Mark is interested in working on it and he'd like
to get some feedback on his proposal from other developpers.  So I have
forwarded this mail to you.

	I have not read Mark's mail very carefully yet.  As soon as I read it
(this evening I think), I will send my comments to him with a copy for you.
On your side, if you have any comments, please send them to Mark with a copy
to me.

	Thanks,

		Remy

> 
> DESIGN GOALS:
> 
>   - should be able to undelete files without unmounting the filesystem
>   - undeletion should be selectable on a per-file basis
>   - undeletion should not require the user to learn extra programs
>     (I think we can do much better than MS-DOS style undeletion)
>   - make the system administrator's job as easy as possible
>   - don't create any security holes or make ext2fs less stable
>   - don't interfere with ext2fs compression, ACLs, or user quotas
> 
>   * undeletable deleted files and directories are treated the same as normal
>     files and directories, except that the space they use can be reclaimed by
>     the filesystem when needed.  The undeletable deleted files are stored in an
>     "undelete" directory which can be viewed by the user using "ls".  The user
>     can then undelete a file by "mv"ing it to its original location or by
>     keeping the deleted file in the "undelete" directory and making a copy of
>     it with "cp", "cat", "dd", or any other Unix utility.
> 
> 
> FILE ATTRIBUTES:
> 
>   Each file should have a set of "attribute" bits.  For example, this set
>   would contain one bit to indicate whether the file is automatically
>   compressed by ext2fs and another bit to indicate whether the file should
>   be undeletable.
> 
>   As far as I can tell, the i_flags field of the ext2_inode is currently not
>   used and could be used to hold the file's attribute bits.
> 
>   When a file is created, it inherits a copy of the attribute bits of its
>   parent directory.
> 
>   A new system call, sys_chattr( char *pathname, unsigned long attr ), would
>   be implemented to change the attributes of a file which already exists.  A
>   new program, chattr, would be written to change the attribute bits on a file
>   and would function in the same way as chmod from the GNU fileutils package.
> 
>   The stat system call would be modified to copy the attribute bits for a file
>   or directory from the inode to the new_stat structure.  The __unused5 field
>   would be changed to st_attr.  This means that ordinary programs, such as ls,
>   can determine what attribute bits are set for a file.
> 
>   ls (also from the GNU fileutils package) would be changed so that it will
>   display a file's attribute bits to the left of the file's permission bits
>   if the -e flag is set.
> 
>   mv and cp would be changed to handle the attribute bits correctly, if
>   necessary.

> 
> UNDELETE DIRECTORY TABLE INODE:
> 
>   The purpose of the undelete directory table inode is to allow each user to
>   have their own undelete directory for a partition wherever they want on that
>   partition.  This allows deleted files to be manipulated in the same manner
>   as normal files but without allowing users to see the names, sizes (and
>   possibly contents) of deleted files belonging to other users.
> 
>   A special inode (inode 6, for example) is set aside for the undelete
>   directory table (udt).  The udt will be accessed through a system call that
>   the VFS will dispatch to the ext2 filesystem as a "miscellaneous superblock 
>   operation".  ext2fs will then do one of several operations based on the
>   arguments (lookup, change, add, delete a udt entry).
> 
>   Several fields of this inode are used for special purposes:
> 	i_flags		--> system undelete directory inode #
> 	i_mode		--> minimum uid in table
> 	i_uid		--> maximum uid in table
> 	i_gid		--> default action: delete or move to system undeldir
> 
>   The blocks pointed to by the directory table inode contain an udt_entry for
>   each user, sorted in order of increasing uid:
> 	struct udt_entry {
> 	  unsigned short uid;
> 	  unsigned short reserved;  /* for future expansion: pass variable? */
> 	  unsigned long  inode;     /* points to user's undelete directory */
> 	  unsigned long  reserved2; /* for future expansion: undelete quota? */
>         };
>   A value of zero in the inode field means that all files for that user should
>   be deleted permanently instead of being saved for undeletion.
> 
>   Each block pointed to by the special undelete inode has the following
>   structure:
> 
> 	#define EXT2_UDT_ENTRIES(s) \
> 	  (( EXT2_BLOCKSIZE(s) - sizeof( struct udt_block_header )) /  \
> 	  sizeof( struct udt_entry ));
> 
> 	struct udt_block_header {
> 	  unsigned short   max_uid;   /* Highest uid stored in this block */
> 	  unsigned short   uid_count; /* Number of uids stored in this block */
> 	};
> 
> 	struct udt_block {
> 	  struct udt_block_header header;
> 	  struct udt_entry entry[1]; /* Size of array depends on blocksize */
> 	};
> 
>   In order to "delete" files or automatically purge "deleted" files (when more
>   space is needed), the kernel needs to look up users in the undelete directory
>   table.  However, this lookup should never be too bad.  First, only users who
>   can create and delete files on a filesystem should be in the filesystem's
>   udt; everyone else will use the system undelete directory for that
>   filesystem.  Second, for most systems a single block of entries in the udt
>   should be sufficient for everybody on the system:  with a blocksize of 1024,
>   there are 85 udt entries per block (341 entries per block if the blocksize is
>   4096).  (If it turns out systems need more than two blocks of udt entries,
>   I can add an index block to the implementation for those systems).  Within
>   a single block, a binary search is used to find an entry.
> 
>   The system administrator can configure the default treatment of deleted files
>   whose owner is not in the udt on a per-partition basis (see i_gid field
>   above). On the other hand, if the user IS in the udt but there is a problem
>   with the undelete directory inode# for that user (inode not in use, not a
>   directory, etc.), the system undelete directory will be used.
> 
>   A special program, udt, manages the directory table:
> 	udt -p [user...]		Print name of user's undelete directory
> 	udt -r user			Remove user from table
> 	udt -a user dir			Add or change a user in the table
> 	udt -c				Check table
>   The last form, "udt -c", check to be sure that the entries in the table are
>   sorted correctly, that the undelete directories exist and are actually
>   directories, etc..  In general, it performs all the checks that e2fsck
>   performs on the undelete directory table, but it also checks the
>   undelete directory table against /etc/passwd and issue warnings if there
>   are any users that listed in one file that are not in the other.  In general,
>   only root will be able to run udt, although normal users will be able to
>   do a "udt -p" on themselves.
> 
>   
> DELETING A FILE:
> 
>   namei.c:ext2_unlink() is the function we want to modify in order to support
>   undeletion.
> 
>   Before calling ext2_delete_entry(), lookup the undeletion directory for the
>   file's owner
> 
>   If the inode# of the undeletion directory is the same as the inode number of
>   the parent directory the file we want to delete, it means that the file has
>   already been deleted and we are being asked to make the deletion permanent so
>   go ahead and do the deletion the way we do it now.
> 
>   Otherwise, append ASCII inode# of the file to the file's name and call
>   ext2_rename() to move the "deleted" file to the user's undelete directory.
> 
> 
> RECLAIMING SPACE USED BY DELETED (BUT UNDELETABLE) FILES:
> 
>   To purge all deleted files that were deleted more than a week ago:
>     find UNDELETE_DIRECTORY -mindepth 1 -ctime +7 -exec rm \{\} \;
> 
>   balloc.c:ext2_new_block():~440 -- add code to try to free up some blocks by
>   deleting files in the user's undelete directory.
> 
>   ialloc.c:ext2_new_inode():~410 -- add code to try to get more inodes by

> DISADVANTAGES:
> 
>   - directory heirarchy is not preserved for deleted files: users must decide
>     in which directory they want to put an deleted file when they undelete it.
> 
>   - the undelete directory table makes the implementation more compilcated and
>     slower than other undelete implementations might.
> 
> 
> ADVANTAGES:
> 
>   - no special program is needed to undelete files
> 
>   - system administrator can set up the undelete director(y|ies) in many
>     different ways depending on security needs and personal prefferences
> 
> 
> NOTES:
> 
>   - Right now, I don't see enough reasons to use dtime.  ctime could be
>     modified when a file is deleted and then used to determine which deleted
>     file to purge when more space is needed.
> 
>   - could add "fair" round-robin method of freeing blocks from other user's
>     deleted files by adding a "pass" variable to the udt_entry.
> 
>   - could add "undelete quota" -- maximum # of blocks that a user could have
>     of deleted files.  When deleting an undeletable file, read inodes of
>     all files in undelete directory and sum the sizes.  If size of new
>     file to delete + sizes of old deleted files is greater than the undelete
>     quota (stored in the user's udt entry), start purging the deleted files
>     until the new one will fit.  If the new file is itself bigger than the
>     quota then it will be permanently deleted rather than saved for undeletion.
> 
> 
> Please let me know what you think.  If you approve, I'll go ahead and try to
> implement undeletion the way I've outlined it above.
> 
> Thank you for your consideration!

Subject: Standardizing/Extending the RMT (Remote MagTape) Protocol

There are protocol in the TCP/IP suite to do remote logins, to do
file transfers, email transfer, remote printing, time syncronization,
news transfer, and much more - but as far as I know there is no standard
protocol to do remote tape device access!

Yes, there exists the 4.3BSD "rmt" protocol program but it isn't standardized
anyway (except in the source code) and it also has the problem of requireing
a remote login on the machine that have the tape device just to start the
protocol engine. 

I've been working on a small program to allow me to connect to a well-known
TCP port and talk directly to the "rmt" protocol engine instead. This has
the added benefit of allowing non-UNIX systems to easily be able to provide
remote tape device access without ugly hacks in some sort of rshd/rexecd
server.

Of course the RMT protocol needs some extension to provide some kinds
of authentication of the remote users and things like that but it isn't
all that difficult to add. And there are a few other things in the RMT
protocol that needs to be fixed too.

I suppose ideally things like these should be discussed in some kind of
IETF working group or so. Anybody else but me that is interrested in
this issue? (How do one go about to create an IETF working group?
I've tried reading RFC's until my eyes started bleeding but...)

Attached below is my first attempt at an RMT protocol specification
which tries to follow the way the RMT protocol is implemented in the
4.3BSD "/etc/rmt" program.

(The "XXX" port number should be replaced with a well known TCP port
below 1024)

			Remote MT Protocol

		Peter Eriksson <pen@lysator.liu.se>

			   16 Aug 1993


Status of this Memo
   
   This document attempts to define a protocol for the Internet
   community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited. 


1. INTRODUCTION

   The Remote MT Protocol (a.k.a., "rmt", a.k.a., the "RMT Protocol")
   provides a means for users to access remote tape devices without
   requiring them to login on the remote machine.

   The protocol described in this document is the same as used by the
   "rmt" Unix program, with the addition of a well known port to which
   remote users can connect to get RMT service. Authentication of
   remote users is NOT handled by this protocol in this version.


2. OVERVIEW

   This is a connection based application on TCP. A server listens for
   TCP connections on TCP port XXX (decimal). Once a connection is
   established, the servers reads lines of data which specifies the
   commands for manipulation of the magnetic tapes, performs the
   commands and then responds with a status indication. All command
   and reply codes are in ASCII.


3. NOTATIONAL CONVENTIONS

   In the protocol description that follows below the following
   notational conventions are used:

   	<....>		Denotes a field of information.

   	[....]		Denotes that what is contained within the
   			brackets is optional and may or may not be
   			present.

   	\n		Denotes an ASCII LineFeed (LF, code 10 (decimal))
   			character.


4. BASIC QUERY/RESPONSE FORMAT
   
   The server accepts simple one-letter ASCII commands (with
   optional arguments) of the form:

   	<command-letter>[<opt-arg1>\n[<opt-arg2>\n][<opt-data]]

   where <opt-arg1> and <opt-arg2> are ASCII decimal number, and
   <opt-data> is a sequence of bytes. If an unknown <command-letter>
   is received the server will drop the connection without returning
   an error reply. Some examples:

   	O/dev/rmt8\n0\n
   	L100\n1\n
   	R5\n

   All responses are in ASCII and in one of two forms. Successful
   commands have responses of:

   	A<retval>\n[<opt-data>]

   where <retval> is the ASCII representation of a decimal number,
   and [<opt-data>] may or may not be present, depending on the
   command this is a reply to. For example:

   	A5\nHELLO
   	A3\n
   
   Unsuccessful commands are responded to with:

   	E<error-number>\n<error-message>\n

   where <error-number> is a system dependant error number, 
   and <error-message> is a corresponding ASCII error message
   string. For example:

   	E2\nNo such file or directory\n
   	E6\nNo such device or address\n


   The protocol consists of the following commands:

   	O<pathname>\n<mode>\n
   			Open the specified <pathname>. The <mode>
   			is an ASCII decimal value specifying the 
			mode for opening it. It can be one of:

   				0	Read-Only
   				1	Write-Only
   				2	Read-and-Write

   
   	C<pathname>\n
   			Close the currently open device. The
   			<pathname> argument is required, but
   			currently ignored. Client implementations
			should use the same pathname as they
   			used in the "O" command.
   	

   	L<offset>\n<whence>\n
   			Perform a seek on the currently open
   			device, if the device supports random
   			access. The <offset> argument is a
   			ASCII decimal number, whose meaning depends
   			on the <whence> argument. <whence> can be
   			one of the following:

   				0	Seek <offset> bytes from
   				    	the beginning of the file open
   				    	on the device.

   				1 	Seek <offset> bytes relative
   				    	the current position.

   				2	Seek <offset> bytes relative
   				    	the end of the current file
   				    	open.

   			On a successful operation, the <retval> returned
   			is the new position.

   
   	W<count>\n<data>
   			Write <count> bytes to the currently open
   			device. The bytes of <data> to be written
   			are sent immediately after the newline (\n)
   			of this command. On a successful write,
   			the <retval> returned is the actual number
   			of bytes written.


   	R<count>\n
   			Read up to <count> bytes of data from the
   			currently open device. If the read is successful,
   			the <retval> is the number of bytes read and
   			[<opt-data>] is the actual data read.


  	I<operation>\n<count>\n
   			Perform a device control operation on the
   			currently open device. <operation> can be
   			one of:

   				0	Write <count> EOF marks.

   				1	Forward space over <count>
   					EOF marks.

   				2	Space backwards over <count>
   					EOF marks.

   				3	Forward space over <count>
   					records.

   				4	Space backwards over <count>
   					records.

   				5	Rewind. <count> is ignored.

   				6	Rewind and place device offline.
   					<count> is ignored.

   
   	S\n		Return the status of the currently open device
			On a successful operation, <retval> will contain
   			the size of the system dependant binary structure
   			returned in [<opt-data>].


5. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

   This protocol contains no provisions what so ever with regard to
   authenticating users using it. Currently all authentication will
   have to be done outside this protocol.

	Advanced Power Management

1. Introduction

This document presents a layered approach to Power Management which is
termed Advanced Power Management(APM).  APM is a specification that
defines a layered cooperative environment which allows applications,
operating systems, and the system BIOS to work together towards the goal
of reducing power consumption in Personal Computers. The primary purpose
of an APM implementation is to provide portable computer users increased
productivity and greater system availability by extending the useful
life of system batteries without degrading performance.  The goal of
prolonging battery life for portable computers does not preclude the
usefulness of APM in other environments and applications.

This document describes APM using a model that partitions power
management functionality into a hierarchy of cooperating layers, and
standardizes the flow of information and control across the layers.

Microsoft and Intel would like to acknowledge Phoenix Technologies, Ltd.
for their contribution to the specification.

2. The Advanced Power Management System Model

2.1. Power States

APM defines four power states: Ready, Stand-by, Suspended, and Off.
Three of these states apply both to individual system components and to
the system as a whole.  The suspended state is a special low power
condition that applies to the system as a whole, and not the individual
components.

2.1.1. Ready

In the ready state, the system or device is fully powered up and ready
for use.  The APM definition of Ready only indicates that the system or
device is fully powered on, it does not differentiate between active and
idle conditions.

2.1.2. Stand-by

Stand-by is an intermediate system dependent state which attempts to
conserve power. Stand-by is entered when the CPU is idle and no device
activity is known to have occurred within a machine defined period of
time. The machine will not return to ready until one of the following
events occur:

	A device raises a hardware interrupt
	Any controlled device is accessed

All data and operational parameters are preserved when the machine is in
the Stand-by state.

2.1.3. Suspended

The Suspended state is a system state which is defined to be the lowest
level of power consumption available that preserves operational data and
parameters.  The suspend state can be initiated by either the system
BIOS or the software above the BIOS. The system BIOS may place the
system into the suspended state without notification if it detects a
situation which requires an immediate response such as the battery
entering a critically low power state. When the system is in the
Suspended state, computation will not be performed until normal activity
is resumed.  Resumption of activity will not occur until signaled by an
external event such as a button press, timer alarm, etc..

2.1.4. Off

When in the Off state, the system or device is powered down and
inactive.  Data and operational parameters may or may not be preserved
in the Off state.

2.1.5. State Transitions

The system and devices can change from one power state to another either
by explicit command or automatically based on APM parameters and system
activity.  The power capabilities of devices differ, and some devices
may not be capable of achieving all states.  Additionally, some devices
may have built-in automatic power management functions which are
invisible to the system, and therefor outside the scope of the APM
specification.


2.2. Power Management Software Layers

2.2.1. The Power Management BIOS

The System BIOS is the lowest level of power management software in the
system.  It will normally be supplied by the OEM and is specific to the
hardware platform.

The System BIOS will capable of providing power management functionality
without any support from the operating system or applications.  This
support is analogous the ad hoc power management methods implemented on
current generation laptop systems.  This functionality will be enhanced
once an APM aware operating system or environment establishes a
cooperative connection with the BIOS.  Once made, this connection
establishes a protocol that allows the firmware to communicate power
management events to the operating system and to wait for operating
system concurrence if necessary. Details of the System BIOS operational
changes are documented in the description of the interface.

2.2.2. The Operating System Layer

The operating system layer has three primary power management functions;

1) passing calls and information between the application and System BIOS layers
2) arbitrating application power management calls in a multitasking environment
3) identifying power saving opportunities not apparent at the
application layer. 

Different operating systems will require different PM application-to-OS
interfaces.  On some systems this interface may best be implemented
through software interrupts, while on other systems, a CALL and RET
interface may be a more appropriate.

Operating systems that can be enhanced by optional extensions may
require specialized interfaces to allow the extensions to assist in the
power management function.

2.2.3. The Application Layer

The application layer assists the power management function by providing
information that only the application is in a position to know or easily
ascertain.  Applications are not required to support the power
management function, but they can greatly increase its effectiveness,
particularly on less sophisticated operating systems.  Under MS-DOS in
particular, the application is often in the best position to know when
it is idle and awaiting user input.


3. Power Management Software Interfaces

3.1. The Power Management BIOS Interface

The System BIOS interface must support a variety of CPU modes so that
the System BIOS implementation can provide power management to a mixed
mode environment like MS-Dos.

A real mode interface will be required on all APM implementations and is
the primary APM interface.  This interface will be implemented with an
extension to the existing PC/AT Int 15h BIOS interface.  The System BIOS
Int 15h interface must operate in either real mode, or virtual- 86 mode
on 80386 and later processors. Since the INT 15h processor instruction
normally disables interrupts, the System BIOS can typically expect to be
entered with interrupts disabled.  However, the BIOS routines should not
depend on any particular setting, and should explicitly enable and
disable interrupts as necessary. To avoid re-entering Int 15h, an
Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) should not try to use any of the APM
functions.

To better support the protected modes of 80286 and later processors, the
System BIOS will optionally support a 16-bit and 32-bit protect mode
interface directly callable from protected mode.  The protected mode
interfaces must first be initialized using the real mode Int 15h AH=53h.
Systems not supporting APM will return from this call with Carry Set and
AH=86h

The 16-bit and 32-bit protected mode interfaces must be initialized
using the Protected Mode 16-bit Interface Connect and Protected Mode
32-bit Interface Connect functions before these interfaces can be used.

If an error condition is detected during the processing of a System BIOS
function, upon return to the caller the carry (CY) flag will be set and
the AH register will contain an error code.  The carry flag will be
clear upon return from any successful call, and the contents of the AH
register will be dependent on the particular call.

To allow for direct control of devices, this interface will adopt a
convention for identifying a device class and specific subclasses within
that class. For example, A class would be all Disk devices and the
subclasses would be the physical unit numbers. APM calls will take this
parameter, in a word length register where the most significant byte
will be the device class and the least significant byte will be the
device subclass. The impact of this parameter will be described in the
individual interface descriptions. The APM Class/Subclass IDs will be
defined as follows:



	BX = Device ID
		00XXh	System 
			00		System BIOS
			01		All devices power managed by the System Bios
		01XXh	Display
		02XXh	Secondary Storage
		03XXh	Parallel Ports
		04XXh	Serial Ports

		0500 - FFFFH	Reserved
	
		where:	
			XX h = Physical Device Number (0 based)
			FFh = All devices in this class
				

3.1.1. Interface Connect

An APM compliant System BIOS will likely provide some degree of power
management functionality without any support from system or application
software.  The OEM or BIOS provider determines the degree to which power
management functionality is implemented by the BIOS in a stand-alone
configuration.

APM provides a cooperative interface between the System BIOS and other
system or application software that makes the other software a partner
in the power management process.  Once this cooperative interface is
established the System BIOS will inform its partner of significant power
related events, and rely on its partner to actively participate in the
power management process.  Some of the System BIOS functions can be
called regardless of whether or not the cooperative PM interface has
been established between the BIOS and the caller.  However, some
functions, particularly those related to notification of power events,
will not operate until the cooperative interface is established.


3.1.1.1. APM Installation Check

Allows the caller to determine if the system's BIOS supports the APM
functionality and if so, which version of the specification it supports.

Call with:
	AH	= 53h
	AL	= 00h  -  Do APM installation check
	BX	= 0000H - System Bios



Returns:
	if function successful:
	Carry 	= 0
	AH	= major version number (in BCD format)
	AL	= minor version number (in BCD format)
	BH	= ASCII "P" character
	BL	= ASCII "M" character
	CX	= flags
		bit 0 = 1 if 16-bit protected mode interface is supported.
		bit 1 = 1 if 32-bit protected mode interface is supported.
		bit 2 = 1 if CPU Idle call slows processor clock speed.
		bit 3 = 1 if BIOS Power Management is disabled.
		all other bits reserved.

	if function unsuccessful:
	Carry	= 1 Indicates error condition
	AH	= 86h APM not present

The interpretation of bit 2 is documented under the CPU Busy call description.

This call is only available using the real mode Int 15h interface.


3.1.1.2. Interface Connect

Establishes the cooperative interface between the caller and the System
BIOS.  Before the interface is established, the System BIOS will provide
its own power management functionality as implemented by the OEM.  Once
the interface is established (connected), the System BIOS and the caller
will coordinate PM activities according to this specification.

Call with:
	AH	= 53h
	AL	= 01h
	BX	= 0000H - System Bios

Returns:
	If function successful:
	Carry = 0
	If function unsuccessful:
	Carry	 = 1
	AH	= error code
			02h interface connection already in effect.
			09h Unrecognized device ID

This call is only available using the APM Int 15h interface.


3.1.1.3. Protected Mode 16-bit Interface Connect

Initializes the optional 16-bit protected mode interface between the
caller and the System BIOS.  This interface allows a protected mode
caller to invoke the System BIOS functions without the need to first
switch into real or virtual-86 mode.  A caller that does not operate in
protected mode may not need to use this call.  This function establishes
a 16-bit protected mode interface, but this function must be invoked in
either real or virtual-86 mode using the Int 15h interface.

Call with:
 	AH	= 53h
	AL	= 02h
	BX	= 0000H - System Bios

Returns:
	if function successful:
	Carry	= 0
	AX	= PM 16-bit code segment
		 (real mode segment base address)
	BX	= offset of entry point
	CX	= PM 16-bit data segment 
		(real mode segment base address)
	if function unsuccessful:
	Carry	= 1
	AH	= error code
		05h = 16-bit protected mode interface already established.
		06h = 16-bit protected mode interface not supported
		09h = Unrecognized device-id

The System BIOS 16-bit protected mode interface requires 2 consecutive
selector/segment descriptors for use as a 16-bit code and data segment,
respectively.  The caller must initialize these descriptors using the
segment base information returned in the call from the BIOS.  The
segment limit fields will arbitrarily be set to 64k.  These selectors
may either be in the GDT or LDT, but must be valid whenever the System
BIOS is to be called in protected mode.  The code segment descriptor
must specify protection level 0, and the BIOS routines must be invoked
with CPL = 0 so they can execute privileged instructions.

The caller invokes the System BIOS using the 16-bit interface by making
a far call to the code segment selector it initializes, with the offset
returned in BX.  The caller must supply a stack large enough for modest
use by the BIOS and by potential interrupt handlers.  The caller's stack
will be active if or when interrupts are enabled in the BIOS routine;
the BIOS will not switch stacks when interrupts are enabled, including
NMI interrupts.  The BIOS 16-bit interface requires that it be called
with a 16-bit stack.

When the System BIOS routines are called in protected mode, the current
I/O permission bit map must allow access to the I/O ports the BIOS may
need to access in the process of performing the selected function.

The System BIOS will reject additional 16-bit protected mode connections
if a connection has already been established.

This call is only available using the APM Int 15h interface.


3.1.1.4. Protected Mode 32-bit Interface Connect

Initializes the optional 32-bit protected mode interface between the
caller and the System BIOS.  This interface allows a protected mode
caller to invoke the System BIOS functions without the need to first
switch into real or virtual-86 mode.  A caller that does not operate in
protected mode may not need to use this call.  This function establishes
a 32-bit protected mode interface, but this function must be invoked in
either real or virtual-86 mode using the Int 15h interface.

Call with:
 	AH	= 53h
	AL	= 03h
	BX	= 0000H - System Bios

Returns:
	if function successful:
	Carry 	= 0
	AX	= PM 32-bit code segment (real mode segment base address)
	EBX	= offset of entry point
	CX	= PM 16-bit code segment (real mode segment base address)
	DX	= PM data segment (real mode segment base address)
	if function unsuccessful:
	Carry 	= 1
	AH	= error code
			07h = 32-bit protected mode interface already established.
			08h = 32-bit protected mode interface not supported
			09h = Unrecognized Device-ID

The System BIOS 32-bit protected mode interface requires 3 consecutive
selector/segment descriptors for use as 32-bit code, 16-bit code, and
data segments, respectively.  Both 32-bit and 16-bit code segment
descriptors are necessary so the System BIOS 32-bit interface can call
other BIOS routines in a 16-bit code segment if it necessary.  The
caller must initialize these descriptors using the segment base
information returned in the call from the BIOS.  The segment limit
fields will arbitrarily be set to 64k.  These selectors may either be in
the GDT or LDT, but must be valid whenever the System BIOS is to be
called in protected mode.  The code segment descriptors must specify
protection level 0, and the BIOS routines must be invoked with CPL = 0
so they can execute privileged instructions.

The caller invokes the System BIOS using the 32-bit interface by making
a far call to the 32-bit code segment selector it initializes, with the
offset returned in EBX.  The caller must supply a stack large enough for
modest use by the BIOS and by potential interrupt handlers.  The
caller's stack will be active if or when interrupts are enabled in the
BIOS routine; the BIOS will not switch stacks when interrupts are
enabled, including NMI interrupts.  The BIOS 32-bit entry point requires
that it be called with a 32-bit stack.

When the System BIOS routines are called in protected mode, the current
I/O permission bit map must allow access to the I/O ports the BIOS may
need to access in the process of performing the selected function.

The System BIOS will reject additional 32-bit protected mode connections
if it a 32-bit protected mode connection has already been established.

This call is only available using the APM Int 15h interface.


3.1.1.5. Interface Disconnect

Breaks the cooperative interaction between the System BIOS and the
caller, and in the process restores the System BIOS' default (built-in)
functionality.  Any protected mode connection set up by the Protected
Mode 16-bit Interface Connect or Protected Mode 32-bit Interface Connect
functions are also invalidated by this call.

Even though this call returns control of power management strategy to
the System BIOS, the parameter values (timer values, enable/disable
settings, etc.) in effect at the time of the disconnect will remain in
effect.

Call with:
 	AH	= 53h
	AL	= 04h
	BX	= 0000h - System BIOS
Returns:
	if function successful:
	Carry	= 0
	If function unsuccessful:
	Carry	= 1
	AH	= error code
			03h = interface not connected
			09h = Unrecognized Device-ID

This call is available in both the APM Int 15h and the Protect mode interfaces.



3.1.2. CPU Control

3.1.2.1. CPU Idle

Informs the System BIOS that the system is currently idle, and that
processing should be suspended until the next system event (typically an
interrupt) occurs.  This function allows the System BIOS to take some
implementation specific power saving action, such as a CPU HLT
instruction or stopping the CPU clock.

In cases where an interrupt causes the system to leave the idle state,
the interrupt may or may not have been serviced when the BIOS returns
from the CPU Idle call.  The caller should not make any assumptions
concerning interrupt servicing, and should allow pending interrupts to
be taken upon return from CPU Idle.

If interrupts are serviced from within the BIOS CPU Idle function, the
interrupt handler must return to the BIOS when the interrupt processing
is completed.  The caller cannot use it's knowledge of being in the idle
state to retain control from an interrupt handler.  For example, some
system implementations may slow the processor CPU clock rate before
waiting on an interrupt, and restore the normal clock rate after the
interrupt is serviced but before returning from the idle call.

When the caller regains control from the System BIOS idle routine, it
should determine if there is actually any processing to be performed,
and reissue the CPU Idle call if not.  If the caller is a multitasking
supervisor, it may be necessary for it to dispatch its applications,
allowing them to check for activity that they should now perform.

Call with:
	AH		= 53h
	AL		= 05H

Returns success:
	CY = 0

This function is available in both the APM Int 15h and Protect Mode interface.


3.1.2.2. CPU Busy

Informs the System BIOS that the system is now busy and processing
should continue at full speed.  Some system implementations may only be
able to slow the CPU clock rate and return in response to the CPU Idle
call.  It is expected that the System BIOS will restore the CPU clock
rate to its normal rate when it recognizes increased system activity
(typically interrupt driven), but it may be unable to do so when
interrupts are hooked by external software and do not invoke BIOS
routines.

In cases where this is possible, the caller can ensure the system is
running at full speed by invoking the CPU Busy function.  Upon return
from the APM Installation Check call, bit 2 of the CX register indicates
if the System BIOS slows the CPU clock rate during the CPU Idle call.
The caller can use this bit to determine if it wishes to call CPU Busy
before executing code that it wants run at full speed.

Calling CPU Busy when the system is already operating at full speed is
discouraged due to the unnecessary call overhead, but the operation is
allowed and will have no unexpected side effects.


Call with:
	AH		= 53h
	AL		= 06H

Returns success:
	CY = 0

This function is available in both the APM Int 15h and Protect Mode interface.

3.1.3. Set Power State

3.1.3.1. Call Description

This call will place the system or device specified in the power device
ID into the requested state.

Call with:
	AH	 = 53h
	AL = 07H
	BX	 = Power Device ID
	CX	 = System State ID
			0000H Ready*
			0001H Stand-by
			0002H Suspend
			0003H Off*
			0004H-FFFFH Reserved
			* Not supported for System Device ID 0001H
Returns:
	If function successful:
	Carry 	= 0


	If function unsuccessful:
	Carry	= 1
	AH	= error code
			01h = power management functionality disabled
			09h = Unrecognized Device ID
			0Ah= Parameter value in CX out of range
			60h = Cannot enter requested state

This call is available in both the APM Int 15h and Protect Mode interfaces.


3.1.3.2. System Stand-by

Explicitly commands the System BIOS to put the system into the stand-by
state.  The caller invokes this function in response to a System
Stand-by Request Notification from the System BIOS after the caller has
performed any processing of its own.  The caller may also initiate a
stand-by operation at its own discretion.  For example, it the caller
determines that the system is idle and is not already in the stand-by
state.

The state, typically, is exited when an interrupt is raised. Interrupts
can be serviced normally.

Call with:
	AH	= 53H
	AL	= 07H
	BX	= 0001H
	CX	= 0001H

This call is available in both the APM Int 15h and Protect Mode interfaces.


3.1.3.2.1. Suspend System

Explicitly commands the System BIOS to put the system into the low power
suspended state.  The caller invokes this function in response to a
Suspend System Request Notification from the System BIOS after the
caller (presumably an operating system or similar environment) has
performed any pre-suspend processing of its own.  In addition to
responding to System BIOS requests, the caller may initiate a suspend
operation at its own discretion.  For example, it the caller determines
that the system has been completely idle (for other than normal
'background' processing like servicing timer interrupts, etc..) during a
given time interval it could request a system suspend using this call.

The System BIOS will not return to the caller until the system is
resumed from the suspended state.  This eliminates the need for most
resume notifications from the System BIOS.  Upon return, and when safe
to do so, the caller may notify any PM aware applications of the resume.

Since the system may have been suspended for a long period of time, the
caller may need to update its date and time values.

Call with:
	AH	= 53H
	AL	= 07H
	BX	= 0001H
	CX	= 0002H

This call is available in both the APM Int 15h and Protect Mode interfaces.

3.1.4. Power Management Status/Control

3.1.4.1. Enable/Disable Power Management Functionality

This function allows the caller to enable or disable all APM automatic
power down functionality.  When disabled, the System BIOS will not
automatically power down devices, enter the stand-by state, enter the
suspended state, or take power saving steps in response to CPU Idle
calls.  In addition, many System BIOS functions will be disabled and
will return error 01h, power management functionality disabled.

Call with:
	AH		= 53H
	AL		= 08H
	BX		= FFFFH Enable/Disable all power management
	CX		= 0 to disable power management
			= 1 to enable power management

Returns:
	if function successful:
	Carry flag	= clear
	If function unsuccessful:
	Carry flag	= set
	AH		= error code
				01h = power management functionality disabled
				09h = Unrecognized Device ID
				0Ah=Parameter value in CX out of range

This call is available in both the APM Int 15h and Protect Mode interfaces




3.1.4.2. Restore SYSTEM-BIOS Power On Defaults 

This call will request the BIOS reinitialize all its power-on defaults.

Call with:
	AH		= 53H
	AL		= 09H
	BX		= FFFFH

Returns:
	if function successful:
	Carry flag	= clear
	If function unsuccessful:
	Carry flag	= set
	AH		= error code
				09h = Unrecognized Device ID

This call is available in both the APM Int 15h and Protect Mode interfaces.


3.1.4.3. Get Power Status

Returns the systems current power status.

Call with:
	AH		= 53H
	AL		= 0AH
	BX		= 0001H

Returns:
	if function successful:
	Carry 	= 0
	BH		= AC line status
				0	= off-line
				1	= on-line
				255	= unknown
				all other values reserved
	BL		= Battery status
				0	= high
				1	= low
				2	= critical
				3	= charging
				255	= unknown
				all other values reserved
	CL		= Remaining battery life
				0 - 100	= % of full charge
				255		= unknown
	If function unsuccessful:
	Carry 	= 1
	AH		= error code
				09h = Unrecognized Device ID

This call is available in both the APM Int 15h and Protect Mode interfaces.

3.1.5. Power Management Event Notification

Power events are often asynchronous to normal system operation and can
occur at times when the system software is not immediately ready to
process the event.  In order to synchronize power events with other
system software, the System BIOS will withhold event notification until
polled with the Get PM Event function.  This allows the cooperative PM
software to only receive event notification when it is ready to process
the event.

The PM partner receives notification of power events by periodically
calling the Get PM Event function.  Power management events are not
extremely time critical, and a polling frequency of once or twice a
second should be sufficient.


3.1.5.1. Get PM Event

Returns the next pending PM event, or indicates if no PM events are pending.

Call with:
	AH		= 53H
	AL		= 0BH

Returns:
	if function successful:
	Carry 	= 0
	BX		= PM event code
				01H System Stand-by Request Notification
				02H System Suspend Request Notification
				03H Normal Resume System Notification
				04H Critical Resume System Notification
				05H Battery Low Notification


	If function unsuccessful:
	Carry 	= 1
	AH		= error code
				03h = interface connection not established
				80h = no PM events pending

The PM event notification codes and their interpretation are described
in the following sections.

This call is available in both the APM Int 15h and Protect Mode interfaces.


3.1.5.1.1. System Stand-by Request Notification

Notifies the PM partner that the System BIOS wishes to put the system
into a stand-by state.  The System BIOS will not take any action at this
time, but instead wait for the partner to call the System Stand-by
function.

3.1.5.1.2. Suspend System Request Notification

Notifies the PM partner that the System BIOS wishes to put the system
into a suspended state.  The System BIOS will not actually perform a
suspend at this time, but instead wait for the partner to call the
Suspend System function.

3.1.5.1.3. Battery Low Notification

Informs the PM partner that the system's battery is running low.

3.1.5.1.4. Resume System Notification

Indicates that a critical system suspend and resume operation occurred
without the cooperation of the PM partner.  When a suspend operation is
to occur, the System BIOS will normally notify the partner via the
Suspend System Request, but not actually perform the suspend until the
partner calls the Suspend System function.  In some emergency siltations
this may not be possible, and the System BIOS may need to suspend the
system immediately.  In this siltation, the System BIOS informs the
partner that the system has resumed from such a suspend via the Resume
System Notification.  This notification allows the partner to recover
from the suspend as best it can.

3.1.6. Impact on Existing APIs

3.1.6.1. Watchdog Timers / System Alarm Services

These services will continue to function in an APM compliant System BIOS
in all power states except off. An application using these services can
expect to be given control at the specified date and time and that the
system will be in the ready state.

John,
	Back when we were first implementing our ESnet decnet circuit
over NEARnet, you mentioned that one option would be to setup a Multinet
decnet tunnel with a gateway machine at MIT. Currently we have a dedicated 
area 43 router between the ethernet segment our ESnet node is on and the 
ethernet segment the NEARnet router is on. The reason we have this router is
because the main campus router that connects these two segments is in area 62
and the NEARnet router has a max area of 46 (I think, it may be 47).
	Our ESnet node now has Multinet installed on it. We would like to
setup a Multinet Decnet tunnel between our ESnet node and the the ESnet gatway
node at MIT. The plan would then be to retire the dedicated area 43 router
between the two ethernet segments and just have the main campus (area 62) 
router be used. I beleave the ESnet gateway node's decnet name is ESGATE. What 
is this machine's internet host name and what coordination needs to be done to 
setup this multinet tunnel? Once we have the multinet tunnel setup and the area 
43 router retired, you could reuse this router's area 43 decnet adress for some 
other ESnet NEARnet node.

Tomorrow afternoon we will be opening w20.  But before we do, we will 
celebrate another successful deployment.  Please join us in toasting the 
development team and thanking them for all their hard work this summer.  
Rumor has it that there may even be food allowed in the cluster for the 
occasion!

Time:  1:00

Ruth seems somewhat interested in cooking some dinner tomorrow.  She
says she's more likely to decide to do it if there are more people to
cook for.  Interested?  (I don't know what time it'll be.  We'll
probably be going to BJ's first, so probably not before 7 or 8.)

Cecilia,

I know Katie wrote to you a while back with the decision we had decided 
to go with an in-house email system for our alums for now.  I'm writing 
with some of the details.

While the Athena proposal was attractive, and we believe we will move in 
its direction in a few years, at the moment we'd prefer to "get our feet 
wet" with a basic email service with low initial costs to both ourselves 
and those who subscribe to the service.

We plan on setting up a Macintosh-based email and bbs system using the 
FirstClass software package from SoftArc.  This system supports both 
dial-up and network users, with accessibility from Mac and Windows 
clients and via terminal emulation.  We would initially install 4 analog 
lines for the alums and AppleTalk clients on our Mac network for our 
staff and our alums.  I have heard good things about the package on 
various listserv groups I subscribe to, and the Boston Computer 
Society's Mac user group recently switched to FirstClass as its system.  

One FirstClass option we would like to install is PostalUnion Deluxe, an 
Internet email gateway between the FirstClass system and Internet.  For 
this we would equip the gateway Mac (probably a IIcx) with an MITNet 
drop as the Internet side of the connection.  Is this okay?  I would not 
expect great amount of traffic from this - the only traffic FirstClass 
generates is email - but thought it necessary to check with you before 
we purchase the setup.  The gateway is very stable - Information 
Electronics (who wrote the gateway) will provide us with references if 
we wish; they mentioned one site in Canada where their gateway is 
handling 20,000 pieces of mail per day.

On a separate note, we would also like to set up a Mac as an FTP/gopher 
server on the Internet for our alums already with Internet accounts to 
access documents from.  The package I would use is "ftpd" which is 
already in use at many sites -- the coordinators of several of the Mac 
mailing lists I belong to are now making shareware and other documents 
this using this package.  Again, I don't expect a big traffic load, just 
wanted to clear this with DCNS before we did anything....

We do expect to move to the Athena model in a few years.  But for now 
with our tight finances we can get this system up and running for under 
$5,000 and gain experience and a better sense of our market.

Thanks!  Look forward to hearing from you.

It's time to gear the team up again to prepare for testing.  We used
to meet 10-11am on Thursday mornings.  I'd rather meet later, and
suspect that people's schedules have changed in the last couple of
months.  

Can people make Tuesday afternoon (the 23rd) at 3pm?

Here is a truly small patch to pl12 that should hopefully fix some
problems: the first actually being a possible lock-up under some
circumstances.  The other patches are just added checks in mmap() to
make MAP_SHARED + PROT_WRITE type mmap's fail gracefully (instead of the
unpatched behaviour where the mmap returns successfully, but the
mmapping doesn't actually work as it should: linux doesn't do write
mappings yet). 

The uuencoded stuff is the same patch, just in case your mailer eats
whitespace (actually, the patches are so small that they are probably
easier to add by hand anyway).

My first "gut" reaction is "Sounds like a good start." Although I am not
personally familiar with the FirstClass software, there are many successful
BBS systems in the world and as a result quite a few competent packages.
Perhaps more importantly, these packages are often designed to be easy to
use.

I believe that recent alumni will be underwhelmed and it will certainly not
be viewed as an alumni extension of Athena. On the other hand older (richer?)
alumni who are at best beginning computer users will have an easier time
then if the Alumni Office provided an Athena lookalike.

I like the idea of them operating a Gopher server. I am glad to see them
taking the initiative.

I do have some questions that I would like to ask.

How will alumni get registered to use this system?

Answer: I propose that all alumni have the ability to receive an account,
but only those who request one should in fact get one. It would be a *big*
mistake for them to create mailboxes for all alumni and then advertise
to other alumni that this was a good way to reach alumni. I, for one, would
not want a mailbox on that system to gather messages intended for me, that
I do not read!

How much manpower is the Alumni Office willing to devote to this?

Running a BBS can become a full time job, particularly if most users are
beginners. My suspicion is that the Alumni Office may well rise to the
challenge. I believe this because if nothing else it sounds like they
have the pride of ownership of this approach.

             	            MarketBase Systems Announces

				       the

			       M a r k e t B a s e (tm)
		         Online Catalog of Goods and Services
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
For Immediate Release

        The MarketBase(tm) Online Catalog of Goods and Services

Santa Barbara, CA - August 16, 1993 - MarketBase Systems today
announced the immediate availability of the MarketBase Online Catalog
of Goods and Services, a unique on-line service dedicated to providing
a forum where buyers and sellers meet to exchange the attributes of
products and services electronically.  FREE access is provided to
product purchasers.

MarketBase provides vendors with a round-the-clock electronic
"store front" where purchasers may browse for goods and services and
instantly access virtually any kind of sales information.

Purchasers are presented with a simple yet powerful series of screens
over a virtual terminal session that requires no specific client or
terminal emulator.  Access is provided via gopher, telnet, ftp, and
dial up modems.  A non-interactive interface will soon be available 
through SMTP (E-mail) for sites that cannot exchange IP with the
Internet in "real-time".

MarketBase gives the gopher user a sophisticated server that allows
customized queries much like what one might expect from a relational
database.

Anyone with a modem or Internet connection can access MarketBase
immediately.  The user interface is simple enough that first-time users
can easily navigate the database and quickly find the product or
service information of interest.  No manuals or training are required.
The interface guides the user from one screen to the next until the
desired product information is delivered.  Complete help is available
at all times through the user interface itself.

Unlike other online product information services, MarketBase is provided
completely FREE OF CHARGE TO PURCHASERS.  Vendors pay a nominal fee to
maintain their product information on MarketBase.

How to Access MarketBase(tm)
----------------------------
1) Internet Gopher.  Point your gopher client at mb.com, port 70.

2) Telneting to MarketBase(tm).  Simply telnet to mb.com.  At the
   "login: " prompt type "mb" followed by a return.

3) Dialup via a data modem.  Set the characteristics of the serial
   port attached to your modem to 8 bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit.
   The number is: (805) 964-3410.  You should get a "login" prompt
   no more than 10 seconds after the modems have finished negotiating
   protocols.

How to register your good or service with MarketBase
----------------------------------------------------
1) Internet Gopher.  Select the "Register Product" item in the root
   menu and follow the prompts.  Or, use your gopher client to mail
   yourself a copy of the registration form from the
   "About MarketBase ..." directory.

2) Send a message to register@mb.com requesting a product registration
   form.  We will send you a form via return E-mail.  Fill in the form(s)
   then E-mail to register@mb.com.

3) Telnet to mb.com.  Log in as user "register".

4) Set your modem to 8N1 and dial up (805) 964-3410.  Log in as user
   "register".

5) FAX requests for or transmit completed product registration forms to
   (805) 964-7430.

6) Send requests for or completed product registration forms to:

    MarketBase Systems
    190 Pebble Hill Drive
    Santa Barbara, CA 93111

INTRODUCTORY OFFER

For a limited time only, register your good or service on MarketBase
for 30 days at no obligation.  You will be billed only for the 2nd
and succeeding months.

Hi, Ted I have some problems with my mail system. Its not working due to some      
reson, I am working on it very hard. Also can you send the tape to me rather then
sending it to Walnut.  

I have a local source here. The directory structure can be 8 directory deep.
but don't go that deep, also when you make the tape can you make sure that you  
dont put any DES or RSA stuff on it.

If you tape 8 MM or DAT. Also send them by UPS or FED EX to

They haven't budgeted anything incremental for this project since its

I propose using the symbolic name "FamilyLocalHost", for lack of
anything better.  I also propose the following extension to libXau: a
function XauChangedAuth, which will return TRUE if the authority file
has changed since the last time it was called.  CheckAuthorization will
call XauChangedAuth, and do a ResetAuthorization if it returns true.
How does this sound?

Doug,

	You keep insisting that message that are critical of your
positions ("flames") be sent to you personally.  Again, methinks you
miss the point.  Many of the responses you are receiving are motivated
by a desire to emphasize to the mailing list membership that your
positions are held in very low esteem by the message originators.
Otherwise, the originators might not bother sending the messages at
all or might send the messages directly to you.  You have been very
consistent in merely restating your positions, not responding to
reasoned arguments.  This motivates the sort of messages you have been
receiving, since unanswered statements on mailing lists are sometimes
interpreted as vaild or correct becausae they go unchallenged.

It would also be nice if there were a way to somehow couple
the username assignment to kerberos/moira.  At some point
alums might find it desirable to be "so-and-so@mit.edu" and
we might not be able to do that easily if Alumni maintained
a separate namespace.

Cec - 

The Alumni/ae Association sounds enthusiastic about electronic 
communication for alums.  We should do everything we can to encourage 
them.

I see nothing particularly wrong with the approach they suggest.  
Michael Barrow has had direct experience with the BCS's systems, and 
thus can probably offer the most informed opinion.  I think that they 
underestimate the support costs of running such a system.

I believe that we should be able to offer a similar level of service at 
a lower cost.  For example a 4 line slip server, TechMail accounts,  
TechInfo, and NetNews, would seem to me to offer all they are proposing.  
While we should not discourage them from moving forward, we should 
encourage the use of larger, central, more cost effective, shared 
resources rather than lots of little servers all over the place.

There has been some discussion from time to time of IS managing an MIT 
wide distribution service, a single machine (mit-dist.mit.edu ?) which 
would be accessible via TechInfo, Gopher, FTP, AFS, etc.  I think that 
such a service would be useful to many groups at MIT, including the 
Alumni/ae Association.  

I feel strongly the extending MITnet to MIT alums should be a key part 
of our future plans and direction.  Perhaps we should offer to work with 
them in their experimental foray into cyberspace, and offer to pick up 
the tab for the first year.

I want to tell you that my problem was resolved.
Yesterday, I called Novutell, a modem company in California.
They faxed me page on how to set modem to com3+irq5. Apparently, I am not the 
only one who needs this information. After set the modem up, I 
remade the kernel (pl11) with one change in 
/usr/src/linux/kernel/chh_drv/serial.c (set irq to 5 for ttyS2).
As you would expect, things work fine. I am very excited. Thank you
very much for the help.
By the way, before remaking the kernel, I used /etc/setserial /dev/cua2 irq 5 
in rc.local. It does NOT work.

Excellent stuff David. I was just about to email you and ask if we were ever
going to revive this thread which was in deep hibernation. I can't believe
after 8 months that it has re-surfaced which more positive interest. I don't
think even bears hibernate that long.

Although this seem like a good idea, I think eventually having links pointing
to appropriate libraries will have to be phased out. Libraries updates will
have to be determined by the major and minor verison numbers and used to load
it automatically - hence libc.so.4.4.2 will automatically be loaded if
libc.so.4 was required by ignoring the major/minor no. which will only be used
to determine a more recent update. But then again how does one cope with
libraries without version numbers (although a "bad" thing some libraries
e.g. libemu - the dos emulator library - does this me thinks Bob ??)

Definetly ld.so is the way to go for reasons above and those I hve explained
in the past. However what you didn't mention is that loading times will be a
bit longer as the loading stage requires reading from either a in memory cache
or having to open and read /etc/ld.so.cache to determine the latest version
whenever a shared binary is executed.

Can you explain the strategy for the cache building you implemented (if you
have) ?? The last time we spoke (emailed) it seems you were concerned with the
time required for reading the cache amongst other things.

Other points to ponder is whether the cache should be built dynamically
(deja-vu David :-) i.e.  without the need for executing ldconfig whenever a
new library(ies) are installed - this could be achieved by reading the
st_mtime on the trusted load directory paths comparing it with the
/etc/ld.so.cache and rebuilding if necessary. This is a step forward from
SunOS's ldconfig which requires the cache to be built manually, however as
you guessed the load time for the first binary to be executed after a new
library is installed, (probably the command `ls' i guess), will be slightly
longer as we will have to fork the ldconfig program and then renew the in
memory cache.  However I have no reservations against this as it is a
zillion times better that installing new DLL's and then maually relinking
each of libm, libc..... Surely the automatic cache rebuild will be quicker
and less error prone (How many times have we all seen the "Help: trashed my
libc.so.4 link" in the newsgroups).

Way to go David !!

Mitch

Hello all,

For those of you who don't know, I've been working on providing
technical feedback on NLSP (ISO11577) to ISO for the past two years
(via NIST's X3S3.3 Rep. Dale Walters).  This has been an extremely
frustrating, and drawn-out endeavor but it has provided me with a
fairly in-depth knowledge on the connectionless portion of the ISO
document.  Through this e-mail mailing list and long conversations with
Richard Colella (a colleague of mine here at NIST that attends the IETF
meetings), I've pretty much followed the efforts of this group and your
discussions on the problems with NLSP.

Several months ago I pondered and suggested to certain individuals that
the Internet could benefit from the ISO work, if and only if this
document (ISO11577) was more readable (hmmm, where have I seen this
before).  Well, everyone I talked to agreed that this was a good idea,
if only someone had the time to re-write ISO11577, so that it only had
the connectionless portions and was more readable.

Well, in my spare time over the past few weeks, I've gone ahead and
rewrote the document.  I've deleted all the connection-oriented
sections (this is not to say that these sections didn't have merit,
just that they belong in a separate document), massaged some of the
text, and put a small twist on the protocol.  The twist is an
Integrated NLSP (I-NLSP), that will provide security services for both
IP and CLNP.  I wrapped it all up in an Internet Draft style and the
document is currently awaiting an in-house review. Once that is
finished I hope to submit it as an Internet Draft by 8/30/93.

The document isn't flawless by any means.  It still suffers from some
technical ambiguities and deficiencies that ISO felt were necessary.
I've put in several notes where I think the worst of these are
located.  Some of my interpretations may also have opened up other problems.
All of this can be worked out in open discussions, once the Draft
is posted.

I think the document is more readable now (at least the PDU structure
is located in one section ;).  It is a good starting point for the
services that are needed.   I firmly believe that one protocol for both
stacks is the best way to go (especially since the Internet is looking
into CLNP for various reasons).  I also hope to start rapid-prototyping
the I-NLSP protocol starting in October but that depends on funding.


Sincerely,


K. Robert Glenn (NIST)

Actually, the current Athena accounts policy is that any MIT staff
member can have an Athena account, provided a faculty member (or lab
director, manager or director or equivalent for non-academic
organizations) signs a form requesting the account.  What this means,
exactly, in terms of our licenses "for academic use" is not clear, but
that's the way the policy was changed last year.

And, of course, anyone who works for MIT in pretty much any capacity
can get a kerberos principle (basically, have an account name known in
the campus namespace) and/or get a TechMail account, even if they
don't want a full Athena account.

Entrance is normally $7; for groups > 25 (i think), it's $3.
There are 6 major attractions inside, each cost $3.

There isn't a lot to do beside the 6 attractions, and with it being $3 a
pop, you don't want to go unless you've gotten the $3 entrance fee.  I went
on 3 of the attractions; they were worth $2, but it's really debateable if
they were worth $3 (since they're all so short).

1: Virtuality #1
	This simulator has a helmet, waist-ring, and gun.  The idea is that
you wander about a series of planes (think 3-D chessboard) blasting various
objects and/or other people.  I didn't try this, although i've seen it
before.  Duration is probably 4 minutes.  Either people were clueless, or
it's easy to confuse the controls...

2: Freedom 6
	This is a OMNIMAX film, although it's something puny like an eighth
screen or something -- it doesn't do sensory flooding like a real OMNIMAX
(a big minus IMHO).  The seats are bolted down onto a platform which moves;
it's basically a different angle of doing Star Tours.  I went on this; it
was OK.  (I got bothered a lot by the fact that you bounce off walls a lot
and don't explode; that, and the film has a few discontinuities, or at
least, your ship somehow does these really amazing 135' turns.)  Duration
is probably 6 minutes; it was hard to tell.

3: Virtuality #2
	You can either pilot a hang glider (didn't try it) or a biplane.
Nothing moves; the helmet allows you (like the first Virtuality) to look in
any direction.  Response ain't so good; if you quickly twist your head, you
can hear the computer saying "GIMME THAT GODDAMN PAGE I NEED IT NOW!".  If
you pan slowly, it's ok.  It's OK for $3, even though the biplane controls
are a little screwy -- if you get shot up a lot, rather than crashing and
getting a new set of wings, it seems you just get grounded and can't do a
lot.  Duration about 4 minutes.

4: Chameleon
	Setup: 2 pods opposite each other on a centrifuge.  Simulation:
race car driving.  You go fast, the pods orient such that you're pressed
back; you go into a turn, you feel the g-forces, blah blah blah.  Note that
it's 2 people per pod, so one person (the first person who gets in) does
the steering and gas; the other person is there mostly for the ride (he
controls the forward/reverse singleton gear).  Something really screwy --
the screen is sufficiently large -and- close that the driver is at a
definate angle -- makes driving in a straight line difficult.  Duration
about 2 minutes -- it's over fast!  

5: Reactor
	Ever been on Star Tours?  Exactly the same thing.  I didn't go on
this, since I've been on Star Tours myself.  A twist on this is that
individual seats move, rather than the whole cabin.  I heard that having
the whole cabin move is more realistic (even though, relativistically
speaking, they're equivalent i think...)  Unclear what duration is: my
guess is 6 minutes or so.

6: Somethingorother
	This is interesting to watch, but i certainly wouldn't pay money.
It's essentially interactive TV -- you sit in front of a camera, and
there's a TV in front of you.  Displayed behind the on-screen you is, say,
a soccer net.  Soccer balls now start flying in; you flap your arms around,
and if your on-screen arms hit the on-screen ball, the on-screen ball does
the proverbial on-screen (yes, i'm being silly; sue me) bouncing away.
There are a variety of options (make your own video; play with bouncing a
ball around; the soccer frob; i think there are 3 others).  No clue what
duration is; i'd guess 4-6 minutes.

There are also various arcade games in there and a few Macs displaying
something or other.  There's a continuous laser show (it's mostly for mob
pleasing, i think, but it's still kinda neat) and videos of computer
animation (a lot of which looks a lot like the stuff done at the AI Leg
Lab).  It's cute.  The arcade games are mostly boring; the few cool ones
have controls which are sufficiently ill-defined as to make them difficult
to play (it's hard to maneuver accurately in 3D with only 2 controls).
Most games are 50c to play.

Lines aren't short -- expect 45-60 minute waits if you arrive around 6.
After 8, the lines shorten dramatically.  Food is available inside for
probably exorbitant prices (I didn't check).  No readmittance, so grab food
at South Station before you come (there's a McBread, McD, and Sbarro's,
among other things).  There's a shuttle which you can take for free from
South Station -- as you come out of South Station, across the street to the
right-ish is a black stone circle and a black box.  The bus stops in front
of that.  If the driver stops at the front of the WTC, go down the
escalators; if he drives past the escalators and goes to the traffic
circle, backtrack blahblahblah.  Note that TOC is not actually inside the
WTC, but across the street.  The show closes at 10:30pm; they are closed
today for a private audience.

So, for $12, you can see 3 of the events.  Is it worth 2 movies?  Heh,
well, that depends on what movies you want to see, but my guess is
"probably not, unless you have a real job".  It seems that what really
needs to happen is a Media scum needs to link up with a M.E. jock and start
making a ludicrous amount of money...

Oh, and if you're Wes Carroll (who, curiously enough, is not on either of
these lists), you'd probably enjoy the amazing speaker setup they have,
which is synced to the laser show.  Amazing bass output.  You could just
-feel- the C# D# F# G# F# bass line in "Danger Zone" (from Top Gun)...  way
cool.  :> !

Just to give you some hints omn the -ms macros:
I symlinked tmac.ms to tmac.mgs and whoops everything worked. Some warnings
might appear since the GNU-ms needs some spaces where U**X-ms does not, but in
most cases you can ignore them.

Happy groff-ing,

Enough people expressed interest in seeing a more complete package
including an ldconfig that I agreed to look into it.  It just took me
longer than expected. :-)  I just finished a two month long crunch at
work to get our latest release ready, so I should have more time to 
spend on Linux-related projects -- for a while, anyway.

Before ld.so goes public, however, there are a couple of things that
need to be handled.  First, the startup code should probably be
changed to load ld.so using mmap instead of uselib.  This would allow
ld.so to be unloaded using munmap since it's only needed at startup.
Second, in addition to the DLL code, which uses a BSD-style copyright,
ld.so also includes some functions lifted from the Linux kernel, which
are GPL'd.  Either the DLL authors need to allow their code to be
GPL'd, or Linus needs to let us use his code with a less restrictive
copyright.

There is also one other change, which I feel is highly desirable, but
could probably wait for a future version.  That is to provide some
mechanism for a configurable, default LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  We all know
this can't be done securely with environment variables but could be
done with a root-owned file (/etc/ld.so.conf?).  An implementation
involving shared memory might also be possible, but I don't know
enough about that to know if could be made secure.

> Sounds like a good idea; it would certainly be more automatic than your

That's my feeling also.  The chlib idea was a real quickie I got after
reading the recent batch of messages in c.o.l about accidentally
deleted links.  Since I'd already written and tested it when I got the
new idea, I decided to release it anyway.

Before I begin reworking my current ldconfig, however, I need some
input on the following issue:

I originally envisioned ldconfig scanning the specified directories
and creating all symlinks in a single directory, /lib by default.
However, this can be problematic for systems that mount libraries with
NFS.  For example, if the administrator on a system that exports its
/usr partition upgrades a library, runs ldconfig locally and then
deletes the old library, every system that imports /usr would then
have a symlink to a nonexistent library.  I know this particular
scenario could be avoided by properly educating administrators, but
I'm not sure how effective that would be, especially with the growing
number of Unix-newbies Linux is attracting.

Another approach, which makes some sense to me, is for ldconfig to
only create symlinks in the directory where a library is found.  This
ensures that if the link is available, the library itself is also
available.  The downside is that all directories which contain
libraries need to be in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  For our current needs, a
default path of /usr/X386/lib, /usr/lib and /lib would probably
suffice.  In the long run, however, this approach would require the
flexibility of a configurable, default path like the one mentioned
above.

Comments?

When the Internet was small and collegial, we could and did trust each
other to do the right thing w.r.t. to system security, not spoofing
protocols, and otherwise behaving like civilized people.

The Internet is no longer small, and since it encompasses a much more
representative sample of the people of the earth, we've got some less
than benevolent people online, along with everyone else.

There are lots of ways to attack a host over the network, particularly
if the attacker is satisfied with denial of service. Some attacks can
be repelled with terminal defenses. However, there exist attacks which
there is no defense against, save tracing the attacker to the source,
and stopping it there.

Being able to trace attacks easily depends upon being able to assume
that the return IP address is at least correct in its network/subnet
portion, and following the routing system backward. This also assumes
that the routing system itself has not been compromised. Fortunately,
every IP network service vendor I've ever run into is extremely
conservative with his/her routing system w.r.t. what information they
will accept from particular sources - my impression is that primarily
this concern stems from a desire to keep the system stable for reliable
operation rather than security, but it has the desired effect for the
purpose of this discussion.

However, there exist a set of attacks which do not require that the
source IP address on the packets be even vaguely related to its network
of origin, because two-way communication is not necessary to the
success of the attack. For some subset of these attacks, there is no
effective host-based defense. In order to stop the attack, one must be
able to identify the attacking host, and stop the attack there.

In order to preserve traceability of an IP address in this scenario, I
propose that all IP network service providers filter their network
links to their clients, such that the clients are only allowed to
inject packets into the Internet which have an IP source address within
the known allocated IP network numbers for that client. Most
commercially available IP routers have the capability to filter IP
packets as I suggest - it is simply one more filter list to manage on a
per-client basis, like which IP network numbers they are allowed to
inject into the routing system.

It may also be fruitful to examine adding an option to IP router
requirements that they can be configured to drop packets for which
there is no explicit route to the source address in their tables. This
could be used to simplify the administration of filtering at the edges
of the Internet.

Please do not construe this missive as advocating authentication by IP
address. I eagerly await deployment of strong crypto-authentication
systems on an Internet-wide basis, so that we can trust our systems to
do things that we do not trust them to do today. However, most of the
attacks that I want to be able to trace will not require authentication
and I'm trying to suggest that we, to use a Milo Medin phrase, "harden"
the network.

Announcing "bsd games" version 1.0
----------------------------------

No unix system is truly complete without the traditional bsd games such as
battlestar, canfield, fish, fortune, hangman, mille, robots, wump, etc., etc.

So, not being able to find more than a few of these scattered around,
Andy Tefft and I (Curt Olson) have taken it upon ourselves to port the whole
collection to Linux.  

We have uploaded our initial release to the incoming directories at
tsx-11.mit.edu and sunsite.unc.edu.

They should eventually find their way to 
/pub/linux/source/usr.games/bsd-games.src.tar.gz and 
/pub/linux/binaries/usr.games/bsd-games.bin.tar.gz on tsx-11.mit.edu
and
/pub/Linux/games/[bsd-games.src.tar.gz,bsd-games.bin.tar.gz] on sunsite.unc.edu

Enclosed is the README.linux file from this distribution:

I hate to put out patches this soon after a release, but there is one
potentially major problem in pl12 which is very simple to fix..  I'm
including patches: both in plain ascii and as a uuencoded gzip file
(it's the same patch - the uuencoded one is in case there is any
newsserver that messes up whitespace).

The main patch is just the change from __get_free_page(GFP_BUFFER) into
get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL), and the two minor patches just add checks
that actually enforce the read-only nature of current file mmap'ings so
that any program that tries to do a write mapping at least will be told
that it won't work. 

I'd suggest anybody compiling pl12 should add at least the file_table.c
patch: thanks to Alexandre Julliard for noticing this one.

(NYS? Yeah, I know, it's a boring name but what the heck.)

NYS is a project developing a free (Library GPL) client-side
implementation of NIS+ (NIS version 3), YP (NIS version 2) and DNS/Hesiod
access for a number of /etc "maps" (passwd, group, shadow, hosts, services,
rpc, protocols, networks, netgroup, netmasks, ethers, bootparams, aliases,
timezone and possibly others too...). All thru a name services "switch"
ala Solaris 2 /etc/nsswitch.conf.

(Yes, I know there exists another client side implementation of YP for Linux
which I believe has been ported from 386BSD? Anyway, it's more fun to write
things from scratch and I want more functionality than just YP :-)

Current status of NYS is that the Nsswitch code is written and working
(can be improved of course, but that's a later issue), the YP and NIS+
low level access code is written. (The NIS+ code will be modified slightly
to be more call-level compatible with Suns Solaris 2 when I have time).
The YP map handling code (that parses the replies) is being worked on.
NIS+ also. But more help is always welcome...

But it would be great if someone experienced with Hesiod/DNS could help
out with the DNS part of the project.

Please get in touch with me if you're interrested and have the knowledge
so things can be coordinated.

The current sources of the project can be FTP'd from ftp.lysator.liu.se
in the directory pub/linux/NYS as (nys-0.*.tar.gz, where * is a moving
target :-)

You probably need the latest 4.4.2 libraries and Gcc 2.4.5 or later to
be able to run this code without experiencing coredumps or so.

And there exists no documentation whatsoever, so UTSL.

Hi Mark,

I've just received a copy of your undelete proposals from Remy.  They
do appear very well thought out, but a few detailed comments follow...

>> PLEASE FORWARD COPIES OF THIS MESSAGE TO ANYONE YOU FEEL IT AFFECTS OR ANYONE
>> WHO YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE COMMENT ON IT.

Yes please!

Will do...

Huh?  That's never been the Linux way - Linux is the method we use to
become experts!

>> DESIGN GOALS:

>>   - undeletion should be selectable on a per-file basis
Definitely.
>>   - undeletion should not require the user to learn extra programs

I'm not entirely sure about this; a single new 'undelete' command is
not necessarily a bad thing.
>>   - make the system administrator's job as easy as possible
Yup.
>>   - don't create any security holes or make ext2fs less stable
Number one priority here.  Absolutely.
>>   - don't interfere with ext2fs compression, ACLs, or user quotas
That's the ext2fs philosophy - lots of capability, totally integrated.

I assume you mean some top level /undeleted directory akin to
/lost+found, rather than a separate /undeleted directory in each
normal directory or for each user.

I think we have to think carefully about the overall philosophy here -
do we want undeleted files to be hidden but easily recovered, or
should it be completely user-open as you suggest?  There are arguments
on both sides.  In particular, how do you propose to resolve name
conflicts in /undeleted for multiple deletions of files with the same
name, either in the same or in different directories?  Do you propose
to record the source directory of the deleted files with each one?
Having an invisible directory of undeleted files can resolve these
questions, but the user would have to learn a new undelete tool to
access such a directory.  Heck, the user will *have* to learn at least
one new tool anyway, if only to set up the per-file and per-directory
undelete parameters.

>> FILE ATTRIBUTES:
>> 
>>   Each file should have a set of "attribute" bits.  For example,
>>   this set would contain one bit to indicate whether the file is

Done.  This is exactly the way I'm doing file marking for the
compressed filesystem, and I have redefined the flags field to be a
bitfield struct to achieve this.  There is loads of free space in that
struct for undelete flags.

We need a new program, yes; I was thinking more of 'e2set' or 'e2attr'
as a suitable name for such an ext2fs-specific utility.  However, I
don't like the idea of cluttering the kernel with fs-specific kernel
calls; much better to just hack on another ioctl() for ext2fs files.
The ioctl indirection is already there in the vfs layer.

ioctl again - the third ioctl argument can be a struct address into
which the kernel can copy results as well as read them.

Possible, although I am a trifle reluctant to polute standard GNU
tools with fs-specific code.  I would rather have a separate set of
ext2fs tools at first, and to try to integrate them into the fileutils
only after they have proven stable.

>>   mv and cp would be changed to handle the attribute bits
>>   correctly, if necessary.

Yup, as above.

>> UNDELETE DIRECTORY TABLE INODE:
>> 
>>   The purpose of the undelete directory table inode is to allow

>> 
>>   Several fields of this inode are used for special purposes:

>> 	i_mode		--> minimum uid in table
>> 	i_uid		--> maximum uid in table

>> 			    undeldir

These flags can easily be placed in the superblock, where there is
*loads* of free space.  It's much more natural for them to be there.

Now, you are proposing to have per-user undeleted directories; why not
just have a single /undeleted directory, with mode 1777?  If we
prohibit file creation in this directory (easy enough to do), then
this still lets users rename or delete (permanently) files in that
directory.  We can also easily adapt the directory scanning routines
to pass over deleted file entries beloning to other users if we really
want to.  It does increase the chances of name conflicts, but that is
going to be a problem anyway.

Secondly, what we are talking about here is basically a per-user
filesystem database.  This is exactly what we need to implement
quotas.  (The existing Linux quota patches aren't quite sufficient;
they can't see holes for a start, and they aren't designed to work
with undeleting filesystems!)  Bearing this in mind, maybe we should
consider this right now, and design a user database which is at least
capable of being easily (and compatibly) expanded to accomodate extra
information such as quotas.

We might even want to place separate real and undeleted quotas for
each user, or a combined real+undeleted quota (so that the system
could automatically purge deleted files once this is exceeded).

>>   namei.c:ext2_unlink() is the function we want to modify in order to support

Yup!

Remember to check for i_count = 1!  We don't want to make an undelete
record of files which are still in the filesystem (or do we?).

Sounds about right.

Add namespace collision to the disadvantages, and it's potentially a
big one.

>> ADVANTAGES:

>>

This latter point is applicable even if we just keep a reserved list
of deleted files.

Add an extra advantage, by the way - users can view file contents
before deciding whether to undelete or purge them.  This is a pretty
useful feature!

Definitely.  I would like to see integrated quota support here - it's
the obvious place to put it.

I like it, but I think it's worth discussing the relative merits of
the in-filesystem versus reserved-directory approaches for maintaining
the lists of deleted files.

Cheers,
 Stephen.

I'm for it, but since it involves kernel changes, it's Linus'
decision.  I would like to see ld.so included in the next libc
release, but I suppose it could wait if that's what people want.

BTW, does any of the ld.so stuff interfere with your ELF efforts?

OK, I was aware that uselib now used mmap internally, but I wasn't
aware that a uselib could be undone with munmap.  Hmm, I just looked
at sys_munmap and there is one complication.  There is no way for the
startup code to know how much memory to munmap without opening the
file and reading the header.  If it has to do that, it might as well
do the mmap directly.

Now, there is not an immediate need to unmap ld.so.  With the current
implementation, not unmapping ld.so would only waste one page per
process.  I do expect that to grow, however, when/if we try to do more
sophistocated things.

The only files I'm using are printk.c, vsprintf.c and ctype.c.  The
formatted I/O functions in libc would bring in to much excess baggage.

Ted:

I didn't expect there would be a problem.  It did have to be addressed
nevertheless.

That would work.

OK, unless I hear strong objections, that's how this first version
will work.  I have relatives coming in tonight for a couple of days,
I'll try to have a test version ready this weekend.

Subject: homework for (Ian and (Judy or Anne))

I would like to ask our customers of AOL and CompuServe to do a little
research.  Could you call your respective companies and find answers to
these questions?

1.  Does your service have a front end that will run on G+GG's
Macintosh?  (What version of MacOS are they running, anyway?)

2.  Does this front end allow one to compose while not connected to the
service, press a key (or select a menu item) to dial in, send, and
receive new mail, then read while not connected?  Ted Ts'o told me about
this feature of the CompuServe front end, and I think it would make a
big difference in cost.

3.  How can the service be reached from Boone?  A local number?  A
per-minute number?  How much would it cost?  What speeds would it
support?

4.  What is the fee structure for the kind of service G+GG would need?

I know you're all busy, but this information would really help us move
forward in getting G+GG on line.

Muchisimas gracias!
Bruce

Did this get through to the other addresses on the list?  What went
wrong locally?

Subject: homework for (Ian and (Judy or Anne))

I would like to ask our customers of AOL and CompuServe to do a little
research.  Could you call your respective companies and find answers to
these questions?

1.  Does your service have a front end that will run on G+GG's
Macintosh?  (What version of MacOS are they running, anyway?)

2.  Does this front end allow one to compose while not connected to the
service, press a key (or select a menu item) to dial in, send, and
receive new mail, then read while not connected?  Ted Ts'o told me about
this feature of the CompuServe front end, and I think it would make a
big difference in cost.

3.  How can the service be reached from Boone?  A local number?  A
per-minute number?  How much would it cost?  What speeds would it
support?

4.  What is the fee structure for the kind of service G+GG would need?

I know you're all busy, but this information would really help us move
forward in getting G+GG on line.

Muchisimas gracias!
Bruce

I agree with everyone else in saying that this is a good start. I have not
used the Mac BBS extensively from the admin end, but from a user
perspective it is an excellent system. They have the Postal Union gateway
installed and it transfers email & Usenet news (receive-only) to and from
the BCS hub via UUCP. Then the BCS Hub transfers email, etc. to the
Internet via UUCP through UUNET Technologies. All in all, the system works
quite well.

My only concern about this project is that they are underestimating the
amount of time needed to set up and maintain this system. Have they thought
about whether or not they will backup people's email? What kind of service
expectation are they going to provide? Etc, etc, etc....

I also don't know too much about the ftpd that runs on the Mac. If Dave
says that other people are using it successfully, then that's OK. I usually
believe that Unix machines are _really_ good for server-class machines,
especially since they don't crash! At least not usually! :-)

I have one final question: what's going to cost them $5000?

I'm not sure.... but I just tested Nancy's maildrop by forwarding her
the bounced mail, and it seems to work now.  Wierd....

With that kind of error, sendmail may not have sent that mail message on
to other addresses on that host (i.e., po6), but other addresses sent to
other hosts would be fine.  Given that the gilman-clan mailing list
mostly consists of outside addresses, your message should have been sent
to the other addresses.

Sorry for the long delay re: vtwm for linux.  In the sources I have
kicking around here, the changes for flex support are as attached.  They
may not support some of the weird stuff like putting vtwm tokens into

Well its something to think about in the future anyway.

It think the loading time degradation on a readdir() every time a binary needs
to be dynamically linked is too great a performance hit.

I think forever is a very strong word (like what you have to whisper when
getting married). No the cache is constantly being rebuilt.
As you mentioned the disk cache will ensure never having to perform a real
disk read until the cache is flushed. However the modification time
field in the stat structure can be queried as to when to perform a disk read
to get ldconfig to rebuild its own ld.so.cache. Even with the current
file systems linux has, the readdir() is sufficiently fast to enable a deamon
ldconfig process (very much like `update') to check and rebuild the cache on
the fly. However with NFS, bearing in mind our current 1024 rw block
implementation, it is necessary, in order to preserve file consistency across
server and clients, to have a very short lived file cache and subsequently
fairly expensive getattr calls will be required once the cache had expired.
Anyway i think this is a "far off" scenario and our priorities definetly lie
in the need to get ld.so and friends into standard distributions and onto
users disks.

David:

The configurable LD_LIBRARY_PATH is implemented by SunOS for e.g. by having
arguments to 'ldconfig' which augments the "trusted LD_LIBRARY_PATH". But yes
having this in a file for `ldconfig' to read is just as acceptable and would
save hardcoding paths into ld.so.

Full agreement there.

I think most people will accept `forward compatability' as it implies 
natural progression to greater and better things. Clearly if I create a
QMAGIC executable and distribute it thereby forcing the user to upgrade his
kernel, I am doing him a favor - even though he may not percieve downloading
30 SLS disks over a 2400 modem line as being much of a favor. Definetly
breaking `backward compatability' - i.e. not being able to run old binaries
on new kernels, and forcing recompilation will cause the greatest upsets -
however HLu has indicated that this might be imminent when (if ??) we move to
glibc-1.06 proper.

Yup this seems the way to go, way to go Eric :-)

Subject: follow-up about dinner for Brian,

Ted,
  thanks for getting back to me about the invitation for a
goodbye-to-Brian-Sliker dinner for LEM old timers.  It looks
like you returned from Europe a few days after I departed to
Europe (I left on July 26, and you sent an email reply on 
July 29).  I returned last Wednesday evening and read your
email last Thursday.  By that time, I felt it was too late 
to try changing plans (since most people had marked the date
several weeks in advance) and just left it for last Saturday
evening.  Sorry that caused a conflict for your schedule.
We would have enjoyed having you with us, and I regret 
causing you disappointment for having to miss the dinner.
  LEM is still happening every Wednesday.  Please drop in 
when you have time.  Brian has not been coming during the
summer (he spends most of his time down in Quincy, working
on his thesis at home).  We encouraged him to show up at 
least once before he leaves, just so that we can wish him
farewell and he can say farewell to us.  He said he will try
to come some time in September.  I believe that he starts his
new job down in DC early in October. 
  I hope all your work with athena and involvement with your
church in Arlington are going well and not causing too much
stress.
  Hope to see you in the not-too-distant future.

John

Barbara discussed this with me, and what she proposes is acceptable 
PROVIDED the machine has a sign on it saying that system accounting is 
turned on, that we will keep all user identities confidential, and 
advising anyone who doesn't want to be accounted to use a different 
workstation. We will need to rediscuss or discontinue the accounting 
when machines become scarce toward the end of term, if the data 
collection goes on that long.
