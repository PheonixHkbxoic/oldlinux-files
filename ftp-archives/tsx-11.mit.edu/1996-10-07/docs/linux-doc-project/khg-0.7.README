After a long hiatus, the KHG has come back to life.  However, it
will no longer be available as a paper document, and will not
(at least for the forseeable future) be available as postscript,
DVI, or any other easily printable format.  This is because it
is now interactive, on the web.  Point your browser at

and start interacting.
