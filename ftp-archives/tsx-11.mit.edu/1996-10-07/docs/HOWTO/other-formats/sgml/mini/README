This directory has the SGML source for a few mini-HOWTOs that were written
using the SGML tools.  Unless you really need the SGML source, it is highly 
recommended that you use the preformatted versions of the HOWTOs.  The SGML 
tools can be found in /pub/Linux/utils/text.

The HOWTO-INDEX provides an overview and index of the HOWTOs.
See COPYRIGHT for a description of the HOWTO copyright license.

You can also browse the HOWTOs at the URL:

Please contact Greg Hankins (the HOWTO coordinator) via email at
gregh@sunsite.unc.edu, with any questions or comments.
