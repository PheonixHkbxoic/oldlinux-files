       ATDISK2 DIFFS

  The development of atdisk2 has stopped. It has been successfully
  merged into the ide-x.x driver, which is included in Linux 1.1.76
  and upwards. Kernel support for two controllers/interfaces is finally
  in the kernel!

  [Delman 3-Jan-95]

The old atdisk patches may be found in the attic, for those who have
old kernels.  /pub/linux/attic/BETA/atdisk{.old}  [-mkj]
