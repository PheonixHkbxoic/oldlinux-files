This directory contains:

nfs-server-2.0.tar.gz

	This is the new version of the user-space NFS server
	for Linux.  It is now very portable and should run with
	a little work on about any Unix with RPC.

	Please send feedback to me, jrs@world.std.com.

rpc-0.9.tar.Z
rpc-0.9.README

	This is the latest version of the RPC support programs
	and files for Linux.  Too much has changed to detail
	the features here.  Please read the README file.
	This distribution is a little dated now.

nfs-client-*

	All the client code is in the Linux kernel proper.
