	Linux -- The free 386 Un*x clone is here!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to TSX-11's Linux FTP site!

Directory structure:

	docs		documentation (such as it is)

	docs/LDP	Linux Documentation Project work.  A series of
			books on Linux, at various stages of completion.

	sources		sources to Linux, broken down by whether system
			sources (including libc.a), sources to system
			programs, sources to usr.bin, and library sources.

	binaries	various binaries for Linux
			(use the tar and compress programs found on the 
			root disk or in binaries/usr.bin to unpack these)

	packages	contains packaged programs, like GCC, Ada, OI,
			fortran, emacs, and others

	ALPHA		contains software that is not yet considered stable
			by its author(s)

	BETA		software that is considered a little better
			by its author(s)

	patches		contains patches to Linux (typically, but not always,
			patches to the system sources, such as patches to
			add new features to the kernel). Check ALPHA and
			BETA for many newer patches; these are mostly old.

	ports		contains patches to make other programs compile on
			a Linux system

	mail-archive	contains an archive of the Linux-Activsts mailing
			list

	info		contains various useful informational files which
			Linux hackers may find useful

	attic		contains old version of programs.

TSX-11 does not yet have a mail server --- I'm working on it....

If you need mail service, please try the mail server available at
sunsite.unc.edu.  Mail ftpmail@sunsite.unc.edu for more information.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To upload stuff --- please use the directory /incoming.  It is
world-writable, but not world-readable, so you (or anybody else) will
not be able to see stuff which you drop there until we move it to the
proper place the directory hierarchy.  

Please send mail to ftp-linux@tsx-11.mit.edu after you leave something
there, so we can pick it up as soon as possible.  Get and read the file
/incoming/README for more *important* information on how to submit files
to the tsx-11 archive.  *REALLY, please do this*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The email address for digests of comp.os.linux.* is

	linux-activists@news-digests.mit.edu

Anything mailed to this address will be posted to the appropriate
newsgroup.

All administrative requests (subscriptions/unsubscriptions/etc) MUST
go to the administrative address:

	linux-activists-request@news-digests.mit.edu

See below for what happens if you ignore this address :-)

Also, please be prepared for a bit of a wait when you use this
service, as the administrator is quite busy right now.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Linux mailing list addresses:

The new mail server for the Linux lists is majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu

Send an email to majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu with the single word
help
in the body of the message.  Do not put the word help in the subject,
put it in the body of the message.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The current status of the linux kernel can be obtained by using 
"finger torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi"

This status report is usually fairly long, so you might want to do
"finger torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi | more"
