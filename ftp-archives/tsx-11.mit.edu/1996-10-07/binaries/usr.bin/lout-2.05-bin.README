This is Basser Lout version 2.05, by Jeffrey Kingston <jeff@cs.su.oz.au>.

To install it, delete /usr/local/bin/lout and /usr/local/lib/lout* and
untar the tarfile in the root directory.

I ftp'd it from cs.su.oz.au and compiled it straight out of the box.
It is set up to both understand and produce ISO8859 8-bit national
characters.

It is covered by the GNU General Public Licence - a copy is enclosed
in the tarfile.

If you want to install it you'll need 3.85Mb of free space - less if
you can live without having the formatted copies of the manuals lying
around (that'll save you maybe 1.7Mb - after installation, cd to
/usr/local/lib/lout.doc and delete */*.ps).

The sources are available at any comp.sources.misc archive site - it
was posted there shortly after I compiled it, or from cs.su.oz.au.

Below is my PGP2 digital signature of the *uncompressed* tarfile,
lout-2.05-bin.tar.
