EiffelGraph can be used to visualize the structure of Eiffel 3 
software. It produces a graph description that can be viewed with
packages like VCG (freely available form ftp.cs.uni-sb.de in 
/pub/graphics/vcg) or Edge.

Usage: EiffelGraph [-v] [-i] [-u] [sourcefiles]

The default action is to produce a graph that visualizes the
inheritance and usage relations found in the sourcefiles.

Options:
	-v	show version and author
	-i	don't include inheritance relations
	-u	don't include usage relations

The output is always sent to stdout. Use it as
EiffelGraph *.e > gr1.vcg

Interitance from ANY is always reported. To remove it (to get a
more readable graph) use grep eg.
EiffelGrapg *.e | grep -v any > gr2.vcg

The usage relation doesn't take dynamic binding into account
and therefor is not of too much use. It reads the sourcefiles
and lists the types of all features. It doesn't even try to
catch any polimorph assignments and their results. Also it
doesn't look at the types of parameters passed to features or
at local declarations.
(This is due to a restriction in the parser, it might 
change in the future.)

EiffelGraph is passed on a fuzzy parser that is intended to 
be the back-end of an Eiffel browser. It tries to extract as
much information as possible from the source code and tries
to ignore all the errors that might be in the source code.

The parser is still pretty new, so I'm very much interested
in source fragments that it is _not_ able to parse correctly.

To be compatible with edge I had to remove a VCG feature that
allowed a view-time selection of what relations to show. 
This may return as commandline option in a later version.

EiffelGraph is distributed as binary only at this point in time.
Binaries are available for Linux and SunOS 4.x.
