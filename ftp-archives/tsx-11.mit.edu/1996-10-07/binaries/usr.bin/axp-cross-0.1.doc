INTRODUCTION

This is a Linux/i386 -> Linux/axp cross compiler for the Linux Kernel
only.  You will have to get the user libraries and header files if you
want to cross compile user programs.

The reason for producing this is to allow people doing kernel development
on i386 machines to make sure that their changes will at least compile
under Linux/axp.  I hope to have a Linux/Sparc cross compiler done soon
so it will be possible to test on 3 architectures.

INSTALLATION

Unpacking this archive should have generated 2 files:
	README              -> This file
	compiler-bin.tar.gz -> The cross compiler
    
To install simply do:

	su
	cd /
	tar xzvf compiler-bin.tar.gz

The cross compiler will be installed under /usr/local/alpha-dec-linux and
/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/alpha-dec-linux

COMPILING

To compile kernel a recent 1.3.XX kernel, you must supply ARCH and
CROSS_COMPILE arguments to the make command.  Here is a complete example:

	cd /usr/src/linux
	make clean
	make ARCH=alpha CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/local/alpha-dec-linux/bin/ config
	make ARCH=alpha CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/local/alpha-dec-linux/bin/ dep
	make ARCH=alpha CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/local/alpha-dec-linux/bin/ 

**NOTE** Compiling the de4x5.c file with optimization will cause a
         segmentation Violation.  To avoid this, do not configure the
	 de4x5 network driver.
