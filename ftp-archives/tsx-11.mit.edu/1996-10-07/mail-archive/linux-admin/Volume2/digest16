Does anyone have XFree86 working with a WD90C33?  I have a 486dx2/50
with a Rocket MultiFunction adapter and a WD90C33 video chip.  I have
Linux installed by I can't get X to run.

I am sure that someone must have this working (or at least be working
on it).  After all, if someone can get the Diamond Stealth to work,
then the WD90C33 should not be too difficult.

If no one is working on this, can someone give me an idea where to
start?

Yes.  Create a custom kernel with the Intel Ether Express driver
enabled (see Ethernet-HOWTO and NET-2-HOWTO).  Create a Slackware boot
disk (see slackware/kernels/README.NOW).  After you install Linux, you
have to install the custom kernel on the hard disk or make a new one.

Your Script is'nt secure enough. Someone who is logged on the same 
Host, where you want to start the X-Server can easely obtain time
(if the time is not correct enough he can guess it with several tries)
and $$ by observing your processes with ps. Then he can generate with
a similiar script the right MAGIC-COOKIE.

If you're using the newer Conner Backup Basics (DOS or MS-Windows)

Check out the XFree86 report in c.o.l.announce.
As for version 2.1 you can hope to get accelerated support for the following
cards from 'man XF86_SVGA' :

       Accelerated support is included for  most  of  the  Cirrus
       chipsets,  and  for  the Western Digital WD90C31 chipsets.
       Accelerated support for the ET4000/W32 is NOT  yet  imple-

S3, Mach 8 & 32 cards are also supported.

You already answerd that :-)
In comparison it is better to compress first, and tar then.
This way a bit error only messes up one file, but tar can recover on the 
next header. If you compress the resulting .tar file, a bit error will
mess up the rest of the archive.

OTOH, I have yet to see a messed up .tgz or .tar.z file (knock on wood).

There you have it.

Let me through in my two cents (which is another reason that I run Linux 
;-) beside I love it).

It would seem to me that it would be a case by case basis as to what is
better maybe. I would seem to me that there would be little difference if
the files were binary, tar then gzip would be slightly better maybe. 
However, if the files were text, maybe it would be better to tar then
gzip. Wouldn't you get better rtl lz compression that way? It probably
doesn't make that big of a difference anyways. Just a rambling thought.
