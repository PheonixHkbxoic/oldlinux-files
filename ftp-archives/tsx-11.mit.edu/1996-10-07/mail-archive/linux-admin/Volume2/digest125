Subject: Linux and Adaptec 1542 CF
Date: 30 Sep 1994 14:49:38 GMT


I want to install LINUX for the first time. I have a NEC 3xp-CD-ROM connected
to the PC over a parallel-SCSI-Adapter (Trantor 338) and SCSIWorks-Software.
Linux does not seem to recognize the CD-ROM-reader, I think. I have tried
a PCMCIA-SCSI-Adapter (Bus Toaster from New Media with CorelSCSI II-Software) 
without success. So I think I have to buy a "real" SCSI-adapter for my ISA-
Board and want to try the ADAPTEC 1542 CF. Do I need their software (EZ-SCSI),
too or just the card? Can I use the Corel-Software? Any further problems to be
expected caused by the NEC-MultiSpin3xp in this combination?
Thank you in advance for your help for a Linux beginner

Subject: Keyboard mapping under X
Date: 30 Sep 1994 14:59:58 GMT

Recently I attempted to remap my function keys to contain
character strings follow by ^M so that I could execute
certain shell commands in an xterm by just hitting a function
key.

I failed!!!!

I first attempted to work with the /etc/termcap entries but
soon realized it was hopeless because X was intercepting the
keystrokes and mapping them per some internal table.

I tried to alter these mappings using "xmodmap" but as far as
I can tell this tool is only useful to remap modifiers (as the
name implies) like Alt, Control, Shift, & Tab.
I was able to map F1 to "a", a single character, but it seemed
to die on anything greater than 1 in length.

Can someone who has done this please give me a hand!

Yesterday I freed up a lot of diskspace and compiled gcc 2.6.0 - it
works nice, and I compiled kernel 1.1.51 without a hitch.

In fact - there had be one warning in the msdos-filesystem-section:
namei.c: In function `msdos_format_name':
namei.c:43: warning: overflow in implicit constant conversion

but I have not had any malfunction yet. 

My c++ project worked after correcting some mistakes the old g++ missed...

Am I to expect problems? If not, why is gcc 2.6 not the official version yet?

cua1 and ttyS1 refer to the same device, so if one is in use you probably
do not want to bother the other one.  I'm not sure what the advantage of
having two nodes for the same device is, but I've gotten by with using ttyS1
for everything, and ignoring cua1 almost entirely.  I used to run uugetty_ps in
ringback mode, and now run another ringback program on the line, and also run
kermit and term over the same line.  You may have luck running uugetty_ps on
/dev/ttyS1, too.

Hmm. Insofar as it deals with how to set things up with a Linux
package, here is probably good enough.

However, the matter has already been taken up at comp.text.tex.

As I remember, it is not a bug it's a feature, point being that
since 8-bit input is non-standardized, it is disabled by default
to ensure document portability. You need to employ a LaTeX2e
'package' to enable it for the character set in question. (Don't
argue with *me* on the matter!).

Anyway, specifically for the NTeX package, there ought to be a
Latin1 package included.  If not (haven't gotten around to play
with it myself), then it should be written (or fetched) and added
to the distribution.

I was talking to the local Cisco rep today, and they've got an option
(available at purchase) where you can add 8 or 16 asynch ports
(115kbps each) to their 2500 or 4000 series routers for about $500 or
$1000 respectively. It's something new. It'll support terminal
emulation, SLIP/CSLIP/PPP, IPX/ IPXCP, AARP (Mac remote), Xremote,
DEC's protocol (forgot the name).  Pretty good deal if you're planning
on buying one of their routers.  It supports telnet/rlogin plus a
bunch of other stuff. I don't know much about it, maybe someone else
does?

Look at "man loadkeys" for info.

'loadkeys /usr/lib/kbd/keytables/uk.map'

should do the trick (and should have been planted by the SlackWare

#!/bin/sh
echo 'Loading keyboard map "uk.map"...'
/usr/bin/loadkeys /usr/lib/kbd/keytables/uk.map
 
and, near the end of my /etc/rc.d/rc.local, the line

sh /etc/rc.d/rc.keymap

to invoke it.

I don't understand. Why don't you want the modem to pick up the phone
when Linux has crashed? If this happens, the calling program will
eventually give up and hang up. At some time after that, the 
'called' modem will also give up and hang up. If you want to
use the phone for other purposes when Linux is down, switch the
modem off.

As an aside, Linux machines _don't_ crash every now and then. I have
one set up here as a dial-in gateway. Some days, we have horrendous
power outages, (like 5 a day !), and Linux just comes bouncing
back every time ...

BTW, setting AA on gets the dial-in system to work. If you have
a better idea, I'm always glad to learn something new.

Date: 30 Sep 1994 15:57:24 GMT

I'm trying to install lilo onto the following system:  Insight 486-66
EISA/VLB w/16 MB RAM, Micropolis 2217 (1.7GB) HD, NEC 3Xi CD-ROM drive,
Hercules Dynamite Pro VLB w/2MB (or a #9GXE64Pro w/2MB), and a BusLogic
445s VLB SCSI controller.

I just got the Yggdrasil Fall '94 Linux CD and went through the basic
installation.

The disk is partitioned as follows:  The first 500 MB is active and set to
be the primary DOS partition, the next 530 MB is set to be the root
partition for Linux, and the remainder has yet to be set.  I setup the
partitioning about six months ago using the DOS v6.2 fdisk command.  It
seems that during installation using Yggdrasil that the cfdisk program
accepted my earlier settings but then complained about differences in the
logical and physical mappings and it also bitched about the fact that the
first partition didn't end on a cylinder boundary.

The BusLogic 445s has a jumper set on the board that specifies support for
DOS drives larger than 1.0 GB.  Also, everything works fine from DOS.

The installation program installs LILO onto the master boot record with no
complaints but upon reboot all that gets displayed is "LI" and then it just
hangs.

The LILO docs says that this indicates that the first stage boot loader was
able to load the second stage loader but was unable to execute it.  It
mentions that this is either a geometry problem or has been caused by
moving '/boot/boo.b' without running the map installer (whatever that means
:-).

So, before I go and really start whacking on my disk (I already backed
everything up :-), does anyone know if this problem is a) due to what
cfdisk complained about in the partition table b) the jumper on the
BusLogic 445s about large DOS disks c) both or d) something else?

Thanks!

There's a NET-2-FAQ.

There's a Network Administration Guide.

There's stuff in /usr/lib/ppp, once you get the PPP executables.

The sun is trying to do 8K NFS. Linux prior to about 1.1.40 or so doesn't
do 8K NFS correctly (in earlier kernels at all). Specify
rsize=1024,wsize=1024 as options or better still get a 1.1.51 kernel, the 
floppy disk patch and Florians excellent NFS speedup patch and you'll be
a much happier man.

Use edd with the tpqic package off ftp.funet.fi (the one with qiconfig etc)
that is a dd that is two processes and properly double buffering specially
for jobs like tape - With a 1Mb buffer it makes even NFS backups quite
happy.
