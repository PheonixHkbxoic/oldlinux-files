        Post 1.1.46 kernels seem to override the > 1GB hard drive switch.
If I run fdisk with 1.1.38 and install linux, it won't run after
a few boots of 1.1.51.  And vice versa.  After messing up my linux
boxes' hard drives several times, I traced it down to the changes
around the 1.1.46 kernel. 
        The partition tables seem to be incompatible.  I'm out of my
league as far as the specifics, but I can say that it changes the
cyl/hd/sec specifications.  So don't casually upgrade...  I had to
reformat 2 systems...
        The were good changes though, so I'm not complaining, just
warning people.

Finger is secure. The very old rlogind/telnetd had a bug as did lpd but
thats currently fixed. Oh and someone has just fixed portmap if you are
doing loopback nfs mounts.

If you are using a FSSTND (filesystem standard) compliant (or
reasonably close) distribution, then it is relatively easy to split up
the system.

From my own experience, I might suggest using one or more of the
following directories as mount points for partitions:

        /
        /home           - or the local equivalent(s)
        /usr
        /usr/X11        - or the local equivalent(s)
        /usr/local      - or the local equivalent(s)
        /usr/src
        /var            - or a /var subdirectory if any tend to be large
        swap

I've also found it nice to have a second root partition, but that's
because I'm slightly paranoid and I often test Linux distribution
installation procedures.  (Thus, I don't trash my system every time.)

I prefer to avoid the use of extended partitions for aesthetic
reasons, as many people do.

I'd also advise making certain that the system administrator is able
to work comfortably with a (compact) editor available in the root
partition.  `pico' and `vi' are decent choices.  The first, because it
is very easy to use, and the second, because it is documented in every
Unix book written in the last decade, or so it seems.  (This seems to
be an area that hampers many people in an emergency.)

Also, if root's home directory is situated on a separate /home
partition, make certain that your `login' program will still allow the
root account to login without a home directory.  (This shouldn't be a
problem on most Linux systems.)  Also be wary of where login shells
lie, if root's login shell is in /usr/local/bin, then it might be
awkward when /usr/local crashes.  (I don't think `login' protects
against this, as it does for missing home directories, but I haven't
exactly checked either.)

Don't try to make the root partition too small or you may regret it
later, especially if /tmp is situated on it and not linked to /var or
somewhere else.  The same advice goes for any volatile partition.

Make certain that your root partition, including /boot and the kernel
image, is situated completely below cylinder 1024.  There is a similar
provision that your last partition must begin below 1024, but that may
only apply to IDE drives -- I can't recall for certain.

My last point is that there some reasoning you should do before you
repartition.  If you are only a single user system, do whatever works
for you.  If you are running a large, multiple user system, work to
keep the machine running in a capable state with as little downtime as
possible.

        Recompile the kernel with:   "PC/TCP compability mode ON"

        Actual problem is closely related, but that (intermediate)

Subject: Development Idea: Kernel TOC
Date: 3 Oct 1994 17:04:22 GMT

This idea surfaced from my numerous kernel compiles... Please forgive if such a
thing does exist, but wouldn't it be handy to include with the kernel source a
table of contents (TOC) explaining the drivers, file systems, etc.<?>

For example:

Within the General Setup of you kernel configuration, you'll find the following:

CONFIG_MATH_EMULATION 

Selecting this option will include a math-emulator in your kernel.  If you have 
a math coprocessor installed on your computer, you probably don't need this.  
Blah, blah... 

The source for this option is in the directory /usr/src/linux/drivers/FPU-emu

CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HD 

This option is for something or other.  Which is why I'd like to see a kernel TOC.

I'll be willing to help put one together.  I'll need a fair amount of assistance 
from someone knowledgable with the kernel contents.  

Please forgive my ignorance if such a thing already exists.  If so, where?

Hi everyone,

I have a problem with networking my Linux box.  I have Yddrasil Summer 94
Linux 1.1.0 #84 with NET-2 running.  I have set up my static route table with
local ip address of 128.178.10.1 and 128.178.10.2 for my Linux boxes with
netmask 255.255.255.0 and broadcast addr 128.178.10.255. The system is
on the same datalink.  My local network is 128.178.10.0.  My first
problem is "arp -a" returns nothing and when I execute "netstat -rn" I got
the error "route: unsupported address family 2560 !".  Any ideas ?  My 
ifconfig shows that my NIC card is running with arp up as configured.
Moreover, my xserver can't seem to run remote x-clients.  I keep getting
the message "can connect to calvin:0.0".  Thanks in advance for any advice.

It has two problems

1.      Its somewhat slow as it switches all the frames in and out of user
mode.

2.      The license is extremely restrictive and requires you give dec any
changes you make etc. That prevents anyone putting it into the Linux kernel
code. There is another as yet more limited but much faster IP firewall
codeset in ALPHA test (ipfirewall-x.y.tar.gz on sunsite). This looks
promising and I sent the authors a long list of suggested changes as in the
end I'd like to put it into the kernel code as yet another config option.

You need to make an 'Xt' translation table.  See the man page on xterm
for more info.  One thing:  The resource that you are going to make is
a single, multi-line resource.  When I tried to make a rather large
table, I ran into a problem with too many lines being concatentated by
cpp.  cpp Seemed to drop off lines past 20 or so (xrdb -merge adds the
resources, and it runs cpp, the C pre-processor).  So, when working
with large tables, use xrdb -query to make sure what is being stored on
the X Server is what is in the file.  I got around the problem by making
very long lines.

On the format for a translation table:  I bought a summary reference
on X that is very valuable for this type of info.  I would write
more, but all my references (and system) are at home.  The title
might be 'X in a Nutshell'?

Well, I thought I had ftape working, but I guess I was wrong.  I'm running
Linux kernel version 1.0.9 and ftape version 1.13b patched for the conner bug
and compiled with the -DCONNER_BUG flag.

When I finally got done compiling, I used tar to backup my drive.  It went
through several hundred files, and then suddenly stopped with an I/O error
writing to the device.

I'm assuming that its a bad sector on the tape, since I was able to verify
everything up to that point, but how do I confirm this and mark the sector as
bad so I can continue?

Hello

        I have compiled xmeter on my system, and it works for the most part (had
to get the librpcsvc.a file, but other than that, compile was easy).  My problem
is that I cannot get xmeter to watch any network stats on my local machine.  I am
runing SLIP (dip) , but I should still be able to watch the packets in and out
(right??!!??) .  I mean, they are still packets, and inetd doesn't care about
what kind of interface it is talking to.

        Xmeter watches the network traffic on all of the other machines I look at
but not mine :(.

        What is wrong?  I have rstatd running, do I need other rpc daemons as
well?  The xmeter man page says it gets its info from rstat...doesn't mention any
others.

        Any Help would be appreciated....

Maybe he hangs up and expects the other end to be
'dial-on-demand'. Alas the Linux implementation doesn't offer that
(yet). Many PPP implementations hang up after a few minutes silence,
but keep the logical network up; then when you want to send a packet
again they dial and make connection again transparently.

Especially when ISDN is getting through with its very fast dialing and
one second resolution billing dial-on-demand becomes a must for PPP.

Did you do a re-compile of the kernel, and did it actually re-compile
the mcd.c file. If not, touch the mcd.c file and re-compile the kernel
again. With the next reboot, you should be able to use you CD-ROM

Generally, it does fix the problem. But not for aumix :) Either it
relies on bugs in the (old) version of ncurses that the author of
aumix used, or new bugs ones were introduced in newer versions of
ncurses (I believe the latter). The screen is quite messed up with
1.8.5.

I have had much trouble with colors in ncurses 1.8.5. The only way I
can get reasonably sure not to trigger a bug is to call refresh()
before changing color/attributes (this shouldn't be necessary - one
refresh after all changes ought to be enough). Scrolling regions with
colorized characters is something I never got to work, there was
always some characters that changed colors during the scrolling. I
sent a bugreport (with a short program to show the problem) to Zeyd
about a month ago, but got no reply (the reason could be a faulty
mail-daemon or an overworked Zeyd :-)

Slightly off subject: Does the linux-console have support for turning
the cursor on and off? I am updating the screen often (several
times/second) and it's a bit annoying having the cursor flashing all
over the screen.
