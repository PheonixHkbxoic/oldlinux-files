yeah, but all the binaries and such go in /usr under that setup, not in root
like you have it.  this is the df from my install, based on Slackware 2.0.1,
with most options installed (and lots added by me):

Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
/dev/hdb1              10213    4468     5218     46%   /
/dev/hdb3             178598  156374    13001     92%   /usr
/dev/hdb5              19974   14086     4857     74%   /var
/dev/hdb6              15095      20    14296      0%   /tmp
/dev/hdb7              10213    1250     8436     13%   /home
/dev/hdb8             233229  130497    90688     59%   /usr/local

i find that its good to keep thing as seperated as possible, namely its easier
to upgrade (just don't touch /usr/local and keep a copy of /etc), and if one
filesystem gets corrupted, it doesnt ditch your whole install.

>Again, I think your choice of root partition size is by far too small.

like i said, its generally a bad idea to keep everything in root.

This is regarding my earlier post about the possibilty 
of making an .rhosts file in the bin directory. 

This wasn't my idea - a friend of mine told me that he 
can crack my linux box in three minutes.  I gave him an account and
said "Go for it!".  Three minutes later he became bin.  
Unfortunately, I cannot find out how it was done... 

Now, here is the .bash_history file.  Can someone guess what 
is in the xxx file? This user did not have the write rights to 
/bin (as I thought earlier) , so there is some kind of a trick 
in the xxx script... 

The user's name has been replaced with "username".

The resulting .rhosts looked like this (I wonder what the zeros mean):

localhost username 0
b 0 0

The following is the TRUE .bash_history file with MY comments preceeded by #

less < /etc/inetd.conf
less < /etc/hosts.deny
finger root
cd /root
ls -la
cd /
ls -la
cd /var/tmp

I bet what's happening is that you're using xon/xoff instead of hardware
handshaking. Easy enough to fix. Do the following

setserial /dev/cua0 spd_vhi
(or whatever serial port you're using) This sets speed to 115Kbps. I know.
You have trouble getting it to work at 38.4Kbps. Bear with me.

stty crtscts -ixon -ixoff < /dev/cua0
This turns hardware handshaking on and xon/xoff off.

Now run kermit or some such program and set the modem to use a fixed DTE
rate, use hardware flow control and use V.42bis compression. On my
USRobotics modem the commands are as follows :

AT &B1&H1&K3&W

Now try it. Dollars to donuts it'll work alot better. You can make the
settings permanent by adding those lines to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local file. It
should work in rc.serial, but for some reason that doesn't seem to do it on
my box.

If you only want one small drive, it doesn't matter.

If you want multiple drives, large/fast drives, etc, 
SCSI is the unquestionable winner.

That's something you'll have to decide for yourself.  Depending on your 
immediate and future requirements, the cost may be negligible (NCR boards run 
about $70, PCI only, closeout Ultrastor 34F boards about $90), or in the 
neighborhood of $200-$300.

>How about speed?

1.  With a reasonable host adapter and driver software, you can sustain
        the sum of the transfer rates of your drives rather than the 
        average as with IDE (assuming you haven't run into a bottleneck
        somewhere else - an i486-66 seems to utilize about 10%  of the 
        available CPU cycles per megabyte per second of transfer rate,
        fast SCSI-II is only good to 8-10M/sec, ISA only works to about 
        5M/sec).

2.  With a reasonable host adapter, driver, and drives, you can 
        sustain about 75% of head rate on reading (through 
        the filesystem), and close to 100% writing (again,
        through the filesystem), with the above mentioned limits
        applying.

        With modern multi-gigabyte drives, I've seen this work
        out to be to be 3+M/sec and 4+M/sec through the filesystem.

        Smaller drives will be in the 1-2M/sec range.

3.  CPU utilization on my system works out to be about 1/3 
        as much to run roughly similar SCSI drives on a busmastering
        SCSI controller (NCR53c810) versus IDE drives.

400K and 800K Mac floppies used variable-speed recording, with more
sectors on the outer tracks.  It's actually possible to read and write
such disks without a variable-speed disk drive -- you use a variable
speed controller instead.  The Copy II Deluxe Option Board that Central
Point Software used to sell was capable of this trick, as was the
Spectre GCR add-on for the Atari ST.

1.44MB Mac floppies use IBM-style fixed-speed MFM recording, but still 
use a Mac-style HFS directory structure, so you can't read them on a PC 
without special software.  PC-compatible 720K and 1.44MB floppies 
written by a Mac use MFM recording and a standard DOS directory and FAT.

Rumor has it that future Mac models will drop the variable speed disk
drives, so they won't be able to read old Mac floppies.  They're also
going to drop the auto-eject mechanism.  (Basically, they're planning
to use standard IBM-style floppy drives; because of the economies of
scale, those drives are significantly less expensive.)

If there is any Linux software to read Macintosh disks, I would expect
it to only be able to read the 1.44MB ones, which can be easily read
by a standard IBM-compatible floppy controller.

If all you're going to do is add another drive, stay IDE.  There really
isn't any speed difference between them anymore.  You'll hear people
scream that when they updated to SCSI, things got faster.  But, they're
probably comparing an older IDE drive with a new VLB SCSI card.  I
recently added a SCSI drive.  I now have a 500MB IDE drive, and a 1GB
SCSI-2 drive.  I have a SCSI-2 ISA controller, and enhanced IDE
controller.  The SCSI drive has a faster spin rate, lower access time,
higher transfer rate (it's newer), but the IDE drive outperforms the
SCSI drive by about 150K/sec.

However, if you want to have more than 2 hard drives, or a CD-ROM, go
SCSI.  Keep in mind, that most SCSI cards have BIOS on them that scan
the drive chain everytime you reboot (which is necessary for SCSI HDs).
It usually takes 5-30 seconds for the card to do this, and you're
sitting there waiting the whole time.  If you're using DOS, you'll need
to load several device drivers to ASPI, int 13, CAM, etc support eating
up conventional memory.

I bought SCSI for the CD-ROM, and disabled the bios on the card.  I
purchased a SCSI hd because I thought they were faster for multitasking.
This hasn't proved to be so.

One more thing, if you do SCSI and end up having an IDE drive and a SCSI
drive, don't forget the LEDs.  You probably have one LED on the case for
a hard drive and it's connected to the IDE card.  The SCSI card will
have a connector too. You shouldn't connect them together (it'll burn
up the LED in time).  I had to drill a new hole in the case, buy a 3V LED
from radio shack, beg for a connector from a computer store, and install
a new LED myself.

the plp replacement printing system (on ftp.iona.ie) is a reverse-engineered
version of Berkeley's system, with many enhancements, including support of
printers with their own TCP/IP interfaces.

it compiles and runs under linux.

linux bootp/tftp should be sufficient to boot these printers.  the only problem
you will run into is that HP only distributes binaries for its printer
utlities, so their "JetAdmin" config program will not work under Linux (they
only give out Sun & HP versions)... however with plp, you can still communicate
with the printers, so you'd just have to send the postscript commands yourself
to configure it remotely.

You might have to boot Linux from floppy (e.g. an installation disk)

Don't wait because of that!  I spent this past weekend customizing fvwm

a bit), then v3.1 came out Monday, and I just installed it in the new directory
and am still running fvwm off the old directories with the old shared libs.
I'll recompile it to use X11R6 one of these days, but not today. :)

Of course, everything still works, but on my 8Mb RAM machine,
the old clients loading the old libs, the new ones using the

RAM.

Since I cant't spend months recompiling all the programs installed,
