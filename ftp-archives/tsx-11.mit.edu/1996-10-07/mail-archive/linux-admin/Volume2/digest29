This is obviously wrong. I think you will find that the local mailer that 
your system uses for delivering mail (defined as 'Mlocal' in sendmail.cf if 
you are running sendmail) is setgid guest instead of setgid mail as it 
should be. As you see, the actual directory /var/spool/mail is set group 
mail (as it should be); everything within it should be group mail too.

Do a "chgrp mail <binary filename>" to reset the local mailer to the 
appropriate group. Then you will need to reset the gid again (chmod g+s 
<binary filename>).

        Hi All!
 
        I'm trying to use a 3200 bpi tape for reading a backup from 
a Nixdorf mainframe , and I've got a TL5212 Overland Data tape, controlled
by a Peltec controller board. I've got DOS drivers, but I have nothing for
UNIX. Does anybody know where to find drivers for SCO or LINUX?
 
                Thanks in advance!!

The reason for this was that I deleted with dos fdisk a logical D disk from 
dos ext partition where linux partitions also are. The operation clearly
removed some linux pointers, too, and now linux boot can not find the
linux partitions. How can I recover?

Having multiple accounts with the same uid and different names are bound to
cause trouble. Some programs may use other methods besides getuid() to
figure out who you are. $LOGNAME. getlogin(), who knows what they might
return.

I presume the reason you are doing this is you want multiple root users
with different passwords so you can revoke one's access at some time
without the others having to change password. I can't see why this is
necessary. Do your root users change so frequently that it's aproblem? Why
not just have one root account and let the people all use 'su'?

If you must have multiple users, could you not put them all in one group
(eg wheel) and then have a setuid root shell that is only executable by
group wheel. I'm sure this opens up a security hole but probably nothing
worse than you're already faced with.

Yes, I know about deliver and procmail -- and am using procmail myself for
the MDA from sendmail but I just installed INN and it uses 'mail' to send
status messages. There must be something I can install that will make this
work.

I'd appreciate a solution, INN isn't the only program expecting a real
'mail' program and not a link to procmail.

I converted it to Postscript (with XV, I think) and tried to
print it with ghostscript, but I don't know if the PS-File is
greyscale or my filter allows only to print black & white.
I used the standard-filter for Deskjet. How must I setup the

This doesn't exactly belong here, but my DNS won't let me get mail so
I've been lazy about setting up my mailer.  But I won't give up trn

According to the man page, kterm assumes the zenkaku characters are
twice as wide as hankaku.  What is probably happening is that your app
is double-counting zenkaku characters (ie, counting each byte once).
Thus, if you try to backspace over a kanji, it backs up one byte and
transmits a backspace.  kterm backs up over the kanji.  Now your app
is in the middle of a kanji, and the display gets munged.  backspace
again, you are now at a 2-byte character boundary, so redisplay should
give the correct display (sort of) but another backspace is
transmitted and your cursor position is wrong.
    The escape sequences probably aren't going to help keep a correct
count, either.
    If this is true, you're going to have to rewrite your app.

>Straight display works fine, but when you move the cursor

Does it matter whether it's the mouse or the arrow keys?  Presumably
you're app will still get confused when kterm tells it the cursor
position, but if you're really really lucky....

If you have JLE for the Sun, my man page seems to say that the JLE
provides curses with international extensions.  Thus you wouldn't need
pcurses.  Otherwise, pcurses is PDS, I believe, go ahead and port it.

My shell script for converting *.ps to HP Deskjet printer files looks like this:
(gs=ghostscript, version 2.61)

file /usr/local/bin/ps2dj:
---snip---
gs -q -dNOPAUSE -sPAPERSIZE=a4 -sDEVICE=cdj550 -sOutputFile=$2 $1  /usr/lib/ghostscript/quit.ps
---snip---

Usage: 
a) "ps2dj *.ps *.prn"
b) "lpr -Plpdj *.prn"

Hope this helps,
