The real problem is that there are about 12 different kinds of
Logitech 3 button mice.  That is why so many different folks are
giving good but conflicting advice.  So I thought I would add
mine as well :-)

Start off by looking at the bottom of your mouse, it won't mind.
Find the Model Number (M/N: _________) and the country it came
from.  You can count on people that quote the same MN and country
as you have to have the config setup you need.  Others may also 
be right but you can't be sure.

It seems that Logitech has started using software under DOS/Windows
on some of its mice to get 3 button input out of mice that X thinks 
are 2 buttons.


Use the following steps to get things working.

1) Try Microsoft without Emulate3Buttons.

2) If the mouse seems to move OK but the middle button does not work,
   add the Emulate3Button switch and you are set.

3) If the mouse move strangely, try using Logitech, still without the
   Emulate3Buttons.

4) Same as before on step 2.

5) Try MouseMan with and without Emulate3Buttons.

Good luck.  I found that the 'First Mouse' (about $20 at Egghead) 
works fine and is a true 3 button mouse (i.e. I don't have to use
the Emulate3Buttons).  Many of the expensive mice are 2 button 
mice in 3 button clothes.

We might want to start a Logitech mouse matrix for new users.

        Since I have installed Slackware 1.2 commands like 'w' and
        'talk' haven't worked. Both w programs (bassman and procps)
        say 'bad data in /etc/utmp'. I have tried to fix the problem by
        deleting the file /etc/utmp with no success.

        Either these programs try to read wrong format or some
        of those programs writing /etc/utmp are corrupting the data.

        What exactly is causing the problem?

Date: 18 Oct 1994 14:22:14 GMT

Please Help me figure out my I only get *.o files and never get
the actual iclass, idraw, ... binaries!!!


STEPS:

I got iv.3.1 and the g++.3.1 patches for my linux box.
I ensured I had more than 50 Mb free space on my drive.
I unpacked both tar files and applied the g++ patch.
I edited gcc.def & replaced the appropriate paths to the include files
        and the libraries.
I edited local.def and uncommented the "gcc line" & updated the X11
        paths per my system.
`make CPU` returns LINUX so I moved the iv-x386.cf file to iv-linux.cf
I changed dir to /usr/src/iv
I did setenv CPU `make CPU`
I did the make World ( XCONFIGDIR not needed since it is at /usr/lib/X11/config)

        This finished and consumed about 35 Mb as opposed to the suggestes 18Mb

I then did the make install which ran quickly and added only 1 Mb or so to 
        my drive!!! (Only error ever was some char constant in one source file)

PROBLEM:

After the make install I looked in my installation dir /usr/local/iv only
to find NO binaries except the cpu* imkxxx ..... 

I examined the Makefiles only to discover that NO linking is being done on
the *.o files in iv/src/bin/<package>!!

What is going on here?? ANYONE??

Thank You

>1. Is it necessary to have both root and usr partition?

No, but it *is* handy.  If I'd thought about it more, I would've had
a separate /var filesystem.  I didn't put /usr in it's own filesystem;
/home is a symbolic link to /work/home, and I put all kinds of things
in my /work filesystem.

>2. What's the necessary size for a root partition.

It depends on what you're loading.  If I combine *all* in one partition
and install everything (Slackware 1.1.2 w/0.99pl15), this will suck up
abt 180 MB *before* I add my /u/bin tree...

>Currently I'm planning a layout something like this:

Well, place the swap partition FIRST on the disk, so it is as close to
the root filesystem's inode table.  When you start swapping, you want
to minimize HDA motion.

Actually, you *don't* want a lot of filesystems on 1 disk, but it *does*
make life easier.

It depends.  It would force you to buy a "genuine" DX2-80 (read: spend more
money) -- although someone said it was only about $20 more--in this case, it
seems to be almost stupid to continue to make the 66Mhz version!

>|> But a DX2-80 can't be just a relabeled, overclocked DX2-66.
>|>It's bus speed has to be 40 Mhz.

You're missing the point, I think:  A DX2-66 system has a motherboard with
a clock crystal that enables the system to run at 33Mhz (if I'm not mistaken,
the crystal *is* 66Mhz).  If I have a motherboard that allows me to set
multiple clock rates (and I do :) than I can rip the xtal out, replace it
with a faster one, and set the jumpers to say I'm running at 40Mhz, not 33.
"overclocking" in this case, means to run the chip out of spec by running a
chip designed for 33Mhz at 40Mhz.  I think you misunderstood me. Do you
understand now?  If not, maybe someone can do a better job than me:)

If this is a real limitation of cron (I suspect it may be) it's easy
to get around.  Write a sh-shell wrapper for your (say) csh script:

        #!/bin/sh
        #

The more important question I have is the following one. What is the proper

I never get these things right, but I believe it is:

Yes. Get a cleanly compiled version. The default smail at least on older

have this bug. Compiling smail yourself will stop that problem.

In the wee early hours of this morning, I was Linuxing away and my entire 
system froze up on me.  Finally after a long time, I had to hit the RESET 
button.

Now, when I boot up, it gives me a prompt with the none in it.

(none)~/                                          (now)
brutus/                                           (in the past)

It appears all my stuff is there but I cant do anything with it.  I tried to 
do a fsck but couldnt find it.  I tried to mount, dismount, halt, shutdown.  
Nothing seems to work.  In fact, only mount and dismount are even found.  This 
may be a path issue but I am not sure.

The mount and dismount commands produce an error saying something about 
/etc/mtab~ cannot be created because file system is read only.  I then went to 
my boot diskettes and brought the system up also with read only.

I really need to get this back up and running soon.  Any help or suggestions 
would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: [BUGFIX]: memory consumption (fs/buffer.c)
From: mark@wehi.EDU.AU (Mark W. Watson)
Date: 18 Oct 1994 02:11:02 GMT

I checked the FAQ and the source but could find no obvious place to send this
so its here ;-)  This is NOT an official bug fix and may actually be grossly
incorrect, I am just trying to get it to the right person (people) for comment
or inclusion.  Hopefully someone will tell me where this sort of discussion
should go.

System: Dual P90 with 96MB memory (yes, that is 96MB and a b****y fast PC)
        AHA1542 SCSI controller and SCSI disks, tape, CD drive
        Ethernet, networking, etc...
        NO X

Problem:  buffers grow until almost all memory is gone (known feature I know).
          Not a problem except that memory is not returned fast enough.  We
          can experience 20-30 logins simultaneously, all starting the same
          program and wanting a chunk of memory NOW!.  buffers are not
          released fast enough and the system crashes. (currently only a
          theory until Wednesday night's big login test).

Fix 1:  buffer.c had a hard-coded nr_free_pages check of 5, meaning that bufferf
could take all but the last 5 pages (about 20k).  Is this a bug or was
        it done deliberately?  If deliberate, why?

Fix 2:  For LARGE memory machines, increase the amount of memory protected from
stealing by buffer.c.  Who really wants 95MB of buffers anyway ;-) ?

Patch follows;

Both programs do not need to be setuid root. login is called by getty,
and has root permissions anyway, and newgrp is supposed only to change
the group id to legal group ids, namely those in the supplemental
group ids of the user.

As any setuid program is a potential security problem, having those
programs not needing setuid operation not using it is an intelligent
measure.

AHA!!

So *that's* the damn problem.  Sheesh.  On my Sun and other systems I
have a special WM menu option to kick off an xterm which is logged in as
root; I do this more or less:

        xterm -title "ROOT" -C -e /bin/login root &

Works fine on SunOS et. al., but doesn't work at all on Linux (I am
always logged in as myself :)

One of those annoying things I just never got around to figuring out.
Well, that's trivially fixed...

Subject: How do I use XDM?
Date: Sun, 16 Oct 1994 21:36:22 GMT

I've managed to get X Windows running unde Slackware Professional Linux 2.0
using the 1.1.18 kernel. I would like to set my system up to boot into X
Windows, but when I run XDM, it loads a login requester. When I log in it
acts like it's going to load X, but then it kicks me back to the login
requseter. Even when I login as root. Any suugestions? I'm running on a
486DX-33 with 8 megs, Cirrus Logic CL-GD5428 w/2megs DRAM, and a Sony CDU-33A
cdrom. I used ConfigXF86 to configure X, and can run it by typing 'startx'.

What am I doing wrong, or haven't done?
