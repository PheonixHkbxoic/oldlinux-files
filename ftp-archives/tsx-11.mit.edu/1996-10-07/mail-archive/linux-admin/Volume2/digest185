Subject: [Q] Pathway FTP fails
Date: Fri, 7 Oct 1994 02:29:13 GMT

Hi!

We have a Linux box conected to a Novell net.

We use Pathway Access for Dos and Windows, and I can use telnet (dos
and Windows) without problems, but FTP alway fails. I have tried:
        1. FTP from DOS to Linux.
        2. FTP from Windows to Linux.
        3. FTP from Linux to DOS (DOS with ftpd).

The problems is always a loss of the last 512 bytes Ethernet package
(maybe sometimes even more). Many times I simply loss the FTP connection
on entry.

I don't think it is Linux's fault, as Linux can do FTP with any machine
in the world, including our mainframes.

Currently I FTP from Linux to a local mainframe, and then ftp from DOS to that
mainframe to get the files into DOS. Novell and mainframes both run 
Pathway Access.

I have tried every posible parameter, both in DOS and in Linux.

Ideas?

I don't understand why this shouldn't work. After you boot from floppy,
(which has its own copy of a shell) all you do is mount the harddrive 
partition and change the permission of bash. Can you give us more detail on
why this doesn't work?

Actually I think this has something to do with to little memory
for kernel and such. On my slackware 2.0.0 boot kernel whith
CD-ROM support I got the message "memory is tight" (or similar)
very early in the bootup process. After calculating bongomips Ok,
I got a failed. (But not what failed..) After building a new kernel
without all the things I didn't need. The "memory is tight" message
went away, and after bongomips there is a two line message telling
how much memory is awailable and how much the kernel uses

However while running the original kernel, I did not notice any 
problems with it, even if it "failed"...

You idiot.  Where do you see advocation?  Expression of an opinion
does not imply advocation of anything.   What I mean when I am
saying something is not what you might mean when you were saying the
same thing.   I am advocating nothing.  If you cared to read what I am
saying and not what you would like to hear, you would see that I
expressly have said that I do not believe this is a 'correct' thing
to do, merely that it is possible that it can do no harm.  Never do I
say this makes it 'okay' or do I advocate it.  Learn to read and think.

A lot is two words.  ;-)

I'm through with this thread.  Nobody seems to get it.  This (now
worthless) discussion simply stemmed from a response to a dogmatic view
about system crackers.  I don't care who you express an incorrect
view about, be it a murderer, I will attack it.  This does not
mean I am defending murder.  This does not mean I am advocating murder.  Do
you understand this?  Expressly: I do not advocate system cracking.  I 
also do not advocate blanket statements about system crackers, murderers
or anyone else.  If you have not the intellectual capacity to understand
why being correct even in damning someone or some group, no matter how
much one would like to just damn away indiscriminately, is important, then
I give up.   

This has become pedantic.  I apologize for the bandwidth I have wasted on
this.  If anyone feels they still need to 'straighten me out', take it

Subject: formatting tapes
Date: Tue, 11 Oct 1994 08:01:26 GMT

Dear Linuxers,

    If you ever have to format a tape to be used with a tapestreamer connected
    to the floppy-drive controller (like a Colorado Jumbo), you have to
    boot to DOS, then do a tape-format, then boot back to linux.
    The formatting takes about 1-2 hrs, and in the meantime you can't do
    anything else, because you're at DOS.

    From the bulletin board of Aragorn Computers (Eindhoven, the Netherlands)
    I recently retrieved the DOS program QS3.EXE which allows the recording
    and execution of keyboard macros. QS3 is a tape-formatting utility.

    Using its macro facility I can now format a tape while I'm away or asleep:
    Linux boots to dos, there a modified autoexec.bat waits, formatting the
    tape using the macro-program, booting back to linux thereafter.

    It works very smoothly. The QS3 program is contained in QS3.ZIP, and
    can be obtained from ftp.icce.rug.nl, directory pub/frank. There is also
    a small qs3.README file, in which you'll find more details about the
    procedure.
    
    Any questions or remarks ? Send me an e-mail.

These examples do not bear on my statement, which was: (read..I
specified this rather directly..I am not talking about doing anything
with the system..) typing a correct response to a password prompt for
an account which is not yours and hanging up does no harm.  I'm not
talking here about any of that stuff.  I am not talking about using a
compiler.  I am not talking about typing ls.  I am talking about the mere
act of gaining entry.  Now go on and read the rest of my post.

That would be a very sad day.  Are you capable of representing 99% of admins?
Are you capable of reading the statement I made, not the one you think I
made, and refuting it?  Can anyone understand I am not defending crackers,
but trying to promote rationality in the issue?  Disliking some people or
some actions does not merit losing one's reason.  One must still see what 
is and what is not.  No contest that breaking in is "wrong."  I never
contested that, or if I did I certainly didn't mean to.  But read what I'm
saying and not what you think someone saying what I am saying would be
meaning.

>
>Laci Ladanyi

You seem to have missed my point.  For one thing, the original poster
is not capable of dictating what 99% of sysadmins believe, only what
he believes they believe.  Secondly.  Now.  Read:  the exact, singular
act of typing a correct response to a password prompt does no damage.  Ok,
it might leech several thousand CPU cycles.  What I am trying to point out
is that what one does DOES matter.  Why must this instantly be taken the
wrong way?  It may still be wrong to do it, because it is someone else's
property and they do not want you to do that.  But...true statement: 
the typing in of a correct password that is not yours and hanging up does
NO harm.  You have gained entry.  But done no harm.  It is possible to still
disagree with the act.  But no harm has been done.  Period.  Example:
you may touch me on the arm, doing me no harm.  But I may still rightfully
deny you that.  Can't you see there is no conflict here?  Simply because I
say an act does no harm does not mean I am defending that act.  I am
simply making a statement of fact about that act.

I am not opposed to "99% of all sysadmins."  I was opposed to one man's
opinion of what 99% of all sysadmins would think, and IF that is 
REALLY what they think, then I said they would be wrong.  Which they 
would be.  Read my statement.  Then tell me where you disagree.

Can someone propose a location where followups would be more germane?  
We're sort of off-topic.

My.  I seem to have gotten your goat.  If you will re-read, I never
"rationalized" it.  I in fact believe I implied it was rather unacceptable.
However, I was trying to promote some thinking on the nature of
virtual vs. real tresspassing.  I seem to have struck an emotional chord
with you rather than a rational one.  Do you possess enough mental
sophistication to understand arguing a side without being on that
side?  I specifically indicated that I personally wouldn't want crackers
on my system.  Try and use your brain and not your gut.  Apparently, you
have been a burglary victim, and as is often the case with victims, you
are no longer able to think rationally about the issue.  All that is
left to you is an emotional, knee-jerk response.  This response is
pathetic whether or not what it is a reaction to is bad.  My condolences.
I certainly hope if I am ever victimized, I rise above it better than you
have.

G'day.

I think that you are confused, Dan, between a relabled 66 MHz *system* and
a relabled 66 MHz *cpu*.  They simply put the 66 MHz chip on a 40 MHz
motherboard (which is also accomplished by changing the speed of the
motherboard) and...  TADA! - a 486DX2-80!

        I noticed some talk before here about ISDN. A local service 
provider is going to be using ISDN in the near future, and I'd like to 
use it (a lot cheaper than 56K.)

        What is entailed in using ISDN with Linux? I take it there's an 
ISDN card for the computer. How does Linux use the card? Does it treat it 
like an ethernet card, or something else?

        Bell tells me I'll need an ISDN Terminal Adapter. What is that, 
and will I have that when I have the card? They give me an NT-1, whatever 
that is. 

        I get two "B" channels. Does one ISDN card only use one "B" 
channel? Can I use another ISDN card to have two 64K links to my service 
provider (assuming I pay them twice)?

        Is there any other information about ISDN that I'll need. Anyone 
putting together a FAQ for this? 

        Much thanks for any information anyone can give.

I am not trying to put "spin" on things. I posted what I gathered from 
your response. Yes, Motif 2.0 is out, and it is known that Motif-vendors 
are working on it. You are not revealing anything that was not known 30 
days ago when I bought Motif for Linux from you.

Now, as you have chosen to speak for Metrolink would you like to clarify 
a few things ?

        1.When do you propose to make Motif 2.0 for Linux available ? How 
          much would it cost me to upgrade ? [You did not reply to the 
          e-mail in which I had asked these questions.]

        2.Why is it that none of your advertisements (e.g., on tsx-11.mit.edu)
          indicate that Motif 1.2.4 would *only* run with X11R5 libraries ? 
          [Most companies mention the hardware/software requirements in their
          products.]

My decision to buy Metrolik Motif was based on your old ad (replaced on 
11 Oct.) on tsx-11.mit.edu, in which future updates were mentioned. At 
the time of purchase, I was not told that Metrolink "does not plan to 
update 1.2.4" although all of us knew that XFree86 3.1 was about to be 
released and XFree86 3.0 (X11R6) was available. What if I was running 
XFree86 3.0 ?

People know that R4 libraries would be needed to compile/run R4 apps 
under X11R5. I am sure that there are many people running old versions of 
Motif with XFree86 3.1.

Again, thanks for the advice. What about reshuffling config (templates, cf, 
rules) files and includes ? Do you imply that Motif apps can be compiled 
with R6 includes and templates without any problem ? My experience 
suggests otherwise.

Does it mean that Motif 2.0 would also need X11R5 libraries ?

The issue is not inadequate disk-space or old libraries. It is fine if 
the author of a freeware does not specify the requirements of running the 
program, but I have not known a commercial software that would not 
specify the software/hardware requirements on its package.

Well, in that case, reconsider the decision of not updating Motif 1.2.4. 
You would be doing us a great favour. What do you think your potential 
customers would feel, when they realise that the package they are 
going to buy is not going to work on their existing (X11R6) system 
without old libraries ?

Also, what is your policy regarding those people who have bought or are 
going to buy Motif 1.2.4 after X11R6 release ? Are they going to pay the 
full price for updating to Motif 2.0 ?
