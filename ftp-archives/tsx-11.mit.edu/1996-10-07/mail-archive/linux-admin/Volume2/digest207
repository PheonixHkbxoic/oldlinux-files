Here's the article in which John F. Haugh II gave the official patch.

Though the article doesn't mention the version number, I believe the
current version at the time was 3.2.2.

Here is the official patch for lmain.c.  It should close all of the
holes that have been posted and a few that haven't.  The patch has
been tested to insure that it can be applied to every version of
lmain.c that has ever existed.

Yes, there's 1 prog that uses /var/tmp, which I guess isn't overused

all the filenames on your partition so that you wouldn't have to
do a find each time and take up CPU time. Well /var/tmp
is used by a complementary program to locate, and that is
updatedb. When you run updatedb, it places some files in
/var/tmp. updatedb is the prog that does the find for
all the files on your partition and saves them in a file.
locate later on, looks in that file to see if the file is
present, assuming the databse is current. you run
updatedb once or twice a day and you should be ok.

Get the smail3.1.28 sources and compile them. Then only thing you

things in there to run UUCP+Cnews. Make sure you also get the
newspak(I don't know where to find the latter one). smail
sources is on ftp.uu.net, and on ftp.engr.ucf.edu as well.
Find the newspak somehow, where the config files for smail

UUCP. No hard configuration is needed. L8r

Several possibilities exist. If you are running pre-3.1 dynamically linked
binaries, then you are loading those old libraries on the top of new ones.
Mosaic's case might just be this. Also, you might want to leave off all the
unwanted extensions on your server using link kit. I've been using the 
release since the day of introduction and I find it generally comparable to
2.1 in speed and memory usage.

For cheap and easy and "good enough" performance, try just about any 1 meg

Check your /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/host.conf - this sounds like a clasic
nameserver problem.  Check to see that the nameserver you have defined in
your resolv.conf is the correct IP number, or if you're not using a 
nameserver, remove bind from host.conf.  If that's not it, try removing
the tcpwrapper on telnetd in /etc/inetd.conf - if you're telnetting in from
a PC, it might be trying an ident lookedup, and timing out (since many PC
TCP/IP stacks don't reject connections when they should).  Remember to 
killall -HUP inetd before testing your changes to any of these.

Subject: Very stange ... or very smart modem or term 2.1.4
Date: 14 Oct 1994 19:55:12 -0500

I have encountered very strange behaviour of my modem 14,400.
Here I use Linux (1.0) and there is HP-735. I can run on both
machines term and then trsh. I run it mainly when I need to
transfer binary files. Otherwise I don't use term. Modem
connection is fine, exact like for 14400 baud speed.

At first when I make data transfer using tupload, my log file
is growig about ten time faster then transfered file. All
messages are about garbage packages. The transfer is with a speed
of about 100 bytes/sec. Looks like a telphone line is noisy.
                      WRONG! 
After several minutes, suddenly, my log file stop to grow,
and transfer of subsequent files goes with ta speed of about
1300 bytes per second, rather impressive number for a not compressing
modem as is mine. And it continues, and editor is no more jumpy,
and so on and on without any error messages for hours.

Who is so smart? Modem? Unix on other side? or smart telephone line? ;)

When I disconnect myself and reconect modems again, the whole
problem repeats itself again. Could it be the problem of running
process (term) on other side and its priority? Kind of readjustment?
I know that computer on other side is working hard, some programs run
for several hours extensively using floating point multiplications.

When I started this printing, the text was jumpy and now is OK.
My log file grew to 58845 bytes and now stay at this level without
any change.

Have I bad luck, or is it more common problem?

Have you built your XF86_SVGA (or an equivalent image) such that it
supports PEX?  If not, read README in /usr/X11R6/lib/Server.

With XFree86-2.1.1 or older one, you can complile sources that need
Phigs library.  However, XFree86-3.1 (== X11R6) does not include
libphigs.a in its binary distribution.  libphigs.a is now optional,
and you need to compile to get it from contrib-0.tar.gz.  I have not
made success in this step.

I have installed a couple rpc functions on my system primarily just to

/etc/rpc, I run rpc.portmap and I have this one problem.  I was under the
impression that inetd would run rpc.rusersd apon receiving the request,
however it does not.  It just sits there and the other end gets RPC:
program not registered.  However, if I type rpc.rusersd beforehand and
load it up, it works fine.   Is this correct, or am I missing something?

Reply-To: dgriffin@suntan.eng.usf.edu

I am running xvnews 2.2 patch 1 on a linux 1.0.9 box through a term connection.  Everything seems to work fine except for two things.  First, when I first lauch xvnews, it takes about 4-5 minutes to come up.  I checked the term connection and it is maxed incoming for about 1100 K of data.  The newsserver I am using has about 5000 newsgroups available and I believe that xvnews is reading the name and available messages on all these news groups.  This doesnt appear to have anything to do with retreiving messages or the list of messages per group because when I read those, it is obviously reading them from the server on the spot.  Because I am only subscribed to 12 groups, it is very innefficent for the newsreader to scan all those newsgroups.  My question is, is their anyway to prevent this initial scan or to limit it to subscribed newsgroups??
My second question is:  Is their anyway to keep the groups with no unread messages from dissappearing from the newsgroup view??
Thanks for any info

the traditional solution is to buffer appropriately: most machines
can probably feed even a fast DDS drive, which writes, uncompressed,
to the tape at 550K/s.  compression on the host is a win if the host
is quite fast, since gzip will probably compress better than DDS/DC.

most DDS drives have a significant hardware buffer, so elaborate
speed-matching processes on the host are probably a lose.


> Do most do the hardware compression?  I've been looking at a sony drive
> that claims 8 gig uncomp, 16 compressed...

they lie.  the largest currently-available DDS drive delivers 4G native
on a 120M cassette.  DDS1 drives offer 1.2 or 2.0G capacities based on 
60 or 90M tapes.  the 8 and 16 are _only_ for compressible data, which 
excludes a lot.  in our case, we have dozens of G of images which
are already compressed.
