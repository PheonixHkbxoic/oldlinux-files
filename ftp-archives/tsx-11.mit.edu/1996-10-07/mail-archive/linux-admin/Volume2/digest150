Hi.  I am interested in hearing people advocating
which is better, IDE or SCSI.  One big advantage
for SCSI would be more disks and CD-ROMS not
taking up a slot... But it that worth the 
extra cost of a (good?) controller?  How about
speed?

Thanks very much.

Hi,

while searching a flaw in my smail configuration files, I discovered
a flaw in _my_ smail setup. I cannot say whether the following is
true for every implementation and do not know if this has been
reported before. So be gentle with me.

Configuration: smail 3.1.28 which is included in Linux Slackware 2.0.0.
(tried both binary distribution and locally compiled stuff)

/usr/lib/sendmail is a symbolic link to /usr/bin/smail.

try

/usr/lib/sendmail -d -D/etc/nologin noone@empty.space

as a normal user and have fun explaining it to your sysadmin. I was
awed when I found out...

  Another possibility is that you do not have enough external (SRAM)
cache installed: if (even) a 486DX2/66 plows into a non-cached address
range, the real-time cpu throughput can easily drop by an order of magnitude.

  (I have had to come down from 20MB to 16MB for just this reason.)

Subject: Installing XFree 3.1...
Date: 6 Oct 1994 01:04:24 GMT


        I've been triyng for some time to get XFree 3.1 working with
my Nr9 GXE/64 video card. The problem is that it doesn't seem to be any clock
rate that matches the rates of the card on the examples files. In fact
I think the problem comes from somewere else: XFree seems to be unable
to detect corectly the clocks of the card. Here's what it gives:

(--) S3: card type: 386/486 localbus
(--) S3: chipset:   864 rev. 0
(--) S3: chipset driver: mmio_928
(--) S3: videoram:  1024k
(--) S3: Detected an ATT 20C498 RAMDAC
(--) S3: Ramdac type: att20c498
(--) S3: Ramdac speed: 135
(--) S3: clocks:  25.21  28.32  28.32   0.00  25.16  28.31  28.38  28.35
(--) S3: clocks:  25.16  28.32  28.32  28.32  25.17  28.32  28.32  28.49


        Usually, the clock rates are much higher than those ones, at
least with the other (less fast than the GXE640) cards I tried. Btw, it
detects a ramdac speed of 135 and doesn't give any clock faster
than 29... Can some guru tell me if it's normal?
                                       

        Any help will be appreciated.

        Thanks.

I heard that AMD's version is more reliable than Intel's, and that many
people have overclocked it to 80 MHz with no problems.  There was even
a rumor going around that AMD would start to sell them as 486DX2-80's.
If you see an AMD 486DX2-80 system for sale, I guess the rumor is true.

Your modem is not presenting the true sense of the DCD line. You have
it configured to present it as always being true which is confusing
the getty process into thinking that someone has called the modem.

It is normally set by the AT option &C1. Some older modem have dip
switches.

(Another, less likely option, is that you have a cheap cable which does
not pass the DCD signal and simply wires it to the DTR.)

If you are planning on using the modem for both call in and call out,
then you should consider switching to a uugetty process for the modem.
Agetty works very well for dedicated terminals. It lacks the serial
line interlock that uugetty has. (The uugetty process is in the
mgetty+sendfax package. Another one is in the getty_ps package.)

As a general rule, yes.

The PPP or SLIP user is not consuming processes for the bash plus tin/elm/
pine/gopher, etc. The PPP user is simply using the computer as a conduct
to the network system in general.

Of course, the SLIP/PPP user may consume more network resources than the
typical shell account user. Since the remote user may be running tin and
elm and ftp and gopher and mosaic all at the same time while the typical
shell user runs them one at a time, the network resources _MAY_ be larger
for a SLIP/PPP link.

This is one of the reasons that most commercial SLIP/PPP providers don't
run SLIP or PPP on their computer. They use a commercial terminal server
which is designed to do this operation with multiple connection points.

I`ve just installed linux at home. My pc is 486DX33 with 4M of RAM.
It looks good but x  runs very very slow.  Thus, it swaps a lot to
hard disk, and I fear that its life span is being shortened
considerably.  So I might buy more memory.  With my tight budget, I
could only afford another 4M.  Question is, is it worth it to buy the
4M now, or just wait for probably another year and get 16M?n  If I
buy the 4M now, wuold it improve things a lot, or not much
improvement?

Well, for me it worked simply after copying the old X libraries to
/usr/X11R6/lib. No need to recompile at all.

For some people, having multiple libraries may of course be a problem,
or an unorthodox thing to do. But it seems to work. Don't know if it's
much use to go to XFree86 3.1 if you do it (for me there was: 2.1
didn't restore the text mode of my S3-805 card upon exit from X

This really looks like a problem to me. Smail is only able to deliver
mail if it's suid root. Having group mail and group writing permissions
in all relevant directories is not enough (just checked). Is it using
some other priviledged stuff? I'll have a look at the sources tonight;
in the worst case, I'll disable the '-D' option for my site.

I've never seen anything officially out (though it may be coming soon),
but one of the 1st things I did when installing smail was patch src/main.c
to use fopen_as_user instead of fopen when -D is used.

If you are about to buy a new CPU, you might want to check out AMD's

Subject: Calling all imake gurus
Date: 6 Oct 1994 05:15:56 GMT

Well, I have a fairly bizarre problem - my imake doesn't work, and thus
neither does my xmkmf, which I need to actually use some new packages.

I have checked permissions, I have gotten a new /usr/X11/lib/X11/config 
tree, both from Slackware and from other people, and also gotten a new
imake binary.  My original install was from Slackware 1.1.1, a rather
old one, and I didn't use X until Xfree86 2.1.1, which is what I installed.

Here's fairly typical results (same thing if run as root - therefore
should not be a permission problem):

isengard:~/dlds/not-installed/xdaliclock-2.02> xmkmf
mv Makefile Makefile.bak
imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/X386/lib/X11/config -v
cpp -I. -Uunix -traditional -DUseInstalled -I/usr/X386/lib/X11/config
cc: No input files
imake: Exit code 1.  Stop.
isengard:~/dlds/not-installed/xdaliclock-2.02>

I believe that means that cpp is not getting the correct #include
"imake.tmpl" but I could be wrong.

Any assistance appreciated.

NO NO NO

cp doesn't copy symlinks.  If you want a completely messed up file tree, go
for it, otherwise use tar from the source tree:

        tar cvpf - | (cd /target ; tar xvpf -)

Or a close equivalent.
