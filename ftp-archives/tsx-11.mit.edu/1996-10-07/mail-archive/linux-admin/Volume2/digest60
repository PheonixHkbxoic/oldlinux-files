That's your problem.  Copy the WAD to an ext2 partition and run it from there.

Subject: xdm and sessreg: wtmp/utmp
Date: Tue, 13 Sep 1994 05:57:20 GMT
Reply-To: ockers@umr.edu

Why can't I get sessreg to register X clients in utmp and wtmp???

My userlist always shows up as being like this:
User     tty    From             login@   idle  JCPU  PCPU  what
ockers   ttyp0                  11:49pm                     something

As you can see, the From field is blank.  I think that there should
be a :0.0 in there.  Also, the wtmp does not even show anybody logged
in!  This is bad.  When someone connects to my xdm and logs in, I would
like to have some record of that!

I am running kernel 1.0.9, standard slackware 2.0 distribution.  Nothing
too fancy.  XFree86 version 2.1.1 .  SysVInit.

I looked at the sessreg(1) man pages.  It claims to handle utmp and
wtmp for non-init clients.  It does not.  This is not covered in any 
FAQ that I could find.

According to the man pages, sessreg acts differently for BSD or SYSV 
xdms.  I am guessing that the SYSV stuff applies to me.

The BSD problem seems to be the indexing of utmp, wherein each entry
has a slot number.  sessreg looks at the Xservers file and the /etc/ttys
file, and takes (# of entries in /etc/ttys)+1=(the utmp slot for this 
session).  The 1 there is for the X session, so that it can be added to
utmp.

My /etc/ttys is not updated to show the ttys that are currently 
in use!  It contains 10 lines which are the first 6 VCs and the first 4 
ptys.  It has not been modified since I installed linux.  This screws up 
sessreg; it says "lseek: invalid argument" since sessreg is trying to 
update the 11th slot in utmp.  Of course there is no 11th slot in utmp. 
Even if there were, it would probably be the wrong slot.

sessreg -s <number> specifies a slot number for sessreg to assign the session
to.  sessreg does not return an error message if you assign a slot that
exists in utmp; but it also does not modify utmp or wtmp in any way!

Also, in the SYSV environment sessreg is supposed to ignore the BSD-specific
flags.  Since it is not ignoring them (lseek?) I must be in a BSD environ-
ment.  Right?  And if I leave off the BSD-specific flags, I get the lseek error.

My /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers file looks fine.  The first non-commented line
it contains (and the last line in the file) is 
:0 local /usr/X386/bin/X

This is from the man pages:     "If for some strange reason your
       system uses a file other than /etc/ttys  to  manage  init,
       the  -t  option can direct sessreg to look elsewhere for a
       count of terminal sessions."

My system apparently does not use /etc/ttys to manage init.  What
does it use?  Any ideas?

I put sessreg -a $USER in the file specified by the DisplayManager._0.startup
resource.  Likewise, sessreg -d $USER is in the file specified by the reset
resource.  It has no visible effect on anything.  (I know those scripts are
executing properly because they do other things.)

If you email me your ideas on how to make this work, I'll post a summary/
solution.  Thanks so much.

As everyone has said, the command fdisk/mbr within DOS is the answer.

THIS SHOULD BE STATED clearly and loudly in the setup program,

 You might ofcourse have different version than I but  this is what my
lilo.conf looks like:

=====lilo.conf=====
boot = /dev/hda
compact
delay = 5
vga = 0
ramdisk = 0

  root = /dev/hdb1 
  image = /vmlinuz
  label = linux

  other = /dev/hda1
  table = /dev/hda
  label = msdos
=====lilo.conf=====

This automagically boots Linux.  If I want to  boot  msloss I have  to
press ctrl or alt in order to choose between them.

The file /etc/utmp keeps track of who is on 'right now', you can reach its

Correctly the file /var/adm/wtmp keeps track of who has logged in when and
for how long and use the "last"-command to read it (the "weird" format).
Simply "last" gives a list of all logins since last deletion of the file,
combinate it with "grep" and for example wordcount.

Try "last | grep user| wc -l" to see how many times user has been on...
Did this solve your problem?

wtmp is not automatically deleted on boot-time (unless some of the newer
installations use it as default), it just keeps growing and growing for each
login. You should delete and retouch it from time to time yourself.

There is some accounting-stuff (acct) as well, haven't tried it myself yet,
but you might like to check it out. This is not default and you should find
it on anonymous ftp somewhere.

nosuid *AND* noauto, if you ask me.
noauto causes the system to not attempt mounting the floppy at boot-time (or
whenever else the /etc/fstab is read), it has to be mounted seperately.

nosuid is good, too, as it stops attempts to run setuid files on the mounted
fs. Why choose one?

Someone else has already posted this, but as far as e-mail is concerned
the solution lies in your mailer-daemon's configuration. Assuming you use
Smail, edit the line in /usr/lib/smail/config that says "other_names" or
something similar. Add ":second.host.name" at the end of the line to
solve your problem.

Vesa 1 spec says slots are not allowed for 50 MHz operation. Vesa 2 says 1
slot for 50 MHz, 2 Slots for 40 MHz, 3 Slots for 33 MHz. Mainboard vendors
say I dont care about standards and reliability and will offer 50 MHz boards
with 3 slots. And then to reduce the cost of manufacturing they will use a
3222 burst for 50 MHz cache reads reducing the transfer rate below that of a
33 MHz board with 2111 burst. What I dont know is if a 50 MHz board has an
atvantage for other memory or bus operations.

: > 

VLB has the disatvantage that it needs at least 2 cycles for every transfer.
Even follow up cycles in burst mode where PCI only needs one cycle.
Therefore if you care about the speed of your bus you have to use PCI and be
careful to pick the right chipset and board manufacturer. Good PCI boards
operate at 65 MByte/second for STOSD, the best ever seen on a VLB board
(actually a Asus PCI/VLB hybrid with Intel Aries chipset where the VLB
hanging on the PCI bus over a bridge) was 42 MByte/second. The data come
from various c't magazines from 10.93 to 8.94. c't seems to have tested
almost every PCI mainboard.

BTW 65 MB/second is the maximum transfer rate which can be achieved when
using a 486DX chip. 32 Bit PCI has a theoetical limit of 132 MB/second.

And now if someone could explain why the Pentium chipsets in general provide
less PCI and possibly memory performance than the good 486 chipsets, I would
be glad to hear it.

The solution is a workaround. In your xterm window, you can type
`stty' and you will note that the speed of your pty is set to
zero. This seems to be because the pty state is copied from the
`controlling tty'. I think you are running xdm in daemon mode where
there is no controlling terminal, thus the speed is zero. Start xdm in
nodaemon mode, or start X with xinit, or type `stty 9600' in your
xterm window. 

With any of the above, you will be able to rlogin to Solaris. I spent
two days tracking this one down.
