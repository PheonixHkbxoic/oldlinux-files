The line in /etc/rc.d/rc.M from the Slackware 2.0 distribution I've
got (from the InfoMagic Developers Resource CD-ROM) is:
        # Start crond (Dillons crond):
        /usr/sbin/crond -l10 >>/var/adm/cron 2>&1

Great. That basicaly answers my question. I've been doing a lot of
reading these past couple of days (after I got a suggestion from another
Australia fellow) and I have been able to pin point several of these
problems. The one thing I was missing was having someone else trying 
traceroute and see how it got routed from their point of origin. I
noticed that traceroute's man pages makes refference to a -g option 
which doesn't exist in the executable I have. I found several other
packages and am now in the process of reading them all.

Subject: PPPD permissions
Date: 4 Sep 1994 23:25:45 GMT

I'm trying to set up a ppp server, using the approach described in the new 
NAG with /etc/ppp/ppplogin script. I get this in syslog:

Sep  4 19:16:33 mira pppd[326]: ioctl(PPPIOCGUNIT): Operation not permitted
Sep  4 19:16:33 mira pppd[326]: ioctl(PPPIOCGDEBUG): Operation not permitted

Then it hangs up.

What should I do to make this permitted? Somewhere in the README's it sais 
that pppd should be run by root - but how, then, I set up a ppp login 
without making the ppp user a root equivalent?

Am I missing something obvious?

Thank You.

P.S. The new nag is great, my hat is off to Olaf Kirch, but page 146 (post
script version), "Configuring a PPP Server"  obviously hasn't been proofread
- check out the lower paragraph.

I think it's possible, but it would have to be integrated in the kernel,
whereas dosemu is a user-mode program afaik. What's more, dosemu -being a
"normal" process, doesn't disable the other running processes while it's
running. This data has also to be considered in a multi-user environement.

I believe current linux fsstnd wisdom calls for umtp currently in /var/adm
(fsstnd'ers correct me if I'm wrong) -- the problem was correctly stated, but
a better solution (IMO) is a symlink.  This avoids having some programs logging
in one place and others in another, also the admin programs that look for utmp
will not have the correct info.  Just do (as root):

rm /etc/utmp
rm /var/adm/utmp
touch /var/adm/utmp
cd /etc
ln -s /var/adm/utmp .

Now all logging takes place in /var/adm/utmp, and binaries that look in /etc
will still work correctly.

Hi,
I need to find the program that converts pcf fonts
to bdf format. 

I know this might seem like going backwards but the reason
is that I have an Xclient in MS windoze that has
a utility to convert bdf fonts to fon  windoze 
compatible fonts.

If there is a utility to convert pcf directly to
.fon files, that would be great. If not,
I would appreciate any pointers to a pcf to bdf
conversion utilty.

thank you

: What is required to set up an ISDN line with linux? Does the necessary

As far as I know, you'll be able to use all the same software you have/use
now for your Internet connection over an ISDN line.  So if you use
SLIP/PPP to get connected, you should be able to continue doing the same
old thing.  As for the hardware, expect to spend about $600-800 for it. 
According to the info sheets I just got from Pacific Bell's ISDN office,
here's a list of the equipment you will have to have: 

        1)  Network Termination 1 (NT1).  This is a piece of
            hardware that creates the two B channels and the
            one D channel needed for ISDN transmission.

        2)  Power supply for the NT1.  ISDN needs constant
            electrical power (in other words, if you have a
            blackout, you lose your ISDN).  Sometimes you can
            find NT1s with built-in power supplies.

        3)  Terminal Adapter (TA).  This can be a card that
            you plug into your computer, or it can be a stand-
            alone box that you run ethernet from to your computer's
            ethernet card.  It puts all information it receives
            into ISDN protocol format so it can go out on the
            ISDN wire.

You can optionally get an ISDN phone which plugs right into the NT1, but
it costs about $400 right now.  I believe they have some nifty features
beyond the capabilities of normal phones, but I don't know any of them. 
They do recommend you keep a standard phone line in, as you will lose all
communications if the power goes out; a standard phone will at least let
you dial in and let folks call in during blackouts. 

Now, on to line fees: 

Pacific Bell is charging $22.95 per month for a single ISDN line.  
Installation is $34.75 if you keep the line installed for at least two 
years, otherwise it's $125 more.

Also, the cost for daytime rates (8 a.m. to 5 p.m.) is 4 cents for the 
first minute, and 1 cent per minute thereafter, for local calls.  During 
off-hours, it's free.  But you still have to add your telco's normal zone 
and/or long distance fees to the above rates if you dial out of your area.

Folks in Pacific Bell's jurisdiction can call 1-800-472-4736 for more
information or a copy of the 9-page handout I received from them (home
ISDN). 

Hope this helps a bit.

Dave

I have a problem with a SLIP line going from a Slackware 2.0 machine and a
CISCO terminal server.  
 
Often times, if I do, letsay "ls -l" the output won't be displayed unless
I escape back to the terminal server prompt and then return to the connection.
Also I often have timed out Kermit and Zmodem transfers as well.  This also
happens if a I telnet into my machine, then two a thrid machine, I similarly
get astopped screen output.
 
FTP works just liek its suppossed to and my OS/2 based machines slip in/out 
fine. 
 
This must be a tty (stty?) setup problem someplace, but I'm kinda stumped.
Any ideas?

package will work unchanged, completely. I have about 1 1/2 week's

put 'accton' in my rc script, then during a reboot it gets put into a

The phrase that OS/2 uses to suggest where to place the swap file is
`in the most-used partition on the least-used disk.'  That way, the
heads are most likely to be near the right place.  For a swap partition,
it would be best to have it placed on a disk which is the least used
under Linux, for the same reason.
