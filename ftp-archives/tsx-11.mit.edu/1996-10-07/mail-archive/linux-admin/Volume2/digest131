when xdm runs (actually when xinit starts up) it run everything in a

thing in that file is exec /usr/bin/X11/mwm (or fvwm).  xdm then waits
for that process to die.  when it does it goes back to the log in

what you need to do is have that file check to see if
${HOME}/.Xsession exists if it does then source that, if it doesn't
then source a system default one..

soo.. 
in .Xsession you would add something like

/usr/bin/X11/mwm &  # start up Motif
/usr/bin/X11/xclock -digital -geometry +0+0 &
/usr/bin/X11/xeyes -geometry -0-0 &

exec /usr/bin/X11/xterm -T LOGIN -n login -bg black -fg white
#
#   these lines will not be run until the above xterm dies...
#


This way the user can change the windowmanager by killing the existing
one and starting up a new one..

is  kill mwm.pid ; /usr/bin/X11/fvwm &

xdm will log them out when they kill the xterm...

Hope this helps..

Ok I have a question for you guys.  Since I didn't here the beginning of
this thread I have this particular problem:


I have a problem.  There is a machine which I dial up and get
a slip link to.  On this machines network I can access all of the 
machines.  However I have to telnet to a machine I have an account on
on that network to be able to telnet or ftp to the rest of the internet.
Is there a way I can somehow have the machine that I do have an account
on to act as some sort of a gateway.  I've tried specifiing that machine
as my gateway to no avail.

I want to make it look to my machine as if I am connected directly to
the internet.  And if possible to the internet that I am connected directly
to it.  I am assuming the termserver will not route packets out side of
the network the machine "bert" lies on.  I have an account on the machine
bert, which is how I access the internet.  I would like to be able to
do what I do from bert directly from my machine, which happens to be
a linux box.

Here is what I see when I type the route command on my box.  By the way 
which is a Linux machine.

Hello,

I hope that it is OK to post about this here; I was not sure *where*
would be a good place.

Anyway, I have noticed that with the new Slackware NTeX package
(10 disks!) umlauted 'a's and 'o's don't show up under xdvi if the
source file is compiled under LaTeX. (Everything does, however,
seem to work fine with plain TeX documents.) If this is not the
right place to post, please tell me where I should post, because
someone needs to know about this bug.

I'm looking into purchasing a Philips CDD-522 recorder, but most of the software
that I've seen for writing disks is written for DOS or Windows, and tends to be
more than $800.  I was cautioned against hanging a CD-recorder on *any*
multitasking system.  Has anyone had successful experiences writing CDs under
linux?  What software is used?  (Does one use one package to make an
ISO-compliant disk image, and then another package to actually copy the image
onto the CD-ROM?)  
 
Any information regarding CD-recorders on a unix box would be helpful.

If you have a working SLIP configuration then there's no need to move
to PPP. Once setup, both have more or less the same functionality.
  However, if somebody starts from scratch I suggest to use PPP
because it's much easier to configure. (Routing+ARP)

Also look on ftp.demon.co.uk, under /pub/doc/unix. There are scripts for
Slackware 1.2/2 slip/ppp and news/mail setup. These are Demon Internet

be worth a look for anyone just starting.

I do not have that problem at all.  My workstation sits on the Novell network,

                -----*-----

    PPP may be more efficient than SLIP theoretically (I don't know)
but as a PPP user I am finding that my PPP-vendor's server is the weak
link in the system.

   I have a hunch that sudden, large variation in the RMS of ping
times may be a reasonably good predictor of imminent server-failure but
I haven't got around to writing a program to sample the ping times yet.

   Also I am finding that my current PPP-vendor seems to like
to kill my connection if I don't send anything out over the line for
more than a few minutes.

  But I found the Linux end of PPP to be much simpler to set up than I
had expected it to be; this fact I attribute to the superb manner in
which the PPP software (ppp-2.1.2a.tar.gz) has been configured and 
documented.

  IOW, when my PPP-vendor's server is up, it's great!

        I got the Yggdrasil fall 94 cdrom, ftp'd rev B of the boot disk & errata.
I got a new 540 meg Maxtor HD, partitioned it w/ 4 partitions 270,100,100,30.75
/dev/hda4 is swap partition /dev/hda1 is /home  (no /usr partition specified)

        I created the boot floppy during the install process.  I set the boot flag
on /dev/hda1.  I can boot from floppy, but not from HD.  The HD boot gives me
"Missing Operating System."  I tried the Halt command.  It did not work.  I can boot
from floppy, and access the entire system, so I have a working system.

        I have a 386 DX 25 w/math co.  8 meg ram.  AMI bios (I switched from
bios ram 0030:00 to 1k Dos after reading errata, no change).  I installed most of
the errata from the Yggdrasil ftp site.  The /usr changes did not work due to
the stuff being on cdrom.

        CDRom is Sony CDR-33A, and it works fine.  I have X windows working.

        What do I do?  

        What do I do with the vmlinux that I ftp'd from Yggdrasil?
(ie: can I copy it over the one on the (newly made copy of the) boot floppy, and 
LILO it?  Should I?)

Hey pete.  I have a Zeos Pantera 90 and I use the onboard aha152x scsi chip. 
Basically, the chip works great with linux once you override Linux's desire
to find the card at IRQ 12..  

Performance-wise, you'd be better off getting a nice PCI based scsi card. 
the Zeos scsi chip seems to be wired into the ISA bus, not the PCI system. 
I just got a QLogic PCI scsi card and under DOS the speed difference is very
VERY noticible, I have yet to try the QLogic under Linux.  (I understand
there is a kernel patch...)

If you'd like any more info, just let me know.

Subject: /dev/tty0 ownership
Date: 1 Oct 1994 17:23:27 GMT

Hiya.  I've got basically a Slackware 2.0 Linux/X setup, with 
kernel version 1.1.50.  I'm using agetty on VCs 1-6, and X is 
on VC 7.  

The man pages for console and tty indicate the /dev/tty? should
be mode 622, owned by root.tty, in general.  It also makes sense
that when a user logs in, they should get ownership of the 
appropriate ttys.  That seems to happen fine for /dev/tty[1-6],
but not so for the rest.

When I start X, I get ownership of /dev/console, /dev/tty0, and 
/dev/tty7.  When I leave X, I retain ownership.  When I log out,
I retain  ownership.  When someone else logs in, they are bummed.
In particular, if someone tries to use loadkeys, they find that
I own the console and they are not allowed to muck with it.  When
I say `I', I mean an ordinary user, not root.  If another ordinary
user starts X, then they get the console, and after exiting they 
retain ownership.

It doesn't look like `startx' or `xinit' are responsible for re-
setting ownerships, so I guess it's X.  Can anyone suggest what I
can do to make things right?  Anyone else have this problem?

Also I notice that, even for /dev/tty[1-6], when I logout, owner-
ship goes back to root.root, not root.tty as the manpage suggests.
Yet all the relevant programs (agetty, /bin/login) are owned by
root.bin -- which program is responsible here and how can I get it
to `do the right thing'?? 

Thanks in advance,
Greg

I want to make it look to my machine as if I am connected directly to
the internet.  And if possible to the internet that I am connected directly
to it.  I am assuming the termserver will not route packets out side of
the network the machine "bert" lies on.  I have an account on the machine
bert, which is how I access the internet.  I would like to be able to
do what I do from bert directly from my machine.

Here is what I see when I type the route command on my box.  By the way 
which is a Linux machine.

Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
uicgate         *               255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 sl0
127.0.0.0       *               255.0.0.0       U     0      0        0 lo
default         uicgate         *               UG    0      0     4996 sl0

uiucgate is the name of the termserver, or at least the name I gave it in
my hosts file.

Its IP is 128.248.7.1, the numbers the termserver gives me are usually
128.248.7.n where 'n' is some number.  Bert the machine that I can
get to and have a logon on has an IP of 128.248.166.23.  I can get anywher
e once I am logged onto bert.  I do have a particular interest in getting
on machines with 141.142.x.x,  128.174.x.x , and if possible the
whole dang net.

Normaly I wouldn't bother but its Friday and I'm feeling pedantic. What you
posted WAS NOT a summary, it was the contents of your mail folder. Have you
read Emily Postnews? It's a text on nettiquette, nice and sarcastic. I
would recomend it to anyone starting in the usenet. The best bit is, if you
read it, you'll find a bit on your "summary" in there ;) It gets posted
regularly in news.answers I think.

OBLinux:

Looks like Xfree 3.1 isn't going to make it out on time. :) Depending on
which country the release is supposed to be coming from they have 0 - 24 hours
left <g>

Bye

        Try something like: info@wri.org, and they'll tell you that
they're not interested in Linux.  Pretty stupid on their behalf if you
ask me but thats marketers trying to speak for the programmers for ya.
This bounced around the groups a while ago and that was the response.  I
hope they changed their minds by now.  If they haven't, there is
considerable headway in making Linux use the binaries of other i386
unices.  If they don't support it directly, see if one of the binary
packages they support will run under the newer kernels.  Then tell us
8-).  I am also really interested in gatting mathematica for Linux.  At
the moment, that is the ONLY reason I ever boot dos.
