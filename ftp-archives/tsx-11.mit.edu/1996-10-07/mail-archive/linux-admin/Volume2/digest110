You can't do an ifconfig for a slip device before you have successsfully

ppp0 is not a slip device. It would be a PPP device.

email me some details and I will assist you.

The problem you are having here is that man -k does not access the man 
pages directly, it accesses a file called 'whatis' in the man directory. 
All you need to do to update the wahtis file is type 'makewhatis' and a 
fine UNIX program charges through your man directories, checking the 
header for each command, and chucking them all into the whatis file.

Make absolutely certain your parallel port is not using IRQ5.  If it is,
switch it to IRQ7, then try again.

Ok... your setup looks like this:

      PPP
       |
???.???.???.??? (A)

       |                            |                        |
       +----------------------------+------------------------+

Now, usually, the setup that works best is to assign the PPP interface on
the Linux router to an address in the same net as the uplink, in this case
192.215.98.0.  So, the PPP interface might have the address 192.215.98.3.
This is address (A).

This is the important part: (and you pros who know it's sometimes
possible to cheat, don't joggle my elbow) The Ethernet interface on the
router machine must have a _separate_ IP address, preferably on a
different net.  So, that interface (B) might be 192.215.99.1, and the other
machines on the ether, (C) and (D), might be ..99.2 and ..99.3.

If you set things up this way, then the routing on (C) and (D) will be teh
default, (everything goes out over their IP address), and the routing on
the Linux router is 192.215._99_.0 via 192.215.99.1 (the (B) interface),
and default via 192.215._98_.3 (or whatever the (A) address is).

The 2 main rules to remember are:

1)      Each interface on a host (especially one being used as a router)
        must have a separate IP address.. usually one on a separate net.
        (Be careful about your netmasks)

        and

2)      When you specify routing, you tell the kernel which _interface
        address_ to use to send packets to a given network.

        Again, if I have 2 interfaces on a machine, one a PPP to the
        world, with address (let's say) 192.1.1.1, and one an ether LAN
        with address 192.2.1.1, then I tell the route command to route
        packets for _network_ 192.2.1.0 out the _interface_ labeled
        192.2.1.1, and to route everything else (the default)_, out the 
        interface labeled 192.1.1.1.

Clear as mud?

Sorry... it's a bit messy to explain.  Keep the 2 rules in mind... and
remember, if you _can't_ follow them (maybe your service provider won't
assign you an entire network), you _can_ break them... sometimes.

Cheers,

Yup... it is.  Nice package.  You're not gonna sell much of it with that
approach, though.  Particularly not in a Linux group.

Subject: WABI, WP, Word, etc.
Date: 26 Sep 1994 13:24:10 -0500


Hi there,

I've looked into WINE and it's no where near ready for useful
applications like Word, and doesn't appear to be heading there in the
near future.  I know that Sun has WABI, it's own Windows emulator,
but, I don't know much about it.  Can one buy a version of WABI that
can be run on Linux, possible using iBCS?  Also, I saw some talk
earlier about being able to get WP for Linux, and I was wondering what
number(s) to call to get information on that.  What I REALLY want is
to have MS Word for Linux, then, I'll be truly happy, so does anyone
know where I can call to find out about that?  I think ultimately, the
best solution is to buy WABI and run Word that way, since I already
have a copy, but I'm not sure.  ANY help is appreciated.

I've been trying to mount my PC's linux partition from my Sun workstation.
I obviously have been unsuccessful or I wouldn't be posting this message.

I made a change to my "etc/exports" file.
I added the following line

where workstation is the name of my sun workstation and its IP address 
is in my hosts file.

After making the change I wasn't sure what I sould do to make it take 
affect.  I assumed that either mountd  or rebooting the machine would 
do it.

On my workstation it just times out trying > server not responding: RPC:

any suggestions would be appreciated.

   Did you try
   cd "maintenance desktop"
   ?

Yes, also 'cd maint*' and 'cd maintenance\ desktop' and various
other things.  All say 'maintenance: No such file or directory.'

'ls maint*' works, and 'chdir ("maintenance desktop");' in C works,
I think it's just bash parsing of the cd command.

httpd defaults to index.html when you don't specify a specific file
to view. So if you don't have a index.html it will default to showing
an index of that directory that is your SourceRoot or whatever that

I have a SS2 running Solaris 2.3, V8.6.9 Sendmail and Solaris default DNS.
I have it configured properly as the primary for my domain and some others.

I went to add a 486/33 running the Slackware 2.0 Linux 1.1.18 kernel and the
DNS that came with it as a secondary server. Thought I configured it right
and brought it online, then I discovered that mail was being held in the mail
queue on the SPARC (the mail hub for the domain) because sendmail couldn't
resolve the hostname ("failed DNS lookup"). When I killed the named on
the Linux machine, sendmail started resolving again. Any ideas what I can
do about this, or what is causing it? Thanks in advance. -Gary
