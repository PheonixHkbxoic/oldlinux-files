   I am not trying to put "spin" on things. I posted what I gathered from 
   your response. Yes, Motif 2.0 is out, and it is known that Motif-vendors 
   are working on it. You are not revealing anything that was not known 30 
   days ago when I bought Motif for Linux from you.

   Now, as you have chosen to speak for Metrolink would you like to clarify 
   a few things ?

           1.When do you propose to make Motif 2.0 for Linux available ? How 
             much would it cost me to upgrade ? [You did not reply to the 
             e-mail in which I had asked these questions.]

           2.Why is it that none of your advertisements (e.g., on tsx-11.mit.edu)
             indicate that Motif 1.2.4 would *only* run with X11R5 libraries ? 
             [Most companies mention the hardware/software requirements in their
             products.]

You know, this is an interesting point of view...A *new* product comes
out (XFree86 3.1) that is *not* compatible with an existing product
(Motif), yet instead of asking why the *new* product is not compatible
with the *existing* product, you choose to question *why* the existing
product is not immediately made compatible with the new product...the
logic is a bit skewed here...

Personally, I think the XFree folks should have consulted more with
the Motif folks *before* releasing their product so that most of these
incompatibility issues could be ironed out...

Also, I noticed a little disclaimer with the XFree stuff, something to
the effect that your X11R5 clients would not work properly with
XFree_3.1, so apparently this "incompatibility" is not just limited to
Motif. I *hope* there are some very good reasons for this apparent
gratuitous incompatibility, because I'd sure hate to have to recompile
or replace all or even most of my x-clients...


[...stuff deleted...]

   The issue is not inadequate disk-space or old libraries. It is fine if 
   the author of a freeware does not specify the requirements of running the 
   program, but I have not known a commercial software that would not 
   specify the software/hardware requirements on its package.

Ummm...perhaps because the XFree folks held the testing so close to
their chests, the "commercial" software vendors were unaware of this
incompatibility till sometime shortly after the "freeware" was released?

Also, it is NOT "okay" for the author of a freeware program to not
specify the requirements of running the program, especially "freeware"
that is being used as the basis for many business applications...

Hopefully next time the XFree folks will be more open about their
testing, and this sort of problem will be eliminated long before a
public release...try looking at the development/testing activities for
the Linux system...*very* open policy, and from what I've seen, the
software is of *very* high quality...perhaps the XFree folk will take
note of that ?

Those machines with have enough RAM, and are not swapping, are more likely
to need better I/O devices.  For example, I wonder if Srini's machine
serving those few Xterminals has an EISA bus, with an EISA scsiII HD
controller and fast drives, and an EISA ethernet card and serial ports
being used are off a smart EISA card.....  Even with just a 486 66,
the proper amount of memory and speedy I/O should yield startling results.

That does not make sense.  Unix is *UNIX*, if everyone is using the same
window manager (very typical), then the binary is loaded only once into
memory and shared.  Window managers are small compared to most X applications.
If you want to speed things up, lower loads on the host and net, then
add more memory to the Xterminals and make sure the Xterminal has backing
store enabled!

>(PS The above is based upon experiences with Sun Sparc 1 en 2 -- but will be

Actually, no.  The Sun (at least running 2.3) swapps like *MAD* with
16 MB of memory doing just about anything.  I was quite disappointed.
On the other hand, my Linux box at home has 16MB of RAM and I can run
tons of stuff and still not swap.  This might be due to the RISCness of
the Suns (I noticed binary sizes are often 50% bigger).

Subject: On PPP I can FTP but not SMTP
Date: 13 Oct 1994 13:40:48 GMT

I just installed PPP 2.1.1 on two Linux boxes, to setup a
point-to-point modem link (with no Internet connection).

The two systems are referred to as cassandra and pegasus in the
following.

The following work:

 ftp

 telnet

 rlogin

 finger

But the following don't:

 talk (exits complaining with an "aborted talkd write: network is
       unreachable" immediately after having sent the talk request to
       the other machine talkd (the other machine rings, then talk
       exits))

 smail on smtp (when a message is sent from, say, cassandra, it
                arrives to pegasus, but something goes wrong, and it's
                not delivered. However, on cassandra, root receives a
                mail messages, originating from MAIL-DAEMOD@pegasus,
                showing a log about an smtp transfer which seems to
                imply that the message arrived to pegasus, but then,
                while pegasus was trying to do something in reply,
                network went down ("network is unreachable" again))

Obviously, exchanging "cassandra" <-> "pegasus" doesn't affect the results.

Does someone have any suggestions/solutions?

Mail me, I'll summarize.

Yes, but those were all fixed.  There are no outstanding security

Historically, maybe, but not in recent memory.  Most of the ones
recently require local access.  Scanning the CERT archives, the
list is split about halfway betweeen local-only holes and remote
holes.

Well there are *three* bugs in smail currently, and if memory serves,
at least one is remote.

Okay, I'll argue with you.  I found smail to be a total pain to install.
The documentation sucks, and the config file options aren't very obvious.
Sendmail's documentation is much more complete.

Smail has the "advantage" that it's not used nearly as much as sendmail,
and thus has less people pounding out the bugs on it.  Sendmail may be
of bad design, but if there's a hole to be found, it gets found fairly
soon these days.  Unfortunately it also means that once a bug _is_
found, a heck of a lot more people are affected.  It's simple numbers games.

There are also security problems with the current Zmailer.  (Or
so I was told a couple months ago by someone who discovered some)

It starts buffering about 5 chars before if actually does anything with them, and
then processes them all at once.  Unless I'm mistaken, more uses ncurses to do it's

in tcsh you can use a command as the beep signal.

I can't reasonably evaluate a patch that doesn't include a description
of what it fixes.  And I hope you aren't suggesting that people apply
any patch that anybody posts!

Historically, not posting bug reports seems to result in bugs not
getting fixed.  After watching the net for, um, a number of years now,
I'm firmly in favor of full disclosure.

Subject: Linux [c]fdisk vs DOS
Date: 11 Oct 1994 16:40:44 GMT

I've got two machines that are almost identical.  Both are using BusLogic
445s VL-Bus SCSI-2 controllers onto Micropolis SCSI disks (one is 1.7 GB
and one is 1.0 GB).

The 1.7 GB machine is running MS-DOS v6.20 and Linux 1.1.47 (the Yggdrasil
Fall '94 CD).  I partitioned this using the cfdisk program that was
installed with Linux creating the following partitions:
        /dev/sda1       500 MB  for DOS
        /dev/sda2       32 MB for swap
        /dev/sda3       448 MB for Linux root
        /dev/sda4       700+ MB for Linux home

When I boot into DOS on that machine DOS correctly states that it's got 500
MB of disk space (and whatever I have left (110+ MB :-) is correct too).


The 1.0 GB machine is running MS-DOS v6.21 and the same Linux as above.  I
partitioned this using the cfdisk from Linux as follows:
        /dev/sda1       384 MB for DOS
        /dev/sda2       32 MB for swap
        /dev/sda3       384 MB for Linux root
        /dev/sda4       200+ MB for Linux home

When I boot to DOS on this machine DOS says that it's got all 1.0 GB of
disk space.  I've tried re-partitioning the drive, reformatting it, etc.
but none of that made any difference.  All of the partitions are primary
and I set the active/boot partition to the DOS partition.  At this point
I'm inclined to believe that it's a 'feature' of MS-DOS v6.21 but...

Thanks,
