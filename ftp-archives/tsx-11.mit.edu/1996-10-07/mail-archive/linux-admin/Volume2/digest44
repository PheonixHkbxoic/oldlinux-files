Recommended in books, on the net, etc. What is recommended is NOT
giving multiple people root access; what is recommended IS the idea
of separate UID 0 accounts IF you have already decided that you DO
want multiple people to have root access.

I agree that the fewer people with root access, the better. However
people are free to run their systems as they wish.

Subject: ip forwarding/gatewaying with kernel 1.1.18 problems
Date:  8 Sep 94 18:00:14 GMT

I seem to have a problem with kernel 1.1.18 (actually any
kernel from 1.1.13 onward ). I have two machines , call
them A and B. Machine A runs a ppp link to a netblazer
providing an internet connection. This machine also runs
named for our local net. The other machine , B , is connected
via ethernet to nmachine A. With kernel 1.0.8 ther was no 
problem getting to machine B from outside our domain. Machine
B could also send packets outside our domain as well. When 
I compiled 1.1.18 for machine A , I enabled IP forwarding.
After installing this kernel , I cant ping machine B from 
outside the local domain. Machine B also cant ping machines
other than machine A. The /var/adm/messages on machine A indicate
that when a ping from a machine outside our domain , to machine
B occurs , it claims we have forwarding disabled and I assume 
the packets go to /dev/null. I can ping machine A from outside the 
domain no problem. Why are the packets not being forwarded even when
I have enabled forwarding ? Is this fixed in a later patch ? Thanks
in advance.

From the man page:

SECURITY ISSUES
       Since  Minicom  runs  setuid  root,  you  probably want to
       restrict access to it. This is possible by using a config-
       uration  file  in the same directory as the default files,
       called "minicom.users". The syntax of this file is as fol-
       lowing:

            <username> <configuration> [configuration...]

       To  allow user 'miquels' to use the default configuration,
       enter the following line into "minicom.users":

            miquels dfl

       If you want users to be able to use more than the  default
       configurations, just add the names of those configurations
       behind the user name. If no configuration is given  behind
       the  username, minicom assumes that the user has access to
       all configurations.

From my file /etc/minicom.users:  
# Sample of "minicom.users" (should be in /etc)
# Format :  User name line [line..]
# Minicom saves it's setup information in /etc/minirc.dfl.
# Dfl is default. So normally, everyone should have a default entry.
# 
#
# Who may use minicom?

You're correct, but your reasoning is slightly flawed :)  The 256K of
secondary cache (or however much) is accessed at 33MHz, not at the
66MHz that is internal to the processor.  The *only* thing you can
access at 66MHz is the 8K of primary cache that's on the chip itself.

Nor have I.  I have reveived Email from Mohan regarding this situation,
and I will say that your statements are warranted given what you were
told.  However, I must say that the information that you were given
was indeed misrepresentative:

>Btw, stating someone asked for an account, for the password file, or

I read the email in question.  I must say that until we see some hard
facts on this matter, we *should not* try to make any character judgments.
(We shouldn't be making character judgments anyway... that's not what
this is about.)

>Anyway, given these statements, I felt it warranted a warning about
>the shadow-mk package; I was not alone in this.

Yes, based on what email you received, your actions were somewhat warranted.
However, a bit more research would have been nice.  This entire incident
may have been avoided.  Emailing Mohan requesting source for login.secure
and compilation options used could have been done to verify the origin
of login.secure, and subsequently, a post updating the shadow-mk packe
could have been made.

>If, in fact, my remarks are interpreted by you and others to be an
>unfounded "character assassination", I apologize to Mohan Kokal.

I think that no apology from you is necessary, after reading the other
email.  However, the third party (whose name I will also not divulge),
does have some work to do to support his position.  For one thing, he
bases some of his argument on behavior observed on IRC.  Well, I'm
sorry, but IRC is such an easy medium to spoof that I would not trust
it.  Anyone with a half-hour's time can edit the source to his or her
client and "be" someone else.  Not secure in the slightest.  

(Please, I don't wish to be labeled as bragging about breaking system
security now!  I'm pointing out widely known fact!  :-) 

Also, this person makes some other incredible claims.  I really think
that he should probably review his position and his system, and then
realize that he is indeed mistaken.  Perhaps someone should refer him
to some good papers on system security, and even the "COPS" package.
The insight may allow him to make a better determination of what his
system is doing, and may ease his mind.

Date: Fri, 9 Sep 1994 19:33:32 GMT

Ah yes, another help me request.

I was given a Wangtek 5099EN Tape Drive with a PC-36 I controller card.
I read in the scsi-howto that it should work, but (as per normal) it
wont even detect the drive on boot up. 

When the kernel boots  I get messages along the lines of
        Wangtek qic02 irq 5, dma 1, 300  
        Setting buffers
        Failed setting

This is inaccurate but unfortunately the machine is 20 miles away from
here so I cant check it until monday. While these messages come up
during bootup (Probing for the card?) the Tape drive grunts.   

Then the scsi devices are probed for, and it grunts again. 

The machine boots normally and there are no problems except no device in
/dev will access the tape. (not surprisingly if it cant find it).

The drive does work under a commonly known boot sector virus called
Ms-Dog. I followed all instructions in the scsi-howto on what to do if
things go wrong. I fiddled the irq's, the dma's, and the memory
addresses all in a vain attempt to get it to work. 

Documentation? Like I said I was given it by an old man. DDocumentation
is limited to a couple of grubby stapled sheets describing jumper
locations. If anyone actually has one of these or recognises my problem,
I would be very grateful  if they could email me any suggestions.

Thanks,
        Don

Date: Fri, 9 Sep 1994 12:21:05 GMT

Attempting to move from using a boot floppy to LILO 0.14 under Slackware
2.0.0 (kernel 1.0.9) I found my system hanges executing /etc/rc.serial!
There is infact a note in /etc/rc.S (at the point where rc.serial is
called) that some systems will hang at that point.  I had NO problems
when using from the boot floppy generated by "make zdisk" or if
/etc/rc.serial is NOT called (2 standard COMs, 14.4K Internal & STB 4COM).
I did find a work-around of changing the line near the top of
/etc/rc.serial to explicitly enumerate ONLY the serial ports that my
system has instead of the double levels of wild-cards.  For example I
currently have the "PORTS" line reading:

     PORTS=`echo cua0 cua1 cua2 cua4 cua5 cua6`

which seems to do fine on my system.  Was hoping someone else might have
an explaination or better solution?

Subject: X doesn't work anymore !?
Date: 8 Sep 1994 17:27:08 GMT

Hello everybody,

I have a strange problem : X just stopped wworking today, and I have
not made any changes in it's configuration :-(
The symptoms are:
- The server starts alright, displaying it's grey screen and the mouse
 (but the mouse does'nt move if I try it)
- The window manager (I tried mwm and fvwm, same thing) starts too,
  and it opens an xterm as usually, BUT

nothing works from then: no mouse (unless I kill selection before to
start X) and no keyboard (and what should I kill for it :-)) at all!
The only thing I can do from then is switching to another vc, but the
X screen remains. And I don't have to use Ctrl+Alt to switch : Alt
alone is enough. Sound's like the keyboard doesn't know I'm under X.

I admit some things changed since the last time I used X: I changed my
IP number and I changed some dip switches on my Soundblaster card.
That's all.
I tried to change back the Soundblaster config, I tried to use an old
kernel as I made some changes in the new one according to the new
soundblaster config, nothing changes: X just doesn't want to work
anymore.

I get no error message from the X server, no error message in either
syslog and message.. Nothing. And if I switch to the vc from which I
started X and hit ctrl-c, X stops just fine, restoring the screen as
usually.

I'd really appreciate any hint or any direction to go to find what
happens, because I'm completely confused by this one :-(

: perl/csh/whatever script that writes a log entry and then executes the real
: telnet/ftp/rlogin command.  

Sorry, this doesn't work. Everyone who can run your script
can execute the 'real' telnet/ftp/rlogin command. 
The log-files must be either worldwritable or you need
a log program that has SU(G)ID on execution or you run a logdeamon
which can be connected by a logclient .
In all three cases everyone can generate logentries that does not 
coincidence whit those events that you want to log. In first case
everyone can substitute the contend of the logfile by something
others.

Ciao, David

Subject: Serial Link w/ 2 Linux Hosts
Date: 9 Sep 1994 12:48:10 GMT

I'm trying to setup a serial link between 2 linux boxes.  Box "a" has an
ethernet card and works fine with kernel 1.1.18.  Box "b" does not have an
ethernet card and is running kernel 1.0.9.

|-------| Serial   |-------| ethernet |----------|
|   b   |==========|   a   |==========| ethernet |
|-------|          |-------|          |----------|

I am using known good serial cables, and I have a serial tester on the
link showing that everyting appears to be good.  I can cat a file into
/dev/cua0 on box "b" and see a transfer occuring on the line.  I can cat
a file into /dev/cua1 on box "a" and see a transfer.  So the ports and
lines appear to be fine.

So I tried using slattach and ifconfig to get a serial point-to-point link
going.  Machine "b" will send ping requests to machine "a" (as seen on the
serial line tester), but machine "a" will not send pings to machine "b".

Next I tried using dip to setup a link, thinking that I may have used
slattach incorrectly.  I started it with 'dip -t' and used this:

get $locip <ipnumber of machine>  /* these are both unique numbers, so */
get $rmtip <ipnumber of other machine> /* there isn't an IP conflict */
port cuax  /* either 0 or 1 depending on which machine I was on */ 
databits 8
stopbits 1
parity none
mode SLIP

I checked both ifconfig and route and everything looks ok.  Does anyone see
a problem here?  Is there a problem with 1.1.18 and serial links?

Thanks,
Andrew
