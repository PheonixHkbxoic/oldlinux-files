I have a program that i want to execute every 5 minutes, if, and only if,
i have a slip connection up.  at present, i have a script which makes the
slip connection, then executes the following:

while [ 1 = 1 ]
do
  getpop
  sleep 300
done

1) is there a better way?

2) how can i kill a bunch of programs - i.e., how can i write a
script that gets the pids of a bunch of programs, then kills 'em?

        There's a s-linux.h file in newspak.

Subject: [Q] No route to host?
Date: 3 Sep 1994 10:14:02 GMT

I'm having some problems when trying to reach certain sites. If I ping,
I get a "No route to host" error message. When I traceroute, I see the
hops all the way to the target host and then it times out. One specific
such site is autodesk.com. When I asked my network provider sysadm, he,
obviously, said the problem is "at the other end" and the conversation
died right there.

Question: Where do I find more about all this routing that goes on 
between sites? How to debug a routing problem? And finally, how to send 
a bag of rotten cabbage to your sysadm through email? :)

Perhaps one of your programs dealing with mail can't run safely setuid root and
so need to be setgid to group mail (or daemon). In this case you need to "chgrp"
the mail boxes to mail. I advice you to set the "setgid" flag of your spool as
well so new mailboxes will get created with ownership to group mail.

Maybe put it in CRON ? like this:

0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55  * * * * /home/foo/.bin/nettest host
And in nettest file test with ping utility if the host responds, if
not, execute the script that brings up slip connection.

#!/bin/sh
ps wxa | grep "slip"| awk '{ print $1 }' > /tmp/$$
kill -9 `cat /tmp/$$`
rm /tmp/$$

This for example finds anything with *slip* in it from ps and kills
them.

Problem:
_setutent: Can't open utmp file: No such file or directory.

Your libc is looking for utmp in a different place than where you have
it.  It will either be /etc/utmp or /var/adm/utmp, depending on what
you have in <paths.h>.  Check the _PATH_UTMP macro in this file, and
touch utmp in either /etc or /var/adm depending on what is defined.

Not sure how the 8900CL differs from the 8900C, but I had an 8900C and it
was truly pathetic.  Its speed was fine in DOS, but under Windows, OS/2,
and Linux/X it was horrible.  Scrolling in an xterm or shell window took
forever, and shot the CPU meter through the roof.  I now have an Orchid
Fahrenheit 1280+ with 1 Meg and an S3 chip, and I scroll like blazes
without affecting the CPU at all.  It does have that font bug (I'm still
running XFree 2.0), but I hardly care.  I use restorefont from SVGAlib
and I have no trouble.  The card cost me about $150 mail order, and that
was almost a year ago.  I'm talking ISA here in both cases, on a 486DX33.
I get about 58,000 xstones now, which is more than 10 times as many as
I got with the Trident.

If there exists an FAQ answer sheet, a HOWTO, or some other document, which
explains this subject, *please* tell me where it is.

Otherwise, please help!

I want to install Linux on a server/client network at a university in South
America. The clients are 386s without hard drives, they boot from floppies and
attach to the 1Gbyte fileserver (which is a 486) using Novell netware. The
cards are NE2000. What would be great is to put Linux on a partition on the
fileserver and create boot floppies for the clients so that they can boot off
that partition and become diskless Linux workstations. Is this possible?
If so, I would be really grateful for some pointers, to the relevant software
(maybe included the Slackware distribution?) or documentation.
Steve.

P.S. I am not there yet but will be taking Slackware 2.0 (including XFree86) on
a bunch of floppies.

I have a Trident 8900CL card, and the configuration automatically

Has anyone calculated those magic numbers for the trident card,
so it will run 1024x768 256 colours (and the motif manager is pannable)??

I heard there is a 50pg document on how to calculate it.  It would
be must easier if someone has done this already.

Hi!
After having some not locatingable trouble with my SCSI-HD, I want to cp
some files from the new installation (SCSI) to my old one (IDE) in order
to use this until problems are solved. I used find -atime to check which
files I had changed in these days. Suddenly the system crashes as several
times before :-( But now the kernel was able to write a message
"Kernel panic: EXT2-fs panic (device 8/2): ext2_find_entry: buffer head pointer
is NULL" So I think the bug must be found either in the NCR_Driver or in
the Ext2. I am using Linux 1.1.47.
What would you recommend in order to work with my SCSI-HD ?

I recently set up a linux server on my mostly Mac network at my office
(which is also my home). I was thinking about getting a higher speed
link to the Internet and the most practical alternative seems to be
ISDN.

I can get an ISDN line from my local phone company (BellSouth) for
about $60 per month. I don't know what the total hardware costs would
be. 

What is required to set up an ISDN line with linux? Does the necessary
software exist? What would be the necessary hardware?
