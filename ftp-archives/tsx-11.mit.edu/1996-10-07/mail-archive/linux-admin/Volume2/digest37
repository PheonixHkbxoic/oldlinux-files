I have read the man pages, tinkered a bit with settings, etc. and still
have not been able to restrict other users on our net who are logged in
as ``root'' from getting super user NFS priviledges on my box. (I, mean
how can you have anything private like, *ahem*, a collection of gifs
safe from prying eyes ;-)

Here's my /etc/exports file:

#
# exports       This file describes which parts of the local file

#               with the NFS system.  It is used by "mountd".

Get yourself the newest Term-HOWTO on sunsite. There it is described how to
 arrange this. If yoiu cannot find it let me know. I can send you a copy of
it. In that case just tell me in what form you want to have it(ascii, postscript, latex).

This is beside the point. What if it is ABSOLUTELEY essential that
several people have root privileges?  You can't run a medium sized
site without having more than one person with root access. I'm not
saying every user should be doing work with uid = 0 all the time, but
what do you do when your administrator decides to go hitch-hiking in
the Gobi desert for a week or two?

So how is this less dangerous? Using su means several people have to
know root's password -- not a nice situation. I think this is what the
original poster was also trying to avoid.

Several people have complained that confusion will reign or that you
will run into serious trouble if several users have the same ID. So
far NO ONE has pointed out a real problem, except for the bug (IMHO)
in the passwd program. What IS the problem?

    There is some software available for this, but I have found a quick 
way to monitor access is to login as that user and then press the up 
arrow key.  Keep pressing it, and it will show you all of the commands 
that the particular user executed in their last session.  Of course it 
will not monitor what they did in different editors, and mail programs, 
but it is better than nothing.

Right. But there is a directive 'directory' in named.boot file calling

I have another question. How to tell named which DNS's should it ask if it

Subject: Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs
Date: 8 Sep 1994 08:32:00 GMT


I need to ask your help again in this embarrassing booting problem of mine.
Here is a more detailed description of it.

-ari   ;-(



The Pentium machine has a 1 GB SCSI disk that was partitioned as:
1) MS-DOS (C disk)   123 MB                   /dev/sda1
2) MS_DOS (D disk)   150 MB                   /dev/sda5
3) Linux tmp         200 MB                   /dev/sda6
4) Linux root        500 MB                   /dev/sda7
5) Linux swap         30 MB                   /dev/sda8


The original DOS partitioning (123/880) was done by the PC distributor.

The DOS D disk was never used and was obviously not properly configured
from the view of DOS because it prevented installation of some DOS software.
So I removed the logical drive D (DOS FDISK showed the EXT partition size
was 880 MB and the D disk held 150 MB). After this little oparation
the DOS problems disappeared but linux does not boot at all.


The boot msg when booting with LILO: linux root=/dev/sda<n>, where n=3-8:

....
Partition check:
sda: sda1 sda2 < >
MINIX-fs: unable to read superblock
EXT-fs: unable to read superblock

Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 08:0n   (n=3-8)

One of the last two Dr. Dobbs' Journal has an article expressly on writing
a print filter in C for the LaserJet 4M, including printcap entry.  You
may want to check that out.  Although he developed it under SunOS, he
explicitly mentions Linux as another place it can be used.

I tried to compile/run Alex on my very small Linux box (386DX/40, 8MB RAM,

It worked after several changes in script files, due to slow line (38kbps)
I could only ls something. Sorry, but I can't remember any details - it was
some time ago.

You'd better place it to Your private .xinitrc file. This is much better.

Nothing. Maybe it could be seen on text screen under X (use Ctrl-Alt-F1 to

I think that there are mainly two methods :

partition map before lilo installation (normally, in /boot directory, if you
are slackware and FSSTND)
- more basically, if you want to boot dos and your dos version is higher
than 5.0 you can try at the dos prompt : fdisk /MBR . This command replaces
your current MasterBootRecord with the DOS one.

(all of that is explained clearly in the file :
