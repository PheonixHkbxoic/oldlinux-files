Subject: Compile kernel Failure!-Install Linux on IDE drive with 1571 cylinders.
Date: 1 Sep 1994 21:52:02 GMT

        Hi, 
        I am a newbie in Linux world, and bought a couple of CDROMs of 
        slackware (Linux 1.0) from Trans-Ameritech Release 3, April 1994. 
        I have trouble to utilize my 810MB IDE hard-drive, and I would appreciate much some help from you.
                
        Here are some data of my setup: 
                Master Drive 1 IDE ---C drive -325MB -DOS
                Slave Drive 2 IDE  ---810MB 

        I tried to split the 810MB into frist part 300MB for DOS, and 510MB for
        linux native. First, I use DOS fdisk to creat an extended 300 MB for DOS. And linux installation were done by boot and root disks. Because Linux default maximum # of cylinders is 1024 and I extended it to 1571 by using 'x' option under fdisk. Subsequently, I created two linux native partitions on the rest of the 810MB disk. Here is a summary when typing 'p':
                begin           end     bytes
/dev/hdb1/      2       2       611     307440  5 extended
/dev/hdb2/      612     612     644     16632   83 linux native
/dev/hdb3       645     645     1571    467208  83      linux native    
/dev/hdb5       2       2       611     307408+ 6       DOS 16 +>32M


        Everything seems happy until I installed LILO and tried to boot from 
Hard drive /dev/hda. The kernel won't boot even though I can boot it from the 
floppy (made after setup everything). Therefore, I decided to recompile the kernel to follow the usual way. It failed and the message is:

        geo_comp_addr:cylinder number is too big(1522> 1023)

        If I run LILO in linux, I got the same message.

        Would you somebody suggest me either to patch something to  the Kernel and/or find another way to get around? 

                Thanks you very much.

Hi everyone,

this sounds like a FAQ, but I didn't find any hint in all the HOWTOs, FAQs,
and manpages:

What MTU should one choose for a SLIP link using recent 1.1.* kernels?
What is the maximum value, and what is a good choice?


thank you in advance,
Erik

I *STRONGLY* recommend the "xkeycaps" utilities by Jamie Zawinsky
(jwz@lucid.com). It's very convenient and allow you to create a personal
modmap (to be used by xmodmap in .xinitrc) for a lot of various keyboard, even
French ! ;-)

The latest version seems to be 2.22 and is available at lucid.com:/pub/hacks.

Hope (sure) this will help,

You are wrong. Term versions 1.x only had TCP. Starting with version 2.0.0 now also UDP is available.

It can't go forward without doing more disk harm. It can't go back - so it
stops the task dead. Fix your disk problem and the rest will be ok. On a 
corrupt disk you can either crash, corrupt the disk, or stop the task ...

Maybe this is a dumb question, but folks please bear with me. I upgraded my
kernel from 1.0.9 to 1.1.18 and when booting, at the time when the kernel is
being uncompressed I get a message saying memory is tight. Also a free shows
6772k as available memory.

I have 8 Meg and Linux reputedly needs only 2M for a barebones setup. Then why
do I get the warning at boot? And whatever happened to the (8192 - 6772)K of
memory? 

Maybe this may not be of interest to too many people here, so I'd be grateful
if you could reply via email, to save some bandwidth.

Thanks!

One of the thins to make sure of there is no card in your pc using the
same interrupt, ethernet cards ar notorious for this.

I had the same problem when I had an ethernet card in my box , since this
card locks the interrupt( inside the kernel), the serial driver can't use it.
Hence the port can't be used. I solved the problem giving the ethernet card
an other intterupt.
The same principle applies for other cards aswell of course.

What you do is to run TERM instead, which lets you run as many connections to
your remote machine as you want. Download the term sources from sunsite, and
compile on both your Linux box and school account. Then follow the instructions
supplied to get them talking.
With a fast modem you can even run X-windows things over term, but for multiple
logins you are better with several local x-terms and trsh in each.

Tcp wrapper only logs incoming calls.

Subject: Still can't use my 3C503 card even if it is probed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

First, thanks to anyone who sent clues about this. Unfortunately, I am still
getting the same SIOCADDRT: Invalid Argument even when my card is probe at
0x310 with its correct eth address and AFTER having NetKit-A-0.xx.tar.gz and
NetKit-B-0.xx.tar.gz installed with a NEW kernel 1.1.45. (I have been said
that the one in the distribution on sunsite is obsolete). 
[Reference: for this article is <a href="news:1994Aug30.123401.14546@mixcom.mixcom.com">here</a>. 

What seems strange to me is that the package is from sunsite.unc.edu and I have
re-installed everything from scratch with no problem (except this one). 

What makes me feel bad is that I have installed it TRHU NFS with this card...
Yes, I repeat, I did it booting the net disk from the slackware distribution.
And it worked.

[Is it possible to generate a vmlinuz or zImage from this diskette using dd
for example ? At least, I could put this machine up again.]

I have compile and the network is up fine with the same kernel/distrib BUT a 3C509 card


PLEASE HELP HELP HELP HELP HELP HELP HELP HELP HELP HELP HELP HELP HELP HELP


Thanks

Have you checked that it is still working on the other machine ?
The company I work for have several Exabytes, and there is nothing but
problems with them. They are in for repairs all the time and some of the
symptoms sound like that -> reporting present, but not doing its duty.
These Exabytes are run on Suns.

I can understand why you got it so cheap (grin).

/usr/lib/news/bin/maint/addgroup aa.bb.cc y 

This is no Linux-specific problem, however.

Subject: Linux as a firewall?
Date: 2 Sep 1994 01:10:07 GMT

        Does anyone out there have a Linux machine set up as a firewall?  I am
currently trying to set up one at the company I'm working at.  I have a Linux
machine set up with two net cards and I have gotten the kernel to recognise
both cards.  I have set up the static routing so one card will only see our
gateway to the internet while the other will see our subnet.  My question is:
how do you filter the packets so we only allow outgoing ftp's and telnet
sessions and allow mosaic and mail both ways?  Is there software availible to
do this?  Is this even possible?

Talk to me,

Subject: What is login.secure from shadow-mk package?
Date: 2 Sep 1994 01:43:57 GMT


Just was about to update my shadow programs (compiling the shadow-mk
package by Mohan Kokal, which is the 3.3.2 sources), when before the
install I noticed something funny.

Here's the snippet from the Makefile where login is installed:

        install -m4755 login $(LOGINDIR)/_login
        install -m4711 login.secure $(LOGINDIR)/login
        
Hm, seems that login in installed as _login, and another binary,
login.secure is installed as login. What's funny is, the package has
no sources for login.secure.  This binary was never in the
shadow-3.n.n packages, and in this package is never referred to in
any README's.
So how secure can it be that there are no sources.
Just asking.

Subject: Xgas slow with stationary mouse
Date: 2 Sep 1994 01:45:12 GMT

I'm clueless as to the following phenomenon.

When I run xgas (animated simulation of an ideal gas) under X, the
molecules and time counter only move _FAST_ when I keep the mouse in
motion.  As soon as I let the mouse rest, it's _SLOW_ for both.
(Temp. is 500K). Running on a 486DX66/16.

Any intelligent thoughts?
