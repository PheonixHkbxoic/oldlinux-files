Hmmm...  I'll have to try to see what ncftp does with nested directories,
but when I last grabbed the entire slackware tree, it was with

mget a? ap? x? d? xap? ... (etc) 

after I made the directories.  grabbed entire wild-carded directories that
way.  I do know that if you do an mget a1, and the a1 directory doesn't
already exist, ncftp just troughs it in the current directory.

        We experienced a similar problem with named . It would simply stop
servicing requests after a time. We solved this by moving to a newer version
of named (4.9.?) and disabling nslookup. It seems that nslookup was causing
most of the problems. Debugging output from named showed it going into
a loop of some sort when nslookup was run.

Did you look at the syslogd output? It is written to the local2.warn
location. The log should show that it runs the ip-up script as well as
the termination code if it could not be started unless it was simply
ENOENT ("there is no ip-up file").

No, it is always executed.

There is a pending problem with the ip-up and ip-down scripts/programs
with the 2.1.2a version of the code. These scripts inherit the file
handles for the stdin/stdout/stderr and if you redirected them to the
tty device before running pppd, then you can confuse the peer process
should the programs write to stdout/stderr. A solution is to include
the following on each of the commands:

      >/dev/null 2>&1

This will cause the output to be redirected to the null device.

This problem is corrected in the next version of the daemon code.

So, change 'route' (which normally does not generate output unless
there is an error) to be:

 route add -net 10.200.0.0 gw 10.202.23.1 netmask 255.255.0.0 >/dev/null 2>&1

Why are run running 'ifconfig'? There should not need to be a reason
to run ifconfig against the ppp device. You are free to specify any
value for netmask, IP address, and mtu when you run pppd.

>If ip-up doesn't work, is there another ellegant way to see if the IP is 
>setup (that is chat is finished with logging in etc.)?

I suppose that you could probe for the route to be added or the device
to go up. It is not an elegant solution, but it will work.

try a:

stty erase ^H kill ^C

in .cshrc/.profile

and a file called .Xmodmap in your home directory with the line:

keycode 22 = BackSpace

that should fix the backspace problem.


as for the shutting X down stuff, /etc/inittab determines what VCs are active
in a runlevel of 6.  Slackware 2.0 comes setup with VC6 the only VC with
getty running on it, however all the boot information still goes to VC1,
which is usually the same as /dev/console.

Oops, I'm an idiot, I meant the BIOS password and not the boot password.

You are in luck - I hope - I had the same problem - swapped
everything - but one part.  The keyboard.   Swapped the keyboard 
and never had the problem again, except when I put that keyboard back 
in.  

This machine was standalone - so I always thought it was hung 
but really it would not accept anything but switching of VCs.

Switch the keyboards and hopefully things will work.
I troubleshooted this problem for about a month - what
a pain.

If you dont have an extra  keyboard just run top in a VC
and switch to that VC when you think the machine is hung, if 
top never updates then you may have another problem.

The reason it "responds" to pings is that you are actually sometimes pinging
a different machine, depending on who's arp responce gets out first.  However,
whoever is using your IP address is not running a system you can log into 
(probably a DOS/Windows or Macintosh box).

When you are on another machine, pinging your machine/the other machine, you
can use the "arp" command to find the ethernet address that you are pinging 
(assuming you are pinging within the same subnet!).  You should see that at 
the times that "your" machine refuses connections, the ethernet address is
not your ethernet address.  (Linux tells you what your ethernet address is
on bootup, so check your logs or reboot to find your address.)

Hope this helps!  We had a similar problem when a fellow here set his linux
box to the same IP address as his Mac Quadra.

I'd like to know why i'm forced to run ifconfig and route commands before

I think this is interesting.. After I run dip I run route and see no routes,
check ifconfig and its only set to localhost, not my IP address.

So if i run ifconfig and route after dip, all works fine.

I just installed slackware2.0 (morseCDROM) kernel rev 1.0.9
