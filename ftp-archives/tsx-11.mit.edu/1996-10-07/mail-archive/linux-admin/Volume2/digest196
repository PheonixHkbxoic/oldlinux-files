: : Raj

I didn't have 'religious wars' in mind when starting this thread. I only
wanted to know if there will be an update that uses XFree86 3.1 libs.
It's a technical problem for me - I want to use X11R6 features within the
Motif environment. As X11R5 apps still work (and I've got an awful lot of
them since I update my system no more than once a year) and as I don't want
to recompile them all, I don't see the point in maintaining X11R5 sharedlibs.
It's a pity that I have to wait even longer ... in the meantime, I'll
do X11R6 testing with Athena widgets.

For what I've tested myself, I can compile Motif apps with X11R6 includes;
but when linking, I have to use the 'old' R5 libs. And I don't see any
reason why Motif apps (or any old X11R5 apps) shouldn't compile with R6
includes - R4 apps compile with R5 includes very well, and added entrys
withing the include file usually don't make troubles - just changed entrys.

But there's one major problem that should be fixed (somehow). With Metrolink
Motif, there came the mxmkmf script that correctly called imake with Motif
templates. This no longer works for me. I don't know enough about configuring
imake, I'm just using it, so please could someone point me out what to do ?

Hey guys: don't just flame Metrolink - I'm more angry about the Slackware
distribution originator. Why the hell does he have to create such a chaos
like /usr/X11, /var/X11 -> ../../X11, /usr/X386 -> X11, and so on ?
This difference /usr <-> /var and the gigantic amount of softlinks between
these dirs cost me half a day to clean up; I just don't want to install
X11R6 (Xfree86 3.1) in /usr/X11 when I still need Xfree86 2.x; but when I
wanted to make sure X11R6 stuff is used preferably, I had to recurse all these
subtrees to delete unecessary things - I now think it would have been easier
to remove all X11R5 stuff, then setup X11R6 and after that, untarring the
needed files from X11R5 to /tmp and selecting the necessary things - But
how should I know before ?

One more thing:
Is there already a release date for Motif 2.0 ?

ok, I've got to go now, it's lunch time -- see you on monday.

Yes, I know this is subject to another thread, but I couldn't find it at the
moment, and wanted to get this posted.

My problem seems slightly different though.

The lines out are as fast as you can possible wish, but as soon as I try to
telnet in to the machine it goes SLOOW. People have been telnetting into the
machine, and stopped at the login for five minutes. If I check locally, they
are logged in, but they are still stuck on the login-screen.

Anybody know what it could be? Or perhaps how to solve it at least?
A friend said it might be better if I bought more memory. Reflections?

Any help in the matter gratefully accepted.

I am interested in undertaking a programmable LCD project, perhaps using /dev/lcd

Subject: Absurd backup problem with tar
Date: 12 Oct 1994 13:09:40 GMT

Well, we have a net setup here, and I want to make a backup using tar.
tar clvf woody:/dev/rmt1 /usr
will do the trick. Mostly. It will refuse to work if I'm super user,
but of course, if I'm not, I cannot necessarily read all the files.

The problem lies with /usr/bin/rsh, which will require a password when
logging in as super user (interactively) or just fail (non-interactively,
as in
rsh woody pwd

Now is there a possibility of getting this to work? At the moment, I have
made a file /usr/ucb/rsh (first place tar looks) which is just root
executable and has
exec su nobody -c "exec /usr/bin/rsh $*"
in it. Somewhat of a weak solution. Anybody know any better one?

Ugly. Either something's broken or your kernel is really too big (are we
already at that point again ?). Maybe leaving out some non-essential
device drivers and other kernel features would shrink it to a more
reasonable size.

> What is this really telling me?

This tells you that LILO thinks your kernel would be too big to load.
Either LILO is wrong or what it thinks is the kernel isn't or the
(compressed) kernel is really bigger than half a megabyte. (Re-building
the kernel and examining the paths listed in /etc/lilo.conf should help
eliminating the first two (unlikely) possibilities.)

Has anybody seen this problem too ? Is it time to finally start the
heavy rewrite to run LILO in protected mode ? :-(

> Do I need to leave more room before defining partition 1.

No, that's not a failing copy operation. LILO typically only allocates
a few kB of disk space.

When I use more then 16 heads in my BIOS CMOS setup it hangs before

When laying out your Linux partitions, consider your 'distribution'
guidelines.... For example, Yggdrasil suggests a dedicated
root partition WITHOUT installation modified files as their
upgrade to next release assumes they can reinstall the whole
root partition but preserve the others.  If you are installing
with your own download or another distribution this may not
apply.

:Yes, it sure is.  I am all so looking into ISDN and Linux..

Definately cheaper than 56Kbps, but still quite expensive all things  
considered.  First, you need to install an ISDN line.  The installation  
charges run anywhere from "normal line installation" to special install  
charges.  Southwestern Bell charges ~$585 (they have a special going right  
now for ~$94 install, but it will go back up on Oct. 24).  Second, you'll  
need (in the US) an NT1.  This device is supplied by the telephone company in  
_other_ countries (outside the US), but in the US it is customer supplied  
equipment.  Prices range from ~$200 to $700.  (See below for a suggestion...)   
Next, you will need to purchase an ISDN "terminal adaptor" (T/A).  The T/A  
can be anything from an ISDN ready phone, to an ISDN bridge, to an adaptor  
card for your PC.  It simply connects a device to the ISDN line.  Some T/A's  
even include the NT1 (of course, they cost extra for the luxury...).  T/As  
range from ~$600 on up to several thousand.  After you have all the  
equipment, you will need to purchase a connection to an Internet provider.   
In _most_ cases, they will provide you with a "dedicated" dialup (kind of  
defeats the purposed of "dialup") dialup line (i.e., your _own_ phone number  
to call for the service).  Many of these will only allow you to connect on a  
single "B" channel as well.  Given that you will (basically) be the only one  
using your dialup line -- you should expect to pay the full cost of the  
provider's ISDN service (for that line), plus their markup.  Some of them  
cost as little as ~$100 (for a single-site line -- where you only get 1 IP  
address assigned to you) to ~$400 for a full Internet feed (say from "PSI",  
for example).

:
:Yes, You will get a NT1 card and power supply.  The bell's do not supply
:line power in the USA for ISDN.  I think, in other counties they do.
:
:If you are running BRI (Bacis Rate Interface) That is what most home users
:have.  You will Need a NT1 card for your computer that will connect to the
:U interface that you RBOC will install. plus the power for the NT1..

The NT1 converts the 2-wire "U" interface provided by the RBOC (Regoinal Bell  
Operating Company), to a 4-wire S/T interface used by the T/A.  The T/A is  
simply the equipment on your side that connects to the ISDN line (as stated  
before: it can be a phone, bridge, adaptor card, etc.)

As for needing a "card" to do ISDN over Linux -- a simpler solution would be  
to use an _already_ supported Ethernet card and buying an ISDN-Ethernet  
bridge to the remote network.  Then the Linux box _never_ has to know that it  
is talking over ISDN.  As far as Linux is concerned, it _only_ has to talk  
"Ethernet"...  Of course, it would probably depend a great deal on what your  
Internet provider can offer...

:>       I get two "B" channels. Does one ISDN card only use one "B" 
:>channel? Can I use another ISDN card to have two 64K links to my service 
:>provider (assuming I pay them twice)?
:>
:
:No, The NT1 will use both B Channels as well as the D channel.
:With this you can have one link to your provider and be talking on your 
:ISDN Digital phone each on one B (64KPS) channel while downing a file
:from your local BBS on the D 16 kps or (9600 or 14.4 modem speed) channel.

The NT1 doesn't really _do_ anything useful (as far as the user is  
concerned).  It is _purely_ to convert the wiring to an appropriate spec for  
use with the T/A.

As stated before, the Internet provider (or remote site) you use will dictate  
how many "B" channels you can use.  For example, we have some Combinet  
Ethernet to ISDN bridges here, we connect to a remote site.  We have the  
bridges configured to "dynamically" dial the remote system on the first "B"  
channel when "more than 0 (zero) bytes are received".  Then, when we are  
receiving more than 48Kbps for 10 seconds, we have it automatically start up  
the second channel (it automatically does load balancing and multiplexing).   
This configuration was intrinsic to the Combinet bridges (but most of the  
ISDN-Ethernet bridges we've seen do the same stuff).

As for using the 'D' channel for "modem-like" speeds...  The "D" (Delta)  
channel is used to control the connection (initiate, tear-down, setup, etc.).   
In other words, when you attempt to call from one ISDN T/A to some other  
phone number, the phone number you are trying to reach is sent in a packet  
through the "D" channel.  The remote side (if it is ISDN) recieves the  
incomming connection request on its "D" channel.  Then both sides agree to  
open a "B" channel for voice or data.  It is possible to have the phone  
company setup X.25 (Packet switched data) connections through the "D"  
channel, but it requires an X.25 PAD and some other specialized equipment.   
In the U.S., it would probably cost significantly more to get this  
configuration "workable"...  So I doubt it would be worth it (also, you'd  
have to get someone else to setup for receiving X.25 packet-switched data.

:
:Look over on comp.telcom.isdn or something like that.
:I have a WWW address but, can not remember it right now.
:I think you can gopher bellcore as well.

The _best_ ISDN site I've found (in the U.S.) is "Dan Kegel's ISDN Home Page"
(found at: http://alumni.caltech.edu/~dank/isdn/).  It is a fairly  
comprehensive list of ISDN equipment, FAQs, and other WWW home pages.

Now, a little tidbit of _useful_ information:  IBM is selling a device called  
the: "IBM 7845 Network Terminator Extended" (found on Dan Kegel's home  
page...).  This device is an NT1, plus a couple of _neat_ features.  First,  
it is an NT1, and it only costs $350 (about $120 more than the cheapest NT1  
I've found so far).  So it provides the same features as the standard NT1.   
Next, it provides ISDN-Analog (POTS) line conversion.  This means that you  
can hook-up your standard house-wiring to the device and use your standard  
analog telephones (the one's you've always used).  Third, it provides some  
"special" telco tricks: Speed dialing, last number re-dial, call hold, return  
last incoming call, call waiting, call retrieve, three-to-six way  
conferencing, etc.  Finally, it has a battery back-up system, that provides  
18hours of "standby" (i.e., wait for a call), or 6-hours "off-hook" use.

So, you can hook your ISDN T/A to one output wiring system, and hookup your  
house telephone system to the other.  You get _both_ ISDN and POTS service.   
This is _not_ a commercial, I am just excited about the possibility of such a  
device.

Symbolic links are what makes Linux (and every other Unix) behave sanely with a
variety of programs which expect different paths.  For example, /usr/bin is
linked to /usr/bsd because on some machines certain programs are located only
in /usr/bsd.  I've seen /var/adm as /usr/adm.  There are many more examples of
this.  Theoretically, the Linux File System Standard dictates the directory
structure, but until we stop having to use software not written specifically
for the Linux directory hierarchy, the symbolic links will have to stay.

Subject: linux bootable on second SCSI-HD
Date: 14 Oct 1994 14:41:36 GMT


Hello ot there,

I'm happily running Linux on my first SCSI-Disk (on sda3, to be true,
with DOS on the first two partitions for those users in our lab that
that can never really QUIT wordperfect and the like). Now, as large
amounts of data are to be expected from a new experimental series,
I will have to move my Linux to a second SCSI HD (using AHA1542).
What I need to know is simply:

How do I make a bootable floppy (the "dd if=zImage of=/dev/fd0 ... style)
which accesses the second drive as / ? Can I use "rdev.... or something ?
I know that I need to reconfigure my *tabs in /etc to mount the whole
fss', but how do I get Linux to start ?

Thanks in advance for your helpful comments !!!
