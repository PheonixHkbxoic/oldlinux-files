Isn't a DX3 an IBM chip?  If AMD used dx3 it would seem that they were cloning
an IBM chip rather than the real Chip.  I thought that dx3s are used in the
blue lightning system?  I am probably way off, but that is not anything new :)

The problem is not with telneting or ftping out from the machine  but with
incoming connections. Not all daemons suffer from it. On my machine it has
been telnet mostly, ftp rarely, sendmail 8.6.9 rarely, routed rarely. INN
never has a problem even though it gets about 60M of news a day.

Why? That's what comp.security.announce is for.  The vast majority of

that linux specific is in /etc or /sbin and a good chunk of that is
generic unix software.

If you recompiled the kernel, you need to run rdev to modify the boot
image so that it mounts the root read-only.

Also, how about adding a .signature with your email address, since
your news post doesn't include a proper email address for you.

Use port address 0x334 for the Adaptec.

According to the code in /usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi/aha1542.c :
        (always the best source of documentation!)

/* The adaptec can be configured for quite a number of addresses, but
I generally do not want the card poking around at random.  We allow
two addresses - this allows people to use the Adaptec with a Midi

static unsigned int bases[]={0x330, 0x334};
 
Hope this helps out.

Hi,
  While I am compressing executables with 'gexe', I have changed permissions
of 'bash' file (shell executable) as 000 such that it will not be compressed
by 'gexe'. Just after compressing all binaries, without rechanging the
permissions of 'bash', I have logged off the system. Now, I am unable to login.
It says 'No-Shell' is vailable (obvious). I tried to login from custom made
boot floopy and also boot/root floppies. But could not succeed. I am using
slackware version. Any ideas how I have to tackle this.

I think that the one reason that we must keep posting security holes
is so that the "good guys" know about them. 

I'll admit, right now I do not run Linux (but I hope to be in a couple
of days).  

But, I don't think that changes the fact that I have to be concerned
about security.  I have allready recorded several attempted
"break-ins" for my system.  Some people just don't expect that I've
set up FTP properly...

But, consider how a security hole is discovered.  Someone, who is most
likely trying to break into a system, discovers it.  I don't know how
they look for them, or how they dream up how to use them, but they do.

This means: HACKERS ARE THE FIRST TO KNOW ABOUT A HOLE!

Naturally, they don't want us (the sysadmins, the "good guys" in the
white hats) to know about it.  If we did, they would have one less
tool with which to break into our systems.

If a hacker is the first to know about a hole in my system, you better
believe that I want to be the second.  The third person I want to know
is the guy who is going to give me the fix.  Since I don't know person
1 and 3, I have to rely on groups like this one to provide me with the
information I need.  

This is gonna cause some flames, but I'll say it anyway...
-->> We have a responsibility as sysadmins to help each other plug
these holes.  If we know of a security hole and don't report it,
aren't we a guilty as those who spread word of the hole so people can
crash systems?

These are just my thoughts.  Wish me luck on installing Linux on my
box.

I have conducted an experiment with TELNET from my LAN PC (running
IBM TCP/IP-DOS and my LINUX machine.  When the LAN PC IP address
was unknown to LINUX it took a *LONG* time to get the LOGIN 
prompt.  I added the IP address to /etc/hosts and bingo, nice
and quick.

YGGDRASIL F/94 uses INETD to launch in.telnetd.  I suspect that
INETD attemps to resolve the IP address to a host name for 
logging or whatever and hence one waits for all the DNS trials,
etc. before the connection to whatever INETD service is requested
procedes.  Could be telnetd, or perhaps *both*.  Might be that
Ygg/fall/94 added this reverse resolution?

Anyway, make sure your LAN PC has a host name known to your
LINUX box *and* the resolution order (DNS or etc/hosts first)
matches where the name is defined.

I had no problem with PINGs so perhaps this is unrelated.

[all stuff deleted]

I don't know for sure if my setup works, but I manage to do:

mt -f /dev/nftape rewind
mt -f /dev/nftape reten
mt -f /dev/nftape erase
tar cvf /dev/nftape files
tar df /dev/nftape files

And I manage to do this with kernel 1.0.9, gcc 2.4.5, ftape-0.9.10.a.tar.gz,
and modutils-0.99.15.tgz, and whatever libraries and linker I have (I can't
tell the version.  They are from Slackware 1.1.0)

I have to admit that I had a lot of problem with /dev/ftape (which is rft0).
There were a lot of warning with rewind, reten, and erase command.  The
warning looks something like this:

fdc-io.c (fdc command) fdc-write timeout, retry

Personally I have some questions about the ftape thing.  First, what are the
valid options for mt besides the above mentioned ones?  Also, what's the
differences with /dev/ftape and /dev/nftape (/dev/rft0 & /dev/nrft0 
respectively).  I also see quite a few scripts on sunsite under system/backup
directory.  Which one is easier for newbie like me?  

BTW, I am using Conner TapeStor 250 with Teac DualDrive on a generic floppy
controller.  Is there any pitfall I have to look out for?  I did remove jumper
6 from the tape drive as the manual suggested.  

Thanks for your input.

May I ask which version of modutil are you using now?  With 0.99.15 modutil,
it will complain whenever I load up ftape.o (something like request_dma()
not defined or something).  And when I tried to compile modules.tar.gz (I
suppose this is the newest one), it complain about something that's undefined
and bomb out with the make process (making insmod).

I did manage to make ftape 0.9.10a and modutil 0.9.15 work together.

BTW, I am running kernel 1.0.9, gcc 2.4.5, and the version of ld that doesn't
accept the -qmagic flag.

It's the 'ifconfig' program that's broken, not the driver.
The 'ifconfig' program only prints the correct information with some
kernels.  It's no big deal because, except for the misleading output, it
still sets the interface up correctly.

(Hasn't this already been posted about a dozen times?)

Most of the "I-hates-sendmail" seems to be centered around the 8.6.9
release.  I've found Sendmail+IDA to be much easier, both in its
installation and config.  Plus, Neil Rickert's rather fast on the
keyboard when it comes to plugging any holes.  Not a bad piece
of work, especially if you're routing mail in and out using
disparite transport mechanisms.
