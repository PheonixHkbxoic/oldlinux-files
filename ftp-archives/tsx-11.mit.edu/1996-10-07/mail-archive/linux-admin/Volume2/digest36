Hello linux people,

the facts:
386dx 25 mhz 5 mb ram 120 md disk 9 mb swap wd8003 ethernet board
dtc avidtek 3151 ncr53c400 scsi board and a nec cdr210 cdrom drive.
linux 1.0.9 with the trantor T130 patch installed (to get the ncr53c400
support) and scsi cdrom iso9660 support.

the scsi board is detected but the cdrom drive isn't. I have heard that
there are problems with the cdr210 drives (they don't have parity if I am
correct). The solution was to compile without parity enabled. Question how
do I do that?

I have tried to move an undef PARITY into the source but that had no
success. I saw the nec entry in the scsicdrom black list in scsi.c. Could a
solution be, to remove the entry??

I have tried anything even the latest kernel I could get my hands on
1.1.45, used the ncr5380 with extra offset 8. this detected my scsi board
also but then started to probe all 6 scsi numbers with no success (cdrom is
at 1 board is at 7).

Help I want to get this cdrom active under linux, so that i can get it
into my exports file and mount it on my amiga 4000 with nfs....

many thanks to anyone who can help....

Subject: [Round #2] How to use rpc.portmap, rpc.mountd, rpc.nfsd?
Date: 7 Sep 1994 17:55:34 -0400

[Q2] Stupid but non-FAQ NFS question #2:
Thanks for the help of finding out the rpc.portmap, rpc.mountd, rcp.nfsd.  
Still, after reading the NFS-FAQ, Linux Network Admin Guide, none of these guys
seem to work at all.  I still get the message of RPC fault: program is not 
registered.  I guess I really need a cookbook example.

Let's say I have machines A and B which both of them can telnet and ftp to each
other.  In other words, they are properly connected.  Now, this is how I did.
I add three statements at the begninning of the rc.inet2 at machine A:

/usr/sbin/rpc.portmap
/usr/sbin/rpc.mountd
/usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd
/bin/mount -t nfs B:/home /mnt

Then, I add /mnt B[rw] at /etc/exports at machine A.
Then, reboot machine A, and it prompts RPC fault: program is not registered.
Can anyone provide me an idiot-proof way of attacking this?  Thanks.
BTW, someone mention "premeter".  What is that?

Subject: Setup Linux as Router To Internet
Date: Wed, 07 Sep 94 11:26:44 PDT


I am trying to setup Linux as a Router to Internet for my local TCP/IP
Novell Netware 4.01 Network. I'l already try SLS 1.05, Yggdrasil, slakware 
2.0... and now try to setup Slakware 2.0 .

What I want :
        - Setup Linux as a router to my Internet provider
        - Setup Linux as DNS, NNTP server, SMTP (???)
        - Setup Gopher server on a Linux

I believe, that someone already did this , please help!

What I have :

        register domain name : monolit.com
        register IP Class-C network : 199.0.30.0

        IP = 165.154.37.71 for (SLIP, PPP connection )
        IP = 165.154.1.1  my DNS, and gateway

Question 1: I don't really understand how it should work :

                I am connected to 165.154.1.1 using SLIP with my 
                IP=165.154.37.71, but for this IP I have different
                hostname and domainname : ntcs.tor.hookup.net !!!

                But when I use WHOIS monolit.com :
                it show that monolit.com : 165.154.37.71 

                I setup Linux with IP=199.0.30.1 for Ethernet
                and IP=165.154.37.71 for SLIP

                I make all routing table. Setup DNS on 199.0.30.1

                So from Linux to Internet DNS works ( I disable hosts)
                and able to ping all local host and outside using
                name instead of IP number, 

                But when someone want to ping my hosts, using FQDN
                only monolit.com is recognized, but when using IP,
                they can ping 199.0.30.2, ..

        Whats wrong ? May be My Internet provider have to changed
        information on DNS (165.154.1.1) ? or this is my fault ?

This is my first major problem right now, the second how to setup
smail to send/recieve mail via SMTP for all local host on the network, but
I think first I have to resolve routing and DNS problem

Well, I've been trying to get SAR V 1.0 and 1.04 working for the same
reasons. SAR 1.0 would make it through the recovery disk generation
phase, but when I actually tried to boot the floppy it made, it would
exit complaining that it couldn't find libc.s0.4 (it was there). I got
version 1.04... It also seemed to successfully generate a boot disk.
While attempting to boot from this disk, it would exit with a message
like child XXXX died with FF00 (where XXXX is a scrolling number 
that just kept incrementing by 1 forever. I let it get to 10,000
before I just rebooted the computer) I would really like to make a
good disaster recovery disk, but SAR seems like a disaster in itself.

Subject: MiroCrystal 16S Xconfig wanted...
Date: Wed, 7 Sep 1994 21:54:32 GMT

Hi there,

I'm looking for an Xconfig file for my MiroCrystal 16S board. It uses an
S3-928 chipset with a Bt485 RAMDAC (VLB). The monitor is a 17" Philips
monitor (4CM6282), which should work properly. For now, I use the
following Xconfig (only relevant parts showed):

        Accel
        # Virtual       1280 1024
          ViewPort      0 0
          Modes         "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
          Option        "nomemaccess"

        Clocks "sc11412"
        #Clocks "icd2061a"

I'm not quite sure that the 'sc11412 clock' is correct, but it works
better than using the other one (icd2061a works only for 800x600).
When I enable the 'Virtual' keyword the cursor looks like a big square
displaying random garbage (which changes constantly). When I disable the
'nomemaccess' option, then the system freezes when I press a
mouse-button. It works for now, but fonts aren't displayed well and
sometimes colors aren't correct. Also the performance is pretty bad :(
This is what XF86_S3 says during startup...

I use the following mode-database...

# name         clock  horizontal timing    vertical timing    flags
ModeDB
 "640x480"     25     640  664  760  800   480  491  493  525

Recommended where?  Take it from me - the fewer people who have access
to root privs, the better.  I would go as far as to say that you should
NOT use a root account to do ANYTHING unless it is ABSOLUTELY essential
that it be done by the superuser.  If your users need high privs to do
system maintenance work, use su or sudo.

The bottom line is that UID means User Ident - meaning that it
identifies a user.  If you assign multiple interactive logins to a
single UID, then confusion will reign.

Cheers,
Rick.

Reply-To: magnus@cegt201.bradley.edu (Mohan Kokal)

A new release of the package has been uploaded on to :

ftp.procyon.com:/pub/linux/shadow/shadow-mk.tar.gz

This release has the source code for the login.secure program mentioned
by bjdouma@xs4all.nl  (Bauke Jan Douma) . The program is abosolutely harmless
and the earlier posts were just an over reaction. If you already have the
package installed from before today, then you do *not* have to get rid of
your /bin/login [which is login.secure] . /bin/login in the mk package
is a wrapper type of program that gets rid of the original /bin/login security
holes of -froot and -h.

Also in this package, the file perms have been fixed for the /bin/login and
/bin/_login files. If you have :

/bin/login as mode 4711 and
/bin/_login as mode 4755

then please change this to

/bin/login as mode 4511 and
/bin/_login as mode 4500

For those of you curious about the login.secure program, the original posting
with the source code is available on ftp.procyon.com in the directory
/pub/linux/shadow as login.secure.gz . As mentioned before, the source code is
also available in the latest release of shadow-mk.

: setup calls fdisk with the -l option to list partitions, it fails 'coz fdisk
: reports on needing to set heads/sect/cyls etc. I overcame this by hacking the script,


  Try running it (fdisk) interatively. I found thats the easiest way. By 
this I mean, if your using slackware or some such, log in as root - do 
your fdisk work - then run their setup or installer..

  I have a tmc-850 upgraded to a 950 by bios chip upgrade (to 8.2 i think)
  I do not however have a SCSI drive to use with it. It runs my cd rom 
fine under dos but not linux do to a parity design flaw in the drive oh 
well..   Anyways.. the card uses linuxes ST-01 (seagate) / FDM8xx drivers.

  The only time you should have to specify drive parameters is during 
install and maybe (I am not too sure) in your LILO scripts...

    I plan on installing Linux on my home system.  I have
the following hardware available:

        16 meg memory
        486/33
        5 meg C: partition (IDE)
        280 meg G: partition (SCSI)
        Adaptec 1542B SCSI card
        Mitsumi 2X cdrom

    Will I have any problems installing the Linux OS?
I have the 5 meg partition available as a DOS boot manager
partition under OS/2.  I don't want to repartition, so please
let me know if there is any way to have the loader on that
partition and the rest of the system on the G: drive.

    Any help is greatly appreciated.

Jake
