Do you actually have a tape device on your system? Or are you trying to 
(un)tar a disk file?

Just because the entry /dev/rmt0 exists, that doesn't mean that you actually 
have a real device behind it.

I had the SAME problem, it comes from
/usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi/buslogic.c

The translation mode is considered ENABLED by DEFAULT for >1Gb disks ?!!
If you are **NOT** using translation mode (a.k.a. DOS support for
>1Gb), that scews up the whole disk partition.

Solution:
Edit /usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi/buslogic.c, around line 960
inside function 'get_translation()' change
 return BIOS_TRANSLATION_BIG;
 with
 return BIOS_TRANSLATION_DEFAULT;

That will do.

Alright.  I have it TOO.  I am using 1.0.9 from Slackware.  Does 1.0.8 solve
the problem (or not have it, rather)?  To think one version before would save
me these headaches!

I also have another problem.  inetd on a machine that has drives nfs mounted
from it, inetd seems to spawn extra rpc.portmaps, one after another until the
original one is killed.  is this a related problem, or something else?

For some reason, after many people have read news, the in.nnrpd process (i
assumed spawed by inetd) hangs and eats up lots of CPU time.  I assume that it
is supposed to die when the connections close and not start again until
another connection is made to port 119.  However, I assume that it is not
dying correctly, and thus keeps looking for a connection thus eating up CPU
time.  Anyone else concur/disagree/shed light on situation?

Does this problem have anything to do with the other bizzarre problems people
are talking about in inetd in kernel versions > 1.0.8?

Thank you for your help.

That's a teensy tiny root partition.

My Linux box looks like this (minus my SCO Xenix partition, which
Linux apparently doesn't recognize, and that's just fine):

Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
/dev/hdb1             117992   85752    26341     77%   /
/dev/hdb3             280560  131331   135201     49%   /u
/dev/hda1              19444    5960    13484     31%   /dosc

di (not distributed with Linux) says this:

Mount             Kbytes     Used    Avail %used  Inodes    Used    Free %used
/                 117992    85752    26341  78%    29520    7545   21975  26%
/dosc              19444     5960    13484  31%        0       0       0   0%
/u                280560   131331   135201  52%    70280   15032   55248  21%

I put all the users on /u.

I wish my / partition were bigger, actually.  Yeah, I made it 115M,
but now I wish it were, say, 140M.  I have everything installed
except TeX and OO, plus a few things I found useful in the *nix
newsgroups.

Figure that whatever you install will be, say, 1.5M or 2M per disk you
install, if you're installing from disks.

Again, I think your choice of root partition size is by far too small.

My IP provider has both PPP and [C]SLIP access, and I too have 
configured both.  Configuration of PPP was equally easy when I put 
it in, after having previously set up CSLIP.

As for performance, I have measured data transfer rates and found that 
for me, PPP runs from 0 to 2 percent slower than CSLIP, depending on 
the type of data that is being transferred.  You have to get the 
asyncmap right with PPP to prevent a hit of up to 12.5 percent in 
transfer rate.

The differences in performance and configuration seem to be too small 
to really matter.  I suggest that other criteria are more important for 
choosing between the protocols.

My IP provider prefers PPP, since the diagnostics are better than for 
CSLIP (they are much better).  So I shall stick with PPP.  In your own 
circumstances this may not mattter as much.

i found my /bin directory as ?rwxx xxx  junk ...
I lost it on my drive partition hda1.
I have dos on hda4, and I am wondering how this appened.
Also, I can not format (in dos) sorry for that, but I am puzzled,
it does the format up to 100 % then give me a read error, and
abot,fail, retry.
Rawrite dows not work either, but I can make a boot floppy from
linux, or using norton disk doctor.
Can smoeone give me a hint why it would be my drive, if so,
why it does not format with dos format, or can not write with
rawrite, but works to make a boot disk from Linux.
Is it a virus, or hardware.
If it is a virus, is there some shareware on the net to help me detect it,
and cure.
thank you and sorry for the dos question, but I am at a dead end.
