Subject: how much disk space for X (windows)
Date: Tue, 20 Sep 1994 06:51:00 GMT

Hello,

Most of this is in the subject.
I use linux already (slackware 1.2.0, kernel 1.0.8) but without X
I don't have much diskspace so how much is needed to install X?

Related question, I recently started using a nfs mounted drive which
has space enough. Can I use this disk for X?
What directories are needed at booting and cannot be placed on the nfs
disk, and which one can be moved to the nfs disk to free up space on
my local disk?

Can anyone shed some light on this?

Thanks

Dolf Smits

This is probably a stupid question but can somebody help me out with this, ok,
I call my internet provider and start my SLIP/CSLIP connection as the root
user, the connection is established so I switch virtual consoles and log in
as jnykiel and start X Windows.

I decide to send somebody E-mail which I have no problems but what happens
when somebody sends me E-mail and I am offline (no SLIP/CSLIP connection),
where does this mail go, does the sender get a message that says I am un-
reachable or what, all I know is that I never get any mail, possibly know-
body loves me :( or I am doing something wrong.

Any help will be greatly appreciated,

Thanx...

Thanks Richard and those who answered via email. I got pcsndrv-0.7 at
sunsite.unc.edu /pub/Linux/kernel/patches/console, and it works fine
now. By the way, it mentions that it is also capable of playing music
through parallel ports and external speakers. Haven't got a chance to try
though.

Have a nice day.

Hi Jim,

    Karel Kubat did a great job in finding out how to build SAR (Search and
    rescue) disks. The information and the system he made available might just
    be the answer to your questions.

    The SAR-system is in any case available at ftp.icce.rug.nl, directory
    pub/unix. If you have a www-browser, you can get a lot of information
    about, e.g., the SAR system from our URL http://www.icce.rug.nl

    If you have any questions, please yell.

    Good Luck,

Crossposted-To: comp.mail.smail
Subject: Smail on Linux.  Was: Smail has intermittent fits
Date: 24 Sep 1994 15:12:16 GMT


        For all you Linux types: Smail is configured incorrectly in
slackware.  (Last I checked; I'm running Slackware 1.2 with my own
mods).
        First, and ABSOLUTELY critical: (if you skip the rest of this
post, at least read this!!) Put the line: 
-smtp_debug 
in your /usr/lib/smail/config file.  It turns off SMTP debugging,
which can give an unauthorized user access to run commands on your
machine (probably as user nobody, but remember that smail runs as
root.)

        Second: smail is set up to be called from inetd.  This is
startlingly inefficient.  Smail must reparse all of its configuration
files each time it is started up.  If you've looked at the config
files, you can imagine that this takes a while.  Furthermore, mail
that has been deffered or otherwise queued up won't be delivered by
this method.

        So, here's what you do.  Remove the call to smail from
/etc/inetd.conf.  In your /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2 file, add the following:

# Start the SMAIL SMTP server.
if [ -f /bin/smail ]
then
 echo -n " smail-SMTP"
 /bin/smail -bd 
 echo -n " smail-Queue"
 /bin/smail -q20m
fi

smail -bd starts a daemon that sits and waits for connections on the
SMTP port (25), and spawns off a child proccess every time new mail
arrives.  It only has to procceess its config files when it starts, so
it's startlingly more efficient.  Smail -q20m sets up a daemon that
proccesses the "input" queue every 20 minutes.  Mail that smail -bd
could not deliver immediately goes into this queue.  
        One of smail's only shortcomings is that it only has one
queue.  Mailers like MMDF and Zmailer use multiple queues so that if,
for example, AOL.com is down when a queue run is performed, Zmailer
doesn't have to proccess every message in the queue that's destined
for AOL.  It simply tries the first one and when that doesn't work it
skips the rest.  The "retries" files help out here, because it doesn't
try to connect for every message, but it still has to proccess the
entire queue.  Unfortunately, Zmailer doesn't work on Linux boxes yet,
and MMDF is a dinosaur that I didn't want to install for fear that it
might stomp on something.  Good design, though.)

        Third: If you're on the internet, go to the /usr/lib/smail/
directory and edit the "transports" file.  Uncomment the last four
lines in order to allow internet mail to be delivered using MX
records, not hostnames.  Here are the drivers I have in transports, in
order (I use procmail for local mail delivery, which is why the first
driver is bogus, and the second driver delivers to local users.)
bogus:  driver = appendfile,            # append message to a file
local:  driver = pipe,                  # append message to a file
pipe:   driver = pipe,                  # pipe message to another program
file:   driver = appendfile,
smtp:   driver = smtp,

Since I'm not on UUnet uux doesn't do me any good so I got rid of the
UUCP drivers.  Here's the full smtp driver, since that's going to be
the most important one:

smtp:   driver = smtp,
        -max_addrs,
        -from,
        -max_chars;
# For internet use: uncomment the below 4 lines
        use_bind,                       # resolve MX and multiple A records
        defnames,                       # use standard domain searching
        defer_no_connect,               # try again if the nameserver is down
        local_mx_okay,                  # pass on to next router if MX is us

It's these last four that make mail deliverable over the internet,
especially the use_bind tag.  Smail defaults to using gethostbyname,
which means that any mail for a machine with an MX record won't be
delivered.

Next, edit the "routers" file.  Once it is decided that mail is going
to go to a remote machine, this file is used to determine how to get
the message there.  Here are some of the key elements in this file:

match-inet-addrs:
        driver=gethostbyaddr,           # match user@[aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd]
        transport=smtp;                 # delivery is over smtp/tcp

forces:                                 # Just in case I need it
        driver = pathalias,             # router to search paths file

match_mx_hosts:                         # Match folks on the internet
        driver=bind,                    # Get info from nameserver
        transport=smtp;                 # use TCP/IP SMTP for delivery
        defnames,                       # use standard domain searching
        local_mx_okay,                  # if the MX points to this host, pass
                                        # it to the next router and see if
                                        # we serve it a different way
        defer_no_connect,               # try again if the nameserver is down
        gateways="brownvm.brown.edu:bitnet:+:uunet.uu.net:uucp"

{This is the REALLY important one.  The vast majority of your outgoing
mail will use this driver.  Notice that it uses bind instead of
gethostbyname.  VERY important for machines with MX records.  Also
notice the "gateways" line.  Mail to user@XXXXX.bitnet will be sent
through Brown's mainframe (substitute in a more local Bitnet gateway
in your own files, please) and mail to user@YYYY.uucp will go through
uunet.uu.net (again, you may want to substitute a more local UUCP
gateway).  Defer_no_connect is really important if you're using the
bind driver, because it allows the mailer to retry sending the mail if
the nameserver is down.}

match-inet-hosts:
        driver=gethostbyname,           # match hosts on network
        transport=smtp;                 # delivery is over smtp/tcp
        domain = students.brown.edu     # strip trailing domain before lookup

{Most of the time the match_mx_hosts will deliver the mail before this
driver is reached.}

{MAKE SURE THE REROUTE DRIVER IS COMMENTED OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!}

smart_host:
        driver=smarthost,               # special-case driver
        transport=smtp;                 # by default deliver over SMTP

{The smarthost is listed in the config file.}

        Lastly, the config file.  Here's a copy of mine, just to get
people started:

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#       smail configuration for NetSpace
# (see smail(5) man page for details and other options)
#
# Primary hostname
hostname=netspace.students.brown.edu

# Other hostnames that mail will be accepted for.  ALl of your machine's
# names should go in this list.  Note that there are no returns.
more_hostnames=netspace.cis.brown.edu:archive.phish.net:home.eos.brown.edu:ssc.org:netspace.stg.brown.edu:netspace.org

# Mail coming out of Netspace has this address on it.
visible_name=netspace.students.brown.edu

# How to get to the "smart" machine.  As if an IBM mainframe were "smart". :-)
smart_path=brownvm.brown.edu
smart_transport=smtp

# When mail is delivered to "postmaster", who does it go to?
postmaster=lee

# Needed for Listproc to work correctly, among other things.  Make sure there
# is a user "nobody" in /etc/passwd with a * in the passwd field:
# nobody:*:15:12:nobody:/home/nobody:/bin/logout
nobody=nobody

# If this many messages are being proccesed at once, queue them instead of
# attempting immediate delivery.
smtp_accept_queue=20

# Don't accept any more than this many SMTP connections at once.  Imagine the
# load of 60 smail proccesses on a Linux box... cripes!
smtp_accept_max=60

# Other schtuff
retry_file=retry
smail=/bin/smail
delivery_mode=foreground

# Turn of SMTP debugging.  CRITICAL!!!!!
-smtp_debug

# I don't want to see copies of every bounced message on my machine...
-error_copy_postmaster

# This is the line that comes up when someone makes an SMTP connection
smtp_banner="Welcome to NetSpace!  We're running Smail here."

# This is the same as the default.
received_field="Received: \
       ${if def:sender_host\
            {from $sender_host by $primary_name\
             ${if def:sender_proto: with $sender_proto}\
             \n\t(Smail$version #$compile_num) }\
        else{by $primary_name ${if def:sender_proto:with $sender_proto }\
              (Smail$version #$compile_num)\n\t}}\
        id $message_id; $spool_date"

#--------------------End of Config File---------------------------------

        On a final note: My linux box runs the Listproc mailing list
software, with over a dozen lists, 5 of which have over 250 users and
see more than 5 messages a day.  If you use listproc, append the flag
-m 250 after each list definition.  This tells Listproc that each
"system" SMTP connection, where the initial delivery of mail takes
place, delivers mail to up to 250 different people.  That means for a
list with 900 subscribers, only 4 smail proccesses are started.
Although these proccesses take considerably longer to run than a smail
proccess with only one message to deliver, they take far less time to
run than starting 900 seperate smail proccesses, and the load on the
machine is much less!  Also, make sure the server line in your
listproc config file tells it not to attempt delivery if the load is
over "1", unless you're only using your Linux box to deliver mail.  A
linux box at a load of 1 is slow enough already without Listproc
slowing things down more.

        All told, my machine proccesses about 5000 email messages a
day, sometimes more.  I have not had a message stay in the "input"
queue for more than two days in over a week, even though smail is
configured to retry delivery every 20 minutes for 5 days.  I haven't
had any messages at all in the "error" queue (mostly because of the
smart_host driver).  The load on my machine due to mail proccessing is
SMALL, because Listproc and smail are set up to handle it.

        I hope this post helps at least a few people out there!

Take care!

I suppose you have rewritten your hardware clock as well using
clock -w
after being logged on as superuser?
date just sets the system clock, which is maintained using the timer chips.

Basically, I didn't like the idea of a user file transfer aborted
in the middle because the time-for-call expired. This is why it works this way.
A UniBoard sysop here in Italy runs a BBS for profit over a `144' line
(I think it is 1-900 for you US people: a line which charges the user
some money per minute, and some of the $$$ go into the sysop's pockets).
He modified his zmodem to do exactly what Patrick suggested: the caller
is brute-force disconnected when the timer for the call expires. He did
this by forking a daemon from within zmodem (usual rz/sz by Omen Technology).
Reason? The telco wouldn't pay to the sysop anything for calls over 30'
in lenght :-)
