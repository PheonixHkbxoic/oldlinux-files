Subject: Linux-PC as ftp-server, a bad joke ???
Date: 13 Sep 1994 18:23:58 GMT

Hi All,

I've recently installed 'wu-ftpd 2.4(3)' on a 486/33 8MB
running linux-1.1.39.
I want to use this PC as a ftp-server and therefore the ftpd must
be able to manage more than one ftp-session at once :)
From another machine I opened 2 ftp-sessions simultanously and
did a 'mget *' (11MB) in both sessions. The first session did it fine,
but the second session stopped the transfer after a while with:

'421 Service not available, remote server has closed connection
 No control connection for command: no such file or directory '

Obviously, this is not the way a ftp-server should work :(

Any hints ?

thanx,
       alen

I have the same problem and tried to fix it because the "talk" I got didn"t
work. I got the sourcecode from talk and compiled it. It compiled exactly the
same program I had.

I added additional debugging code and found out that the following occures:
When I start talk with another machine (it's a SUN) there will be some
information exchanged. There is a special data-structure in talkd.h where
this header is defined. In talkd.h there is a loop that reads data coming
from the socket and it does this till thenumber of read bytes equals the size 
of the header. But the SUN I tried to talk allways sent 8 bytes too less. 
So my talk waited forever ..... and I allways saw the nice message 
"checking for invitation on callers machine" because talk didn't got enough
bytes ...

I stopped looking where the problem lies because it was too frustrating,
since I couldn't change the talk-deamon on the SUN.

Can anyone imagine where the problem is. I know my posting is a little bit
vague but I can look for the sourcecode I used if anyone wants to have a look
at this problem.

Well, if you are really into the doom, you can clone your startx (you aren't
using xdm, are you?) and modify it to startdoom, which calls xinit and starts
only one client (namely doom); pretty much like what you'd do to get exact
benchmark score for your Xserver.  BTW, rxvt is much smaller than xterm.
of course, the real solution is to get more memory; 24meg system really
rocks, but...

Subject: Routing A<-slip->B<-ether->C
Date: Wed, 14 Sep 1994 21:40:14 GMT

We have 3 linux computers here: A & B are connected via SLIP, B & C are
connected via ethernet. Ping, telnet, etc work fine between A & B, and
between B & C, but not even ping works between A & C. I presume this is
because the routing is setup wrong. I have made an effort to read about
the subject, and to do some trial and error fooling around, but have had
no success. Now's the time to ask all you folks for help! First, a few
questions:

1) I've assigned 2 IP numbers to B - one for SLIP and one for the
   ethercard. Is this the correct thing to do?
2) Are the two halves - SLIP & ethernet - considered to be two separate
   networks, subnets of one network, or one network? In other words,
   do I need a subnetting setup?
3) Do all 3 machines need a different routing table (not counting the
   different IP numbers, of course)? Or would A's and C's be more or less
   identical?
3) I'm running 1.1.50, and do NOT have 'IP forwarding/gatewaying' enabled.
   Is this required in my case? If yes, does only B need it?
4) Is B considered to be a 'gateway' to C from A (& vice versa), or is
   A through B to C considered to be a 'direct' route?

Even with answers to the above, I'm not confident I could get things going
on my own. I would be very grateful if someone posted an example routing
configuration that would hook up all 3 computers...

   Thanks very much.

Hi,

YES ! Just do liloconfig, and start with a new header, set up Linux
as the 1st OS to boot into, and choose the delay presented to you.

Subject: X Support for JAX8236(Trident 9200CXr)?
Date: Wed, 14 Sep 1994 20:46:09 -0400

I'm very pleased with my local-bus video card while working under DOS/Windows. 
However, I cannot get X-windows to work with it.  ConfigXF86 suggests using 
the Trident 8900 support, but that doesn't work either.  The screen clears, 
shows the normal X screen, clears blue for fvwm, and I get a cursor.  There 
are random sprinkled dots around it, which are left behind while moving the 
mouse.  If I move it to the top of the screen or start an application and 
place the window, the system will lock solid.  If I do nothing, it will lock 
up after a couple of minutes.

My older Trident 8900CL card works just fine, but is unbearably slow in DOS.
Is there an updated driver for my particular type of card?  Is it a problem 
related to my Xconfig instead?  Pointers and suggestions welcomed..

Particulars:
486DX2/66
8 meg mem/8 meg swap
Slackware 2.0
Kernel 1.42
Video card is labeled JAX8236, with the Trident 9200CXr chipset and 1 meg 
   memory.  It is a VLB card.

I can't turn off the local bus, my hard drive controller is also using it.

After I installed the mid-July version of Slackware, I noticed a very
similar problem. I was able to correct it by grabbing the source code
and recompiling. I am using the 1.1.45 kernel, and it works just fine.
I grabbed the source for xfig 2.1 patchlevel 8 (protocol 2.1).

I guess what I am saying is that you should try upgrading to 1.1.45
and then recompile the 2.1.8 source.

If that doesn't work, I am stumped, but then again, I am easy to
stump.

I just installed the Fall 94 release using a PAS16 and a 3xi.  I had lockup 
problems and had to physically turn off the machine (cycle the power to the 
PAS card I guess) because the card was not recognized under DOS if I did 
a hardware reset.  What it *seems* is happening is that the autoprobe is 
guessing at the interupt for the scsi portion of the card and getting it 
wrong.  I overcame this by issuing the boot image:

        linux pas16=0x388,12
        this includes the base address and irq
                    
It was much happier with this interupt and is working great now.  Check
the PAS16 HOWTO for more info.  Thats where I came up with this. BTW, you
may have to experiment with IRQ.  I verified the base address by watching
verbose output of the Trantor startup but it does not list the interupt.
