Any hint would be good.

Hip! I have exactly same problmes 1 and 2 without slip !!!!!!! Not the

I have a 66MHz 486 + 32MB RAM + 2GB disk + 2000 (!) user accounts in my

Usually it works nice, but sometimes the whole net software seems to
do nothing with the new connections.  Login opens the window and
connects, but no "login:" prompt.  Same problems with smtp
connections, they jammmm similar way.  I think all telnet connections
hang somehow or are extremely slow.

In the begining I got "no more sockets" to the /usr/adm/messages.  I
doubled the socket tables in kernel.  It did actually not help,
expect I am not getting "no more sockets" into the /usr/adm/messages.

My laste experiment: I did delete smtp from inetd.conf and started to
run sendmail directly "standalone". I do not know if it helps. I have
not had problems after that, but the week is in the begining. :-(

This is interesting. I have not noticed that.  Must check it next time

Never had a problem like this before, but it sounds like your tcl/tk isn't
installed right. tclIndex says the following:

set auto_index(tk_bindForTraversal) "source $dir/menu.tcl"

and tk.tcl says:

tk_bindForTraversal Entry
tk_bindForTraversal Text

So evidently you should have this file "$dir/menu.tcl" in the proper
directory.
Hope it helps.

Thank you all for your replies! I'm currently running 1.1.51, and have 
successfully mounted my home drive across to the Sun, a HP-9000/G50, and 
a RS-6000.

The only problem that we encounter now is the fact that WordPerfect on the
RS-6000 locks up tight as a drum when trying to load a file on the 
Linux NFS-mounted directory. Read-only works file. This to me is not 
that big of a deal, since I rarely need xwp. I can copy my file to /tmp 
if I really need it.

In case this fellow still hasn't installed.. I used umsdos for a bit before

I wouldn't plan on using it if you intend to install X also.

Best thing to do.. BACKUP, then repartition with fdisk.

        What if I am using NIS?
        We tried /bin/hostname nmda.neurology.wisc.edu, then
        /bin/domainname neuron.wisc.edu (NIS domain name), and ypwhich
        couldn't find the NIS server. We also tried /bin/hostname nmda
        and /bin/domainname neuron.wisc.edu and it didn't work either.

        We have installed net-tools-1.1.46.tar.gz and we found out 
        that hostname is the same program as domainname. How can we
        get NIS running with the new hostname program? And how can we
        set the NIS domainname?

then extra hassles to get X up.

I finally have a stable, working, X environment based on Xfree 2.11, and
I fear wrecking it just to keep up with the Joneses. :)

Will fvwm and its modules work in Xfree3.11?

It looks like somebody forgot to recompile their code with ncurses 1.8.5.
The terminfo database format changed (to match that in SVR4) in 1.8.3.
I guess slackware is still using the old one.

Compile all the programs concerned with ncurses 1.8.5.

  After I posted the article about the Cisco-linux-probelm, I met
Alan on IRC. We worked on the problem for several hours, and came
to the following conclusion: Cisco tcp behaviour is strange but legal.

For the techies: linux request a bigger framesize and Cisco doesn't
respond, so the connection hangs.

Alan told me a workaround: compile the kernel with PC/TCP compatibility.

It works perfect for me. No problems since the recompile.
Alan hopes to include a permanent fix with the next patches.

No, Slackware is using 1.8.5 with the new terminfo database, and has been

Heya Olav,

Another case of it!  I have been waiting for several weeks now for an
answer on this one, but nobody has come up with anything.  At first
I thought it was something I did wrong, but it does seem to be a
problem with the code.  Where exactly, other than with inetd, I do not know.  

I just put one of my boxes to 1.0.8 to clear this up, and the
Pentium EISA/PCI with 2 Gig SCSI box is sitting in a corner waiting
for this fix.  I have seen this bug as far back as 1.1.48, but I 
cannot determine how far back it goes ... would try to find out if 
a developer asked.

Others have emailed me about it too, no solutions ... be sure 
to post if you find one!

Good Luck,

Steve...
