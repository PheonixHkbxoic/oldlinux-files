I use slackware 2.0. This includes xfree86 V2.1.1. Which includes
xview 3.2. I too use openwindows. I have worked on a SUN for a
number you years & grew to like it. So, when I installed linux 
on my PC at home, I used openwin. IMHO, the problems you complain
about are non-problems. The typewriter complaints only show up on 
my login console (which I never see anyway) These complaints have
not caused any crashes or other negatives, in my use of openwin.
THe LD_LIBRARY_PATH thing? So what? Just set the variable & move on...
I have to do it on my SUN, it is the same for linux. I never saw this
as a problem. The cmdtool complaint is very valid. In fact I hate 
using xterms & always use cmdtool's on my SUN (unless I cannot :-)
I have switched to using an xterm on my linux machine. I feel it
is a small sacrafice for a GOOD xwindow system. Besides Xfree 3.+ 
may well fix the cmdtool problem...

Yuck! :-) I hope you have been somewhat pursuaded to give openwin
another chance. It really is very good. I cannot think of a single
linux problem I've had that was openwin related...

Hi folks,

I've had a problem with setting the hostname on my system since
I upgraded to 1.1.45. I went to 1.1.50 yesterday, hoping for a
fix, to no avail.

I've followed the advice from a couple of postings on c.o.l.help 
over the last month, but it hasn't worked so far.

The problem:

Whenever I set my /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 to:

     /sbin/hostname        reston
     /sbin/domainname      cber.nih.gov

My system greets logins as:

   cber.nih.gov (none)

and a plain:

    /sbin/hostname

actually shows:

    cber.nih.gov

This has me puzzled. Reading the FAQ's, HOW-TO-net and NET-3 docs
hasn't helped me at all.

Thanks a lot!

I know the maximum filesystem size for minix is roughly 64meg due to its
use of 16 bit fragment pointers and 1k fragments.

What limitations exist for the other hard drive filesystems, particularly
extended-2 and xia?

The rlogin program needs to be setuid root:

-r-sr-xr-x   1 root     bin        13060 Sep 18 1993  rlogin

As root, issue the following command:  chmod 4555 rlogin

Make sure the rlogin command is owned by root: chown root login
That should fix your problem.

This is true, but you could look into running AMD on your Sun stations as
well. We are running AMD on Sun stations running everything from SunOS 4.1.1
to SunOS 5.2 and some HP-UX 8.0, and HP-UX 9.0 too. I think it's even 
running over on some AIX 3.1.2 machines too. And of course, it's running
on my Linux box as well with no trouble what so ever. And, AMD does do YP
easily.

You didn't ask a question, but I assume you want to figure out
how to boot Linux again?  ftp to sunsite (or one of the mirrors -
my favorite is mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu), go to /pub/linux/distributions/
slackware/bootdsks.144 and get one of the files in the directory
(bare.gz will get you going).  Get a copy of gzip.exe for DOS
(one directory back, cd ..) and a copy of rawrite.exe (same).

Now in DOS, do gzip -d bare.gz.  Then do rawrite (I forget if it
needs any command line options, maybe rawrite a: bare?) to place
the file 'bare' onto a floppy (floppy may need to be formatted first -
can't remember).  Ta-da, you now have a boot disk!

Maybe you should add a linux partition to lilo.conf, in case you
trash bootdisk again.

Also, there's no point in even installing LILO if you only ever 
boot DOS anyhow.  Set it up to boot DOS by default, and Linux
by selection.  To do this, make sure the DOS partition is listed
before the linux partition in lilo.conf.  You need to run /sbin/lilo
after editing lilo.conf to make the changes take effect.

You probably need to recompile your kernel to include this CD support.
Read the Linux Installation HOWTO for the procedure.  It's not that
hard.  I did it for the first time last weekend.  In case I am wrong,
read the CDROM-HOWTO.  Should be in YOUR /usr/docs/faq, or whatever.
If you can't find it, get it via ftp.

Not quite.  patch produces its output on stderr, so you need something
like:

    patch -p0 <patch47 >patch47.logfile 2>&1

...in order to catch both stdout and stderr to the logfile.

In practice, I do:

    zcat patch47.gz | patch -p0 >patch47.logfile 2>&1

...since the patches are distributed as .gz files, and I can't be

Okay, Okay I should have crossposted it in the first place.
I posted an article under the subject : "Does nobody here know about
Linux ? " in biz.sco.general few hours ago and already have a good
response. This is an honest attempt to convert SCO users to Linux.
Hopefully we'll get attention of some developers and they might think
about porting their popular application to Linux.

If you have been enjoying Linux without paying for it then now is a
good time to pay back to Linux community. Your job is to get more
and more people to start using Linux instead of any other OS. The
more people use Linux, more applications, faster development etc.
etc. Its a good thing you see. Jump to biz.sco.general now and 
participate in that discussion.

It seems that you have to insert the line

just before "cat". I read it in the

        Do you get this message when you try to start X? You will if 
Selection is running. Selection makes the mouse work in Linux, but you 
have to kill it to run X. 
        If you get this error while trying to get the mouse to work in 
*Linux*, check to see if /dev/mouse is pointing at /dev/cuaN, N being the 
port number that your mouse is connected to. (rem: cua0=ser.port1, 
cua1=ser.port2, etc.) Also make sure that you are specifying the correct 
mouse protocol with Selection (try 'em all 'till it works). Still doesn't 
work? Make sure the port's not sharing an interupt with something else. 
Is it something other than an MS serial mouse? If so, did you compile 
support for it in the kernel? That's about all I can think of at this
