Yes. Your service provider needs to configure the Netblazer with the
IP addresses. Tell them to use the "pool" command.

However, many providers don't do this. The solution is simple. You
were told (given a piece of paper, by email, by telephone, by personal
contact, etc.) the IP addresses for you and the "peer"/"gateway"/
"remote", etc.

Use the parameter:

<your_ip_addr>:<peer_ip_addr>

That is, your IP address, a colon, and the remote IP address.

>On another note, are the any known problems with 1.1.18 and PPP 2.1.2a ?

When 1.1.18 was the current 1.1 series kernel, we ran it with 1.1.18.

SLS? Oh, that may explain what everyone's love affair is with 1.1.18! :)

There have been other 'undocumented features' which have been:

1. locate erronoues feature.
2. place firmly on smooth surface of rock.
3. Pick up second rock.
4. Place over first one.
5. Press firmly.

This process has been repeated many times since 1.1.18 related to
network errors. The PPP code has not changed since then, aside from an
update which I just put on sunsite.unc.edu.

However, PPP does work well with 1.1.18.

There is a serious problem with the TCP in the new kernels. I (and many 
others) have been posting about it for months, but sofar I have never seen any 
reply from a Kernel developer. Have a look at all postings about Telnet, Ftp 
delays/hangups etc.
Please, is there any developer who can look into this TCP problem?

Good news: Linux *has* SVR4-style shared libraries. If you want you
can use ELF object code format with the latest kernels and you can
build ELF binaries and also shared libraries thanks to the excellent
work of some people (H.J. Lu works on gcc, gas and binutils to do
this). In fact, yesterday I built an ELF version of XFree 3.1 with
shared libraries (some other kind person posted a very small patch to
the XFree 3.1 source tree to make this a piece of cake).

To Adam Richter: nothing stops you to recompile XFree 3.1 yourself and
try to keep the version number of the shared libraries the same as the
old ones and then see what happens. But the current shared libraries
are difficult wrt to this, since all tables and global data must still
fit in the same amount of memory. Otherwise your code may be
compatible, but the shared library not because of changed
addresses. When ELF will become the standard object code format, in a
few months maybe, such problems will be of the past.

Then there are IDE controllers with '286's that have a separate cable
for each IDE drive.  They can be accessed simlutaneously like SCSI and
there is space for cache RAM and more drives.  The controller at a show
this afternoon was $120.  That's a lot cheaper than upgrading to SCSI
for people that already have IDE and it's pretty snappy from what I saw.

Then either stop the routing daemon entirely, or mark the network routes
as passive to tell the routing daemon that it shouldn't expect updates.

What! You don't like them! You certainly want a bland system! :)

Solution:

Remove the following line from the file /etc/csh.login

echo "";fortune;echo ""

And then remove the lines from the file /etc/profile

echo
fortune
echo

Yes, but let's explain just a little bit. That works because reboot's
login shell in the example is a shell. If you make the login shell be
/sbin/reboot itself, that is what gets executed when you do the 'su',
with arguments "-c 'vi /etc/passwd'".

Hi!

It took me some hours to download XFree86-3.1 from ftp.gwdg.de, but it was
worth the long time!

It took me not 1 hour to get XFree86-3.1 installed. I've just done a "mkdev
/usr/X11R6", changed to the new directory and installed the *.tar.gz Files.
Than be sure that /usr/X11R6/bin is _BEFORE_ /usr/bin/X11 oder whatever in
your $PATH. 

There is a Programm called xf86config - it's perfect! It installed
everything for me (I've a Hercules Dynamite PRO, based on the ET4000/W32i).
The new W32-Server runs PERFECT for me! It's  GREAT!

And fvwm? NO PROBLEM! Use your _OLD_ Libs from X11R5 and it will run. I saw
a new Release of libXpm specially for X11R6 - but I've not tried this.


For me it was the best decision installing XFree86-3.1... For me it works so
great! And I've not noticed any problems with _ANY_ programm for X11R6.

Bye
  Michael (AND A BIG  THAAAANK YOU  to the XFree86-Team!)

        That is no excuse cause Motif or other applications to be
unable to work *at all* with R6 shared libaries.  When Linux becomes
the most widely used unix variant, do you think it will be acceptable
for all binaries to *unnecessarily* break when a new version of a

        Could the author of the above statement please explain what
interface in R6 *breaks* Motif 1.2.4?  I would sincerely like to know.
We are not talking about using new R6 features, just continuing to run
existing applications.

        Then these people should state some good technical reasons for
their decision!

        Remember, we had an X11R6 distribution in
ftp.yggdrasil.com:pub/software_dist that ran binaries of R5 programs
that can successfully relink against R6 (we even adjusted the jump
tables to reflect procedures that had simply been renamed in R6).

        If XFree86 made their beta releases free and accessible to the
world (like new Linux kernels), the shared library problem would have
been detected and fixed long ago.  I also think that it would result
in more contribution and faster bug detection and bug fixing.
