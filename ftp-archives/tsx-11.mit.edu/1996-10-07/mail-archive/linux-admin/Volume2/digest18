Hi 

I am able to get pppd up. It works fine but when I ifconfig, the 
following appear: 

ppp0      Link encap UNSPEC  HWaddr 
00-00-00-00-00-00-00-F8-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00
          inet addr 192.91.254.205  P-t-P 192.91.254.5  Mask 255.255.255.0
          UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING  MTU 296  Metric 1
          RX packets 1003 errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0
          TX packets 1288 errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0
 
I think what comes up with ifconfig should be :

ppp0      Link encap Serial Line IP
          inet addr 192.91.254.205  P-t-P 192.91.254.5  Mask 255.255.255.0
          ........

Anyone knows whats wrong with the above ?  I am using 1.1.49 kernel, 
slackware 2.0 and ppp-2.1.2a

Thanks

_setutent is an "inline" function which is defined in one of the system
header (.h) files, although I can't recall which one (I'm on a Sun
system at the moment).  Generally, it is used to manipulate the utmp
file, and it sounds to me as if utmp is simply missing.  In most
installations, utmp is fount in /etc;  once in a great while, it is
found in /var/adm.  If you DO have a utmp file, try creating a symbolic
link to it from the "other" directory.  Otherwise, create one with the
touch command.

Good luck. -- Rick

The Intel EtherExpress driver is part of the standard kernel source tree,
but it is usually not integrated in the standard pre-compiled kernels of
the ditributions.

There is no need to use another machine for this :-) Just recompile a
kernel on your machine (run "make config", then select "ALPHA net drivers",
"Other ISA adapters", "Intel EtherExpress", then build your kernel as
usual)

> and if so, how do I put it on

If your bootdisk has LILO on it : mount it, copy the new kernel on the 
disk and re-run LILO (be sure to have the right config file, and check
that your disk is mounted at the same point as the place your config file
expects to find the kernel). 

If you don't use LILO, configure your kernel w/ rdev ("man rdev" for more
enlightments on how to do it), then copy it to an unmounted, formatted, blank
floppy using "dd if=<your-kernel-image> of=/dev/fd0 bs=32768" (assuming the
disk is in /dev/fd0).

Subject: Curses problems with kterm
Date: 2 Sep 1994 17:39:27 -0400

I have a curses based application that I am trying to use
with kterm. It seems to get confused about the cursor position
and what to display when working with JIS Japanese data.
Straight display works fine, but when you move the cursor
and update the screen, the display is wrong and it does not
have the expected position on the screen. Everything works
fine on English-only texts.

The version that I am running of kterm is version 5.1.1  .
I run this under linux and also on Sun workstations.
<CTL>-<Mouse middle> gives a menu that allows you to
control whether you are using JIS, ShiftJIS or EUC.
I tried all settings to no avail.

The man page says that kterm will work with the xterm
termcap settings. That is what I am using. Is there some
termcap entry more specific to kterm that will help?
If so, how can I get it?

There is a library called pcurses in the linux JE
package. pcurses seems to be for EUC encoding only.
My application is not 8-bit clean, so I want to use
JIS. Also, I have not seen pcurses for the Sun. Can
I use pcurses or some other library with JIS on both
linux and Suns?

I have seen the JE-HOWTO. Are there other FAQs that
would help me? What resources should I be using?

I would be happy to hear any recommendations for
solving my problem.

TIA,
George Wilson

Date: Sat, 3 Sep 1994 13:01:27 GMT

Due to many questions for the new Term-HOWTO, I have just send the latest
 version of it to Mat Welsh. It will be available in all known places soon.

It now covers term versions upto 2.0.4, ALTHOUGH a major gap at this moment
 will be libtermnet.a. This is major stuff for the next version. Furthermore,
 results of the Term poll held by Bill McCarthy are appended as is a lot of
 other small stuff.


Most up to date version will still be available on

http://zeus.cs.kun.nl:4080/term-howto/Term-HOWTO.html 

However, as my linux box is connected to the internet via a special modem of 
a experimental modem connection, it will be possible that this URL is not
 available due to problems. In that case, please try it another time.

Suggestions, additions, error corrections etc. are welcome. I am not stating all the information is complete or correct (although I really hope that it is correct).

Ok, I will now follow up on my earlier post about the shadow-mk
package.

I would advice anyone that has installed this package to remove it.

I have received an email from someone who also noticed the
installation of the login.secure binary, for which no source is
provided.
In his correspondence with the author of this package, that author,
in his helpfulness, asked for a temporary account on his machine, and
having been denied that, asked for the password file. The emailer
also told me he has observed the author of this package to be
bragging about violating computer security.

Help! I am new to Linux, have a 90MHz Pentium w/16Meg ...
after running a couple of apps that use ~10Meg (these have

emacs)...what to do? 

Can I tune som paramters in the kernel?

Will another 16Meg make life good again?

Will the memory management get better in later versions?

Will Linux work if I load 128Meg (or would that be a waste)?

Thanks.

Hello,


I'm trying to get ftape to go and have run into a snag. I have kernel 1.0.0, 
ftape -1.13.b and modutils 0.99.15.pl1. I have succesfully complied the 
modules and went throught the drv. hello world test without any problems.
I'm pretty sure that make made it to the end of the compile as ftape.o does
exist. The problem is when I do 'insmod ftape.o'. I get:

darkstar:/usr/src/ftape-1.13b# insmod ftape.o
_enable_irq undefined
_disable_irq undefined
_free_dma undefined
_free_irq undefined

Whats up??

link unless you add 'link-absolute' I beleive,  you have to mount the
actual directory

I had the slakware dir on /home/user1/slakware.  I also 
ln -s /home/user1/slakware /slakware

I added to my /etc/exports
/slakware         falcon(ro)lego(ro)

mount rmc1:/slakware /mnt would fail with perm. denied message.

I had to change /etc/exports to:

/home/user1/slakware  falcon(ro) lego(ro)

and  mount rmc1:/home/user1/slakware /mnt

hope this helps...

I don't think EET (Eastern European Time) is right for italy.
Shouldn't it be WET DST ? Anyway, this is irrelevant to the point of
this discussion - I'm using EET (+ DST now) here in Finland with
similar results.

Are you sure it was not just the 5 days? That's what I seem to be getting.

Yep. And as it happens, I managed to clobber the /usr/lib/zoneinfo/EET
some time ago. The one I'm using now is from an Alpha, but I still get the
5 day offset in Dos dates. So, I think the problem is elsewhere.
Tried the following snippet:
..
  gettimeofday(&tv,&tz);
  printf("Timezone: minuteswest %d, DST %u\n",tz.tz_minuteswest,tz.tz_dsttime);
..
Result:
  Timezone: minuteswest -7200, DST 1

I know EET is two hours east of GMT, but two hours is 7200 seconds, not
minutes. 7200 min is 120 hours is 5 days... Apparently somehow, somewhere
the true offset gets multiplied with 60.  Hasn't really shown up elsewhere,
as I've told Linux to regard the CMOS clock  as localtime. Doesn't the
minuteswest-value come from the sys_tz struct in kernel/init.c? If so,
does this mean that whatever program passed the timezone to the kernel
function sys_settimeofday() gave the wrong value?

Quite annoying, actually. As long as this problem persists, I'll
have to remember to keep my fingers off anything that might be time 
stamp dependant on the DOS filesystems.

Well, actually, there are others, but.....  :-)

Actually, both of these so-called theoretical maximum compression ratios
are nothing but simple numbers the marketing types can remember.  Both
MNP5 and V.42bis (which, btw, really is normally the better of the two)
are capable of *MUCH* higher than 2:1 or even 4:1.

I have some detailed specs somewhere, but of course, they're not in the
directory they should be in (and my copy of Recommendation V.42bis is at
work).  Of course, the numbers don't really mean much unless the data is
basically designed to be highly compressible, but....  :-)

Hello all.

I compiled ftape-1.13b in Linux 1.1.49  and I had the follow errors in
compilation: 


fdc-io.c: In function `fdc_grab_irq_and_dma':
fdc-io.c:949: warning: implicit declaration of function `irqaction'
fdc-io.c:954: too few arguments to function `request_dma'

request_dam function changed your syntax.

Could someone tell me if some hacker solved it, please?

thank in advance

I sorry, but my english is not good :-)

Linux 1.1.44 broke the pci BIOS code, either upgrade or use 1.1.39.

I scraped together a 386sx out of old parts and I am running linux
Now I find I have 8 1meg sims and 4 slots. I also have
an ems/extended memory board. 

Can linux use ems/extended memory?
How?

Do I have any other choice.
It is also possible that I will be commin into more 1 meg sims
(as I upgrade my sun's memory) 

Is there any solution as how to use it?
