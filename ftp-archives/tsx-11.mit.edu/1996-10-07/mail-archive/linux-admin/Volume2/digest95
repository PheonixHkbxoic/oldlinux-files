You should be able to find a DAT or an 8mm drive used in that price range
if you shop around.

I was refered to some surplus type reseller in CA.( I Forget exactly who
it was but they are long gone)
I was looking for a 1/4" cartridge drive.
He said they were sold out, So I asked him what else they had in the 
150-500 Meg range, he said "nothing in that range", so I asked
"WHAT DO YOU HAVE", "oh we got some 1.3 or 2.6 Gig or something but that is
probably too big"
It was like pulling teeth to get anything out of this guy, I finally found
out he had 8 1.3 Gig wangdat drives and 2 drives with hardware compression
that were listed as 2.6 Gig, they were $399 & $499.
This sounded too good to be true so I told him I would call him back.
I called the BBB and some other company regulation agency in CA, they had
been in business 5-6 yrs and had no problems so I figured what the hell
I'll pay with a credit card.
I called him back about 1Hr later to order, he said the 2.6 Gig drives were
gone. I said I kinda wanted the extra space so he offered to sell me 2 of
the 1.3 Gig drives for the price of one 2.6. I turned him down and just 
got the one for $399.
He also found one of 250 Meg Tandberg drive they were selling for $129.00
(This is the same drive one guy is selling on the net as a 525 Meg drive)
This was a little over 2Yrs ago and both have worked perfectly since.
As far as I could tell the DAT drive had never even been used and still
smelled new, the Tandberg was used.

There have been quite a few postings of DAT and 8mm drives in the forsale
groups in the last few months you may want to look there if you feel lucky.

You should be able to get the tandberg 3660's for about $150. you could get
2 and use some backup software that will handle compression and switch
devices when full on it's own.
Then you could load 2 tapes and walk away.
The only problem would be the cost of the tapes, about $30.00 for the 250
Meg tapes.

keep in mind, The little tape drives like the Colorado Jumbo 250 are listed
as compressed capacity, assumed to be 2:1.
In other words this drive is really about 125 Meg.
The Tandbergs are really 250 with the right tapes or 150 with the standard
6150 cartridges.

The cost of the tapes can be an issue if you intend to archive a lot of info
The 250 Meg 6250 Tapes are about $25-30.00
The 1.3-4.5 Gig DAT tapes and the 4-8 Gig 8mm tapes are $7-10.00

I have 45 DAT tapes in my drive this is almost 60 Gig with my drive
they cost me about $400
To buy that much capacity in the 6250's would cost about $6,000.00
With the newer drives that fit more data on the same tapes the 
spread would be a lot higher than that.
I have seen ads for tape drives that use $2.50 T-120 Video tapes and fit
25 Gig on them.

If you are only going to have a few backups it is not an issue.

I finally got ftape to work with my Colorado Jumbo
by upgrading to Linux 1.1.50,
and installing ftape-1.13b, from sunsite.unc.edu in pub/Linux/kernel/tapes
after applying the patch ftape-irq-dma.patch from the same directory.

I'm posting as well as mailing, because others may have this problem

pinging the feed host by both IP and name. Use ping or nslookup to see

And in practice, people who route the loopback _host_, and people who
route the loopback _network_ seem evenly split.  Perversely, Mmy machine
_says_ it's routing the host, but any host on that net is loopback.  Go
figure...

This depends, as you say, on whether the IP kernel code can make it's
routing decisions based on interface name, rather than interface address.
I gather some can, and I gather it's a new thing.  Older (primarily
4.2/3BSD) code apparently couldn't.  I'm in the middle of rereading
Leffler & McKusick, I should have a better answer than that shortly.

  Has anyone gotten the GNU fingerd to work? I'd thought of using it
to replace the one from slackware that isn't NIS aware (and therefore
does confusing things), but can't seem to get it even close to
compiling. 

  Failing the GNU daemon, is there a linux usable NIS aware fingerd?
I've looked around a lot, but it's been a few weeks.

You have to use DOS to initialize the card. So boot DOS (with SSINIT.EXE),
hit ctrl-alt-del and boot Linux.

Cards based on the SoundScape architecture are not compatible with SB16 or PAS16
but with SB (or SB Pro?), MPU401 and Windows Sound System. It's quite easy
to configure Linux to use the card as a SB and MPU401. Just use the
same I/O base, IRQ and DMA settings than with DOS. The Windows
Sound System compatibility seems to be little bit difficult to get work.

There will be a native SoundScape support in Linux as soon as I get a
SoundScape card.

We use the ICSI version of GNU finger. It's basically GNU finger without

When benchmarked with FlagShip, CPU operations that are small enough to work
in the cache are faster on the DX2/66, but many operations are actually faster
on the DX/50.... especially when set up with a caching disk controller.

Another possibility, if your provider is willing, is to MX your
machine to the provider's mailhub. When your connection is up, mail
goes right through. When you're down, mail gets queued until you come
up, then the next queue run will deliver the mail. It's doable, but
requires a provider with some Sendmail expertise.
