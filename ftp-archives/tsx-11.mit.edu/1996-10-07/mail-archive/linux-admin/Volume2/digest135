Not exactly true.  For components using technology that we don't

The QVision controller is a good example.  Technical reference guides

The microcode that the driver must download to the board is licensed

microcode, but I don't think that you'll want to pay their price.  None
of the existing drivers will work with this board.

Which one?  The NEC C710, C94 or the AMD?

I've posted the solution to this before.  Since we don't officially 
support Linux, you probably aren't going to find anyone on the support
lines who can help with this.  There are several of us who happen to use 
Linux and we're happy to share what we know about Linux and Compaq 
hardware.  Please keep in mind, though, that Compaq does not test
or support Linux.

: So I run an Adaptec 2740, SMC Ultra-16 ethernet, and 16MB RAM on my

Until the C710 support is working (see the kernel source), and since
you probably don't have a license for the TI microcode, the only thing
I can help you with is the memory problem.  

First, using your EISA configuration diskettes, make sure that your
RAM is in linear mode vs. "Compaq Compatible" mode.  Then edit
/usr/src/linux/init/main.c and hardwire the memory_end variable
to the amount of your RAM.  For example, if you have 32MB, then
make this change:

was:  memory_end = (1<<20) + (EXT_MEM_K<<10);
now:  memory_end = 32*1024*1024;

Finally, compile a new kernel and reboot.

The lack of a MAC address shouldn't stop it working assuming that the
bootp server "knows" who you are by some other means (e.g. it knows
what physical port you are on or who you logged in as.)

However in all versions of bootpc I've released so far it didn't work,
'cos I always put the ARPHRD_ETHER type in the htype bootp field.

On NET3 (1.1.14+ I think) based kernels you can extract the correct
hardware type from any interface using SIOCGIFHWADDR so it should just
work correctly with that fix to the bootpc code.

However I've not got a SLIP (or PPP etc) line to test this on so I'm
on rather shakey ground where this is concerned.

Could someone with a SLIP line and a new(ish) kernel run the bootpc
(0.31) code thus:

  bootpc --dev sl0 --verbose --debug

andmail me all the output?

This is some (hopefully correct) info on SLIP and PPP from a technical
point of view.  I don't know which is better in terms of Linux implementation,
or if there is any difference.

TCP: Most of the traffic you'll be copying with is TCP frames.  These are
     20 bytes of header, optional options (grin) and the data.

IP: Your basic IP frame is 20 bytes of header, some (usually 0) bytes of
    IP options, and some bytes of data.

SLIP: The SLIP encapsulation adds an extra 2 bytes per frame, as well as
      escaping and 0xC0 and 0xDB characters in the frame.  Hopefully these
      are fairly rare.  It has a simple encapsulation protocol, and nothing
      else.  Things to note here are:
        - there is no negotiation of options between ends, no possibility of
          exchanging IP addresses for dynamic lines, and no SLIP checksum
          on the frame (not a big problem with error correcting modems).

CSLIP: Adds compression to the TCP and IP headers, reducing the (transmitted)
       header size from 40 bytes to 4 or 5 bytes.  This is a big win for
       interactive traffic, where if you push a key you get 1 byte of data
       sent with 40 bytes of header[1].

PPP: As well as simply providing an encapsulation method for IP frames, PPP
     also provides parameter negotiation between the two ends.  PPP 
     nominally adds 7 bytes of overhead for each frame, but the two ends can
     (and usually do) negotiate this down to 5 bytes.  PPP contains a CRC
     for each frame, and can do header compression just like CSLIP (this is
     another negotiable option).  PPP can also operate with protocols other
     than IP, though most (all?) people won't use it for such.  One thing
     to note is that by default PPP will escape all characters less than
     0x20.  This is a major lose, so if you're going to run PPP you need to
     set the asyncmap to escape as few as possible.

So, the advantages of PPP:

        - Dynamic negotiation of parameters, such as IP addresses.
        - Header compression.
        - CRC on each frame (not a big win for newer modems)

Disadvantages of PPP:

        - 3 bytes of extra overhead.

Why you would use:

SLIP:   You wouldn't, not if you could help it.  Demand at least CSLIP!

CSLIP:  You have an error correcting modem, a static IP address and you're
        a speed freak who'll miss the extra 3 bytes.  Because your
        provider doesn't offer PPP.

PPP:    Because you can. Because you need to send something other than
        IP over the link.  Because it's more convenient.

Hi,

I had the same problem this week-end! And now it is solved :-)
d) It is due to something else.... 
Well it is not quite oubvious to explain.
As you turned on the Buslogic 445s jumper for larger than 1Gb disks I assume 
that you did a translation on the head/cyl in order to have cyl<1024.
What I did is quite simple. In /etc/disktab you can specify the
geometry of your SCSI disk. Then specify here the translated geometry.
Now install lilo on your hard disk. And before booting modify /etc/disktab
and enter the geometry detected by the lilo fdisk (with cyl>1024).
It should work now... (I hope)

        Thomas E Zerucha (zerucha@shell.portal.com)
and     Steve Kneizys (STEVO@acad.ursinus.edu)
for confirming what we've been seeing!  I suggest we keep this thread 
open and fill it with additional information until the problem gets the 
attention it needs.  I'm not a programmer, much less a kernel hacker, so 
I can only voice frustration with the situation.

Some additional information gleened from observations:

First, the original problem as I originally mentioned it:  

We are running slip to our internet provider, and intermittantly
experience telnet lockups during logins.  The system either 1) refuses
connections 2) accepts the connection, but just sits 3) provides a login
prompt, takes input, and never gives the password prompt (ususally
creating a login zombie in the process). 

Additional information/trends noticed:

If the lockup occurs, allowing the telnet session with the locked
connection to sit while starting another is *always* successful.  It
*appears* that a particular ttyp# gets buggered somehow, and forcing the
system to seek another one will get you in.  I.E.  We've had *tons* of
complaints about ttyp1 and ttyp4 lately (although I've seen the problem
also on ttyp3 in the past). 

In the event 'refused connections' are the symptom to those telnetting in
over the SLIP connection, logging in by adding an x-term *on the console*
that grabs the offending ttyp port will suddenly allow SLIP telnet
accesses. 

I thought that once a user was successfully logged in, everything was
fine.  However, I have had complaints of 'gradual slowing' or 'gradual
slowing then locking' from a couple of users.  I intiially dismissed this
as 'net problems', but after hearing Michael Haardt's comment, I'm
beginning to think that's what's happening to us as well.  I also suspect
that other 'general' user complaints about our 'slowness' at times would
turn out to be the same thing as well. 

I have been experimenting with MTU sizes with ifconfig, but have no feel
for whether or not this has any effect.  I *have* noticed that MTU gets
reset to 1500 by *something* some random time after I've changed it (note
this is without system reboots). 

Here's a sample of what we have:

yiffy:~# ifconfig
lo        Link encap Local Loopback  
          inet addr 127.0.0.1  Bcast 127.255.255.255  Mask 255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU 2000  Metric 0
          RX packets 0 errors 0 dropped 0 overrun 0
          TX packets 39754 errors 7 dropped 0 overrun 0

sl0       Link encap AMPR AX.25  HWaddr 
          inet addr 198.30.162.1  P-t-P 199.18.108.11  Mask 255.255.255.0
          UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING  MTU 1500  Metric 0
          RX packets 1583360 errors 0 dropped 0 overrun 0
          TX packets 1995660 errors 0 dropped 16514 overrun 0

eth0      Link encap 10Mbps Ethernet  HWaddr 00:20:AF:16:4C:3E
          inet addr 198.30.162.1  Bcast 198.30.162.255  Mask 255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING  MTU 1500  Metric 0
          RX packets 293959 errors 0 dropped 0 overrun 0
          TX packets 285447 errors 0 dropped 0 overrun 0

Note that a few moments prior to running this, I had set sl0 MTU to 2000, 
and confirmed that the value was accepted.  Now it is 1500 again without 
any action on my part.

One last observartion.  When we first started with kernel 0.99.15, telnet
sessions were locking up when large amounts of data was to be sent *out*. 
That is, if someone did a large directory listing or other function with
lots of output, their session would hang.  The send buffer information in
'netstat' showed several thousand characters waiting to be sent, and the
session would be effectively frozen.  This problem was acknoledged by
others at the time, but as in this case, no answers were provided.  The
problem went away when moving to the 1.0 kernel.  So *something* was done
bye *someone* for that one. 

I'm new to all this, and don't know all the avenues to pursue.  I'd 
appreciate any help in getting this problem hilighted and information 
flowing to the *someone* who understands how the net interfaces really 
work and who can really and *finally* *fix* it!  How do we proceed?

I have noticed that when I run Lynx under Linux all available
options get highlighted instead of the ones I move my 
cursor to. 

We have setup a guest account which by default runs lynx when
a user telnets into our machine and logs in as guest. A new user
who has never used lynx before gets confused. We have received
mail from people who said they couldn't use it. 

The guest account automatically recognizes the terminal type of
user logging in. If for some reason it can't, it prompts the user
for that information. I do not suspect that the guest account is
not detecting the terminal type correctly, since I see the same 
behaviour when I run lynx on my machine under xterm, vt100 etc. on
this machine. 

If you have telnet access, open a telnet session to sparco.com and 
login as guest to see what I mean.       

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

        What is your Linux kernel configuration regarding following:
