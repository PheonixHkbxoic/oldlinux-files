I have a HP4M and I just use the following entry in printcap...

lp:lp=/dev/lp1:sd=/usr/spool/lp1:sh:if=/usr/lib/lpf:mx=0

The only other thing is a small script /usr/lib/lpf

#! /bin/bash
if [ "$1" = -c ]; then
        cat
else
        sed -e s/$//
fi
echo -ne \\f

All this script does is convert the lf to cr/lf..
This script works fine on all printers.. Although i don't think it will handle
binary files too well.. ie. PCL5...

This is nothing special..  It's taken right out of the printing howto..

Enjoy.

I agree!!
: of experimenting I would have to suggest that you use getty_ps, not
: agetty.  As a further tip, some modems seem to barf on the configuration
: files (either /etc/conf.uugetty or /etc/default/uugetty, depending on
: how you compiled getty_ps).  I've had some success with commenting out
: the INIT line in the file and letting the default compiled in work.
Yes, getty_ps is quite an improvement over agetty. I fought with my modem 
pool for quite a while, so here is a couple more hints:
Have a conf for every serial line (ie conf.uugetty.ttyS2, etc). My setup 
didn't seem to want to read the "generic" conf.uugetty.
Put "HANGUP=NO" in your conf. This keeps it from doing something obscure 
when it hangs up. My modems wouldn't hang up reliably until I did this. 
Now they seem to be working fine.

                  Later!

The question posed was: does the ftape that comes with slackware 2.0
work with the kernel that comes with slackware 2.0?
In my experience it definitely did not work with the command

% tar cvf /dev/ftape *

if * contained more than about 50k.
It bombed out with I/O errors.
It was clear from the logfile that there were over-runs
from which ftape did not recover.

You're obviously a kernel hacker.
Are you sure you used the version of ftape that came with slackware 2.0,
with slackware 2.0, unmodified in any way?

If so, what commands did you give (tar, afio, dd, etc)?
Please be explicit.

I looked at the code, and it seemed to me
that that particular version of ftape
was incapable of recovering from over-runs.
However, I could be wrong about that --
I didn't look carefully into it.

What is quite clear is that many other people
had exactly the same experience as me.

I would repeat my advice.
If you find ftape does not work,
update the kernel to 1.1.50
and compile the latest ftape with the ftape-irq-dma.patch.

It's not much help telling people
that ftape worked for you
if it doesn't work for them.

HFS will allow you to read high density Macintosh disks.  I believe it
is not possible for the drives in most PCs to read the 800K format.
Note this is a read only utility, I don't know of any way to write to
a mac disk.

This is not true. I run Selection all the time; in or out of X. And it doesn't
"make the mouse work"; it provides 'cut and paste' style copying between VTs.

Looks worth the effort to get the latest Net-2 and all. How do the

Which one is best? I noticed that one of the archive sites refuses

I am still interested in running SCO Unix binaries. Any info on that?

HELP!!! I am trying to install Slackware Linux.  I can boot up the setup 
floppies I made from the CDROM, but none of the kernels support my DTC 3280AS 
SCSI controller.  Does any one know of a driver for this module that I can 
use?  My CDROM is a SONY CDU31a compatible (at least the manual says so), that 
runs off of my SoundBlaster compatible audio module.  It is also not 
recognized by any Linux kernel.  Does anyone know of a driver for that one, 
also?

I -USED- to have everything running just fine, but somehow my active file

But doesn't Intel sell a chip that upgrades a 486DX-33 into a 486DX2-66?
How do they manage that?

Could someone try to explain it in somewhat technical terms (I'll try to 
understand).  I read in the Network Administrator's Guide that while this 
will solve the problem, it may slow connections with other UNIX machines.  
Why?  Is there anything that I can do to fix the PCTCP side of the connection
to work without this option enabled?
        Second question.  Whenever I boot up, I can't login remotely without
first doing something on the console to "wake-up" the connection on the side 
of my machine - i.e.  without logging in on console and using telnet or other 
network software, I can't log in remotely, or finger, or ping...nothing.  
I seem to have somewhat bypassed this problem by adding "route" into the 
rc.local setup file (I am using Slackware 2.0's distribution with 1.1.45 kernel
installed).  Any Suggestions?

                                        Brian
