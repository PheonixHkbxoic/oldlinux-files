Subject: color_xterm .... again
Date: 31 Aug 1994 07:45:58 GMT

Hi,

Ok, I haven't tried all possibilities: after setting *LoginShell: true in
..../app-defaults/XTerm if I type at the prompt

> color_xterm

the xterm comes up and it can be checked that .bashrc has been executed. Fine.

But if one click on "Color Xterm" of the menu "Shells" of openwin, that
xterm doesn't seems to execute .bashrc at all!! (Of course Xterm or Rxvt
from the menu do execute .bashrc.)

This "Color Xterm" menu is as follows

"Color Xterm (7x14 font)"               exec /usr/bin/X11/color_xterm -sb -sl 500 
-j -ls -fn 7x14

I added "-l", "-e /bin/bash -login", no use.

Could you help me again to complete the solution of this problem?

Best regards,
Jozsef Kadlecsik

If you use LILO, simply type 'linux S' at the LILO: prompt. (If that prompt 
doesn't appear for you, hit the Shift key when the word LILO is displayed, and 
you will get a prompt). This will boot your box in single-user mode.

I don't think it's quite ready for prime time yet. See the
file nimbus.anu.edu.au:/pub/tridge/samba/PROJECTS for the
author and current state.  But my tar will work if you don't
mind the cruft.  Arrange for a packet driver on the pc (either
native or one of the interface shims), and execute "tar --rshd"
on the pc(s).  Then run "rsh pc tar -cf c:/ -| dd of=tape_drive" on
the unix side, using the no-rewind device if you are doing more
than one.  The usual gnutar options work plus some stuff to support
the dos archive bit and other attributes.

I had the same problem & fixed it. FOr me the clue was that when I did "domainname"
I got the same name as when I got "hostname". If I changed one the other would
change too. I found domainname & hostname were linked together! So they were
the same program. I removed the link an made sure I had 2 seperate programs:
domainname & hostname. Then everything worked great. Until the next problem :-)

Do the "domainname" & "hostname" check & see what happens.

Reply-To: wkn@sun-valley.stanford.edu

I tried the "net.gz" boot disk but it can't find the Intel Ether
Express 16C.  It tried typing "ramdisk ether=3,0x300,eth0" at the
boot: prompt, but it still didn't work.  It says something about
3c305(?) not found.  Do I need to use the "reserve=" option that I saw
mentioned in another post?

So, is the Ether Express driver in the net kernel?  If not, how should
I go about installing Linux over the net with this card?  Will I have
to compile a kernel another Linux box, and if so, how do I put it on
the boot disk?

I finally discovered that there were two speeds:
the one which the two modems talk to each other 14400
and the speed linux talks to the modem 19200, 38400 or higher

Now everything is functioning perfectly.
I get CONNECT 14400.

The connection is *fast*.

There is no such file in the standard Linux kernel.  You must be talking
about a modified kernel here.  (what origin??)

I doubt that "most of us have this problem", given the fact that it is
not in the standard kernel, and cdu31a drives seem to be a pretty small
part of the CDROM market...
