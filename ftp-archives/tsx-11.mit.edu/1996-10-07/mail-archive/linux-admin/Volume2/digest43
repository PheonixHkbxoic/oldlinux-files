Look for the tool ttysnoop-0.11

It can monitor any login-line and is installed in the getty/telnetd- 
Process-Configuration-File (inittab/inetd.conf).

Works great for me.

Hi,
I used to run CNEWS under Coherent, and my newsfeed hasn't
changed, but in installing Ygg's CNEWS it seems very
different, with different locations for the binaries, (/usr/
lib/news/bin instead of /usr/lib/newsbin, and many of the
files are named differently.)
        
        I am receiving my news batches via UUCP and they
are being stored ok in /usr/spool/news/in.coming, but
there is no /usr/lib/news/newsrun command.  Can anyone tell
me what are the equivalent commands for unbatching news in
this version?  Can anyone post a complete cron file for news
in this environment?  Any help would be much appreciated.

        I'm trying to install an Iomega Insider 150 (removeable disk)

I finally got it and it was a little mistake:

while wanting to delete a wrong /dev/ty7 file, I accidentally removed
the device /dev/tty7, and when I created it again I entered 
'mknod tty7 c 4 6' so it pointed to tty6. And of course I completely
forgot that move as soon as I did it :-(

I tried alpha acct from GNU alpha archives and both last and ac
don't work. But ac.c from FreeBSD sources seems to be ok. I needed
to do some small corrections to compile.
GNU acct seems to be potentially nicer but I couldn't find anything
with gdb.

Speaking about ethernet cards, 
I had simmilar problems with the second serial port until I realized
the double usage of the IRQ. Check the IRQ number of the ethernet card 
and the second serial port. 
If they use the same IRQ change one of them. 
If you have a software setup program for the ethernet card (DOS), change the 
used IRQ. This will probably solve your problem.
hope this helps

I fear this is *bad* advice for Linux. My understanding/experience is
that if you fsck then don't sync before rebooting the repairs will be
lost. This is because the disk buffering takes place at the block
device level rather than at the filesystem level.

If the filesystem were mounted r/w then the sync would probalbly also
cause the fs to write out it's corrupt superblock as you suggest. This
is why one must never fsck a filesystem that is mounted r/w.

Before Linux can become a fast database server, it would better have a scsi
driver which doesn't busy-loop during SCSI reads or writes.  Currently a
Sun SS-1 with one disk is faster than an EISA-486-66 running Linux with 4
disks, running the same database server on both.  It should be the other
way round, with considerable difference.

There is nothing like the "best" place where to put a certain command
into your startup files.  Make sure, though, that your swap partition
is swapped on first, because partitions are faster than files.

It is normal, that starting the X server and a few applications on
an 8 MB machine causes some virtual memory to be used.

This is indeed strangs.  The total field should give you about 
7 Megabytes (1 Megabyte is eaten by the kernel).  Most likely,
you have a RAMDISK installed.  Set it to zero, either by
placing the line

        ramdisk = 0

into /etc/lilo.conf and running lilo once again.  Or use the

        ramsize

command to change the RAM disk size of your kernel image.

Why not ? For common usage utilities management, you can create a group of
"gurus" who have write permission in the /usr/local tree for example (owner:
root, group: gurus). They'll just have to take care of letting group write
permission for every new file or directory (umask 2).

If it's a good administrator, everything should work whithout his help, and he
can give give the root passwd to one of the gurus for a while.

Sudo can restrict root permission for a given list of programm (shutdown or

It's worst if they all have the UID 0: if they use su, they are conscient they
will be acting as root for a particular action and will be carefull. If they
have the UID 0, everything they'll do will be done as root, like changing his
password for example !

Everyone can make a mistake, root can't. One day I tried to delete all the
hiden file in a tree of directory (I was new whith UNIX), I used "rm -r
.*". ".*"  match "..", "../.*" etc... I let you imagine if I was root. Anyway,
what has been reported is definetly NOT a bug in the passwd program.
