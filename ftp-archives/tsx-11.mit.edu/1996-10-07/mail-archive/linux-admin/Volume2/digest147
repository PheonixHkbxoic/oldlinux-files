You should consider using LILO, the Linux Loader.  Apart from loading Linux, it
can also boot other systems, and I suppose NT won't be an exception.  Moreover,
it can boot DOS from the SECOND hard drive (impossible with plain DOS).

I'm trying to allow login to my Linux 1.1.45 system through the modem, but when 
I start agetty for the modem port, it goes right into the login prompt.  Is 
there a way to make this work?  My previous experience under SCO Unix was simply 
to spawn a getty for the modem port during the init phase, and it took care of 
itself from there.

There is a small bug in the net-tools-1.1.46 package. You have to rename
"domainname" to "dnsdomainname". The dnsdomainname program can only be used to
SHOW the DNS domain name (you can only set the DNS domain name with the
FQDN in /etc/hosts). To set the NIS domain use the domainname program from
the NIS package.

Subject: booting in single user mode?

Can you issue a "boot -s" type command to get into single user mode?

The problem is, my machine goes to init 6 (xdm) but X is not
configured properly, so it sits there and flicks in and out of sync
with the monitor, and I cannot do anything.  I need to be able to go in
and change the initial init state of the machine, and the easiest
way I can think of (with other UN*Xs) is to boot it into single user mode.

Any suggestions?  (not in the FAQ that I could find)

thanks,

Subject: Problem with static route table
Date: 4 Oct 1994 18:06:08 GMT


Hi everyone,

I have a problem with networking my Linux box.  I have Yddrasil Summer 94
Linux 1.1.0 #84 with NET-2 running.  I have set up my static route table with
local ip address of 128.178.10.1 and 128.178.10.2 for my Linux boxes with
netmask 255.255.255.0 and broadcast addr 128.178.10.255. The system is
on the same datalink.  My local network is 128.178.10.0.  My first
problem is "arp -a" returns nothing and when I execute "netstat -rn" I got
the error "route: unsupported address family 2560 !".  Any ideas ?  My 
ifconfig shows that my NIC card is running with arp up as configured.
Moreover, my xserver can't seem to run remote x-clients.  I keep getting
the message "can connect to calvin:0.0".  Thanks in advance for any advice.

Subject: /etc/utmp not writable by xterm's.  Why?
Date: Tue, 4 Oct 1994 16:43:49 GMT

The /etc/utmp file doesn't seem to record any logins via xterms ---
actually rxvt --- because of the permissions on /etc/utmp:

        -rw-r--r--   1 root     root          560 Oct  4 12:30 /etc/utmp

As I only login via rxvt these days, it's espicially important that
utmp capture these logins.

If I change it manually to 666, the logins are recorded, but when I
reboot, the perms get changed back.  Anyone know why?

More to the point, is there a better solution to this?

Hi,

We have one of these as well.
I configured it from the panel on the printer (IP number, netmask, gateway)
Told it to use the lpd protocol. This is enough for simpel use. 
I made a simple printerdefinition for a remote printer on my linux box and it
 works partly.
A remote printer does not read the inputfilter, so you need some workaround
for this. (make a shell script or something)
I haven't done this so far as I use it mainly for printing with dosemu or
bin files (ps files)

Any more questions can always be asked

There is another thing which gives scsi an edge over IDE but this
applies only if you use more than 1 disk. Using scsi you can access
every disk attached to without having to wait  for the disk ( controller )
to finish, this in contrast with IDE where you wait. For this reason 
the new ENHANCED IDE has two busses 1 for fast devices and one for slow
devices, notably cdroms.

Hopes this enlightens things a bit more

Oops... in my previous post I mentioned I "patched" this hole, but
forgot to mention how.

The problem is that the code fragment that opens the debug file uses
fopen() when it should use fopen_as_user(). In order to do this, it needs
to be moved down a bit, to right after smail does it's setuid/setgid (so
that seteuid works correctly). Also, fopen_as_user() will assume check_path
for this no matter what.

Here's the patch:

   Any suggestions?  (not in the FAQ that I could find)

If you are using a fairly new Slackware, you should be able to do a
"Ctrl-Alt-F6" and get a console.

I am running Linux on a HP Vectra M2 4/66 16mb. Runs great.. I did have to play
around with Xconfig. Since it uses a Cirrus Logic 5434 w/1mb.

If you like I will send you the xconfig for it.

There is a package on the net called hfs tools that allows access for
mac HFS floppies, similar to mtools for dos disks.

The version I have is 0.3, but don't ask me where it is.

Subject: POP3 Mail - Wont fetch?
Date: 2 Oct 1994 16:12:25 GMT



 I am currently running Red Hat beta Linux and POP3 mail. However, PC
 Eudoria refuses to "get" the mail. I can send fine and according to the
 boxes, I connect, log in and then bring a window with nothing. So. I am
 sure I am just missing a command somewhere on my linux box that POP
 needs to send the mail back. Anyone?

No. That isnt it. I have a .plan file and it still tells me "never
logged in" etc etc. Just diplays my plan file instead of a "No Plan"
message.


Also, has anyone compiled icsi-finger? I got the souce but its looking
for a file I dont have. An include sys/acct.h   Anyone?
