I've been slowly trying to get one thing working at a time since I installed
Linux on my PC several months ago.  I am currently stuck on FTape.  I have
a Conner 250MB tape drive.  I have also just done a clean install of the
Slackware 2.0.0 distribution.  The command 'mt -f /dev/ftape retension' works
fine, but to tar to the /dev/ftape device results in 'I/O error'.  The Conner
manual suggests a jumper be removed from the drive for Unix operating systems
that has something to do with auto-positioning.  This didn't make a difference.
Can anybody give me some hints as to why it's not working?

Here are several [Q's] I have.

1) I was using textedit to edit a file. I saved the file & got the
error message "Cannot save file: filesystem full". Or something 
similar. This is fine, except for 2 things. 

a) I have 120+MB free
b) The file was successfully saved anyway.

This happens anytime I save a file with textedit.

2) When I have any of the 2 filemanagers open I cannot save the workspace.
The problem is definately with the filemanager. I can save the workspace
when I don't have a filemanager running.

3) I cannot start rcp.statd. I get an error about a failed connection.

Help with any of these is greatly appreciated...

the shutdown messages will end up going to one of the VC's, probably 
VC1.  try Cntrl-Alt-1 right after you enter the shutdown command.

There is also a script, in /var/adm/scripts called gonzo.  This script
will install the three users listed above, and thus should also be 
removed.

One more small thing, the very useful utility, /usr/sbin/usermod
contains a VERY SERIOUS TRAP.  When it is used to change a current

Cops will find all these, but usermod probably should be fixed.

I just got Linux up its on

to run. Right now I use a generic vga card.
I see some accelerated cards are supported.
Which ones perform the best (used the most by X)?

Has anybody used /etc/ppp/ip-up script?

I set one up, but it doesn't seem to be executing at all...

Is there a command line option for it?

In the man pages for pppd it sais that if an /etc/ppp/ip-up file exists, it 
is executed as soon as the IP layer is available. I really need this 
feature, cause I have to do some ifconfiging and routing that pppd itself 
doesn't allow on the command line.

If ip-up doesn't work, is there another ellegant way to see if the IP is 
setup (that is chat is finished with logging in etc.)?

Thank You

You have to run a program to attach the two machines across the line. Did

amisetup and other programs that allow you to backup and tweak your BIOS 
really do the trick, but consider this... If you have already set the 
password to something AND set the boot sequence to C:, A:, then how are 
they going to get to DOS to run the BIOS programs?

I've been using minicom to dialup our campus and have been getting
intermittent line noise.  Every so often 4 or 5 garbage chars will
come across.  I was thinking that it was a modem problem until I was
unable to duplicate the problem under DOS (cough).  Yes, I have the
same init string in my DOS term program as I do in minicom: ATZ
followed by AT&F.

My mouse is a PS/2 type mouse...my modem is on COM3 IRQ 2, and that
doesn't conflict with any other cards.

Does anyone have a clue as to what-the-smeg is going on here?

It's also worth knowing that the ftp daemon changes it's root
to the ftp directory tree. This means that when ftpd uses
/bin/ls it gets translated by the system into ~ftp/bin/ls.
Also you must use hard links rather than softlinks if you want
to access a file that is outside the ftp directory tree.

well, as far as I know the point is, that a break at an v.24 is done
by setting the dataline for about 250 ms active. this behavior is an
property of the v.24 controling chip and can be activated by setting
an port to a sertain value.
though i dont know, i assume, that an io-ctl shuld be provided by the
driver or the programm via you access the v.24 shuld provide a hotkey
or the like.

hope have helped

You should get the source of ftape-1.13b on sunsite in /pub/Linux/...
and recompile it with the -DCONNER_BUG option enabled in Makefile.
But that doesn't work with the newest kernels. At me it works fine with 1.1.35

You can't blame it on me, either -- I only put it in rc.M. :^)

I've actually never had this problem of crond putting messages on the 
console on my machine, and haven't seen it on any others, or I would 
have fixed it. This solution does seem like it could be on the right 
track, though, and I'd be interested in hearing if the people suffering

Rubbish. 14.4kbps modems use the V32.bis protocol which permits data transfer 
at 14,400 _uncompressed_; if you also turn on data compression (V42.bis), you 
may achieve an effective transfer rate of 57600 kbps on compressible files. 
The difference between V32 (9600 bps) and V32.bis (14400 bps) is *NOT* data 
compression, but the number of channels (4 vs. 6) used to transmit data at 
2400 baud. (4x2400 = 9600, 6x2400 = 14400).

Try upgrading the networking 'application' and 'system' level software.
Grab NetKit-A-0.xx.tar.gz and NetKit-B-0.xx.tar.gz from sunsite.unc.edu
They shoud be in the '/pub/Linux/system/Network/sunacm/...' directory,
or similar.  Should fix a lot of problems.
