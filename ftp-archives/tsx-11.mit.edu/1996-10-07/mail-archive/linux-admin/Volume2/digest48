If seeing the commands the user issued is what you want, just patch the

Now I have to write some perl scripts to condense all of the info.

Subject: Price/Performance of Overdrive versus Pentium
Date: 10 Sep 1994 18:57:51 GMT


I am currently running Linux with a 486DX33, and I am getting around
a 16.7 bogomips rating.  I have the option of upgrading by simply
plugging in a 486DX2/66 or an Overdrive processor into the
motherboard to replace the CPU.  Is there a significant performance
advantage of going with the Overdrive processor as compared to the
486DX2/66?  What are people's opinions on the price/performance ratios
of these two alternatives?  Would it be more cost effective to simply
go with a full upgrade to a PCI motherboard with a Pentium processor?

Nah.  root don't need no stinking password!  Just "su" to the other user as 
root..  I can't however confirm whether up arrow works, though.

This is not true.  The definition supports 2 VLB slots at 50MHZ and 3 at 33MHZ.
I have seen 486DX50 VLB motherboards on the market.

Just did this, except I went to 1.1.50 release.  I started with the 1.1.45
tar file, and did the patches 46 through 50 sequentially from the /usr/src
directory.  Then I moved the .c and .h files (I think they were just
blkdev.h, ncp.h, ni52.h and ni52.c) created in /usr/src to the subdirectory
linux/include/linux, then moved entry.S to /usr/src/linux/kernel directory.
Did the standard makes and it booted on the first try!  Did it by modem
too...brave soul I am :)

Take care!

Kermit uses C strings. The string terminated at the NUL character.

If you wish to send a NUL to the remote, then use \N with version
5A(190). Earlier versions than this will not accept the sequence.

output \4\N\1\2\3\5\6\7
         ~~

Some remotes will ignore the framing error and see the NUL character
if you send them a break. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS IN ALL CASES,
however, it may work if you use the \B sequence to send a break.

If you want 5A(190), the source to cku190 is on kermit.columbia.edu in
the test directory. It will build if you simply issue 'make linux' or
'make linuxtcp' if you want to include 'telnet' mode of kermit.

Linux works perfectly - well, numerous bugs but ...- with WinTrump 1.0 Beta.
This is registered and works fine.  However, WinTrump 1.0 Alpha #18 does not
work with Linux.  Alpha #18 works with Annex term servers, SCO systems, and
suns.  Tried Linux 1.1.49, 1.1.45, 1.1.46 with and without the PC TCP/IP
compatibility option.
What does work with Alpha #18?  Everything except DNS queries!!!!!
Here's a tcpdump of 1.0 Beta. (Which works)

Esentially, it doesn't work.  Absolutely everything else works.  I'm at wits
end.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: How can I filter remote print jobs?
Date: 09 Sep 1994 17:18:56 GMT

I have a situation in my office where we have 5 printers in our office
connected to Novell Print queues and an lpd.nlm that processes print
requests from my linux network.  I need a way to filter printer data
before it gets to the lpd on my server.  My current setup is to use
lpr and a remote printer definition in my printcap.  Unfortunately,
this doesn't allow the data to be filtered through the apsfilter I was
using for two page printouts and Postscript conversions.

Someone suggested setting up two printer definitions, one local and
one remote and have the local one send its output ot the remote,
prefiltered.  I haven't been able to get this to work as of yet.  Can
someone give me an explicit example of how this is done or suggest
some alternative method that would allow filtering?  I like the output
produced by apsfilter.  Also, does anyone know where there is a version
of apsfilter later than v2.3?

Thanks,
