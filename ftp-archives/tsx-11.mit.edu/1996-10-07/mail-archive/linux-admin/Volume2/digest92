If my memory serves, these files are created by OS/2 on every
disk or partition and they have a space or some such inside the
name. Linux probably gets the space as a separator between two
file names and fails.

Date: 22 Sep 1994 12:24:11 GMT

I recently installed Linux from CD on to a 300MB drive.  
Running a 50Mhz 486slc with 8Meg RAM, but Xwindows is 
too slow to use, moving from one window to another it 
takes the system up to 30 seconds to catch up.  
The hard drive seems to thrash a bit and the CD is 
accessed at least once during this process. 
Would like to hear any ideas on this topic.

Has anyone had any luck getting a "Ensoniq Soundscape Wavetable Sound Card"
to work under Linux? (1.1.49). It SUPPOSIDLY has PAS-16 and SB-16
compatibility, but Linux seems to just ignore it (but, to be fair, a good
number of DOS apps (games, mostly) won't recognize it either).

I would like to get this running ....

I do not know if it is a linux question or not, the problem is
my printer -- HP laserjet III -- does not wrap long lines when
printer ascii files. What to do? 

The command I use: lpr -Pascii file
and the printcap looks like:

ascii:\
  :lp=/dev/lp1:\
  :sd=/usr/spool/lpd/ascii:\
  :if=/usr/spool/lpd/ascii/filter:\
  :lf=/usr/spool/lpd/ascii/errs:\
  :mx#0:\
  :sh

Where the filter is 

#!/bin/sh
# Filter for HP printers to treat LF as CRLF
# the ``echo -ne'' assumes that /bin/sh is really bash
echo -ne \\033\&k2G
cat
echo -ne \\f

Subject: Linux Install Probs.
Date: Tue, 20 Sep 1994 15:47:54 GMT

I am having problems installing Linux. I got scsinet.gz and
umsdos.gz from ftp.cs.columbia.edu. I was able to install them
on floppies ok. I then got disk sets a,ap,n,x, and u from there
and put them in subdirectories a1, a2, etc. of a directory called
slackwar. When I try to install I specify slackwar as the source
directory. It seems to accept that but then when it goes to install
each disk set it says that it cannot find the disks. 
   I therefore made floppies for disk sets a and u. When I try to install
it finds the disk sets ok but I get error msgs such as compress says
that there was a file format violation, tar saying that a premature
eof was reached, or that the file does not line up on a boundary.
I tried ftping new copies of the files to see if they were garbled but that
did not help. 
   I will check the checksums to see if they are ok, but, in the meantime
is there anything obvious that I am doing wrong? I forgot to mention that
for disk sets a and u I just copied the files from my HD using dos copy.
   Thanks,
   Joe

Hi there,

Thought this is a naive question but:

Do I have to have a sound card to play music?
Or I can just play it through the PC native speaker?

Though I am a newbie but I still looked at snd-driv-2.5 and got no clue..

Any hint is appreciated.

The Mach32 X-Server runs fine.
Try using the runx script of the svgalib package instead of startx.
This does not cure the invisible font problem of the virtual console
switch while in X-Windows.

Try calling DigiBoard.

They have a product the sits on a TCP/IP Ethernet network.
There is a deamon that runs on the unix box.  It creates
local tty's that are realy the ports on the terminal server.

When I ran SLS, I found a copy of the boot messages somewhere under
/proc.  Now that I'm running Slackware, I no longer have a copy of the
boot messages, under /var/adm or anywhere else I've looked.  This
clearly depends on how syslogd is configured.  I looked into it, but
haven't found the right combination.  Could someone post an example?

This is common practice (and, in fact, required by many TCP/IP protocl
stacks).  Whether or not it is "correct" is unclear.  It's quite
possible to implement routing using the same IP address on two
interfaces, if one of them is a point-to-point link (namely,
a slip line).  The idea of every physical network having its own
IP network is ideologically pure.  Ideological purity, while clean
and elegant, is often discarded in favour of optimizations.  Given
the current state of the IP address space, it could easily be argued
that wasting an entire network on a 2-host point-to-point slip line
is incorrect behaviour :)

Keep in mind that BSD is just the most prevalent TCP/IP
implementation, and not the definition of the protocols.
