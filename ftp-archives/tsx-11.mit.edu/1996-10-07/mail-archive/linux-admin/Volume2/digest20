We use an 8200 also. It gets accessed as /dev/rmt0. The only problem is that
sometimes, the SCSI cable connections aren't "tight" or other flakey cable
problems. Reconnect, Reboot and it runs. This sequence may take a couple
of tries but...

For me, the order doesn't make much difference, except
that it's easier to use GNU-tar like so:

    tar czf {outputFileOrDevice} {fileSpec}

and

   tar xzf {inputFileOrDevice}


Works for me!

Subject: What kernel/dosemu/netutils is stable?
Date: 1 Sep 1994 21:38:59 -0700

I need working dosemu and net stuff for a LAN.  It doesn't have to
talk to the Internet (yet) though I would like to use term.  After
being unable to get dosemu working with 1.0.9, I upgraded to 1.1.48
and dosemu pre53pl16.  Now dosemu works great, but a simple ping with
the old net stuff crashed the system.  So I upgraded to net utils
1.1.46 (the most recent I could find); after reboot the system crashes
within seconds after the daemons load, giving an error "tried to kfree
memory that was never kmalloced" or some such, then swapper killed.

Is there some combination that works?  Please advise.  Remember, I
need all three (dosemu, kernel, and net stuff).

Thanks in advance!

Simply put your qualified hostname in /etc/HOSTNAME... the initialisation
routines will parse it out of there.  Or you can (as root of course) invoke
"setup" and perform a "Configure" on your system including configuring 
networking (or simply run netconfig again), answer the questions, and you're
set.

I believe you are correct about the kernel versions being incompatible.  I also
believe that version 1.1.18 has some problems with PLIP.  The newer kernel
versions (1.1.4*) have pretty stable PLIP implementations, but I've found that
kernel version 1.0.9 is by far the fastest PLIP kernel that I've seen. 
Probably 1.0.8 is just as fast.

Also, you may want to check your cable.  Here's the pinout of mine, from a 
document I found via veronica.

\begin{plip.doc}

  This is the wiring diagram for the cable necessary to link two
  machines together by their parallel ports.  This is the same wiring
  diagram used by a Turbo LapLink cable, available for sale from many
  PC parts outlets.

  2 - 15

Your ifconfigs and routes look good.

Good luck!

I believe the problem is that ftp opens two tcp connections to a site, and the
problem is that you can only specify one alternate port to connect to.  From 
etc/services:

ftp-data    20/tcp
ftp         21/tcp

I'm not sure what port ftp-data tries to connect to if you specify an alternate 
port for ftp.

Um, I don't really like the idea of giving out Xconfigs, I figure everyone
should "roll their own" with the spreadsheet template provided by the
XFree distributions combining with your Monitor Specs. Check it out if you
haven't already.

My Diamond SS24X was purchased in Nov 1992. My monitor is a MicroScan 4A/ADI
15" purchased at the same time. I used the "freq" program to set a Clock at
80MHz. This is a bit over specs for my Monitor. But it hasn't blown in over
a year of this (and I'd like an excuse to buy a 17" anyway ;-). DIAL DOWN
the value from 80MHz TO BE SAFE. I have lower (e.g. 72 75 77 MHz modes there
as well, try them first, I am pretty sure they work for my setup)

Here is the relevant portion of my Xconfig. Ignore the 1072x768 mode I cooked
up: I use it to completely fill the monitor screen. I got 1152x900 to work
as well, but the characters weren't crisp enough and led to eyestrain.

Good luck and BE CAREFUL. Read your Monitor's user manual and use the
spreadsheet first, that's how I made these!

Subject: MediaVision SCSI and MediaVision CDROM - not good
Date: 3 Sep 1994 19:59:02 -0400

Hi all!

I'm attempting to mount/access/boot linux from CD.  I have
the following hardware:

        CPU:            Compaq Presario 650 (486DX2/50)
        Sound card:     ProAudio Specrtum 16 (MediaVision)
        CD-ROM:         Media Vision CDR-H93MV Rev. 1.32 (Feb 94)

Original problem - when booting kernel use to get:

        Detected scsi CD-ROM sr0 at scsi0, id 1, lun0
        scsi0: resetting for second half of retries,

        ... and then the system hangs ...

Got past it by rebuilding kernel with methods below.  The hints
were provided to me by users on the net (thanks Olav, Alex).

Built one kernel with the drive that I have inserted in
the black list of scsi.c.

The other kernel defines "NO_MULTI_LUN" in scsi.c so that
the kernel does not check for multiple logical unit unmbers.

The CD-ROM is defined in fstab as follows:

    /dev/sr0         /mnt/CD         iso9660 defaults,noauto,ro

Now my current problem is - mounting the CD-ROM. When I try to mount the
drive
with the mount command.

     mount /mnt/CD 

The CD-ROM drive access light becomes active.  The system waits for about
five
minutes.  The the following message pops up.  Another weird thing is that
when
linux is booted I cannot open the CD-ROM door - the open button has become
disabled.

mount: wrong fs type, /dev/sr0 already mounted, /mnt/CD busy, or other
error

The kernel is built with iso9660 file type, the drive is not mounted
so I don't think it is busy.  So ... it must be "other error" ...

Also used maknod to build /dev/sr0 with major number 11 minor 0.

Also download the new distribution and rebuilt new kernels with the same
results.

Any ideas what this other error could be?  And more importantly how I can
get
around it?  Please reply by mail my news access is flakey at best.

Thanks - StepheP@aol.com

Date: 3 Sep 1994 19:09:11 -0500

I just found a most heinous thing. I had my root password set to
'squiggle*halbert' a long, but good password.

However, by mistake, when su'ing, I only typed in squiggle and IT LET ME IN!
I further tested another password of mine that ended in a number and I left
off the number (i.e. Butthole7, only typed Butthole), and it again let me
pass.

So I need to know if I'm goofy and this is cool or did I find something that
everyone's known about or is it something new?

Running Linux v1.1.35 with shadow stuff (did it before shadow too).

OK, here's some more info about my mysterious serial port.  

  1) There is no mouse on my system.  ( I made an error about mentioning 
     seyon).

  2) Currently there is only one modem.  It is connected to /dev/ttyS0 or
     /dev/cua0 (both work).

  3) If I type setserial -a /dev/cua0, I get the expected response which is
     all the info about the serial port.  If I type setserial -a /dev/ttyS0
     I get a message saying that the device or resource is busy.  I expected
     this since this is the device I am using for the SLIP connection, which
     is working fine.

  4) If I type setserial -a /dev/cua1 or setserial -a /dev/ttyS1, I get a 
     message saying that the device or resource is busy.

  5) When the machine is booted, the startup messages indicate that the
     two serial ports are recognized as /dev/ttyS0 and /dev/ttyS1.  Both
     of these ports are 16450's.  They are both on the same multi i/o
     board.  This card also has the disk controller's, parallel port and the
     game port.

  6) When I try to use kermit or run a getty on /dev/cua1 or /dev/ttyS1, I
     get a message which says that the device or resouce is busy.

  7) I am unable to locate any LCK* files for /dev/ttyS1 or /dev/cua1 
     anywhere on the hard disk.  THe only ones I do find are for /dev/ttyS0
     which is busy with the slip connection.

I would like to thank the people who have already made suggestions for things
to check.  Unfortunately none of these suggestions have panned out.  If 
anybody has any other ideas, I would really like to hear them.  I am 
about to get another phone line installed here next week, and I would 
like to have this problem solved by then.  I need to install the second 
modem on this machine.

Thank you for all your help.
