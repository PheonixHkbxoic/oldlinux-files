I'm not sure what you're trying to say exactly, but I can tell you
that echoing is turned off during file transfers.  This prevents
your keystrokes from messing up the progress meters.

Subject: FTP via TERM
Date: 30 Aug 1994 22:29:49 GMT

Hi.
I have been pretty successful at setting up a telnet service to my Linux
machine using the term package, from school. So anyone who telnets to a
specified port to my school machine automatically connects to my home linux.
This was done by tredir 5000 23 on my school account.

Unfortunately redirecting FTP this way fails. Ftp logs the user in but then
hangs and has to be killed. I have absolutely no idea why this is so.

If anyone has telnet and ftp running via term, could you please clue me in on
this?

Thanks,
Jagadeesh

It's possible. You can use two identical Ethernet cards if they are
configured to use different addresses and IRQs (i.e. no hardware
conflicts).

If you use two identical cards, you have to tell the kernel where to
find them - only one would be autodetected. You can do this either by
editing drivers/net/Space.c or by giving the kernel an appropriate
command line using LILO (ether=..., I don't know the exact syntax).

Linux doesn't fulfil all requirements of the router RFC, but for normal
use, it's OK. If you use an 1.1.* kernel, don't forget to recompile the
kernel with IP forwarding enabled.

You should try to get along with static routes. This is nearly always
possible. If not, don't run routed, but gated.

If you aren't an experienced network administrator, you should read the
Network Administrators Guide by the Linux Documentation Project (NAG),
to be found on sunsite and other Linux ftp servers.

Amen, and amen.  Worthy sentiments, my friend.  How do you get something
better unless you are always looking to improve the current state of
things?  If Linus had stopped at getting gcc to run, we wouldn't have 
Linux.

Well, I hope you're open to *positive* comments.  You're not alone in your
feelings.

Well, as an inspiration, one set of very good admin tools are the SGI
Vadmin tools.  If you have access to an SGI box, you can take a look at the
User Manager, NFS Manager, etc.  You still need to have some concept of how
things work in the Unix world, but it takes away most of the "icky" parts.
Seems rather robust, too - I never had it do something other than what I
intended :-).

Another decent admin tool is (or at least 4 years ago, was) smit on the
IBM RS/6000 machines.  It was a non-X app for managing admin tasks, and it
seemed to get the job done pretty well (although it probably had
too many levels of menu to traverse).

>I'd volunteer for contibutions to such a project _if_ there will be a team.

So would I.  I would *love* to do this kind of stuff.  I have very little
time to dink around with stuff, but I'd volunteer to help on a project like
this.  heck, i'd even be willing to learn IRC to do something like this

It seems to be inside a (read-)system-call. Then there is no solution but

Hi Folks,

I'm having a problem. We have several users on a linux machine that
have the username in the form "DDNNNNN", where Ds are letter and Ns
are numbers (e.g. CL94083). Well, the problem is that whenever someone
trys to send a message to those users the message bounces back and
smail says the user doesn't exist. This doesn't happen for users with
"normal" username (with only letters). Does someone know what the
problem is? Will I have to change all usernames to usernames without
numbers? Is there a way to fix this? 

Thanks for the help, and I'm sorry if that is a really dumb question
or a FAQ. 

Regards,

Im trying to find out exactly what the BRK key on older Vt100 class terminals
does.

We are attempting to use a Linux box to be the console for a large number
of processing machines. These machines are all hooked up to the Linux
box through a Boca 16 port board. These machines ocasionally need to be
stoped and worked on. When we had terminals, we used the BRK key to interupt
the kernel and drop down to the EEPROM monitor.

I need to find out how this occurs so that I can try to figure a way to
emulate this function on the Linux keyboard.

If anyone knows, or can tell me how to do this, please respond via e-mail

Just a guess, but have you tried creating an empty one?

touch /usr/adm/wtmp

On my system, the real wtmp is in /var/adm, and there are symbolic links
to it from /usr/adm, and /etc...I looked at the man page for login, and
it seems to use the /var version...Instead, you might try:

touch /var/adm/wtmp

... interesting.

I started to write an accounttool under XView, which I considered as the
starting point for a series of tools for the administrator. It should
add/modify/remove users from the system, but it is such a mess whith the
shadow password (are they official or not?), so I got a bit frustrated.
In order of that and other reasons, I suspended it. I never finished it
(although there exist a running prototype).

And, unfortunetaly, I have nearly no idea, what is really required by users
(administrators). Of course I'm an admin, and I'm claiming that I'm a good
one --- on my own system. I'm not a typical one (obviously, since I'm
not connected to the Internet, nor do I use dip, slip, ppp, or receive news,
and, and, and ...)

I also claim that I am good at writing user interfaces,
so I would very much like to contibute to a project ``admintools''.
But I really need to know, what is required. I need to know the real needs of
some real admins, as I want to do something useful instead of a yet-another-
nice-but-useless-tool.

As Linux is a do-it-yourself-OS, I'm afraid that my offer/announcement
is the best thing which can happen to you. I heared about some tools
writen with tcl/tk, but that's long ago and I've never seen them.

You and many people who find Linux administration cumbersome or even
a nightmare are right: An easy to use interface for the administrator is
required. Even worse, the lack of such tools might keep potential users
of Linux away. OK, one of the gurus might think now: Why this? UNIX always
has been this way, so why the efforts for such nonsense?
This ``argument'' reduces to: That has been always like this, and that's it!
which is an argument for nothing (I even suspect that those guys fear about
their state as guru). Every effort to enhance the user interface
is worth to be made. Conversely, nobody is forced to use an admintool.
Please, I'm not interested in comments to the last paragraph, neither by
news nor by mail, please redirect them to /dev/null.

So, what is to do now? If such a set of tools for administration is really
wanted, then a group of users (the admins) and programmers, should determine
_first_ the real needs of the average admin. And then we can go coding.

I'd volunteer for contibutions to such a project _if_ there will be a team.
