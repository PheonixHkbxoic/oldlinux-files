I've been wanting to have X here, especially since I've seen Mosaic on
Windows and would like to run it here, instead of having to reboot
to the DOS side and fire up Windows, Trumpet, etc, etc.
 
Where is it and, more importantly, how much room will it take up?

Thanks!

That is highly unusual.  Most Xterminals do not run local window managers.
It is almost always an optional add-on, hence additional cost, hence
the vast majority of the ones I have seen do not.

In general, the advantages of a local window manager client usually
do not outweigh the cost of the option (at least, this is what my
research tells me).  Opposing opinions are welcome, any new findings
will be added to the comp.windows.x Xterminal FAQ/Guide.

Pardon, but I don't think this is correct.  Most 2 wire modems multiplex
the bandwidth and *do* allow simultaneous bi-directional data flow.  You
may be thinking of some data protocols that require packets to be
acknowledged by the receiving end before sending additonal ones, but this
has nothing really to do with what is flowing on the line itself.  I
haven't seen real 'line-turn around' modems since dealing with some
ancient Burroughs stuff nearly 20 years ago.  And even then the more
common 300 bps 2 wire modems *most* people were using were bi-directional,
using 4 tones, 1 pair to code 1's and 0's going one way, and the other
pair for data going the other.

The shadow password suite 3.3.2 was referred to in the XFree86 3.1
README. However, I couldn't find it. The latest I found from
comp.sources.misc and Linux archive site is 3.3.1. 

There seems to be some legal issues with it too; I see some GPL shadow

Be sure to build your kernel from a clean and well-configured source tree.
In order to do that your best bet is to untar (or copy) a fresh source tree
from your CD. Then run "make config;make dep;make clean;make zImage" in the
top directory and everything should go fine.

For further enlightenment about kernel compiling, you should have a look at
the kernel sources' README.

Date: 9 Oct 1994 14:51:41 -0400

Hi, I've have compiled the kernel 1.1.52 and it works. Now, I want to 
install Linux on an IBM PS/2. I couldn't because the kernel that comes with 
the Slackware distribution (1.0.9) doesn't support the MCA architecture. 
But the new kernel does support it!

My question is: Does somebody know how to create a "boot disk" and/or a 
"root disk" as in the Slackware distribution? With that I should be able 
to install everything I want. But I need to have the PS/2 booting from 
the new kernel!

Thanks,

This all works in theory, but unfortunately as umount(8) is already
setuid root, it doesn't work in practice. Yes, the computer reboots
fine, but it doesn't unmount the disks, causing an fsck to happen at
the next startup.

This is because umount can be run by ordinary users when (for example)
unmounting a floppy, and it needs to update /etc/mtab. So umount
ignores the EUID of a user (since this is normally root) and only
allows the root filesystem to be unmount by someone with a UID of 0
(ie the superuser).

I don't think there is *any* elegant solution to this umount problem.

Reply-To: alansar@ccs.neu.edu

Hi,

I'm having a strange problem with XFree-3.1 used with an Orchid
Fahrenheit VLB card in 16 bpp mode. X starts up but the colors I get
are not right. For example a light blue color looks greenish. I
suspected this had something to do with the 565 default weight, so I
added the option -weight 555, and the colors were all right again, but
there was one more problem. That made the depth 15, and some programs,
like xv, complained about not knowing how to handle 15-bit displays
and thus did not display anything.

Is there any fix for this problem? I know someone with the exact same
video card who does not have this problem. I'd really appreciate any
help on this.

Thanks a lot.

Try something like:

if [ -f /var/swapfile ]
then
    /sbin/swapon /var/swapfile
else
    echo "Now creating swapfile..."
    /bin/dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swapfile bs=1024 count=4096
    /bin/sync
    /bin/sync
    /sbin/mkswap /var/swapfile 4096
    /bin/sync
    /bin/sync
    /sbin/swapon /var/swapfile
fi
======== cut cut cut ================

in your /etc/rc.d/rc.local startup file somewhere.

This should start swapping on /var/swapfile if it exists, and if it
doesn't, then it creates a 4megabyte one.

The number 4096 is the size of swapfile it creates if one doesn't
exist: you'll probably need to change it to something more
suitable. It is expressed in kilobytes.

PPP uses the standard ioctl operations to initialize the tty driver.

You may run it with any rate that setserial will support. The PPP
driver and daemon does not care. It simply uses the tty driver for its
communication.

It does care that the driver be for an asynchronous link as it does
the Async-HDLC protocol within the ppp.c driver. If anyone is planning
on developing a bit-synchronous serial driver, then I'd be happy to
hear from you to talk about the changes needed to support PPP over a
synchronous link.

(Don't try byte-synchronous. It is not designed for this type of link.)
