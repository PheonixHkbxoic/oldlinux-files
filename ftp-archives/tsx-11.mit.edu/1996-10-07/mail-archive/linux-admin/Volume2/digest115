I can tar the /usr/lib/news dir but it won't help..  the problem is
that inn gets an ip address when you connect and tries to resolv that
into a machine name.  the syslog errors show that it can't resolv
localhost into 127.0.0.1  (which means it can't resolv 127.0.0.1 to
localhost).

try adding this to your /etc/hosts file

127.0.0.1 localhost

*or*  if you are using a name server you need to add a few lines to
named.boot

namely.

0.0.127.IN-ADDR.ARPA    named.local

and add /etc/named/named.local (assuming your named dir is /etc/named)

@    IN   SOA  dns.crocker.net. matthew.dns.crocker.net. (
                           1994090101 ; serial

                           86400 )   ; minimum
        IN      NS      dns.crocker.net.
1       IN      PTR     localhost.

see if you can nslookup localhost.   if you can't then inn won't be
able to either.  its not a problem with inn, its with the resolver
stuff..


If you need anymore help, I should be at our site later today (I'm at

I found several drivers that need to be installed in the kernel.  I tried
all of them (with both 1.0.9 and 1.1.45 kernel source) and neither worked.

Can anyone point me to a *WORKING* driver and docs?  And, will I need
1.1.45 source or can I just use 1.0.9?

Greetings All,

        Does anyone know if there is code available to enable Linux
to do disk mirroring?  We would like to configure our Linux boxes to
write to two drives simultaneously (two identical local drives per Linux box).
The idea is to have a ready warm spare harddrive with all the current
data present and ready to be made active if the primary should fail.

        Will we run into problems trying to use 3gig or > hardrives?  I've
seen some posts about cylinders > 1024 being a problem to Linux.

Thankyou one and all for any help!

Go to sunsite and get /pub/Linux/INDEX.whole,  you won't be sorry.  it
will save a huge amount of time when you are searching for stuff..

the linux kernel is in /pub/Linux/system/kernel/v1.1/  (I think)

you need to get linux-1.1.45.tar.gz and then all the patch4#.gz files

once you get the files you can.

cd /usr/src
mv linux linux-1.0.8
mkdir linux-1.1.45
ln -s linux-1.1.45 linux
tar -xvzf linux-1.1.45.tar.gz
cd linux
make config ; make dep ; make clean ; make zlilo ; rdev -R /vmlinuz 1
; shutdown -r now

You want to do this,  *dont* ever remove working code until you *know*
that the new stuff works.

I am also assuming you have added an image for linux.old =
/vmlinuz/old

its always a safe bet..

Doom is a strategic product for an OS like Linux
because you can't convince someone to forget DOS
and switch to Linux as long as his or her favorite
games does not run.

You don't believe me?

Well, then you are smarter than Microsoft and IBM together.
They have their own development task forces devoted to the
port of DOOM to Windows95 and OS/2 respectivly.

C'mon, games are fun *and* games are a serious driving force

I'm using "idleout" myself and this is still causing the problem with
not all the processes dieing.  For example, every once in awhile I get
a bad connection when I dial into my machine from a remote location.
When that happens, sometimes the modems will drop the connection.
When that happens processes are still left hanging around.  I have
idleout set to kill off idle users that haven't done anything for more
than 90 minutes.  After about 90 minutes, idleout will reset the
connection but sometimes some processes will be left.  I've seen
idleout kill off everything except the tin process I was using.

I suspect there is something not quite 100% with either the driver, or
else my uugetty configuration.  Any tips or pointers?

This is definitely NOT true, in my experience.
Most if not all earlier versions of ftape did not work,
however you configured them.

To get ftape to work, you must upgrade to Linux 1.1.50.
You must then get the latest version of ftape, ftape-1.13b,
and apply ftape-irq-dma.patch to it,
available from sunsite.unc.edu 
(I think in pub/Linux/kernel/tapes).
