I added a scsi drive & made lilo boot from that device,
/dev/sda1.

But rdev -R /vmlinuz 1; lilo does not work as usual, the 
filesystem is not checked.

I'd appreciate any help, thanks.

X-Mn-Key: IBCS2

Hello,

I  am sending  this letter/article  to  several people  (Michael Beck  for
PCSNDRV, ibcs2  Mailing list, Patrick Volkerdinck  for Slackware) and also
to  the comp.os.linux.admin  newsgroup because I  hope we  can come  to an
agreement on this topic before the "official" 1.2 kernel is released.

I  detected the following device  number clash a couple  of months ago al-
ready but was too lazy to do anything about it.

The problem is this:

1)  in the Linux Device Map, the major number 30 is unallocated:
    [taken from LINUX.DEVICES.TXT List; Last revised:  April 26, 1993]:
    ....
     20.  DP8390-driver .  (character) ..  wd[0-3] ec[0-3] ne[0-3]
     21.  Sony-CD-ROM ...  (block) ......  sonycd
     22.  2nd AT-Cntrlr .  (block) ......  hd1[a-b]<[0-8]>
     23.  Mitsumi CD-ROM   (block) ......  mcd
     31.  Link Interface   (character?) .  ???


2)  in the PC Speaker Driver, the major number 30 is used (but
    apparently was never officially registered):

    [taken from linux/drivers/pcsnd/pcspinstall]:
        Michael Beck            beck@informatik.hu-berlin.de

        Alternate Sound-driver for Linux 0.7

        This script creates the PCSP-driver devices and make links
        to the VoxWare-devices.

        It will create the following devices and (optional) the corresponding links:

        /dev/pcsp    PCSP device        (30, 3) (simulate /dev/dsp)
        /dev/pcaudio SPARC audio        (30, 4) (simulate /dev/audio)
        /dev/pcmixer PCSP mixer         (30, 0) (simulate /dev/mixer)

    [taken from: MANIFEST file in Slackware 2.0.1]:
    crw-rw-rw- root/sys       30,0 Jul 18 09:08 1994 dev/pcmixer
    crw-rw-rw- root/sys       30,3 Jul 18 09:08 1994 dev/pcsp
    crw-rw-rw- root/sys       30,4 Jul 18 09:08 1994 dev/pcaudio


3)  in the iBCS2 development, the major number 30 gets allocated also,
    and apparently also without official registration:
    [taken from ibcs/README]:
    5. The interfaces to some subsystems occur at the device layer and thus
       you need to create some device files in order to use them:

        * /dev/socksys and /dev/nfsd - interface for SVr3 STREAMS based
          TCP/IP applications

          # mknod /dev/socksys c 30 0
          # ln -s /dev/socksys /dev/nfsd

        * /dev/X0R - server side of SVR3 local X interface
          (see comments in Doc/Local-X)

          # ln -s /dev/null /dev/X0R

        * /dev/spx - client side of SVR3 local X interface
          (see comments in Doc/Local-X)

          # mknod /dev/spx c 30 1

    [taken from: MANIFEST file in Slackware 2.0.1]:
    crw-rw-rw- root/sys       30,0 Jul 18 09:09 1994 dev/socksys
    crw-rw-rw- root/sys       30,1 Jul 18 09:09 1994 dev/spx

So... there's trouble ahead...

Please, Michael, and please,  iBCS folks, can we find a  couple of numbers
which are mutually exclusive?

I _know_ this means a _lot_ of trouble anyway, since many header files ha-
ve to be changed and the sources recompiled and the devices have to be re-
moved and recreated.  I solved this  at home by  modifying one of the  two
defines:

  linux/include/linux/pcsp.h:
    #define PCSP_MAJOR              30

  ibcs/Makefile:
    SOCKSYS_MAJOR=30

But anyway.. the sooner we do it the better, right?

Sorry for bothering you,
    Martin

Hi,

I am interested in knowing what administration shells exist for Linux.
I've asked this question before, but received nearly no response at all.
I am interested only in distribution quality shells that exist on FTP
sites for general use.

Please!!! This is important!!! Please write to me if you know of any that
exist.

Thanks in advance,

        Well ... I did program my own getty for that purpose.
        It puts the speed and protocol settings to environment
        variables and invokes login so that it'll preserve
        the environment for the shell ( -p option )

        All interested parties please mail.

        I might consider a ftp upload but it's really an 
        Alpha-Alpha release and uses many features that might not
        work with any other configuration but my own. It's
        not hard to program one, however.

Subject: Linux as a Xserver
Date: 21 Sep 1994 19:25:05 GMT

Ok.. I'm not sure if this can be done, but i think it should..

I've got a linux with x on it, and a Sun Sparc with Solaris on it..

I can run x apps over ethernet with no problem, its pretty impressive..
What I'd like to do though, is setup a bunch of linux boxes with minimal
configuration / software which will access the Sun's X enviornment.

What i'm trying to get at, is that I dont want to just run the xapps
from remote, I want to run the sun's everything, from the sun, displayed
on the linuxs..  Like an X terminal.  Is this possible?   

Thanks..

        Anyone working on the HPFS filesystem?

        I've already posted to comp.os.linux.help and they directed
        me here.

        Is anyone trying to make HPFS read/write? I'm not the only
        one interested.

        Also I seem to get strange error messages about missing
        files of pattern 'eadata.*' even with ls...

        ( Means: <file>: No such file or directory , where file
        is something starting with eadata )

        I might begin to work with the project myself, but I'm
        not really a kernel hacker and know nothing about the
        internals of any filesystem. I might do some testing though.

        Thanks in advance ( I hope :-)

The README tells you something about X (read: xmodmap) sending

worse: you cant get ":", so changing drives is a no-go :-(

Has someone a 'useable' xmodmap for use with dosemu?

Subject: Need help crawling in ext2fs
Date: 19 Sep 1994 13:21:07 GMT

Hi all,

Through a slip of the mind and my thumb, I managed to delete the
contents of my /usr/bin directory. (rm $$$ * instead of $$$*). I
don't normally run as root to avoid these things, but I su'd just
to delete a couple of files I'd renamed to old.$$$$$.

Anyways, I pulled the plug, hoping I'd be lucky and that somehow
the original info will be on the drive somewhere. It's been a 
couple of days, and I haven't attempted to boot into Linux till
I got some suggestions.

I can get into the drive via Norton diskedit, and have tried to
search for some of the names but have had not luck. Anybody know
how ext2 keeps track of files & inode info? I've done it in DOS,
editing the directory entries (just giving 1st letters to the
files) and with OS/2's eas, following FAT entries. But with ext2fs,
what should I be looking for ?

Luckily, right before this happened, I did a "frag / > file.name"
so have a full list of what I'm looking for. (thanks to diskedit).

And yes, I've tried to skim the net for any tech info on ext2fs,
but all I've come up with is non techical stuff.

Any help will be appreciated, TIA.

Why has the loopback route a destination 127.0.0.1 instead of 127.0.0.0
in accordance with the specified netmask?
The loopback interface could have IP address 127.0.0.1 and connect to
a loopback network 127.0.0.0 with netmask 255.0.0.0 (conceptually)

About assigning the same IP address to multiple interfaces on the same
host:
One could argue that this is "correct" as long as the outer world cannot
see any difference. Consider all interfaces as one big specially designed
interface with the software (linux) hiding the differences. So, as long
as the software supports this concept it is correct IMHO.

*************************** END OF MESSAGE FROM FILE..

(sorry for the \)

My motherboard is set right (I talked to company 1).
the SCSI card is at INT A as the motherboard.
the selection failed is a old thing from when another SCSI disk died.


** QUESTION

Do you see where the problem is ?
what interupt do you mean in the message ? INT or IRQ ?
Does Linux require BIOS on the SCSI card (my is BIOS-less) ?


Thanks in advance.. 

Dejan.

CTLR-H works for backspace/delete. The arrow keys work normally. Now I can
use QEDIT ( a popular ms-dos editor ). Thanks to Todd, the "Mad Viking"

submitted, hopefully to be included in pre53_21 or so..

I tried xdos -C, it didn't load the emulator. Then I tried xdos -CV and it
worked ( "DOS in a BOX" starts up). 

But first I had to make a "bootdisk" file (see lines 371-378 in
/etc/dosemu.conf). Booting from this floppy-image is faster than booting
from the physical floppy.

These are the last 2 lines in my autoexec.bat in floppy-image
(var/lib/dosemu/bdisk).

lredir d: linux\fs/d
lredir c: linux\fs/c

 Drive A: in the emulator accesses the floppy-image
file. How to access the real floppy? Mount the floppy in a linux window in
the go back in dosemu and use lredir?

Hello all,

Could someone tell me whether I can get the 486 ASUS SP3G m/board in the UK?
My search did not produce any fruit.

I am interested in running linux+ncr scsi properly.

Thanks,
Angelo

However, you can access Linux files from DOS when running DOSEMU.

Subject: app-defaults directory in Yggdrasil
Date: 21 Sep 1994 20:35:35 GMT
Reply-To: lholmes@olympic.ctron.com (Lance Holmes)


I've got the min installation of Yggdrasil on my system.  I'd like to add
an X windows application but I cant seem to get the x software to look in 
the right directory.  I'm not familar with all the details on admin of X
so I assumed that X will look in a directory called /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults
for the apps default file for that application.  The problem is in the 
Yggdrasil version of linux it looks some where else.  Normally the 
directory /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults is on the cdrom.  I created a directory
and all the sub directories and I also created soft links to all the other
files and directories contain in that path but when I try to start my 
new application I still get the message that No app-defaults file.
If someone knows how to admin X and define where the app-defaults are
located I'd appreciate hearing from them.

thanks

Lance Holmes
