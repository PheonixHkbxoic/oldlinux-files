Subject: ftape and FC-20 controller
Date: Mon, 03 Oct 94 22:23:59 -0800

I have a Colorado 250-mb tape drive connected to the floppy controller. It
works fine with MS/DOS. I have v1.1.51 of Linux, and the latest ftape with
all the patches. It won't work. I consider the possibility that it won't
work because there's something weird about my el cheapo floppy controller.
I decide to invest in an FC-10 tape controller, and figure that this is
bound to work. I called up a couple of stores, and learned that the FC-10
is not a current product, and it's been replaced by the FC-20. So, the
question is, will ftape work with the FC-20?

Date: Thu, 6 Oct 1994 19:11:54 GMT

Has anyone been able to compile wuftpd 2.4 on a recent install of slackware.  
Or even an old one.  I had it running 6 months ago, but now I can't get it to 
compile.  It seems to have a problem with a struct statement in one of the 
includes.  I also tried to apply the linux patch but it said it was already 
patched.  

Any thoughts?

Does anyone know of a patch that will add user process accounting

which do not work beyond that.  Or at least I don't have skill to patch

Date: 04 Oct 1994 05:26:17 GMT
Reply-To: wescott@acm.org

I seem to remember someone posting here about having the init process
respawn pppd whenever the ppp link goes down.  I tried the following
line in my /etc/inittab, but had a few problems:

pp:345:respawn:/usr/local/sbin/pppd &>/dev/null

The problems I had were that sometimes when restarting init with 'init
q', init would complain that it was respawning too fast and disabling
for 5 minutes.  However, if I got a ppp link going, 5 minutes later
the process would be respawned, thus killing the link.  Very
frustrating ...  What process does it check to see if it needs to be
respawned is my question.  Or, how can I change my inittab to make it
work?  Any help is appreciated.

Use a PPP implementation that supports "camping," a form of "demand
dialing" where the systems bring the link back up as soon as it goes
down.  I bet that many PPP implementations that support full demand dialing
can have their timeouts adjusted to give the same effect.  Or just
use `ping -q` to keep the link active.

Another possibilty is something recently posted on
comp.os.linux.announce:

smail -d -D/etc/i_am_broken noon@universe

makes an /etc/i_am_broken file, which can be edited by group "users". It 
wokes very well for .rhosts files too. 

A fix to the .rhosts problem is to add the -l option to rshd and rlogind 
lines in the /etc/inetd.conf file. This option prevents the use of the 
.rhosts files for loging in.

Who knows what the tin security hole is?

Cheers!

To change the initial startup mode, edit /etc/inittab. Mine has:

id:5:initdefault:

near the top of the file. In this example, I boot up in run level 5.
According to the man page for init, if you do not have this line in
your inittab, you will be asked for a runlevel at the console at boot
time. Best bet though is probably just setting it to 5.

We have a network of 5 linux systems running .47 and .50 with three
being used as dialup systems (with digiboards).

Since each has 8 modems on them we are finding this problem to be both
valid and *very* annoying. Our latest suspect is bash but we're pretty
baffled.

We've even written a program designed to detect and inform us when someone
has dropped carrier and has a run-away process so we can go kill them
off manually.

I wonder why you care....

Packet sniffer make life easy when debugging problems, many people can't 
afford a wonderful little box called a network monitor, or whatever you 
want to call them.  Sniffers also help when trying to determine where 
certain type of electronic attacks are coming from, as opposed to your 
roomate booting up single user and changing roots password.

Security through obscurity, whether by not explaining algorithms, or by 
not distributing tools is not the way to go.

If you want to prevent sniffing, install SKEY.  This provides you with a 
relatively secure one time password system.  Takes couple hours to 
install, and about 15-20 minutes of reading to fully understand.  People 
can sniff all they want on your system, you never use the same password 
to log in from unsecure areas.

HI,
Twice this morning, my Linux networking component stopped working.  I had
named running so when my station didn't communicate to the outside world, I
thought named has failed.  I killed the named process, restarted but nothing
work.  I then ping'ed some hosts using the real IP address - nothing work.

I shut down the system, brought it back up.  Everything worked again.  
A while later, the same problem re-occurred.

I looked at log files in /usr/adm and found this:
   Oct 7 08:11:13 viper kernel: redirect from 01af6180

01af6180 is the IP hex number of my router (128.97.175.1)

Can someone tell me what the "redirect from 128.97.175.1" means??
This machine has been running solidly for at least 3 months now.

I'll take a look at aumix myself (I'm assuming it's on sunsite). My
guess is that the author might have relied on erasing functions taking
the current attribute in account. As pointed out by Eric S. Raymond
this behavior did not conform to SVR4.

I'm afraid the latter :-( I'm slowly getting back but it is much slower.
I don't know if 1.8.6 fixes your problems but if you want to test it
drop me a line.

Sure it does! see curs_set() and the cnorm/civis/cvvis capabilities

You need to add the setuid bit on passwd and chsh.  They were accidently
unset-uid when the Slackware distrib was done last time around.  This has
been confirmed by the Slackware compiler.

Once this is done, you should be all set.  You do this by executing:

chmod u+s passwd
chmod u+s chsh

Make sure you are in the directory where these binaries are, of course
(/usr/bin, I think).

Date: Fri, 7 Oct 1994 14:12:38 GMT

Hello I have a system partially going with UMSDOS on a dos partition.

I have one partition but the install software didn't succeed in making
a proper bootable partition.

I will describe the problem at the end of the message.

How does one setup a swap FILE under UMSDOS. I have tried setting the
file up when I install from setup. It works for the duration of the
installation but not after that.

/etc/fstab won't take something like /var/swapfile as a swap file as
it doesn't exist. (/var/swapfile I mean)

I tried doing a swapon /var/swapfile 6000 but this didn't work.
How am I goofing?

I understand that UMSDOS is alpha but the installation software
doesn't work very well when it comes to setting up the swap file and
to making the boot disk. I have tried twice to make one and each time
it has be unsuccessful. The second time nothing happened at all! It
reads the disk and that's it... Light goes out, no prompt, no text,
no nothing..
