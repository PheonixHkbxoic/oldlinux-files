Go with PCI for as many components as possible. PCI currently appears ot
be the new PC bus standard. It performs better than VLB, and is prefered
by manufacturers because it is easier to develop PCI cards than VLB ones.

: I've heard that PCI would be somewhat faster; how much? Also, I've heard
: that PCI isn't too stable yet, some cards won't work together; is this
: right?

PCI is faster, current 66 Mhz implementations are about 2x the speed of
VLB, and PCI 2.1 will be 3 times the speed, and double the width.
The PCI standard is pretty much stable, although the PCI and system 
BIOSes may not be. Card conflicts are not likely, but a conflict between
card and BIOS may be. Almost all work, though. 

: Does the kernel support VLB or PCI IDE host adapters? Are they much
: faster than ISA ones?

The kernel can't tell the difference, really, between ISA, VLB or PCI.
It currently supports the BusLogic BT946C SCSI host adaptor, and
AHA27xxx/28xx/29xx support is not far behind. As for video, XFree86 3.1
(to be released this week, I'm told) supports several PCI video cards.
I use the Diamond Stealth 64, which is based on the S3 Vision964 chip.

One gotcha with PCI, DON'T GET THE OPTi CHIPSET! There is a bug with it
(alas, I have the OPTi, and am trying to get it replaced.) such that
bus performance will not be optimal.

: A common PCI display adapter seems to be an 'AvanceLogic' (I don't know
: of a model) card. Does XFree86 2.1.1 support this? Which chipset does it

: 5434?)

I haven't heard of this. You'll probably be safest with anything based
on the S3 Vision964 chip. There's quite a list of these.

: Does the kernel support the NCR SCSI-2 controller that is integrated in
: some PCI motherboards? I found some NCR PCI drivers in drivers/scsi; do
: they work with the integrated chip (unfortunately I've forgotten the
: chip model number)?

There exists an NCR53c810 driver for Linux, but it is a kernel patch.
Although more expensive, I suggest the BusLogic card, it gives
slightly better transfer rates, and is supported in the 1.1.18 kernel.
(Make sure you recompile your kernel after install with ADAPTEC support
DISABLED. Otherwise, the Buslogic will emulate the Adaptec, with worse
performance than native mode.)

Subject: Hard Drive "sleep" program??
Date: 2 Oct 1994 20:53:08 GMT


        I have a linux box that can be idle up to 12 hours at a time.
        I figure since the hard drive is not doing much, is there
        a program that will shut off the hard drive until it is needed
        again?
        I realize if there is such a thing "bdflush" would demolish it's
        purpose.  If bdflush was changed to flush every hour or more, then
        maybe this could take wear off the hard drives?

        Answers/comments to both my concerns are more than welcome!

Subject: Routing table disappear :-((
Date: 2 Oct 1994 20:06:23 GMT

I have managed to run PPP on linux; there is a small problem however.
I use the ppp.go script to connect, I can only utalise the connection
after I manually run routed. And after 4-5 minutes, the routing table
is gone and I am left with lo0 as apposed to lo0 and ppp0.

The remedy that I reached (sucks) is to kill the routed daemon and
start it again. Now, doing this every 5 minutes is a lot of fun.

I wonder if anybody came such a thing ?? would love to hear from their
exp.

I have followed the README in /usr/lib/ppp in filling out /etc/gateways
and made it suitable to my hosts (work & home)

Any tips ??

Thanx

Well, definitely not "usually"... most modern modems don't have *ANY* dip
switches at all. "Usually" would be "ATS0=1&W". The *exception* are USR
and older Hayes modems that need to have a dip switch changed.

That was me.

Sure. Just imagine your slip server crashing, for whatever reason, leaving
DTR high. OK, someone elses machine calls in. Your modem auto answers, he
gets a CONNECT - and then? just a blank line, no welcome mesg... (remember,
the machine is crashed!). If the callers machine is dumb, it retries the
call... and retries... and retries... - imagine the callers phone bill.

In addition, if you don't have the modem auto-answer the phone, but have a
program answer incoming calls manually with ATA, you can do a lot other
nice tricks with the modem, for example, answer only if the callers number
(caller ID) matches a given list, log the CONNECT string, ...

>BTW, you could try reading the modem manual ! (grin ..)

That's always a good idea, agreed.

The default device to place entries from a tar file is the TAPE drive

Yes, I do.  The problem is not, and never was, that Slackware had a 
"botched up" hostname binary -- rather the bug was introduced by improper 
attempts to upgrade existing systems.  In an older version of Slackware (I 
think 1.2.0), hostname could function as either hostname or domainname 
depending on the name it was called by.  Therefore, domainname was simply 
a link to hostname.

Some people tried to install a later version of tcpip.tgz which contained 
seperate hostname and domainname binaries without removing the old 
package first (like the UPGRADE.TXT says to).  So, when domainname was 
untarred it followed the leftover link through and became the new 
'hostname'.  There's not much I can do about pilot error of this nature, 
unfortunately.

The new version of Slackware doesn't even have a domainname binary.  You 
change your domain name by editing /etc/hosts.  This is the method 
recommended by the util-linux-1.10 documentation.  (works great here :^)

Hope this clears up that "bug" ;^)

hostname has changed in net-tools-1.1.38. See 'man hostname' or
'hostname --help' for details on the new syntax.

How to fix the problem: Remove the above commands and put just
hostname reston.cber.nih.gov
there.

I have it set so that if you type startx, motif loads & opens a xterm
window.  I also have it set so that xdm does the same thing.  However,
when I log in through xdm and try to backspace in an xterm window
(either the first one or any I start) it acts like a 'cancel' button,
aborting the line and showing a fresh prompt.  This doesn't happen with
startx.  The files xinitrc & Xsession are basically identical (except
Xsession sources the ~/.profile file).  I don't know how to fix it,

Another problem:
I have an option on the motif root window that runs an instance of xterm
(looks like this):
        "New window"    f.exec "xterm -sb -rv -ls &"
This works as expected if I start X with startx.  If I log in with xdm,
the command works and I get a window, but it appears not to have source
the startup files (/etc/profile & ~/.profile) since the prompt is bash#
