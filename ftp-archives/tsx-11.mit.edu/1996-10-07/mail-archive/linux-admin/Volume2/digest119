I am going to set up a SLIP dial-in at my university account on a Sparc Station
which is running SunOS 4.1. The PC-Client I will be using to dial in from home
is my Linux box.

Since I already tried out DIP on my Linux PC (and consider it a convenient tool
to setup a SLIP-server via 'sliplogin') I would appreciate to use it on the Sun.

Anyone made something similar before? Can I use DIP on SunOS? If so where can I 
obtain the source code? How are the Sun SLIP-drivers integrated within the SunOS environment?

I am looking forward to reading from you,

Matthias

PS: Please reply in a short email to my account, my newreader does not work correct!

Hi All:

I am relatively new to Linux, but I am using it as a platform for MOTIF
development work.  I have noticed that I don't get messages like
"Segmentation Error" when my application dies, and that I don't seem to
be able to find a core dump.  Is there some magical incantation I must
use in order to get one?

Thanks in advance,
Maureen Lecuona

Sounds to me like you didn't set up your timezone stuff correctly.  I had the
same problem, but I didn't like the suggested solutions of changing my CMOS
clock twice a year or setting my CMOS clock to GMT, so instead I pointed my
local timezone to Eastern-Ind (that part of Indiana which doesn't use DST),
and made sure that each user uses EST5EDT.  Now the only users who are off 
are certain root processes.  But my users are right!  And I can still go back
and forth between DOS and Linux with the same CMOS clock and be consistent.

If you have LILO it's easy:
Edit /etc/lilo.conf. You'll find something like:

boot = /dev/hda1
compact
image = /vmlinuz
        label = Linux
        ramdisk = 0 
        root = /dev/hda1
        vga = normal
              ^^^^^^
              ||||||
If you change this in "vga = ask" LILO will ask which textmode you want.
After you changed it run LILO (just type lilo) and the next time you 
boot LILO will ask about the VGA mode. It will display all the available 
VGA modes for your card. Just type a number to get it. Remeber the 
number and edit /etc/lilo.conf again. For the VGA setting use the number 
you used at boot time (if 80x50 is mode 1, then use vga = 1). Again run 
lilo to register the changes. Of course you have to be root to do all 
this stuff.

If you don't have LILO it's a bit more difficult. Seems you have to use 
rdev... I don't have experience with it. Moral: man rdev :)

Um, not on my Uniboard system it doesn't. I have users with a one hour limit
do a batch download of files that has taken 4 hours to complete. They just
tag as many files as they can and go for it. It doesn't log them off until
they finish the whole lot.

Subject: NFS Mount Shows Wrong Mount!
Date: Tue, 27 Sep 1994 10:35:10

Have a problem where my NFS client, upon mounting a drive from the NFS server, 
ends up seeing the wrong drive!

NFS Server: running Linux 1.1.45, though same prob all the way back to Linux 
1.0 ...

exports file = 
#
/mnt/cd                         amy(ro) qserver(ro)
/                               amy(rw) qserver(ro)
/mnt                            amy(rw) qserver(rw)
/mnt/dosc                                       amy(rw) qserver(rw)
/mnt/dosd                       amy(rw) qserver(rw)
/mnt/dose                       amy(rw) qserver(rw)
/mnt/dosf                                       amy(rw) qserver(rw)
/mnt/dosg                       amy(rw) qserver(rw)
/mnt/dosh                       amy(rw) qserver(rw)
/mnt/dosi                                       amy(rw) qserver(rw)
/mnt/dosj                                       amy(rw) qserver(rw)
# End of exports.

NFS Client running Linux 1.1.45.

The client uses the following mount syntax:

mount -a -t nfs ian:/mnt/dosd /mnt/iandosd -0 rsize=8192,wsize=8192

When I do an LS of /mnt/iandosd, I end up seeing files that actually come from 
ian:/mnt/dosc, not ian:/mnt/dosd ... ?

Now, a few notes:

The server himself has to mount all the DOS drives to see them, his fstab 
looks like:

/dev/hdb6        /                     umsdos        defaults
/dev/hda1        /mnt/dosc        msdos        defaults
/dev/hdb1        /mnt/dosd        msdos        defaults
/dev/hda5        /mnt/dose        msdos        defaults
/dev/hda6        /mnt/dosf         msdos        defaults
/dev/hda7        /mnt/dosg        msdos        defaults
/dev/hda8        /mnt/dosh        msdos        defaults
/dev/hda9        /mnt/dosi         msdos        defaults
/dev/hda10      /mnt/dosj         msdos        defaults
/dev/sr0          /mnt/cd           iso9660        ro 
none               /proc                    proc        defaults

Could the problem be because the server mounts the drives?
I also allow a mount of the server's /, which in turn includes the /mnt 
directory where the server mounts all the DOS drives. A possible problem?

Any suggestions appreciated ...

        I just have plug a DEC VT320 terminal to the serial port of my
PC (Linux 1.1.50). In /etc/inittab, I uncomment the line :
s2:45:respawn:/sbin/agetty 19200 ttyS1
        When I reboot my PC, the prompt appear well on the terminal. I
enter the login name, and after the return, no answer (connection
blocked...).
        If, instead of the previous line, I put in /etc/inittab the
following line :
s2:45:respawn:/sbin/agetty 19200 cua1
        This time, all is correct and I am able to log in and so on.
        The problem is that I heard that /ddev/cua1 is less secure
than /dev/ttyS1. Anyone has a hint to make /dev/ttyS1 working as
/dev/cua1 does ?

Subject: Performance of gcc 2.5.8 against gcc 2.6.0 (X11 3d demo)
Date: 29 Sep 94 15:20:23 GMT

I have installed both versions of gcc and wanted to compare it's performance 
with a 3d-demo-program I just ported from turbo-pascal to c/C++. 

I compiled a version with each compiler and named the executables accordingly.
[4:44pm] michaelw@desaster:~/Work/3d/Sebastian> ls -l MF_Plato.gcc.2.*
-rwxr-xr-x   1 michaelw other       76157 Sep 29 16:33 MF_Plato.gcc.2.5.8*
-rwxr-xr-x   1 michaelw other       84352 Sep 29 16:34 MF_Plato.gcc.2.6.0*

I used "-O2 and -m486" for optimization

I did this twice, once as:
        MF_Plato.gcc.2.6.0 & MF_Plato.gcc.2.5.8 &
and another time as:
        MF_Plato.gcc.2.5.8 & MF_Plato.gcc.2.6.0 &

The window manager (fvwm) did autoplace them, and for some reason always
the 2.6.0 was the first one to be put on the screen - it must have been faster
at initializing.

After running these 4 copies of the same code for some time I noticed
they got out of sync, in the long term the gcc 2.6.0 compiled version 
was somewhat slower. (it took some minutes until one could notice).

The code is rotating and moving some mathematical objects 
(Tetraeder, Oktaeder, Ikosaeder, Dodekaeder) zooming to and fro, doing
a simple hidden-line algorithm on it etc. It was originaly written
by Sebastian Wedeniwski in Turbo-Pascal-for-DOS, I just ported it to C/C++
Unix/X-window. He agreed to put it under the GPL. It still has some typo
in the Ikosaeder- and Dodekaeder-definitions, so it looks a bit ugly because 
of some lines going astray, but you can fix it (and send it back to me) if 
you like - the rest (Tetraeder and Oktaeder) are perfect. 
I have to pass my math-exams before putting any more work into it :)

I will put the source on studserv.zdv.uni-tuebingen.de:/scratch/MF_Plato.tgz
for some time (binaries included).

Cheers, Michael Will

Ummm, I'm afraid xv may do its own scaling. You may want to try

"g3topbm | pnmtops"

(pnmtops being from the pbmplus distribution, forget about netpbm,
it's badly broken) - gives very good results here.

sendfax's? does sendfax produce G3 files? That's a new one for me...

Oh, you mean "input files for sendfax" -- depends, if you create them with
Ghostscript's dfaxhigh driver, it will prepend a 64-byte header that xli
doesn't understand. Strip it off ("tail +64c file1.g3 >file2.g3") and it
should work.

For received files, you may run into problems if you have transmission
errors on the page and xli decides that it cannot properly decode the page
-> it must be some non-g3 format... - use g3topbm ; xli in that case.

Yup. In the Slackware 2.0 configuration, <Ctrl>-R at the xdm login prompt will
kill xdm and bring you back to tty mode. With some Xservers, though, you will
not see the tty, but a white screen with uni-colored vertical broken stripes.
This is a result of X eating display fonts or something like that. On my
machine, the 8514 server did this, while the Mach 32 server didn't. Then,
again a setup of Slackware, hit Ctrl-Alt-Del, or switch to a console with a
tty and use the 'halt' or 'reboot' commands.


If enough people not running Slackware 2 are interested in the config file
Slackware uses to do this (something in /usr/lib/X11/xdm, I think it's
Xresources) I'll post it.

Give it some names in /etc/printcap like

Set the printer via menu to postscript instead of PCL or Autodetect.

Tell dvips about the 600 dpi if you use it

get and install iso2ps, a2ps -8 or enscript
all three are for nice formating of ISO-Textfiles in Postscript
