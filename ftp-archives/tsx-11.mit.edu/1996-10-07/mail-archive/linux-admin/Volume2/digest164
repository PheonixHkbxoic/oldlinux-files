You need to take your kernel to about 1.1.49 and apply the ipfirewall patch
then take a look at:

Hi, Hackers,

  I recently had a problem running dip, whenever I run
  it for the first time AFTER A COLD REBOOT, I get errors
  "getc: I/O error". However after the first time, I can run it
  without any problem, even if I warm reboot the system(say run
  dos for a while).

  This puzzles me, hope some of you knows the answer and kindly

Subject: Q: Max # of ftp/gopher/http users on a Linux PC?
Date: 6 Oct 1994 15:09:04 -0700


All,

Our company is considering making a Linux equipped PC an ftp/gopher/http
server, but I don't know if such machines are able to handle the load. We
will ultimately be giving the machine its own router and 56k line, but we
have no idea what CPU's are appropriate -- 486 DX2/66, P60, P66, P90,
etc. The PC would have 16 Meg ram and at least a gig SCSI drive.

What I'm really looking for is something like: "a 486-66 starts to bog
down at 100 ftp logins transferring data out, but a p60 could take at
least 400 without breaking into a sweat".

We aren't sure what the average size of concurrent ftp/http accesses will
be, but we would like to be more than 200. If a Linux PC is simply
incapible of doing this, we would probably get a used Sun.

Feel free to email or post your answers. I could really use your help. Thanx

Virtually,
warr

Now I need some advice. Which kinds/brands are there? Is there a FAQ for this?
It should support SLIP/PPP, and shouldn't be too expensive of course.

Thanks for any info,

The original SCSI standard.

>SCSI-2

SCSI-2 introduces a number of interesting new features, such as 
tagged queing which allows you to send multiple commands to a device 
and let it order them optimally and pipeline processing and execution,
standard audio commands for CD ROMs, etc.

However, nearly everything new in SCSI-II (and SCSI-III for that
matter) are options and not mandatory, and SCSI is backwards compatable.  
So, if you didn't do anything silly (ie, choose the SCSI-I single 
initiator option), your marketing department can promote your 
SCSI-I host adapter to SCSI-II or even SCSI-III if they want.

>fast SCSI-2

Standard SCSI allows for 5Mhz synchronous transfers, the fast option
allows for transfers between 5 and 10Mhz. 

>wide SCSI

Standard SCSI is eight bits wide, where as WIDE scsi is sixteen
bits wide, allowing for fifteen devices instead of seven, and 
double the transfer rates.

There are some provisions for 32 bit WIDE SCSI, but I haven't 
seen any devices.

>and AV-SCSI

Drives made for AV applications won't drop out for thermal 
recalibration (ie, they'll either not do it ever, or will abort 
if a command comes in) so you have the necessary guaranteed 
maximum response time.

>Which is best?  

Fast+Wide SCSI-III, differential and not single ended.

Of course, you will pay hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars 
in the premiums for wide and differential devices...

>Which is worst?  How do you tell which one you have?

If you're talking about SCSI targets, you ask them with a SCSI
INQUIRY command.  They'll tell you what revision of the specification
they conform with, what options they support, who made them, and 
all sorts of other good stuff.

The Linux kernel does this at bootup, so it will be in your 
kernel messages.  

Or you can run the scsiinfo program.

>Are any of them compatible with the others?  

With the exception of single ended/differential, unless you've done
something really stupid when you wrote the firmware, they're all compatable.

>Why is this not addressed
>in the SCSI-Howto?

Because it isn't yet.

There will be something in the next revision which will detail the 
differences between the various revisions of the specification, 
the options allowed in each one, and the practical ramifications 
thereof.

Jeff,

as it turned out, the Summer '94 Yggdrasil has a Rev. B boot diskette
(available via ftp) which supports the NCR 53C810 SCSI chip. So you can
install Linux this way. But since the 1.0.19 kernel is not on the CD-ROM,
it does not get copied to the SCSI disk - and you get an unbootable
system. 

This is probably good enough if you have an IDE disk plus a SCSI disk
hanging off the NCR chip. Then you can install from CD-ROM with the Rev.B
boot disk and replace the kernel by the one from the boot disk. But it
doesn't work too well if the SCSI disk is all you have.

I installed the Slackware distribution in the meantime and everything
works fine (after I figured out how to install the undocumented "NCR"
disk set...).

Please e-mail me if you figure out how to get linux
running on a Compaq server (in my case I have a proliant 
1000 with a pentium processor).

Since SCO/Unix and Novell/Netware run on this
machine, I assume linux could run on this machine. 
I guess linux is not considered strategic to Compaq.

Anyway, I do not have the time to play infinite
loops with Compaq or to write the drivers myself.

Oh well...

For now, I assume linux will not run on my Compaq
until I buy different hardware.


NOTE: I have cross posted the same question to a couple

Hi everyone,

many thanks for all of you who replied by eMail or in this group. Meanwhile,
after some more excessive testing, I'm up and running with the two above!!!

The clue was the "dial"-command. Richard J Wyble <rwyble@iii.net> wrote to
me, that

I did the last one changing the dial-command into
send ATDT1613075\r

and it connected!

Another error was waiting for the wrong prompt afterwards. I recovered this one
by using the "debug" mode. It can be involved through

echo on

in the script file. After this, all output from the modem is echoed.

Once again, many thanks,

Cheers, Dirk

CD recorders require a steady stream of data going from the hard disk
image to the CD recorder.  To guarantee this, you do not want background
tasks to spontaneously start up and disrupt this continuous stream.
I suppose if a driver and software were available, you could get it
to work if you kill crond prior to writing.

Righto Kevin,

        Except "g" is the 64byte packets and "G" allows larger. 
        From the "info" entries supplied with Taylor UUCP:

The UUCP `G' Protocol
=====================
   The `G' protocol is apparently simply the `g' protocol, except that
it is known to support all possible window and packet sizes.  It was
introduced by SVR4 UUCP; the SVR4 implementation of the `g' protocol is
apparently fixed at a packet size of 64 and a window size of 7.  Taylor
UUCP does not recognize the `G' protocol.  It does support all window
and packet sizes for the `g' protocol.

        Also, if your Taylor uucp discovers that it's talking to another
        Taylor uucp, you can achieve much better throughput because,
        according to the file /usr/lib/uucp/README :

If you are talking to another instance of the package, you can use
the new bidirectional protocol for rapid data transfer in both
directions at once.  You can also restrict file transfers by size
based on the time of day and who placed the call.

                                and:

IMPORTANT: the default when talking to another version of 1.04 is to
use the new bidirectional 'i' protocol.  If you are using a
half-duplex modem, such as a Telebit T2500, you will want to either
mark the port as half-duplex with the ``half-duplex'' command, or
force use of the 'g' protocol by using the ``protocol'' command in the
sys or port file or by adding ``,g'' after the port name in the
Systems or L.sys or Devices file.

        Sadly, most instances of uucp out there are never set up to try
        any of the higher-density protocols and thus use the "g" 
        protocol as a default.  When you connect to them, the highest
        protocol supported by both systems is the one that wins the
        negotiation and you are usually stuck with "g" unless you are
        lucky enough to hit another Taylor.  :(

Well, I tried it and... It works fine.
Make sure you have only the newly compiled libXpm-3.4c on your disk,
to avoid confusing ld and ldconfig...

I have now fvwm, with XPM stuff freshly recompiled under XFree 3.1
with the new libs and it works with no problems.

(But on a test directory, since I won't recompile all my clients and
 probably keep 2.1.1 for a while...)
