Reply-To: arnholt@mayo.edu

I'd appreciate any advice on the following: when setting
up my HP 4P laserjet on Linux (using LPT1), I'm able
to print to the queue (IE, lpq shows that the file is
waiting to print), but the printer never receives the
file.  lpc gives some message like "lp unable to print--
offline," but the printer behaves normally under DOS/WfW3.11.

Any general suggests as to what to try next?  I've
exhausted the possibilities in the HOWTO.  I'm fairly sure
that an expert could troubleshoot this in minutes.

Many thanks.

If Linux is the only system that touches this drive, you should be ok.
The problem is that older versions of fdisk (up to 1.5b) will create
a partition beginning in the first cylinder incorrectly.  It should
begin at a track boundary, but fdisk puts it immediately after the
Master Boot Record.  Linux will work properly this way, but some other
systems have been known to "repair" this.  Lilo may be unwilling to
boot from this partition, however.

As far as linux is concerned, only the logical value matters.  Lilo is
concerned with both, as it has to live with the BIOS.  Both physical
(cylinder/head/sector) and logical (sector counting from zero at the
MBR) are in the Partition Table (in the Master Boot Record).  Fdisk is
simply reporting that the two don't match.  Whatever kind of fdisk you
used to make that partition simply set the cylinder to the highest
possible value.

Note that if some of the Lilo files are in the hd1a4 partition, they
might be above cylinder 1023, which Lilo can't handle.  These would
include the kernel image, the map file, boot.b, and the message file -
if you have one.`

Ugh!  This will cause trouble.

The correct solution for linux 1.1.x is to simply define the drive
as having 32 (or 64) heads in the BIOS CMOS setup.  Then DOS, linux, 
and most other stuff will handle it just fine.

Our RMON monitor Beholder and the accompanying SNMP utils (get, set, next

the experience of anyone who is running linux in a networked environment 
with all or one of the following demons/servers.

1) Named
2) bootp
3) NSF
4) gopher server and
5) Mosaic server


  the configuration of the system will be a 486DX/50 MHz processor with local
bus arch. It will have 16Mb of RAM with 210 MB of Harddisk (IDE). Also I want 
to mount 1 GB hard disk from a IBM RS6000 running AIX running 3.0.
The ethernet card will be eitherNE2000 or from HP .

    In particular I will like to know response time , reliability etc. Please
let me know if the above configuration is ok or not.

Please reply to manish@uh.edu.

It's just a 486DX2-66 with a 487 pinout that fits in a 487 socket.  It
switches off the DX-33, so if you keep it in the system it is only
going to sit there like a heating pad.

It was part of an Intel scheme to sell these "upgrade" parts without
causing a messy aftermarket of used DX-33 chips, which might affect
profit margins.  Fortunately, both consumers and MB manufacturers
rejected this as an expensive ploy and waste of MB space.  However, if
you buy an "Overdrive" chip from Intel, make sure to get the one with
the right pinout (486 or 487).  Of course, the 487 itself is just a DX
chip with different pinout.

Conclusion: Intel marketing sucks.

When the answer is as easy as this one I certainly think you should post the

I can't change it.  I have other hardware that is using that port

the MIDI card to some other address and then move the 1542CF to
330 I'll have MIDI software sending strange stuff to my SCSI adapter.
Some of the MIDI software can be configured, but much of it just
assumes 330, the factory default for MIDI cards.

The SCSI controller supports 130, 134, 230, 234, 330, and 334.  I
have the Adaptec SCSI bios at the factory default address, but I
did move the port base to 230.  In DOS/Windows this all works fine.

I'd try hacking on the driver, but I have to get the system loaded
before I can do that.  I can't load the system because all my
disks, CDROM, and tape drive all run off the SCSI controller.

I'm Stuck!

   Exactly what I just did.  I'm tired of hearing and seeing Smail bugs and
   at the moment I can't deal with these security problems anymore.  I
   installed sendmail last night and I'm getting others to install it too
   until Smail can get fixed.  

There's a good one!  A sendmail bug was just reported a few months
ago, adding yet another to the DOZENS of bugs reported about sendmail.
Most of the bugs reported in sendmail give *outside* users access to
your machine; this smail bug was only available to users who have
already logged in.  Big difference.  Sendmail (The standard one,
anyway, 8.6.9) arguably the single hardest unix package to configure
correctly.  Smail is a damn good program, and I use it all the time.
I am going to check out Zmailer 2.97, but in the meantime, for ease
and understandability, and for security reasons, I'm going to stick to
smail rather than risk using sendmail.

Subject: Which controls initial PATH environment?
Date: 12 Oct 1994 15:51:11 -0400


Hi,

I have linux running slackware 1.2. In my /etc/profile, I notice there is a line

PATH=$PATH:/usr/games....

And when I login as user, "echo $PATH", I get:

/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/games.....

but as root, I get:

/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:usr/sbin:/usr/games....

So which program controls the initial $PATH?

Thanks.

JL
