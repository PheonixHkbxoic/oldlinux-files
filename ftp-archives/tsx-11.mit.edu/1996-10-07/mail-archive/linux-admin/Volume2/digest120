        What about `cp -arp * /splat`?  Much simpler then tar.

Subject: Re: FIPS or UMSDOS - WHICH ONE???
Date: Thu, 29 Sep 1994 13:02:45 GMT

In articles was written that FIPS is easy to use. That's true. But I had a small
problem with FIPS, maybe that can be changed easily (?) I didn't bother to find out 
(up to now).

This is it:I repartitioned my 340 MB drive. Making it 145. This however was not that 
clever since I only had  COMMAND.COM and systemfiles on it. The decreasing of the
partitionsize did NOT change the sectorsize (seems rahter inevitable) and therefore
my sectorsize is 8K. This means that a file of 1 byte needs 8K harddisk-space.

MS-DOS needs this large sectors enabling to access larger-MB-drives with the same clusters.
So when decreasing below 128 MB or 256 MB (I think these are the limits) the sectorsize
stays bigger than necessary causing the space-loss mentioned.

My advice is: When harddisc is almost empty use FDISK when filled use FIPS first. Copy data to
new partition use FDISK remove partition and recreate then you'll have correct sectorsize, copy 
data back from new-partition. The copying between partitions is at least faster than backup on 
diskettes. Or use FIPS and don't cross the boundary's. 

Good Luck, 


Michael,

PS: If you have a better idea please tell me. (I'm still stuck with the 8K-sizes since my disk
is already filled in both partitions..)

Date: 27 Sep 1994 18:34:30 -0400

I have been battling with the GNU Finger v1.1.37 for about 2 months now --
on and off to no avail.  I've reconfigured my settings, recompiled, checked
the system and all sorts of other little details that I care not to dwell
on at this point.

I have applied the Debian patch to no avail, and I'm just plain baffled.

Here's what I'm getting when I try to do a general finger on the machine:

[skEErEd.infi.net]
No one logged in on client machines.


I have checked my clients files, reconfigured using hostnames only,
hostnames and domain names, IP addresses, port #'s; you name it.

Here's what I get when I finger a user:

System Administrator (root)
Home: /root
Shell: /bin/tcsh
Mail forwarded to root.
Last login on tty3 on Tue Sep 27 18:09:06 1994

System Administrator has never logged on.
Plan:

As you can see, it says my last login above and from where, then it
comes down and says that I have never logged on.  I find this to be
bizarre.  I seem to think that this could be part of the problem.

Anyone w/ experience and/or any ideas: I would be GREATLY appreciative
if you would reply to this message and/or the below email address!

Subject: Rlogin security and .rhosts
Date: 26 Sep 1994 23:54:59 GMT

A user can make a /bin/.rlogin file with the following line:

localhost username

Then the user "username" can do rlogin -l bin localhost.

This, I was told, gives the user root access through the at command, as 
/var/spool/at* is owned by bin

I'm sort of new to unix administration, so I'd like some comments on this -
is this a big security hole? How powerful bin is? What can be done to fix
this? 

I'd appreciate e-mail, as I am going away for a week and may not be able to 
catch this thread when I get back...

I've installed the Yggdrasil Linux Fall 94 software.  And I think either
this was working and I screwed up something or it never did work.
I can rlogin to my Sun workstation if I am logged in as root on my PC
but if I log in as any other user I get the following message.

rcmd: socket: Permission denied    

I have a .rhost file in both my root home dir and my user dir but in the
root dir I didn't modify it in any way and so my sun workstation is not
mentioned in it which leads me to beleive that its not being used.  In
the user dir I tried adding the names of other sites that I wanted to 
log into but it still didn't change any thing.  It seems like my root
has permission to some file some where and the world or groups don't and
need to.

Depends on how your version of minicom was compiled... Try (as root,

Subject: Safer method of anon ftp with group access
Date: 27 Sep 1994 00:19:58 GMT

I would like to setup an anon ftp site with group access
priveleges. 

In linux, one way of doing this is by using the 'private'
entry and the groupaccess file.
The groupaccess file has the entry format:

name:encrypted_pass:real_name

The disadvantage is that this file is kept open during the operation of
the ftp server.

The other way is to use the 'guestgroup' entry and putting the 
entry in the passwd file. and group file.

A third way is to use the ACCT option in the ftp deamon.
I have not quite figured out how to set this up.

Which one is safer ?
Are there any special precautions that must be take ?
Where can I read more about this ? (at RTFM.MIT.EDU ?)
Any other advantages of one over the other ?

I think you mean 80x50 instead of 50x80. 50x80 isn't a very funny 
mode to use... But apart from that, sounds interresting.

Subject: XView/Openwin rather old...
Date: Thu, 29 Sep 1994 15:46:20 GMT

Hi,
I have to setup a linux machine here for one of the professors
to work at home with - he would really like to have the open-
windows/xview as user interface, just as he is so used to it.

I took my self-grown linux installation and wanted to add one of
the openwin/xview packages from SLS or LST, but I found that all
they had to offer was the old package dating from Oct. '93, with
all the ugly sideeffects (need symlinks from /lib for the shared
libs or LD_LIBRARY_PATH, spurious complains about "(tty) is not
a typewriter", cmdtool not working well).

So I am wondering if there is any newer port of xview to linux?
Are the patched sources available, even to generate new shared
lib images?

Otherwise I will just fall back to plain X11 and trim fvwm and
xterm/rxvt so that it will yield a xview-look-a-like... 

Thanks for any pointers in advance,
Christian
