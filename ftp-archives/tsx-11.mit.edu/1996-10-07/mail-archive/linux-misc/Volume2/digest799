Actually, this is wrong!  You can have the root partition as a logical.  I have 
IBM BootMangler (actually, I like it :), a DOS primary and an OS/2 primary.  
AS you can only have 3 primaries and an extended, I have a 420MB extended
split into 3 logical partitions for linux.  One of which is root.

This works for me any time I need to reboot :)

This is good if you can do it.  For this reason, I have a swap partition on my
130MB IDE which is otherwise just used for Windoze junk that my girlfriend needs
for DTP.  For a swap partition this is really good as the heads are always in 
the right place, so seeks are very quick.

If the problem occurs whenever elvis (vi) is running, the problem is
the xterm support of elvis, changing the usual copy/paste mouse buttons
to the ctrl mouse button. This is misdesign in elvis, not in xterm,
as ctrl mouse button has a different meaning in a xterm already.

Hi Heiko,

   Thanks, I was installing from diskettes and getting tar errors on most
of the files being installed (unexpected EOF).  I copied the same A1, A2,

Subject: Impossible... talk working locally AND over the Internet?
Date: Wed, 21 Sep 1994 19:19:55 +0000

Hi all,

   A while back, when I installed my Slackware Linux, I found that
talk wouldn't work when I wasn't connected to the Internet with my
SLIP connection.  I edited /etc/hosts and added 'tsunami' (my compy's
name ;-) as an alias for 'localhost'.  Talk worked locally and I was
happy.

   Then I came to try and use talk over the Internet.  I tried and
tried, but never got further than "[Checking for invitation...]"... I
removed the 'tsunami' alias, and, lo and behold, it worked fine.  Now
talk is broken when I'm off the Internet ;-)

   Can I make talk work both ways round?


   peace,  Ben

Subject: Help: Enhanced IDE supported ??
Date: 22 Sep 1994 13:04:42 +0200

Hello,

as I want to buy a new PC, I need to know if the new Enhanced IDE
features are supported by Linux.
As far as I have understood there will be no problem if the IO to
and from the disk is done via the BIOS (Correct me if I am wrong).
But most operating systems are bypassing the BIOS by manipulating
the registers of the controller directly.

So my question(s) is (are): 

Does Linux use the BIOS for the IO to IDE drives so that there 
won`t be any problems with E-IDE or do I need a seperate E-IDE driver ?? 
If so, is any work out there done in supporting Enhanced IDE ??

Thank you VERY much,

        Thilo

The DSP architecture and instruction set is just one side of the problem. In
addition we need to know how to download the DSP code to the ASP chip, how
the driver should communicate with the algorithm running on the ASP and how
the ASP chip is interfaced with the audio data path. It should be possible to
get this info by disassembling both the DOS driver (CSP.SYS?) and the ASP
code. However why should we do that? There are other soundcards with DSP chips
which are much powerful, cheaper and better documented than SB16ASP.
