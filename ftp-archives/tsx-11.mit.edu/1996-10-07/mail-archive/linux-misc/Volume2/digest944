I know... but it worried me, though, that if Linux crashed I would
have to go through a couple of steps before running DOS/Windows
instead.

In connection with all this - I've booted Linux off a few times since
setting up as described in my previous message, and I have found a
small problem. In particular, I do this to set up my Windows swap file
as a Linux partition:

  Moises> - In /etc/rc.multi (or wherever your setup activates swap)
  Moises> add these lines:
  Moises>       # add Windows swap file as Linux swap
  Moises>       mkswap /dev/swapfile 9796
  Moises>       swapon /dev/swapfile

I have noticed that a couple of times it's told me that it is setting
up a swap file that is ~10MB (output from mkswap) then it's told me
that it is activating ~17M (output from swapon) - yet my only swap is
that lone swapfile that is only 10MB.  My total memory, swap plus
real, is ~17MB - but real mem should not be counted in that output
from swapon, should it?

The other times I've booted up Linux, it says (correctly, I think)
that it is activating ~10MB of swap.  

Anyone have any thoughts about what might be going wrong?  Thanks!

This would explain a lot!
The problem is unlikely to happen with other connection types.
Most people that could track this problem down have correctly configured
connections and never see the problem.

Tar Question:

My version of tar gives me the following error when I try to extract from the
following file:

        tar -x Cmix.manual.tar
        tar: can't open /dev/nftape : I/O error

Granted, I did download the file with a DOS comm program and then copy it over
to a Linx directory (having my DOS partition mounted to /dosc).  Would that
make a difference?  Or is there something esle at work here.  

Seyon Question:

So in order to rectify the above situaion, possibly, I tried to download the
file again with seyon.  Whenever I try to:

        sz Cmix.manual.tar

I get a bunch of timeout errors.  Even if I try to time things exactly (i.e., 
type the above command, then do a RECEIVE - Reg. Zmodem, then watch errors).  
In general, I've been having bad luck getting seyon to upload and download
files.

Any help to either of the above would be greatly appreciated.

Be careful calling Linux SYSV based.  Linux is not based on the SYSV
source tree -- if it were, you would be paying a lot of money.  I think
Linux tries, rather, to take nice features from both BSD and SYSV, and
provide a fairly POSIX-complient implementation (for what POSIX is
worth).

I would rather say that Linux is "Linux-based" rather than "SYSV-based"
:-)

In my opinion, this seems like the way to go.  It would provide
compatibility with current documents and allow those who prefer 
to have a WYSIWIG mode.  There could be pull down menus and all 
of the rest of the word processor type conveniences.  Codes could
be invisibly inserted by the program.  If I understand

Well, Sun has the openwindows Properties tool, and hp vue has the Style
manager. And yes, they are limiting. But on the other hand, they have
the desired result: they give some amount of customization ability
with little knowledge needed, and little opportunity to screw up, and
with VUE, some *very* nice color schemes, which are hard to come up with
for those of us who are not graphic designers, and they are obeyed by most
software (including some you might not want to obey your color schemes).

Anyway I like the idea of a HOWTO, but even better, I like the idea of a
whole package, containing documentation, sample configuration files of
various 'schemes' of things (.fvwmrc's, app-defaults files, whatever),
and a tool to manipulate (choose/install) them.

This package could be used by anyone, not made the default in any
distribution, but available for the target audience to use, and
shouldn't prevent anyone from using newly-gained knowledge to manually
tweak the results. In fact I am frankly surprised that no distribution
has one yet, after seeing slackware's current color install program.

Yes, this is tough. I have seen a few available programs come with
really nice defaults files giving nice color combinations: frisk
(risk clone), xpat2-1.00, xv, xpaint (actually I don't know where
this resource file came from but I like it), and Andrew stuff. tcl/tk
applications are generally a consistent beige color, although I don't
really like the default look of tknews. Then there is xmailtool, which
is, well, green. I don't mind it but I know plenty of people who do. And
lots of applications are just vanilla -- mumail, emacs, the old version
of xsokoban, xcalc(ulator), to name a few I have encountered.

Someone (I think it was in a Sunergy email newsletter) once posted
a list of foreground/background combinations he liked for terminal
windows. I adopted only one: DarkSlateBlue background, LemonChiffon1
foreground. I am not a big fan of black-on-white or white-on-black, but
that is my default xterm window, and I use a few other color schemes for
specific windows to identify them: black background with amber, green,
turquoise, or royal blue; pastel-colored backgrounds (green, pink, blue,
ivory) with black text, and some gray backgrounds with hot pink or primary
colors for the foreground. It was tough, but I got my olvwm colors to match
twm's (maroonish borders with silver-gray text).

Just keep me away from cheesy white-on-"dos-blue" (default dos editor colors)!

I installed Linux from the Yggdrasil Fall 94 CD on a Packard-Bell
486SX33, with 8MB.  When prompted for a swap partition, I declined to
specify one, since I planned to set one up later, "on top of" my
windows swap file.  I attempted to install some of the software from
the CD-ROM to the disk, before setting up that swap partition - only
to have the install process (a) run incredibly slowly, and (b) fail.
Reason was that Linux was running out of memory...

It might be nice to add a note to the doc that mentions that >8MB VM
are needed during the install process - I am pretty sure it is not...

Hi,
 
 
I have an Adaptec 1542C-SCSI-II adapter for a SCSI-II HD,
this works fine with OS/2 and DOS and stuff.
It just doesn't with linux.
 
I read the SCSI-HOWTO about the problems. It seems my adapter is very
sensitive to cabling problems.
 
I think this is very very weird, because my computer is a finitestate machine.
But apart from that, the SCSI-HOWTO describes a method to MINIMIZE the
problems of random errors,
Is there anyway in which I can SOLVE the problem ?

Hello,

    I have one 120mb IDE drive in notebook, and a 1.08gb
external SCSI2 drive. Now I'm going to repartition/reformat 
both drives in order to install OS/2 and Linux OSs. I wish to 
place all OSs in drive C: 120mb drive and all data/applications 
in 1.08gb drive. So I will repartition C: into four primary
partitions, ie, BootManager, DOS, OS/2, and Linux.

    My question is 'how many disk spaces do I need to reserve
for Linux in drive C in order to boot Linux by using OS/2's 
boot manager?' 
(I don't want to make a bootable floppy disk.)  
(I want to use X-WIN or OpenWin.)
(I use Linux 1994 cd-rom release 4.)

But it is not posted to this group, which is probably the most logical

A _LOT_ of people who get Slackware complain about not getting 
the getty_ps package to work correctly. I fought it round and round,
until I got the source code, and found these things...

First of all, debug mode can be enabled with -D 777 on the command line.
This is _NOT_ documented in the man page, and it should be!

If uugetty isn't reading the right file, it won't see DEBUG=777 in it's
defaults file. therefore you have nothing to assist you in debugging.
You need -D777 to find this out (see above!)

ALL the documentation (getty man page, the howtos, etc) that come with
Slackware tell you that the configuration files go in /etc/default.
That is true, _IF_ compiled that way. It's _NOT_. It is compiled to look
in /etc/conf.(device)

I recompiled the code with no change. When I looked in tune.h, I found
a line about the FSSTND - Filesystem Standard. When I removed the
 "ifndef FSSTND" and it's results, it properly compiles for using
/etc/default.

A - Distribute Slackware with proper documentation
        and/or
B - Change tune.h, or change the documentation!

to get scaled up to the requested size, resulting in horrible-quality
type.  "Small" fonts look fine.  Could someone post either a pointer
