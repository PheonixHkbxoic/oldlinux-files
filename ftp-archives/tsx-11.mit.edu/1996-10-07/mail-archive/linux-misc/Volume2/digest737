You poor AWE32 owners!

It's not possible to write a driver which supports full features of the
AWE32. Creative Technology has not released information about the Emu
chip and I bet they will never do that. The same is true with the ASP
also.

The AWE32 works as a SB16 with Linux. However it's much cheaper to buy
a plain SB16 than an AWE32 or SB16ASP.

That's because login doesn't interpret a shell with parameters in the passwd 
file correctly. Create, instead, a soft link: diplogin -> dip and usr 
/usr/bin/diplogin as the shell; if dip is invoked with the name 'diplogin', 
that implies the -i.

   Get shorter speaker cables.

No!  Get thicker cables.  The problem is that the electrons (which are
really just like tiny elephants) can't travel as quickly in a narrow
cable.  They bump around too much if the wire isn't big enough.  If
you get thicker wires, then they can shoot straight down the middle
without bumping into the walls.

Electronics is really very simple if you understand the physics of it all.

Yeah, actually, what a trip.  Both are impressive as hell!  It's a miracle

Hi all,

I want to set the delay time between each dial to 2 seconds instead
of the default 10 sec but with no success.

Looking at the manpages of seyon ,  there is a toolkit option called
dialDelay.  When I try to use this option by typing

seyon -dialDelay 2

An error message saying that invalid option.

How do I use the toolkit option?  

Thanks for any help.

Subject: Doom with a 8bit sound card and sox
Date: 11 Sep 1994 04:07:26 GMT

I am trying to get Doom to work on my soundblaster 1.5 card and
keep the game playable.  I made /dev/dsp into a FIFO used sox to
do the conversion.  The game really slows down when using sox.  I
also need to know the play rate for the sounds.  Here is the command.

sox -t raw -w -s -r 42000 /dev/dsp -t .au -A /dev/audio

Would this conversion need a great amount of cpu time or could 
optimization fix it?  My 486DX33 really can't handle much more than
doom.

Depending on the card you have (ie: SB) you may use /dev/dsp with VOC
files.

You can convert them using the EXCELLENT Sox packages:

       Creator & Maintainer:
                Lance Norskog           thinman@netcom.com

(maybe found under Lsox) It convert from/to almost any kind of format.

Harddisk-speed isn't that important in Linux. CPU-speed is definitely
more valuable. If you could get more RAM it would be more difficult
to decide. With 16 Megs you have almost no swapping to HDD.

It works just fine. You don't need to hack it up much at all; just
give it the compile flags for compiling on a 386. The major problems
are built in to nachos and will bite you just as badly on any
platform.

Oh, yes, they can. If you get a boot sector virus onto your hard
drive, it will quite happily garbage up your Linux (or other Unix)
partitions when it goes off. The things use BIOS disk I/O before the
OS loads, which will run perfectly well...
