  I do not know under which conditions WordPerfect is sold, but normally
why you buy a software product, you effectively buy only a license-to-use.
*If* you get media and/or documentation, then you only get those to be
able to exercise your right to use to product. You "own" the media and
documentation, but you are not allowed to copy them (except copying the
media for backup purposes). If you return the product (for a refund),
then you also return the license-to-use, so you are no longer allowed to
use it. Given this, it really does not matter whether or not the copy
you made is legal, you are not allowed to use it any longer.

Here's an interesting, if vague, data point.  I have a 486DX2/66
and a P90 networked together.  The P90 took the same time to compile
emacs (8.5 minutes elapsed) as the 66, with the 66 using a local
SCSI disk and the P90 using the same disk via NFS.

Most bang for the buck:  Get a 486dx2-66, and make sure it's an AMD
cpu, not Intel.  Then, get a motherboard that you can easily change the
bus speed settings, via jumpers.  A friend of mine bought the above 
combination for $290 (MB + CPU) at a computer show, and the AMD chip
happily cruises along at an overclocked 80mhz.  He ran Doom running
demo mode for 4 days straight without a crash.  His Norton SI is 
152, compared with ~124 at 66mhz, annd 190 for a P5-60.  However, I 
heard a rumor that AMD is catching on and now calling their chips 
DX2-80's, so you might want to buy soon while they're cheap.

Calling uuname is not a bug, you just have a uucp router in your routers 
file. Or is it that smail allways uses that router even if you comment it out
in the routers ? I don't remeber.

The easiest way out is to install uucp, then smail will call uuname to
find out that the mail is not going to one of your uucp_neighbours and 
will try the next router. 

Even a better solution is to disable all routers and use a smart_host instead.
In that way you avoid the problems with smail not looking up MX records.

Hi,
        I recently heard about Linux and am very interested. I have
just bought a new 540M IDE harddrive. On reading the slakware_faq I
found that Linux has problems with 540M IDE harddrive (cyliders =16
instead of 32). Is this true for the latest (stable) version of Linux?

If not, what is that version?

Thanks for any help/info.

I installed a new kernel on an existing slackware bootfloppy.

In the AT&T vs BSDI/UCB case, the judge found that use of identical
structures was not a copyright violation because it was basically
a compatibility requirement.  Since this was only preliminary it's not an
official precedent.  Anyway, for FSF to assert control over data
structures even in GPLed code would be to assert an interface copyright.

In a way, this is unfortunate.  A lot of the uncertainty over the LGPL
is because people say "well, it looks like a dynamic link would satisfy
the requirements, but it doesn't say so specifically so I'm not sure".

For some strange reason 9 tracks aren't mentioned in the Howtos :')

Two of the best places to look are via anonymous ftp at:

sunsite.unc.edu /pub/Linux
tsx-11.mit.edu /pub/Linux

Look for the Linux HOW-TO's. In particular, you need the Linux 
Installation and Getting Started Guide by Matt Welsh. This is where to 
start and it is on the archive sites listed above.

Hope this helps and good luck.

************************************************************************
=================== Gory Gory Details Follow ==============
************************************************************************

I have been given a 3bit subnet (6hosts+netaddr+broadcast) from
my internet provider.  I use my linux box to establish a slip
connection and want it to provide to routing for my subnet.
the subnet is very small right now - just my linuxpc and a sun3
as an xterm to the pc (running linux-Xkernel!).

here is a little experiment I have tried:
========================================================================
ping my sun3 xterminal from a host on the slip-server side...  to
check that the forwarding and routes were correct.... this is 
so I can throw up X stuff on my sun3 from other places on the net.

host definitions:
        picard          host on net of slip-server
        distraction     my linux pc
        weenie          my sun3 as an xterminal

ip addrs:
        134.207.6.40    my subnet (using last 3 bits)
        124.207.6.47    broadcast for this subnet
        255.255.255.248 netmask for this subnet
        134.207.6.41    distraction
        134.207.6.42    weenie

facts:
        ping from picard to distraction is successful
        ping from picard to weenie fails, but packets are delivered
                to distraction's eth0

The Sinclair QL (a home computer based upon the 68008 processor, which

an operating system called QDOS.

Maybe, these 4 characters are a magic acronym?

I don't think that would be solved by a biz.comp.linux hierarchy. This is
a col.help question. How to split col.help is an open issue certainly
but I don't think it will be split across the comp and biz hierarchies.

As to support from Yggdrasil themselves, while they often reply to col.help
questions, they also state their policy in their manual: custom support
is "for money" via a 900 line (although they have also outlined a
mail-robot system). So their IS a place to ask Yggdrasil questions. It's
just that you don't like it (I don't either actually, but that's not the
point.)

biz groups would not help you in this case.
