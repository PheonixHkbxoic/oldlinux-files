Subject: Are Micron Powerstations good Linux machines?
Date: 27 Sep 1994 00:56:40 GMT

Hello Folks,
      I'm considering buying a P90PCI or P66PCI Powerstation from Micron 
as a new PC.  I'd like to run Linux as the primary OS, so I first wanted
to make sure it is an okay machine to run it on.  The machine I'm looking
for has the following components:

Intel 90MHz/66MHz Pentium

256K 15ns cache

16MB 70ns RAM, expandable to 192MB

4 ISA slots, 2 PCI slots, and 1 ISA/PCI slot

Phoenix flash BIOS

Intel's Neptune PCI chipset

3.5" floppy

Mitsumi 280ms double-spin CD-ROM (IDE)

527MB (10ms) IDE hard drive (Connor)

15'' Micron 15FGx SuperVGA, non-interlaced screen, 1280 x 1024, .28dp

1 parallel port, and two 16550-compatible serial ports

Diamond SpeedStar 64 PCI 2MD DRAM video card

      I'd be primarily be using the machine for development, and running 
X full-time would be nice too.  The reviews of the machine seem to be 
quite good, at least when windows places are reviewing it.  Basically, 
I'm looking for any additional thigns I should take into consideration 
for running unix or Linux in particular.
      There are a few gotchas I can see with the bundle, and if you can 
point out any others, that'd be great.  First, the diamond card is 
obviously not supported by XFree86.  Therefore, I need to find a 
replacement.  For a bit more $, they offer a Matrox MGA II+ PCI 2MB card, 
which looks like a good buy, except it doesn't look like that's supported 
either.  Does anybody know if it is being worked on, or how hard it would 
be to add support?  If that's not a feasable option, they allow you to 
drop the monitor and video card and save $350.  Would it be better to buy 
a more standard setup from a local store?
      It also doesn't look like Linux supports any IDE CD-ROMs, so I'd 
probably need to replace it with a SCSI equivlent.  They offer a Plextor 
DM-3028 SCSI-2 2X drive, which sounds like it'd be okay, but I'm not sure.

      Any ideas or suggestions would be appriciated.
      
Thanks!

No, multi-part archives are still not supported.  But why are you using
PKZIP for that anyway?  ARJ's multivolume support currently is much better.

I was able to run DesignCad under DOSemu.  This isn't entirely a joke

was much faster to print to a postscript printer and have ghostscript
convert it to Cannon BubbleJet output than have DesignCad rasterize the

I didn't try the 3-D version of the program, but I can if you are

Since it appears that I can get a 1522 for around $80.00 and a 1542 for

better or more realiable than the 1522?

I will be using this in a 486 linux work station.

any advice appreciated..

It is widely recogonized that YP with AMD is not a very good idea. As you
can provide AMD with commands on the startup line then I suggest something like

        % amd -a /tmp_mnt -- /home `ypcat -k auto.home`

Holy cow!  I just downloaded the Linux News #3 which Lars Wirzenius just

readers have already found out: there is a hidden clue in there somewhere...)"
So is anybody going to give some details on exactly where I can find
this piece of information?  I grepped through the source for things such

the time starting at 1/1/70 since he would have been born within a few

Yes and no -

No - Linux is unix (or at least as close as you can get without 
    some one suiing you), so there shouldn't be a macro assembler
    since you can have the same effect with simpler tools.

    The Linux as is also intended to assemble compiler output,

Yes - take cpp, m4, or macro language of your choice to pre-process

Folks,
        This is my second posting about this problem. Hopefully, I'll
get advice from the fellow netters this time.
        When I run "fax wait" to keep the "efax" running always ready to
receive incoming faxes, I've trouble using the modem for out-going connections.
Yes, I set-up my "efax" as well as my "pppd" to use UUCP-lock files. Yes, I
gave "-s" switch to "efax" to release the lock file while waiting for
action on the fax.
        The problem I've is that when "pppd" dials the modem (on an outgoing
connection), I hear ***beep--beep--beep** from the modem (as if it is ready
to receive a fax, those fax beeps). Even if then kill my efx/fax processes,
and reset my modem through "minicom" at&F command, it still does that. 
        In fact, the only way for me seems to be to "re-boot" the m/c. Any
pointers are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Uday.

The limitation is that your graphics hardware is not supported by the
VGA256 server. The only way to solve the problem is to write a driver
for your chipset and include it in the VGA256 server. Or hope that
someone else will do that :-)
