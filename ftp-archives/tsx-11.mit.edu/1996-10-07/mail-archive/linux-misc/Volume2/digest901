Subject: LINUX on an Mac Centris 610 DOS machine

I'm strongly considering buying a used Macintosh Centris 610 DOS
machine, which has a PC motherboard (486 SX/25) inside. Has anyone out
there tried to install linux in this kind of machine? If so, were there
any special hurdles you had to jump? I've been working with linux for a
couple of months on a standard PC, but haven't ever installed it
myself, so I guess that makes me a relative newbie. Thanks for any
info.

Date: Thu, 6 Oct 1994 22:57:21 GMT

Has anyone used the GCC to generate code for the ARM6 or may Acorn?
I know this isn't strictly a linux question, but this is misc. and I 
found a bunch of references and files refering to the ARM2/3/6 codegen
for GCC on my YGGdrassil linux cdrom...
I've got a Newton and would like to find a way to compile for it using
my linux boz rather than a macintoy of dos/winblows (whenever apple 
feels like getting off their butts and porting the NTK and CC to Intel..)

thanks, heinz

There's anew Commercial-HOWTO on sunsite. The hottest version is on
ftp.ix.de:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/Commercial-HOWTO (different formats

There are several SQL packages. Roumours say there is a free COBOL compiler
around. There's no commercial COBOL yet, but Acucobol is considering
releasing a Linux version.

i think michael abrash would take issue with you on this one.  :-)

ah, but the devil's in the details of that little "improved" adjective,
such as 8k internal cache vs 0k internal cache, improved microcode,
improved pipeline, etc.  plus, the 486's *internal* math coproc far
outperforms the 386/387 combination.

for example: when i first bought my 486dx/33 many moons ago, a friend of
mine also purchased an amd 386dx/40.  he suffered under the illusion that
his 386 would be faster than my 486 for strictly integer work, since his
cpu had the faster clock.

he was not too pleased when his (strictly integer) benchmarks indicated
my "slower" 486 was nearly twice as fast as his 386.  btw, the machines
were identical in all respects except for cpu, i.e., same manufacturer,
same amount of cache, same amount of memory, etc.

Date: 07 Oct 1994 20:38:14 GMT


We purchased Yggdrasil Fall 1994 Plug-and-Play recently,
and here are some of the problems we`ve encountered so far:

1. Im-Pass-word: User cannot change password.
    If you change password as a user, you will receive:
          Can't open /etc/ptmp, can't update password

2. More than you asked for:   'more' behaves strangely: 
    in console (non-X), you'll get segmentation fault.
    in X's xterm, you'll have trouble scrolling.
    The problem also affects 'appropos'.

3. Plug-and-Play, no-plug, no-play:  waning CD-ROM can be a challenge
    We didn't install everything (has anyone?), thus we picked
    packages we wanted from control-panel.  Guess what, we still
    have pointers to CD-ROM, such as /usr/X386/lib/libX11*.


As a posting earlier noted, unless you have only 10MB
on the hard disk, you may want to stay away from the
Plug-and-Play.  It appears that yggdrasil (not entirely
improper) has spent much energy in creating a
Plug-and-Play, and much less so in creating a well- (or
ever-) tested Linux package.

The current yggdrasil CD is our second buy, and I can
see the decline in quality. I sincerely hope that folks
at yggdrasil keep up the spirit of Plug-'n-Play, while
at the same time improve quality.

so *that's* what happened to it; i was wondering why my yggdrasil fall
'93 cd had kermit, but my summer '94 one didn't.

although i still see vestiges of kermit in the new release, such as a
.kermrc file in /, & it's still advertised on the cover of your manual,
i.e.:

    The 76,323 files in this complete plug-and-play operating system include:

Is that "Black Box" catalog, an U.S. based company ? Do they have an 800

This electronic registration does not seem to be working for UNIX EXPO. 
Perhaps it's too late to register this way.  It let me register for PC EXPO
but not UNIX EXPO.

Not really, that I know of, but some are close.  I use xvnews 2.2.1, and
although it's not threaded, it will sort the messages alphabetically by
subject, and it's smart enough to ignore "Re:"s at the beginning.  This
is not quite the same as being fully threaded, but it seems close enough
for me.  Also, DEC has a version of xrn, called dxrn, which does do threading.
So far, however, I have not found a way to enable this automatically-- you
have to choose "thread articles" off a menu every single time you enter
a group.  This is quite annoying.  Also, dxrn wants either the DECwindows
or Motif widgets.  I've never seen it running on Linux, although I suspect
the Motif version should work (I've built it on Ultrix, OSF/1, SunOS, A/UX,
and SCO).

Dunno, but it would be long...I use xvnews, Mosaic, xarchie, and mftp on Linux.
I use Mosaic for hitting gophers as well as Web servers.

Hello all....I recently installed the Slackware 2.0.1 Cnews package and am
experiencing some difficulties now.

I -USED- to have everything running just fine, but somehow my active file
became corrupted, my spool drive started to die w/ errors and things kind of
stopped working.

I saved all my config files and re-added all my groups.

Now, when the system starts to process it's incoming News spools, they
wind up being thrown into the /usr/spool/news/in.coming/bad directory.

Here's what my Errlog says..

We are using SLIP!  And the problems we see are not *after* a connection
is successfully opened, it is one of the system *refusing* connections
(apparently).  Nearly all functions handled by inetd seem affected: 
telnet logins, rlogins, ftp attempts, smail connections, attemps to do
zone transfers from named by our provider's router, you name it.  Things
work fine *most* of the time, but the login problems are the most

'connect from...' but the user never gets a prompt, or never gets a
password prompt after entering username.  Netd entries in the log are
'connection refused' mostly.

100% agree. I've had an experience translating a technical book from english
to russian. For `historical' reasons we were forced to do it in Word 5.5.
We've found that most productive way is to type text in `text mode' of
the wordprocessor, and format later - exactly the thing LaTeX does, but
in Word user should format manually, LaTeX do it automatically :).
It is why I prefer LaTeX. May be groff or other flawors of TeX would be better,
but I'm not familiar with them.

Also I participated in making a reprint in LaTeX. Initial articles were
in raw ASCII with different forms of pictures - from ASCII art to encapsulated
PostScript. Reprint was ~200 pages long. All work was done by two persons
in 1.5 days. It is same or faster than equal job done in Word for Windows,
though Word for Windows require 486s for NORMAL work; 
our work was done on 386SXes <g>.

It means that LaTeX at least NOT LESS productive than Word.
Convenience is too much a matter of a personal taste. 
Also `sheeps follow shepherd', and people tend to accept as 
convenient things they are told to be convenient ;).

Another argument against WYSIWYG: it draws your text as it will look on
the paper. It doesn't mean it will look well on the screen.
To make text on the screen easy readable/editable you should select 
other fonts and format in another way.
May be when we will hawe 600Dpi flat screens...

Learning curve for LaTeX is also very short. Everybody who has some
experience in ASCII editing and isn't brain dead since birth, may learn 
LaTeX basics in several minutes. He/she just should have short sample file
and know several simple facts (read f(orgotten) README :).

On another hand maketing (sp?) of newspaper page _requires_ WYSIWYG.

I've found that for me ever making letters/memos is better/faster in LaTeX.
I very easy get sick of slow screen redraws in WYSIWYG editors, ever on 
486/fast VGA. Pentium or Alpha required for basic wordprocessing makes me 
er... feel that something is very wrong.

I agree that WYSIWYG is aways fun, often convenient and sometimes necessary.
It does not mean it is always necessary and convenient.

Agreed, and what's with this desire to strip away so many of the
normal Unix utils?  sed + awk <200K (slack 2.0 binaries), and most of
the other shell tools are similarly small.  Leaving out development
stuff, gnu-emacs, etc. may make sense in some cases, but with disk
space as cheap as it's gotten the minimal savings from omitting basic
utilities is hardly worth the inconvenience this will almost certainly
cause the user in the long run, IMHO.

But doesn't Intel sell a chip that upgrades a 486DX-33 into a 486DX2-66?
How do they manage that?
