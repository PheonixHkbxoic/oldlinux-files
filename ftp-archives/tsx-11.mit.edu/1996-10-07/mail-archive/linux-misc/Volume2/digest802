Yes, just make sure that the correct IRQ is set in the file mcd.h in the
include/linux directory.

Hi, there,

Does anyone know how to use dip to setup SLIP for a remote server that
uses dynamic IP address assignment? The sample.dip file doesn't work
for me. The dip version I am using is 3.7.7. If you already made your
SLIP work (with dynamic IP address assignment), could you drop me some
tips or send me your dip script file through email? I really appreciate
your help.

Thanks in advance

Well, not necessarily - depends on what you want to do, as always. I
have 16M RAM and I think it's generally just fine for Linux, and I'm a
not-so-light user. Other operating systems supporting X may of course
use more memory for running the same things.

Right now I have X, emacses, xterms, Kermit and various little things
like xload and xclock running. The "free" programs says this:

# free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers
Mem:         15296      14508        788      11456       5140
Swap:         5872          0       5872
#

So, you could still do this in 12M quite comfortably. Having multiple
copies of Emacs doesn't take much more memory per se. Running GNUS
in the emacses does take memory (the listing above includes a GNUS
session to a moderate-size local NNTP server).

I have a Mitsumi FX001D controlled by a Sound Blaster 16 MCD.  The
SB16 is their latest revision with the Mitsumi CD IO port set at 0x230.
The only options I have are 230, 250, 270 and 290, while with the older
board, the IO port can be set starting at 0x300.  I was trying to install
the Yggdrasil Linux, the boot diskette insists on looking for a Sony CD
ROM drive, I guest it sees the IO port of 0x230 being set, I believe 
that is where the Sony default.  Can I use the boot command to tell 
LILO that I have a Mitsumi CD at 0x230 and IRQ 11?

I can't remember that I patched ramdisk.c and my memory is not so bad!
So there are at least 2 possibilities left:

I used kernel 1.1.49 maybe this was patched. Otherwise I solved the problem
by defining RAMDISK=0 in the lilo.config file without knowing anything about
ramdisk.c (sounds as music). By the way where is the story about the patch?

Onno.

I ordered a Royal P90 about one month ago.  I was told the system would
ship on the following Friday.  It did not.  It fianally shipped 6 days
later.  When I got the machine, they sent me DRAM instead of VRAM on the
video, and no mouse ($9 cheapo, but it's the point).  Then came the big
run-around that the invoice said DRAM, not VRAM.  They told me I could
upgrade to VRAM for like $100 or so.  Anyways... after two weeks they
replaced the video card (ATI GPT OEM) and gave me a mouse.  System is FAST,
good quality, and I haven't had a problem *YET*.  (Didn't order a monitor
with it though).  
Make sure you specify what hardware you want (they were selling SuperMicro,
I requested Intel)!

This is common practice (and, in fact, required by many TCP/IP protocl
stacks).  Whether or not it is "correct" is unclear.  It's quite
possible to implement routing using the same IP address on two
interfaces, if one of them is a point-to-point link (namely,
a slip line).  The idea of every physical network having its own
IP network is ideologically pure.  Ideological purity, while clean
and elegant, is often discarded in favour of optimizations.  Given
the current state of the IP address space, it could easily be argued
that wasting an entire network on a 2-host point-to-point slip line
is incorrect behaviour :)

Keep in mind that BSD is just the most prevalent TCP/IP
implementation, and not the definition of the protocols.

I had similar problems and finally found in
        /usr/src/linux/driver/net/dummy.c
a solution. You can read at the beginning...

    /* dummy.c: a dummy net driver

        The purpose of this driver is to provide a device to point a
        route through, but not to actually transmit packets.

        Why?  If you have a machine whose only connection is an occasional
        PPP/SLIP/PLIP link, you can only connect to your own hostname
        when the link is up.  Otherwise you have to use localhost.
        This isn't very consistent.

        One solution is to set up a dummy link using PPP/SLIP/PLIP,
        but this seems (to me) too much overhead for too little gain.
        This driver provides a small alternative. Thus you can do

        [when not running slip]
                ifconfig dummy slip.addr.ess.here up
        [to go to slip]
                ifconfig dummy down
                dip whatever

        This was written by looking at Donald Becker's skeleton driver
        and the loopback driver.  I then threw away anything that didn't
        apply!  Thanks to Alan Cox for the key clue on what to do with
        misguided packets.

                        Nick Holloway, 27th May 1994
        [I tweaked this explanation a little but thats all]
                        Alan Cox, 30th May 1994
    */

I've reconfigured my kernel (1.1.50) including 'Dummy net driver
support' and added

        ifconfig dummy slip.addr.ess.here up
        route add slip.addr.ess.here gw localhost metric 1

to some /etc/rc.d/* file.

With each day that passes by, I get more nervous about losing information

Does anyone know of a method, say, a via a parallel port backup device
of some kind, to make larger-scale backups?   Even though this would
likely require non-existant software/kernel features, I am interested 
enough in this to code myself.

Please enlighten me...(!!)

I am running xscreensaver as an 'extra' program under X.. it works very 
well.. it has many options, but I just switched to xdm... I'm running 
linux 1.1.50 and Xfree86 2.1.1 ... I wanted to run xscreensaver under xdm 
so that it would blank the screen, etc.. while the xdm login prompt was 
up there... and I added it to the /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0 file (I 
have added xv w/background .gif to this file, it does that correctly).. 
but under xdm, xscreensaver quits with the error message:

Xlib:  connection to ":0.0" refused by server
Xlib:  Client is not authorized to connect to Server
Error: Can't open display: :0

(I _am_ using display :0.0 .. I'm not TOO dumb...) can anyone email any 
suggestions to me? thanks!

Well I read about this problem earlier and I posted in short how I did it.
So again the story but more extensive.
It's a few weeks ago so maybe the story is not complete and reposts are needed.

1: take a existing bootfloppy  is easy because there is space left
   for another kernel.  You can mount it with mount /dev/fd0 /fd0 
   You can even remove the old  kernel on the floppy if  there is a
   space problem.
   
   From scratch it is more complicated and at last the same problem
   must be solved. At least you have to do something like:
   mkfs /dev/fd0 and you have an emty floppy then mount it etc.
   But almost everything on a slackware bootdisk is needed.
   (You must create the devices in /dev create /bin /etc and more )

2: make a kernel on your harddisk system
   copy the kernel to the root of the floppy (/fd0)
   now the kernel is on a bootflop , the only problem is how to boot
   from the new kernel

3: edit /fd0/etc/lilo.conf and add the kernel just added

4: run lilo -r /fd0      lilo with change root to /fd0
                         will change the bootrec on the floppy and add the kernel.
                         This command is essential to solve the problem!!!

5: reboot with the changed bootfloppy. You should be able to
   choose your kernel at the lilo prompt.



I hope I didn't forget anything, success!

                                                   Onno

The alpha driver is fairly stable.  It is not an acclerated

any problems.
