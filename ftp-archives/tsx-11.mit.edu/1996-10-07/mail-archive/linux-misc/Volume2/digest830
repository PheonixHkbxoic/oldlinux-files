There are 486 motherboards available that support both kinds of SIMMs.
The best performance seems to come from boards using the SiS '471 chipset.
I've seen several different designs, but they all have the following
features:
        3 VL slots, 2 master, 1 "video"
        3-4 ISA slots (one design has three 16 bit and one 8 bit slot)
        2 72-pin SIMM slots (populated 1 at a time)
        4 30-pin SIMM slots (populated 4 at a time).  
        Jumpered CPU clock
        "Green" support (the SiS '471 is a green chipset)
        3.3V regulator for the DX4 (sometimes optional)

Also tempting is the VLB-ISA-PCI motherboards, but they tend to compromise
performance for the multiple bus support.

The ASUS SP3G motherboard is very nice, with SCSI-IDE-2F-2S-1P-1M on the
motherboard and PCI slots, but it requires 72 pin SIMMs added in equal-sized
pairs.

Starting to use swap and swapping slowing you down are a bit different. You
have probably swapped out a few spare getty processes and the bit of the
X server that does start up - no harm done.

I use fvwm as the window manager, 3x3 desktop and rxvt (not X term) and
don't even touch swap on an 8Mb host.

Thanks for responding.  I tried that with the original boot diskette from

Templates sort of work in gcc 2.5.8. I've been using them successfully, but
I've had one problem. I have to include the implementation part along with
the interface part in every source file. If I don't, I get undefined
externals. This slows down compilations quite a bit. Anybody know a way
around this? I've tried the #pragma interface and #pragma implementation
statements with no success. Documentation of g++ templates is woefully
lacking.

Hi!

I tried to port some program from SYSV to Linux and found
strange differences in semaphore implementation.
The program below runs OK on SYSV (ISC) or BSD/386 1.1 but fails (got EAGAIN)
on semop call in Linux (Kernel 1.1.50).

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/sem.h>

key_t key = 5325633;
int semid;
#ifdef ISC
union Semun {
        int val;
        struct semid_ds *buf;
        unsigned short *array;
} U;
#else
union semun U;
#endif

void main()
{
        struct sembuf test[3] = {
                {0,  0, IPC_NOWAIT},
                {0,  1, SEM_UNDO},
                {0, -1, IPC_NOWAIT|SEM_UNDO},
        };

        if ((semid = semget(key, 1, IPC_CREAT|0666)) < 0) {
                perror("semget(IPC_CREAT)");
                exit(-1);
        }
        if (semop(semid, test, 3) < 0) {
                perror("semop(test)");
        } else {
                printf("semop(test) return OK\n");
        }
        printf("sem#0 has value %d\n", semctl(semid, 0, GETVAL, U));
        if (semctl(semid, 0, IPC_RMID, U) < 0) {
                perror("semctl(IPC_RMID)");
                exit(-1);

If you don't want the "classic unix" stuff or andrew, you have the
option of for example WP5.1 under dosemu (dosemu seems to work very well
now) or WP for SCO using the iBCS support.  The combination of good dos
emulation and iBCS gives you many alternatives.

This is getting to be an extremely frequent subject...perhaps it

I have set up an IP net of several nodes at home.  Following general 
conventions, they're given the addresses 192.0.0.1, 192.0.0.5, and
192.0.0.9.  At least one of these addresses (.1) already exists on the 
Internet.  If this one is connected via PPP to a node on the Internet, it 
must be given another address to avoid confusion.

Are there IP addresses set aside for standalone LANs?  Where are they 
documented?

This is elvis taking advantage of a little used xterm feature. Xterm has
a mode where an application can get information about mouse events. In
this mode you have to use SHIFT with the mouse buttons to select and
paste. Elvis after version 1.7 uses this mode.

I reckon one could argue equally well that the mis-design is in xterm
rather than elvis.

A small correction.  It hasn't been sent yet although Ross Biro, my
esteemed coworker, plans to send them once he finishes the diffs.

I'm also not certain if we'll send them directly to Linus or make them
publicly available as a patch vs. 1.1.51 (or whatever is current) so
that they can be used by the Linux community more quickly.

Performance is somewhat slow, but as they say, something is better

I would like to know too, I have a Diamond Speedstar 64 PCI which uses the
same Currus Logic 5434 chip.  I've configured it as a clgd5424 for X and it
works fine for all the display modes, except when I exit, then when screen
will just goes into funny characters.  I have tried using the clgd543x driver
but with no luck.

I've got the SLS CDROM. It was quite easy to get going, but I had trouble
recompiling the kernel, and the printed documentation supplied didn't
correspond to the software - files and directories missing, and so on.
However, I've subsequently added a lot of stuff from various ftp sites,
including a recent kernel (which compiled without any problems), and
created my own personal system. If you take this route, it doesn't
really matter which one you get. I've seen one or two other postings
along these lines.
