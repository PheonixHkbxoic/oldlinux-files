since we're talking about comments and why /**/ is still useful,
consider:

class A
{

 public:
  virtual void JustAMethod();

 ...
};


/* virtual */ void
A::JustAMethod()

}


the same holds for static methods, since they differ in that special
way from normal methods.

This is VERY useful to the reader, no header perusing should be required
just to read code.  Particurlarly with syntax chroma-coding...
The former can't be done in the same fashion with // comenting.
thus, you'd end up with something like:

// virtual
void A::JustAMethod()
{
  // who cares what's in here..
}


or something similar.  Obviously its the same thing, essentially, but
its 'nice' to have function type/attributes on the same line...

Linux fans:

        I retrieved xvgr-2.09.tar.Z from export.lcs.mit.edu, edited
the Makefile as instructed and compiled.  The compile was uneventful.
When I try to run xvgr, however, it crashes due to a floating point

1) Has any one of you wizard's gotten xvgr to run?

2) How?

I'm running slackware 1.1.18.

Fine.  Are you developing the kernel?

When I issue an 'sz' on the remote system while inside the terminal window
("downloading") Seyon simply receives the file on the local system.  There's
an "auto detect zmodem" button on one of the menus.  Perhaps you don't have
it set?  Give that a try.

To upload, you need to issue the 'sz' in Seyon's "shell" window.  This wasn't
completely clear to me the first few times I tried uploading (I found an
obscure reference to this in the "help" within Seyon... in the section where
issuing shell commands within Seyon is discussed, an example happens to be the
issuing of 'sz').  I'm not sure what you need to do on the remote end, because
my online provider seems to have "auto detect zmodem" in effect so that when
I upload, the file just ends up in the current directory.

Good.  I was about to go re-install my static libraries so that I could do this.
I got my curiosity piqued when this thread started, and tried it out.  I'm 
impressed.  I had been using asedit, but this is better.  The external
commands are better set up, and easier to configure.  The split window
is a great feature, and the changable fonts (to any you have installed) is also
very nice.  You can set any defaults you like on-the-fly.  I don't know why
it's better to change configurations in $(HOME)/.nedit than in the app-defaults, 
but it does work well.

What's great about the net is the benefit of the doubt that everyone gets by
default.  Why do you people have to make everything a crusade?  Why can't you
just lighten up?  It's all just ones and zeros.  It's not necessary to look

In the wee early hours of this morning, I was Linuxing away and my entire 
system froze up on me.  Finally after a long time, I had to hit the RESET 
button.

Now, when I boot up, it gives me a prompt with the none in it.

(none)~/                                          (now)
brutus/                                           (in the past)

It appears all my stuff is there but I cant do anything with it.  I tried to 
do a fsck but couldnt find it.  I tried to mount, dismount, halt, shutdown.  
Nothing seems to work.  In fact, only mount and dismount are even found.  This 
may be a path issue but I am not sure.

The mount and dismount commands produce an error saying something about 
/etc/mtab~ cannot be created because file system is read only.  I then went to 
my boot diskettes and brought the system up also with read only.

I really need to get this back up and running soon.  Any help or suggestions 
would be greatly appreciated.

The answer is quite simple. You need a Linux compatible SCSI
interface (see the Hardware-HOWTO to see if yours is). My
Syquest drive shows up as /dev/sda since it is the only
SCSI drive I have. You'll have to create filesystems on your
cartridges, of course, but you do this just as if the
Syquest drive was a hard drive.

You may have to reconfigure/recompile the kernel to get the

I understood the question as whether Windows would run in standard mode.
"Real mode" was nowhere mentioned by the original poster, but he/she might
have confused me.
Nevertheless I don't think it is worth it to wait for WINE (no slight to
the developers implied). If it only runs 'certified' apps, you probably
will find that even those don't run as well under WINE as under original
MS-Windows, but perhaps I am a cynic.

Anyway, Unix and X Windows fit me better than DOS & MS Windows, however
much applications exist under MS Windows. This is a very *personal*
observation and the next person may feel different.

If it doesn't cause too much trouble, I think it would be a good idea...

Yeah, I meant for <ncurse/unctrl.h>;  I thought (hoped) that gcc
would search /usr/local/include just like SunOS and other compilers.
(A quick check of the man page just now didn't reveal the answer)
Of course, even if it worked, it wouldn't be a general solution.

The message means you SHOULD NOT put something you want to boot in the
1024th cylinder or above.  It's because your BIOS which control the
very initial boot process cannot access more than 1024 cylinders.  But
after the inital phase is loaded, it's up to your OS to implement
routines to handle hard disk I/O.  In linux, it's okay to use more than
1024 cylinders, but before linux can get started, you have to boot it,
and therefore the warning message.

As the partition cross over the 1024th cylinder mark, you will be very
confused, as sometime, you can boot off the partition, but sometimes,
just after a recompile, you may not boot linux. Because, sometime, your
linux image will be located before the 1024th cylinder, and everything
is fine, but a recompiled image may be placed outside the 1024th
cylinder.  Just bear in mind the above, you can proceed.

That's my 2 cents.
