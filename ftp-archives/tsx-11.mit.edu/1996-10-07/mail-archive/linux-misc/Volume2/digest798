I'm having the same problem with atof()!  I've been going nuts tring
to find the cause!  Is it a library bug, or what?

Linux 1.0.8, libc.so.4.5.24, gcc 2.5.8, 486DX40.

Here's the snippet of code that's causing it.  (This works on SunOS 4.1.3)

double getElement(gstr,gstart,gstop)
int  gstart, gstop;
char gstr[80];
{
    int  k, glength;
    char gestr[80];

    glength = gstop - gstart + 1;

    for (k = 0; k <= glength; k++)
        gestr[k] = gstr[gstart+k-1];

    gestr[glength] = '\0';

    return(atof(gestr));
}

Subject: ** autoconf.h? **
Date: 21 Sep 1994 13:40:19 GMT
Reply-To: nelson@seahunt.imat.com

Recently, when attempting to build some applications (one was yamm), I've
encountered a problem where the application will #include 

        "/usr/src/linux/include/config.h"

config.h isn't a problem, because it's there, and it gets #included without
problem.  But config.h has a line in it that #includes "<linux/autoconf.h>",
and there is no autoconf.h anywhere on my system.

So far I've been able to get around the problem by commenting the #include
of that file out of config.h, and the applications seem to build without
problem... but it makes me uncomfortable when I have to hack system files
like this... 

Is this #include of autoconf.h an error in config.h, or should I really have
an autoconf.h?

BTW, I am currently running 1.51, which started as a complete 1.45 with the
subsequent patches applied in sequence.

I would imagine it depends on what you mean by "support." If you mean, can I 
talk to the Linux machine with Netware, the answer is: if you have TCP/IP 
bound to one of the NICs on your server, yes! I've run IBM's TCP/IP over Token 
Ring with OS/2, but never with Netware.

The Netware support for Unix resources (esp. printers) is pretty good, by many 
accounts. I don't see any reason why Netware should have any problem with 
Linux, if both are configured properly.

Well, I really am not trying an BSD vs. Linux argument, just 
want to give you some data points on NCR performance.
(Anybody got BONNIE results for other controllers on a similar
hardware platform (ie. modern 1GB drive and 486/66). ???)

The following are BONNIE results from our NCR 53c810 driver
run on a 486DX2/66 under FreeBSD-1.1. The newer kernels 
improve performance, but we never did another complete set
of tests, and for completeness I'll cite this (3 month old)

## FAST SYNC without and with 16 Tags on 100MB file.                         ##

(BTW: The drive used was a Seagate ST31200 that was 70% filled, an empty 
drive would give better results due to less fragmentation, this is the 
reason for the 100MB results being better, too).

I've marked the most interesting values: Reading 8KB blocks (what that 
file system release generally does) is 1.7MB/s and takes 17% of the CPU.
Writing is up to 3.0MB/s at 40% of the CPU, since finding free blocks 
takes more cycles than just reading the indirect blocks ...

Using TAGS helps a lot with this drive, which doesn't seem to do any 
read ahead on its own ... More then 8 TAGS reduce throughput, so 4 to 8 
seems to be most reasonable.

These values compare favourably against those obtained on large RISC
file servers.

This is likely a I/O address conflict.  What kind of disk controller are you
using?  What address are the cards jumpered to?  Remember that the NE2000

Are there any Tx or Rx errors reported in /proc/net/dev?  What about error

No, the destination address must not always be a 'host'. If you make a 'nestat -rn'
for example, you will not find as many 'host' routes as 'network' routes.
'host' routes have the 'H' flag set wheras 'network' routes have the 'G' flag set.
Therefore there could conceptually be a network with number 127.0.0.0. But this
number is per definitionem reserved for local connections on your computer.
I.e the kernel can use the same addressing scheme for local connections (remember
the 'localhost' entry in /etc/hosts), as it would use for external connections.

Great definitons.  As a mater of fact, they remind me alot of the last 
definitons I read through (in 'The Multi-Media producer's legal survival 
guide, a real good, if expensive, guide to intellectual property rights 
issues for non-lawyers.)  I suppose that is because this is the 'correct'

Guess so.
