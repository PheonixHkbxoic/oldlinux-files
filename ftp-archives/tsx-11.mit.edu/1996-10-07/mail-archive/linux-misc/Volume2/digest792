Yes.  Information on how to do this is in the HOWTO's.
Your partition should probably be at least 80, preferably over 100, megabytes.

For shame.

That is only _one_ of the _many_ beauties of Linux.  Granted that it is a
large one, but there are others.
  1) True multitasking for those whose multitasking was limited to 
       MeSsy-Windows
  2) Kernel source available for education and hacking
  3) Unix-like programming power and compatibility

Subject: Linux Businesses
Date: Mon, 19 Sep 1994 07:42:18 GMT

After due consideration of everyone's interest, I would like to offer
my support to businesses that are offering Linux support and services.

I propose that businesses that are offering Linux support and service
send to my email address (rph@netcom.com) a description of their Linux
services available. This could be CD-ROM distributions, contracting,
consulting, hardware, software, Linux T-Shirts, books, etc. 

I will then cat the info, and then gzip the resulting text. I will then put
this file in a directory available for anonymous ftp (ftp.netcom.com
/pub/rph).

People need to know what services are available. So if businesses would
kindly keep their descriptions of their Linux services to 10 lines or less
of 80 characters per line and get their info to my email address prior to
the 25th of each month, I'll start this service. I should have the file
out by the end of each month. This listing will be free.

I will continue this service as long as I can.

I reserve full editorial rights, so please follow the above rules. 

I would like to offer the Linux community the chance to name this thing.
I thought about the 'Linux Thrifty Nickle'.

I hate to question your figures, but I'm interested in this for my own

Edit your /etc/lilo.conf file.
The file contains 3-line descriptions of each bootable partition.
(Lines starting with a hash mark '#' are comments.)
The partition listed first is the one which will boot by default.

The issue of PC-Plus which is out *now* is the one you want.  The CD

You're talking about running multiple DOSEMU sessions concurrently as
a way of multitasking DOS stuff?  I haven't tried OS/2, but my
experience is that running DOS apps. under emulation in Linux is much
slower than running the same programs under Desqview (or even MS-Win).
There is a lot more overhead to support, both in terms of memory & CPU
cycles.  Filesystem access *might* be faster under Linux, though I've
never benchmarked it.  One very noticeable difference is that floppy
disk use doesn't lock up the whole system, as happens under plain DOS.

I'd say that the biggest flaw in DOSemu right now is that it does not
use CPU time efficiently at all-- I've never been able to get the
"HogThreshold" parameter in the config file to work under recent
versions of the emulator, and any running DOS sessions will eat up as
much CPU time as they can even when idle.  For this reason you can't
run multiple DOSEMUs at once and expect to have decent performance in
the one you're using at any given moment...  native Linux apps get
zapped by this as well.  I haven't heard many complaints about this,
so it could be something unique to my setup that's causing it.  Has
anyone had better luck with curtailing DOSEMU's cpu-hogging?

On the positive side, crash protection seems to be very good-- I've
*never* had a program crash inside DOSEMU affect anything outside the
emulator (native programs or other emulation sessions).  However,
DOSEMU does provide options like direct port access which, if enabled,
can seriously weaken the protection layer.

If your main intention is to multitask DOS applications, you might
want to stick with Desqview or OS/2.  They'll probably give you better
performance and compatibility (DOSEMU can't yet run Windows 3.1, or
any other programs requiring DPMI / DOS extender functions).  If you'd
like to run mostly native Unix apps. with occasional use of DOS
emulation then Linux might be what you're looking for.

Hello!

Being new to Linux I have what may be a very newbie question about 
Linux's comaptibility with the PCI architecture.

I have a DECpc XL 466d2 which comes with a PCI-based NCR 53C810 embedded 
SCSI controller which controls my hard disk and CDROM drive.  The video 
card is VL bus DECpc 864 high res video adapter.

I am very interested in Linux for this system, but want to find out if:


1. The latest version of Linux is compatible with the above hardware?

2. If it is compatible with the above hardware, can I get the OS, 
   X-Windows, source, etc. on CDROM? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated!


Best regards. . . Mike

The kind that you have to install yourself, giving rise to the 
catch-22 problem.  I don't have an '825 board, and was unable
to test the code with the '825 so I didn't catch the omission of 
an 

        '825'

from two switch statements and a left over 2 inside an array that 
should have been dimensioned implicitly by the number of initializers.

It's entirely a software problem, mostly due to a lack of time.  Basically,
having what worked of the driver stable by the publication of the July
issue of iX Multiuser Multitasking Magazine and lecture notes for 
Heidelberg took precedence over getting that working correctly.

I spent a day getting the seriously broken context switching
code fixed, but haven't had a chance to fix the current flaw in 
the save/restore pointers code.

(FYI, Stefan Esser has it working fine under his Free BSD driver) 

>Will the NCR boards be as fast as the Buslogic ones as soon as your 
>drivers get more mature? 

Throughput should be somewhat higher, although CPU usage should be 
slightly worse with the NCR boards (More complicated structures 
are generated, taking more host CPU cycles).

>Or are the Buslogic boards inherently better 

If you want Adaptec 154x compatability for some reason (Ie, you
need to run an old copy of Xenix), yes.  

Also, the Buslogic boards have onboard active termination where as 
the NCR boards I've  seen have been passively terminated.  IMHO,
this isn't really an issue, since you're still looking at a factor
of three price disparity after picking up an active terminator.

>(why the price difference anyway)?

1.  Parts count


2.  As far as I know, the Buslogic 946 board is unique in that it's
        the only Adaptec 154x compatable PCI board.


3.  People have allways payed $200-$300 for 
        bus mastering SCSI controllers.  If they're still
        willing to pay that price, why should Buslogic 
        lower their prices?

4.  Multiple sources.
