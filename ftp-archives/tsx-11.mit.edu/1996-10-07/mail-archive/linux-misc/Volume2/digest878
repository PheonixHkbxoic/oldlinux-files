Great.  Let's hassle the poor folks at DigiBoard.  Then maybe we can get

ftp to ftp.wordperfect.com and cd into the directory:
 
UNIX/WP51/DEMOS/SCO

get the file sco.z.  This is a compressed tar file.  If you uncompress it
and gzip it it will drop from 8 megs to 5.

make a directory on you linux machine, and untar this file in that directory.
Get the file wpfix.tar.gz off of sunsite and follow the directions in it.

Please remember that "Linux" is not Linus (I have nothing against Linus 
personally). What I mean is that in its current form "Linux" is *much* more
than Linus could have achieved (probably) in the same time scale. It is
more a melting pot of team skills from around the world, and Linus, (most
likely one of the nicest people you are likely to meet), would wholeheartedly 
agree.

Moreover in expectation with this good nature it would be likely that he
would decline your offer of money because it makes those people who cannot
afford to donate feel alienated (think of those countries where linux has
reached - Russia/India where a single dollar is still relatively quite a
significant amount). Furthermore it may lead to a scenario of donation
competition - (i.e. I gave more than you).

To solve some of these problems a trust-fund is being set up, (details to
be published), which will serve as center for donations. The aim of this group
will be to distribute money for books/software/hardware to the various linux
developers, (including this Linus guy whoever he is), and also GNU to whom
linux owes so much.

Source code to xvnews is available from:

        ftp.uu.net:/networking/news/readers/xvnews/*

2.2.1 is indeed the last version, although 2.3 is currently being

It'll also cause about ten times the load and take days longer - get the

Subject: Re: Yggdrasil Linux Plug and Play CD ver1.1 ?
Date: Tue, 04 Oct 94 10:26:43 PDT


The only problems I have found with the Yggrdrasil distribution were related to 
a few files that were never moved to the HD but kept as a sym-link, even after 
installing cd independent.

This bit me the first time I built the 1.1 (pl 50) kernel.  I found make, a86, 
and a few other odd things that were nessisary to still be linked to the cd.  
The worst was, after the build and install of the image, one of the utilities 
ran before lilo in their make-install target was still missing from the local 
HD.  I had a system which no longer booted (replaced system image but not 
lilo'd).

After going back to a boot disk, finding the nessisary piece from the CD, and 
doing a lilo with a hand-built lilo config file (my root mounted as the CD with 
floppy boot), I was fine.

I like the slackware distribution and similar disk-image based distributions a 
little better because I feel I have better control over what I get when I 
install.  With the yggdrasil, it's often all or nothing, and sometimes all is 
not all.  For example, I did not want X, but was stuck with it in the yggdrasil 
distribution, and then had to prune it out.

If they could provide more menu choices up front offering finer control over 
what they install as their base system, or provide a post-install utility 
script which can 'trim' unwanted files from the HD (either re-symlink to the CD 
or remove completely) such as, in my case, X from the base system, ada compiler 
from gnu, etc, then I would be very happy with the Yggrasil distribution.

I am extremely interested if anyone knows for sure whether the ATI Mach 64

PCI video card and was leaning toward the Mach64.  Anyone have any other

possible.

Date: 4 Oct 1994 17:03:48 -0400

                     REQUEST FOR DISCUSSION (RFD)
                     comp.os.linux reorganization

Summary: A number of new groups in the comp.os.linux hierarchy are
         proposed, one moderated, the rest unmoderated.

Proponent: Dave Sill, de5@ornl.gov 

History: This proposed reorganization was prompted originally by the
         excessive level of traffic in comp.os.linux.help.  Following
         a straw poll conducted by the proponent, an RFD was posted
         for breaking comp.os.linux.help into various subgroups and
         creating comp.os.linux.answers for separating the
         documentation and announcements currently posted to
         comp.os.linux.announce.  During the discussion period, it
         became evident that it would be preferable to create the
         groups directly under comp.os.linux, rather than splitting
         comp.os.linux.help.  This RFD reflects that change.

1) Group: comp.os.linux.answers (moderated)

 Charter: For posting Linux FAQs, How-To's, and READMEs.  This will
          help keep the traffic down in other c.o.l.* groups and will
          leave comp.os.linux.announce for true announcements only.
          C.o.l.answers will be moderated--either by a member of the
          *.answers moderation team or by an independent moderator.
          If no one else volunteers, I'd be willing to be the
          moderator. 

2) Group: comp.os.linux.games (unmoderated)

 Charter: For questions and discussion about game playing under Linux,
          e.g. Doom.

3) Group: comp.os.linux.hardware (unmoderated)

 Charter: For questions and discussion specific to a particular piece
          of hardware, e.g., "can this system run Linux?", "how do I
          use this disk drive with Linux?", etc.

4) Group: comp.os.linux.networking (unmoderated)

 Charter: For questions and discussion relating to networking or
          communications including Ethernet boards, serial
          communications, SLIP, etc.

5) Group: comp.os.linux.video (unmoderated)

 Charter: For questions and discussion relating to video hardware or 
          software including XFree86, commercial X servers, svgalib,
          console modes/fonts, dosemu, etc.)

After a discussion period of 21-30 days, if there are not overwhelming
objections to any of the proposed groups, there will be a Call For
Votes (CFV) posted to the groups as this RFD.  The voting period will
be at least 21 days.  Each group that passes, by receiving 100 more
YES votes than NO votes *and* twice as many YES votes as NO votes,
will be created.
