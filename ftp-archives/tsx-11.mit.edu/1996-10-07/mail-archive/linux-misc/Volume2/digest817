In DOOM, press F11.  This cycles through 4 levels of gamma correction, and will

BAD idea.  These addresses are used for multicasting ONLY.  It will
not work properly.

Use class A network # 10, or class C network # 192.0.2.  Both are
reserved for local use.

This is outdated information.  The fall94 release (just announced in the 
.announce section) has a more SCO type install where it does a base 
installation (10 meg) automaticly and then lets you select individual 
'packages'.  I can't talk abotu the X-based installer in Fall94 because 
they now include a command-line basesd install_package command that  I 
MUCH prefer.  (A good deal faster and easier to use on my limietd hardare.)

Well, $34.95 list, really.

I've been very pleased with it. Even though i haven't installed a lot of 
stuff, having it their on CD-ROM for when  I DO need it is very handy.

The Fall94 also has a trick that at the moment I believe is special to 
yygdrasil, though they've sent it to Linus for general inclusion.  Thsi 
is the ability to 'thunk' calls to the 16bit MS_DOS CD-ROM and hard disk 
interface.  This makes it possible to use devies other then those 
supported directly by drivers.  (Don't ask me about performance as I 
haven't used it...)

I have the same problem and I also have it at work on my Sparc. I think it's
related to the window manager (I run olvwm on both systems). As for why you
click on the other window... you may want to raise it before you do the paste.

True.  But you'll note I didn't say anything about where those 2 addresses
need to reside.  Common sense would seem to suggest putting your
"router's" PPP port on your host's net, and it's ether on your own, and in
fact, this works.  At worst, external incoming connections will get aimed
at your ether IP number, but you don'e lost a _whole_ there...

I recently purchased a copy of the book and CD-ROM "Internet CD", by
Vivian Neou at SRI International, published by Prentice Hall.  On the
CD is a Slackware Linux distribution.  Source code for the Linux kernel
appears to be included, but source code for most of the GNU utilities
(which are provided in executable form) is absent.  Though the book contains
several order forms in the back for various pieces of software, I see
nowhere in the book an acknowledgement of FSF copyright, nor any offer to
provide source code for the GNU material.  Some COPYING files are embedded
within gzip'd tar files, but I see nothing that makes an obvious and specific
offer to provide source code.

Forgive me if this has already been brought up.

I am using a #9 GXE Pro (PCI)  on a Pentium 90 also.  I bought a driver from
X Inside  ( e-mail info@Xinside.com) called  Accelerated X and I am very happy
 with it.  I wanted the fastest X driver I could find however, and was willing to 
pay for it.  The X server and configuration utilities cost about $200.  It is a very 
high preformance driver tuned to the video card and is a joy to work with.  The
product supports resolutions from 640x480 up to 1600x1200 and colors from
16-16 million (depending on VRAM ).  Virtual Desktops are also supported.  I
realize that at $200 it will not be for everyone though.

I've set up ghostscript to drive my Laserjet 4L.  So to print from
LaTeX, I use the following Makefile to generate Postscript:

=============================
%.dvi:  %.tex
        latex $<

%.ps:   %.dvi
        dvips -D 300 -f -q -t a4 < $< > $*.ps

%.pv:   FORCE
        @make $*.ps
        ghostview $*.ps

FORCE:

=============================

This generates Postscript for A4 paper - I guess you will want
something different in America.

Then I print the Postscript by saying:

lpr -Pps <filename>

This Postscript is then converted to Laserjet format by lpd.  The
following /etc/printcap file causes files submitted to the printer
'ps' to be removed from the queue, converted to HP format and
resubmitted to the printer 'lj'.

=============================
# Entry for raw device ljet4.raw
lj|ljet|ljet4.raw|HP LaserJet 4L:\
    :lp=/dev/lp1:\
    :sd=/var/spool/ljet4/raw:\
    :tf=/etc/printtext:\
    :mx#0:sf:sh:rs:

# Entry for device ljet4 (output to ljet4.raw)
ps|postscript|Ghostscript device ljet4:\
    :lp=/dev/null:\
    :sd=/var/spool/ljet4:\
    :lf=/var/spool/ljet4/logfile:\
    :af=/var/spool/ljet4/acct:\
    :if=/etc/printps:\
    :df=/etc/printdvi:\
    :mx#0:sf:sh:rs:
=============================

Finally, you need two files, /etc/printps:

=============================
#!/bin/sh

gs -q -sDEVICE=ljet4 -r300x300 -dNOPAUSE -sOutputFile=- -sPAPERSIZE=a4 - | lpr -Plj
=============================

and /etc/printdvi.  This is used if you say lpr -d -Pps <filename>,
but this is not normally useful because then your virtual fonts will
not come out.

=============================
#!/bin/sh

dvips -D 300 -f -q -t a4 | gs -q -sDEVICE=ljet4 -r300x300 -dNOPAUSE -sOutputFile=- -sPAPERSIZE=a4 - | lpr -Plj
=============================

Easy isn't it?  :-)

I recently built a system for someone with an Intel Plato P54C
motherboard which used the Neptune chipset.  I used an NCR SCSI
controler with a patched kernel (version 1.1.19).  The first
motherboard I got had a flakey cache, and upgrading the BIOS didn't
help.  I replaced the motherboard, and everything has worked
flawlessly since.

The program is xanim.  I've seen mention of someone doing a port
with sound support and everything (was mostly doing work on the
sound, animation works fine I believe).  I suppose checking the
usual places (ie, sunsite.unc.edu and tsx-11.mit.edu) should turn
something up.

If not, check on ftp.x.org.  Don't remember the exact dir, but
it's fairly obvious.

   I don't think you understand Ted.  At least, that is all I can assume
   from your paragraph above.  There *is* a difference.  If someone
   invents an interface between two packages, for example taking a piece
   of GPL'ed code and making it into a subroutine package, then letting
   the user link that code into a program, THAT violates the GPL.

   The whole issue, to me, depends on whether or not the interface is
   created solely to work around the GPL, or if it was created for other
   purposes.  If this distinction is not made, if, say, the GPL must
   apply to any code that dynamically links into GPL'ed code, then
   GPL'ing code becomes much less attractive.  For example, my GPL'ed packet
   drivers dynamically link into the MS-DOS kernel.  Obviously the GPL
   cannot be made to apply to MS-DOS, so I would not be able to use the
   GPL on my code.

   If, on the other hand, anyone may create a dynamic link to a GPL
   package, voiding the GPL, even if the dynamic link was ONLY created to
   avoid the GPL, then the GPL has little force, and one may as well put
   code into the public domain.

This is precisely the hypocrisy that I'm complaining about.  It seems to
me that you (and the FSF) want to have it both ways.  Well, I'm sorry,
but if PGP and gmp are considered "one program", then your drivers and
MS-DOS must also be considered "one program".  You can't have it both
ways.

It seems to me that people are making a distinction as a convenient way
to control the outcome of how they want things to come out.  If they
want it to be allowed, then "obviously" the GPL cannot be made to apply
to MS-DOS.  But if they don't, then "obviously" the GPL must apply.
Sorry, but the legal system doesn't work that way.

Another example --- suppose I write a program that uses dbm; it can
potentially be linked against gdbm.  Hence, by your reasoning, my
program must fall under the GPL!  But perhaps the fact that there is a
non-GPL library is enough to make it O.K.  Alright, I'll write a slow,
stub library which implements the gmp interface.  Then PGP must be OK!
A stub library isn't enough?  Alright, I'll write a library which
implements the gmp interface but calls a slower package as its back-end.
Now is that OK?  I'm sure the FSF would find some reason why that
wouldn't be OK, since they dislike PGP so much.

The point at which something becomes OK by the FSF's "definition" is
purely arbitrary, which is what I dislike.  There is an entirely
separate question which is whether or not the FSF interpretation would
possibly even hold water in a court of law, or whether the FSF would be
laughed out of court.  Short of a test case actually coming before a
court, we won't know for certain the answer to this.

But even if the FSF interpretation is legally airtight, the fact that it
is arbitrary and depends on what is situationally convenient disturbs
me.  Fortunately, as long as you and I, the authors, own the copyright
on the code, and not the FSF, this trumps the entire issue.  This is why
I suggest that authors think twice before donating the ownership of
their code to the FSF.
