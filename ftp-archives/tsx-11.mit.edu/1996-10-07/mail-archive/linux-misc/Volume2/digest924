 you could be having problems with the resolver and tcpd, which comes
turned on by default in at least some distributions. if it can't
resolve the inaddr of the connecting host it will refuse the
connection.

I bought Yggdrasil Linux CD Fall version last week. I tried to boot it by using
MSCDEX but it did not work. I am a little frustrated why there is no warning 
from the cover that this MSCDEX is a experimental driver and it may not work
for all. Next, I tried to boot Linux by using the bootflpy.phl (I have
the LMSI CM205 CD). It recognized the CD and say "LMSI CD Ready" but then
the boottrap program complaints about SONY CD31a and 525 and "Unable to mount
VFS".  I got the errata, but there seems no fixes for these problems yet.
There is any way that I can get the instructions to recompile the dosload
program and tried to figure out why runlinux.bat does not work for me. I tried
to look into why lmsci driver hangs the sony cd. Thanks alot.

===============================================================================
                      Third BETA Distribution Announcement
===============================================================================

BSVC is a microprocessor simulation framework written in C++ and Tcl/Tk.
It was developed as a senior project at North Carolina State University
by Bradford W. Mott.  BSVC provides a graphical user interface and a
collection of C++ classes to facilitate the development of microprocessor
simulators.  So far the BSVC framework has been used to developed a 
Motorola 68000 simulator and a HECTOR 1600 simulator.  The BSVC distribution 
contains the following:

  * BSVC Graphical User Interface (written in Tcl/Tk)

  * BSVC Simulator Framework (C++ classes)

  * Motorola 68000 simulator & assembler (including the M68681 Dual UART)

  * Hector 1600 simulator & assembler


CHANGES
=======

This is the third BETA release of BSVC.  The following changes have been made:

  1.0b2 to 1.0b3:

    a) Added an INCLUDE directive to the 68000 assembler
  
    b) Fixed a bug in the Program Listing window that caused it to
       only work for programs listed in ascending order
           
    c) Corrected a small problem with the file selector that caused it
       to "grab" the mouse while reading a directory (This causes problems
       with networked file systems that take a long time to read)

    d) Fixed bugs in two of the Framework classes that caused them not
       to compile under GCC 2.6.0

  1.0b1 to 1.0b2:

    a) Added a BREAK instruction to the 68000 simulator and assembler
       that acts like a breakpoint.  When the simulator executes this
       instruction while "running" it will stop running like it
       hit a breakpoint.

    b) Added a new file selector to the user interface

    c) Fixed several small bugs in the HECTOR 1600 simulator


Supported Systems
=================

The BSVC distribution supports the following systems:

  * Linux 1.x.x
  * Ultrix 4.3
  * SunOS 
  * HP-UX 9.0


Required Software
=================

BSVC requires the following software to compile and run:

  * gcc and the g++ library

  * Tcl/Tk (Needs the "wish" executable with the addinput extension.
            I'm working on making "wish" binaries available for the
            supported systems listed above)


Distribution Site
================= 

The BSVC distribution can be obtained from ftp.eos.ncsu.edu in the 
pub/bsvc directory as "bsvc-1.0b3.tar.Z". 


Contacts
========

If you have any questions regarding the BSVC distribution send mail to:

This is incorrect.  Slackware 2.0.1 contains Joe version 1.0.12, which I

Good...I guess it isn't lost anymore. :)

It's does great multitasking (unlike certain OS's out of Redmond, WA).

No, it's not a patch like Windows and takes over the whole machine.  I 
think there is a program that will boot linux from the DOS prompt, so I guess 
you could say it runs under DOS :)

Congratulations Dan, you just stumbled into one of the most exciting
movements in cyberspace.  Before you start asking a lot of questions
in the comp.os.linux.* newsgroups, read the FAQs, read the posts,
and just develop a 'feel' for what linux is all about.  If you
don't there are those is the shadows waiting to bite your head off.

Who knows, maybe you will write a super linux utility in 6 months
we all will benefit from.  But in the meantime, look a little bit
