Uh, think again. Unless svgalib has changed since the newest version
I have, programs using it MUST be setuid root, or run by root. If it
has changed since 1.11, then ignore the rest of this message.

Just for fun I just ftp'ed the newest version I could find, 1.11,
and the README says:

        Programs that use svgalib must be setuid root. I don't know how
        desirable it is to have this changed; direct port access can hardly
        be done without. Root priviledges can now be given up right after
        initialization.

No, setuid is not inherently evil. Dangerous if you don't know
what you're doing, yes. Necessary, sometimes. Please a) read the
documentation of the package you are speaking of, and b) know what
you're talking about before posting kneejerk responses.

The README in the package also states:

        4.  How to use svgalib (and vgagl)
 
        Do use vga_init as a first line. This will give up root priviledges right
        after initialization, making setuid-root binaries relatively safe.

Date: 4 Oct 1994 04:26:04 GMT

Greetings.

I'm attempting to find a word processor for Linux.  One that will
allow me to create reports, and type up documents.  

So far I've been using Jove, which is useful as a text editor, but
not as a word processor.  I'm looking for somthing that will allow
for different fonts, along with text formatting.

I don't think emacs is what I'm looking for.

I've heard of TeX, but I'm not really sure what it is, and I'm 
hesitating to install the 14 disks it takes for the binary
distribution.

So, what is a good word processor for Linux or Unix in general?
Preferably somthing that is freeware or shareware.

What do you use?

Thanks,

Having asked this myself, the replies I received all said...Nope, won't
work. Apparently Linux needs to see an IDE floppy (? Why ?) or it has to
boot from an IDE hard drive. They don't sound like particularly good
reasons to me, but that is what I've been told.

Maybe someone here can enlighten us? The new Houdini card for PowerMacs is
due in a few weeks, and Linux would solve oh! so many of my problems.

This is wrong. I went back and checked things and you _are_ given the option of 
specifying your mouse port the first time you try to run X. The install process
still didn't locate my modem and still didn't give me an option to specify where
it was, but my X problems were probably just a product of my having a bad day.

Couldn't agree more. I tried Linux and all editors it came with, but 
even for Dutch they weren't adequate; now I use Windows with a 
US-International keyboard definition and some Tibetan and IPA fonts I made in 
CorelDraw!.

I just installed Slackware 2.0.1 after wiping the disk.  I did not select
VIM to be installed, so I have whatever vi it is you get when you don't
select VIM.

I telnet from a Sun workstation (SunOS 4.1.3) to the Linux machine.  stty
shows the terminal (xterm) has 0 rows and 0 columns.  If I run vi and do
:set it tells me there are 65 lines.  If I use stty and set rows 24 and
restart vi it still things there are 65 lines.

If I rlogin from the same Sun workstation to the Linux machine stty
correctly shows 24 rows and vi correctly gets 24 lines.

How are we losing the terminal geometry with telnet, and why isn't vi
getting it right after I have set it with stty?

This has been a topic of debate previously as well.  FreeBSD's
development is open to anyone who wants to take part.  The official
distributions happen to be coordinated by a group of people.  This
group is a dynamic entity.  People come and go with time (I think it is
fair to say that there are more coming than going).  Anybody can
contribute code for inclusion into the releases -- if enough people
like it, it is really good, or you bug someone with commit priveledges
long enough, then it will get in.  (A warning here: if you contribute
enough code, you will probably be given commit priveleges, you will cease
to have a social life, and get very little sleep. :-))
The Linux kernel is coordinated by one person (Linus).  Anybody can
contribute code to it.  Thus there is not much difference here, except
that a group of people maintain the FreeBSD sources, whereas one person
maintains the Linux kernel.  Other parts of Linux are maintained by
individuals or groups, and distributions are done by yet other groups.
(With FreeBSD there just happens to be one team, who work together on
shipping the kernel, the userland, packages, and the whole damn thang.)

I don't think it is fair to say that either is more or less open, or
that the latest sources of one are more quickly available than the
other.  (You can get the latest source changes to FreeBSD within hours
of the commits going through.)  Anyone can subscribe to the mailing
list which carries the commit log entries for source changes made, and
can make their comments about the changes.  I don't know if there is
any such way of getting to-the-minute updates of source changes made to
Linux.
(I wouldn't hazard a guess on how soon after a source change is made
in Linux, it becomes available to the general hacking public.)

I think the comment that Linux is developed by a large open group as
against FreeBSD being controlled by a small number of people is
incorrect.  This is just failing to see the difference between the
group of people who develop the system, and the group of people who
take the responsibility of making sure that code repositories get
maintained properly, that releases get rolled etc. etc.

It is probably fair enough to say that both are developed by large
groups of developers/hackers, while the way in which maintenance of
source code (CVS etc), and the rolling of releases is done is very
different.  I don't think that anyone should go attacking either way as
being bad, but should just stick with the system they think is good, and
do some decent hacking, and contribute some nice code to it.

This question is again open to debate.  Some people are going to assert
that the approach taken by FreeBSD and NetBSD is more open, whereas,
others will advocate the Linux approach.

Geoff.

I came across

#define restore_flags(x) \
__asm__ __volatile__("pushl %0 ; popfl": /* no output */ :"r" (x):"memory")

I can figure out what the first two ops are and what the macro does

the "r" and the "memory"?  Where would I look to get this info?

At least not on my site. Furthermore are the debug lines appended

However its of course serious trouble that Joe user at any Linux BBS

Couldn't you use sudo?  sudo allows you to setup certain users to use
