Date: 3 Oct 1994 10:35:48 -0400



I've got a 330 meg SCSI drive and an NEC SCSI CD-ROM connected to 
an SB16 SCSI2 (at least until there's a Linux driver for the AHA2940 
that's currently sitting on my shelf waiting to become useful).  I'm
booting DOS from a 730 meg WD IDE drive on a PCI enhanced IDE controller,
and want to dedicate the SCSI drive to Linux.  I'm trying to install
Linux from the Slackware Linux Toolkit (August) CD-Rom.

I boot the install disks using the SCSI kernel and can get the system
set up & installed if I enter RAMDISK aha152x=0x140,12,7,1 at the
boot: prompt.  Everything runs smoothly; install goes fine, boot disk
created, LILO installed with the above aha152x line as an append; but
I can't boot the system except from the install disks.  When I boot LILO
(either from HD or floppy), I get LI01010101... on into infinity.  (Err..
it might be 101010, not 010101... it's whichever doesn't mean it's a CRC
error).  When I try to boot from the boot disk I created, my drives
can't be found and I never even get to a prompt.

        Yggdrasil long ago removed kermit from Plug-and-Play Linux
for this reason.  I believe that the other Linux CD makers have done

Hi everyone,

I have a problem with networking my Linux box.  I have Yddrasil Summer 94
Linux 1.1.0 #84 with NET-2 running.  I have set up my static route table with
local ip address of 128.178.10.1 and 128.178.10.2 for my Linux boxes with
netmask 255.255.255.0 and broadcast addr 128.178.10.255. The system is
on the same datalink.  My local network is 128.178.10.0.  My first
problem is "arp -a" returns nothing and when I execute "netstat -rn" I got
the error "route: unsupported address family 2560 !".  Any ideas ?  My 
ifconfig shows that my NIC card is running with arp up as configured.
Moreover, my xserver can't seem to run remote x-clients.  I keep getting
the message "can connect to calvin:0.0".  Thanks in advance for any advice.

gdb and try it within emacs.  You don't need X for emacs and it will show

Even that can be simulated with some of the development malloc's floating

Arguably.  It is however the only way to run svgalib programs as
non-root.  The problem isn't the tty permission, it's the fact that
svgalib does direct port access.  

It does however provide a call (vga_init()?) which sets everything up
and resets the uids, which is supposed to be the first line of any
svgalib program.  You can also tighten it up a bit -- one suggestion
is to make all svgalib programs group 'console' and group executable
(-rwsr-x---      1 root        console), then add only the users you 
'kind of' trust to the console group.

It's still not exactly an ideal solution, but the alternatives seem to
be to put it in the kernel (bloat...) or to make a kind of
client/server thing with one setuid process and normal user processes
communicating with it.  This has however already been done, it's called
X :-)  Does anyone have any better ideas.

In terms of the kernel, I'd say don't bother keeping up unless you're
into developing it with the other generous people who do. The kernel you
received was chosen for stability after it had been around awhile. The
more up to date a kernel is, the less certain you can be that it is
stable. But sometimes you'll want to take that risk if a newer version
supports some hardware that wasn't supported before, or if some software
requires it.

As for the new Xfree 3.1, it is apparently a major enhancement over
the previous version, and because of the way it's developed (as opposed
to the linux method), new releases of Xfree are much more likely to be
stable and safe, so I'd say, get it.

Subject: Wanted: True color pix-viewer
Date: Wed, 5 Oct 1994 09:40:00 GMT

Hello,

Since I've gotten a new video-card with a 24-bit DAC, I'd like to know
if there is any software to utilize it, that DAC I mean, with.

I am searching for picture viewers and animation viewers. The more formats
they support the better, but in any case JPG for the picture viewer and
MPEG and/or AVI for the animation viewer.

Since X doesn't allow for more than 256 colors, yet, the programs should be
able to run in textmode with help of svgalib or something. I'm forced to use 
the rather excellent DOS viewers have in the mean time. ( Display and DVPEG,
aren't they portable ? )

In case someone is interested, here's my configuration:

- i486SX-25 with 8 meg ram, no cache :( , isa bus
- Topcolor VGA card with:
        CL-GD5426 chipset
        1 meg ram
- WDC2170 harddrive, nice drive but -slow- due to my @&^#$&$^ I/O-card !
- Linux 1.0.9, Slackware release 1.2 ( If I remeber correctly  )
- XFree86 2.0
- SVGAlib which came with above mentioned Slacware release, I don't know
  the version


This may sound like a not-so-state-of-the-art software configuration, but I'm
rather new to Linux and it's said to be stable. Besides, I don't have a
tape streamer or CD-ROM drive and I'm not plannig to install 50 floppy's
or so every few weeks.

-Any- help or pointers will be appreciated greatly.

Arjan

Nope. The "i" is long and it should be pronounced "leenooks" (I hope -:).
Anyway the "u" should be pronounced like in "you".

I have just installed SB_PRO + MITSUMi_double-speed
CRrom drive + 8_ohm  unamplified SONIC speakers on my
Linux box. I hooked up the CD sound to Sb_Pro after
switching the pins.  It works, but it did not live up
to my expectations. It does not sound like 4W per
channel to me.

The manual says that when hooked up to at 8ohm
speakers, the  power drops to 2W/channel. First, I
could not make much sense out of this. It should be
just the opposite!  Second, even then it does not
sound like 2W's either.

I have not adjusted anything with the software, since
the software I use -cdplayer- is a simple command line
tool.  I turn up the volume at the back of the card to
maximum though.

Any insight is appreciated.
