It is completely correct. In fact the Linux NET3 code from about 1.1.45 up
is fractionally more efficient this way as it tests for the packet being
to the ip address of the device before doing a search of the devices to
find out if its local.

I'm wondering. If I'm running X (fvwm), Emacs with auctex, and  Latex, 
compiling a large document, top says that 8meg ram and 4 (of 12) meg swap is
used. It is not possible to use Xfig at the same time in a reasonable way. 

Have I configured something wrong?

Read your kernel before switching any jumpers! In linux/drivers/scsi/aha1542.c
there is a note that only 0x330 and 0x334 are tested (kernel 1.1.33). So try
0x334. If this is not possible due to another card sitting there, you have
to change aha1242.c and make a new kernel.

   Why would it not be enforceable?

I don't know the specific reasons; perhaps someone else could explain.
It also might only apply in the US, so it's either a question of
public policy or perhaps a first amendment restriction.

   In many articles people have said that "many lawyers consider portions
   of the GPL/LGPL unenforceable', and you counter with "Obviously, the FSF
   lawyers and others have not seen fit to test it's legality out, so it
   must be enforceable, yet in this article you present the claim the same
   accusations on the BSD copyright, which was developed by lawyers of
   Berkeley and the X Consortium.  By stating that you don't believe it to
   be enforceable, you are (IMHO) invalidating your defense of the GPL.

   If that offense/defense of the GPL/BSD copyright is invalid in one case,
   then it must be invalid in all cases if the situation is similar, which
   I believe it is.  Both groups hired lawyers to setup the clause, and the
   BSD copyright was 'sort-of' tested in the counter-suit filed by UCB against
   USL in the recent BSDI-USL copyright suit.  UCB's suit was that USL did not
   give BSD due credit where the licensing scheme required it.

   All I ask for is consistancy in your defense and accusations.

I'm sorry.  It's not the general idea of attaching conditions like
this to the copyright.  It's very specifically the "give credit in all
advertisement" clause.  This one clause is probably unenforceable,
according to the FSF's (and AT&T's, as it happens) lawyers.  

If a license said "this software may not be distributed to blacks",
that would be an unenforceable clause (on the grounds that it is
contrary to public policy) but not because attaching conditions is
bad--just because the of the specific condition.  

I don't know if public policy is the reason the credit requirement is
believed to be unenforceable; I just bring this up to explain that the
offense is not the manner in which the thing is done, but the nature
of the thing that is done.

As for UCB's suit, notice that they didn't win: under the consent
decree AT&T voluntarily agreed to give credit, but there was no hint
of a finding that they had to.

I'm using efax, its fine for sending postscript faxes, and receiving

Mgetty+Sendfax is used by many people.

Who can point me to the maintainer of the lpd package.
I am having problems in adding the ctsrts flag in the printcap file.
As the bit of that option is on the MSB of a int ( and long in 32 bits system )
I suspect that the printcap value is stored in a signed int causing it to fail
when passing it to the termio structure.

You are correct to distinguish "copyright" and "license."  But rather 
than use your definitions, I would prefer to say that a 
copyright is a form of protection applicable to certain types of subject 
matter that provides the owner of the copyright of a protected work with 
certain exclusive rights with respect to that work, subject to certain 
limitions.  And a license (in the sense applicable here) is a grant of 
authority from the copyright owner concerning the protected work 
and authorizing someone else to do something with the protected work that 
would otherwise be exclusively the right of the copyright owner to do.

However, as the smiley in my article indicated, my comment was directed 
to the remark that programmers should not be trying to draft their own 
agreements without help.

: There is already too much confusion about this fundamentally basic and

The fact that my article was in reply to a confused remark about

Chris, be sure to post your findings. I have exactly the same problem
using two old Tricomp cards. The Crynwr-driver (3C503.com) has been
installed on about all thinkable interrupts, but when I ping
the other machine (using Waterloo stuff) it gives excactly the same

Both machines work fine when DOS<->DOS or Unix<->Unix.

And yes, I too did R the FM's. I even tried to F the RM's.

O.K. I've got Mosaic for term cooking right along. I also have termtelnet
(the reason I got termtelnet is because whenever I would click on
a telnet icon in mosaic, it would bring up a window that said couldn't 
find termtelnet.) and I can telnet perfectly well from an xterm on my
local computer, through the term link to the remote computer and out.
My question is, how do I get Mosaic to call termtelnet when I click
on a telnet icon? When I do this, I get the outline of an xterm window
(I guess... It goes away before it materializes all the way) but the
window never materializes all the way. I put the following in my .Xdefaults
file:  xtermCommand /usr/local/bin/termtelnet because the Mosaic help for
XMosaic suggested it. What am I doing wrong here?

A friend of mine and I wrote a book on Linux (to appear soon). We felt
about the same as you.  Therefore we donate a dollar of every copy
sold to the free software foundation as Linus Thorwaldsen (however
important in the scheme of (linux)things) is only one of the many
people who do so much effort in writing good software and give it
away.

As for the Great Linus himself: we have to decide yet what to do and how,
but I think dutch or belgian beer will be involved somewhere.
