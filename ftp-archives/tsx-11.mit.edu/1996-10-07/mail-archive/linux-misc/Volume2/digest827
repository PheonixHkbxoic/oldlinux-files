Subject: Linux Flame Bait
Date: 24 Sep 1994 00:19:34 GMT

I was happy to read most of the recent flame bait thread about why Linux
isn't good enough for commercial use...

Although I use Linux as a hobby I must toss out my two cents worth :)

In a mostly computer illiterate(sp?) world there is something to be said for
plug and play.  Sure, it's fun to play around getting _your_ system to work,
but my advisor has grant proposals and budgets to write...  he doesn't have
the time to twiddle around.  (I guess he could make me do it :)...  which
brings me to a problem of mine.

I still use DOS/Windoze on a daily basis, just because I can't get Linux to
print on my HP Laserjet III.

Is there anyone willing to teach me something about this?  I have to say that
many casual users would be completely turned off by Linux if they couldn't get
their favorite WP (whatever they may use) to print after the first 2 minutes
of fiddeling!

Before Linux becomes too popular with the casual user it will have to have a
_little_ more plug and play built in.

If anyone can help me get my printer to printer I would be _very_ greatful!
My thesis ultimately rides on this :)  (and yes, I'm choosing to use LaTeX
over WordPerfect or Microsoft Word)

I had a DOS partition within a DOS partition created bye DOS fdisk and I decided
to change it to linux native and did that with Linux fdisk. But now I can mount
it as either ext2 or msdos ! I did mke2fs before that. I had left the old
fstab entry and upon boot it was mounted as msdos. That does not seem correct tome and may leed to fs corruption.

Subject: Help: New Problem with Ftape
Date: 26 Sep 1994 12:29:06 GMT


        I am running Linux 1.1.42, ftape 1.13b, and the 1.1 modules.
        After compiling ftape 1.13b and the latest modules without error,
        I get an excessive amount of "Single Overrun" errors and the tape
        starts and stops almost continuously. Doing an "mt erase" produces
        as much as 9 overrun errors and a tar -cv will log excessive overrun
        errors and eventually aborts. Some where between 
        Linux 1.1.31/Ftape 1.12 and Linux 1.1.42/Ftape 1.13b this overrun
        problem appeared. In the previous version of the kernel and ftape the
        tape would stream almost continuously and would not get any overrun
        errors. One of the reasons that I went to the ftape 1.13b version was
        to take advantage of the high speed controller enhancements which
        were added to this version. I really don't want to take a giant step
        backwards, because I need the fixes in the later versions. If anyone
        has had the same problem or has any ideas on how to solve the overrun
        errors, please mail directly to "ingle@erim.org" or post to this
        channel.

                                                Thanks in advance,

BE CAREFUL.  Bill hasn't mentioned what permissions to give these files,
and if you aren't careful you'll be opening up a possible security hole.

1. Make sure that the password field for ftp is '*', not empty.
   Otherwise, people will be able to telnet in as ftp with no password.
2. The copy of /etc/passwd that you put in the ftp directory should
   have '*' as the password field of every entry.
3. All files outside of ~ftp/pub should be mode 444 except ld.so and ls
   which are 555.  All should be owned by root.
4. The ~ftp/etc, ~ftp/bin, and ~ftp/lib dirs should be mode 111 and owned
   by root.
5. The ~ftp directory should be mode 555 and owned by root.
6. What you do inside pub depends on your needs.  If a directory is
   globally writable (like an Incoming directory), it is a good idea to
   set the sticky bit (eg mode 1777) so that users can't remove other
   user's files.  Also, you may not want the Incoming directory to be
   readable depending on your needs.
7. Make sure /etc/ftpusers (the main /etc, not the one in ~ftp) contains
   root, daemon, and all other accounts in the password file that don't
   contain accounts of real people.  It should not contain "ftp".

This only covers the traditional ftpd, not wu-ftpd.  I imagine that all
the above applies for wu-ftpd and more.

Just some install strangeness, which is to be expected.

I am not running it on Linux (I am on SCO, however), so I can't comment too
much on running it under Linux.  It runs great under SCO; there are some
bugs, but that's life...

The MS-"Windows" version is 1) not portable, 2) not easily revised,
3) platform specific,  4) local display only,  5) supported by more
debuggers and optimizers.

>  I'd guess that SCO WP is like molasses.

The text version flies at an incredible speed.  The Xwindows version will
be similar to the Sun version.  WordPerfect 5.1 was WordPerfect's first
attempt at X software, it is rather large and slow.... but usable.  One
must consider that WordPerfect 5.1 does a whole lot of stuff.  I know
that the new Unix WP 6.0 is larger still, but hopefully faster and
less buggy (due to their experience with X now).

Did you remember to link in the math lib? You would do that by adding
`-lm' to gcc's args, as in

        gcc frobozz.c -lm

Including it only tells the compiler what type of arguments it
expects, and what it returns.  To get the actual function, you
need to tell the linker to also search the math library
(something it does NOT do by default).

Add the -lm option to the end of the gcc command line.  This will
tell gcc to tell the linker to also search lib.m, which is the
math library.

A week ago, someone (lost the message) post on the iBCS2

An Indy runs Irix5.2 -this is one big OS-  and later and realistically 
needs _at least_ 32 megs of ram to avoid swapping itself to death with any 
big app you run. Likely the swap space isn't configured to size for your 
app either. 
A C-compiler comes with the development option, you pay extra. You'd better 
get your man pages preformatted too.
