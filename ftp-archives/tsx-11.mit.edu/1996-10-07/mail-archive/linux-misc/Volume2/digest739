I run linux on a 386SX25 with 4MB of ram, about 16MB of swap and it runs okay.
sure, it takes a goodly number of hours to recompile the kernal, but as far
as allowing me to do assignments from home in a unix environment it is great.
I actually did have X installed and although it swapped a bit more that I would
have liked it did run quite reasonably. I had to delete it tho as I needed
some more disk space.

Date: Sun, 11 Sep 1994 13:53:47 GMT

Yup, I'd say the Subject header says it all. I am looking at a PCI/VESA
local bus combo motherboard; it has 3 PCIs 3 VLBs and 2 ISAs. I have
read all the HOWTOs and monitored this group for quite a bit, but I
still have a few unresolved questions.

1) I read alot about PCI and Linux - mainly that with an (E)IDE hard disk
you will only get ISA through put. Does the Vesa, as it is extended ISA,
have better performance than PCI with IDE drives?

2) I am planning to buy an ATI GUP, or compatible Mach32. Does this unit work
in both PCI and VESA on Linux?

3) In general is it a waste to get the dual bus board (486DX2). I plan to use
Windows etc. but main concern is with Linux compatibility.  I figured that 
with the hard disk on one bus, and the video on the other, you would get
increased throughput as there would be no bus arbitration. As I under-
stand it, VESA will degrade in a linear fashion which each board installed
(the bandwidth is divided among active boards.) 

So much for theory! Would appreciate any comments and experiences (hold the
flames!)

Thanks,

I used it, at Phillips, for writing CD-I applications (I worked for 2 yrs 
for AIM, now PIMA.  The 1st demo disc in the store kiosks was mine if 
anyone saw it.)

Vaugely UNIX-like is the word.  This is not an OS9 area, so i wont go 
into details, but to call it real-time or multi-tasking is a joke.  There 
is NO way to get direct access to the interrrupts on a client level (and 
we were FORBIDDEN to write machine specific drivers by the CD-I 
specification.) The multi-tasking turns OFF every time you enter the 
kernel!  Yes, thats right, this so-called multi-tasking system has a 
non-re-entrant kernel.

In short, most of us actually programming CD-I felt OS9 was the second 
biggest CD-I mistake Philips made (the first was removing the bltters 
that were in the pre-release machines, thereby permenantly crippling its 
games ability.)  I wouldn't use the CD-I example as a selling point for 
OS9.  if you don't believe me, ask aroudn the CD-I programming 
community.  Its one of the few things we all agreed on.

>(a multitasking, modular kernel in less than 128k. You gotta be impressed

Why should I be impressed?  UNIX was orginally developed and run on 64k 
LSI-11.  And it did a whole lot more a whole lot better.

According to my math this refresh rate is 112Hz, so it whould not bother you
at all. What the xmode program 
prints out instead is the horizontal sync freq in kHz (which as you see is 
almost what you specified but not quite.)

Subject: "voice+data" without special hardware
Date: 9 Sep 1994 00:05:57 GMT

I have an idea, which I plan to implement soon unless someone writes
me saying it's already been done:

A daemon process waits around until my phone rings (this is detectable
on some/all modems). When that happens, it sends an "ats0=1" (turning
on auto-answer) to the modem, and spawns a (fax)getty on /dev/modem.

Then, 60 seconds later (if the phone has not rung again) or when the
user that dialed up logs out, whichever comes first, it turns off 
auto-answer and kills the getty. 

In case it isn't obvious why this is useful: It lets you have both a
(cheap, non data-aware) answering machine and a (cheap generic modem)
dialup/fax on the same line, without any special hardware. 

I'd appreciate to hear any comments, suggestions, or reality checks
you may have.

I'm hoping to install Linux on a drive connected to an Adaptec
2940 series SCSI-2 controller (Adaptec's PCI SCSI controller), but
there doesn't seem to be support for it anywhere yet.  I've tried the
pre-alpha 2842 boot disk, but it doesn't recognize the 2942.

Is there a driver for this controller, or is anyone working on 
one?  I'd really hate to have to move my nice fast SCSI-2 drive over
to the 1520 controller on my SB16...


While I'm at it, what are my chances of finding video drivers to run
X on my VLB Stealth 24?

I got doom for linux, pretty cool.  I have a few questions though.

1. It runs pretty choppy on my machine a DX33 with 20 meg of ram.
I am running xfree86 2.0.  I was wondering if anyone with a similar setup
got doom to run more like it does in dos?  At least movement wise (i.e. 
walking and shooting.)
2. If I register are the problems encountered in the version I have now 
corrected?  Such as pixed doubling, configurable keyboard, sound.

comment:  I have noticed that it does run better in twm and better still
in olwm than it does in fvwm.  This is unfortunate since I prefer fvwm.

Yeah, I've seen a few people post Xconfig entries for 320x200 that would 
have yielded refresh-rates of >250 Hz.  I hope people aren't blowing up 
their monitors out there.  I managed to come up with a 504x378 mode that 
works fine, and is about the best I can do while keeping my monitor under 
90 Hz, which is all it's spec'ed up to.

I also have a 360x270 mode that should work, but it needs a 12 or 12.5 
MHz dot clock.  My video card's manual says that it has 12.5 MHz dot 
clock that it uses for VGA 320x200 mode, but XFree86 2.1 doesn't find 
that clock when it does the probe.  The lowest one it finds is 25 MHz.  
Does anyone know a way to convince the X server to use a dot clock other 
than one it finds in the probe it does at startup?

(I added c.w.x.i386unix to the newsgroup line, and set followups back 
to c.o.l.misc.  For those just joining this thread, lots of people are 
looking for very low res X setups in order to run the recently released 
DOOM port for Linux.  I'm running XFree86 2.1 on Linux 1.0, with a Cirrus 
Logic CLGD 5426-based adapter (the MVGA-AVGA3VL) driving a CTX CMS-1561

Subject: Re: Which is the best Linux CD package? Of 2, Trans-Am...
Date: Sun, 11 Sep 1994 03:43:38 GMT

Well, my $.02:

I've used these 2:

     Yggdrasil Summer '94
      TransAmeritech vol 2 January 1994

Both were under $50, both have "live" versions so you can run part/all of 
Linux from the CD (bloody slow, I'm sure), both were fully featured

HOWEVER:  If I had to buy again, I'd get the TransAmeritech.  A downfall of 
their's is they haven't really updated their CD since we bought it (or we'd 
have bought the newer one again instead of Yggdrasil) put the 
"latest/greatest" stable kernel on, but then again, neither did Yggdrasil...  
I had to upgrade to 1.1.45 anyhow, 'cause I needed to use a 1.6 gig IDE.

Yggdrasil, while having a lot of nicities, was hardly the "Plug n play" that 
it claimed to be.  Trans-Ameritech went in first try as it was supposed to, 
and everything worked (including Email!)  The Yggdrasil summer disk had a pink 
leaflet (crammed in the back of the book by the time I found it) that 
described a bug in the install.  I fell for this bug twice before the leaflet 
fell out of the book.

Another problem:  I am using this on a machine with the ATI Mach 64, and I 
knew I'd need the alpha X server before running X.  From my trans-ameritech 
experience, I figured I'd hop on the net and bring it down.  NOPE; the only 
ways to set up the network are under X and by hand.  THIS SUCKS, especially 
when running under X is impossible.

SO, in trying to set up the net by hand, I learned this virtue: Yggdrasil puts 
files in weird places, and files are set up piecemeal--kinda sloppy.  This 
made it f**king difficult. I couldn't even look at another Unix box and say, 
"Oh, that's where xxx is"  What a pain in the ass.

And now, I'm still struggling to get smail going. TA's stuff worked right 
after the install and netconfig (a sh-based SHELL SCRIPT) (the smail log shows 
all stuff that goes off the machine as "via: yggdrasil" I've investigated 
routers.inet, but can't seem to make it work--anyone who knows the answer and 
can pass it on, E-mail me!)

So, that's why.  My next CD-based Linux will probably be Trans-Am, or very 
certainly not Yggdrasil anyway...

     Also I have weird problem between modem and mouse.. I have a superio card
( WINBOND ) with 2 16550a serial ports.. Under kernel 1.0.9, modem and mouse
can work together.. But under kernel 1.1.* , the mouse dies whenever a modem
connection is established.. I have modem on port 1 and mouse on port 2.. If I
switch the ports ( modem on port 2 , mouse on port 1 ), then the mouse dies
whenever modem is ** turned on **.. The same situation happens under dos..
I am confused whether this is a OS problem or a SuperIO card problem.. I am
thinking of buying another serial card for my mouse if it will solve this
problem.. Any idea, clue, suggestion is much apprciated..
      Thanks a lot..
