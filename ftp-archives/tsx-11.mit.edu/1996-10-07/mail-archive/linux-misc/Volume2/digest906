Has anyone be able to hook their modem up so that you can dail into linux?

The people on #linux suggested agetty, and mgetty. But I didn't get to far
with those to commands. Could somebody who as done this explain how or at

I'm not goping to flame you back, because I have some problems myself 
with the 'version .0 always has bugs' view.  (I really don't know enough 
about GNU history to have a very intelligent view on this, just a feelign 
that the only products I've ever seen where this was literraly true were 
all made by Microsoft.)

On your subejct of 'come on and help us develop' though, i wanted to make 
you aware of anothre side.  Myself, I would love to do some Linux kernel 
hacking, but i don't because I work 40+ hours a week programming for a 
living, which only leaves a small amoutn of time (after the chunkc other 
responsabilities take out) to work on my own projects.  Given that, at 
the moment, other projects interest me more.  As fasr GCC goes, I'm happy 
I have it, Ill be happy to report bugs, but i don't mhave the time to do 
development on it as well.  If that were really necessary, Ild go buy a 
commercial compiler. Luckily, I haven't found that to be the case.

Just my nickle's worth,
(Used to be 2 cents, before Reganomics ;)  )

I saw a book in one of our technical bookstores the other day called 
"Unix for Dos and Windows Users" or something similar.
Thsi is not an endorsement, i didn't need it so I didn't even crack it, 
but i thought you might liek to know its there.

In general, there are alot of VERY good books now on using UNIX.  You 
basicly can't go wrong with one from the ORiely Nutshell series (just be 
sure the one you buy is on your level since they range everywhere from 
basic beginner stuff to complex programmer's subjects).

Just because Linux was free (or virtually) doesn't mean taht you can't or 
shouldn't spend the money on a few good books.  Many of the simpler 
questions I've seen float by here coudl be answered by such references.

I would STRONGLY advise anyone who is seriosu about running Linux to put 
aside a 'book budget'. (After all, you just saved $60.00 at least over 
the cost of Windows or OS/2, right?  That'll buy you one or two good 
books right there...  ;)  )

Well, I must say, congrats to the DOSEMU team.  I have yet to run into 
something DOSEMU could not do, other than run Protected mode software.  
(I am at version 0.52, but I understand that the latest patchlevels of
0.53 are supporting even Doom!)  

Today, I was so convinced that I was in a true DOS session (I didn't 
bother to switch VT's), that I decided to run Optune.  (Mind you, I 
generally leave my box in Linux, 24hrs a day, 7 days a week, but I 
had rebooted to try out the System Shock demo.)  Well, I realized long
after I had started the optimization that I was in linux.  Well, at
first I freaked out.  "Oh my god, did I just swiss cheese my drive?"

I exited the dos emulator, unmounted my DOS partition and prayed.  
I ran dosemu again, and lo and behold, my drive was 100% intact!!!!
Congratulations, DOSEMU Team!  Even DISK OPTIMIZERS seem to work
OK under DOSEMU.  But, I wouldn't try this at home.... :-)

Well, the only thing I didn't add was 1.1.51 for the kernel.  While
nothing is locking up, there is a lag while telnetting with an FTP
session going on that is annoying.  I've received a patch that I
hope to be able to roll in this weekend and do some serious testing.
Other things that run are Sendmail+IDA as a daemon, xntpd, and
CERN's web server.  The ftp session definitely takes over the system.

I did :-) 

It is no real problem, you can keep both compilers and decide which one
to use with -V2.5.8 or -V2.6.0

I really like 2.6.0 for my c++ programs, it gives /much/ better error-
messages, but the performance seems to be less good than 2.5.8, 
2.6.0 takes more memory at compiletime, and the executable seems to be
slower when it does a lot of numbercrunching...

Sometimes the compiler fails and I have to use 2.5.8, but most of the
time it works well.

I am not experienced enough to pinpoint the problems I had well enough to 
file a bugreport for the gcc-developers, though. But of course I will 
test the gcc 2.6.0 and any newer version :-)

Cheers, Michael Will
PS: Running kernel 1.1.52 compiled with gcc 2.6.0 and still no problems :-)

Yes. It emulates termcap via terminfo. You have to link with ncurses

I guess so. The makefile offers an option to link curses.h to ncurses.h.

Hi to all,

I am really a new user to the Linux system. Comming from the MS
windows end, and trying out the real operating end of the spectrum. I
love this multitasking stuff, but I have a slight problem. I can't seem
to get the printer to work just right. I am using the Fall version of
Yggdrasil, and love it. It loaded right up with not problems at all. The
boot section shows that I have my printer on lp1, using the spooler, and
when I try to print something, the print light comes on but nothing
happens. So I issure the command again, and when it does print it is all
of just three lines that look like this:

#
#Entries have this format:
#
#Machine-Name Time Type Class Phone Login
#

and so on. Can anyone tell me what I need to do to correct this problem?
I sure would appreciate it. Also I have seen on here about this
compiling the kernel. What is this. Like I said I am new to this stuff.
I can't even get my clock set right. HELP HELP HELP.. And Dos where is
the Dos stuff that I am suppose to be able to get to. I can't even get
around this stuff let alone get to the Dos side of. I really like the
OS, but I think I need some learning.
