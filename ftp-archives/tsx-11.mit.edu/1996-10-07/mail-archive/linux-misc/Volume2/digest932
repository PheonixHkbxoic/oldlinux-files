Subject: NCR53c810 Driver FAQ?
Date: 13 Oct 1994 14:33:32 GMT

Hello Linux Users,
      I have a new Pentium system in the mail, whose only hard drive interface
is SCSI, based on the 53c810 NCR chip.  As I'd like to make sure Linux works
on it before the MBG expires, I'd like to know how to install some form of
the linux kernel.

      I checked the driver site at tsx-11.mit.edu, but couldn't find any
readmes or anything.  The closest I came was the following, from the SCSI
HOWTO:

Section 3.11 : NCR53c810 (ALPHA)
ALPHA available from tsx-11.mit.edu : /pub/linux/ALPHA/scsi
    ncr_src.2.tar.gz    - patches against 1.1.19
    ncr_kern.2.gz       - kernel, dd to disk and use rdev
    ncr_slack.2.gz      - Slackware boot disk, dd to disk and
                            install slackware

      Since I'm borrowing my friend's slackware CD, it would seem logical to
simply download the boot disk.  However, I remember hearing somewhere that it
is really a two disk set, but only one is shown at the FTP site.  Any ideas
how I could get this running asap?

      Many thankyous!

-Chris

Subject: mpeg_play 2.0.1:  Motif :(  Binary?
Date: 10 Oct 1994 03:26:09 GMT

Version 2.0.1 of mpeg_play has introduced a Motif user interface.
(2.0 just opens a window and plays the animation).

It is my understanding that this means I need to buy Motif libraries
in order to compile the program, or find a pre-compiled, statically
linked binary copy of the executable.

Are there any other options?  (free sub-motif library I could try?)

Ah I understand now.  You are saying that threads under MVS behave like 
the light-weight tasks mentioned earlier, thus supporting the contention 
that such behavior (or lack thereof) is an implementation detail, not 
part of the definition of a thread.

Okay, now that I understand, thanks for the support and I'm sorry if I 
sounded snotty in my last post, I was honestly just confused.

rec.games.computer.doom.help    DOOM Help Service (new players welcome).
rec.games.computer.doom.misc    Talking about DOOM and id Software.

Votes must be received by 23:59:59 UTC, 3 November 1994.

This vote is being conducted by a neutral third party.  For voting
questions only contact rdippold@qualcomm.com.  For questions about the
proposed groups contact John Van Essen <vanes002@maroon.tc.umn.edu>.


PURPOSE

The rec.games.computer.doom hierarchy is for discussing various topics 
relating to the popular action-oriented computer game DOOM, written by
id Software, and its sequels and user-written add-ons.  It would also 
consolidate DOOM-related discussion currently underway in other 
newsgroups.  It is intended for world-wide distribution.

This proposal also establishes a new rec.games.computer newsgroup 
subhierarchy for games that run on general-purpose computers.


CHARTERS
========

rec.games.computer.doom.announce    Info/FAQs/reviews about DOOM. (Moderated)

  The sort of postings likely to be to be approved by the moderator are 
  general announcements that are interesting to the broad spectrum of DOOM 
  players.  Examples of these types of articles are:

   - Anything from id Software
   - New PWAD and LMP announcements
   - Announcements of new versions of utilities like DEU and DEHACKED
   - Tourney announcements
   - FTP site news (downtime, user limits, etc)
   - FAQs and similarly informative documents
   - Reviews of user-written PWADs

  The current moderator of alt.games.doom.announce, Tony Lezard, says that
  he'd be happy to moderate this newsgroup using the current addresses:

    Submit:  doom@mantis.co.uk
    Contact: doom-request@mantis.co.uk (Tony Lezard)

  This newsgroup replaces alt.games.doom.announce.

rec.games.computer.doom.help        DOOM Help Service (new players welcome).

  This unmoderated newsgroup is the headquarters of the DOOM Help Service.
  Readers new to USENET or to DOOM who post questions here will receive a
  flame-free friendly response from experienced USENETters and DOOM players.
  Game setup, hardware problems, modem/network setup, secrets, cheats, how
  to get DOOM and related utilities are a few examples of suitable topics.

  Questions about modifying/editing levels belong in the .editing group.

  This newsgroup replaces alt.games.doom.newplayers.

rec.games.computer.doom.misc        Talking about DOOM and id Software.

  Here is where discussion occurs about non-play-related issues that
  aren't suitable (or only marginally so) for the other subgroups.
  Examples are FTP issues, ports of DOOM to other systems, piracy,
  "DOOM - the Movie", DOOM II vs. DOOM, what's the best soundcard, 
  DOOM-related ads, comparisons with other games, magazine articles, 
  people at id and their cars, future id plans (Quake).  In general, 
  if it isn't about actually playing or editing DOOM, post it here.    

rec.games.computer.doom.editing     Editing and hacking DOOM-related files.

  Discussion here covers modifying the DOOM environment, especially the
  EXE and WAD files.  There are many user-written utilities available that  
  do these types of things.  Some authors and experienced users can answer
  questions about design techniques and using the utilities.  Examples of
  topics are effects of design error (HOM, Medusa), design problems in 
  user-written PWADs, modifying default DOOM behavior, utility enhancements.

  Comments or questions about playing user-written PWADs (opinions, keys, 
  secrets, etc.) should not be posted here - post in .playing instead.

rec.games.computer.doom.playing     Playing DOOM and user-created levels.

  Discussion about playing DOOM takes place here (not only about playing
  id's original levels, but also about playing user-written PWADs).
  Topics include how to find secrets, keyboard/mouse movement techniques, 
  side-effects of playing DOOM, where to find good PWADS (and which ones 
  are favorites), deathmatch experiences, and so forth.

  Tournament discussions and multi-player topics can go here, too.

  PWAD upload notices can be posted here when not posted in .announce.

  Non-play-related topics belong in the .misc group (this includes Quake).

Date: Wed, 12 Oct 1994 12:48:24 GMT

Currently the Linux FAQ is posted only to comp.os.linux.announce and
col.help.

I'm considering expanding that to include the other groups in the
hierarchy.  Does anyone have any comments to make about this ?

What has prompted me to consider this issue is the following message
from Prodigy, posted to the faq-maintainers list:

Well, its not quite as easy, but there are some example scripts to
help you.  If you want to run PPP, I'd recommended picking up the
ppp2.1.2a package from sunsite (I think you'll find it under
/pub/Linux/system/Network/serial)  It contains the pppd daemon
(manages the connection), chat (a program to automate login) and some
example scripts.

Good luck!

My first Linux installation was on a 386/sx20 with 2 Meg and 40 Meg of hard
drive space devoted to Linux.  This was with H.J. Lu's mini distribution a
long time ago (prior to version 0.99) and I impressed the local sysadmin 
with the speed, but that was compared to a VAX 8200 running Ultrix 4.2 that
took 12 hours to do the first stage compile of GCC 2.4.x with only two
users on the system.  My Linux box was very useful to me since I was taking
a C/Unix class at the time and didn't like the slow response of the VAX.

Ultrix was frozen on the 4.2 release fairly early in the game, and
then a whole bunch of strange DEC stuff (MOP, LAT, RIS, DecNET, and
that strange fs@host notation they use for NFS) got grafted on.
Meantime, Sun at least waited for 4.3 Tahoe before the divergences got
to be noticeable.

(I was there for all of this, admin'ing a mixed Ultrix/SunOS shop with
vax and sun servers + vax, decstation, sun3, and sun4 clients.  Way
fun.)

To parody a famous un*x pronunciamento, SunOS 3.5 was an improvement
on both its predecessors and successors.  Ditto Ultrix 2.3 (mostly).

Have you ever tried to work on one of these entry level workstations?
They're severely underconfigured, especially as far as disks and memory
are concerned, which means that they swap madly when you try to do
anything. And a system with a 260 MB disk can be used only in a network,
where almost everything is stored on a remote file server. You can't fit
the full OS and a decent swap partition on such a disk, don't even think
of users home directories.  The graphics hardware (adaptor and monitor)
usually sucks, too.

When you start considering adding another 16 MB RAM (a must) a decent
disk and a better display (if you want better resolution you usually
have to add some video memory, too), you find out that the price of the
system has doubled (at least).

Compare this with a pretty well configured PC, that works like a 
charm with a nice OS. I won't hesitate a single moment if I had to make
a choice between a PC and a workstation having the same price. The 
workstation could be a winner only if all you have to do is number
crunching. But even in this field, a P90 system beats most entry level
workstations (especially Sun's):

MACHINES               MHz SPECint92 SPECfp92

SUN/SPARC/5/70         70  57        47.3

SGI/INDY/R4000SC      100  57.5      63

: I'd be excited, closer to ecstatic.

Sharing with windows is simple. The process I use is to create a
appropriately sized DOS partition and create a DOS filesystem on it. Save
the first sectors (root directory and partition table) to a file. I activate
this partition as linux swap partition when booting linux and restore the
file to the partition when shutting down. For some strange reason this gives
me a DOS filesystem with a corrupted FAT. I then use debug in my
autoexec.bat to restore the rootdir and FAT once more. (The linux based
restoration is necessary because DOS debug does not like to write to a
partition without a file system). For windows it does not matter that the
content of the swapfile is lost. This file is remade at each windows boot. I
would assume that sharing with OS2 could function in a similar way, but if
you have to coordinate between 3 different OS it might get complicated.
