Hi all,

I am considering installing Linux on my PC at home and have had no prior 
experience with it.  A major factor in deciding to go ahead, would be the 
availibility of an implementation of POSIX threads for Linux.

Can someone can point me in the direction of a site that contains POSIX threads
for Linux so that I can investigate further?

Thanks in advance.

Let's not forget that large headed people will hear a definite lag due to the 
extra length of their auditory system.  You wouldn't believe how long it can 
take sound to get through the ears of extremely large headed people!  Even  
normal headed people with large ears are having SFX lag time problems.  Why, 
Ross Perot gave up DOOM because it took a week for the sounds to find their 
through his ears.

   ...
      I would like to know how I can create a Slackware boot disk (the one used
      to install Linux from scratch) and install a kernel of my choice...

      Why? So I can make use of an alpha network driver to perform an NFS install
      and save copying 100+ MB of Slackware 2.0 on to floppies :-)

      I've formatted a diskette with "fdformat", 
      added my kernel with "dd if=/zImage of=/dev/fd0", 
      created a ramdisk with "rdev -r /dev/fd0 1440", 
      and changed the root file system with "rdev /dev/fd0 /dev/ram" (I think :-)

      The bit I can't work out is how to tweak it so it asks for the ROOT disk, 
      and copies that filesystem to the ramdisk, after the kernel has loaded...

   Done the same thing execept that I did  "rdev /dev/fd0 /dev/fd0".
   After boot the system ask for the  root diskette, but when I insert it
   I get errormessages like 'IO-error on /dev/fd0' and 'could not read
   masterblock'. 

It turned out that just using the available 'make zdisk' for the
kernel did the job of adjusting the kernel to handle the floppy root.
remember to adjust the ROOT_DEV in the Makefile or manually run the
commands. (Thanks to Per Arne Moi).

I am however still not able to make the kernel load the ramdisk from
the root-disk :

I did 'rdev -r /dev/fd0 1440'.

I beg to differ- it flies under MS-"DOS" here on a 486 33 DX with an ISA
16 bit Orchid Prodesiger II ET4000, 16MB RAM.  Under Linux it crawls at
about 1 frame every two seconds.  I don't think the requirement for
faster video cards is a joke.

Linux is DOS.   DOS stands only for "Disk Operating System".  Most all

Yep.  Only one modification, the electrons only generally make progress
moving in one direction if the current is DC; if it is AC, they don't 
make all that much progress before being shoved the other way :)

Modifying the length of the cable will have an effect, although unnoticable.
Thickening the cable will reduce resistance, but not effect speed.

Now back to humor!

The window manager SHOULD not make any difference as long as you are not
moving/resising the window or moving the cursor.... etc.

The only thing it SHOULD effect is memory usage.  (Note the SHOULD's).

But X is the real world of Unix.  No other X86 Unix uses "SVGALIB"....
And since is is X, it can be run remotely, client/server, standalone,
over modem, on Xterminals, with other applications on the screen, etc.

Although, more options are better than fewer.  Since the X version is a
reality, I would see nothing wrong with a SVGALIB version too (I opposed
it at first, since I thought that the SVGALIB version would reduce or
eliminate the need for an X version).

I hope Rene (the first poster) meant a tongue-in-cheek joke.  I can't imagine
what 386-40 running linuxxdoom is like.  My current 486-25/75 with 16Mhz ISA 
(Stealth24) runs the dos version of doom about three times as fast my
old 386-40 using the same card (on 10MHz ISA).  Running linuxxdoom with the
486-75, I can get smooth motion only at third smallest (yeah, now we are counting
from innermost out, instead of from full-screen and inward) screen setting;
even that's not what I'd call snappy either.  Though I have setup 320x240
Xserver resolution, I probably won't spend much time there.  I can only
hope that things will be slightly better when I get the 864-based vlb card
to work with Xf86.  But I think the long term solution probably lies with some
kind of graphics accelearation (filled polygon and etc, too bad X doesn't
specify shaded polygon); dumping pixmaps on Xserver probably 
is not the way for X-based games.

I'm not ranting against the port;  it was an admirable effort.  Maybe I'm just
spoiled by doom on Indigo.

I purchase the Yggdrasill Fall release yesterday and can't get it to install 
corectly or for that matter it will not even run from the CD.  It boots fine 
but when you do an ls at root there are no directories.  The install seems to 
go extremely fast less than 5 min.  As it is installing files it only copys a 
few things to a /home DIR and the /DEV dir. It also creates and copys files to 
a dir called SBIN.  Butt once I login as root there are a few file there and no 
directories at all either on the HD or CD.

I do see some sort of error fly by as it boots, somthing about UNTMP, Also it 
keeps reseting the CMOS clock and then its done.  I do not see it initialize 
any daemons like in the previous release.

I am not using a swap partition or home partition.  I have 32megs of ram and a 
dedicated 420mb HD for linux.  I'm using OS2's boot manager and have set the 
partition to type 83.

I tend to think that it must not like something on my system due to the fact 
that I can boot from the disk and run it from the CD and get the exact same 
results.  Yggdrasil if your out there...  HELP...

Personally, I would suggest getting the Slackware "a" series and using
that as a base.  No, It doesn't have gcc, emacs, XFree, but you can add
those independently.  The "a" series does a lot of things right that
are a little hard to clean up, or realize are wrong, until after it's
too late.  You would pick up five disk images:  boot, root, a1, a2, a3.
You have to know vi to work with these, until you find and load the
editor of your choice.  If you are on the net, I guess you would then
add the net series - three more floppies worth - so you can bootstrap
yourself from the new installation.

When you go looking for programs, all the gnu software is on prep.ai.mit.edu
and many mirrors - ftp.cdrom.com is a good one for me, YMWV.  Unless you
are compulsive about this stuff, you are better off cruising sunsite.unc.edu
or tsx-11.mit.edu (or mirrors) for _binaries_ of several key packages:
libc, gcc, XFree.  Once you have this (or the Slackware "d" development
series) as a base, you can get and build applications from _sources_.
This can be educational and productive.  Finally, there are some key
_packages_ (source and binary) available specific to Linux - e2fs progs,
util-linux, network utilities, etc.  Get the README's and have fun!

Concur.  In fact, I found it faster to run linuxxdoom as remote xclient
on a DX2-66 and display on my 486-25/75 than run it directly on my machine;
even faster if the client/server relation is reversed;  probably due to
that the DX2-66 has vlb graphics, mine only ISA albeit at 16MHz (no renewed
discussion on risks of overclocking ISA please).  BTW, when running the xclient
on the 486-25/75 (regardless of where the xserver is), I get better 
results by reducing physical memory from 24meg to 16meg; of course, I put
the 8meg back in immediately after the experimentation, no desire to 
reduce memory just to make linuxxdoom faster.
