I'm running it on a 486/66 with the XFree86 Beta P9000 server (which
does no real acceleration and just acts as a linear local bus frame
buffer).  In this configuration, I get performance that is signifcantly
better than the same thing on an SGI Indy.  There seems to be a byte
ordering problem with pixel doubling, tripling, and quadrupling which
scrambles the image.  Otherwise those would be decently fast as well.

I've also tried it with the 320x200x8 VGA server that will be part of
XF86_SVGA in XFree86 3.1.  The performance here is quite impressive
(not noticably slower than DOS).  A neat trick that works for me is to
run the XF86_SVGA X server as display :1.0 (320x200) and run my
XF86_P9000 server as :0.0 in 1024x768 and then just VT switch (and
swap like crazy) between the two.

I hope David Taylor will have a little bit of time to fix the byte
ordering problems in pixel scaling.....  :-)  I don't know what their
deal is with not making money off Linux.  I'd never buy a DOS game
because I go to DOS so little, but I would be very tempted to buy
registered Doom or Doom II for Linux.  


On a related topic (which is probably my fault):
I've also been trying to get sound to work with Linux Doom and
my PAS16.  I'm using the sound drivers from the 1.1.50 kernel.
There's a great deal of static along with the sound.  The kernel
also returns errors like:

Sep 10 01:56:46 foundation kernel: Sound: DMA timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error?

After a few seconds, sound stops entirely.  This is strange since
sound works with everything else under Linux except doom.  (I've used
things like s3mod and other sound players without problems).  I've
messed with IRQ's and DMA's but haven't had any success.
Any ideas?

Thanks,
Erik

The 320x200 mode that is being referred to is a new 320x200x8 VGA
server that will be included in XFree86 3.1.  It may not be possible
to get this resolution with other servers (I may be wrong here) and
guessing can damage many monitors.

: Also I can't figure out how to use the VGA mode instead, of the x

It is X only....  There is no mode that uses svgalib.

You will be happy to know that my Linux system has an SB AWE32 with the

Infomagic do offer one of the best price/performance Linux CD's being their
$20 two CD set.  Their June release had a live kernal on the CD, but does
not run X windows.  Infomagic is out of stock of their June release, as are
most of their resellers (including ourselves) but are taking orders for
their upcoming September release that should be available by the end of
September.

Yggdrasil's package not only runs Linux and X windows but has a bunch of
other utilities and programs that will run from the CD including the C
compiler.  Yggdrasil's list price was $39.95 but I understand their next
release, due out shortly, will be about $35.

Infomagic also resells the Slackware Professional 2.0 Linux Package from
Morse.  The "list price" on this is $49.95 
It includes some additional installation features that make it very easy to
install, as well as the ability to run Linux including X windows from the CD.
Slackware Professional package is the "official" release of Patrick
Volkerding's Slackware distribution and includes Matt Welsh's Linux
Installation and Getting Started Guide.

Cheers,  Bob.

Wrong. The implementers of Linux actively decided to use FSF-produced
tools which fall under the GPL and also decided to place the (majority
of) the kernel under the GPL. The FSF really didn't have any say in
the matter (and certainly your statement that "they've already done

This is so profs can keep up with it.  DOS crap is easy to find and 
use--commonplace.  Save the real OSs for upperclassmen (who will gain wisdom 
from going from DOS to a real OS like Unix)

Well, you can't expect a University full of professors, each with so many 
students, to all know everything...  Again, you get to the upperclassmen and 
grads, and the students can specialize (by then, they should have glommed on 
to someone on the faculty who can *teach* them what they want to learn).

Hell, to support this, look at O'Reilley & Associates.  Armed with troff and 
rcs and some other Un*x tools that escape me, they can write, edit, and 
typeset entire books!  That's productive...


>that Macs are unproductive.

for learning anything about computers!  I think Un*x teaches one the most, DOS 
is a runner up, maybe.  OS/2 just blows chunks, requiring you to know all 
about OS/2 but in the process teaches you nothing about any other computers 
(kinda like the macs in that respect).

Unix makes sense.  stdin, stdout  things built in highly powerful little 
programs, each able to string into the next.  This is wonderfully powerful and 
flexible for the ingeneous user...  The initial learnig curve is a bit steep, 
but even the completely uninitiated can do it.  Fear of the   %  is the 
biggest hurdle.

OS/2 was problematic for us; I couldn't use too much of my knowledge of 
Windows, DOS, Unix, or X/MWM when I tried to figure out OS/2 (the CONFIG.SYS 
from hell! for instance)  OS/2 users, like mac users, have fewer intutive 
skills to use than do DOS/Un*x users.  If your boss says "We're using X" 
telling him that you'd rather use a Mac or OS/2 isn't going to earn you 
brownie points...

>else (for programming, the TA should be able to get the source code
>and recompile it though).  They can write their reports in whatever

Yeah, sure.  pile the work on the poor TA...  take some 3 hr classes, 
work on a thesis, grade these papers and hey!  If some upstart can'g give you 
readily executable code, hell just muck around compiling it!  You've got 
the time!  This gets back to standardization--DOS is a good least common 
denomonator;  you can go GUI or command-line and still hand in something 
that's readily usable and understanable to the masses!  I agree with the 
thesis that Unix is the way, but not neccisarily to the ends you suggest...

There's something to be said for doing what your told the way your told to do 
it.  If it involves yucky old DOS, so be it.  When youre done, you might just 
have learned something--how to effectively contrast what you *did* with what 
you "moved up" to and why that was a move up.

512 K is *spoiled*, pal.  I used to see some really decent stuff on the old 
C-64s (for the time).  And, back to the Trash-80 era, 4 K was once "roomy."
I know someone who (still!) won't give up his 16K CoCo3 (I presume by now hes

The lack of really good *games* is what keeps people from Unix.  The rest of

Horse hockey!  Only 'cause it's fad.  Look in the tech writing journals, and

sure you can.  You just have more to fool with, and in smaller bits...  When 
you're sick and tired of foolin', you'll sit down and learn something (Take a

Well, there is something to be said for learning by expoloration, but there

The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

Subject: new machine to linux or not?!?!?!?!
Date: Fri, 09 Sep 94 13:16:10 EDT

        Hey every one, um I d'no if this is good topic but on my new 
66mhz machine with 540 hard disk I would like to install some thing 
better than DOS and Windows.  I will of course get OS/2 to run all of my 
DOS applications.  But what programs are out there for Linux to run on a 
read PC(very personal computer, no networking other than a modem used 
once a weak to read usenet off a not so unix BBS.)  Or better yet, I 
should say I'll have a partition of 100 meg and use a disk doubler(dos) 
and another 200 some for the os/2 partition, but DO I realy want to use 
up 100 megs to get Linux?(Of course I want Gnu C and Xffree.. I may even 
get two copies of C one for OS/2 and one for the Linux.) 

        Oh.. back to the original question.  Why Linux, can some one 
convince me that Linux has the software(games, wordprocessing...free 
ofcourse)  to suport it? Other than that I love a Un*x type OS, as a 
matter of fact I am even going to make my OS/2 look and feel like 
Linux(hm.....)
