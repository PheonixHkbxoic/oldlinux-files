        My, this is going rather far. As it turns out the total paved
road in Greenland is about several miles, from the (ex-)air base at
Sondrestrom Fjord down to the ship offloading point (around and then
down the runway, that's it). The better bets on transportation are helos 
(rotten weather permitting), pooches, or feet. Ferrari's would barely rev 
up in first gear before stopping, but zooming across the pack ice would
be exciting indeed. I doubt that many Italians would be present to check
on the validity of the vehicle beneath the Ferrari name plate.
        While the above is certainly not a Unix topic it's no farther 
away than the top paragraph. Maybe the thread should now close quietly.

In the latest edition of the Linux journal, there was a letter from
Linus about an imminent code freeze in preparation for a new release
(I believe 1.2). The letter was dated July 30. It's now nearly 2 months
later and I haven't seen or heard any talk about this upcoming code
freeze and new release. 

Any ideas when it can be expected? What still has to happen before
Linus give the official "freeze" command?

Hello,

I was wondering if someone could reccomend a CD-ROM drive for use
with Linux.  I also want to use this drive under MS-DOS and OS/2.
I'm looking for a 3x or 4x speed w/ a SCSI-2 interface.  It will be
used w/ a SoundBlaster 16 w/ SCSI-2 interface.

I haven't taken a look at CD-ROM driver support under Linux, so
I have no idea what types of CD-ROM drives I should or should not
be considering. TIA.

You're Welcome.

I had the same problem with the SlackWare 2.0 CD-ROM and a Mitsumi Double-
Speed on an SB16.  First of all, if you are making your own boot disks to
suit the hardware on your system, then don't use the SoundBlaster boot
disk; use the Mitsumi boot disk.  (I don't even know if you have to create
boot disks from images on the Yggdrasil CD, but that's what I did for Slack-
Ware.  I'm just telling you what I know.)  Then, when you boot the floppy,
at the "LILO boot:" prompt, specify the boot image to use followed by 
"mcd=0x230,11". 

Example:

        LILO boot: bootimage mcd=0x230,11

NOTE: The "bootimage" above should be substituted with the name of the 
default boot image (the one listed first when you hit Tab).

I use a MCD on a SB16.  The base I/O address and IRQ were different than
the SlackWare mitsumi boot floppy's settings.  I had to specify the kernel
parameter "mcd=0x340,11" at the "LILO boot:" prompt.  Then I went into
/usr/src/linux/include/linux, and made a copy of mcd.h to mcd.h-sb16.  I
then editted the address and IRQ in mcd.h-sb16 and copied mcd.h-sb16 to
mcd.h.

I hope you can understand that.  You need to practice your English grammar,
but I know how hard it can be to practice on something that is important.
Sorry.

I use the mgetty+sendfax from G. Doehring(?) and I'm pretty happy with it.
It's a replacment for the getty too, and works fine with incoming and
outgoing fax&data. And it supports the courier V.Everthing!

I know that DOS filesystem is visible from Linux (when you run Linux)
(you can access un-stackered DOS partition or use DOSemu to access the
stacked partition.)

On the other hand, how can I access Linux files when I run MSDOS?
For example, how can I copy a file from Linux partition to DOS or vice
verse? (I do not mean to excute linux binaries).

Heatsink _grease_ is white goo that goes between the chip package and
the heatsink.  Proper use of heatsink grease makes a big difference in
the actual chip temperature, since without it the thermal contact
between the rough ceramic package surface and the flat metal heatsink
is rather poor.  Highly recommended - this is what I mused about Royal
learning about (or not).

Heatsink _glue_ is used to atttach cheaper heatsinks directly
to the chip, without any clips/bolts/whatever to otherwise hold
the heatsink on.  You see this technology used on IBM-SLC motherboards.
This stuff is totally inappropriate for add-on use, and presumably
_would_ void the Intel warranty.

My use of the word _compound_ was (at best) ambiguous.  Sorry for
any confusion.

Yes, I have read the FAQ.  The Faqqin' FAQ just tells me to add cache as 
I add memory, and to make sure all my memory is being cached.
(Sorry, I just get pissed when people say 'read the FAQ'  :)   
I think I got that off my chest now.)

What I wanted to know is why Linux slows down with more memory/no more
cache, while MS Windows doesn't appear to suffer a bit.

I have already had several people reply to me, and have heard a few
plausible explainations.  I will summarize my findings and ask some more
questions.

First off, some PC's (I think the ones with ISA architecture) cannot
address more than 16 meg (without special software, anyhow).  This is
given as the reason linux slows down with >16 meg installed.

Someone told me that MS Windows does not take advantage of any memory
over 16 meg.  First, can anyone else confirm this?  Secondly, this 
would explain why MS Windows doesn't slow down with more memory.

Now, this would suggest that Linux should *not* slow down as memory
is added SO LONG AS TOTAL MEMORY IS NO MORE THAN 16 MEG, and all of
the memory is being cached regardless of the cache size.  Sure, with
more cache there should be an improvement, but after an initial 64k,
there is decreasing returns on the investment.  Can anyone support 
this statement by telling me about a system they have in which they
have added memory and not cache and experienced no (or little) 
performance drop?  Or can someone refute this?

Lastly, I have seen some posts where people have added memory, with
total memory *not* going above 16meg, and have experienced a 
performance drop.  I would like to hear from any people with this
experience, and hopefully we can find out why this is happening.  I
imagine it is usually caused by the cache not caching all of main
memory, whether due to incorrect BIOS setup, wrong jumper settings
on motherboard, or poorly-designed cacheing controllers.

I'd like to see this Linux memory slowdown problem solved!
Thanks for helping me!

I use the more complicated route of doing "runq" every five minuites

you don't use something like this to hold open your connection over

I won't say you're insane, but I will say that you seem to be looking at
things from a very narrow point of view...exactly, I might add, what you
accuse everyone else of doing.  Your first article was, by your own
admission, flame bait, and frankly, didn't even deserve a reply.

Fine.  But I have just one request:  define ``commercial environment''.
What kind of commercial environment?  I've worked in and been exposed to
so many *VERY* different environments in the ``commercial'' world that
your statement above, as it stands, really has no meaning.

What type of business are we talking about?  What type of application?  Is
this something that's mission-critical, where the cost of the high-end
equipment is trivial compared to the cost of even a moment's worth of
down-time (in which case, IMHO, *ANY* 80x86 box is out of the question,
regardless of the software it's running)?  Or is this in, perhaps, an
engineering environment, where you have power users, and the possibility
of down-time (note---the only down-time my Linux machine sees is due to
a flaky HD controller that I just haven't gotten around to replacing
yet) doesn't mean the end of the world?

Making a blanket statement such as yours is as meaningless as the one
you made about people in the .edu domain (but that's already been
covered).  Of course, such statements tend to have little, if any
meaning, so.....

>When we are talking about customers and their *weird* environment, with
>LAN's based on NetWare and TokenRing and there's an AS/400 in that ring
>and they use their PC's to connect to the AS/400, Linux falls through.

But that isn't the only kind of commercial environment....  For example,
I work for a government contractor.  May paycheck comes from my employer,
but they get the money directly from the US Government.  We have a few
DOS machines....  One of them is on our receptionist's desk, and she uses
it for WordPerfect (for what, I'm not sure) and connecting to our Suns.
Our technical documentation is mostly done on a NeXT running Framemaker.
I prefer TeX (plain TeX, btw, not LaTeX), and I use it.  From comments
I've heard, I'm not the only one using TeX, and there may well be more
documentation from our group done with TeX in the future.  Either way,
it's all done under UNIX, not dos.

We even have some PCs running Novell (as of a few weeks ago ... but it
isn't working completely right yet---it seems to have problems connecting
to our Suns via TCP/IP).  Token ring?  Yeah, right....  We don't even
have anything remotely IBM-ish anywhere in sight.

Oh, btw, if I were posting from there (which I don't---most of our computer
equipment, and our network, is GFE, and posts to comp.linux newsgroups are
not likely to fall under the appropriate-use rules ... so I don't even
have col.* on our newsfeed) I would be posting from the .af.mil domain,
not the .edu domain.  Oh, all of my professional employment has been in
the ``commercial environment'' (i.e., not .edu, etc.).....

I guess my point is, don't try to speak for the entire commercial world
based on the environment *YOU* happen to work in.
