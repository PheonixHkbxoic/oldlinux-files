Try kernel 1.1.22. I've been using this kernel and backup everyday

A new version of Linux Doom has appeared on sunsite.unc.edu in
/pub/Linux/Incoming/linxdoom.tgz.  This version has pixel doubling
and tripling fixed!  Pixel doubling is even playably fast on a 486/66 VLB.
The problem was apparently an endianness thing.

From the README:

Isn't "gn" the server? I think you still need to run a Gopher client to
look at the data.

I have one that's working here (ET4000 with 17'' AOC monitor), but it

not find out how to make it bigger vertically. Perhaps someone else
can continue with this:

btw: Could it be that fvwm gets confused with this resolution? It
seems not to scroll correctly in the vertical direction.

I found gcc-2.6.0.tar.gz-slplit on ftp.uu.net, but how do I unpack

This is strange. With tracker 3.x I had no problems with my PAStudio 16.
With tracker 4.3 I had much more improved sound but got the "DMA timed
out ..." error message as soon as there were disk activities, so I
suspect an inkompatibility with my AHA1542B.

Surprisingly sound works perfect under Linux-Doom. (But not under DOS-Doom)

I think as a general rule, when there are no complaints about breaking
this or that, then also a non hacker could give it a try.

And to answer your question, I haven't noticed any problems, but then
again, I have quiet standard hardware and haven't stressed the kernel
that much, so this can't be the ultimate answer.

I also have an HP Deskjet 520, and there is support available for

The first problem mention in the origional posting of no CR if fixed by
the following input filter.
===================================================================

echo -ne \\033\&k2G

===================================================================

With the above filter text files will print correctly.

If however you want to do some formating etc. then the djscript
file mentioned above is excelent.  It is available at sunsite.unc.edu
in the /pub/linux/system/Printing directory.

Postscript support is provided by the dj500 device in the 
standard ghostscript distribution.   I use the following
filter for ps

===================================================================
#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/gs -q -sDEVICE=djet500 -r300x300 -dNOPAUSE -sOutputFile=- -
===================================================================

DVI support is provided by a program called dvidj500, which is
also available at sunsite  in /pub/linux/apps/tex/.

The printing HOWTO also provides excelent information osnf the setting
up of printcap files & filters, and is well worth obtaining.

I seriously doupt that your monitor can handle that kind of

        *Ahem* First of all, this question should have been posted to 
AN X GROUP, such as comp.x-windows.help or somesuch. But I feel generous 
today...I don't know why.
        From my .Xdefaults file: Seyon.dialDelay: 1
Note that Seyon is capitalised, then a dot seperates it from the 
option, then a colon for the field variable. All X toolkit resources 
(that I've seen) work with this syntax. 
        We now return you to LINUX.help
