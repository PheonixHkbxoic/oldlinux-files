I tried to install a new Boot Menu on my hard drive (which contains a
Linux and a MSDos partition) and in the process screwed up the
partition table (I think).  When I run fdisk (in Linux) the logical
start and physical start of the first partition (/dev/hda1, my Dos
partition) are different.  They should both be 1.  It doesn't seem to
be affecting my system any, since I can  use both Dos and Linux.  But
I'd rather set it back to the way it should be.  Does anyone know how?
Please?

Or did I miss something? Did you mean "print postscript files to a 
non-postscript printer"? This one has been solved and described in 
the Printing-HOWTO.

Idea: The data structure should be a list of document fragments. The document
fragments are bounded by having the exact same attributes for each character
in the fragment. So a line of text like this:

This is normal <bold> And bold <italic> and bold italic <end_italic> <end_bold>

Would have three fragments:
1) This is normal
2) And bold
3) and bold italic

You could even break fragments at line and page breaks.

We could even meta-structure paragraphs over a contiguous set of fragments.

The win is that since oftentimes long strings of characters have the
same attribute the attribute need not be repeated over and over again.
Also adding/deleting characters in the middle of a string doesn't affect
the structure much.

The problem is mapping the current cursor position and more importantly
cursor movement to the fragment list.

Also use UNICODE so that Richard doesn't blow a gasket! ;-)

Cool. A library with the basic elements is even better then trying to
hack away at an existing completed editor.

Fairly well.

It has sticking points with some of the function key assignments and some
parts of the display missing but yes.

Yes. Here's why. DOSEMU+WordPerfect cannot be bundled as a simple package
in any distribution. DOSEMU seems to need to be recompiled with every
kernel revision, and WordPerfect must be purchased. So the setup time
in addition to any standard Linux installation is substantial.

Also as I pointed out before DOSEMU is flawless in console mode. However
once you start trying to use it remotely some of its warts start to show
due to a lack of keyboard and video mappings to remote keyboards and screens.

Linux needs a wordprocessor that easy to use, runs out the box, and doesn't
require a whole lot of additional tools to function, and works remotely
on that vt100 you're talking about (which rules out EZ). 

I have SCO WordPerfect sitting in a box waiting for me to install it.
All I have to do is upgrade my kernel, get the IBSC2 module, compile it,
insmod it into my new kernel, Load Wordprefect, install it and then I'm 
ready to get started.

On the other hand I wanted to look at JED which wasn't in the Slackware 1.2.0
distribution but is in 2.0.X. I ftp'ed the package and un-tarred it. It ran
perfectly. And fast too because of no emulation.

An aside: have you tried the DOS version on JED under the emulator? You should
and check to speed difference. BTW I haven't. Yet.

I'm real sure about this project. It's a need.

Subject: Line Drawing Characters
Date: 16 Oct 1994 03:02:27 GMT
Reply-To: davis@amy.tch.harvard.edu

Hi,

   After reading the man pages for termcap and terminfo as well as the
termcap/terminfo book, I have come to the conclusion that termcap/terminfo
has very little to say about line drawing characters and alternate character
sets.  It is my understanding that there are basically four termcap strings
that must be considered: 

          ac      str            graphic character set pairs aAbBcC -
                                 def=VT100
          ae      str     (P)    end alternate character set
          as      str     (P)    start alternate character set

and another to initialize the alternate character set.

Now, I understand each of these strings but I do not understand the
relationship between the `ac' and the `ae/as' strings.  If `ac' is given,
then are the line drawing characters supposed to be in the alternate
character set?  What if `ac' is not given?  Then do I assume that the
terminal uses VT100 line drawing sequences?  For the vt100, I have to switch
to the appropriate alternative character set and then output `l', `m',
etc... to get line drawing characters.  For systems with the `ac' string
defined, I output the charactor paired to `l', etc... Unfortunately, this
does not work on all systems because some alternative character sets do not
include the line drawing characters.

Summary of my questions:

  1.  If `ac' is not given, do I assume that there is no line drawing
      characters, or, as is suggested in the man page, do I assume VT100
      style line drawing?
      
  2.  If `ac' is given, do I assume that the line drawing characters are in
      the alternate character set?
      
This seems to be one of those little understood gray areas--- at least this
is suggested by the lack of any clear documentation.  I do not understand
why it was not simply implemented as a boolean flag: either the terminal
supports line drawing characters or not.  If it does, do XXX to begin using
these characters and do YYY to end the mode.

Thanks.

        The boot floppy image is bootflpy-3.5-720k, not vmlinux.
That is why you failed to boot linux.  Also note, you must use a
low density boot floppy.  We do provide copies of the new boot
floppies for free, by the way.

        In the future, rather than jumping to the conclusion that
you have found an Yggdrasil bug and posting a long rant devoid
of technical details like specific error messages, you might want to ask
"am I doing something wrong?"  If you think you have found a
bug, then report it to us (as chapter 10 of the manual explains,
we do not charge people to report bugs).

Hi,

  I have a strange problem using PPP.  When I first boot my computer, I
have no way to make PPP dial a number.  I would have to exit and goto
DOS/ms-windows to make a modem connection.  Then when I come back to Linux,
PPP behave perfectly.

  Is this a modem initialization problem?  Thanks for the help.

You can run Windows 3.0 in Real-Mode in DosEmu or you can wait for
Wine. Wine is a windows abi emulator (like Sun's WABI) which is
currently in development. At the moment it can't run any of the mayor
Windows applications like WinWord, WP etc (look at the FAQ in
comp.emulators.ms-windows.wine). But in a year or so this might be
different. So keep your DOS/Windows partition.

X-Window over a 144k modem line? I don't think that's a good idea..

Well, you make it more complicated then it should be. The 'not ML'

twice. And WYSIWYG vs. TEXT is just a matter of the display part of the
program -- not the most difficult part, if you want to clone the best of
TeX and Ms-Word.

So you basically need only one program ('ML') with two display backends : 
WYSIWYG and TEXT.

We are putting the finishing touches on our CD-ROM distribution
and I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on the stability
of some of the more recent kernels.

Our install procedure allows you to use multiple kernel versions,
and right now we have 1.0.9 and 1.1.18.  Version 1.1.53 has been
a little bit troublesome and may not make the cut.  What version
do you think is the latest, most stable release?
