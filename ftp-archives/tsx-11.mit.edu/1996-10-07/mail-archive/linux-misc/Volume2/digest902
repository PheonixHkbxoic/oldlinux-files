Hi,

I got some mail from mark@hartong... who wanted help setting up slurp.
If you're reading this Mark, I sent you some things but your mail is
set up incorrectly and they were sent to 'mark@hartong' (no domain!)
and bounced back.  I deleted your original letter, and I can't find
any posts from you in the comp.os.linux.* groups.

I'm sorry to have troubled everyone else, but I didn't know how else
to get in touch with Mark.

Peace, Ben

Subject: Mitsumi FX001D-E (enhanced IDE) CDROM
Date: Sat, 8 Oct 1994 13:53:20 GMT

Hi!

I'm wondering if the Mitsumi FX001D-E CDROM (similar to FX001D, but equipped
with enhanced IDE interface instead of proprietary Mitsumi adaptor card)
works with Linux.

The CDROM-HOWTO (as of 08/21/94) mentions some (alpha) kernel driver for
drives "based on a modified version of the IDE hard disk standard", but i'm 
not sure if this is what i'm looking for.
In my understanding, an enhanced IDE CDROM would appear to the kernel as any
other IDE disk drive, except of the lacking writing capability, of course.
So no kernel driver patch should be necessary?

I'm not (yet) Linux user and currently trying to make up my mind on what 
hardware to get for Linux. As an SCSI CDROM is much more expensive than the 
Mitsumi and the FX001DE is the same price as the normal FX001D, this enhanced
IDE solution seems to be quite attractive. Once the Linux kernel fully supports
the enhanced IDE transfer modes, this will be not only a comparably elegant, 
but also acceptably fast solution, won't it?

So, are there any experiences with this matter out there?
What about compatibility with software tools like audio players or photo-CD
access?

Thanks, Matthias.

Right on.  The point here is that most people prefer for these two things
to be integrated, and not artificially separated.  Separation here is an
artifact of the 80s.

Now I realize that many people - particularly people who like to get into
the internals of every system they encounter - like LaTeX as it is.  Just
recognize, folks, that you are in the minority.  Also, recognize that the
rest of us aren't just stupid.  We simply have different priorities.

I can just see it now:  Renegade Unixoid takes over as project manager for
the next revision of Word, and decides to strip it of its GUI; anyone not
willing to go along considered brain dead....

Actually this is not really true.  There are only 2 assembly routines in 
PC Doom according to its author John Carmack (if its 3 not 2, please 
don't flame me, I don't have the artical infront of me.) Doom's speed 
comes from highly optimized algorithyms for drawing vertical walls.  

In general the win from properly desgined algorithyms is many times that
you get just by dropping to assembly.  There is a mystique abotu asembly
code, though 'cause its a manly thing to do..... (And yes, you can always
get some FINAL improvement by tight coding in asembly at the center of a
loop.  But in a really well designed algorithym, its not going to be more
then a few frames/sec improvement max.)

Correct me if I am wrong here, but didn't internal parallel processing 
(multiple seperate Fp and Integer processors0 coem in with the 486?  
Thats whatI remember from teh BYTE artical on it.  Thsi to me woudl seem 
to be a MAJOR architectural change.  (Among other things, it makes 
careful mixing of floating point and ineteger math actually preferrable 
to pure intger math as it keeps more of the sub-processors busy at once...)

This is lovely news, but if it's the same news as I've heard, what we have
here is not an internationalized/multilingual product, but rather one that
has been hacked to include support for a language here and there.  So, for
instance, things I do easily every day with MLS (or could with Nisus) on
micros, I could not do with TeX.  This includes quoting Greek, Hebrew, Eng-
lish, Arabic, etc. in the same document.  I believe that some versions of
TeX do Hebrew/Arabic and English; others might do Greek and English.  The
model here, though, is not that of a multilingual product.

I really hope that the info I have is wrong.  Please correct me if it is.

Also, I'd like to know what form TeX will accept those alternate languages
in.  If it will accept, say, Unicode, and will allow me to use an editor
that displays "foreign" characters correctly on the screen (going in the
correct direction), then I'd say TeX has made it into the 90s.

So far I've not seen evidence of this.  But then I only check on such
things about once a year.  I don't have time to follow what has been, for
many years now, a dead end.

Date: Thu, 6 Oct 1994 15:42:12 GMT

Hey all, 

Like, I have a big question to ask..  I guess this could be classified
as help category, maybe not..  anyways

from time to time my linux box locks up for no appearant reason.  I
have checked the log files and nothing there is really relavent. I
made sure that things that were recently added were removed and the
like.  Basically what happens is if I telnet to it it states it was
connected, but nothing happens after that.  If I try access gopher
it says nothing is available.  If I go to the console it has a login
prompt and I try to login, no password prompt appears.  Any clues?

Here is some stats:

486 DX 33Mhz
32 MEG Ram
1.05 GIG Conner SCSI DRIVE
240 MEG Quantum SCSI DRIVE
160 MEG Quantum IDE DRIVE
Adaptec 1542CF SCSI controller
VLB Graphics card (not running X)
3.5" FLOPPY (BOOTS FROM)

AMI BIOS (turned off EXTERNAL CACHE as vendor has had problems)
oh, SCSI BIOS is enabled

I am using LINUX KERNEL 1.1.51
Running Gopher Server 
Running EBBS software 
SendMail by BERKELEY



I havent had problems till recently. (could this be the 1.1.51 kernel
doing this to me?)

BTW, our linux box has to stay online 24 hours a day (functionally) as
it is our gopher server.

Thanks

This is covered in the Fall 1994 errata.  The errata is available for

We are unable to reproduce a segmentation fault.  It is always
possible that the copy you are running has been corrupted.

Meanwhile, I might suggest trying `less'.

Please get a copy of the errata.  It covers this and other small

    I haven't had any of the problems you mentioned, but I have yet to be
able to boot Linux from my hard drive.  I think that part of the problem
stems from the fact that the Fall 94 CD has a lot of the directories
changed from previous releases and it is causing problems.  The Lilo docs
uses a totally different directory structure than this CD does.

    I am wondering how many of the shell scripts haven't been updated to
match the new release.

All,

Our company is considering making a Linux equipped PC an ftp/gopher/http
server, but I don't know if such machines are able to handle the load. We
will ultimately be giving the machine its own router and 56k line, but we
have no idea what CPU's are appropriate -- 486 DX2/66, P60, P66, P90,
etc. The PC would have 16 Meg ram and at least a gig SCSI drive.

What I'm really looking for is something like: "a 486-66 starts to bog
down at 100 ftp logins transferring data out, but a p60 could take at
least 400 without breaking into a sweat".

We aren't sure what the average size of concurrent ftp/http accesses will
be, but we would like to be more than 200. If a Linux PC is simply
incapible of doing this, we would probably get a used Sun.

Feel free to email or post your answers. I could really use your help. Thanx

Virtually,
Warr

*BSD has the proc filesystem too (wasn't that a Plan 9 idea?) so that is
not what I had in mind. Linux does use inittab, and rc.d (runlevels) like
System V. I guess I see things from the administrative point of view, users
see things from a shell or library level. No insult intended.

I generalized statements about all the groups, not to start a religous
war but to stop one. Linux, *BSD, and Mach running one of these as a server
are all good. Each group will be viable for the near future, each group has
its own support/design/distribution/economical drives. People from OS XX are
not going to switch to OS YY at this point. New people sincerly ask which
OS they should run. It would be wrong to say in long term or even today, that
OS XX is better than YY. If you want to convert them to Linux, sell them on
the "market share", the DOS-philic (for example filesystems), NetBSD people
can sell their plans (and successes) of have one OS across multiple CPU
architectures, FreeBSD people can sell their approach of wanting very tested
stable releases. This is certain better than "XX has a shitty HH (for me)", "No,
the HH in XX is works great (for me), you are just mad because your II is slow
(for me)"...

The new people can decide what they want. Let us sell, not FUD. If my
generalizations were offending, or incorrect, I am sorry. Lets let each
group put out a list of "selling features" for their OS. We can bundle all
of the selling features into a "What should I run FAQ", and let the user
choose.

:1) A mouse-driven tool for setting common X resource preferences would
:be *very* helpful, even for experienced users (kind of a big project,
:I know).  Hewlett-Packard workstations include this as part of the
:HP-VUE desktop-- you can adjust window colors, background pixmaps,
:speaker pitch & volume, screensaver status, etc. from a "control
:panel"-like utility.  There are too many things under X that can be
:configured only from the command line, which is not good (ideally both
:a good GUI and command-line way of setting each option should exist).

Perhaps, but HP-VUE is Motif-based, and, just in case you haven't noticed,
*it's a resource hog*.  You're probably running with at least 32 megs
of memory on a nice PA-Risc workstation, which is quite a bit more 
powerful than an Intel box.  I'm not saying your ideas are bad, but I
couldn't *stand* using VUE 3.0 with less than 32 megs...I had to for
a while with 24 megs, and it simply *sucked*.  (twm & tvtwm were starting
to look awfully attractive ;-)

:       An extension of this idea might involve using GetWidetTree
:calls to a selected application to find out what resources can be set
:(like editres does), filtering out those that are obviously used only
:internally, and providing some kind of nice front-end for altering
:these (and saving them to .Xdefaults, which would be automatically
:"xrdb -load'ed" on exiting the preferences tool).  HP-VUE even allows
:some things to be changed on the fly in already-running clients, but I
:think support for this has to be specially compiled into each client.
:Maybe a drop-in replacement for some of the X shared libraries could
:allow existing binaries to support this, though?
:
:2) A better X file manager than what's currently out there (xfm &
:xfilemanager are nice but not as easy to configure, easy to use, or
:generally polished as one might like).  Maybe something that provided

more and more resources....

:essentially the same functionality as Mouseless Commander (the
:text-based Norton Commander clone), but with a mouse-driven GUI? (&
:provisions for icons if desired, scrollbars on the dual file selection
:lists, real pulldown menus-- leave in the command line at the bottom,
:though!).
:
[CHOMP]

:3) Another idea from HP-VUE... this environment features a "console
:bar" area at the bottom of the screen, containing buttons to switch
:virtual desktops, invocation icons for commonly-used apps, small icons

I've been toying with somthing quite similar using fvwm and xfm...the
functionality is quite similar if you don't mind using fvwm's virtual
desktops.

:for system functions (logging out...), and space for a clock,
:calendar, Xload bargraph, & other stuff.  The appearance of the bar is
:very professional, with little beveled insets for each item.  I'm

more and more resources....

My company is probably going to pay for a residential ISDN
installation at home, and I would be a fool to not look into this.  I
have a PC at home, running the usual DOS/Windows crap, and also
running Linux (yay!).  DigiBoard has announced a product called
DataFire (maybe DigiFire, I always get confoozed here) which runs
2B+D, has an ODI interface, PPP support.  Their slick says they
support Windows for Workgroups 3.1.1, but makes no mention of Windows
3.1.

I have also found that psi.com has an ISDN dialup Internet service,
running both with their software under Windows (great for the kids)
and under PPP (but not "certified" to work with Linux, only SUN,
HP-UX, a couple like that).  This service costs $29 a month for 29
hours connect time.  Hey! this caught my attention.

On a side note, as much as I personally hate Windows, it is a lot
easier for the kids, and I don't object at all to having a Windows
Internet interface for them.  Especially since there are many Windows
programs they use for school essays and such, I don't see any need to
force them to use Linux.  But I personally want Linux, if for no other
reason thn that I can work at home once in a while.

So here are my questions:

1.  What can people tell me in general about home ISDN, that I
probably haven't already found out from PacBell?

2.  WHat does this ODI interface mean to me and Linux?  Is this a
standard hardware interface, for which Linux drivers already exist?
Or are there easily modifiable drivers?

3.  What the heck is WIndows for Workgroups 3.1.1, and would those
drivers probably work with Windows 3.1?

4.  What the heck, let me ask again for any general information.  You
probably can not send me too much basic information; I can always toss
it.

My friend is psoting this for me; I haven't got news access, so please
REPLY rather than FOLLOWUP.  I will of course accumulate replies and
send him a summary to post.
