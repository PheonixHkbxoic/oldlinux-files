I'd tell you more. UNIX (and Linux in particular) is easier to administrate
than networked DOS. In DOS you `easy' install packages, TSR and drivers,
and without tuning you easy convert your system into a bloody mess.
After installing PC NFS+Novell you're get 300K of free memory <grin>.
BTW, I cannot say that installing both of them is easy process.
To make system usable you should `tune' it. That tuning involves loading
some of scrap to UMB <grin>.... Just figure out, what are UMB, HMA, EMS & XMS.
Or, better, try to explain to naive UNIX programmer, what they are.
You should be careful: that programmer could die from laugh...

That `easy to use/administrate' Windose is bloody mess from the beginning.
Just an example:
We have network installation of Windose 3.1 on Netware server.
Most users have no write access to server Windose directory - OK.
We need win32s to run Mosaic. I download public domain distibution,
and try to install it. It starts, searches for server directory,
and screams `I cannot write there!'. I say `&$^&^, log as administrator,
install it again. Now all goes `easy'.
OK. Then I'm trying to install it to other computer. Same thing.
That stupid installer doesn't understand that server directory is
already updated. 
Because I need easy way to install win32 to all of the computers on
the network, I try to figure out, what that thing does to my
system.ini and win.ini. I found several added lines, add same lines
on other computer... No success. Windose starts without a warning,
win32 don't work. And so on. I still have no clue, WHAT damned thing
does. May be it patches win.com...

And it's the way of MESSY-Windose `easy' administration.
While you're following the patterns, you can live with small amount
of problems. Once you're trying to to something SLIGHTLY non-standard,
you're lost forever.

Another example:
System V already have install/uninstall command for packages, 
that keeps track of installed files and configuration changes, 
so installaion is easier than in Windose. 
Did anybody tried to get rid from Windose app?
UNINSTALL program for Windose is a kludge, not a solution.

So, idea that UNIX require much administration is not a fact, but
a prejustice. However, it makes things worse for UNIX.
One easy can change the fact: he/she just could write GUI front end
to idtune or it's Linux analog. 
But it's very hard to change prejustice in peoples minds...

Yeah, but don't try to buy if directly from Walnut Creek - they have to

computer shows, and distributors...

zip -r filename.zip filelist

will create a zip file recursed through subdirectories.

unzip filename.zip

will unzip and automatically create all necessary directories.
These programs can handle pkzip files.
These files can be handled by pkzip.

I've got the same problem with an Orchid Kelvin 64. I think the X
server uses some of the font-area on the card. As a hack I run setfont
after leaving X. Don't do this on a VC whilst X is still running;
things crash.

Subject: How to pronounce Linux??
Date: 28 Sep 1994 15:33:49 GMT

I've heard two pronunciations of Linux, both are variations of the "i" sound.
My natural tendancy is to pronounce the "i" like "hi".  The other common
pronunciation has the "i" sound like "in".

Is there a correct pronunciation?

Thanks,

So the question is really: How should "Linux" be pronounced in english.

The trick I use is based on an emailed conversation I had with Linus while
writing the interview for the first issue of Linux Journal:

Linus credits the name LINUX to a friend of his who posted the first version
of the OS to the net under the name LINUX.  Linus (a name with, at least in
english, a long i), who is a decent and humble human being, went along with
the name on condition that it was not named after him, but after the first
OS that inspired him to write Linux, namely MINIX.

Given that Minix, at least in english, has a short i, that is how I
pronounce Linux. BUT I always qualify any discussion on this subject with:
as long as you talk about Linux no one cares how you pronounce it.

Cheers,  Bob.

Bad idea.  Even a newbie user could quickly understand that he logs
in under a user name, and gets a setup designed for him.  So many people
use networks at work today that the concept of logging in to a system is
not intimidating.  If they then are introduced to the concept that you
must login as a "superuser" to configure the system, they should be able to
understand it.
It's essential that an intro to Unix include this concept; it's one of the
major features of it, that it's a multi-user system.  One setup for Dad,
one for Junior, one for Mom, etc.

Sounds OK.  This is very similar to the approach I take with getting Unix
accounts for people I know are DOS literate but Unix dummies.  Alias all
the commands to DOS-like equivalents.
Be sure to note things like the cp "feature" of overwriting files if a bad
wildcard is given to it.  If you don't know what I mean, reconsider this
whole idea...

Agreed, no need for vi or emacs.  Go with joe or pico.

If you want to go so far as to include SLIP, you should include some sort
of Web Browser.  If they have the Web, they have access to most of the
protocols they need to survive for a while on the Net.

Wrong.  Many machines in the Pentium range come with SCSI options now, and
it's surprising how many clueless users are shelling out the $$$ for these
kinds of features, just because of the cool buzzword.  Include SCSI
support.

Well, ez fails to impress me, and it's kinda big.  Might reconsider this

Minicom should do.  Seyon requires diddling with Resources, right?  That

        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you need to conserve space, I guess I understand this one.  It's just so
non-Unix, though...

Well, as an intro package, this sounds OK.  Not sure if it's going to be
Unixy enough to truely sway the DOS/Win user to the dark side, though.

        There is a correct pronunciation and an incorrect pronunciation. 
The 'I' is short. Linux almost rhymes with 'shucks'. Or, if you prefer

Yes.  Thanks.  I should have thought of that -- I upgraded emacs only
the other day.

On a more general note: can we change it?  'unknown' smacks of 'I'm
guessing here'.  I know that you can spec it manually to be whatever
you want (my emacs binary is 'i486-opus-linux') -- the basic question
is *what*.

First off, we're not all using the same vendor, and I guess many Linux
users built their own system anyway.  Second, the vendor doesn't
matter worth a damn anyway (from an emacs compilation point of view,
that is).  So we need a vendor-neutral term that describes i486 linux
systems.  My suggestion is prompted by listening and reading the way
which other linux users refer to their computers, and hence I propose

  i486-box-linux

I'm off to recompile emacs etc now...

Well, what do you think?  Is it all a stupid waste of time?  I though
it would make a change from 'I get 6fps on doom in ...' and 'Buy QNX
now'.  If enough people respond favourably I'll mail the author of the
script below and request a change.

If this could be done, I think it's a great idea! I also am running a fully
native Linux using ext2, and quite enjoy it. I had a little difficulty
installing, but that was over a year ago, when a lot of people had difficulty
installing. Over the last year, I've noticed a steady decline in the number of
people with unix experience who have trouble installing linux. On the other
hand, I've noticed an increase in unix newbies who have trouble installing. If
they could install a zip file from dos, and then switch to linux as a last
step, I think we could win over a lot of converts! After the initial install,
they could learn at their own pace (hopefully eventually wiping most of their
DOS and primarily running Linux :)

I am looking for Ada compiler on linux. I read somewhere, there is such thing
but I missed to save the information. I will really appreciate it, if someone
will post information for how to get the Ada compiler for Linux.


Thanks in Adavance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Please, I just ate.

In all seriousness, I don't think that this approach is necessary.
It would be trivial to provide a set of Slackware/Debian/whatever
packages which include software and configuration for people who
are new to the system.

But I strongly suggest against doing this. Hiding the system from
the user is not going to teach them anything: In fact, it can
seriously damage the user's chances of learning the system in
the future. 

Your solution appears to be to take away the power of UNIX in order
to make it more accessible. That is not a solution at all; that is
enforced brain damage.

There are things that can be done to wean new users into the world
of UNIX. But giving Linux a lobotomy is not the answer.

Ah. The joke's on me. I thought for a minute that your posting was
serious.
