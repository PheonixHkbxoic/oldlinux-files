Subject: tk3.6 w/Pixmap patches, shared lib incompatible?
Date: 14 Oct 1994 14:42:38 GMT

I've finally managed to rebuild tk3.6 with pixmap support under Linux, using
  sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/devel/tcl/tk3.6p1l1-src.tar.gz
as source distribution and adding the patch and additional module files from
  ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de:/pub/tcl/contrib/extensions/TkPixmap3.6i.tar.gz

As far as libtk.a is concerned, there's no problem at all (except its size :)
so it seems to be desirable to use the shared library version of it instead.

Since the pixmap patch adds new global symbols to the shared library, binary
compatibility is lost and any executable linked with the original version
dumps core (SIGSEGV) when run. An obvious way-around is to rename the library,
so what about: libtkp.a, libtkp.sa, libtkp.so.3.1.2 ? Shouldn't this renamed
version get a new load address provided by myself or even from the `Linux
Shared Libs Load Address Maintainer' because of address conflicts with the
unpatched version?

I for one can live with any kludge I made on my system, but I suppose the
author of TkPixmap patches (Sven Delmas, see Cc:) is interested in adding
shared lib support for Linux. Sorry for any inconvenience if not.

Missed the point Grant. Mr. Davis is saying that there needs to be an
application that can be run in a text environment. It doesn't have to be
WYSIWYG (in fact as you've aptly pointed out it can't be). However anything
that can be run on a terminal would be helpful and appriciated.

And 'ez' is close to what we want for WYSIWYG X.

Effectiveness isn't the issue. The plain fact is that as-is very very few
folks that are currently using WordProcessors will even attempt to touch a
formatter. They're apples and oranges. Unfortunately most folks can't seem
to see that distinction.

We need a front end that looks and acts exactly like standard wordprocessors.
What's going on under the hood is quite irrelavent to most of the 
Wordprocessing users out there.

Apples and oranges. Turn the question around. 

"How many current DOS/WINDOWS/MAC Wordprocessing users would dump their
 Ventura Publisher, WordPerfect, Word, Interleaf and others to use TeX?"

It doesn't matter how powerful or how slick an application is if the
potential users of the application refuse to use it.

Listen. I like LaTeX. I use it almost excluively. However when my mother
wants to write a history test or my father wants to write a speech they
want something that looks and acts similar to WordPerfect or Word.

We are agreed. In fact I've been proposing another formatter called
QuikScript which is unique because it's written in PostScript. So the
redering part of the process leaves out the source->dvi->ps conversion.

But we agree on the principal of the process.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted biweekly to
comp.os.linux.announce.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other

- should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.

And for everybody else: No. 

I don't want to hurt the people who work on the WINE-project, but the
persistent rumour "...that you can run MS-Windows under Linux..."
leads people to expectations that are not founded in reality. Such
disappointments may cause people to think that the rest of Linux too
is just hype.

Therefore I would suggest that we, Linux partisans,keep a low profile
on WINE unless at least those MS-Windows applications that come with
the original distribution, work without problems.

Yeah.  And while we're at it:  What programming language has the full
functionality of assembler?  Who do all you bloody wimps think you are
using 'fun' packages like TK/TCL, PERL, etc.?  Why, when I was a kid all

Also, there is an entire mini-HOWTO written on this. Look up "SwapSpace"
in the doc/HOWTO/mini - directory of your nearest Linux FTP site. That
also should eliminate the problems you said you were having.

      Unfortunately, this still says nothing about OS/2. Does it use a
swap file, or partition? If the latter, what file system, if any - I'm
thinking down the lines of, can it do the same trick Linux is doing.

I must disagree here. I was unable to overclock my AMD DX/2-66. Oh, sure..if 
you only run DOS it might fly, but not loaded down Windows, or OS/2. I know 
SOME people get away with it, but it was by no means gauranteed. I am now 
running an AMD DX/2-80 in the same machine with the same software.
        It is possible that the DX/2-80 is  simply a sampling of the "best" of the 
DX/2-66s that come off the line, but I would think it unlikely tht AMD is just 
wholesale relabling DX/2-66s to DX/2-80s.

According to c't (a German magazine) out today, there is a new chip
coming from AMD ('Q4 1994') which will be called DXL4 and will be
optionally a clock doubler or tripler. Clearly the number at the
end is 2 ** (doubling factor - 1) :-).

(This makes the new 300MHz (330 Specint) Alpha a sort of 'DX256',
assuming it runs externally with 33MHz.)

The DXL4 only goes up to 100MHz, if I remember correctly, and doesn't
have the accellerated multiply or enlarged 1st level cache of Intel's
DX4. That's not to say you can't overclock it if you put your PC in
a freezer...

        Uh, what word processor are you going to have all those people
using on your Linux/Xwindows/Motif setup?  It's an important consideration,
since as you stated, they will be doing mostly word processing.

        Personally, if they have the money, I think their solution with
100 Macs is a better idea.  Linux and Xwindows aren't particularly friendly
for novice users.  They'd probably be far more productive with the Macs.

        Mind you, personally I don't like Macs, and much prefer the Unix
style environment... but I don't deceive myself into thinking it's the
right environment for everyone.
