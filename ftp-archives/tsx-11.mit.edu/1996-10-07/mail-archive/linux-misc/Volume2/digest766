        I need to find the equivalent command to Borland's clrscr() in
conio.h.  I looked in the curses.h but I'm pretty sure the clear() function
in there is not quite what I'm looking for.  Anyone got any ideas?

As far as I know, it can be run compatible with HP 550C drivers
(then only supporting 300x300 dpi). In this case, you might use
ghostscript under linux to produce high-quality color outputs
(as far as I can say that - I'm not an expert on this). Perhaps
ghostscript 3.0 has a driver for the hp560c - ask in comp.ghostscript
(or similar) if that is so.
For OS/2 drivers, contact HP directly. When I was needing an OS/2
driver for my brand-new HP550C a year ago, I got it from them -
if there's an OS/2 driver not included with the printer, you might
get it from them as well.

Well, it was just a thought.  I've gotten a couple pieces of mail
saying that this is a security risk, and that is definitely true for
some people -> namely the ones where the DOS system is either
networked or the computer is physically accessible to others who
you don't trust.

But for myself (and I assume many others) my computer is here on my
desk safely in my room.  If someone had physical access to it, they
could just boot a Linux install disk off the floppy drive and mount my
harddrive and change the /etc/passwd if they wanted.  (unless I change
the CMOS to not boot from the floppies...but that's a bad solution).

It would just be very convenient not to have to reboot into Linux to
grab something from a file on those semi-often occasions when I'm
caught playing games in DOS and need some stuff from Linux.

But thanks for the replys, I just wanted to see if it existed is all.
I'm not very good at programming DOS, so I definitely couldn't do it
myself.

Yep, and not to be confused with Seattle's QDOS (quick and dirty o/s)

I got the program doom_16to8bit_snd.tgz from incoming on sunsite. I
allows running doom on an 8-bit soundcard. It worked great with my
SoundBlaster/Pro -- as good as the DOS version. You also need a recent
kernel (get 1.1.50) that has "DOOM mode" support in the sound driver.

I'm running it right now.  It's TeX'ing something for me.  Installs easily.
Only problem is, in X (Yes) the sleep mode is odd -- this may also occur in 
text mode, too.  You just have to manually sleep it, or sync'ing keeps
waking it up before it completely times out.  Maybe fiddling with the 
sync daemon will help that.  Once it's asleep for real the clock stops getting
updates, and syncing also stops, I guess.  Suspend/resume does work.

But it does work.  I installed slackware 1.2.  Use the tty install disk.

You need to use a floppy disk (why I got one), and it needs to be bootable.
Older Aero's may not have this ability (ROM date needs to be 3/7/94).

The floppy (PCMCIA) is readable w/o any drivers -- linux complains a 
bit, and you have to tell it it's /dev/fd0H1440, but then it works fine.

Make a diagnostics diskette, since lilo prevents you from using their method to 
boot into the diagnostics.  Then you can delete the diag. partition and gain 2 
meg of space.

X is slow with 4 meg RAM (more is available if you have some money), but I 
did get it working with some help.  The SVGA server didn't recognize the card,
and SuperProbe gave another guess, so I use the VGA16 server.

Here's Xconfig info:

FontPath        "/usr/X386/lib/X11/fonts/misc/,/usr/X386/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/"

Alliance is aimed at VLSI synthesis but if that is not your goal

I disagree. I'm running Linux on a 386DX/40 with only 4 meg, and it seems 
fine to me.  Of course, it is all what you are used to.  I'm used to 
DOS/Windows on the same machine, and Linux is much more comfortable to 
use.  It also depends on what you want to do.  If you want to run X, have 
multiple logins, compiles, and what not, then it'll be slow.  For 
"normal" work, I'm really happy.

>: 2)how much HD is required ?
>Give it 100 MB for comfort.

Again, this all depends on what you want to have on your hard drive.  
Personally, I would recommend getting something like InfoMagic's CDs (if 
you have a CD-ROM) with its live filesystem and keep only a minimum 
configuration + X (if you want it) on the hard drive.  You could probably 
keep it down to <50 MB.  Then again, you could get on of the CDs and dump 
*everything* to your HD and use a gig quick.  At home, where I don't have 
a CD-ROM, I use about 120 meg, but I've got about 30-40 meg free.

Ditto.

Or you can use LILO.  Or you can boot it from DOS.  (That's what I do.

I have to recommend InfoMagic's CDs.  A two disk set for $20.  It is 
minimalistic, but if you don't mind figuring things out for yourself, 
it's a hell of a deal.  They can be reached at info@infomagic.com.

Otherwise, look on ftp.cdrom.com, sunsite.unc.edu, and tsx-11.mit.edu.  
Oh, and get /pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/Installation-HOWTO from sunsite.

Enjoy!

In /usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi/aha1542.c you will find the following:

/* The adaptec can be configured for quite a number of addresses, but
I generally do not want the card poking around at random.  We allow
two addresses - this allows people to use the Adaptec with a Midi
card, which also used 0x330 */

static unsigned int bases[]={0x330, 0x334};

You can just edit and/or expand this table...

I modified a couple of files for xgoban and wally so that they would work 
on Linux. Now they do and they are available for anonymous ftp from:

ftp.netcom.com 

as /pub/rph/xgoban-wally.tgz

I'll put it in sunsite and tsx if I can ever get in (busy, busy, busy).

Enjoy!

Hi,

I was wondering if there is an X-Remote program for linux.

I need to run xwindows over a slow serial line, and this is
supposed to get you the best results.  Slip and Cslip and PPP
are just too slow for remote xwindows.

If no xremote port is out there. Is there a program which
is xwindows specific compression to increase my throughput.

thanks,
Sean
