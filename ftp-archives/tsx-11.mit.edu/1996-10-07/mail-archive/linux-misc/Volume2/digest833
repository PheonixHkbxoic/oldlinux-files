Or just the scanner, if we're talking SCSI.  (proprietary interface cards
for things that should really be SCSI--yuk!)

Well, I'm going to have a go at writing a driver for the UMAX 840, a SCSI
flatbed.  (Because I happen to have one, and would rather let it sit than
even boot winblows.)  From what I hear, the UMAX folks should be good about
giving out the info...I will be talking to them sometime in the next few
days.  This will be my first driver, but I fully intend to do it, as it
doesn't seem my scanner is going to be supported unless I do.  

Anyway, being a newbie at this driver writing stuff, I'd like input on
any sort of hooks etc that should be in this thing for stuff folks might
want to add later.  I know nothing about TWAIN, but if it's something I
should even be worrying about, I'd appreciate some pointers in that
direction as well...  As long as I'm writing this thing, it might as well
be of use to as many others as possible, so be sure and speak up if there  
anything I may easily do to make it more general, etc... I am wondering
what degree of similarity there is between SCSI flatbeds from different
mfrs..  Is it likely that once a driver for one SCSI scanner is written,
others will be a good deal easier?  

Anyway, if this is the sort of thing you are interested in seeing,
please bombard me with any useful information you may have.

Possible and cheap sure.  But, SLIP/PPP connections over modem have higher 
overheads than leased lines/ISDN.  For news, mail, ftp, its a win.  For

RAID SCSI arrays work fine - Real RAID systems do all the RAID stuff away
from the computers CPU so that it doesn't notice. If you RAID system
requires the CPU to do the stuff why not just buy an 8bit IDE controller 8)

Striping yes - actually performance so far hasn't needed it. Being able
to grow partitions across disks (ala AIX) is much more important to me and
the one I do miss.

Pardon? - WordPerfect, Xcess, Flagship(Clipper), Several SQL servers, 
CodeBase (C/C++ class library for writing dbase tools), Corel Draw/SCO.

smbfs in ALPHA. SAMBA also allows Linux to server lan manager - including
the extended file name support to NT machines. I couldn't recommend OS/2 to
anyone as a server as it wouldn't have the ability to serve Chicago long
names went it appears. OS/2 also doesn't have a bundled NFS client/server.

>4. There is no support for MCA-based machines.
Its being finalised. Personally the only MCA machines I've seen in the past
three years were 'discards'.

>6. Nationalized version of the few programs existing are not available.
Wordperfect etc all have international support.

>7. Nationalized versions of Linux is not available.
I have a German Linux CD-ROM the SuSE people gave me sitting on my desk.
I guess its one of those illusionary things that people keep denying exist.

But you can pick up the ALPHA tests now. From what I understand Mach64 is
scheduled for Xfree86 3.1. Of course I can go out and buy an alternate X
server if I need to (Tried buying an alternate OS/2 driver for an
unsupported video card 8)).

>9. Printed manuals and easy 'Get started' manuals does not exist.
Wrong. I have several printed Linux books/manuals here. Including some in
Germany.

>10. Support for Mulit-media is shaky.
Now that is a really misinformed statement. Linux can play almost any
animations, have the X MITSHM extension for smooth animation has assorted
sound drivers etc. Tell me where you get nv (network video) for OS/2 ?

>11. Support for ISDN is not generally available.
True.

>12. There is no disk-compression.
True enough but I could never recommend any organisation use disk
compression except on crude single threaded operating systems where the CPU
has nothing better to do during disk I/O.

I avoid netware due to its overall lack of open-ness. If Novell don't sell

Yep - Linux reads Mac disks 8) (xhfs)

Why are you talking about security in the same sentence as OS/2 - OS/2
doesn't even have usernames and 100% bulletproof virtual memory.

IBM don't seem to make very much MCA bus hardware now. Nobody in the company
I work for uses MCA bus. Token ring definitely has its place. 

As to your overall conclusions - I tend to see windows has a nice
wordprocessing client and little more. I have hopes for chicago being a good
network terminal too when they finally finish it. Linux is a fine server,
development environment and is maturing into a good highend(ish) all round
system. It has lots of things OS/2 doesn't have and vice versa (OS/9 disk
reader for OS/2 ?, CAP for OS/2 ?, Andrew for OS/2) ditto Windows for Linux
8)

Are those the pilsener type beers? (Lager, I think in Anglo Saxon

The beer I 'd send to Linus would be the Westmalle Tripel or perhaps
the Rochefort 10. Bit expensive though. That is why I generally brew
my own (not difficult & cheap).

Aside from all that: does anybody know what is involved in getting
bottles with beer to Finland? I understand that the customs over there
put so much tax on it that you'd better invite him over to Holland.
Still I'd want to make a gesture.

(One of the obvious things to work on is electronic transmission
of bottles & alcoholic contents by internet)

Where can we find this alpha driver? Once I get Linux onto my 1Gig IDE disk

The WD80*3 and SMC Ultra use different methods of enabling memory.
Do you know which one this card is similar to?

Those delays shouldn't be necessary with the UltraChip.  They were for
earlier chips that needed a recovery period between accesses.  That was a
bug, not a feature.

BTW, which driver are you trying to use, the SMC Ultra or WD80*3?
Is the ethernet address correctly detected?
Are you receiving any packets at all?  Even errors?  Check /proc/net/dev.
What addresses can the board end up at?

Subject:  NYX Linux Group Meeting at UNIX Expo

There will be a New York City (and region) Linux Users Group meeting at Unix
Expo at New York's Jacob Javits Center on Tuesday October 4, at 5.30pm. 
While a room has not been assigned, it will be in the conference room area
on the lowest level.

The general theme of the evening will be "ask the guru", and we will be
trying to encourage as much interaction between the attendees as possible. 
There will be a panel of knowledgable Linux users on hand to discuss issues
from how to configure hardware, to the future of the Linux OS for both
recreational (DOOM) and corporate use.  The goal will be to have the
"audience" contribute as much as possible.

So come out and meet many of the local and a few national Linuxers.  There
will be even be give aways and we'll invite some suppliers of Linux products
and tools, who will be at the show, such as the Linux Journal crew, to drop by.

You can get a complimentary exhibits pass by registering electronically by 
telnetting to: blenheim.com
and logging in as: unix94
choose your terminal mode (ansi or vt100)
and fill in the form. It did odd things when I registered, but seemed to work.

We also have "complimentary exhibits" paper passes to the show.  Most years
these are accepted at the door despite their advance registration wording. 
If you email me with the subject: EXPO   and include an address I'll put one
in the mail.

See you on the 4th.
