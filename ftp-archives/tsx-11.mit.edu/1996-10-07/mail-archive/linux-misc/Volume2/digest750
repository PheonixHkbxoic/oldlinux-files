Quick tip: Add the following to your killfile.
        /doom/h:j

Another quick tip: DOOM can be considered a multi-platform game.
alt.games.doom exists. Use it.

You can use the usual COLOR_PAIR semantics on Linux. Did you remember to 
call start_color() after initscr() ???

If you want to display effect like bold, underline etc. as colors on the 
Linux console, you must redefine the terminfo (ncurses does NOT use termcap)
entries for these effects.

As far as I remember, the Esc sequences for color are
\E[30m --- \E[39m for foreground color and \E[40m --- \E[49m for background.

: True.

You can correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that the maximum partition
size for SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 is 2 gigabytes.  This can obviously be fixed
with striped disk drivers, etc, but consider that Auspex servers, running
SunOS 4.1.3, can only do 8 gigabytes per partition even with their volume
management.

This did not work.  I am using these key settings........

Subject: Partitioning Question
Date: 12 Sep 1994 18:09:47 GMT

So once I set my partitions (say 250 for Linux and 270 for DOS) using FIPS
or FDISK - is there a way to resize the Linux partition?  I mean, is there a
way other than backing up all the data on the Linux partition, deleting that
partition, then resizing the DOS partition, then remounting the Linux partition,
then restoring the data on it.

I've downloaded quite a bit of stuff for installing Linux.  I don't remember
exactly, but I think it was all the a,ap,x,xd,xv and a few other disks (all the
gnu stuff too).  All tolled, I think I've got about 40+.  The HOWTO says a
ROUGH estimate is about 2.5 megs per disk.  I'm just not sure how much to
allocate for this thing.  250 seems fine but I would love to get away with 200
so DOS would have more room to breathe.

Thanks,

DT

For your information:

It's not the speed of the electrons in a cable that counts (and which is
much smaller than the speed of light) but it's the speed of the
electromagnetic wave, which depends on material constants and the geometry.
In most common cables however, the signal speed is approximtely 2/3 of the
speed of light in vacuum.

The assumption that J.J. is making is that geeks use Linux and geeks
have input on what software a company buys.

This is somewhat farcical, in its assumptions:

1)      I am a geek (in the computer, not the Happy Days sense 8-)).

2)      I don't use Linux except in glancing (ie: I hardly ever compile
        any of the code from it, but I look at some of the code for
        various reasons, like writing a Linux execution class for an
        operating system I do use to run Linux binaries).

3)      I have little input on what my company buys.


On the other hand, if I were a student running Linux, I might carry my
prejudices into the workplace after graduation.

At the very least, the free software would not be in a competitive market
with non-free versions.

On the other hand, since I can run Linux binaries on my non-Linux machine,
one of these binaries could be WordPerfect.  8-).

An interesting lemma.

This would imply that if you have an Intel 486DX2/66 then you shouldn't buy
a Pentium/60 as the price/performance ratio will suck.

This is a Rick Kelly rule that everyone is free to flame:

There ain't no free lunch.  

I have had some exposure to the Intel ICC compiler that optimizes code

You see!  If you really want a popular OS, you really have to have some good 
games.  Never have I seen so many learn so much about linux all at once!

How many times do you think I was asked "Whass, uhh, I-P-uh-X?" when Doom came 
out for DOS/net (was it IPX?  I can't recall--I may be blocking this!)


Now, just to make it worse:  Doom needs sound support...  Oh, I've heard the 
machine guns and music and explosions galore, but I mean VOICE!  That's right, 
when I'm wandering around the Doom-scape, I wanna have a Mic plugged in to my 
PAS or SB and be able to beg for my life, or try to form alliances, or the 
like...

Does anybody have some info about the new Sony MiniDiscs (or whatever they

costing less than 10$ apiece; the controller will be also very low-cost
(400$?), maybe with floppy interface, maybe IDE.
They are supposed to come in volume before the end of the year.
I'm curious to know if someone heard the same rumors, and/or knows if and
