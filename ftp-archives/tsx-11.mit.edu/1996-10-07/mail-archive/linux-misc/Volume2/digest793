Hi,

I am interested in knowing what administration shells exist for Linux.
I've asked this question before, but received nearly no response at all.
I am interested only in distribution quality shells that exist on FTP
sites for general use.

Please!!! This is important!!! Please write to me if you know of any that
exist.

Thanks in advance,

Hmm, you *are* running the term daemon on both ends, right? :-)
And you're starting up the clients from the same account that started
the daemon (or running in shared mode)?

Apart from whether the hardware is better, currently under Linux the
kernel drivers for the Panasonic seem to be better than for
Mitsumi. The driver has been optimized for performance, up to 16
drives can be connected, PhotoCD is supported, and you can read the
digital data from audio CDs. It is also quite good at autoprobing for
the drive i/o address.

You need first to mount the floppy, before you can use it. So, you need
the floppy and an empty directory. Then

mount -t fstype /dev/fd? /directory

where fstype == msdos for dos disks, ext2 for ext2fs etc.
      fd? == the floppy drive device
      /directory == the directory where the floppy is to be mounted.

eg: mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /mnt

For more information, man mount

Yes, but keep a lookout for it. Likely be more Linux goodies to come

Subject: NCR53c810 alpha driver problem
Date: Tue, 20 Sep 1994 17:19:27 GMT


Need advice, I have a:

Genoa 486PCI-G ver. A motherboard
PCI SCSI controller with an NCR53c810 chip in PCI slot 1
        V3.0 SDMS BIOS (so it says )
Conner CFP1060s 1.05 Gig. SCSI drive

Using the bootdisk I got from tsx-11 /pub/linux/ALPHA/scsi/ncr53c810/
ncr_slack.3.gz, I get when booting:

SCSI1: at PCI bus 0, device 1, function 0
SCSI1: NCR53c810 at memory 0xfc800000, io 0xd000, irq 0
SCSI0: IRQ not free, detaching
scsi : 0 hosts
scsi : detected 0 SCSI disks  0 Tapes 0 CD-ROM dives total
scsi : 0 buffer total 0 bytes

I guess I need to know how I tell the controller to use a different IRQ.
This same setup works under DOS. 
Anyone else have this problem?

This is good marketing advice, but a bit short on netiquette IMHO.
"So they can see these too" is a polite way of putting it.  The point
is that the adverts are pushed down people's throats whether they want
them or not.  Put them in a separate group, so people can choose
whether to PAY REAL MONEY to read advertising.

BTW, I thought the Spire Technologies price list was particularly
blatant, seeming to have everything to do with selling general purpose
PC hardware and nothing to do with Linux.

There is a reason for this.  People don't want to pay to read adverts.
But this is not a reason to put adverts in the mainstream groups.

I am considering starting a BBS from my Linux system.  I looked at the sunsite

I would like to hear from anyone out there who is actually running a Linux
BBS about which software they use, along with the best/worst features, in an
attempt to narrow down the field I should consider.  I'd also like to know
why you chose the system that you use, and maybe even why you chose not to
use some others.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated.

Hi Travis,

   I'm pretty new to Linux myself...

   Try fdformat /dev/fd0 to format your diskette.  Or fdformat
/dev/fd0H1440.

   Try mount /dev/fd0 to 'mount' the filesystem.

   There is a wealth in the man pages for 'mount'  take a look at man
mount.

I'm reposting since I neglected to give some details

At LILO boot, the ramdisk default is used.  The system boots until it 
has detected the SCSI controller with the message:

        boot: loading ramdisk
        calibrating delay loop .... ok - 26.63 bogo mips at 33 mhz
[when set a 66 mhz 1.90 bogo mips shows up].
        failed  ( why did it fail ?)
        scsi0: adaptec 1542
        scsi: 1 host

The floppy drive is locked but no response from the keyboard.


The SCSI board is a Buslogic BT-946C fast SCSI PCI host adapter which 
according to the documentation "supports 1540-interface compatibility 
operating systems."  Is linux supported by this board ??

First, have you assigned an irq (for example irq 9) to the 
pci slot? Depending on your motherboard, this must be done
in the bios setup and/or via jumpers on the board.
If you still get this message, you have the same problem i
have had. Then there is a bug in your bios. The easiest
way around this(which i have done), is to hardcode your
interupt number in the kernel (put 'irq=9;'
in the kernel ncr-scsi-driver and build a new kernel).

Subject: NCR53c710 + COMPAQ works with Linux?
Date: 21 Sep 1994 09:39:08 GMT


I tried without success to install Linux on my COMPAQ ProSignia 5/60
(EISA ,32MB ,NCR 53c710, IBMOEM 1.05 GB Hard Drive).

Kernel : Version 1.11.49 (compiled with NCR53c7,8xx SCSI support)

But no SCSI hosts is detected.

Has someone running Linux on a COMPAQ with NCR53c710?
What I have to do?

Andreas
