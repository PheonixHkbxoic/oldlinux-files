Unfortunately, the term 'threading' is kind of used freely for both kinds 
of multi-tasking. In addition,one coudl proboly call a system like the 
Mac our current Windows, where there are multiple thrads of control but 
no pre-emption or time slicing (also called "cooperative multi-tasking") a 
multi-threaded, though not really a true multi-tasking system

Os/2 for what its worth is most linke UNIX of any of the other DOS 
repalcements.  It too provides a true pre-emptive time-sliced 
multi-tasking system.  (I don't know if 'light weight multi-tasking' is 
supported by teh system libraries or not...)

We use our own light-weight multi-tasking system for our games where I
work (Crystal Dynamics).  The advantages are that LWT (or 'threading') is
more efficient when switching between threads of control, and that all
threads can access the same memory.  This last is also its greatest 
weakness.. if different programs were allowed to access the same memory 
then one program's malfunction could cause a different one to 
inexplicably crash.  This is why both UNIX and OS/2 provide full 
multi-tasking at the system level.

I took the liberty of downloading it from ftp.XFree86.org and it is complete.

As XFree86.org is rather swamped -- it took me over an hour to get in -- so
you can give nastromo.catt.ncsu.edu a try, but I cannot promise any speed;
it is a 486DX50 w/4megs (at present.)

Well, for me, a big attraction of Linux in the first place was
to be able to run X.

There may eventually be a need for a special Linuix/XFree group,
soince there seem to be quite a few questions on that combination.

at thgis point dip hangs.  I have the lines:

Woah there!!!

The idea of a DX2 chip is an _internal_ clock double. IT uses some devices
to double the externl clock frequency, and the chip is designed for it....

It order to get a DX-40 to _go_ at 80Mhz you will need an external speed of
80Mhz which is currently not available, and besides doing this to the chip
would definatly fry it :)

I have a AMD DX-40 myself, and I changed to clock selector of the mother
board from 40Mhz to 50Mhz
, and now I have a DX-50 :) and without any glitches or over heating :) (I
also have always had a cpu cooler fan on it though :)

SO in basic answer to your question, No you can't. You will need a new chip
to do what you want.. But i would suggest you try the 50Mhz idea, it
increase all system aspects by 25% :) I'm happy.

Its probably a confusing add which is really selling you either a DX2-66

well, thats why its experimental! :)
As I understand it, the 'experimental' designation is for drivers that 
Yygdrasil has acquired but been unable to properly tst.  They are 
included 'at your own risk' as a courtesy by Yygdrasil
(NOTE;  This is just my impression. I don not, nor have I ever worked for 
Yygdrasil.)

I'm glad to hear that you got the DOS callbacks running, as I've 
suggested it as a solution to a number of people with 'chicken&egg' 
problems, but have never actually used it myself.  I woudl suspect your 
x-freeze problem is becuase it has to drop out of protected mode, and 
thus all multi-tasking ceases, when it talks to the drive.  Thats just my 
guess, but if it is ture I'm not sure that there is a good solution 
(except to get your proper driver working...)

It seems that the problem is in termcap entry length.
Command ``more'' has limit to termcap entry equal to 1024 (Macro TBUFSIZ
in more.c). If You increase this value ``more'' will run OK.

Yes - your terminal doesn't support ANSI.

Find out what terminal emulation it DOES do... and change the line in
inittab (?) to reflect this.

None of them passed with less than 35/49 exceptions in either run.

If someone wants to kick $50,000 out for a lab certification *after*

Of course this is all irrelevent since none of the three groups constitute
a legal entity that can entery into contracts.  And without Spec 1170

Are you running xdm?  On machines running slackware 2.0.1+xdm, more goes haywire.
It starts buffering about 5 chars before if actually does anything with them, and
then processes them all at once.  Unless I'm mistaken, more uses ncurses to do it's
work, and therein I believe lies the problem.

The meeting was a huge success. The room was full and a large number of
very experienced *nix folks showed up to talk and participate. Vernard
ran the event and I must say that he is the best at making a presentation
lively and interesting. He mentioned that he had sent out the notices for
the Linux meeting last week, but on the moderated groups there had been
some delays in the posting showing up.

The next meeting of the Atlanta Unix Users Group will be devoted to Linux
and a subgroup may be formed out of that organization for the Linux types. 
This will be a really good meeting also so I hope to see y'all there.
