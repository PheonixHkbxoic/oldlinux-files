Indeed.  Frankly, *IMHO*, plain TeX is far, far easier than LaTeX.  But
then, I know how to use macros, and I do use them quite a bit.  I don't
have very many typesetting commands in most TeX docs (except those that
get really strange...but those would be just as bad with LaTeX, too).

I always found LaTeX to be too limiting---it took away things I was used
to (from plain TeX), and it never seemed to give anything back.
Fortunately, in the TeX vs LaTeX battle, it's all a matter of personal
preference---you use the one that *YOU* like (and if a publisher won't
take the one you like, IMHO, you go to another publisher, as there are
usually plenty of them around who will!).

At work, most of the docs for the project I'm on are done with FrameMaker.
I modified my existing (plain) TeX macros to fit the format used for all
of our documentation (took about 3 minutes), and the system/network admin
docs are written in TeX.  The tech writers (who do all the other docs) are
considering TeX.....  Well, if they do, the macros are ready for 'em!  :-)

I would re-direct followups to comp.text.tex, but this is a subject
that, on that newsgroup, pre-dates the age of the dinosaurs, so I
think I'll spare my fellow comp.text.tex readers the ``trouble'' of
adding another KILL-file entry.

TeX isn't either of the above.  It isn't GPL software by any stretch of
the imagination.  It also isn't public domain.  It is freeware, and it
is also copyrighted software.  Donald Knuth (creator of TeX/METAFONT)
holds the copyright.  Basically, his intention is to maintain control
over what is called TeX and METAFONT, not to limit distribution.

TeX is freely available for anonymous ftp.  For information on where you
can get a copy, look in either the FAQ or FAQ Supplement for comp.text.tex
(I never can remember which one has this info!) for details on the nearest
CTAN site.

There are, of course, ways that you can buy TeX, and spend a fortune doing
so, but there isn't any requirement that you do so (unless it's a local
one, i.e., company policy against anything that doesn't cost at least a
small fortune...and I used to work for a company with a policy very much
along those lines, so if that's the case, I feel sorry for you).

If you want TeX for UNIX, it's easy---get the WEB source and web2c, and
you're set.  If you want TeX for msdog, you're still in good shape---get
emTeX, read the docs, re-read the docs, and install (while reading the
docs yet again).  As I recall (and it's been a *LONG* time), emTeX was a
bit rough to install compared to TeX on UNIX (which is a breeze, if you
just follow instructions).

Oh well, it's time to get on with other things....  Later,

following trial, Intel LOST. I hear it was due to the naming system that
they used. It made the chips generic in the eyes of the court. That is why
there is no 80586, and we have the Pentium. 

As far as reliability, the AMD 486DX2/66 is an exact duplicate of Intel's

less than Intel, I am a buyer!

 FvwmAudio(1.0)                                               FvwmAudio(1.0)
                                 Mar 28 1994



 NAME
      FvwmAudio - the FVWM Audio module

 SYNOPSIS
      FvwmAudio is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.
      From within the .fvwmrc file, FvwmAudio is spawned as follows:

      Module FvwmAudio

      or from within an fvwm pop-up menu:

      Popup "Module-Popup"
           Title     "Modules"
           Module    "GoodStuff"    GoodStuff
           Module    "NoClutter"    FvwmClean
           Module    "FvwmIdentify" FvwmIdent
           Module  "Banner"        FvwmBanner
           Module    "Debug"        FvwmDebug
           Module  "Audio"          FvwmAudio
           Module  "Pager"         FvwmPager 0 3
      EndPopup


 DESCRIPTION
      The FvwmAudio module communicates with the Fvwm window manager to bind
      audio sounds to window manager actions. Different audio queues may be
      assigned to any window manager action. FvwmAudio can be used with any
      independent audio player, and therefore requires no special audio
      library APIs of its own. Simple in its design, it merely binds the
      audio filenames to particular actions and forks off the audio player
      program with the appropriate filename when that action occurs.

      FvwmAudio can also have builtin support for the rplay library.


 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
      FvwmAudio reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm(1) reads when it starts
      up, and looks for certain configuration options:


      *FvwmAudioPlayCmd /usr/bin/X11/demos/auplay
           This determines the independent audio player program that will
           actually play the sounds.  If the play command is set to
           builtin-rplay then the builtin rplay support will be used.  For
           example:

           *FvwmAudioPlayCmd builtin-rplay


      *FvwmAudioDir /usr/lib/sounds
           Specifies the directory to look for the audio files.  This option

 FvwmAudio(1.0)                                               FvwmAudio(1.0)
                                 Mar 28 1994



           is ignored when rplay is used.


      *FvwmAudioDelay 5
           Specifies that sound events will only be played if they occur at
           least 5 seconds after the previous event.  Sounds events that
           occur during the delay period are ignored.  This option is useful
           if you don't want several sounds playing at the same time.  The
           default delay is 0 which disables the audio delay.


      *FvwmAudioRplayHost hostname
           Specifies what host the sounds will play on.  The hostname can
           also be an environment variable such as $HOSTDISPLAY.  This
           option is only valid with builtin rplay support.


      *FvwmAudioRplayPriority 0
           Specifies what priority will be assigned to the sounds when they
           are played.  This option is only valid with builtin rplay
           support.


      *FvwmAudioRplayVolume 127
           Specifies what volume will be assigned to the sounds when they
           are played.  This option is only valid with builtin rplay
           support.


      *FvwmAudio window-manager_action audio_filename
           Binds particular window manager actions to sound queues.

                                 Mar 28 1994



 INVOCATION
      The invocation method was shown in the synopsis section. No command
      line invocation is possible. FvwmAudio must be invoked by the fvwm
      window manager.


 BUGS
      It's REALLY noisy when fvwm starts and restarts.


 COPYRIGHTS
      This module is heavily based on a similar Fvwm module called FvwmSound
      by Mark Boyns. FvwmAudio simply takes Mark's original program and
      extends it to make it generic enough to work with any audio player.
      The concept for interfacing this module to the Window Manager, is
      original work by Robert Nation.

PC/IX - it wasn't very fast or efficient but then in comparison to a PDP11

Yep and neither OLE nor CORBA appear to have real world performance.

Subject: Beautifying Linux/Xfree
From: bailey9@muvms6.wvnet.edu (Andy Bailey)
Date: 5 Oct 94 14:11:41 EDT


 Hi, 
   Over the past year now, I have spent lots (moist likely far too much) time
playing with Linux. A great deal of this time has been spent of adjusting
look and feel aspects of the OS. Actually I dont think I should say OS, since
Slackware is really what I'm using. I'm not much of a low-level programmer, so
the things I've tried to do to help out the Linux effort are mostly
documentation, or fit & finish projects.
   The one I have been spending a great deal of time with lately is making a
default system.fvwmrc file. Fvwmrc seems to be a nice manager for a new X user.
Witrh the default configuration, however, you get a rather plain color scheme
and menu set. The menus dont provide any incredible functions, but they do
work.
  I've spent some time playing with NeXTStep, which of course has me drooling
for some nice icons and colors with XFree on my Linux box. I realize, however,
that many people want a minimum of excess "cheese" (As I like to refer to
needless ornaments on a GUI desktop). What I would like to do is discuss, with
some other interested people, various configurations that they are using for
fvwm, that they feel provide unique functionality. Also, since fvwm provides
"modules", it might be possible to set about making some interesting new ones.
  
  I think more users might be attracted to Linux, if some really nice
out-of-box configs like this were available, as well as some new icons and
fonts. Perhaps some scripts (maybe tcl/tk based) that allow easy
addition/removal of icons from the desktop. (I know its simple just the edit
the config file to add/remove stuff, but this would be better looking)

  Its just a wild idea, but I'd like to hear from anyone whos interested as
well

There exists a free version of INGRES for Linux. I'm using it and it works fine.
The file is called ingres04.lzh and you should find it on various ftp-sites.
