Good question.  More delving into the Crynwr (Assembler!) source should 
turn up the answer.  I do know that the memory address range for the NIC 
is configured with the PS/2 "Reference Disk".  I have it setup for 16KB 
access from C8000-CBFFF, and 8KB ROM from CC000-CDFFF.  It seems that the 
Linux SMC and WD drivers have yet to put it there...

I am pretty sure it was the TX register.  I will nab the message out of 
the syslog/debug files tomorrow, and post it here.

Glad to hear that.  Further delving into the Crynwr driver shows that it 
has code to read one of the NIC registers, which has a bit indicating 
that it is on an MCA machine.  The Crynwr code then proceeds to program a 
bit in configuration register 5 (0x04 I think) that somehow enables NIC 
interrupts onto the MCA bus.  Without doing so, the MCA bus will 
apparently not see IRQ's from the board.

>Is the ethernet address correctly detected?

Unsure.

>Are you receiving any packets at all?  Even errors?  Check /proc/net/dev.

No packets are seen at all to date.  However, I am going to switch from 
the 1.0.9 kernel to 1.1.xx tomorrow, and start over with this 
debugging.  I have *tried* defining EI_DEBUG to > 2, but do not see any 
messages in /var/adm/syslog or debug...

>What addresses can the board end up at?

The usual - C0000, CC000, D0000, etc.  IT is configured through PS/2 setup.

I've also heard that lee-nukes (long 'e' and long 'u') is the
preferred pronunciation in some parts.  I haven't yet listened to the
.au file of Linus saying the word.

Haven't seen this mentioned anywhere yet, so ...

I just received my Oct 94 issue of PC Plus magazine here in the
UK.  There is PC Plus super CD with, among other things, Slackware 
Linux 2.0, taped to the front.  Price 3.95 pounds sterling. 
My friend bought the last 2 copies in our local W H Smith, so

I'm not sure abotu Linux, but i know many Unices reserve about that much 
disk space so the system can handle overflows efficiently and 
gracefully.  I wouldn't mess with it unless you are SURE you know what 
you are doing, or your data is not important to you...

Ah, this one I'm pretty sure i knwo the answer to.  When thge system goes 
down unexpectedly, files that are open and being editied can be lost.  
Some editors (such as vi) know how to set it up so that a version can be 
found there when you next come up.

I bought mine for $30.00.  The moral of this story, I guess, is shop around.

Take the editor of your choice and delete all the pages you've already
printed from the postscript file.  It's fairly easy to find them (look

"My oponnent is a crook... and I HATE crooks!"

This kind of logic works in politics, but nto in debate, law, or 
intellegent conversation, my friend.  What you have done is to label 
Stahlman yourself with a label he woudl deney, and then decry himfor YOUR 
label.  Unless you can PROVE that Stahlman is trying to copyright an 
interface (something his OTHER group- the Leauge for Programmer Freedom 
actively campaigns AGAINST), your argument here is so much hot air.

You havent proved the first point, yet, I'm afraid, to most of our 
satisfaction.

Subject: Patch to make MSS work on PSS sndcards
Date: 1 Oct 1994 16:30:25 GMT

Hi all.  Here is a small patch to make a PSS soundcard (like the Cardinal
DSP-16 that I have) initalize properly so one can use the MSS chipset on it
in Linux without booting MesSy-DOG first.  I've used it for a few days now 
without problem, and I sent it to Hannu so that hopefully the next release 
will be fixed if his new PSS driver is not ready by then.

When you configure your sound support, make sure to add BOTH PSS and MSS 
support.  There is a file in the sound dir that will tell you how to do that
(I don't remember which one). The PSS card's MSS support will be initalized 
to what you specify for MSS I/O address, DMA and IRQ.  When you boot the 
new kernel, you should see something like...

Init PSS/WSS addr 530 IRQ 1 DMA 7
snd11 <PSS-ESC614> at 0x220 irq 10 drq 3
snd10 <MS Sound System (AD1848)> at 0x530 irq 7 drq 1 

Have fun!
