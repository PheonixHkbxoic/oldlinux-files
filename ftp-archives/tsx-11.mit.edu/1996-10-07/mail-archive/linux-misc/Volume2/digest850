        one of these as part of its OpenLook system; you might want to
        take a look.
        * WYSIWIG front end for LaTeX (or ptroff). - would be a big

An easy to install Linux would be nice; but try not to cut back too
far on the the utilities &c that are considered `standard unix'.

DOS users don't care about this. As long as their cardfile utility can read
their cardfile, they win. With OLE, this is becoming even less of an issue in

If you don't include many of the Unix utilities, you're not including a
powerful scripting shell. Shells have essentially no usefull abilities
apart from running other programs. Besdides, if your target audience needs
a .BAT->.sh convertor, do you think they'll bother learning to program sh
directly?

DOS doesn't have "rm -rf /". Those 8 little letters can ruin your day. Unix
gives power, and it's a good idea to keep the safety mechanisms if you're
going to keep the power.

If you want real scripting, don't forget uniq, sort, cut, and tr at a minimum.

Good luck with getting Dosemu configured. Isn't everything for it compiled

I seriously doubt this would really be necessary. It's takes a lot of disk

What about development stuff, and how are you going to configure X?

Have you ever looked at MCC? Please do before you get to far. MCC is old
and it could stand some updating. I think combining MCC, TinyX, fancy
installation scripts, and UMSDOS would be a definite winner. I've been
wanting someone to do that for a long time now. Take a look at the
ConfigXF86 package as well - it's not optimal, but it's a lot better
a newbie then editing XConfigs.

When I installed MCC the first time I added TinyX and had a complete Unix
system in about 17MB of disk space - that's with kernel sources, a C
compilerm and networking.

Before you run off and create a new distribution, please look at what others
have done - a lot of thought were put into both MCC and TinyX and they
are both pretty well done. You might help more newbies by:

1) Writing a good sysadm shell. Look sat IBM's "smit" for an example. Smit
   is the only good thing about AIX.
2) Write a easy to use configuration program for DOSEMU.
3) Figure out a better way of configuring X. A program that would detect
   what kind of video card you have would be a good start.

Doing WIT could be very bad for Linux if it isn't done right, so please be
carefull. I don't know why you don't want to include full *client* side
networking if you're going to include SLIP. It's much easier to setup
a Unix box as a telnet client then make SLIP do anything. You're also
ignoring term completely.

Dangerous -- at the very least, have two users -- root and a "Joe
User" account, like NeXT shipped with.  You can auto-login the regular
user and have him/her su to do sysadmin stuff.

Mosaic is a must if you include slip -- it would also make a good
browser for local help files (ala Windows Help?).

No reason to screw people who do have a SCSI disk -- it wouldn't be
hard to probe for this & install a kernel with SCSI drivers if
necessary.

Hmm.  If people think they're getting a Unix-compatible system, they
might be a bit upset confused when someone gives them a nifty program
& they can't compile it.  Similarly, I'm not sure that it would be a
good idea to leave out any of the standard unix commands.

If Solaris takes the 4.4 BSD route it has a linked list of addresses for
each address family. This worries me for performance reasons. Linux can
happily do what you want with the dummy inteface (and you can add more
dummy interfaces 8)).

        ifconfig dummy  my.other.addr.ess up
        arp -s my.other.addr.ess MY:ET:HE:RN:ET:NM

The '/etc/magic' supplied with Slackware2.0, and probably other distributions,

I couldn't take Juana's idea, either.  But I do have something in
mind:

Is it possible to make a "Instant DOS-installable Linux"?  What if
somebody

1) installs slackware on a Umsdos partition
2) Installs Loadlin under DOS
3) zip the whole X:\Linux and X:\Loadlin directory into LINUX.ZIP (I'm
against .tar.gz here because it is easier to get zip under DOS)

Now somebody else

4) downloads LINUX.ZIP from some DOS site
5) unzip it
6) runs an installation program which selects the right kernel, maybe
setup a few files like loadlin, /etc/fstab and Xconfig, and moves the
files into the correct places
7) run loadlin

Whoa! Instant Linux!

Admittedly this would be slower than a Linux running under ext2, but
the installation would be less scary to the new user because
everything is done under DOS up until the last step, where they type
in a command and find themselves get right into Linux.  And it is
totally uninstallable, too - just delete the whole X:\Linux tree.

Now I'm very satisfied with my native Linux system, so no need to
flame me, this is just one of those interesting thoughts that have
been nagging me for quite a while.

I'd like to know if somebody has tried this.  Or, any reason why this
can/cannot be done would be interesting.

Perhaps I should enumerate some of the reasons:

 1.  Printing requires a separate suid root daemon with its own
 configuration program.  Why can't they just print through lpd
 like everyone else?

 2.  Although the program is nominally X/Motif (it creates a window,
 has pull-down menus, etc.), it is still basically a text program.
 It is clearly text-oriented.  For example, choosing "load" from
 the file menu results in WP's text file load screen taking over
 the window from the document, just like it does under DOS.  No
 Motif filebox.  This shows more laziness than anything else,
 I suspect, but it still blows.

 3.  It crashes.  A lot.  Usually just locks up, but sometimes the 
 window dies while the process stays behind.  When this happens
 (once a week, with heavy use) the process is somehow unkillable. The only way
 to get rid of it is to reboot.  And you'd better do that, too,
 since if you don't, and try to start a new instance of WP, odds
 are 50-50 that the whole OS will crash, right down to the PROM
 monitor.  Only piece of user-space code I've ever seen which can
 crash Ultrix.  I suspect the suid root piece must have something
 to do with this.

 4.  Strange screen effects.  The scrollbars don't work right.  They
 don't show your correct relative position in the document, and you
 can't scroll all the way to the bottom of the document.  You get
 about 85% of the way there, and suddenly the document jumps back
 to about 50%.

  There are many more, but these are sufficient to damn it internally
in my mind.

This is difficult for me to do, as my employer doesn't authorize me
to spend any money.  At any rate, I don't want to bring this horrible
beast home to my Linux box.  Note though, that I am aware that 5.1 on
SunOS 4.1.3 is dramatically better, although still not perfect.
