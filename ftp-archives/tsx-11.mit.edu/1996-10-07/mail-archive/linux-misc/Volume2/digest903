Heh, not even that for me except maybe DOOM, play. Most other
applications that I've ever needed to use that weren't readily
available on unix as is or in a workaround form (i.e. even programming
the darn thing myself), I've found to run much much better on Macs w/
much fewer system crashes, etc, than their Windows counterpart.

For multi-request operating systems (like Linux), you want the 1542.
It's a bus-master with a local processor.  SCSI requests are processed
without CPU intervention and are done in the background.  The 1522 is
a dumb PIO chip which requires the system CPU to make the data transfers.

Besides, the 1522 driver is async (non-synchronous) SCSI only last time
I checked.  Might have changed by now.

This sounds like a VERY old BSD bug that was around when I was in college.  
There WAS a fix for it.  Anyone remember what it was?  This is 
potentailly a SCRAY bug for anyoen on the net, as all UNIXsecurity is

Hello,

I am thinking about buying the Ensoniq Soundscape sound card, but I
want to make sure it will work with Linux.  Ensoniq says that the
Soundblaster compatibility is done at a software level, so I am not
convinced that the Soundblaster driver will definitely work.  The
harware-howto does not mention the card.

So does anyone have any experience with this card?  Also, how about
the Creative Labs AWE32, or the MediaVision Pro-3D?

thanks,
Kevin

        You are not referring to a "new release", but rather to the
old Summer 1994 release (the current one is Fall 1994).  When we
discovered that kermit was unfree, the manual had already gone to
press, but the CD's hadn't.  The Fall 1994 manual cover does not have
this problem.

        Thanks for pointing out the .kermrc file, I have removed it
from the tree that will be used to make the next release.

I can confirm this to a degree.  I was a beta tester of this server
(for FreeBSD), and it's undoubtedly faster than the XFree S3 server:

Orchid F1280+ (1MB, ISA):
XF86_S3 (XFree-2.1)     Xaccel-1.1
63k xStones             155k xStones

Given the quality of the software, I'd say the $199 isn't too
unreasonable.  They also offer a 50% student discount.  I'll be buying
a copy as soon they release Motif for FreeBSD (which shouldn't be
long).  Just incase you're wondering, I am in no way affiliated with
X-Inside Inc., except as a soon-to-be customer :-).

You need to find a spell checking program that is compatible with `spell'.
I use gnu ispell-4.0, which is the obsolete version of ispell, but is
compatible with spell.  ispell-3.x is the newer, better version (don't ask),
but is not compatible.  You should still be able to find ispell-4.0 on gnu
sites like sunsite.unc.edu.

Good luck,

Here are some more info for the problem that I've posted
earlier.  Upon reading the "EXT2FS-FAQ" and doing some more
testing, I've discovered that my superblock is still good.
I use the command: "e2fsck -b superblock" to see that the
file system is still in good shape.  However, the following
error message is shown when the kernel attemp to mount the
root filesystem.
        .
        .
        .
        ll_rw_block: Trying to read nonexisting block device 0801

        .
        .
        Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 08:01



Then the system freeze.  Now if I boot from my default boot floppy
disk, it can mount the root fs and I can access the data on it without
any problem.  Any hints as to what's going on?

Subject: X Server Terminates --- Caught Signal 11
Date: 6 Oct 1994 18:21:34 -0400

I'm running Linux 1.1.50 with (I think) XFree 3.0 version. When I do some
operations, my server used to die and report "Caught Signal 11. Terminating".
        Initially, I was not able to repeat it. Now I think I can. I login
to my Sun (running 4.1.3) through ppp. Set the environment variable to
my linux display. If I invoke "cm" (the calendar manager program), it 
(meaning the server) just dies. 
        I know that "cm" requires some "open-look" fonts which are not
available on my server. But I doubt that is causing the server to crash.
        Any pointers as what it may be? Thanks in advance.

If there was a default "standard" GUI available on most distributions
it would be possible to write a introduction to Linux (a la Welch)
from a GUI perspective.  Whether this is a good idea or not depends on
your ideas about how to teach Unix.  IMHO, I think you can wean newbies
off of the mainstream PC OSes more easily with a good GUI and then let
them gradually cut their teeth with more and more command-line.

In short, I think the original poster's idea is good, but he should
definitely look around first and consolidate as much "good stuff" that
is already available as possible.  It might be a good idea to make a
GUI "mini-distribution" (package) that just contains a standardized
GUI setup (GREAT + fvwm + customized *rc files + selected GUI apps).

Good idea.

Neat!

Subject: serial console possible?
Date: Sat, 8 Oct 1994 03:39:27 GMT

Is it possible to assign the console to com1 or com2?  

I asked this question before in comp.os.linux.admin and got one response.  The
response I received told me about the ability to have lilo talk through one of
the serial ports.  SO, if anyone has any more info concerning a serial console,
please let me know.

I have an AMD 486DX-40.  Any news on an add-in from AMD to turn this into a
486DX2-80, or do I need to buy a whole new chip?

 A friend would like to run a free *nix on his Mac powerbook with a 68040 chip.
We found a reference to MacLinux.  Is anything happening with it? If so where
can it be found?

thanks

AND ME!!!!!  1TS K00L!!!!!11!!  

Maybe Harald "Linux counter" should start collecting the statistic.  I
don't see that there is enough linux-and-X-specific software for a
split to happen.  Sure I run X (there's one data point for you :-) but
of all the things I regularly run under it, only emacs and xdvi open
their own window

Have you tried the emtex previewer under dosemu?  I keep hearing that
various people have managed to get various dos extenders to run with
it, but don't know the details.  I realise it's not exactly an ideal
solution, but surely neither is rebooting?

Not sure what you mean.  Does the Fvwm module Icon Manager do that?
Is the "IconBox" param in .fvwmrc what you want?

The FvwmSave module is supposed to do this.  I recommend the much
smarter xtoolplaces, part of olvwm.

Date: 8 Oct 1994 08:52:25 -0700

I just downloaded XFree 3.1. Doom was playable before (Under XFree 2.1, 
it was a little choppy), but now it is EXACTLY as fast as the DOS version. 
I am running a 486DX33, and a VLB cirrus 5426 based video card.

Heck, it's even pretty fast in the double pixel mode!

Definite browniew points for the XFree team...Good work!
