Not quite.  Most UNIXes (including Linux) are not multi-threaded at all.

Multi-tasking is simply multiple "tasks" (call them threads, call them
processes, it doesn't matter) executing simultaneously.  Traditionally,
the smallest schedule-able "task" is a process.  If you want two
things to be able to execute simultaneously, you make two processes.

Multi-threading extends this such that you can have multiple threads
per process, and each thread can be scheduled on its own.  If one
thread in a process performs a read() and has to wait, other threads
can continue executing.

The difference between a "thread" and a "process" in a multi-threaded
system is that a "thread" shares the same address space as other
threads in the same process.  With processes, in order to share memory,
you need to use something like the SYSV shm*() family of syscalls.

I think you're thinking of what Sun calls "light weight processes",
which is a hokey pseudo-threaded system for non-multithreading kernels.
Under LWP, system calls in one thread block all threads in the process
from executing.

There are thread libraries for Linux (pthreads) that will allow this
sort of multithreading for Linux, but don't confuse that with a
multithreading operating system.  (Like Solaris)  These are called
"user-level" threads, and are not nearly as useful as one with
a kernel that supports threads.  (and if your kernel supports real
threads, you can compile the pthread library to do real threading)

Hi all !

Did anybody get a Spea Mercury P64 graphic card combined with
XFree3.1 to work ?? I tried the xf86config programm to config
the card but no modes worked. If I start the server manually
with X -bpp 32 (X is linked to XF86_S3) sometimes I get a correct
screen, sometimes not. Even -bpp 16 or -bpp 8 sometimes work, but
I can't tell how or when or why.
I played with the settings for ChipSet, ClockChip and some
of these settings, but none of them worked out. Some comments
are found in the manuals for the S3 cards and the used chips
but none of the recommended settings give a better result.
The RamDAC is configured correctly, the card is recognized as a
S3 Vision 964, so everything basic is correct.

It seems that the card sometimes gets the timing right, sometimes
not.

Anybody any idea ??

Thanks in advance for any help

Everyone has different experiences.  I've found Yygdrasil very easy to

You and I are in agreement on this, Richard. Linux is in desparate need
of it's own wordprocessor, not a typesetter.

The problem is what's be best/fastest way to accomlish this. Some observations

1) Must be native. Until we reach a point where emulation is standard and
   stable in Linux distributions we need a unpack and go package.
 
2) Simple. Unfortunately that means that Richard's pet peeve - multiligualness
   must be put on the back burner. Only the most used functions need to
   be available (font styles and sizing, basic paragraph formatting, tables 
   among others) must be available. The obscure, rarely used but "must be
   in there for completeness sake" kinds of functions that all the commercial
   Wordprocessors have need to be carefully evaluated and left off if a
   demonstrated need for it is not shown.

3) Multi-layered interface. I know GUI's are cool. I know that WYSIWYG is hot.
   But frankly a GUI/WYSIWYG interface isn't much good when I'm sitting
   in front of a terminal, or telnetting over a slow link, or when I'm 
   stuck on a 386-25 Laptop with 4 MB of memory, or even the
   rare occasions when I have to use a DOS/Windows machine. Oftentimes it's
   not useful or feasible to use a GUI/WYSIWYG interface. However I agree
   and admit that GUI/WYSIWYG is useful. So I think a multilayered Text/(S)VGA/
   X interface would be useful. That way the product can be used over the 
   variety of physical interfaces that Linux, X, and networking makes 
   available.

Folks neither TeX, groff, or another other typesetter, or emulated WP like
WordPerfect under DOS/WINDOWS or SCO is going to cut it here. A Wordprocessor
is such a critical resource in a computing system that Linux has the potential
of never making inroads beyond its supposed "hacker/Unix junkie" clientele.

Linux needs it's own Wordprocessor. Something simple, elegant, and moderately
powerful. And we need it yesterday.

The question is how to accomplish this?

In some cases, the old chip must be yanked and the new chip inserted in
its place.  So it updates a 486-33 computer system to a 486-66, but the
chip itself is replaced.

I know there are (for some systems) ways to upgrade w/o yanking the old
chip.  Does anyone know more about these, or was I misinformed?

The following is just my guess, and I don't know whether there is workaround...

First, DOOM in DOS have the permission to do anything on the machine, but Linux
one can't. The DOS one actually use DMA to transfer data from memory to DMA,
while the Linux one call X to display an image. What it means, with shared
memory, is to copy the data to an area provided by X, then wait X to find
whether any clipping is necessary (e.g. if another window obscure the DOOM
window that shouldn't be displayed), and finally the X server will copy that to
the video memory after a color mapping. That long process should be the
bottleneck of linxdoom.

Second, DOOM in DOS is near to the sole memory user. In Linux, it must compete
with all other clients, like the Xserver, the 4 virtual console, the window
manager, all system daemons, etc., and must also compete CPU time with them.
This is another bottleneck of the linxdoom.

That means that DOS is unique in providing such an environment. Even SGI doom
can't beat it. (However, the superb computational speed and pipeline of the SGI
should be able to compensate the problem completely)

Hi Jacob,

I don't know which getty the best; personally I use agetty.

In /etc/inittab you insert a line like
d1:56:respawn:/sbin/agetty -mt60 38400,19200,9600,4800 /dev/ttyS1

(Several baudrates enables baudrate switching, when the autobaud function (-m)
 failes)

Now you have to setup your modem to "pick up the phone". On Hayes-compatible
modems you do that with
ATS0=n where n is the number of rings the modems should wait before it picks
up the phone (you will most probably want to set n to 0).
You can send the command using sezon,kermit or minicom...
For me "echo -nf ATS0=0" works, but I heard that doesn't for everyone.

That's all I did to set it up, and it works for dialin and dialouts;
problems may arise when using UUCP on the same line. In that case you should
switch over to uugetty (or getty_ps)...

good luck,

Lars

Subject: Re: Beautifying Linux/Xfree
Date: 7 Oct 1994 22:55:04 -0500

I don't like the idea of a menu to set the appearance of X because it
would be too limiting.  What I think would be more helpful would be 
something like a BeautifyX-HOWTO, or something similar.  For example,
think of all of the different neat things there are to put in the root
window.  One can run xearth (my favorite!), run xfishtank, load a 
picture, set the solid color, and no doubt many other things that 
I don't know about.  A menu couldn't solve the problem.  The closest
it could come would be to set up a prompt for the command to bring
up the root window, which defeats the purpose of a menu.

I think that a HOWTO file would be truly useful.  It would be more of
a tips file, actually.  I'm sure that there are dozens of neat little
toy programs that many people run, as well as several useful programs,
that would really enhance X.  By pooling all of our experiences into
a file, a user could choose exactly what he wanted to do.

One thing that would be neat would be a list of nice color combinations.
Sometimes I see these discussed and I often test them out and like
them enough to incorporate them enough into my configuration.  And
whenever I add a new program to my configuration, I'm at a loss to
think of a new color combination.

This could cover so many things like this.  For example, what about
setting up FvwmSound?  Which sounds are nice tied to which events?
Under xearth what angle of the earth looks the nice?  What programs are
useful to put on the GoodStuff bar?  Which clocks look nice and how can
they be configured?  Which monitor programs are useful to include
on startup?  There are so many questions like this and I'm sure
everyone has his preferences, but we would all learn from others
tastes and incorporate them as our own.

A menu program works under MS-Windows because everything is configured
by the OS.  Under X, though, most visual things are determined by
individual user programs which have nothing in common, so it would
be very difficult to have a menu aided configuration.  This is why
I think a file containing experienced users' tips and experiences
would be far more useful.
