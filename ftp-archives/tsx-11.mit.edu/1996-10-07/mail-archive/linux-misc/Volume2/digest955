I started out with a 386SX/16, 4 megs RAM, and a Cyrix math coprocessor,
and ran Linux on it quite nicely for sometime. Although I upgraded to 8
megs of RAM sometime ago, I still use a 386SX/16; and since it is my
only machine I do everything on it - news/mail processing, compiling, and
whatever else that I do.

FWIW, notepad becomes rather useless as the user progresses. Perhaps it's
easy, perhaps it's suitable for small changes to files (which happen to be
small, of course) but I wouldn't want to use it. What's wrong with vi? I
know it has a steeper learning curve than does Notepad, but one doesn't
have to learn all of vi's commands at once. And, the number of needed
commands that you need to do most typical edits in vi is probably roughly
the same as those in Notepad.

So, stick with vi. People won't need to relearn when they find out that a
Notepad-like editor can't do the editing that they need.

:       1. a word processor: maybe similar to "write";

ez is quite likely superior to write. Personally I prefer document
formatting programs such as troff/TeX over word processors. The reason is
simple - the editing process (i.e, moving cursor around, deleting &
inserting text etc.) should be divorced from the word processing process
(flushing text, centering, etc.) The reason for this is simple - in my
experience with DOS/Windows, one usually finds nice word processors which
excel in the processing department but are limited in the editing
department.
 
:       2. a spreadsheet: similar to "quattro pro dos";

While 'sc', 'oleo' and 'xspread' are nice, they just don't look as nice as
do the DOS spreadsheets.  I agree with this point mostly for the reason
that I've used DOS spreadsheets so much that touch-typing 123-style
commands is second nature, but not so with things like oleo (although they
do use emacs-style keystrokes for some things, which is a win).

:       3. a paint program: similar to "paintbrush";

xpaint does a rather good job.

:       4. a draw program: something the drawing package in "amipro";
:       5. a pim / calendar: something better than "calendar", but simpler
:          than "organiser";
:       6. a database: like DBase 3;.

There are databases (but not like dbase) for linux such as Postgres. I
don't use them. For most needs, I'm not sure databases are as necessary
under Unix, since you can use all the unix text-processing tools (that are
largely nonexistent under DOS) to manage data.

: they would need to have certain abilities and properties:

:       a. a "common look and feel" (which one ? hell, pick a popular

Well, there's plenty of that type of thing common in the X-windows world,
such as Athena widgets, Motif, etc.

I _hate_ proprietary data formats. Flat ascii is preferable - it's likely
much easier, for instance, to generate a sc-spreadsheet file with filters,
shell scripts, or C than it is to generate something in a DOS spreadsheet
format.

But since this cancer is so prevalent under DOS, some data interchange
format is a necessity. Flat Ascii doesn't cut it usually -- I've had quite
a few problems reading Ascii files into WP for instance.

GENERAL INFO:
In the Owner's Manual, there should be an appendix with HP PCL Printer
Command Summary, which in turn should have a section under Printer Control,
called Line Termination. The last entry of that section is the relavant one.
It indicates sending, with the escape character represented by Ec,
Ec&k3G
to the printer before printing.

SPECIFICS:
In practice, I have to send that escape sequence every time I bring the
printer online, which is usually every time I turn it on. To be on the safe
side you should have the sequence sent before every print job.

To generate the sequence is easy.

echo -e "\033[&k3G"

is one way

#include <stdio.h>
void main(){
printf("\x01b\x026\x06b\x033\x047");
}

is another.

The fact remains that under the copyright legislation Paramont does not

law and any subsequent posters (whether or not they were the ones who 
stole the script) are also in violation.  Paramont's loss is irrelevant.

However, if you do want to consider loss (say for example if Paramont was 
to sue the poster of the script in tort), the amount of loss would only 
be relevant to the amount of damages awarded.  All Paramont would have to 
prove to be awarded judgment would be some loss.  All it would have to 
prove is that one person who might have purchased the script or bought a 
ticket to the movie did not do so because of the unauthorized 
publication.  AND, I think even YOU would have to agree that this would 
be an easy thing for Paramont to do (I dare say that it might be the law 
that Paramont would only have to prove potential loss, but I'm not 
certain on that point and therefore do not assert it here).

Date: 16 Oct 1994 07:34:40 -0600
Reply-To: hseaver@nyx.cs.du.edu

    I'm doing a class project to try to convince various grade and high
 school officials that they would be much smarter to buy a 586 and 100
 dumb terminals and run Linux/Xwindows/Motif than buying 100 macs. Or even
 just running Linux in text mode, since mostly what school computers are
 used for is just word processing anyway, and have a few macs or whatever
 for the other stuff. 
    So here's my question: How much RAM and how much swap space does a 586
 need (or a 486 even) to run 100 terminals, either in text mode or Xwin
 mode?  And can I even run Xwin on dumb terminals? Also, does anyone know
 of any good cheap vga res terminals w/color? Last time I looked, a few
 years ago, the cheapest was about $800. Also, what would you use for 
 ports for that many terminals?
 
 Thanx.

    You've got to be kidding! Number One -- a hundred Macs is a 1/4 
million dollars. The problem is that -- if you haven't noticed -- the
school systems in this country are broke. They need new solutions,

     Number Two -- you obviously are very new to the unix
world. If you take a look around, you will find that 90% of unix end
users are clueless computer illiterates -- secretaries, file clerks, and 
people using the computerized card catalog at college and public libraries.
You only need one person to administer the system --- the users just
do word processing, databasing, etc from a menu.

Me again... I upgraded my 386dx33 to a 486dlc40, simple chip swap since my 
MB directly supports the chip.  Well, 70ns main memory appears to be a bit 
slow, while my 20ns cache works fine at 40 with no wait states.  After 
trying bunches of stuff, it turns out that I NEED 1 read and write wait 
state on main memory, but no wait states on cache.  I had thought that 70ns 
memory was good up to 40 mhz, but I guess 60 is REALLY required.  I tested 
this by (grin) compiling the kernel over and over.  If it compiled, the 
combo worked.  If it bombed (usually late in "make dep" or early in "make 
zlilo", I needed to change something.  Got to try on a lot of kernels that 
way... got compiles down to around 40 min thou... (486DLC/8meg ram).

Good luck finding problem.

Subject: Word Processors for Linux
Date: Tue, 11 Oct 1994 17:47:54 GMT

Just thought I'd throw my two cents worth into the fray.

Does anybody remember a word processor put out by Lotus in the mid '80s
called `Manuscript'.  It was a damn good processor with an emphasis on
structured documents like academic papers.  It followed the same trend
as LateX by using logical formatting rather than a WYSIWYG interface.
It also had an integrated outline processor that makes all the other
outliners look weak (even now).  It had an equation language somewhat 
similar to TeX and could produce excellent output.  It had a page preview
function which gave a reasonable but not excellent indication of how the
final document would look. It could import graphics and produce post-
script output.  In short it was a high-end wordprocessor with
all the bells and whistles PC users had come to expect.

The program was dropped by Lotus when AmiPro was aquired.
I'm no programmer, but it might be worth tracking down whatever happened
to the source code to see if it could be ported to Linux.
If it could be ported over It would come close to serving
everybody's needs; a text based interface that could be used
over a modem, a page previewer that could run under VGA mode
or in an X-window.  Until someone with a lot more programming
capability than I come up with `Manuscript for Linux'  I'll just 
have to content myself with running it in DOSEMU and printing the 
postscript files using aps.

Just a thought!  ;-)

I found the SS5 to be pretty good.  True, it swapped, but it was fast
enough that it didn't seem to matter much.  Doing the basic editing,
compiling, word processing and e-mailing that I do, the 5/70 with
16MB of RAM was faster than the SPARC 10 Model 30 with 32MB RAM that
I had sitting next to it.  I considered it a pretty good machine.

Again, I didn't find the 16MB too bad, although I only used the system
for two weeks.  The disk would be a little tight, I agree, if I didn't
have my home directory and apps NFS-mounted (but I did, so I had some
200MB of empty space on that 535 disk).

These numbers are fine, but keep in mind that the system under discussion
was a 486/66 which cost $4100 (pretty well decked out).  To make that machine
a Pentium would have bumped it up some more, possibly into the next price
class of RISC machines.

-While 'sc', 'oleo' and 'xspread' are nice, they just don't look as nice as
-do the DOS spreadsheets.  I agree with this point mostly for the reason
-that I've used DOS spreadsheets so much that touch-typing 123-style
-commands is second nature, but not so with things like oleo (although they
-do use emacs-style keystrokes for some things, which is a win).

I think Linux is fine in this area.

-
-:      3. a paint program: similar to "paintbrush";
-
-xpaint does a rather good job.

Agreed.

-:      6. a database: like DBase 3;.
-
-There are databases (but not like dbase) for linux such as Postgres. I
-don't use them. For most needs, I'm not sure databases are as necessary
-under Unix, since you can use all the unix text-processing tools (that are
-largely nonexistent under DOS) to manage data.
-
-: they would need to have certain abilities and properties:
-
-:      a. a "common look and feel" (which one ? hell, pick a popular 
-:         GUI and copy it; other people have);
-
-Well, there's plenty of that type of thing common in the X-windows world,
-such as Athena widgets, Motif, etc.
-
-:      b. ability to read and write the common formats: eg: the word
-:         processor must have filters for text, RTF, ps, Word (in as
-:         many incarnations as possible), etc; the spreadsheet must do
-:         .wk1, .wk3, .xls, etc.
-
-I _hate_ proprietary data formats. Flat ascii is preferable - it's likely
-much easier, for instance, to generate a sc-spreadsheet file with filters,
-shell scripts, or C than it is to generate something in a DOS spreadsheet
-format.

Agreed. In fact propritary data formats foremost purpose is to make it
difficult for other folks to duplicate tools that manage those files. And
that is exactly what we want here. ASCII is definitely the way to go.


-
-But since this cancer is so prevalent under DOS, some data interchange
-format is a necessity. Flat Ascii doesn't cut it usually -- I've had quite
-a few problems reading Ascii files into WP for instance.

YUP. We need converters.

Later,

I bought a big box of used floppies from an ad on the net for 5 cents
apiece.  Some of them are factory labeled "Microsoft Windows
Operating Environment."  (This was in the days before uSoft had the
audacity to call its kludge an OS.)  It gives me great pleasure to

  mke2fs -c -m0 /dev/fd1h1200 1200

and make these units useful again.

        Yes, which makes wonder why you continue to spout your drivel.

        There aint no assumption about it; Paramount DEFINITELY has a 
legal standing to protect there copyright.

        Irrelevant. (You love to attend to irrelevancies, don't you).

        This is simply because you have no WISH to see any.

One thing I've noticed--
It runs a HELUVA lot faster in XFree3.1 than it did in previous versions...
