A new release of the package has been uploaded on to :

ftp.procyon.com:/pub/linux/shadow/shadow-mk.tar.gz

This release has the source code for the login.secure program mentioned
by bjdouma@xs4all.nl  (Bauke Jan Douma) . The program is abosolutely harmless
and the earlier posts were just an over reaction. If you already have the
package installed from before today, then you do *not* have to get rid of
your /bin/login [which is login.secure] . /bin/login in the mk package
is a wrapper type of program that gets rid of the original /bin/login security
holes of -froot and -h.

Also in this package, the file perms have been fixed for the /bin/login and
/bin/_login files. If you have :

/bin/login as mode 4711 and
/bin/_login as mode 4755

then please change this to

/bin/login as mode 4511 and
/bin/_login as mode 4500

For those of you curious about the login.secure program, the original posting
with the source code is available on ftp.procyon.com in the directory
/pub/linux/shadow as login.secure.gz . As mentioned before, the source code is
also available in the latest release of shadow-mk.

I wouldn't pay 5 cents. BTW I have one for sale if your interested.

Your best bet is an S3 card. If you're finance limited (impaired?) then
go the for S3 801/805 DRAM version. Otherwise the 928 is a very fast
beast. For a cheaper card you could try a Cirrus 542{6|8} based card.
If it's a VLB card, the Cirrus gives about 50000 xstones. The DRAM S3's
come in at about 70000 xstones.

Going by the partition table format you should be able to get 8 Gig from
a single drive. If the SCSI controller BIOS handles it, 8 Gig should also
be usable under DOS. I think Linux is limited by the partition table
limitation. I haven't tried it but, it may be possible to put the
filesystem on /dev/sda rather than the partition /dev/sda1. Since /dev/sda
is raw access to the blocks on the drive you should be able to create
a filesystem of any size (up to SCSI limits) on the drive.

FYI, partition max heads is 255, max sectors 63 and max cyls 1023.

One other consideration is that IDE drives take up processor time while
being accessed.  An easy way to see this is to mkfs a partition on an IDE
drive while in X -- X will come to a standstill, no matter how fast your
machine.

In addition, SCSI drives beat out IDE if you have multiple processes
accessing the drive simultaneously.

I have an IDE, but given any choice at all, I would go with a SCSI.  I
agree that the concept of putting an IDE drive on a Pentium system is
ridiculous.  If you really need the speed of a Pentium, get a decent drive
at the same time.

Date: Thu, 08 Sep 94 02:08:55 GMT

I want to setup the modem on my Linux machine for dialout (for UUCP) and
dialin (for terminal access). I have read the Serial-Howto, but I can't
figure out how to flip the modem between 'quiet mode' (for dialin terminal
access) and normal response mode so that UUCP can chat to the modem and 
get eg 'CONNECT' type messages.
Some systems eg SCO have separate lines in 'Dialers' for modem initialisation
and re-initialisation when the UUCP session is finished, but Taylor UUCP
doesn't appear to support this.
Can I acheive what I want with the /etc/default/getty.ttySx files ?

I would appreciate some real world experience from Linux comms Gurus

>>by fooling around with it.  So what's the point?

Well, I didn't see the original post to this thread, but this statement is
plain wrong.

I installed Linux for the first time about 1.5 - 2 years ago.  I knew
nothing about Linux or Unix.  I had a general idea as to what ls, cp, mv,
and a few other two-letter commands did, from using a csh clone on my
Amiga.  All I wanted to do was play Netrek.

It took me about 4 - 5 months before I was able to play Netrek.  I had to
struggle with networking, X, frequent crashes, and just about everything
else on the system.  After six months, I became fed up with the distribution
I was using (SLS), and installed everything from scratch.  Note that
installing a complete Un*x system from original sources gleaned from
assorted FTP sites is NOT the work of a novice.

I spent last summer working (for pay) on a commercial Linux distribution.
In a year and a half of `fooling around' with Linux, I managed to progress
from barely knowing enough to get a directory listing to being able to
make money with my knowledge of Unix.  While I am far from being the most
knowledgeable person I know, I would consider myself to be a competent
Unix user.

I know of no better way to learn Unix than to fool around with it.

        - Damien

(BTW -- I haven't played Netrek in at least 3/4 of a year.  Somehow, my
initial reason for installing Linux paled once I found out how interesting
the system itself was... :-)

Subject: Linux in InfoWorld
Date: Thu, 8 Sep 1994 04:56:02 GMT


For those of you who subscribe to InfoWorld, pay attention to their article
on TCP/IP.  This week they attempt to install Linux on a Dell 486.  Most
of the article talks about their problems with the machine, not with
Linux.  However, to me, the best part of the article is just the fact
that their review has placed it in the same category as the commercial
OS's and TCP/IP offerings they normally review.

They attempted to install Slackware 2.0.  The only thing they did was
to create the install disks and tell the system to auto-install
everything from CD.  After letting the install run all night, they
came back the next morning to discover:
         * They took the wrong system.  Their install system
           had critical data on it that wasn't backed up.
         * Slackware install recognized the disk was DOS partitioned
           and created a LINUX directory under which it put
           the distribution.
         * Their critical data was still available on disk.

Since they didn't actually try anything with the system, I assume
next week's article will do something technical, like attempt to
configure TCP/IP.

Get yourself the newest Term-HOWTO on sunsite. There it is described how to

I agree with Damien.  I installed Linux a couple of years ago.  The only 
previous Unix experience I had was ftp and MUD's...very iffy as whether or not 
those count :)  

I have had one formal Unix class in my life - two weeks ago, on a HP system, 
to learn what it does different, such as it's logical volume management, etc...

Other than that, it's all self taught.

Please people, don't project your own failures as the truths of the general 
public.

Have you run linecheck before starting term?? This tells you a biot about the condition of the connection you are using. Which characters should be escaped/
ignored, if you have a 7 or 8 bit connection etc.

According to this output you have to change the termrc files on both sites.

then run two test daemons on one machine to see if term it self works.

Then fire up your connection over the modem. Most probably, you then have
to start tuning the parameters 'windows', timeout' and 'baudrate' in your
termrc file.

The time out message you get means that a data packet is timed out after 102
msec, the first time it is sent.
