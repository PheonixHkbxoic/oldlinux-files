I'm wondering if there exists a utility which would let me determine if
an existing term connection is actually alive, and not crashed or hung,
as is often the case resulting from a less than perfect phone-line.  I
was thinking something along the lines of a program which would output
"socket is busy" or whatever.

I've already written a somewhat kludgy script to allow me to do this,
but it's very inefficient, and I *know* there has to be a better way.
The problem is this:  I can test the connection with a simple 'trsh cat
testfile'.  ('trsh echo ok' results in a broken pipe...)  This is not a
problem if the connection is alive.  The problem is when the connection
has dropped, since term is still running on the local machine, and when
a trsh or anything term-related is sent through the socket, the command
hangs.  So, the kludgy part is a background process started when the
'trsh cat testfile' is executed, which checks 30 seconds later to see if
the command has produced any output.  Yuck!  Suppose the connection *is*
alive, but the remote machine just happened to be lagged during the 30
seconds...  So you can see it's pretty icky.  :( The whole thing is
necessary since I want to be able to initialize a term connection if one
doesn't already exist whenever a user tries to run a term-specific
program.  Hmm...I suppose the remote machine could send a character
every few minutes, or an empty file, which a program could check the
last mod time...

So anyway, if anybody knows of a program which can quickly and
accurately determine if the connection is valid, it would be greatly
appreciated.


Side note:  Has anybody had problems with tredir in term 119?  Mine
            won't redirect *anything*.  I had no problem with term
            203's tredir...  But 203 just wasn't stable enough at
            the time... ;)

Side note ii:  Tin+term has given me a major headache, trying to compile
               the darn thing.  Mosaic, ftp, telnet, irc have all gone
               fine with only a few minor changes.  So here it is:  does
               anyone have a binary of a working tin using the term
               port/socket calls?  THAT would be greatly appreciated, as
               I have to read news on the remote machine in text mode....:(


Thanks for reading/skimming/scanning...

Or you can alternately use the klogd daemon in one-shot mode.  The end
of our rc.bcheck file looks something like this:

# Dump bootup messages for posterity.
/etc/klogd -o -f /usr/adm/boot.msg;

Note that on an FSSTND compliant system the klogd utility may be found
in /usr/sbin and the proper place for the message file may be in
/var/adm/boot.msg.

Most linux distributions are already configured to write the boot messages
to /var/adm/syslog.

While Intel did a port of gcc-2.4.0 to add Pentium optimizations, they did
a really poor job of it, violating the front-end/back-end boundary,
putting things in the wrong places, writing the code in a sloppy way: the
effect is that all of their changes need to be rewritten.

This is being worked on, but the FSF has a consistent answer when asked
questions about when something will be ready: when it's ready.

The Intel port of 2.4.0 is available in the meantime, though no one is
supporting it (at Intel or FSF).

Date: 5 Sep 1994 10:48:48 +0200

I would like to know how to find the names of the colors that are defined
by the XVGA16 generic driver. Is there any way of substituting colors 
defined by a application so it matches with my generic driver.

Many thanks in advance
