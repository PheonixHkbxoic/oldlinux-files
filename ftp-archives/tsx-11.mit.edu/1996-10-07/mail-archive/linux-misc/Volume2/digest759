Hi there,

I just bought a notebook from MPC Tech. Inc. and I'm trying to install
linux on the machine.

I want to know whether anyone of you does have any experience in
setting up X for those notebooks.
The problem is the XConfig file. 

I would appreciate if someone colud send me a XConfig file that works.

        Thanks a lot.

                                        Regards,    Walter

It seems like you guys have the 'boot' disk figured out, so your'e trying
for a 'root' disk? Mount the one you currently have for an example. Incident-
ally, it's Minix! Seriously, I've done it out of necessity, and you can make
one alot better than what you get with most distributions. I don't know why
it has to be Minix---I think it hearkens back to the pre-historical days
of Linux development.......hope this helps.

Well if you build a shared library with the Xlib calls DOOM makes that
just happens to map onto SVGAlib bits that suit doom and use that shared
library earlier in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment then by magic you will
get SVGAlib doom. Aren't shared libraries neat!

I used to own a NeXTstation, but when NeXT stopped making hardware, I
sold it to raise the cash to upgrade my PC so it could run NeXTstep.
For a while I was running with three partitions on my gig drive --
DOS, Linux and NeXTstep.  Unfortunately, NeXTstep performance was so
bad when compared with Linux performance that I eventually sold my
copy and now I use Linux exclusively.  Running Linux, my PC now
outperforms my old NeXTstation mono (it had a 40MHz 68040 and 20M RAM)
as long as I'm not doing graphics (X11 is yucky and brings performance
down to about the same as my NeXTstation was when it had 8M RAM).

I had "only" a 486DX2-66 with 8M RAM, gig hard drive, Trident ISA SVGA
card, Pro Audio Spectrum 16, dual-speed CD-ROM, etc.  The 8M RAM and
ISA SVGA card made NeXTstep virtually unusable.  If you've got 32M of
RAM and one of the supported VLB SVGA cards, you'll probably do a lot
better.

What I *really* want is an OpenStep implementation for Linux, with
Display PostScript and all, so I can throw away X11 and tcl/tk.

Yes, Linux, you got this one right.

>2. Which one is easier to install and has less problem with existing 
>   PC hardware?

Depends.  If you've got a really good Slackware 2 based CD-ROM, Linux
is a lot easier to install.  If you don't know what you're doing and
you FTP bits and pieces from all over, Linux is a lot harder to
install.  On the average, on my machine and those of folks around me
Linux has been easier to install.

>3. Which one has more choice of application software?

Commercial or free?  NeXTstep has the edge as far as commercial
application software, but Linux has the edge as far as free software
I'd say.  Free software matters more to me, so...

>4. Which one is faster (for the same task) ?

Linux, no contest.  Don't even begin to think they might even be
comprable.

>5. Which one has a capability that the other doesn't have?

Both.  Linux supports more devices.  Linux will let you root about in
the kernel.  Linux is (in my experience) less buggy.  Most POSIX-ish
things just work under Linux.  Linux will let you run DOS applications
(via DOSEMU) without an expensive 3rd party product.  Linux has VCs,
which remove the need for a windowing system for a lot of folks.
Linux will run SCO binaries (via iBCS) if you know what you're doing.

NeXTstep comes with a really cool development environment, IMHO
unmatched anywhere else by any vendor.  NeXTstep has a unified imaging
model (PostScript) -- anything you can throw up on the screen can be
put on paper, and it will look good.

So, hm.  Systems-level folks and die-hard Unix-heads will probably
consider Linux more capable, and applications-level folks, publishing
types and Macintosh fans might consider NeXTstep more capable.

>6. Which one has better future? (this is a question for discussion
>   and not for a definite answer.)

I'd say Linux, probably.  NeXT *still* isn't really on 100% solid
footing yet, are they?  Let's assume the worst case, and say that both
Linux and NeXTstep disappear.  With Linux, you've got the source, so
you can keep using it.  With NeXTstep, you're tied to a vendor.  So,
Linux has more of a future as far as *I'm* concerned.

I don't think either of them has much of a commercial future at all,
though.  They're both for folks on the fringes (which is fine).

Actually, I see it more that a DOS is an operating system which uses
random, non-volitile storage as its medium for operation.  An embedded
controller with such storage is probably not running a DOS, but certainly
the traditional view of Unix is that it is a DOS.

My point, originally, is that the word DOS has nothing to do with
Microsoft... neither does the word "windows".  The proper names for those
products always have been, and still are MS-DOS and MS-Windows!  Microsoft
could not, cannot, and will not be able to register common, generic
English words to their exclusive use.  That would be like trying to 
make a new computer called "computer" and registering the name so nobody
else can use it.  Then end up confusing the market-

Is that a computer?
Yes
I mean, is it a computer computer?
What?  It is a computer?
But what brand is it?
A Compaq.
Oh, so it is not a computer then.

(Now substitute "windows", above in context of MS-Windows, X-Windows,
Amiga Windows, windows on your car, windows as an abstract concept of GUI, etc)

I've already mailed you about this, but here's my defense: I
decided to approve Ted's posting to present an "alternate viewpoint"
to the opinions (yes, opinions) stated in your article. In retrospect, 
neither article should have been posted to c.o.l.announce. But I'm
having to put on the moderator hat, so I can't play favourites.
Get me? There were a number of impassioned responses both to your
article as well as Ted's, but I refused to post them, because c.o.l.a
shouldn't be a mudslinging match between Linux enthusiasts.

Both articles were accurate as to their claims. The rest is opinion.
I'm not going to defend my decisions any further. Maybe I screwed up. Cope.

QDOS is a product from Gazelle Systems which is more like X-Tree than it
is like 4DOS.  The latter is a replacement command processor for DOS
in that it fully replaces COMMAND.COM.  QDOS is a file selector/browser
tool with a few other goodies thrown in as well.

I am in the process of buying a 486 system. As everyone I spoke
to recommended says PCI is the way to go, (with SCSI), I reviewed
the PCI-HOWTO for more information.

The HOWTO's recommended a specific 486 PCI Motherboard (ASUS-486-PCI ...)
which uses the Saturn Chipset rev. 4. However, my dealer has just
informed me that that chipset is no longer used, and they now use
the ARIES (sp?) chipset.

Does anyone know anything about this chipset? 

On a tangential issue, I am in the process of buying a system which I
would like to run LINUX on, and am curious if anyone knows of any
vendors in the Los Angeles area who are Linux-knowledgeable, and
that I can trust to deliver a system which is 100% Linux compatible.
Needless to say, I would hope the dealer to be honest and reputable.
Can anyone recommend me a specific dealer? Or am I better off assembling
a system myself?

Any advice suggestions would be very much appreciated. Please reply
via E-mail, if possible. If there is any interest, I will post a summary
of the responses.

hmmm... as far as I know, they will only hold about 120mb each. The
prices within this rumours were the same, but IMHO the main
disadvantage is the speed. I've heard, that they won't be much faster
than a usual floppy disk...
In case they have SCSI, Linux will support them without trouble, but
otherwise I'm afraid it won't, unless somebody writes a device driver...

Btw, I've just bought the new SyQuest 270mb removable harddisk drive,
and I'm very pleased with it... here're the facts:

        270mb, 14-16ms, SCSI or IDE, 3.5", bootable, no problems with Linux
