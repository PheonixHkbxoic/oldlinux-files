Hi, sorry if this is a stupid question, didn't really do any searching
for this yet, but I haven't seen anything on c.o.l.announce.

Just wondering if there is a DOS program you can use to be able to
read the Linux ext2fs partitions, guess it would be something like
the mscdex thing to read iso9660 format.  It would just be nice to
be able to access things on all my drives in either operating system.

Thanks in advance.

An unfortunate flame-has started here between J.J. (Hans) Paaijmans and
myself.  I had indeed not realised that he felt threatened by my occasional
references to legal software copyright issues.  He was not the target,
and my argument with him was about totally different issues.

Let me copy some of the proceedings, unfortunately at some length, since I
don't intend to <snip> very much in an argument like this.

This was, I believe, his opening of this thread, passed on from the long-running
and generally high-strung "WABI vs. SoftWindows?" thread:

| I guess that if the market for such software expands dramatically
| owing to the free OS, prices will rapidly become lower. And then
| there is the "jatbaarheidsfactor" ("snatchability factor").
| I reckon that a great part of the success of programs like
| Wordperfect, or the Borland compilers, is due to the fact that
| it is easily stolen. Same goes for the success of the old
| Apple II and the IBM PC-designs, that were easily copied
| by other manufactorers (sp?).
| 
| Without wanting a discussion on the ethics of copying software
| and hardware design, I think that the rapid dispersal of copies
| of good software does more for the original seller than
| the loss of income - most copiers won't buy anyway but when
| their boss looks for a good wordprocessor to buy for the
| office, they know what to suggest.
| 
| I predict that as soon as illegal copies of, say, Wordperfect
| for SCO (not demo's, but the real thing) are gonna circulate
| in the Linux community, the figures of copies actually sold
| will boom.
|
| As a matter of fact, if *I* was the president of Wordperfect,
| I would rush a copy of a WP binary compiled for Linux to
| sunsite.unc.edu *immediatly*, and then sit back and wait
| for the orders from universities.
| 
| Hans Paijmans.
| 
| PS: If mr. president-of-Wordperfect reads this and follows

Now this is where I hooked in:

What I saw as his problem in getting review copies, was NOT his opinions
regarding nicked software, which he shares with most academic users I have
ever spoken to, and which I describe i the snip as "mostly valid", but
rather the combination of his earlier claim to be a computer journalist,
and his obvious ignorance of arguably the biggest piece of PC-software news
this year:  the Novell-Wordperfect merger.

But obviously, he didn't understand me on this point:

I failed to respond reassuringly to the "vexed" thing, sorry!  But to my
defense I must say that I didn't feel like expounding on the fact of his
ignorance of the WP-Novell merger.

Then a totally new aspect opened up, nothing at all to do with J.J.

Now here *is* a threat:  don't put Novell software on an ftp site, or 
else...

I was also repudiating a perceived leniency by WP Netherlands, because in
my opinion (and remember, all of this is my opinion!) Novell is unlikely to
continue such an attitude, should it ever have existed.  It goes against
the grain of what I perceive as Novell's business philosophy.  (We are,
e.g., regularly running anti-theft software on all internal PC's -- meaning
that employees are checked whether they may be running illegally acquired
software, even loading one copy of Windows onto more than one UnixWare
box.  Yes, we also protect Cousin Bill's property :-)

Then we had yet another idea thrown in:

(a perfectly true story:  we had our annual summer party last Friday,

Europe, whom I knew from elsewhere, and I *did* mention this thread, and
the reported perception of WP NL's attitude, and he *did* reply as I
quoted.)

In case you are interested, it's Dr. Sohnius, but Herr Sohnius, or even

Looks like he still hasn't understood that UnixWare and Wordperfect 
come from the same company, for heaven's sake!

OK, let's make one thing clear (again):  that I came to the conclusion
that he shouldn't get a review copy was not because he would be likely to
pass it on in multitudes, but because I think he is not a journalist whose
opinion about UnixWare or Novell I would like to see in print.  Perfectly
fair, isn't it?  He's got, after all, a point to prove, namely that UW "is
a SMALL seller and likely will remain so".

It appears I have friends as well as enemies:

Well, it doesn't.  There should be no discussion here.  Hans believes
that illegal copies in the long run help sales.  I happen to believe
that he is right.  Thinking this, and arguing one's case is no offense
in any sense.  Putting up other people's software for free downloading
is very doubtful, and indeed then downloading and using it is clearly
illegal.  So much for my layman's legal opinion.

.. and just to be on the safe side, I finally include Hans' copy

For general DOOM topics, better is to use alt.games.doom. These guys on
