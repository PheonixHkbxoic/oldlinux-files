        I agree,

        Linux is extremely slick and cool -- much more so in my opinion than
        anything MS has to offer.  In fact, due to "some problem with the 
        RAM in your [my] machine", OS/2 won't run but Linux runs just fine.
        (Yeah, I know, OS/2 is IBM, right.  Still, I don't like Windows).
        
        Anyhow, why I'm here is to suggest you take a look at GREAT.  GREAT
        is, I think, available in the /BETA or /ALPHA directory on sunsite
        and/or tsx-11.mit.edu.  It was done (actually, not quite finished yet)
        by some guys at the Free Software Association of Germany.  It has a 
        cool little bar that goes across the bottom of your screen, called
        "gpanel", that has a clock along with icons you can use to start
        help, xterms, news, filemanager, calculator, mail, etc.   So, I say
        you should check out GREAT.

AFS was already ported at MIT and they're trying to sort out a way of

Transarc.

Hi,
Back when I had 8M and only one drive my printer worked
just great.  But now that I have 16M and 2 hard drives it
doesnt.  DOS prints just fine but not linux.  I thought
I read something once about the second hard drive using
a weird interupt number that might interfere with lp1.
But tis is just me grabing at straws as to why my lpr
doesnt work.

lpc always says no daemon present, even after a enable all 
start all.  I can get the lights on the printer to flash
is I set /dev/lp1 to use interupt 7 using tunelp
but nothing comes out.  If I use polling nothing happens.
but cat'ing to /dev/lp1 will always work.
confused.

They don't sound much like reasons at all, although please don't
go out and buy hardware cos I said so :-)

I can see that you probably wouldn't be able to access the floppy from
Linux and you might have to write your own disk controller driver, but
if you were to put a kernel on a DOS partition and use LOADLIN to
start it, you'd at least be running Linux.  Mounting the root
partition is left as an exercise for the reader.

For historical perspective, in IBM's MVS a "job" runs in its own address

Just buy one 'o those small 1-2 cubic foot refrigerators and modify it
into a PC enclosure.  That way, your WHOLE machine runs cooler, and you
have someplace for beer besides.......


This is only half a joke, BTW - I actually considered doing this to try
to get my (Intel) DX2-66 to run at 100 MHz.  It runs fine at 80; when I
try to speed it up more the external cache fails.  Chips run faster at
the cooler end of their environmental range, by a factor of 20% or more.

Another way to speed things up is to crank the voltage up a bit.  5V chips
often work fine up past 7V; works fine in the lab, though I'm hesitant to
do it to my machine at home.  Heat becomes an even worse problem as well.

(I know the above from job-related testing of standard commercial devices
in liquid nitrogen.  At -200 C we would routinely get a 2X improvement in
device speed.)


PS: Ran some benchmarks on my nominally 80 MHz machine; I saw only a 6%
speedup in CPU-intensive tasks.  This implies that I'm RAM limited, not
CPU limited.  BUT my video performance went up 16%; I suspect because my
VLB is running at the new bus rate.

Depending on your exact XConfig, you can expect 74-76 hz at 1280x1024 at
the maximum pixel clock of 135 Mhz.  Not too many cards go higher, and I
imagine they may be more expensive--you sure as hell don't want to be
running that sort of clock on a DRAM card, to start with.  There may be s3
928 cards w/higher clocks (in your price range).  For the record, I'm using one
(GUP) at 1280x1024 and 74-75 hz on a 21" and it's pretty rock-solid.  Grey
vertical edges occasionally exhibit some pulsation...wouldn't really call it
flicker.  Most will, I believe, find something in the 76hz range functionally
equiv to 80 or so.  YMMV.

Subject: WARNING: Xfree-3.1 XF86_Mach32 may damage non-green monitors!
Date: Mon, 10 Oct 1994 10:10:20 GMT

Hello out there,

first of all I want to notice that Xfree86-3.1 runs fine with my ATI
Graphics Ultra PRO Mach32 together with a Sony Multiscan 17se (it's a
"green" monitor with powersaving capability).

While running 'startx -- /usr/X11R6/bin/XF86_Mach32 :0 -bpp 16' and
about 10 minutes of inactivity the screensaver blanked out my
screen. And surprisingly my monitor went into powersaving mode.
That's exactly what I want to get.

But... I've never enabled any powersaving option!

While running 'startx -- /usr/X11R6/bin/XF86_Mach32 :0 -bpp16' (which
is a 8-bit server -bpp 8) my monitor doesn't switch to powersaving
mode while screensaver is active!? Why not?

And here's the problem: What if my monitor wouldn't like powersaving
signals? I suppose *NON-GREEN*MONITORS*MAY*GET*DAMAGED* by this behavior!

Whow can I enable powersaving signals with -bpp 8 server and whow to
disable with -bpp 16 ???

The man-page states a option keyword for XConfig-files, but mach32
server doesn't recognize. In the announcement for Xfree-3.1 one can
read that green-functions are not yet available for mach32!??

Ok, someone out there who can clarify this behavior? I've not enough
disk space to hold Xfree-source. Therefore I'm not able to check
sources. Please don't blame me for this warning posting. It's a caveat
from someone who has already blown two brand new monitors this summer :=(

   works fine. After this when I try to run the fdisk , it says "out of memory"
   .Having only 4 MB of RAM , i need the command that disables the ram disk and
                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   loads the boot, root from the floppy. The information accompanying the
   distribution  I have does not give me any information on how to do it. Can
   somebody please help me.

You should try 'ramdisk=0' option at lilo prompt. Don't forget to
specify your bootimage at first.

   A few weeks ago, there was a post about Slackware 2.0.1.  It was
   the release with all the kernels from 1.0.9 to 1.1.50 and XFree86
   3.1 on it.  

Whoever said that was quite mistaken.  I have Slackware 2.0.1 myself, I'm not
sure how high the kernels go (NOT to 1.1.50, 1.1.18 or 1.1.38 sounds familiar),
but the version of X it comes with is 2.1.1.

It's on ftp.cdrom.com:/pub/linux/slackware/slakware/

Be happy...

Hi all,

I want to create my own Bootdisk with a Ramdisk, like the Slakeware Boot/Root
disks. But i haven't found any traget in the Makefiles of the kernel-source.

I don't want to use my HD to boot. Ich will spezify the programs copying to
the Ramdisk, and i want to use my own kernel.

How can i create such a disk(s) ?

so long Stephan.

Ahhh, I see :)  People are always throwing the fact that OS/2 is a
"multi-threading" operating system -- I never saw the point...  I would
think that there's not much of an advantage. Oh, well... :)

Will definitely do that....  I'm planning on getting into Linux kernel
hacking one of these days :)

I just installed it today and have been discovering these here and
there. You start an executable and then get complaints about "No
such file or directory" and then have to manually shuffle things
around. This release seems in some ways less satisfactory than the
Summer issue (but some things are better of course). It's a little
sloppy.
