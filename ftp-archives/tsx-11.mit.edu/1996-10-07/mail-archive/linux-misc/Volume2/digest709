Hi, I also want to know the answer. Do I need to install BSDs in order to compile it?

Hello Linuxers,
        I just can't get "talk" working right!  Everytime I invoke talk,
even with a different account on the same machine, it says:
[Couldn't bind to control socket : Cannot assign requested address (99)]

        My inetd.conf and my etc/services files look fine [to me.]  I would
appreciate if someone can shed a light on how to go about solving this
problem.  FYI, I am running Linux 1.0.9.

Yes, this Jaskolski person has been offering a lot of very dubious "bargains"
over the net.  I personally don't want net bandwidth wasted with this kind
of crud.  Could I suggest that further postings from Jaskolski offering

Subject: NFS and the portmapper...
Date: 4 Sep 1994 22:00:17 GMT


Greetings,
   I've been using Linux on my home machines for some time now, and
would like to add NFS capability.  I get the following message
whenever I try to mount an NFS volume - be it in fstab or from a prompt:

  mount clntudp_create: RPC: Port mapper failure - RPC: Unable to receive

   I can't even mount a volume that exists on the same physical
machine via NFS.  I DO NOT have this problem with my Linux box at
work, it is happily talking to a slew of OS/2 boxen with no problems.
I've been using all of the other netty stuff without a hitch (SLIP,
telnet, ftp, rlogin, et cetera). My basic configuration is:

Machine #1:
        Homebrew Pentium
        Mylex MPE-60 PCI/EISA motherboard
        40MB RAM
        1.0 GB Fujitsu hard drive
        Orchis Prodesigner IIs SVGA card
        SMC Ultra Combo ethernet NIC
        STB 4COM I/O board (four NS16550A's) sharing IRQ12
        running Slackware Linux 2.0 with the 1.1.19-ncr kernel

Machine #2:
        Homebrew 386-40
        8MB RAM
        125MB and 212MB IDE hard drives - both Maxtor
        same NIC
        some generic SVGA card
        running Slackware Linux 2.0 with the 1.0.9 kernel

The machine at work is a _very_ old Compaq 386-20 Desqpro, this
machine was installed with the same disks as machine #2 above, and the
configurations are very similar. Yes, I have looked in the man pages,
and FAQs, and Yes the kernels are compiled to support NFS.

I'd really appreciate any help!
Thanks,
Stephen

Date: 1 Sep 1994 21:22:23 GMT
Reply-To: uri@watson.ibm.com

I'm happy to announce new release of well-known DIP...
It's "dip337g-uri.tgz" on "sunsite.unc.edu", either
in "pub/Linux/Incoming", or "pub/Linux/system/Network/Serial".

Lots of upgrades, lots of patches... Thanks to Paul Cadach,
Pauline Middelink, Bill Reynolds, who kindly sent their
patches and mods to me.

In short: 
        - it supports proxy arp now (much easier routing);
        - allows SLIP users not to be present in /etc/passwd (of 
          course you don't HAVE to use this feature - I was begged
          to include it in the package, so I did :-);
        - powerful "config" command (again, it can be security hole
          of considerable size, but it's blocked by default - to use
          it you'd have to recompile "command.c";
        - DIP script language now supports variables.

Several other changes, fixes, streamlining, screwing up and such...
Please test it, especially dial-in part - I wasn't able to ensure
it handles line drops smoothly [in this release].

As always, thanks, bug reports (with fixes :-) and compliments are
welcome (:-).

I had this same message when all of the correct daemons weren't running on
the intended NFS server.  I couldn't tell you which one as they were all

Disregarding the chipsets, since others will be far better informed than

Subject: Assembler working with GCC??
Date: Fri, 02 Sep 1994 17:31:22 +0100
Reply-To: bernd@ego.oche.de

Hi,

is there a way to use DOS (i.e TASM/MASM) style assembler, or even WatcomC 
inlines (pragmas), together with GCC for LINUX ?
Either a tool to convert object code formats, or an assembler for LINUX able to
generate GCC object codes from MASM style assembler would be af help.

Something else I'm constantly seeking, is an editor for LINUX (shell or X),
which comes close to one of the good amiga editors (Cygnus ED). It should be
able to work on normal, and vertical blocks, have an unlimited undo buffer, 
as well as the ability to record macros fast and efficient. It also should
allow multiple files in one window, and most importantly it has to be _fast_.

Thanks for any tips, or pointers !

Before someone starts to explain how Emacs could fulfill all those needs, I 
should add that I already looked at him, but I would prefer an editor rather

Two arguments apperare in mind: First, a Pentium-60 benchmarks at 61 SpecInt,
a dx4-100 at 52 -- can't remember floating point exactly, but the difference
is tendencially even bigger. Second the memory interface of the Pentium is
much better than the 486 one. It is 64 Bit wide and knows of write back
cache.

  There are even more reasons, but this two would be sufficient for me.

  The only reason to buy a dx4-100 is IMHO to preserve your board with a
486-socket with 25, 33 or 50 MHz external clock.

    Shell scripts are not just used for tcsh, csh, and bash stuff... Frankly,
    there are plenty of interpreted languages out there that benefit greatly
    from a suid capability that I cannot run under linux without creating
    a C wrapper.

    perl comes to mind.

Brilliant! Now we have the opportunity to pay royalties to X/open instead
of USL. :)

It wouldn't be a bad idea though if someone got hold of the spec and made
Linux compliant, even if official status can't be obtained.
