Is this a typo or is someone really billing in seconds (VS minutes)?

Hi!
I'm planning to by a PC to run linux on.

1. I understand that there exists a guide on which hardware I can
use with linux.

2. I'd also like some options on where to buy a good linux-bundle.
On CD prefferably. Opinions on shich one is the best are appreciated.

3. Also it would be nice to receive a FAQ for the linux groups. So
that a posting such as this one shouldn't be sent by me again, wasting
bandwidth.

Many TIA!

I don't know that the intention of Motif is to look like Windows.  That may fit
into the definition of libel.  It looks nice, with a real 3-d feel and 
useful menus & shortcuts (configurable as well).  It's also more or less
the standard for many commercial unix systems, except perhaps Sun.

Yes, there is a chip with fit in a "487" socket (which is just a
486DX2/66 with a different pinout).  It disables your old 486, so if
you keep it in the system it is just a very expensive heating element.

I would think you need to ask yourself how this word processor will
differ from things already around (EZ, Doc, etc...).  Once you have a
set of proposed ideas on what it needs, what exists, and what needs to
be implemented, you can start looking for the right language
combination to handle this.

Subject: Why does Slackware ship with an old version of joe?
Date: 10 Oct 1994 16:01:58 -0400

I use Slackware and really like it, but I'm curious why it has not upgraded
joe. I know at least version 2.2 is out, but Slackware only ships 1.0.8. The
only reason I care is because joe 1.0.8 is a little buggy (e.g., search and
replace on large files can cause out of memory errors without swap being
touched).

I did an archie when I wanted to install joe on a non linux system and found
ftp.std.com: /pub/src/editors in case anyone's interested in a newer
version.

It doesn't solve the problem, though; it actually creates a worse one
since it makes the real UID be root, too.

Most likely, the way to handle this is to split svgalib into two
parts: svgalib, a stub library using IPC (such as shared memory), and
svgasrv, a privileged (setuid root) server.  Initializing the svga
system would then involve setting up relevant IPC channels, firing up
svgasrv, and then the functions in the stub library would simply be
feeding instructions to svgasrv.

This is how X avoids this problem: only the X server needs root
privileges, not individual clients.

I was wondering if anyone could provide me with the version(s) of XFree that
will be shipping on the infomagic CD-ROM.  I am particularly interested in
knowing whether it will contain the Diamond Viper server.

Oh, and I'm also wondering if it's still $20 as it was last time.  I'd 
appreciate it if someone with an info-sheet would send it to me, the last
time I tried to communicate with infomagic.com the mail bounced back.

I mentioned this to Jeff in email, but in case anyone else has any interest
left in this subject:

The post that Jeff responded to, about the link problems with Yggdrasil, was
an intermediate version of my final post that slipped out before I could 
catch it. My second post that starts off the same, has quite a bit more
specific information about the problems with Yggdrasils CD-ROM install
that I intended to post. Sorry for the confusion, but I guess that's what 
I get for posting at 3AM :-) 

If you want to ignore the first one and read the second, good. If you want
to read them both and compare my editing effort, suite yourself. If 
you just read the first and skip the second, you'll probably wonder just
what I'm talking about (just like Jeff). I actually do make it quite clear.

I feel that there is a general tendency of natural sciences to move
towards LaTeX. The example with journals is good. One more: by the year
of 1997 ALL basic astro journals will be published in an electronic
form. LaTeX was picked up as a thing to work with.

It can be easily done with XEmacs. LaTeX is not a text processor. It's a
different thing -- typesetting system.

Can anybody tell me if there is increase of speed using a

And the same question for graphics.

I use Syquest 270M removables but as my non-removable C drive. It works
on every O/S I tried (although Xenix unmounts and "ejects" in certain

Hi, fellow netters!
We're about to install net connections to our standalone PC's and MAC's. 
Novell was an option, but expensive. So I turned to LINUX as a unix 
server in a TCP/IP environment. As I understand the Yggdrasil package 
comprise mail daemon, printer queue daemons and NFS (or NFS-like). This 
is what we need.

a) I would be EXTREMELY grateful for any advice on buying the package.
b) Is there a manual (internet) for this specific package.
c) Does anyone know a cheap solution that would give us access to 
internet, i.e. what PC client software do we need? Again I find PC/TCP a 
wee bit expensive.

I apologise if some of the info required can be found as FAQ's, but I'm 
asking on a specific pack, i.e. YGGDRASIL.
