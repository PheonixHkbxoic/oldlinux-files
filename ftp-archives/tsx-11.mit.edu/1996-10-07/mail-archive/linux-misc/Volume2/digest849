Subject: Linux won't see printer
Date: 26 Sep 1994 22:45:08 -0400

When I type " ls > /dev/lp1 "  I get a message that says "no such
device".  It also says that for lp0 and lp2, which I think it should.  I
have an MS-DOS partition and a Linux partition.  I can print with no
problem from DOS with the printer set as LPT1.  I've looked through all
the FAQs (I think ?!?) and can't find anything.  I've got the Slackware
distribution of Linux 1.0, if that makes a difference.  This is just a
stand-alone desktop machine, not networked to anything.  I'm  frustrated...

Can anyone help?

After the forged "QNX for sale" posting in various conferences, I have to
wonder if this posting is a deliberate attempt at flame bait, but all the
same, I'll ask the obvious question.

"Best at what?"

Every Os has a different mix of strengths and weaknesses, features which 
were deliberately added to address specific application needs.  In the case 
of QNX, a microkernel architecture, realtime, certified POSIX compliance, 
network transparent distributed processing, and fault tolerant networking 
are some attributes that differentiate it from Linux and 386BSD.

In the case of 386BSD and Linux, attributes such as being free and full source
being available differentiate it from QNX.

As to which is best, you have to look at your application and see what
it needs most, and then choose based on that.  After all, most of us
don't run operating systems just for the fun of it.  The OS is usually
part of the environment (which includes the hardware) necessary to 
support the applications we need to run.

IMHO, the key to making a newbie-friendly distribution is not making the
distribution brain-damaged, but rather to add some documentation and
utilities
in key places to help walk the user through doing the things she wants to
do.  The main barrier to entry at the moment is not the power and
complexity
of Linux but rather that in order to install and use it the user has to
make
decisions which a new user does not have the knowledge to make.  The
current
installation procedure begins by having you haul out rawrite (which isn't
all
that horrible) and fdisk (which is ghastly).  If I am a new user I have no
clue how many megabytes of swap space I need.

My vision of a newbie installation is one where you get your install disks
or your CD-ROM or whatever, and there is a file called install.bat that you
run, which pops up and says something like:

"I am about to install Linux on your disk.  This will wipe out all the data
on your hard disk.  Are you sure you want to do this?"

"The first thing I am going to do is partition your hard drive.  This means
that I am going to divide your hard drive into smaller units, each of which
is going to be used for a different purpose.  Later on, if you want a
different
partition you can do this step yourself using the fdisk utility, which you
can read all about by typing 'man fdisk'.  For now I am going to partition
your disk in the following way:

partition 1: 200 MB root partition.  This partition will hold the actual
linux kernel as well as some important programs for maintaining your
system.

partition 2: 200 MB usr partition.  This partition will hold application
programs, etc.

partition 3: 20 MB swap partition, used for virtual memory paging.

partition 4: 100 MB DOS/WINDOWS partition.  (NOTE: I will set things up
so that you can boot both DOS and Linux, and so that you can read your
DOS files from Linux.  Unfortunately, there is no way to read Linux files
from DOS - DOS is too brain damaged.)

and so on.

The key points are:

1.  Do not give the users any options unless it is absolutely necessary.
Make everything some reasonable default and as automatic as possible.

2.  Inform the user at every step in the installation what is going on,
the decisions that are being made for her, and how to change things later
if she wants it done differently later on.  Also, where to go for more
info.

3.  When everything is in place, put a file on the screen with the
following
information: a) how to press the shift key on bootup to select DOS or Linux
to boot.  b) how to edit a file using the default editor (this could be a
pointer to read some other file, with explicit instructions on how to read
that file) c) how to get to the DOS partition  d) how to run DOSEMU.  (NOT
how to install it; it should be installed automatically!)

FWIW.

Thats interesting.  My source was my older brother whos worked in IBM

I COULD have misremembered this, but I don't think so.  Ill double check

Yes,

The driver that loads under DOS inits the modem.  So
to get it to work:
 
  - boot dos and load the driver
  - warm restart (CNTL-ALT-DEL)
  - load linux

It works!

Or use loadlin so that you have a linux menu in your
config.sys that loads the driver and then calls loadlin
to boot linux.

Has anyone figured out what the driver inits so we can do
it from linux?

Also, I haven't been able to get the modem to answer the
phone.  (I think the fax half wants to answer...)
Ideas?

Subject: Trans-Ameritech Release 4 ! New Slackware 2.0.1 !!!
Date: 28 Sep 1994 23:59:56 GMT

Trans-Ameritech Systems announcing the Linux Plus BSD  CD-ROM Release 4.

The company that pionered the Slackware distribution on a CD-ROM, the "live"
file-system and DOS-assisted installation procedures is proud to announce
a new revolutionary Installation Free (tm) release of Linux. 

We hope you will find it easy to install and use. This CD-ROM has one feature  
not found on any other distribution of Linux: it is possible (and very easy!)
to start running Linux from your hard drive WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE NORMAL
INSTALLATION ROUTINE! It will work with ANY CD-ROM that DOS can read. The only
assumption that the automated procedure makes,is that you have an IDE drive C:
with at least 20 MB of disk space to automatically put a Linux system with
X-windows on! We call this a Test Drive. After going through this, you can
add software by a normal "setup" procedure or you can decide to dedicate a
partition to Linux.

The Release 4 is based on the brand new release of Slackware  2.0.1 that is
considered by the author (Patrick Volkerding) to be very stable and a major 
milestone. The full Slackware tree (145 MB compressed!) is provided as well
as the Slackware sources tree. And of course the Trans-Ameritech trademark
"live" filesystem that can be used to save disk space. In addition to the
many kernels of all flavors that come with Slackware, we provide a number of
kernels based on the post-code-freeze Linux kernel 1.1.50. It has many 
desirable features not found in the 1.0.x kernels standard with most 
distributions:  
        Considerable improvements in disk performance - SCSI and IDE
        Support for huge IDE disks (over 1024 cylinders).
        Support for the IDE CD-ROMs (NEC 260).
        Standard support for UMSDOS filesystem.
        Way too much more to list here.

The highlights of this release:

        DOOM for Linux!!!
        Read-only Double-Space filesystem!
        NCR PCI SCSI.
        IDE CD-ROM support.
        TGIF - Xlib based interactive 2-D drawing facility under X11. 
        An X server for et4000/w32-based boards. 
        Software for the Ham Radio enthusiasts.
        Two sets of compilers and libs - 4.4.4 and 4.5.26
        Kernels from 1.0.9 to 1.1.50.
        qfax 1.0
        Jazz 1.0 - a  comfortable MIDI sequencer 
        Easy configuration of Xwindows.
        New NTeX 1.2
        BSD Sendmail 8.6.9
        util-linux-1.10
        term 2.1.0
        calc2.9.3t8 - arbitrary precision calculator. 
        irsim - An event-driven logic-level simulator for MOS circuits 
        DOSEMU 52.3 beta for the new kernels.

        FreeBSD packages 1.1



Other important software:
        GNU emacs 19.25 and 19.26 for tty and X.
        Interviews - text and graphics utilities
        ANDREW
        

If you prefer to go through a much more flexible custom installation, an MSDOS
based program provided on the CD-ROM ("install.exe") will help you make the 
right choice of a boot kernel depending on the hardware that you have and will
actually create the two floppies to be used for Linux installation. 
Furthermore, the "setup" script modified by the Trans-Ameritech, will put the 
kernel used during the installation on your hard disk for use with actual 
operation. This guarantees that all the hardware that worked during the 
installation will continue to work afterwards.   

The important documentation is uncompressed and ready to read under DOS before
installing Linux on the CD-ROM.
