    There is some software available for this, but I have found a quick 
way to monitor access is to login as that user and then press the up 
arrow key.  Keep pressing it, and it will show you all of the commands 
that the particular user executed in their last session.  Of course it 
will not monitor what they did in different editors, and mail programs, 
but it is better than nothing.

There is an option in uugetty that will cause the modem to be on or off 
at certain times. Look at the SCHED option in the getty man page. It will 
execute the INIT string certain times, and the OFF string at certain 
times. So if you know when your UUCP is going to be, and when dialins 
will be, you can schedule uugetty to issue a command to the modem to turn 
on quiet mode using the OFF string.

Hi everyone,

I have a Problem with my hardware!
I have a 486DX40, two harddisks with AT-bus interface 
(a WD AC2340 as master-drive and a Conner CFA 540A as slave)
and a Mitsumi FX001D cd-rom. With MSDOS I use the mtmcdae.sys-driver 
for the cd-rom, so it has to use a free (?) DMA-channel (CH6).
Since I started the installation of LINUX a problem with
the DMA-mode occurs. After the partitioning and formating of the harddisks
all DMA-channels seem to be used. Copying of files and programms with
MSDOS leads to serious problems. In some cases I have nonexecutable
programms, but sometimes the copying is a total failure with a
number of corrupted files, lost chains etc..

Does anyone know if this is a problem with the architecture of
AT-bus mainboards or a problem with MSDOS? A Friend has a similar
problem with his soundcard, using a DMA-channel. He had to remove it
to install LINUX.

Thanks in advance

Ulrich

Sorry, but you're stuck with the "GNU approach" (whatever that means)
because you use software and libraries covered by the GPL. Any "problems"
perceived with GNU software applies equally to Linux.

RMS's idea (which I have heard first-hand) is that Linux systems
should be considered GNU systems with Linux as the kernel. This
might be an over-generalization, but you get the idea. Linux systems
don't use exclusively GNU software, and don't adhere 100% to the
GPL ideal. However, the _guts_ of the system (kernel, libraries,
all of the basic and no-so-basic binaries, and so forth) are all 
covered by the GPL. Most of these were developed by the GNU project.
Why shouldn't GNU receive recognition for this? RMS is simply stating 
the status quo in a different way. 

The Debian Linux Association is working with the FSF in order to
develop a good working relationship with them, as well as to
assist each other through shared resources. Case in point: I'm
going to Cambridge (perhaps next week) to install Debian on a machine 
on the FSF's network. The GNU project has donated the machine and 
network connectivity for Debian's use---something that we can all 
benefit from. 

Calm down. The FSF isn't the Borg. They are not out to assimilate Linux.

I've never used nachos, but SPIM (another mips simulator), gcc mips cross

One rather cheap way is to to something like

(you need not be root to do that)
Anyone wanting a remote login can then say

OS/2 is happy on the second drive, although I've not tried it in an
extended partition.  Here's my current setup, which has OS/2, DOS/Windows,
Linux, and FreeBSD:

Drive 1 (540 MB)

        #       Type            Size            Start Cyl

        Part 1: Boot Manager    2 meg           0
        Part 2: DOS             200 meg         3
        Part 3: FreeBSD         320 meg         410

Drive 2 (1080 MB)

        Part 1: HPFS            40 MB           0
        Part 2: Linux           500 MB          1023
        Part 3: Linux           24 MB           2049
        Part 4: Extended        150 MB          82

The extended partition is filled with a DOS partition at the moment.
I'm going to delete that and make a new extended partition that takes
up all the free space.  I'll then put DOS, OS/2, Linux, or FreeBSD
partitions in that as needed.

The second Linux partition is a swap partition.  Linux is quit happy
living entirely in the top half of the disk, past the 1023 cylinder limit
that plagues many systems.

Boot manager is set up to allow booting DOS, OS/2, or FreeBSD.
Linux is booted from DOS via the bootlin program.  The config.sys
in the DOS partition starts like this:

        SWITCHES=/F
        [MENU]
        menuitem=NORMAL, Normal DOS and Windows Configuration
        menuitem=LINUX, Linux Bootstrap
        menuitem=TLINUX, Linux Bootstrap (test kernel)

        [LINUX]
        SHELL=C:\BOOTLIN.COM LINUX

        [TLINUX]
        SHELL=C:\BOOTLIN.COM TLINUX

        [NORMAL]
        ...regular DOS config.sys stuff goes here...

The "SWITCHES=/F" tells DOS not to wait three seconds displaying that
"Starting MS-DOS" message before it continues processing config.sys
(I bet a lot of people thought that it was doing something profound
at that point, like calibrating timers or something...nope!  It's
just giving you time to admire that message!)

Backups are currenlty handled by Linux and my Macintosh.  Since Linux
can read DOS and OS/2 partitions, I do backups by making a compressed
tar archive from Linux, and then I ftp that to my Mac, where it can
either just sit there, or get copied to tape, depending on what my
disk usage is like on the Mac.  I haven't done enough with FreeBSD
to warrant doing a backup, but I'll probably back it up when needed
the same way, except I'll do it from FreeBSD rather than from Linux.

Here are some tips.  First, when you are thinking of installing multiple
operating systems, make a chart that answers the following for each OS:

        1. Can it live on the second disk?  If not, can it at least be
        mostly there, or must is be all on the first disk?  (Answers:
        OS/2, Linux can live on the second disk, I don't know about
        DOS.  I suspect that FreeBSD wouldn't mind, but the installation
        script refused to consider the possibility).

        2. Does it need a primary partition, or can it live in an
        extended partition?  (Answers: I believe that OS/2 and Linux
        can live in extended partitions, although I gave them primaries.
        I think DOS needs to boot from a primary.  I don't know about
        FreeBSD).

        3. Does the OS care about cylinders past 1023?  (Answers: Linux
        does not.  I don't know about the others).

        4. How can it be booted?

Linux seems to be the most flexible.  It can live anywhere, doesn't care
about cylinder limits, and can be booted in many ways (e.g., make it active,
boot it from boot manager, install LILO (which has a zillion configurations),
or boot it throught DOS).

The boot issue is one to watch out for.  Even if the OS has no trouble
with extended partitions or the second disk or living past 1023, the
boot code might.  For example, boot code that uses BIOS probably can't
deal with an OS that lives past 1023.  You'll need to put a small boot
partition for that OS somewhere that meets the requirements of the boot
program, or make other arrangements (e.g., like I do with bootlin).

One more thing to watch out for.  If you are installing multiple operating
systems, you've probably got an fdisk from each one.  You really should
only install an OS in a partition created by the OS's fdisk.  I created a
DOS partition from Linux.  DOS likes to have its partitions start on a
track boundary (e.g., the rest of the track that contains the partition
map is not used).  Linux doesn't care where they start, and so Linux
fdisk by default does *NOT* skip to the start of the next track.  I'm
not sure quite what happened next, but I somehow was able to xcopy from DOS
all my files into that new partition, repartition my first disk (the new
partition was on the second), and then boot DOS from a floppy with the
intention of restoring all those files I had copied to the second disk,
and only then did DOS decide that it did not like that second disk.
(I figureout out what was wrong, and was able to fix things by simply
changing the partition map so that it said the partition started at a
track boundary, and then shifting the whole filesystem up by 62 blocks.
This sort of thing is not for the timid.  I learned to respect that warning
in the Linux documentation about only using Linux fdisk for making Linux
partitions!).
