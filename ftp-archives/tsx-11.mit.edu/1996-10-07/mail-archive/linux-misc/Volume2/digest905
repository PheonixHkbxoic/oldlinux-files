The easiest way is to redirect stderr to stdout, for example,

        make > myfile 2>&1

The '&' converts stderr to the file number following: '1' or stdout

Hope this helps,
Kevin

PS. echo displays on stdout.

You need to install the ncr disks (in directories ncr1 and ncr2) also,
as it contains the kernel.  (actually, you only need to install part of it)

I recently posted a question in comp.dcom.isdn requiring about
the need for an ISDN adapter card supported under PC/UNIX.  The
response was very positive (in that there is a need for PC/UNIX
ISDN card) and was overwhelmed with requests to implement the
drivers for Linux support.

The ISDN hardware board is that which is sold by Intel (Inter
RemoteExpress ISDN LAN Adapter). This card currently support DOS,
Windows and Windows NT environments and sells for $499.

Question:  If'n we could sell that board to you for around $400,
with the Linux drivers (in addition to the existing drivers), how
many of you would be willing to belly up to the bar????

Please respond to pmoyer@access.digex.net.  I look forward to
hearing from you.

I've -heard- of many people overclocking Intel DX2-66's as well, and even went
so far as to contact some fellow overseas (via the net of course) who was 
running his at 80 MHz.  I have a DX2-66 (SL enhanced, if that matters -- but
it still runs at 5 volts) and a clock-selectable motherboard (25,33,40,50).  
I'd -like- to be able to get a >20% increase in speed by moving a jumper, but
my main concern is the operaing temperature of the chip.  The way my MB is set
up, I have room for about a 3/8" high heat sink on the chip, but a CPU fan 
blocks three of my ISA slots (excellent engineering...), so I rigged a CPU fan
to blow -across- my heat sink, which is better than nothing at all.  Unlike
my friend's P60, which will fry eggs, I can -just barely- keep my finger on my
heat sink without it getting too hot to touch.  I'm just wondering if I can
keep my chip within specs (assuming it doesn't kill it right off the bat) with
the jig-rigged cooling setup I've got now.

Anyone have any input on this?

I want to ask whether I can setenv DISPLAY from the worksatation in the univ

I am using seyon terminal emulator and running startx. 
If can't, how can I setenv DISPLAY to my PC except using SLIP account, as my

Try Term. I'm sure it's available at sunsite.unc.edu. Or if you are using 
slackware distribution, it comes with one of the packages. You'll have to 
tinker it a while to get things working right though.

There is a file /etc/dosemu.users (it think that was the name) that needs to
be set up.  If you redirect stderr to a file it will tell you that user x
is not in the file.  The docs haven't caught up, yet, I guess.

Please undo my previous patch.

I think the following code should fix the problem.  It works on my system.
It corrects a locked socket buffer problem with ppp.c (the one with 2.1.2a).
(change is at the end of ppp_xmit).  (compare 3c505.c).

Subject: Why doesn't EMAIL work?
Date: Sat, 8 Oct 1994 12:28:59

I can't seem to get email working correctly with Linux 1.0.9 
(the Slackware distribution).  I am using elm on the virutual 
consoles and CAN send messages to other users on the same 
system.  However, if the user doesn't have an account on the 
local system, the mail never reaches them.  Also, mail coming 
from a remote system never arrives at my Linux box.  I have 
tried mailing directly to the Linux box's IP address (e.g. 
user@198.60.24.139) rather than utilizing the name server.

I assume that 'deliver' is working correctly because local mail 
works fine.  I guess my question is, how does 'smail' need to 
be set up and does it need to run as a background proccess all 
the time in order for mail to be delivered/received to/from 
remote sites?

Also, I used 'mail' with the verbose mode turned on and I see a 
message that says something like:

     read error in output from '/usr/bin/uuname'
     
ANY suggestions would be helpful -- and please don't say "read 
the HOWTO" because I have and it doesn't seem to help me 
(perhaps it has the answer but I don't see it).  Thanks.

Physical_memory: 5309 Pages. ( 21745664 KBytes, 20.74 MByte )

There are some parameters here which show limits to my machine in its 
current configuration. It looks like I couldn't have 200 different login 
sessions going at once. There are probably some places in the kernel to 
change these parameters (Similar to SunOS?). Has anyone done this? 

For a machine dedicated to servicing many users doing FTP or similar 
processes, I/O bandwidth and RAM probably mean more than a hotter CPU 
once you are above a certain CPU minimum. 16 MB doesn't seem like enough. 
It certainly wouldn't be enough RAM for a Sparc to support 200 users in 
interactive sessions without lots of swapping, don't know about ftp  
sessions.
