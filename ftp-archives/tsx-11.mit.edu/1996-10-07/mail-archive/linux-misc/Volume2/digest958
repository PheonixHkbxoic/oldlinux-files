I guess I shall stick to Slackware for my recommendations still. It's a pity
because Yggdrasil has some great ideas, a commitment to free software and
seems to have their heart in the right place.

Subject: Reverse mtools for DOS?
Date: Mon, 17 Oct 1994 16:59:49 GMT

I'm in the situation where, by convention, I have to use DOS at work, 
although I prefer linux - which I use at home.  Most of my friends also use 
DOS...  (They've not seen the light ;)

I was wondering if there is something available like mtools, for DOS, i.e. 
reading, say, an ext2fs file system diskette from DOS?

I've not looked further into this idea yet, but would be willing to give it 
a bash (Hmm. Another idea: bash for DOS!  GACK!)

I could then have, say ext2fs on my floppies, and on ocasion, when I need to 
copy a file to DOS, I'll not have a problem...

At the moment most of my floppies are DOS formatted.  When I get something 
interesting by FTP (at work), I have to copy it onto a DOS disk. At home I 
then have to transfer everything back to linux, renaming truncated filenames 
as I go along!

So, am I the only one with this problem?

Let me know what you think...

Later

ABSOLUTELY agree with this!  Also decouple input enough so that any
complex input method can be written on top of the wp without much trouble,
definitely without modifying the source.

Several people I know well have used bits of NetBSD to replace some
unfortunate bugs in a Sun supplied operating system on the Sparc. In this
case they number of files replaced was probably considerably larger 8).

You might want to check out what I have done to `sc'.  Earlier in the
summer, I rewrote much of the user interface because I found it too `vi'
like.  Now it supports user defineable keymaps, Lotus style menus, and cells
are color coded, e.g., formulas in one color, numbers in another, strings
... etc.  It is all user customizable. It also now as GNU-like readline
capabilites for editing and recall of expressions.  Finally, I installed a
print menu item.  In have included a print filter for the HP inkjed 5xx
series that will allow me to print out any size spreadsheet that it can
handle.

All in all, it looks alot better.  It is available from amy.tch.harvard.edu
in pub/slsc (I call it slsc--- it still read/write sc files though).

The trouble is its multiple bugs :

o       People using newer kernels with PPP and installing the ppp.c/h from
        the package concerned
o       People with misconfigured modems
o       People with misconfigured ethernet
o       Faulty client software (eg older wintrumpet)
o       Linux bugs.

There's only been one fragmentation related bug fixed recently and that
was mishanding of the DF bit when using Linux as a router with some solaris
hosts (fixed in 1.1.52).

No Lars, he hit the point right on the head. While (La)TeX is a very powerful
tool, its level of interface is PERCEIVED (very important!) to be too low
level to be used effectively by the large majority of the Document perparation
crowd.

See we have two differing groups of folks here:

Group 1) Formatters are powerful. Everyone should use them.
Group 2) Formatters are hard to use. Everyone should use WordProcessors 
         instead.

I'm in Group 3) Put both out there and let people use what they want.

And we all have our pet peeves. Richard demands multilinqualness while mine
is that if all I have is a VT100 terminal and modem I should still be able to
WordProcess (not format. The interface is the real difference) without having
to resort to buying an ISDN line and an Xterminal.

Let's be inclusive people. The Linux movement is not in the practice of
excluding folk (especially industrious folk who write their own software ! ;-)
And one tool won't solve everyone's problems. So let's have 5 tools or 10 tools
or however many tools is makes so that each person can do the task the way they
want to.

to pull it together. I'd volunteer but I'm swamped.

Trying to fix the staircase effect of my HP DeskJet 500 printer,
I modified my printcap with an inclusion of a filter.

However, I got nothing and I got a status saying 
"waiting for myprinter to become ready (offline?)" but it is online.

I am newbie in the sense of printing, and I was wondering if anyone
could guide me.

Is there an input filter suitable for the HP Deskjet 500?
By the way, I ran the printer daemon "lpd" each time after I modified
printcap.

It's not so much a matter of what capabilities are included as what
capabilities are *pre*cluded by sloppy or narrow design.  The multi-
lingual "problem" is really only a problem because so many packages
have been designed without any thought that anyone would be using
them with up-down or right-left languages, and without any thought
that millions (billions?) of people on the planet are multilingual.
