Well, I am not a great source since I have only heard about NS.  But from
what I understand you need to redefine "high performance PC" to fit in with
NeXTSTEP.  A high performance Linux station is 486 or above with at least
8 megs (12 for X?).  My understanding is that for NS you need a bare minimum
of like 32 megs to get anything done.  I imagine it is huge, diskwise also.
I don't think you can use X without buying the software for NS.
I think NS probably does have better DOS/Windows compatibility, though.
Linux is only starting to get these.
Also, I don't think NS has any real future.  It is just too big and clumsy.

I don't see how these values work. With a 25 MHz clock, with total V. lines =
400, and total H. lines 225, we're looking at a refresh rate of roughly

25E6 / (400 x 1.1 x 225 x 1.05) = 240 

This is way above the spec of any monitor I'm familiar with. Or am I missing 
something obvious ?

Assume Ferrari decided not to sell their cars in Greenland.  Does that then
mean you have the right to steal it, put studded tyres onto it, and claim
to own it, just because you happen to drive it in Greenland only?

Of course, anyone else would be free to buy a Ferrari, put studded tyres on,
and then resell it in Greenland.  (I.e. anyone may offer to support SCO WP
in the Linux environment.)

I'm sorry you feel that way.  But your posting was simply inaccurate
regarding the issue of interface copyright.  It is a fact that Stallman
stomped on a source distribution of PGP that merely contained #ifdef's
so that it could be potentially linked with the gmp library, which was
protected by the GPL.  Sure, Stallman and the FSF couched it in very
legalistic terms, and then justified the means with the ends ("Free
Software is Good, so what we did is O.K.").  But that's not any
different from what Lotus did when they tried to use Copyright to
protect their user interface.  It was the same sort of legal mumbo-jumbo
that led to the same sort of result --- a restriction of who can write
independent programs that implement or use a particular interface,
whether that be a UI or an API.

I am very saddened by the FSF's decision to use this very broad
interpretation of the GPL.  I engaged in several e-mail messages
debating this issue with Stallman, over a year ago, when the PGP/gmp
issue came up, and he would not be moved.  He believes he is right, and
he is entitled to that belief.

However, my sadness does not extend to trying to ignore the situation
for what it is.  I will not sweep this situation under the rug.  People
are entitled to know *all* of the issues of the GPL, both its good side
and its shadow side.

However, I would like to reassure people that this has not prevented me
from writing and releasing things that fall under the GPL.  I've written
several programs which I've released under the GPL, and I encourage
others to do so.  However, I would have to think twice before deciding
to release the ownership of any significant amount of code to the FSF,
because of their interpretation of the GPL.  As long as I own the
copyright, I get to control how the GPL is interpreted, and I have
lattitude over granting exceptions to the GPL as I see fit.  If I sign
my code over to the FSF, I lose this control, and right now, I don't
trust the FSF enough to do that.  They have too much of a political
agenda which they are trying to push.

Every author has the right to make this decision for him or herself.  I
don't say that my views are the only right one.  However, I believe that
everyone is entitled to all of the facts, and you, Ian, did not include
all of those facts in an attempt to "reassure" people.  

I believe the cause of free software is best furthered by putting the
truth --- the whole truth --- on the table, and letting the chips fall
where they may.

Subject: [Q] How maintain "console" entry in utmp file??
Date: 12 Sep 1994 23:58:29 -0400

   I don't know if this question has been brought up before or not...I
would think it has...

   I wrote a small program to place "console" logins (from XDM) into
the utmp, wtmp, and lastlog files.
   However, at random times, some program eats the utmp entry. I think
it's getty, but I'm not sure. (I run getty so my roomate can log in on
ttyS1).
   This is on Linux 1.1.x, with XFree86.

   Right now, "w" says this:

 11:55pm  up  5:48,  4 users,  load average: 0.47, 0.13, 0.18
User     tty      from             login@  idle   JCPU   PCPU  what

awk      console                   9:33pm  2:22                -

   After my roommate logs out, the "console" line disappears. Can
anybody give some pointers? I can most likely fix the problem if I
knew what program is doing this.

   Somebody must have this functionality working on there Linux X
box...

   Thanks....

As we all know, Linux is the OS. X is not unix.
However...

I for one would feel cheated if all my applications didn't work under X.
X is the front end that allows me to make use of multi-tasking, and it's
what gives credibility when you are trying to convince people that you
don't need MS-Windows, because Linux is better.

Digging up an old thread, the only way I would like to be using SVGALIB
applications on a regular basis is this - the SVGALIB and a suitable
window manager/X patches allowed you to flip between full screen and X
windowed versions of SVGA programs. And it would be nice if the X versions
were portable.

It all comes down to whether we are trying to make Linux the world beating
OS, or Unix in general. You'll get a lot more software for free if we are
talking Unix.

I live on:

        Compaq Contura 4/25 with 12M RAM and 120M disk.
        Viva pocket fax 14.4k

12M is great for running emacs, make and gcc all at once :-).

I don't run X.  Partly I don't feel like, and partly I have better
things to do with that disk space (like tex).

I am on Linux (Slackware 2.0).

It works like a charm.  I have duplicated my entire work environment
on a Sun on the notebook.  When I landup at work I plug in a null
modem cable from the comport on the notebook into the serial port of
the SS5, this gives me a 38400 baud line.  Right now I do dialup
login, but I'll soon have SLIP running.

I have a dlink parallel port ethernet adapter but it doesn't quite
work for me.  Besides, I have only one 10baseT in my office and
it'd be a pain shuffling that between the Sun and the notebook.
So 38.4k serial port instead of 115k parallel port is fine.

        -ans.

Alliance covers so small subset of VHDL that it is virtually useless in
term of doing design using Alliance.  It may be a great tool to learn the VLSI
design-synthesis-layout-verification flow, but definitely not a VHDL
tool for design, IMHO.

Let me tell you what you can do in Alliance: Boolean functions, 
flip flops, muxes. That is all. No conditional statement (like if...then),
no sequential statement (like process), no file I/O (so don't expect to 
create test bench), and no arithmatic operations (like + - * /).  
Overall, you can not do behavioral modeling in Alliance.

Worset of all, all files in document directory were empty.

I wish I was wrong.  Using Alliance would save me $3K to buy Model 
Tech's package.  Again, it totally depends on what you are expecting out
of Alliance.  In term of a design modeling, I suggest you stay away
from Alliance.

        Another pointer, if they setup some way to indicate which copies of Doom

Except that 38.4 is kbit/s (actually less, because of the overhead of
start/stop bits) and 115 is kbyte/s :-)

So, the difference is more than one order of magnitude. But if it's fine
for you...

I recently conducted a straw poll in comp.os.linux.help regarding splitting
that group.  As a result of that poll, I've decided to propose the
following:

    1) Create comp.os.linux.help.hardware
    2) Create comp.os.linux.help.software
    3) Create comp.os.linux.help.video
    4) Create comp.os.linux.help.misc (comp.os.linux.help to be deleted)
    5) Create comp.os.linux.answers

From my article summarizing the poll results:
        
I received a total of 49 votes: 46 FOR, 3 AGAINST.  (A list of the e-mail
addresses is at the end of this article) [deleted]

There is clear support for a split of comp.os.linux.help along these lines. 
Among the comments received were suggestions for further splits of
c.o.l.help and the creation of other Linux-related groups.  (Complete
summary of responses available upon request.)  Based upon these comments,
I'll be proposing the following comp.os.linux.* re-organization:

    1. Replace comp.os.linux.help with:

        comp.os.linux.help.hardware
            For help with questions or problems specific to a particular
            piece of hardware.

        comp.os.linux.help.software
            For help with questions or problems not specific to a particular
            piece of hardware.

        comp.os.linux.help.video
            For help with questions or problems relating to video hardware
            or software.  I know this wasn't part of the original straw
            poll, and that comp.windows.x.i386 ought to be used, but many
            newbies don't know about c.w.x.i.

        comp.os.linux.help.misc
            For help with questions or problems that don't fit in any of the
            other help categories, e.g., if yoy don't know whether it's a
            hardware or software question.

    2. Create:
        comp.os.linux.answers
            For posting Linux FAQs and How-To's.  This will help keep the
            traffic down in the c.o.l.help.* groups--only a single "Read
            before posting"-type message will be required.
