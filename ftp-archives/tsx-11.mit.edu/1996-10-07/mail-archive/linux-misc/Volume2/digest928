Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted biweekly to
comp.os.linux.announce.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not a contribution to the development
of Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration
- should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

For two reasons:

1.  There is no guaranteed subset of POSIX that is portable across all
    "UNIX" platforms.

2.  It can be a painful chase through docs and header files to force
    POSIX on some systems.

I think that you are confused, Dan, between a relabled 66 MHz *system* and
a relabled 66 MHz *cpu*.  They simply put the 66 MHz chip on a 40 MHz
motherboard (which is also accomplished by changing the speed of the
motherboard) and...  TADA! - a 486DX2-80!

Well, I didn't actually *use* it, but I booted SLS on my 386SX/16 when it 
only had 2 meg.  I waited for 2 more meg before installing it.

To H.J.:  Go buy a 386DX/40.  I got one for $90 a while back, and it is 
*so* much faster.  The SX/16 board now waits to replace a dead 286.  (And

I bought this version three and half weeks ago as well.
I was very impressed with the installation program (as compared to
Unixware 1.1 AS). Very smooth and a hell of a lot more straightforward.
HOWEVER,
1.)  I have yet to get minicom to download using zmodem although I 
     can dial into my UNIX (BSD) Internet provider.
     Downloaded files using XMODEM protocol will not run, I get 
     segement errors. These programs include   unzip and joe .
     Yes, my settings are 8N1. 
2.) xmodem downloading adds a few hundred bytes to  .joerc 
    and other xmodem file transfers.
3.) Simple text editors like joe (give me joe any day I don't
    use emacs, I don't use vi ) are NOT included. @#$%@!!
    THIS IS MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT! 
    (If I had the  joe editor I could have a least done 
     other work). The   joe editor is specifically mentioned
     in your install manual. 
4.) Mounting a dos disk and copying using the 
    cp -p /mnt/unzip /home/root/unzip     command results 
    in a properly copied file BUT the binary can not execute.
5.) Attempting to use getty according to documentation does 
    not work. Therefore downloading known operating versions
    of files can not be accoplished.
6.) Ethernet 3C509TP can not ping another workstation on the same 
    LAN although Wollongong DOS drivers allow this.
7.) No BBS software on the CD although mentioned in the Bible.
    (If you have room for dup_ramdisk etc, you got room for this.
8.) No instructions in the manual on HOW to make Xwindows run from
    hda1 without having the /system_cd  mounted.
9.) The networking component is mentioned in your install manual
    (pg. 24) but is not available in the install_component list
    nor is it mentioned in the errata file, nor does it install
    properly from the Xwindows.
10.) MS-DOS MSCDEX will not activate CDROM properly, and 
     bootflpy.3in hangs after the letters   'LI' appear on the 
     screen. (The story behind this is that UW 1.1 AS was used to
     copy this file and  RAWRITE.EXE to a DOS PC. So that I could 
     create a second install disk. The first install disk that came
     with the package operates fine.

Other than these few insurrmountable hurdles, things are just ducky! NOT!
Before yggdrasil dumps on me, yes I ftp'd errata from your ftp 
site 1 day after purchasing the package.
I guess its my own fault. As consumers we should expect thirty-nine
dollar performance from a $39.00 (plus tax) Unix. I'll be happy to
post more problems as I come across them.

Agreed.  I purchased a machine suitable for running a MUSH (486/66, 1GB, 32MB)
for about $2900, and we received it within about 7 days.  And it was good
quality parts too.  Genoa MB, Quantum HD, Adaptec, etc.  Fired up as

system, Fintronic has a good deal.

This is directly out of the Plug-and-Play manual:

======= start of cut text ==============
For a single user system, we recommended that the swap partion be large
enough to give a total virtual memory size (RAM+swap) of at least 16 MB,
possibly up to 32 MB. [...]
======= end ============================

Please read the manual during installation.  In the future, we will make
the recommendation more of a requirement.

Of course, it is still quite possible to create a swap file manually
during installation if you skip over the swap option...

The ones with slackware are really UGLY!  One that I tried (maybe all of

had to top windows to do anything).

Of course, my .fvwmrc is my pride and joy, but as usual, it is pining

Do many Linux users use than MS-Windows crap (top and click to type)?

I don't think it IS classified as experimental, do you have this from 
Yygdrasil, or is this your assumption because you failed to get it to work?
If you have a memory manager in your config.sys, that could probobly 
screw you up.  Have you stripped your config.sys down to nothing but 
your  CD-ROM driver?

If you have a sony 31a running off the sony driver, then you need the 
revision B boot disk and system stuff.   Have you gotten that yet?
(Its mentioned in the errata.)
