Besides which, as I recall, single user mode gives one much more control

Ah, I have a problem with this.  I don't thin kyou are doing people any 
favors here.  All you are doing is delayign the inevitable day that sit 
down at another unix system thinking  they 'know' it, and none of their 
commands work!

Now, if you wanted to build batch files that printed out "try <unix 
command>" whenever they typed a dos command, THAT i see as a useful 
learnign tool...

Why on earth do you want to cripple UNIX?  There are plenty of commands 
on my system i have never used, but they are there so that when I DO need 
them, I ahve them available.  They don't 'get in my way' so why remove 
them? Also, unless you expurgate the man pages as well, you are just 
setting up a formula for frustration when they learnt o use amn and then 
find whats in it doesnt exist on their system

>
>Agreed, no need for vi or emacs.  Go with joe or pico.

I'll disagre here too.  The one thing about vi is that it is ALWAYS 
available.  I have found that I am in demand at work to answer vi 
questiosn all the time for people who were 'never going to use it' and 
then find them,selves in a vanilla unics enviuronment where their 
favorite editor hasn't been installed.

I wont say vi is great, or even good when it comes to interface, but it 
IS powerful and ALWAYS there.

Again, why eliminate this just to eliminate it??? Uts beter to keep the 
optiosn open so your users can grow.  Also, what do you mean when you say 
'no networking'.  Certain basic network services, such as sockets, are 
so built into UNIX that you will break code that lives locally if you 
remove them. One of the ncie thiungs about UNXI networkign is this 
transparency...

>re: No scsi
Oh. So you want  to DECREASE the number of users who can use your 
system??? PArdon me, but thsi is just bizzare.

But what about mice? They are STILLgoing to have to through some 
configuration anyway.  Its enough just to give reasonable defaults (now, 
if you want to make std_vga16 the default, thats fine, though thats what 
I have and its a VERY small X screen... just about unusable...)

If you want to make this thing accessible, though, stay FAR AWAY from 
making it necessreay to use X to use or configure the system.  Many user 
(such as myself) don't have 8+meg of memory and arent about to spend the 
money.  Ther SCO admin-shell approach is alot friendlier to the wallet.

To me this stinks of windows-pandering. Rather then saying 'if windows

software to choose from.  I would suggest:
        1) A WSYWIG word processor
        2) A good spreadsheet
        3) A friendly database

I have similar feelings.  But since  CD-ROMs costs $1.50 to press in bulk

Yeah i think you are wasting your time.  Among other thinsg you have 
comepletely ignored what I consider to be the BIGGEST problem with asking 
DOS/Windows user to use UNIX-- administration.  A DOS or Windows system 
can be set up and more or less left alone and it will continue to run 
properly.  A UNIX system needs a certain level of 
administration/maintainence.  I don't thin kyou can change thgis. UNIX's 
biggest strength is its multi-user cpapabilities, these also lead to its 
admin needs.  If you eliminate that, you might as well use OS/2 (or even 
DOS).

FInally, if you DO get peopel to use this thing, for all of the rasons I 
listed above, they will be lost when they try to use any OTHER UNIX 
station, so i don't see that you've taught them anything.

Sorry to be so negative, but thats how I see it.

Subject: Shared Memory IPC
Date: 28 Sep 1994 06:43:31 GMT

I'm working on a project that needs to use a shared memory
block for interprocess communication in Linux.  (I know there are
better ways for doing IPC, but this project specifically REQUIRES
shared memory.)  In particular, I'd like to be able to map memory
pages from process A into the memory space of process B.

I was thinking that the phys() mmap() functions might help, but
according to my man page, phys() is not implemented.

Any suggestions would be most appreciated (e-mail or post)!
