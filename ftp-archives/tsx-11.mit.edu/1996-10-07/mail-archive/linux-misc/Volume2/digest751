No, no, no!  He needs to put the monitor up above his head.  Don't you
know that electrons go faster downhill?  It's this thing called
"gravity".  Any six-year-old knows this.

   I have a similar problem.  I have a Dell 486P/50 (ISA bus) with 24MB of RAM.
(IDE disk, ATI Vantage video, Wangtek QIC-02 tape.)  POST reports 24 MB.  Dell
UNIX (this machine's former OS) used all 24.  Help?  It would be really useful
for what I'm doing.

   I think I've read the FAQ and HOW-TO and whatever, but I may have left
something out.  Anyone?  I've tried it with both 1.0.9 and 1.1.49 kernels
with CONFIG_MAX_16M set both ways.  I know there are problems with >16M on
ISA systems, but since I didn't buy this one (it's been here two years
longer than I have) I won't take the blame for that.

   ???  Thanks.

Hi,

Im about to purchase a new video card, ATI Ultra Pro VL-bus.
I have heard that these cards have different RAMDAC's. Which

I've heard.

Which XFree-server version is the best to use ??

I've got a 486-66 /w 8 megs and a trident 8900cl (not 16 MHz), both of which
should give slower performance than your system.  But my linuxdoom is just fine
in full window size.  I think it is even faster than dos, but it will probably
slow down when I turn on sound.  I think you just have some kind of setup 
problem.  Does it say "using MIT-SHM" when is starts up?

It's one MIPS - two MIPS.  Anyway.  The BogoMIPS number is a
measurement of how fast your machine does absolutely nothing.

Huh? I know QDOS as a separate product. Sort of in the lvein of 4DOS. Is

I felt not *threatened* but vexed by something I felt as a slight to my
ethics and professionalism. If you want to clarify your statements and
seek a solution, it is fine with me.

Right you are. And as you followed this thread, you should have seen this fact
before. But although the merger of Novell-WP did not escape me, it certainly 
didn't and doesn't interest me, because my interest is in software, not
finance.

Me again:
Heaven just threw an english dictionary down (missed too!) and it  pointed out
that "departments" generally are inside the same organisation. If I use that
word, it indicates that I am aware of both products belonging to the
same firm. In holland that does not mean that there may not be 'presidents'
of the separate departments, but perhaps I should use the word 'director'?
No, doesn't sound right. How do you call the boss of Wordperfect INSIDE the 
Novell-WP company in the english language?

Anyway, rest assured. If our editor-in-chief wants a story about mergers
she certainly asks somebody else. If she wants a piece on the working of
software or design philosophy, she (sometimes) asks me.

And to flaunt your academic titles is childish. I don't either do I?
BTW if you are so alert on your titles, try to write my name correctly.

I can see that you rather would prefer articles about the financial activities
of your firm than about the qualities of Unixware. :-)
But thanks for the waring. I will spread the word under my collegues
that disagreeing with Herr Doktor M. Sohnius s.s.t.t. on Internet will get
them in trouble when they want to write about Novell or Wordperfect.

There are some things we who are contributing to PCM do not do. One is
accepting bribes.  And the other is letting personal pique get in the
way of our professional opinion (for what it is worth). I would like
to think that your ethics are the same.  Again I feel quite vexed with
your opinion about the way I judge software I get for review.

If I translate your signature as "the goal justifies the means" I cannot
help but doubt your high-handed approach to ethics.

Martin (and everybody else on this thread): I do not want a quarrel with
you (except for the normal. light-hearted flamewars). But if you think
to attack me on my ethics or professionalism, you better count your
cojones first.



Paai.

The pixeldoubling and -tripling has been fixed.  Here is a script that
will solve the DOOMWADDIR problem (at least, sort of).  Install it as
/usr/local/bin/doom, and stick all the DOOM! files in /usr/local/lib/doom.

#!/bin/bash
#
# The Linux version of DOOM! doesn't seem to like it if the .wad files
# aren't in the current directory when playing.  Solve this problem in
# an extremely klugy fashion.
#
# This script makes DOOMWADDIR work as advertised, and also implements
# an environment variable DOOMSAVEDIR, where your DOOM! saved games appear.

No it doesn't.  DOS (as in MS-DOS) stands for Dirty Operating System.
If you don't believe me, I suggest you check out what the *original*
name of the product was.

        /hpa

P.S. You will *not* find the correct answer in any book from Microsoft
Press.

P.P.S. Answer below for the impatient.



The original name for the glorified boot loader now known as MS-DOS
was QDOS, which stood for Quick and Dirty Operating System.  Note that
the letter Q has since been dropped.

You can use something like this:

void init_colors ()
{
    hascolors = has_colors ();
    if (hascolors){
        start_color ();
        init_pair (1, COLOR_WHITE, COLOR_BLUE);   /* normal */
        init_pair (2, COLOR_BLACK, COLOR_CYAN);   /* selected */
        init_pair (3, COLOR_YELLOW, COLOR_BLUE);  /* marked */
        init_pair (4, COLOR_YELLOW, COLOR_CYAN);  /* marked/selected */
        init_pair (5, COLOR_WHITE, COLOR_RED);    /* errors */
        init_pair (6, COLOR_WHITE, COLOR_CYAN);   /* menu entry */
        init_pair (7, COLOR_BLACK, COLOR_WHITE);  /* reverse b&w */
    }
}

And then just use: wattron (window, COLOR_PAIR(n)).

Hope this helps,
Miguel.
