I`m running 1.1.22 on a 386sx 16, with 8MB.  before i "acquired" the 8
MB, though, I always got the kernel panic stuff when i tried to install.
it`s not too terribly slow, but big compiles, like the kernel, still take
a good hour or two.  BTW, i`m looking to upgrade- does anyone have 
an idea of which would be better: a 486slc40 or a 386dx40 w/CP ?
i`m sure it depends a lot on the applications, but does anyone have a
general idea?

NCD has an unsupported Linux version of Xremote/xinitremote

NCD (I'm sure they have a newer version than I have).

If what you are looking for is a version of X11 that connects
to a workstation running xinitremote, then you'll need to look
at other solutions.  It's probably not in their interest to 
supply software that allows linux boxes to replace their Xterminals
(although they sell DOS/Windows software; "PC-Xremote" I believe,
which supports Xremote.)

Either you have a problem in the PCI configuration (board jumpered
wrong, mother board jumpered wrong, extended CMOS setup specifying
wrong IRQ for that slot, etc), or a defective main BIOS which isn't
initializing the board's PCI configuration registers correctly.

It's probably a bad CMOS setting, although many older boards are 
defective.

DOS doesn't use hardware interrupts.

Chances are, if you buy a 28.8 now, it won't work "tomorrow."  The
v.34 standard HAS been released, but we are finding out that modem
manufacturers have their own ideas about how that standard is
implemented.  A couple of our users have purchased USR's v.34 
offering, only to find out it won't connect to the 14.4's it had 
been using earlier.  The same garbage happened when v.32bis hit
the streets; modem manufacturers (especially those using Rockwell
chipsets) didn't sell units that were worth the paper their manuals
were printed on.  It took a while (SUPRA took over a year) to get
units out that were "passable."  

My suggestion (it's worth exactly what you paid for it)?  Wait until
next year (about six months) and re-evaluate.  When we upgrade, it
will run about $450/modem (that's just for the daughterboards).
With a couple of hundred in use, we want to make sure we don't 
have an ongoing compatibility issue.  In the meantime, we offer 
free ISDN to our users in lieu of 28.8 access.

        I have linux running on an AMI Atlas VIP motherboard with a 90MHz
Pentium.  I also have an ATI Graphics Pro Turbo (Mach64), NE2000 (Novell-
Mycrodyne), and a Sound Blaster 16 ASP.  It works great.

        I also have an Adaptec 2940 (Fast SCSI-2) controller card with
a Fast SCSI-2 hard drive.  Linux does NOT recognize it.  I have borrowed

        We had a similar problem, but only when people were

 Ok thats what I do here.I use kermit. WHat I do is this.

call up kermit set the line /dev/cua0 (you can use what ever line)
then set speed 38400
hit c which brings me to the term part then dial the number to the

I then hit cntrl \ c which brings me back to the kermit prompt. I then 
issue this command.

!nohup pppd /dev/cua0 crtscts -d defaultroute 38400 -detach 

brings the connect right up no problems. There may be a easier way to do 
this but it works for me. Also do you have a ip address assigned to you. 
If not I would ask them to do this.

Oh, I thought, bootmsgs go to nowhere.  The only relieable is, that
the last kernel messages are stored in the kernel and can be showed
using `dmesg'.  It's on your own to add lines like

You should locate your mount binary.   Perhaps it's in /bin/mount or
may be something during your installation went wrong.   (I've never
seen such problems. -- Try a new installation from scratch and make
sure that you install the base set at least.)

Dito.

The prompt is configured to show you your current directory.  The
tilde is a synonym for your home dir (root's homedir is /root).
Normally you will be set to your homedir after login.   If you cd
somewhere it should be showed up in you prompt.  (You can change this
behaviour by changing the PS1 and PS2 environtment variables.  (See
man bash for details.)

I can't advise you anything, because I don't know the Panasonic.  And

The known Mitsumi drivers don't use the interrupt anyway, so perhaps
it could be disabled and the code could be cleaned up to prevent the
driver occupying an interrupt.

But  --- I'm in progress of rewriting the driver so it will use the
interrupt.  I can't see any problem.  You can select the interrupt on
the controller card of the mitsumi and then you have to set it in
mcd.h to reflect the controller settings.  (Just in same manner you
have to do it now.)


It's written about Mitsumis unability in reading XA Disks (Photo CD?).
But it's written too, that it's a drivers problem, not a problem of
the drive.  The currently knwon drivers don't seem to support the XA
disks.  -- It's on somebody's  own (perhaps on my) to do any effort to
the driver to make it XA-able.
