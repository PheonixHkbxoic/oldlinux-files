Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

In one of the HOWTO's, it mentions doing a 
     strings uugetty | grep "/etc/defaults"
to verify that you have the right version.  I installed Slackware 2.0, and the 
versions of getty there did not support the conf.uugetty.* setup.

I have a Future Domain TMC-1660ER which I use with Windows NT and OS2
connected to access an IBM ( Toshiba ) CDROM drive.  I recently
purchased the Yggdrasil Plug and Play package.  On booting, the system
does not detect the SCSI interface.  I have configureed the card to use
the BIOS and also I have tried disabling the BIOS and booting linux with

Is anyone else using this interface that could offer a suggestion. Any

No, I did some testing, and argv[0] seems to always be the command name
that is used to execute the command; if it is found by virtue of being
in the user's search path, only the command name itself is there.

In shell scripts, however, $0 seems to be the full path to the script,
or the path relative to the current directory when the script is started.
It is easy enough for the script to tell which, by virtue of a leading /.

So a shell script wrapper can be used to tell your program where it lives,
through environment variables, executing the real program using the full
path (and thus passing argv[0] the way the original poster likes), or
an extra argument.

Subject: Green Motherboards
Date: Thu, 25 Aug 1994 01:03:36 GMT

Sorry if this is the wrong newsgroup, but I really don't know where to ask
this one.

I just purchased a 486DX2-66 green motherboard.  This is the kind of
motherboard with the option to half the power to devices which are inactive
after a certain period of time, and then reset the power consumption upon
any sign of device activity.

I know that this works very well for DOS, which doesn't really care what is
happening to the system it is on.  I wonder though, will Linux react
favourably to devices having their power cut in half, without raising a
fuss?  Since my systems are running 24 hours a day, I'd be interested in
upgrading all of my systems to green motherboards, so long as Linux will
handle them well.

At the same time, I don't want to cause problems by trying it.  I've had
unusual experiences with self-caching hard-drives hooked to Linux, and don't 
want to go through this again.

Anybody else have a green motherboard, with these options enabled?

Thanks for any information.

looking for a good presentation creation program or a flowcharting tool

I'm trying to replace my application base of MS-Office with X11/Linux

If I can get rid of DOS/Windows, I'd be very very happy.  But I need these

Matt, at least some versions of Perl can run suid scripts?  How?  By
making /usr/bin/perl setuid root and have that binary handle the
permissions/security stuff.  This is THE RIGHT WAY to handle *any*
language which securely can run setuid programs, and can be done on a
language-by-language basis.

That also begs the question of whether or not your message was

This has already been done several times, by utilizing the /proc
filesystem (which is the only way to do it).  Linus has rejected the
patches every time.

        *** Explanation for anyone who missed this thread last time ***

When the kernel detects a shell script (magic number "#!") it will do
the usual checks for accessibility, then open the file to read the
command processor.  Then it exec's the *command processor* with the
filename on the command line.  The command processor than opens the
file in user space: race condition.

The alternative proposed was passing the file argument as a file
descriptor through the /proc filesystem; however, all of a sudden you
have an essential kernel service *dependent* on having the /proc
filesystem properly mounted; in fact, the patches I saw all hard-coded
the name /proc and used it for all shell scripts.  I am not too sure
how well the system startup would have dealt with that.

However, once again I am saying that this is the Wrong Thing to do.
The kernel should assign the new process with the privileges by the
user and the *binary* executed, which is the command processor.  If
the command processor can handle setuid scripts, and the sysadmin
wants to enable them, it should be run as setuid root and convey the
privileges itself.
