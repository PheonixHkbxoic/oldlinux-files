Hi, netters.
I just bought this Linux CD-ROM, but I found out that Yggsdrasil uses
non-standard file system of their own.
Does it cause any problem?
Please let me know.

DOOM v1.666 for Linux using X is available at:

The .lsm is also there.  Read it before downloading.  Both of these
may be moved if the sysadmin discovers them.  If you don't already
have the DOS v1.666 data file, it's at the same place but called
doom1wad.tgz.

If you have bought registered DOOM or have pre-ordered DOOM II, you
may use the data files from either on it.  If you've pirated either
file, you suck demon phallus.

WARNING: If you don't know what DOOM is and are getting plenty of
things done at school or work, you do NOT want to download this
program.

There are two WAD files(*) -- the shareware one and the registered
one.  I own registered DOOM, and the WAD is "doom.wad".  For the
shareware one, it's "doom1.wad".  As long as the tgz file contains
only the doom1.wad file, it should be legal.

Good news for Linux fans as well as Canadian tax payers. 

However, although the OS may be on the cheap, the location is not.

Subject: Text screen is not restored after exiting from X-windows
Date: Fri, 9 Sep 1994 21:07:26 GMT

Hi!

        I just got X-windows running under linux, but the only problem so
far is the following:

        When I exit a window manager, i.e. fvwm, I expect to return to the 
text screen from which I had invoked startx, the script to run X-windows.
However, my screen becomes distorted with a flickering green pseudo-rectangle
and I can never returned to the text screen mode (console).

        I need to reboot in order to have the system running again.

        I hope somebody can help me out.  My computer consists of the 
following:

        AST Advantage Plus 486dx2-66
        16 MB RAM
        ATI Mach 32 chipset on a local bus
        17" Panasonic 1795E (PanaSync) which complies with VESA standards

        I heard from a friend that ATI might cause some problems.  Is that
true, and if so, what sort of problems?  If not , what can be causing my 
problem of not being able to return to text mode after exiting X-windows.

        Any remedies or utility to fix this ?  

Thanks,
Ren

 I just FTP'ed the latest version of Gnu Gopher from

wasn't very important.  I set it up with the sample
menus and such but when I run 'gn', nothing appears
on the screen and if I press the <enter> key, it shows
what looks like the .cache file to the screen and drops
back to the prompt. I don't see the traditional gopher menu with a
selector prompt and such at all. Does anybody have a clue as to what
I should do?

I think that you have a problem with video. I had the same problem which I

replacing it with a very basic declaration like the one said to work with

it sould work with that, and then you can try other configurations .

Uh...they have several live "kernels" on the CD.  I think what you meant to 
say was that they have a live filesystem (slackware) on the CD that you can 
mount and use.  This live filesystem does not have X installed, but you can 
install that from one of the distributions.

        Hmm. 

: Yeah ... fingering help@idsoftware.com reveals the same message re: Linux 
: port as it has for the last two months: "RSN!! RSN!!"

        I suppose you speak in ignorance. :)  It's out, and
available from sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/Incoming and at
dewdrop.water.ca.gov in /pub/doom as the file lnxdoom.tgz

Enjoy folks!  *grin*


: Seriously, IMHO Doom will probably be more useable in the promised 
: pixel-doubling mode than in a straight 320x200.  Easier to make things 
: look innocent when the boss walks in ... "Hey, you're not actually 
: _working_ in 320x200, are you?"

        Well, a couple of things... I've tried it in pixel doubling
mode, and not only is it slower, but the display is broken.  It looks
like you are looking through one of those windows with glass ribs.
Also... if you should happen to be one of those that actually play
games at work, you might want to know that Ctrl-Alt-+ and Ctrl-Alt--
change X11 resolutions on the fly at the Linux console. :)

        So.... 320x200 resolution anyone? :)
I'll post if I figure out how to do it.

Thanks,
