If they've included the Slackware source tree, then yes, it does indeed 
have all of the GPL'd source.

Hello,

I've had Linux Doom (the original and patched) available via anon
FTP for the last few days on a very temporary basis, but I've gotten
a few messages suggesting that I keep it available for a few more
days, since some people are having problems getting a copy from
sunsite.unc.edu.  I have no problem with that.

The following files are available at nightfall.stu.wfu.edu (152.17.202.100)

/pub/doom/linux/linxdoom.tgz      [latest version of Linux X Doom]
/pub/doom/linux/linxdoom.lsm      [original lsm, use this during install]
/pub/doom/linux/linxdoom.lsm.new  [a quick note from ddt Re: patch]
/pub/doom/linux/doom1wad.tgz      [shareware wad file]
/pub/doom/dos/dm1_2rpt.zip        [registered Dos Doom 1.1 -> 1.2 patch]
/pub/doom/dos/dm1666rp.zip        [registered Dos Doom 1.2 -> 1.666 patch]

All the files have been checked and contain no errors.  The anon FTP
service will disappear probably at the end of this week.  Please do not
upload any files to the incoming directory.

Dave.

Why not use that one again? All files in termnet-2.0.4-Linux-bin are build with the library of term 2.0.4 so you don't need to change the file of the term package.

Otherwise: check whether you have done the installation following the README 
file in the package or not and if you have made the changes to some files mentioned in that README.

Then check file permissions, ownerships (also of group) of all the files
including /usr/local/lib/term/private/socket.

I also have had this problem and it came out that file permissions were wrong.

The linxdoom.tgz file on sunsite appears to be corrupt? As no one else here
seems to have reported any problems, I tried twice to download it, made sure
I had binary mode set etc.. but gzip still says it doesnt pass its crc.

The file is:

and gzip -t says:
gzip: linxdoom.tgz: invalid compressed data--crc error

Can anyone point me to an ftp site that has a good copy of doom?

Reply-To: sean.l.gilley@att.com
Date: Tue, 13 Sep 1994 14:22:29 GMT

As I'm just about to install a couple of 300M disks, I've got a question
about partitioning.

My current system contains two IDE drives, one 100M and the other 60M.
I plan to keep the 60M for DOS, and use the 100M for my Linux root
partition.  I'll probably transfer /usr to one of the new drives, as
space on that drive is tight.

So I install these 300M drives.  I know I've been told that drives with
more than one partition run faster than drives with a single partition.
I got a guess or two, but can someone give me a definitive answer as to
why this is true, if it is true?

And other than that, is there a reason to partition the drives into
multiple partitions?

Thanks,

Sean.

We are planning to release a piece of commercial software for both
System V Release 4.2 and Linux.

On Linux, the program will be compiled with GCC and linked with the
stanard shared libc.

I have been following the debate about what the GPL does and does not
cover.  I have read (again) the GPL and the LGPL.

I have hexdumped the binaries we are planning to sell.

As far as I can tell, there is no reason for our software to infringe
the GPL/LPGL.  They include no code from static libraries.  Macros and
other header features are all under the 10-line limit (to the best of
my research).

Can anyone think of anything else that might prevent us from shipping
a Linux version of this software, from a licencing viewpoint?

This, I think, must be a difference between the US and UK Copyright
law.  My understanding is that Ian is correct for the UK: copyright is
implicit on any work.  Of course, I stand to be corrected.  And European
copyright law is a whole other kettle of fish...

Oh, and a few support programs use ncurses... But that appears to clearly
state that we can distribute it if we don't charge for it.  (Of course,
we are only charging for our code!)  I assume that covers the statically
linked object files...

Subject: missing library routines (linux, gcc 2.5.8)
Date: 13 Sep 94 18:40:46 GMT


I'm trying to compile a program which uses the remainder(), the nextafter()
and the ilogb() library routines. These routines are not present on the
system I'm using (linux, gcc 2.5.8).

Is it possible to install another libm.a which includes these routines?

Any help is appreciated.

Subject: QUESTION: transferring files between file systems???
Date: Tue, 13 Sep 1994 05:48:19 GMT


Hello everyone,

What would be the most efficient way to transfer files from a single file
system in drive X to multiple file system in drive Y???

More specifically I have:

/dev/hdb2 whose mount point is at a / (root) (i know... dumb...)

and I would like to transfer entire file system to a different drive (SCSI)
which has multiple filesystems (finally...), /dev/sda2, /dev/sda5 to 
/dev/sda14 with various mount points. /dev/sda2 will be mounted at root with
boot Linux kernel, vmlinuz.

I would like to AVOID re-installing the Linux software if i can.  I DO have
a complete backup of /dev/hdb2 filesystem on a tape (4mm) and I should be
able to simply restore (via tar...) to SCSI unit.

If I can just do these transfers, I can tell LILO to boot from /dev/sda2 
rather than /dev/hdb2.....

Oh well, thanks everyone in advance... 

- george

PS Is there something i can do with /etc/fstab, i.e. first copy just the
   necessary files manually to root in /dev/sda2 and unmount /dev/hdb2
   then re-mount from new SCSI file systems.  Would using tar now sort
   of fool Linux in restoring to SCSI drive since /dev/hdb2 has been
   unmounted??? Hmmmm...
