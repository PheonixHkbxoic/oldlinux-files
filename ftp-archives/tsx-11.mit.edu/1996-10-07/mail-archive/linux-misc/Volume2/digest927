Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly to
comp.os.linux.announce.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not a contribution to the development
of Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration
- should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

I still saw the problem at 1.1.51 (but not yet at 1.1.52) but only with 
FTPD on Linux and only when the FTP client came in via PPP (pre latest
alpha).

I have no trouble with Linux as a client nor with FTPD when the client
comes in via Ethernet.

Implication: The problem is caused by some interaction between PPP (or SLIP)
and FTPD. (??)

I have not had a chance to test 1.1.52 or Al's latest PPP version in this
context.

I will try to do that this week.

Cheers, 
Stephen.

Well, there it was a misfeature, causing quite a lot of complaints.
The trick there was to use /sbin/lilo -R in some /etc/rc* to set the

Hi,

Is anyone currently working on a filesystem that would provide
transparent access to files over ftp?  I've seen that GNU would like
to see such an fs in their Hurd system, and I'd be interested in
getting in touch with anyone working in this area on Linux.

Peace, Ben

I responded to that QNX 'ad' (or whatever it should really be categorized) by
repeating what I had heard a couple years ago, by a person who hadn't liked
QNX a number of years before that.  I got responses indicating that QNX has
matured quite a lot since that time and may realistically deserve attention.
Certainly everything I've heard makes it sound like a real performing
monster...  And they've put major effort into standards conformance, have
solid Posix compliance and so on.

Just thought I'd be big enough to apologize for flaming without justification.

Could some kind soul please email me an address for SyQuest in Armerica

An Australian direct dealer would be even more help. 

I need a 270 Meg internal (ide or scsi + card) with around 6-7 carts (or 
less if I can get a deal) for my linux box. But here the prices are huge,
and I want to see if I can source one myself (or pass an address onto a
local dealer)

If anyone has one of the above (+ tapes) for sale, I would also be 
interested in that (prefer Australia somewhere)

Also, anyone have any info on the new 540 SyQuests? Release date? price?

Thanx for any replies in advance, but please email only if possible.

Subject: chat \q option
Date: 12 Oct 1994 04:34:06 GMT

Does anyone know the proper use of the \q option in a chat script?
It's supposed to prevent a string from being logged by logging
"???????" instead.

My script has to send my password to the terminal servers here twice.
So, I prefaced each instance of my password with a \q.  The result was
that every string that was sent between the two, inclusive of the
first one, was a "???????".  Then the second one and all further
output was clear text.  So, I figured, "Hmmm, it must work by toggling
the output off and on" and I put \q before and after each password.
Then chat ignored all the \q's and just put everything in the log in
clear text.

Any ideas as to the proper syntax for this option?  Can someone show
me an example script using it, and the output it generates?

Thanks for any help...

What are you talking about?  Have you TRIED Linux on your PS/2?  I am
running a network server at the office right now - it is a PS/2 Model
70!

The main issues with Linux and MCA bus machines is that the methods used 
to autodetect adapter cards, etc, do not work the same in the PS/2.  For 
example, the PS/2 internal ESDI drives are non-standard.  However, 
patches are available for Linux that fix that.  I am using an Adaptec 
AHA-1640 SCSI adapter, which looks like an ISA based AHA-1542 to Linux.  
My Ethernet adapter is an IBM Ethernet Adapter /A, which is essentially 
an MCA version of an SMC Ultra.  However, I had to modify the SMC-ULTRA 
driver slightly - hard coding the addresses, etc (autodetect problem), 
and added some setup code.

Let me know if you are interested in the SMC driver....

NOTE:  I don't intend for this post to be saying that TeX is the Linux
version of a word processor.  Any TeX user knows that to compare TeX to a
word processor is to compare apples and oranges.  TeX is a typesetting
system, and is designed (and used) with a completely different set of goals
than those intended for word processors, desktop publishing systems, and so
on.

In the case of TeX (and LaTeX, if you insist...), there is no problem
at all with sharing the document between platforms---the file is just
a plain ASCII file.  Nice and simple.  And if we're talking about the
DVI file, that's no problem either.  Remember, DVI == DeVice Independent.

>If software for Linux can't do this, then it
>should be able to read it plain text and translate the 
>"lf" characters.  In the case of a Mac, this is ^M.

As mentioned above, the file *IS* plain text.  And for the rest, I've
obviously misunderstood your question.  To me, it reads as if you're
saying that there needs to be some way of converting between various
line endings (LF on UNIX, CR/LF on dog, etc.), but this is a trivial
task.

Just in case I haven't missed something, here's a short script that
converts dos files (CR/LF) to UNIX format (LF).  You can read the sed(1)
man page, or better yet, ``The UNIX Programming Environment'' to find
out how to expand this.

===========================  CUT HERE  ===========================
#!/bin/sh

for i in $*
do
   echo working on $i
   sed 's/^M$//' $i > /tmp/$$.tmp
   mv /tmp/$$.tmp $i
done
===========================  CUT HERE  ===========================

Of course, the ``^M'' (two characters) is supposed to be a '^M'.  You'll
need to replace it with a ^M (^V^M in vi, don't know if the '^V' is
needed in emacs or not).

>I think it can be acceptable to translate a formatted document on
>one platform to plain text to be formatted on another platform.

Again, with TeX, there is no need to transfer a formatted document.  Just
transfer the source code, and let the other person work with it if they
want to.  Otherwise, if you don't want them to work with it, you might
just want to transfer a DVI file, and let them print it, display it, etc.,
with whatever output driver is appropriate for their hardware.

>However, thus far, I have been unable to get a Linux text editor like
>emacs to do a search and replace of the ^M lf character.  

I'm not familiar with how emacs implements regular expressions, but in
vi, it would simply be :%s/^M$//g     (again, that's ^V^M to get a ^M
character).  You can probably use the exact same regular expression in
emacs---I assume it implements regular expressions, as that's pretty
standard in UNIX.  RTF-emacs-M for details on using regular expression
searches or search/replace---I don't use emacs, so I don't know how it's
done, but I can't imagine it not being supported.

Even if you can't get emacs to do it, that doesn't stop you.  Remember,
there are a *LOT* of other ways of doing something like this in UNIX.
The sed script shown above is just one way...you could write a short
filter program in C.  You could also grab the source to the ``pep''
program that was posted to one of the *.sources groups (no idea which
one) at some point in the past (don't remember when, but it at least
as far back as 1990, and I think I had it before then).  Or you could....
And the list goes on.  Don't assume that the editor has to do
everything---UNIX doesn't work that way.
