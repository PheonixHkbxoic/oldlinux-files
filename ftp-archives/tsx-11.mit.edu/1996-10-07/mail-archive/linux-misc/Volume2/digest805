Subject: SURVEY: Graphics card benchmarks under XFree86 (23 Sep 94)
Date: 23 Sep 1994 09:26:59 GMT

Archive-name: xfree86-benchmarks
Version: $Id: index.post,v 1.28 1994/09/15 05:29:29 fbm Exp fbm $

These are the latest results from a survey of xbench results under XFree86.

The idea of the survey is to compile a comprehensive set of benchmark results,
obtained by running xbench against all the main 386/486/586 graphics cards,
and thereby place the graphics cards in an approximate performance ranking.
Ideally all the results should be gathered using the same host machine,
on the same day of the week, while wearing the same socks and jocks.
Unfortunately no-one has yet come forward with such a database (although
such databases are rumoured to exist).  This survey is the next best thing.

The summary results below distill the essence of the survey into single line
entries.  The entries are grouped by XFree86 release number, and ranked
in decreasing 'xstone' order (last column) within each group.
Ranking by xstones is a bit arbitrary.  It is instructive to examine
all the other columns too.

The xbench survey has a home on the World Wide Web, at

    http://thumbtack.bevc.blacksburg.va.us/xbench/

If you have acess to a Web browser, check it out!  It is at least
6 x 10^24 times better than this plain old Usenet posting, in lots of ways.

New additions to this database are always welcome - especially entries for
the latest servers or for unlisted graphics cards.  If you use XFree86,
you can contribute to this survey.  Grab a copy of xbench, make sure it
has the GraphicsExposures patch (see below), run it on your machine,
fill in the blank form provided below, and mail it back to me.
Please do not send the raw xbench output - just fill in the blank form!
I will collate and post the results as they become available.  XBench is
available by ftp from hundreds of archive sites around the world.
Check out archie for your nearest site.

  >>>>>>  IT IS IMPORTANT TO USE THE CORRECT VERSION OF XBENCH.  <<<<<<

The correct version is the one with the "GraphicsExposures" patch.
Check for this by looking at your source code - you should find calls to

    XSetGraphicsExposures(......, False);

in the four files bitmapcpy.c complex1.c screencpy.c and scroll.c

Some sites known to carry the patched version of xbench are:

    ftp.physics.su.oz.au:/xbench/xbench.tar.gz
    ftp.iastate.edu:/pub/netbsd/misc/xbench.tar.gz
    mcsun.eu.net:/os/linux/BETA/X_S3/xbench.tar.gz
    mcsun.eu.net:/os/linux/BETA/X_S3/xbench.tar.Z
    ftp.th-darmstadt.de:/pub/X11/other/xbench.tar.Z 

    xbench.tar.gz file length=88785, /bin/sum=48788, /usr/5bin/sum=31503
    xbench.tar.Z  file length=156750, /bin/sum=21120, /usr/5bin/sum=40999

To run the benchmark,
    1. If possible, switch into one of the more common display resolutions
         before starting, e.g. 800x600, 1024x768, 1280x1024 etc.
    2. Kill off (i.e. exit from) all other programs on your machine,
         including your window manager!  The only running program you
         should need is a single window from which to start xbench.
         XBench is a benchmark program.  If it has to compete for
         memory or CPU, its results will suffer.
    3. Read the XBench README file and edit the script.run file.
    4. xset s off                                   (turn off the screen saver)
    5. xbench < script.run > results/YOURFILE
    6. go have a coffee
    7. awk -f scripts/xstones.awk < results/YOURFILE

Subject: Market survey: high-performance networking
Date: Wed, 21 Sep 1994 14:57:41 -0800

Someone asked recently about ATM adapters for Linux. I am involved with a
little startup company that is developing a new low-cost (<$1000)
high-performance (>200 Mb/s) LAN.  We are using Linux to do the system
development, and I'd like to find out if there is a market for such a
beast in the Linux community.  Does anyone have any interest in a
high-speed
LAN with a Linux device driver?

If you did this then I would just make a minor modification to the GPL,
and call it say the "APL" and put you software under that.

You don't include a mail address so I can answer privately...
Your questions are basically Unix, not Linux.

1. The reserved 5% of disc space gives you a very small amount of elbow
room to get in and clean up things when your file system fills up for 
whatever reason.  If the reason is some program merrily and unexpectedly
writing a huge file of trash you will be grateful for the system stopping
it before you don't even have enough space to look for it.  As someone 
who has cleaned out file systems at 103% capacity, leave it on _all_ 
partitions.  Trust me on this one!

2. There is a file system repair program called fsck that sometimes 
encounters a file that it can't figure out where belongs.  Lost+found
is a container that exists on all partitionss to dump them in.  It should
normally be empty, but I have had repair files land there that were perfectly
human recognisable and useable.  Yet another Unix perk.  Fsck is what 
you use to fix things after a hard disc crash or someone pulled the power
on a live file system, a truely amazing feature.

3. Don't know but would assume someone has kindly arranged for future 
features.  I don't know the program but would look for a README file
that came with it or for comments in the source since you say it isn't
in the FAQ.

Yeah, but I have a sparcstation, so I want a SOURCE distribution of such
:->

but I am told that the authors are actually getting around to doing this
themselves, so perhaps there's hope.

Hello!

I just was offered MediaVision's Memphis sound card/SCSI adapter combo 
for an excelent price.  Could someone let me know if this card is 
supported in the Linux kernel (1.0.9) and Slackware (2.0))

Thanks!

I don't think it is this simple at all. There are alot of compromises
NeXT could have made to make their system more "standard". They "could" have
used C++, they "could" have used X, they could have used more standard
hardware. But then they would not be NeXT. Go run Solaris with a C++ 
development environment and X. Granted, NeXT needs to have open solutions
to make it. However, there are ALOT of reasons that NeXT didn't use X
which to them were more important than the reasons TO use X.

Obviously, they have changed positions to try to make a bigger mark.
OpenStep is going to be available on Solaris (on X) and the next
version of NEXTSTEP is going to be OpenStep too. Therefore, you'll be
able to do your NEXTSTEP stuff on a X machine. 

GNUSTEP (from what I understand) is just a project to get a GNU OpenStep
compliant environment written. It will not be severly dependent on a given
operating system, although it may require a certain lowest common denomenator.

Also, someone mentioned something about "OpenStep" on "Windows 2000".
There was actually some talk of plans for an "OpenStep" for Windows 95.
Who knows if anything will actually come of it.

I think you've got one the same SB16/MCD that I have.  Does it seem
to have a serious lack of jumpers?  If so then you've got the newer
version.  I called tech support on this and the deal is that the
address of the CD will be 0x10 greater than the address of the SB.
You have no choice in the matter.

At the LILO prompt, try 'mcd=0xAAA,III' where 'AAA' is your CD's address
and 'III' is it's IRQ.  Once you get it all up and going, recompile
the kernel to get rid of the Sony driver (unless you really do have
a Sony CD:)

[soapbox on]

Evidently this is some great new "feature" that some standards group
is trying to enforce.  Personally, I'd rather that the cards allow
you to choose ANY address (in the HW range of course) and ANY IRQ
and ANY DMA.  That way, you have to work really hard to get a conflict.
With all the stuff I've got in my box, there is exactly ONE way to
configure it.  If I had more flexibility on a couple of cards then
I might have more choices.  As it stands, I can't add anything else
because of conflicts.

[soapbox off]
