I posted the same question a few weeks ago.  Responses condensed themselves
into two possibilities:

1.  The editor in the Andrew package (aka AUIS)
    ftp:  sunsite.unc.edu::/pub/Linux/X11/andrew/
          word processor only is auis63L1-wp.tgz

2.  SCO version of Word Perfect iBCS2 support added to the linux kernel.
    ftp:  tsx-11.mit.edu::/pub/linux/ALPHA/ibcs2

I have three up and running in Linux systems.  Seem to work fine.  Mine have 
the co-processor built in.  THey run 1.5 x a 386-40.  I bought them from a 
company called LPC Technolgy and I think the price now is about $155.  I have

Ah-ha, you are try to use SCO . . . .

The last person which I helped who tried to use SCO said that the SCO
tty drivers were so slow that he needed to put delays "\d\d" before
the reply strings. Apparently, SCO flushes the typeahead buffer during
its logon sequence while most systems do not.

You may wish to try the delays. If that doesn't work, then send me
mail and I'll see about digging up the actual details. It was fairly
ugly as I recall. However, it did work.

Please make sure that you have the proper version of PPP. You must
have 2.1.2a.tar.gz. The 2.1.2.tar.gz file will not work. You will only
get these errors. (2.1.2a.tar.gz is on both sunsite.unc.edu and on
ftp.funet.fi)

In addition, make sure that you are using the proper drivers in the
kernel.  The original Slackware 2.0 code used an old version of the
kernel driver.  This was the package which was put on the Infomagic
CDROM set.

The kernel driver has been corrected in the slackware package. If you
get the package after July 10, 1994, it should have the proper
kernels.tgz file.  If you have an earlier verison, then get the
updated file.

The 'bad' kernel driver reports a version 0.1.2 when Linux boots. The
'good' one reports 0.2.7.

Please make sure that you are using the same ppp.h include file for
both the deamon (pppd) and the driver (ppp.c).

Subject: DOS 6.0 Interlnk->Linux???
Date: 1 Oct 1994 04:17:03 GMT

i like linux so much it took over my computer, and now i don't even
have a dos partition....

but i am an atari jaguar developer, and i need to have dos, solution,
buy another computer, so i did, its a notebook (compaq contura aero)

i am trying to avoid paying $150+ for a PCMCIA ethernet card, (and the
ensuing dos networking software) so i would like to inquire on the
feasability of making dos's parallel port "network mounted drive" program
"interlnk.exe" work under linux (ie have a linux version of "intersvr.exe")

i have experience with mucking about in the linux kernel, and plenty of
C programming experience, and given the availability of parallel port source
(ie plip) it seems feasible...

bottom line, anyone know how to go about getting the protocol for interlnk??
if i just wanted to ftp, etc i'd use the crywnr patches to plip to be compat
with dos plip.com, but then i need some pc-nfs client, or samba and windows
for workgroups, all of which are $$$ and take up loads of low dos memory...

any ideas???

I use Slackware 2.0. All window-managers work out of the box. tvtwm is not
included in Slackware, I compiled it.

I think, that the cache algorhithms of the Linux-kernel are the best I've ever
seen. The code is better even than the cache system of Solaris 2.3 (Sparc)
(perhaps, Sun's cache is configureable....). I use the cache, and perhaps it was
written by people who use it. I use applications that read and write hundreds of
kilobytes from the cache buffer instead of the harddisk. For example the
size of gcc + cpp + make + sh +... is much larger than 1MB. If you compile
large programs, you have to write lots of temporary files and to link libraries.
You can mount a ext2 filesystem syncronously, that means, there's no write behind
cache (is the any cache than?). Do this if you want to slow down your box.
I use OS/2. IBM installs the cache with a minimum, fixed size. If I use IBM's
defaults I have to wait ****5 times***** longer for a compilation of unzip
tahn under Linux. If I set the cache to 1.5 MB, I have to wait two times longer.
OS/2's cache is not well designed at all.

I think, that Linus and all the other people ( *you* said: "Since you're such an
expert...") do extremely good work. If you can't share my opinion,
*you* should rewrite the kernel code......

The no CR problem (sometimes called the stairstep effect) results from 
the difference between DOS and UNIX text files. DOS terminates each line 
with a CR/LF combination; UNIX only uses a LF. The Laserjet is expecting 
a DOS type file and to prevent double spacing, does not perform a CR 
unless explicitly told to. This means each line starts in the vertical 
column right after where the last line stopped, creating a staricase 
effect.

To fix it permanently, you need to use an input filter that adds the CR 
to the printfile as it is processed. I'd suggest you look at the 
Printing HOWTO, it explains this better and gives examples.

I've talked with Wolfram Research over a period of several months

Are you proposing some kind of hypertext help file to Linux? That would
be an excellent idea, even if you implement it under Dos, the user could
be more prepared for that "first time" boot.

Also, with hypertext you could have links to the other HOWTO's, which

I had already read the PCI-HOWTO before posting, I found the howto to be very 
informative about PCI in general, but when it got to the information on 
specific PCI motherboards and graphics card it did not flow very well, and I 
had the impression that most of the users were using Pentium PCI systems. 
Also, I am looking for a 486 PCI with good performance, I have read messages

of PCI motherboards.
