Subject: Fortran multiple precision package and translator
Date: 6 Nov 92 01:12:07 GMT
Organization: NAS, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA

Some of you may be aware of a multiprecision computation package and a
multiprecision Fortran translator that I have developed during the
past year or two.  I am now pleased to announce that this software has
been approved by NASA Ames for unlimited international distribution,
at no cost.  A brief description of this software is as follows:

The first package contains approximately 85 Fortran subroutines that
perform a variety of arithmetic operations and transcendental
functions.  The basic arithmetic routines are very efficient, and for
extra high levels of precision (about about 1000 digits), some
additional routines are available that employ advanced algorithms,
such FFT-based multiplication and the Borwein transcendental
algorithms, for additional speedup.  On some problems these routines
are over 200 times faster than certain other multiprecision tools.

However, as with other such packages, manually converting a program to
use these routines is a tedious and error-prone process.  To
facilitate such conversions, I have now developed a multiprecision
translator for Fortran programs.  By means of source directives
(special comments) placed in a standard Fortran-77 program, the user
declares the precision level and specifies which variables in each
subprogram are to be treated as multiprecision.  The translator
program reads this source program and outputs a program with the
appropriate multiprecision subroutine calls, which can then be linked
with the multiprecision package and executed.

This translator program supports multiprecision integer, real and
complex datatypes.  The required array space for multiprecision data
types is automatically allocated.  In the evaluation of computational
expressions, all of the usual conventions for operator precedence and
mixed mode operations are upheld.  Furthermore, most of the Fortran-77
intrinsics, such as ABS, MOD, NINT, COS, EXP are supported and produce
true multiprecision values.

Both the multiprecision package and translator are written in highly
portable Fortran-77 and have been successfully implemented on a
variety of systems, ranging from parallel supercomputers to
workstations.

If anyone is interested in obtaining this software, plus the
accompanying documentation, send me a note, and I will respond by
e-mail.  I eventually intend to place this software on public media
such as netlib, but for the time being I am handling it myself, so
that any bug fixes or enhancements can be promptly distributed.  Since
it is a small but significant amount of trouble for me to respond,
please don't request unless you are somewhat serious about needing
this software.

I'm sorry, but I do not have ftp capabilities. We only have a
uucp link for news and mail here. I think the server is a little
too large to mail (we have to pay for outgoing mail :-(). So
perhaps someone else could compile the server? You will need a
lot of disk space, though. The simplest way is to extract the
complete XFree86-2.1 tree, patch it to 2.1.1, apply my patch and
then compile the S3 server only.

To compile the S3 server only, without compiling the complete XFree86
tree, you have to make some adjustments in the file mit/config/site.def:
1) uncomment a #define which is called something like
   #define BuildServersOnly YES
2) change all #defines controlling the compilation of the various
   servers to NO, except for the S3 server.

After these modifications, you can use the command (/bin/bash):
   make World > world.log 2>&1 &
in the 'mit' directory to build the server 'mit/server/XF86_S3'.
On my Linux system (486DX2-66/16Mb this takes about 70 minutes.
You will need about 120 Mb of disk space for the XFree86-2.1
source code and generated objects.

I use the same combination, but I think you are mixing the IO adresses
of the sound card and the CD interface. My sound card is configured for
0x220, DMA 1 + 5 and IRQ 5, and the Mitsumi interface is configured for
address 0x340, DMA 7 and IRQ 11 (all default values).

After changing the values in mcd.h and recompiling the kernel (1.1.51) I
can use the CD-ROM with no problems at all.

Quite.  On a 8MB machine, Linux and X are quite a bit more snappy than
OS/2 and PM.  One of the major reasons seems to be the much better handling
of swapping in Linux - even the pacthes for OS/2 2.11 do not improve things 
much.  Also PM is very slow.  Shame, but true.

Not true. xspread, oleo, and sc may not be as sophisticated as Excel,

Run NFS on either type of server and you're there.

That's IBM's fault, not Linux's.

Yeah, but Linux is geared more towards TCP/IP networks... you know, 
the one network protocol suite that is supported by more than 1000
hardware vendors, and more software companies than you can shake a 
stick at.

>6. Nationalized version of the few programs existing are not available.

But it's getting better. Unix is more nationalized than a lot of 
operating environments.

>7. Nationalized versions of Linux is not available.

Are you kidding? With the biggest bunch of Linux supporters in Finland
and Germany?

I'm enjoying my S3 quite nicely, thanks. Again, vendor support is an
issue because they want to sell or license their technology instead of
telling people what you need to use it.

It's a viscious circle. People aren't gonna buy what they don't have
software for, and you can't afford to make the software for it if
people aren't buying the hardware.

>9. Printed manuals and easy 'Get started' manuals does not exist.

Definitely not true. Look up the Linux Documentation Project and
the fact that Fintronic ships printed versions of those manuals
when it ships Linux systems.

>10. Support for Mulit-media is shaky.

mpeg_play works nicely on my machine. My SoundBlaster is doing MIDI
mixing. What exactly are you referring to?

>11. Support for ISDN is not generally available.

Order the board from Siemens and ask for the driver. :) Our German
friends are ON THE BALL!

>12. There is no disk-compression.

Also not true. Support for double-space drives is being added to the 
MS-DOS driver set as we speak. As for Unix drives, are you insane?
Do you want performance or do you want more lag added to disk access?

That's plenty fine. The great thing about the Linux crowd is that 
they don't EXPECT you to run it exclusively. I'd prefer to code for
Linux than for any other environment (except my big POSIX machines
at work).

Yeah, but when you try to do TCP/IP on anything other than Linux, 
prepare to rip your hair out. NetWare TCP/IP especially... (you do
NOT want to see my bug list)

Nothing's stopping them. How do these things you mention make Linux
bad?

In a environment like that you have the money to buy a machine with
more I/O bandwidth than a PC to do the job. PC's are laughable when
it comes to serious I/O.

Computing in general? Linux? Linux is a freely-available piece of
software that generally needs work to do exactly what you want and
assumes a high level of technical knowledge on the part of the user.

Tell me who fits the bill for that? Hobbyists. Unix wizards.
Academics. Business people do different things for different reasons.
If you are a business person, buy a MIPS box from Control Data and
crank away!

I would like to be able to run Linux (or possibly some other UNIX) on a

machines, or perhaps one of the smaller & cheaper Thinkpads.  I would be
infinitely grateful to receive e-mail from anyone who has had a definite

Also, how much Linux would I likely be able to fit on a machine with only
6MB RAM and a 40MB HD?  Some basic X11 capability would be nice, but I could
live with just csh, kermit, vi, and a C compiler.

Saw the DTR-1 for the first time this weekend.  They're being blown out for
$699 for a prettty complete package.  Nifty little machine, except for the
40MB drive (1.3", so it can't be swapped out for anything useful).  At the

Anyone got ANY ideas!!!!!!  Should I upgrade the kernel and if so to which  
version??  Please email me as well as posting so I don't miss out.

On a similar vein another machine (IDE, NE200 clone) gave the same
"eth0: transmit timed out, TX status 0xe, ISR 0x0."
"eth0: Possible network cable problem?"
messages last weekend.  The strange thing was it was NOT connected to any  
ethernet at the time.....I had it at home!!!!!!

Thanks in advance

Dermot
