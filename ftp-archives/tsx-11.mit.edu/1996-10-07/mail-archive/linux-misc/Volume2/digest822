Subject: Slackware 2.0 = no more fsck on boot up??
Date: 25 Sep 94 14:09:44


hello there.

I upgraded from Slackware 1.0(.2?) to Slackware 2.0.0 lately.
Shortly after, I upgraded the kernal to 1.1.45.

My problem is:

In the old slackware release, if a file system is found to be
corrupted or max-mount-count-reached, fsck is run'ed on it
automatically at boot up.  But this doesn't seem to be the case
anymore in this release.  What happens now is that the file systems
are mounted anyway, withouth invoking fsck.  I can boot from floppy
and run fsck manually, but it doesn't reset the flag that says
max-mount-count-reached ...  What can I do to make it behave like
it used to, ie. call fsck on boot up when needed ?

        help please?  please cc: me byn email too. thanks.

whay.

I am trying to install the Fall 1994 Yggdrasil CD but failing. I have switched 
hardware (known to work under DOS and Fall 1993 Linux) and tried at least 10 
times but no success.
 
When I boot up from the floppy, I get some messages about TAR: UNABLE TO CREATE 
DIRECTORY /HOME...... :READ-ONLY FILE SYSTEM  and when I go into the INSTALL 
script, I get messages such as /INSTALL/INSTALL permission denied.
 
I do get to fdisk and set up the hard disk after that but, it just crashes 
later (unable to mount root, actually various messages depending upon the 
fullness of the Moon).
 
Does anyone have some hints about why this may be happening????
 
Thanks

  Please do not flame the article: "Special Sale On QNX!".
  
  It is a feeble attempt at forgery, and was not posted
  by a commercial distributor of QNX.
  
  It was posted from an undergrad account at uwaterloo.ca,

No one.  The SGI you are describing is outdated and not sold anymore.
Funny how a top of the line PC is being compared to something that
is too slow to be a workstation anymore.

1. the MIPS R4000 is hardly the fastest processor made by MIPS.  The
   Indego line is several years old whereas Pentium 90 is new.  If you
   want to compare apples to apples, use a new Indy with a MIPS R4600
   processor at 166 Mhz.  It blows the doors off Pentium 90.  Would you
   like to send your code to me so I can run it on a new SGI machine?


2. SGI Indy does not cost ~3 times more than a top of the line DELL.
   Let's look at the numbers, shall we:

        Dell XPS 90, 16Meg ram, 17" monitor, #9 graphics card,
        CD Rom Drive, 1G IDE disk, ethernet card, 3 year warranty.
        Price: ~$4400

        SGI Indy, 16 Meg Ram, 17" monitor, accelerated graphics
        1G FAST SCSI Drive, ethernet, CCD camera, 3 year warranty.
        Price: ~$6500

   You should note the the Indy has a MIPS R4600 processor, which is
   much faster than Pentium.  Also, the SCSI Drive is faster and more
   expandable than the Dell IDE.  Overall, the Indy will have much
   higher throughput and lower price/performance.

I believe that's exactly what the load balancing stuff does in fact.
However, it would most likely only for data sent by Linux.  In order for
downloaded data to use both modems optimally, the machine on the other
side would have to do load balancing, and most OSes don't.

Also, if you don't have control of the routing tables on the other side,
each SLIP connection would give you a separate IP address, which would
further complicate matters.

If you own both boxes, it should work.

Both of my VL motherboards support 32-bit DMA access (the docs for one 
specifically states it), so I assumed that it is part of the standard (they 
are from different manufacturers). OS/2 is considerably slower on my 32 MB 
SCSI machine (which has an AHA1542C) than on my 32 MB IDE machine (which has a 
non-enhanced VL IDE controller), even though the former has 128 KB more cache.

Sounds like Linux handles non-DMAable memory the same way as OS/2.

The easiest way to defeat inactivity timers is to keep a "tmon" or

automatically run one of these and you can stay online indefinitely
(they do the equivalent of a "ping" to the remote side peridoically

From: sean@tcel.com (Sean Watkins)
Date: Sun, 25 Sep 1994 16:58:13 GMT


Hi,

After labouring several hours to get AMD working, I have come to the
ultimate conclusion that AMD coupled with NIS under Linux is broken.
Following example summarizes:

Let the auto.home map be equal to:

gopher type:=link;fs:=/home/other/gopher
www type:=link;fs:=/home/other/www
other host!=dns;type:=nfs;rhost:=dns;rfs:=/scsi/other           host==dns;type:=link;fs:=/scsi/other
ftp type:=link;fs:=/home/other/ftp
staff host!=server02;type:=nfs;rhost:=server02;rfs:=/staff      host==server02;type:=link;fs:=/staff
cust host!=dns;type:=nfs;rhost:=dns;rfs:=/scsi/cust             host==dns;type:=link;fs:=/scsi/cust


NIS Querys of this map anywhere succeed --

pc06 ~ % ypcat -k auto.home
gopher type:=link;fs:=/home/other/gopher
www type:=link;fs:=/home/other/www
other host!=dns;type:=nfs;rhost:=dns;rfs:=/scsi/other           host==dns;type:=link;fs:=/scsi/other
ftp type:=link;fs:=/home/other/ftp
staff host!=server02;type:=nfs;rhost:=server02;rfs:=/staff      host==server02;type:=link;fs:=/staff
cust host!=dns;type:=nfs;rhost:=dns;rfs:=/scsi/cust             host==dns;type:=link;fs:=/scsi/cust

/home /etc/auto.home it is successfull...

Date: 23 Sep 1994 18:27:31 GMT

I am running the 1.1.49 kernel of Linux.  I got 2.1.2a of ppp from the
net and built and installed.

Now the questions:
    There are files that are referenced in /etc/ppp, but I can't find 
        examples of the files...
    There are many readme and SETUP, Notes, etc files, but they all seem
        to talk about what is needed to setup/install ppp and what needs to
        be done withour reference to the others.... I am confused,,,

(My Linux box will use a modem to call a Sun [SunOS 1.4.*].  The Sun will
have separate entries in the /etc/passwd for different ppp dialups.  Then
when the system connects, a person can run csh (or your favorite) or exec
a script for the person dialing up to run ppp.  The Sun is connected to
a network that that is 'hooked' to Internet.  The goal is is to have my
Linux box 'on the net' using ppp.... easy huh?

Any help on getting PPP running is appreciated.

My personal feeling is that a biz.linux.* sub-hierarchy might be

Just how many disjointed linux newsgroups are needed?  Certainly,
I can see potential justification for biz.linux.*, but that would
necessarily be at the expense of the majority of the foregoing.

What are the proposer's intentions?

Last time I checked the Hardware HOWTO, it only listed the Linux
supported CD ROM drives without any PROs and CONs for each.  Besides,
the original question was much broader here: it asked for those that
have good support also in DOS and OS/2, not to mention the SoundBlaster
addition.

So, Steve, perhaps you should have read those posts more attentively
before grabbing the keyboard.
