I don't want to rain on the parade, but I hope we do *not* start considering
ourselves a GNU system.  We use the GNU software, it's wonderful stuff, I
like it, but we also use whatever fits in with the Linux philosophy, which
is much more unconstrained and much less ideological than the GNU
philosophy, IMO.  There are licensing problems in the standard GNU approach,
again IMO, involving the linkage of libraries into applications.  I'm not
saying the GNU approach is wrong, just that it's not as open as it might be.

I'm glad to see that the Debian release is moving along--but not because I
think Linux development should be subsumed into it.  On the contrary, I
think the strength of development for Linux is that there are a number of
competing, independent threads which serve to strengthen the whole tapestry. 
I would hate to see that change, as it would inevitably do if we became part
of a less-flexible structure.

I very much appreciate the amount of work that has gone into GNU software,
and the quality of that software.  I use it all the time!  But I don't think
that recognition by FSF is the primary measure of the success of Linux. 
They are different things entirely.

Mainstreaming support for Linux in GCC is another issue entirely, BTW....if
Linux is used extensively in the community, it probably makes sense for both
Linux people and GNU people for both groups to work closely together....

Anyway, if my message isn't reasonably diplomatic, I better apologize in

This is for a DESPERATE friend! Please enlighten her....

Subject: HELP!! "Read-only file system" message from Linux Installation
I had posted this question before, but got no response.  I hope someone
will respond because I  am stuck on my installation.  I have already
read all the latest linux FAQ files, but that problem was not addressed.

I am trying to install slackware(v1.1.1) from cdrom.
I partitioned my hard drive with the following configuration:
/dev/hda1  205096(blocks)  dos
/dev/hda2  82152            linux native
/dev/hda3  10584            linux swap

I ran setup and followed the prompts, but the installation failed with the 
following messages:

"Done formatting device /dev/hda2...
 Root partition mounted.
/bin setup: cannot create /mnt/fstab: read-only file system".
Question:
How do I go about making my / filesystem read-write?

I am running a 486D66 with 420M hard drive and Creative Soundblaster Card

If there are licensing problems in the GNU approach, then Linux suffers
from them.  The kernel is under the GPL, the C library is under the LGPL,
certain key files always linked in, like libgcc.a and crt0.S have special
exceptions to avoid bringing whole applications under the GPL.  These
statements are true of both Linux and the future Hurd.  There is no
difference, Linux is using every single GNU licensing convention exactly
as the FSF intended.

The only difference I can see is attitude: the FSF people talk about
software hoarders, grumble a lot but then adjust their licenses where
needed (example: the stream classes in libg++ moved from the LGPL to the
"as a special exception" no-restrictions license), and the Linux people
are more relaxed about the whole thing.  But legally, it's *exactly* the
same: if you have problems with the GNU licensing approach you'll need
to abandon Linux and join up with the BSD folks.

Try UniBoard.  It isn't free, but it is cheap.  He does have support for FIDO
(in Beta).  You can get it from ftp.wariat.org:/pub/uniboard.

BTW, source ISN'T available.  But it does work well and is very configurable :-)

Well, I didn't realise the SCSI vs. IDE tradeoff. There is not much of a
difference, if you keep the builtin 520MB disk, as it is slower than the
average IDE interface. But I admit the lack of upgrading to better backup
devices and real fast disks.

  On the other hand SCSI isn't always fast: my 1542 performs maximum 2MB
per second linear read/write with both disks.

  However, a Pentium board without builtin SCSI support is pretty seldom,
though.

Required?  What kind of repressive regime requires using DOS
apps (that have been shown to cause insanity in lab inhabitants)?

If they supply the computers, that is one thing; but if a valid
alternative is found that should be allowed.

The first thing to learn - write it down if you must - is that
the meaning of productivity depends upon the person speaking.
If you define productivity as being able to run certain DOS apps,
you might also go and stat an even noisier flame war by claiming
that Macs are unproductive.

If the productivity in question is learning about computers
and computer science, then your friends approach is much better
than sticking to OS/2 and not asking needless questions.

> >What I want to know is:
> >1) Why do CS majors here use Unix?  What is it that is so great about Unix

Because it's common and programmer friendly.  Of course, many
places just have them as their main machines that anyone can use;
but don't get upset if you do your assignments in DOS or something
else (for programming, the TA should be able to get the source code
and recompile it though).  They can write their reports in whatever
system they want.  UNIX machines are available all over and in
many varieties, and in modern times, is very affordable for the
student.

UNIX is what the real world in CS uses.  CS people are NOT USERS!
Being able to run DOS apps is almost useless (most that I know that
care about apps would prefer macs anyway).  UNIX machines are
multi-user, very network friendly (can you use the school's OS/2
machines from home, or across the country?).  UNIX machines are up to
state of the art in hardware and software (unless you consider
software state of the art to mean flashy UI only).  UNIX can support
BIG systems - super computers run UNIX (what will you do when you need
real horsepower for your engineering work and the P90 won't cut it?).
It's not that CS people are in ivory towers, but they are actually
building (or learning about) the systems that everyone else uses.
Would you complain "what is so great about calculus for engineers?"

MSDOS and Macs is completely out as far as educational CS goes.
You just can't teach OS principles on machines with outdated
OS's.  Some places use VMS, others have doddering TOPS machines.
Some try to teach under msdos, but probably aren't very effective.

OS/2 is probably ok as an example of how to mess up a good idea.
Start chopping down until you have 8, 4, or 2 megs and you'll
start getting a better idea.  Heck, I used to run with a productive
Amiga system - multitasking - with only 1 meg (started with 512K
but that limited graphics and buffer space).  OS/2 is treated as
a big joke by many who have to program in it.

> >2) Isn't the lack of "killer" apps a good reason not to use Unix?

This just shows an incredible bias.  Personally, I've seen very
little under DOS (except games) that I cared to run.

"Killer" apps means different things depending upon what you want
to do.  If you like ray tracing, then SGI (unix) has the best
killer apps.  If you're a desktop publishing person, Apple probably
has the best.  If you do desktop video, then it's Amiga.  If youbest.  If you do desktop video, then it's Amiga.  If you want
CAD, it is probably msdos (I think).

If you have a particular app that you need, and that drives your
choice of computer - great!  But don't complain because other
people don't have the same needs you do.

> >My reasoning is that he should just stick to learning about computers in a

Why?  You went to school to get an education, so don't get flustered
if someone wants to get one instead of just sliding through.  Will
your resume read "did only the minimum necessary work for my degree"?
Sheesh, if your friend takes up bagpipes, will you complain to him
that this has nothing to do with his major, and that guitar is a
better choice anyway?

People who learn things the conventional (easy) way are the most
annoying ones to CS people, since they end up with only a superficial
knowledge without knowing this (or not caring).  Besides, the current
conventional ways to learn computers are designed for USERS or the
mass market, and if you want to go beyond that, conventional ways
fail.  Heck, there aren't any decent programming magazines anymore,
so that route is out (note that I said "decent").  As far as books,
stores are full of "Blah for Dummies" and such.

> >I know for a fact that you can't learn Unix (I mean learn it really well)just
> >by fooling around with it.  So what's the point?

You can't learn ANYTHING well without fooling around with it!!
You get only superficial knowledge.  With computers, the most
common symptom is the tendency to shove everything into the
templates already learned - and the first time something doesn't
fit into expectations (such as a new error message) that person
doesn't know how to procede.

Learning things only from a book is pitiful. (maybe you should watch
some Fawlty Towers in this regard) Why do you think lab classes are
usually required?

I am really glad you are in engineering and not in education.
