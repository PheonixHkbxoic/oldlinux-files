Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted biweekly to
comp.os.linux.announce.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not a contribution to the development
of Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration
- should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

Linux has 'clone'. I'd rephrase it as Linux has multi-threading support that
sort of looks neat but nobody is using it 8)

Subject: Problems with ATI GU+ and Linux
Date: 9 Oct 1994 20:27:08 GMT

  So far I've had two problems with a recently aquired ATI GU+ VLB card and
Linux (and I haven't even gotten to X yet).  First of all, the card doesn't
seem to want to support the 100X40 and the 100X32 (or whatever it is) text
modes.  When I use vga=ask in the lilo config file, I'm propted with the
possiblites of these modes at boot time, but when I select them, the kernel
just boots into 80X25 mode.  132X25 and 132X44 work ok.  The other problem
is that when I switch between VCs, sometimes the font will get all screwed
up (parts of letters will be missing, etc).  I can reload the font using
setfont and that will fix it, but after a while when I switch VCs or use
selection or try to scroll back into video memory, it gets messed up
again.  The card has 2 megs of DRAM, and I have tried it at all combinations
of the vga memory size option and the memory apature option.  I've tried
raising my wait-states up to 2, and tried changing the bus speed.  The
problem also occures under DOS.  I've run norton's video memory tests under
ndiags, I've run the tests that come with the ATI utilities, both pass
without any problems.  I have an AMD 486DX450 CPU, VLB motherboard, Biotec
chipset, AMI bios, 16 megs of RAM.  The ATI has a RAMDAC of 68875BFN, 2 megs
of 60ns DRAM, and the Mach 32 chipset.  If anyone has any ideas, please email
me.  Thanks.

  I forgot to mention in my previous post that when the font does get
screwed up, it seems like only uppercase letters and punctuation gets
altered.  Numbers and lowercase and some punctuation remains normal.  Just
thought I'd mention everything I could think of.

This may be ok (I have no reason to doubt it), but for just a little 
more work you can make it a Linux swap partition rather than 
just a swap file.  See the mini how-to for details.

Read the output of tail -f /var/spool/smail/logfile after you
run /usr/lib/smail/tools.linux/mkconfig.  This should lead you
to edit various /var/lib/smail/maps/* files and the 
/var/lib/smail/routers file and the /var/lib/smail/config file.  
In routers you probably will want to use bsearch on all the 
pathfiles you have, that is if you have a site which needs little 
knowledge of the topography of the net.
