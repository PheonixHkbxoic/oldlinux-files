Subject: Re: setting up FTP anonymous
Date: 26 Sep 1994 00:50:20 GMT

Some of these may be variable. I leave it to you to determine 
file and directory permissions. For now, build them as root 
and open the files for universal access. Surprisingly, the 
biggest problem is getting ls to work.

ftp is in your /etc/passwd with a home directory of /ftp,
and NO password (there's a * in the password field)

/ftp directory exists
/ftp/bin directory exists and contains:
    /ftp/bin/ls is a copy (or hard link) of /bin/ls
/ftp/etc exists and contains:
    /ftp/etc/group is a copy of /etc/group
    /ftp/etc/passwd is a copy of /etc/passwd
      - these files are ONLY for ls to determine group and owner
        of listed files and the NET-2 HOW-TO tells you to
        remove the password fields entirely from the shadow
        version of passwd so they aren't accessible.
/ftp/lib exists and contains:
    /ftp/lib/libc.so.4 is copy of /lib/libc.so.4 (the number may vary)
    /ftp/lib/ld.so is a copy of /lib/ld.so (this little fact is
                left out by the NET-2 HOW-TO)

Now, provided your ftp daemon works, anon access should work. All
directories below /ftp will be visible. Typical ftp sites have 
a /ftp/pub directory with subdirectories to taste.

Enjoy.

Subject: Three quick questions
Date: Wed, 28 Sep 1994 05:53:54 GMT

I just set up the SLS Linux system on my machine with very few problems.
However, I have three hopefully easy questions:

1) I can't seem to tell if the printer daemon is running.  It doesn't
seem to be, and using lpq always says no entries, even after I've typed
lpr filename (which provides no response, but doesn't hiccup either).  I
can cat or cp files to /dev/lp1 and they will print.  Any ideas on determining
if the spooler is working and what I'm doing wrong as far as lpr?

2) Every time I boot up, I get a message like "Filesystem not clean, checking
it".  I am shutting down using shutdown -r as opposed to cold or CTRL-ALT-DELETE
rebooting.  Is this normal?  Usually, there are no other messages
after the "Filesystem not clean..." concerning filesystem problems.

3) I have a Diamond Viper PCI card.  Is it worth installing the XWindows
system (i.e., is there a color driver available for the Viper PCI, and if
so, where might I find it)?


Thanks for any help you can provide!

LaTeX does automatic reference citation and links in with
your bibliography database.  Very few other packages do that
(I think scribe does).  This is VITAL for a thesis!

It also automatically keeps numbers straight if you move stuff
around, so that you can refer to a certain section without
knowing what page it is on, and so forth (a few others do this,
but it's still relatively rare).

        I purhcased a $75 Supra 14.4 fax/modem about 2 months ago, 
didn't have a clue about Linux support, but when I tried it, Waa-Laa! 
works great! Luckily it does hardware compression, so that must be why.

This could be good. I think you could start with posting a small list

.BAT is really simple so it shouldn't be difficult to translate.

I use a standalone Linux Slackware 2.0.0.
I have an 'optimised' kernel (no drivers for things I don't have compiled in),
run 4 getty's, use tvtwm (eats a little bit more RAM than fvwm) and rxvt.
When I start X11 on my 8MB system (one rxvt running), I have 4.2 MB free
(free+buffers, swap is 0). A 'default' window-manager is unknown to me. I think
Robert is talking about olvwm. olvmw (and the libraries it has to use) wastes ca.
1.3 MB RAM. Robert you don't know what your talking about. You did not spent any
time in configuring Linux.

I also have one of these controllers, though I only use two drives

you'll need to acquire the patch that allows you to use two IDE
controllers simutaneously.  The promise card, as far as using a 3d and

Have you have any trouble with your controllers, ie: system locking-up
when doing intensive (disk intensive) activities?  Mine does, but ONLY
when I have it set on defered write.  Let me know if you also have
this problem.  I think it might me related to my drive
configuration... That Promise controller doesn't like WD drives in a

I don't see mention of a .0 in the above...
using .0. as address components is no problem at all.  When it would be,
you could not use *any* address because it always includes a '0' bit
somewhere which would conflict with variable-length subnet masks.

(some programs may 'think' they can derive the subnet mask by looking at
the number of zero bits, but these are broken.  they assume 8-bit subnet
boundaries, which are a thing of the past)

Unfortunately the authors of RFC 1627 completely mis-represented the
intentions of the authors of RFC 1597, e.g. by downplaying the examples
given in a completely ridiculous way.
But worst of all, they don't come up with an alternative.  It is easy to
say "your solution sucks", but when you can't provide a better solution
which is practical to implement, that does add little to the discussion.

Example: At work we need to provide an IP network that can be managably
subnetted to all branches of a bank in Holland.  There are some 1600
branches, each of them may have one or more segments, and hundreds of
systems can be at each branch.  We don't need and *DON'T WANT*
connectivity to the Internet for all systems.  We need a class-A network
to be able to subnet it in a managable way, and have a simple hierarchical
routing over the X.25 network that interconnects the branches.
We use network 10.  There is no way NIC would provide us with a class-A
net for this purpose, so what else could we do??

There are good reasons both ways. Firstly a good ISDN bridge/router has
advanced compression and a high powered CPU can do multiple channel
aggregation, spanning tree and the compression with no impact on your host,
and it works for a whole network.

The PC card side is good because its cheap. The big problem with ISDN
currently is that the PC ISDN stuff I have access to is UK approved, not US
approved, DE approved or whatever thanks to the usual stupid telephone
monopolies the world is blessed (haha) with.

I could almost certainly do the driver for the sonix board in the UK
including all its built in dial on demand support if there was enough UK
interest in it (eg someone wanting to buy 20+) but all the interest in ISDN
is currently Germany and a little bit of USA.
