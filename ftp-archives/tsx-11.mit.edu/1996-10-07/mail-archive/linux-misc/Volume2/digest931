LINUS IS NOT SYSTEM V BASED. It was developed from scratch using Minix to
bootstrap the process somewhat, but it's not really Minix-based either.

Linux just has a system-V-ish feel, which isn't a bad thing.

This depends on the distribution. You can equally use the BSD style init

Subject: PAS16 PROBLEM
Date: 13 Oct 1994 14:05:13 GMT

 I just installed Linux off a CD_ROM.. Here's my problem...

486-dx2-66.. 16 mbs of nonparity ram. plenty of IDE HD.
1 PAS16 Revision -05-D. with SCSI CD-ROM (device 0).
Slackware 2.0.1 and kernel 1.1.50 linux.

here's my problem.. on bootup, the system recognizes 
the presence of the PAS16 SCSI interface... at 
address 0x388 and IRQ15( it may be useful to inform
anybody reading this that the PAS16 I have DOESNT
have any jumpers for IRQ/DMA settings) but instead
of continuing on, th efollowing messages come up:

scsi5: interrupts not enabled. for better interactive 
performance, please jumper the board for a free IRQ.

Stale command on 1:1 appears to have died when bus
was reset.

scsi0: aborting command.
destination target 1, lnn 1

command : Request Sense 20 00 01 10 00..


Also under dos using the MVSOUND.SYS driver
the CD-ROM / PAS16 do work with Windows 3.11
and DOS. 

Also when I tried out WinNT, it couldn't 
recognize my CD-ROM either (but it didn't
even find the SCSI interface).

So, can anyone offer a solution to this problem
or do I go and get another sound card/ CDROM

Thanks in advance.

I have to mention another... calc.  Calc, which is available on GNU
mirrors, is an emacs calculator with an attitude.  It will do lots of
stuff, including solving eqations for a given variable.

The big win is that calc has an "embedded" mode where you play with
the equation in your document.  It can also format the output for
LaTeX.  Makes doing math manipulation much easier.

The problem is not with telneting or ftping out from the machine  but with
incoming connections. Not all daemons suffer from it. On my machine it has
been telnet mostly, ftp rarely, sendmail 8.6.9 rarely, routed rarely. INN
never has a problem even though it gets about 60M of news a day.

I was told by someone who had not tried *BSD
that Linux can behave like Sun OS which was based on BSD.
Similarly with Ultrix. I believe it is a matter of degree of similarity.

From a previous post, I was given the impression that we need to set BSD
in order to compile easily for Linux.

Is it possible that the presence of FFS and vfork is contributing to the
similarity of FreeBSD 1.1.5.1 with Ultrix?

Hi, I've been using version 2.4 of Mosiac (the term verion) thru my modem.
Everything works fine, the viewers, e.q, xv, ghostview, mpeg_play are
spawned OK but do not go into the background. Mosaic waits (with its watch
cursor) until the viewer finishes.

My term Mosiac binary is dated Aug 23. I had a v1.3 Mosaic that did properly
put everything in the background. I have checked the Mosaic documentation and
FAQ and didn't find anything. I have tried a line like "image/gif; xv %s &"
in a ~/.mailcap file but then it didn't even spawn the viewer.

Any help would be appreciated. I just increased my swap by 24MB and I can now
leave alot of viewers running ;-)

Multi-threaded: In addition to processes, which can be thought of as 
running programs, there are LWP (light weight processes) aka threads, 
that are usually part of one heavy-weight, or regular, process. Example: 
a process, say a word processor, can have several threads: one main 
editing thread, one printing thread, one spell checking thread. The 
advantage of threads is that you don't have to have the OS switch between 
processes, but instead the process switches between its threads by 
itself. Also, different threads can usually share memory. A context 
switch between two threads usually less time costly than between two 
processes.

Multi-threading and multi-user is _not_ mutually exclusive.

The term multi-threaded is also often misused.  Then there is the
confusion about user level threading and kernel level threading.
Packages like LWP and language features only give the impression of
threading.  The will still boil down to normal unix-like scheduling.
If a process has threads using LWP, then the threads will get
scheduled when the controlling process does.  In a true threaded
system, each thread will act independant of each other and all other
threads.  Another feature of threads is "low overhead": sharing text
space, etc.  But this is becoming downplayed with some of the new
fork(2) system calls that do the same thing.  I think the original
poster wanted to know if the linux kernel was multi-threaded (no).
The easiest way to describe this is that the kernel itself can
multi-task (system threads).  I'll have to try to find my copy of my
LynxOS programmers guide to help clarify this.

What I am saying is the AMD 486 DX2-66 could *safely* be overclocked to 80 Mhz
I *don't* know if the Intel DX-33 can be *safely* overclocked.  Besides, there
is a difference between 33->40 and 33->50 Mhz overclocking.  One is almost
guaranteed to be safer than the other; it runs the chip less out of spec than
the other. :)

Not necessecarily.  Try putting the system unit sans case in a freezer.  I
read someone's post in another sub-tree of this thread and he said he used to
do that with minis. :)

Cool.  I'll try that with my AMD 386DX-40. :-)

Hi, I was wondering if someone could tell me where I can get Linux doom?


Also, is there any easy way to configure PPP like there is for slip? Dial 
up program, default scripts, etc... Any help woild be great!

It seems that SWT is not the only business with which you have disagreements.

Apparently, you are suggesting that Marvin Wu switch to an account or a bank
that offers overdraft protection.

This disturbs me.  It is one thing to use the net to warn people and tell
them about a bad experience that you had.  It is quite another thing to use
the net to extort money from people even if it is just $4.  If you think
that you have a legitimate claim against SWT, you should take Mr. Wu to
small claims court.  Just contact the County Court Clerk in Richardson,
Texas.  If you get a judgement against Marvin Wu, you can recover all of
your expenses as well as the $4.  My personal opinion is that you don't
have a prayer unless Marvin fails to show up in court.  The simple fact
is that Marvin never agreed to pay for any of your banking fees and that
you did agree to pay for all shipping charges.  He doesn't owe you anything.

You needn't reply but I'm sure you can't resist having the last word.

Install it like a normal SCSI device and it is ready to go.  Get the
SCSI-Howto and you should be set.  I am using a 3270 as /dev/sda
and it works great.  Once it is installed, insert a cart, spin up,
fdisk it, mkfs it and then mount it!

I have Linux running on a system using the Plato Premier PCI II.  Everything
works great.  I am using an old Adaptec 1542C, so if you decide to go with
the NCR SCSI board, you may have some tricky things to do to get it to work.

The UNIX kernel has no clue about "threads".  All it sees are
processes.  The UNIX kernel cannot schedule a thread becuase it
it doesn't know what one is*.  Therefore in a non-threading kernel,
the only way to schedule a thread is to schedule the whole process.

It's not just an "implementation detail".  The underlying UNIX kernel
has to be radically altered in order to do thread scheduling.

It's true that the terminology is muddied often, but that's not
an excuse to use the wrong terminology.  A thread is not really
a true thread of execution if its execution depends on another
task (a process) getting scheduled.  It's like the difference
between pre-emptive and co-operative multitasking.  Sure,
MS-Windows does do multiple tasks mostly simulataneously, but
it's not the same as true multitasking.

* of course exepting the more modern UNIXes that do threading.
