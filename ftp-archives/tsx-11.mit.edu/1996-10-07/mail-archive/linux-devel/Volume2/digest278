I wouldn't call InterViews 3.1 glyphs "hacks".  They give you a choice of
OpenLook, Motif, or "SGIMotif" appearance with a runtime flag.  It's not as
full-featured as it could be, but it's certainly sufficient for normal menu/
button stuff, and good looking too.  Plus you get the source so you can do

Needless to say the work-around of changing the drive geometry parameters is 
sub-optimal and I was hoping to hear that a fix is just around the corner.

If anyone has heard of anything, I will bw happy to summarize the responses

Yup.  I should have thought to mention this--it _has_ come up

Of course, there's nothing the kernel can do to help your latency

I don't think you're thinking far enough ahead.  The purpose of
synchronous metadata updates is not to save the file you're writing
at the time of the crash (or whatever), but rather to ensure that
the file system itself doesn't creepingly get into an inconsistent
state behind your back.

I'd rather have garbage in a file than have a file whose blocks
are also in the free list and will soon be allocated to another
file as well.  Of course, fsck is supposed to fix these situations.
But if you're using a filesystem wherein the actual disk updates
are trailing way behind file system activity, and are not constrained
to be written in the order they were made, then a crash at a disk-intensive
time could leave fsck extremely confused.

This is why BSD ffs does its updates in what somebody called the "wrong"
order, but which strikes me as exactly the _right_ order.

First off, I failed to grasp your point.  There are reasons why 2.6.0
hasn't been oficially released by the linux community, namely the fact
that it is buggy and fails to compile some code (like some versions of

The nice "ksh -r" which makes it restricted. I really need that now and have
scoured the bash (and every other free shell) manual, but nobody implements
it.

Korn has a lot of security features which I fell in love with on a corporate
Sparc. $149 is not bad, since I have paid more for commercial apps that have

                Well, there has certainly been a lot of work done to secure
WAN links at varying levels of security, but this work can be
into two categories:  authentication/identification encryption.
Work was done in the first case primarily to protect remote office
routers from being swapped with network sniffers or other such things
that could emulate the router while ripping off their data.  The two
main methods of authentication/identification are PAP and CHAP, the
latter being the best method.  

                In the area of encryption, I dont believe that there is any
standard for doing this on PPP links, but many companies (mine
included) have employed proprietary scrambling mechanisms so that data
going accross WAN links is kept secure even if it suddenly becomes
non-private as a result of someone attaching a sniffer to the line. 

                PPP PAP and CHAP are freely available, and usually come with
most commercial and free implementations of PPP.  However, PPP
scrambling is different issue since it is almost exclusively employed
in a proprietary fasion. As far as I know, PPP scrambling has currently
been implemented only between routers, but I may be wrong.  If your
needs require secure WAN links, perhaps purchasing a low-cost remote
office router which provides dial-on demand connections for
non-permanent connections to The Internet.  However, that solution is
getting a bit pricy, and is probably out of the relm of most home
Internet connections.

For stock VGA/EGA, yes this is correct... 8 bits per character for text
modes and one bit padding which, for a (hardwired I believe) range of
linedrawing characters.

However, there are very few users of "stock" VGA/EGA anymore. I would
dare guess that the majority of linux users have some sort of SVGA card
and many SVGA chipsets support extended text mode functions most of
which I have never seen tapped. Some of the functions that stick out in
my mind are variable sized fonts, multiple fonts, and anti-aliased
fonts.

The problem lies in the fact that the features available for each
chipset vary in the extremes... I'm not sure what the VESA
specification covers in terms of this. This probably means that most
people will need a separate driver depending on which chipset they are
using in order to get any of these enhanced features and the available
features will differ between them... (how, for instance, should the
system or ncurses handle character colors when somebody is using a
multiple-colored font?)

I don't know if anybody is willing to do work on this or not... or if 
enough people are even interested.

 Reading 256 byte sectors is possible with 1.1.51 . The sector size

 There are several different sizes involved in the floppy driver:

 * 512 bytes is the default sector size for floppy disks, and also the
smallest size that the buffer cache code (VFS) can handle (fraction of
a buffer).
 *1024 bytes is the default size of a buffer for the VFS. (i.e. two
fractions)
 * 128 bytes is the smallest sector size that the floppy disk controller 
supports. All sector sizes are powers of 2 and multiples of 128.
size = 128 << sizecode

 If you upgrade to 1.1.51, don't forget to apply the patch at
ftp.imag.fr:pub/Linux/ZLIBC/floppy/QDF/fdp1.1.51-0210.diff.gz
in order to avoid the well known floppy unmount problems.
