You have to be a bit careful about this, I know of a system where

Modems should have a configuration option to also turn off (or tune) the
RTS threshold values for the modem's send buffer. Unfortunately, in most
modems there is no such thing. We could see more sensible modems if more
people would complain.

Oops, I meant "-2- or -3-". (Rationale: There should be a link-level
checksum. The modem error correction isn't end-to-end, but it's better than
no error correction at all.)

Grumble. We're talking about the _send_ buffer size here, i.e. the buffer
to the modem. Thruput averaging affects the rate which is used to empty
the buffer _from_ the modem, which is a totally different kettle of fish.

Averaging won't slow down a background transfer, but it'll delay
interactive stuff. (Unless your system is too slow and the serial port gets
overruns without averaging, of course.)

The current behavior depends on the -O flag. IMHO, that's a VERY stupid way

It reminds me of Micros*** Weird, which could (can?) not enter Formula mode

Reply-To: jon.lasser%goucher@wb3ffv.ampr.org (Jon Lasser) 

Does anyone have practical experience with the Gravis Ultrasound Max
under Linux?

I have three primary questions:
(1) Does the CD-ROM interface for the Panasonic drive work
properly under Linux (I have a Panasonic 563b drive, which currently
runs with my Sound Blaster 16).

(2) Are there any general incompatibilities between the board
and Linux? Any specific known problems?

(3) I'm currently using a Sound Blaster 16. IsGravis
Ultrasound Max considered an upgrade from the Sound Blaster? I mean, I
know that the digital audio is about the same, but is the WaveTable that
much better?

Frankly, I'm lusting over the board, but I want to make sure that it
works before I buy it, because I don't know enough to hack the kernel.
(yet).

Replies by e-mail are appreciated, although I do try to keep up with
this group.

Thanks in advance,

Subject: Linux's future support for ATA/IDE development thoughts...
Date: Tue, 11 Oct 1994 04:52:34 GMT

Hello Linux net-folks,

I've been following pretty closely on some of the discussions relating
to Enhenced IDE/Fast ATA topic and would like to maybe continue on
to see how it's and will effect Linux support for ATA drives. I don't
intend to do all at one shot so here goes the first two attempts...

But first some base-line terminology so we start out at the same ground:

I would like to use the term ATA rather than IDE since to me even SCSI
drives are candidate for IDE. Also, i tend to talk register mode
versus BIOS support when interfacing to the drive, i.e. direct I/O port
programming against BIOS ISR provider. Finally, if i may i would like
to include DIOW-/DIOR- interface signals when discussing various PIO
timing modes.  Oh, BTW at the host-end i tend to call the drive card,
host adapter card (HAC) whereas most people use the terminlogy of 
controller card.  Most ATA HAC's are pretty much "brainless" and does 
nothing but data buffering in between the host and the target drive.

Well, i'm not an expert in ATA drive land, however getting lot's of
practice at the work so maybe share some information with fellow 
Linux'ers and get plenty of feedbacks hopefully.  I've been funning
Linux for quite some time starting with ATA drives then with all
the advantage with SCSI, now am running Linux entirely from 1GB SCSI
drive.  However following thoughts come to me when thinking about
ATA drives + Linux:

1. Since ATA-2 spec is on its way of being finallized we'll expect to
   see more drives with support for fast PIO timing modes especially
   PIO mode 3 and yes, PIO mode 4.  For user to take advantage of these
   high speed data transfer rate one would need local-bus (VLB or PCI)
   ATA HAC that can strobe DIOW-/DIOR- at that frequencies.  Most if
   not all have special on-board ATA interface chip that's capable of
   interfacing at that high speed as well as BIOS extension or
   installable device drivers.  At very minimum these BIOS or device
   drivers will initialize various timing registers of interface chip
   to talk at that high data rate of ATA interface.  My concern is that
   since Linux is doing all ATA talking at non-BIOS, register level
   will this have to be changed later when supporting specific high-speed
   ATA HAC's?  I've done some measurement at work and having these
   cards power up and doing all register level drive access there after
   will NOT produce fast transfer.

   Looks as though these BIOS/driver routines have some special code
   besides your average "rep outsw" and "rep insw" instructions. So does
   this mean Linux now has to support specific ATA HAC's???  I guess
   days of generic ATA interface talking is over then...

2. ATA-2 has announced additional I/O ports for 2 more HAC's besides your
   current primary and secondary.  This results to total of 8 ATA drives
   under PC.  Any interest in supporting this under Linux... Hmmm, maybe
   i should get involved in this... I can't recall whether IRQ's are also
   defined or suggested...

- george

PS How do you REALLY know that your high-speed 1GB ATA drive is doing PIO3 or
   PIO4??? You REALLY don't unless...

PSS BTW, check out ftp://fission.dt.wdc.com's /pub/ata and /pub/standards for
    ATA/SCSI papers...  These really make very good bed-time readings... :-)

There is a known problem with BIOS and trying to boot off of a parition 
with more then 1024 cylindres.  I'm afraid I don't know if this coudl 
cause your particualr problewm or not.  Maybe someone with alittle more

1024 cylinders, you might try repartioning and see if the problem goes 
away...

        Any program that could statically link against both R5 and R6
would run perfectly with our R6 shared libraries, even if the binary
had been compiled against the R5 stubs.  In addition, programs that
used functions that had been renamed in R6 would also work.  (The
functions that the X consortium renamed were also renamed in our
jump files.)

        It is true that some obscure R5 calls do not exist in R6,
but that would only effect programs that would not successfully
relink against R6 anyhow.  If a program called one of these deleted
entries, the undefined routine acted as a no-op.  Deleting jump table
entries from new versions of shared libraries is nothing new.  For
example, there are now numerous __DUMMY__ entries in jump.vars for the
Linux C library.

        A program that referenced a routine that was no longer
supported by X11R6 would fail to relink, so it was quite simple for a
software developer to test if his or her program was effected.  In
other words, everything that could work would work.

        For whatever reason, XFree86 chose to ignore our jump tables
(which were publicly announced and anonymously FTPable), and instead
decided to build incompatible jump tables.  Perhaps XFree86 had some
technical reason for doing this, but I have yet to hear one.  If
XFree86 had had a more open beta testing process, this problem would
have been exposed and fixed long ago.

        There must be at least a couple of thousand people out there
using Motif (Metrolink, SWiM, X-Inside, etc.) right now.  I hope that
most of these people are on the internet, because the media costs
alone of sending all of these people new floppy sets would be about
ten thousand dollars, and that money has to come from somewhere.
There are problems on the business Motif packages will have to have
twice as much media or stores will have to stock two different
versions of Motif packages.  And that's only after the new libraries
become available.  In the meantime, in order to use the Motif shared
libraries, you have to keep the R5 shared libraries around, and you
may have other problems in recompiling, since the "-lX11" in a "-lXm
-lXt -lX11" will bring in the R6 libraries, and you'll probably have
the R6 #include files already installed too.

        I've already seen one poster on this newsgroup who was angry
at his Motif vendor and wanted to sell his copy of Motif.  That blame
is misplaced.  What is really needed is a statement from XFree86
explaining what technical benefits they saw that outweighed the
substantial costs of unnecessarily breaking binary compatability.

I meant to say:

        I did get a message from one XFree86 memeber who didn't

Thank you very much for the pointers. I was able to get things working

I realize that / has to be mounted read-only before init will
spawn the rc that eventually mounts things from /etc/fstab...
My question is: do I have to specify the mount option sb=8193
(or something else) to lilo?  Or is there some way to flag
an alternate (default) superblock in the ext2fs itself.

I mapped out block 1 (superblock?) of the partition using the -L
option in e2fsck.  I thought that maybe if the bad block list showed
block 1 to be bad ext2fs would automatically try 8193, then ...
I guess not?

Sorry about the cross-post, but regardless of the problem I am
interested in finding out how heavily ext2fs is hitting on disk
"hot spots".  I work out my disks pretty heavily under Linux;
my last disk (a Maxtor) gave out still under warranty and they
sent me this Seagate, which seems to be even crummier, it is
developing bad blocks at an alarming rate...
