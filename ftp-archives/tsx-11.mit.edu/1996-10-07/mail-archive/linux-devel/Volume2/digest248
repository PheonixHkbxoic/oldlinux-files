   I also see this with the new fast driver & 1.51. BUT, I really
   don't think it's related to *swapping*, per se. My experience
   suggests that this hang occurs (somewhat randomly) whenever you
   write _large_ amounts of data to disk. My system uses a swap file,
   so it seems unlikely that it's a swap file versus partition issue.
   I can recreate the hang by something as simple as untarring the
   linux source tree, or doing 'dd if=zImage of=/boot/zImage'. Not
   always, but often enough that I keep a boot floppy with 1.0.9 and
   the old driver handy (never have been convinced that the newer
   kernels don't play a part in the problem).  Also, there was a
   noticable increase in failures when I went from 8 megs to 16.
   This is high quality RAM, by the way, and hasn't shown ANY sign
   of giving trouble anywhere else. So, my theory is that with the
   filesystem buffers a lot bigger than they used to be, large
   amounts of stuff will be written to buffers before getting flushed
   every 5 seconds or whatever by update. During flush, then,
   something in the driver gets overloaded and ends up hanging.

   Don't know what to say...

I have a 486 pc with a Adaptec 7870 SCSI controler (for PCI bus) and a

   FWIW, I happened to be reading a Microsoft document called "The

something that may shed some light on the Adaptec picture.

   In the Beta Reviewer's Guide, MS makes much of the idea of
splitting device support into hardware-dependent and hardware-independent
components, the former being the responsibility of MS and the latter being
the responsibility of the hardware mfg.

   I wonder: if this strategy gains widespread acceptance among
hardware mfgs, isn't Linux going to have to find a way to come to
grips with it?

Lets go one step further... I'ld like such a system to keep a catalog of 
my CDs, so if I want t access something that is out on CD, and not 
currently mounted, itll ask me to mount the proper CD by name.

Subject: Report on gcc with P5 optimizations
Date: Wed, 28 Sep 1994 10:17:36 -0800

FWIW, FYI, ETC:

Several people asked me to report my experiences using gcc-2.5.8 with
pentium optimizations.  I got the version from sunsite, which appears
to be slightly different from the version from intel.  (For one thing,
the intel version claims to be revision 2.4.0.)  It compiled without a
hitch, and the kernel recompiled OK using -O2 but not -O4.  This is
consistent with earlier reports.  Bootup dies during delay loop
calibration.
I tried recompiling just this part of the kernel (main.c) using -O2, but
it died again a little later during the boot sequence.  I have not had
time to do a detailed investigation as to the cause of the problem, but
for now I think it is prudent to consider -O4 to be unsafe.

Unlike earlier reports, I perceive no performance change using the new
compiler.  However, much of what I am doing is memory-intensive, and so
I would not expect to see much speedup.

Subject: emufs (DOSEmu filesystem) - is it possible?


Hi,

First of all, excuse me for using the anon service, something seems to
be happening to my news host so I can't post.

There have been so many posts about mounting filesystems that are
supported by DOS but not by Linux (ie: Novell, Stacker, Doublespace,
etc), that it got me to thinking.

Wouldn't it be possible to use userfs and hack DOSEMU so that it would
export its filesystems? What I'm thinking about is to have a user-defined
filesystem (the code would basically be a trimmed-down DOSEMU with hacks
to talk to userfs) that exports all drives available to a DOSEMU
session. Of course, the "emufs" driver would first do a standard DOS
boot (ie, loading CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT) thus loading any drivers,
and then export them to Linux. The filesystem might look something like:

                            /dos
                              |
                -----------------------------
                |       |     |      |      |
                A       C     D      E     LPT1

Of course, the LPT1 file is an idea for the future, so that emufs could
also make available, for example, Novell printers.

Now, is this possible? Am I crazy? I don't know enough about the
internals of DOSEMU of userfs to evaluate this.

Just an idea,

Hello, fellow linuxers!

After installing kernel 1.1.45, when starting, I receive a warning saying
'obsolete route request made'. Well, I removed the command 
'route add 127.0.0.1' form rc.inet1 and the warning disapears, but cannot

Hmm.  Unfortunately most of us don't know all the sites that do our don't

Hi folks,
I got a weird problem with gcc 2.6.0:

main( int c ) { return c % 15; }

does not compile (gcc fills up all available memory and exits with a
'out of virtual memory' message). The simlilar program compiles fine:

const in xv = 15; main( int c ) { return c % xv; }

I suppose I should post this to some gcc group; I suppose it worked with
previous releases though I can't say.

The biggest drawback to this solution is that libraries relocated at
runtime would differ from the version of the libraries on disk, thus
swap space would have to be allocated to swap them out.  (with ELF and
pic or the current shared libraries nearly all the pages can be paged
from the library files on the filesystem.)

There is the APIC stanard from Intel (now at version 1.1) which most of
