Hi There!

The title says it all.  Will DOSEMU have DPMI fixed up enough to run Windows

I recently had got a PCI ethernet card using the Digital DEC21040

used with linux and how? Or where can I got some suitable drivers

Thank you in advance.

Try "efax".  It's a simple fax program for one machine.
It runs as a daemon, and upon receiving an incoming call,
if it is a fax, it receives it (and prints it if you want)
and saves it as a file.  If the call is a data call, it
can call another program to handle it.

PORTING OF SOFTWARE:

Here is the new simplified porting procedure.

For some reason DOSEMU *only* works with TERM=console, and not con80x50.
There is no con80x50 terminfo file, and the termcap entry is incomplete
(Why not just have one basecon=[all junk], then console:li#25:co#80:tc=basecon
and con80x50:li#50:co#80:tc=basecon ...?).

Also the /etc/DIR_COLORS had every entry EXCEPT con80x50.

I wrote a program to check stty and set the proper console, but is there an
easier way or some script?

Hmm.. Basicly a nice idea. But I'm pretty shure my 'basic' drivers are not your
'basic' drivers. I think the biggest feature of Linux that it runs with almost 
everything, because people do so much work for the drivers.
As to fishing in (with?) the Net:  from that I take that you have access to a
fast, fulltime, cheap and stable Net-account. Yes?
Because other people don't. An if I carry the 'basic' package home,
I want to be shure that the driver for my yoyo-vision card, my youneversaw-it
HD and all others are included.
This is of even greater paramount if targed Linux for the use by the general
public, not just computer-wizes and other wierdos alike (which does include me
in the later).

As I hear on the Amiga the sappling just started to bear fruit.
What do you complain about 6 MB when other systems ('basic', this time!)

        There is the CFS filesystem if you are in the USA. It basically
provides a user-level version of NFS that allows you to mount directories (and
their children) that are transparently encrypted. That is, the cleartext never
hits the disk and can't be read even by root. It also stores the filenames
themselves in an encrypted manner, so again not even root can see the names
of the files.

        I have CFS running on a 1.0.0 kernel and it seems to work fine.

...
   Other makes can be more tricky, as info about the remote control is
   often difficult to get.  The method used by "universal remotes" to
   handle this situation is to "record" a transmission by the original
   remote control, and play that back.

Don't overlook the fact that most sound cards have an audio input
device.  With the right transistor/IR photodector setup one could
build a universal remote that could capture and repeat (or decode
with the right software) any IR transmission (in stereo, in case
you want to locate the person using the remote) up to 20 kHz
(I'm not sure what frequency IR remotes use).  IR remotes
send a series of pulses at a particular frequency.  If you get
a special IC chip and set it to that frequency, it can output
a pulse/nopulse bit that you can poll from an unused parallel or
serial port.  
OTOH, there are vendors that sell PC/DOS based IR hardware/software.
I don't know where I put my Home Automation catalog, but you
can try in the home automation newsgroup.

Figure 20k to 40k  start/stop cycles on a "quality" hard drive of recent 
vintage. If the manufacturer does not specify the expected start/stop 
cycle lifetime, it is because it is less than 20k.

How much power can you expect to save?
A Quantum PD1800S (1.8 gigabyte SCSI) draws 8 watts when idle and 11 
watts when doing seeks 100% of the time. Whenever you start the motor, 
figure on needing about 35 watts for about 12 seconds. 

A smaller drive of the same generation would draw much less.

A major consideration for battery powered laptops but it pales in 
comparison to a 19" monitor or making a bag of microwave popcorn!

1536 for SLIP?  Hmmm....
You may be experiencing DNS lookup failures.  In fact, If you're using WinTrump
Alpha #18 or earlier I'd put money on it.  You also are probably experiencing
problems with dip-337-uri if that's what you are using.  You must upgrade
to dip-337-uri-i and you must poing your winTrump dns ip to a sun running
DNS. (or some other machine).  I've tried 2 different versions of the dns
software on linux and it will work with wintrump perfectly except for dns
queries.  bind 4.9.2-940221 is what I'm using on our Sun Sparc 5.
I haven't compiled this under Linux 1.1.50 but I'm not sure that would work.

I'm execlp'ing a process and this new process can't do a termios

What is the latest version os smail and where can I ftp it from ? 

I have 3.1.28.1 #5, Nov 93 and it is broken. It inserts extraneous 
linefeeds and tabs making the spool file looking like follows:

While Linux's pine (3.89) can read it just fine, other email readers are 
confused like hell.

Thanks, Caesar.

... and half the net is having the same trouble.

Here's the most important thing to remember:

*When using a multi-homed host as a router, EACH interface must have it's
own address.*

Routing on your local host tells IP where to send packets, based on their
destination address.  What you _tell_ the routing code is _which
interface_ to send the packets out on.  Therefore, each interface, (PPP is
an interface) must have a unique address.  Usually, you get the IP address
for your PPP interface from the provider's net, either statically, or
dynamically.  The "inside" address, the one you ifconfig onto your
ethernet interface, is part of your private net (either one you've
registered yourself, or part of a block assigned by your provider.)

A typical route information output in such a case might look like this...

Destination    Gateway          Netmask       Flags   MSS    iface
127.0.0.1      127.0.0.1        255.0.0.0     UH      1536   lo0
199.245.227.0  199.245.227.254  255.255.255.0 U       1436   eth0
default        198.147.221.1    255.255.255.0 U       1436   ppp0

(The person I'm helping with this right now, who owns those addresses,
will recognize them... :-)

This routes packets for the local host to the loopback interface, packets
for the local net (199.245.227) to the local interface which connects to
that net, and packets for every other network number to the PPP interface,
for forwarding to the outside world.

Everyone understand that?  :-)

Cheers,
