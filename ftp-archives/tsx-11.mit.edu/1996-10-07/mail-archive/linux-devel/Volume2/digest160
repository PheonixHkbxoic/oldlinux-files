The easiest solution is to use the patch I posted several months
ago and apply that to lmain.c.  It closes the hole correctly and
doesn't require any extra wrapper commands.

Just to echo my disdain for binary-only distributions, I had a friend
who recently was forced to buy a Linux CD pretty much because the
spare CD I have was binary-only.  So far the only people making money
off of Linux are the CD shops.

I haven't seen many - infact I don't think I've seen any!  The "problem" with
a unix system is that the terminal at the end of the wire can be of any type.
The only way a program can know is to use the $TERM variable.  I have yet to
see ANY program which has hard coded key combinations, although I've seen
plenty with their own variation on termcap - generally complete with a VT
keyboard entry.

Come on, make sense.  Dynamically allocating space required for the keys
based on the definitions in the terminfo/cap databases would mean that
the entire RAM resources of a machine wouldn't be used.  (Unless the
termcap string was so long that you couldn't feasibly access it anyway!)

Whereas if you had programmed it more efficiently then you would have had

: The main problem with longer sequences is TIME.  With the VT Fkey layout

Yes, this is one fault of the VT keyboard.  Does make decoding harder, but
still at least each key is uniquely decodeable!  Proper programming, and the
simple fact that users generally type ahead mean that this is not such a
great problem as it appears.

Wonder how this turned into a slagging keyboard conversation?  I still maintain
my conclusion of my last message in this thread.

        Hi netters,

When I login into a Linux system (1.0.9 or 1.1.18) from my home

gets frozen if I try to dump a large amount of text onto screen

I've never looked at the SunOS 4.x.x kernel, but I can't imagine that it was
done this way.  Spinlocks have timeouts on them, and you could easily have
a CPU wait for much too long due to the inherent possibility of starvation 
that comes with a spinlock.  

One way to handle SMP simply is to put spinlocks around all the kernel
data structures, or major subsystems.  This will still probably take a 
great deal of work to get it right, and it'll have problems.  
It's a good start though.

This probably has more to do with Solaris 2.x being based on SVR4.  For
starters SVR4 uses STREAMS instead of sockets!  Also, SVR4 typically
eats more memory than BSD.

So your conclusion must be : companies prevent techincal progress by developing
only stuff for accepted and wide spread hardware as they must orientate their

That is the problem : much money without any work. Companies must say "Dream..."
or "best OS" as they compete against ecah other. That needs resources to 
compete and so these resources can not do work on the product.

But do we need business men using Linux ? I do not need them. I am happy
in using Linux for my personal needs and work (e.g. Mails,News,graphical stuff).
Linux has developed to this high standard without any commercial leading-strings.
So Linux is any argument *against* commercial software and not for symbiose with
it, IMHO. The power Linux gives me to do my work let my laught about any
Windows-user, as he is wasting the power of his PC.
How long has it take to develope Solaris or UnixWare ? Very long. Are they 
better ? You gave the answer in your posting. So the true progress was done
by private people and not by companies. Linux as the best *NIX has a developing
time not as long as other PC-Unix had, but it is better. So, do we need commercial
software ? And even if Linus had not this great idea called Linux :
There is also Free-BSD.

The real problem is in the mind of most people : Everything which is good must 
be very expensive! So Solaris with high prices must be better than UnixWare
which seems to be better than Linux, as Solaris is more expensive and more
packed as UnixWare which is indeed more expensive than Linux. Or see Windows :
It is not good, it is bad. But : 1) the companies see only the stupid customer
buying his first computer. So they say : "hey, let's get Windows. You can simply
move the mouse-pointer round and do everything" And why ? Because they want
to get their percentage of the Windows-price. No computer-dealer would say to
the normal customer : "Use Linux, it is better", as he earns no extra money with
this kind of software. and 2) that is the point of view : everything must be
orientated on the big sell-numbers and not on the performance.
It is similar to cars :  profis know where to buy good stuff to tune their
car or to cause the car not to need such high volumes of gasoline. The 
average user of the car does not exactly know what does this machine (as I do not
know this), but it works : Fine ! I have not the time to intensive my knowlege
about cars and it makes me no fun. But there are people having fun on doing
this. So why should there be no people having fun in compiling every week
a new kernel for the system they use ? It is not car-tuning it is simply
computer-tuning. What is wrong on this ?

Have you considered sticking with non-blocking advisory file locks?
Often it is not necessary for a process to block on grabbing a lock,
if the process is able to deal with it properly.  Additionally, your
processes can always avoid deadlocks by agreeing on an ordering
convention when applying locks to multiple files.   (Say your
relations are identified by an internal numbering scheme, then you
would always apply non-blocking locks in ascending or decending
relation number order.)

I have found that relying on deadlock detection in the underlying
filesystem implementation has not been a pleasant experience.  In
particular AFS does not implement deadlock detection at all (among
other file locking features that are also not implemented, or are
broken; ie., non-blocking locks).

But if you do decide upon implementing deadlock detection in the Linux
kernel, it would definitely be appreciated here.

   IBM's C compilers under OS/2.
   Watcom compilers under OS/2 and DOS (do they have unix versions?)
   Zortech C compiler (I presume under OS/2 and DOS as well).
   Most likely the Mark Williams C compiler (they produce better
     compilers than operating systems (coherent)).

   GCC is designed to be PORTABLE first, optimal last.  In almost
   all cases, a DECENT architecture specific compiler will be as
   good as or beat GCC.  


I'd like to see some actual data to verify this.  In my own experience
GCC optimizes very well across most architectures.  I have yet to see
a DOS compiler that would consistently beat GCC generated code. For
instance, DJGCC on msdos produces a PovRay raytracer that is very
similar in performace to Watcom compiled version. 

On MIPS-based decstation, gcc nowadays beats MIPS native compiler, and
the MIPS-people have written a lot of papers about optimization.

If you post/mail some sample program, I can test gcc against native
compilers on various unix boxes, (Sparc, Alpha, HP-PA, MIPS).

I don't even have a Linux box. My machine is a SPARC 1; I was hoping for
some sort of free, and more importantly, general, client software.
However, I have access to Linux machines, and I'm not unwilling to work
