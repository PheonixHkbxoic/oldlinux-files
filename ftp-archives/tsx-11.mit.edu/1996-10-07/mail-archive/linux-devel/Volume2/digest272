Subject: Orchid CDS-3110 CD-ROM
Date: 6 Oct 94 20:25:45 GMT

I've recently purchased a pentium computer from Comtrade that has a brand
new Orchid CDS-3100 CD-ROM on it. The cdrom manual says it supports both
Mitsumi and Sony interface standards. I have compiled kernels with both
these drivers and the results are as follows.

Sony: Nothing...No error messages at all...No action from the cdrom.

Mitsumi: Error message saying it can't find the cdrom at IRQ 11...
         The cdrom makes a spine chilling noise that won't stop 
         until you reboot.

As to the error message from the Mitsumi driver my NCR scsi driver is at 
IRQ 11. (By the way Drew Eckhardt's driver works well, no problems at all,
with my SCSI card.) I have set my cdrom up at IRQ 10, I/O address 320.

First off, is it just a pipe dream to think that this cdrom will work with 
either of these drivers? Second, If one of these drivers can work with it 
is there a way to set the IRQ and I/O address in the drivers so it will
grab the right one (or does it always auto-detect these properly)?
Third, and finally, is anyone developing a driver for this cd-rom?

I'd appreciate any comments regarding this cd-rom.

Thanks,

Peter Nugent

THUS SPAKE Bill Wohler <wohler@newt.com>:
# 
#   Strick's posting of infilt gave me the idea that it would be
#   possible to firewall my (Linux) host at home which is directly
#   connected to the Internet via SLIP (or PPP).
# 
#   As more and more folks are getting the Internet into their homes on
#   inexpensive PC's, this might actually turn into an important aspect
#   of firewalls.

Anyone who has outgoing phone lines on their net-site-at-home
has a real potential liability if intruders get in.

I'm glad you're addressing this to comp.os.linux.development. 

I put the filtering hack inside the PPP driver, but really it would be
much better to have these features in the kernel.  Some things I do the
hard way, that could be done more easily, efficiently, and 
device independantly, inside the IP portion of the OS kernel.


( see ftp.yak.net /pub/infilt for the package we're referring to. 

  Also notice how I've tried to keep the model of security fairly
  simple -- there's not an infinite amount of stuff you can
  configure and get wrong.  In particular, there is no configuration
  based on IP addresses and masks, so it's not susceptable to
  a whole class of spoofs and common mistakes.

We have similar problems --

our setup:

486-DX2 66
IDE 720MB hard disk  ( NO SCSI ! )
8 MB RAM
NE2000 ethernet card

In our setup, the hangs started when I upgraded from 1.1.10 to 1.1.45, and 
became signicantly less frequent when I went to 1.1.50.  Man, if you figure 
this out, I'd much appreciate it!

I have a Gateway P5-66 with the same ATI Mach 32 PCI card, and have had
nothing but trouble with XF86_Mach32.  After experiencing countless
crashes of exactly the type you describe, I decided to switch to the
8514 driver (XF86_8514).  This version of the X server uses the 8514
emulation support that's part of the Mach 32 card.  It's a big step down
to go with the 1024x768 resolution of the 8514 driver, but I'd rather have
bigger dots than a flaky system.  After making the switch, my system has
been rock solid...

I have had these problems, but the problem was that the Annex (for
some reason) couldn't handle the traffic and dropped the carrier
with a error message (CLR).  I guess this happens when you load
an annex up with more than it can handle.  It was very reproduceable.
When I increased the inter-packet delays everything worked fine.

Maybe this is your problem....

Tk's coding capabilities are a bit limited for some things.  I have used it
and XF (a freeware GUI builder for Tk; check harbor.ecn.purdue.edu) to build
GUI interfaces for some command-line-based programs, and today I used expectk
(a merge of expect and Tk) to build a GUI-based program which hops across a
network to one system, thence via cu to a third system, grabs some data from a
Unify 2000 database, and brings it all the way back to the first system.

There's also Exmh (caveat, I'm a beta tester), an alternative user interface
for MH which is based on Tk and has MIME capabilities (unlike xmh).

The big advantage of Tk as an X toolkit is that it has an OLE-killer :-) built
in, in the form of the "send" command.

Date: 3 Oct 1994 21:06:38 GMT

This question goes out to those people out there who are running CAP (the 
Columbia Appletalk Package) on a Linux machine.  

Is there anyone who is using the lwsrv.beta from munnari.oz.au (or 
anywhere else) on linux?  We need it so we can use LaserWriter 8 on our 
macs, and I'm having some problems compiling it on linux.  I'm using 
Linux 1.1.49, and I've tried CAP6.0 pl 142 (the patch level that 
lwsrv.beta was created at) and the newest, CAP6.0 pl 192.  Here is the 
relavent chunk of output from 'make':

yacc parsey.y
lex parsel.l
cc -DBYTESWAPPED -O  -DLINUX  -c y.tab.c
parsel.l: In function `yylex':
In file included from parsey.y:418:
parsel.l:5: too few arguments to function `yyunput'
parsel.l:16: too few arguments to function `yyunput'
parsel.l: At top level:

parsel.l:422: `input' previously defined here
parsel.l:165: warning: `searchkeywords' was declared implicitly `extern' 
and later `static'
make: *** [y.tab.o] Error 1

Now, on Linux, 'lex' is a link to 'flex'.  I even tried changing the lex 
command to 'flex -l' (-l is supposed to provide maximum lex 
compatibility).  Of course, I had to change the Lex library in the 
Makefile to -lfl (for flex, changed from -ll).

Has anyone got this to compile and work under Linux, or should I just 
start tearing my hair out now?  

Thanks for any help!

I've done a lot of work with security issues and SunOS, as well as operating
Linux systems since 0.99.  Linux, IMHO, is much more secure than SunOS, mostly
because the Linux community works together to improve the system, while Sun
seems at times to be working against its user community.

Now, it may be true that Sun systems suffer from more attacks because they are
much more popular than Linux, HPUX, etc.  However, the nice thing about Linux
is that if you find a problem, YOU HAVE THE SOURCE, you can fix it yourself if
you have to, although its likely that someone out there already has.

Security in UNIX systems is largely a matter of the skill of the people
administering the system.  A Linux system run by an inexpierenced UNIX
administrator is going to have as many problems as a Sun system run by an
inexpierenced administrator.

Bottom line is, Linux is a good, stable system, and coupled with a talented
administrator, is going to be as secure as anything else on the net.

I also like this idea; it does not require that library code be
position independent.  There was a long thread about the actual
performance penalty of PIC; from that I gather that it's at least 3%
and possibly more.

I don't see why this is a problem; if it can be done at program load
time, it can certainly be done at run time.  It only requires that the
load-and-relocate function (and perhaps the locate-symbolic-entry-
point functions) be available to executing processes.

Try a shareware NFS client for DOS, which works over a packet driver.
