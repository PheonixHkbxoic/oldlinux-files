So you would agree with perhaps:

8 bits = short char
16 bits = long char
32 bits = short int
64 bits = long int

the default char and int sizes could be comile time / command line
options. The short and long qualifiers are already part of the language
anyway.

I agree with those who dislike the current GNU C "long long int" for 64
bits.

If you don't want to wait for another patch, you can edit rarp.c (in net/inet)
and put a #if 0 just before the "struct arphdr" line, and the #endif after the
closing brace.  There will be a nested #if 0/#endif which is within the
structure declaration.

   Over in the next thread people were talking about Unicode; why not

   16 bits = char
   32 bits = short
   64 bits = int, long

   Of course that would break a lot of things, but such is the price of
   progress :-)

That would actually make sense, except there isn't a data type 'byte'.
Perhaps this would work:

  8 bits = byte
 16 bits = char
 32 bits = short
 64 bits = int
128 bits = long (done by the compiler with 64 bit instructions)

What I'm wondering is:
a) how long something like this would take
b) how reliable it would be

I too would be willing to work on a project like this, but as to whether
the answer is to write "free" AFS client software, or to write a totally
new system, I'm not sure. Kerberos 4 is out there, and is robust, and
may be a good starting point security-wise. Kerberos 5 is also out
there, but unless you invest time getting real kadmin servers and
such.... 

Anyhow, perhaps everyone interested in something like this should form a
mailing list?

Yeah, I've seen a few people post Xconfig entries for 320x200 that would

90 Hz, which is all it's spec'ed up to.

I also have a 360x270 mode that should work, but it needs a 12 or 12.5 
MHz dot clock.  My video card's manual says that it has 12.5 MHz dot 
clock that it uses for VGA 320x200 mode, but XFree86 2.1 doesn't find 
that clock when it does the probe.  The lowest one it finds is 25 MHz.  
Does anyone know a way to convince the X server to use a dot clock other 
than one it finds in the probe it does at startup?

Well, that's how it is. As an example, while our server is running Linux,
we use a DOS box running KA9Q and ISDN packet drivers (PAPI, ISPA) as
our Internet router.

The kernel mentioned above seems to work for some people. I'd expect it
to become stable within the next months. It is the most complete free
ISDN implementation I know of, and I would advice anybody interested
in programming ISDN things under Linux to check it out.

Can't resist this one.  I'm half of a new startup company.  We're pushing the
envelope of PC hardware with a high resolution image display/processing
system.  We chose linux as our primary PC OS because it makes our 
(comparitively cheap) PC's perform like sparcstations for about 1/4 the
cost.  The only reason we don't use linux across the board is because there
isn't a sparc port (yet).  I expect our product will stress test linux in
new ways.  Further, I anticipate some OS development that will ultimately
benefit everyone which we will do on behalf of our product.

Linux was our only REAL alternative.

Actually the 72pin SIMM spec allows for up to 64MBytes of RAM on a
single simm (maybe more, but I KNOW it goes to 16Mx36bits)  That will
get you something like 384MB :).  Gosh, thats a lot of RAM.  Dunno what
a SINGLE user is gonna need that much ram for.  I'd say 32MB should be
more than adequate for anything you might be able to do on a PC/x86 type
box.  If your application calls for more than that, then you need
something a little more esoteric anyway.

Hmmm,  you need a 122 key IBM keyboard with an extra row of function keys
(f13...f24) above f1...f12.  "common" (hahahahahaha) practice uses
shift-f1 thru shift-f12 for f13 to f24 respective.

I did not mean to imply that the wyse keyboard layout was the be-all and
end-all of keyboard layouts.  Just that the Fkeys sent SANE logical
sequences of keys.

Down-Arrow produces a LINE-FEED (CTRL-J) actually.  The _left arrow_ is
generally the problem child.  These keyboards are also reprogrammable
on the newer models (to use your argument) and I generally map all my
wyse-150's to the SCO console layout, or use SCANCODE MODE, and the SCO
keymaps.  Simplifies things quite a bit with SCO's scancode mode.

>*Not* my favourite keyboard!  IMPOSSIBLE to tell whether the backspace or

>(stty erase '^H' anyone?)

Ahh, well, that is another bone of contention with me and the default
tty settings on login, using DEL for destructive backspace I find
annoying, but that tends to be what most mainframe and academia users
are used to.  In the DOS world they use backspace, SCO and Coherent also
use backspace for erase.

Err, okay, here's the deal sparky.  Wyse has sold a WHOLE SHITLOAD of
terminals.  The VT market is large, but nothing beside the wy50
compatable market.  Man those ADM-3's, wy-50/60/120/150/350/325/etc
televideo 9xx, altos, link, etc are EVERYWHERE.

There are _ALWAYS_ limits.  Using the entire RAM resource of a machine
to map keycode sequences would seem to me to be rather wasteful yes?

Additionally long keyboard sequences are increasingly time consuming to
decode, and require longer detect timeout intervals ESPECIALLY when used
remotely over a modem with compression turned on.  I wrote an f-key
decode sequence with timeout to decode _anything_ up to the machine
resource, but to save going nuts I avoided sorting the sequences into a
tree and simply implemented a linear in-stream compare with shift
holding chars in a queue of the same size as the longest key sequence
you are decodeing.  Real pain in the ass, and it'll really beat the
machine if you define a few hundred 10 character Fkey sequences.

The main problem with longer sequences is TIME.  With the VT Fkey layout
the lead-in key is also a commonly used key used to back up one step in
most programs.  This means you _have_ to implement a timeout to detect a
naked escape.  Using a leadin like CTRL-A or maybe something odd like
CTRL-] means you can INSTANTLY detect the press of ANY single key on the
keyboard.  This makes your applications more responsive.  This makes
users happier.  Oh yea, who cares about _USERS_?  Silly me.

Because a compile is not a single process it is like 5 or 6ish

cpp -> cc1 -> cc2 -> cc3 -> [as ->] ld -> object_file

Depends alot on your compiler and how it does stuff like pre-processing,
and symbol resolutions.  Most masssage your program for at least 4
passes.  And they all run in a kernel pipleine, so you cut context
switching to do the compile in half for starters. and of course later
stages get a processor each to themselves.

5. On the other hand, I can tell you how to make lots of money with Linux: 
   simply download the archives of tsx-11, sunsite, nic.funet.fi,

   or similar, and sell if for US$35 per copy. It's that easy. Let's say,
   an average user is looking for "the better OS" and wants to try out
   Linux. He buys a "Dream Linux" CD - and is lost. Nothing works "out of

   What will happen? I'm quite sure that most of these desperated people
   will close the Linux chapter - forever.

  Quo vadis, Linux? Do we continue to like Linux "as is", or should we
change something in order to encourage companies to develop commercial, but
sophisticated end-user software for this beautiful OS? Do we continue to
keep Linux a powerful tool for wizards only, or do we want to see Linux 
being used in offices and other commercial environments? If we *really*
want Linux to succeed, we *need* the companies and their commercial products!

                mount -r -t raving.human /dev/keyboard /soapbox

I would, if I may, like to address these two points that Mr. Schumacher
makes.  First, regarding "5." above, not all Linux CD distributions are mere
dumps of the archive sites nor do they sell for large amounts of money.  With
some distributions, these DO "work out of the box" (assuming the user has
fairly standard hardware), they DO contain reasonable documentation (what
about all the FAQs, HOWTOS, Installation Guide, LDP publications, etc. 
provided as ASCII text with a DOS/Windows viewer for the new user and a
shell-based viewer for existing UNIX(tm) users?), and they DO provide a
reasonable amount of hotline support for FREE, albeit not necessarily through
a toll-free number (I think that someone paying $20.00 for a complete Linux
release with documentation doesn't mind spending a bit more of their own
money on phone calls if they run into trouble and indeed, have noticed this
in actuality).  [As an aside here to avoid flames, I must say that I assist
with Technical Support for the InfoMagic CD distributions.]  In my experience,
most users who call with technical support needs have accidentally overlooked
something or need a small pointer to the appropriate documentation; i.e. they
are NOT the clueless, brainless masses who are afraid to go beyond the 
bounds of vendor handholding.  Given the extremely wide variety of peripherals
that Linux supports (particularly in the CD-ROM area) there will be some 
problems... this is unavoidable.  It is far easier to take the attitude of
a vendor such as SCO or SUN and say "We will support THESE hardware config-
urations and ONLY THESE hardware configurations."  Given this option, Linux
installations could be automated to the point of "mount the CD, boot the
diskette provided, go to lunch."  And do not forget the capital investment
necessary to bring a CD to market... collecting the files, paying royalties,
premastering, mastering, pressing, packaging, inventory, staff.... I paid
a LOT for Solaris 2.3 for one of my SPARCs (yes I do use vendor software
at times) which arrived with serious bugs and then was informed that I'd 
have to PURCHASE the new "update" CD to fix many of those bugs.  Yessir!
Vendor support, you say?

As far as commercial products for Linux, I think that if they are there,
they will be purchased.  The recently announced Flagship package (a 
Clipper and xBASE clone to compile applications written in this popular
format) is just such an example.  They have a demo version that can be
downloaded and tried out for free and a special offer to Linux users 
wherein a single-user license is $199.00 and an unlimited-user (development
AND end-user packages) is only $499.00.  I spent my own money on this package
after running the demo, works great!  I applaud this company on their
forsight and willingness to take a chance on Linux rather than sit back
like many of the "commercial" vendors, afraid to invest anything at all in
a new environment.  The smart vendors will be getting in now, while the
market is relatively young and it's easier to capture a large share of it
rather than wait until it's "safe" and they become just another one of a
few hundred betting that they can capture 10% of the market!  Somehow,
the marketeers never see this flaw in their reasoning!  ;-)

Subject: Help!--Compiling 1.1.50
Date: 11 Sep 1994 04:24:21 GMT

I am trying to compile the 1.1.50 kernel and get the following error
at the very end:
        ld: No such file or directory for crt0.o
Could someone please point me to where this is supposed to be and where
I can get it from.  (I have had some problems with a corrupted file
system and have ended up wiping a few things here and there :(. )

Details:

Details:
        downloaded and untarred the 1.1.45 kernel
        applied patch.46 to patch.50 with 'patch -p0 < patch.xx'
        ran make:
                make config
                make dep
                make clean 
                make zImage

        The above error occured while running 
                make -C zBoot 
        in direcotory '/usr/src/linux/zBoot'

Thanks,
        Greg (greg_warnes@byu.edu)
