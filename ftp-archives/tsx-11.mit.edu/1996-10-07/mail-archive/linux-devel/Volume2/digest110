You are talking at the system level.  I was talking at the processor level.
What makes Pentium SYSTEMS cost effective is:
 1) volume and vendor independence
 2) Pentium systems in general:
    a) have lower resolution/slower video hardware
    b) have smaller hard disks
    c) have less RAM

Do not confuse processor with system.  The Power Macintosh
uses a totally new and different processor from any of its
predecessors and yet runs the SAME software and OS, and
delivers much greater price/performance.  The same can be
done with the IBM style PC, although vendor independence 
may turn out to be a hindrance.

Configure a Pentium system which is identical to an SGI
Indy and they will have very similar price/performance,
even though the Pentium PROCESSOR is more expensive
than the MIPS processor.

Here is a Pentium Machine which is configured similar to a
$6500 Indy:

99MhZ Pentium PCI bus motherboard       $2500
32Meg RAM                               $1000
#9 GXE Level 12 video card              $ 500
ViewSonic 17 Monitor                    $1000
Keyboard, 1.44M floppy, mouse, serial   $ 300
400Meg SCSI disk                        $ 350
BusLogic SCSI controller                $ 350
Soundblaster                            $ 100
Case and Power Supply                   $ 100
Ethernet adaptor                        $ 200
CCD camera                              $ ???
Operating system                        $ ???
                                        -----
                                        $6400 minumum

Note that, at the price shown, the PC will not do full motion video or
capture images, nor will it be as fast overall as the SGI.

I am not advocating buying workstations.  I am advocating replacing the
PROCESSOR in the PC.  There are now VL bus (and soon PCI) motherboards
with RISC processors.  These motherboards use inexpensive PC components.

Why stick with the overpriced/underperforming Intels. Sure, DOS
compatibility.  Well, I don't use DOS or Windows, so that is not an
issue for me.  Maybe it is for some.

I have had the same problems while using teh 1542CF with 1.0, 1.0.9 and
1.1.11.  Eventually I've tested the thing by directly writing to one
of the partitions on the SCSI drive (50 MB of incrementing chars written,
then read, and the offending char's printed.)  Some of the bits (usually
only one per byte) get lost (inverted.)  It happens both on writing
and reading.  I suspected a problem with 1542CF (driver or the cable) but
it may not be.  I have had no problems (knock wood :) on the same machine
while using IDE drives (1.0, 1.0.9, 1.1.11, 1.1.45.)  I shall have to
check the behavior when only the card supplies the SCSI termination power,
and when the drive is passively terminated (the drive, Adaptec and the
cable live very happily in another machine devoted to OS/2 and DOS.)

Hi all

I have spent most of today with applying patches 36 -- 45 on my Linux

until i read the latest faq...

Anyway, my ../linux/Makefile and my ../linux/tools/version.h both agrees on
V1.1.45. Regardless of this, my system says 1.1.35 after reboot (both in the

Just to avoid misunderstandings; yes, I did a complete rebuild between each
patch (make dep && make clean && make zlilo), and got new /vmlinuz images
from each build. Makes it even more strange, yes ? :-)

what is the problem with the linux keymaping. I can generate 16 different
characters/sequences per key as far as I am aware. linux seems to
supports all shift/control/alt posabilities. 

What is it that SCO can do that linux not? Or is it just you haven't
bothered using loadkeys and the default map defines some sequences as
the same.

OK, I'll bite into this flame-fest.

Errr, that's a little overpriced.  Most places don't put the P100 parts in
their price lists, but I've seen P90 PCI motherboards for under $1200.

>32Meg RAM                              $1000

72 pin SIMMs, same for both.  This is a little unfair, since Linux systems
use less memory than the SGI for most tasks.  Try running the SGI window
system with 8M of memory -- I've run Linux+X with 4M.

>#9 GXE Level 12 video card             $ 500

You can get accelerated PCI video cards starting at $125.  $200 will get 2M
of video memory for 1200x1024x8 resolution.  Price is very non-linear past
that point.  A major advantage is that you can choose which aspects of the
system are important enough to pay extra for.

>ViewSonic 17 Monitor                   $1000

Perhaps a little high -- nice 17" monitors are around $850, and sleazy ones
are $600.  Monitors sold into the high-volume PC market tend to be priced
more aggressively than similar monitors in the workstation market.

>Keyboard, 1.44M floppy, mouse, serial   $ 300

Ackkk!  You really are over estimating here.  You can get all this for under
$100.  There are some very nice keyboards for under $30 (although few under
$20 qualify as "nice" :->).

>400Meg SCSI disk                       $ 350
Same everwhere.  On a PC-type system you have the *option* of lower cost
IDE disks, which can perform quite well in one-drive systems.  Say, $269 for
540M? 

>BusLogic SCSI controller               $ 350

NCR PCI SCSI-2 controllers are $70.  The $1300 P90 motherboards have it
built in.

>Case and Power Supply                  $ 100
As low as $40.  I prefer a smaller case.  Will your Indy let you put in the
nine disk drives that some $100 cases will?

>Ethernet adaptor                       $ 200

Erk!  Where are you getting these numbers?  As low as $33, but plan on
spending just under $100 for a PCI or VL bus one.  Any how will you upgrade
the Indy next year, when 100Mbs ethernet becomes common?

That's just way more than a reasonable Linux box will cost.

That's true.  I think the new SGI full motion thumbnail video is a really
great toy, and their demo is amazing.  If I wanted to do that kind of video
work, I would get an SGI.  But for many other kinds of work the Linux system
would do as well or better, and be much less expensive.

Well, I started such a thread in the kernel mailing list a few months
ago and I wrote a patch that allows the console to understand UTF-8.
But this patch only supported the IBM character set subset of Unicode
and no new glyphs were defined. I can mail this old patch to anyone
interested, but it has only been tested against late pre-1.0
kernels. I still have plans for a font cache support in the console
that will automatically load those 256 (perhaps even 512) characters
that are currently needed in the VGA font memory. But unfortunately,
I don't even have Linux hardware at home currently, so this project has to
wait until this is fixed first ... ;-) Ask me in 2 months again.

There are also rumours that someone in Australia is working on a
Unicode capeable xterm version, but I don't know any details.
Who knows more?

BTW: various information about Unicode, UTF-8, etc. is available on
ftp.uni-erlangen.de:pub/doc/ISO/charsets/.

Subject: ext2fs floppy/82077 corruption with 1.1.49
Date: 1 Sep 1994 14:56:16 +1000


        This may shed some more light on the floppy corruption reported
earlier. This only seems to happen with the more advanced floppy controller
(reported as a "post-1991 82077") and _not_ the standard 8272A based
controllers. (The 82077 can be found on the more expensive SCSI cards
such as the aha-154X, buslogic cards, AMI-FastDisk, etc.)

This is guaranteed to demonstrate the problem on 82077 based systems.
I have verified it on two systems with 82077 chips on cards from
different manufacturers. I know it did so on 47 and 48, as well as 1.1.49, 
but can't vouch for how far it goes back. I sent this to the KERNEL
channel, but I think the mail-server ate it.  :-(

1) mke2fs a floppy
2) mount it and copy a big (~500k) file to it (or several files)
3) unmount it but _don't_ eject it
4) run "e2fsck -vrf /dev/fd0" --- it will come up clean (reading the cache)
5) eject it and immediately stick it back in (set disk change flag)
6) Repeat step 4 -- you will get most of the blocks in the above file(s)
   being marked as "not in use".

Also, a notebook that now claims to have an 8272A (but printed the message
"floppy: FIFO enabled" with the 1.1.3X kernels) also exhibits this
corruption. The same notebook could not even use the floppy for
kernels 1.1.42 --> 45 (the ones that used the faster 720k step rate)

I could not get the same sequence to produce the corruption with a
standard 8272A based FDC.

Perhaps we should have a way in which the 82077 can be used as a
bog standard 8272A (like it was in kernels < 1.1.23) until all the 
enhanced FIFO features of the 82077 are sorted out.

In fact, on all my wy150 terminals I redefined all the programmable keys

New terminals from Wyse and ADDS support SCO console native.  They also
support SCANCODE mode and/or "pc-term" mode.  The ability to pass
scancodes raw into an application is awesome.  SCO Unix's ability to
translate serial line scancodes into ASCII/ANSI sequences is a definate
Big time help when trying to do some of the stuff we do, (IBM S/36

If you want Linux to emulation SCO _for REAL_ you set the bar pretty
high indeed.  SCO has eliminated MANY of the "little small problem"'s
and issues in it's rather pricey OS.  The Rumor mill says the upcomming
SCO release is going to raise the bar even quite a bit higher.  We'll
see what happens.

GREAT if they followed a contiguous pattern, but they don't do that.  I
don't care what DEC did.  A suggestion would be something like:

\E[{fkey number}#

so f1 = \E[1#
   f2 = \E[2#
   ...
   f999 = \E999#

Which brings us to ...

Sure, throw away the dusty deck.

Well, sortof anyway.  I should say mostly.

'Splain where F22 is on a VT100 will ya?

Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha!

Behind the wierd PC keyboard ....

The Wyse/Adds/ADM/Televideo/Hazeltine/etc ad nauseum terminals are WAY,
WAY, WAY more comman than _any_ DEC terminal.  I'd be willing to bet
Wyse has sold more WY-50's than DEC has sold VT terminals combined. 

The WY-50 uses a CTRL-A leadin with characters from the ASCII chart
starting with '@' == 1 and work their way up the ASCII chart IN ORDER,
following the character with a CR.

The WY-50 was sort of the standard from which all other's after were
defined.  And I might add the WY-50 is one BLIND FAST terminal for
screen response, largely because of the laconic control sequence set,
albeit a tad cryptic.

I have _NEVER_ seen a consistant DEC VT Function key keymap, but you can
rest assure that if you power on a wyse 50/60/120/150/55/30 and press
F1, your gonna get ESC-@-CR.

So if you wanna emulate the "Most common" sequences you'd best pick the
Wyse keyboard sequences.
