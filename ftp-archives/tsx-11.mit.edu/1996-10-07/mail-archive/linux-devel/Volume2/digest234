  Sorry for asking, but I'm getting totaly clueless. What binary
  format is used on Linux for binaries and objects ? Is it
  ELF or a.out ? I know it isn't COFF since that is the format
  I know best and I'm always out of luck :-/

  I'm experimenting with the BFD library with format a.out-i386-linux
  but with no success. Therefore my stupid question, where is the
  ELF reference in the article comming from ?

  Please give a short answer and then tell me to subscribe to the

Well, I'm going to have a go at writing a driver for the UMAX 840, a SCSI
flatbed.  (Because I happen to have one, and would rather let it sit than
even boot winblows.)  From what I hear, the UMAX folks should be good about
giving out the info...I will be talking to them sometime in the next few
days.  This will be my first driver, but I fully intend to do it, as it
doesn't seem my scanner is going to be supported unless I do.  

Anyway, being a newbie at this driver writing stuff, I'd like input on
any sort of hooks etc that should be in this thing for stuff folks might
want to add later.  I know nothing about TWAIN, but if it's something I
should even be worrying about, I'd appreciate some pointers in that
direction as well...  As long as I'm writing this thing, it might as well
be of use to as many others as possible, so be sure and speak up if there  
anything I may easily do to make it more general, etc... I am wondering
what degree of similarity there is between SCSI flatbeds from different
mfrs..  Is it likely that once a driver for one SCSI scanner is written,
others will be a good deal easier?  

Anyway, if this is the sort of thing you are interested in seeing,
please bombard me with any useful information you may have.

If the shared lib type will be changed, is it possible to have a sort of
interface from the old one to the new one? I mean i.e a libc.so.... which seems to
be one of the old type, but will use the new libc.so..., mainly a "jump-table".
So the libs will not be in memory twice if programs linked for the old ones
are used.

This guy is right. I have seen the mess that occurs when you try
to implement real-world business programs on a GUI platform. In the
real world, business runs on numbers and text and SHARED databases.

The ideal computer system to do real-world business applications
provides only what is needed and nothing more. This makes a Linux
box with a dozen terminals and Flagship's dBase software, the
IDEAL business computer system, especially when you look at
the needs of small and medium sized business.

There is real money to be made here by people who are willing to
design and build computer systems (hardware and software) to meet
the needs of your local business community. 

While the rest of the PC world is trying to sell a Novell network
with 6 486's, you can walk in and sell 1 486, 5 terminals and
Linux. Your solution will be cheaper and will actually run FASTER
than the solution with 6 CPU's. That's because you don't have
any network overhead since you only transmit screens full of
information to the terminals rather than database chunks.

There is good money to be made in designing and writing business
programs, advising what hardware/software to buy and babysitting
the whole system to make it work. I often find that I have to
redo hardware installations that the local computer retailler
has screwed up because they all seem clueless. Things like
incorrect IRQ settings on add-in cards like SCSI host adapters
or Digiboard PC/8e's.

The WD80*3 and SMC Ultra use different methods of enabling memory.
Do you know which one this card is similar to?

Those delays shouldn't be necessary with the UltraChip.  They were for
earlier chips that needed a recovery period between accesses.  That was a
bug, not a feature.

BTW, which driver are you trying to use, the SMC Ultra or WD80*3?
Is the ethernet address correctly detected?
Are you receiving any packets at all?  Even errors?  Check /proc/net/dev.
What addresses can the board end up at?

Hello all !

Two weeks ago i send the following message, but i get no responce.
So I post it again and hope someone can answer me:

Can someone help me ? I want to use my Colorado streamer DJ-10 with
controller card FC-10 on my Linux system ! I get the patched ftape-driver

and I'am using kernel version 1.1.49.

Now when I give the command "mt -f /dev/ftape reten " the tape go's from the
beginning to the end and return. That is it what the tape should do, but
when I want to read from the tape with:

mt -f /dev/ftape erase

or 

mt -f /dev/ftape status

the tape moves and I get the message: I/O error !

Can someone help me about this problem ?

You can reach me via Internet at the adress:

I'd expect this behaviour with every compiler.  clock(3) reports the
*cpu* time, not real (wall clock) time.  Of course, while waiting for
input your program does not need any cpu time.  To get real time use
time(3), or gettimeofday(2) for better resolution.

 NO the Promise does not, as reported to me by Promise.  According to
the promise people all 3&4 drive support is done through the primary (i.e
standard) controller IO ports and addresses.  I have the source to 
Promise drivers for ATT & SCO under non-disclosure.  Unfortunately I
have not had the time to do much more than experiment and those
experiments have not been successful.  I know that they read the drive
configurations from the controller nvram but have not successfully be
able to get that to work under Linux.

I have two WDs on the primary port of my promise and get occasional
lockups also.  Mine do not appear to be related to heavy disk activity
however.  I would almost suspect a timing problem with defered writes 
(which is more likely to happen under heavy load).

Another thing about the Promise controller is that it does not
support the multisector (hdparm) transfers.  I am ready to sell mine
and just get a generic VL bus controller.

I've used something like this system on Solaris 2, and ended up in the
ludicrous state of being unable to format disks, as every time I put
them in they were mounted, and then fdformat would give 'device busy'...

I'm sure there's a way round this but do bear it in mind :-)

There's no reason to do it for dos disks only -- see other threads on
the 'user' option to mount.

    Thought I'd ask here before I bite off more than I care to chew.
Has anyone tried to dress up the cdu31a driver to allow more than 1
drive per linux box?

thanks,

Or synchronous mounts.  I know sync means a big performance hit, but
floppies are so slow anyway I doubt anyone'd notice too much.
