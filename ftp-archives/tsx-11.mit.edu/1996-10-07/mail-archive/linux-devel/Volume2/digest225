Having msdos automount, but not minix, would solve much of the security

Date: 25 Sep 1994 15:05:38 GMT

The STB Lightspeed VL is a really fast card based on the W32i/ET4000.
But I noticed it also has video mode 0x21 which adds 132x60 capability,
but this was not in the setup.S, though it was simple to add.

I remember asking for a card that supported 132x60 text and no one mentioned
this (Trident and Oak were the only others that I know supported this mode).

I am really pleased with this card.  It does DOS, Windows, and Linux - X
windows very fast and it coexists with my monochrome adapter and my 8514/a
card and doesn't require anything funny in the memory map.  It also seems to
have VESA modes in ROM.

People occasionally ask what video card to get.  They should definately
check out this card.  I paid just  under $200, which is the current street
price in my area.  (You may have other applications which would dictate
using a different card, so investigate your options - I am just saying I
know this card works for my application).

I have installed the ftape1.13b, 
compiled ok, installed ok, ...

The problems are when I write to tapes, I get a lots of write errors and 
also a lots of overruns.

The tape has been formatted under DOS or Windows (CBWLITE) ? not too sure 
as my brother did it!

Is there any formatting tools comming up for Linux?


Does anybody experiencing the same problems?

My system is:
486dx50 EISA
20MB RAM
Adaptec 1742A (EISA-Enhanced mode)
Colorado 250MB attached to the floppy.
Quantum LPS525 HDD

Subject: Re: 1+ Gig SCSI Drives
Date: 25 Sep 1994 15:18:08 GMT

THE LIMIT ON DOS PARTITIONS IS 8.25GB NOT 1GB

The disk access (int13) allows for 512 byte sectors * 255 sectors * 63 heads
* 1023 Cylinders, which equals 8.25G.  (actually it is 64 heads and 1024 
cylinders since the size call for these asks for the last valid number and
these start at zero).

Not all drivers handle this properly (dos or linux)  The following
is a repost of an analysis I did:

I have noticed that many SCSI drivers don't implement biosparam correctly
for disks > 1G.  What follows is code that exactly duplicates the Qlogic
DOS driver's parameter returns.  It is possible that a DOS version of one
of the older drivers also cannot support >1G drives.  Here is the list:


Drivers that cannot go above 1GB (because they only support 64/32/<1024).

aha152x         aha1740         pas16           t128            wd7000


Drivers that implement large partitions (though may not do the 8Gb
truncation, and may not do exactly 1Gb partitions the same)

aha1542         buslogic


Drivers that have a custom system for determing this

fdomain         segate          ultrastor       53c7,8xx


The following is my code for this function and has been verified:
---cut here--- 
int                 qlogic_biosparam(Disk * disk, int dev, int ip[])
{
/* This should mimmic the DOS Qlogic driver's behavior exactly */
        ip[0] = 0x40;
        ip[1] = 0x20;
        ip[2] = disk->capacity / ( ip[0] * ip[1] );
        if( ip[2] > 1024 ) {
                ip[0] = 0xff;
                ip[1] = 0x3f;
                ip[2] = disk->capacity / ( ip[0] * ip[1] );
                if( ip[2] > 1023 )
                        ip[2] = 1023;
        }
        return 0;
}
---cut here---
Notes: The first three lines of the routine handle <= 1Gb partitions.
Since ip[2] is number of cylinders v.s. the dos call which returns the
largest cylinder, 1024 under Linux will be 1023 under DOS and will fit
in the appropriate API calls.  The code within the first if handles larger
disks.  Normal DOS cannot return cylinder numbers higher than 1023, so the
last if truncates it (notice that I duplicate the 1023 as used by the DOS
driver although 1024 would work).

Advanced DOS BIOSes can go up to 4096 cylinders.  I don't know if any SCSI
drivers allow this.  I also don't know if any DOS drivers only support <1Gb
SCSI disks, so adding the above code to a driver would confuse the DOS
side on such a card.  It is also possible that different drivers have a
different 1Gb or 8Gb cutoff.

Agreed, in general.  But private clubs belong to mailing lists, not

Personally, I really like these keyboards.  They have an extra * key
between Ctrl and Alt which I use an Xmodmap to configure as the X
Super key (extra shift key; X supports Mode_shift, Shift, Alt, Ctrl,
Meta, Super and Hyper, but on PC keyboards generally Alt == Meta),
which I use for all my personal Emacs key bindings.

Has anyone noticed the conspicuous absence of stdarg.h?  Or that there is
a <sys/varargs.h> which tries to include a non-existant <varargs.h>?  This
is true of the 1.0.8 source tree as well as a 1.1.49 tree patched up from

WinNT works well on many multi-processor systems. IBM seems to be on the verge 
of releasing an SMP OS/2, as well. The problem, as I understand it, is that 
there is no firm multi-processor standard yet. The problem with working up an 
SMP or MPX version of Linux would be having to support all of the wierd 
variations of the architecture. Perhaps when manufacturers have a consistent 
standard, multi-processor Linux would be more feasable.

Is this opinion incorrect? Comments?

I've been working on the 2940 driver.....it recognizes the card using

the 2940 and the 2740/2840 that I am not aware of.  The documentation

I get the same overruns with my Colorado Jumbo
(with Linux 1.1.50 on a 386/25).

The difference is that ftape-1.13 is able to recover,
whereas earlier versions of ftape were not, in my experience.

My impression is that it is worse with tar than afio.

Check out September's "Open Computing" p. 83.  The article sort-of

We have five Gateway 2000 P5/90 machines with 32 megs ram, 2 Gig
Segate barracuda SCSI drives, NCR53c825 PCI controllers, NEC
Multispin 3X CD/Rom drives and ATI Mach 64 4 Meg video cards.
Installation was not quite straight forward since everything
was bleeding edge, but, they are very fast. Especially with
the Barracuda drives. We are having some crashes though with 
the 1.1.50 kernel, seems to be related to heavy network traffic.
I do mean heavy. Anyway the machines are great except their 
standard keyboards are very non (101 key) standard. They've 
added things like diagonal cursor keys and one thing that really 
sucks is that you can (very easily) accidentally put the KB in
program/remap mode and totally confuse it and yourself.

No need to reinvent the wheel:

ues4:~/tmp 48> ls /usr/include/stdarg.h
ls: /usr/include/stdarg.h: No such file or directory
ues4:~/tmp 49> cat test.c
#include <stdarg.h>

main()
{
return 0;
}
ues4:~/tmp 50> gcc test.c
ues4:~/tmp 51> 

Mistery! /usr/include/stdarg.h does not exist, but gcc doesn't complain.
Have I just discovered a gcc bug?

NO. At the end of the gcc man page (but who's reading it that far? :-)
you can see:

       /usr/include       standard directory for #include files
       LIBDIR/include     standard gcc directory for #include files

So:

ues4:~/tmp 51> ls /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.5.8/include/
README        stdarg.h      va-clipper.h  va-m88k.h     va-sparc.h
float.h       stddef.h      va-h8300.h    va-mips.h     va-spur.h
limits.h      syslimits.h   va-i860.h     va-pa.h       varargs.h
proto.h       va-alpha.h    va-i960.h     va-pyr.h

Good! gcc is not broken and stdarg.h and varargs.h are not missing.
No need to recreate them.

Yes, they are. But let us see if they are needed in this case:

The main Linux developers have their own channels of communications, mainly
e-mail I suspect. A secondary channel is the linux-activists mailing lists,
which have fairly high S/N. C.o.l.development is a third tier channel for
every one to voice their view regarding Linux development issues. It might
get abused every now an then, like right now, but these are the hazards of
USENET.

All in all, I see no purpose served by a new set of moderated groups.

There are enough superflous newsgroups already, why compound the problem?

The ELF/PIC library may not be in core all the time. The ELF binary
may have to load it everytime it runs. Please re-compile your login
shell with ELF and then re-run the "benchmark." If that is the case,
ELF may be faster :-).

Hold up a minute guys.  I've already posted the fact that a 'private 
club' is inappropriate to USENET (IMO) BUT, your statements are a bit to 
general for my tastes.  There ARE such things as moderated groups, where 
the moderator decides which posts to pass on and which to kill,and they 
ARE very useful things.  Its not censorship as you can always post your 
note to some other group, or start your own alt. or even regular group IF
