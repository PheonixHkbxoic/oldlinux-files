A mico-kernel, is it some kind of mushroom kernel? :-) Seriously, I
don't think so but I may be wrong since I didn't check *all* of the
kernel sources... especially the part dealling with loadable modules
which could use microkernel technologies.

    iv> Is there any plan to make Linux more like a micro-kernel?

No, but there is a plan to *port* it to a mk... Mach in fact. I
haven't posted any announce about it yet but I now have a Hurd
compatible ext2fs server up and running. Some objections come to mind
when I talk of the project of porting Linux to Mach using Hurd as a
development base:

        - Mach 3.0 is slow and big: this will be taken care of in Mach
        4.0 currently developped by Bryan Ford at the University of Utah.

        - Mach is controled by CMU: false. You can modify and
        distribute modified copy of the source code. Moreover, Bryan
        Ford (Mach 4) is open to external criticism/suggestions and is
        a Linuxer anyway.

        - the Hurd is not there yet: true, but it will be here soon.

        - the Hurd is controled by the FSF: false. If at any time the
        Linux community feels that linuxhs (or linurd or whatever the package
        will be called) do not fit their needs, they are free to modify *any*
        part of the sources. Official distributions of the future package
        will not need to have the original unmodified Hurd code in place. Heck,
        that's one of the goals of the GPL.

Take a look at http://step.polymtl.ca/~ldd/ for more info on the
project. BTW, volunteers are welcome.

float = 32 bits [23/8]
double = 64 bits (IEEE standard double)
long double = 80 bits [56/23]

A 16 bit float would offer about as much range and far less precision than
a 32bit fixed point.  

The IA FPU can deal with 32, 64, and 80 bit floats.  Additionaly it 
can handle 32 and 64bit integer math (yes, an 8087 gave me fast 64bit
integer math on my 8088).


The Int/long problem that you are confuseing floating point numbers with 
lies in the lack of explicit definiton of how large a "int" is in C.

"short int" and "long int" are pretty standard, but "int" will be
either 16 bits or 32 bits depending on the mood of the compiler implementor.

Just did this, except I went to 1.1.50 release.  I started with the 1.1.45
tar file, and did the patches 46 through 50 sequentially from the /usr/src
directory.  Then I moved the .c and .h files (I think they were just
blkdev.h, ncp.h, ni52.h and ni52.c) created in /usr/src to the subdirectory
linux/include/linux, then moved entry.S to /usr/src/linux/kernel directory.
Did the standard makes and it booted on the first try!  Did it by modem
too...brave soul I am :)

Take care!

Hello All:

I have two ST-506 HDs, of about 44 meg each.  They've always worked fine
with Linux, but kernels have never been able to identify them as ST-506.
At boot time, the kernel always says "unknown".

(I have another machine where the IDE drive is correctly identified).

I used to think this was because the ST-506 interface was so old that
no-one was particularly bothered about identifying it.  But from the
quoted message above, it appears _something_ in the kernel knows it's
an ST-506....

Can anyone suggest what the trouble might be?  Would anyone be
interested in remedying this?  Should I start reading hd.c?  I am
happy to do whatever would be required.

Thanks,

Mitch.

I thought I was the only person with this problem!  I've also noticed it

Subject: Re: Don't use Linux?!
Date: Sat, 10 Sep 1994 20:14:18 GMT

Rather then waste bandwidth repeating the previous arguments and 
commenting in response, I'm just going to kame a few overall comments.

1) I do agree that Linux is not for the unwashed to administrate, you 
really DO need to know something about UNIX to make this beastie work, as 
the Docs tend to be somewhat sketchy.  This is particularly true on 
low-end hardware.  If you have fast enough hardware, and are willign to 
pay for standard enough stuff (as opposed to a cheapie patched togetehr 
system like i have) at this point installing PnP from yygdrasil is 
probobly about as easy as installign OS/2 or Windows (which isn't sayign 
much), but admin is trickier.

This is natural however, 'cause this is UNIX folks.  UNIX is very 
powerful, and very streamlined, but the pwoer comes at the price of less 
touchy-feely-hand-holding.  I honestly think this laterst version of 
Linux is as easy to adminster as my old 'professional' SCO.  Remember that
this is a real, mature, multi-user system.  None of the others I 
mentioend above are.

2) Getting commercial developers to develop for linux.
Frankly, at the moment the BEST way to encourage this is to continue to 
give Linux away.  Lets get real, for a minute.  it doesnt matter HOW nice 
your OS is if you can't get a large number of installatiosn installed.  I 
DO work for a professional software firm and our primary concern on new 
platforms is how many customers thre will be for the final product.  If 
we believe there will be enough, we develop for it.  (A great exampel is
the Sega Saturn, which we are developing for rigth now even though its 
develoment environment is putrid!)  We have seen how successful $500.00+ 
UNIX systems have been at penetrating (virtually nada.)  Frankly, I 
STRONGLY suspect more new Linux system have been brought up in the past 
quarter then SCO systems in the past year.

3) Quality of software.
Well, I happen to consider quality not to onyl be the province of large 
shops.  Soem of the most groundbreaking, exciting products have come out 
of garages.  To a certain degree a big company is proscribed in how 
foward looking they can be as they have large marketing/sales structures 
to support.  I think we will start to see very exciting products come out 
of peoples garages for Linux in the next year or so.  

4) the WSYWIG issue
I agree with the original author's point here, I'm afraid.  it doesn 
matter how increidbly powerful TeX is, its stil la form of programming 
and is NOT friendly enough for your average business person to use.
BUT how abotu this-- why doesn't someone write acurses-based WSYWIG that 
generates TeX out the back end?  Sure it wont be as powerful as raw TeX, 
but it will make it accessible for all those who just need light word 
procvessing capabilities.  This is gfthe fundemental spirit of UNIX... 
take whats there and jsut add to it the additional functionality you
need.  (Frankly I think there's ALOT of money to be made in this
product alone.  Without the big-boys tro compete with, there is room for 
a midnight-engineer to really make a splash.  Ild do this one myself, but
I'm running Linux at the moment to experiment with enhanced AI which I
hope to bring abck into our games at work.)

My three cents, for what its worth.

Hello,

I have two Linux boxes with kernel 1.1.45.  They are (sometimes) 
connected with PLIP and other times I reboot one and use a switchbox on 
the parallel port to print.  I must reboot because it seems the PLIP 
code, once configured in the kernel, interferes with the printer /lp 
code.  Is there a way to switch between my PLIP connection and my printer 
without rebooting? (just ifconfig'ing it "down" doesn't seem to work.)

: Jon.

Actually the problem goes something like this.  You can indeed define 16
characters/sequences per key.  However, since the kernel code performs a
string lookup for defined sequences, you have to be able to define the strings
for those keys you wish to send out sequences, such as F-keys, with the 
exceptions of arrow keys and keys on the Keypad.  In Linux, you have a total
of 36 strings available.  Several of these are used on specific keys already,
such as home, end, pgup(Prior), pgdn(Next), and so on.  What you are left
with is 26 F-key strings that are definable.  If you define 16 sequences for
F1, then you only have 10 strings left.  In order to define 4 sequences per
F-key on a 101 key keyboard (12 F-keys), then you need at least 48 strings
available.  Linux doesn't have that many.  Furthermore, to get it is a kernel
change.  I have made this change on my system.  Furthermore, I defined my
4 sequences per F-key the same as SCO console so that WP for Unix would
work.  I redefeined my termcap (actually I left the standard termcap entry
and added SCOconsole) and now my console actually works better for me than
it did.  I created a loadkeys mapping that could be used on any system with
the number of strings in the kernel bumped up and would create a keyboard
the same as SCO, as well as another one to put it back into Linux standard
mode.  In other words, the problem is fixed here, and I can use Linux
default or SCO default.  Furthermore, the Linux software I use was written so
that it reads the termcap entry and as such it works fine either way.  Someone
else would have to test the other Linux software and see if they can find any
that is broken by the change.  I know some people want this, but since the
maintainer of loadkeys is getting ready to put out a patch to the kernel that
is nicer than my own, I'm not planning on uploading it anywhere.  If someone
needs this fix NOW, then mail me with a place to send it and I will.

Good guess, but wrong, I'm afraid.  I was working for Philips at AIM in 
Los Angeles during the development of the original CD-I software.  I 
mention this as a way of establishing my credentials for the following 
information:

CD formats are defiend as a set of specifications, each bulding on the 
top of previous ones, much like a network stack or an inheritance tree.  
They are generally referred to by the color of the cover of the official 
release.  They are as follows:

Red Book: The root standard, defines CD-DA (CD-Digital Audio, what most 
cousumers just call 'CDs'.)

Yellow Book: The ISO9660 standard, defines CD-ROM. A full superset of 
the red Book.

Orange Book: (I believe, I'm a little rusty on the color of thsi one), 
CD-ROMXA (eXtended Architecture.)  This is a full superset of the Yellow 
Book, which adds the cocnept of the 'real-time file'.  Included in RTFs 
are a couple of standard ADPCM interleaved audio types and advanced error 
checking. RTFs are ALWAYS in contiguos sectors (not a requireement of 
Yellow Book files) gauranteeing data delivery with-out seek delays.

Green Book: The CD-I spec. Expands on Orange Book by definign a standard 
host computer attached to the XA drive, and additional data types for 
more ADPCM audio compressions varients and video bitmap types.

Gold Book: Photo-CD. Another full superset of the Yellow Book, with 
specific data types defined for hi-res photos. Also includes CD-I type 
ADPCM audio, as well as a pre-defiend directory structure for finding files.

The poitn of all this is that ALL CD-ROM types are fully ISO9660 
compatable. (other than perhapse really wierd propritary formats-- I won't 
even guess what the Atari Jaguar does).

Over in the next thread people were talking about Unicode; why not

16 bits = char
32 bits = short
64 bits = int, long

Of course that would break a lot of things, but such is the price of

The same line appeared every time I booted, exced that the last number
would change.  I found the spot where this gets printk'ed, but I know
nothing more than that.

Please!  If there's anything anyone can do to help, I would really
appreciate it, since I have almost no clue about the networking code
(except what I've read in the NAG and the NET-2-HOWTO).  If there's
any further information you need to figure out what's going on, please
get in touch.  (My kernel version, by the way, is 1.1.49.)

Thank you very much,
Danek

Yes, I don't have a clue why it was done that way.  The following patch
fixes it:

        if (unmask_intr[dev])
                sti();
        if (stat & (BUSY_STAT|ERR_STAT))
!               printk ("hd%c: ST506 interface, %dMB, CHS=%d/%d/%d\n",
!                       dev+'a',hd_info[dev].cyl*hd_info[dev].head*hd_info[dev].sect/2048,hd_info[dev].cyl,hd_info[dev].head,hd_info[dev].sect);
        else {
                insw(HD_DATA, (char *)&id, sizeof(id)/2); /* get ID bytes */
                max_mult[dev] = id.max_multsect;

Once I sent this to Linus, but no response.  IDE drives can tell you
their parameters, whereas for ST506 interface drives, you need to
believe the BIOS, which may be incorrent.  Nevertheless, I like to see
the parameters at booting.
