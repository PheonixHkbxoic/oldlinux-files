Exactly.

A multi-tiered (secondary) storage sol'n:
disk
compressed disk
cd  (if avail)
tape  (if avail)

complications arise w/ cd/tape, because they are removable--you end up
interrupting to tell the operator "Insert [media] volume X..."
But hey--its cheaper than robot mounted tapes, etc.  ;-)

Anyone working on anything like this???

If you have an IBM mainframe to spare, and run MVS on it, you can set
it up to move files to slower discs or to tape if they haven't been
used for a while.  But they remain in the catalogue and are moved back
invisibly when you next use them.

This, IMO, is the sort of thing that is required here.  When you use a
file on the CD, it gets copied to your hard drive.  If you don't use a
file for a week (for example) and it is identical to one on the CD, it
gets deleted.

This is also a good way of implementing compressed file systems -
instead of having the overhead of compression whenever you use a file,
you just compress files that have been unused for a week.  When they
are next used you uncompress them and leave them uncompressed; if they
are unused for a week again, they will get recompressed.

 Yes, but what we need to know is not when the floppy has been
changed, but rather when it is inserted. The DISK CHANGE LINE is set
when the floppy is _removed_ not when it is inserted. It is cleared
when a disk is in the drive _and_ a seek is done. Thus, in order to
detect a disk _insertion_ the drive has to be seeked endlessly. If the
period of the poll is too small, the noise gets annoying, if it is too
long the feature gets useless.

 Hmm, maybe FastBack is already issuing the read/write command before
the disk is inserted? In that case, the floppy disk controller waits
on its own until a disk is inserted before executing the command. This
feature could not be used "as is" in Linux, because only one drive at
a time may be monitored that way, and many machines have several
drives attached to them. Moreover, the drive motor would have to be
spinning while waiting. For a backup program, these limitations are
ok, because it knows where to expect the disk, and because usually the
waiting period is not that long.

Try flashing to the A04 BIOS. There is an issue with the GAT (guaranteed access
time) on the PCI bus that is the likely culprit - the A04 BIOS fixes this. The BIOS is 
available by anonymous FTP to dell1.us.dell.com as \bbsfiles\bios\p90a04.exe.

I think that in SCSI-Howto there was something said about this. If i remember

Please look at SCSI-Howto. There might be more info on this.

Hi folks,

I am looking for SCSI support for Linux for the AMD SCSI chipset.

I have a board here (from Dawicontrol), but I have no informations about the
board and the Dawicontrol hotline was wrong (German telco told me there was no
such number). Is somebody working on that driver or does someone know where
I can get specs ?  I don't really want to disassembler the DOS ASPI drivers.

Linux should start supporting SMP now.
The commerical OS's have already, and they aren't anywhere near as 
good as UNIX or Linux.
We are supposed to be ahead of, not behind commercial operating systems.
Linux is a hacker's OS, and it should be developed as hacker's would, 
trying innovative approaches, not always trying to go with what is stable 
and standardized. If people want that, and Linux they can use the 
non-development kernels, but as for the rest of us, now is a good time 
to start broadening Linux's base. It already has made a powerful impact 
deep into the x86 world, so work in broadening its usefulneess is a good 
idea.

Just like you have to include a special library when you use math

(There are also libraries for gdbm, curses/termcap, bsd compatibility,
X stuff, termnet, ...)

>(the -lm is used for the linking properly <math.h>)

And -lvga (or the other alternatives) is for linking in the svga
library, for when you use stuff from <vga.h> .  You need -lvgagl if
you use <vgagl.h>, too.

This line is used all the time.  DOS will discard the in-memory copies of
disk buffers when it sees a change on this line.
Sometimes you will see machines in which the sequence:

(insert disk)
C> DIR A:
(swap disk)
C> DIR A:

produces two times the same directory output (of the first disk).  This
is because the changeline logic is defective or mis-configured (jumper
on the diskdrive)

This is, of course, the opposite of the situation we were originally
talking about, the same address on two different interfaces.  This one
here is useful for running one machine with multiple names as well.
