No, No.. the DOS-tapes and the Linux-tapes uses a different format,
so you can't.
In fact, the whole Slackware distribution is _ONE_ big tar 'file' on the
tape.
To install Slackware from tape do it like this: Get ftape working with your
SLS system (if it's possible) and copy ALL files from Slackware to your 
Linux partition, including the directories a1, a2 ...
If you can't get ftape working under SLS, do a minimal installation
from the Slackware disks, remember to include tar, and then copy Slackware
to your Linux partition. O.K. you can have the Slackware files on your
DOS partition, if you can access your DOS partition from Linux...

BTW: get the README.ftape (or similar) from the Slackware dist.

More information about the problem.  I can duplicate the problem
in a number of ways, all involving reading the suspect file.  Copying
or checksumming the file contents causes the SCSI driver to lock
up the system.  Although I can telnet to the system and be connected,
but no login prompt ever appears, once the SCSI driver has died.

With linux-1.1.50 I consistently get the error message

scsi0: resetting for second half of retries

When copying the file to another file, 274,432 bytes of 1,398,510
actually get copied.

This file, arthur.wav, was written to this file system using tar.
Accessing the original file, on another machine, doesn't cause that
system to lock up.  The other machine is a Dell 450/ME, running
Linux-1.1.42 with an AHA1742 SCSI adapter and driver.

As long as I don't access the bad file, the system runs error free,
but slowly with a lot of swapping in X-Windows.  I have only 8MBytes
of memory, but will be getting more.

I probably can remove the problem by rebuilding the partition 
containing the bad file.  I assume I'd have to do a surface check
of the disk to make sure the medium is okay.  It just disturbs me
that the driver couldn't fail more gracefully.

O.K. I understand the point of someone, who is living from selling computer
stuff. Because I understood, I said, that normal computer-vendors are not
interested in contributing Linux (or other free software). If I had misunderstood
this fact, I would be angry about this point, but I am not ! I do not
thing that it is necassary for Linux to be sold by "Hochschirm" (Ich denke, Du
weisst, wen ich meine :-) or by other country- or maybe world-wide computer-
sellers. If this is necassary, Linux would not be there, because Linux
was created without any support by big selling-numbers.
I do not agree with the original poster about his point of view, that the
"Linux-Community" had to do something in order to get Linux run on even every PC.
Why?
Linux is now installed on several 100.000 PC's world-wide, so there are more
users than Windows had in its first days :-]
I believe that Unix will never be an OS that is used by a high percentage of
computer-users, as many non-technical-orientated people become computer-users
(think about many firms using even more computers in their administration as
they will ever do in research). Especially think about the low education-level
of most computer-users today. They do not know what this machine is really 
doing. They do not know what a CPU is, what Waitstates are, or why they are
sometimes necassary, or ....... Their main interest is that their little
Windows is running and so they must not know anything about these terms.

An interesting idea ! But there is one thing : You do not buy every 2 months
a new CD so you may get very old telephone-numbers and many people may
become angry about this. So they will not use this service. And :
The manufactures of CD's have a monopoly. They can let you out of a list and
you are out (oder auf gut deutsch : Sie lassen Dich am ausgestreckten Arm

I believe, though, that COBOL and its ilk are still useful.
I have a friend that was using a package written in COBOL --
he swears at it, but uses it.  If COBOL is written for Linux,
he may be able to use Linux when he replaces his SCO Xenix system.
(That's assuming the program's vendor is even interested in porting
his package to Linux...)

I also have written some stuff in COBOL.  It may be wordy, but
it's useful.

I know nothing of the program in question (xweather, was it?), but...

This seems to me a quite dubious piece of code. gestr[0] becomes
gstr[gstart-1]! And the for loop executes glength+1 times. And
gestr[glength] becomes first gstr[gstart+glength-1] and then '\0'.

It might just be that Linux is pickier and notices an error...

Try correcting "for (k = 0; k <= glength; ..." to "for (k = 0; k <
glenth; ..." and "gstr[gstart+k-1]" to "gstr[gstart+k]". And notify the
author of the program about this! :)

Greetings,

I am looking at modifying the IDE hard drive controller
(hd.c) to support some of the enhanced IDE transfer modes
(PIO 3), however I have come across my first issue....

To put the controller into a new PIO mode, you have to issue 
the set features command, with the feature in the 'features' 
register, however I am not sure what the proper port address is
for the features register...

If anybody could point me the right direction, it would be

The file /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Fig includes Fig-color, which is
a symlink to Fig.  Hence a recursive include and the memort eater is
born.  Comment the line out and all should be well.

Anywhere on the net we can find control code specs that define vt420? 
If so, where? That would be a big help, then I and others could start 
hacking it in to the xterm code and the console driver (I personally 
would do the kernel console code, but there are probably some people that 
would do the xterm code)

This is common practice (and, in fact, required by many TCP/IP protocl
stacks).  Whether or not it is "correct" is unclear.  It's quite
possible to implement routing using the same IP address on two
interfaces, if one of them is a point-to-point link (namely,
a slip line).  The idea of every physical network having its own
IP network is ideologically pure.  Ideological purity, while clean
and elegant, is often discarded in favour of optimizations.  Given
the current state of the IP address space, it could easily be argued
that wasting an entire network on a 2-host point-to-point slip line
is incorrect behaviour :)

Keep in mind that BSD is just the most prevalent TCP/IP
implementation, and not the definition of the protocols.

Phelps Dodge, we use the faster Proteon boards.  I would like to find out how
