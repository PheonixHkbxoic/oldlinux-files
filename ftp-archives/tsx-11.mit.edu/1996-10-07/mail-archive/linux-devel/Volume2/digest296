Reply-To: mns1@dalsol.rtc.sc.ti.com

Anyone know what the deal is with these drivers?  There are two
of them (cdu31a.c-standard and cdu31a.c-enhanced) in the dis-
tribution, along with a link (cdu31a.c) that apparently points
to the "enhanced" driver by default.

I just upgraded from Slackware 1.2 to 2.0, and my CD-ROM would
NOT mount until I changed the link to point to the "standard" 
driver.

I seem to be on the air now, but I wonder what the problem was.  
I sent mail to the drivers' author, but he disavowed any know-
ledge of the dual-version configuration.

Oh yeah, I have 486DLC/33, CDU33A, and 8M RAM....

The question being asked does not relate to physical drives, but to
filesystems.

There can be several partitions (certainly more than 4) on a disk. And
include NFS mounts also - the number could easily be more than 32.

My Linux box has 16 filesystems mounted at all times - roughly split half
local and half NFS mounts from the other machine.

You would not be able to "gzip" a file with resource forks and have it
work either. You would have to either A) modify gzip to understand 
resource forks... in which case you could just modify it to understand
directories just as easily. or B) you would have to make the resource forks
be inside just one stream. In which case you don't need to modify the
filesystem at all, you just need to modify the user level tools and such
for storing resource forks inside a single file stream.

>2: There is no way to recognize these directories as complete units.

No matter how you implement this, you'll have to rewrite user level programs
to understand the new system. You might as well just keep the normal 
directory system and just teach user level programs how to deal with them
as "complete units" like you want. So "cp" could be taught how to specially
copy a resource directory instead of how it would normally expect to copy
it. Instead of having to modify "cp" to understand how to read all the
different forks and copy them individually. (which is what would have
to be done anyhow unless you based it on a single stream thing like
mentioned above)

>3: File managers will open them as directory trees, because that is

So you teach the file managers how to open them correctly. Take a look at
NEXTSTEP and the file manager. On next, programs are ".app" directories.
Everything is neat and clean. The file-manager just shows it as a single
"program" and copies it like it's a single program. You can also do 
"Open As Folder" and look at the contents of the "resource directories"
of the program.

If you start adding things like resource forks to the filesystem your
going to have to change around at LEAST as many programs just to make
simple operations work correctly.

Cite a 'today's need' which byte streams don't address.

Actually, I confess -- I'm setting you up and not being strictly fair.
I'm expecting you to say that you want files to be inherently typed,
and then I'm planning to note that all processors do all day is
operate on byte streams and that type means nothing to a CPU; and then
you're going to say yes but this is the 90s and users need better, and
I'm going to note that any scheme which types files is going to suck

grow, shrink, move, merge, defrag, convert

It would be nice to be able to move a partition over by a few cylinders,
shrink or grow it from either direction, and merge two partitions of
the same type.  A fs conversion tool that could convert one fs to another
would be good because it would eliminate the need to have enough space for
both versions.

It works by sending the IDE drive a "SetIdleTimeout" command.  The drive
does all of the spindown timing.  I have a trivial program called 'diskdown'
that lets you set the same drive parameter under Linux.  I've used it on a
bunch of single drive machines without a problem.  Other people have
reported a harmless "hard drive timeout" for disks that are slow to spin up.

My guess is that the Connor drives might have a problem with power saving
features on multiple drives.  It does sound as if it's an unlikely to be
tested combination.

 you could be having problems with the resolver and tcpd, which comes

 You might consider the Plotter widget set, which can be used in any Xt based
 applications (using Athena widget set or Motif widget set). The Plotter widget
 set supports Line graphs and bargraphs.
 
 If you do not want to restructure your program for event-driven x programming,
 you could use wafe (as a front end or library or scripting language) to do 
 this for you. In the Wafe distribution there are several example scripts of 
 how to use the Plotter widgets.

 for Linux of Athena and Motif versions of Wafe can be found at:
