Does linux require that SCSI devices use an IRQ.  The seagate
SCSI driver finds my adapter and drive, but times out. The
interrupt selector is disabled on my card! 

Under DOS the adapter uses no DMA channels, no I/O ports, and no
interrupts. All operations are memory mapped I/O. The system uses
8K of memory space at address CA00h.

I can set the IRQ to 3|5, Chance the Wait state to 0, and modify
the Memory range.

Any Suggestions, is an IRQ required ?

Hi,

I've got a bit of a problem.  I'm trying to read floppies written
with 256 byte sectors.  Looking at the floppy code for 1.1.45, there
doesn't seem to be a coherent strategy for handling different sector
sizes.  In some places it is assumed to be 512 bytes, in others it
is replaced with a #define, which may be either 128 or 512 bytes.

I know that the code is changing quite a lot with other features,
but is there any reason why the facility to handle arbitary (within
the constraints of the FDC) was not included.  I have to admit that
I know absolutely nothing about the PC FDC so I could of course be
trying to achieve the impossible.

If it is feasible, does anybody see any reason why I shouldn't do
it?  I can see that I might run the risk of breaking several IOCTLs
if I try to tack on storage for a sector size indicator to the
existing data structures.

Any comments, cries of don't do it, pleas to do it, indications that
it can't be done, etc, are most welcome.

                Dale.

4.3, in fact.  (may even have been 4.3 Tahoe).  The FFS was one of the
big things 4.3 gave over 4.2.

Just wondering -

How does the performance of Linux  ext2fs compare with that of 
the Berkeley Fast File System (FFS) found in {386,Free,Net}BSD and other
BSD variants?  A number of posts to the 386BSD groups have recently
sneered at ext2fs, presumably because of the considerations FFS makes for
drive geometry and rotational parameters, which  seem to be absent in the
ext2fs source I've examined.   Does anyone have any concrete performance
statistics to back/refute a these claims?  Is anyone workrking on 
FFS for Linux?

I think it's important to keep in perspective that performance 
is only one aspect of the equation.  It may be reasonable to 
compare ext2fs to FFS on this basis, but FFS dates from about
(I think) 4.1 or 4.2 BSD.  I think the issue today is flexibility
as much as it is performance.

Ext2fs supports a limited set of extended attributes (append, immutable,
secure delete, uneraseable, synchronous) and the sources indicate
that ACLs will be available in the future.  But these are all 
kernel space extensions.  You can't associate some arbitrary piece
of data (that stays with the file when copied) with the file without
writing it in the data stream somewhere.  By contrast, HPFS allows
up to 64K of extended attributes per file.  NTFS goes the full 
distance by allowing multiple arbitrary streams per file, although
there doesn't seem to be any documentation on how to exploit this
in the Win32 API manual.

I know this doesn't sound very UNIXy, but how difficult would
it be to implement a filesystem with some sort of arbitrary
extended attributes like those in NTFS or the more limited ones
in HPFS?

Both have their strengths and weaknesses. I would choose bash
however. At my work the rest of my colleagues use ksh.

bash is clearly superior in interactive use: for example nicer
keybindings (you can use arrows with history), easy filename expansion
(ksh's is clumsy) and command completion (ksh lacks this).

ksh has more complicated programming constructs that one might use in
shell-scripts (such as types and arrays). I don't need these however,
because I want either that my shell scripts are bourne-shell
compatible, or if I have to make something more complicated that needs
such extra features I use something more powerful like perl or C.

Well, my Trantor 130B runs fine with IRQ disabled, but it might be a

(I guess that isn't much help, but at least I can tell you its not a

The main problem is that an ftp packet is much larger than, say, a telnet or
ping packet.  Because the ftp packet is large, the packets must be broken up
into sizes that can be sent over the line (this is your MTU at work), thus
the ftp packet takes longer to send.  Additionaly, an ftp connection typically
is doing things in a batch where it is constantly pushing these large packets
onto the queue.  Factor all things in and what you get is a long queue filled
mostly with ftp packets and a few, notably smaller, interactive packets.

Not really.  It is a network problem.  Lars Fenneberg (lf@gimli.comlink.de)
and I are currently working on a package that would balance the load on a
SLIP or PPP dial-up network connection.  Unfortunantly, we are just getting
started and will be a little bit before it is complete.  The implemention at
this time simple slices the bandwidth into equal sections so each connection
has an equal bandwidth.  What we are planning on adding is unequal sharing.
Interactive connections would probably have more of the bandwidth since they
usually transmit in bursts.  The ftp connection would then be slowed during
these bursts and then be back up to speed when nothing else is communicating.
Of course, this kind of unequal sharing will be tunable at runtime.
