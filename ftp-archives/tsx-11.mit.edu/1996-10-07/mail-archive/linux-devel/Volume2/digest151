        Ahem.  Correct terminology is probably necessary here.  A Sun 2 is a
68010-based box, as I recall, which won't eat any 486 alive, even a lowly
SX.  This is particularly odd, because you do refer to the Sun 4
correctly.
        A SparcStation 2, on the other hand, is a fairly nice machine.

        I'm going to stay out of this side of the argument.  I'm unconvinced
that workstation hardware is overpriced, given that you frequently do get
better capabilities than PC-stuff will give you, particularly on I/O.  I am
also not convinced that many people or companies take multi-user-ness into
account when pricing their software.  Researched, cogent arguments for any
of the sides would be welcome.  Flamers should be shot.

I must admit to being a bit confused by Bill McKinney's remarks here,
because I find that f2c does just fine with any Fortran code that
conforms to the ANSI standard.

When f2c does produce results which differ from commercial compilers,
it has always been the case that there is some non-standard assumption
being made by the code (many of these problems being due to the
extensions added by DEC in its early compilers:  assuming unintialized
variables will be zeroed, assuming the linker will pad all common block
references to the same length, assuming all variables are SAVEd, liberal
use of the long-illegal Hollerith to store characters, incorrect ordering
of statements and the other familiar Fortran porting problems).

I know of several respected astrophysicists who do all their Fortran code
development on their Linux laptops, and when it is working they move it
onto their commercial workhorse systems to get results fast.

f2c/gcc works about 2/3 of the time for me. When it does work, I
am not really sure about how efficient the code is, but it runs.

While I don't intend to use my Linux box for large computationally
intensive programs, it would be nice to have f77 (or HPF :) )
available for development. For example, I have several programs
with thousands of lines of code. If I were to modify them, I would
like to do so in Linux: modify some routines, do any debugging,
do some limited testing for small data sets, etc. Once this is
done, I can put the code on a workhorse somewhere else and do
production runs on a large data set there.

The problem is that my original code might not compile under f2c/gcc.
I don't want to spend time "fixing" codes (that have already been working
and optimized) so they'll run under f2c/gcc and allow me to do development
on Linux.

I love Linux and want to use it as much as possible. It has everything
I want, EXCEPT for a true fortran compiler.

I've been reading the AFS FAQ and other reports (available from
grand.central.org:/pub/*) about AFS (formerly the Andrew File System) and
DFS (the DEcorum File System, part of DCE) both of which are commercially
available filesystems which are generally faster, more secure, and easier to
manage than NFS, especially over large networks.

Is anyone working on a filesystem for Linux or another freely available UN*X
which will offer the advantages that these do?

AFS was a project at CMU before it became a commercial product supported by
Transarc.  Would it be feasable to port an earlier version (pre-3.0?) to
Linux?  (Is it freely available?  Would it be compatible with current AFS?
Would one want to use it?)

If not, would it be possible to make a freely available implementation of
AFS or DFS for Linux, without infringing on their current owner's
(Transarc's) rights?  Is there enough information out there?

I would be willing to help develop something like this if there is any
demand.

I thought the LINUX has a feature of its AT&T 386 unix binary compatible.
If that is true, I think there are some FORTRAN or C or C++ compiler
for intel386 AT&T unix that is commercially available which will run
on linux.  Am I wrong? Has anyone running those commercial compilers
on linux?
