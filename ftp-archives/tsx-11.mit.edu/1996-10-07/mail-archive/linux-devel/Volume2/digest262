Subject: Differing console resolutions per virtual console?
Date: 1 Oct 1994 12:45:23 +0100

Someone said a few months back, that they were going to write a program
to allow different console resolutions per vc. Has this ever been
finished? I can't find any code in any of the Linux archive ftp sites.
I might try and work out how this could be written myself.

(This is since I've discovered that my S3 card will support 132x42 by
 altering the kernel, but 132x42 is too small for full-time use)

Thanks,
Jon.

Argh.  It does not work for me. :( I tried it with check_path (as seen
below) and without, and neither one lets me create a file.  In any
case the manual page for smail DOES say to use check_path.  I've
appended my transports file for those interested.  It was created with
Debian GNU/Linux smailconfig.  (note the follow-up)

Subject: Linux killed my floppy drive!
Date: Mon, 3 Oct 1994 09:18:42 GMT


I saw many posts about the Linux floppy drive problems in the past, but I
paid no attention because I almost never use floppies under Linux. Until
yesterday, that is. I put a floppy in the drive and proceeded to copy,
using mwrite, to it. I got plenty of the error message: "disk absent or
changed during operation." I booted into DOS and while the light flashed
during POST, I was surprised to see the machine boot from the hard disk
despite the fact that I forgot to remove the diskette from the drive! 
Under DOS, when I try to list the files on a diskette, the floppy light
blinks and the motor whirrs for a while before I get the infamous DOS
error message: "Abort, retry, fail?". I then recycled power and checked
the BIOS settings to no avail.

Linux 1.1.50 says my floppy drive controller is type 8272A. (The floppy
drive is hanging off an Adaptec 1542B controller).

So, did Linux kill my drive or is this one of those rare coincidences?

I ran into the same thing.  In fact,  myself and another local have

the util-linux-1.10 stuff,  I installed that and had problems with 
login (easy fix though), umount and other misc problems with some of
the programs that I was running. Plus the install program must have
put a ; character in my  /etc/profile  file in the PATH line that messed
up my PATH environment setting (the ; should be a : character).  After
about 2 days I removed the entire  util-linux-1.10 package on 2 computers
here.  I'm running 1.1.50 now with mostly an older version of Slackware
(the one before 2.0) and it runs fine now.   I'd recommend just dumping
that umount program that came with util-linux-1.10 and using the original
one that you had before.

I might be wrong, but I think you're talking about the Apple Personal
LaserWriter SC, which is a QuickDraw rather than PostScript printer.

Hence your biggest problem will not be to get the SCSI connection to
work, but to get your graphics/text data converted into QuickDraw
format before sending it to the printer. If you want to get docs
on the QuickDraw format you'll probably need to pay Apple lots of
$$$ and sign a NDA. Not very attractive to a Linux device driver
hacker...

Please let me know if you get your board to work. I'm fighting with

It took out one of my IDE drives that linux was on and messed up my

Good Luck !

You may not have lost a file, but it won't be because of the sync
inode updates. FFS (as far as I know) does it exactly the wrong way
around. It should sync data before inodes, instead of the reverse... 

Does FFS also do sync dir updates? That would give you the right
files, but they may have junk inside them. (Silently. fsck won't find
it!).

If the broken sync inodes make you feel safer, ext2 will give them to
you. Just supply the relevent mount option. 

Shareing tho is a good point.

This is a good idea, but it limits the loading of a shareable library

Properly speaking (as I understand it) Motif is not a GUI software
package per se, but a style prescription.  Anything that gets you
the look and feel of Motif IS Motif, in this view of things.

Is this view of things dead, in effect?

Is there no other Motif implementation than OSF?

This seems unfortunate.  Especially since I have pretty much
vomited up all the Motif API I ever learned.  Yech.

I've heard vaguely of hacks to Interviews to make it more-or-
less Motif-compliant.  Is this for real?

Date: 2 Oct 1994 03:40:39 GMT

I think I have found a solution (I have typed hundreds of chars so far and it
is still working).

At the end is a patch file for (/usr/src/)linux/net/inet/sock.c that fixes
this one problem.

The *real* problem is in tcp.c where tcp_write uses sock_wmalloc to allocate
socket buffers, but uses kfree_skb (if anything) to deallocate (after an ACK).
The problem is that kfree_skb bypasses the counting mechanism for the number
of bytes, so a count of used bytes keeps going up.  THIS IS ONLY A THEORY,
but I can find no call to sock_wfree except for an error that aborts sending
a packet.  The problem seems to occur with ppp due to timing and the very
small packets (each containing 1 character, but eating 768 bytes), with a
large window size.

You can figure out how to feed the following to patch, or simply edit
sock.c in the wmalloc and wfree routines.  All I do is disable the size
tracking.
