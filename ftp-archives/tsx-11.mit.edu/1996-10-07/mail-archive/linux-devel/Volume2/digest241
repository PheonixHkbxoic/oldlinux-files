Date: Wed, 28 Sep 1994 22:19:00 GMT

I've been talking to Colorado about their dev kit for the Trakker
parallel port tape drive. Not many details yet, but,
assuming they will give out the info is there any technical reason 
that it couldn't be made to work under Linux?

I was very surprised when their tech support said the interface was
NOT proprietary. Norton seemed to think it was a few months ago...

This is easy. It also implies the biggest gain by having this code
exist - in the kernel, or as a loaded driver.

You mount by volume name. Whenever a disk is inserted for the first
time, a mount point is created, eg  /rmv/MSDOS6_0   ie /rmv for
removable media, and then the volume name. The disk can be removed
at any time, but any time the disk is accessed, the console gets
a message to "Please insert disk MSDOS6_0 in any drive". We would
want to intercept this under X and have a window pop up. File accesses
to the floppy would block until the disk was inserted. If disks turn
out to have identical names (MSDOS disks are bad for this), then
either it could be named implicitly, or a serial number recorded as
a hidden file on the disk, and be mounted as /rmv/serialno.

Also a soft link /rmv/fd0 should always point to the currently mounted
floppy; that way, programs can cd to the disk, and end up with a
correct path for the actual volume name.

Subject: C-News cleanup release finds bug in GNU 'join'
Date: 29 Sep 1994 02:13:24 -0400

Thanks to the stress-testing that C-News gives shell utilities, I
found a bug in GNU's 'join' command (from shellutils 1.9).

This affects linux in particular as most people rely on GNU utilities
exclusively.  [Another annoying thing on linux: the standard includes
insist on #define'ing atol(), which breaks the declaration in
c-news/include/libc.h.  This appears to be fixed in the latest alpha
libc for linux, but you'll have to delete the line from the c-news
file, or surround it with #ifndef atol for now]

The bug with join is that the -a option is supposed to:

       -a file-number
              Print a line for each unpairable line in file file-
              number  (either  1 or 2), in addition to the normal
              output.

but in fact, it simply dumped the line from file1 or file2, rather
than outputting the fields in the order demanded by the '-o' option.
Plus, '-a3' is supposed to print unapairables in BOTH files -- at
least on SunOS 4.1, so I added that too.

Here's the diffs against v1.9.

The old OI binaries were compiled with g++ 2.4.5, which is not compatible
with the new one. But the new one couldn't compile it. I was told they
will make a new binary for a working gcc 2.6.x.

With differential scsi, your scsi bus can extend quite a distance.
With SCSI 2 fast wide/SCSI3 I think you are limited to 256 id's and 256 feet
for the scsi bus.

So: given a little change in technology, networking via scsi will make a lot 
of sense.

Its funny how so many people want this feature from AMD. For a very good reason 
(performance mainly) UFS mounts (of which a floopy is one) are made not to 
timeout. As you have the source and it is eaisly compileable I suggest you
look at the file

        amd/ufs_ops.c

around the last few lines there is a bitwise or'ed field in the ufs_ops 
structure saying FS_NOTIMEOUT. Take this out and recompile and UFS mounts
will timeout.

Hello, fellow linuxers!

The kernel 1.1.51 (and before) requires that you explicitly specify read-only
to mount a CD-ROM unit. Isn't this redundant? Shouldn't the default be
read-only, as it was in previous kernels?

Thanx!

Lots of ^M's - are you posting from a DOS machine?
I am not sure precisely what you want - it seems that you already have
all that you ask for.
The Linux console is always in an 8-bit character mode.
It does support colour. You might look at the output of
setterm -foreground xxx -background yyy.

It is possible, yes.  I've heard of it being done before.  It's not
terribly practical though, because the maximum length of a scsi bus
is on the other of 6 meters, which doesn't give you much to work
with...  You've also gotta be careful not to have the two systems
both try to access one drive at the same time.

Actually, I think that is allowed within the SCSI specs..... Same SCSI
bus, with two controllers, one in each host.  I don't know how it is
done, but I'm quite sure I heard that somebody had done it before to
