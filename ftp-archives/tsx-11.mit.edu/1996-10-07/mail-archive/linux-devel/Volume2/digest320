        Why don't you ask your friendly Adaptec company why they won't
        release their specs so a driver can be written for them for 
        FREE?  Don't blame Linux and its developers for the failings
        and short-sightedness of a certain hardware manufacturer.

        Well, that's one solution.  Go out and spend your $5,000.00 to get

One command I sorely miss, especially when things are not

I know this is Sun special, but its a very useful special.
Anybody else miss trace?

Oh, I have studied compiler theory all right.  I have also done quite
a bit of practical programming, and quite frankly you sound like you
need to get out of the theory and smell the coffee, so to speak.  The
theory tells us how to get from point A to point B, not which point
should be point B.

I define an artificial example as one which would involve constructs
that would never occur in actual programming practice (obfuscated C
contest doesn't count).  I hold that a change to the standard that
only invalidates such artificial examples is permissible, since it
will not affect the real goal -- being able to compile programs and
have them do what you intend them to do.

Actually, a code segment selector (which CS has to point to) is quite
different from a data segment selector, so this would not work.  Also,
I would generally assume it would be most convenient to keep CS
zero-based, but I could be wrong, since I am not that well versed in
the details of the current PIC implementation.

I'm not sure about this: I don't think my modem has a transmit
buffer (hehe, try getting information from supra! Argh) and 
I have a laggy interactive response.  I have been in contact
with linux users who have faster modems with no internal buffers
at all who suffer from the same problem.

Fine.  Are you developing the kernel?

If I were developing the kernel I'd get EXTREMELY PISSED OFF when
people post crap like this to newsgroups.  It's FREE, remember.  If
you want guaranteed support, go and buy it from someone.

Surely, various knowledged people who know both systems will follow this
silent agreement not to reply to the questions, but the past shows that
it is mainly the missionary kind of posters who want to pull newbies
into the direction that "their OS" is "the best of all existing worlds
ever seen in the universe" and who do not fear to lie that e.g.
*BSD has no shared libraries yet and needs hundreds of MB to install, or
Linux trashes disks or is instable like DOS (exaggeration intended, 
don't reply to that; we know this is untrue).
These statements were usually those that cause replies and flames from
the other camp.

You can appeal to the serious people (that do exist in both camps)
not to reply, but you can't stop the best-OS crusaders. I don't know
what is better for a newbie: to get an almost neutral comparison in
the form of a FAQ (possibly set up together by the serious people), or a 
warped picture of some OS in the style of a salesman's blurb.

Well, it looks like X/Open has published the final version of SPEC 1170,
and it only costs $250 US for the book and CD-ROM of the spec.  This seems
like something Linux really ought to be compliant with, and it's pretty
cheap.  Should we all chip in and get a copy for Linus?  Or perhaps 
X/Open will donate one for good PR with the Open Systems community?
I'm including a copy of their announcement in case people here didn't

DRAFT PRESS RELEASE FINAL VERSION   10/3/94

SINGLE UNIX SPECIFICATION NOW AVAILABLE


New York; 4th October 1994:  X/Open Company Limited, the independent open 
systems organisation, today announced that the single specification for 
UNIX had been published and is now publicly available.  The specification 
(hitherto known as Spec 1170) has been ratified and agreed by the world's 
largest computer systems vendors under the 'Fast Track' industry review 
process initiated and managed by X/Open.

The process of developing the single UNIX specification was endorsed on 
1st September 1993 by over 75 software and system suppliers.

The publication of the specification completes the transition of UNIX, 
from being a collection of diverse products, into a standard set of 
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) described in a single 
specification.

David Smith, of leading computer industry analyst International Data 
Corp, commented "API specifications such as the single UNIX 
specification, or Spec 1170, are what we have long believed are the right 
level for standardisation and unification to occur in the UNIX market."

The single UNIX specification is now available in book or CD-ROM form 
from X/Open or its world-wide publishing partner Prentice Hall Inc.

The published specification was launched today by X/Open Vice President 
and Chief Technical Officer Mike Lambert.  Speaking at industry trade 
show UNIX Expo, Mr Lambert said, "The publication of the single UNIX 
specification is an important milestone for the open systems industry. 
 >From now on, UNIX will mean the same thing to everybody.  System 
vendors, software developers and users can all focus on making the most 
from a unified market."

For the X/Open User Council, which represents over 80 leading 
implementers of open systems, Chairman Denis Brown (Vice President, PRC 
Inc.) commented, "We welcome the industry initiative to unify the UNIX 
APIs.  Now we are looking forward to the new generation of UNIX products 
appearing on the market."

X/Open is now preparing a set of software testing tools which will 
rigorously check the compliance of operating system products to the 
single UNIX specification.  Systems passing these tests from suppliers 
entering into a trademark license agreement will be awarded the UNIX 
brand by X/Open.  The tests will be available in line with the agreed 
end-of-year delivery date. 
The single UNIX specification delivers benefits for all sections of the 
open systems market.  It enables system vendors to develop and market 
their own implementations of UNIX while continuing to support a single, 
common set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).  Software 
applications developers may now save the cost of producing and supporting 
multiple product versions.  User organisations can save time and cost in 
procuring and maintaining systems by specifying UNIX in their 
procurements.

The specification, which covers system interface definitions, system 
interface and headers, commands and utilities and networking services, is 
priced at $250.00 in book form and on CD-ROM.  The single UNIX 
specification can be obtained by contacting your nearest X/Open office or 
by e-mail request at MoUNTAIntop@xopen.co.uk or from Prentice Hall Inc., 
ISBN 1-85912-054-7.

Last week, IBM made a presentation of the 40P. The price they quoted
for the base configuration was about 7100 CHF and the current exchange
rate is 1 USD = 1.3 CHF.

Subject: Kernel 1.1.54: Error compiling
Date: Mon, 17 Oct 1994 06:48:30 GMT

I have been trying to compile kernel 1.1.54.
I downloaded 1.1.52 complete, and compiled. No problem.

I patched 1.1.53 and 1.1.54 from the / (root) with: 
patch -p < patch53  (and 54)
I did not see any errors during the patch, but it is imposible to read anyway.

Make config: enable all IP stuff, all else as default.
'Make dep' works ok, 'make clean' ok, 

'make' fails in the area: 
tools/build.c , problems with N_MAGIC, ZMAGIC QMAGIC ,  implicit declar; 
undeclared, incomplete type....
Then stuff about: unused variable 'sb'   and   'major_root' may be used 
uninitialized....
Error 1
End of story.

Is it me doing something wrong? I have been patching from 1.1.19 and never had 
any problems until today.  

Any help appreciated.

Thanks,
Bart.

Yes.  If you use ext2fs, there is an attribute available ('s' I think)
which will mark a file for secure deletion.  Check out the man pages
for lsattr (1) and chattr (1).  It goes without saying that this
must be done BEFORE you delete the file.
