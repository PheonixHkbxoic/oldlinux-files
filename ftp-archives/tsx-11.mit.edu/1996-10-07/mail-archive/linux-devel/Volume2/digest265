The Linux community may sneer at synchronous inode updates, but under
BSD ffs I have never lost a file, which is more than I can say for
ext2fs, which has cost me a whole partition at least once, simply
due to its overoptimistic buffering.

In fact, this was the issue that drove me away from Linux (to
NetBSD) for over a year.  I have only recently returned to the Linux
fold since discovering that e2fsck has been dramatically improved.

Even so I am not wholly happy--the "clean" bit sometimes seems to be a
lie.  I have simply taken to running a forced fsck every time I boot,
regardless of the clean bit.

Has anyone ported BSD ffs to Linux?  I would strongly prefer to use
it, simply for the slower but safer synchronous inode and directory
updates.  Not to mention I would like to be able to share files with
my BSD partition...

        We are having a problem with linux "hanging" on out P5 EISA/VLB
machine. (90 mhz) . General symtoms before the hang are non-exsistent as
far as I can tell. One minute it's up , and then boom Dead. No console control
no net access , no cntl-alt-del. It has to be cold booted/ reset. I've read
other posts to this group complaining of similar occurences, and would like to 
help sort it out. Is there any kernel logging/ profiling that can be enabled
so I can log what is going on? Disk space and logging time are NOT a 
problem and I would really like to get to the bottom of this. I saw the kernel
profiling option for the configure but I have no idea how to take advantage of
this option.


Hardware

P5-90

NE2000 ethernet card

AHA 2842 SCSI (also tried a 1542 same problems)

64meg ram

30+meg swap ( also tried no swap)

4 Seagate 1.1 gig drives 

Any and all info appreciated ...

You need an interpreter for your functions.
Here are two possibilities:

1) Try reading:

 "The Unix Programming Environment", by Kernighan and Pike.
It describes how to build, piece by piece, a simple interpreter
for expressions and functions. There are many other 
simple script languages like the one described in this book.
Tcl is similar.  But it is easy to write your own.

2) Download my neural simulator, "NeuronC", at:

   retina.anatomy.upenn.edu:pub/nc.tgz

   This package contains a simple "C"-like language
that you can add to your application.  It contains
lots of math functions, fft, rand, etc., dynamically-allocated
arrays of several dimensions, floating-point and string
variables, local variables, subroutines, etc.

  You can test a stripped-down version of my simulator's
interpreted language by:

   cd nc/src
   make interp

 Then you can run the interpreter and print results,
line by line:

   interp
   ## nc version #3.7 
   print 1/81;
   0.012345679
   print sin(.017);
   0.016999181

 From here it's pretty easy to take the essential source code
files and add them to another application.  See the "makefile".

Have fun,

Rob Smith

Linux has "bdflush" running to save blocks to disk every few seconds.

Well, then our opinion differs.  And most people in this agroup agree
with my opinion, it seems.

ext2fs does not use free lists (it uses bitmaps), so the problem
you picture does not really occur in practice.  (fsck has an easy
job checking the consistency of the bitmaps)

Then please use BSD.

I just encountered a weird problem with umount.  I am using the umount
that comes with the binary distrib of util-linux-1.10 under linux
1.1.51.  When I mount a floppy and move files to it (the filesystem
was ext), and then umount it, is SOMETIMES seg-faults.  Here's the
output from the syslog:

Yes, I have seen this in the Linux projects FAQ.  However, I have not heard
anything like a status report in quite some time.  Is this project still

Hi,

while using dds2tar I found a bug of gnu tar.
With 'tar cfRv /dev/null' and 'tar c | tar vRf -' you will get different
record numbers.

The new dds2tar will include a patch to correct this. (create.c of tar-1.11.2
has to be fixed). A patch to direct the verbose output to a file will also
be included.

I need some days to make the new release dds2tar-2.1.?.tar.gz.
