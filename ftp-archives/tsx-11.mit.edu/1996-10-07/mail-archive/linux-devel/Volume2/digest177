I have a question about named. I used the NAG by Olaf Kirch and
the DNS and BIND book by Albitz and Liu to setup named.

I would like to thank the authors for an excellent peice of work.

I would like to know where the actual cache data used by named is
stored. This is not the cache file specified in the named.boot file.
I just want to be able to look through it and learn how this is
stored and how it works.

any help is appreciated

Has UNIX stopped ? Its been 27 years and it doesn't show any signs of
stopping. Not only that, it has spawned off numerous researches. Linux will be
similar. People are working on making Linux a server over Mach, introducing
threads in the kernel etc. There is also talk of making Linux SMP, porting to
various architectures etc. As new horizons emerge, Linux may be used to reach
those horizons and in that process may lose its resemblance to today's Linux.
But, development will not stop.

For myself and at least one other person, the fix was to upgrade to

Hi People,

Personally, I hate these debates about editors (since I "know" what the
best one is :-)), but here's my 2c worth ...

I've been a VIM (Vi IMitator) fan for about 12 months now.  I just downloaded
version 3.0 and I'm happier than ever.  It now has multiple windows (in
one xterm, console or whatever) and you can cut and paste between them.

It also has on-line help (not that I'd ever use it, of course :-)), multi
level undo/redo, macro recording/playback and a host of other nice features,
like file name completion in command lines and command line editing.  It
also has compiler error message support (you know, it will jump to the
source file and line number the compiler is trying to tell you is rubbish).

I'm sorry, I can't remember where I downloaded it from, but it's bound
to turn up somewhere soon.

Anyhow,  I'd recommend it highly.  My other point is that it looks and
feels like VI to me.  I've never typed a command that worked in VI but
didn't work in VIM.

Oh, VIM also runs on a number of platforms.  I use it on Linux, DOS, HP/UX
and SunOS.  It's nice having exactly the same editor wherever you work (I
believe it runs under VMS, too).

Have fun.

Can I repeat a comment I made in an earlier posting? The time is approaching
where the developers should say "Here's a kernel; here's a system;
(above all) here's adequate documentation for that, and it works". Then
people who want to use Linux for "real work" can build on top of that
in confidence that their efforts will not rapidly become water under the
bridge. From the feel of it, kernel 1.0.8 (which I am using) is not that
far off this stage; the later ones which are around must be even nearer.
  One thing which I regard as an unpromising symptom is the tendency
for Linux application software to depend on ever further extension to the
kernel. I have no objection whatever to the leading edge moving forward
fast, in whatever way the creators wish. Maybe I'm naive, but it seems
to me that the kernel is already pretty full of different stuff, and the
libraries are well stocked; so can't new applications build-in their
own special needs (or at least have this as a compile option) rather
than insist on new gizmos in the kernel/libraries in order to work?
  (I'm not talking about some things that ought to be there already
and ain't, which have to go in - like the -fPIC problem in the GNU
assembler; but this is not strictly a Linux problem anyway).
  A possible alternative would be a much smoother, more friendly,
more reliable, better documented approach to restructuring the kernel.
I.e. basically a core kernel and an assembly kit of whatever you like,
(if you want a driver for your automated greenhouse you can compile it
in; if you PC doesn't have 5-and-qrtr" drive you can pull it out),
which is really non-problematic to operate, and where any new stuff
would be addable-in in the same way all the time. If this happened I'd
say we were at the point where we could all get on with using Linux
as we want to. And not be either obliged to keep up with the changes
nor unable to change if and when we need to.

Just some thoughts in follow-up to the above.

Yes, the GCC people are working on ELF libraries, which should solve the
problems you mention.  Join the linux-GCC mailing list if you want more info.

If Solaris/intel binaries ar iBCS compliant, they should run under linux,
but I do not know if that is the case.  I would suspect that it is.

Note that ftpfs keeps a cache under a separate dir tree, to reduce
ftp traffic. If you find youself running out of diskspace, try 
pruning this cache.

That is quite true.  You have to invoke GCC with different options to
build a shared library, and then you have to select for each symbol
of the lib, whether it should be publically visible, or not.

The advantage is, that by this work, the shared lib gets a very
self-contained module in the end.

But there is a list, and the README's on how to build shared libs also
tell you about the reserved addresses.  Fortunately, an 32-bit address
space is quite large.

>The

>also.

I do not think, it is fragile.  The old implementation (without jump
tables) was indeed fragile, but the current jump table implementation
forces, that these integer indexes remain constaint even after library
updates.

Yes.

Run time patching was introduced with the 4.3 libs to allow true
dynamic linked libraries (DLL): the jump table can be altered by a
program at startup.  That way, functions in the program can override
functions in the library.

If a program does that patching, only the pages of the library, which
were altered (typically only very few) are copied, the rest of the
library is still shared.

For the library user (someone, who compiles a program, and links it
against a lib, or who uses a program linked against a lib, or who
upgrades a lib), name based shared libraries do not have any advantage
over the current jump table based ones.  You can do the very same with
both (except bugs, of course).

However, jump tables link in much faster.  So the mainstream libraries
(libc, X windows, tcl/tk, OpenWindows, Motiv, etc.) should remain
jump table libraries.

On the other hand, adding support for name based shared libs should
make sense for the offstream libs.

Linux is able to link in ELF shared libs into ELF binaries.  These are
name based, as far, as I know.

I have information abotu the problem ,but I'm afraid as far as I know 
there's no joy in mudville tonight.

I own one of these beasties (Orchid ships them under their label).  I've 
used it under MS-DOS and OS/2 and learned a few things about them.  The 
basic problem is that, while the hardware interface is standard sony, 
apparently the software interface is not identical. Under MS-DOS, for 
example, I could use an SB-AWE16 as the interface, if I used the WEARNES 
driver, but the standard SB sony driver would fail.

Similarly under OS/2 i coudl still use my SB, but I need a special 
Wearnes driver, the standard OS/2 sony driver woudl not work.

Since its a software protocol type thing, it probobly would not be too 
hard to modify the existing sonycd_31a driver, if you coudl get the 
necessary info out of Wearnes.  I just gave up and bought myself a cheap 
sony CDU-33a, which works fine with the 31a driver. (Around here you can 
get a 33a in a media-vision package for about $130.00).

I have it in the abck of my mind to some day write a driver for my other 
drive, but right now its on the bottom of my priority list.

Sorry I don't have better news.
