On a list of context switch times for different operating systems
I noticed that Linux is not too different (only 2.5 times slower)
from QNX - a micro-kernel O/S.

Does Linux use a micro-kernel?

If not, does it use any mico-kernel-type techniques?

Is there any plan to make Linux more like a micro-kernel?

Any thoughts appreciated, Ian.

Nothing you are doing would prevent you from using INN as your

I mean it could be hacked in with minimal changes.  There is exactly
one place in the code where an article is written to disk.  There
is exactly one place in the code where an article is read from the

How do you define the "natural wordsize" nowadays?  The size of the
internal registers?  The width of the data bus to the RAM?  The width
of the bus to the cache?

What is the natural word size of the 68000?  Or the 8088?  Or a

If a program issues an open for comp/os/linux/development/22334 the file

Since history databases merely record the existence of a message with
a given message id and NOV merely gives quick access to headers,
a more efficient news file system should be able to provide that
stuff directly from the message headers and still give good performance.
Of course, you could keep on using the old history and NOV
files too if you wanted to.

I think that if you want performance, you need to forget SQL and
work at the lower level of data and index similar to dBase files.

Ugghh! I hate SQL. But the idea of building an INN that uses a 
well defined database API to access news and control files
makes a lot of sense. Then people can graft on whatever database
they like. I've even heard of a company that is using an Oracle
database instead of /etc/passwd.

If you added new file in (new-directory) , add --new-file to the

I guess the issue is this.  If you expect to find 97 in an 8-bit pack-
age, you don't want to designate this via 'a'.  Again, this all depends
on whether the kernel will ever set its locale to anything implying a
non-ISO 8859-1 charset.  If the kernel will always be compiled with the
same charset, we're fine.  Is this a valid assumption, however?

>The toupper() and tolower() macros are IMHO broken.

The trouble is that the kernel can't just access the C library.  Is it
worth including separate utilities that are essentially equivalent to
the C library routines?  I don't know.  I can see how the answer might
be "no" now, but "yes" later.  As long as hackers who go into the code
know that the toupper/tolower (and many other sections of the kernel)
are not internationalized, and can locate these readily, it would seem
fine to leave them in as they are.

Too bad Linus is in Australia; I'd really like to know what he says
about all of this.

Then you just need to setup IP routing on your Novell server.
It is described in the red books.  It is like:

load tcpip
bind ip to card addr=a.b.c.d gateway=e.f.g.h mask=mm.nn.oo.pp

do this for all cards you want to run IP on, and the server will route
the packets.

Sure, PhotoCDs are in ISO9660 format. You may have to put the drive into
a special mode though to read the CD-ROM/XA standard that photo-CDs are
written in (blocks have some extra bytes), to make the CD-ROM appear
to be in the standard block format. I have no clue what that would
be on the mitsumi. I have programs to do that for Toshiba drives.

Then I can just mount them with the iso9660 file system..

A while ago, some kind soul posted a C program which automatically
calculates modeDB entries based on dot-clock frequency and 
horizontal sync frequency.

I cannot take any credit for this program, which is based on
information from the Videomodes.doc provided with XFree.
I also cannot take any credit (or be held responsible)
if use of this program causes damage to your equipment.
Use at your own risk. (*sigh*).

It did, however, allow me to find a 320x240 video mode I can 
use to play DOOM on my SONY CPD-1304 *Multiscan* monitor.

After you cut the source from this article, and compile
it, you can get a 320x240 mode with:

xmode -dcf 12 -hsf 29.5

refresh rate for this mode: 28.26Hz
percent of hfl used:        75.37%
mode-name  dcf   hres hspstart hspend hfl  vres vspstart vspend vfl
320x240    12    320  352      392    424  240  243      247    252

I had to add some values to the vertical timing to correct
some weird linearity problem on my monitor (top horiz lines spaced wider...)
Of course this refresh rate is really low, (although it looks fine to me )
I was able to sync to higher rates, but the size was off, so I just 
dropped the dot clock, until I had a mode I didn't have to manually
enlarge.

Notice that 320x200 is not a 4:3 aspect ratio.  You can probably
edit xmode.c to give a 320x200 aspect, but I like a little border,
so 320x240 works for me.

ok, so maybe it's bad form to answer my own question, but i'm going to anyway.
since i posted the question, i decided it couldn't be that hard to write such a
utility, and i turned out to be correct.  it was really easy, in fact, which is
why it surprises me that no such utility is included with the linux
distribution (at least, not with slackware 2.0, which is what i used).

anyway, the following utility takes as input values for your dot clock and
horizontal sync frequency and an optional horizontal sync pulse length, and
gives you back a line of numbers you can stick in your Xconfig file.  read the
header comment for details:

/*------------------------------8< cut here 8< ------------------------------*/
/* XFree86 video mode timing generator for Linux.  use this to create video

both of the above are actual results i got on my machine, and both were
functional video modes.  the 1200x900 was too flickery to be usable, however,
which is why the less than 60Hz refresh rate warning is in there.

And later:

: Is this fixed in a later patch ?

First a silly question: why don't you get the latest kernel and find out???

Second: why cross post to .help and .admin ?  ( I posted this to 'help' and 
'development' because this message is applicable to both ).  Cross posting
'help' questions doesn't do anyone any good.

And now a message to everyone:

It should always be realised that the 1.1 kernels are ALPHA, and changing
extremely rapidly  (except for now that there are aims to a 1.2 release).
The 1.1.18 kernel is 32 releases old now!  Many problems that existed in those
kernels have been fixed.

The first stage in reporting problems in ALPHA kernels is to get a relatively
new version.  Preferably the latest :-)  Then you determine if the problem
still exists.  THEN you ask for help.

Going the other way - posting without getting the latest ALPHA - merely
generates needless traffic in these groups.
