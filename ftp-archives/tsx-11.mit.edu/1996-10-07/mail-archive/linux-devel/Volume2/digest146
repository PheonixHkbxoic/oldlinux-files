Fortran code compiled by f2c+gcc can be debugged using gdb. Simply
transform/compile with -g and set the first break point to MAIN__.
(If you use f77 script that comes with Slackware (and maybe some
other distributions), make sure you either remove the section that
transfers the code to f2ctmp_<filename>.f and compiles it, or
at least comment out the line that removes f2ctmp_<filename>.f if
you want to debug.)

I can see how you could do a compressed file system optimized for news
articles. You could save space very easily, and maybe not take too much
of a performance hit with the compression.

But I do not see how this would help the bigger picture news performance
issues of:

        1) eliminate/minimize directory traversal for article access
        (opens?). 

        2) combine history and NOV type functionality, and move it out of
        the filesystem (maybe into the database). Think of how databases
        work. We have redundant "indexes" with the current scheme. (the
        current scheme works well, mind you, but I think a paradigm
        shift is needed to make much more inprovement. Something other
        than newer dbz's)

        3) Further optimizing expires, which should come from #2.

        4) Maybe data is "stacked" on the media based on expected expire
        time. Short timer's near the "end" of the list/stack, long timers fill
        holes near the "head". articles that stay around longer I would
        guess get accessed more. Popular groups get preferred status,
        based on number of accesses. (Learn from the Mckusic filesystem,
        how it avoids fragmentation, and optimizes access time)
        
Now add some wishlist features:

        5) fast indexed search function for string/topic/author/site.
        (Look how CD ROM searches work.) We add new NNTP cmds to allow
        this function from newsreaders, not an external program. With a
        total index, hyper links are much easier. If you move to a
        dictionary/token approach, you should be able to do this for
        free. (Total index)

        6) Provide for dynamic "scoring" of articles/groups based on
        access time. Groups with higher scores stay around longers.
        Make expires totally dynamic, but allow for override's to the 
        scoring.

And of course it must:

        7) Dovetail into INN at the library call level. (No rewrite
        needed, just new modules.)

        8) Not use proprietary DB's. IE: free (This may be tough)
        (Could someone write a portable, decent performance, SQL DB
        and post it?) :-)

        9) Be portable at the system call level. (No driver's needed)

        10) Have complete tools available for:
                o DB unload
                o DB backup
                o DB repair (index repair, rebuild the links, etc)
                o DB size changes (add new chunks of disk space)
                o Brute force emergency expire (If we do items 1-6, we
                should not need this one.) 

Hmm, I was the one concerned about a DB type approach, but I see a DB
as the best chance of doing the above. I feel sure that an approach like
this is doable with even commercial SQL technology.  

I ran the current spool/history/nov scheme past one of our DB labbies, and 
he cringed! We sketched out one schema that would accomplish most of the 
above items. He was intruiged the concept of dbz, left with source, and 
promises to think about it a news schema.) :-) For a large commercial 
site, it might make sense to consider such a scheme even without the exotic 
wishlist items.

Anyway, now I like the idea of a real DB. The logical design will be the
key, and needs to be flexible enough to be able to add new features.

back to the scratch pad! :-)

I think you could combine something like LZ dictionaries with my "total" 
keyword index in the DB scheme I described in an earlier post.

You have a table with two columns. One has the string, the other the
pointer to an article ID/location. (You may have to have a 3rd column with the
token for each word if you want to tokenize for compression)

This table has a fixed size, and functions like a cache. Words used
often hang around, and ones that do not fall off.

You could do global keyword searches on, say, the 50,000 most  common
words in usenet articles. These "most common" words are the best
candidates for "tokenizing", or "pointerizing". Per my pet DB labbie,
such a table with 50,000 entries is trivial with modern DB strategies.

So we kill two birds with one stone. Gain compression via
token/dictionaries, and a "top 50k keyword" grep capability.

I can envision how I would use this. In addition to reading news groups
(with kill files and such), I might first hit the keyword index for
articles with the word(s). It is then presented in a meta group like
nngrep will do. This would be handy. If it is not useful to you, just
make your table small. (And vice versa)

Another concept my labbie brought up is multiple tables. Short tables
(Fast access) for common words/phrases . Longer tables (slower access)
for the oddball ones. (small number of occurences, many unique entries)
Words can expire from one table to another based on usage. The fastest
DB's do this now transparantly.

But back to my original objection, can we move to technology like this 
without having to become DB admins? I do think large gateway style
commercial sites could justify the migration.

Just some ideas!

I have the ATI Graphics Xpression (VLB) which has the Mach64 chipset

Don't know if there is anyone working on an accelerated server,
maybe someone else can answer that question...

I see this too in 1.1.4x (for x=43,45,..) and 1.1.49. Just installed 1.1.50.
This problem has kept me at 1.0.9 until now.

For me it starts with:

Couldn't get a free page.....
IP: queue_glue: no memory for gluing queue 0x609318
IP: queue_glue: no memory for gluing queue 0x1237418
...

IP: queue_glue: no memory for gluing queue 0x1237158
NFS max timeout reached on cichlid
...
Couldn't get a free page.....
nfs_statfs: statfs error = 5
...

Then after about 5 minutes it comes back and all the nfs directories
are available again.

Any guesses?

Thanks very much
Andy

PS. I've kept the same rpc.nfsd from 1.0.9 (slackware 1.2). Does this
(and other /usr/sbin/rpc.* programs) need to be upgraded?

Didn't see anything in the kernel README :-)

[flawed pentium prices deleted]

I have a 66Mhz pentium system, with 40 megs of ram, 28.8. modem,
420 meg HD, Soundblaster-16, 14 inch monitor, accelerated video card
w/2megs of memory and up to 1280x1024 resolution, all for about
$3500-3700.  This machine outperforms the 150Mhz AlphaPC that sits right
next to it.  (BTW - the machine runs quite nicely with only 8 megs of
ram as well, so you could probably knock about 600-1000 off of the price).

BTW - it runs linux like a dream - my only wish is that I could get
the damn floppy working (perhaps in a newer kernal it does, i have 1.0.8),
but then again, I don't need the floppy from linux.

        DOOM for Linux, why else?  ;-)

        Hmm.

        I suppose you speak in ignorance. :)  It's out, and
available from sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/Incoming and at
dewdrop.water.ca.gov in /pub/doom as the file lnxdoom.tgz

Enjoy folks!  *grin*

        Well, a couple of things... I've tried it in pixel doubling
mode, and not only is it slower, but the display is broken.  It looks
like you are looking through one of those windows with glass ribs.
Also... if you should happen to be one of those that actually play
games at work, you might want to know that Ctrl-Alt-+ and Ctrl-Alt--
change X11 resolutions on the fly at the Linux console. :)

        So.... 320x200 resolution anyone? :)
I'll post if I figure out how to do it.

Thanks,
