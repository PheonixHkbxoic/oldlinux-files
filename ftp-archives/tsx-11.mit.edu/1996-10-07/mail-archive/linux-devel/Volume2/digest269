Ah, ha, this sort of message is the equivalent of lighting the blue
touch paper and taking 2 steps back :-) 

Which GUI to use is now becoming a religeous issue of the same size as
C v Pascal was five years ago.

Everybody is going to say use <xxx> (where <xxx> is their favourite
GUI) for <yyy> (where <yyy> is a (possible) reason for using it).

Your choice (and it is yours) depends on several factors:-

1) any experience of any GUI.
2) intended customer base
3) programming language


1) if you have used Motif/Windoze/OpenLook before then stick with it.

2) initially you, but then what, is it the sort of program that would
be used across multiple architectures (be honest). The more machines
it runs on the more standard you are going to have to be. If you are
hoping to get in into big sites (with commercial Unix), then Motif
isn't really a problem, it is however for all us linux people ('cept
me) but you can ship a static binary..

3) are you using C or C++, if C++ then why not make use of a class
library that supports both Motif and athena transparently. If you
don't mind not talking to widgets directly then why not use a generic
API, like (ah my minds gone blank...).
 

Thats the advantage of democracy, you have a choice, Motif or
something a load of rubbish :-)

Anyone who doesn't mind testing out a small patch to fix TOS
queuing (probably only noticable under SLIP, PPP, etc):  send me some
mail at jrichard@cs.uml.edu and I'll send you the patch.

It makes ftp-ing huge files and telneting at the same time bareable 
if the MTU is set to about 296.  However, it is still pretty ALPHA
and not tested much... but I'm using it now and I can barely tell
I'm ftp-ing linux-0.01.tar.Z. :)

Subject: 1.6Mb floppies under Linux?
Date: Thu, 6 Oct 1994 03:43:26 GMT

For years I have used a DOS program called smax, which formats
floppies to 1.6Mb on a 1.44Mb drive, (and similar increases on the
other 3 drive types). The documentation with that prog. said that
DOS disks had 10 sectors per track, but that DOS, for whatever
reason, only used 9 of them, and so the prog. simply told the
drive to use all 10. A little TSR was also involved. I have
used hundreds of these disks with no problems. Now, Linux won't
read them, because of the assumptions in the floppy devices under
/dev. 

My question: where are the 'sources' for the /dev floppy drives?
Do they need recompilation of the kernel in order to add new
drive types? It would be nice if Linux gave everyone 1.6Mb drives,
the difference is very useful indeed.

Actually, I think I came up with a different solution of my own.
As I started doing more and more investigations, I found that the
interactive SLIP delay during heavy ftp transfers was about 3 seconds.
John sent me a patch to try to solve the problem, and it reduced the
problem a bit, but not by much.  I eventually figured out what I 
think might be the problem.

My modem is a US Robotics Sportster 14.4 modem.  The modem has a 
built in transmit data buffer of 3.25 Kbytes, and a receive data buffer
of 2 Kbytes.  I believe it is this buffer which is killing my 
interactive response during large transfers.

The transmit data buffer can be reduced to 1.5 Kbytes by turning off
error correction, however, that's not somthing I want to do.  Does
anyone know how to turn off/down the buffer size?  I've tried going
through the manuals, to no avail.

In my rush to blaim the kernel for my problems, I completely forgot
to look at my own hardware.  Forgive me.    :)

Thank you to everyone who helped.

Read the document that you get mailed to you when yoi do something wrong.
It explains how to get a list of channels a specified user is on.  Call
that function with a certain string that is likely to be in your mail address
after all the mishandling (e.g. your login-name).

That will return you the list of channels and the full address the darned
thing expects to see in the From: header for you to unsubscribe.  But when
you cannot re-produce that address for whatever reason you are out of luck...

It doesn't, and I don't think it will do it any time soon.

However, most dos extenders (I don't know Phar Lap) are also willing to
live with one of the protected mode interfaces, like DPMI.  This is
currently being worked on in dosemu.
(incomplete DPMI support already exists, people are debugging and extending
it)

This is a known problem (at least to me and my group at work) with all
compressing-and-error-correcting modems.
For a project we are doing, we have decided we don't want any compression
and error correction in the modems, it has to be done in the routers.
We operate the modems in HDLC mode, and the resulting buffer is very
small.  (it depends on the type of modem, but it could be as small as 12 bits)
This results in a big improvement in interactive response while file
transfers are running.

(the project is about routing LAN traffic over PPP links, but the problems
are essentially the same as what you are discussing)

I tried to join the DOSEMU tract of linux-activists, but I'm not convinced its working
(I did a join, never received a response or any messages).

Is there anything coming over the tract?

Anyway, I'm running 1.1.19 and dosemu53pre22
1) I need to do a kill -9 to terminate it as root
when its hung.
Shouldn't I be able to do something else (like kill -QUIT).

2)  I'm not sure I like the idea of if stderr == stdout,
redirecting stderr to /dev/null.  I think it may make more
sense and be easier to use to do stderr to mktmpfile.
For example, I had to run it under strace to realize it was
reading my .dosrc file but not the /etc/dosmeu.conf file...
and I got:
pen("/u/marty/.dosrc", O_RDONLY)       = 5
brk(0x11d000)                           = 0x11d000

It would be nice if something was announced by default, instead
of redirecting stderr to something other than stdout...
Also,   2 reads at EOF, followed by an IOCTL, so
I don't really understand what's going on.
It doesn't look right.

3) How do I run the emulator in an xterm without curses?
If I just want straight tty emulation (to capture to a logfile), I don't want
the curses characters mixed in.
The best I can do is run script on dos and it appears to be right.

4) I'm usign Ian Stewartson's msh...when I use the 32 bit shell
with the Rational systems extender, it exited the program quietly (probably
because stderr=stdout)

5) I really don't understand why the architecture is as is...

i.e. dos is a small program which loads a shared library...
Why not make one executable...
(this is what I ended up doing)
Also all the subdirectories use ld instead of just generating objects
or libraries to get linked in...

When you call make, always call $(MAKE) so make -n works right...

The make architecture is somewhat cumbersome...i.e. make most tries
to do a make install and a make dep...

It would be much easier if make did a make without acking any questions
(this won't run from nohup) and a "make most"
        would do 
                most:   dep $(TARGETS)
make install should be a seperate step, I don't run make install as
root and if I need to setuid executables, I do it by hand.

Also, it doesn't easily pass down CFLAGS... I ended up doing
make CC='gcc -g'
to get debugging turned on.

6) I'm running a 1.1.19 kernel.
I had to make these changes:
in dpmi.c, seg_not_present isn't there and isn't needed...
I'm not even using dpmi yet, so it doesn't make a difference...

I can't even make the sillyint stuff, so I didn't (took out sig 
in the master Makefile).

I didn't read the sig/Howto carefully, but I saw 1.1.45 and
I'm not sure if its important or not...

7) Look at automatically generating the dependicies...
gnu make has a section on this in the manual...each .c file
produces a .d file... so you see it instead of .depend...

8) You have a strategy of :
# Set X_SUPPORT to 0 if you don't have X windows installed.

This doesn't work, since
ifdef 
in make is true if X_SUPPORT is defined...

I had problems with the X_SUPPORT, so I took it out for now...

9) It seems the -F file options didn't work...

I reworked the parser.  I also find using  FILE  volatile *fd
was a confusing thing...it doesn't seem necessary to be
volatile, and fd normally means an fd...

Here's my changes:

10) I see some instances of exit(-1).  What this does it 
the same as exit(0xff).  Probably is better to just do exit(EXIT_FAILURE)
or exit(1).


I'm very impressed by it so far...
