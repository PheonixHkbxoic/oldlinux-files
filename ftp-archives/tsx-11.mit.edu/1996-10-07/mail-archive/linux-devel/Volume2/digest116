But none of these standards is truly multilingual, except for Unicode/
ISO 10646.  So the obvious answer is to standardize on these, and to for-
get about all of the conflicting local standards.  There is no way that an
OS can support a myriad of incompatible schemes, and no way it should.  So
you are right that I'm missing the point.  But you've missed the point that
my missing the point is the point :-).

FIRST OF ALL (I don't mean to shout), let's get straight one thing:  Mule
is not fully internationalized.  It supports a few Asian scripts, and that
is it.  This is great, but let's not tout this as any sort of system-wide
solution.  It sounds, in fact, as though it might be the exact wrong ap-
proach, although I have only read the docs within the last few days, and
cannot make any blanket statements.

SECONDLY, let's consider what it means to "support" multiple languages.  On
the lowest level, it means simply that the operating system and its core
drivers permit the use of character representations that may be wider than
8 bits.  After this there are several more issues to consider.  The first
is input methods:  Do the keyboard drivers work with the operating system
in such a way that one can, on the fly, change one's keymap?  Does it sup-
port contextual code changes (e.g. Arabic letters will differ depending on
their position relative to other letters)?  Finally, do the display drivers
and GUIs support multiple wordwrap directions?  And are their conventions
for storing messages, text, etc. as separate "resources" so that one can
switch from one set to another for localization purposes?

The idea of switching code pages (DOS/OS2-ish) or doing setlocale calls,
as one finds with ANSI C is antithetical to certain aspects of the Uni-
code/ISO 10646 design philosophy, in the sense that this philosophy en-
compasses all national scripts, rather than forces us to toggle between
incompatible standards.  Some toggling will always be needed, of course.
But the toggling, I'd think, would be between pages in the Unicode and
ISO 10646 space.

Now to your final question:  Is any OS fully internationalized?  Well, it
depends on what level you're talking.  NT uses Unicode internally.  UTS-8
is a standard for encoding multi-byte characters in a traditional 8-bit
system, so potentially any Unix system could, to some extent, follow suit.
As for the GUI, the Mac has WorldScript.  If you follow certain coding
standards, WorldScript allows one to write along merrily in English, then
switch to Greek, or even Arabic or Hebrew, and continue writing merrily
along (with the directionality and wordwrap and keyboard changing on the
fly).  I've been doing the same thing, happily, under DOS using Multi-
Lingual Scholar (Gamma Productions).  Also I hear news that the next ver-
of Motif will have the multidirectional wordwrap code enabled.

So things are improving.  What can we do here under Linux?  I really can't
say.  I just don't think that the old idea of multiple conflicting schemes
represents a workable form of internationalization.  Nor does hacking this
or that software to do this or that language.

Am I babbling nonsense, or am I making sense?

That's not a bug, that's a feature. Mounting or opening a write-protected
medium in read-write mode doesn't make sense. Therefore the kernel won't
allow it (not any more, anyway).

Open / mount the thing read-only and it'll work.

Hello,

Could someone 'in the know' tell me if AM53C94JC scsi chip is
supported?  I'm looking into installing Linux on an ICL Ergo D4/66dXGi
machine, which has the above mentioned scsi chip on mainboard, along
with ATI Mach 32 and Fujitsu 86965 ethernet chip.
Is NCR53c7,8xx is a close enough relative to AM53C94JC?
 
Thanks,

Not so. The lp driver polls by default, but can be made to use IRQs
with tunelp(8). But usually there are plenty free channels left in
the IRQ 8-12 region.

Alternatively, if you have to use an IRQ between 8-12, there
probably won't be a suitable jumper. In that case, a bit of wire, a
soldering iron, knowledge of the ISA bus pin layout and perhaps a
sharp knife will do the trick. (I used this method to have /dev/cua0
use IRQ5 instead of 4 because I hadn't thought of wire-wrapping the
jumpers ;-)

I have a Compaq Deskpro 486/33M, which is an EISA bus machine with the
processor on a card. The machine has 20M of RAM, which is happily seen
by the power-on test, the EISA diagnostics/setup disk and
DOS. Unfortunately, neither the 1.0.8 nor the 1.1.49 kernels see more
than 8Mb of this memory. Does anyone have any ideas why this might be?
I compiled the kernels with the "limit memory to low 16Mb" option set
to no. For reference, the machine also contains a WD80x3 Ethernet
board and an ATI GUP video board. Could the fact that the GUP is
mapping its frame buffer into the address space be a problem? (but
then, it should also be on another machine, a Dell EISA with 32Mb and
a GUP: the kernel happily sees all the memory on that machine).

I did that a few times before, but I never found what I really needed...
There is one program that processes raw clock data, but it draws a
full-screen clock and needs manual interaction to set the system clock
from that.  It also just warps the time.  Not really what I want.

Other programs use "processed" data from expensive clocks that send the
time as some ascii string.  I don't have such clock.

Then there is XNTP, but it is much too complicated for me (network
oriented, I just want to sync a single machine).  And the DCF77 module
in there also doesn't act on raw data, I think.

Do you know about a program that runs as a daemon, uses adjtime, and
processes raw data?  (e.g. on a COM port set to 50 bps)

'DOS-floats' don't exist, but 
floats in BC are 4 , doubles are 8 or 10 bytes long. The exact format can
be found in the manuals, but unfortunately i have no idea what the exact
format is of Gcc/linux floats so i can't help out there.

I myself abandoned the the idea of using any binary representation of
floats in portable code and reverted to using a plain ascii representation
throughout. Ok, it's a bit bulkier (but those files compress easily) but
using printf/scanf or whatever works everywhere  and written out data has
the advantage of being readable by me ( a mere human ) and nice programs
like 'gawk' etc.

Have a look at SYS V systems...  They use a separate filesystem for

No, this is done only once when configuring LILO.  From then on, all
kernels will be mapped simply by running the installer.

That will really shine on an ext2 partition!

No, I still think the LILO method is a good idea.

On my 486/33 with SCSI disk on a 1542B, compilations are completely
CPU bound.  However, I normally get a load average of 1 on kernel
compilations.

Note that the load average in Linux is "wrong" when compared to traditional
UNIX systems.  Normally it counts the processes that are ready to run,
but Linux also includes the processes that are "swapping" or are in
an "uninterruptible sleep".  This was introduced at some time to make
the "load average" reflect the "feel of system load", but I don't think
it is a good thing.

About IDE multiple-sector: the rate of a "dd" off the disk doubles when
setting 8-sector transfer on the Quantum disk in my machine at work.
I did not time the difference in compilation speed, but again it will
probably not make so much difference.

That's a matter of personal opinion.  Take for example the recient fiasco

It was signed Steve Winters (and Steve is a well known 'hardcore'
