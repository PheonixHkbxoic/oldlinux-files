Subject: Problems compiling with gnu CPP
Date: Wed, 5 Oct 1994 10:59:23 GMT

Has anyone had problems compiling files that include both stdio.h and
iostream.h using gcc 2.5.8? If I try it tells me that two functions
are being redefined:

        __underflow and __overflow

These are defined in both libio.h (included by stdio.h) and
streambuf.h (included by iostream.h). Both have a different parameters
so that would be ok in C++ as they would be overloaded BUT they
are defined as extern "C" ... so the compiler thinks they are the same
function. This is a problem as some of the software I have includes these
two files and hence they won't compile.

I also have problems compiling the files generated by uib (the ParcPlace
interface builder). This throws out the same errors (functions attempting
to be redefined illegally) but this time I can see no problem as they
are not extern "C" functions and have different parameters and so
should be overloaded perfectly legally.

Has anyone else had these problems?

I would not recomend pipes for syncronization as you (at least I) runs out
of fd's pretty fast whereas semaphores usally support 64K or in that range.

Also there may be speed differences, I havn't tried it with Linux
(actually my Linux is down as my st01 controller looses info and corrupts
the fs, I'll bye a desent SCSI later - but if you have a posible solution
please let me know) but on my HP735 (well not my own but ...) I get
15K context switches using pipes and 26K using semaphores. If anybody would
do the test on a desent Linux box mail me and I'll send the source 
(_very_ small).

Indeed; and interactive use is the most important for a shell.  When
it comes to 'advanced' programming features: stick to the good old
bourne shell so that your scripts will run everywhere. If you really
need more advanced facilities then you'd better use a 'real'
programming language (such as perl or C etc.).

Yes.

No.  Are you going to run a driver that some bozo wrote, that you

   If anyone has had direct contact with Xircom and can point me to a

Why bother?  They've been unhelpful for years.  I've spoken to the

Anyone got any wise words?  I'd like to write a fs for Linux, partly for
the experience, and partly because I think a compressing fs would be a
Good Thing.  I've looked at the KHG, but it doesn't seem to say anything

I could always read the source for one of the standard ones, and figure it
out from there, but this doesn't seem a terribly reliable way of doing

Hmm. Try cleaning your drive. You can get those disks specially for cleaning

I had the exactly oposite experience. Each time that I experienced a
crash while running an OS on a FFS partition, I lost files that
weren't even open!!!! Files that had not been open for ages! As for
ext2fs, I sometimes crashed Linux, my ext2fs server or I sometime
forgot to shutdown properly and never had any problems to recover my
data.

Only once did I have a major corruption problem with ext2fs but I
guess this was a bug in the actual implementation in the kernel.

Subject: Status of Linux and Distributions security

How do the recent linux kernels (1.1.45+) and the various distributions
(Slackware, SLS, Debian) compare to commercial UNIX offerings such as
SCO, UnixWare, and BSDI for the number of security holes each is known
to have?  Is Linux secure enough so that "hostile" users can be given
accounts without worrying about compromised root access with distributions
like Slackware 2.0.1?  How does Linux compare to other UNIXes in its
handling of attempts by hostile users to make the system suffer (such
as disk capacity filling, runaway processes, or exploiting setuid
scripts, etc.)?

Linux's reptuation would seem to me to be partially based on its perceived
efficacy in preventing system break-ins and crashes.  Does Linux have
the kind of safety record that should earn it the kind of reputation
that the commerical UNIXes have?
