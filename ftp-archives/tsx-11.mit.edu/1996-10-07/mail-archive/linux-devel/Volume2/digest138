I highly doubt that it is faster in any implementation.  The 'A'+'a' will be 
performed at compile time, so you get one subtraction (or addition).
A table lookup would involve an addition and a dereference.

Hi,

I have put my second alpha version of the Token Ring driver and the PS/2
ESDI driver for anonymouts ftp at aix13ps2.cc.kuleuven.ac.be in pub/Linux.
There 4 files :

PS2-ESDI.patch.1.1.49.gz  patches for Linux 1.1.49 for PS/2 ESDI drives. This
                          driver doesn't seem to work on a PS/2 Model 80. I
                          don't know why yet. I am using it on Model 70.

vmlinuz.PS2-ESDI          Bootable kernel image of 1.1.49 with the ESDI driver.

TokenRing.patch-1.1.49.gz patches for Linux 1.1.49 for IBM token ring adapters.
                          This driver works on most IBM ISA and MCA token ring
                          adapters that use shared memory.

vmlinuz.TokenRing         Bootable kernel image of 1.1.49 with the TR driver.

The HPFS code is admissible if HPFS has its own builtin assumptions
about what character sets stuff is stored in. Indeed, it would *have*
to be coded that way if the HPFS charset was in any way different from
the one Linux is "natively" using.

The toupper() and tolower() macros are IMHO broken.
Here is what SUN did to bail out of a similar speed vs correctness problem
(from the Sun 4.1 ctype(3V) man page):

  Character Conversion Macros
     The macros _toupper() and _tolower()  are  faster  than  the
     equivalent functions (toupper() and tolower()) but only work
     properly on a restricted range of characters, and  will  not
     work  on  a  LC_CTYPE  category  other  than the default "C"
     (ASCII).

The isupper() macro is, for instance,

#define isupper(c)      ((_ctype_+1)[c]&_U)

I have my doubts that this will work for a variable-length encoding
like UTF-8.

Also, table lookups are NOT The Solution; the uppercase equivalent
of the ß (German double-s character) is SS (two letters), and it is
not possible to write code that guarantees that tolower(toupper(c)) is
the same thing in such a context.
Not all languages *have* the upper/lower distinction, either.

Internationalization is *hard* - but defining the tolower() and toupper()
stuff as functions rather than macros is a beginning. Then I can at least
relink them instead of having to recompile the programs every time the
world gets a little bit better.

Keep up the good work!

"Suppose" is the key word here. An Indy with 16MB RAM running IRIX 5.2
performs roughly the same as a Linux box if you just use twm, emacs
and a couple of xterms on either machine.

However, people using an Indy will generally want to take advantage of
the Indigo Magic desktop, and with Insight/MediaMail/CodeVision/Mosaic
etc. running, you'll soon want to upgrade to 32 MB.

BTW, the entry level Indy used to be the Indy 4400PC, and the 4400's
performance without a secondary cache is pretty poor. It's still at
least as fast as a DX66.

I have used Indy PC with 16MB running IRIX 5.1 and 5.2. The difference
is phenomenal. (Of course we have more powered machines as well.) I've
also tried using a 486/66 with 16MB running 1.0.9+cluster+ide+lx10
interactively while one person remote logged ran a heavy compilation.
It was intolerable, swapping performance really sucked (it was
swapping to IDE, probably a bad idea). We've upgraded it to 32MB now,

Date: Thu, 8 Sep 1994 01:26:35 GMT

Hi all,
I have a SyQuest 3720S (270MB SCSI removeable HD) running off a SB16 
SCSI-2.  I was wondering if someone has written a driver for it like the 
one SyQuest provides for DOS that allows automatic recognition of a new 
cartridge when I swap cartridges.  (without the driver you can't swap 
cartridges without rebooting.)  Is there one for Linux?  If not could one 
be written?  If so could someone point me the way?  I can get any spec I 
might need about the drive (how it reports swapping, etc.) since I work 
at SyQuest.  Or would someone be willing to write it?  I'm very new to 
Linux and have a little programming background, but nothing like this.  I 
could get you anything you might need- I might even be able to con one of 
my friends who programmed the DOS version to give you some info.  BTW, 
yes, I do know that I can just umount & then mount the new cartridge, but 
since I swap cartridges so much this is becoming a pain.  TIA for anyone 
who can give me some insight!

Subject: Why I cannot mount a PhotoCD on Mitsumi ?
Date: 7 Sep 1994 15:32:43 -0400

Hi Again,

I asked the above question once, but had no positive answer. 
The problem is the following:

I'd like to mount a PhotoCD using Linux 1.0.9 and a Mitsumi doublespeed 
CD drive. I guess the "mount -t iso9660 /dev/mcd /cdrom" command should
do it, but it doesnt. It gives the usual 
"mount: wrong fs type, /dev/mcd already mounted, /cdrom busy, or other error"
error message.

Is the PhotoCD compatibility missing from the mcd.c driver? 

I CAN mount regular data CD-s on the same drive with the same command.
Also, the same drive CAN read PhotoCD-s under MS-DOS, so it is not a hardware
problem.

Anoybody knows the solution to this?

Thanks,
        Tamas

While the the network behind our gateway was physically under repair it was

Is this bug ?

I have seen OS/2 SMP running on many dual Pentium processors. In fact, it 
can run on a system upto 16 processors. The system (two pentium 
processors) I tried didn't seem to be faster than a single processor 
system, but it would maintain its speed while multi-tasking. A feature of 
OS/2 that I like most is multithreading.

As for Linux, I would rather like to see it to be ported to PowerPC.

There is definately some problem with the video card access, I have
a system at work that crashes when I start DOSEMU with direct video access.
And it worked before (I think that was with 0.49)

However, as I don't want to solve it myself, I don't complain...

You should not intermix FILE operations with operations using fd's.
Use fwrite() instead of write() and all will be OK.

POSIX.1 describes a few special cases that are allowed, but in general
the behaviour of programs like you have written is undefined.  That it
works on some systems does not mean that it is an error when it does
not work on Linux.

Yes, it may also permanently solve an erratic problem that I have seen
(and someone else has reported it as well...):

Since the time the FLOPPY driver no longer permanently grabs the IRQ #6,
it has happened that the ethernet driver (for my NE2000) sometimes
misdetects the IRQ of that card as #6.  The card is jumper-configured,
so when this happens both my floppy and the network fail to operate.

I have been able to fix this by playing with a delay in the ethernet
driver, but I feel it is generally unreliable now.

What would be nice, is to have all the "autodetect" code moved to a common
place (other drivers use autodetect as well, each with their own code)
and then add some mechanisms to somehow protect certain interrupts
according to parameters passed to this autodetect function.

like: "I am going to autodetect an interrupt that I will permanently
grab afterwards, so don't return an interrupt that has been claimed
by another driver on a temporary basis".

It looks like one would like to be able to categorize IRQ's into classes
like "unallocated", "permanently allocated", "claimed for temporary use"
and maybe others.

The other option of course is to to provide a compiler flag which forces the
code to be loaded into the low 32 bits of memory, and then your program will
not break (generally !!). I personally do not like this idea but the DEC 
C compiler for OSF/1 has such a flag and I know of projects where this falg has
saved a tremendous amount of reworking of existing code.
