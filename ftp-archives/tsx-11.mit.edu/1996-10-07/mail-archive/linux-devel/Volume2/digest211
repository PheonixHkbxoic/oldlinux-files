To build a place where you can get information I suggest
a new group: comp.os.linux.development.moderated

or something like this.

There should be only a limited group of members be allowed
to pst to this group. These members can vote for any
other person to be allowed to post also.
If there is a majority of 30%, the new person can
become member to.
How can somebody become member?
to write good articles in Comp.os.linux.development!!!

then the others will sea and vote for himher.

If there are more votes than 30% of the members to quit
the right of somebody to post, the right will be canceled.

this can be done automaticly: are there some volunteers out
to do  it?

Even if I am not alowed to post. I like to read information.

I have released a complete ELF developement kit for testing. Everything
in it is linked with one or more ELF/PIC libraries. From what I have seen
so far, the speed of ELF/PIC shared library is pretty good. I hope someone
will compile an entire Linux distribution with ELF to see how good/bad
it is. With ELF, you can easily make shared libraries without worrying too
much :-).

FYI, the public release of the Linux C library will contain the ELF
version of the shared libraries.

           I am not entirely unsympathetic to the complaints about loss of
   performance, but to start with I just want to get vanilla ELF working and
   stable.  Once we reach this point, then performance enhancements can be
   considered (and I do have ideas).  How much trouble I go to depends upon
   how bad the problem really is, and this will become evident as time
   goes on.  Whatever enhancements I make to improve performance will have
   the following properties:

OK... so I gather ELF binaries and shared libraries are a viable
long-term solution to the current shared library foo.

In fact, it looks inevitable to me.

So here's the next question: who will be the first to support a
complete ELF-based Linux distribution? Are any of the major
distributors planning to do this?

I built the Modula-3 runtime libraries using the current shared-library
tools (that's how I got started with this thread), and I can image
that eliminating all that assembly re-writing could dramatically impact
the time it takes to compile a complete Linux distribution. Should
be quite a bit quicker.

So are there significant technical obstacles remaining, or is it
a question of mind-share now?

How many major apps have been built/tested with the ELF tools?

        * Has the X386 team started messing with ELF tools?
                (how do they build shared libs for other BSD-based
                x86 unices like BSD386, NetBSD, FreeBSD, and the like?)

        * How about the apps where nobody touches the source code
                any more, like TeX?

        * I heard emacs excercised some problems with the ELF tools.
                Anyone care to elaborate?

        * How about the networking tools -- are there any interactions?
                Has anyone begun exploring?


From what I have read, the ELF tools are nearly complete. They are
exiting the ALPHA phase, and it's time for major wide-spread BETA
testing. I guess that will take a few months, and then distributors
will start to think seriously about doing an ELF-based distribution...
probably some time before next summer.

Does that sound reasonable?

Some people were discussing it a couple weeks ago, but it doesn't 
actually exist.  The discussion was hypothetical.  There is however,
a version of one of the free BSDs currently in beta on the SPARC.
Ask on, say, comp.sys.sun.misc about it.

And in practice, people who route the loopback _host_, and people who
route the loopback _network_ seem evenly split.  Perversely, Mmy machine
_says_ it's routing the host, but any host on that net is loopback.  Go
figure...

This depends, as you say, on whether the IP kernel code can make it's
routing decisions based on interface name, rather than interface address.
I gather some can, and I gather it's a new thing.  Older (primarily
4.2/3BSD) code apparently couldn't.  I'm in the middle of rereading
Leffler & McKusick, I should have a better answer than that shortly.
