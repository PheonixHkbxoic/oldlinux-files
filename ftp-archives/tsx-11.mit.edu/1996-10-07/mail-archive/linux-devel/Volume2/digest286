Hi all,

I have just set up my linux system but I could not record sound with the 
sound blaster 16 ASP card. It's strange that playing sound files is perfectly
good! I have try to set mixer, but don't know how to do it!

could anyone figure out the problem(s).

Thanks a lot!

The PCI-SC200 is made by ASUS.  SWT (swt@netcom.com or /pub/swt
via anonymous ftp at ftp.netcom.com) is one vendor who sells this card
(for approxmiately $75 -- at least they did as of a few weeks ago).
This card works with Linux as long as your motherboard has BIOS support
for the NCR chip (or so I'm told).  I think that both the ASUS motherboards
and the "Intel PCI Premier II" have the proper support (don't know about
others).

You might be interested in a software toolkit called QuickThreads.
QuickThreads provides primitives that can serve as a foundation
for a threads library.  Here is the README from quickthreads:

-John

--cut here--

This is a source code distribution for QuickThreads.  QuickThreads is a
toolkit for building threads packages; it is described in detail in the
University of Washington CS&E Technical report #93-05-06, available via
anonymous ftp from `ftp.cs.washington.edu' (128.95.1.4, as of Dec. '93)
in `tr/1993/05/UW-CSE-93-05-06.PS.Z'.

This distribution shows basic ideas in QuickThreads and elaborates with
example implementations for a gaggle of machines.  As of December those
machines included:

        80386 faimly
        88000 faimily
        DEC AXP (Alpha) family
        KSR
        MIPS family
        SPARC V8 family
        VAX family

Configuration, build, and installation are described in INSTALL.

Be aware: that there is no varargs code for the KSR.



Here is a brief summary:

QuickThreads is a toolkit for building threads packages.  It is my hope
that you'll find it easier to use QuickThreads normally than to take it
and modify the raw cswap code to fit your application.  The idea behind
QuickThreads is that it should make it easy for you to write & retarget
threads packages.  If you want the routine `t_create' to create threads
and `t_block' to suspend threads, you write them using the QuickThreads
`primitive' operations `QT_SP', `QT_INIT', and `QT_BLOCK', that perform
machine-dependent initialization and blocking, plus code you supply for
performing the portable operatons.  For example, you might write:

        t_create (func, arg)
        {
          stk = malloc (STKSIZE);
          stackbase = QT_SP (stk, STKSIZE);
          sp = QT_INIT (stakcbase, func, arg);
          qput (runq, sp);
        }

Threads block by doing something like:

        t_block()
        {
          sp_next = qget (runq);
          QT_BLOCK (helper, runq, sp_next);
          // wake up again here
        }

        // called by QT_BLOCK after the old thread has blocked,
        // puts the old thread on the queue `onq'.
        helper (sp_old, onq)
        {
          qput (onq, sp_old);
        }

(Of course) it's actually a bit more complex than that, but the general
idea is that you write portable code to allocate stacks and enqueue and
dequeue threads.  Than, to get your threads package up and running on a
different machine, you just reconfigure QuickThreads and recompile, and
that's it.

The QuickThreads `distribution' includes a sample threads package (look
at stp.{c,h}) that is written in terms of QuickThreads operations.  The
TR mentioned above explains the simple threads package in detail.



If you do use QuickThreads, I'd like to hear both about what worked for
you and what didn't work, problems you had, insights gleaned, etc.

Let me know what you think.

I love people who write my name correctly. ;-)

The stuff is available at ftp.rus.uni-stuttgart.de:/pub/systems/linux/isdn.
Patches based on 1.1.52 and libc-4.6.14 should be available sometime next
week. 

NB, the ISDN stuff currently only does German ISDN and doesn't support PPP
yet.

Add AberMUD4 and AberMUD5 - AberMUD5 was originally developed on an Amiga,
ported to Unix, ported back to the Amiga with AmiTCP and then later on
developed under Linux. I've not done any AberMUD code for a long time since I
sort of ended up working on Linux networking instead 8).

Except for the fact the previous record on sendmail bugs like the 8.6.8 bug
that was basically hushed up until 8.6.9 is out. In my case I use smail
because I have an application sendmail can't do cleanly.

BTW: Its a 30 second recompile of src/main.c to fix the -D bug. Someone left
the argument out of the list that causes the program to unsetuid.

If you are in a real hurry shared memory, and an asm spinlock using xchg
will give you amazing context switch rates. Not portable but very fast.

No no no no no 8) This isn't DOS. Get the joystick device and insmod it. Now
you can drive any joystick and portably 8). It gives you /dev/joy0 /dev/joy1

A decent lock program allows you to use the root password to unlock any
session. This is actually also a hazard because people then do their own
screen saver. CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE is handy 8)

Subject: New set of tty/serial patches...
Date: 10 Oct 1994 13:09:10 -0400
Reply-To: tytso@MIT.EDU

There's a new set of tty/serial patches available on tsx-11.mit.edu, in
the directory /pub/linux/ALPHA/tty.  The patches are versus 1.1.52, and
fix some recent problems that some people have reported.  I *think* it
may also fix some of the kernel faults that some people have reported,
which usually happen in conjuction with using the serial driver in a
demanding dialup/callout system.  Hopefully the race condition has been
fixed and dealt with.

In any case, if those of you who have been reporting problems could give
this set of patches a try, and let me know how it works, I'd really
appreciate it.  Thanks!!!

                                                - Ted

Sun Oct  9 23:46:03 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@rt-11)

        * tty_io.c (do_tty_hangup): If the tty driver flags
                TTY_DRIVER_RESET_TERMIOS is set, then reset the termios
                settings back to the driver's initial configuration.  This
                allows the termios settings to be reset even if a process
                has hung up file descriptors keeping a pty's termios from
                being freed and reset.

        * tty_io.c (release_dev): Fix memory leak.  The pty's other
                termios structure should also be freed.

        * serial.c (rs_close, shutdown): Change how we wait for the
                transmitter to completely drain before shutting down the
                serial port.  We now do it by scheduling in another
                process instead of busy looping with the interrupts turned
                on.  This may eliminate some race condition problems that
                some people seem to be reporting.

Sun Sep 25 14:18:14 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@rt-11)

        * tty_io.c (release_dev): When freeing a tty make sure that both
                the tty and the o_tty (if present) aren't a process's
                controlling tty.  (Previously, we only checked the tty.)

        * serial.c (change_speed): Only enable the Modem Status
                Interrupt for a port if CLOCAL is not set or CRTSCTS
                is set.  If we're not checking the carrier detect and
                CTS line, there's no point in enabling the modem
                status interrupt.  This will save spurious interrupts
                from slowing down systems who have terminals that
                don't support either line.  (Of course, if you want
                only one of CD and CTS support, you will need a
                properly wired serial cable.)

Thu Sep 22 08:32:48 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@rt-11)

        * tty_io.c (do_SAK): Return if tty is null.

        * tty_io.c (_tty_name): Return "NULL tty" if the passed in tty is
                NULL.

Sat Sep 17 13:19:25 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@rt-11)

        * tty_ioctl.c (n_tty_ioctl): Fix TIOCGLCKTRMIOS and
                TIOCSLCKTRMIOS, which were totally broken.  Remove
                extra indirection from argument; it should be a struct
                termios *, not a struct termios **.
                &real_tty->termios_locked should have been
                real_tty->termios_locked.  This caused us to be
                reading and writing the termios_locked structure to
                random places in kernel memory.  

        * tty_io.c (release_dev): Oops!  Forgot to delete a critical kfree
                of the locked_termios.  This leaves the locked_termios
                structure pointed at a freed object.  

Fri Sep 16 08:13:25 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@rt-11)

        * tty_io.c (tty_open): Don't check for an exclusive open until
                after the device specific open routine has been called.
                Otherwise, the serial device ref counting will be screwed
                up.

        * serial.c (rs_open, block_til_ready): Don't set termios structure
                until after block_til_ready has returned successfully.
                Modify block_til_ready to check the normal_termios
                structure directly, so it doesn't rely on termios being
                set before its called.

Thu Sep 15 23:34:01 1994  Theodore Y. Ts'o  (tytso@rt-11)

        * serial.c (rs_close): Turn off interrupts during rs_close() to
                prevent a race condition with the hangup code (which
                runs during a software interrupt).

        * tty_io.c (release_dev): Don't free the locked_termios structure;
                its state must be retained across device opens.


        * tty_io.c (tty_unregister_driver): Added function to unregister a
                tty driver.  (For loadable device drivers.)
