   Noway!  It's already been said and repeatedly confirmed that the DCL
will work for disks removed... simple, when someone cd's into /floppy or
something (maybe /flop0 etc..) simply automount this disk...  don't do
anything till the DCL changes (e.g. disk eject) then umount it.

Subject: people using SCSI-IN2000 driver, please read this
Date: 26 Sep 1994 16:33:15 GMT

Hi!

Is anybody able to fix the problem with the in2000 driver?
Sometimes while swapping (to a swap-partition) the driver crashes. 
No read/writes are possible and therefore every process begins to hang 
when it needs access to the disk. The HD light burns constantly.

Console switching (during the driver crash) is possible as long as
Xfree do not use the disk or when working at a plain text console.
However, each console begins to hang as soon as a process needs disk access
(e.g. excuting a new command)

"ping" from other machines result in "<hostname> is alive."

My in2000-bios version is 1.03, the hardware-version is 27 (bootup message)
kernel is 1.1.50 with 16 MB, 17 MB swap-space on a swap partition. I use 
the newest version of the in2000.c. 
(My memory "upgrade" 8->16 MB has shown, that the driver crashing occurs 
more seldom --- this is a result of fewer swapping requests, I suppose).

I HAVE READ THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE USING THE IN2000 DRIVER WITHOUT
PROBLEMS.  PERHAPS WE CAN FIND OUT THE BIOS- AND HARDWARE-VERSIONS
WHICH WORK AND WHICH DO NOT WORK. PLEASE POST (OR SEND ME MAIL) YOUR
CONFIGURATION (KERNEL, RAM, SWAP-TYPE AND SPACE, HARDDRIVE) AND
IN2000-VERSION HERE.  PLEASE WRITE IF CRASHING OCCURS OR NOT.

Perhaps we can fix this nasty bug.

Another question: Perhaps one of the gurus can post us how to set up
the in2000 driver for intelligent debugging. I tried to set "#define DEBUG" in
in2000.c, redirected kernel-errors/debug/crit-messages of the syslogd to
/dev/console and recompiled the kernel. However there are so many
messages, that I cannot bootup again. 

Okidoki,
        Stefan.

I saw a posting in comp.os.solaris recently about assigning multiple
IP addresses to the same adapter! (on a SparcStation with Solaris 2.x)

This was done in order to route something across the same physical network
without the need for an extra adapter. The second "virtual" adapter was
referred to as le0:1, the ":1" part appended to the original adapter name.
Though a bit unusual, there's nothing wrong with this I think.
I suppose there are no plans yet for implementing this feature in linux.

I got a Dell Optiplex 590 that works fine. It has the Intel Neptune 
chipset as far as I can tell. The motherboard is proprietary to Dell and 
wouldn't fit in anything else by the look of it.

Cary,

You have the atdisk2 patches, which are meant for *two* IDE controller
cards, not one card with two IDE channels. I own a buslogic BT410A that has
on-board BIOS to goad DOS into accepting up to four drives. Since this
is the development group, perhaps someone out there could look at the

I've also installed Linux 1.1.49 on a Plato / Neptune board. We had
problems with the original bios (version X.X.3)  but an upgrade (to
X.X.10) solved that. I'm running it with:
        Orchid Kelvin 64 on PCI
        SMC Ultra on ISA
        FD 1650 SCSI on ISA

There's a small problem cleaning up when X shuts down - the text mode
font gets screwed up, but that's probably an X problem.

Cheers,

Okay, I was a little snide, and I admit it and apologize.  The point 
hwoever was that when one uses a 'standard terminal connection' (as 
opposed to a SLIP connection) one is entering the raw UNIX domain, which 
can actually be alot mroe powerful (if you considr effeiciency to be a 
form of power) then any fancy graphical front-end.  My other point 
was that this is what all these other things are built on top of, so you 
lose almost nothing but eye-candy, and gain bandwidth.

I doubt anybodyu who posts crap like this actually bothers to read the 
responses, but just to make me feel good, pardon while I indluge myself:

To Florida Datamation:

Hey there. You guys MUST be engineers, 'cause you sure know squat about 
people.  Posting a message saying 'what you are using STINKS, come try 
ours' in a forum dedicated to fans of said product is truely stupid 
marketing.  All it does is gain you nasty looks and bad feelings from 
exactly the people you are trying to see to.

As an example, I've considered QNX a couple of times for real-time 
control projects, but your obvious lack of understanding of the community 
has certainly given me pause as to how much you understand about UNIX.  
Your sweeping claims make me doubt the mroe reasonable claims I've 
heard.  (Oh, and the fact that you are in FL doesn't hep either, I'm 
afraid.  I've lived in FL and know about the overal business ethics 
environment...)

I think Ill examine it ALOT closer before I start seriously considering it 
for future projects.
