Right.  So you don't need to graft on all of these ridiculous hacks to
get nice multilingual software like Nisus.  I'm constantly frustrated
by Unix developers who tell me their product is fully internationalized,
only to find that it's, at best, hacked for a language here or there.
They nearly always fail my simple acid test, namely let me quote Shakes-
peare and the Quran in the same paragraph or message.  Typically what
they mean when they say "internationalized" is "capable of being local-
ized to support a language other than English."

Being an American, I realize that it's hard for us to understand a
multilingual environment like India, Canada, much of Russia, etc.; or
a culture like Iran or Turkey, where Arabic has a certain standing as
a religious language, though the populace speaks a non-Semitic vernacu-
lar.  What I don't understand is why foreign markets are putting up
with the whole mess by permitting single-language localizations.  If
everyone just said, "Give me a fully internationalized OS that sup-
ports wide characters and has a script manager built into the GUI,"
then, well, a lot of goons would be out of work.  But we'd be that
much closer to Nirvana.

Incidentally, what is this Mule?  Is this a truly internationalized
product, or a hack to get the OS to work with some specific non-western
language like Japanese?

Subject: 'keyboard error' - anyone else still get this?
Date: 2 Sep 1994 12:16:59 +0100

I'm not sure why, but I keep getting 'keyboard errors' reported
by the kernel, (even with 1.1.49), and have done since about 1.0.
Are other people getting these, or is it just my keyboard? I haven't
changed anything, except putting shift-3 to 'sterling', and I've got
a UK keyboard (# next to return, " on shift-2). It only seems to happen
about 2 or 3 times a day, perhaps when I press an unusual combination.

Also, has anyone else got 'selection' to work after switching consoles 
from X (in this case, XF86_S3). Mine doesn't :-(  New version needed?
Do I have to shut down the X server to get my mouse back?

Thanks,
Jon.

I have a few opinions:

DO NOT get the device driver book called, "Writing UNIX Device Drivers in C"
by Tondo and Adams.  I felt they took a lot of short cuts in explaining things
and most of the text is a group of appendices (of templates for drivers).

I would recommend--even though it is a SCO UNIX based book--"Writing Device
Drivers for SCO UNIX", 1993, Addison-Wesley, by Peter Kettle and Steve Statler.
(ISBN 0-201-54425-3).  I paid $37.50 for mine.  Now I know you may not
be writing drivers for SCO, but the book offers a lot of information that
could be applied to most variants of System V.  They have lots of complete
drivers in the book and complete chapters on interrupts, STREAMS, etc.

If you are looking to write Linux device drivers, the source code and the
kernel hackers guide would be a start.

Hope this helps.

Date: Sat, 3 Sep 1994 01:18:05 GMT

Hello,

When running XFree and using a cdrom device I notice
that the transfer rate of my scsi disk slows down.
When not running XFree no decrease in transferrate can be observed.
If however XFree (openwin) is started the transfer rate is slowed down.
normally I get 5.6 Mbyte/sec but under X11 when /dev/sr0 is accessed
or has been accessed the transfer rate goes down to 500 to 700 kbyte/sec..

Is this normal? Is there a fix? (Hardware or Software?)

stdlib.h uses the typedef wchar_t, and indicates it is defined in stddef.h
(by defining __need_wchar_t).  Unfortunately, somewhere when the kernel
was being update, these were removed (or were never there, and no one updated
stdlib).  I saw this when trying to compile tclmidi, since g++ is very picky,

No, the problem is with the distribution of the SoundBlaster code.
I've had similar problems with 1.1.43 and 1.1.49 (I just jumped from
one to the other).  In the first case, I solved the problem by poking
around enough of the SB code to strategically #ifdef out the offending
code.  In the second case, I enabled more options when configuring the
sound card and the problem went away.  (I figured it would from my
perusal of the code in 1.1.43).

The problem appears to be that, according to the configuration
program, if you have a SoundBlaster16, you have the DSP that goes with
it.  Since I have an SB16 sans DSP, I thought it would be wise not to
configure the kernel with DSP support,  (I believe the *SPEECH* option
specifies this), especially since the probe routine was esentially a
NOP.  When I upgraded to 1.1.49 and ran into the same problem, I
decided to go ahead and configure the SPEECH (and MIDI, and possibly
one or two other) options that I don't have the hardware to support.
I figured it couldn't hurt since I haven't been using the sound
capabilities anyway.

I don't really know that much about the SB card set.  It seems to me
that CreativeLabs started out with SoundBlaster, an 8-bit card;
designed an improved card, the SoundBlaster Pro, an 8-bit stereo card;
designed another improved card, the SoundBlaster 16, a 16-bit card;
and I've gotten lost with the proliferation of cards and features
since then.  There's probably a FAQ somewhere that I haven't had time
to look for.

Anyway, You could probably solve your problem by configuring full
sound support, or by selectively hacking the sources.

BTW,  I would like to formally request that the configuration
parameters for the sound support be integrated in the rest of the
kernel configuration parameters in time for the next code freeze.  It
can really be annoying to try to remember what parameters I chose the
last time I configured the kernel and there's no reason this fancy
machine in front of me couldn't remember them for me automagically.

This normally works OK for serial mice, and often there are problems
with PS/2 mice.

The problem of the original poster was that his keyboard recognition software
is broken and he wants to blame someone else for it.
I have written a tree-based keyboard table as well, years ago, and I
never have seen problems like that.  It also works with Linux.  Probably
his code is not using a tree datastructure where it should.

Hi,

        I am still stuck since a week with a network problem and I pull my hairs
off (and eat my nails also). Please help !!!!!!!!

        I was running slackware 1.2 without problem for a while and upgraded
my system WITH THE ORIGINAL/FULL DISTRIBUTION from sunsite.unc.edu. Since, I
can't anymore boot my new kernel with my 3C503 card.

        I get this #$&#*$&!   SIOCADDRT Invalid Argument ass soon as I try to
access it.

o I have tried to install NetKit A and B and noticed that ifconfig
  returns something like

        IRQ=0 and BaseAddr=0.

        Also HWaddr=00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00

o What is REALLY wired is that the kernel boot and probe the card 
  correctely

        3C503 probe at 0x2e0: not found

        What does it mean ??? I am not a linux newbie and installed
successfully many systems (SLS and Slackware) without any kind of problem.

        I don't believe there is an IRQ conflict somewhere (I have check the
BIOS also) and IT WAS WORKING BEFORE.


I have:
        o make config
          with correct setup
        o edit ./drivers/net/CONFIG
        o make zImage.


        Note that it does THE SAME THING if I replace my 3c503 with a 3c509.


        ARGGHHHH !!!! Please help me so I will not return to Slackware 1.2.

The following discussion applies completely to my machine, too.
I am still on 1.0.8, and was hoping that when I upgraded to 1.1.zillion :-)
the problem would disappear.   I have a 386DX/25 with a 3c503.  I suspect
it's CPU speed sensitive, because a friend with a 486 but an identical
ethernet card has no problem.  Another friend with a 386DX/33 is about
the same as me.  The problem comes and goes, my typical uptime is 1 month
between reboots, and I have a ping -i40 <big-ultrix-mainframe> to keep
the problem under control (I have the ping started from rc.inet2).

This happens when the SB driver is enabled but the digitized voice
support is disabled. Just run make config again and enable
"digitized voice". A faster way is to edit linux/drivers/sound/local.h and
remove the line containing #define EXCLUDE_AUDIO.

They are included in later revision kernels (I'm not too sure when

Perhaps you should differantiate between multilingual (can work with
many languages/scripts at once) and internationalized (can work with
an arbitrary but fixed language/script at one given instantiation).

In our work this distinction has shown to be very proficient. And the
literatore on I18N actually often mean the latter thing.

The plot thickens.  I'm running 1.1.49, but dmesg reports:

FDC 0 is a 8272A

on my system.  Just on a lark, I tried the above steps, figuring I'd
have no trouble.  I was wrong.  When I get to step 4, e2fsck reports a
large number of inodes not used with links_count not null.  It offers
the choice of repairing them, so I chose yes.  I then do steps 5 and 6,
and everything comes out clean.  I had inserted a step 2.5, where I did a
cmp on the file I copied to the floppy with the original, and it came
up clean.  I have not had any trouble with tar, and I don't normally
use filesystems on floppies, so this is not something I would otherwise
have noticed.

Other info on my system:  486/33 ISA, AMI BIOS, el-cheapo IDE/floppy
controller, two IDE HDs (a Conner and a WDC), and a couple other 
probably irrelevant cards plugged in (S3 video, SoundBlaster, Internal
modem w/ 16550A).

I also have scsi corruption on a sony MO drive(128MB) and a buslogic
542B controller(IDE with multimode 64 is fine).  The drive works under
dos.  I've not tried to trouble shoot it very much.
