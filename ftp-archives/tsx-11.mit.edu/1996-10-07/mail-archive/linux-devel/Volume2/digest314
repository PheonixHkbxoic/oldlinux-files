The problem has been found.  The version of time(1) on my slackware 2.0 system
produces output which is not compatible with one of the awk(1) scripts used to
do the benchmark's data reduction (loopm.awk).  Because this awk script wasn't
correctly parsing the timing, it was incorrectly reporting the number of loops
per minute as 1.0.  The problem should only have affected the shell tests as
only those are reduced with this particular awk script.

I'll be rerunning the tests this weekend so I can put out corrected results
early next week.

My apologies for any wild goose chases I've started w.r.t. scheduler

Thanks to David Niemi and Shaune Beattie for checking results.  Hopefully
this is the only error.

This may be stupid, but I was wondering why the interrupt handler can't
check for received data in both UARTs. If it is possible to poll the UARTS
why can't this be done? Would it make the interrupt handler too time
consuming?

Just a thought,

: Is it posible to create logigal volumes across drives and/or partitions and then mount a single filesystem on that volume? I know it can be done on HP-UX, but I want to do it on my LINUX box?

I've used logical volumes on IRIX a little. Worked pretty nice. I don't 
know if it would be worth the trouble to implement. Perhaps someone will 
write it as an optional add-on to an existing FS, so only people who 
really want it need to incur the overhead & risk.

On a related note, I am S/A on a UNIX system that implements "transaction 
logging" (I'm sure it is called something else on other unices). This is 
really great for data integrity and actually improves performance. The 
basic system is that all FS writes are made to a special log partition as 
change records. A daemon uses these records to update the FS and then 
mark the record as deleted. This works in a sort of circular queue, with 
the daemon monitoring disk activity to only do FS writes when the drives 
are quiet or the queue is near capacity. The system boot sequence checks 
this partition and performs an update to the FS for all records in the 
partition. This means that a power failure only endangeres those changes 
not written to the log partition. Writes to the log partition are not 
buffered and are rather small and require little head movement. 
Obviously, all reads must go through this system also to detect and 
correct reads from blocks affected by logged records. I know this is not 
trivial to implement, but it works great, fsck doesn't even need to be 
run on a FS like this after a crash. It requires minimal extra disk space 
and greatly enhances the logical integrity of the FS.

Just my $.02

The latest kernels (> 1.1.50 I think) have a simple static 5 block cache
in the NFS client. This improves average performance significantly (~50%).
It is still not multi-threaded in anyway, so multiple processes using
NFS filesystems will be seriously hit.

I think the plan is to modify the system cache so that it can be used
with NFS, but this wont happen before 1.2. Also the client code must be
made muli-threading if you want decent muli-user performance,
I don't know if there are any plans for that.

I agree on that.

However, i would like to say (with other people) that this is the Unix
way of doing. This is not neccesarily a good thing. The Unix plain
byte-stream file paradigm is outdated for todays needs.

But a more structured file paradigm requires IMHO a complete rewrite
of all the operating system:

1) Obviously, the kernel must change -not only the filesystem layers,
but also new (or extended) system calls to manipulate file structure.

2) Reasonably, the executable format of programs should take advantage
of such structured files (and looking into recent executable or object
formats such as ELF or perhaps COFF easily advocates the need of
structured files).

3) Hence, the execution model (ie the execve call or its successors)
should also change.

4) all IO libraries should support the better IO model.

5) perhaps the languages should better support a structured IO model.

6) Probably, there won't be a universally agreed upon file (meta)
structure. Hence, there should be several kind of files; this
advocates file servers and microkernel techniques.

(perhaps TRON model of files -which contains stream of either bytes or
filetables like directories- might be interesting).

This won't be Unix anymore. this won't be Linux neither.

It is time to wait for Hurd or VSTa...

I agree. I once calculated how many distinct file types were
available on the HP3000 under MPE. I don't remember the number,
but it was in the millions of trillions when you combined all
possible parameter values. The most obvious characteristic of
that OS was its bugginess when you wanted to put something in
a file that HP hadn't anticipated.

Ok, Question:

I understand that the yggdrasil xfree3.1-beta was built with the old version
number - is yggdrasil making available xfree3.1 (non-beta) built the same way? 
And if so, is it available via anonymous ftp?  It would be much appreciated as 
I'm one of those motif users who's gotten a bit burned by all this.
