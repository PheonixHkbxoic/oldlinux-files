Also having done this (with a much slower CDROM drive), I suspect there's
another problem.  If you're running a big executable from the CDROM,
and the kernel needs to page out some of the text segment, it presumably
decides that it's already in a file, and there's no reason to write
it to the swap space on your disk.  When it needs it again, it just
reads it in again from the CDROM.  Oops.  Instead of 40 msecs or so
for two seeks on the disk, this just cost you 200msecs (650 in my case)
for a seek on the CDROM.  (This is largely conjecture.  Please correct
me if I'm wrong.)

I still think this is a reasonable way to run, but probably only if you
put commonly used executables on the magnetic disk, or have enough
memory that the kernel doesn't need to page AT ALL.  Leaving things
like man pages on the CD seems fine.

The problem seems fixable with a more intelligent paging policy.  But I
don't know of any OS that does this right.

How about /usr/X386/lib/X11/config ?

If it is there, you can make /usr/lib/X11 a symlink that points to

Subject: driver for NE3200 (EtherExpress 32 EISA)?
Date: 22 Sep 94 15:49:22 GMT

Hi folks,

I have the following problem:
my current employer has an EISA-machine with an (for me) unknown
ethernet-card. It's a 
        Intel EtherExpress 32Bit ( NE3200 ) / EISA
I'm not sure this is the correct name, but i hope some guru on
the net will recognize it.

I looked through the kernel-sources (1.1.50), but couldn't find a
driver for this card (or is it the ac3200 in drivers/net?).

Does anybody know of this card, or is there already someone writing
the driver?

It's fairly important for us to get them working (the
destination-machine will have 3 of them).

Any information would be of great value ;-)

ciao

Technically, you are right, Rob.  At least the Yygdrasil though comes

ROTFL. The real motivation for most Governments allowing amateur radio is a 
handy supply of radio trained people in case a war turns up.

HDLC is normally done on board by an 8530 SCC chip (or relative). The AX.25
code is currently (its probably going to change state machine code) based on
BSD netccitt from net-2 which is a LAPB and very limited X.25 layer just
about good enough to get IP over X.25 up. The Linux stuff is AX.25 which
is a variant on LAPB for a broadcast medium and has no equivalent upper
layers to the HDLC/LAPB/X.25/X.29 stack.

For a web server which does spread easily between machines a pile of old

All the standard network kit follows the recommendations and uses IP_TOS
to set options. People using very old networking programs may gain from
a recompile with current stuff. Linux fully supports both SO_PRIORITY and
IP_TOS.

IPIP already exists and is used occasionally. Its very undesirable since
(with some few exceptions) what it does can be done with properly set up routing.
Adding it the Linux kernel is possible I guess probably as an ipip virtual
device.

In other words, you want to implement something in the protocol to get
around the fact that you do not control the SLIP server.  Normally
protocol changes are not made to solve administrative problems.

By the way, from your description of the proposed relay option, it
sounds as if it behaves exactly like the existing loose source routing
option. Am I missing some subtle difference between the two?

OK, so read the man page for mount(1) and set the options correctly.
