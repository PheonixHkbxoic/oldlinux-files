Subject: Problems compiling 1.1.54
From: cchd@lucifer.latrobe.edu.au (Huw Davies)
Date: Mon, 17 Oct 1994 00:23:33 GMT

I've just applied the 1.1.54 patches to a (working) copy of 1.1.53, ran
make config choosing the usual group of options (although I added ISO9660
support which I must have accidentally turned off building 1.1.53) and
then ran make zImage. Sadly I get compile time errors (see below). I've
tried rebuilding the compiler with and without elf support but the errors
remain.

Given that noone else has complained, I assume that it's a problem with
my setup (most likely, I need a later version of something). Any pointers
appreciated.

Here is the section I'm having difficulties with....

Agreed. This does seem to always fix the problem but is a very messy way 
of doing things. This is not a solution when it has to be done five to 
ten times in one day.

This is the cause on your computer but what about other people. I know 
that many people have the most problems with SLIP but it is definately 
not the only place an error occurs.

This may be the cause on your machine but it certainly is not the problem 
on mine. As has been found by many other people it is not even a problem 
in the inetd.

For comparison, I don't seem to have much of a problem.

Linux Kernel Revision : 1.1.54
Mouse in Question     : MS brand busmouse (circa 1988, aka InPort)
Mouse IRQ             : 5

Do you take care to disable selection when using X11?  I was under
the impression that selection can't be enabled when using X11 and
a busmouse.  You did say X11 "or" selection, so I guess you're
aware of this problem.

At any rate, I don't compile selection into my kernels, since I'm
always in X11 anyway.

Also, I'm not seeing the poor performance that you seem to be experiencing.

I don't have procinfo here, but I did

  cat /proc/interrupts; sleep 120; cat /proc/interrupts

and got:

 5:  1301090   MS Busmouse

 5:  1304723   MS Busmouse

while running X11.  I don't understand why any interrupts are necessary
as long as the mouse doesn't move, but this is considerably less
troubling than what you saw.  This is with a 386-33.

Nope, at this moment this is not possible. Problem is the NFS server is only
 supposed to accept requests if the socket requesting the connection is bound
 to a port below 1024.

Maximum transfer unit.

The MTU is the maximum size of a "packet", you want this to be
as large as you can get it since datagrams would otherwise
fragment into multiple packets, increasing your overhead
per datagram because each packet has a seperate header.

On the other hand, if you make the MTU too big then you 
may have to have interactive traffic wait for a second or 
to for a large large batch (ftp) traffic to be sent.

I beleive IRQ 3 is reserved for tty01 under Linux. So you must put your
NE2000 card under IRQ 15 with port 340. I think is one of the best way.
But don't change your Adaptec's configuration because it's a good 
configuration. If you got a problem again then you must read your 
main-card's documentation for fixing the jumpers.

Hi,
  I'm writing a new fs and I was wondering if there was any convention as

source but didn't see any other fs's in there. Can I just pick a number, any

Is anyone who works in the Linux kernel development team 
reading all these problem reports and doing anything 
about them? Like sort through all the reports, and 
figure out which ones are bugs that probably deserve to
be paid attention to and be fixed in the next kernel
release? It seems to me as if they don't care, or they
just pay attention to what they want to. If I were deve-
loping the kernel, I'd probably make sure I went through 
all 200+ daily problem reports and figure out if there's
a real problem behind each and every one of them....
I dunno....I just get the feeling that no one is being
heard, and there are like sooo many complaints about how things
don't work... Mostly it is due users' lack of knowledge to 
set things up, but what about other probs/bugs? You know,
the serious ones? Just a thought.........

Excuse me, but aren't we _all_ members of "the Linux kernel development team"?
You included! If you find something that looks like a problem, fix it!
We are all in this together, really...

    Well, I listen to anything related to those parts of the operating
    system that I work on, and I'm sure others do as well.  But you 
    have to realize that bugs aren't necessarily easy to find... for
    example, it took me 6 hours to track down a timing window in some
    scheduling code that I was working on.  It only took 10 minutes
    to introduce the bug in the first place :-)

How about a new comment start sequence for C:

/// This is a comment.

Using /// to start a comment will:

a) Not break any legal C program
b) Not break any legal C++ program

Too simple?

The only thing I am worried about is:

/* This is a comment with a // in it */

or

/* This is a comment with a /// in it */

What does C++ do about this?

Subject: SCSI detect....
Date: Tue, 11 Oct 1994 17:01:15 GMT


Where is the code that detects what devices are on the SCSI bus during
boot?

I'm using an Adaptec 1522a, hard drive, and a CDROM. The boot kernel only
recognizes the hard drive, not the CDROM.

I looked in ~/linux/drivers/scsi/aha152x.c and sr.c, but I'm braindead
and don't see where the detection is done. Probably looking in the wrong
place to begin with.

Any help is appreciated,
Alan
