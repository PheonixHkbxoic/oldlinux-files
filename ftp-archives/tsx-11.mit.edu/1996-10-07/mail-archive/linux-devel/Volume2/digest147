Subject: mprotect() support in Linux kernel?
Date: 09 Sep 1994 22:47:56 GMT


I'm interested in enhancing the Linux port of Modula 3 to use
incremental/generational garbage collection. This requires support for
the mprotect() library routine, or its equivalent.

However, it appears that mprotect() is not supported under Linux:

In linux/mm/mmap.c, I see:
230  asmlinkage int sys_mprotect(unsigned long addr, size_t len, unsigned long prot)
231  {
232          return -EINVAL; /* Not implemented yet */
233  }

mprotect() is in /usr/include/sys/mman.h, but there's no linux man page
(that I can find) for mprotect.

In the Kernel Hackers guide at
http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/LDP/khg/section2.7.1.html
I see:

        Minor alterations are needed in some places (tests for process
        memory limits comes to mind) to provide support for programmer
        defined segments.


So I guess for now, I'm out of luck. I'm willing to hack the modula-3
runtime, but it would take me a while to ramp up on the Linux kernel
memory management.

Have I found the most recent info? Is there a more recent version of
the kernel that supports mprotect()? Is anyone working on support for
this? Is there a different library function that would serve my needs?

Thanks.

Dan

   Yes.  The star-trek cursor appears during the stop-and-copy collections.
   With the VM synchronization you get incremental and generational
   collections.  The pauses would be invisible.

   It's not much work:
     - It must be possible to protect and unprotect data pages,
       and the signal handler for memory access violations must be able
       to determine the offending address and resume from the
       signal.  See runtime/src/{DS3100,SPARC}/RTHeapDep.[im]3.

     - The system calls need wrappers that validate their arguments
       before making the call.  See runtime/src/{DS3100,SPARC}/RTHeapDepC.c.

Looks like you're comparing apples with oranges here, unless you were
using the Sun F77 compiler on the same PC, of course (Solaris is available

Umsdos is now an official part of linux since 1.1.35. There is no patch.
The only trick is to select both msdos and umsdos when you build your
kernel.

HPF (implying Fortran 90) and C++ are interesting prospects; although the
latter is only interesting if it includes exception handling and has
reasonable template management (if not, it is only of interest as long as
GNU C++ remains buggy).  ANSI C is pretty well covered by the GNU compiler
unless you require your own compiler as a back-end for a cfront-based C++)
and FORTRAN 77 is subsumed by Fortran 90.

>2. How much would people pay for such a product [ loaded question ]?

Probably $500 to with $300 as a target depending somewhat on whether
you have all 4 languages, as seems to be implied.  I would expect a
pricing structure with the environment and all languages at about $500,
environment plus one language at $200-$300 and additional languages at
$100-$200 each (price depending on language) would be reasonable.

In decreasing order of usefulness to the Linux community

        floppy

If you mean something along the lines of SunSoft's SPARCworks package
or HP's SoftBench: yes.  If you mean only a windowed interface to
gdb/dbx and/or gprof: no.

C:   gcc is just fine for Linux.
F77: f2c/gcc works for the kind of things I do with it.  I don't run
     large linear systems on a Linux box, anyway (those go on a large
     HP, or an even larger Fujitsu vector computer), but for sheer
     floating point applications, which operate on little data, a
     486 doesn't do badly compared to a heavily loaded HP.
C++: It would be nice, but not essential.
HPF: If this includes a full F90 implementation, I would earnestly try
     to talk our computer centre people into buying a campus-wide license.

>2. How much would people pay for such a product [ loaded question ]?

Depends on how much I could try and get out of the computer centre :-)

>3. What distribution media would be required?

ftp, or floppy; there should be some provision for copying the compilers
and assorted files into strange places (for example, very likely it
would go on a central NFS server and be mounted from /app).

You'd have to beat Emacs/gdb, which is probably hard, especially if
people are already used to it.

It will not be included in the next XFree86 release (3.1), but
hopefully it will be included in the release after 3.1.

In all of the tcpdumps I've seen from my Linux box I've never seen it append

Does anyone know if you can override the setting of the max clock in the code at

If I don't specify clocks in Xconfig then it will allow the 110Mhz clock needed for
1280x1024 @60HzV.  But I have not found a mode setup which will work at this 
dot clock. (works fine with the 1152x8xx 90Mhz setting in the Xconfig supplied by

I have a 21" monitor (Nanao f760i) and the current Alpha driver limits the
dot clock to a maximum of 90MHz if you specify the clocks in Xconfig.  If you
don't the code will set it to the proper 135MHz maximum.

But do you really know that anyone is using it?  Have you considered that

I've generally found the support for Linux to be better than the majority
of commercial packages and systems.  Support for commercial software often
consists of people more trained in dealing with people over the phone than
in the real technical matters that are the reason you call them in the first
place.  And the bigger the company, the closer to the bottom of the barrel
they have to scrape which tends to offset all the big company resources they
usually have to deal with such things.

The real technical people don't want to sit an answer phones all day and
have to deal with people (and these are the people who do buy commercial
software) that don't install it right and never understand what you tell
them to do anyway.

On the other hand, the real technical people -DO- frequent comp.os.linux.*
and the various mailing lists.  Many of them I find to be very helpful in
dealing with problems.  They speak the technical lingo and they know I do
as well (or else I probably would not have chosen to use Linux).

Some of those things might be useful.  Some probably won't.  GCC works
great for a C compiler.  I can't imagine the practicality of using COBOL
on Linux.  For fortran, there is "f2c | gcc".

Most of these tools are out there as shareware and freeware already.

Well, word processing -IS- out, or didn't you know?  Try TeX.  There are
limits to what wysiwyg word processing can do, particularly in a continually
updated document.  Just because it forms things correctly right now does not
mean than it will when some new text is added in.  "Post-edit-formatted"
document preparation is a completely different beastie than wysiwyg word
processing.  It has its advantages and disadvantages.

What would you suggest?  Stopping development?  The commercial unix systems
don't stop development, either.  What about just making fewer releases?
That's what 1.0 is for (and then 1.2 and 1.4 after that).  If you don't
want to stay on the bleeding edge of Linux development, there is no one
forcing you to, and you can always drop back to the last stable version
any time you want, and you can stay there as long as you want.

If 1.0 isn't good enough for a commercial software product, then so be it.
Maybe 1.2 will be.  If all the hacker types are tracking the lastest kernel
version minutes after it is released, maybe they aren't your customers.
Then again, if they are, they can certain test your product on that version
for you and let both the kernel developers and you know about problems.

All the people that don't want to think about the system they are running
will be using MS Windows or a Macintosh.  Those systems are designed for
the mass market and they do that job (with varying levels of opinions).
Those that do want to think about the system they are running on will make
their own decisions (and some will be here with us).

It's not for me.  I've developed the art of debugging without a debugger
from the early days of assembly language programming.

   2. Linux's libc tends to change its version number almost every week
      (sometimes even more often). Even though changes of the minor
      version number should not affect previous applications, they will
      sometimes break them. This means for a company that they have to
      debug the library in order to find a work-around (see 3.).

[Lotsa stuff deleted]
Two points

1) Linux is of the hackers, by the hackers, for the hackers. There is
absolutely no need to make it commercially successful. In the search for
commercial success I am afraid we might lose track of the original ideal-- a
free os which is the hacker's dream. Well if one wants commercially available
releases of UNIX there are plenty-- UnixWare, Solaris, etc. Let us have Linux
just for us. Once the commercial market is aimed at, technical advances get
sacrificed at the altar of compatability (Consider that the largest selling OS
today is the most wretched). It would be a sad day for Linux if it happened.

2) It is true to an extent that cd-rom makers are making money out of Linux.
That is capitalism for you. People will make money where they can make money.
No one in the Linux programmer group has suffered because of the CD guys. When
Linus released his code under the GPL he knew exactly what he was getting
into. Perhaps he enjoys programming for fun, perhaps he gets to go to a lot of
places and speak...

The CD-ROM market is hyped up for now, but I see no harm in CD-Makers who make
20 dollar CD-Sets. I have one, which is just a collection of archives, and I
save a lot of time and money by not doing ftp's all the time. I waste far
fewer hours doing ftp's with a 20 dollar cd. So I do not lose, Linus does not
mind, God is in His heaven and all is well with the world. Where is the
problem?
