   It doesn't need to.  Any pointer that actually gets passed around in
   a program in variables and such is still a 32-bit, absolute, "small model"
   pointer as usual.  The only thing that needs to be changed is the method
   of accessing or taking the address of a static variable.  To take the
   address of a static variable, just convert the segment-register-relative
   offset to a global, absolute offset by adding the base address of the
   library, and use the resulting absolute pointer thereafter.  This will
   work as long as a particular shared library doesn't move around in
   a particular process's address space _while_it_is_running_, which would
   be rather insane anyway. :-)

Unfortuantely, life's not that simple.  What if you take the address of
a static variable, and store it into a structure?  That structure member
might contain a pointer to a static variable local to the shared
library, or it might contain a pointer to memory in the main program's
data segment.

Or what the library routine needs to return the pointer to a static
variable, like gethostbyname() does?

Or what if the library program wants to call strlen(), strcpy(), or
strcat()?  Those routines won't know if the passed in pointer is in the
program's data segment, or in the shared library's data segment.  

If you ignore this problem, then you either (a) prohibit the shared
library from calling other shared library routines when those routines
take pointers as arguments, or (b) you play games like we have to in the
kernel, where you have to temporarily save the ds segment register,
modify to point to the library's data segment, and then call strlen().

But as unpleasant as option (b) is, that still doesn't work in the
general case.  Consider a situation where shared library (a) Motif,
calls shared library (b) XFree86, which calls shared library (c) libc.
Now suppose that Motif passes a string from its data segment to Xfree86,
and Xfree86 wants to call strcmp on a string in Motif's data segment,
and with one in its data segement.  Thus, strlen would be asked to
compare strings in two different segements ---- hence, it must be
segment aware, and this requires compiler support.

Without compiler support, people who code shared libraries would have
to be very aware of the segmentation issues, since they would have to
handle them by hand --- just as we do in the kernel.  I doubt that would
be popular with applications programers.

A proper truncation script really should use  "file" or some other
appropriate tool to double-check that an *.o file is an *.o file, a
core is a core, etc.  It is pretty easy to do, although it is not as
easy as a simple find command in the root cronfile.

Ahem... if close() really doesn't return, a kill won't make any difference.

Anyway, a cursory look at 1.1.53 doesn't reveal any loops the close could
hang in.
Which kernel/sliplogin version are you using?

It compiles 'out of the box' under Linux... you basically un-tar it and do a

PGP is available at ftp.netcom.com in /pub/mpj, I believe...
Their is also a site at MIT, but I'm not entirely sure on that.

No cure for me, same results after a hard or soft reset...
This NE2000 card has been detected proprely with all previous
kernel versions...

I have been told that there is a conflict with the 3c503 driver,
and I use it since my other Linux box uses this card.

Anyway, this 1.1.53 is running on this second machine, a public
access Linux. And a few hours ago  I got a kernel panic on someone
logging with SLIP.  The syslog file unfortunately contains no
trace of this problem and I could not note it manually, I
remember it was a "kfree on non allocated memory", something
like that.

1.1.52 ran 17 days, with T'Tso tty and serial patches and the
Alpha ppp driver, with no problem... 1.1.53  hangs on detecting
ne2000 and panics... May be too many things have changed :-)

Subject: 8-bit colour ANSI and ncurses
Date: 12 Oct 1994 07:46:20 -0400

I am having some problems getting ncurses to display
semi-graphical characters on the Linux console.  I would like
to be able to use the same character set used by PC's running
ANSI.SYS for example.  ie. ASCII character 178 is a checkered
block.  When I output ASCII code 178 from my ncurses program
I do not get this checkered block.  Is it enough to simply kick
the console driver into its "acs" mode?  (Alternate Character Set)
And if so, how do I do that from within my program?  Perhaps I
need to use some raw 8-bit ncurses output mode?  I have been
unable to find anything related to this in the ncurses documentation.
Perhaps I can permanently replace my console character set with
a PC-like set?

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: 2nd RFD: comp.os.linux reorganization
Date: 14 Oct 1994 15:45:43 -0400

                     REQUEST FOR DISCUSSION (RFD)
                     comp.os.linux reorganization

Summary: An extensive reorganization of the comp.os.linux hierarchy is
         proposed.  It includes the creation of five unmoderated
         groups, the renaming of three unmoderated groups, and the
         creation of one moderated group.

Proponent: Dave Sill, de5@ornl.gov 

History: This proposed reorganization was prompted originally by the
         excessive level of traffic in comp.os.linux.help.  Following
         a straw poll conducted by the proponent, an RFD was posted
         for breaking comp.os.linux.help into various subgroups and
         creating comp.os.linux.answers for separating the
         documentation and announcements currently posted to
         comp.os.linux.announce.  During the discussion period, it
         became evident that it would be preferable to create the
         groups directly under comp.os.linux, rather than splitting
         comp.os.linux.help.  The previous RFD reflected that change.

         This revision of the RFD incorporates several other changes
         resulting from the previous 11 days of discussion.

1) Create group: comp.os.linux.advocacy (unmoderated)

 Charter: For discussion of the benefits of Linux compared to other
          operating systems.

2) Create group: comp.os.linux.answers (moderated)

 Charter: For posting Linux FAQs, How-To's, READMEs and other
          documents that answer questions about Linux.  This will
          help keep the traffic down in other c.o.l.* groups and will
          leave comp.os.linux.announce for true announcements.
          C.o.l.answers will be moderated by Matt Welsh
          (mdw@cs.cornell.edu), the moderator of c.o.l.announce.

3) Create group: comp.os.linux.development.apps (unmoderated)

 Charter: For questions and discussion regarding the writing of
          applications for Linux and the porting of applications to
          Linux.

4) Create group: comp.os.linux.hardware (unmoderated)

 Charter: For questions and discussion specific to a particular piece
          of hardware, e.g., "can this system run Linux?", "how do I
          use this disk drive with Linux?", etc.

5) Create group: comp.os.linux.networking (unmoderated)

 Charter: For questions and discussion relating to networking or
          communications including Ethernet boards, serial
          communications, SLIP, etc.

6) Create group: comp.os.linux.x (unmoderated)

 Charter: For questions and discussion relating to X Window System,
          version 11, compatible software including servers, clients,
          libraries, and fonts, running under Linux.  XFree86 issues
          not unique to Linux will be directed to
          comp.windows.x.i386unix.

7) Rename group: comp.os.linux.development (unmoderated)
             to: comp.os.linux.development.system (unmoderated)

 Charter: For questions and discussion regarding the development of
          the Linux operating system proper: kernel, device drivers,
          loadable modules.

8) Rename group: comp.os.linux.admin (unmoderated)
             to: comp.os.linux.setup (unmoderated)

 Charter: For questions and discussion relating to Linux installation
          and system administration.

 Rationale: "setup" is clearer than "admin", and is a more obvious
            place for installation questions.

9) Rename group: comp.os.linux.help (unmoderated)
             to: comp.os.linux.misc (unmoderated)

 Rationale: Comp.os.linux.help is too general.  It currently overlaps
            comp.os.linux.admin, and if the proposed groups are
            created, will overlap comp.os.linux.hardware and
            comp.os.linux.networking as well as comp.os.linux.setup.

      Note: The intent here is actually to remove comp.os.linux.help,
            not to rename it to .misc, which already exists.
            Unfortunately, it's not possible to remove it directly.

                                    c.o.l.x

After a discussion period of 21-30 days, if there are not overwhelming
objections to any of the proposed groups, there will be a Call For
Votes (CFV) posted to the groups as this RFD.  The voting period will
be at least 21 days.  Each proposal that passes, by receiving 100 more
YES votes than NO votes and twice as many YES votes as NO votes,
will be implemented.

I recently started to use hdparm to set the multiple sector count for my 
drive (a conner 540Meg EIDE drive with a max mlt of 128). With it set to 
0-32 no difference is noticed and I have a transfer rate (got via hdparm

with it set to 64 or 128 cpu usage drops to 40% but the transfer rate 
drops to about 1meg/sec.
Is the 90% cpu usage something to worry about? (the system is a p-90 512k

Subject: compiling modules for 1.1.52
Date: Thu, 13 Oct 1994 08:47:25 +0000

Hi,

   I tried to compile the example drv_hello module for my 1.1.52
kernel.  After a little tweeking (doesn't everyone keep their source
in /usr/src/linux rather than /linux?), I got it to compile.  However,
when I tried to insmod it, it complained that _kernel_version was
undefined.  In the end I got it to work by changing:

static char kernel_version[] = UTS_RELEASE;

to 

char kernel_version[] = UTS_RELEASE;

   Now it loads and runs fine ;-)  Was this the Right Thing To Do?
The other example modules all suffer from this problem.

Peace, Ben

You should be able to get it by opening the core image device (I don't
remember the name of it, /dev/kmem or /dev/mem or something like that.) and
then lseek'ing to the end and then looking at what byte offset position
you're at.

Or, open /proc/meminfo and parse it to find out the memory configuration.

There is a program called x11-graph which does the trick for me.
It's kinda old (at least the version I have is) but with minor
tweaks it works pretty well.  You'd have to archie to find it,
since I don't remember where I got mine (or I suppose I could

C++ added another comment convention for the reason that comments
terminated in newline tend to be a *lot* more convenient to use than
C-style block comments.  (You may disagree, but I am fairly certain
you are in minority).  /* ... */ is supported as backward
compatibility, but you will be hard-pressed to find a C++ programmer
who uses them more than once in a blue moon.
