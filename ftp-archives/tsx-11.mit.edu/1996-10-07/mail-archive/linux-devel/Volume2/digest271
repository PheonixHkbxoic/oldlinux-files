Subject: Linux For Mac
Date: 6 Oct 1994 18:05:41 GMT

I am in a process of acquiring new software packages for my MAC IIFX, i.e.
Apple Unix OS for Mac, and am wondering if there exists a linux for Mac.  
Of course, I would prefer to run linux on my Mac with X11 window than 
aplle OS.  Can someone please verify if there is an ongoing work about 
linux for mac?  I have seen people posting linux 68K which makes me 
wondering because mac also uses a 68k microprocessor.

Please kindly reply to me.  Thank you very much.

Subject: AT1700 ethernet driver (Fujitsu MB86965A)
Date: 06 Oct 1994 08:35:50 GMT


Hello all,

I tried compiling in the alpha AT1700 driver to see if it worked with
an on-board ethernet controller using the same chip (Fujitsu MB86965A).

During the boot it gave no messages at all relating to the ethernet
card, so I presume it is not recognized.

Any clues?


Thanks,

Harri

See /usr/src/linux/drivers/block/floppy.c there is 'some' support
for those drives already, at least on my 1.1.49. Haven't tried
them though.

Or buy one of those "air-duster" cans, take the drive out of the
computer, and blow all the dust out of it.  Does wonders for floppy
drives.  (if you've got an air compressor, you don't even need to
bother with buying the can)

  [Steven buytaert writes nothing !] OK, I'll try again...

  Ian, maybe it's not such a bad idea to make this into some sort
  of FAQ entry.

  Q. Are there some thread implementations for Linux ?
  A. Several, depending on what you want, are good
     candidates for thread implementations. Let's
     give some pointers shall we:

     - For an implementation based on the changing POSIX
     standard, try:
     sipb.mit.edu:/pub/pthreads OR
     toxicwaste:/pub/archive/pthreads
     Documentation for this implementation still isn't in
     the package, but you can get more information for it
     under HTTP://www.mit.edu:8001/people/proven/home_page.html

     - another implementation can be found at
     ftp://ftp.ibp.fr/pub/unix/threads/pthreads OR
     ftp://ftp.ibp.fr/pub/unix/threads/part which is situated
     in Florida for our overseas friends.

     - yet another implementation that should run out of the
     box on Linux, can be found at:
     ftp://rtfm.mit.edu /pub/pthreads


  So, I hope this helps. I know I tried some of them out of curiosity.
  Some of them are large implementations (#1 I think) some of them small.
  The first also contains, reentrable implementations of libc functions.
  Please, don't ask me for technical support; I only tried them, not
  used them as of yet.

Subject: kernel textmodes patch (long)
Date: Wed, 5 Oct 1994 15:54:10 GMT


This is a patch to the kernel (boot/setup.S) that adds some extra
VGA textmodes to the kernel boot menu. The patch is relative to
1.1.46; I don't know whether it can be applied cleanly to later
versions.

On any VGA compatible card, it adds the following modes to the default
set of 80x25/28/50 (which use a 400-scanline frame at 70 Hz):

80x36   11-line font, 70 Hz
80x44   9-line font, 70 Hz
80x30   16-line font, 480-scanline frame, 60 Hz
80x40   12-line font, 480-scanline frame, 60 Hz

Note that the 9, 11 and 12-line font modes are initialized with the
8-line font in the BIOS. You can load a better-matching font with
'setfont' in the kbd package. Look in /usr/lib/kbd/consolefonts.
There's at least one 10-line font there (latin2-10.psf), and two
12-line fonts (latin1-12.psf, latin2-12.psf). These fonts are 'roman'
-like and slightly irregular. Anyone know where to find more 12-line
VGA fonts? (I think some could be converted from X).

The 480-line frame looks better on most monitors, if you can accept 
the 60 Hz refresh. These modes should be especially useful for those
running a laptop screen with 480 scanlines, on which the default
400-line textmodes may leave part of the screen unused.

The patch also adds support for the following Cirrus 54xx textmodes
(the modes are derived from the 132x25 400-scanline BIOS mode):

132x25, 132x28, 132x36, 132x44, 132x50, 132x30, 132x40, 132x60.

The 30, 40, and 60 line modes use a 480 scanline frame at 60 Hz.
The patch contains some disabled code to obtain 100xY modes on
a Cirrus 54xx which doesn't work. I don't know whether the
"CL-GD54" ID check works on most 542x/3x cards. 

Feedback is appreciated. If these modes work correctly on various VGA
compatible screens, they could be considered for inclusion into the
standard kernel release.

Just run Linux as you would at any other time. It'll start using bounce 
buffers for DMA to/from 16Mb+ addresses.

Well, it is not always possible (and historically rarely possible)
to tell if a connection really deserved TOS queuing at high
priorities.  A couple expamples ... a terminal session being used
to 'download' a large file; a terminal emulator with a programable
interface (TN3270 w/Chameleon for NETMANAG or PC/3270 from IBM)
performing batch bulk transactions, file downloads, etc.

I've had the same problem with ntparadise.  However, I notice that if
I wait a few minuites befor pressing the "reset" I still hear a 
"sync" command running.  So the kernel is still running.  Since,
all term does is transmit data to the socket, even if term transmitted
random data and then hanged, everything else should not lockup...
Just like an ordinary user's process should never be able to crash
the kernel.  So, this can't be a term bug, so it is either an 
XFree bug or a kernel bug.  (Note: I didn't do anything spectacular
like changing my resolution, so I suspect that was just a convient
thing to get blaimed...)  I just upgraded to XFree86-3.1, and haven't
checked to see if this problem is still present.  Then again, I've
always figured that programs like xlock should not be able to work
without being SUID, since ordinary users should not be able to leave
the machine in a state that root can't restore from.  If they
can, it is a security bug.

If you were running on a 386 in protected mode with full segmentation
turned on, this would not be the case (32 bit long vs. 56-bit pointer).

Has anyone built a driver for the Comtrol Hostess 550 multiport
serial board? I see no mention of it in the serial HOWTO.

Would some kind soul please mail a copy to me.

Thanks in advance.
