The answer is YES for kernel version 1.1.37 and higher, and NO a special

Probably very little.

(I take it from 'no network' you mean "no intermediate network between
the PC and the Internet".)

If you're talking about MS-Windows, you probably have little to worry
about, provided you don't leave any listener processes up.  Now,
there's always the other issues, like if you're using a Web browser
which isn't well-behaved, etc etc.  But you make backups regularly,
don't you?  :-)

If you're talking about Linux, then it's been done.  Things like
tcp_wrappers, TIS' fwtk, SOCKS, screend, turn off unused daemons, bla
bla bla....

If you have Linux users who don't want this extra work, how'd the heck
did you convince them to use Linux?  :-)

a few suggestions that might work:

1) if your BIOS supports it, set your machine to boot from the hard drive.
   Then leave a floppy in the drive all the time :)

2) if your BIOS doesn't support this, leave a floppy *almost* in the drive
   all the time (i.e. sticking out 1/2 inch for 3.5", leave the door open
   for 5.25" :)

The ZyXEL modems have a data throughput averaging mode which can be disabled.
With averaging off, you could get very high data bursts at times from the
modem. They recommend only turning it off if you have a 16550 UART. This
sounds like what you need, although I have done background ftp with it on
and have not noticed any slowdown (I do have a 16550).

Definately no. Xaw is an excellent example of this. When did you last
use an Xaw based client which was consistent with the look and feel of
other Xaw clients?

Xaw lacks a style-guide and programs of more than trivial complexity
look and feel completely different. This makes them, among other
things, hard to learn, but often hard to use as well.

Motif is based on the CUA ("Common User Access"). The CUA defines
user-interface paradigms for a certain feel, based on human-factors
and man-machine oriented research. The look isn't specified by the
CUA.

When you say Motif doesn't have it's own feel, you're right to a
certain extent; both Mickeysoft Windows and OS/2 Presentation Manager
use the CUA as a foundation for their user interface as well. Motif
doesn't have it's own proprietary feel, right, but the authours didn't
forget to make one, as you seem to suggest. Proprietary feels are
generally bad.

Christian

Subject: PHILIPS 521 CD-R / Generic SCSI support question
Date: 5 Oct 1994 00:26:12 -0400

Recently I posted on the `less expert' channels that I have had to do some
pretty serious backflips without any success in attempt to write CD-ROMs
on my PHILIPS 521 writer.  I'd like to find a FAQ or some sort of
instruction on how to get (I believe Eric Youngdale's) `cdwrite' software
to write CD-Rs in Linux.

My apologies for intervening on the expert channel to get this answered,
but I'm really stuck on this.

A response to my original posting was:

>since you don't say which problems you have building a new kernel, it's 
>hard to say. compiling a new kernel really is straight forward (more or
less).

In /usr/src/linux-1.0.9 I did `make config' and selected SCSI generic,
tape, sr0, and disk driver support for my 1542C, disabling all other SCSI
host options.  I have a SMC 16 bit ethernet card which I enabled in the
driver, and the rest of the options are straightforward 486DX33 16MB RAM
selections.  

>IF you have a kernel with `GENERIC SCSI SUPPORT' I'll give you two tips:

Yes, I have this.

>- change the vendor string "PHILLIPS" to "IMS"  in the cdwrite sources

I have done this because `dmesg' shows this as the return of an inquiry
string from the SCSI driver at bootup.  Thanks.

. 
I had to :                cd /dev; MAKEDEV sg 

to make the nodes.  Can you look at the major and minor numbers on your
functioning cdwrite setup and e-mail them to me please?

 it made nodes like `crw- --- ---' (OK - I'm root) for /dev/sga (my only
SCSI partition /dev/sda1)
and `crw- --- ---' for /dev/sgb (the device I assume to be my Philips
Writer.)

The commands I tried to use were 
         cdwrite -speed 1 /dev/sgb < iso.image
                        and 
         chmod 777 iso.image cdwrite /tmp ./ 


cdwrite returns ` [empty] not a supported device' as if the SCSI inquiry
failed.

When  I try to `cat foo > /dev/sgb' it returns `permission denied'
                
Please reply to these questions vi e-mail.  I'll post a summary of
relevant details in comp.os.dev... or somewhere useful.  

I'm developing a few other useful premastering tools and I'll be happy to
send them gratis if you'll help get me through this rough spot.

Thank you in advance,

First let me state that I am NOT an expert on SCSI.  That been said, I 
was talking to a guy the other day that was telling me about something 
called Near Perfect something-or-other.  It's a termination technique of 
some kind that would replace resistors.  With this he indicated that he 
had hooked up SCSI chains with seven devices 60-70 feet long.  Needless 
to say, this could cast a new light on this discussion.  Does anyone know 
about this stuff, and if so, is this accurate?  Is there a way to route 
packets via two controllers in one machine?  SCSI routers... sounds 
weird.  What kind of bandwidth are we talking here?

I can't quite agree on this, since I use fvwm every day. It has motif style
decorations, and to my knowledge does it also understand the motif api
decoration and menu function hints. And if there is something wrong, you
could allways hack the code....

Date: Fri, 7 Oct 1994 00:12:29 GMT

I'm not a tcp/ip wizard but I tell my experiences here:

Some people in our department asked for slip under MS windows at home.
So I installed the shareware Trumpet winsock software. To my surprise
this worked very good, well at least comparable with SLIP under Linux.
My surprise was even bigger that no latency effects are observed
using Ftp of big files and telnet interactive sessions.
All of you know what kind of SHELL ms windows is: fire up a bogus app
and you have to redial to get a new connection, so Linux is for me
always the way to go.

But the fact that latency is absent with trumpet winsock unders MS windows
makes it clear to me that latency-free SLIP must be possible for Linux.

also do a 'make mrproper' before you try to compile the first time (at least

ok. this seems like a nice thread. i can only say the same things, too
(except that X-prob). i also think, that linux is a big step into the right
direction (breaking up software monopolies, and so on), and i also think,
that it open s up a way for priivate people (who cannot afford sco or
something similar) to get internet access (which should not be denied to
anyone)..

Of course another solution, which could be more efficient when you compile
and link many modules together, would be to put the functions that are now
unresolved in the C library as well.  A program compiled with no optimization
would just call these functions automatically.

I believe the FAQ of bsd in the comp.os.bsd.announce newsgroup
contains a pretty fair text comparing Linux and *BSD. I believe
it was in section 2.1 of this FAQ. Sorry, but I'm too lazy to
look for this text right now (the main problem is, I don't remember
how to get old, already read articles with xrn...).

The main result was (if I'm right):
  If you have a small (harddisk and memory), stand-alone machine --
use Linux.
  If you have a machine connected to a network with much network
travel -- use BSD.
  If you are still unshure -- use whatever system your friends use.

Hope it helps, Leif
