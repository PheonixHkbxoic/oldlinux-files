And, I imagine, somebody will probably tackle the job once those
multiprocessor boards (or systems) become more of a commodity.

It is not a trivial job to turn a kernel designed for one processor into
a kernel which can really do a good job of handling multiple processors.
You end up having to add a lot of semaphore locking/unlocking code.
Getting it to work cleanly, reliably, and efficiently is a lot of work.

Some drivers only request interrupts when they are opened, and release
them when closed. An example is the floppy driver, which uses interrupt
6, but only requests the interrupt (request_irq()), while a floppy is
open. Hence IRQ 6 does not appear in /proc/interrupts (except whil
accessing the floppy). I have not
checked if this is the case with the lp driver.

This is a good thing, in that it allows different
devices to use the same interrupts (if used at different times).
However, it reduces the usefulness of the /proc/interrupts file.

There may be some usefulness in device drivers registering with the
kernel what resources (irq,dma,port addresses,shared memory) the
software and hardware use. This useful system config information could
then be made available in the /proc filesystem. I have several cards and
device drivers installed on my system, and it would be nice to find a
/proc entry to find free irqs, dma channels and port adresses for
instaling new cards on the system. It would make managing many Linux
boxes in a laboratory type situation a lot easier (particularly if you
have device drivers which auto detect the hardware, but don't
permanently grab the IRQ).

I may just look into it :-). Any suggestions or comments welcome.

As I understand it, all combinations letter+diacritic(s) that already
have a code point in some existing standard coding also got a code point
in Unicode, in order to make 1-1 conversions to and from this earlier
standard possible. In all (other) cases Unicode represents letter+diacritic
as a sequence of two or more symbols, that is, the diacritics are treated
as separate non-spacing characters that follow the base symbol.

That is why in the UTF-8 encoding of Unicode no ASCII symbol can occur
as part of another symbol. This solves both the NUL and the / problems.

I hope to release a new kbd-0.** this month. It will contain a kernel
patch with some Unicode support. (Just a start. The fonts are still
missing, but loadkeys will be able to assign 16-bit values to the keys,
and the keyboard driver will have a UTF-8 mode converting these 16-bit
values into byte sequences.)

Apparently you are not reading this group for more than about two weeks,
or you would have caught one one of the *many many* threads about SMP Linux
that have been here before.

The answer to your question is: because it is *complicated*.  it sure isn't
impossible, but the fact that IBM have been able to do it in a multi-man-year
project is of hardly any relevance to the Linux developer world, I think.

I use a card with three of these, and one of my ports runs at 76800 bps
to my modem.  flowcontrol works perfectly.

There was a recent change to eliminate a flow control bug (although I
did not see that one on my system, many others didn't have problems,
some people did)

IPX routing is fully documented by Novell.  Much of it is already

I don't know what you mean by "the ARP module", but what is broken is
only the printout.  It will be solved by updating your network utilities.
ARP itself works okay, and there is nothing to worry about.
It broke when the format of /proc/net/arp was changed.

Hi,

Can anyone tell me what the status of each of Mac Linux and PowerPC Linux

new had been posted. Is Mac Linux dead? How about PPC? Is it up and running
to any extent?

Thanks in advance,

I haven't heard any progress reports about the Linux/68k port to the

I can confirm that this bug is not restricted to 82077 controllers.  I

some disks:
             fdformat /dev/fd0H1440
             mke2fs /dev/fd0
             <remove disk>
will result in a disk with an invalid e2fs file system on my machine.

The bug appears to be one of not flushing data to the disk.  It doesn't
appear to happen with mkfs or dd.
