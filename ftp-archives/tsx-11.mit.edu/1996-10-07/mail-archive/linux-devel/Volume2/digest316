The KarlBridge software (which turns a DOS-type box into a pretty
reasonable filtering Ethernet bridge) actually contains some code which
"burps" the diskette drive for a second or so every hour or two, just to
[1] make sure that it's still working and [2] keep the "gets gunky and
freezes up if it isn't used for a few weeks" problem from occurring.

Stable operating systems don't kill drives - they just allow them to die
of boredom ;-}

Subject: DAT filesystem..?
Date: 16 Oct 1994 04:20:09 GMT


Any real reason one could not write a driver to use a DAT that will
seek like a disk?  i.e. be able to mount it, etc?  Perhaps set it up
WORM to avoid fragmentation, which would be deadly.. ;-)   This
would seem like a handy thing to be able to do.   Mine seems to seek
reasonably quickly, and the throughput is not bad--it'd be nice to be
able to mount one's backups to grab stuff with cp...  

I assume that doing it WORM would simplify things quite a lot...  no need to
worry about handling fragmentation, just tack new stuff onto the end..

If nobody has considered this, I might want to try it.  I was thinking
about just writing a frontend for dds2tar that sort of faked this, but
a real DAT filesystem sort of appeals to me.  The things are fast 
enough that one could reasonably use it for things like an FTP server--the
directory info could stay in RAM and users requesting a file on DAT would
enter a queue to wait for their file to be copied to disk, so we
could avoid trying to have multiple folks seeking around the tape (ouch!).

Perhaps this could be implemented with the userfs stuff? (which I
know nothing about..)

Subject: Chaning text mode after bootup
Date: Sun, 16 Oct 1994 03:59:30 GMT

After seeing the nifty new patch to 1.1.54 I worked on being able to set
my text mode at run time and have enjoyed limited success (scripts and
C program follow).  I can now switch between 80x25, 80x28 and 80x50
freely.  However when it comes to 132x25 it just doesn't go.  After
booting in 132x25 and then trying to switch back to 80x25 my screen
goes on the fritz.  I am using an ATI VGA Wonder (V5) video card.  If
anyone can tell me how to switch to and from 132x25 and any other video
modes I would be most appreciative.

Ok so for anyone that would like to at least switch to and from 80x25
and 80x50 here is what I have.  Limitiations
    - security, ha what security.  This is bad
    - you have to boot up in every one of the video modes that you want
      to use and save the required registers and font
    - all vts go at the same time.  I don't think that this can be easily
      fixed as the console driver does not appear to do any restoration
      on vt switches, rather it hopes that there is a process that will
      do it for it.  The VC_RESIZE call also effects all vts

Here is the main C program, install it suid root (actually just needs to
be able to open all of the consoles read/write, read is probably enough)

#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <linux/vt.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <termios.h>

#define CONSOLE_PREFIX "/dev/tty"
#define CONSOLE_MAX 8
#define CONSOLE_NAME_LEN 40

int main (int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[])

{
   int fd, count; 
   char conname[CONSOLE_NAME_LEN];
   struct vt_sizes vts;
   struct winsize ws;

   if (argc != 3) {
      fputs("Wrong cols rows\n",stderr);
      exit(1);
   }
   fd = open(CONSOLE_PREFIX "0",O_RDWR);
   if (fd == -1) {
      perror("Couldn't open console (should be suid root, sorry)");
      exit(2);
   }
   vts.v_cols = atol(argv[1]);
   ws.ws_col = vts.v_cols;
   vts.v_rows = atol(argv[2]);
   ws.ws_row = vts.v_rows;
   vts.v_scrollsize = 0;  /* currently ignored */
   ws.ws_xpixel = ws.ws_ypixel = 0;
   ioctl(fd,VT_RESIZE,&vts);
   close(fd);

   for (count = 1; count <= CONSOLE_MAX; count++) {
      sprintf(conname,"%s%d",CONSOLE_PREFIX,count);
      fd = open(conname,O_RDWR);
      if (fd == -1) {
         perror("Couldn't open console (should be suid root, sorry)");
         exit(2);
      }
      ioctl(fd,TIOCSWINSZ,&ws);
      close(fd);
   }
   return 0;
}

Put this in a directory with the following shell scripts
#!/bin/bash
dname=${1}x${2}
restorefont -r $dname/font
restoretextmode -r $dname/mode
./vcresize $1 $2

and
#!/bin/bash
dname=${1}x${2}
rm -rf $dname
mkdir $dname
restorefont -w $dname/font
restoretextmode -w $dname/mode


This is using the restorefont and restoretextmode programs that come with
svgalib and in my slackware 2.0 seem to be setup as suid root.

I hope to release Turbo-Filter for Linux, Coherent,
SCO, and BSD in December, 1994.  Its compatable
with CompuTrac, Metastock, CSI, Ascii, and .PRO
formats.  Its a futures/stock filtering/ranking
package that allows you to define criteria's for
tracing, and executes the technical analysis 
studies you indicate on mass data.

Technical studies include:

        ATR, MACD, ROC, RSI, %k%D, %k%sD, Momemtum, Moving Averages,
        Commodity Channel Index, and many many more.

If you would like more info, please send me email at fabius@icsi.net

I'm not trying to soliciate directly, I just realize that theres not
much applications for Linux and I want everyone to realize that 
there are people who know Linux is just a good operating system as
some of the high-priced ones.  Certainly beats the hell out of 
MS-DOS!

Il lcheck this monday in our Annotated Spec at work, and I coudl be quite 
wrong, but I THOUGHT macros are defined as compilre constructs, whereas 
comments are defined as C syntax.  I coudl be wrong abotu the 
destinction, but thats what i thought I remembered.

How a compiler actually implements them is not really an issue 9after 
all, a really WIERD compiler could compiel to Pascal code, but it would 
still be a compiler and coudl still be ANSI compatable...)

I can compile all previous kernels up to 1.1.53. Applying the patch54.gz
leads to that fatal situtation. It happens also when I disable ELF during
the 'make config'. The compiler is 2.5.8. Is 1.1.54 supposed to work with
that compiler? BTW, no other patches applied. I did generate the source
tree from plain 1.1.0 by applying all 54 patches and nothing else.
