Hello,
I just encountered a serious problem with the GreenPC functions of
my new motherboard:
I loose a partition, if I do the following:
1) set HDD Power Down to 1 Minute in the BIOS (SiS 471/ AWARD)
2) Boot Linux, all partitions on /dev/hda
3) mkfs.ext2 /dev/hdb2; mount /dev/hdb2 /mnt; cp .bashrc /mnt
4) work on hda until hdb is powered down (I always wondered how this
    works with Linux)
5) shut down the system.
   I get the message '/dev/hda: reset multiple mode to 0' when
   hdb is powered up again and /dev/hdb2 is unmounted.
6) reboot. The first sectors of /dev/hdb2 will be garbage.

My configuration: Linux-1.1.49, 2 Conner HDs (IDE), drive hdb is a Conner
   CP 30204. Both drives are initialized to 16 sectors multiple mode.
   Motherboard: Sis 471, Award BIOS.

Can this be a hardware fault, or is it a software problem?
I don't know if this a problem with other operating systems too,
since I am using only Linux (and NEVER lost a partition in the last
2 years)

      Desperately,
                       Michael

Reply-To: blong@uiuc.edu

With kernel version greater than 1.1.45, all with Voxware 2.90-2,
(486/33, libc4.5.26, 16mb, PAS16)
I've been getting the following message after approx. 3 seconds of play:
Sound: DMA timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error?
/dev/dsp: I/O error

So, I started playing with my IRQ settings, figuring I just forgot whats 
on what.  No go.  So I tried only using the pas16, without the soundblaster
emulator.  Again, no go.  So i booted an older kernel I had on my system
(1.1.16) and sound worked just fine.  I tried 1.1.52 with the same sound
setup (dma/irq assigments, and only pas16) and it still errored out.

1.1.16 had voxware 2.5a (according to /dev/sndstat).

Obviously a lot has changed since 1.1.16-1.1.52 and 2.5a-2.90.  Has the 
PAS support been broken?

Thanks
Brandon

Also, to Apple "open" may mean that they'll license parts of their OS

Subject: SOCK_INODE(sk->socket)->i_uid sometimes wrong
Date: 9 Oct 1994 22:10:26 +0100

Hi!

        This happens with Linux 1.1.49 and 1.1.51.

        I am an author of an ip accounting software and i have
        noticed that the value of SOCK_INODE(sk->socket)->i_uid
        is sometimes wrong. This can be seen via netstat (which states
        the wrong user) or via wrong accounting information.
        The problem only seems to be triggered if there is a lot
        of traffic on a specific socket (for example an ftp-data
        connection) _and_ netstat respectively my accounting programm
        is called. I have put some printks in the relevant places
        which print out the user id and the pointer to the inode.
        This pointer gets corrupted as it seems. It's value
        suddenly changes if netstat or my accounting programm is
        called. How can this happen? The only thing, that netstat and
        my programm do, is that they read the value of 
        SOCK_INODE(sk->socket)->i_uid (netstat via access to /proc/net/tcp).

        Any help is greatly appreciated!

        Lars.

Is there a system call which returns the number of pages of physical memory a

In Solaris, the system call sysconf(_SC_PHYS_PAGES) gives me the number I'm

The root disk doesn't change -- just use the standard one.

Making a Slackware bootdisk is a bit tricky; an easier way to get a
bootable disk is just to dd it to a floppy disk (dd if=file
of=/dev/fd0 bs=9216), or getting SYSLINUX
from eecs.nwu.edu:/pub/linux/syslinux/syslx101.zip.

Nagle's algorithm says that there can only be one outstanding small
segment that has not been acked.  So however long it takes for
an ack to get back, that is how much data you can get (well,
up to a point I'm sure).  The point of Nagle's alg is to get
more data across the link in less packets by reducing the number of
1 byte packets.  ACKs usually get picked up on the characters'
echo.

This can be done as a daemon, without modifying any filesystem code.

Write a daemon that reads a configuration file to figure out "low
space" thresholds for each partition, and "temporary file extensions",
possibly also partition dependant.  Possibly also put in a "degree of
temporary-ness" for each file extension -- eg. "keep *.o files for a
week, keep *~ files for three days (so they survive weekends), but
nuke #*# files in just one day".

Every night, run a cron job to build a table of existing "temporary
files", with their last modification date.

When a given partition goes below the specified amount of free space,
the daemon "wakes up".  It goes through the table of existing files,
looking for the "most deletable" (ie. oldest that have gone beyond
their minimum time threshhold) ones.  It checks them to see if they've
changed since last night's cron job, and if not, nukes 'em.  Iterate
until you've got enough free space.

Who would want to install such a thing on their systems?  Show me
there's enough demand and I may write it.

I am not sure that hdparm is as good as it claims to be.  I was
fooling around with it, and my results were not encouraging.

I tried setting my multcount to 16, which is the max value for my disk
according the the kernel at bootup.  I also tried 2, 4, and 8.  My
benchmark was the suggested "dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/null count=32768
bs=1024".  When the multcount was set to anything but 0, system and
user time went down, but wall-clock time went up.  This was under
kernels 1.1.51 and 1.1.52.

Here are some figures I got, which I found to be fairly consistant:

multcount       user    system  clock   %CPU
0               0.21    20.69   0:46.74 44.7
2               0.34    21.53   0:47.69 45.8
4               0.37    18.75   0:49.94 38.2

16              0.29    12.37   1:10.55 17.9

I'd rather have the wall-clock time, personally... :)

And this is the cannonical case of why c++ is NOT a true super-set of 
ANSI c.  (Thanks, I'm going to save the exampel for the next time I have 
THAT argument.)

Question, though, if gcc is fed a c++ file, will it accept that (a .C 
extension, or one of the other  gcc/g++ blessed c++ extensions)?

Seems to me it should.  The answer to the poster woudl then be 'Youa re 
trying to write c++ code.  Stop telling the compiler its C code, and all 
will be fine...'

I was guessing that the receive buffer was acting as a router that

However, I've heard that some other folks without buffered modems
have the same problem, so that's probably not it.

Increase the baud rate?  Huh? How?  It is already at spd_hi.  With
round trip times of 2000 to 3000ms I don't think I'm just waiting for
30 characters...  I don't know if you realize this, this thread
was started by someone complaining about the abnormal interactive 
responce times /during background ftp transfers/.  If you use
SLIP or PPP can you say that you don't get 2-3 sec delays (you
can modify ping to get this) for interactive traffic.

If your slip server has a queue of ftp packets to send you, it should
be thowing your interactive packet at the front of the queue.
Or if you are sending and you have a full buffer of interactive
packets, your interactive packet should go to the front of your
queue.

This is done!  In 1.1.52, check out net/inet/dev.c and ip.c.

I don't have this option.

I tried this to no avail.

I've tried down to 100.
