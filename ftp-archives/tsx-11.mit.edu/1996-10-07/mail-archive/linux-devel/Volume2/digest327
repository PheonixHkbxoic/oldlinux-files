0. Introduction/contents
========================

This is the first version of the Linux68k FAQ. As it will probably be full of
errors (typographical and logical), outdated and missing infos, *YOU* are
encouraged to send feedback and corrections to jmayer@informatik.uni-kl.de.
It is not intended to describe what Unix is or how to to administrate it.
Parts of this document were snarfed from Helmut Neukirchen's Linux68k WWW page

1. About Linux and Linux68k
===========================
Linux is a freely available operating system for PCs - to be more precise,
it is one of many flavours of Unix. It is being developed on the net by
several thousand people and tested/used by many many more.
The fun and success of Linux inspired some people to port it to another
platform - the Amiga. The first version released to the general public was
005. While 008 was current, a few enthusiasts ported that version to the Atari
and the two versions have been successfully (?) merged with 09pl3 (this
reads version 09 patchlevel 3). Linux68k can be regarded as beta. This means
that code that wasn't ported/written recently works well most of the time.

2. Requirements to run Linux68k
===============================
You need a Motorola 680x0 processor *with PMMU*. There is *no way* to run
it without one. This reduces the list of possible processors to
68020+68851, 68030, 68040, 68LC040, 68060. Currently only the 68030 and 68040
are supported (rumor has it that someone is it running on 68020+68851). At
this stage you will also need a 68881 or 68882 FPU if you don't have a 68040.
A FPU is not strictly neccessary as it can be emulated with the normal
processor, however nobody has written the code to do so.
The list of processors leaves the 68000, 68010, 68EC020, 68EC030, 68EC040.
Linux68k will *never* run on these processors as they lack a PMMU and an
interface for an external one.
If you want to do more than just boot Linux68k you will need 30 - oo (infinity)
MB of harddiskspace an a supported hard disk controller.

3. Similarities and differences between Amiga and Atari Linux68k
=================================================================
3.1 Similarities
================
All code that is dependent on the processor only (e.g. paging, systemcalls,
parts of the interrupt handling and of c(o)urse those parts of Linux that
were handoptimized by writing the code in assembler) has to be ported to
Linux68k only once. This means that Amiga and Atari may use the same kernel-
image (in fact the vmlinux from tsx-11 runs on both machines).
Another big bonus is that all userprograms (= binaries) should run on
any machine running Linux68k no matter whether the machine is an Amiga
or Atari - as long as no machine specific devices are used (see below).

3.2 Differences
===============
All code that depends on the hardware is machine dependant and with very
few exceptions which are in the kernel (timer, small part of interrupt
handling, startup code) put into modules called devicedrivers. The writing
of devicedrivers makes up most of the porting work.

4. The current status of Linux68k
=================================
4.1 General
===========
What has been done? The kernel (this means all the processor/mmu/fpu specific
stuff) has been ported. Version 09 is based on the Linux 1.0 patchlevel 9
sources. Several hardware-independend devices have been ported:
Ramdisk, mem, pty, tty, vt, slip, net/inet, general scsi stuff. Also the fol-
lowing filesystems have been done: minix, ext2, msdos, proc, isofs, nfs, affs
( = Amiga Fast File System, read only).
On the mailinglist but not yet in the kernel: Virtual consoles

4.2 Amiga
=========
Supported builtin hardware:
A3000-SCSI, A4000-IDE, serial port, parallel port, mouse, keyboard, graphics
emulates an ascii-terminal (resolution varies with your chipset/setup), timer,
floppy disk drive (DD and HD, Amiga-formatted disks only).

Supported cards:
Several SCSI cards are supported. These are the A2091, A590 and GVP Series II.
To find out if additional hardware is supported look at the Linux68k source
(config.in provides a list of supported hardware).

4.3 Atari
=========
Atari-SCSI interface (ACSI), mouse, serial port, keyboard, timer [there are
some TOS-specific problems with the date], floppy disk drive, graphics
emulates an ascii-terminal (resolution varies with your chipset/setup)

4.4 Mac
=======
From time to time someone posts on the net that he is working on a port. There
is no confirmed sighting of such a thing (i.e. nothing ftp-able). One reason
for this may be that there are no hardware docs available.

5. Hints on installing Linux68k
===============================
[If someone is willing to write something more complete/comprehensible I will
happily replace this section.]
 1. Get a working kernel, *all* announce files and the boostrap program for
   your machine (different kernel versions may require different bootstrap
   versions), the root and usr-filesystems and the newfilesys (this is a
   ramdisk that contains everything you will need to setup a working harddisk
   environment). Sources for these programs: See below.
 2. Bootstrap the kernel and newfilesys as described in the ANNOUNCE file for
   that kernel. Many of the bootstrap flags available will be documented in
   older announce files only.
 3. Create a partition on your harddisk and install an ext2fs filesystem on it.
 4. Crate another partition as swapspace.
 5. Unpack the root and usr filesystem onto the disk.
 6. Copy the contents of your ramdisk to your harddisk. This replaces several
    old programs in root and usr with newer (working) versions.
 7. If /etc/termcap does not exist get (see below) and install it.
 8. Reboot
 9. Bootstrap your kernel, this time from harddisk instead of ramdisk.
These are the filenames relative to 680x0/
  ANNOUNCE-0.XXXXXX
  filesys/new-filesys.gz
  filesys/root.tar.gz
  filesys/usr.tar.gz
  kernel/vmlinux-0.9pl3.gz
  kernel/amiboot-1.9.gz
  kernel/ataboot-0.2.gz
  [I don't know a ftp site where you can find /etc/termcap, so you have to get
   it via Helmut Neukirchen's WWW pages.]
   
6. Sources for information/sources/binaries
===========================================
6.1 Newsgroups
==============
comp.os.linux.development: This group is on Linux development in gerneral.
  From time to time it contains messages dealing with Linux68k.
comp.os.linux.announce: This group announces new Linux related products as
  well as new kernelreleases. Announcements for new versions of Linux68k
  can be found here.
maus.os.linux68k: [This newsgroup may not be available outside Germany.]
  This group deals with Linux68k only. The language currently used is German
  but don't hesitate to post in English.
  It should be available at least at the following sites:
        news.uni-stuttgart.de
        rz.uni-karlsruhe.de
        xlink.net
        howland.reston.ans.net
        news.uni-oldenburg.de
        rz.uni-hildesheim.de
  [Has anyone checked whether these sites allow external access?]
comp.unix.amiga: This group is for diskussions on AMIX, NetBSD and Linux68k
  on the Amiga. As most articles on Linux68k are not Amiga specific, the
  name is somewhat of a misnomer.


6.2 Mailinglists
================
I am aware of one mailinglist for Linux68k. This is the 680x0 channel of
linux-activists. To find out how to subscribe send an empty mail to
linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi. The channel you want to join is
680x0. Keep the help file! In order to unsubscribe you will want to read the
help file again. The articles on this list are currently mirrored on
maus.os.linux68k.

6.3 WWW-sites
=============
Helmut Neukirchen's Linux68k WWW page:
  http://www-users.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~hn/linux68k.html
Mirror of tsx-11 via WWW:
  http://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/packages/Linux/tsx-11-mirror/680x0/

6.4 Ftp-sites
=============
THE Linux68k server:
  ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/680x0/
Mirrors of it (please use the one nearest to you, most of these mirrors
are updated daily):
  ftp://ftp.tu-clausthal.de/pub/systems/Linux/680x0/
  ftp://ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/pub/comp/os/linux/680x0/
  ftp://ftp.twi.tudelft.nl/pub/Linux/680x0/
  ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/Linux/BETA/680x0/
THE two Linux servers (sources for you to port to/compile on Linux68k):
  ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/sources/
  ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/
The kernel source for Linux68k can be found in 680x0/src/, a lot of
binaries in 680x0/bin/. A few more tools reside in 680x0/tools/.

6.4.1 Distributions
===================
None (yet).

7. Activities
=============
7.1 Coordinator
===============
Linux68k releases are built and released by Hamish Macdonald (his e-mail is
hamish@border.ocunix.on.ca). Built means that you write a patch against the
current version/patchlevel and he will integrate it into the next release.
Well, at least that is how it should be - very often he has to write the
stuff too (Amiga only, the Atarists are a lot more active these days).
If you want your patches to be generally available rather than waiting for
Hamish to integrate them: Post them to the 680x0 channel of linux-activists
at least. Hamish has his own pace at doing releases. So read my lips:-)
*Don't push him!*

7.2 Under construction/To do
============================
[Your call for coworkers could be found here. I would like to have a list of
not yet ported filing systems and needed drivers here.]
- X-server for Amiga: Contact Martin Apel (apel@physik.uni-kl.de) if and only
  if you really want to help (there is *no* use in asking/pushing him).
  He is currently searching for someone who can explain the workings of the
  console/tty/vt stuff to him to get the keyboard-input running.
- Affs: Write code and special root block handling missing.
- Documentation: A Linux68k update of the khg (Kernel hackers guide) needs to
  be written (especially the mmu specific stuff).
...

8. Famous last words
====================
Amiga, Atari, Unix and perhaps some more words I used in this text are
trademarks. So what!

Date: 17 Oct 1994 20:58:13 GMT

Hi.

Since there is practically no solution of the newbies' question of 
"Which is better, A or B ?",
how about creating a new newsgroup, say,  "comp.os.free-unices.dicuss"
or something like that ?
Whenever a newbie comes and ask the similar question,
we just refer to the newsgroup.

One caveat is that the news group will tend to be "comp.os.free-unices.flame",
but at least flames wars in *bsd / *linux* newsgroups can be
filtered out into that newsgroup.

Also, if there are enough people who want to constructive,
the newsgroup can be used as a communication medium among the
different unices' developers, for getting recent informations of other
unices and thus improving their own unix.

I am sure that if you just leave as it is now,
the flame wars won't stop.  Newbies come and will keep asking questions.
Other semi-newbies will answer, and ... you know ...

Just a thought ...

Well, that's what you get when you buy the newest hardware. I got a ATI
Graphics Pro Turbo with the Mach64 chip and svgalib is obviously not 
supporting it. Is someone working on a driver ? Does svgalib support the
ATI VGA Wonder ? 'Cause then there might be a workaround like with the 
tweaked XF_SVGA-Server where they only changed the recognition and 
initializition (I guess). Or maybe there's only some minor changes that 
have to be made to the Mach32-driver ? I wonder.

Yes, you can use the gpm mouse server, it's available in

Hello,

I'd like to poll current linux users and developers:  is anyone currently
using a fast/wide scsi card with linux (20mb/sec)?  If so, please let me
know:

1) what card you are using,
2) what driver runs this card,
3) any special hacks to make it work?
4) your opinion on performance,
5) how robust is your combination,
6) if you're a developer, any and all comments/recommendations are welcome.

I have a need for speed for my app, so I'll likely get a 3 channel raid 
controller and a pair of Seagate's barracuda drives.

Please reply by email.  If there is interest, I'll post a summary of
responses.

Thanks!

Reply-To: mummert+@cs.cmu.edu


In order to test/evaluate an ATM adapter card we need to write a
device driver for a Gateway 2000 P5-90 machine.  Currently, we're
trying to choose an appropriate OS on which to develop/test the
device driver.  The aforementioned card is a PCIbus based design.

How complete is the Linux PCIbus support?  Are the PCIbios calls
supported?  How difficult is it to configure the PCIbus device
and to memory map the device address spaces?  Is there any documentation/
skeletal drivers available on developing PCIbus device drivers for Linux?

Subject: INFO: IO port access
From: riku.saikkonen@compart.fi (Riku Saikkonen)
Date: Mon, 17 Oct 94 21:26:00 +0200

A number of people have been asking for this...

To use IO ports in C programs:
1. #include <asm/io.h>
2. Call ioperm(port,num,1) at somewhere near the start of the program
(before accessing ports).
3. Access ports using value=inb(port) and outb(value,port) (note the
order of the parameters). Look into asm/io.h for more system calls.
4. Call ioperm(port,num,0) at somewhere near the end of the program
(after all port accesses).
5. Compile your code with -O2 or a higher number, and no -g. (Sorry, you
can't debug...)
6. The executable has to be setuid root.

ioperm() syntax (also see the man page):
The first parameter is the port number to set permissions of.
The second parameter is the number of consecutive ports to set
permissions of (i.e. if num==3, port, port+1, and port+2 are set).
The third parameter is 1 to give the program permissions or 0 to remove
them.

Not too difficult... By the way, if anyone wants to add this to a FAQ or
HOW-TO, feel free (but contact me first).

Subject: SB16 & Mitsumi CDRom & 3c509 conflicts???
Date: Mon, 17 Oct 1994 16:59:44 -0400

I'd been running Linux 1.1.54 successfully, with no problems for a
while, until I installed a Sound Blaster 16.  Now, the system has all of
a sudden gotten extremely flakey.  Booting up with device drivers for
all three compiled in causes, after the startup line of "Going
Multiuser" lines saying stuff like
SCIOsomething or other: Try again
SCIOblabla: network is unreachable
SCIOblabla: network is unreachable
after which none of the networkign stuff works.  The oddest thing is is
that I had it all working fine for several days, and all of a sudden, it
just started quitting.  It has booted successfully a few times.  Another
extremely odd thing: If I boot off an emergency disk I made from 1.1.45
a while ago, it works fine, but if I try to compile 1.1.45 now and run
it off my hard disk with lilo, the same errors come up.  This had me
completely baffled.  I finally in desperation tried NOT compiling in the
support for the Mitsumi CD-Rom and it works all of a sudden!  Can anyone
offer any insight into this?  My system setup is as follows:
Gateway P5-60 and lots of stuff which probably doesnt matter
3c509 10baseT ethernet card
    Base:0x300
     IRQ:10

Mitsumi FX-001D CD-Rom drive

Soundblaster 16 Basic(CD-interface disabled)
DSP Base:0x220
MPU Base:0x330
     IRQ:7
Low  DMA:1
High DMA:6

This is puzzling me to no end.  Everything works fine under Dos and
OS/2.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

There's one problem with this attitude: it's what is keeping the vast
majority of PC users stuck on DOS.  No questions; just follow the party
line.

If we want the majority of PC Users to move to a real OS (And
fundamentally, I don't think it matters whether people use FreeBSD or
Linux, that's a much smaller issue), then we have to patiently explain
that the question is meaningless each time it's asked.

Otherwise, we become elitists, and therefore responsible for the failure
of the OS as a product for everyone.  While some people might not find
this necessarily the most important goal of Linux and/or *BSD, I believe
that it's critical to the Real World.

People are stuck with MeSsy-DOS because they're confused and scared; it
is our job to help them.  Unfortunately, due to compatiblity issues with
others, I still use Windoze.  Those compatibility issues exist because
it's what Joe User uses.

Don't be frustrated by stupid questions; they're a necessary evil.
The only stupid question is the one that convinces someone that DOS is
the best alternative.
