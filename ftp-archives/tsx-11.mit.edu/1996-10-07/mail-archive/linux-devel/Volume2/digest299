Hmm... let's check out C/370 for MVS, which is about as non - UNIXISH
as you can get, then: *firing up ISPF editor*

int main()
{
  int i = 4//* thoughtful comment */
             2;
   printf("%d\n",i)
   return 0;
}

... and this prints, after assorted other information *fanfare*:

2

Seems like it's non- broken, then.

Hi.
    Don't get me wrong, C++ is my language of choice and I also agree
that the // comment style looks better and is easier to work with. I
think though that this misses the point. I thought the issue was:

        C++ has nicer comments, let's use those style comments in C.

My problems are with the latter half of that statement, _not_ the
first part. I agree, C++ has nicer comments, etc. etc. etc. which is
why I write C++ code now, not C. I still think the fact that C++ was
derived from C is clouding the issue, so here's the same statement as
above, very slightly changed:

        Ada has nicer comments. Let's use those style comments in C.

Before I start a flame-fest, of which I can see several coming from a
statement like that :-), think about it for a moment. Ignoring the
fact that -- is currently syntactically valid in C, where // isn't;
there's really no difference between the two statements except the
second one is clearly ridiculous, no? Ada and C are different
languages! My point is that so are C and C++.

My suggestion, again, is that if you want C++ comments, etc. then
write C++ code. Please don't mangle C into becoming C++.

        Cheers,
        Bruce.

The system hung and required a hard reboot.

Following is the stuff asked for in /usr/src/linux/README (the
"nm tools/zSystem").

00122028 t _sync_buffers

001222a8 T _sys_fsync
00122328 T _invalidate_buffers

I'v seen this kind of thing with 1.1.4x kernels too.
This time the system stayed up for about a day before the crash.
Following the reboot, it's been up for just over a day so far...

I have purchased SWiM for Linux.  I have downloaded some examples of
Motif programs that have an Imakefile for building them.  The configuration
files (Imake.tmpl etc.) for imake only point to X/standard development
and not Motif, although there are Motif.tmpl (Motif.rules ...) files in the

From what I have heard, support for the MAX still isn't complete.
Namely, the CD input mixer and 16-bit recording weren't implemented
the last time I checked (v2.90pl2). If they've been done please let me
know.

Most people who have heard both say the digital audio of the GUS

It works well within the limitations of the driver.

Secure from General Quarters.  It's just configuration, and don't tell me
sendmail doesn't have enough of THOSE problems.

Make sure the smail conf/os/linux file calls out HAVE_SETEUID, remake it,
and install.  Also, add the "check-path" attribute to the forward file 
director.  Problem solved.

Subject: Shared libraries: idea
Date: 11 Oct 1994 06:03:57 GMT
Reply-To: fat@cnit.nsk.su

Hi there!

It is a raw idea that come to me this morning when I was
half-awoke. In it's present form it is hardly usable, but I hope
it contains a seed of Truth. So please, no flame; but I'd like to
hear some rational discussion. Please reply to fat@cnit.nsk.su
(mail on Indy is broken).

The major fault of ELF format is code relocation => long loading etc.
On x86 we can avoid relocation by placing different shared libraries
to different segments. So every library would see its own code segment
with 4Gb virtual space, and common data/text/bss/stack segment of the program.
Calls to library and between libraries must be intersegment (48-bit ptr).
If we need 32-bit pointer to library function we give pointer to a stub.

Similar thing can be done in single segment or with non-Intel CPU.
We should link all libraries to same address and map them all to one 
address area. To use them we need system calls mmap, mmap_over and mmap_switch.
It may be better to name these calls another way, but I hope you get an idea:
mmap maps a file to memory, mmap_over maps another file to same memory
area, and mmap_switch switches between different mappings.
It can be done by switching between different descriptor tables,
or by rewriting single table - I don't know which method would be better.

When you have to call a library function you call stub. This stub looks
what mapping is currently in effect and calls mmap_switch if needed.
It is similar to overlay management in non-VM environments.

It looks funny but I'm afraid overhead would be too big...

Cheers,
        Fat Brother.

I still saw the problem at 1.1.51 (but not yet at 1.1.52) but only with 
FTPD on Linux and only when the FTP client came in via PPP (pre latest
alpha).

I have no trouble with Linux as a client nor with FTPD when the client
comes in via Ethernet.

Implication: The problem is caused by some interaction between PPP (or SLIP)
and FTPD. (??)

I have not had a chance to test 1.1.52 or Al's latest PPP version in this
context.

I will try to do that this week.

I am currently trying to get an SVR4 code to run under iBCS2 but have
run into a problem with an ioctl that is not curently supported by iBCS.
The error message when BSD emulation is turned on says:

"BSD: termios ioctl 0X00007414 unsupported"

and with BSD turned off says:

"iBCS: ioctl(1,7414[..t],0Xbffffac8) unsupported"

Unfortunately, I do not have easy access to a SVR4 box to try to find
what this ioctl is trying to achieve so that I can patch iBCS2.

Could someone please help me out by searching termio.h and/or termios.h
on an SVR4 box for an ioctl function name with a value of 7414 hex
('t' 20 maybe).

TIA.
Stephen.
