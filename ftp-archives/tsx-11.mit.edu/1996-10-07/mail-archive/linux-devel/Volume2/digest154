Not a hint, but the same problem using kernel 1.1.44.
DOSEMU locks up if I try to load the mouse driver.
Under X things are working well(the first time !).

I already do all of this.  A 'trash' command mv's files to a
subdirectory per user in /tmp.  A 'tmpclean' script deletes the oldest
files first until 15% of /tmp is free.  They're written as 'bash'
aliases and 'perl' scripts.

eigentlich alles kein Problem, jede Partition hat ihren
eigenen Raum, keine Ueberschneidungen. Denkste...
die ersten Partitionen habe ich aus der Liste geloescht,

first partitions are deleted --- they weren't important.
normally no problem, every partition has its own room,
no overlapping...
parttion 4 is the first extended one. every partition is
preceeded by a block with one entry for the mainpartition
and a pointer to the next partitionblock if there's any
further extended partition. 
look at the table above. there's no room for these blocks 
at all! beetween every extended partition there should be
at least one block free, not listed as part of a partition.
a diskeditor show, that the needed partitionblock is found
on the last block of the partition before.

the partitions was build with fdisk 1.4. normally it works
ok, so that the necessary block is inserted automatically.
if you try to enter a used block, you'll get an error and
I think the partitions were ok 2 weeks ago, when they're built.
I don't know, what's happened. today I've done a reboot to
load another kernel and get errors while reading the partitions,
cause some partitionblocks was overwritten by some files.

once the intention of this is to prevent damages on other systems
and naturately It would be nice to get know what's happened there...

Subject: Drivers for Interlan NP600A e-net card?
Date: Fri, 9 Sep 1994 15:37:11 GMT

I have just dredged up a couple of MICOM-Interlan NP600A net cards and
was wondering if there is any way of using them under Linux. They look
like they would have been nice cards in their day - on board 80186 w/
512K memory etc, designed to do some of the protocol stack on-card
rather than under the OS, 16bit bus.
Anybody any ideas on how to drive them out there - can they fake a
cheap card (NE2000 or WD80x3?) or something like that? Or am I out of
luck this time? (I've been able to drive just about all the other random
hardware that's fallen into the black hole I call my room...)

Probably.

However, you'd have to keep the cost in the range people expect
($50-500) - none of these $20,000 two-user licenses that some Unix
software vendors offer. Nobody would jump for that.

There's definitely room for a Fortran compiler, especially a good one.
f2c just doesn't cut it for a lot of things. As far as C goes,
remember you have to beat gcc and g++; but that shouldn't be terribly
difficult. A native 80x86 compiler generates much better code than
gcc, because the 80x86 architecture is so weird.

 > 2. How much would people pay for such a product [ loaded question ]?

Depends on how good it is. If it doesn't offer any noticeable
improvement over gcc, almost nobody's going to bother.

One area where gcc falls seriously short, IMO, is performance...

Floppy, CD-ROM are good... non-anonymous ftp might be good too.

Yes. We're all used to gdb, but it's awfully primitive. (A

Subject: RFD: Linux and end-users (Was: Don't use Linux?!)
Date: 11 Sep 1994 07:36:42 GMT

Greetings!

I received some mail in response to my "Dont use Linux!?" article, which
I posted to c.o.l.d. People kindly reminded me that subjects like "Dont
use Linux" are typically used to start a flame war, but not a serious
discussion. Well, I really *hate* wars of any kind, and just to take
away any potential snake-oil, I changed the subject line in the hope that
you carefully read what I've written, and that you now are willing to start
a serious discussion.

Please allow me to explain a few details: I do *not* think that the policy
for the kernel or the C library needs to be changed. I didn't say that,
I didn't write that, and I didn't think that. The problem I tried to
describe is the following: If you're offering a commercial product (e.g.
a database) for Linux, it might happen, that it will not run with newer
versions of the C library. If a customer purchases your database and is
not able to get things running, he will definitely make YOU responsible
for that, even though the problems are not caused by your database code.

I mentioned some CDROMs which contain dumps of the major Linux/GNU/X
ftp archives. I did *not* mean the CD versions of dedicated Linux
distributions (slackware, debian, SLS, ...), which usually come with
printed documentation, boot disks, and hotline support. I explained
(well, tried to ...) what I think is wrong with the sort of CDs
described above: they might be very useful for experienced users (e.g.,
it might be cheaper to buy such a CD, than to download the sources of
X11R6 using a slow SLIP connection), but they are not appropriate for
average users, who have no idea of Un*x and just want to try out Linux.

Again: I don't think this newsgroup is read by someone who hates Linux,
so we all - more or less - love this OS. It's great for developers and
for people who want to learn about Un*x and such, but it's a pain for
end-users. Have you ever tried to convince a typical DOS- or Mac-user
of Linux? Sooner or later talking comes to applications, and at that
point you'll have to talk a lot about emulators, and people will ask
you: I've got DOS/Windows right now. Could you please explain me, why
I should use Linux? If it's nothing more than just a platform for
any-sort-of-emulators to run my applications, I don't need that! This
is the public opinion about Linux, sorry to say that. IMHO, Linux is
just to great to deserve this, and therefore I want *YOU* to start a
discussion about how we can change this. Linux needs commercial products,
so we have to convince the companies that Linux *IS* a target. The race
is not run before the huge companies and market leaders appear on the
scene. If someone like WordPerfect or Borland will offer their products
for Linux, this will be a signal for others, too. Without the support
from the commercial world, Linux will stay the "best OS without success".
I don't mind if you don't share my opinion, and I don't mind if you send
me a mail about your opinion. But please not in that style:

Wonderful... I can't wait!  :)  Thanks, Alan, and all you other
developers for a fantastic job.

Here at Northwestern, when the freshmen come in this fall (that is,
next week) they will be able to install Linux directly over the
network, from their dorm rooms.  We expect that to lead to a lot more
Linux users here on campus.  Something quite amusing about the whole
thing is that we initially were going to have the file server for this
job being a SunOS box, but we had to change it to a Linux one since
the Sun couldn't NFS-export a directory to a whole domain (and our
netadmin said we were not allowed to export to the world).

We are basically using a Slackware distribution with slightly modified
install scripts (automatic network configuration via BOOTP).

How about SPX?  SPX seems like it ought to belong in the kernel.

Certainly MS-DOG did not... the kernel in MS-DOG is IO.SYS and
MSDOS.SYS (IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM on some OEM versions).  The shell
is COMMAND.COM.  However, several of the *user utilities* (COPY, DEL...)
are compiled into the *shell*, and for reasons that were good for the
original purpose of MS-DOG (to run on a floppy-only system too small to
run UNIX).

Now, many of the old Z80-based machines used BASIC in ROM as their
operating system.  There you can indeed say that the shell was built
into the kernel.  (And many of them had a command prompt ready by the
time the monitor picture had stabilized after power-on... sigh.)
