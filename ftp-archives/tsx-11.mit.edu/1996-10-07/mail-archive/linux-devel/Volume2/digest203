Not only unregistered, but also lacking a full networking installation -
will it work then?  Typically software I've tried to run can't determine
my hostname, and aborts, even though I have a rudimentary identification
for my system in /etc/HOSTNAME.

I can't seem to use xmkmf because the file Imake.tmpl is not found in /usr/lib/X11/config. Does anyone know what Slackware Dist. disks this file can be found on, as I really don't want to have to reinstall X. I installed the X,Xdev, and X apps

FlexFAX doesn't compile "out of the box" on Linux systems due to a
little faulty assumption in the configure script that comes with the
package.  I've included a small patch at the end of this post which
should make things compile cleanly; after applying the patch, just run
"configure linux-gcc" and it should recreate port.h as it should be.
A couple of minor warnings are issued for casts in auth.c, but these
can be safely ignored.

For your reference, I use GCC 2.5.8 and libc-4.5.26; many people have
reported problems compiling FlexFAX under GCC 2.6.0, so I would advise
against it.

More importantly, getting FlexFAX to COMPILE isn't the whole story.
As someone else alluded to, getting this package to WORK seems to
involve having the "right" modem.  While FlexFAX supports a wide
variety of modems and has a lot of useful documentation to help you
get yours configured properly, some modems (notably USR Sportsters)
give it headaches.

As a side-note, you will also need to use a kernel version which has
working software flow control (XON/XOFF).  Versions 1.1.42 and later
are fixed, and I believe the 1.0.x kernels still work, but somewhere
in-between the handshaking was broken.  Bear this in mind no matter
which fax program you choose, since software flow control is
essential.

You may honestly find the efax-Qfax combination considerably easier to
install and use for most Class 1 or 2 fax-modems, but then I'm a
little biased :)

This is much too complex.  Proxy ARP will do what you want in a
much simpler and more efficient way.

This kind of numbers are listed in the most current "Assigned numbers"
RFC, which also usually points to a reference.
There is also an RFC about encapsulation (RFC 1241)

"Proxy ARP" means that a system which knows the route to a certain
destination (e.g. it has a SLIP link to it) replies to ARP requests
for that destination on another network.  It replies with its own
hardware address.

E.g.: one system is on an ethernet and has address 192.0.0.1
A second system is linked to it using SLIP and has address 192.0.0.2
Now, when some system on the ethernet asks for the hardware address of
192.0.0.2, the first system replies with its hardware address.  All
packets for 192.0.0.2 will then be sent to the hardware address of
system 192.0.0.1, and it will route them to the proper SLIP link without
further modifications.  So, there is no need to check every packet on
the ethernet, only the ARP requests (which are all received anyway).

I don't know if Linux supports this in some way.  If not, it can be
added.

There are several CD-ROMs available that allow you to do this...

(well, not actually *booting* from CD-ROM, that was something that only

NO.  I can connect to any Internet site from amateur radio if I wish.
But I should only access data relating to amateur radio.  I should
not ftp to sunsite.unc.edu and get the latest version of DOOM, as it
is not related to amateur radio.  I can get Linux (it would take forever
at 1200 bps or even 9600bps though) as it does have AX.25 in the kernel
and can be used for amateur packet radio.  I can even gateway amateur
related news groups and mailing lists to packet, but then I (yes me) am
responsible for what each and every article contains.

Not necessarily a bad thing.  My two year old loves to listen to HF chatter
as well as VHF/UHF repeater chatter.  It is cleaner entertainment for him
than TV (in most cases).  And maybe someday he will get his license and
who knows he might be the person that makes some really great contribution

Well you do actually have to buy or build radios and accessories.  I have
several thousand dollars in radio and computer gear so I have a hard
