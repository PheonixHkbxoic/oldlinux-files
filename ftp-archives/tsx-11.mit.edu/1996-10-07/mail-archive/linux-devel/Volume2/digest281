There is an obsolescent but "standard" 5.25 (and 3.5 if hardware
supports) 2HD DOS format in Japan.  Can we add its support into the
kernel?

FYI, the following set of params has proved to work with the format
from a couple of tests on kernel 1.1.49:

I'm not using the MHz modem, but I don't think that's important since they
use the same driver.  Try 'cu -l /dev/modem'.  I'm using a New Media 14.4
fax modem if that makes any difference.

What GNU Tutorials would you attend?                      No responses
rms@gnu.ai.mit.edu                                    Richard Stallman

We are thinking of having a GNU technical seminar in Cambridge,
Massachusetts next April or May.  One day will be a series of talks,
mostly technical overviews; the following day we are thinking of
having tutorials.  Tentatively we plan to charge $300 for the day of
talks, and $180 for each half day tutorial (students 1/4 price).
(These prices may change; consider them order-of-magnitude estimates.)
The funds raised, beyond the cost of the seminar itself, will go to
support GNU development.

To plan the tutorials, we need to find out what tutorial topics people
are interested in.  Here are the topics we are thinking about.

* Emacs Lisp programming.
* Advanced Emacs editing.
* Hurd programming.
* Using GNU Make, Bison, and Flex.
* Writing documentation in Texinfo.
* The Linux kernel.                          <====== !!!!
* Using Autoconf to write portable programs.
* Porting GCC.

If you think you would actually attend one or more of these tutorials,
please send mail to gnu-tutorials@gnu.ai.mit.edu and tell us which
ones.  We'll use the response to figure out which tutorials to offer,
and how to schedule them.


        What happened to HURD?
        Is Linux now THE kernel supported by GNU?
        What's Gnowing Gon Gnow?
        Have I been asleep?

        I'm so confused......

I'm seeing the same problem with:
 1.1.51, P60

I've checked /var/adm/notice and /proc/net/dev and there is no
further information. I gave a quick glance at the driver and it
doesn't look like it logs much. I'm using the internal transciever.
The card and drop have been independently verified as functional.
Is anyone else seeing this with 1.1.?? ?

Drat.  It looks like it was just a high load on the remote 
machine which brought down the ping times (with a TOS low
delay modified ping).  So, it looks like I'm back to square one.
I'm thinking of testing winsock to see if this happens under
windows too.

If there was a default "standard" GUI available on most distributions

your ideas about how to teach Unix.  IMHO, I think you can wean newbies
off of the mainstream PC OSes more easily with a good GUI and then let
them gradually cut their teeth with more and more command-line.

In short, I think the original poster's idea is good, but he should
definitely look around first and consolidate as much "good stuff" that
is already available as possible.  It might be a good idea to make a
GUI "mini-distribution" (package) that just contains a standardized
GUI setup (GREAT + fvwm + customized *rc files + selected GUI apps).

Subject: PROBLEM: Pentium-66 & Kernel
Date: Sat, 8 Oct 1994 10:20:26 GMT

Hello All,
         I've been having alot of problems with recompiling a new kernel
with my Pentium-66. 

Computer Details: P5-66, 16 Mb RAM, PCI S3 Vision864, serial and paralel and
IDE onboard, 520 Mb IDE (and a 260 IDE).

Software: Slackware 1.2.0, gcc 2.5.8 with 486 optimizations.

Here's a copy of the post I made to comp.os.linux.help a bit earlier:

===== Post starts here =====

(1) When I fdisk my new 520 Mb IDE drive, i get this:

The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 1060.
This is larger than 1024, and may cause problems with some software.
 
What does this mean? 

(2) I've been having LOTS of problems with compiling the kernel. I've got
Slackware 1.2.0, and have been trying to compile to 1.1.45. Even 1.0 doesn't
compile. This is what I just got with 1.1.45:

{standard input}: Assembler messages:
{standard input}:3103: Error: no such 386 instruction: `j'
make[3]: *** [de620.o] Error 1

Why is this so? Another thing: The file that it has problems with changed
each time I re-try (with the same config). This is a clean installation. I
*HAVEN'T* done anything with the pentium-gcc yet.

(3) Even doing a "make config" does strange things. A couple of times it
just stopped after setting up the sound driver (got a SB PRO 2). I didn't
get that message telling me to do a "make dep" and all that. With the above
problem, it made it through the whole setup OK. A couple of times in the
sound setup, it DIDN'T ask me for the base IO address for my SB either....

It seems to look OK with 1.1.45, but any previous version thinks it's
finished after the kernel, but goes onto the sound bit, and makes a mess of
things.

(4) Has anyone else had these problems and fixed them?

Thanks in advance....(I need an answer V.Soon coz I need to recompile the
kernel for XFree-86 3.1 so I can use my PCI S3 which has a Vision864...)

Thanks again.....

Not sure what you mean.  Does the Fvwm module Icon Manager do that?
Is the "IconBox" param in .fvwmrc what you want?

The FvwmSave module is supposed to do this.  I recommend the much
smarter xtoolplaces, part of olvwm.

1)      There is not Motif implementation other than OSF/Motif as yet.

2)      Motif isn't any "thing"; Motif, Open Software Foundation, OSF,

3)      There are several levels of compliance.  There's compliance
        with the Style Guide.  This is self-labeled and checkboxed by
        OSF.

4)      There's the API.  Nobody but OSF has one of these.

5)      There's the window manager.  Nobody but OSF has one of these.

More info available from the OSF directly (like the $3,000,000 one year,
