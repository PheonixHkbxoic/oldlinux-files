One of the causes of greater than 1.0 scalability occurs in multiprocessors
is because some resources are duplicated.  For example, 8 processors
have 8x the cache that one has.  For simple tasks like some of the phases
of a compile, this can really pay off.

Subject: PCI m/boards + PCI scsi : what do you think?
Date: 12 Sep 94 01:09:04 GMT

Hello all,

I plan to buy a pentium PCI mboard v. soon and I have scsi devices to use.
I will need a board & scsi controller that will work with linux/dos/os2/nt.
The NCR53c7/8xx range of pci controllers seems to be the best choice (?).

Could you share some of your experience on the following:

- Which is better/faster: on-board SCSI OR independent pci scsi board?
  Is the former much cheaper?
- Which are the NCR chips available (53c7xx/53c8xx)? What are the
  differences? Which is better/faster?
- Do all pci scsi boards have bios? Which are the versions to go for?
- Do they support >1Gb disks for DOS? I have a 2.1Gb.
- According to your opinion, what are the things to watch when buying a 
  pci mboard and pci scsi?
- Do you own a pci mainboard + scsi ? 
  Which one(s)? 
  Bios versions?
  Compatibility?
  Price?

Please reply via personal email.
I will summarise if I collect useful info.

If someone HAS collected ifno like this I would like to share it.

Thanks in advance,
Angelo

I suggested that this be done with field notation:

        int:8 // use at least 8 bits
        int:8:8 // use exactly 8 bits
        int:8:32 // use somewhere between 8 and 32 bits

I keep on hearing of this Cyclades board.  What is it exactly? How well is
it tested under linux, and where can I get one?

Just curios, I need a 16 port card and will have to go with a bocaboard
if nothing else presents itself.

Thanks.

: same here.

Use twm while you play doom.  The key-bindings don't conflict with the
game like fvwm, or you can edit your .fvwmrc file to fix the problem.

Otherwise your alt key will act like a toggle key and the ctrl-arrow
will change the virtual screen.  Not good...

No more difficult that tracking down information about Linux;
ftp.support.apple.com has lots of information in /dts/mac/*, and you can
always buy a copy of "d e v e l o p" for $10 and get a CD-ROM full of tech
docs.

I've got 100% f77 standard code that doesn't compile at all under f2c/gcc.
And I don't mean gives different results - I mean doesn't compile.
I don't have a sample handy at the moment; I don't do serious work
with f2c/gcc, so I haven't spent much time on it - just enough to try
out some of my favorite codes.

Off the top of my head, the code that I recall giving f2c/gcc the most fits
combined COMMON and EQUIVALENCE something like

  common /com/ a,b,c
  real x(3)
  equivalence (x(1),a)

The object here was to allow variables to be used by their individual
names (the real case had more pertinent names that a,b,c) in one set
of routines, while another set of routines operated only on the vector
as a whole.  (I might not have recalled every detail correctly, but it
was something close to this).

One might question the style, but this is perfectly standard.  And at
least the copy of f2c/gcc that I had barfed badly on this.  (Giving
very confusing error messages out of the C compilation stage).  I never
figured out how to send in bug reports, so I just dropped it.  But
I was left with the impression that, while "ok" for some purposes,
f2c was no competition with comercial products, at least for me.
I've *never* seen *any* commercial compiler have any trouble with
that construct.

           while you strafe without getting your figers tied in knots.)
arrows to turn left, right, move forward and backword

I find this layout to give me very good play control...comprable to
using the mouse.  When I play doom for dos i use the mouse to turn
left and right, and the arrows for moving forward and backword and a
similar layout for strafeing and such.  Anyone who uses the mouse to
move forward and backward should be shot.  bad bad bad...  :-)

Hope this helps...

Judging by the number of threads on this subject, there seem to be a lot
of people who have had the same idea.

Everyone has been saying that doing a proper SMP kernel is hard. So I'm
wondering why no one has said anything about doing it the easy/kludgey
way, at least for the time being.  

The easy way is the way that SunOS 4.1.3 does it, or is rumoured to do
it.  Allegedly 4.1.3 has a single spin lock around the entire kernel, so
that only one processor can be executing inside the kernel at any time.

Would it be possible to do this with Linux? 

4.1.3 with its big spin lock seems to perform better than multithreaded
Solaris 2.x on multiprocessor machines, though this is probably due to
other problems with Slowaris.

And Linux has a User File System that will allow a user process to
function as a file system. This makes it fairly easy to experiment
with log-structured file systems and news spool file systems
without requiring any kernel hacking. Do other OSes support
a similar file system type?
