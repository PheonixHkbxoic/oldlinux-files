Howdy!  I'm currently working on a Windows-based app, and want to try to port 
it to Linux under XF86... However, one of the cornerstones of this project is 
the ability to relink the function libs on the fly, without having to exit and 
restart the application... Is there anything even remotely similar available on 
the Linux or any other Un*x platform?

Thanks,

Subject: HDD Controller Question
Date: 23 Sep 1994 19:45:30 GMT

I now have four hard drives.  Two 212s one 80 and one 540.  My current 
system has one of the 212s and the 540, but it would be nice to mount the 
other two drives as well.  I just installed the Slackware 2.0 
distribution [kernel 1.1.18] without a problem (all mishaps were my fault 
and correctable.)

My question:  I know that IDE cards that support 4 HDD exist and work 
under DOS (presumably with some kind of BIOS bypass).  Will (or which 
of) these cards work with Linux?

I don't get a million, but I do get alot.  It is scary to think that
the basic library running everything as so much questionable code.

The problem I always have, is if I compile libc myself, the gcc 
'-g' option doesn't work.  However, when I install the precompiled
version the '-g' option works fine.  There is probably some key 
instruction I'm missing, but what I do is:

  make clean;make depend;make 

This doesn't install anything (probably because I never compile as
root...)  Also, there are no install commands listed in the README
file.  So I just manually copy all the files with:

  su -c 'cp `find . -name lib\*.so.\*` /lib;cp `find . -name lib\*.sa -or
-name lib\*.a` /usr/lib;ldconfig -v'

the *.sa *.a files to /usr/lib.  There is probably some file critical
to debugging with a different extention that I'm not copying.

The ATA-2 interface designs I've seen don't use anything nearly as
complicated as a busmaster interface.  They basically add two gates to
the bus driver enables and connect the DREQ and DACK (DMA request and grant)
lines to the bus.  The data transfer can then be done by the DMA controller
(which is hopefully faster on modern machines than the abysmal PC/AT
implementation).

Is anyone familiar with a different type of ATA-2 controller implementation?

This type of slave DMA transfer only really increases performance when
multiple sector mode is used.  512 byte sector transfers are below
break-even for setting up the DMA controller and taking an interrupt, but a
4K or 8K slave DMA transfer is a significant win.  The tradeoff of the IDE
interface vs. SCSI then becomes the lower IDE setup cost vs. the ability to
chain SCSI commands and the the related ability to disconnect.  And with
only two devices per low-cost controller, doing disconnects on IDE doesn't
make sense. 

A final note: programmed-I/O is *not* evil.  It primes the cache with
soon-to-be-used data and avoids coherency problems and interrupt overhead.
Nor is the ISA bus evil.  It's very inexpensive, and has enough bandwidth for
most I/O devices. It's only when you combine the ISA bus and heavy-duty
programmed-I/O that a fast processor wastes most of its cycles waiting on
the bus.

Since when does the drive not notify the system of a disk change....
one of the big features of the 1.2 and 1.44 drives is the "DISK CHANGE LINE" 
that tells you if a floppy has been changed since the drive was last selected!

About the only use of this line that I've ever seen is in FastBack for DOS... 
so that FastBack can start immediatly writing to a disk as soon as it has been 
inserted... I have no idea what port or bit this line is visible on... but it 
is available somewhere out there is I/O land......

I think that an auto-mounter option would be a good idea for those of us who 
have to build turnkey systems to be used by the unix-illiterate... It would 
sure save some of the bogus code I've had to write to test if a floppy is 
inserted, formatted, etc.

It might not be a bad idea if the automounter did not interfere with the usual 
device nodes for the floppies... so you could still TAR/CPIO/Etc. to an auto- 
mounted device??

Or you could (Deity of your choice forgive) go as far as MS Windows and pop up 
a window asking if you want to format a floppy if the auto-mounter cannot 
detect the filesystem type when you first attempt to access the device...
Naaaaa... then the automounter would have to be aware of which user/console 
made the request to access the device...

Yikes!  Answering all the questions to make config and doing a make dep
takes maybe 10 min, and my machine takes 12 min to compile the kernel.
I only have a DX2 66.  I wonder how the Pentium fairs.

(btw I'm running kernel 1.1.50)

Definitely.  Normally PCs are horrible at networking compared to Unix
(in this case Linux).  Granted, Unix is harder to use for the general
user, but still.

Subject: DMA problems on Dell XPS-90
Date: 26 Sep 1994 02:56:19 -0400

I have been having problems with the DMA system on DELL XPS-90 machines.

I run Linux on them, 1 of them is a "server" of sorts, the other 20
serve as dual-purpose Xterminals/Dos workstations.

I am no DMA expert, but I have been getting errors from the two main DMA
devices on the systems: namely the floppy driver, and the lance ethernet
driver (I have AT-1500's).  The errors are not very descriptive, (the
floppy driver says "Dma Error?", while the lance driver reports "Bus
Master Arbitration Problem".  The errors seem to be a temporary
unavailability of the DMA controller.  This doesn't seem to have a great
affect on the floppy, (since it goes so slow, I'd imagine, it has plenty
of time to retry the DMA transfer), but it often causes the lance driver
to get a FIFO error, because it cannot keep it's buffers filled while
performing a transmit.

I have not spoken to anyone at DELL yet, but I just wanted to see if
anyone else has had similar problems with these machines.  They all pass
Dell's Diags, but I don't think that really means all that much.

Also, I have two other types of machine that are configured similarly
(same ethernet card, same kernel floppy/lance drivers), and they all do
not give these errors (Dell 486D50, Dell Omniplex P90).

Anyone else having these problems?  Anyone have a similar setup, and NOT
having these problems?

I know this is off topic and doesn't belong here, but...

As those who hang out in comp.std.c would tell you, this is acceptable
behavior.  ANSI C doesn't require that standared include files be

Date: 26 Sep 1994 03:39:01 GMT

(I originally posted this to comp.os.linux.admin yesterday, someone
suggested I post it here too, followups to both groups from THIS article)

  Whilst testing out my talker code I happened upon a rather nasty bug
in Linux, I certainly hope it isn't meant to be a feature!
  Basically for non-systems ports, ANY user can at ANY time bind() any
port number, if a process already 'owns' the port, even if the process
is owned by root! This means that if you run some sort of server,
someone else can come along and run a program to bind() the port, and
any new connections go to it. With the help of a friend I managed to
track down where the bind() for AF_INET sockets is actually done, and
worked out a fix. It seems to work fine, got it running on test atm.
  The code now allows uid 0 to always grab a port as before, and any
other user to grab non-system (>= 1024) ports if and only if there
isn't a running process that is bound to that port. I'm using the
->dead data member to test if there is an 'alive' process attached to
the port, is this correct?
  I have a diff patch against the sources for 1.1.51, but have been
unable to find who is the best person to send this to for it to be
checked and maybe made official, any offers?

A general answer :

  Linux supports all types of SCSI-streamers. This includes

   - QIC 60/150/525/... [QIC-80/QIC-117 are floppy-streamers and not SCSI]
   - Exabyte 8200/8500/...
   - HP-DAT / Wang-DAT

SCSI-streamers are sequential-access-devices and the scsi-commands are
equal for all streamers. So .... no problem !

 No offense, but you're either not up on the true speed of CD-ROM drives 
or you don't realize how often UNIX hits the media.

You can do this with a number of commerical releases of Linux, including 
the Yygdrasil release, but in practice running UNIX off of a 300kb/sec 
device is painful and running X off of such a device is glacial.

Its alright as a way to look at UNIX, maybe, for a brief period, but 
TOTALLY unstatisfactory for doing real work.

Sorry.
