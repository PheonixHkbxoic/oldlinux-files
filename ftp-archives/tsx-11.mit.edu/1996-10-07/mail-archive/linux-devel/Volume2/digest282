Subject: Device driver for serial line/SCSI device
Date: Thu, 6 Oct 1994 12:43:05 GMT

I'd like to write a device driver for a scanner that's connected
to the serial line or the SCSI port.

It should be in the kernel (or a loadable module), so it can register
a character device and can be accessed bei applications using ioctl.
But I'd like to use "high level" communication with the serial/SCSI
port that is unavailable to a kernel driver.

What would be the best way to implement such a driver ?

Does this program use extraordinarliy much memory? If yes, perhaps
increased RAM usage of the X server and/or the program in question
(does it make the window bigger?) in higher resolution might cause a
memory hog.

You need to get the file
   ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/GCC/src/tools-2.16.tar.gz

Then make and print out the file 'README.ps' for instructions on how to make
a DLL shared library.  I think that you need to talk to Eric Youngdale about 
address assignments for your shared library.  The procedure look a bit complex 
for a brand new library.  
        However if you can wait a few months, REAL SOON NOW a elf shared 
library toolset is due out.  The elf format shared library fixed some of the
problems with the current DLL shared library system.

It would be nice to have something about the status of the PowerMac port

From reading the group, it seems lots of people have tried e-mailing the

doing the port to be constantly bonbarded with e-mail.
Maybe an official status posting every 2 months or so, would keep everyone

Please undo my previous patch.

I think the following code should fix the problem.  It works on my system.
It corrects a locked socket buffer problem with ppp.c (the one with 2.1.2a).
(change is at the end of ppp_xmit).  (compare 3c505.c).

This is not what you asked but your monitor supports upto 110Mhz. If

Read README files for X for more info. I think good monitors will

You can setup your card using the pss-stuff from the voxware driver. 
The pss even can upload your .ld file to the card.
I have managed to run the MSS (ad1848 codec) _without_ installing

I'm not goping to flame you back, because I have some problems myself

about GNU history to have a very intelligent view on this, just a feelign 
that the only products I've ever seen where this was literraly true were 
all made by Microsoft.)

On your subejct of 'come on and help us develop' though, i wanted to make 
you aware of anothre side.  Myself, I would love to do some Linux kernel 
hacking, but i don't because I work 40+ hours a week programming for a 
living, which only leaves a small amoutn of time (after the chunkc other 
responsabilities take out) to work on my own projects.  Given that, at 
the moment, other projects interest me more.  As fasr GCC goes, I'm happy 
I have it, Ill be happy to report bugs, but i don't mhave the time to do 
development on it as well.  If that were really necessary, Ild go buy a 
commercial compiler. Luckily, I haven't found that to be the case.

Well, it seems to me there should be a way of handling this using a
segment register, instead of wasting a general-purpose register.  Set
up a local descriptor table, then use the base of a currently unused
segment register (GS, for example), then do any references with
respect to GS.  This doesn't solve the cases where a pointer needs to
be passed, of course, but I presume that is not the majority of cases,
and this would free up EBX.

As you indicated, don't try it with SLIP. Putting X window protocol
over a SLIP link is very dangerous without sending the complete and
error-free frame.

The problem is not that the modems are busy sending the frames. The
problem seems to come from the fact that the modems themselves have a
buffer. Once you fill this buffer, the modem will refuse to accept
additional data until the buffer reaches the low water mark.

If you disable the modem buffer then you will probably find that your
performance will DECREASE since the buffer in the modem smoothes out
the transmission interrupt latency times. (Yes, it occurs on the
transmitter as well as the receiver.)

The PPP software has defined a "frame abort" sequence. (It is coded as
ESC-FLAG if you wish to dig up the appropriate RFC documents.) If the
receiver sees this sequence, the frame is to be considered aborted and
no further processing (including CRC calculations) is to be performed.

Then consider the fact that you may decide to abort the FTP data
transfer frame just short of its normal completion. This would waste
the time that you have already spent sending the data to this
point. (Modem buffers will get in the way in determining just how far
the modem is in progress for sending the frame.) You then put the
frame back on the transmit queue for later transmission and send the
SMTP frame. This gets almost through and then comes a telnet character
frame. So, on hold goes the SMTP frame and now the telnet goes
out. The telnet frame completes and you then restart to send the
SMTP. Oops, now another telnet frame. So back it goes on the queue.

This is not a very workable solution. I suppose that you could bump
the priority by one every time that it goes back on the pending queue
to avoid starving the frames. However, you need to consider the entire
system, not just the single message. You need to consider the amount
of time that you spent calculating the vj header compression, and the
ability to send all of the data.

I doubt that this is a workable solution. However, you are certainly
free to try . . . . :)

If you are the only person using the link and you don't want the
telnet session to be degraded by ftp, then don't start the ftp
transfer. (Simple, isn't it?) If you are not the only user then you
don't have this option. However, consider that the person doing the
ftp transfer wants the data transferred as fast as possible as
well. You must consider all of the users, not just one.

The best solution is to simply choose the priority when you do the
transmission and then send it in that order.

The maximum value is set once for the session. You could reduce it,
but increasing it is definitely not a good idea.
