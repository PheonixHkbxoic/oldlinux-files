But in the /usr/lib/smail/config file,  There are blanks (spaces) after
all of the backslash characters on the Recieved control lines.
Remove the blanks and it works correctly.

Subject: Building shared libs..
Date: 21 Sep 1994 22:54:37 -0400

Hello,

My goal is to build several shared, dll libraries for Linux such
as 3D graphics libraries (vogl, vogle, Ygl, sipp, plplot) and huge
NAG fortan library. I read the documantation included with tools-2.16,
looked over the examples, looked over other libraries, and actually
already compiled some of the above, but still have some questions,
that hopefully someone can answer.

First of all, how do I register the load address of the libraries, so there
will be no conflict with other people libraries. And how do I get the stop address?
Say if the start address is 0x72000000 how do I calculate the stop address?
Can I do "size libxx.so.x.x.x" and then add the hex size to the start address 
and make the stop addres just bit higher then the above sum?

Second, I did libinfo on several stubs in the /usr/lib and observed that the
Global Offset Table size and Jump Table size are same for most of them 
(0x1000 and 0x4000). Why is that? Doesn't the size of the library play
any role here?

Third, well I think that's enough for now.
I really be thankfull if someone can answer above questions..
Thank you,

-PP

This was the reason the Qfax utilities for efax were developed.  They
give an otherwise "single-user" fax program a full-fledged set of fax
server features, including remote spooling, e-mail-to-fax gateway,
automated PostScript cover page generation, user phonebooks, and so
on.

You are correct about mgetty+sendfax however--that was an omission
that several others pointed out in other posts.  However, my
interpretation of "fax daemon" as the initial poster described it,
seemed only to fit FlexFAX and the efax+Qfax combination due to the
lack of spooling with mgetty+sendfax.  It should also be noted that
mgetty+sendfax requires a Class 2 fax-modem, whereas FlexFAX and
efax+Qfax work with both Class 1 and 2 fax-modems.

Regards,

        Rob

I've got a Media Vision Pro 3D sound card with SCSI-2.  The SCSI-2 chip is an
NCR 53C406A.  It looks like it's probably something new, since it's not
mentioned in the SCSI-HOWTO.

Does anyone know about this chip?  Is it compatible (no changes required) with
another supported NCR SCSI chip driver?  If not, know where I can get a NCR
data sheet on the chip -- so I can patch the nearest NCR driver code?

Thanks.

Speaking  of VIPER, this is not  under the purview of   that project either. At
least,  not yet.   We  are basically interested  in  providing  multi-threading
support in  the kernel, not making  Linux a micro-kernel.  Those steps may come
later on. I don't know how Mach works, but if  it supports dynamically loadable
device drivers, then  the project of  making Linux a  Mach server  process, may
address this issue.

I'm having the same problem with atof()!  I've been going nuts tring
to find the cause!  Is it a library bug, or what?

Linux 1.0.8, libc.so.4.5.24, gcc 2.5.8, 486DX40.

Here's the snippet of code that's causing it.  (This works on SunOS 4.1.3)

double getElement(gstr,gstart,gstop)
int  gstart, gstop;
char gstr[80];
{
    int  k, glength;
    char gestr[80];

    glength = gstop - gstart + 1;

    for (k = 0; k <= glength; k++)
        gestr[k] = gstr[gstart+k-1];

    gestr[glength] = '\0';

    return(atof(gestr));
}

I have been having the worst of luck with an UltraStor 24F EISA SCSI
controller that I have at my office.  Under MSDOS all seems well.  I
was able to access different SCSI drives, do low level formats, etc.
Under Linux, using the UltraStor 1.11 alpha driver, things are much
different.  Usually I load a boot floppy, the driver loads, it sniffs
out my SCSI disk, recognizes the partitions then a few seconds later
the kernel seems to dead-lock with a "SCSI host 0 timed out" error.

Any clues as to what this might be?  Does a newer driver exist for the
24F?

Thanks a million,
Rod

Try linking with -lieee. BTW: Next time can you mention what version of the
C libraries you are using. A "ldconfig -p" will suffice.

Probably because the link line had a "-g" in it somewhere. Take out the "-g"'s
from the Makefile and relink. The "-g" tells GCC to produce ginormous binaries
for fun.

This is likely a I/O address conflict.  What kind of disk controller are you
using?  What address are the cards jumpered to?  Remember that the NE2000
takes 32 I/O locations.

Are there any Tx or Rx errors reported in /proc/net/dev?  What about error

Routing Information Protocol (RIP), External Gateway Protocol

No, the destination address must not always be a 'host'. If you make a 'nestat -rn'
for example, you will not find as many 'host' routes as 'network' routes.
'host' routes have the 'H' flag set wheras 'network' routes have the 'G' flag set.
Therefore there could conceptually be a network with number 127.0.0.0. But this
number is per definitionem reserved for local connections on your computer.
I.e the kernel can use the same addressing scheme for local connections (remember
the 'localhost' entry in /etc/hosts), as it would use for external connections.
