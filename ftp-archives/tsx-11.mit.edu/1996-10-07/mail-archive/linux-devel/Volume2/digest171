Date: 14 Sep 1994 03:33:15 GMT

I'm getting ready to write a frame-relay driver for use with a v.35
board with Linux. I need to get as much information as I can about how
frame-relay looks and works. Any pointers to books/papers/articles,
on-line resources, mailing lists, FAQ's, newsgroups, WWW/gopher/ftp
sites or anyplace else that would have specs, code samples (from any
driver at all), details on how to implement network protocols on
frame-relay, or anything else that pertains to this project would be
*greatly* appreciated.

Also, if there are people who are interested in helping me by
answering questions or (eventually) testing the product, please
contact me via email now.

I would appreciate it if you would contact me directly by email at
kruckenb@sal.cs.utah.edu or pete@dswi.com. I will keep these
newsgroups informed of my progress.

Thanks for your help!
Pete.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HI Folks !

I'm looking for infos on the ReadLINK ENET16/U Rev. C Ethernet-Card.
This card can be jumpered for WD80x3 and NEx000 mode and has a lot of
jumpers on board :

  J10   Eprom-Addr            A18-A13
  J9    I/O ADDR              A8-A5
  J11   NE1/NE2
        CPX/WDP
        32K/8K
        WD/NE
  J5    SEL
  J4    <unknown>
  J12   0WD-DLY
  J8    PROM
  J15   EPROM CONFIG
                16K
                16/32K
                32/64K
                64K
  J14   EPROM SIZE
                E16K
                E32K
                E64K
  J6A   Upper IRQ's  (15,11,10)
  J6B   Lower IRQ's  (2,3,4,5,7)

Whatever setting i choose (WD oder NE), whatever IRQ/IO i choose, the card  
is recognized but

  - in NE-Mode the card hangs together with HD-Access  CRASH
  - in WD-Mode, all works fine, but the cards (2 of this kind) don't
    recognize one another on the NET

I got these cards very cheap but without infos.
Can anyone post me infos for this card ????

HELP !!



Ciao

Only diff is - I'm trying to get a PC to route between 2 ppp links. It 
seems that if it has two interfaces - it can't forward packets...
(I too have IP forwarding/gatewaying set to [yes]).

The MediaVision Pro (or Premium) 3-D sound cards are not mentioned in the
"Hardware HOWTO."  Does that mean they aren't supported or does that mean that
another card's driver works with it?

Thanks.

By the way, I'm leaning towards buying the MediaVision Pro 3-D for its SCSI-2
interface (and bundled DOS/Windows software) and the 4Plex quad-speed CD-ROM
drive.  I hope there aren't any major road-blocks to purchasing that combo.

I'm afraid I'm at a bit of a loss, myself.  You are right that the error 
message you are seeing is about as useful  "something went wrong somewhere"
(yes, I actually had a utilty at one point which gave that error, and 
only that error!)

I don't see why Photo-CD should require any special support just to see 
its files.  One possability, however, may have to do with CDROM-XA.  
Loking back through some notes I seem to have discoeverd that Photo-CD is 
not just CD-ROM based but CD-ROM XA based.  If thats true, its possible 
that there is some special coding that identifies an XA track, that the 
driver is seeign and going "PANIC! This isn't a normal CD-ROM!"

If thats true, then it may be a minor adjustment to the driver to fix.  
Your best source of info however, is the driver writer, who you tell me 
you've already contacted.

Good Luck!

I showed that your alleged examples were non-examples, i.e.,
in an ideal world, where Linux handles all languages and all

Having just bought a (cheap) Ultrastore 34F I was a little dismayed to
hear that it may not be able to take advantage of some of the
advances in the SCSI speedups in recent kernels.  Something called
SCSI clustering speed up or something.

Can anyone explain what this is?  Do the device drivers need to be
rewritten for the Ultrastores?  How likely is this to happen?

Subject: Re: Don't use Linux?!
Date: 13 Sep 1994 14:08:55 -0700

  Allow me to begin where you ended, with your definition of what you mean 
by a "successful" operating system:

  "If an operating system is successful or not depends on the availability
of qualified (commercial) software for end-users."

  If we delete the parentheses in this definition, it follows (as you put 
it) that: 

  "If we *really* want Linux to succeed, we *need* the companies and their
commercial products!"

  You then explain why you believe Linux to be an unattractive platform for
commercial software developers: 

"1. Commercial software products are typically binary-only (i.e., no
   source code is available). ...

"2. Linux's libc tends to change its version number almost every week
   (sometimes even more often). ...

"3. The kernel versions change faster than the speed of light. ...

"4. The spirit of free software is all around. Free in both meanings:
   free availability of the sources, and free of charge. Which does
   not go together with commercial interests very well. ..."

  In other words, commercial software developers prefer to keep the their
source codes secret and sell licenses to people to use the binaries
instead, a sales strategy that does not work well in a completely open
software development environment such as Linux, where the source code is
available to everyone and the license to use the software is free. 

  This, given your definition of a "successful" operating system, leads
you quite logically to consider that to be "successful" in that sense,
Linux has to change in ways that make it more compatible with the sales
strategy favored by commercial software developers.

  I think your definition of a "successful" operating system is extremely
narrow. 

  I suggest that the ultimate success of an operating system consists in
its contribution to the rate of education of human beings on this planet,
and I suggest that the contribution an operating system makes to the rate 
of education of human beings on this planet depends on the contribution 
made by the software packages that operating system supports.

  But just as it is a mistake to think that software which is packaged
like kitchen appliances -- mere plug-in devices which "the consumer" is
led to believe it is not necessary to understand in order to be "enjoyed"
-- can make any important contribution to the rate of education of human
beings on this planet, it is a mistake to think that the success of an
operating system is measured by the number of these "kitchen appliances"
it supports. 

  Some people believe a world in which nothing more than the ability to
"click" on a few icons on a video display would be required of an employee
to be preferable to a world in which every student who graduated from high
school would know how to write down the definition of the `permute'
relation in the form of Horn Clauses. 

  I believe the opposite.

There are several systems that do this, but all that I know (knew) of
were available only for micros (e.g. PC, Mac).  One problem with TeX
extensions, of course, are that they often are not fully documented, or
documented in a way that allows me to hand a manual to a newbie and 
expect him or her to get rolling pretty fast.  Also, TeX extensions are
not always well supported or maintained (e.g. get the diffs and fend for
yourself...).

Don't get me wrong.  I'm happy to hear that some versions of TeX make
the effort to deal with multi-language documents.  Who knows, it may
turn out that TeX is the answer here, despite being essentially a mid-
80s style typesetter with no GUI and a lot of extra formatting that I
would have to look at (worse than WordPerfect in "view codes" mode -
yuck).  It seems like bitter medicine, but if it cures the illness
who am I to complain?

Well, strictly spoken, the address-bus is 23 bits wide. However, these 
address *words* (ie. 16 bits). To be able to address bytes, it has 2 
lines (UB and LB ?) to distingish between the upper byte and the lower byte.
I guess this was done to make the internal design easier.

Another language that can do exactly the same thing is Fortran (in its

Well, sounds quite good. I recently had an unsuccesful discussion about the
availability of Alpha boards in regards to the coming Linux support.

  The only providers on the AXP front have been DEC itself and European
Vobis stores -- the former to expensive, the latter only building them on
demand, as sales are so low. And both only sell complete systems, no single
boards.

  Now for the real questions: what about the pricing and support by the
Linux/AXP branch?
