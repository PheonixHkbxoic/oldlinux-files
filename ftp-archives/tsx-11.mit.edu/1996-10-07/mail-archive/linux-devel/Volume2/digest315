I'd say it's a problem with the nameserver. What does nslookup say?
Where does your /etc/resolv.conf point?

I'll happily modify terminfo if anybody bothers to document the changes/new

Reply-To: mjf@clark.net

  I recently upgraded my system to 1.1.53 from 1.1.50.  When I did, archie
and xarchie stopped working.  They now just sit there for a long time and
eventually die with a "timed out" error.  This used to happen under 1.1.45
or so, but was fixed when I went to 1.1.50.  Now it's back in 1.1.53.  I
haven't tried 1.1.54 yet, perhaps it's already fixed.  Anyone know what
causes this?

  I tried re-compiling them with the new include files, but this made no
difference.  I am using gcc 2.5.8, libc 4.5.26, and XFree86 2.0 (for xarchie).
My system was once Slackware 1.1.1 (but that was long ago...;-) ).

  Oh yeah, my network connection is via SLIP.  I have no ethernet card, and
none configured in my kernel either.

Yes, it will set the changed_floppies bit,
and then the fragment
        if (filp->f_mode & 3) {
                UDRS->last_checked = 0;
                check_disk_change(inode->i_rdev);
                if (test_bit(drive,&changed_floppies))
                    RETERR(ENXIO);
        }
of floppy_open() returns ENXIO.

Another bug I stumbled onto:
If you insert a 5.25" floppy the wrong way, then a timeout
will occur, and the flag PROVEN_ABSENT is set.
After that /dev/fd1 is unusuable, since that flag is never
cleared again. (But you can always reboot.)

For the time being is is perhaps easier to use old kernels
when floppy access is required.

Reply-To: Thomas.Koenig@ciw.uni-karlsruhe.de

Well, the NFS client code finally got some attention; performance
isn't bad, it seems.

What about he NFS server?  It's also far from fast, at the moment;
I see several bottlenecks:

- The RPC code has too much overhead.  It would be better to rewrite
  the protocol parsing stuff from scratch, using 'raw' C.

- Other Unices have the advantage of being able to server multiple
  requests by having multiple in-kernel NFS servers, which can serve
  multiple requests concurrently.  For example, this means that one
  process can do the CPU work to check a request while another one
  is waiting for data to come from the disk.  Linux nfsd, which is
  a user-level daemon, can't do this (being single - threaded).
 
A couple of random thoughts...

The clone() system call would be ideal for that, but it seems to be
on the back burner until at least 1.3.  Has anybody given it thoughts?

Another possibility would be to implement a non - blocking read from
disk.  The NFS server would then be able to handle requests coming
in from the network while the disk was busy.

Thoughts, anybody?

Last I heard, There was a new PreP Cmpliant Rs/6000 with a 15" monitor, 
340 Meg HD (Only bad part) 16 Mags of Ram, several PCI and ISA slots, and 
a DAt Drive, as well as on board Hihg speed SCSI port, and AIX installed 
with lisence for around $4000.00.  Not much, but a little steep for a

That is the complete system - quite usable.  The Indy for $5000.00 
doesn't include as much ram, and I don't think that price includes the OS.

No, it cannot be done because IBM was so stupid to design the interrupt
architecture in such a way that an interrupt will only come in when *BOTH*
devices on the same line request an interrupt.
This is one of the major design errors in the ISA BUS, and there is nothing
you are going to do about it in software.

The distributed kernels (at least the 1.1.5x) contain a 3c505 driver which
is marked ALPHA.  So when you select ALPHA drivers you can configure it.

This can easily be combined with packet filtering functionality.
I think people are working on packet filtering.  Do it like this:

each packet is examined and matched with the (compiled) filtering
rules.   when a rule is found, this is not treated merely as a
discard/allow switch, but a value is associated with the rule.

this can then be interpreted as:

0 - discard the packet
1 - treat with low priority
2 - treat with medium priority
3 - treat with high priority


as the filtering rules (for any usable filtering) already should be
able to look at protocol and port number, these two functions are
conveniently combined.

All modems with error correction and compression have a transmit buffer.
The only variation between modems may be how large this buffer is.
