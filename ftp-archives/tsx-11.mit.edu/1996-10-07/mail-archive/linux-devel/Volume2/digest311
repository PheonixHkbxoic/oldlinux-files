I couldn't access my floppy under 1.1.53 same happens with 1.1.54, 51 and 52 
were fine though (apart from the umount problem in 51).

beattie:~# mount /dev/fd0 /floppy/
mount: /dev/fd0 is not a valid block device
beattie:~# fdformat /dev/fd0
ioctl(FDGETPRM): No such device

It's all very well and easy to say that "someone should go and compile
a list of features and differences".  I think the 386BSD FAQ tries to
do this, to a degree, but the maintainer has (as far as I can recall)
been pretty close to getting pissed of and "leaving the room" on a
number of occasions.  If someone does put together a list of features
and differences, that list has to be maintained.  Such a job would
probably result in more aggravation than anything else, given the
tendency for flame wars to develop.
A feature, which to one person looks good, may look bad to another.
Lets take shared libraries as an example.  I'm pretty sure that you
could get a pretty good flamewar going about whether Linux or *BSD have
got the best solution to shared libraries.  Without going into the
details of each, both have advantages and disadvantages.

I realize that what I'm saying doesn't change or help anything.  It
would however help, if those of us who do try to answer some of the
questions would try and set our egos and our love for our pet systems
aside when answering the questions, and try to give a balanced answer,
and do our best not to write any flame-bait.

I don't think we will get rid of the flame-wars.  Also, the competition
between the groups is good -- it keeps us all on our toes, and the
people who benefit in the end are the users.

It would be nice to see a factual list of differences between the
different free UN*Xes compiled.  I just don't see it happening, and I
sure as hell am not volunteering to do it.  (Remember that anyone who
tries to pin down any one of *BSD or Linux is shooting at a moving
target -- these systems all move so fast as they incorporate new
features and borrow from each other.)

Subject: SCSI: ISA/VLB, what difference?
Date: 14 Oct 1994 14:38:38 GMT

  Hi all!

I have a Buslogic BT445s VLB Hostadapter and use the buslogic driver
which now is part of the kernel :-)
Allthough there are no real complaints, I noticed after a while when
looking at the kernels bootmessage that the driver is detecting the card
as a ISA Model. A quick look in  the source showed me the possility to
override the detection, which I then tried.
Strange enough, a benchmark comparison between the ISA and the VLB
Version (using bonnie) showed nearly no difference with a slight
slowdown for the VLB version (I did 3 runs for each version, and the
difference lies above the statistical variation).
How can that be? Even if the transferrate is dominated by the speed of
the drive (a 500 Meg Fujitsu), which it shurely is, it is not that easy
to understand. 

Hits welcome.

I tend to agree (if you replace `very well' by `very conveniently').
Do you have suggestions for improvement?
In a sense I feel that we are bound somewhat by the desire to
emulate a VT100, i.e., font changes really are Esc ( * and Esc ) *.
A good thing would be to throw out mapscrn and to encode the mapping
information in the font, especially now that we have Unicode.
But that would make it less trivial to borrow fonts from other sources.

Date: 10 Oct 1994 21:49:34 GMT
Reply-To: vefatica@mailbox.syr.edu

Very shortly after patch52 came out, a few persons observed an IOCTL error
when using fdformat. I figured it would be better in 1.1.53, but apparently
it isn't so:

        >fdformat /dev/fd0H1440
        Double-sided, 80 tracks, 18 sec/track. Total capacity 1440 kB.
        Formatting ...
        ioctl(FDFMTTRK): I/O error

I've noticed that if you fool around enough with the drive, say mount and
umount a file system on it, then afterwards fdformat does not generate the
error.

Respectfully,

Actually, the selector could be prepared by the kernel at library load
time (at the same time as the __libbase variable is initialized), and
all that needs to be done at entry time is loading the selector into
the appropriate register (9 cycles on 486, 19 on 386).

How does the current PIC code find out where the entrypoint is,
incidentally (i.e. how does the user code call the library)?

Are you sure that it doesn't just treat the FTP control data as 
interactive?  That's how ncftp does it; the control channel (port 21)
is set to lowdelay and the data channel (port 20) is set to high
throughput.

Units 2 and 3 of both floppy controllers are disabled, because
        switching on the motors of these drives causes system hangs on
        some PCI computers.
Added logging of physical floppy write errors to allow safe writing by
        specialized programs.
Some of the floppy code was NOT in a critical region, so cli/sti removed.
Keep a bitmask of changed floppies.
Introduced a bug into the floppy driver.
[Get rid of special_op in hard disk driver.]
No need for special_op unless we're resetting or recalibrating.
Apricot networking driver cleaned up, retry counts increased.
In aha152x SCSI driver, changed irqaction to request_irq, abort
        updated updates for mid-level-driver changes, accept
        unexpected BUSFREE phase as error condition, parity check now
        configurable.
The block device filesystem driver now buffers writes.
Deadlock detection added in fcntl()'s F_GETLK, F_SETLK, and F_SETLKW calls.
Problem in memset using a constant character value fixed (some values
        would be zero instead of the constant character).
Coalesce a memory block when a vm file is closed.
Protect a memory block by surrounding it with unusable memory.
arp header definition removed from rarp.c.

Updated kernel-contributors list.
Big changes in floppy controller (too many for me to understand).
IDE driver changes for non-disk devices.
Ramdisk driver can now ask the user for the ramdisk.
Console driver now uses memory at 0xa0000 for black&white maps.
lp driver now modularized.
Change to line discipline -- if EOF char, set TTY_PUSH in flags (gets
        rid of gobble_eof).
tty driver now checks for read permission on ioctls.
PLIP driver uses defines instead of literals.
If the filesystem had to write a buffer, search all the lists again.
If the filename being executed is invalid, be sure to return an error.
Buffering added to ext2 fs.
Locking was checking for write permission on its arguments, not read.
NFS changes:
        Do not copy data too often around in the kernel.
        In nfs_file_read the return value of kmalloc wasn't checked.
        Put in a better version of read look-ahead buffering. Original idea
        and implementation by Wai S Kok elekokw@ee.nus.sg.
        incorrect XID used to confuse Linux.
        use the correct max size, if reading a packet and
        also verify, if the whole packet has been read...
        more checks should be done in proc.c...
Superblock handler now uses a bitmap for tracking devices.
Improvements to sysv/coherent filesystem (now looks for sysv4).
Permit PCI BIOSes with two Service Directories.
System call for interval timers didn't check for read permission on
its memory.
Add a capability to limit a process's cpu time.
time code in kernel wasn't setting the microseconds field to zero everywhere.
Kernel wasn't checking for read permission in stime or settimeofday syscalls.
Skip past '*' character in kernel's vsprintf code.
Read-only virtual memory wasn't implemented quite right.
Some icmp packets were not being put on right device's transmit queue.
Update the loopback route only if there was already one.
