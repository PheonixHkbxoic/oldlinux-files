Currently under Linux only the Panasonic/SoundBlaster kernel driver
supports PhotoCD. Someone needs to enhance the kernel driver for
Mitsumi.

Could you predict how many tenths of a second will the DOS extenders
spend dealing with timer interrupts during one second? Remember: during
one second they have to handle _18_ timer interrupts. Get a clue.

Yes there is. Get the Alliance-2.0 package. You can ftp the source

You will find it in /ibp/softs/masi/alliance

Alliance is aimed at VLSI synthesis but if that is not your goal
you can still use the VHDL simulator.. BTW, it is a great package.

I am (sometime) working on a complete rewrite of the proc file system
to make it on-the-fly extensible so that (for example) a loaded module
can create nodes in there.

I don't know who is working on /proc/mtab ...

I think conv=auto is completely useless for any continuous use, especially
the way it is implemented now...  (some recognized extensions are treated
as binary and the rest is assumed to be text...  should have been the other
way around!)

It may be useful when you read a file from a floppy or so, but when you
want to mount a harddisk partition I think it is best to use conv=binary
and live with the ^M...

DOSEMU accesses the filesystem just like any other process.  It is not
good to have it communicate more directly, as that would fail e.g. when
using it over a network.
(I use DOSEMU to access a disk via NFS that is a mounted DOS partition
on another machine.  DOSEMU cannot control the DOS filesystem at the
other end!)

The RC-5 remote control sequences used by Philips (and related makes)
equipment are quite well documented, and not difficult to generate
with a computer.
Other makes can be more tricky, as info about the remote control is
often difficult to get.  The method used by "universal remotes" to
handle this situation is to "record" a transmission by the original
remote control, and play that back.

I think some circuits for doing such things have been published in
various electronics magazines...  (e.g. "Elektor"?)

I agree that is not good.  But you won't have this problem
when you limit your userids to 8 characters.

I don't think "8 characters is enough", but it is the practical
limit right now.  The decision to do it like this was probably
made more than 20 years ago...

Note that the filename is the rightmost column in "ls -l" and is
therefore not so badly affected by this problem.

Depends on what you call "screwed up"...  When you have multiple userids
that are unique only after the 8th character they are truncated to the
same id, which I would think is "screwed up"...

>Another point... what about the 'postmaster' ID -- should that

"postmaster" is normally not a user-id on a UNIX system, but is aliased
to the ID of some administrator, like "root" or "mail".

You have to compile with optimization ("-O2") to be able to use the
I/O macros from <asm/io.h>...  May sound funny, but it is true :-)

We resell a bunch of Linux CD's.  None have as catchy a name (for marketing
purposes) as your "Dream Linux" CD.  So how does someone who has such a

Surprisingly, this is not so.  Most of our customers who end up striking out
on their first Linux CD end up calling us back and ordering a different one
hoping for better luck.  In some cases we can help, eg Slackware
Professional from Morse is much easier to install than the Linux Quarterly
(also from Morse).  In others we refund their purchase as their problem
often is incompatible hardware which they are not willing or able to change.

The old vicious cycle.  In Linux's case this cycle is not operating.  The PC
world has been waiting for the last dozen years with growing anticipation
for a "real" operating system to run on their increasingly powerful
machines.  The catch for home users and the self employed has been the cost
of the current alternatives such as SCO and OS/2.  The cost of these OS's,
tools, and applications are much higher than their dos equivalents.  

The use of Linux is not growing exponentially because it is "beautiful"
"fast" "has a great sense of community" or is otherwise socially acceptable.
It is simply because dos users who have been looking for more functionality
are now finding that they can get it without bankrupting themselves.

I would not fret about the lack of commercial software packages.  They are
coming.  Where four months ago there were virtually none, there are now
several dozen commercial packages, and the rate of new introductions is
increasing rapidly.  Sure there are a bunch of potential clouds on the Linux
horizon, but meantime enjoy the ride.

Cheers,  Bob.

   Except you have to add forward=yes to the load line.  Also, be
careful with the gateway part of the bind... I've had better luck
without it, esp. on the segment with the router.  Then just make sure
you're subnets are legal (tcpip.nlm 1.01 allowed illegal class c

I've done driver development for the dialogic voice cards under dos and would 
be interested in undertaking your commission to do them for Lunix (for any card 
you can get complete technical specs for)

I've been programming voice applications off and on for about 8 years now and 
have 4 years experience with Unix. To date I have not had occasion to write a 
Unix device driver.... However.... with the wealth of driver source code 
available for Linux, I do not percieve this as being a serious problem.
