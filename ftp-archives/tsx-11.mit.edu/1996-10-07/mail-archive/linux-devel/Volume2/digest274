Sounds interesting-- I'll take a look at it.  Still, it doesn't 
sound like exactly what I want.  It seems that it still requires
one of these other toolkits to be present, and since it can use
different ones, it doesn't really define a look and feel that will
be consistent.  Of course, you can argue that it is best to leave
it to the user which one they want.  

Just the same, I think I'm still looking for a reasonably complete
widget set with a decent 3d/Motif-ish look and freely available
source.  FWF's stuff is actually pretty close to being it.  Perhaps
the best course is to enhance it until it's all the way there.  It
has a number of widgets in it which are pretty Athena-looking (read
unattractive), but which seem to work fine.  Perhaps if these were 
re-done, and one or two new ones written (like a text widget), it
would be useable all on its own as a complete widget set.

Could be a coincidence; i.e., you might be having the same problem I have had 
twice already (on two different boxes) in the recent past. You rarely use your 
floppies (i.e., the drive is usually empty, right?). Now that the little 
cooling fan in the back of your machine pushes air OUT of your computer, 
correct? Guess where all that air goes in? And guess what is in its way to 
filter out all the dust, etc? You guessed right; it is very likely the opening 
on your floppy drive and your problems can easily be the result of excessive 
dust and dirt in the drive as a result. Unfortunately, it is not always easy 
to clean such a drive (i.e., you might have to take it completely apart).

Subject: svgalib fillblt?

Date: Thu,  6 Oct 94 19:02:00 +0200

(I will also send this to the author of svgalib, hhanemaa@cs.ruu.nl.)

I'm having an odd problem... It seems that the svgalib Cirrus fillblt
routine doesn't work right on my card (CL-GD5426, ISA bus, 1 Mb).

The routine works, but every pixel set operation after calling it sets
every fourth pixel (starting with column 1, not 0!) as color 0 instead
of what it should.

Here's a short piece of code that produces the error:
***
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vga.h>
#include <vgagl.h>

int main()
{
  vga_init();vga_setmode(G320x200x256);gl_setcontextvga(G320x200x256);
  gl_setpalettecolor(0,0,0,0);gl_setpalettecolor(1,63,63,63);
  gl_clearscreen(0);

  gl_fillbox(0,0,129,1,1);
  gl_line(0,5,319,5,1);

  getchar();
  vga_setmode(TEXT);
  exit(0);
}
***

Compiled with gcc, gcc -Wall (no warnings), and gcc -O6 all produce the
same result. (GCC 2.5.8, libc 4.5.26, svgalib 1.11 (19 May 94), all from
Slackware 2.0.0)

Of course, this thing should draw a white horizontal line from 0,0 to
129,0 (using the gl_fillbox() routine, which calls vga_fillblt() on
boxes of over 128 pixels in area), which it does. But the gl_line() call
after that produces a line with every fourth pixel black! The same call
works perfectly if I put it before the gl_fillbox() call...

Another strange thing is that the gl_clearscreen() call doesn't generate
the bug, although it also seems to call vga_fillblt()!

So... Anyone else noticed this problem? Could some other Cirrus owners
check this, please (e-mail the result)?

If it can't be fixed, is it possible to disable fillblts without
recompiling svgalib? Is 1.11 still the newest version?

The essentials of my /usr/local/lib/libvga.config:
mouse mousesystems
monitor 6
C0
c1

I would suspect a hardware problem with my card, but it works in X
(XFree86 2.1)... I think it might be some sort of compatibility problem
with the 5426 and 5428 (or whatever the svgalib driver was made for).
Anyone know about it?

A 1 character packet uses about 100 bytes if that. sock_wfree is called
from kfree_skb() - look harder

It's a pity that the size tracking is used to manage the TCP windows and
you now have a totally invalid broken TCP that will crash if someone sprays
you with tcp frames. 

What is interesting is everyone reporting the problem uses PPP. I've looked
through the PPP driver but I can't see anything wrong with it.

Look in /proc/net/dev (and perhaps /usr/adm/messages) for the specific type
of error you are getting.

Are you connected to the net by the internal transceiver (the default under
Linux) or an external transceiver?  That's often the cause of problems with
the 3c503.

        Reason is generated error-message which will be written into
        log.

        If you kill all log daemons (syslogd. klogd ...), crond and
        update daemon disk remains quiet until you do something that
        needs physical diks access.

        Only trade-off in killing log daemons is that harddisk-errors
        you get when disk spins down will be written to your console.
        
        Best solution would be kernel-builtin disk spin-down.

Subject: mmap() system call in character device drivers
Date: 4 Oct 1994 23:46:41 -0400


I'm in the process of writing a device driver for a memory mapped DSP
board.  The kernel hackers guide indicates that the mmap() function is
not supported for devices other than /dev/memory and should be
avoided, however the kernel hackers guide seems out of date (at least
the one I obtained).

Does anyone know if it is possible to use mmap() (or do_mmap() or
something) to bind a user level process's virtual address to a
physical address?

I want my device driver to have an mmap() entry that will take an
address from the user level program, make sure it is page aligned, and
bind it to a physical address.  If successful, the user should then be
able to use the pointer to access the physial device.

I have a super user level device driver (hacked from the svga lib) but
I don't want to restrict board users to user level processes (they're
boneheads :-) and I don't want them to have super user privileges or
free run of system memory using /dev/mem).



Thanks in advance.....

You might try going into the EISA configuration program on your system
and decreasing the amount of the bus that the 1742 can grab.  It's probably
locking everything else out long enough so that you can't receive stuff
from the serial port quickly enough.

Sorry, I don't have one set up here, so I can't tell you exactly what the
settings are -- I just remember that they exist.

By the way, the same thing can happen with a 1542.  On the C version,
you can change the bus master settings with the program you reach by
typing Control-A during boot; on earlier versions of the 1542, you
change switches or jumpers on the card.

Is the system recognizing it as an Ultra?  Did you recompile kernal to
remove elite support and add ultra?  I'm using SMC ultra in our file

But there are fiber optic transcievers available (but mono- and multimode)
to put on 'ordinary' network cards with AUI connectors. That way every
card can be turned into a fibre card. It is even possible to get them
for full-duplex so you can reach distances up to 30 miles ! (point-to-point 
only). Mail me for info on those trancievers if you want some models and prices.

Subject: Q: Max # of ftp/gopher/http users on a Linux PC?
Date: 6 Oct 1994 15:10:25 -0700

All,

Our company is considering making a Linux equipped PC an ftp/gopher/http
server, but I don't know if such machines are able to handle the load. We
will ultimately be giving the machine its own router and 56k line, but we
have no idea what CPU's are appropriate -- 486 DX2/66, P60, P66, P90,
etc. The PC would have 16 Meg ram and at least a gig SCSI drive.

What I'm really looking for is something like: "a 486-66 starts to bog
down at 100 ftp logins transferring data out, but a p60 could take at
least 400 without breaking into a sweat".

We aren't sure what the average size of concurrent ftp/http accesses will
be, but we would like to be more than 200. If a Linux PC is simply
incapible of doing this, we would probably get a used Sun.

Feel free to email or post your answers. I could really use your help. Thanx

Virtually,
warr
