First of all great thanks to Paul Mackerras who maintains the ppp-2.1.2.
Really a nice job (how about posting your address I couldnt find it anywhere).

Here is the question:

        When pppd starts up it runns ip-up script which should set up 
        the routing info and stuff.  I have no problems connecting
        however inside that script I decided to put commands which 
        would keep the link up all the time.  The server I connect to
        kicks me off in about 2min if there is no trafic on the link.
        However the ping command (dont flame me here) I run to keep
        the link up doesnt keep it up when ran from inside the ip-up.
        It works perfectly fine when I type it from the prompt as 
        soon as the interface comes up though.
        
        What I mean by it not working is not some prosaic errors such
        as network is unreachable.  It works fine but cant keep the
        link up for some reason.  If I remove it from ip-up and run
        it manually when the connection is established it works 
        fine and the link stays for as long as the phone line noise
        doesnt kill it.

        What is the problem?  I have complete debug logs of all sessions
        for those who want to see them.  

        I also modified and added some cool things to the generic scripts
        ppp-on and ppp-off.  I can post them here but I would like to
        reach the people who maintain the package to have them included
        as they please.

Thanks,

-Kapi

Subject: Korn Shell '93 Now Available from AT&T
Date: Sat, 24 Sep 1994 11:09:15 GMT

Awhile back I inquired about the status of Korn Shell '93, which
is the latest release of ksh.

Nobody responded, presumbly, because nobody knew.  I did a little
digging and got some information and thought I would share it....

Previously known as ksh93 (1995 is fast approaching :-), it is
now known as PKSH or Programmer's Korn Shell.  Note that this is NOT
the same as PDKSH, which is public-domain ksh.

PKSH is definitely not public domain.

Release notes for PKSH:

        - POSIX-compliant

        - supports associative arrays

        - supports floating-point arithmetic

        - support of macro expansion syntax to specify substrings
          and sub-arrays

        - the "." character can now be used in variables

        - supports compound statements

        - supports "discipline" functions

        - the compound command "|," which negates the return value of the
          following pipeline has been added

        - on systems which support dynamic loading, it is now possible
          to add built-in commands at runtime with the command 'builtin'.

        - an addition format for literal strings

        - an option added that causes the value of a variable to be
          treated as a reference to another variable so that variables
          can be indirectly named.

        - the KEYBD trap has been added which makes it possible to program
          your key bindings in PKSH.

        - a variety of new variables has been added

        - there is a compile time option which enables creation of a
          relational database for commands, variables, and functions
          defined and referenced by a script.  PKSH can read and evaluate
          pre-compiled scripts generated by a separate program.

According to the AT&T representative, Ed Cartier:

     "The Labs raised some software packaging and porting issues
     that may make it impractical for us to license source code.
     
     Prices for the binary version of K-shell '93 are $99 per copy
     (per cpu) until December 31, 1994. Orders placed after that date
     will be licensed at $149 per copy. We will also write a site
     license, for a variety of platforms, without restriction as to
     the number of users or cpus, for $10,000."
     

The AT&T representative is Ed Cartier (ecartier@attmail.com) of the
AT&T Intellectual Property Division and his phone number is (908) 580-5719.

Please direct any inquiry to Ed, not me.

P.S. Followups telling me how great Perl is will be ignored.  :-) :-) :-)

Subject: (U)MSDOS fs attributes
Reply-To: hpa@nwu.edu (H. Peter Anvin)
Date: Fri, 23 Sep 1994 08:49:22 GMT

Hi everyone.
I am working on releasing a new version of color-ls, when it struck me
it would probably be a useful addition to be able to view attribute
flags in addition to the normal UNIX fs flags.  Currently two
filesystems used by Linux uses any form of extended flags as far as I
know: ext2 and msdos.  ext2fs seems to use some form of ioctl()'s to
query or set the flags, but I don't know of any way of accessing the
MS-DOS RHSA flags.  If this is possible, please let me know.

In addition, I think it would be nice if the UMSDOS filesystem would
use the HIDDEN attribute for the --linux-.--- file.  It looks untidy
to have it around while running DOS.  Maybe it is just me, probably
because of the way I use the UMSDOS filesystem: I use it for selected
directories on my DOS partition, where I want to be able to stick some
UNIX files, for example in directories with image files it is nice to
be able to have an .xvpics directory for xv thumbnails.

On the other hand, most of these utilities have been integrated into the 
World Wide Web protocol and can be accessed via clients. When you are 
using a terminal one could use Lynx for ftp, telnet connections, gopher
and much more! Definitively a great tool...

The single-access is a limitation in ftpfs itself.  Basically the
author was tring to simplify things by assuming no two users will want
to look around or transfer from the same site.  Queuing requests to a
single connection isn't good because one user could initiate a huge
transfer and then until it's finished, no one could even list directories.

This really sounds more like a full-blown mirror than a cache.  If you
have enough space and enough transfer bandwidth, mirroring would be a
better idea anyway.

Ftpfs uses the ftp connection to check timestamps on files there.  It
uses the timestamp to decide when cache entries are invalid.  ("dirty"
implies that you're caching writes which probably isn't what you
meant.)

Now this is an interesting idea.  You'd have to hide the fact that the
mirror may be mirroring in a subdirectory somewhere.  so perhaps

mkdir /ftpfs/sunsite.unc.edu

if sunsite were down (couldn't happen :) would open a mirror "blah"
and point sunsite to the appropriate subdirectory:

/ftpfs > ls -l
drwxrwxrwx 1 anonymous   10 Jul 23  1993 blah
lrwxrwxrwx 1 anonymous   10 Jul 23  1993 sunsite.unc.edu->blah/mirrors/sunsite

But then the user should be aware of this so he doesn't try to upload
to the mirror (unless mirrors know how to handle uploads to their
mirror hierarchy)

You can use the 152x driver by Juergen Fischer

distribution. I run a Connor 1GB disk attached to the 6360 in the

Use net-tools-1.1.46 or similar. net-032d is oldish and ddi is no more.

Subject: A badly missed feature in gcc
Date: 23 Sep 1994 05:01:40 -0500

I wish gcc for Linux could handle // comments.  Before you answer,
"use g++!", keep in mind that C++ generates a lot of restrictions
and stuff that vanilla C will let slide.  There are also new keywords
like class, new, and delete we often use.  This is a convenience
that most native compilers and some ports of gcc support.  Is there
some mysterious method I'm not aware of?  I'm currently running a
//-stripper program on all my *.c and *.h files which means I need
to keep a seperate source tree for Linux versions of anything I
do.  It's a great anti-motivator to keeping stuff up to date.

Please reply via e-mail if you have clues on this.  Will post
responses.  Thanks!

Is there any valid reason for user mode programs to include
<linux/config.h>, and thus <linux/autoconf.h>?  I don't think a
compile-time decision should be made about a kernels features based on
what I last compiled into a kernel (any kernel).

I would say that in general it is probably a mistake to include anything
directly from /usr/include/linux.  Exceptions to this are programs that
do something Linux specific (like convert 38400 baud to 115200).

I don't think you should complain about this!  In most cases, the
ext2fs will be used on a hard disk, and if so it would merely be a
huge waste of time to have the CPU byte-swap eveything around.

No real need for an option.  The magic number for an ext2fs is 0xEF53.
If you instead read a magic number of 0x53EF, go to byte-swapped mode.
The only place where you might need an option is in mke2fs, and it
might be convenient to have an e2fsck option (or separate program) to
change an fs to the other endianism, but it has to be done *extremely*
carefully so that a power failure in the middle of the operation will
not lose data.  (It may make the filesystem useless, that is OK, but
it should be possible to resume the byte-swapping operation and end up
with a valid filesystem.
