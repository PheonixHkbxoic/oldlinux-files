But it's overkill.  You don't need special support from the keyboard
drivers to support input methods.  All you need is for the input
consumer to map internally.  Most input methods work by running as
a separate process rather than being embedded into the OS.

Again, this is best solved in the application, not the GUI (and
especially not the display driver).

Of course, this begs the issue of getting 'ls' to display with a
mixture of left-to-right and right-to-left scripts - but running
'ls' (or more likely, an 'nls') inside a multilingual window
solves this.  I think it's better to start there and make progress
than to ponder how to fit all that code into the console device...

I keep hearing about how UTF-8 is just around the corner, and how the ker-
nel has removed all assumptions about characters and strings.  Yet a quick
perusal of the source brings to light a host of constructs in the source
that violate ANSI principles of internationalization.  For example, in
./include/linux/ctype.h we find the following macro:

#define tolower(c) (_ctmp=c,isupper(_ctmp)?_ctmp-('A'-'a'):_ctmp)
#define toupper(c) (_ctmp=c,islower(_ctmp)?_ctmp-('a'-'A'):_ctmp)

Let me quote for a moment from the internationalization FAQ.  Admit-
tedly this applies to ANSIfied user programs.  Perhaps the kernel can
always assume ISO 8859-1 encoding.  Still, I suspect that most pro-
grammers here in the U.S. are still doing things the "old" way:

****************************  quoted material ******************************

If you write a program which supports international use, you should
use the available standardized functions, as only these will be
influenced by the setlocale call. Thus, if you want to convert a
capital letter in c to a lower case letter in l, _don't_ write:

l = c - 'A' + 'a';

While this will work for characters in the US-ASCII character set, it
will not work with German, French, or Spanish characters. The
following, standard-conformant code will:

#include <ctype.h>

....

l = tolower(c);

Also note that the second code is FASTER (for most implementations),
as it replaces arithmetic by a simple table lookup!

Note that this ANSI standard is independent of the character set
encoding used!

************************  end quoted material **************************

Here's another tidbit of the same sort from the HPFS code:

    static inline int memcasecmp(const unsigned char *s1,
                                 const unsigned char *s2, unsigned n)
    {
        int t;
        if (n != 0)
                do {
                        unsigned c1 = *s1++;
                        unsigned c2 = *s2++;
                        if (c1 - 'a' < 26)
                                c1 -= 040;
                        if (c2 - 'a' < 26)
                                c2 -= 040;
                        if ((t = c1 - c2) != 0)
                                return t;
                } while (--n != 0);
        return 0;
    }
 
Again, I don't pretend to be a guru.  I see this sort of thing in much of
the source code I peruse, thoug.

I believe that this has been in for quite a while. I'm using 1.1.18
with a netmask of 255.255.252.0, so I'd suspect that probably 1.1.0
and later work, and maybe even 1.0.x. Try it out and see if it works
with what you've got.

Well, not to worry in my case, I've decided to sell my new Powerbook 
520 and just get a PC laptop. I can always emulate a Mac using Executor,
which will certainly be necessary, as I'm a Mac developer.

Of course, the question is which laptop to get. I've posted asking
whether Linux runs on the Fosa DX4/100 or DX2/66, but I got no
affirmative responses last time I checked. All I know at this point
is that I did get Linux running recently on a Toshiba 1910, though it
was slow. And Linux seems to need 12 MB of RAM, which most laptops
don't allow (it's either 4, 8 or 16). I found that without 12, the 
beginning of any paging or swapping marks the start of really bad 
performance until a reboot. Though I was using UMSDOS, perhaps that
was a factor.

It sure would be nice to have a big list of machines to show people
tallies of whether Linux runs of machine X or not and comments.
Speed tests would be helpful too. That way people wouldn't have to 
post asking, and miss making a connection with someone who actually 
has an answer.

For sure, but I didn't make a comment about his Ethernet programming
abilities. I made a statement that his description of a work
environment (i.e., an organizational context) is not appropriate.
That's a different area. -- And his followup already said that he
didn't want to imply that NE2000s match typical workstation ethernet
equipment. So we seem to agree on this point... :-)

LD_LIBRARY_PATH is a hack, and a painful one at that.

1) It increases load time
2) It applies for _all_ libraries, not just the one you're interested with.
3) It interacts badly with ld, such that when things are compiled with
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH set, the program then assumes that it will continue
   to be set.

The Right Way to implement this kind of filesystem would be a
user-space process, reading and writing the raw device -- essentially
just using /dev/hd<foo> as a database.  Putting it in the kernel gains
you nothing but more kernel bloat.

        Way back in pl14 I did something very much like this. I never 
released the patch because I thought it was a quick hack no one but me 
would be interested in.

        Personally, I like the idea. I would prefer it if the kernel 
asked a user-space daemon rather than hard coding the access rules, 
however. (I didn't do it this way because I am too lazy).

        Unfortunately, changing the user ids on an operating system is a 
damn pain. Maybe we could make the highest 256 user ID's special.

Well, Linux's load balancing is not what you think. As you might have seen,
it is put in the middle of network configuration. Load balancing is a way to
route packets between different ways, depending on their load.

Agreed.  This is simply what the FAQ says.  Of course the point is that
speed doesn't matter here.  Don't use 'a' to mean 97 if you plan on using
ANSI C in a portable, localizable fashion.  Use 'a' to mean the symbol
"a" (whatever its underlying representation might be in the character set
you're using).

And of course this is just one small issue.  There are many others to
consider, such as not writing code that assumes a certain date format.

And there's the whole issue of avoiding assumptions about character
width.

I think it will be a while before we all get used to thinking about pro-
gramming in a new light.  Perhaps it is an advantage to have a system
that lacks a lot of baggage from the 70s....
