As I understand the PCI specification you can build a bare motherboard with
a SCSI interface chip, a PCI to isa bridge, some timers/clocks and four PCI
connectors. Slow I/O devices as mouse, keyboard, serial and Ethernet are
linked via the additional isa bus slots as usual. Now we plug in a PCI
graphics card and a CPU module and our system runs. We even have two slots
left.

  This would be the ideal board to give the CPU manufactures good
competition. And porting is as easy as possible, as you only have to port
the parts dependig on the CPU module. I don't want to mention the
upgradability this solution provides.

  I don't know, if someone offers such a board, though :(

I succeeded in repeating the error.. (files corrupting mostly during
heavy disk activity. File length not changing, but about 8 bytes
having bit inversions..)
 
So, I have two files of the same length, the other one is uncorrupted
and the other one is corrupted. This IS a real-life example unlike the
one I had improvised, that I posted about a week ago..
 
Now, what do I need to do to get the right people look at the problem?
I might transfer the files somewhere, or I might extract the needed offset
myself, if I get proper instructions on how to do it.

It does not do interrupt-per-byte.  Of course, a decent 64-128k serial

The point is that the listed prices are way over what they really cost.

My little ISA bus 486 has little trouble besting low-end workstations
in anything (Sun 4/110's and Sparcstation 1's).  It will do some integer
ops faster than a Sun 2.  The Sun 2's FPU will eat mine alive but for
$10000 it should beat it on *ALL* counts.  It doesn't.

A typical workstation equal to my 486 box would cost enough for me to
buy two 486's just like mine and I'd have money left over for the latest
Linux Developer's CD.

I'd love to have a workstation but given that by the time I can afford
one there will be little or no difference between a PC and a workstation
(as if there really is one now) so who cares?  Workstations are generally
overpriced still.  Software for them is even worse.

The technical information that I have about the DEC MIPS machines is exactly
nothing except that I know the endianess and the CPU type. However it is
reasonable to make the assumption about the DEC machines/TurboChannel that
they both mostly use chips which are being used in other types of machines,
too. If that assumption is true porting of the board depended part of Linux
should be quite easy. Furthermore I tried not to use R4x00 specials where ever possible without performance penalty. This should make porting to R3000
type machines easier, too. If a MACH or NetBSD port should be available for
the DEC machines this could deliver lots of helpful sources, too.

From the impression that I have there are lots of these DEC machines out
there. Nearly at the same time at which we announced our Linux port users of
DEC machines started asking about support for their machines. But from the
experience that I have with the Linux/68k port from Amiga to Atari I expect that it might take months to find someone to volunteer for some weeks of
work :-(

I hope I could motivate some DEC owners/users/hackers to port Linux to the
DEC architecture!

Yes, and how fortunate - even Linus' biggest patches fit on an old double density disk. But who still uses disks anyway... And since this thread is some how MIPS related I think I should use the oportunity that the MIPS port - at least for the Deskstation Tyne boards - will only blow up the kernel sources by some hundred kilobytes (unpacked). So I don't think that there will be an argument to discuss "kernel bloat" - especially since the efficiency
in both speed and size of the Intel-kernel won't be affected.

You can use that way if you have decided to build an portable OS before you actually start to write one. Unfortunately for Linux the other way has been choosen. The final result is just the same.

Many non-Intel systems use either ISA, EISA or PCI cards. This enables them to use nearly the same drivers like Intel bases systems do. Many other use the same chips. So don't expect lots more drivers for the near future. About CDROMs - most systems need only one CDROM driver, the SCSI CDROM driver. Blame the PC soundcard industry for inventing lots of highly driver compatible CDROM "standards".

Uh, it is possible to run f2c+gcc in place of f77 on platforms besides
Linux, just not adviseable except for benchmarking purposes.  He could

I once saw someone on Usenet suggest this convention:

     Variables that should be exactly this size.
  int8u, int16u, int32u, ...:
     Variables that can be larger to increase speed. Many machines

I second that motion. It is time people stopped kidding themselves and
realize that 'C' and 'C++' are really just turbo-charged assembly
languages. It seems absurd that after 20+ years we still deal with
address pointer arithmetic so much in complex applications. The idea that
the "size" of our base types is somehow "configurable" really just adds
an uneeded complexity. And these synonyms could be added into the language
without too much difficulty.

I have been setting up a linux machine to act as an internet host
on a novell network and got ip and tcp up sharing the ethernet
now we have several segments on different hardware that we
would also like to have access to the linux box.
the problem is that the packets reach the novell server 
and it does not know that they are for the linux box on the other
network card so it tosses it.
I found a program for novell that will encapsulate the ip packets
in ipx packets. the packets will get to the linux box but
it tosses them because they are not ip packets 
If I knew enough about the network code in linux I would
be able to strip the ipx header and have an IP packet

any sugestions?

Subject: NFSD debug logging error

I am trying to debug a problem with a PC-based NFS client to NFSD on
Linux and have noticed that the output from log_call in logging.c does
not appear in /var/log as expected.

At line 136 of logging.c is the following:

dprintf(1, "%s]\n\t%s\n", buff, arg);

The output in my log includes the contents of buff but not of arg;
which, of course, is what I wish to see.

I have searched the code but am blind to the reason for this.

The problem I am trying to solve is why some mounts fail the tests
after line 92 in mountd.c and return NFSERR_ACCES or NFSERR_NOTDIR.
(I would also be interseted to know why this code allows one to
mount a file as well as a directory.)

Thanks for any help.

Stephen.
