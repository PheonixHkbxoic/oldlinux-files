It has been shown that the synchronous updating of metadata is the wrong
thing to do.  You may have a system which shows no fsck errors after a
crash, but has garbage in the newly created files anyway.
I'd rather lose a new file alltogether than have it in the directory and
have crap in it instead of the data I wrote.

Of course there is development in Linux, and FFS is old.  So the picture
may well change over time.  But I have not had ext2 corruption problems
ever since I started using it, so I can't comment on e2fsck.

It is easy to configure it so that it will fsck very often.  But when that
is required you probably have some hardware problem.  Or maybe you shutdown
your system by simply cutting the power while it is expiring the news??

You can enable "slower but safer synchronous inode and directory updates"
for ext2fs as well, but as mentioned before it is not safer at all.

Maybe you can help by getting some specs from the OS/2 guys and forwarding
it to the HPFS developer, so that he doesn't have to do as much guessing?

Is there a good reason not to use the encapsulation recommended in RFC1201?
(or is it the one used by ARCether?  the name seems to point to ethernet,
but that may just be the interface to the upper layers)

I'm using a Zeos P90 PCI - it has only been a few days since I installed,
though.  Seems like it runs just fine and smaller load on heavy tasks than
I get on NETCOM at 3:30 am ;)  I haven't got X to run yet; xinit complains
about a missing config file.  My configuration is:

  Zeos P90, 16 MB RAM, 540 MB IDE HD & 340 MB IDE HD, Mitsumi CD-ROM (*),
  2 * 16550 serial ports, Phoenix BIOS (v4.0??), Diamond Stealth 64 (using
  the S3 Vision 964 64-bit chip - not tested yet...), Practical Peripherals
  PM14400FXMT modem - not tested yet), Microsoft mouse (not tested yet).

I been throught a lot of the standard Unix utils, and they all seem to run
just fine.

(*) The Mitsumi drive, as configured by Zeos, needs the command "mcd=0x310,10"
when booting the Mitsumi kernel otherwise Linux won't recognize the drive.

  Just thought I'd second that. I've taken a look at wxWindows and

  list. Julian Smart that started wxWindows seems to be very active
  to upgrade it regularly. It has a very nice manual and a lot of
  add ons. Currently, a GUI builder that generates the wxWin code

  For someone that wants to start some GUI programming without

  programming, definitely a very nice alternative.

There is allready a driver for the Teles/S0 card which was written for linux
BUT it uses a port of the NetBSD-Networking code so it should be less trouble
to port than one might think. It currently supports the german TR6 standard
but it shouldn't be to difficult to add support for Euro-ISDN and the US
standard. Any way it's a start and it might be worth looking into.

Date: 2 Oct 1994 02:29:17 GMT

I am using a toshiba 1910 with a megahertz pcmcia modem.  I downloaded the 
set of drivers (pcmcia-2.2), upgraded my kernel to 1.1.49, and installed the
new module utilites.

When I start the machine, the card manager is started.  It finds the modem,
and creates the symbolic link to /dev/modem.  However, if i try to access it, 
through seyon, minicom, or using echo atd > /dev/modem, all I hear are clicks
from the speaker.  I can get any response from the modem (no OK, no ERROR).  If
anyone has any better luck or clues, I would appreciate it.

Hip! I have exactly same problmes 1 and 2 without slip !!!!!!! Not the

I have a 66MHz 486 + 32MB RAM + 2GB disk + 2000 (!) user accounts in my 
Linux box.

Usually it works nice, but sometimes the whole net software seems to
do nothing with the new connections.  Login opens the window and
connects, but no "login:" prompt.  Same problems with smtp
connections, they jammmm similar way.  I think all telnet connections
hang somehow or are extremely slow.

In the begining I got "no more sockets" to the /usr/adm/messages.  I
doubled the socket tables in kernel.  It did actually not help,
expect I am not getting "no more sockets" into the /usr/adm/messages.

My laste experiment: I did delete smtp from inetd.conf and started to
run sendmail directly "standalone". I do not know if it helps. I have
not had problems after that, but the week is in the begining. :-(

: If the lockup occurs, allowing the telnet session with the locked

This is interesting. I have not noticed that.  Must check it next time

Subject: tar cM   possible (probable?) bug
Date: Mon, 3 Oct 1994 15:06:58 GMT

I made a backup of my dos partition using the command 'tar cM *', and
it worked fine and prompted me for the 3 volumes needed.  Then
when I was restoring (after reformatting the dos partition and changing
the partition type to primary bootable instead of extended) I used
the command 'tar xM'.   it worked until it propmted me for the second volume,
and then it reported (after I put the second volume in and hit return)
'this is not volume 2, insert volume 2'  (paraphrased).
  
  It refused to continue the multivolume tar no matter what I did.
Fortunatly, when I did a 'tar x' on the second volume it restored 
all files except for the first file which was continued from volume 1.
I only lost the file that spanned vol 1&2 and the file spanning 2&3,
all the rest of the files I got back ( using tar x instead of tar xM)

Is this a Bug?   I have an adaptec 1542B and the 65MB QIC scsi tape drive
(the tape drive came from my sun 386i, it might be only 60MB but 65MB fit)
Also, I am running linux 1.1.18.
Is this where to complain about it?
