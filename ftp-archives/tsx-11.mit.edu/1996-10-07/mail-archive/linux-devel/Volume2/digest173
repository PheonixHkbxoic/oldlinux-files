I don't see how these values work. With a 25 MHz clock, with total V. lines =
400, and total H. lines 225, we're looking at a refresh rate of roughly

25E6 / (400 x 1.1 x 225 x 1.05) = 240 

This is way above the spec of any monitor I'm familiar with. Or am I missing 
something obvious ?

Subject: Kernel Problems?
Date: Wed, 14 Sep 94 11:28:35 -0500

Hi Guyz.
 
Lately I have developed a problem on my system.  I was running version
1.1.28  of the kernel.  After running with no problems for several weeks the
system started to crash every night :(.  Since this started I have tried  up-
grading to 1.1.35 but that did not help any.
 
Here are the specs for the system:
  CMO 486Dx2/66
  32M RAM
  Future Domain TMC-1680
  Micropolis 1Gig HD
  1 Generic Multi I/O card
  1 2 1/2 FDD
  1 Boca BB2016 (16 port board)
  WangDAT Tape drive.
 
From the syslog and messages files in /var/adm I looked through some
of the errors.  They almost always have a different IEP listed.
Here is a list of a couple of them:
  00010003 (___get_free_pages)
  001249b0 (_find_buffer)
  00178216 (_rs_write)
  00119774 (_do_exit)
 
I got the function names from zSystem per instructions in README file.
 
If anyone can help me please send me a note, if you need ALL of the info from
 /var/adm/messages I can e-mail them, this damn news reader at delphi
ain't the best :).

The current MSS support in VoxWare is not perfect. There are some problems 
with the soft config registers for DMA and IRQ. For that reason some IRQ and
DMA combinations work and some other don't. I have been using a SG NX Pro 16
with DMA0 and IRQ10 but the same settings don't work with SW32.

If anybody knows how the config registers (base+0 to base+3) of the Windows
Sound System work, please contact me.

Featuritis is one thing I hope it doesn't develop. It's also one reason why
getting the kernel more modular important. Having a driver for everything
is all well and good so long as they can be downloaded seperately. The core
kernel certainly is far from finished in all respects. It lacks enough
loadable module support, the buffer cache needs cleaning up to handle 
non blockmapped filesystems (like NFS), the scheduler is a walking disaster
area, and the 1.1.x network as will go into 1.2.0 has some very naive
assumptions about drivers and can't cleanly layer protocols (this lot is
under work - I guess people are working on some of the others too). Those
I don't see as featuritis but definite improvements. 

I guess one thing that would be a good general project for someone wanting
to go kernel hacking would be to read through all the code spot and clean
up duplication and switch and improve algorithms where they stand out as
bad (again the scheduler comes to mind). Like IBM have squashed OS/2 for
2.2, to squash Linux.

I can't imagine that the DOS extenders which come with the commercial
compilers are significantly less performant than the free DOS extender
that comes with DJGPP, so the comparison can still be made, running
all the executables under MSDOS, with their extenders.

Alliance covers so small subset of VHDL that it is virtually useless in
term of doing design using Alliance.  It may be a great tool to learn the VLSI
design-synthesis-layout-verification flow, but definitely not a VHDL
tool for design, IMHO.

Let me tell you what you can do in Alliance: Boolean functions, 
flip flops, muxes. That is all. No conditional statement (like if...then),
no sequential statement (like process), no file I/O (so don't expect to 
create test bench), and no arithmatic operations (like + - * /).  
Overall, you can not do behavioral modeling in Alliance.

Worset of all, all files in document directory were empty.

I wish I was wrong.  Using Alliance would save me $3K to buy Model 
Tech's package.  Again, it totally depends on what you are expecting out
of Alliance.  In term of a design modeling, I suggest you stay away
from Alliance.

Is there an encrypted file system for Linux? Now, anyone can boot
off a floppy, mount your file systems and read everything. Maybe someone
has patched the ext2fs so as to encrypt data before any write and decrypt
it after any read? (Actually, it's more complicated when the kernel is on
an encrypted file system, and obtaining the key at mount time might be
non trivial too).

Hi:
  I would like to write a modem diagnostic program for Linux of the sort
I used to write for DOS in assembler.  But I don't want to write in assembler.
I want to use C, and am admittedly no wiz. Anyway, I 'ioperm' the correct
ports, then go to use inb(), and get the "undefined reference to __inb_p()"
message, or something to that affect, so I know it's tracing it back to
asm/io.h. Am I leaving out an include file, or do I have to fill out the
port call w/some sort of define? A one or 2 line example of code would
be greatly appreciated!

Ok.. what's the deal with g++ and templates?  Everytime I use templates, my
cc1 compilation pass takes a massive amount of memory.

For example, I've got a template instantiation file that I use to create

a 700K file.

When g++ gets ahold of it, it requires almost 18 megabytes of memory!  Why?
Is there something I can do about this?  The resulting object file is only
300K or so. (No debug symbols)  I'm using GCC 2.6.0 with the following
command line:

        g++ -I- -I./(etc..) -c Templates.c

Perhaps I misunderstood.  If so, it would not be the first time.
In discussion of the HPFS code, for example, someone mentioned that
the way the driver was implemented was part of the HPFS standard,
and not part of Linux.  My question is this:  Just because the ac-
cepted standards for HPFS in one environment insist on consistent
character mappings, does this mean that within another environment
(GCC/ANSI C/Linux) these mappings will always be the same?  I am
not trying to push any particular line here.  If someone knows the
answer I'd appreciate being enlightened.

GCC doesn't/didn't know about the ARM's weird (but neat) conditional
skip on any instruction. I understand thats in gcc 2.6.x. Has anyone
compared this with Acorns compiler.
As to size - gcc is lumbering and a memory eater. Gcc could definitely
do with a diet.

You don't do anything so daft as to include OS calls in a benchmark. You are
trying to test the compiler not the OS. You also unplug the network and
serial ports so you don't have streams of (eg mouse) interrupts disturbing
the raw code throughput.
