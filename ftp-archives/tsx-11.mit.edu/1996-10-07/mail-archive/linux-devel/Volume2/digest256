Subject: Linux Device Driver info needed
Date: Sun, 2 Oct 1994 16:25:51 GMT

   This is probably a FAQ, but I couldn't find this newsgroup's FAQ on rtfm
or anywhere else, so here goes...
   I need to write a device driver for Linux.  I looked through the
src/linux/drivers directory, and found some good examples but no
documentation.  Is there any documentation on the linux kernel anywhere?
   If there isn't, could somebody point me to a device driver that accesses
a device on the memory bus by doing memory accesses instead of using the
outb/inb calls?  All the standard drivers seemed to use the I/O bus.  I
suppose that the hardware I'll be using could be modified to look for I/O
accesses instead of memory accesses (it'll be a custom card), but I'd
prefer to access it as memory.
   Thanks!  Please email me responses.  I'm not sure that I can keep up
with the bandwidth of this newsgroup.

The lack of a MAC address shouldn't stop it working assuming that the
bootp server "knows" who you are by some other means (e.g. it knows
what physical port you are on or who you logged in as.)

However in all versions of bootpc I've released so far it didn't work,
'cos I always put the ARPHRD_ETHER type in the htype bootp field.

On NET3 (1.1.14+ I think) based kernels you can extract the correct
hardware type from any interface using SIOCGIFHWADDR so it should just
work correctly with that fix to the bootpc code.

However I've not got a SLIP (or PPP etc) line to test this on so I'm
on rather shakey ground where this is concerned.

Could someone with a SLIP line and a new(ish) kernel run the bootpc
(0.31) code thus:

  bootpc --dev sl0 --verbose --debug

andmail me all the output?

Subject: TMC-850 on IRQ 11 no workee...
Reply-To: ecarp@netcom.com
Date: Wed, 28 Sep 1994 13:45:42 GMT

I have this really flaky Adaptec 1542B, so I decided to dust off a TMC-850
compatible card and use it.  Since I have a four-port comm card, I decided
to switch the TMC-850 over to IRQ 11.  I changed the IRQ #define in
seagate.c to 11, rebuilt the kernel, and rebooted.  (1.1.51).

The kernel booted, recognized the card as an ST-0X, but recognized my
Maxtor as not only LUN 0, but also LUN4 and 7!  Then it proceeded to
delete some entries (bogus, but it didn't say which ones it was deleting),
and go on. 

The kernel read the partition table OK, but right after it did, it gave me
the message "SCSI error ... id 4 lun 0 rc=27010000", then "I/O error 0810
sector 0, unable to read partition table of dev 0810".  Then the kernel
panicked: "kernel panic: no device passed to allocate_device()".  The root
device is /dev/sda3 (0803).  I have six partitions on this SCSI drive. The
drive itself is a Maxtor 1.2GB HD. 

This same card worked on a pre-1.0 kernel, and it works with the Summer
1994 Yggdrasil kernel. 

The machine is basically down for the moment, since the Adaptec card is
pretty flaky, and I don't have the spare cash to replace it.  Help??

Funny thing about this is that the operating system I working on in 1970
(I was doing systems testing) did exactly this.  (Well, not CDs as they
didn't exist).  It was a commercial system (and still is -- CSTS on Univac
mainframes).  Customers paid more for faster storage (drum, disk, tape).
All they had to do was change the storage class of a file (with a simple
command sort of like chmod) and the system would asynchronously move the
file.

Then, if they executed a file (just entered it's name) and it was on tape
they would have to wait and the operator would get a tape mount message.
The user never really knew what tape the file was on -- that was up to the
system.  Worked really slick and certainly could work in a similar fashion
with Linux.

In the stock version of the Linux there are no streams. Looks like 
people don't think it's needed. For portability reasons it's definately
needed though I believe. There is one version of the kernel which has
streams support - but I don't know how well it goes with the current
release of the Linux. And how complete it is. Maybe author of it will
comment what's new with streams. And maybe it's the time to put streams
into the kernel permanantly. I personally have to run somwhat crap
Unix named Interactive on the machine that uses streams device driver.
Anyway - streams are quite usefull - and combined with loadable modules
are very practical.

p.s. Too much of kernel space programmi8ng is a HUGE security hole though...

Thanks Patrick!  Our defualt transports file did _NOT_ have the 
'check_path' attribute.  I put it in yesterday, and now (it seems) the 
hole is plugged!  The interesting thing is that smail doesn't complain to 
the sender of the .forward mail message that the post failed, but the 
smail log file does report 'permission denied' if the owner of the 
.forward file does not have write permission to the directory the 
.forward file is pointing to [ I hope that last sentence made sense! :) ]

Thanks again for everyones help.  BTW, our Linux OS was a Slackware

        Thomas E Zerucha (zerucha@shell.portal.com)
and     Steve Kneizys (STEVO@acad.ursinus.edu)
for confirming what we've been seeing!  I suggest we keep this thread 
open and fill it with additional information until the problem gets the 
attention it needs.  I'm not a programmer, much less a kernel hacker, so 
I can only voice frustration with the situation.

Some additional information gleened from observations:

First, the original problem as I originally mentioned it:  

We are running slip to our internet provider, and intermittantly
experience telnet lockups during logins.  The system either 1) refuses
connections 2) accepts the connection, but just sits 3) provides a login
prompt, takes input, and never gives the password prompt (ususally
creating a login zombie in the process). 

Additional information/trends noticed:

If the lockup occurs, allowing the telnet session with the locked
connection to sit while starting another is *always* successful.  It
*appears* that a particular ttyp# gets buggered somehow, and forcing the
system to seek another one will get you in.  I.E.  We've had *tons* of
complaints about ttyp1 and ttyp4 lately (although I've seen the problem
also on ttyp3 in the past). 

In the event 'refused connections' are the symptom to those telnetting in
over the SLIP connection, logging in by adding an x-term *on the console*
that grabs the offending ttyp port will suddenly allow SLIP telnet
accesses. 

I thought that once a user was successfully logged in, everything was
fine.  However, I have had complaints of 'gradual slowing' or 'gradual
slowing then locking' from a couple of users.  I intiially dismissed this
as 'net problems', but after hearing Michael Haardt's comment, I'm
beginning to think that's what's happening to us as well.  I also suspect
that other 'general' user complaints about our 'slowness' at times would
turn out to be the same thing as well. 

I have been experimenting with MTU sizes with ifconfig, but have no feel
for whether or not this has any effect.  I *have* noticed that MTU gets
reset to 1500 by *something* some random time after I've changed it (note
this is without system reboots). 

Here's a sample of what we have:

yiffy:~# ifconfig
lo        Link encap Local Loopback  
          inet addr 127.0.0.1  Bcast 127.255.255.255  Mask 255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU 2000  Metric 0
          RX packets 0 errors 0 dropped 0 overrun 0
          TX packets 39754 errors 7 dropped 0 overrun 0

sl0       Link encap AMPR AX.25  HWaddr 
          inet addr 198.30.162.1  P-t-P 199.18.108.11  Mask 255.255.255.0
          UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING  MTU 1500  Metric 0
          RX packets 1583360 errors 0 dropped 0 overrun 0
          TX packets 1995660 errors 0 dropped 16514 overrun 0

eth0      Link encap 10Mbps Ethernet  HWaddr 00:20:AF:16:4C:3E
          inet addr 198.30.162.1  Bcast 198.30.162.255  Mask 255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING  MTU 1500  Metric 0
          RX packets 293959 errors 0 dropped 0 overrun 0
          TX packets 285447 errors 0 dropped 0 overrun 0

Note that a few moments prior to running this, I had set sl0 MTU to 2000, 
and confirmed that the value was accepted.  Now it is 1500 again without 
any action on my part.

One last observartion.  When we first started with kernel 0.99.15, telnet
sessions were locking up when large amounts of data was to be sent *out*. 
That is, if someone did a large directory listing or other function with
lots of output, their session would hang.  The send buffer information in
'netstat' showed several thousand characters waiting to be sent, and the
session would be effectively frozen.  This problem was acknoledged by
others at the time, but as in this case, no answers were provided.  The
problem went away when moving to the 1.0 kernel.  So *something* was done
bye *someone* for that one. 

I'm new to all this, and don't know all the avenues to pursue.  I'd 
appreciate any help in getting this problem hilighted and information 
flowing to the *someone* who understands how the net interfaces really 
work and who can really and *finally* *fix* it!  How do we proceed?

I have been running Linux on a 486/33 with a WD8003 and a Buslogic

the errors are intermitent.  The ide drive if fine.  Someone else

on the ethernet cards that will not work with scsi controllers.  
As an aside,  when I looked at the system map in the middle

know nothing about the system map and am not sure if this 
is a problem or not.  I have not tried to change anything on
