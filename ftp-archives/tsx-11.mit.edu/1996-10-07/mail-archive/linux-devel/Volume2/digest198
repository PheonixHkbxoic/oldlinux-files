I can confirm this. I tried it with the TransAmeritech CD, release April 1994.
The main problem is that it becomes real slow, compared to running it from HD.
This was on a NEC 3xi with an Adaptec 1542 SCSI adapter.
I think the big problem is when 2 processes try to access two different files
(=> physical locations) simultaneously on the CD-ROM. The head has to move a 
lot, so the seek-time slows down the data-xfer. (Am I right here?)
I think it's more reasonable to have the often used stuff on your HD, and the
less used stuff you can run from CD-ROM.

How do other people feel about running from CD-ROM? I do like the idea of 
saving HD-space, but it becomes too slow for me to be usable.

AKr

When you recompile your kernel, answer "yes" to the "Do you want to be
offered Alpha Drivers?" question. Then "yes" again to something about
other ISA cards. My Intel EtherExpress is working pretty well. It seems
to shut down when the traffic gets heavy. Such is life with ALPHA drivers..

Possibly, the last 512-byte block is the last of the partition and the next

512-byte block MSDOS file system; it'll fix that bug automagically, as well

Maybe the best way to do this is to just ignore the patchlevel if the minor
version number is even. There'd be still a 1.1.47 driver, but the 1.2
driver would work regardless of whether you have 1.2.0 or 1.2.34.

The reason for this is that it's not very easy to make sure that no
kernel data structure which the driver may need will change size.
In fact, it's a nightmare. The alternative, which is to provide access
functions, is stupid in the extreme should you want decent performance,
or simply no kernel bloat.

On the other hand, people with development kernels can be expected to
recompile their modules. But this isn't necessary for "stable" kernels,
as persumably their patches fix bugs instead of fiddling with data
structures.

Opinions?

Subject: Linux on multiple processors?
Date: 20 Sep 1994 13:38:02 GMT

I was wondering if this has been considered as a possible development
goal, now that the Intel multiprocessing hardware spec has been
standardized?

I know that MP (and specifically SMP) is sort of "trendy" these days
(vis. NT and OS/2 SMP), but the particular application for which I am
considering using Linux as a platform (dialin Internet host, web server,
fairly high volume) seems to me to be one for which SMP might give
good results--or at least make it easier to stave off the purchase of
a second machine.

So is this being considered, or at least batted around as a possibility?

Or has it already been hashed out and discarded?  I refuse to think that
it hasn't occured to anyone but me.

Mike.

Kelly, go read 97.113 again, especially the new rewrite of it!

There is NOTHING in Part 97 that says that data transfers have to be
"related" to amateur radio.  You are confusing one-way transmission limitations
with data transmissions.  Further, these limitations are only really
appropriatly discussed in terms of the U.S.  Other countries have other
limitations and allowances.

The only limitations U.S. hams have to worry about is obscene language
content, and whether a transmission would benefit them directly financially.

Not true. It hits memory (and can be read by root) and it may end up in 
the swap area for an indefinite time. Also beware with CFS of people using
the rpc.portmap bugs (redirected mount request) and just mounting your
unencrypted CFS freely.

CFS is a beginning. You need a lot more to have a secure system.

As far as I can tell they don't. If they do then you just release the

Not if its ELF. ELF libraries are position independant. You can do some 
faking and happen to avoid address clashing but one of the prices of ELF
is a slower system using PIC libraries.

Since it's not legal to operate a home-built rig outside the amateur

        Sure.  A modified version of tcpdump snarfs packets 
destined for the non-existent host.  It appends the destination
address to the packet using the IPOPT_RELAY option, and rewrites
the destination address as the SLIP-connected host.  The packet
is then sent back out on the network with a new destination, leaving
the source address unchanged (using raw sockets and a simple kernel
hack)  When the packet is received by the destination host, the 
IPOPT_RELAY option is detected, the destination address is re-written
to be the original destination
_and_sent_out_a_second_loopback_interface ifconfig'd to have the
proper destination address to "exist" on the network at work.

        Complex, I admit, but I'm not sure of any other way
to acomplish having my machine on the SLIP connection also appearing
on the network at work.

getting to my machine on the SLIP connection (and yes, IP forwarding
IS enabled).  The SLIP router will not (as far as I can tell) forward
any packets to the SLIP connected host that are not destined for it.
I have tried adding the "ghost" IP address to my system's arp cache
using 'arp -s IP_address HW_address', but when an arp request goes
out for the arped address, the Linux box does not reply.
Is this proper proxy-arp method?  I've seen alot of discussion of
what it does, but none on how to set it up. 

Any help would be appreciated. :)
