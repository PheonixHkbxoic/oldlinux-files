What I think (for what it's worth) would be useful would be
the ability to merge the CD-ROM's directory with the HD's and
the HD's files would take precedence.  That way if you want to
make a change or just want the speed of the HD you could copy
the file(s) to the HD in the same spot (directory and file name).
Just a vague thought...

I just had great fun getting ufc-crypt and Crack to compile on 
an Alpha. (Mind you, I did get a little help from Alec *8-])

I have to say it's worth it though, I now have a version of
crack that uses 64 bit integers and a ufc-crypt that can crypt
at about 4500 fcrypts/sec

Just to relate this to linux a little, cracking a passwd file on my
386dx25 Linux box took 5hrs 40mins to do the 1st (gecos) pass, whereas
it took 13mins 25secs to do the same pass on an Alpha running OSF/1 2.1.

Like Rob says, it only happens _once_ on a freshly booted kernel.
(umount with any of the filesystems seg faults). Thereafter, deleting
the mtab lock file, mount/umount seems to work just fine.

        There is a GNU pascal compiler called "gpc", use archie to find it
        though I think sunsite has it somewhere.  Works like a charm
        only it creates binarys as large as 40k just to writeln('hello');!

The features register is a write-only port, mapped to the same

[ oddly enough, nothing ]

<groan> I hate this system... argh.  Let's try this again... :)

Is there anyone out there working on a driver for the Hayes ESP serial
cards?  For those who don't know, the ESP card has 1024 byte send and
recieve buffers, uses DMA to do transfers, supports speeds to 900something
Kbps and does hardware handshaking.  Hayes also has provided a developer
kit "free" on CompuServe (which I downloaded but haven't gotten to looking
at..) on CompuServe. More specifically, I'm talking about Hayes ESP v2.0
cards.

I like the card very much and want to run it under Linux.  (When I finally
figure out how to get it to work with my hardware...)  The card is
very fast, and I'm guessing, very unsupported.  If such a driver doesn't
exist, or if someone isn't working on it, I might take up the project.
This is assuming:  1) I get Linux working on my machine  2) I'm not
overwhelmed when I look at the toolkit and Linux serial drivers (not
likely)  and finally 3) there's sufficient interest.

Anyone?

The 'Guide' UI-Builder is a commercial product from Sun, I doubt that
there is a Linux version at all.

This is US law.  A quick glance at the references field suggests that
European law is more likely to be relevant.  This is governed by EU
Directive 91/250 (Council Directive on the Legal Protection of
Computer Programs):

The clarity and grammar of the above leave something to be desired,
but essentially it is saying that it is permissible to reverse
engineer to achieve the interoperation of two programs.  Presumably
a Netware server and client satisfy this.

Software patents don't work in Europe.  If the GATT is ever
implemented (which I am inclined to doubt, even though it has been
signed), it appears that this will change.

Interestingly, Novell almost committed an offence under the Patents
Act 1977 (in the UK), because they claimed that their product was
protected by a patent when this was not so.  The patent they claimed
presumably existed, but only in the US.  I was just looking forward to
having them summoned before the Clerkenwell magistrate to explain why
they were making a false claim of patent rights, when I discovered
that the Act is badly phrased and allows you to claim patent
protection even when the patent in question is foreign and so of no
consequence.

Subject: still floppy problems with 1.1.51, details inside
Date: 20 Sep 1994 00:08:38 -0400

        Ok, folks I upgraded from 1.1.51 this afternoon hoping to see some
        improvement in the errors I have been getting with a 1.1.39 kernel
        I have been running. Kernel patching from the 1.1.45 source tree 
        to 51 went fine. I applied the util and bsd patches from the 940902 
        ibcs ALPHA release and compiled the result. Other than a lot of 
        complaints about a function declaration in include/ibcs/ibcs.h 
        everything was real clean. After booting I tried mounting one of the 
        1.743Mb ext2 floppies I use for archiving. It mounted fine and the 
        output from df (shown below) looked great. The form of mount command
        I used was "mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0H1743 /mnt/flop".

        Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
        /dev/hda1             321516  243030    61880     80%   /

        /dev/fd0                1683    1647       36     98%   /mnt/flop
 
        I then issued a "umount /mnt/flop" and got the following error output
        to the console:

        So I then used "df" to see what was going on with the mount table and
        got the following from that:

        Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on

        You may notice the similarity between the first and third line for the 
        above table! I looked through the zSystems file in /usr/src/linux/tools
        directory for the 1.1.51 source tree and got the following:

        I have arrowed the relevant area. In case it makes any difference I have a 
        Gateway-2000 P4D-100 (486DX/4-100 PCI) system with a 540Mb harddrive. The
        floppydrive is identified as a "FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077" at bootup. If 
        anyone needs any more info from me let me know. Sorry this got so long but
        I didn't want to leave out any details that might be needed. I will be 
        trying a 1.44Mb ext2 floppy later to see if the same thing occurs with that.
        As I remember I tried unmounting with "umount /dev/fd0H1743" and the same
        thing occurred but I will check to make sure and follow this posting up with 
        the results from those two tests.

I'm not a lawyer so don't take any of this to the bank. In the past I wrote 
some patent applications for a Patent Agent, who never tired of reminding 
me that software is not patentable, at least in the USA. The use of 
software to achieve a particular behavior by a machine is patentable. The 
code is not protected, only the way in which it is used. In other words, 
you can borrow all the patent covered code you want, you just have to make 
it work differently in a way that is not obvious. Or you can try proving 
that the patent should never have been issued.

And that's enough of this damned lawyer talk,

Hi Folks !

I installed a ProSonic16 Soundcard in my computer some days ago and
it works fine under DOS. It is set up for the appropiate IRQ/DMA/PORT by
a small device-driver. Under Linux it is only recognized after a DOS-Boot,
because of the DOS-device-driver that configures the card.
How can i setup the card from the Linux-Sounddriver ???
