Suprisingly enough, a number of drives do not seem to tolerate latencies
during data transfers.. once they start piping data to/from the CPU, they
expect it to continue uninterrupted for the full block.

This problem appears to exist mostly with drives with tiny on-board buffers,
like 64KB or 32KB or less.  With high density platters, there can be 64 or
more sectors per physical (internal) track on the drive, and not enough
buffer space to hold more than one track at a time.. seems to cause problems.

Brands known to include some models which fail include Maxtor, Quantum,
and Conner.  Using a lower multiple-sector count (like 2 or 4 instead of 32)
helps in some cases, but several drives won't tolerate -u1 *at all*.

In some cases, I have received reports of a particular drive model working,
and the next day received a report of the same model failing for someone else.

Too inconsistent to hardcode the models in hd.c as a preventative measure.

The problem also exists for some older MFM/RLL/ESDI drives.

If the critical sections are not accessed from interrupt code, there's no
need to lock access. Reason: Switching between processes happens when
somebody calls schedule(). Interrupts don't call schedule() and nobody
switches processes behind your back. QED.

There are no special Linux sources, it's just a question of configuring it.

The patch fixing the -D bug was posted to comp.mail.smail by the author,
some time last week. The fix for the 'create files anywhere' was posted
here; either HAVE=SETEUID in the config file, or check_path in the
appendfile transport.

Are there any plans to make PCI configuration space available for user level
code? This could e.g. be

  - some /dev/pciconf
  - something in /proc/pci
  - a new system call

Usercode (e.g. an X server) doing low level I/O on hardware (e.g. PCI
video adapters) might find this very useful.

I am new to Linux and am waiting for my CD to arrive, but I will ask this
question anyway.  Why is building shared libraries such an involved process?
In SunOS 4.1.3, building a shared library is trivial, assuming the library
that you wish to make shared does not export any global data.  You merely
invoke:

        ld -o libname $(OBJECTS) -assert pure-text -assert definitions

where $(OBJECTS) represents the object modules and libname is the library
name.  It is usually in the form <name.so.V.v>, i.e. libc.so.1.8.  There might
also be a corresponding <name.sa.V.v>, i.e. libc.sa.1.8.  I believe this "sa"
library ensures that each process that binds to the shared libary gets its
own copy of global data regions.  I'm not sure.  However, if your library
is pure text with no global data, it's easy.  You don't have to worry about
address assignments.

In SunOS 4.1.3, when you link to a shared library, to link to it in the
same manner as when you link to static/archived libraries.  When possible,
building and linking to a shared library should be this easy!

Suppose I wanted to take a binary compiled with gcc on Linux and 
convert that to a binary usable on a machine running Novell's
UnixWare.  Both are use 386 code, so it seems feasible that all
that is necessary is to relocate the code and change some header info.  
I think I need something like "objcopy", but which works and has
