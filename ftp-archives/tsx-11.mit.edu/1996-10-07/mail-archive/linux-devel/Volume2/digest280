Hi,

I have been looking around the FTP sites for information about any standards
for daemon accounts in /etc/passwd such as bin,sync,news,news,... and also for
naming of groups such as wheel,root,adm,sys,system,...

Has there been anything discussed with this.  I am quite an experienced linux
hacker and I am for installing linux from peices rather than from a 
distribution such as slackware, actually I have installed the basic slackware
set to get me a bootable machine and from here I have started to hack at 
things as we speak X11R6 is recompiling on it.

Any pointers or suggestions welcome, what entries do commercial versions have
like SunOS, Solaris, SCO,..., I have access to some other Unix systems.

Thanks in advance

Gareth

IMHO, that 3would be poor style at best... :)  I also miss the // comments and would
like to see them included in future versions of gcc.  They make -- amongt other things --

Are you certain you didn't have a hardware problem with the disk?
While I can't say for certain that I've never lost a file, the ext2 has had
an amazingly good record on my machine.

For seven months I ran ext2 on my home machine.  "No big deal" I can hear
you say, "I've run machines for months without losing a file as well."
While developing the ethercard drivers -- that's the kind of use where the
machine crashes a lot, and it usually crashes at a really bad time (like in
the middle of a file transfer).  "Urrrmmm" you say "I'm slightly impressed,
but 'fsck' should fix that baby right up".  Ahhh, but the point is I didn't
run 'fsck' on that disk for the whole seven months!  (It slowed the reboot
too much.)  Now that the 'clean' bit is implemented I do now run 'fsck' on
every reboot, although I rarely crash my machine any more.

In contrast I had to install SunOS on a new Sparc.  Recent Suns come with a
FFS already on the disk, with a setup program that tries to load the whole
OS from a CD-ROM or the network.  Well, someone had turned on the Sun,
probably to make certain that it wasn't broken during shipping, and then
switched it off.  That was enough to completely destroy the filesystem with
the fancy setup program, forcing me to do horrible low-level things that
were only described in the not-yet-readable CD-ROM AnswerBook.

   Has anyone succeeded in getting an Orchid Soundwave32 run under

I sort of have it running.
BTW, Analog Devices sells a development kit for programming the SW32
to do dsp processing (~$500).  You could use the card to, for example,
do robotic-type control, using the card's shared memory to send
commands from a linux process to the control program running
on the sw32.  Personnally, I'd love to set it up as a ray-trace
accelerator, but have my doubts about it being suitable for
anything but trivial matrix multiplications.  Note that the 
development toolkit runs under DOS, and you'd have to either write
your own DSP code loader under linux or do the DOS-boot-shuffle as
described below above to initialize your custom code.

   The docs claim the card to be compatible with, among others, 
   Soundblaster but they say that the compatibility is invoked by the 
   dos or windoze driver loading some code to the DSP of the soundcard
   which means bad luck for Linux I think :-(.

The trick is to first boot DOS, run SW32.EXE to load the dsp code into
the card's shared ram; Optionally run windows to run the mixer
program to adjust volume levels, exit windows; then do a WARM
(Ctrl-Alt-Del) reboot of the system and boot linux.  The card should
now be recognized and work like a Sound Blaster (not SB16).

Doing a cold reboot or power cycle will clear the sw32 dsp chip's
ram, preventing it from emulating a sound blaster.

Others on the net have reported using LOADLIN to make the DOS->Linux
transition.  I, for reasons too stupid to explain, have to do a floppy
shuffle from my dos boot disk to my Linux boot disk.  But I rarely
reboot, so can't complain too much.

I tried to get the SW32 recognized as a 16 bit MS Sound System compatible
card by the new voxware drivers (to play doom).  No luck. I can cat
to /dev/audio, but doom's sndserver says I don't have the voxware
drivers installed.

It has always amazed me how many people try to remove pieces of coding for
debugging purposes using "comment" constructs...
This may be required in other languages, but is not in C.  C compilers
traditionally have had the luxury of the pre-processor, so you can just
use:

#if 0
#endif

or:

#ifdef DEBUG
#endif

to exclude lines and blocks of code.  These nest well, and can even be made
easily controllable from the compile command line and/or from makefiles,
includefiles etc.

Just don't use comments for a purpose they weren't intended for.

Yes, that is the answer. Yet some people have gotten it to work, buy first
running DOS, loading the driver and then warm booting linux. Still in their
words the sound quality had been nothing to write home about.

One could filter SLIP or PPP links by attaching them via JNOS or WAMPES and
using IP ACCESS/TCP ACCESS.  A SLIP link between the kernel and *NOS would
then attach the "firewall-box" (akin to a DOS-box) to the native networking.

At least some of the commercial routers that have firewall capability are
basically dedicated KA9Q boxes, so the only difference would be that the
"router firewall" would not require separate hardware.

This is, of course, only one potential solution.

        I'm kind of curious why XFree86 decided to use an incompatible
major version number for shared libraries under Linux, requiring all
programs that were linked against X11R5 to be rebuilt.  We had an X11R6
beta release that used a downward compatible version version number for
its shared libraries and seemed to work fine with the R5 binaries that
we tried.  That release, including the jump files, was FTPable from
ftp.yggdrasil.com:pub/software_dist/X11R6-pl3.beta1/, and I know
that XFree86 was aware of the release.  Nevertheless, I'm glad
that XFree86 finally released 3.1.

Date: 8 Oct 94 00:27:01 GMT

Does anyone know why the Mach32 X server will not run with a virtual
resolution less than 1024?  As I only have 512K video memory I would
like to use a 640x480x8 video mode.  Examining the Mach32 X server
source code file mach32.c, I found:

if ((mach32VirtX) < 1024) {
    ErrorF("mach32 X server requires virtual screen width >= 1024\n");
    xf86DisableIOPorts(mach32InfoRec.scrnIndex);
    return(FALSE);
}

This explains why the X server exits with an error, but doesn't
explain WHY this 1024 limit is imposed.  Any ideas?

Immediately following this routine is the code to set the MEM_SIZE
value, and that code allows for a MEM_SIZE_512K value, so it should be
legal, right??

For further information, I've got ATI68800AX video on the motherboard.
Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

PLEASE don't abandon keyboard support in GUIs. Without it I would now be

Pointing devices are essential for some things and great for getting

The important thing is to make them consistent and optional. Equally the
pointing interface should be consistent and optional.
We ought to be looking for the best of both world *not* trying to ignore

:think support for this has to be specially compiled into each client.
:Maybe a drop-in replacement for some of the X shared libraries could
:allow existing binaries to support this, though?

:2) A better X file manager than what's currently out there (xfm &
:xfilemanager are nice but not as easy to configure, easy to use, or
:generally polished as one might like).  Maybe something that provided

more and more resources....

:essentially the same functionality as Mouseless Commander (the
:text-based Norton Commander clone), but with a mouse-driven GUI? (&
:provisions for icons if desired, scrollbars on the dual file selection
:lists, real pulldown menus-- leave in the command line at the bottom,
:though!).

:3) Another idea from HP-VUE... this environment features a "console
:bar" area at the bottom of the screen, containing buttons to switch
:virtual desktops, invocation icons for commonly-used apps, small icons

I've been toying with somthing quite similar using fvwm and xfm...the
functionality is quite similar if you don't mind using fvwm's virtual
desktops.

:for system functions (logging out...), and space for a clock,
:calendar, Xload bargraph, & other stuff.  The appearance of the bar is
:very professional, with little beveled insets for each item.  I'm

more and more resources....

My company is probably going to pay for a residential ISDN
installation at home, and I would be a fool to not look into this.  I
have a PC at home, running the usual DOS/Windows crap, and also
running Linux (yay!).  DigiBoard has announced a product called
DataFire (maybe DigiFire, I always get confoozed here) which runs
2B+D, has an ODI interface, PPP support.  Their slick says they
support Windows for Workgroups 3.1.1, but makes no mention of Windows
3.1.

I have also found that psi.com has an ISDN dialup Internet service,
running both with their software under Windows (great for the kids)
and under PPP (but not "certified" to work with Linux, only SUN,
HP-UX, a couple like that).  This service costs $29 a month for 29
hours connect time.  Hey! this caught my attention.

On a side note, as much as I personally hate Windows, it is a lot
easier for the kids, and I don't object at all to having a Windows
Internet interface for them.  Especially since there are many Windows
programs they use for school essays and such, I don't see any need to
force them to use Linux.  But I personally want Linux, if for no other
reason thn that I can work at home once in a while.

So here are my questions:

1.  What can people tell me in general about home ISDN, that I
probably haven't already found out from PacBell?

2.  WHat does this ODI interface mean to me and Linux?  Is this a
standard hardware interface, for which Linux drivers already exist?
Or are there easily modifiable drivers?

3.  What the heck is WIndows for Workgroups 3.1.1, and would those
drivers probably work with Windows 3.1?

4.  What the heck, let me ask again for any general information.  You
probably can not send me too much basic information; I can always toss
it.

My friend is psoting this for me; I haven't got news access, so please
REPLY rather than FOLLOWUP.  I will of course accumulate replies and
send him a summary to post.

You're right!  I got IOCTRL error with fdformat also.
