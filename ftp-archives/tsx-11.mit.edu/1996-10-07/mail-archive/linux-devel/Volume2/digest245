Hi,

Here is an entry from the LSM at sunsite :

Title:         Checkpoint Restart support for Linux
Version:       0.01
Description:   Allows the state of a running process to be captured and adds 
               kernel support to treat this saved state as a new executable 
               format and restart the process from it. Only simple processes 
               work in this version.

===================================

I don't know if its really worth the effort to have the kind of support for
checkpointing that you are talking about i.e. to have the raytrace startup
again, TCP connections re-establish themselves etc. At least, kernel support
for them seems to be getting beyond the job of a kernel. Some of them are best
left to the application. But, some milder form of checkpointing may be good.

Regards,

Dinesh

Hi,

I have been reading a while this newsgroup watching out for people
having floppy formating problems too. Doesn't seem so but maybe you
nevertheless can help:

Since kernel 1.1.45 (I now use 1.1.51 if I don't need to format
floppies, otherwise I use 1.1.38 :-) ) I cannot format floppy
disks. 3.5" ones, internal drive. No problem under DOS, but under
Linux using fdformat or fdformat2 (taken from sunsite) formating
always goes okay but when verifying the drive does not go beyond track
0 and fdformat exits after a while with the message: `Non-removable
media not supported'. Well, I assure you, I CAN remove the floppy
:-). Any ideas what it could be?

While ya'll are at it, shared scsi hard drives and/or CDROMs might be
intersting as well ... even if restrictions to one host r/w others r/o.
Source trees, netnets, etc. would be obvious candidates.

Also, when the discussion finishes offline, do post your results/plans.

If Solaris takes the 4.4 BSD route it has a linked list of addresses for
each address family. This worries me for performance reasons. Linux can
happily do what you want with the dummy inteface (and you can add more
dummy interfaces 8)).

This is because you already have a file named /etc/passwd.
Try it with a file that doesn't already exist (eg. /this.is.a.test).
It really works :-(

If you mean ethernet adaptors that have 10baseF interfaces, Allied Telesis
has 10baseF versions of their AT1500 (79C960 LANCE) and AT1700 (Fujitsu

There are no supported FDDI/CDDI, or ATM network cards at this time.

btway ... I am aware of a case where a special purpose computer had a spare
scsi adapter which was used to connect to a 'normal' DOS PC.  It is in
regular use.  The objective was to improve on 9.6kbs data transfers.
To avoid bus length problems, the guy who did it slowed the data rate way
down (don't know how) and uses 50kbyte/sec.  Just to confirm that 
computer adapter to adapter is possible.

I have been playing around a little with the Linux console and am curious how 
or if it can be switched into an 8 bit character mode and how to get it to 
support color ANSI sequences (similar to 'ansipc' emulation present in 
Coherent's console driver).  I can use DEC SI/SO to switch in/out DEC 
graphics character sets, and it seems to perform correctly as a vt100 
console, but I am looking for ANSI color support.  Is there an escape sequence 
which controls the console's mode of operation?

I have looked a little at the source for console, but I have not been able to 
devine a mechanism to accomplish this from it yet.

Well, the first symptom was that LILO wouldn't come up.  I though "Hmmm,
thats odd." and then just booted it with a floppy.

Then the crashes began, and it would run e2fsck each time, getting worse and
worse, turned out the partitions were overlapping between the 1 gig news
partition and the 20 meg swap partition, so as soon as the news partition
got full, it began writing into the swap space.

Not good.

Actually, I just copied it off to another drive, turned on the extended
translation, re-partitioned and re-formatted the drive.  It works fine now,
but I suppose I could have just changed that in the source.

It would be nice if that were a little better documented somewhere.

Dan.

The NCR WaveLAN cards give a maximum throughput of 2 Mbits/sec.
The cards come in ISA, EISA, Micro Channel, PCMCIA and parallel
port(?) flavours.
In the USA they signal (using spread spectrum encoding) at 915 MHz.
Indoors, using just the omni-directional antennas that accompany
each unit, they can be used to connect devices within a large,
open-plan office.  Outdoors, using (extra cost) directional antennas,
they are able to support point-to-point links, apparently up to 8 km.
I understand that DEC, Solectec and Digital Ocean also sell rebadged
versions of the same hardware.

Cheers,
bruce.

There are some ugly implications of this, and it isn't possible with some 
intelligent boards which have hidden enough of the underlying details from
the programmer and don't support a target mode, but otherwise it is 
possible.

This is the first problem you're going to run into -

    You need some mechanism for telling SCSI boards what their 
    addresses are.

    Furthurmore, you need a mechanism to limit the devices detected
    on power up/boot if you want to avoid conflicts.

>2. The Linux SCSI driver would have to be hacked to accept async command 
>message from the bus (just like an HD does.. 

You're probably going to want to implement the SCSI Processor 
device model, since this is the only model the firmware on some
intelligent boards can support in target mode.

The simplest method is to choose a sender-driven model,
where the sender connects to a device and sends a 
SEND command to it.

Alternateively, you could have it receiver driven, where the
receivers execute a RECEIVE command on each sender, which in 
turn disconnects, and reconnects when data is available, although
this is more complicated.

None of the Linux SCSI drivers have any notion of support for target mode.

Not necessarily - most of the dumb boards will interrupt when a 
SCSI selection or reselection occurs.  Given a typical interrupt
latency of about 60us, amortized over a large MTU (say 64K), this
isn't too bad.

Selection/reselection generally trigger interrupts.

I've thought about it some, and it's _definately_ possible.  In fact,
it appears to be a nice way to do distributed communications.

Nope.   Differential busses are limited to 25 meters total versus 
six for single ended.  16 bit WIDE busses allow for 16 devices.

Not really - 

1.  Cabling with 25 pair shielded cable is _not_ cheap.

2.  100 base T is a 100Mbit/sec technology which can be wired with
    4 pair cables.

However, it would be a reasonable way to connect a few boxes on a 
desktop to get a poor-man's distributed computing system.

Subject: How to get more kernel memory for kmalloc?
Date: 30 Sep 1994 02:16:31 GMT

To continue with my Telnet troubles (it stops transmission), I am almost
sure that it is happening because of (ultimately) a failed kmalloc.  Telnet
tries a send, and gets a EWILLBLOCK/EAGAIN.  There are only two places this
error happens in tcp.c in two places (in tcp_write), once when waiting for
a previously open connection to close, and when a socket buffer malloc fails.

I can understand with the various protocols, drivers, devices, etc. how I can
be running out from a default config, but:

HOW DO I INCREASE THE KMALLOCABLE MEMORY?

Subject: [DOSEMU] Running dosemu disables serial port!!
Date: Fri, 30 Sep 1994 13:28:26 GMT

I'm running DOSEMU 0.52, and it's GREAT, except that when DOSEMU is
active on the console, nothing else can use the serial port!  If I
have kermit or rz/sz running on the serial port, communication simply
stops.  If I don't --- even worse --- mgetty goes crazy.  Incoming
FAX's and logins are not processed.

I've already taken all the serial lines out of dosemu.conf.  Is this a
known problem?  Has it been fixed in any of the pre_53 releases?  Is
there a workaround?

Thanks.

Subject: What GUI to write for?
Date: 30 Sep 1994 11:58:29 -0400

I want to write a X application or two.  At first they would be for 
personal use, but eventually I might make them availble for the 
public to use.

I am not sure which GUI/toolkit to use.  It would be nice to keep it
portable to use under various UIs.  Do I have to use Xlib? or can I
write them using XView?

I would appreciate any guidence I could recieve.  Thanks for any and
all help.
