I would guess that your processor has some sort of cache, either internal
or external. If the inner loops of the benchmark fit entirely within cache,
and you are not running heavy traffic on the ISA bus for network cards,
CD ROM interface, graphics, etc. than the only major traffic on the ISA
or VLB bus will be the SCSI hard disk. Even an ISA Buslogic can pump 10
megabytes/sec over an unloaded ISA bus, and that's the fastest transfer
possible for your SCSI drive. Now, if you run some software that puts a 
heavy load on the bus, you'll see ISA transfer drop off much worse than
VLB.

This has been going on for several pathc levels.  I had the problem
back when the patch level was about 1.1.40 or so.  every now and then,
I try to build the whole kernel with 2.6.0 and it breaks on aha152x.c.
I switch my gcc symbolic link to 2.5.8, delete the .o file and finish
the build.  So, I am running 1.52 compiled mostly on 2.6.0 with a few
modules 2.5.8.  It has been working fine for me.   I could not see
anything obvious in aha152x.c that should be causing the problem.

Hi,
Is there any way to display 8-bit ASCII on the Linux console?
This is important for communications (BBSes sending 8-bit character codes).
How can this be done? When I call PC-based BBSes from Linux, I just get rubbish
for >127 characters.

From the manual page of minicom, it seems that it can display 8-bit ASCII
(i.e., the standard PC character set.), but when trying this I get wrong
characters.

Thanks,

What are you talking about? Just call up adaptec and ask for

Note that strlen() returns size_t which is always unsigned, so that

The same here. I apply the patch with patch -p0 BTW.
The solution was to edit the file and remove all the end, because it
was duplicated (don't ask me why -:)
Then no problem to compile and also to execute.

Subject: ftape FS?
Date: Sat, 15 Oct 1994 01:57:05 GMT

Now that I have a tape drive up and running, I was wondering if it
would be possible to put some kind of FS on it.  The idea would be to
use the tape as an archive.  I have lots of large files that I almost
never use, and so which I don't keep on my HD.  It would be very
convenient if I could access them by putting in the right tape.

Looking at the problem in all its generality, the idea would be to
implement a FS on a serial device.  I suppose "tar" is sort of like
that, but tar would be exceptionally ineffecient, because it has no
centralized directory information.   One thought that comes to mind is
a read-only FS, which would have directory information scattered
throughout the tape, so as to reduce unnecessary seeking.  A special
program would then be used to create the FS.

At any rate, this would allow, for example, one to put source code or
seldom-used libraries on tape, but still use them for a compile (sure,
it would take a LONG time, but it could be done.)  I think the entire
source tree for my current Linux installation would fit on one tape.
If it were made into an FS, I could always type "make xxx" to recreate
whatever I wanted.  Not speedy, but immensely useful.

To make better use of this, one would want a way of telling the kernel
to try to keep this particular information in the cache.  It would be
drop a page from the tape drive that's 5 minutes' seek time away just
to avoid using a few bytes of swap space, for example.

Comments?

The Adaptec 274x 284x and 294x cards are essentially the same cards..  
Being the EISA, VLB, and PCI versions respectively.  Except for the 
different buses these cards work identically.  A driver is already written
that supports the 274x and 284x..   It does not support the 294x simply
because the PCI version just hasn't been implemented yet.  Try contacting
the author of the driver...   His driver can be ftp'ed from

I'm sure his e-mail address is somewhere in the readme file..

Here I must disagree, in part.  True, the UNIX *kernel* doesn't care
what's in the file, but just about every application program does (as
opposed to utility program).

There are utilities already that make several files look like one to the
OS.  Tar, for example, or ar, or cpio.  These utilities distinguish
their dtaa files by magic numbers.  Likewise, many other programs
distinguish data one the basis of filename extensions (like make, gcc,
etc.)

I would not like to see the namespace for files change, but it would be
real nice to move the magic numbers for files into the inode.  It would
enourmously clean up application code written to take advantage of it,
and wouldn't break anything (although potentially cpio, tar, ar, and cp
could change to take advantage of keeping the magic number attributes
with the files).  The entire feature (other than the FS changes) can be
built in a user library.  For instance:

        int     fd = openObject("myDataFile");

could call open(), fstat(), look at the "magic number" field, and
perform the correct action based on what the file was typed as.  That's
my "modest proposal".
