Did you put a T-connector with 2 terminators on the ethernet connector?
If not, you will get this error as soon as you try to send something.

Ethernet cards must always be connected to a network, and this setup
is the minimal network (only one node, and the two terminators that should
always be at the ends of the network cable)

(of course this assumes you use thinwire)

Yes, there is indeed such a mysterious way.  The key is to pass the
options -lang-c++ -U__cplusplus to cpp.  -lang-c++ enables
//-comments, C++ include directories, and the __cplusplus symbol.
-nostcinc++ is supposed to turn off C++ include directories, however,
it did not do any difference for me.  Fortunately, it doesn't matter
(at least on my system, there are no C++ include files which conflict
with any C include files).

In the file /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.5.8/specs (or equivalent,
depending on your GCC version), find the line saying:

*cpp:

Append to the line immediately following it:

%{!ansi:-lang-c++ %{c:-U__cplusplus}}

On my system, it looks like this after editing:

*cpp:
%{!m386:-D__i486__} %{posix:-D_POSIX_SOURCE} %{!ansi:-lang-c++ ${c:-U__cplusplus}}

Note that this will permit -ansi to turn off C++-style comments.

I could not find any docs on the specs file, so I deduced this mostly
by trial and error.  I attempted to fetch the GCC source and look at
it, but the network here is just too slow right now, for some reason.
It seems to work on my system, though, for the couple of test cases I
ran.

        /hpa

P.S: Thanks, Dave, for Linux and SGI DOOM!!  I got the registered
version for my Linux box, and now my productivity has gone flatline!

Subject: Sleeping harddisk - POSSIBLE SOLUTION?????
Date: 23 Sep 1994 10:53:59 GMT

Hello,
I've started messing around with power management on my laptop.
(more fool I).
One of the irritiating features of Linux is that whenever the disk
spins down to save power, it spins up again.
The reason seems to be that the driver sends an interrupt, which the
kernel does not expect, causing a printk(), which of course spins up
the disk.

Now, I messed around with the hd.c file, and came up with the following
patch (against 1.1.51's linux/drivers/block/hd.c):

diff -u -r1.1 hd.c
--- 1.1 1994/09/23 07:43:15
+++ hd.c        1994/09/23 08:33:59
@@ -415,11 +415,16 @@
  * Ok, don't know what to do with the unexpected interrupts: on some machines
  * doing a reset and a retry seems to result in an eternal loop. Right now I
  * ignore it, and just set the timeout.
+
+ * Interrupts also seem to be generated on disk spindown; try to log it
  */
 void unexpected_hd_interrupt(void)
 {
+       unsigned char status = inb_p(HD_STATUS);
+       unsigned char error = inb_p(HD_ERROR);
        sti();
-       printk(KERN_DEBUG "Unexpected HD interrupt\n");
+       printk(KERN_DEBUG "Unexpected HD interrupt, status=0x%x, error=0x%x\n",
+              status, error);
        SET_TIMER;
 }

This resulted in the following output:

Sep 23 10:52:06 dale kernel: Unexpected HD interrupt, status=0x80, error=0x80
Sep 23 10:54:14 dale kernel: Unexpected HD interrupt, status=0x80, error=0x80
Sep 23 11:13:42 dale kernel: Unexpected HD interrupt, status=0x80, error=0x80
Sep 23 11:14:09 dale kernel: Unexpected HD interrupt, status=0x80, error=0x80
Sep 23 11:15:41 dale kernel: Unexpected HD interrupt, status=0x80, error=0x80

Now, according to linux/hdreg.h, this means "BUSY_STAT" and "BBD_ERR",
which should mean that the controller is busy reading a bad block, but
there is no error (ERR_STAT is off), according to my naive reading.

What I would like to see is:

- That some other people with laptops do this patch, and see if the status
  values are the same. (It "ought to be safe", I think)

- That the people who *know* this driver tell me if these values ever make
  sense (a program to monitor these values would be nice, too....)

The next step is of course to test for these values in the interrupt routine,
and simply not log the message.

Next problem is that everything hangs during spinup....but once we know that
the disk is spun down, we can take special precautions in the blockwrite....

You have the source, so go ahead and change gcc (actually, only cpp
has to be changed).  But don't complain if you want to compile a
language with gcc that isn't C.

The problem is with the Fig-color file in the apps-default directory.
The Fig-color file includes the Fig file, which is actually a link tot
he Fig-color file, which opens the Fig file,.... you get the idea.

To fix this, change the include in Fig-color to inckude Fig-standard.

Why is it getting called with filp == NULL?
That could mean something is wrong.
Also, maybe it would be a better idea to do the fsync_dev in that case, 
since you can't tell if it is needed and it is safer to call it 
(even if it may not be necessary) than to not call it (in case it 
is necessary). One wants to be sure the device is completely fsync'd 
before the close returns, so that one can be sure that the floppy can 
be safely removed wihout losing data in the buffers.

Subject: p5 code optimization for gcc
Date: 23 Sep 1994 13:06:28 -0400

Hi all:
   A faithful Linux user here. Recently, I got a Pentium machine, of course the
thing is dedicated to Linux. Yesterday, I am upgrading the gcc 2.5.6 to
intel optimized version of gcc 2.5.8. I use that to recompile the kernel, 
the system is running faster before (although I didn't run any benchmark, and
I don't know any benchmark in Linux, but you definitely can feel it). To all
who are using the P5 CPU, try to replace the old one with pentium code, it's
better. BTW, my system configuration:

Motherboard: SUper micro
Chipset    : Opti  (they said you sould go for Intel Neptune now)
RAM        : 16 Mb
Monitor    : 17" Panasyc
Graph card : 1M DRAM Mach32 PCI version
Harddisk   : 420 western digital (with cheap DTC PCI hardisk controler)
Linux      : Info magic Sept

I am also willing to discuss with those who is playing around Linux using P5
machine.

True... but I think he was talking about the destination address, not the
interface address... you can route either the loopback _net_, or the
loopback _host_, with equal facility.

Who says it is?  I get well over 1.5mb/sec on my WD Caviar's.  The average
throughput is over 1mb/sec.  I'd have to spend a lot more money to get 
SCSI to do that well.

Now, if you are talking about multiple drive access, fine.  But even that
may not be true for long with the new IDE interface which is not only
faster but also is supposed to allow multiple drive access just like 
SCSI.
