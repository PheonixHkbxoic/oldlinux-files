Get the iBCS2 emulator from sunsite (slackware-source/extra-stuff/iBCS2...

compile, insmod, ready; Get Demos (WP51, Xess3 for Sco are working fine);
Also running is Mosaic, Xarchie and a lot of other Sco programs.

another option is to simply include the TCP/IP frametype 
(ethernet_II) in your net.cfg for the link drivers on your workstations 
(novell that is) and bind IP to your lan card on your novell server like:
   load mycard.lan port=xx slot=xx frame=ethernet_ii
   bind ip to mycard addr=x.x.x.x
and your server is now a router for the ip stuffs

If you are serious about this kind of project, consider InterBase from
Borland.  It has some things in it that make it able to handle what
netnews needs a lot better than other systems.  In particular, other
systems do an exclusive lock on the database for each transaction.
InterBase lets you flag a transaction as, "I'm just browsing" and as
doesn't lock things.  So, when you are writing a banking application
you turn that off.  When you are writing something that lets a manager
run a zillion little reports to try to find or visualize the data, you
set that flag.  You get much better performance.

Netnews reading fits that model well.

Subject: 'Timer expired' error with ftape
Date: 13 Sep 1994 19:34:34 GMT

Hi All,

I am having problems using the ftape driver with a Colorado DJ20 drive
which may point to a bug in the driver.  When dumping a file
to tape with the following command:

>> dd if=everything.zip of=/dev/ftape bs=10k

I will after a while get the following error message:


dd: /dev/ftape: Timer expired
435+0 records in
434+0 records out

(Note: everything.zip is 60MB large)

This error consistenly occurs on several machines 
(386/40, 486/66) with kernels 1.1.[345]x  and ftape version 1.13b. 
It also stops 'tar' and 'cpio' dead in their tracks. 
The error log shows that the timeout occurs in function 'ftape_ready_wait'
following a call to 'setup_segment'.

Curiously, this error seems to happen only with tapes formatted using
the Colorado software for DOS which came with the DJ20 drive. I have one 
preformatted tape which seems to work o.k.  Does anyone out there have
a similar problem? Is it caused by bad tapes or by a bug in the driver?
Can it be fixed??


Cheerio,
   Ulf

Don't confuse the disk <-> controller speed with the controller <->
memory/cpu speed.

I believe that IDE is *1* bit at a time between the controller and
disk.

SCSI is 8 bits at a time.

IDE is 16 bits at a time between the controller and memory/cpu.

SCSI depends on the controller (my controller transfers 32 bits at a
time between the controller and memory).

That's on machines where MFCF had full source to BSD 4.x and SunOS 3.x
(maybe 4.x also?) and changed *everything* to understand the larger
size.  This was quite a while ago.

I believe that very few machines at UofW are running those operating
systems anymore, so most of them are stuck at 8 characters now (since
around 1989-1991 probably).

Yes, Linux DLL libraries have to be self-contained.  However, there is
nothing to prevent you from combining two or more mutually dependent
libraries into a single image.  Libc has been done this way for a long
time and I believe libgr is also a combination library.

good idea. 

Due to syncing and swapping this feature will be most useful for a
seldomly used disk which is perhaps auto-(un)-mounted. I have such a
beast which makes quite annoying noise, so mainly for that reason I
would appreciate a "power save" feature :-).

As far as I know a disk in sleep (or whatever you call it) mode starts
up automatically if you use it (perhaps we need a longer time out for
this case).

I don't understand.  Cut-and-paste under X is provided by XTerm,
not by the editor running in the XTerm.  Any editor can be used
and you will get cut-and-paste.  I use it all the time under Unix.

BTW, a neat trick is to add a paste button to xterm:

*VT100.translations: #override\
        <Key>Insert: insert-selection(PRIMARY,CUT_BUFFER0)\n

(to .Xdefaults)
