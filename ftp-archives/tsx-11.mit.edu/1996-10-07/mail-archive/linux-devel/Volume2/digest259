I'd be interested in any documentation for the EXT2 based file system
of linux.  FFS papers are easy to find.

It would seem that with increasingly intelligent scsi drives, and
increasingly large on disk caches.  (1MB aren't uncommon) that
it isn't as necessary to know the hardware details of a drive
because they are hidden from you by onboard cache policies, variable
recording rates etc.

Back when drives has no cache using the geometry of a drive was a big
speed win, but I suspect it's less so today.

 I have what might be a dumb question, about SVGAlib and video modes. I don't
know diddly about programming graphics drivers, but here goes.
  With most DOS applications, namely graphics viewers, instead of specifying
the drive specific to my card, I simply use the VESA driver, and voila, all my
cardsmodes are recognized. Would this be possible for SVGAlib? I have overheard
bits of conversation among Linux developers about avoiding making BIOS calls (
I guess to ensure portability to other processors). Is the case the same here?

This is not entirely correct. Removable media, such as floppies, are
also changeable. Any such scheme should support multiple volumes. That
is, look in /floppies/foo to get your disk "foo", /floppies/bar to get
"bar". Ideally a reference to a disk not presently available should
cause a message on the system console asking for the disk to be
inserted.

Thus you could, for instance, cp /floppies/foo/* /floppies/bar and
expect it to work if you have only one floppy drive.

There exists a "Kernel Hackers Guide" that you should be able to find
in the documentation tree of major Linux sites.  (filename is khg*, I think)

Devices that are memory mapped include the video card, and the WD80x3
ethernet cards.  You can look at the drivers for those.

The problem is that the DOS partition has an odd number of sectors.
Linus calls it ``the old "not a whole buffer" problem''. In the days
of 0.99.15f, I developed the following patch. Anyone can do better than
that?

Yes, Motif is very ugly IMHO and I don't think Athena is overpriced at all :)
For me xview hits the spot. Code freely available, and its API is not too bad
and GUI is aesthetically pleasing in my eyes. Good example being workman.

There is an ALPHA driver available. I've been using the 1.1.49
kernel patch for the past few weeks, and it works great!

You can ftp the latest patch from aix13ps2.cc.kuleuven.ac.be (I
forget the exact directory).

NOTE: For ISA cards, make sure the shared RAM of your adapter (not 
----  the ROM address which you can set with the dipswitches!) is 
      located at 0xd0000, as this is hard-coded in the 
      linux-1.1.49-TR.diff.gz patch. Alternatively, you can edit 
      linux/drivers/net/ibmtr.c and change the two lines of hardcode 
      (from memory, look for 0xd0 & 0xd0000). I changed these to 
      0xd8 & 0xd8000 to suit my adapter...

Good luck...

Subject: Which kernel suports two ethernet cards ?
Date: Sat, 1 Oct 1994 10:49:15 GMT

 We have a Linux box as a file server (pcnfs server).
 At the time we are writing this message we want to connect it to
 other network so we need to install a second ethernet card.

 We have the following cards:
    WD 8013
    WD 8003 / NE1000 / NE2000

 Can anybody tell us the kernel we need ? ( we have read that some kernels do
 not suport more than one card )

 Thanks in anticipation.
