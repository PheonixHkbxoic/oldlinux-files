Subject: Quantum IDE problem w/1.1.51
Date: 22 Sep 1994 21:38:11 GMT

I have been running on one of the 1.0.? versions of Linux for 
some time and decided to try one of the more recient kernels, so 
I compiled 1.1.51 and everything went fairly normal.  However 
when I booted, I got some errors and the kernel was unable to 
find the root partition.  I seem to remember seing something
having to do with Quantum IDE drives several weeks ago, but I
didn't pay much atention to it then.  Any help would be 
appreciated.

Here are the errors I got:

I don't know about your other problem, but this one is easy.  You

Maybe you should set the path to the library files using the -L option:

It's usually called /dev/mcd, AFAIK. Also, with the more recent kernels, you
need to mount it read only. This can be done by changing the entry in
/etc/fstab in the fourth column from "defaults" to "ro".

I understand that it will be incorporated into the 1.3.0 kernel

On that note, when is 1.1.5? going to become 1.2.0? I saw a post from
Linus a while ago that 1.1.49 would become 1.2.0, or he was going to
release 1.1.50 and then it'd go to 1.2.0. Has that changed? Why are we
up to 1.1.51 now? I'm so confused ...

There's an ad for it in the latest Linux Journal. You can get the
source code from sunsite.unc.edu in pub/Linux/kernel/patches, I
think. If that's not right, get the ls-lR in pub/Linux and search it
for cyclades. The code is there, and I think it will work up to
1.1.12. The developer's name is also in the .lsm, if you have more

Actualkly yygdrasil PnP does this, though with a ltitle more complex

that if you have the CD mounted its slow but accesible...

yup. gpc, at sunsite or ftp.cdrom or another mirror of slackware.
can't remember exactly which directory in the hierarchy, but it's
part of the slackware contrib section. it's also part of debian,
but don't know where debian is, kind of.

mount /dev/fd0 /mnt

umount /dev/fd0

If you're referring to SCSI drives, they're accessed as a linear
set of blocks, and don't suffer from the WD1003 register compatable
interface problems. 

Depending on weather I left any sign problems in the SCSI disk 
driver and what the rest of the block device code looks like,
this means you can run one or two terrabyte devices without 
problems (32 bit block numbers, 512 byte blocks).

As far as partitioning, 255 heads * 63 sectors * 1024 cylinders 
is a tad short of 8G, so you can have 8G drives that are 100% compatable
with DOS and Linux.

As to Linux using the IBM style partition tables, this is only partially
true.  We ignore the H/C/S fields, and only use the 32 bit starting 
sector and length fields, letting us support terrabyte partitions.

FYI, people have successfully used the 9G Seagates with a single 
ext2 filesystem on them.

32 bit file pointers make things messy when you're accessing the 
raw device, ie when you create the filesystem, but have no effect
on maximum size of the filesystem.

Many vendors support 64 bit file lengths, and even more support 
64 bit filesystems with 32 bit file lengths, since this is easier
to implement and avoids nasties with the 'C' library.

I was wondering howto improve the transfert speed to/from my tape backup.
I need to backup the server and a notebook.

I consider buying one of the adapter card from colorado.

Is it worthed and supported under linux? (I know somes are)
Do Linux support hardware compression?

Here is my system configuration:
486DX50 EISA w/20MB RAM
Adaptec 1742A
Quantum 525LPS HDD
NEC CDR84J cdrom
ATIXL w/mouse w/o monitor! (long story...)
Colorado jumbo250MB (of course!)

Talking about 'no monitor', is there somebody working on a 'something' 
that would permit me (or anybody) to read tapes mades with TAPE.EXE or 
CBWLITE.EXE with and without compression.

I need something that would be available thru the lan.

I was thinking also at the dosemu and wine but none of them seem to allow 
me to access my tape drive.

any suggestion accepted.

A collegue of mine is still struggling with the MO disk for her SGI

It works fine for me (386, Adaptec 1540B).
But this doesn't mean that there are no problems... 
(It seems that there are no changes in patch 51 regarding SCSI and

Most probably it assumes disksets written to tape as subsequent "tape files",
not in some proprietary format used by a DOS backup program...
So, if you want to create the tape from DOS you will need a very specific
program to do it.  (kind of like the RAWRITE.EXE you need to make a
bootable floppy from a disk image)

This technique has worked well with a Dutch distribution of Linux (called
"Snow") which I have installed from tape a few times in the past.  But today,
it is exclusively distributed on CD-ROM.

There exists a "dynamic loading" library package, I think it is called "dload".
Is this what you require?

I think /usr/local has been traditionally used to store things that were
added to an existing system locally.  E.g. you bought a 'complete' system
from your favorite manufacturer or OS distributer, but it still lacked
emacs.  Then you added emacs yourself in /usr/local.

However, with Linux all these things come with the system (or none of them
does, depending on your point of view w.r.t. the name "Linux"), and you
just put them directly under /usr where everything is.

As you already explained, the location can usually be configured in some
Makefile, so it really isn't an important point anyway.

Of course, CD-ROM was developed as a sequential-access medium, and CLV
is just the most optimal/practical method of reading the data in that
environment.
When you actually want to run it as a random-access medium, it should
be possible to keep the angular velocity at a constant value, and vary
the datarate according to the position on the medium.  This may require
some complicated frequency- and filtering switching, but it should be
possible.

Probably we will see high-performance drives that keep the angular
velocity constant...  or maybe this is already done in the newest drives.

However, this is not the only reason why long seeks are slower: the
positioning mechanism on a CD drive is two-level.  There is mechanically
moving arm which does the coarse positioning, and a fast voice-coil controlled
mirror that does the tracking and fine positioning.  This also counts
in the access times.

I didn't know about the -lang-c-c++-comments option; it wasn't in the
man page.  As far as passing arguments to the various compiler passes,
-Wa will pass it to the assembler pass, -Wl to the linker pass, and
Jim Wilson just sent me the patch to support -Wp which passes it to
the preprocessor.
