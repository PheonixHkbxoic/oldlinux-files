there are people out there who think ANSI C, the 1990 version, is the
Word of God[TM], but all I did was mention that:

a) A number of C compilers support it as an extension,
b) It has been proposed for inclusion in a future version of the ANSI
   C standard,
c) There have yet surfaced a *non-artificial* example of code that it
   would break (which would, if such code existed, make (b) a Bad

: knowing exactly how your link is set up)

I don't know the original question, as the article has not reached here
yet.  In regards to the shared IRQ's, this is the dos standard, but does
cause rather large problems if you try to extract any reasonable pace 
from two serial ports on the same IRQ.

The easiest (believe me, it is the simplest modification I've ever done
to hardware) thing to do is re-wire the serial boards - usually this
requires the addition of one wire and the removal of one jumper
connector, sometimes you also have to cut a track.

After doing this, you have to modify the kernel to use AUTO_IRQ,
CONFIG_AUTO_IRQ or change the flags on the first four com ports,
depending on kernel version.

Reply-To: a.vignani@CRFV3.CRF.IT

Hi all.
This is my new trouble with Linux:

My setup: Slackware 1.1.2, kernel 1.1.53
I created a private directory (perm=0700) on a DECstation and mounted
it on my Linux machine via nfs. While reading and writing files works
fine, I can't execute anything.

The error I get is of the form
<shell>: <pgm>: Operation not permitted
This happens with bash,tcsh and ksh.

The fstab entry is:
<machine:/dir>  <mydir> nfs     rw,suid,exec,nodev,user,rsize=8192,wsize=8192

User and group ids are the same on both machines.
We performed tests between two DECstations and there were no troubles
executing files.

What do you think is best:
1) have a deeper look at the docs
2) declare this as a kernel bug in fs/nfs
3) upgrade to Slackware 2.0
4) get newest version of network code from the Net

If programmed-I/O mode works and shared memory doesn't, you have a hardware
conflict.  The shared memory memory region 1) must not conflict with other
adaptors RAM *or* ROM  2) must not be shadowed and 3) must not be cached.
You've ruled out #2, but have you checked your BIOS setup for #3?

(BTW, programmed-I/O on the 3c503 is, uhmmm, "rather low performance" to put
it kindly.)

ARP on the remote machine because it looks at the address of the packet you
transmitted.  You don't need bidirectional traffic!  (I've used this as a
debugging data point -- if the remote machine knows the ethernet address,
the Tx packets are getting through.

I don't think that a new file system is necessary for this.  An easy
way to accomplish this is to write a shell script run every night,day
,whatever(via cron). This script could check the amount of free space
left on the drive, and if necessary, destroy any .o files.

Subject: growing stack for clone
Date: 12 Oct 1994 16:18:01 GMT


HI

>>> This is about kernel supported threads <<<

Intro:

To make clone viper-alike in order to test things and make 
a client/server application during viper is under construction, 
I added COPYPID option for clone syscall. This is for 32-bit
PIDs. COPYPID copies lower 16 bits of the PID which created the 
clone, and puts the clone_id in higher part.

Example: process has PID = 128 = 0x80
When 0x80 forks itself, PID=0x81, 0x82 etc is created.
When 0x80 clones itself without COPYPID, it's the same.
When 0x80 clones itself with COPYPID set, then
PID=0x10080, 0x20080 etc is created.

With this, 32-bit modifications for /proc (procfs) have sense,
indicating clones of the process in a special way. That's
something like /proc/PID_BITS_0-15/vwp/PID_BITS_16-31.

Patched 1.1.52 runs great with all this together (including
/proc/mtab) for several days.

Also an early patch for kmem-ps is done to show 32-bit PIDs.

Some time is needed to adapt clone examples based on postings
from Rob Janssen and Michael David McCartney. If there are
newer versions, please lemme know.

Upload of everything spoken here to sunsite may be expected
soon. It will be something like vwprocfs-0.4.0-1.1.52, that's
actually /proc/mtab thing which has grown out :)

Next thing is try to port one server to work with clone.

Looking for: ------->

Growing stack for clone syscall would be nice. I am 
interested did someone consider how to make it? Or 
already has some patches that provide it? I'd appreciate
any info.

Best regards, Davor.

Yeah.  I have motif 1.2.2 and having to mess around with keeping the old
*.so*3* files around is kind of a pain.  Not to mention trying to compile
something that uses the motif library, which wants the old *.sa* files.

Oh well, I guess such is the price of progress.  Hopefully they'll recompile
the motif stuff real soon (and move up to 1.2.3 in the process).

(But still- many thanks to the XFree team, obviously...)

They even seem to have a member out patrolling this group for questions

Hi all,

does anyone have experience with using a SCSI Scanner

I have got a Mustek Paragon 6000 (it was just cheap :-)
and want to scan images under Linux. This isn't supported

Has anyone written a device driver for this or has got any ideas

is there enough interest to start writing such a module?

I would appreciate any comments to this case.

Talk about an understatement!  I had noticed a big performance increase, and I

   Then why don't you take the sources for gnuplot and take out what you need?

Allow me to humbly propose PLplot.  Available via anonymous ftp from
dino.ph.utexas.edu.  Works great on Linux.  Does what the original

he wants, etc.
