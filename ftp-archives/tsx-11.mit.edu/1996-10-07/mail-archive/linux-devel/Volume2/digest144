Sorry if this is the wrong news-group, but I have to know :

   which linux (and X-windows) CD-ROM would you advise to me :

      - I want to have some kind of Motif-like X-windows, and

      - I'd use it primarily for C++ development

   Also include the address where I can order it !

Thanx !

Hello Linuxers!

Okay. Before you start sending me endless flames, I want to make sure
that you know that I *love* Linux. It's probably the best PC Un*x you
can find between here and the sun. Linux has some nice features, e.g.
the /proc filesystem, it is fast, it supports lots of hardware, it
follows the POSIX standard (which makes porting of existing software
much easier), plus: it's free. Nobody knows the exact number of Linux
installations, but it's likely to be in the 100000's. One could think
that companies are willing to consider Linux a reasonable and serious
platform, and that they would port and offer their products to the
Linux community. However, they are far away from doing so, actually. 
Here's why:

1. Commercial software products are typically binary-only (i.e., no
   source code is available). No matter what language you use for
   compilation, you will finally need libc, which happens to be FSF's
   libc on Linux. From the GLPL you learn that you are not allowed
   to make statically linked, binary-only releases of your software.
   You may, however, distribute a dynamically linked version of your
   product, since then only the startup code (crt0) is needed, which
   is explicitly excluded from the GLPL. This is perfectly okay for
   other commercial OSs, but:

2. Linux's libc tends to change its version number almost every week
   (sometimes even more often). Even though changes of the minor
   version number should not affect previous applications, they will
   sometimes break them. This means for a company that they have to
   debug the library in order to find a work-around (see 3.).

3. The kernel versions change faster than the speed of light. If you
   ask for a "stable" version, you'll be teached that there are two
   versions: 1.0 (production) and 1.1 (hacker's paradise). Wanna have a
   stable one? Get 1.0! Okay, but if I want to offer a commercial
   product, it doesn't matter what kernel version *I* am using, but
   what version is used by my potential *customers*! There's a reason
   for 1.1: it is a bit faster, it supports more hardware, it provides
   more features. As a result, most Linuxers traditionally pick up the
   the newest kernel releases all the time - and usually end up in this
   newsgroup, saying "this is broken", "that doesn't work anymore",
   "can't compile", etc. (if you don't believe me, just exit this thread
   for a moment and take a look at the other subjects). Besides other
   disadvantages, this will definitely not convince companies of the
   stability and usefulness of Linux!

4. The spirit of free software is all around. Free in both meanings:
   free availability of the sources, and free of charge. Which does
   not go together with commercial interests very well. Just to give
   you an example of what I'm talking about: I'm the author of tgdb,
   a graphical user interface for gdb. I like the idea of free software,
   and so I asked my employer for permission to make it GPL'd freeware.
   Guess what, he said "No way!". So I ripped off my bones and used all
   of my talents to persuade him to make it a shareware product instead
   of a true commercial package. Well, now that tgdb is available for
   a couple of weeks, I'm quite sure there are 100's or even more people
   who use it for their daily debug sessions. Fine. But the bloody truth
   is that not even a *single* person has paid the nominal shareware
   fee of US$30!

5. On the other hand, I can tell you how to make lots of money with Linux: 
   simply download the archives of tsx-11, sunsite, nic.funet.fi,
   prep.ai.mit.edu and ftp.x.org, put them on a CDROM, call it "Dream Linux"
   or similar, and sell if for US$35 per copy. It's that easy. Let's say,
   an average user is looking for "the better OS" and wants to try out
   Linux. He buys a "Dream Linux" CD - and is lost. Nothing works "out of
   the box", no reasonable documentation is available, nor hotline support. 
   What will happen? I'm quite sure that most of these desperated people
   will close the Linux chapter - forever.

There are a lot more things which speak against Linux as a platform for
commercial products. If an operating system is successful or not depends
on the availability of qualified (commercial) software for end-users. I
would like to see companies porting their WYSIWIG word processors, graphic
tools, spreadsheets, compilers, backup software, and whatever to Linux.
Linux is great, but at present mostly for developers and freaks - *not* for
average users who need a reliable platform for doing their jobs. Whoever
asks for a good word processor for Linux, hears something like "word
processing is out - try TeX", or "you can run xyz under DOSEMU" or "try SCO
versions of xyz; just recompile the kernel with SYSV support and get the
iBSC2 package from foo.bar". This can be - at most - a temporary work-around.
Users don't want to know how to roll a new kernel, they don't want to ftp
packages, unpack, configure, compile, debug and install them. That's why
they are willing to spend some bucks in commercial software, and that's why
Macs and Windoze are so successful. And that's why Linux is not.

   Quo vadis, Linux? Do we continue to like Linux "as is", or should we
change something in order to encourage companies to develop commercial, but
sophisticated end-user software for this beautiful OS? Do we continue to
keep Linux a powerful tool for wizards only, or do we want to see Linux 
being used in offices and other commercial environments? If we *really*
want Linux to succeed, we *need* the companies and their commercial products!

Thanks,
mike

I think the errormessage says enough: photo CD's don't have a 
ISO 9660 filesystem on it, otherwise Linux should have mounted it.
ISO 9660 filesystems is only for CD-ROM, another CD substandard.
I don't know how to read from a photo CD under Linux, under MS-DOG with

The performance with f2c + gcc seems to vary wildly from one application
to the next.  A good F77 compiler will beat f2c+gcc on the whetstone 
benchmarks by 3 fold.  But then again I have found on some of my own
scientific codes that f2c+gcc produces code that actually executes faster
than that of the Sun F77 compiler.  The only tweeking that was needed
was to set -DREGISTER as an option on the gcc compile.  Consistancy is
the problem along with the lack of a free F77 debugger.

When does gf77 come out of alpha testing?

Hye,

I possess S3 928 card with a ti3020 RAMDAC, PCI Bus, Pentium 60 Mhz.
X11 (XF86_S3 2.1.1) works correctly (1024x768) but with a little problem. 
A small band (about 20 pixels) is not printed left but right. So there 
is a gap between mouse cusor and real pointed position.
When i specify no_ramdac in Xconfig, these problems don't appear (but
a small one line shift is present in middle of screen) and screen is not
so clean than with ti3020.

I'd like to know :
- if bugs are known !
- if the band can be suppress (by example with an option in Xconfig) or
- if cursor is able to be manage not by S3_card but by soft (in order to 
  suppress gap).

On my TODO list for MAKEDEV is trying to decide what devices should be
made for the new floppy driver.  David's message makes it clear that there
are more problems in just adding extra names for the new sizes/densities
(which had been my original plan).

Thus, I suspect that some decision will have to be made on the naming
of floppy devices, and I don't feel qualified to do this.  I'm quite
happy to add to MAKEDEV whatever is felt to be best.

My only comment is that fd0H2880 was based on something, but I know not
what, and was a name chosen quickly to support the 2.88 Mb support.

I ran across the same thing when I compiled the 1.1.49 kernel.  The
patches seem to not place some of the files correctly. If you look in 
directory you applied the patches from (probably /usr/src or 
/usr/src/linux) I'd bet that you'll see some stray .h and .c files.
Look at what source files the make fails on, look at the paths, and move
the stray files to their proper directories.

That's why it should be implemented as a file system. All the normal OS
tools would continue to work, but under the hood it would be optimised
to not waste disk blocks and to not even need a fixed size inode table.

If it was a file system, it would be totally compatible with all
existing news software, although you might want to keep certain
things out of /usr/news/spool. Of course, modifications could be
made to INN to take advantage of new features like the integrated
history and NOV.

In the original suggestion I mentioned that the list of common strings
used would be configurable and that there should be a tool that
would analyse existing news spools to come up with a suggested
list for your unique site. If nothing else, the headers 
(i.e. References: or Newsgroups:) and the newsgroup names of the
most common newsgroups would end up in that dictionary. As you will
note, those strings occur in every (many) article(s) but LZ
compression on a single article will not be able to compress them.

LZ dictionaries aren't used to look up words, they are used to look
up repeated strings so in your example strings like " thi" and "ing"
would end up in the dictionary for that one posting. I'm not sure that
there is much payback on LZ compression of short articles, but longer
ones should work well.
