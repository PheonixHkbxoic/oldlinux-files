Just to clear things up a bit: there are indeed two different parties
working on this, but we really shouldn't talk about two different ports. 
It's more a matter of different approaches, and the port done by Jim
Paradis is certainly 32-bit.  This isn't as bad as it sounds: it just
means that the user-level VM is limited to about 2GB, as the Alpha
really is a native 64 bit chip and doesn't have separate 32/64 bit
modes. 

[ small plug for the Alpha: I don't know about others, but I think the
  Alpha chip is a helluva good chip.  *Very* nice design ]

The port by Jim is going to be ready earlier, and I'm not quite stupid
enough to ignore what he has done: I expect the final Alpha port to be
quite heavily influenced on his work.  I want to use the 64-bit version
of gcc to compile the eventual alpha-linux, not so much to break the 2GB
VM barrier as just to catch out some of the worst 32-bitisms in the
current kernel.  Jim didn't want to worry about those right now. 

In short, it's not "Linus vs DEC", but just stages of development and
different goals: Jim primarily wants a linux port to the Alpha, while my
main motivation is to play around with a very nice (and different and
FAST) machine.  I hope the end result will be a well-balanced system ;-)

I think a repost is in order:

To enable this feature, edit the file
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.5.8/specs thusly:

Add to the line following the line saying "*cpp:":
%{!ansi:-lang-c++}

DO NOT use -lang-c-c++-comments as someone suggested; it will break
compiling C++ programs!

I have been told a future version of GCC 2.6.x will support the
command line option:

-Wp,-lang-c-c++-comments

(Incidentally, I got the patches against the then-latest alpha within
12 hours of sending this suggestion to the gcc-bugs mailing list!
Talk about support!)

I don't know about "pure" Intel motherboards but I have a Gateway 2K P5-90

does NOT work in it.  (Nice of them to tell you before you bought it though.)
I've tried several BIOS versions both from Intel and Gateway without any luck.
(Some worse than others: Floppy drive?  What floppy drive?  I don't have a

was removed.  I have some docs on the MB from Intel but they don't mention
NCR anywhere.  I'm seriously considering a Nextor card which is supposed to
have the BIOS on the card.  Any one have any experiences with these?  Anybody

Subject: Filesystem idea
From: riku.saikkonen@compart.fi (Riku Saikkonen)
Date: Mon, 10 Oct 94 20:17:00 +0200

Got this odd idea the other day...

Some 'temporary file' capability for the filesystems might be a good
thing. For example, with an oft-compiled largish application, it's good
to keep the .o files in the directory(/-ies). But they fill up disk
space... What I'm suggesting is some sort of 'temp file' attribute that
would keep the file on disk until space runs low. Then, when the disk
space is almost 0, it would start deleting the temp files to free space.

Files like .o, perhaps some other temporary files, files converted to
another format for speed but with the original file still lying around,
things like that might benefit from this...

I know, this isn't too easy to implement. I don't have time for it. And
I'm not even sure if this would be that useful. But if some filesystem
expert feels bored... :)

Anybody defending that C++ is a _true_ super-set of C is obviously wrong.
There are quite a number of things that make it an "improper" superset.

Date: Sun, 9 Oct 1994 19:26:17 GMT

Hello,

Once upon a time I saw a nice feature on a midrange systems file
system: You could define a maximum file size in blocks for one
file and every append on that file didn't made it grow. Some
sort of wraparound. Didn't this might be a good feature for ext2?
One could define a max size of 50k for a logfile and never check
again where all the space has gone.

Any ideas, pros, cons?

I've got bad news for you, I'm afraid.  I have one of these too, which 
I've instaleld in various op systems and at thsi poitn know ALOT about...

1) What you REALLY have is a Wearnes CD-ROM and (if you are using the 
orchid interface) a Wernes sony act-alike interface.  The drive is
ELCTRONICLY compatable with the sony interface BUT

2) The Wearnes is NOT compatable on a software level with the sony 
drives.  It uses a different control protocol.  Any driver written for 
the sony drives will NOT work with this drive.  You need a Wearnes 
specific driver.

3) As far as I know (and this may be outdated info) nobody has written a 
Wearnes driver for Linux.

Your choices are:
A) Install some other way (the yygdrasil has a slow but functional method 
of reaching ANY dos compatable cd-rom drive through its dos driver.  
Unfortunately, this means 'thunking' values down to 16 bit and dropping 
otu of proteted mode, all this slows performance way down.)  After you 
have our Linux installed, see if you can get the necessary info out of 
Wearnes and hack the sony driver to work with it.

B) Get a new drive.  (This is what i did.  I bought a Sony 33A (which is 
a cheap OEM version of the 31a and fully compatable with it.  I bought 
mine in a 'Media Magic' package for about $129.00)

Sorry I don't have more upbeat info for you.

Not very hard to do, but why clutter up the operating system with more

That's a perfectly valid filename; why waste one character?
