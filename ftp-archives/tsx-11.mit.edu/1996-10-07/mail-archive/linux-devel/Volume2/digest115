I am not impressed with the Power Mac at all.  There's a researcher
in the lab who just got one ... all of his benchmarks run *faster*
on an 040 Quadra! ... and he using a native Power PC compiler.
BTW both the Quadra and the PowerMac are slower than a Pentium 60
running Linux.

People have to realize that a RISC cpu needs a good compiler ... this
guy is probably going to have to wait through a couple of compiler
releases before he gets decent performance ... he's ready to dump the
system now :-)

But back to the point ...

I buy systems, not CPUs.  The list price of the CPU doesn't have squat
to do with the price of the system.  If your buying a high-end monitor,
big disk, and >= 32Mb of RAM, the CPU price is lost in the noise.

Now what about maintenance?  I agree that SGI makes fine systems (we
are looking at some of their higher-end workstations) but I can't go
to the corner computer store and buy parts for it :-).

Where are they?  How many vendors sell them?  Do you have prices?

DOS compatibility is not an issue but hardware availability is.

We are seeing a problem with the IP routing in the 1.1.45+ kernels.
The default route is not being used.  Putting a literal route in
the table works fine, but we have too many networks to document.
Anybody tried this on a big network?

There is ONE thing about shared library Sun people emphasize
as advantage in comparison to us. Suppose a smart user makes
his shared library; in sun he doesn't need to be root to use 
it. For Linux, running ldconfig requires root privilegies.
Is this necessary; can we have local ldconfig? I'd like to have
this feature.

It needs more than WYSIWYG on terminals, it also needs a WYSIWYG way
of printing on your printer and on mine. Unfortunately, ghostscript
is not quite up to the job. It is incredibly inefficient and somewhat
buggy. From the letter that Peter Deutsch sent to Linux Journal, I wonder
how soon this situation will be improved, if ever. What is really needed
is a way for X client to use X-graphics calls to render images on an
X-print-server in the same way as X is now rendered on an 
X-terminal-server.

The database back ends such as metalbase exist. But the front ends do

This requires a standard graphics format in the same way as the PICT format
is a Mac standard. Hmmmm... maybe the PICT format could be adopted
as the graphics standard. Anyway, O'Reilly has a new Book/CD
called the Encyclopedia of Graphics File Formats which is mandatory
reading before deciding which standard to use.

Maybe it would be nicer to have minixdf as the default, instead of 
BSD. Luckily one can remount root to use minixdf.

BTW, the mount code is confusing me. :(

I can not see where things like the mount flags are initialized. It
seems to me that it never is, but I must be wrong, since if that was
the case, things would break.

Anyone that can tell me how execution proceeds from sys_mount all the
way to ext2_read_super, etc works and where stuff is initialized, I'd
really like to know..

Yep, type 'cd /pub/linux/ALPHA/dosemu/private/devel' and you'll be in.  I just
installed it on 1.1.45 and it works great!  I have it set already (took almost
no time at all) to boot off of my real DOS drive.  It runs Stacker so I can get
at all of my files.  I have been running WP6.0 and it runs great.  It is a bit
slower than running native but hell, it runs in 1024x768x256 and I'm not
complaining!

The only problem I have has to do with using more than 2 serial ports.  I want
to run my XT laptop as a terminal off of COM4 but my mouse is on COM2.  When I
try to use both at the same time nothing works from the terminal and the mouse
doesn't respond either.  Would it work better if I shared COM3 with my mouse
since COM3 is a 16550?  I must look at the serial code to see if there is
something I can do.  It would be nice if someone could run WP6.0 on the console
while I run off the terminal *and* the person could use the mouse under DOS.

I am trying to run with a mouse on COM2, modem on COM3 and terminal on COM4.
Whenever I use both the mouse (COM2) and the terminal (COM4) at the same time I
get no response from either.  Is there any code around for sharing IRQs?  If

It doesn't sound like a filesystem problem to me.  It could be anything
in the kernel that is writing to a structure referenced by an invalid
pointer.  I don't see why the filesystem is particularly suspect.  The
filesystem deals with blocks of data.  If an entire block was misplaced,
then I'd suspect the filesystem.

If we could see a real example of corrupted data (viewed in text and
with od -x), it might shed some light on the situation.  Perhaps only
certain bits are twiddled, in which case we can look at various
structures maintained by the kernel and see which ones would be likely
to change data in that pattern, if it were to write to an invalid
pointer.

Sorry to follow up my own post.  I already have 2 parallel ports on 5 and 7 and
a sound card on IRQ7.  Unfortunately, I don't think my multi-I/O card can
change the IRQ for COM4 to IRQ2.  Thus, changing IRQs is not an option.

The kernel allocates memory for the video text buffers at startup

Until the kernel can dynamically alloc and dealloc memory, the VT mode
changing won't work.
