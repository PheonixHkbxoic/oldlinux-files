I thought I'd give Wine a try this weekend, but I can't even get past
./Configure, because that script needs "makedepend," which I don't
have.  Where might I find it.

Thanks.

These should have been in sys/types.h a long time ago along with the
unsigned versions.  I've ported the TCP stack several times to weird
hardware where this sort of thing was desperately needed.

Before everyone says that "My weird ass machine doesn't have 16 bit 
integers" note that you use these types when THESE ARE EXACTLY WHAT 
YOU NEED.  Like in protocol structures, where the size is determined
by the bits on the wire, not "My weird ass machine".   Then if your 
machine doesn't work, at least you get the errors right up front and
can go diddle your way around it.

        I know this is probably a faq question but oh well. Is there
        any linux kernels precompiled available anywhere ? My kernel
        file is corrupted and I readlly don't feel like installing 
        the entire slackware library just for the kernel. I also have 
        not installed any compilers yet. This is the reason I need a 
        precompiled version for the intel chipset. I would appreciate 
        direct responces. PLEASE respond.

Subject: Dell Dimension XPS P60 Problems
Date: 1 Oct 1994 10:49:15 -0500

I installed Slackware v2.01 on the above machine with the 1.0.9 kernel.
This worked fine. I then compiled a v1.1.51 kernel that I had run on
my previous Dell EISA machine.

This kernel locks up the system as soon as it accesses the NE2000
Ethernet board. No, sorry, it locks up when applications write to
the network device. Thw kernel probes the bus and finds the board
correctly though.

The Dell box has a PCI bus and an AMI BIOS, rev A6. There problems
somewhere in this as reboots from ctrl-alt-del or software lock
the system. I also get a bios32_init error from the v1.1.51 kernel
as it comes up.

I would be interested to know if anyone has had similar mileage from
this equipment. It's frustrating. I even came in over the weekend
to fix it... Lifes like that, I guess.

I have bought a gray scale mono SVGA monitor that can support
256 color at 800x640 with Trident 9000 0.5 M card
to drive it.

It works fine in DOS/WINDOWS.

When I select the XF86_SVGA at the 800x640 resolution,
the character or the object is very large.

The config file is the one from the XF86_Configure.

The name of the Monitor is DATAS. Does any one
has a clue ?

Ok I have a question for you guys.  Since I didn't here the beginning of
this thread I have this particular problem:


I have a problem.  There is a machine which I dial up and get
a slip link to.  On this machines network I can access all of the 
machines.  However I have to telnet to a machine I have an account on
on that network to be able to telnet or ftp to the rest of the internet.
Is there a way I can somehow have the machine that I do have an account
on to act as some sort of a gateway.  I've tried specifiing that machine
as my gateway to no avail.

                                                  #########

                                                 $$$$$$$$$$

I want to make it look to my machine as if I am connected directly to
the internet.  And if possible to the internet that I am connected directly
to it.  I am assuming the termserver will not route packets out side of
the network the machine "bert" lies on.  I have an account on the machine
bert, which is how I access the internet.  I would like to be able to
do what I do from bert directly from my machine, which happens to be
a linux box.

Here is what I see when I type the route command on my box.  By the way 
which is a Linux machine.

Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface

uiucgate is the name of the termserver, or at least the name I gave it in
my hosts file.

In my experience, the 1540/42 "B" models are rock-solid.  Have not used
a "C" or "CF" so I can't report on them other than some rumours of problems.
I used one for two years under Linux and have recommended them to others
who have had no problems either.  I am currently using the BusLogic 445S
and Ultrastore 34F VESA LB cards to gain some performance, however.  But
for an all-around card, the 1540/42 B is a good card... plus you can 
find them sometimes used for around 70 bucks - not a bad deal.  An outfit
in CA is selling the Ultrastore 34F cards for 89 bucks which is a real 
good deal except that Ultrastore has gone down the tubes... if no vendor
support bothers you, don't get one; otherwise you can get a great SCSI 
card for about 1/4 of what it cost.

Try using xvmixer.  It uses the XView libraries, so you'll need them in order
to compile them.  I have a PAS16 and it works just fine with it.

I don't remember offhand where it can be found, but I'd try looking at
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X as the root hierarchy of your search.
