Dear Linux-fans,

        Are there GUI libraries in C/C++ for Linux (non X)?

"Seemed to work fine" or "was binary compatible"?  Big difference.

I don't know if it was decided to standardize on major number 6
for X11R6, or if the new libraries actually were not binary compatible.
I am curious to know.

David Niemi and I have been sharing a similar discussion.  We have yet to
be able to pin-point just where the problem might be regarding the
differences we're seeing.  I will post as soon as we have some speculation
about what might be happening to produce such poor results in the cases I've
run versus those he has run.  I've been worried up till now since all of the
benchmark results I've seen except David's indicate there is a problem. 
But now I have two independent confirmations that the shell results are
not necessarily correct.  (balanced by several results to the contrary as
well)  I intend to keep looking until the disparity can be adequately
explain/understood.  Hopefully my results are incorrect: an easily remedied
result of a systematic error.  The problem is that we haven't been able to
find the problem yet.

Which version of the libraries/compiler/ld.so/shell are you using?

Thanks to all the folks who are running the benchmark as well.  This is a
time consuming process and you all deserve a share of the credit!

This is only partially true -

        1. Adaptec will not release programming details regarding
            the interface to their microcode without a NDA, but 
            you _can_ write your own.

        2. Adaptec will release full programming details on the board
            and chip.

        3. Adaptec's technical support often lies about the second fact,
            suggesting that a NDA is required and refusing to let you
            speak with the supervisor.

A survey done some time ago suggested that there were 200,000-400,000
Linux users.

A driver has been written for the 274x and 284x boards, and seems to 
be reasonably stable.  Some one is currently modifying it to grok 
the 2940 boards.

One interesting point is the sharing of IRQ's between tty0/2 and tty1/3.  This may
be causing part of your problem (only thing I can suggest not knowing exactly how
your link is set up)

Good luck.

That is the point. Usually under linux /bin/sh is linked to /bin/bash.
But imagine if it was either pdksh,ash or a stripped down bash (that is
using config.h.mini resulting in a bash w/o history and readline) or
even a zsh. That will make a lot of difference.
I think that the library or the compiler are only do little to the
performance (but i might be wrong). I am not so sure about ld.so ...

   Thanks to all the folks who are running the benchmark as well.  This is a

What about using the SPEC benchmark ? v1.2 is available on FTP. I will try to
run the suite over the weekend.

The 3c501 is not supposed to work with Linux.  See the hardware FAQ.

What we have just found, however, is that the 3c503 card Rev C WILL NOT WORK!
3c503 Rev A DOES work, but 3COM won't supply it anymore, just the Rev C.  We

+------------->

My suggestion:

Q: Which is better, Linux or FreeBSD?

A: Neither is intrinsically "better".  The answer is the same as for any
   operating systems X and Y:

        1. Does it do what you need?  If not, don't waste your time on it.
           (This one probably doesn't matter for FreeBSD vs. Linux.)

        2. Are the programs and/or device drivers you need available?

        3. Assuming you've found some OSes that pass the above two, try them
           all out.  Use them for as long as practicable, preferably for
           several weeks apiece.

        4. If one of them does what you need more easily (this includes
           administration and usage), prefer it.

        5. If it's easier to get support for one than the other locally,
           all other things being equal, use it.  (That is, if you have no
           local Linux gurus but have a FreeBSD expert around, you are better
           off using FreeBSD, all other things being equal.)

        6. If they're all about equal, use the one which *you* find easiest
           to work with.  Don't pay attention to your friends or the Usenet
           (or IRC, etc.) on this one; the question is which one you
           *personally* find easiest to work with --- after all, who will be
           using your installation, you or them?

        7. If you still can't decide, try repeating the above with stricter
           guidelines.

        8. Still can't decide?  You're unlikely to get this far without
           deciding on one, but if you do you might as well flip a coin.
           ---But if you really haven't got a personal preference at this
           point you're probably a computer yourself :-)

(The unstated point being that, insofar as technical merits are concerned,
they're basically equal.)

I am running a multi-line SLIP dialin server. For months we have had problems 
that sometimes the "sliplogin" program was not getting killed.  We finally 
found that the problem is in the Kernel " close() " function; this function 
does sometimes *not return*.  We have fixed the problem with a patch that 
re-kills the program after a 15 second timeout, when it is still 'alive'. The 
problem is definately in the kernel, but we have never found anybody who could 
do something about it.  Our dirty patch keeps our system online, but does not 
fix the root of the problem.  You problem could very well be the same.

Subject: Login program crashes
Date: Fri, 14 Oct 1994 06:12:42 GMT

Hi.  I am running a multi-line SLIP dial-in server.

Sometimes when a user dials in, and it goes wrong, the LOGIN program, which is 
executed by Mgetty, crashes.  It stays active forever, and the modem stays 
on-line as well.  When I Kill the login program,  Mgetty gives a heavy error 
on the main virtual terminal (something like: cannot initialise port, 
operation aborted) after which it goes full cycle and starts again, and resets 
the modem. All hunky dory after that.
When login hangs, and I give a 'ps', I see often:   ... login +++     Which is 
a typical modem escape code as the 'login name'.  Sometimes I have two lines 
of junk...

The login program I am using came with the Slackware 1.2 distribution.

Anybody knows of any later versions of Login may have solved this problem?

Can you please reply by E-Mail, 

Thanks,

Everything, if you wish to give files attributes.
UNIX programs read and write *files*, not directories.
This *would* break existing code, if we were to suddenly start 
using separate directories to store little bits of fluff associated
with each file.  Forks are for storing information that pertains
to a particular file, not for keeping separate but related
data sets together in one large file.

The ext2fs already does.  These are kernel mode extensions, and I
don't think that they are such Bad Things.  But I am talking about
forks which would be read and written entirely by USER mode code.  
In particular, I gave two examples of things that could be 
done in user mode.  

I think that forks offer a simple and consistent way
to associate arbitrary data with files.

           This is a weekly question.
           More often than not, we get into a flame war
           on this.  Let's stop this silliness!!!

The only way we're going to stop this silliness is to simply start
ignoring the querants.  If someone asks "Which is better?  Which is
better?", jumping up and down all the while, and everybody just flat
out _ignores_ the question and goes about their business as if nothing
happened, folks will eventually get the point and stop asking.

Consider carefully: It's not the questions that start the bloody flame
wars, it's everyone's pathetic attempts to answer!  "Well, xxx is
better because of yyy.."  "No it's not!"  "Yes it is, you moron!  Just
look at blah blah blah!"  "Well, you're a complete idiot who obviously
wouldn't know an operating system if it bit you - yyy is _obviously_
better because bleh bleh bleh!".  And so downhill it goes from there.

No FAQ will ever satisfy the two sides, and would rapidly become
obsolete even if it did.  Dave Burgess's FAQ _tries_ to answer this
question about as well as any FAQ could, and people still aren't
remotely satisfied.  One German magazine reviewer who compared FreeBSD
to Linux ended up making an unfavorable judgement of FreeBSD because
_it didn't have enough shells_ bundled in by default!  He completely
ignored the other issues, he just wanted his bloody tcsh to be happy.
This almost perfectly exemplifys the average querant - they don't
really want to know which is better in general (as if "better in
general" meant anything anyway), they want to know which is better for
THEM, and how the hell are we supposed to know that?

           The distraction is overwhelming and we need a solution.

The solution is obvious, and in right front of our faces.  Don't even
bother with such questions.  Ignore them.  If you're dead-set on
answering questions, then there are PLENTY of more worthy questions
posed every single day that could use meaningful answers.  Why waste
time with people who only want to know which brand gives you whiter
teeth, fresher breath, cures acne or gets out those nasty grass
stains?  Such people are better off watching daytime television talk
shows or reading "USA Today" anyway ("Today on Sally Jesse Rafael,
we'll be asking the question "Which is better?  Linux or FreeBSD?",
and we'll also be interviewing 3 truck drivers who like to do long
cross-country trips with live hamsters in their shorts.")

Sheesh!
