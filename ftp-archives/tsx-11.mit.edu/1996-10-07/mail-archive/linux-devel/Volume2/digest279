Given the reputation of some of them I should hope not 8). I don't think
there is any material difference to be honest except that when a bug
shows up you have the source code handy to fix it.

Date: Fri, 7 Oct 1994 17:50:25 GMT

Has anyone succeeded in getting an Orchid Soundwave32 run under
Linux ? I tried to but failed.
The docs claim the card to be compatible with, among others, 
Soundblaster but they say that the compatibility is invoked by the 
dos or windoze driver loading some code to the DSP of the soundcard
which means bad luck for Linux I think :-(.

I configured and compiled the kernel with Soundblaster support and
the same DMA/IRQ-Settings as used under DOS/Windoze but it doesn't
work :-(. cat /dev/sndstat showes a Soundblaster driver to be installed
but cat anything >/dev/audio just shows "no such device or address".

Oh, and the kernel I used is version 1.0.9.

Thanks in advance for any input on this subject,

Chris

There is no process, that I'm aware of, to certify third part toolkits
as Motif compliant.  We've been looking for one for some time, and it
doesn't exist, except at the API level.

There is no process that I'm aware of that certifies an application as
Motif compliant.  There are documents that talk about the app doing
this or that and present a checklist, but no organization to do the
certification.

There is a API certification test suite.

Not all Motif reimplementations ignore the behavior.  We've put a lot
of effort into OI to make sure that you can't tell the difference
between it and OSF/Motif in a blind taste test.  There are some things
that are different, but the major look issues, as well as the feel
issues are the same.

Depends.  I'd rather write a user-mode driver for something than mess

You can set this up however you want, and map about anything to
buttons with any icon.  My only complaint is the default size of
the buttons are too large.  But this is easily changed.
Here is what I have mapped:

A. Previous desktop  B. Next desktop   C. Resize window 
D. Move window  E. Lower window  F. Iconify/deiconify 
G. Kill window  H. Xmagnify   I. xman  J. xmail
K. xfilemanager L. xterm  M. Desk-0 indicator  
N. Exit/Restart/Refresh menu.

Each button has an icon that shows clearly what the button does.
i.e.  Forexample button N shows a stop sign.

By using the side, istead of the bottom, I still have about 1024x910
of my 1152x910 display left.  Leaving me ruffly a square screen area 
to work with.

Whats wrong with them.  I prefere virtual screens to virtual desktops,
but normally I use a combination of both.  i.e. Completely separate
projects go on different desktops, the same project overflows to
different virtual screens.  Since it is a pain sticking windows
switching to another desktop and then unsticking them (the only way
I know to move windows between desktops) virtual screens tend to
be easier.

You can arrange your desktop however you want.  I agree this should be
much easier to configure.  It took me quite awhile to come-up with
something I think looks just as professional as as the HP-UX
environment.  Even longer to improve on it.  "vuewm" is you can't
load your own background, you have to stick to ugly patterns.  
I much prefere being able to have 'xv" load a random picture from
CD every 5 or so minuites, so I'm not constantly looking at the
same thing.

What is really needed is:

  1. A Null box.  i.e. Something that can be used to mark areas for
     xload, xbiff, and icons even when they aren't present, but as
     far as the window manager is conserned don't exist.

  2. Auto-resume from last session.  i.e.  Each time I end-up opening
     several xterms in one screen, emacs somewhere else, Mosaic, ...
     if fvwm could remember what I had running when I quit and ask
     me to restart them again, it would be quite a timesaver.

        The Orchid CDROM drive does not work with any of the current
Linux device drivers, however we did test it with the DOS callback
driver in the Yggdrasil Fall 1994 distribution and that worked.  I
believe that driver is FTPable from sunsite.unc.edu, and, of course
it is part of our CDROM, which you buy from your local computer store
or directly from us.

If bash is compiled with RESTRICTED_SHELL defined, running `bash -r' or

We are using SLIP!  And the problems we see are not *after* a connection

(apparently).  Nearly all functions handled by inetd seem affected: 
telnet logins, rlogins, ftp attempts, smail connections, attemps to do

work fine *most* of the time, but the login problems are the most

Maybe, but the next step after that is interrupts and DMA and trying to do
those from user space will probably crash the system if they don't fail
because of insufficient permissions.

Remember also that port I/O from a user process can easily interfere with
devices it shouldn't touch, and thereby corrupt data or crash the system
(consider accidentally diddling the disk controller's ports).
