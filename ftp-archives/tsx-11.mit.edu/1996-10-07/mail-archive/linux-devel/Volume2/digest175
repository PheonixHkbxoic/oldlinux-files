I don't want to start any language feuds here, but of course there is a
language that already allows you to do exactly this: it's called ADA.
The notation is a little different, but basically you can tell it what
range (and what precision!) you want for a certain type, and it will figure
out how to handle that according to your platform. Of course if you specify
something your platform is unable to handle the compiler will spit at you :-)

Exactly what Ada's predefined types are. As a sideline: ternary computers
have been tried if my memory is correct, but it seems they weren't too hot
or very practical...

I have an X11 spread sheet that will read 1-2-3 files.  The author gave it to me
to release under Linux, but I never finished it.  It is quite capable, but
it does not do plots, and it is only black and white.  It is quite fast
though.  I was in the process of interfacing it with gnuplot when I ran out
of time.  If anyone want the source code to develop it, send me some mail.
Please note that I have to get permission from the original author before
I do this, so unless you are serious about working on it, I would rather
not bother him.

There was a GREAT OO spreadsheet developed originally for NeXT that was then
taken over by Lotus (I think) that would be a great product for Linux/X.

I forget the name of the product, though...  (Intuit?  Something like that?).

If we could get that particular product for linux, the spreadsheet problem

Hi all !

I would be interested in replies to this question, being that I had to
give up approx 35 MB of my 545 MB drive, due to non standard translations
done by my IDE accellerator, when heads go over 1024. ( I was time
limited when transferring my linux files off of my 345 ) I have since
learned I can work around this with the new kernel I have, (1.1.45) since
it queries the drive directly.

I had almost everything on a 105 MB partition for a few months, till I
replaced my second drive. I found that when I gave it 200 + 16 swap,
I had lots to spare *but* it's quickly filling up, as I'm adding new
stuff to it. (wine, dosemu, TeX). I think it depends on how you want
to use it. The stuff available for linux seems endless.

Yggdrassil has a plug'n'play cd and slackware has a cd version also,
where I hear you can run some of the less frequently used binaries
from, ( also hear it's slower ).

I'd say you can more than get away with 200 MB (a least for a few
months)

Hope this helps.

I'd like to see a ftp based file system for Linux. What I have in mind will
allow you to mount devices like


mount -t ftpfs myaccount:mypassword@somemachine.edu/path mnt

and the directory specified by path on the remote machine will appear at the
mount point. I know it will not be the fastest distributed file system, but
it will work with existing machines.

I've heard that someone wrote a similar file system for NextStep. Anyone
have any comments?

Interesting... what exactly was added to gcc in the 1.x.x to 2.x.x
transistion that caused so much performance loss?  What types of
programs will *NOT* compile under gcc 1?  And is it that (at least in
my experience) gcc 1 is so rarely mentioned or used?

A mutex is not necessarily the same thing as a spinlock.  Spinlocks typically
involve busywaiting - tying up the CPU that is spinning on the lock for an
(often prolonged) period of time.  This is why spinlocks are typically used
for situations where the lock will be held for a short period of time.

A mutex, on the other hand, guarantees mutual exclusion by placing threads
waiting on the lock on a queue, then starting another thread that is ready
to run.  Thus, useful work can be done rather than having the thread waiting
on the lock taking up useless CPU (and bus) cycles by spinning.

I would guess that Sun used a mutex (as you said) and not a spinlock (as
Scott said).

I have installed Linux v1.0 Slackware release for 24hr SLIP access
into ClarkNet and SMTP for my Novell 3.11 LAN.  Everything works 
great except some mail that is sent out through SMTP causes a 
uucp_neighbors error.  I know there is a missing file called
/usr/lib/smail/routers that will correct this with the right config 
in it.  The error is :

Xdefer: <address> reason: <ERR_127> router uucp_neighbors :
command '/usr/bin/uuname' returned exit status EX_32256

I know calling uuname is a bug in SMAIL and a routers file will fix
this but I don't know wht to put in it.

What do I need to put in /usr/lib/smail/routers to get these messages
delivered?  Thanks for the help.

>On the 68000 the external address bus is 20 bits and the external data bus

The 68000 has a 24-bit address bus.  20 bits is only 1mb RAM.  24-bits is
16mb RAM which is the 68000's limit I think.  I know the Atari ST's
could put more than 20 bits on the address lines.

Also, the external data bus was 16-bits.

What I do a lot in my C code to avoid bit size problems is define
variables as int8, int16, int32, and int64.  These are typedef's in
a machine dependent header file.

Of course, I only do this when I absolutely have to.  I try to write
code where the range doesn't matter or will fit within 32-bits (I
don't worry about supporting 16-bit OS's much).

It may be flawed but it has saved me a lot of headache in some projects.

Has everyone forgotten about PL/1?  It also allowed specification
in that manner.  One of the only really nice features of PL/1.

Yes, by thinking about what something is suid or sgid to, you can get
round this particular problem.  But having said that, the Unix
security mechanisms in general are probably the worst of any major OS.
We need to think about how we can do better.  I was looking forward to
the debate, and I was rather disappointed when people just flamed the
original poster without making any other suggestion.

Here are a couple of my thoughts:

* Having a single user root is unhelpful.  Suppose you have three
sysadmins; the logs will not distinguish between them if they all log
on as the same thing in order to maintain the system.  What if you
have someone who is basically an ordinary user, but has a daemon that
needs to listen on a port below 1024?

The solution to this is to assign privileges to particular users, in
the way that VMS does.  So one privilege would allow listening on
ports below 1024, while others would allow file protection to be
overriden.  This scheme could be integrated into the Unix scheme of
things by making membership of particular groups confer special
rights.

* The granularity of access control is too coarse.  Controlling access
on a group level is often inconvenient (and is insufficient for C2
approval under the orange book).  Access control lists have been
implemented for many Unixes - I wrote the 386BSD implementation.  I
would be happy to do the same for Linux, if we can arrive at a
consensus on what the API ought to be.

I've been using linux for about 6 months and have got it linked with two
