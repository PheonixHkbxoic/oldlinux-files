Not quite true... SCO MPX will work with many of them.  But it would still
be good to have Linux available......

While I agree and disagree in varying amounts with the rest of this message
I would like to take agree with the above, in general, but object to the
statement that NO commercial companies have or will port their products..

What are we? Chopped Liver?

WorkGroup Solutions and Multisoft have taken the plunge by porting FlagShip
which is the Unix version of the CA/Clipper language from the DOS world.

There are tons of commercial software packages written in Clipper (Possibly
as many as all other languages put together), and all of these are now
a simple compile away from Linux.

There is a huge aftermarket for Clipper written products and add ons.  Clipper
is powerful enough to emulate Fox & Dbase ... the premise behind our FoxKit..
FlagShip may be the key to bringin Linux to 200+ K Clipper programmers, 
Millions of users of Clipper written programs, and about 20 million Dbase &
Foxers.....

FlagShip sells for thousands of dollars on "Commercial" Unix systems, and we
have thousands of installations.

We are gambling that Linuxers want DOS pricing levels, and offer our
Linux product inexpensively enough to qualify for this designation.

We are also working at convincing other commercial vendors to take the 
plunge............

What is missing?   THE SUPPORT FROM THE LINUX COMMUNITY

You want your OS to be to MicroSoft, as MicroSoft was to IBM (It's undoing)?
The democratic solution to a potential Gates Dictatorship?

Then you need to get behind, buy, try and talk about the commercial packages 
that take the risk to jump into Linux early.  It is buyers that allow 
commercial development to happen.... it is great commercial products, 
preferably clones & supersets of what is presently in use that will be bought,
and then the circle continues as products, no longer limited by the OS
get better & better.

If you want to check us out... see below... If you don't... at least support
the concept.  I personally believe that Linux IS the next computer revolution.

Boy, how shortsighted can you possibly get?  Commercial success will not hurt
linux a bit, and may very well help it out a lot.  The point in creating art,
in making computers, and computers better is to share them with those not
as skilled.  By all means preserve the open development, and the primarily
for hackers... no problem..... but it is paychecks that allows one to eat,
and money makes the world go round...... If linux works for commercial 
entities, the hackers will have that much more reason to hack.... and see
their art enjoyed by the masses... the ultimate reward.  

You can always have compatiblity for some time, and have radical departures
in the development.... and then upgrade from 1.0 to 2.0... everyone has to
recompile or whatever to run on 2.0... so what.... if it is of a major enough
benefit.... then maybe include a compatibiity module... there is always some
one to do these compatibility things.... no one says you have to... by all
explore what you can do and hack your heart out..

Power to the people... that is what Linux is, and should stay.... and in the
process become very successful commercially as well... not in spite of what
it is, but because of what it is, By hackers, For Hackers, and also for
the underpriviledged that need a true standard that no one entity controls.

Receive - not. Send - yes, but the receiving end will see the mail
coming from the other, Internet-connected end of your term host.

You mean, software compiled with termnet? This is a bug in the termnet
library, and is being fixed (look at my WWW page if curious).

I've never tried running xfig on my linux machine at home, but I do know
that it takes 30 seconds to a minute to start on a Sun Sparc with 32 megs
and starts in less than 5 seconds on a Sparc with 64 megs of ram. It is

a memory pig and swaps like crazy starting up on the 32 meg machine. 
Granted, the OS takes up a lot more room on the Sun's, but even the CAD
and simulation packages here take up less memory to start.

You might try closing all other windows first and/or increasing swap to
get it to run. It is a nice package.

Personal opinions,
frank

I think it is a question of money. If you have enough money to install
so much RAM you probably also have enough to buy a 200meg HD to install
Linux on it. Sure, for real work you need more space, but just for
the system it would be enough.

To have enough memory for a large disk cache you need approx. 8MB,
which cost the same as a 200MB hard disk (at least here in Austria).

No, it is not. The QIC-117 (aka 'Floppy tape') driver is a KLM. And making
the floppy driver a KLM is not possible (or at least difficult):
How would you create a boot floppy without having a driver in the kernel at
