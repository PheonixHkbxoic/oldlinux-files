Agreed.

But I wanted to point out that it's OK to distribute/compile/use Sun's
small libguide.a necessary to link *some* of the DevGuide generated
code.

I know that someone announced placing a binary of the library on
sunsite some time ago, but I've never tried it.  Also, if you have
access to DevGuide on a Sun, then you should have access to the
source for libguide.a, too.

The bottom line is that although you can't run the "guide" client under
Linux, you can use the code that it generates to create an app that
will run under Linux.  Actually you can do alot with "guide" without
ever needing to link with "libguide.a" ... drag and drop is one
thing that I know of that needs the library.

Follow-ups to comp.os.linux.help, since this isn't a kernel related
development issue.

The timings I quoted were fixed versus elf libraries on a SYS5.3 end target.
There are real differences between PIC code and magic for global variables.
The libraries use few globals and things like SVGAlib already load these
into stacked variables early on because of the otherwise present performance
hit. If you can manage enough magic to get a 0% slowdown then you are one
up on most commercial vendors I've checked against (but that won't be the
first time the EYC has done that 8)) and I'm happy to accept it. There are
still a small number of programs I build static that I expect I will
continue to do this way - stuff like Crack that are already worst case tests
of the worst cases of the C library.

Bit pointless - there is sock_packet and a usermode implementation of

I don't forget that I don't add bits but kilo- or megabytes since I
don't use shared libs.  Why?  It's a hassle to create and maintain them.

You shouldn't be asking questions like this in c.o.l.d.
Or, if you do, you should asking them in the form "I was thinking about
writing a driver for xxx..."

That said, the updated LANCE driver in 1.1.50 has support for the PCnet/VLB
chip used on the Boca BEN-VL board.

I also have several minor fixes for the driver that I hope to have ready for
1.1.52.

Subject: Multiple mode problem
Date: 19 Sep 1994 22:32:07 GMT

Starting at 1.1.45 (I think) my system would hang when accessing the 
second hard drive.  I have a seagate the does support multiple block (my 
first hard drive), and a quantum that does not.  When I compiled the 
kernel with the default multiple block of 64, and access my second hard 
drive, the controller would continually reset.  This would cause me to 
reset my machine.  Control-alt-del would not work, the system was just 
continually accessing the drives but it didn't seem to be doing anything.
I changed hd.c to force the controller, when reset, to set the first drive
at 64 and the second at 0.  I could not find a way to do this except to
change part of the code.  Am I missing something about the way to activate
the multiple block, or am I just stuck with my patch.

Thanks for the help.

im not familiar enuf with this part of the kernel to even think about figuring

Subject: Kernel Goals?
Date: 18 Sep 1994 03:49:36 GMT


A few months ago the SLS author did something that (IMHO) was rather
noble and very needed. He broke the kernel up into a completely
modular system where all the drivers were external and loaded. Yes, it
was not the most elegant system, and yes, it still had some design
inconsistancies with regard to sound drivers and the DMA memory. Yes,
it still did not do a great deal to make sure that drivers from different
kernels would work togeather. However, it was a start.

There were many reasons that the "kernel gurus" did not integrate this
into the Linux kernel proper. Some of these I know.. many of these I dont.

What I want to know is: Is there some plan, or even hope, for the kernel
to get cut up at least enough to allow drivers to be separated from being
"kernel version dependent" at least as much as possible? Does someone
working on the Linux kernel "progress" want to eventually put togeather a
system of loadable drivers? I heard some rumors, that
there were plans to redo the work that the SLS author did and integrate
it into the Linux kernel in a "better" way. Is this happening? ver?

Or, is the best way for me to see this happen to follow the Linux
VIPER project? 

Why am I interested in this? Because I envision a day where Linux would 
consist of a driver set which are stable, with occasional changes,
and a small "kernel" which loads things, not necessarily in a microkernel
fashion, but at least enough to allow there to be a "Linux driver" and
not a "Linux 1.1.47 driver". 

Maybe this is in the plan and all this multiple-platform stuff is just
taking priority. 

I'm sure someone is going to tell me to go ask this on the mailing list,
and if I do not get sufficient information from this post, then I will.

You're right at least for MIPS R4x00. On 64 bit MIPS CPUs there is no difference in execution time between 32 or 64 bit code for all integer instructions (exceptions are multiply and divide instructions). However using 64 bit memory operations where 32bit would suffice may result in a performance penalty due to the cache utilisation. Even worse, some existing board designs only have a 32 bit bus from memory to the second level cache. That's just one of the reasons why Linux/MIPS is 32 bit for now. Full 64 will follow, of course.

Be warned that "AX.25" has no other relation to "X.25" than that they
both use an LAPB link layer.  The name "AX.25" was probably chosen at
a time when the designers still thought that the X.25 model would be
used.   They first implemented the link level, and the X.25 PLP was
left for later.  But is was never really implemented for use by end-users
(only one network product uses it internally).

So, AX.25 code does not buy you much when you want to have X.25...

Well mostly anyway.  It seems that every time I install something for
linux I have to make a leap of faith and draw on experience.  :) I guess
that's why it's fun? :)

It would be _nice_ if developers would put the linux revision the code
was compiled under.  I grabbed the iBCS code from September and
basically added patches to a kernel source tree re-compiling in-between
until I _thought_ I had it with 1.1.39.  Except that didn't fly either,
on up to 1.1.42 (mentioned in passing in the ChangeLog) and viola, 
insta-SCO box.

Simply Amazing.

Flawless execution of some KEY SCO programs.  I have another commercial
program that runs under Linux/iBCS not listed: BBx/4.  Great job, I owe
you a beer.

Porting shouldn't be necessary with the new termnet library. Add in
the program Makefile following definitions:

to CFLAGS -include /usr/local/lib/termnet.h  (or whereever)
to LIBS   -ltermnet -L/usr/local/lib         (     ="=    )

That should do it. Note that -include is not understood by some C
compilers (but gcc does grok it :-)

Ideally, programs compiled in this way run with and without term
and/or TCP/IP, they always take what's available.

I'm running Slackware 2.0, and i'm trying to compile a program
called xweather.  (You can get the program from ftp.pop.psu.edu,
files /pub/src/xweather.tar.Z and /pub/src/xweather.patch1)

The code runs fine on a SPARC, under both 4.1.3 and under Solaris.
Friends of mine have it working on other platforms as well.
If I compile it under Linux (running either 1.0.9 or 1.1.51), I
get a SIGFPE at an atof().  The string atof() is reading is a
valid number.  I'm using gcc 2.5.8, on a 386 with a 387.

The funny thing is that it doesn't seem to depend on which number
it's trying to convert to a float, it will bomb after a certain
number of atof()'s are called.

While I'm at it, when I compile it, I end up with a static binary.
I have the shared X libs loaded as well as the static ones.  Why
isn't a shared binary being built?

I'm looking for ATM adapters with the following characteristics:

 - 155 Mbps, fiber (OC-3)
 - for PC hardware, PCI bus
 - usable for Linux

The last point probably implies that somebody (maybe I) has to write a
device driver. Thus, the necessary specifications need to be available
and free from non-disclosures, etc.

I'd be most thankful for information on available products or imminent
releases, or possibly on people already doing work in that direction.

I'll post a summary if I get replies that aren't also posted to the
newsgroup(s).

- Werner

Subject: AHA1542A and Linux-1.1.50+ are having troubles..
Date: Wed, 21 Sep 1994 18:20:16 GMT

On System:
        - i486/33 32MB DRAM (ISA)
        - Adaptec AHA1542A + 600 MB CDC Wren-V disk

When running Linux 1.0.9 there is no trouble, however with
Linux 1.1.50 and 1.1.51 there appear spodaric data corruption
on the disk WRITES.

The corruption follows rule:
        At a 1k boundary write 8 bytes of 0xFF
        instead of the true data

Location of that error varies within a file, but it is always
on bytes   N*1k..N*1k+7

The error may appear at multiple spots of the file also.

At  changes46 (for 1.1.46)  there is a comment about slow DMAs,
and unnecesserity to be slow at all times..  Might some slowdown
be adviced in here ?

I think this same applied to Linux-1.1.18, as I have seen similar
weirdos at other aha1542a using machine...

Well, I'm responsible for the maintenance/development of our SCO serial 
drivers and the development of the Linux driver for our PC/Xe product, 
and I haven't heard anything like that yet.  Plans are to release a 
Linux driver for our PC/Xe line of products this fall.

Seems like EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) for buying
and selling, especially with the US government is 
really heating up.

Is anyone doing anything with linux for EDI??
