It seems you have limited the coredump size to 0, i.e., no core dumps will
be written. Say something like

        limit coredumpsize unlimited

to enable coredumps. The exact command depends on the shell you're using.

Calm down, Neal.... calm down.

One of Digi's employees is currently at work on a PC/Xe driver for Linux,
with release due in a month or two.  I suspect he's listening, and when
they ask him what's next, he'll say "ISDN".  :-)

Subject: mount/umount bug (/etc/mtab~)
Date: 28 Sep 1994 11:24:47 GMT

Hi there!

I suudenly came up with a problem concerning mount/umount.
When a mount fails, it leaves a file /etc/mtab~ and with
this it prevents any other mount/umount command to run at all.

As I understand this is a kind of semaphore to avoid multiple
mounts to run the same time, at least in normal use.

But when I get something like "Device Busy..." or so,
I find out that, e.g. I didn't put a floppy to the drive or a typo,
and try again, then mount fails because of /etc/mtab~.

Is this a bug or a feature?

Hi,

I've been watching these discussions about ELF vs a.out with quite a
bit of interest.  It looks, at least to me, like things will be moving
toward ELF.  Who actually decides if this happens and if so when it
happens?  What does Linus have to say about it?  If this does take
place, does this mean that EVERYTHING must be recompiled for ELF? (I
understand that both formats will be supported, but, if we're moving
to ELF then I, personally, would want to use the 'preferred' medium)
Just how big is this project going to be if its implemented?  It'd be
nice if the hard work that all the developers have done didn't have to
be recompiled or rewritten.

clock() displays the _processor time_ used by the program. This is
completely different from the real time of the system (try 'time -v ls'
or something from your prompt); try gettimeofday() for the accurate real
time...

By the way, this is a standard way of doing things, not a peculiarity
of Linux. From what I know, only MS-DOS displays the real time using
clock() (obviously since it's single-tasking...).

I'm looking on information about PCMCIA support for Linux.

I am mostly interested in network and modems,

Does anyone working on PCMCIA drivers for Linux?

=======

Second question is about S-VGA drivers, is there or will be a 'generic' 
one supported in 640x480x256? or/and the LINEAR chips set.?


This is for a AST Advantage! Explorer Notebook, I've (mostly) converted 
my notebook as a Linux ws. But until I can fully support network and 
decent video display, I'll have to keep Windog :-) around!


Please reply to me directly, (as well.)

The way I understand it, having talked with some of the people involved
second hand.  The DEC fellow has done/is doing his own port, while Linus
is working on something seperate.  However some of this information is
second hand to me so accuracy may be somewhat lacking.

Well, I think there should be an locking mechanism included (like

BTW: i would see some usermount support in /proc/mtab, by including

instructor to access a students terminal (via ethernet or the student can be

students terminal and help the student with programming or whatever
problems.  After the instructor shows the student what is wrong, the
instructor turns the terminal back over to the student.  Is there anything

Correct, Linux does not currently support a mmap() with PROT_WRITE +
MAP_SHARED. This is to be added after the release of 1.2.0, so 1.3.0
will have it definately. You can get around this by taking the file
descriptor from the mmap call and just before you would normally close
it, do a HUGE write() to the file descriptor. I had to do this to get
emacs to dump properly as an elf binary.

Hi all.

In a previous post to c.o.l.d./c.o.l.h. I wrote:

Thanks to all people who replied.

Actually I am very sure of the software installation; due to the previous
experiences, I'm used to recompile the ftape module after EVERY kernel
change. I confirm that all worked fine with the 33-MHz CPU, no matter
which compiler/library I used.

Here are the news: now ftape works also with my 66-MHz CPU.
I suspect there is some critical timing parameter on my hardware
(motherboard, chipset, RAM, FD controller?), which is exposed by the
faster CPU. You can't be sure of these cheap Taiwan boards, even if they
are officially certified for 50 MHz operation.

The quality of the crashes seemed to suggest some disruption of the
instruction flow, maybe a wrong memory read. I wonder why only the ftape
module was affected.

Now for the solution: 
After fiddling with the bus/RAM/cache parameters via the BIOS setup
with no success, I changed all references to inb() and outb() in
the file 'fdc-io.c' to inb_p() and outb_p(), so to slow down I/O
accesses via software. And this worked, at least for now.

Would someone please test this patch and see what happens? Actually
this should have no effect, but please check it and report any fault.

Subject: Smail Security Hole
Date: 28 Sep 1994 11:13:24 -0400

Someone posted modifications to the transports file so that a smail .forward
entry of /securityhole will be written using the user and group ids of
the owner of the .forward file.

This does not quite work as intended because /securityhole will still
be written even if the owner of the .forward file does not have
write permissions to the directory in question. (for instance /)

Once the file has been written, the user can then make it executable. For
instance a /bin/lc file could be created.

This is a serious security hole. Any SCO users out there? Do you find
yourself typing 'lc' instead of 'ls' much (as root)?

Any Linux system with this problem can be compromised.

A question : what are the implications of turning off smail's ability to
send mail to files? Or is that how it writes to mbox? What about the pipes
option? Can that safely be disabled?

How are you going to umount the disk if it's already been ejected? It seems
to me that this would rule out anything but read-only mounts.

Subject: SOLUTION Re: SMail security hole?
Date: 28 Sep 1994 20:37:05 -0000

Someone mailed me asking where exactly the hole should be plugged,
and I just saw an incorrect solution by Lee Silverman (no offense
intended), so here's how the file: transport should really look like:

file:   driver=appendfile, return_path,
        from, unix_from_hack, local;            # or whatever
        file=$user,
        append_as_user,                         # essential
        check_path,                             # _this_ was missing
        expand_user,
        suffix="\n",
        mode=0644,

Without check_path, smail doesn't allow you to append to files
not owned by the user (append_as_user does that), but it allows
creation of new files in inaccessible directories. The original
warning posting said that :-)

The above config works for me (smail 3.1.28).

Followups are set out of .development.

bye
  Patrick

P.S.: I still don't understand why check_path is not in the sample
configuration for the file: driver, but having it as an option
is useful since driver=appendfile can be used for other transports
(i.e. batched smtp)
