I'm fairly certain this isn't a problem related to term versions.  It
sounds like you have a hardware problem that only manifests itself
when both the modem and the video card are in high gear at the same
time.  You mentioned your attempts to change the jumpers on your 
video card.  Have you attempt to change the jumpers on your serial
port, or switching which com port you connect your modem to?

Even more fun is the difference between NULL.  Used to be, in K&R,
that NULL was defined as "0".  In ANSI, it's defined as "(void *) 0".
In C++, it's back to being "0", because "(void *) 0" can't be
automatically converted to another type in an assignment,
and thus "int *foo = NULL;" won't work with ANSI NULL, you need
"int *foo = (int *) NULL;".  Which, I think you'll agree, is ugly :)

Hi, does anyone know how to create a "boot disk" and a "root disk" as in

OK, if you really can't get the remote end to do TOS correctly,
and you want to do the TCP-port-number hack, put an appropriate
hook in the ip_forward routine in net/inet/ip.c just before it 
examines the TOS field to decide what queue to use.

Actually, what you would really like is to have a SLOW baud rate
for transmitting to the modem, and a FAST baud rate for receiving
from it.  The problem with having a FAST baud rate for transmitting
to the modem is that the Linux host can fill up the modem's 
transmit buffer rapidly, at which point the modem has a couple
seconds of data to send, so _no matter what the Linux host does_,
a new interactive packet will have to wait a couple of seconds
for delivery.

If instead you transmit to the modem more slowly, you'll never fill
up the transmit buffer (much).

On the other hand, you lose bandwidth, obviously.

I wouldn't be surprised if a 9600 baud connection to a 14.4
modem session gave the best latency results for interactive
traffic with simultaneous bulk traffic.  On the other hand,
it's slow.

Well, since Adaptec will not even release details of the lowly 2940, I do
not think they will be too pleased about doing so for the 2940w.

I really do not think that there is a lot of demand for support at the
moment.

Subject: question about the kernel
Date: Thu, 13 Oct 1994 14:35:14 GMT

Hello, folks,

I am reading the Linux kernel source code, and have some difficulty
understanding one crucial point. Usually before the a process try
to manipulate some global data structures ( like the free buffer list),
it will disallow interrupts in some critical section. But as I read the 
source for linux, I can not find where this is done, for example
in file buffer.c there is a inline function  put_last_free() which
alters a linked list, but there is no code to protect the critical
 section there. getblk() calls put_last_free(), but I can not found the
protection code in it either. 

Can someone tell me how and where the critical sections are protected?
I have spent quite some time to trace back and forth the calling
sequences and found nothing(btw, is there a program that can serach the
calling sequence?).  I would greatly appreciate your help.

   And this is the cannonical case of why c++ is NOT a true super-set of 
   ANSI c.  (Thanks, I'm going to save the exampel for the next time I have 
   THAT argument.)

That "int function();" declares a function with no arguments in C++
and an unknown number of arguments in C is far more common.
So are variables called "class" or other new reserved words.

What I'm most interested in knowing is what happened to the Ultrasound
Max *UPGRADE* for the original Gravis Ultrasound.  I am happy with the
Ultrasound (has everything the Max has except no 16-bit recording, CD-ROM
interfaces, and a couple of other things).  All I see in the stores is
this $200 thing and that, IMHO, is a ripoff as an upgrade which barely
adds anything to my current board.

However, if there is an upgrade board that is much lower than $200
then OK.
