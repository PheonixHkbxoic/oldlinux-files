Sharing an RO device like a CDROM is no problem... simply make sure the two 
host systems have different SCSI ID# (this is required anyway for two systems 
to share a SCSI Bus)... The SCSI BUS will handle arbitration between the two 
systems attempting to access the device simultaneously.

By sending LOCK (I think... or RESERVE) commands to the SCSI device before and 
after disk access, you can temporarily limit access to the device to a single 
host, so that the other system cannot seek the drive just before your read 
command. This should be a relatively minor change to the existing SCSI block 
device driver.

Sharing RW devices gets a little more difficult. DEC implemented a ClusterDisk 
scheme where access arbitration and cache invalidates were communicated between 
systems via DECNET.... If we were to use TCP/IP over SCSINET all data transfer 
and arbitration would be handled on the SCSI Bus. That would leave the task of 
deriving a new file system type that would handle the arbitration.

Hmmm... rethink that a second.... 

The preliminary SCSINET spec has an underlying protocol, TMMP (Target Mode 
Message Passing), which allows multiple protocols to share the SCSI bus by 
assigning each protocol to a different SCSI LUN. Using TMMP instead of TCPIP to 
handle arbitration between systems sharing a device would eliminate the TCPIP 
overhead from the arbitration process... mucho faster....

Are we on the verge of a new shared file system standard here ??? Hmmm....

It appears that there is going to be a dedicated Mailing List for SCSINET and 
TMMP... details and net addresses as soon as the server is up and running!!!

Who the hack told you that 46 was the correct major device number?
Try 9 instead, and it should work. 

BTW: the official lists of device-numbers can be found in:

This is official because its the one that the kernel incorporates during
compilation...

        I tested the creation of a new file at the same time as I tested
trying to overwrite /etc/passwd and creation didn't work on my system

card.  I trust him to be competent enough to read the model number off
the card, but I haven't heard anything about it, and it isn't

I think there is a hardware problem in the ethernet card that causes
it to be incompatible with busmastering controllers.

This has been mentioned some times before, but I don't exactly remember
which version of the card fixed it.

The point probably is that bridging is practical to be implemented on
dedicated hardware (possibly with some microcode), while routing usually
isn't.   So, a dedicated bridge could be faster than a router.

Of course, this no longer holds once you build your bridge using two
normal ethernet cards and a PC.  In that case, the disadvantage of having
to look at all packets becomes the deciding factor.

Please read the Linux FAQ.  Also, please post questions to
comp.os.linux.help, where they belong.

Question 6.14.  How can I produce core files ?

Since 0.99pl14 Linux has had corefiles turned off by default for all
processes.  You can turn them on by using the ulimit command in bash, or
the limit command in tcsh.  See the manpages or Q6.15 `How do I stop
producing core files ?' for more details.

After executing that command all programs run from that shell (directly or
indirectly) will be able to dump core.

If you wish to enable coredumping for all processes by default you can
change the default setting in <linux/sched.h> - see the definition of
INIT_TASK.

I was wondering in the standard linux develpment packages implemented
a semaphore synchronization call.  If not, how do you synchronize two 
processes to keep them from entering their critical sections at the same
time?

I haven't installed or used linux yet, but I am going to try soon and would
like to know what kind of system calls are available.  I have several 
unix programs that use the semaphore method and I would like to just be
able to transfer them to linux and compile them.

Quite true, and the same used to apply to bytes. Nowadays, a byte is

While this is in the concept stage I might as well propose a time-saving step. 
How about adding multi-processor support to hurd.  By the time the
multi-processor support is ready, one could reasonably assume that hurd would
have the linux server ready.



Actually i see a assumption with my own plan, that might not be true.  If we
run linux as a server under mach in hurd, and we add multi-processor support to
hurd, does that mean that linux would be multi-processor?  i'm assuming so.

If what I've experienced is the same to yours, you can just patch the
Buslogic driver to make it return 'translation off' instead of on.
Actually, OFF was the default when the driver was introduced into the
kernel, but somewhere around 1.1.46 it changed, and I remember it
breaking LILO on my system (I have a Micropolis 1.7G but the boot
partition is on < 1G).

If you're interested I can dig out the patch for you.  But you seem to
have already found it, no?  It's just a one-line change.

Huh?  My BT445S system looks like this:

Memory: 14900k/16384k available (652k kernel code, 384k reserved, 448k data)

How's that?

Well, "word" doesn't have an exact quantitative meaning -- it just
means some number of bytes.  It's often used to mean the number of
bytes that it's most "natural" to work with on a particular computer
(ie. 4 bytes on a 32 bit computer, 8 bytes on a 64 bit computer, etc).
It *can* mean *any* number of bytes.  My bet is that the number the
original poster wants is 4.

Since the original 8086 was 16-bit, Intel decided to call 2 bytes a
word.  A lot of people took this convention as a definition, and now
think all words are 2 bytes.

So:

In the most general case, a word is a collection of bytes.

One convention widely used in general is that a word is the most
natural number of bytes for a particular CPU to use.

One convention used among people who use Intel chips exclusively is
that a word is 2 bytes (regardless of processor).
