I have no C/C++ needs that gcc and friends don't satisfy.  I can't imagine
a commercial product successfully competing there; anyway I wouldn't pay
more than pocket change for one.

For f77, f2c is marginal, and g77 isn't yet out of beta.  However, I
don't do new code in f77 any more.  I might pay a little for an f77
compiler on Linux, but not enough to make it worth your while.  Say <$100.

Hpf is built on f90.  I'm not personally interested in the HPF extensions,
but if your HPF would include a *full* f90 for Linux, then I'd definitely be
interested (say to the tune of $500-$1000).  Subsets need not apply.

I've always thought that C should have some way
of letting you decided how many bytes to use
for your computation.  It could be as simple as
having the types

int8   ( = char )
int16  ( = short )
int24
int32  ( = int )
...

up to some reasonable value like
int128.  Of course, other syntatic sugar
would probably be necessary, but the idea
*appears* simple enough.

As we move to 64bit chips and beyond, it seems
like this will become very desirable.

You are not alone, Carlos. I've been having troubles with an S3 card. At

You can choose: either consider initial, medial and final qof to be
three distinct letters (in which case the kernel, properly instructed
using loadkeys and setfont, will display them correctly for you),
or consider them to be one letter, and have a process between the kernel
and your application, that handles input and output.
Similarly, one has these possibilities in Greek (for final and non-final
sigma) and in English (for capitalization and fi,fl ligatures).

The example of English shows that one may leave the choice between
a and A to the user. It is easy to make a program that will be right
about capitalization most of the time, but impossible to make a program
that is always correct. 
It also shows that there are details that only matter in high quality
printing.

It is the same with Arabic. No doubt it will be easiest if you indicate
yourself which form of the letter you want, but teaching emacs to do
the choosing for you should not be too difficult either.
That special glyphs exists for certain combinations of letters only
matters in high quality printing.
I think I once showed you in private mail how easy it is to produce
Arabic with TeX.

Anyway, none of this concerns the kernel, with the possible exception
of the directionality of the text.

There is only one natural order, and that is the time order.
What is said first is stored first.
The order on a storage medium has nothing to do with the appearance

Unicode includes symbols for direction change. That suffices for most
purposes. For specialized cases you need special programs.

Plan 9 made a different choice, but I found that very few applications
need to know how many bytes there are in a symbol. That is, recoding
these programs to make them use "runes" is usually unnecessary.
(However, columns are often messed up, and strlen() has to be replaced.)
Unicode in UTF-8 encoding yields symbols encoded with a variable number
of bytes, but most programs only copy text strings, or parse them into
identifiers etc., and since ASCII is embedded as a collection of symbols
each represented by a single byte, this does not pose any problems.

So, internal representation is no problem. Input is easy enough with
some version of loadkeys when the alphabet is small, and requires a
separate daemon when the alphabet is large, or when your input is not
easily converted to the internal representation. 

Output is difficult. The precise rules are complicated, and fonts take
a lot of space. The console driver can only handle the very simplest
cases.

Date: 9 Sep 1994 00:16:25 GMT

Good comments about moving away from the "one file=one article" scheme of
C-News/INN deleted.....

Just an observation:

As an admin that ran both a "notes" site and 2 B-news/C-news/INN sites
for the last 4-5 years, I sure like the convenience of having the 
old clunky flat text files. 

Notes may not be a good example to use, but it had a database type
approach similar to our current history approach. (index file and a
single data file) for each group.

There were advantages (fewer inode problems, maybe it was faster, who
knows) but on a regular basis a "bad" (malformed, etc) article would trash 
a group database. There were no recovery tools, and you would usually 
lose the entire group. Heaven forbid a system failure.

The same is true of WinNet, a Windoze uucp based new/mail app. It is
actually a pretty usable reader, in fact. But it also uses a database, and 
a reboot/power failure, GP fault, whatever while processing articles 
will often trash the DB.

I think the modern news systems could avoid most of the the defects in
the notes and WinNet approach. (just a small matter of programing) :-)

But, I really like being able to do "brute force" emergency admin of my 
spool dir using OS cmds and other tools. (find, reap, even rm -rf soc/* on 
a bad day)

The convenience of the current approach make it worth enduring the performance
and space hits. A new design would have to be faster, compress 2-3X, and 
totally compatible with INN to get my interest. Even then I would think hard.
800 Mb of files under 1k is not pretty. NOV makes it endurable. But it
works, and I rarely have to "fix" the article base.
 
Someone else wrote:

I do agree with Ian here. Make it general enough, like the real DB's do
on unix. You can write to a raw partition, or to a file, depending on
your preferences. Unix does not care. Individual OS's often have
restrictions that make one approach preferable. An example:

        HP-UX 8.0- Max raw partition 2Gb, Max individual file size was 
        2Gb less FS overhead. 
        
        HP-UX 9.0x- Max raw partition is still 2Gb, but with LVM
        (logical volumes) you could easily have a logical volume of 4Gb
        or more. (In or out of a filesystem) You can have a bigger file
        than you can have a raw partition. (due to lseek limitations)

With the general approach like "real DB's", you pick what is best for
your site. At least we do not (usually) have to worry about backup and
restore of article bases. This adds another layer. (Just another tool that 
would be needed)

Someone else wrote:

>I hate to disagree, but doing it through the kernel gains you portability.

I really disagree here. I have never seen an instance when moving a
function from user space to the kernel made it more portable. Usually
the opposite occurs. This is how we ended up with Streams, etc. (To
avoid driver writing) Stick with things you can implement with POSIX
type generic calls. (Good luck on your project, though :-> )

But do not let me persuade anyone from writing the next generation
system. (Or even an enhancement) If it were not for the Rich Salz's and
Henry Spencer's, I would still be stuck using (and repairing) Notes! :-)

Subject: Hangs with 1.1.49 ?
Date: 08 Sep 1994 15:25:41 GMT

I'm having problems where my linux box hangs when doing any significant
network access, such as compiling or running X applications (I've got
/usr remote mounted using NFS).

When the system hangs there aren't any debug messages, the system
just stops dead.  This didn't used to happen when running 1.0.9.
Unfortunately I can't stay running 1.0.9 since the precompiled
version on the Slackware 2.0 distribution doesn't contain the
devices I need, and if I build 1.0.9 myself it hangs when trying
to detect my NE2000 ethernet card.

I've posted this to the development group because it seems to be
a problem with the new kernel.

Thanks,

Ray.

Well, the easiest way to compile such a dictionary, I would think, is to do 
like Webster's does--steal the top 50,000 from the front page of the 
Times.  Of course, *we* keep stats on word frequency in all the groups for 
about...  a week?  Whatever news admins feel is a good amount of 
time...

But, not on *my* system!  :)

But there has to be a mechanism for telling the loader where to find
libraries.  IMHO the mistake is in letting ld see the variable and
use the value.  It would be consistent to have LD_LIBRARY_PATH be
strictly runtime.  The downside is (2), but there's got to be some
pain :-) doesn't there?

Removable disks are already supported.  Just unmount the disk, swap
the cartridge and mount the new one.

Ahaaaa!  You want to swap cartridges without unmounting.
That cannot be done.  The system *has* to be informed about removing
the cartridge before you actually do it.  It has to write back information,
and return the state of the filesystem to "clean".
Linux is not DOS!

However, if there is some signal from the drive that you press the
button to unmount the disk, the unmount operation maybe could be done
automatically.  I don't know if this Syquest model supports "door locking"
and has motor-driven eject, but if it does this could be possible.

(drives with door locking are locked as long as the disk is mounted, so
that you cannot swap the disk without first unmounting it.  This is
intentional)

Currently yes, since we only have this one (besides the MIPS Magnum 4000
on which I am writing this article...). However, it shouldn't be a problem 
to port Linux/MIPS to other ARC (Advanced Risc Computer, a specification of MIPS, Microsoft and a lot of other companies) compliant boards, since they 
all have ISA, EISA, VLB or PCI bus systems.
That means: if your MIPS board runs Windoze NT, it will probably run 
Linux/MIPS too, perhaps after *slightly* patching the kernel. There
might be some differences in the address maps and how DMA is handled.

The major problem is that these old DECstations have R3000 processors.
There are some differences in the MMUs and in the instructions set of 
the R3xxx and R4xxx which will make a R3xxx port a bit more complicated. 
Another thing is that DECstations don't have an ISA (or similar "industry standard") bus. Most drivers must be rewritten to the specific I/O subsystem these boxes have. 
However, the R3xxx and R4xxx processors are similar enough to take
advantage of our port. It should be at least possible to provide
user-mode binary compatibility between R3xxx and R4xxx boxes - and this
would help a lot ! BTW, this is what MIPS has done anyway - the stuff
I write on my MIPS 4030 runs perfectly on our MIPS 3330 and vice versa.
It will also help that our Mips Port is native little-endian, just like 
your PC and your DECstation.

We already received several questions what's about DECstations 
while others prefer to wait for the ultraP (a module which holds
both a Pentium and a R4x00 and lets you choose which CPU to use)
or whatever will come along.
I guess there will be a lot of MIPS board running Linux/MIPS in
near future - we just need a little help since we can't buy all
of them !
