The problem is a bit more fundamental than that!  The WNOS NNTP server 
seems incapable of dealing with some basic requests.  I cant remember 
exactly the commands but it revolved around WNOS not taking any notice of 
parameters to command like HEAD, TAIL, BODY etc......

I don't think its the NNTP extensions that are the problem (but I may be 
wrong!)

Subject: Need a hand from C programmer... Please?
Date: Fri, 16 Sep 1994 16:53:16 GMT

Hi. I need a bit of help from somebody with C (and Kernel) experience.
For the last 3 months I have been trying to fix a serious (for me) problem 
with a tiny wee program called "sliplogin". The program is used here for a 
multiline dial-in server.  It works fine, *except* that it sometimes does not 
*kill* itself after the dial-in user has disconnected. This especially seems 
to happen when there is still traffic going over the SLIP line.  The problem 
is, that the sliplogin program 'hangs' in the " close(0) " function.

That part of the source looks like this:

system(.....);  execute the slip.logout script; This takes the Route/ Arp out.
close(0);  The program does sometimes *not return* from this function!
exit(1); This kills the program, but is often not reached!

Now I have been told that the close(0) function is not properly implemented in 
Linux. It does not flush the buffers, but only waits 60 seconds before it 
returns. I don't know if this is true, but what I would like to do, is 
manually *flush* all data in the buffers, send reset commands to all open 
TCP/IP connections, and *then* close the port.  Is this possible? Or is there 
an other way to solve this problem?

If you can help me, please reply by E-Mail, and I will send you the complete 
source (which is only 300 lines).  

This is very important to me, because every time it happens, the dial-in line 
does not answer anymore, and if it is the 'master' line, due to the Telecom 
Stepping system, my entire Internet Server is down until I mannualy KILL the 
hanging Sliplogin program.

If you can do anything to help me, please do!

Greetings, Bart.

What is the status of the project to support Token Ring NICs?  Is this 
progressing?  We have just loaded up Linux and are *VERY* impressed but our
LAN is strictly Token-Ring.  We would be very glad to participate in this
effort as a beta test site--i.e., volunteer--aaaaaghhh!  :-).  Seriously,
if test sites are needed, we are more than willing to help out.

Our network has approximately 300 nodes, running IPX and TCP/IP with an 
Internet connection (if that's not obvious) via a Livingston router and
several wide-area network connections via Wellfleet routers.  We can 
probably give the driver a fairly good stress test.  If interested, please
E-Mail me at toddt@phelpsd.com

Vendors are used to this. Most are very good. We had numerous no longer
works with windows 3.1 software (and a load of networking stuff win 3.11
really took out). Most vendors seem to expect this and were helpful, others
were not 8). I don't see it as a Linux problem.

On stability. Except for a few bugs that were faults in the program
concerned (old route etc) everything I have from Slackware 1.1 runs
faultlessly under libc4.5.26, most claims to be relative to libc 4.1. I
did some tests with even older incompatible stuff using libc2.2.2 and those
when libc2.2.2 is still installed also work fine.

That to mean says stable enough to work with. There is one counter example
which is the massive changes to the C++ libraries, which coupled with the
fact that g++ 2.5.8 is a bit of a bug hazard broke  the parc place stuff
as Warner Losh has explained.

I suppose that the monitor hardware detects the undisplayable refresh

Sorry, this is bogus, you are wrong.

The 68000 and 68008 both have a 32 bit ALU.

The extra 4 cycles (on the 68000) come when loading 32-bit values
from memory, where the cost is 4 cycles per 16-bit word loaded.
I assume on a 68008 the cost would be an extra 8 cycles.

Thus: a 32-bit register->register add is just as fast as a 16-bit one.
But a 32-bit memory->register or immediate->register is 4 (or 8)
cycles slower.

Why the heck are we talking about this in comp.os.linux?

Just a clarification:
        I said "spinlock".  
        Scott said "no can't be".  
        Local SunOS expert said "mutex", 
        so I silently changed it to "mutex" in my second post.

Actually I think that a mutex is anything that guarantees mutual
exclusion.  So a spinlock which busy waits, and a semaphore which
queues processes are both mutexes.  Thats my definition anyway, until
I find a better one :-)

I think 4.1.3 actually uses a spinlock, but I could be wrong.

Cheers,
        Hugh

This depends on what clocks your card has.  It would help

In general Mike, I agreed with you.  it is not true, necessarily, though
that DOs software doesn't get ported to Unices (pl. of Unix?  neat!).
I have a terrific version of MS-WORD for SCO.  My copy is a little old, 
and i don't know if there are newer version, but it still has alot to 
recommend it.  It runs off of curses so any dial in user can use it, runs 
multi-user no problem, talks to the Unix print queue nicely, and otherwise 
is an almost exact replica of the same vintage OS version.

Its a terrific product, and I intend to install it on my new Linux system 
after IBCS becomes stable.

This tends to mean either each transaction has to already know the
results of its queries, or it has to lock more stuff than necessary.
Optimistic strategies with deadlock detection give better concurrency
in most situations.

This is true only if you accept the idea that an IDE "controller" is 
actually embedded in the drive electronics. The data bus between the 
controller and the bus adapter is 8 bits wide. In the case of the common 
inexpensive devices, the bus adapter is just that, a bus buffering and 
level translation device.

Many IDE adapters support only 8-bit ISA bus transfers, but more expensive 
ones use 16 and 32 bit bus transfers. Some even have logic to support 
multiblock transfers or caching to enhance performance.

SCSI can do much better than IDE on multidisk operations because it can 
issue commands to multiple disks for concurrent execution. IDE only allows 
one drive to be active at a time.
