One thing you can to do is the join the GCC channel. The pentium
support is on the way. If there is a big demand, there will be a
pentium binary snapshot along with the x86 version. But you have to
have lots of disk spaces since you have to keep the older versions
around in case of the newer one doesn't work, which is always true.
Currently I have 4 different versions of gcc on my notebook. Also
the new snapshot is made every week. You may have to ftp about 2 MB
bytes of gzipped files every week. The installation should be the same
as my public gcc binary release.

answer for this question:

What chip does that board use?   If it's an AMD 79C97* chip, it's good news.
A DEC 21040 might eventually be supported as well.

The updated LANCE driver (probably in 1.1.50) works around a minor bug (1) in
the PCnet32 implementation, and doesn't allocate a DMA channel for PCI and
VL boards with native bus mastering.  I've tested the new driver on the VL
bus version, but the PCI version should now work as well (3).

I'm writing a PCnet32 driver to use the VL and PCI chips in 32 bit
addressing mode, but I don't expect the performance gain will be significant
with 10Mbs networks and <=16M machines.  The major advantage might be that
the PCnet32 driver will be processor independent.

If I get a DEC ethernet board, I might also do a driver for the PCI 21040.
That driver will also be processor independent.

(1) FYI, the PCnet32 bug is that the Rx buffer size in the RMD is cleared,
despite the documentation clearly stating that it's left untouched.  The
symptom is that the only one ring - 16 packets - can be received before the
chip runs out of the Rx resources.  The trivial work-around is to always
rewrite the buffer size entry when clearing out the buffer.

(2) Boca 10baseT boards using the AMD79C965 chip are only $70-$90!  We
bought ours from Aurora, but CMO lists them for $67. Both advertise in
Computer Shopper.  I expect the PCI boards to be the same or only slightly
more expensive.

(3)  Frank Koeck <koeck@goofy.mpi-hd.mpg.de> reported that the PCI boards
did work for 16 packets with the old driver.  The work-around described above
should fix the problem.

I think we're all missing the point.  Firstly, nobody will complain if somebody
goes to the trouble and effort to create all these GUS and things for Linux.
It would be good, because, as many have said, it will give Linux a wider
appeal.  If you don't want these things, then don't install them.

The deeper issue is that Linux is free.  If I am correct in my analysis, nobody
out there who is developing programs for nothing is doing so as a sort of
charity.  They are producing what they see as a quality product, and are
sharing it with others, firstly, because they hope that others will do the
same, and we would thereby all benefit, and, secondly, because they are proud
of their craftsmanship.  IBM, Microsoft, etc. all ask themselves the following
questions.  What do the customers want?  What are their applications?  How well
educated are they when it comes to computers?  What is the most aggressive
marketing strategy? 

Once freed of the commercial considerations, though, people ask quite different
questions.  What do I think is a good user interface?  What do I think would be
the most desirable features for the program?  These people are all expert
computer programmers, so what they invariably think is good is a product that
is very functional, and, with a minimal number of key strokes, can achieve
great power.  In short, IBM, Microsoft, Apple, etc.  will find that they are
catering for people who know nothing about computers, so that their main
objective is to lead the user by the nose.  (And either I am just not on their
wavelength, or else they are all doing a very bad job of producing an
intuitively easy to use user interface.)  Producers of free software often
even earn their money by producing GUIs for special applications under Windows,
and, in their free time, produce something that they think is the way the thing
aught to be done.  It is unlikely that they will then go and replicate the
style they're paid at work to produce in their free time at home.

The consequence is that, unless somebody pays programmers to produce these
GUIs, I very much doubt that we shall see many of them with Linux.  This is
sad, but I think the reality.  Linux is ideal in the academic world as it
supplies many of us with all we need and want (except powerful hardware), but I
think it is very unlikely that it will make any inroads into commercial
offices.  Besides, being your own system administrator with Linux alone sets a
prerequisite to the use of Linux that precludes a very large number of PC
owners from using Linux.

That also begs the question of whether or not your message was

In the same vein, I would like to publically thank Mark Lord (I'm guessing
he's the right person) for the IDE performance improvement code.  Combined
with the bdflush (another advance), it's made a major improvement in IDE I/O
bandwidth. 

As many of you know, my current project is "Beowulf Linux clusters".  This
is a project to put together a off-the-shelf hardware specification and
software distribution to do very cost effective distributed computing.  Last
week the hardware arrived for the first full development cluster of 16
machines.  As part of the assembly/test process I configured a master disk, and
started duplicating the whole 528M disk to the other 15 disks.  Finding this
an excellent opportunity to do something interesting, I started measuring the
peformance and changing the parameters.

The first attempt was using a stock 1.0.9 kernel.  I tried many different
disk copy method, including:
        cp /dev/hda /dev/hdb
        dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdb bs=<various>
        cat /dev/hda > /dev/hdb
Almost independently of the method, the full disk copy took about 37
minutes. I settled on using the most obvious method,
'time cp /dev/hda /dev/hdb', for the rest of the tests.

Next I tried the latest development kernel, 1.1.49.  This kernel includes
the IDE performance patches, and uses the 'bdflush' continuous-buffer-flush
code.

The first test amazed me -- an stock kernel, with the default parameters,
completed a disk-to-disk copy in just under ten minutes, 9:54 to be exact.
By using the 'hdparm' program I was able to tune the copy to the fastest
time of 6:10 before I ran out of disks to copy.  The largest benefit came
(predictably) from increasing the read-ahead size from 16 sectors to 64. A
smaller improvement came from enabling multiple sector mode, and turning on
interrupts made no significant difference in the performance.

The bottom line is that for this task the new kernel is 3.5 times to 6x
(when tuned) faster than the old.  I think this is a significant difference.

BTW, these numbers were measured on a 100Mhz DX4 system with a SiS '471
chipset, all memory and cache parameters set to their fastest values, and
the VL bus set for one wait state.  The IDE controller was a DTC brand VLB
multi-I/O card jumpered for the fastest transfer rate, "8.3MB".  The disk
was a Maxtor 528MB IDE drive ("540M" advertised), and both disks were on the
same controller.

p-90, 16 MB ram, 512k L2, stealh 64 2MB, 1GB scsi, 17 mag MX (sony tube), 
        ethernet for $4000
 
I'd have to add a ccd camera $500 (guess) or so, OS (linux), and 16 MB ram 
$500.  $100 for sound.
 
So we are at $5,000.  with about specint 90 spec fp 72.  The low end
indies (i.e. with 1 GB under $7,000 are in the specint 34-60 range.)
 
:  2) Pentium systems in general:
:     a) have lower resolution/slower video hardware
 
Above can do >= 1280x1024
 
:     b) have smaller hard disks
 
Has 1.0 GB
 
:     c) have less RAM
 
Maybe... $500 to go from 16 MB to 32.
 
: Configure a Pentium system which is identical to an SGI
: Indy and they will have very similar price/performance,
: even though the Pentium PROCESSOR is more expensive
: than the MIPS processor.
 
Which indy can patch 100 specint like the pent 100?
 
: Note that, at the price shown, the PC will not do full motion video or
: capture images, nor will it be as fast overall as the SGI.
 
Why not as fast?  Indy does over 230k xstones, gets better specs int/fp?

Depends on the shell.  I use ksh under dos, and if I type "copy
main.*" ("copy" is aliased to "cp") I'm screwed just like on a Unix
system.

The fact that command.com is too dim to expand wildcards before
passing parameters to a program isn't really relevant to the undelete
issue.

If you don't like they way the "cp" "rm" or shell programs work,
(under DOS, Unix, Linux, VMS/DECshell, Ultrix, whatever) then don't
use them -- find or write something else.  It's not a kernel problem.

There are many thousands and millions of things I can type under DOS
and/or Unix to screw myself over.  There's no way the system can
prevent you from ever hurting yourself. If you've got enough rope to
do useful work, you've got enough rope to hang yourself.

NetWare isn't really DOS based. The OS that runs on the servers is a
completely different OS. It has a weird history, because it dates back
to the days of DOS 1, and has many hacks to support DOS oddities. But deep
down it is more like UNIX than like DOS.

But NetWare clients for many OS-es exists, and it should be possible to
make one for linux just as well.

To do admin you need a client that allows access to the bindery, the
queues, and all other 'non filesystem' features of NetWare. Native DOS
doesn't support this either, it's the programs such as syscon and pconsole
that 'speak' this part of the protocol. Again, it is possible to support
this protocol under linux.

It is an horrible amount of work, especially to support all possible
generations of NetWare.

Well, two keystrokes and this thread vanished in my kill file.

My apologies to Robert. It is not his post, but the totality of posts
that upset me. After 60 odd posts without any content it is just enuff ;-)
