        If your version of smail is writing files as root then you
have smail configured incorrectly, and should fix it IMMEDIATELY.  If
user xxx has a .forward file that sends output to a file, then smail
should write to that file as user xxx.  In order to make sure that
this is true, make sure your /usr/lib/smail/transports file has these
entry:

# pipe - deliver mail to shell commands
#
# This is used implicitly when smail encounters addresses which begin with
# a vertical bar character, such as "|/usr/lib/news/recnews talk.bizarre".
# The vertical bar is removed from the address before being given to the
# transport.
pipe:   driver = pipe,                  # pipe message to another program
        return_path, -local, from, -unix_from_hack;

        cmd = "/bin/sh -c $user",       # use Bourne shell to execute
        parent_env,                     # environment info from parent addr
        user=nobody,
        group=mail,
        -pipe_as_user,                  # not user-id associated with address
        umask=0022,
        log_output,                     # do not log stdout/stderr
        ignore_status,                  # exit status may be bogus, ignore it
        ignore_write_errors,            # ignore broken pipes

# file - deliver mail to files
#
# This is used implicitly when smail encounters addresses which begin with
# a slash or squiggle character, such as "/usr/info/list_messages" or
# perhaps "~/Mail/inbox".
file:   driver = appendfile,
        return_path, local, -from, unix_from_hack;

        file = $user,                   # file is taken from address
        append_as_user,                 # use user-id associated with address
        expand_user,                    # expand ~ and $ within address
        suffix = "\n",
        mode = 0644,


With the drivers set up this way, mail written to a file is written as
user xxx, but mail sent to a pipe is sent as user nobody.  It's a
little bit more secure that way.

Date: 28 Sep 1994 06:58:40 GMT

HI Folks !

At the last linux-meeting in paderborn, germany, we established a server
with the following configuration :

  486DX2/66 PCI  24MB Ram (Elitegroup-board)
  Onboard NCR
  NE2000 Network-Card
  2 x 1GB ST31200N SCSI-HD

After about 20 Minutes of NFS-Serving, this server dies without message.
The HD-LED was not on, nothing goes.

Now i'm looking for the cause of the fault. Is it the network-code or
the ncr-code ?

Any suggestions or similar behaviour ?

I have been working on getting the 1542CF working.  So far, it works
good for occasional use.  However, when I do somthing like
cp /dev/full /usr2 (where my SCSI drive is mounted), I get about
20-25 error messages over the course of the hard drive filling up
that say "interrupt received, but no mail found" or somthing like
that.  I've had a lot of problems with the 1.1.51 kernel, and much
less with the 1.1.50 kernel.  In fact, the 1.1.51 kernel won't
even boot.  I can't figure out why there should be any problems,
because none of the 1542 source code was changed.

This is with 1.1.51:

The SCSI devices are at location #0, #6, and #7 (the controller).  
Anyone know the problem?

Right now I am running principally off of an IDE hard drive, with
nothing really on my 2 SCSI drives.  I still don't feel confortable
with the performance under Linux.  I just made some changes today,
including adding a terminator to the SCSI bus, but it doesn't
seem to have made any difference. 

Take care,

Good question.  More delving into the Crynwr (Assembler!) source should 
turn up the answer.  I do know that the memory address range for the NIC 
is configured with the PS/2 "Reference Disk".  I have it setup for 16KB 
access from C8000-CBFFF, and 8KB ROM from CC000-CDFFF.  It seems that the 
Linux SMC and WD drivers have yet to put it there...

>Please include the exact message -- is that the Tx status register or the

I am pretty sure it was the TX register.  I will nab the message out of 
the syslog/debug files tomorrow, and post it here.

Glad to hear that.  Further delving into the Crynwr driver shows that it 
has code to read one of the NIC registers, which has a bit indicating 
that it is on an MCA machine.  The Crynwr code then proceeds to program a 
bit in configuration register 5 (0x04 I think) that somehow enables NIC 
interrupts onto the MCA bus.  Without doing so, the MCA bus will 
apparently not see IRQ's from the board.

>Is the ethernet address correctly detected?

Unsure.

>Are you receiving any packets at all?  Even errors?  Check /proc/net/dev.

No packets are seen at all to date.  However, I am going to switch from 
the 1.0.9 kernel to 1.1.xx tomorrow, and start over with this 
debugging.  I have *tried* defining EI_DEBUG to > 2, but do not see any 
messages in /var/adm/syslog or debug...

>What addresses can the board end up at?

The usual - C0000, CC000, D0000, etc.  IT is configured through PS/2 setup.

Well, I have a 1.7gig Maxtor on a Buslogic 445S, and I had problems when I
went from using the Adaptec 1542 driver (which didn't want translation) to
the Buslogic (which did).

What I ended up with was two partitions which overlapped, and when my 1 gig
news partition filled up to my swap space, all hell broke loose.  So, I
turned on translation, re-partitioned, and re-formatted the drive.

But the other system, also running a 445S, but with only a 1 gig drive
didn't have any problems when I switched from one to the other.

In hindsight, I should have formatted the 1.7gig initially with extended
translation on, and then I wouldn't have had any of these problems.

Oh, well...

Dan.

So, share it.  (I do understand that's what shared libraries are for.)
The library image is loaded and relocated so that it exists at a
single virtual address, and it's the same virtual address for all
programs that link with it (as is currently the case).  The difference
is that the load address was chosen at load time, not at link time.

It would require one of the SCSI ends to be a target, and many chips can do
this.  Then you could implement a messaging get/put protocol (there is one
in the SCSI 2 spec).  Then you would have to create a media driver that
the inet drivers could talk to (like ethernet or ppp).

In short, it is doable, but would need a lot of parts fabricated.

Hello everybody,

I just received my P90/Intel Premiere Motherboard, before I had a 486 with
no problem at all.  I first switch the motherboards and Linux did not
want to boot (1.1.51).  It says: hda: read_intr: status = 0x59 and the
error = 0x10.  It was saying this when it was ready to mount the partitions.

So, since I have 2 drives, I made a bootable partition on tmy second drive,
and now it is working properly.

The question is: Why was it working fine with my 486 and I get this error with 
                 my p90?  

I am using 1.1.41 now...with the same problem!

I encontered the same type of symptom on my ThinkPad-750 + I/O expansion
box which contains almost TMC-950 compatible SCSI adapter.
I inserted "#define DEBUG" at the top of seagate.c. It generated many
messages to syslog (into /usr/adm/messages), but worked well.
It was also important that "#define DEBUG" was inserted BEFORE
"#include <linux/sched.h>". sched.h contains some "#ifdef DEBUG"
codes. I don't know why it was essential.

One more point. There is a blacklist checking in scsc.c.
If the card is listed in the backlist, scsi.c does not poll for
lun != 0.

Does this help you ?
