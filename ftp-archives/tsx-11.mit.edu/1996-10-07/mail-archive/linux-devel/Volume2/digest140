The entry level Indy used to be an R4000PC, not R4400. The difference is big..
We have both the Indy 4000PC and the 4600 version on site here.
The 4600 is really nice and fast.
I'm considering a R4600 board for a PC box, although the CPU alone is not enough 
to get a well balanced system w.r.t. performance.

Wrong. Windows NT will take advantage of multi-processors and does it

 "...not much of an OS.."

Ho-hum. It's actually an extremely good OS. I've been using it for 3 months 
now and have been toying with the idea of making space on my Linux box for
it. The NT kernel (executive) provides features similiar to the Linux kernel,
there are differences especially in the way NT is hardware independant, 
is fully multip-threaded and can handle SMP. Features which I think the Linux
kernel would benefit from.

So the frontend to NT is basically the 3.1 API but so what. It actually works
under the NT kernel! You can get used to it.

It has to be said that Linux is a very good OS, but there is little need to
flame something just because it comes from Microsoft. Be open minded about
such things :-)

Subject: Mach64 XServer 90MHz limitation
Date: 8 Sep 1994 15:24:37 -0400

I am currently playing with "alpha" driver for the ATI
Mach64 chipset XServer posted on sunsite.unc.edu. 

The configured clocks for that chipset goes up to 135Mhz
(or thereabout) but the server does not like seeing any
clock set above 90Mhz.

I have tried rebuilding the server ( XFree_SVGA using
the alpha ATI driver.c ) after changing the include
file x386.h def for the default max clock rate to
150000 (150Mhz) and remade all files. However the
rebuilt Server still complains if I specify a clock
over 90MHz.

This is proving to be a real nuisance as my ATI
card needs a 100Mhz clock to do the resolutions
above 1024x768 at acceptable (70Hz) refresh rates.


Does anybody know if there are other parts of the
server that needs to be patched to overcome this
90MHz clock limit?

Thanks.

  Weng.

No, err, the point actually was that Linux is getting so large it is
becoming unhandy : 1.66 megabytes doesn't even fit on one floppy anymore !
Cut the bull and throw away all but the most necessary drivers, let the
owners get their drivers off the net if they want !  It's okay to put
all the drivers into the distributions, but I don't want them when I upgrade
my kernel.  Most kernel work isn't kernel but driver work these days.

And I'm not proposing holy wars against Intel architecture, I just said that
Linux is perhaps a bit too depending on it.  I know that to build an OS that
runs on a lot of different architectures (with or without recompiling), you
have got to write a new OS and put Linux on top, so forget about that for
a moment.  But all those drivers ...  I don't want to spend 6 megabytes of
my hard disk for just the sources of yet another cdrom or scsi or ethernet
device.

Have you tried using dosemu0.53 (the latest version is pre53_18) which
includes support for NOVELL lan, so try it.

BTW, if you don't know dosemu is a DOS emulator for linux which is very
efficient and almost the same as the real DOS.

I had this too until 1.1.47 (I believe) then it got fixed - I have

Well, I think that porting the C/C++ would be fruitless with Gnu.  The 
FORTRAN, while not useful to me, would probably be found useful by some.  
There is the f2c program, but I think a native FORTRAN compiler would be

A GUI debugger would be nice.  xxgdb is a pain, and UPS, while better, ain't
