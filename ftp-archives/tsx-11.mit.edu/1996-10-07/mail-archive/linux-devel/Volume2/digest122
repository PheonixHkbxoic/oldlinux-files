I wrote a patch for mounting PhotoCD's with all sessions. Works fine for my
NEC (SCSI too). Useful only if you can read the first session without
problems. Try
  http://www.cs.tu-berlin/~kraxel/linux/index.e.html
to get it (german users can use index.html). Or send a email, I'll mail
it back.

LILO is doing its job wonderfully, but do not list being able to boot
other operating systems as a "tremendous achievement."  That is a
trivial "load one sector at address 0:7C00 and jump to it" exercise.
Do name being able to load a compressed image, that is one of its best
points.  (Even though it loads the image using a crude method.  :-)  )

Oh, Suns do boot other operating systems, like Amoeba, Sprite, NetBSD,
Minix-SPARC, etc.  The ROM monitor doesn't care what it boots, it is
the same as the PC BIOS does:  load the boot sector(s) and jump to it.
The Sun monitor is a bit smarter though, it knows about partitions.  The
PC BIOS leaves it to the master bootstrap (sector 0 on disk) to select
and boot the active partition.

You can tell the ROM monitor what device to boot with the 'boot'
command.  By default this is 'boot disk'  where 'disk' is an alias
for /dev/sd0a (/dev/dsk/c0t3d0s0 on Solaris 2.3).  Alas if you want to
boot anything other than one of the devices named by the aliases then
you need to a path in the device tree.  Luckily you can ask your O.S.
what this path is on the machine itself (or an identical one):

Under SunOS 4.1.3:
        # /usr/kvm/unixname2bootname /dev/sd0f
        /iommu@f,e0000000/sbus@f,e0001000/espdma@f,400000/esp@f,800000/sd@3,0:f

Under Solaris 2.3 (different machine):
        # ls -l /dev/dsk/c0t3d0s5
        lrwxrwxrwx  1 root           86 Jul 19 15:13 /dev/dsk/c0t3d0s5 -> ../../devices/iommu@0,10000000/sbus@0,10001000/espdma@4,8400000/esp@4,8800000/sd@3,0:f

Then you can use such a path as an argument to the boot command to boot
the 'f' partition:

        ok boot /iommu@f,e0000000/sbus@f,e0001000/espdma@f,400000/esp@f,800000/sd@3,0:f

This is a bit crude isn't it.  :-)
It should be possible to define your own disk aliases so you can type
'boot sol2' instead of the above command.  I haven't done it yet.

(Let's take further SunOS stuff to mail.)

Brrr.  I'd rather not look.  I'd rather critize smaller issues of decent
operating systems.

Precisely, they must be carefully mapped by running the installer each
time a new kernel is made.  (I never supposed one needed to reconfigure
the whole lot over and over.)

I don't have a SUN booter, I have made a PC bootstrap system for the PC
versions of Minix.  It has a tiny part of its code devoted to the simple
task of booting other operating systems.  (Or better: Getting the other
O.S.'s to boot themselves.)

Minix-386vm doesn't have ext2.  If so then the boot program would be
extended to support it.  It is not that much work to just be able to
read a file system.

>No, I still think the LILO method is a good idea.

Advantage: No FS code.
Disadvantages: Very careful installation of a new kernel.  One can only
choose from a limited set of kernels.  (Which is usually enough, of
course.)

Let me describe my bootstrap system, the "Minix Boot Monitor", so that
you can compare its features with LILO yourself.

A bootable Minix file system contains a bootstrap in the first sector of
the 1k boot block.  This bootstrap loads and starts the program /boot
using disk addresses patched into its code by the installboot program.

/boot (let's call it "the monitor") reads the second sector of the boot
block, the so called "parameters sector" to configure itself.  (There
are no config files whatsoever, it is all in this parameters sector.)

The monitor interprets a shell like language that has variables, simple
functions, menu items, and commands like 'boot', 'delay', 'ls', etc.
It can read commands from the keyboard, but normally begins by executing
the function 'main'.  Main by default runs 'menu'.  The menu by default
shows one choice:  "Start Minix".  This "choice" runs the command 'boot'
with no arguments.

The boot command selects the newest kernel image from the directory
/minix, loads and starts it bringing up Minix.  (You know, Minix, "the
early Linux development system."  :-)  )

If I wanted to run an old kernel I would hit ESC to get to the monitor
prompt and type:

        >ls /minix                      (The > is the monitor prompt)
        /minix/1.6.25.1r178             (Blame 'uname -rv' for the names)
        /minix/1.6.25.1r188
        >image = /minix/1.6.25.1r178
        >boot

Knowing the filesystem allows for a nice 'ls' command to look around on
the boot device.

To configure my system at home I have typed:

        >rootdev = sd2a                 (Use /dev/sd2a as the root device,
                                        not the default RAM disk)

        >main() {trap 2000 boot; menu}
                                        (Install a 2 second trap to run the
                                        command 'boot', then show the menu)

        >minix(=,Minix-386vm) {boot}
                                        (Add a menu entry for the '=' key)

        >dos(d,MS-DOS) {boot hd1}       (A menu entry to boot DOS)

        >SERIAL3 = on                   (Enable /dev/tty03, aka COM4)
        >DPETH0 = :15:                  (Ethernet 0 is at IRQ 15 instead of
                                        the default)
        >console = 2A:100:40            (Use BIOS mode 2A for 100x40 text)

        >save                           (Save current settings)

If I turn on my machine I see this:

        Minix boot monitor 1.6

        Press ESC to enter the monitor

        Hit a key as follows:

            =  Minix-386vm
            d  MS-DOS

I have got two seconds to type 'd' before it starts Minix automatically.

Further notes:

The monitor doesn't know what sd2a is, it simply looks up /dev/sd2a in
the file system to find its device number.  The device number is handed
to the kernel.  One more advantage to know what the FS looks like.

Choosing the newest kernel from a directory is another advantage of
knowing the FS.  The monitor can search directories and look at dates.
I can simply throw a newer kernel image into /minix and delete one of
the older images.

The kernel can be configured before it actually runs.  No need to break
out the emergency boot floppy to edit a config file if a misconfigured
kernel refuses to boot.

/boot is a 20k program compiled from 1200 lines of assembly and 3000
lines of C.  Coding most of it in C made it easier to add all the
runtime features, but required a 8086 cross-compiler.  Isn't the LILO
boot-time code 100% assembler?  Tremendous achievement if so.  (I have
only read the spiffy manual.)

Presumably you have DOS.... When I bought my PC I was given the option
to pay for DOS - I said "No!" :-)  Leaves me in a bit of a bind,
assuming I wanted to run 386BSD 1.0 that is.

It will use CPU cycles that are better used for something else.

It is not releated to the serial code, but to the timer rate.  Changing

I think it is.  Polling is nice for a single-tasking system, but in a
multi-tasking system it is just wasting the CPU for something that is
completely unnecessary.

the mouse is still an experimental area.  be sure you read whatever doc
there is.  it does not work 100%

I don't think so.  Only ET4000, S3, trident for now.

Probably your termcap entry in /etc/termcap is broken.  It often is.

You are using LREDIR, and therefore you *are* on what MSDOS thinks is a
network drive.   Think of Linux being your fileserver.

Can't help you with that...  doublespace won't get anywhere near to my
harddisk...

: To do admin you need a client that allows access to the bindery, the
: queues, and all other 'non filesystem' features of NetWare. Native DOS

One problem with the Filesystem side of netware is that there dosn't appear
to be anything attached to a file which can be used to "fake" an inode number.

: doesn't support this either, it's the programs such as syscon and pconsole
: that 'speak' this part of the protocol. Again, it is possible to support
: this protocol under linux.

Print queue's can be quite complex, especially remote print servers, since
there is a combination of using NCP to identify the server and SPX to query
the server.
