I, too, have been wondering about this.  I believe that there are at
least two problems with >1G support.  First, the standard IBM
partition scheme limits the number of heads to 255 and the number of
cylinders to 1024.  The math comes out such that drives larger than 1G
cannot be supported without hardware/firmware assist, e.g. Adaptec's
255 head mapping trick.  Since Linux uses the IBM style partition
tables, there is nothing simple that can be done.

Second, I suspect that there are some other kernel dependencies
relating to >1G drives.  Unfortunately, this is merely speculation.
It comes from troubles I have had with 1.2G and 1.7G drives as ext2
devices.

There is hope, however.  I have a Micropolis 2217 (1.7G) drive which I
formatted and partitioned with Adaptec software & hardware.  I wanted
to use all of the space, so I formatted as a DOS device, split it at
the 1G boundary to avoid 32K allocation clusters, did the 255 head
magic, and mounted the device as a UMSDOS device in Linux.  With some
inconveniences with respect to file and directory attributes (via
samba), the device works fine.

I once read a rumor about a new filesystem standard.  I believe that
ALL unices are limited to 2G partition sizes due to the 32 bit file
pointer accepted by the standard OS entry points.  Perhaps there is a
movement afoot to go to 64 bit pointers as did Microsoft with Windows
NT.

Keeping on with the old non-pic libs is not a sustainable option.  The
requirement to globally register every shared lib is becoming an
impediment to wider usage of linux.

I'm sorry for those who don't want to give up a small percent of their
CPU.  Piss an moan in Intel's direction.  It is because they designed
the 8086 family without consideration of software requirements that
pic performance is not as good as is could be.

I don't care if I have to give up 10%.  We have no real choice for a
sustainable linux future.

: Ah.  It sounds like a definitive answer here.  Not 16 bits, not 1 bit,

No, there's DD0-DD15, 16 bits.  The reason IDE is slower is because without
ATA-2 DMA Mode (preferably multiword mode 2), the CPU has to do the
transfers itself, whereas most SCSI disks do busmastering.  The ATA-2 draft
spec (which is already being used) has transfer rates up to 13M/Sec, which
puts it between Fast SCSI II and Fast/Wide SCSI II.  I'm seriously
considering getting a busmastering IDE controller just to write DMA drivers
for linux on it :-)

Why has the loopback route a destination 127.0.0.1 instead of 127.0.0.0
in accordance with the specified netmask?
The loopback interface could have IP address 127.0.0.1 and connect to
a loopback network 127.0.0.0 with netmask 255.0.0.0 (conceptually)

About assigning the same IP address to multiple interfaces on the same
host:
One could argue that this is "correct" as long as the outer world cannot
see any difference. Consider all interfaces as one big specially designed
interface with the software (linux) hiding the differences. So, as long
as the software supports this concept it is correct IMHO.

The previous poster was talking about doing real relocation/linking/loading,
not PIC ELF libraries.  I was pointing out that that kind of linking would
involve modifying just about every page, rendering it unsharable.  Although
it would ultimately generate fast code, sharing pages is far more important
for overall system performance.

For common libraries used by lots of people and program, such as libc,
it's well worth the extra development time.  (IMHO, since I'm not the one
doing the work.)

Remember that one goal is to maximize the number of pages that may be shared
among processes.  Resolving the addresses at load time changes bunches of
text pages, preventing them from being shared. 

Here are a few points to consider and debate:
        o  PIC (position independent code) on x86 processors is
           significantly slower than normal code.
        o  Small processes, like those typically run by shell scripts, spend
           most of their time in startup and library calls.
        o  I/O-oriented program often use printf(), which is library code.
vs.
        o  Library calls like read() are just a few instructions to set up
           the syscall.  The slowdown of PIC is unnoticable.
        o  CPU intensive applications spend little time in library code.
           and tend to use calls like read() when they do.

BS!
Just because the the OS is free doesn't meen the software has to be.
Linux (if you don't go for the newest stuff all the time)
is stable enough for the comercial sector to go for it. The thing about the 
libc is true. But the argument 'Linux for the hackers' is outdated for long.
The compatibility is nothing to brake progress. Just go for the max_version-1 Kernal

Nothing lost to comercial applications of the worlds greates OS.

I see a rather simple answer to this problem of not enough support.
(If there is one)
Wy not have a list of people willing to give tech-support for each country
included in every CD-ROM arcive.
This is the way Richard Stallman envisioned the support for GPL products.
I am a student in one of the two major comercial centers of Germany, so 
would be glad to help any company or private person in need of some
help installing the Linux package on there PCs. I am pretty shure
I cost less than the support some companies, I are availiable almost 
around the clock, and there is no need for the client to understand the
lingo. That beats MS anytime.
(My ear is still clogged from the sermon the +@#$#$@@$$% guys from Micro-
Soft, Lexmark and IBM have giving over that #$%$%#$^@#$@ printer connection
from MSWinWord6.0)
But for the flexible, availiable help from privete persons to privste persons
there is no way to advertise. I. by myself can't afford large ads in 
selectone(["CHIP", "ComputerWeekly", "c't", etc....])

How about a list of people with real world telefone numbers on each CD.
maintained by someone, and put in sunsite. (therefore mirrored on each 
"DREAM-CD").

I like your analogy:
Its extremly good for the enviroment to have people driving around in old
clunkers that burn a gallon a mile. (no smile, face in rage!)

So just you and I know that Linux is better than Windows means that we are the
profesionals and may be proud of that knowledge.

Now look at it from the other angle: I am trying to make a living of
computers. I have to listen to the whailing of the users all
the time: Why is such and such not working (in a Windows envirment (see former post))

I would like to bring the good news to John Q Public too. But as long as there is
no WYSIWYG text-system for them they will not by it. And as long MS is the
only one able and willing to have an aggressive Ad-Campaign running,
all those lemmings will have to follown the light.
