Then run the XFconfig86 shell script.  If you get more errors, you may
have to correct them until it runs O.K.  Whenever something gets better,
keep an extra copy of the best Xconfig file you have so far.  Even after
XFconfig86 runs O.K., you may have to fine-tune your preferences as you
learn more about X11.

Maybe that is not the case anymore with 4.1.3 or on sparc machines, shrug.

Subject: DOS BC++/Linux floats
From: riku.saikkonen@compart.fi (Riku Saikkonen)
Date: Thu,  1 Sep 94 19:01:00 +0200

I have made an application that I use in both MS-DOS and Linux. The
thing works well enough, and I was able to port it from MS-DOS Borland
C++ to Linux gcc pretty easily. But there's one problem...

I would like to use the MS-DOS version and the Linux version with the
same data files. Linux reads the MS-DOS fs well enough, but my files are
in a binary format. Basically, just a few structs written directly from
memory using fwrite().

So I just need to get the file format to be the same. And there's my
problem. Most of it was easy (after I figured out that int is 32-bit in
Linux :)), but floats I can't seem to read. The BC++ float format and
the Linux float format seem to be different.

So, is there a way to read the Borland C++ floating point numbers in
Linux? Now I have a converter to convert the data file to ASCII and
back, but that's not an optimal soluion...

(Whyever did that get so long? Hmm... :))

I suspect that the boot EEPROM on the sparcs can read BSD partition
tables and BSD hard disk partitions, and thus can find /vmunix.

Rather than containing code to read partition tables and Linux
partitions, lilo figures out which disk blocks the kernel file is on,
and puts the block number data in a place it can find on bootup.

It has, but hiccups *do* occur, which is exactly why there are two
branches of the kernel: the production version (1.0.x) and the
development version (1.1.x).  The development version is as you point
out, an alpha release, and contains much untested code.  It should
*not* be used if you are worried about stability.

Since the kernel developers are gearing up for a new production
release (1.2.0) the stability of recent 1.1.x kernels have been
rapidly improving, since the developers have gotten much more
conservative with adding new features.  Expect 1.2.0 to be very
stable, but the first 1.3.x kernels (new development thread) will
probably be a bit wobbly due to many suddenly added untested features.

I noticed this too.  It appears to be a bug in the kernel when the setreuid()
system call is invoked with a paremeter of -1.  Sasteriods among other programs
use this to preserve superuser status (which svgalib automacially relinquishes)
The following patch to kernel/sys.c seems to fix the problem.

This is the way RCS/SCCS were intended to be used, they are
"Quality/Revision" control software, which only work properly in
conjunction with the correspongin manual proceedures eg BS5750.  In
fact I was taught not to check a file back into RCS unless it compiled
and had been _fully_ test.

Emacs (from version 19.xx) integrates very nicely with either of them.
In fact it is in a way not to disimilar to what you described above
(the script method).

However the main difference arises in that Emacs it's self actual is
aware of RCS/SCCS.

eg I want to open the source file: foobar.cc
I use the normal Emacs command sequence to do so, Emacs then does one
of the following:

1.  Opens the file in an editable buffer (ie I had the file locked)
2.  Opens the file in a read-only buffer (someone else has a lock)
3.  Reteives the file from RCS/SCCS into a read-only buffer (ie I now
                           have a lock on a previously unlocked file)
    I can then make the buffer editable and Emacs will also check the
    file out in a locked state.
4.  I can then submit the file back to RCS/SCCS and an Emacs recursive
    edit buffer allows me to enter the log message.


>This still leaves the need for a short-lived file version system in the
>filesystem, i.e. comparable to what Netware and VMS do.

Emacs (or rather the GNU utils in general) comes to the rescue yet
again.  Setting the environment variable VERSION_CONTROL to t then the
cp, mv commands along with the emacs save file function will create
multiple backup copies.

eg

foobar.cc               -- the file normally edited
foobar.cc.~1~           -- the backups of this file
foobar.cc.~2~
foobar.cc.~3~ ....

Okay so you say won't this just fill up the file system with backups,
well no since this is implemented sensibly and emacs will prompt the
user to delete excess files when a user defined limit is reached.  It
does this by deleting files from the middle eg. *~3~ *~4~ from a set
of say 10 files.

For more information on the above features look at the Emacs Info page
or the man page for GNU cp.


So finally, I'm not say that Un*xen don't need an undelete command,
just that there are better ways to ensure that we can retreive
previous "versions" of our information.

Accidents do happen and sometimes an undelete command really would
help, but if we use all of the above in conjuction with proper backup
procedures we can 99% of the time get by without it, at the 1% of the
time well whats the answer:
         "Sorry User, I can't sit and paste 300 strips of paper
          together just cause you left the cheque sitting on top
          of the shredder :-)"

(One final note if your not an Emacs fan _please_ do not start an
editor flame war, that's would bring the street cred of this group way down)

Only the first and last disk change messages are correct.

Similar messages occur if I boot from the floppy, using a minix
bootdisk I've prepared as the root filesystem.   There are unexpected
interrupt messages, sensei messages, and nonsensical filesystem
behavior.

Now, it's possible that this hardware is wonky.  It's an MPC
notebook which may be having hardware problems.  But, what makes
me a little suspicious is that 1.1.40 seems to work quite well
for floppy accesses.

Finally, I'm afraid I have to say that I'm about to lose access
to this machine, so I can't help track the problem down.  If
I'm the only person having such problems, I think we should just
forget it.

Heavens.  You didn't think I was suggesting that Linux had no
support for asynchronous serial communications, did you?  What
good would PPP be without THAT?

Perhaps I should have been more explicit here.  The facility
I was talking about is for a program to be able to request
that an I/O be done on its behalf but not block waiting for
it to complete, and instead to get a signal when it's done.

Anyway, hardware flow control is both supported and 
recommended!

Hello All,
        I am having great problems making 1.1.44 or greater booting with my
harddrive.  The kernel compiles as smoothly as usual, but when I try to boot 
from floppy disk ( cat zImage >/dev/fd0; rdev etc.) the system just locks up.
It comes back with the dreaded HD reset error and just stops.  It appears that
when the system starts as such, init etc, that they cannot be accessed from 
the harddrive.  I tried one suggestion of telling fdisk about my drive in the
expert menu (it is a WD540MB drive with 32 heads that is configured as a 16
head device in the BIOS) and set my heads to 16, however, that did not appear
to make any difference.
        Any help would be gratefull, since 1.1.23 that I am using at the moment
does not seem to work too well with the floppy disk drive.
        The machine is a fairly standard Gateway2000 486DX266 PCI, with 2 WD540
drives, one for D&W(aargh!) and one for Linux.  Never had any problems up till
the newer kernel versions.

                        All the best

                                        Alan
