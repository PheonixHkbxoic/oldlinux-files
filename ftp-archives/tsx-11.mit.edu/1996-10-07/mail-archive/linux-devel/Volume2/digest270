Ah, I have a (sigh) Supra FAXmodem 14.4 (internal).  This has an
internal 2k recieve buffer, I don't know of any way to turn it off
though.

Anyway, in some more non-scientific testing, my patch brought
ping times from 2000ms to 450ms during ftp sesions.

Is anyone using a standard kernel with SLIP and finding interactive
response to be OK while downloading?

Kernel 1.1.51,...

It happens to me as well, specially if I do compile on multiple tty

It has been doing this since version 1.1.08!!!

I actually had a lots of problem to do the FIRST install from the CD...
It hanged _every_ minutes or so...

I kind a fixed the problem by puting a 12 inches FAN pointing inside my
case (wide open!). Since then it hangs _very_ less often.

It never happend with DOS/Window/NT/OS2 before.
I suppose that Linux make my CPU (or motherboard) work harder???

Give it a try, it could work too. :)

I don't know if it is a 'timings' problem, or a power supply, but the fan
solution worked fine for me!

OK... I see a lot of posts about Motif being ugly.  So, what in your
opinion looks good?  I find Motif not beautiful but it looks OK to
me.  At least it is consistent.  XView, regardless of how good it may
be, is being rapidly abandoned.  Motif is being accepted.  Not my

is their licensing and the price they charge.

Drew Eckhardt <drew@frisbee.cs.Colorado.EDU> has added BIOS32 and PCI
configuration support to the most recent development kernels (1.1.51).  It
currently is tied to his NCR53c810 driver, but I'm certain that will be
cleaned up after a few other drivers start using it.

A quick outline of how to use the code:

#include <linux/pci.h>
#include <linux/bios32.h>
...

#if defined(CONFIG_PCI)
#define AMD_VENDOR_ID 0x1022
#define AMD_DEVICE_ID 0x2000
   if (pcibios_present()) {
      int pci_index;

      for (pci_index = 0; pci_index < 8; pci_index++) {
         unsigned char pci_bus, pci_device_fn;
         unsigned char irq_line;
         unsigned long pci_ioaddr;
                 
         if (pcibios_find_device (AMD_VENDOR_ID, AMD_DEVICE_ID, pci_index,
                                  &pci_bus, &pci_device_fn) != 0)
             break;
         pcibios_read_config_byte(pci_bus, pci_device_fn,
                                  PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE, &irq_line);
         pcibios_read_config_dword(pci_bus, pci_device_fn,
                                   PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_0, &pci_ioaddr);
         /* Remove I/O space marker in bit 0. */
         pci_ioaddr &= ~3;
         printk("Found PCnet/PCI at %#lx, irq %d.\n", pci_ioaddr, irq_line);
...
     }

Subject: [Q] SLIP/PPP and modems with large internal buffers
Date: 6 Oct 1994 14:25:18 GMT

I'm trying to debug some software IP TOS queuing (under linux)
and have a hardware question just to make sure I'm not totally
off base:
 
Several people, including myself, have modems with large internal
buffers (mine is a supra internal FAXmodem 1.44) which we use
with SLIP and PPP.  The problem is, when we start an ftp
download transfer in the background the interactive response
becomes very poor.
 
I don't believe this should happen since TOS queuing is implemented;
however, I'd like to bounce this off the net :
 
Could the large internal buffer in the modem (2k in my case)
be the cause of the problem?  

How about this:  can anyone start a large ftp session and still
have good interactive response (with any system and OS)?  

BTW: I know about keeping the MTU low (I use 296).  Lower MTUs 
do provide somewhat better response times, but still not as good 
as what is possible in theory.  (as described in Stevens' "TCP/IP
Illustrated Vol. I")

thanks for anything you can provide

Actually, Quickdraw, including internal format of, e.g. PICT data, is
very well documented. However, I thought that the "Quickdraw" printers
were simply sent a dot pattern from the Mac - the Quickdraw is running
in the Mac, not the printer. That's why the printer is cheaper and slower.

Nope, FFS first appeared in either 4.1b or 4.1c, I forget which, and
was officially released in 4.2 in 1983.  I have the 4.2 manuals to
prove it.

The big thing that 4.3 gave over 4.2 was genericly improved performance.
There were a number of FFS improvements in 4.3, most notable of which
was the namei cache, but don't confuse performance improvements with
the introduction of FFS itself.

One main point agains Motif in my opinion is that I want a GUI
(Grafical User Interface). The Motif specification is full of Keyboard
User Interface (I do not think of shortcuts). Every Motif program has
to be usable without a mouse. This leads to jumping default buttons
and lots of other strange things. Why are there functions like move
and resize in the menu in the upper left corner? To be used with
keyboard UI? Or, because the graphical resize UI is to hard to use?
The corners are to small to hit on first try?

Does this still sound like a good GUI?

And consistence is made by the programs, not the toolkit. Mosaic is a
good example for a bad GUI. The save as... dialog bos often has no
popup for the file type, becaus it resizes itself to narrow. The
open... dialog box has the last text in the only text field not
selected. And it has dialog boxes with buttons labeled YES and NO.
Motif specification name the right mouse mutton the menu button. But a
lot of Motif programs just don't do anything, when pressing the right
mouse button on a menu bar item. Mosaic is not the only one, that does
not open it's menues.

There is a lot more to judje, when speaking about GUIs. I think Motif
has focused to much on impressive look and they forgot to implement
their own feel. Or does Motif feel like

        ThisProgramDoesNotObeyTheSpecification?

This should be easy to implement.

  Strick's posting of infilt gave me the idea that it would be

  As more and more folks are getting the Internet into their homes on
  inexpensive PC's, this might actually turn into an important aspect

  While all the discussion here has been about expensive chokes,

I realise that this is probably the wrong group to send to, but does anyone
know whether the new GCC includes 586 optimisation?

(To justify my putting this msg here) Does this make any difference to the
Linux kernel?

Cheers

Ivan

P.S. If someone knows, I wouldn't mind a brief email to say so, as I do not get
to logon very often.

This is incorrect; OSF/Motif is an API. OSF's implementation has a particular
behavior; applications which offer this behavior can be certified as
Motif-compliant, whether or not they are using an implementation of OSF/Motif
derived from OSF's source or some other toolkit.

Note that the visuals are not specified, although they are the most obvious
characteristic of the toolkit and the one that Motif knock-offs emulate, at
the cost of behavior.
