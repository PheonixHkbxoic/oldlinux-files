Well, the only thing I didn't add was 1.1.51 for the kernel.  While
nothing is locking up, there is a lag while telnetting with an FTP
session going on that is annoying.  I've received a patch that I
hope to be able to roll in this weekend and do some serious testing.
Other things that run are Sendmail+IDA as a daemon, xntpd, and
CERN's web server.  The ftp session definitely takes over the system.

What do the FSF's political goals have to do with it?  GNU software is (by
definiteion) free, and people can and do port it to any platform they feel
like.  Even by discouraging this the FSF flies in the face of it's own
goals.

In any event, I've certainly heard of both a Mac 68k and Mac PPC Linux
port.  I've got no idea on the status of either.  The 68k one seems to be
doing quite well (it was discussed in a recent Lunux Journal article), and
the PPC one will almost certainly happen since future Power Mac's will
most probably be designed with the new PPC hardware standards so that
porting to a Power Mac will be equivalent to porting to most any PowerPC
machine.

I agree with Andi though, it'd be nice to have more frequent updates on
the states of all the Linux ports.  Perhaps a monthly posting listing the
current status and contact points for all Linux ports?

Check out also the OI kit from ParcPlace - builds for OpenLook or Motif. You

It's freely available for Linux and a new version is expected sometime
following the stable releases of Linux (1.2), libraries (4.6) and gcc (2.6).
XFree 3.1 is already out.

How about giving packets below a certain size higher priority?
That would help interactive traffic, and handle cases such as downloads 
though a terminal session properly.

The change in mail routing is exactly the problem I have.  I cannot unsubscribe.
I have also tried mailing root, postmaster and operator, but to no avail. I think
the system needs to be made a little more inteligent in its handling of addresses.

How do I even SEE the addresses it THINKS it has for me?

Just curious:  Does anyone have an MP system that they can try running
Linux on?  Does it croak, or just not take advantage of the 2nd CPU?

Also, I've been looking at the MP Pentiums, and I was wondering if I 
purchased a system with just 1 CPU and added a second later when Linux 
gets some kind of MP support if that would work.

IMHO, this sounds like a very simple way of doing things, however, I have
the following problems with TOS:
    (a) Any user can build a copy of ftp that resets the packet TOS back to
        interactive, putting the network right back where to it started.
    (b) TOS only has two levels--interactive, and non-interactive.  However,
        most network applications really should be considered at more levels
        than two.  For example, I would order them as: telnet/r* should be
        first, NFS should be second, HTTP should be third, ..., and ftp
        should be last as long as it doesn't cause a timeout.
    (c) Users must upgrade all their, possibly customized, client applications
        for this to work.
    (d) Extensive kernel modification was needed.
    (e) The prioritization is static.  I believe that different networks
        have different needs and may want to control their network traffic
        more than others.

In all actuality, I wish I would have know about the TOS modifications before
I started this patch Lars and I've been working on.  I must have the older
clients which don't support TOS.  I'd really like to take a look at the
performance differences.  Has a package been created where I could grab one
file and have all the latest client applications (e.g., which Slackware
(version ?) file(s) do I need)?


>So, if you set up a link with a small MTU, you should get OK performance.

What do you consider small?  I have a MTU of <=1006 which isn't too bad
considering I can usually get 1.6 kb/s using ftp.

Yeah, I missed it too.  What version of the kernel (and client apps) started
using TOS properly?

From a simple, single user, standard installation stand-point, I agree,
there wouldn't be much difference.  However, I'd like to have a way of
dynamically changing the packet weights depending on the network traffic.

I think if everyone beta tested every piece of software to come out,
no one would every get any work done.  We all select the stuff that
is most important to us, and try to help out as best we can.  I'm
currently working hard to help get kinks out of DOSEMU, which I think
is a worthwhile project.  It takes a lot of time, and I have to weed
through a lot of debugging output and ftp patches every couple of days
(plus the ones the authors want me to try out).

I simply could not do this for every piece of software.

Your best bet is to move the diskimage to a:, boot from that, and then
lredir the /dev/sda disk to c:

Booting from diskimage in a: is simple:

bootA               # Startup drive valid values:  bootA  bootC

#    Use the following option to boot from the specified file, and then
#    once booted, have bootoff execute in autoexec.bat. Thanks Ted :-).
#    Notice it follows a typical floppy spec. To create this file use
#    dd if=/dev/fd0 of=/var/lib/dosemu/bdisk bs=16k
#
bootdisk { heads 2 sectors 9 tracks 80 threeinch file /var/lib/dosemu/bdisk }


You can still have both floppies available:

floppy { device /dev/fd0 threeinch }  
floppy { device /dev/fd1 fiveinch }

Finally, you have the file \dosemu\bootoff.bat on the DOS disk:

bootoff



This does the trick.  C: is now a redirected drive, and A: and B: are
the floppies again.

Subject: 1.1.52 bug?
From: riku.saikkonen@compart.fi (Riku Saikkonen)

Hmm... Linux crashes on me, seemingly randomly. Nothing works
after the crash, not virtual console switching, not Ctrl-Alt-Del.
'Unable to handle kernel paging request' and the normal register dump
appears in the log, for two or three processes. The EIP is in a totally
different location each time...

So, it seems that it's the 1.1.52 kernel which is having some problems.
I noticed some modification of memory.c in the .52 patch; perhaps that's
the culprit?

Anyone else seen the same problems?

I can't be really sure if this is a kernel bug, because I just did a
quite heavy upgrade of the machine (switched to a VLB motherboard +
display adapter + IDE host adapter). That's why I'm asking...

Hmm, now I compiled 1.1.50, and it seems to work. Except for one crash
in X, but that is probably something else (no kernel panic or anything
in the log). So I think it is a bug in 1.1.52...

Well, I've nevre heard of software killing a floppy drive, and I boot 
from my floppy and have created multiple boot floppies without trouble.

Sounds like coincidence to me, but I could be wrong.
