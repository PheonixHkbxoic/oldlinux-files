The file you want is the utility package  "sndkit" which is meant to
accompany the kernel sound driver.  It has a small program "mixer" 
as well as an X version, xvmixer.

The probe problem mentioned occurs in the autoIRQ code, which
1) has been updated to work (I think) with level-triggered interrupts in my
development version of auto_irq.c, and
2) isn't be needed with the PCI-PnP-aware version of the driver (the 24 bit
version was put out for alpha test yesterday, the 32 bit version might
replace it in a few days).

I've also changed this driver's interrupt handling to loop on the interrupt
bit, as required for level-triggered interrupts.  (The other drivers do
this, I don't recall why I didn't structure this driver the same way.)

Still remaining to be done is the changes to interrupt dispatcher and
request_irq() to efficiently support multiple devices on the same interrupt
line.

I am currently reading a book just on that subject. Curt Schimmel
has written a book called "Unix systems for modern architectures"
which discusses cache and multiprocessor issues for kernel design.
So far it looks quite useful and informative.

Subject: (uu)getty_ps broken in 1.1.50?
Date: 30 Sep 1994 03:21:10 GMT

i've been trying to get an answer for this question for over 2 weeks, and i
haven't even gotten a flame calling me an idiot or telling me im posting in the
wrong place.  i posted before in col.help, but since i've gotten no answer from
there and i suspect there might be a new kernel compile involved, ill post it
here.

i recently read a post in one of the news groups where someone said that they
had dial-in working with (uu)getty_ps and they did a kernel upgrade and it
stopped working.  i paid notice to this post, but didn't save it as it wasn't
important at the time [as i wasn't ready to do this yet], but i was still
hoping to read an answer.

since then, i've tried to set it up on two machines [1.1.50 and 1.1.51].  both
are using getty_ps v 2.07d.  i didn't have any problem getting it set up, and
everything seems to work up until the time uugetty is supposed to prompt for
login.  the debug output says "calling getlogname()" but a little garbage
prints on  the other screen and that's it.  i've tried every configuration and
made sure that both modems are the same setup.

i would have written this off as stupidity [and it still may be], but i found
nothing in any HOWTO but since someone else had mentioned the same [?] problem,
im not so sure.

does anyone know if this is related to the new kernel, and if this is the case,
if it has been fixed?  or am i just an idiot about to be violently flamed?
[hopefully with the anser to my problem also ;)]

thanx for any info,
bob

Yeah, but it's not as simple as taking two SCSI computers and hooking
them up to each other.  You've got to make sure that no two devices on
the SCSI bus have the same address.  Often, the host adapters of two
computers will have the same address.  Sometimes this can't be
changed (eg. with cheap SCSI cards).  You've also got to make sure no
two disks in both systems have the same address, etc...

So, yeah, TCP/IP could be implemented over SCSI, but it's of dubious
value with network cards as cheap as they are.

Both fixes (I've seen another one, too) lead to the following here (at boot
time; it is reproducable; and!!! my "normal" v1.1.51 makes no problems - in
this relation..):

[...]
fsck.ext2: No such device while trying to open /dev/sdb1
  couldn't find valid filesystem superblock
fsck.ext2: No such device while trying to open /dev/sda1
  couldn't find valid filesystem superblock
/dev/hdb1 is clean, no check
[...]

I tried it several times. No other changes. Also did switch the whole box off.
It is definitely the change to floppy.c that leads to this..

(relevant, I think) Hardware:

- AT-Bus Controller w/ two IDE hard disks attached & floppy enabled!
- AHA1542B w/ 4 hard disc's, 2 SQ5110 and a streamer attached & floppy
  disabled!

I'd really like to have one more look at some of the postings here but
unfortunately a filter did "hit" me (it deleted all msgs. with "flop", "scsi",
"adapt" and "aha[12]" in the subject line... :-}, I did switch it off a little
late.. )

Seeing that the scsi hard discs (well, to two which should be automounted at
startup) are not recognized (right) when applying either of the patches
mentioned here, and having in mind that there's been some posting related to
probs with the AHA1542B, I guess there may be some relation..

Maybe this helps lighten up this 
"Adaptec?/shutdown/mount/floppy/etc.." mess.  :-}

BASH doesn't have the DEBUG "fake" signal.  It would be nice to

This posting did not come from our office, but we are tracing it.
If you look carefully at headers you will find sites that don't exist,

We have a good idea of who it is and some admins are helping us trace it

If you have the time and ability to help us trace this, we can give you

I've used two ethernet cards on 1.0.9 and later. I think that the

You need to do a few things. First, you need to enable IP forwarding
in your kernel if you're using any kernel after about 1.1.13. This is
one of the "make config" options.

Second, you need to set up some routing. On the gateway, you need to
set up a default route to the .100 address. You also need to set up a
route for your internal network.

On each machine (on your internal network), the default gw will be the
gateway machine's address (whatever that is).

Finally, you need to be able to tell your provider about your internal
network. This is most easily done with a static route at the provider,
which will identify the gateway machine as the next hop on the way to
your internal network. This is the easiest way, but not necessarily
the best. The best way is probably to run "routed" or "gated" and send
RIP updates to your provider from the gateway machine. However, this
takes some more work to get set up.

I would recommend an investment in O'Reilly's "TCP/IP Network
Administration", available at most (good) computer stores or technical
bookstores. It explains how to do all of this. You can also reach
O'Reilly via WWW or ftp to ora.com.

Good luck!

I had the same problem, and sometimes was able to get it working,
sometimes not. I didn't ever get the whole thing to successfully
compile. You can pick the binaries up from sunsite, though, which is
much easier than trying to get it to compile. The suggestions I got
from the guy who *does* get it to compiler were to upgrade my bash to
the latest (1.14, I think), upgrade to the latest net stuff (net3),
and try both yacc and bison.

If you do get this to compile, please let us know what you did.

Pete.

Subject: ATI ULTRA + w/internal b-mouse
Date: 30 Sep 1994 19:55:54 GMT

Hi, has anyone gotten the mouse that comes with the ati ultra + working.
Its supposed to be ms inport compatible but nope, don't work. I tried
the atixl and regular ms drivers and none work. With all of them I keep 
getting invalid argument. The also don't show up in the boot messages (the
driver initializing the mouse). Its set to use irq 5 and the primary
addr range (23Ch to 23Fh). Could not find anyrhing in the how to either.
Any help appreciated.

Chris

Yes, huhu.  Think about how this will interact with disk caches.
