Subject: What GNU Tutorials would you attend?

We are thinking of having a GNU technical seminar in Cambridge,
Massachusetts next April or May.  One day will be a series of talks,
mostly technical overviews; the following day we are thinking of
having tutorials.  Tentatively we plan to charge $300 for the day of
talks, and $180 for each half day tutorial (students 1/4 price).
(These prices may change; consider them order-of-magnitude estimates.)
The funds raised, beyond the cost of the seminar itself, will go to
support GNU development.

To plan the tutorials, we need to find out what tutorial topics people
are interested in.  Here are the topics we are thinking about.

* Emacs Lisp programming.
* Advanced Emacs editing.
* Hurd programming.
* Using GNU Make, Bison, and Flex.
* Writing documentation in Texinfo.
* The Linux kernel.
* Using Autoconf to write portable programs.
* Porting GCC.

If you think you would actually attend one or more of these tutorials,
please send mail to gnu-tutorials@gnu.ai.mit.edu and tell us which
ones.  We'll use the response to figure out which tutorials to offer,
and how to schedule them.

Yes - doing a new telnet session (if another one is hanging) works.
We had the same problems if using a router between different networks (ip-nets).
Now we added the nets to the physical ethernet (running different ip-networks
on ONE ethernet) and it seems to be somehow better. BUT: If we put
heavy traffic into a telnet session (i.e. moving the pine scrollbar rapidly)
the session hangs again. 

We didn't had this problems with 1.0. It appears only from a 1.1.45 to 1.0 hosts.

One of the things brought up as an adjunct to the idea of TCP/IP over SCSI was 
the concept of shared files systems (only possible with SCSI since only SCSI 
can share devices between two machines). 

DEC did a shared file system setup using DECNET over ethernet for arbitration / 
cache control... Wouldn't it have been so much nicer to have all the control 
messages pass over the same high speed link that was handling the shared device 
access? I.E. shared file systems on two or more machines without any other 
connection except the SCSI cable between them!!

Shared file systems almost seems like the more useful of two reasons to pass 
messages over a SCSI bus, with TCP/IP over SCSI just being a happy side affect, 
except that TCP/IP support was asked for before shared file systems were even 
mentioned. A perfect example of how we sometimes get the cart before the horse!

If you are interested in joining the SCSINET project (which has, as one of its 
goals, a project to develop shared SCSI file systems) Send a one line message

Matthais Urlichs has some streams code going. The networking changes for
1.3.x I want to have streams from a user viewpoint (the kernel side of
normal SYS5 streams is too big a performance cost). Don't hold your breath
for it though.

Motif is a user interface specification, i.e., a prescription of how certain
things are supposed to look and behave on a computer screen.

The OSF sells an implementation of a widget set and window manager
(among other things) that allegedly lets you write programs that adhere
to the Motif specification. Unfortunately, that implementation is also
called Motif, which generates a lot of confusion.

There is nothing in the Motif specification that forces you to write
applications using the Motif implementation from the OSF, as long as
whatever stuff you produce sticks to the specification. This is not
especially straightforward, since the specification itself is something
of a moving target.

It turns out that many customers aren't really too fussy about what
you're using as long as the results work and look reasonably Motifish.
So a vaguely Motif-like appearance like the one obtainable using Tk, for
instance, is often quite sufficient. Speaking of Tk, note also that it
is supposed to converge more towards the Motif specification in the
future.

   I also see this with the new fast driver & 1.51. BUT, I really
   don't think it's related to *swapping*, per se. My experience
   suggests that this hang occurs (somewhat randomly) whenever you
   write _large_ amounts of data to disk. My system uses a swap file,
   so it seems unlikely that it's a swap file versus partition issue.
   I can recreate the hang by something as simple as untarring the
   linux source tree, or doing 'dd if=zImage of=/boot/zImage'. Not
   always, but often enough that I keep a boot floppy with 1.0.9 and
   the old driver handy (never have been convinced that the newer
   kernels don't play a part in the problem).  Also, there was a
   noticable increase in failures when I went from 8 megs to 16.
   This is high quality RAM, by the way, and hasn't shown ANY sign
   of giving trouble anywhere else. So, my theory is that with the
   filesystem buffers a lot bigger than they used to be, large
   amounts of stuff will be written to buffers before getting flushed
   every 5 seconds or whatever by update. During flush, then,
   something in the driver gets overloaded and ends up hanging.

I can remember there was a kernel-warning:
 ******bdflush not running*******
Can anybody explain this warning?

Several people mailed me help with their 5030E drives so I though I'd respond

After consulting my documentation, I am afraid that I have a 5031E

Before anyone trusts CFS on any box with Sun derived RPC (Linux included)
ensure you have the fixed rpc.portmap that doesn't allow portmap redirected

SCSI has very short cabling limits so even if you can pass data between
hosts which I think you can it would be ungainly. Given that ethernet

The Arch hardware (like the later Amiga hardware) has a drive that doesn't
need to be seeked to get the response. The older Amiga used to seek every
few seconds making the distinctive clunk-clunk in the background until you
got so annoyed you stuffed a disk in it to shut it up.

Since when you do floppy I/O you can check the drive changes you can mount

Linux reflects the hardware people posess - thats one thing thats good about
it - you can run it on a 4Mb 386SX, you can use old MFM drives , you can
use 360K floppies. You can run X on a herc card. Until a bunch of Linux
hackers have a multicpu pentium board and relevant documentation nothing
will happen. So the people who want it can either

1) Buy a machine and do the job
2) Buy a machine and donate it to someone in exchange for doing the job.
