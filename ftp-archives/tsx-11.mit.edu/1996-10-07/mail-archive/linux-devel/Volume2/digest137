While I agree that DECstation 3100s and 5000s would be a nice target for
Linux (after all, DEC is dumping their MIPS-based machines in favor of 
Alphas so they should be available cheap used, but the 5000s at least
are still a good bit faster than 486s), it won't be that easy.  I think
the MIPS/Linux project which you heard of is to port to a system with
a MIPS CPU but which is otherwise a PC-- ie, EISA or PCI bus, and same
old PC peripherals you're used to.  The DECstations, on the other hand,
use an entirely different bus (TurboChannel) and different boards which
plug into that bus.  So it could be done (of course) but you would end
up having to write drivers for the bus, the SCSI adapter, the video
board, and so on.  Basically everything, all over again.  For a machine
which has been discontinued, perhaps it's not worth it, unless someone who
has a _lot_ of them already does it and the rest of us can benefit ;-).

If the machine supports Intel's SMP hardware standard, then it should
run OS/2 SMP, Windows NT, SCO MPX, Solaris 2.4 for x86, SVR4.2 MP,
and possibly others that I've missed.  But just because Linux wouldn't
be the first doesn't mean it's not worth doing...

   No ideas, but I have this problem since 1.1.41. I've upgraded to .45 and
   tested the versions in between and nothing solved the problem. The
   uucp-connections are very bad, because chars are lost. Now I've diabled in
   drivers/char/serial.c the CONFIG_NEW_SERIAL_ISR but there is only a slightly

Pardon me?

SGI will dump IRIX for NT when hell freezes over.

This is not to say that there will never be an SGI box that runs NT.
But I doubt the Indy ever will.  And there's no chance that SGI will
ever "dump" IRIX.

For perspective, a year or two ago, SGI showed an Indigo running NT as

Subject: There's a hole in my copy!
From: mark@garden.equinox.gen.nz (Mark Tomlinson)
Date: Thu, 8 Sep 94 09:10:44 +1200

This maybe should be in a GNU group, since it's about GNU's cp program
more than linux, but there's probably more knowledgeable people here
anyway.

Yesterday, while trying to work out how to create a file with holes in it
(to save disk space), I found that merely copying the file did the job
without me having to do anything special. I thought this was a great
feature, but when I looked at the source code to cp, I found that this was
not was intended. (from fileutils-3.9).

The relevant piece of code looks like this:

      /* If the file has fewer blocks than would normally
         be needed for a file of its size, then
         at least one of the blocks in the file is a hole. */
      if (S_ISREG (sb.st_mode) &&
          sb.st_size - (sb.st_blocks * DEV_BSIZE) >= DEV_BSIZE)
        make_holes = 1;

Since sb.st_blocks is unsigned, the comparison is unsigned also. For any
file which does not have holes, and the last block is not completely full
(that's most files), then the LHS evaluates to a negative number, and
make_holes is set true. Even using signed numbers, I don't see why the
comparison is against DEV_BSIZE. Surely it should simply be:
     if ( .. && sb.st_size > (sb.st_blocks * DEV_BSIZE))

I am using kernel 1.0 (in case the type of st_blocks has changed since
then), and the cp source is from fileutils3.9 which came with Slackware
1.2.

If this has been fixed since then you can ignore all the above, but could
someone tell me if there is an accepted way of creating holes in files to
compact them? (I was actually a bit surprised to find that executables
didn't have holes in them!).

I also get my clock running fast. However after seeing many system unable
to keep accurate time I doubt there is any kernel bug causing it. It's
most likely inaccurate hardware, clocks or timer chips. I would suggest
doing a 'man 8 clock' and reading the stuff about the -a option. Since
doing this I have only gained 7 seconds in the last month. I might even
take the time to tune that down to zero.

Subject: [SERIAL] Parity problems - an update
Date: Wed, 7 Sep 1994 16:23:23 GMT


Hello again,

I've commented on the KERNEL mailing list (and c.o.l.d) about the problems
I'm having with serial communications under DOSEMU, and I wasn't certain if
the problems were in the DOSEMU code or the kernel drivers... I have resons
to believe now that the problems are in the kernel serial drivers. I've had
a hunch about this since my original problem cropped up in the new tty code
when it came out, but all my previous indications seemed to point to DOSEMU.

I've run Minicom and called the odd host that I need to talk to with 7E1
parity (I really have to call it using 7-mark-1 but 7-e-1 gives mostly
correct results) under Linux 1.0.9 and Linux 1.1.49 -- *nothing* had changed
in these two tests except the kernel version (and the two kernels are
configured identically in terms of any options or patches):

Under Linux 1.0.9 I get these results calling 7E1:

* settings set to 38400,7,e,1, kernel 1.0.9
CONNECT 9600

??ENTER SWITCH CHARACTERS

The "S?" and "??" you see are high order ASCII characters from calling 7E1
instead of 7M1... They're not supposed to be there under 7M1, but under
kernel 1.1.49 and the *exact* same configuration I get:

* settings at 38400,7,e,1, kernel 1.1.49

A new release of the package has been uploaded on to :

ftp.procyon.com:/pub/linux/shadow/shadow-mk.tar.gz

This release has the source code for the login.secure program mentioned
by bjdouma@xs4all.nl  (Bauke Jan Douma) . The program is abosolutely harmless
and the earlier posts were just an over reaction. If you already have the
package installed from before today, then you do *not* have to get rid of
your /bin/login [which is login.secure] . /bin/login in the mk package
is a wrapper type of program that gets rid of the original /bin/login security
holes of -froot and -h.

Also in this package, the file perms have been fixed for the /bin/login and
/bin/_login files. If you have :

/bin/login as mode 4711 and
/bin/_login as mode 4755

then please change this to

/bin/login as mode 4511 and
/bin/_login as mode 4500

For those of you curious about the login.secure program, the original posting
with the source code is available on ftp.procyon.com in the directory
/pub/linux/shadow as login.secure.gz . As mentioned before, the source code is
also available in the latest release of shadow-mk.

OpenDoc is a framework for linking, embedding, and distibuting documents in applictions
across platforms.   The main competing technology is OLE2.  Component Integration
Labs is the company founded by Apple, IBM, Wordperfect and others to manage this technology.
Development of a Linux version of this programming framework would open the possibility
of many commercial OpenDoc applications being developed with Linux versions.

If anyone is interested, they can get information about the technologies from
ftp:\\ftp.cil.org\pub\cilabs.  Then contact Jed Harris.

I worked with VMS for about 2 years. Coming from a Unix background I
couldn't come to terms with having multiple file versions cluttering
up the directory. So eventually my subconsious would make me type
PURGE after any command without thinking about it. So in this case I
was suffering the bad performance but not getting any benefit. I
still prefer RCS/SCCS for version control and think that the filesystem
doing version control is stupid. But that's MHO.

I think the 'ld -r' is what is meant by incremental linking. This allows
several .o files to be linked into another .o file rather than an
executable file. This is an alternative to creating an archive library
.a file. In the first case the .o file isn't scanned but is included
in whole, the .a file is scanned for any modules that are needed.

Subject: A fix for the mke2fs - floppy bug
Date: 8 Sep 1994 00:45:27 GMT


Hi,
   the bug which causes mke2fs to produce bad floppy disks has been
bugging me, so I decided to have a quick look at it.

   The problem is due to the way in which requests are queued in the
kernel.  A new request is merged with an existing request whenever
possible.  This leads to a "race" condition with the existing floppy
code if the merging amounts to "prepending" a new request to the
request which is currently being processed by the floppy code.

   I can't claim to understand the intent of the authors, but I am not
sure that it makes much sense to "prepend" stuff to the request which
is currently being processed.  Appending can have advantages if the
block device is one which is accessed sequentially, such as is the
case with data on a track of a disk.

   The following patch fixes the floppy problem with mke2fs.  I don't
think that it can introduce a new bug...

Subject: Debugging TCP connections
Date: 8 Sep 1994 00:45:32 -0400

Since upgrading to 1.1.49, I have been having various problems with
networking, mostly with TCP connections flaking out on me...

(I also have been having nfs server/client problems, so it may not be a
TCP problem, but what makes me think that it is is that one connection
will freeze, while others will continue to operate properly.).

How would one go about debugging this kind of thing?  Is there any way
to get at the "status" of a TCP connection -- i.e. how long since an
apparently lost packet was retried, etc.

This may be due to some changes I made to fix a bug in the lance.c
driver (better changes are in the works), but it does not appear that
that is the case (my changes only are effected when a transmit timeout
occurs, and this case is logged,  I have not seen these timeouts when
the TCP problems happen.

Thanks for any help!
