No bridging is normally slower than routing as you process more packets
at the software level.

Subject: PCnet32 ("LANCE") PCI ethernet card with Linux.
Date: 29 Sep 1994 00:56:22 -0400


A few quick notes on getting PCnet32/PCI boards to work with Linux:

0. Use the new driver from my machine.  It can be anonymously NFS mounted.
beowulf.gsfc.nasa.gov:/linux/drivers/net/lance.c
  or 'ftp'ed
beowulf.gsfc.nasa.gov:/pub/linux/drivers/lance.c

The driver in 1.1.51 should work as well, but the earlier ones probably won't.

1a. Find the address that your BIOS put the ethernet card at.  The way I did
it was the running the following command as 'root':
        od -A x -t x /dev/port | grep 57
The board will appear with the ethernet address in the first six bytes, and
'57' in bytes.

1b. Add this address to the probe list at the top of lance.c.
[[ These steps won't be necessary when I integrate Drew's PCI-BIOS32 code
into the new PCnet32 driver, but that's not done yet. ]]

2. Build and install a new kernel with the "LANCE" driver selected.

3. Configure your PCI slot for *edge triggered* interrupts.  On the ASUS
SP3G this means moving the jumpers rather than just changing the BIOS.

If you don't do this you machine *will* hang when autoIRQ is done.  With
level-triggered interrupts you must clear the interrupt line or disable the
interrupt.  The current autoIRQ code doesn't do this.

4. The board will be detected as PCnet32/VLB instead of the PCnet32/PCI.
This is harmless.  (The driver follows the datasheet, but the hardware
doesn't :^< )

5.  Ping away!

"... and the answer is..."

Although several people responded to my post, no one really had an answer 
I hadn't tried before. :(  In searching throught the SCSI-HOWTO, however, 
I *did* come across a note that proved to be the answer to the problem.

Around line 840 or so, there appears three lines of code like thus:

        DATA = ...
        CONTROL = .... |
                        (stuff...);

Swapping the order from DATA, CONTROL to CONTROL, DATA worked.

Thanks to all who emailed with suggestions!!

Reply-To: Alan@feddev.demon.co.uk
Date: Fri, 30 Sep 1994 15:09:25 +0000

I have a couple of applications running that I suspect are 
'leaking' sockets.
  First: are there any tools that will let me look at what sockets 
are allocated? Netstat only seems to show sockets that are connected
to something.
  Second: (This might be the cause of the problem...) I am using 
shutdown(fd,2), to close the (TCP/IP) sockets, because I don't want
them hanging around. Do I have to then do a close(fd) to actually
get rid of the socket? All the documentation I have says that the
shutdown is equivalent to the close but doesn't wait even if the 
protocol gives guaranteed delivery. It doesn't say anything about 
having to close the socket afterwards...
  Info: System is Slackware 2, with the kernal recompiled to allow
for 512 sockets. There are three applications on this box, all 
designed to run continuously, and all using the socket interface. 
We have no idea which one (if it is only one!) is misbehaving!
  Any help gratefully received.

I am interested in using an Ungerman Bass Ethernet card, model UB NIU PC/EOTP.
However, I do not seem to be able to locate information regarding linux and
this card.  My searches have yielded nothing. If anyone has used, or knows
about compatibility of this card, I would greatly appreciate it. It is possible
that the card emulates a 3com or something else more predominant, and I would
love to hear from you if you know anything about these Ungerman-Bass cards as
they relate to Linux.  Thanks!

D-Link supports open environments and gives out the low-level programming

Some people have been able to return the Xircom parts via some sort of

A trick that Amiga users could tell you about (causes problems with older

a silent drive that detects insertion, or a very noisy drive that could

No, the motor doesn't need to spin (at least on the Amiga), and you can poll

I can't say for certain that this would work, but I do know of people that

18-20 feet sounds OK to me... that will easily reach any machine installed in 
my 10x13 office... and then some... and SCSI2 extends the distance....

Drive access conflicts are no problem... the drive will return a busy status 
until the first access completes and the Linux driver has auto retry on busy 
(Nice SCSI Driver Code) so the request will complete after the other machine 
finishes it's access to the device.... small performace hit.. but no huhu

So back to SCSI/NET:

        Drew Eckhart just mailed me and suggested that we take this thread to 
E-Mail or the SCSI channel on the Mailing List.. and I agree... cause I think 
we could hack this idea out in 4-6 weeks max.. (plus a packet driver for ASPI 
compatible SCSI devices on PC's maybe???)

Someboby tell me where the mail list server is, and let's meet there
(or should I start up a server here just for SCSI/NET fanatics???)

Actually, something liek this is currently being done w/Fibre Channel.  There
are currently standards for doing both IP _and_ SCSI over fibre channel, and
I believe they are also considering both IP and SCSI on the same fabric 
(though, there, you get into some security problems).  Someone I'm working
with is considering writing a driver to do both IP and SCSI simultaneously
out of a fibre channel port.

I'm still trying to convince them to 'loan' me a PCI-FC and an EISE-FC
card so that I can develop a driver for linux & osf/1 (pentium & alpha
machine at home - heh - home area network - 256Mbps, connection to the
net, 28.8Kbps ;).

Subject: EXTREMELY ALPHA ARCnet drivers ready for testing
Date: 30 Sep 1994 01:53:50 GMT

Yes, here it is... for those of us who have been waiting such a long time!

I have written ARCnet drivers for Linux.  Present testing version is 0.10
ALPHA.  Here's the info.

NOTE:  If you are afraid of ALPHA drivers, then you should be especially
        afraid of this one.  It is in early stages, and while it works quite
        well for ME, no one else I know has made these work. (of course, no
        one else I know has ARCnet cards :)

NOTE:  Installation is difficult at the moment.  This is for two reasons:
        a) because I'm far too lazy to make diffs; and
        b) because this way only people who are reasonably computer literate
           will try to install the drivers.  If you aren't, then please wait
           for a beta or a real release (which should be part of the kernel)

NOTE:  These drivers aren't compatible with ARCether for DOS, yet.  Close,
        but not quite.  Anyone interested in tweaking, go ahead, but please
        send me the patches so we can stay organized.

NOTE:  There are various other bugs.  Please read the top of the arcnet.c
        file for more information.

NOTE:  This driver was tested only on kernels 1.1.45 and higher, so it may
        be in your best interests to upgrade to that if nothing seems to
        work.


Installation
============

It's kind of a pain to install, since you have to edit a few kernel source
files.  Nothing too challenging if you know the least bit about C.

First, fix /usr/src/linux/config.in to include a line for CONFIG_ARCNET. 
This will make sense when you look at the other netcard entries in the file,
I hope :)

Then you have to change /usr/src/linux/drivers/net/Space.c to probe for my
arcnet at some point if CONFIG_ARCNET is defined.  This also is easy if
you look at the other entries.  The function you need is arcnet_probe.

Hmm... also you will need to edit /usr/src/linux/drivers/net/Makefile to
link in my driver.

Then it should be a simple matter of:
        make config
        make dep
        make clean
        make
And you'll be fine :)


Where do I get the drivers?
===========================

Right now, they are ONLY available via e-mail to me.  Send mail to one of
the addresses listed in my signature with the word "ARCNET" at the beginning
of the subject line, in all capitals.

If the demand gets overwhelming (how likely is THAT?) I may upload to an FTP
site.  Right now I want to control release as much as possible, since the
code may be quite dangerous (although it hasn't locked MY machine lately)
and I don't want flames from people who don't know what they're doing... :(


Where do I discuss the drivers?
===============================

My news server is weird, so the NET channel of linux-activists may be the
best idea.  Or, via direct email to one of the addresses below, or even to
this newsgroup if you're particularly lazy (but I can't guarantee I'll see
it that way)


When is a release expected?
===========================

When enough people have tried the alpha and verified the abscence of bugs. 
This isn't likely to happen soon, since even _I_ know of some bugs; however,
it does work reasonably well (ie. it IS usable for most things) and I know
there is a great demand for ARCnet drivers, so I'm releasing this now.

This is the first truly public announcement of the driver, so NO ONE BUT ME
has tried it yet; this means it is still PRE-ALPHA as far as I am concerned. 
This is your last warning... :)

I posted recently that I found a way to cleanly return
exitcodes from dip. I mirror some FTP directories via a
temporary SLIP link every morning and like to start the
SLIP/mirror process via a crontab entry, so returning a
unique exitcode is mandatory to decide whether
re-dialing is appropriate or not.

I received a couple of requests to send the patch, and
here's how I did it. It's fairly simple, though.

Here's the patch to dip-3.3.7/command.c:

   } while(running);
 
   /*NOTREACHED*/
-  exit(0);
+  exit(exitcode);
 }

============================= snip =============================

The patch is relative to dip-3.3.7 which is not the
hottest, but I found at least uri-dip-337d looks quite
similar. The line numbers probably vary, but it's
simple enough to apply manually. 

In the dip script, I now can say,

In each of the cases, dip returns the respective
exitcode to the calling shell. Re-dialing is only worth
it if the exitcode is 3 which is also returned if the
line is busy. In all other cases, I chose not to
re-dial. The shell script calling mirror-2.1 looks like
follows:

============================= snip =============================

#!/bin/sh

# call mirror via SLIP to nathan

MIRROR="/usr/local/lib/mirror/mirror"
DIP="/usr/sbin/dip"
DIP_PID="/etc/dip.pid"
DIPSCRIPTS="/conf/net/slip"
LOG="/tmp/mirror.SLIP.log"
LOCK="/usr/local/lib/mirror/mirror.lock"
PACKAGES=""
SYSTEM=nathan
CMDLINE="$0 $*"

DATE() {
        date +"%d.%m.%y %H:%M:%S"
}

log()
{
        echo $*
        echo `DATE` $* >> $LOG
}

[...]

# call dip and evaluate exitcode; re-run via at(1) if necessary
$DIP $DIPSCRIPTS/$SYSTEM.dip  
RESULT="$?"
case "$RESULT" in
        "0") ;;
        "1") log "modem does not respond" 
             exit $RESULT 
             ;;
        "2") log "dial failed" 
             exit $RESULT 
             ;;
        # the next one applies for BUSY as well ...
        "3") echo "$CMDLINE" | at now + 2 minutes > /dev/null 2>&1
             log "no CONNECT message within timeout"
             log "setting up at job \"$CMDLINE\""
             exit $RESULT 
             ;;
        "4") log "no login: message" 
             exit $RESULT 
             ;;
        "5") log "no password: message"
             exit $RESULT 
             ;;
        "6") log "no SLIP string"
             exit $RESULT 
             ;;
        *)   log "unknown exitcode from dip: $RESULT"
             exit $RESULT
