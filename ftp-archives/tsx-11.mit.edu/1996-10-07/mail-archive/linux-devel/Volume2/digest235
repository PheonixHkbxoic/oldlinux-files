This is something I've been wondering about.  It appears to depend
on which SCSI HA you are using.  In looking for a solution to my 
instability problems with Buslogic BT445S/DEC DSP3107LS, I noticed
a comment in the buslogic driver that seemed to indicate it expects
the extended Translation to be switched ON.

Mine is OFF and I wonder if this is causing my instability problmes
(various crashes and kernel panics, different symptoms all the time).
I've been considering trying to turn the Translation ON, but this
(according to the Buslogic manual) means I need to reformat the
disk, and I haven't had time to do that kind of job (reformat, reinstall,etc).

This seems to be the question of the week.

If the card emulates two seperate IDE controllers (one at the primary 
addresses & IRQ and one at the secondary) then it will work with the
ATDISK2 patches.  One such card is the DTC 22XX controllers which I 
had working fine with my Linux box.

I have a PROMISE 4030VL-2 controller which is like the BT410A described
above and have not been able to get it to work for < 2 drives.  (I even

Perhaps information on what 4 drive cards are compatible with ATDISK2 and
which are not should go into the FAQ.  It would have saved me some
grief.

What's the best PCI Graphics card (or VL bus) that you can get (budget, or
otherwise) which will not cause problems when running Linux & X, and will
give smashing performance under Windows/DOS.

Secondly what's the determines whether one CD-ROM drive works with Linux or
not - is it the actual drive or the interface ? (I assume the latter), and
if it's the interface which interfaces will work ? What about 3x & 4x drives ?

Finally, Hard disk drives & their interfaces - similar to question above.


Hopefully someone out there can help me out - I'm putting my decision upon
which m/c to buy on hold until I'm better informed.

Nonsense. At most, it needs to be done a bit more carefully. Look at

So what? It's what we have. If you wait for the ideal chips to come

Maybe you don't. I do. One of the main reasons to use Linux, instead
of something else, is the performance. Kill that, and a lot of people
will start to discover that BSD is more standard... and SCO is more
supported (by 3rd-party commercial outfits, if not by SCO itself.)

If this attitude prevails, it might well be time to switch to NextStep
or Solaris.

Subject: Incremental linking for quick compile/link/debug cycle
Date: Tue, 27 Sep 1994 14:21:44 GMT

Debugging often involves a number of edit/compile/link/debug cycles.
While the current tools (gcc, ld, ld.so...) are flexible and produce good
code they are not optimized for turnaround time. I would like to be
able get the edit/debug cycle down to a few seconds for large X applications.

Presumably you can easily know the modified files and those which need
recompiling (through make or hooks in the editor). From that, new .o files
are produced and must be "incrementally" added to the executable.

The dld library could load the new .o files but, as far as i remember,
will not redirect symbols in the original executable to use them. Furthermore,
the process continues where it was instead of starting a fresh run.

The debugger, gdb, allows you to "add-symbol-file" when a new .o file is
loaded. It already knows about symbols. Perhaps gdb should be taught about
appending .o files to the executable and processing the relocation information
in order to perform the incremental link and then run.

The most realistic solution is probably to keep the linker running and have
the output executable file memory mapped; all the symbol tables are already
in core. Then the linker would receive instructions to add some .o files.
It would take only a second or two to append the new .o files and redirect
any references to these symbols to the new .o files. This being done in
the memory mapped file, gdb sees the new executable and needs only be told
to "add-symbol-file" at the appropriate address for the added .o files.

Is anyone working on something like that? Will that be easier with ELF?
Comments and suggestions welcome!!

Subject: IPC bugs in 1.0.9/Slackware 2.0?
Date: Tue, 27 Sep 1994 16:35:06 GMT

I have been doing some porting work to Linux, and have encountered some
oddities in the System V IPC facilities.  I am using the latest
Slackware 2.0 distribution, which uses revision 1.0.9 of the Linux
kernel.  Whenever I have shared memory, semaphores, or message queues
allocated, the "ipcs" command encounters a memory fault error.  If
I say "ipcs -u", I get a valid summary of the resources allocated.
Is this a known problem?  In addition, when the process which allocated
the semaphores exits, it does a semctl(IPC_RMID) which apparently fails
to deallocate the semaphore.  I need to investigate this one a bit more,
but does it seem familiar?

One thing that is odd about our IPC resources is that the "uid" and "gid"
is changed to a non-existent user and group.  The "cuid" and "cgid" are
left alone.  I don't know if that provides a hint.

By the way, is the way "optind" is set in C on this version of Linux
a bit unusual?  It seems like it starts at a different place than
on most Unix systems.

Thanks for any advice anyone can offer.

Actually there are some higher powered applications in this frequency range,
i.e. Amateur Radio (906-928?? Mhz.), some locating devices, etc. and these
lower power devices must accept interference from these other applications.
Interestingly this is an area where Amateur TV is active, and some of the

range.

On the contrary --- the slower the medium, the worse the performance
with synchronous I/O.  While synchronous mounting may be slow but
acceptible with HD's, it would make floppies almost unusable.

Does anyone know if any of the adaptec SCSI-drivers will work with
"Adaptec AIC-7870 Fast and Wide SCSI interface connected to the
processor via the PCI bus" ?

If not, is this chip very different from the "ordinary" adaptec
SCSI controllers? Would anyone know where I can get the needed
information to write a driver?

Thanks,
