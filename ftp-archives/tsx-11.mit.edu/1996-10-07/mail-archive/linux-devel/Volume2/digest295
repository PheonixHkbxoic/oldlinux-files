I have the same problem here, and it has nothing to do with resolving names.  
I my case, when I have several people online, and I have at least 10 open TCP 
connections (mostly SMTP in/out), I sometimes seem to 'hang' when my 
Windows Eudora program attempts its 5 minute POP3 Mail request from the Linux 
server. This connection goes over Ethernet. The connection hangs for several 
minutes, while NETSTAT shows an Establised POP3 connection. However, nothing 
happens.  At such a time, I also cannot start a Telnet connection: the same 
problem, the connection get established, but there it stops.
Windows Eudora *outgoing* mail, which uses SMTP also hangs with an Establised 
connection. 

Because I thought that the problem was in the INETD program, I 
made SMAIL a stand-allone Daemon,  and guess what: It does not make any 
difference.  Incoming (at the server) SMTP still hangs in establised status.  
So, that is when INETD is *not* involved.

I also have many 'SMTP connection timed out' errors in my SMAIL logfile; I 
strongly suspect that this is caused by above problem.

This is a very serious matter for me, as I try to run a multi-line SLIP server 
here.  

Is there anyone who can look into this TCP related problem? Who should I 
approach?

Thanks, 

Bart.

After installing a new Orchid Video card I began to get the
following errors on a regular basis:

Oct  8 21:09:05 lod kernel: hdb: read_intr: status = 0x51
Oct  8 21:09:05 lod kernel: hdb: read_intr: error = 0x04

Can anyone tell me what exactly is causing this and what I need to do to

It would be trivial to modify the shell (like bash) to do this: If it

will descend into that directory and start the executable file that is

I think the person who started the gateway wants (wanted?) to keep this

Sun's Online Disksuite let's you mirror volumes.  The problem
of course is that you now need twice the disk space.  At work,
we are getting away from using disksuite (mostly because of 2
disastrous experiences upgrading OS's -- losing 10+ gigs of disk
is one way to ruin your weekend.)  The only place where we will
still use disksuite is on our news server...you pretty much
need big filesystems if you want to have long expire times.

I have had this experience with several Seagate RLL disks as well.
After a number of write or format operations the sectors just go bad.
After a short time, the critical areas on the disk (like bootblock, or
FAT area when it is for DOS) go bad, and the disk becomes unusable.

I have heard that new Seagate disks are better, but I won't see this
myself as I will never spend a dollar of my money on Seagate products
again.

The answer probably is: Yes, Linux killed your floppy drive.
When you would have used another (much more popular) operating system
for the PC, the system would have been rebooted several times a day, the
floppy would have seeked each time it went to the BIOS selftest, and dirt
would not have accumulated on the mechanism.

Don't run stable operating systems!  They may kill your drive!

Date: 11 Oct 94 11:14:25 GMT
Reply-To: pb@apd.dec.com (Peter Brouwer)

I tried to use the trim option in the /etc/host.conf file. 
I wanted to trim the domain name because I see the following lookups in the
nameserver: host.domain.domain. I heard that this is an intended behaviour.
It seems to me that this is a bit strange, one could check on the presence of a
domain in the string. Anyway in order to get rid of these queries I tried to
use trim.
I added the line: <trim: .domain> as listed in the manual pages. To my surprise
it did not work in all cases. I had to add the line <trim: .domain.> to get rid
of all the host.domain.domain queries.
Did I miss something or is this a slip in one of the resolving routines in the
libc library?

Subject: GCC version i2.5.8p dies with the following code
Date: Tue, 11 Oct 1994 16:03:51 GMT


The code at the bottom of this message crashes gcc i2.5.8p.  I am
running linux 1.1.45 on a P5/90.  It only crashes with -O3 or greater,
and only with the i2.5.8p.  Every other 2.5.8 that I try doesn't have
a problem with it.

Here is some text pasted from an xterm:

The code was originally much more complicated but I've was able to
simplify to what apears below.  If I remove any one of the three lines
in foo() the program compiles fine.

Here is the code:

struct BUFFER
{
  int offset;
  double *dta;
};

void bar(void);

void foo(struct BUFFER *buff)
{
  double data;

  data = *(buff->dta); 

  if(5 >= buff->offset)
    bar();

  *(buff->dta) = data;
}

/* End of sample code */


Any ideas?

The C compilers on AIX, Solaris, SunOS, IRIX, HPUX and Domain/OS don't
support it. If they would, they wouldn't be C compilers anymore.

They're valid C code, nevertheless. A C compiler which fails to translate

Take the NFS client approach:

unlink_fork(char *name)

        rename(name, ".non-existant-scratch-name");
        RecursivelyDelete(".non-existant-scratch-name");

- atomic enough for you ?
