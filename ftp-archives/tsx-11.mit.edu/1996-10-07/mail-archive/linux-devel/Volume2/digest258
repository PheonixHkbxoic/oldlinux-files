I have found the root cause of the  problem.  It is a call to sock_wmalloc
that keeps eating memory.  It eventually goes over the 32767 (in skbuff.h in
the linux includes).  It tends to return EAGAIN, assuming memory would be
made available eventually, which results in silent failure.  since ping,
and other utilities use different sockets, they start allocating at 0.
I can't even overallow, since it only goes to 65535 (although it is a long,
it fails at this point).

Perhaps it is not the "root" cause, since it may be the free that is failing,
or merely a fragmentation problem.  But it only seems to affect TCP based
protocols with PPP.

I hope someone knowledgeable can fix this.

I've used Magic and IRSIM, but neither is a VHDL tool.  Magic is a
simple but very easy to use layout editor.  It does on-the-fly DRC (it
uses the one variable, lambda method) and some autorouting.  I've
actually used it to produce a simple stack cpu.  It's pretty fast and
comes with a nice tutorial, but best of all is its low price - free.

IRSIM is a timing tool, a pretty simple one compared with commercial
ones, (like pearl - the only one I'm actually familiar with).  But it
works well with Magic - it does timing on the actual layout.  It can
do things like longest phase to phase delay, etc.

Anyway, you can get Linux binaries of these two from 
sunsite.unc.edu in 
/pub/Linux/apps/circuits (INDEX)
==============================================================================
irsim.tar.z              event-driven logic-level simulator for MOS circuits
magic63p3-run.tar.gz     VLSI graphical layout tool [bin]
magic63p3-src.tar.gz     VLSI graphical layout tool [src]

Magic requires X obviously.  These tools are great for learning how to
do VLSI CMOS design/layout.  I suspect they're mostly used by
university students.

I've got my roommate convinced to switch over to Linux from Unixware.  He's
running a Mylex P5/66 EISA/PCI motherboard and is using an Adaptec AHA-2940
PCI/SCSI card.  I can't find any evidence that the 2940 is yet supported by
Linux, though.  Is anyone working on a driver or kernel patch to support
this host adapter?

Subject: Xircom PCMCIA ethernet support?
Date: 3 Oct 1994 03:45:27 GMT

Is there any chance of getting support for a Xircom CE10 PCMCIA
ethernet adapter?  I heard of problems with the parallel port
adapters, they don't give out the programming info.  Is this true
of the PCMCIA adapter too?  Now that there are kernel loadable
modules, and it is possible to develop drivers without releasing
source, does that change things?
If anyone has had direct contact with Xircom and can point me to
a contact over there, that would also be helpful.
I want to get linux running on a laptop with one of these, if
I'm successful there is a potential to get linux installed on
hundreds of laptops!
Thanks,

I am getting the same type of crashes with 1.1.51.
Curiously enough, 1.1.45 works flawlessly for me, I haven't had
any problems with it.

It seems to happen in free_pages, with lots of these messages
appearing for the separate processes. If I try to log in,
I get a password prompt, but when I hit return I get a panic.

As close as I can reproduce it, these were the kernel messages:

        Yep, same problem here, especially when trying to mount a floppy.  I
went back to 1.50 and all is OK.

Perhaps it's time to create full, professional and complete docs to show how to
create drivers. Once done, copies of this can be passed out to the likes of
Adaptec, along with some evidence of the increasing commercial viability of
Linux. One such piece could be a copy of LJ...

Yes. ncr53c810 works nicely with all of them. THere are NICE drivers
for OS/2 and of course there are Drew's excellent ncr drivers for
Linux.

Well, the Linux community sneers at BSD for doing synchronous inode
updates, which you won't find in ext2fs :-)
Those can really kill performance when you are manipulating a lot of
files, like in a news system.

Conclusion: The filesystems have different characteristics, and the
performance will vary with the operations you are doing.  When you want
to know what will perform best in your situation, try them both.

But please don't try to setup a war between the two camps!

The driver needs the BIOS in order to autodetect your card at boot
time.

I use a TMC850 here (w/o BIOS) and I put the following line in Lilo
in order for the card to be detected:

append = "tmc8xx=0xCA000,5"

Where 0xCA000 (IO memory location) and 5 (IRQ) depend on your
jumpers settings (see the card for details).

Note: it's all in the driver sources! :-)

Subject: convert num to string integrating math functions
Date: 1 Oct 1994 19:10:21 GMT

Hi !

I've got a problem building a function designer program:
the only way I know to enter the function is to put
it in the source code directly.
what are the keywords to convert properly (with sin(x) and cos(x))
strings to num;
Atoi and atof don't work, 'cos they don't recognize cos(x) or sin(x)
as mathematical function but as strings.

If you can help, please email at jules@shagshag.frmug.fr.net

THANX
