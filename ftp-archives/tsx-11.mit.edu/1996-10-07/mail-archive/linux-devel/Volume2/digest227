The story of support of Flopticals is a regular one I tell to explain to
people why Linux is real.  Ages ago (close to two years) someone asked on
the net if they were supported.  Within a day someone else posted a note
that said that they required a special initialization sequence.  Then, a
day later someone else asked where they could get the initialization
sequence.  Then, a few days later there was a post explaining that the
driver was now patched to support them.  A sequence that overall took
about a week.  Expect a year or more from commercial vendors.

Now, to answer your question: flopticals are SCSI devices.  I have never
used one but there should be special initialization code in the SCSI
driver to talk to them.

Wow!  I guess I'll compile bash with ELF libraries!  When I added
-fomit-frame-pointer to my compiles of the qsort test I couldn't
tell the difference between ELF and a.out qsort times.

Patrick Schaaf (bof@wg.saar.de) mailed me a more scientific benchmark
but I haven't looked at it yet.  I'll forward it to whomever would
like a look.

Surely there must be a publicly available benchmark of system library 
calls?  If not, I was thinking of writing a quick bench of the 
more popular calls (read, write, open, close, etc) just to see
how a.out and ELF compare there.

Awesome work H.J. & co!

If ELF is so much easier to develop with, and it requires significant
effort to craft a benchmark on which a.out is faster, why bother?  I
vote for ELF.

Wow, this is all very deja-vu, with my experience in the Amiga
community.  It was always "we have X million machines out there,
why won't they port such-and-such?" or something like that.

I think the bottom line is that for the really big wizzy msdos
programs, they won't get ported.  Look for alternatives though.
Number of units doesn't count when you're regarded as a fringe
group.  Hefty contributions can change their mind though, and
is part of the reason some of this stuff gets ported to major
unix players.

> While I agree and disagree in varying amounts with the rest of this message

Here, I must agree.  Too often people want MS Word, but they're
unwilling to consider other word processors.

The number of Linux sites is *irrelevant* here!  When the Amiga
had fewer number of machines than Linux sites, there were many
commercial offerings.  When there were X million sold, people
were annoyed that big-name (but low quality) PC companies weren't
porting their stuff, but failed to note all the great companies
that were there for the Amiga.

The point is, work on your grassroots, loyal companies that have
stuff for Linux rather than complain that Word or Lotus or Autocad
or whatever the latest rage is hasn't yet been ported.

> What are we? Chopped Liver?

In many places, chopped liver is a delicacy.  It's an acquired
taste though.

However, the biggest trouble Linux has is distribution
channels.  With Amiga, it was simple - you walk into your
local Amiga store and see what was on the shelves.  Companies
had a distribution channel.  With Linux you don't have that.
You can't walk into most PC stores and get Linux stuff
(actually, I'm just guessing, since I've never been in one) ,
and there isn't a company making Linux with the budget to go
around and convince places to stock this stuff.  Linux
Journal is probably a good advertising place, but mail-order
is such a pain for most people, and impulse buys are small.
Perhaps a "Linux Developers Coop" that could produce a
brochure of products to give to software stores and such.

 I'm no programmer (yet) so hang me if I'm  way off but wouldn't it be
possible to automagically mount the floppy only when it is accessed. I
mean that you don't have  to have it mounted before  you access it  so
when you try to access it the system checks if it is mounted and if it
isn't it  gets mounted. If there's   no disk in  it you  get a flaming
error.

I applied the above patch and now I get the following during shutdown but
NOT during user execution of umount:

Unmounting file systems.....
floppy: timeout
floppy I/O error
dev 0200, sector 2
Done.

This is a known good disk.  Just to make sure, I copied the data off,
re-fdisk'ed it, ran mk2efs on it with block checking, and then ran badblocks
on it with write (and got an empty list) and finally re-copied the data back
to it.  According to the boot messages, the FDC is a 8272A.  The controler
is a WD1007 floppy/esdi hard drive controler in a 386sx-16 so I don't think
that bus speed is too high.

Anybody got any other ideas?  For now I am going to stick with 1.1.50

I think I understand the sentiment, and I agree -- ELF looks
inevitable. But keep in mind that there are others who are
not so easily convinced...

Anyway... I'm learning a lot from seeing some of the benchmarking data
-- and especially the interpretations. I encourage folks to do more
and better benchmarking.

libc is a fairly important bunch of code to optimize. Perhaps we'll
find some 1-liner optimization that will make the vast majority of
linux applications run 5% faster -- or an optimization that will make
one key application (like gcc) or one key subsystem (like TCP/IP) run
10% faster. Not likely, but worth the effort, if just for the
knowledge gained.
