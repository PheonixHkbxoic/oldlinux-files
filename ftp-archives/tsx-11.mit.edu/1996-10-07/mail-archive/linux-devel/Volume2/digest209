OK, it's an issue.  But it's bloat if it goes in the Kernel.
This situation cries out for a Kernel hook, and the ability
to have a floppy_mount_daemon that gets activated when the
user puts in a floppy (periodic disk-change check?).  This
program could be a shell script, for all I care, that does
some magic with "file" or some other tools, connects with
some glossy X-based file manager, whatever.  All this is
*not* Kernel functionality, although it may need a Kernel
patch or two to make it viable.

Personally, I would never run such a daemon.  I know people
who would, though.  Any volunteers to write such a beast?

        Richard's proposal is to use the same library-to-address
mapping for all processes, as in the current shared libraries, but to
dynamically allocate the address offset during runtime loading.  Once
a library has been loaded, its address would be fixed (for all
processes in the system) until it is unused and unloaded (if unloading
is implemented).  After the loader fixups are complete, a library's
code pages would be unchanging and would, in fact, be sharable between
processes.

        One downside to this approach is that the library pages,
although shared, are initially "dirty", and must be paged to swap
space rather than discarded and refreshed from the filesystem copy.
Other possible problems are the runtime expense of the relocating
loader, and the disk space needed for the relocation information.  If
you can afford the swap space, these are not necessarily bad tradeoffs
with proper tuning.

        Tuning is the critical issue.  If you have plenty of swap
space and library address space, you want the leave relocated, loaded
libraries lying around in swap even when they aren't being used.  If
you are low on swap space, or library address space, you might want to
use "oldest" or "largest" or some metric combining these to select the
library to evict.  You might want to have a system startup program
preload a list of libraries to improve hater performance.

:       * I heard emacs excercised some problems with the ELF tools.
:               Anyone care to elaborate?

        Yes, I don't know how many people know what emacs does when it
gets built. First, a binary called 'temacs' gets compiled, all this is
is Lisp interpreter + I/O routines, no editing whatsoever. This gets
executed with a bunch or lisp libraries to load, once the editing code
is loaded, it dumps its core image into an executable. This is asking
for trouble when dealing with alpha/beta shared libs and compilation
tools. Me and eric got one to execute by hacking on the elf-dynamic
loader, so we at least know why it was failing at first.
        Just yesterday I gave it a try with 4.6.9 and 4.6.10, of
course since 4.6.9 did not have termcap, etc., it would not link at
all. Now temacs links but segfaults after loading a few libs then
libc.so, it does crazy system calls for some reason, I am
investigating whether the linker is getting passed bad arguements or
the wrong object files.
        To complicate matters, the existing code in the emacs source
tree which knows how to dump emacs uses mmap() with PROT_WRITE +
MAP_PROTECT which is a lose under linux, I had to use MAP_PRIVATE and
do a HUGE ugly write() right before the mapper file descriptor gets
closed. It works, but hopefully when elf has matured a bit, the mmap
facilities will be in the kernel.

Summary: Emacs can be built, it's been done, but we need to tune
things.

   Although I don't mount minix floppies, I have received a nearly identical
'oops' error followed by a Seg Fault and a full crash of the system using
kernel 1.1.45.  Although this involved moving the /etc directory around, and
I was asking for it, I got the error after immediately attempting to reboot
using the 'reboot' command.  I don't know if this is significant, or whether
the error is one common to all lower kernels, but I hope this helps.

What if they did something like on the sgi's, where you can specify 
a mount point for dos disks, and run a daemon that will mount the floppy
automagically (at least, for a dos disk).  Pretty neat though.  Perhaps
if we had something like that for msdos disks only, all others needing
to be mounted manually (therefore, by root)?

Except that even this doesn't solve everything.  Even places with good
portable code restrict what machines they actually port to (and thus
maintain, purchase machines for, test on, maintain distributions for,
etc).  What counts is actual users or expected users.  It certainly
helps to have POSIX though once the boss says to support a new

: thing like Internet can be trully free and available to individuals and
: "without having to pay excessive fees" - I think it would be very
: much along the lines under which the HAM radio was founded. It's just
: that there were NO computer networks these days....

Amateur Radio was never designed for this purpose.  It's not now and 
never will be the internet of the future.  It's for radio experimentation,
not utilitarian use by the general public.  That's what the telephone 
company and the internet is for.  And....if you want that kind of support,
and to carry that kind of comercial traffic, you have to pay.  All those
things are strictly disallowed on Amateur Radio, which is as it should be.

: : Amateur radio is not intended for this purpose, and by allowing such
: : use of the spectrum the original identity of amateur radio is lost.  Then
: The original identity of the HAM radio is to be at the frontier and
: benefit the humanity - and free of charge... It's public service -
: running a NON-COMMERCIAL network on top of that is no contradiction.

Internet material is VERY commercial, at least in the context of this 
discussion.  Sure, Linux is free, and that's cool.  It's WAY to big
to send over packet (by orders of magnitude), but hey.  Now, I try to
go get it off ftp.cdrom.com and the banner tells me that they have a 
new product for sale.  Since I originated the connection, I'm (technically)
in violation of my radio license.

: : it will be ever more difficult to keep the parts of the spectrum that
: : the commercial communications providers are interested in, because they
: : can easily point at this "unfair competition".
: Competition should serve the humanity - not vice verse. Competition
: is just a vehicle - not an aim in itself. In my opinion - commericial
: providers have unfair advantage of being able to use a spectrum - to
: no benefit of mine... If you look at HAM radio you'll see that it's
: not a technical problem to implement a high speed backbone for a packet
: network, will not take any existing spectrum (how much is spectrum
: above 1GHZ used really - if there is almost no commercial HAM equipement
: on the market for higher then 1.2 GHZ)

Well, there you go.  Another guy that buys equiptment "on the market".
You've missed the point.  Pick up a soldering iron.

: : So, the limitations on information exchange via amateur radio are a good
: : thing.  Don't view them as censorship, but as the regulations that make
: : amateur radio a possibility.

Right. But seriously, if you did'nt like the terms of your license, or
did'nt understand them, you should not have bothered with it in the first
place.  Perhaps you would be better off with a comercial radio license.

: Something - "let's thatnk the autorities and big companies that
: they let us mice exist" approach. I don't like this. 
Is'nt that too bad :-(

: Internet should be
: free and should be based on the free backbones. HAM radio spectrum is
(not fast enough, supported enough, large enough, used for
too many other things,  nd nd or generally not )

: good for that. Don't use it for commericial purposes - but Linux is
: a free projet anyway. The main idea is that free software combined
: with a free backbone can really change the world. Sure there are
: always opponets to these kind of things...
