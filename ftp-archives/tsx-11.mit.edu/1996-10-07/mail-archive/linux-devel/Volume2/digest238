I'm pretty sure I had this set up a while back, before a disk crash
wiped it out.  When you cd into the amd mount point it mounts it.
I think there might be some examples in the amd package on sunsite.

I'm glad to hear that -- perhaps the marketing types making the rounds

expected to be warmly received -- instead, I got the line I posted

Again, I'm glad to see this is not Digiboard's policy.  Maybe you could
give the marketing folks who were representing Digiboard at Interop a
call to let them know that if thay spread that sort of message, the

This arg is wrong.  You want to call:

    execl( "a.out", "a.out", NULL );

Your call to 'execl' doesn't set arg[0] to the name of the program.
Now, the kernel doesn't mind, and exec's your program.  But the
dynamic-linking stuff in the C runtime code looks for that program
name.  When it is missing, as it is in your call, the target program
interprets that as a request to print the shared library list.  It
prints this list and exits without ever calling 'main(argc, argv)'.

You sound like you know what you are talking about,  but...

Acorn's Archimedes A300 series machines had a 3 1/2 drive with a
disk change line.

Somehow (?) their operating system was able to take advantage of it
such that as you dropped a disk into the drive it would automatically
bring up a browser.  It could also ask you to change the disk in the
drive and would automatically pick up and continue as you dropped the
disk into the drive.

The drive access light/motor was *not* on whilst it waited.

Your conclusion (smail must be misconfigured) is correct, your proof
is not; the hole mentioned allows unwanted _creation_ of files in
inaccessible directories, with the file being owned by the user
(when append_as_user is set). Checking the source of transports/appendfile.c
you'll find that the attribute to set in the transport is called
'check_path'. The bug is gone now. I have no idea why that isn't the
default setting - does anybody know?

I also have one of these controllers, though I only use two drives
with it... so I'm not going to be much help.  I'm almost positive
you'll need to acquire the patch that allows you to use two IDE
controllers simutaneously.  The promise card, as far as using a 3d and
4th drive is concerned, acts like two controllers.


Have you have any trouble with your controllers, ie: system locking-up
when doing intensive (disk intensive) activities?  Mine does, but ONLY
when I have it set on defered write.  Let me know if you also have
this problem.  I think it might me related to my drive
configuration... That Promise controller doesn't like WD drives in a
two drive configuration.

That certainly was a mis-understanding...

BTW, SPX isn't available in Linux either.  It is just IPX.
IPX (and its associated routing protocols RIP and SAP) are the only
protocols publicly documented by Novell.  SPX and NCP you either have
to buy or to reverse-engineer.

If you want a protocol stack to be portable, it is not a good idea to
map header formats directly (using structures).  You will make yourself
dependent on the availability of right-sized data items, item alignment,
and the correct byte order.  Variable-length headers are also a pain
in this scheme.

It is better to use conversion functions from "network format" headers
to "host format" structures.  In that case the exact size of the data
items is much less of a problem, as long as they are large enough to
hold the number of bits defined in the protocol.

Whats wrong with the one that comes with the compiler and (if installed

Subject: Driver support for PS/2 (MCA) version of SMC/WD?
Date: Tue, 27 Sep 1994 04:47:05 GMT

I have been working on getting Linux up and running on an IBM PS/2 Model
70, which has not been an enviable task, to say the least!  But, beggars
can't be choosers, either.

I have no problem with the Adaptec AHA-1640 SCSI host adapter, which Linux
detects and uses as an AHA-1542.  My 1.7GB SCSI-2 drive and 2GB Archive tape
drive work flawlessly under Linux.

Which leaves me stuck with the following problem:  network support.  I
originally had an NE/2 adapter in this machine, which was not supported by
Linux at all.  For that matter, the Crynwr packet drivers for the NE/2
under DOS don't work either (Russ Nelson says he hasn't tested them).

So, to make a long story short, I was able to scrounge an IBM PS/2 Ethernet
Adapter /A.  This is a microchannel version of an SMC Ultra, from what I
have been able to tell.  Under DOS, the same SMC_WD.COM packet driver is used
for this card, as for an ISA based SMC Ultra or WD8013.  Biggest difference
is that the I/O port address range is up at 0x800, rather than 0x300 - no 
big deal, and the RAM address is fixed in the PS/2 setup program.

Problem is, even with the 0x800 I/O port range added to the scan list in the
WD.C and SMC-ULTRA.C kernel driver, the card just doesn't work right (under
Linux - works fine under DOS).  I get TX status 3 (timeout on TX) when
attempting to access the network.

Looking through the Crynwr packet drivers shows that there are differences
between operation of the NS (8390?) chip used on these boards on the ISA
vs. MCA bus.  Specifically, the MCA bus has twice as fast a clock cycle as
the ISA bus.  The Crynwr driver inserts extra delays if it detects operation
on a Microchannel machine.  Other differences are some extra setup in
certain registers on the NIC's ASIC.

Has anyone done this work already?  I.e., does anyone have Linux working
with an IBM Ethernet /A?  If so, PLEASE share it with me!

If not, then I intend to rewrite the SMC/WD kernel drivers in Linux to
support the microchannel version, as my contribution to the Linux
community.  I just hate to duplicate the work, or spend time I don't
have on this project...

Thanks!
