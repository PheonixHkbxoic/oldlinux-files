Hello,
I have uploaded a BETA release of xpat2 (the sequel to xpat) to
mo.math.nat.tu-bs.de in /pub/in.
It should look like
-rw-r-----   1 ftp      other     301444 Sep 29 14:57 xpat2-1.00-beta2.tar.gz

(Sources only, you need the xpm library to compile it)

I am interested in bug reports, before I upload to tsx and sunsite.
There is one bug known: On systems short of memory, parts of the window
are not redrawn completely after a window resize event. I cannot find
the bug, however. Hints are welcome.
Any volunteer to improve the french translation?

       Michael

Hmm... This seems to be a question of definition. _I_ have always
thought that a word is defined as two bytes, or 16 bits, independent of
machine. But I don't know...

Anyway, int in Linux is 32-bit, short is 16-bit, and char is 8-bit, if
that helps any...

Subject: unique timestamp in kernel code?
Date: Wed, 28 Sep 1994 21:40:22 GMT

Is there any possibility to create an unique timestamp (e.g. when the
disk last time was changed) when running kernel code?

Ad hoc I use jiffies, but jiffies are unsigned long, I read in
limits.h: ULONG_MAX -> UINT_MAX = 2^32.  That is expressed in days
about 497 days. (Based on 100HZ (100 jiffies / second).)  May be, it
doesn't matter anything, but it would not be very clean....

Subject: Re: 1+ Gig SCSI Drives //
Date: 29 Sep 1994 01:19:08 GMT

To clarify, the problems I cited occur in biosparam, which only affects fdisk.
If you use the whole drive, you won't call biosparam, so you won't run into
the problem.

Secondly, the problem is more a conflict with coexisting DOS partitions.
DOS processes the track/cyl/sector information as I noted, normally
different below/above 1Gb.  If the linux biosparam doesn't follow the
same rule, either linux or dos or both will get very confused.

Telnet will quit sending characters after about 1 minute when I am using
ppp.  I put some print debugs in the telnet code and found that it is reading
the keyboard, and fills the output-to-net queue, but the queue never gets
sent out after a given point.

Has anyone else experienced this, and is there a fix?

Dear friends,

   I am trying to port a system from SunOS to Linux. The porting
has been a breeze except for the fact we dont have libdl available.
   The system depends on dlopen and dlsym, since C++ code is generated
at run-time and then linked to the application.
   Does anybody is working in the port of libdl???
   Does anybody had already faced the same problem? If so, how it had been treated?
   Does anybody has an idea on how to solve the problem???

Thanks for your attention.

I've been using A model card from Nov -92 and used almost *every* single

Now I'm running 1.1.49 and have no plans to upgrade before Linus
comes back from down-under and before Eric has settled down and
checked these rumours. I have no time to mess things
up, if there is really a bug in 1.1.5x, but i can't just believe
that adaptec cards have suddenly stopped working properly under
Linux. The problems must be on hw side or in kernel driver code.

All adaptec cards except 1542C-preF that had problems with shielding
are far more superior than the most of the other cards i have seen, 
both in quality and reliability (allthoug BusTek has better price
/performance factor), that's my opinion (not a Flame!) 

The problems in most cases are between the keyboard and the chair.

No one should have to "decide" for the masses. It is totally up to you.
For example you can currently run a QMAGIC and ZMAGIC binary on your system
and as far as you're concerned you shouldn't have to worry about the binary
type. ELF is just another binary type. Clearly there will be a bias (i.e.
future libc's and most shared libraries etc.. will be ELF) so you should be 
oblivious of the fact that ELF is being thrust upon you.

Nothing has to be recompiled unless you want to. Clearly there is a
performance decrement if you have both an ELF and DLL libc in core ,so yes
it would be a wise idea to recompile things - but this can be done at your
own pace. I assume the next distribution from vendors like Slackdare and
SLS will probably be ELF based.

Central Point's CPBACKUP does something that keeps the drive's light
lit, but the drive doesn't seem to make any noise.  As soon as a
disk is inserted, the program picks up.  I guess CPBACKUP is polling
something...

I don't really know much about this in general - I just thought I'd

We have a Maximum Duette MO drive which is really a Matsushita.
We heard that the company (Maximum) went belly up or absorved by another.
Can't remember exact capacity but about 1 Gb (500 Mb per side), and
works with v1.19 and DTC 1542 clone. As you expect, no special driver
required. Only did some tests, though. No guarantee from me.
