I do not want to get to high up on my soap box, but

I will be as open minded about their software
as they are with their software (ie. source code),
I could care less about their srink-rape-ware.

Now where is their source code, ... oh, I see...
So much for being open minded.  :(

Sure, if you poor enouph mega-bucks at something, it has got to be
good, sooner of later.  But try doing it for free.  Now do you see why
Linux is more then a just "a very good OS".
Being "very good", is ok, but linux is Free.
It is more like a movement.

(I just posted an almost identical copy of this and then realized that
it had an error.  I cancelled the first one, but in case it got out
ahead of the cancel, note that the only difference is that this one
shows the common block name as revised to "x" instead of "a".
While I'm at it, I changed the subject to be more appropriate).

You caught me on that one.  Ok, I'm out at work now where I found a copy of
some notes a co-worker made on it.  I see that I left out one critical
feature - the common block and the array had the same name.  The
translated C code from f2c then used the same name for 2 conflicting
purposes.  This is one place that f77 specifically does allow the
same name to be used twice.  Changing the code would have been trivial
in principle, but problematic in practice because these common blocks
were part of the interface definition between the core program and
user-supplied subroutines - several different users have customized
versions of the user-supplied routines, and they don't always even tell
me when they do a customized version.  The co-worker did note that
the code ran correctly if the source was patched to change the
names so that the common block and array name were different.

I've reinstalled a newer Linux version subsequent to when I was testing
this, and I haven't put f2c on the new installation yet.  I'd do it
tonight except that my cdrom drive is out for warrantee repairs
(for the second time - grumble - perhaps I should have just gotten
a cheap drive instead of putting out for a Nec 3xi).  Would you try
the following modification of the above sample for me?

    common /x/ a,b,c
    real x(3)
    equivalence (x(1),a)

The only change is that the common block name chanhed from "com" to "x".

I've uploaded a new version of my 53c400 (T130B) Scsi patches. They are
functionally identical to the previous set but some of the patches in the
40's affected the NCR code and my patch stopped working flawlessly. Here is
the .lsm entry

Title:          Patch to Linux 1.1.49+ for 53c400/t130b scsi
Version:        1(beta)
Entered-date:   18/8/94
Description:    These patches allow the Trantor T130B and any other
        NCR53c400 based card to work with the Generic NCR5380 SCSI driver
        under Linux. Ineterupts and PSEUDO-DMA are supported. This will
        become part of the development kernel eventually.
        This also includes some patches from Drew Eckhardt to do with
        resets and aborts as well as some timing issues. I couldn't be
        bothered separating them out. They'll all go in eventually anyway.

I'll not disagree that this individual has a problem.  None of us need that
sort of hassle, whether we're familiar w/that kind of language or not.
 
However, you seem to have some misconceptions about shareware.  Several weeks
is hardly enough time to get decent exposure, let alone see decent returns.
You can expect that even the best of shareware needs anywhere between three
months to a year before seeing significant returns.  It's gotten much
shorter than it was years ago, due to more folks being online & due
to CD-ROM distributions, but it is still not retail.  I guess you could
say that the time & money saved in the marketing stages are payed for
waiting for the response.  There is no free lunch.  (Free Linux yes; free
lunch, no)  This is not to say that you will ever see returns on your
product.  But to say that shareware isn't effective is silly.  Try to
explain to Ferrari that they never really sold those Testarosas to the
boys at Id.  Or explain to Bob Wallace's accountant that all those numbers
that he deals with are imaginary.  Software in general is a less than
wonderful business.  Most of what is sold is dross, and a vast amount of
what is used is pirated.  Tit for tat, you might say.  Even this wonderful
freeware concept is a pain in the proverbial ass.  If I want to develop
shareware for Linux, I either have to become an expert in license 
interpretation, write my own development tools, or hope that rms & co. take
pitty and grant another "exception", thus complicating the license issue
further.  Enough of that, tho...that's fodder for another news group.

        Correction. In both the SGI and the Linux version, there are
sound effects, but no background music. I have a SB16 basic and the
effects are loud and clear. I can barely hear the doom baseline in the
background but its barely there.

To make a long story short, if you are trying to escape any codes outside
0-31 with the escape option on the linux side of a PPP link, then you
should be having problems.  I think I have found a nasty bug that resets
all of the extended escape codes.  This will cause you to have intermittent
hangs in telnet and especially binary FTP transfers, depending on what
you are escaping.  Since I'm not sure if the patch I made messed up
anything else I'll not post it publically.  If you know what you are 
doing and want to know the fix, fell free to E-mail me at
jil@iastate.edu.   As soon as I get a chance, I'll send this to someone
that can verify that what I've done is correct.

mvmampc66 tom:~/test$ cat com.f
      COMMON /X/ A,B,C
      REAL X(3)
      EQUIVALENCE (X(1),A)
      X(2) = 1.2

mvmampc66 tom:~/test$ f2c com.f && cc com.c -lf2c -lm && ./a.out
com.f:

So it appears to work...

If I look at the generated C code, I find the following:

struct {
    real a, b, c;
} x_;

/.../
#define x ((real *)&x_1)

so the problem appears to be fixed.

Actually, the last could be handled better (for debugging purposes)
by specifying

    real *x = ((real *)&x_1)

Hi together.

Just half an hour ago, I compiled the latest 1.1.50 kernel version.
During bootup, I got the following message:

Memory: 12956k/16384k available (624k kernel code, 384k reserved, 2420k data)

So what is the data block? wasn't there in the previous versions, and it
is 'eating' 2.4 Meg of my memory! I used to have a total of ~15MB.
Is it a bug or a feature? and if its a feature, what is it doing?

And, at last, sorry if it's the wrong group, but who if not the
developers do know about it?

Thanks for any info,

Subject: IDEA: Energy saving features for harddisks
Date: Mon, 12 Sep 1994 23:27:13 GMT

Hi,

  Is there anybody working on energy saving features for Linux?
More specifically, has anyone tried to use the "power-off" features
found in most IDE and SCSI disks.
  For example, the START_STOP command can be used to turn off the
motor on most SCSI drives (I've tried this on my 20MB Mac drive,
which is quite old, so I think most drives should support this). And
the IDE command set contains half a dozen commands which look promising
(E0 - Standy, E1 - Idle, ... E5 - check power mode ...).
  If nobody else is working on this, I'd be interested in trying to
implement this myself, the problem is that I'm not really sure of
where to begin, so any pointers would be appreciated.
  I could probably use some more information about the IDE command
set too, all I've got so far is a copy of a table from BYTE which
contains codes and names, and nothing more.
  And wouldn't it be great to be able to proudly say "Linux supports
the EPA (or whatever the latest three letter acronym is) specification."

  /Christer (y93chrwe@und.ida.liu.se)

blubbering_about_ideas(TRUE)
    I should probably try to implement an IOCTL in the
  scsi disk or IDE disk code, which sets the "sleep timeout" for a device.
  Turning off a disk is (almost?) trivial, but when am I supposed to activate
  the drive again? Should I implement a function "activate_if_stopped(dev)"
  which would be called from just about every other function in the disk
  code or should I activate the disk when a command returns a NOT_READY
  error.

want to compile and run apps on the Linux box.  Exciting things like
accounting and other business tasks.

elvis is a pretty faithful implementation of vi although it's noticeably
slower in screen I/O than vi on a SPARC.  And that's when I'm only the
user on the linux box and there's nothing else happening on it.  And
with relatively small - 400-line - programs.

Console output under Linux was very quick and I'm sure X performance is
pretty good.  But curses performance is a little sluggish and adding
lines near the bottom of the screen is a real killer - curses seems to
clear the screen with blank lines <then> adds the new text.

I know that curses and terminals are going the way of the dinosaur but
like the dinosaur they're going to take a long time to die.  We were
looking at what it would cost to outfit our very small office with a
PC/Mac/Unix solution that ran under Windows, MacOS, and UNIX and decided
we could live with a curses interface.

But it would be nice if it were a little quicker.  Is there a
replacement curses out there somewhere?  I checked the FAQs, How-Tos,
and Meta-FAQ and didn't see a word about curses.

Thanks!
