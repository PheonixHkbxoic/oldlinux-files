Maple is a good example because it is not THE top selling product in
it's field. The Flagship dBase clone is another good example. Companies
like Lotus and Wordperfect are too tied to DOS/Windows to be interested
in porting their products to Linux.

But there are OTHER commercial spreadsheets and word processors out
there, some of them already ported to other UNIX's, that might
have less of an investment in DOS/Windows that they would be
willing to take a chance on a Linux port.

Can you imagine somebody selling a 486 with preinstalled Linux, X Windows,
spreadsheet, word processor, etc... just like they do now with
AST and Dell systems.

You can redefine all of the key commands.  I haven't figured out
what the keycodes are supposed to be for non-ASCII keys, but you
can put the ASCII value of a normal key after the key_* tag in
the .doomrc to use that key for a keyboard command; i.e. if you
wanted to use the 'a' key for key_fire, then put 97 after the
key_fire tag in your .doomrc.

I upgraded my Linux 1.0.9 kernel with the Voxware 2.90
distribution on sunsite (including the two provided patch files)
and I get good sound.  The only problem seems to be that I
sometimes get "delayed echoes"; a fragment of the end of a sound
will sometimes reoccur up to a couple of seconds after it
originally finished.

What I really miss is using the mouse.  I switched to using the
mouse some time ago during a period when I was doing a lot of
intense deathmatch play, and while I have gotten a little better
at using the keyboard in the Linux version, I tried running the
DOS version again with the mouse and it was _so_ much easier to
do things.  I just can't seem to find the right layout for the
key commands that lets me comfortably run, turn, strafe, and fire
all at the same time even half as well as I can with the
mouse/keyboard combination.

I see the same in my logs after restarts as well. I wonder if this has 
something to do with how the 3C509 is setup? ( it has configurable 
interrupt latency based on what speed serial port you intend on using and 
can also be setup as windows client, dos client, server)

I noticed that at some point the kernel included a newer 3c509.c with a 
rev level of 1.01. This seemed to fix the problem of having to power 
cycle the computer to make the network work when rebooting from Linux to 
windows NT or vice versa.

I gave up on this procedure. It only worked for simple code without
subroutines. As far as I can remember only variables local
to the subroutines could be accessed correctly. Most of the variables
in the heading (arrays) got messed up. I'm eagerly awaiting a true
fortran debugger.

None of these is the best solution. The best solution is to say exactly
what you mean. E.g. If you want to store numbers between -500 and +1000
you should declare this and let the compiler work out how many bits to
use. e.g. int{-500,1000} foo; int{0,65535} bar;
Naturally you could use typedef's for common ranges. This has the added
benefit of not assuming that the computer is binary, assuming one day
someone invents a non-binary computer.
In any case stating what you *really* want to do and letting the compiler
decide on the optimum number of bits has to be the best.

Check out Linux-DEU 5.21 on infant2.sphs.indiana.edu:/pub/doom/deu (fsp).

Runs under svgalib. Version 6.0 will probably run under X.

Wrong.  You may make statically linked, binary-only releases.
All you have to do is to distribute an unlinked version of your
program along the ready-to-use version.  This is not too much
of a hassle.

Linux libc has three version numbers: major, minor, and patch level.
From time to time, the patchlevel increments real fast.  The minor
version has been stable for over half an year now, and the major 4
is around for 2 years now.

I have lots of binaries linked against 4.1, and they still work with
4.5.26!

Your potential customers use 1.0, maybe 1.2 by the end of the year.
Some may use 1.1.X or 1.3.X, but most of them know, what they are
doing.  They can find out themselves, that the kernel broke their
software.

Most linuxers, that post in this group, do so.  Remember: it is
called comp.os.linux.development.  Most Linuxers by now do not
upgrade their kernel every week or two.  They install a system,
and stay with it, when it runs.  But again, these people will
not post or read to this group.

Linux problems are in the open, not hidden.  Everybody can see, what
is going on.  Companies, who do not like the truth, shall go away.
Others, who have reasonable experiences from themselves, will see,
that linux has problems as any other software.

Actually, I do not know your package.  You will have to wait, until
it spreads in the linux community.  Unlike DOOM, you cannot expect,
that 1001 people download it on the first day.

Pressing CD-ROMS is expensive in the beginning, and you may end up
with 10 people on the net being angry about your CD, writing flames.
Off goes your bussiness.

When OS/2 came out, many of your arguments were true, too.  It was
unstable, often changing, had few users, no commercial software.
And now?  It is starting to establish as a real OS.

For me it seems to work quite well, for common one uses commonname_.variable.  
The main proble I have is that my version of gcc (NeXT cc) chokes on some of 
the line breaks introduced by f2c.  Does anyone know how to tell f2c not to 
break a line between '(ftnlen' and ')'?

But I don't use "Hello World" programs. In large applications with

You're right, on an AIX 1 GB is too small. My comment above was
explicitely meant for Linux. I'm not playing with a system, I'm
working with it.

Try to run Garnet, or any other Lisp-based UI-centric
programming-by-demonstration system. And then come back and tell me
that 32MB is `more than adequate'. Sorry, but I'm not interested in
undergrad programs.

Btw, I really cannot put 128 MB in *my* VLB system. Yes, I can change
the motherboard. The last time I did this I needed three exchanges
until the kernel didn't panic any more. It's nice to have a Unix
system at home, I can even work with it; but IMO one has to see the
difference to a high-class workstation like a multi-processor Sun
SparcStation or a IBM C-10 (which are the other systems I'm using).
Yes, it's more expensive, but it's in other dimensions, as well.
