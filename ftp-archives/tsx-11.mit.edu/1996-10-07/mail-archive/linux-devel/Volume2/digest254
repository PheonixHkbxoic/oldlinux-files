Yeah, these are all conventions of block codes (e.g. 8 bits is 
one byte etc).  Convolutional codes have no fixed length, thus no 
bytes or words or nibbles...Oh and pardon me, a _WORD_ is not 
defined in ANSI C, an int is (I was using the _convetional_ 
shorthand).  Otherwise, an Intel i486 uses a 32 bit word.

No, that shouldnt be too much of a problem -- simply have the drivers
increase the output volume as the number of errors increases.

A Word in ANSI C is 16 bits (specifically unsigned) i.e. the same 
size as an int.  A long is 32 bits.  The registers of a 486DX (as 
opposed to SX) have a 32 bit capacity -- but I can't see what 
that has to do with the size of a _word_ as the OS sees it?  I 
would try 16 bits...

A few problems with this.

1. Inside Mac is not accurate all of the time.
2. Inside Mac is deficient in many ways.
3. Inside Mac is written so as to hide important details in obscure
   parts of the manuals.
3. Mac OS calls are incredibly convoluted; they force the programmer
   to do additional work to write a normal, straightforwad, healthy interface.
4. If you want as to why Inside Mac's suggestions don't work or about
   manual deficiencies, you have to pay Apple for developer support.
5. To get Linux running you can't use high level Mac OS calls; doing so
   would alleviate the need for the Linux OS.

Sure.  Set up a RAM drive in /etc/lilo.conf.

Of course, linux will use it fairly efficiently of its own if you
just let the buffer cache logic do its job.  More efficiently that
you can do with a RAM drive, probably.

I'm not sure which newsgroup this belongs in because I don't know if the
answer is just a configuration setting or requires a kernel hack.

Oh, yes, I have looked in the FAQ and HOWTO ... nothing there on this.

My hardware supports DMA only on the first 16 megabytes of RAM although
it will support up to 64 megabytes of RAM.  What I want to do is to have
Linux use only the first 16 megabytes in its usual way much as if the
machine only had 16 megabytes.  Then I want to use whatever remaining
memory above the 16 megabyte line I happen to have installed (it is OK
by me to have to code this somewhere) as a memory file system.  So if
I install all 64 megabytes of RAM I could have a 48 megabyte memory file
system.

The basic question is how to do this.  Also, do you know of any particular
problems one might encounter with this?  Is there some other scheme that
would let me utilize the extra memory to gain some speed?

        A while ago,  a friend of  mine who had a mac SE and some sort
of laser-writer that connected with a SCSI port.  When he upgraded
to a PC, he asked me if there was any way he could use the LW on the
PC, and I said no, since he had no SCSI card.  Now that *I* have a 
SCSI  card on my linux box (1542B), I was wondering if there is a
driver for scsi printers in the linux kernel, or if patches are
aviable?  Thanks!

I was not talking specifically about floppies but generally about UFS mounts
which are made not to timeout. There is nothing that distinguishes (from 
the amd point of view) a floppy and your hard-drive. This means that once amd
starts it adds your hard disk mounts to its internal table of mounts, for e.g 

% amq -m
"root"                sirius:(pid132)           root    1   localhost is up
/dev/sd0a             /                         ufs     1   localhost is up
/dev/sd0g             /usr                      ufs     1   localhost is up
/dev/sd0h             /export/home              ufs     1   localhost is up
/usr/etc/amd.home     /home                     toplvl  1   localhost is up
...etc...

Clearly I would not want the three hd ufs mounts to timeout ever.

In theory a type of "subufs" could be added to amd making these timeout(able),
so that removable media (floppys and cdroms) would fall into this category.

Does anyone have any information on Colorado Memory Systems' QFA-700 
QIC-02 controller/tape drive combo?  I purchased one for my DOS machine, 
but I'd like to be able to use it with Linux.

Problem is, Colorado Memory Systems have since discontinued the product, 
yet they aren't giving any information on programming the controller card.

I'd like to write a device driver for it, if anyone has any information 
on it.  The controller card uses Stac hardware compression, and is

Subject: DOS 6.0 Interlnk->Linux???
Date: 1 Oct 1994 04:10:05 GMT

i like linux so much it took over my computer, and now i don't even
have a dos partition....

but i am an atari jaguar developer, and i need to have dos, solution,
buy another computer, so i did, its a notebook (compaq contura aero)

i am trying to avoid paying $150+ for a PCMCIA ethernet card, (and the
ensuing dos networking software) so i would like to inquire on the
feasability of making dos's parallel port "network mounted drive" program
"interlnk.exe" work under linux (ie have a linux version of "intersvr.exe")

i have experience with mucking about in the linux kernel, and plenty of
C programming experience, and given the availability of parallel port source
(ie plip) it seems feasible...

bottom line, anyone know how to go about getting the protocol for interlnk??
if i just wanted to ftp, etc i'd use the crywnr patches to plip to be compat
with dos plip.com, but then i need some pc-nfs client, or samba and windows
for workgroups, all of which are $$$ and take up loads of low dos memory...

any ideas???

This is enough to warrant $99?  You can pay someone that amount
to add it to bash or zsh.

Also - "fc" under both bash and zsh pops up an editor for me.

I find bash and zsh much nicer for interactive use.

Nah...depends on the speed of your algorithms!  Has nothing to do with
packet density, unless your algorithms are so slow that packets come 
in faster than you can filter them.  Think about it for a second...the
CPU overhead may be different, but network throughput depends on how
much time you spend processing the packet.  If I can lookup an
Ethernet address and determine what interface, if any, to send out
faster than looking up in a table, changing the hop count and
checksum, net number, then sending out then bridging is faster.

There is less CPU overhead though with routing, when packets to be 
routed are the only ones processed.  If this is what you mean by faster
I'd agree to the effect but I'd say you need to change your description
of the phenomena.
