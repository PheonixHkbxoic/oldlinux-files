two complete (but slightly different) versions of the same thing.
Then look at patch54.gz to confirm that Linus didn't have a

by hand to remove the old version from the file.

Hi, I'm trying to use four floppies with mtools and its not working.
I have three line for each device e.g.
A /dev/fd0 12 80 2 18 # fisrt floppy
A /dev/fd0 12 80 2 18 # low density
A /dev/fd0 12 0 0 0 # generic autodetect

B ...

E /dev/fd3 12 80 2 15
E "     "
E "     "
#
C /dev/hdb4 16 0 0 0

If I use the above I get to many devices.
If I take out E it works fine. 
Any ideas? Thanks

No, we are not missing it.  Because it has been there for a long time

Under Linux, it is called "strace".

Read the manual page to the Linux 'nfsd'.  The '-n' option configures the
NFS server to accept "insecure" requests.

Subject: File Attributes (or resource forks) was: Re: ext2fs vs. Berkeley FFS
Date: Tue, 11 Oct 1994 14:45:22 -0400

(discussion about pros&cons of ext2fs and ffs, and about where file
attributs belong deleted.)

The standard unix filesystem certainly provides enough generality that
file attributes (ala mac resource forks) could be implemented in the
user level software.  There is a potential problem with this approach.
The unlink system call couldn't be made atomic in user level code.  The
process performing the unlinking of the resource files might be killed
before it completes the task.  This could leave the file resources in an
inconsistent state.  Presumably an atomic operation would at least be
used to mark the file as deleted, but a scavenger would have to be used
to complete partial deletions.

There are logical issues as well, such as whether editing such a file
and then save it in a non-resource aware editor will the resources be
preserved?  A common idiom in the code for my project (AUIS) is to write
the data out to a new file, unlink the old file, and rename the new one
to the old.  This process ensures that if the new data cannot be written
no data will be lost.  Emacs writes over the existing file, I assume it
provides safety by first copying the existing file before writing in the
new data.  Thus among non-resource aware applications differences in
implementation can produce undesired differences in how resources are
treated.

Lastly, COSE is working on a standard for a Unix desktop (CDE).  As more
unix platforms  gain use desktops and interoperability between them will
become more of an issue.

Ideally I would like to see a CDE implementation for Linux, but this
would some funding in order to get the specs at least.

1. The gzip format doesn't support multiple forks anyway.
2. This a modification to user mode utilities, not to the kernel.
3. That is also what a multistream file really is.

The point is that, sure, you can have "multistream files", but there
is no need for any kernel modifications: all that would be needed is a
standard way of identifying these as "opaque" directories, and a
sh*tload of modifications to user level utilities (which would have to
be done anyway!!).

Subject: Amateur Radio- IPIP daemon patch
Date: 13 Oct 1994 18:09:15 GMT

Here is a quick hack patch to get BDale Garbie's ipip daemon to build on Linux.
I've only tested it so far as to see that packets go in - they come out,
other than that, I don't know yet.  For those that don't know, IPIP is used
for Internet <-> AMPRnet (HAM Radio) gateways.  I will be testing this out
in more detail over the next little while, and if it works ok, we will
switch the toronto gateway to Linux!!

To use this, you need BDale's ipip.tgz from  hpcsos.col.hp.com:/hamradio/ipip.

Subject: Kernel: TCP  HANGS again! What is happening?
Date: Sat, 15 Oct 1994 18:52:20 GMT

Just now it happened again:  All TCP traffic suddenly hangs for many minutes!

Okay, here goes: Slackware 1.2 distribution.  Kernel 1.1.52.  Running:  named, 
gated, Smail as DAEMON, httpd as daemon.

I run a multi-line Internet SLIP Dial-In service.  At the time of the problem, 
nobody was online.  I tried to send a E-Mail prepared on Windows Eudora, via 
SMTP over the Ethernet link between the Linux server and my Windows computer.  
The SMTP transfer was suddenly hanging.

I type Netstat on the Linux box: 3 connections: One international SMTP 
Establised but not moving; One SYN Received, and my own SMTP Establised and 
hanging.  I type PS. I see 2 smtpd's in the list: the base daemon, and one 
forked.  This is one short.  The should have been a third one.  I enable 
tracing on the Windows WinSock program: Except for the 30 seconds routing info 
from gated, no traffic. Everything simply hangs.
All other Linux stuff works normally. I start TOP and have a look. Lots of 
memory free, swap not in use.

After about 5 minutes, suddenly everything starts working again; My SMTP goes 
through; the SYN Received is suddenly gone (!!) and the other international 
smtp goes through in the next minute.

I know from experience, that all other TCP traffic like Telnet, Ftp etc. also 
hangs.

This is a serious problem, which many people have in various forms, sometimes 
on PPP and SLIP links, often when they try to start a Telnet connection: The 
connection is established, but no login prompt appears.  It looks like the 
Kernel makes the connection, but fails to start the appropriate program.  
Strange enough, I now run smtpd as a daemon, instead via the inetd program, 
and this makes *no difference!*  So, it is *not* just related to inetd as some 
people have thought.  These must be some kind of bug in the TCP code. I wish I 
knew how to fix it myself...

Can some Kernel wizz please have a look at it?  I am happy to help with it if 
I can!

Thanks,  Bart.

There is a serious problem with the TCP in the new kernels. I (and many 
others) have been posting about it for months, but sofar I have never seen any 
reply from a Kernel developer. Have a look at all postings about Telnet, Ftp 
delays/hangups etc.
Please, is there any developer who can look into this TCP problem?
