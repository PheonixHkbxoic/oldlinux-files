This is a joke? Have you ever tried to get hotline support for Netware? 
$200 up front, then wait for them to call back! (2 days in the case I am 
familiar with). Try getting hotline support from Macrosoft: tell them 
that "xcopy" trashes your command history. Will they lift a finger? 
h0h0h0h0 (and you are on a 900 number paying by the minute!)

I called a major hardware vendor that our corporation has "special" 
support available. I wanted to know why I couldn't get certain transfer 
modes working with a certain hard disk. The response was silly: Was it 
plugged in? powered on? (Yes, this was *technical* support!).

How about Sun Microsystems? They are certainly a commercial operation. 
Ask them to make hardware flow control work properly. (to their credit, 
it is half fixed but the bug history goes back to the mid-80s at least)

Our corporation seems to have a very effective support line: put them on 
hold and play elevator music and they go away after an hour or so. I 
doubt this is the "official" policy that we tell the customer but I get 
complaints from people that know where I work.....

As far as I can tell, support seems to rely on "the good 'ole boy" 
network and that is just what the Linux community is all about!

P.S. Linux is not for the person who uses a computer because he/she is 
required to; it is for the person who enjoys their computer and looks for 
ways to enjoy it further....

You wouldn't believe how much stir-up a small patch like this can sometimes
cause.  I think Linus has become more careful before incorporating things
like this....
(e.g. at one time a "small patch that makes a PS/1 disk recognized and seems
to be harmless" caused a lot of messages from people that did not have
an IDE/ST506 disk at all, and complained that it was still "recognized"...)

Moral: before you submit it, test it on some friends machines (including
machines with unusual configurations like ESDI or only-SCSI) and submit
it including a statement that this caused no problems.

You can't use DOS drivers with Linux.
Instead, ask GoldStar what the drivers do, and you cna incorporate
similar functionality in the Linux drivers...

Same on the machine I use at work (486/33).  It only issues the message
on a CTRL-ALT-DEL reboot.  But it has never caused a hard problem for
me, other than dropping the first packet.
When the problem Danek has is the same, there is something else that has
caused the networking to die and the "Missed interrupt" is not the
cause.

However, there is another datapoint I can add: someone at work tried
CTRL-ALT-DEL booting a system that had been running as a Novell Netware
server just before, into Linux.  This really freaked out the 3c509 driver...
It issued continuous error messages which he unfortunately did not write
down.  Probably it can be repeated when required.

I think the 3c509 driver does not completely initialize the card, and
relies on some power-on defaults that are no longer valid after a warm
boot.  Could that be true, Donald?

Actually, the 68008 has only a 16-bit ALU and performs 32-bit ADD and SUB
operations using muliple passes.  It can't even perform 32-bit MUL and DIV.

The natural word size of a 68000/68008 is 16 bits.  For a 68020 it would
be 32 bits.

I seriously doupt that your monitor can handle that kind of
refresh-rates.. Te above modedb-entry would mean a refresh-rate of
250Hz!!! I tried to make a 320x200 too, and the closest I got was
500x400 with a refresh-rate of 100Hz.

Date: 11 Sep 1994 12:57:58 GMT

I've uploaded a new version of my 53c400 (T130B) Scsi patches. They are
functionally identical to the previous set but some of the patches in the
40's affected the NCR code and my patch stopped working flawlessly. Here is
the .lsm entry


Begin3
Title:          Patch to Linux 1.1.49+ for 53c400/t130b scsi
Version:        1(beta)
Entered-date:   18/8/94
Description:    These patches allow the Trantor T130B and any other
        NCR53c400 based card to work with the Generic NCR5380 SCSI driver
        under Linux. Ineterupts and PSEUDO-DMA are supported. This will
        become part of the development kernel eventually.
        This also includes some patches from Drew Eckhardt to do with
        resets and aborts as well as some timing issues. I couldn't be
        bothered separating them out. They'll all go in eventually anyway.

On the 68000 the external address bus is 20 bits and the external data bus
is 8. Internally, the registers, buses and ALU are all 32 bit. It can ADD
and SUBtract 32 bit numbers or MULtiply 2 16 bit numbers to give a 32 bit
result. It has fewer pins than a 68040, but its still a 32 bit chip. The
sizeof the integral types should be the same as any other 68K chip.

The Intel 8088 has a 20 bit address bus, but is otherwise an 8 bit device.
So:
  short = 8  bits
  int   = 16 bits
  long  = 16 bits
Neither of these processors has the address space or MMU necessary for
Linux to run on them, so the natural word size is irrelevant.

>How do you define the "natural wordsize" nowadays?
On the alpha the instruction word length is 32 bits. The registers are
64 bit and there is plenty of them. I'd go for:

  short = 32 bits  To save memory on kernal data structures which need
                   to be in our level 2 cache.
         
  int   = 64 bits  Small enough to avoid any significant performance
                   penalty on file system hashing. Large enough for the
                   next generation of disk drives.

  long  = 128 bits Large enough for most other purposes.

Reply-To: Ted.Harding@nessie.mcc.ac.uk

And Greetings to Mike Schumacher for raising, in sane terms, a very
worrying issue. Let me show my own IFF status and say I'm personally
committed to Linux: it's excellent in itself, and in various ways
outdoes many other versions of UNIX. Despite problems, the Linux
Community Spirit provides a pretty effective user support service.
What Linux lacks, so far, is a /good/ base of applications software.

Say what you like about DOS (DR- or MS-), there's a huge repertoire
of often excellent DOS-based applications software. Agreed the
software developers started writing for DOS because everyone was
buying PCs with DOS on them; the boot's now on the other foot - everyone
buys DOS/Windows because that's what all the software is written for. 

An example of what's /good/ on the Linux scene: as a mathematician
and statistician I get most of what I need computationally from 'octave';
thank God I don't have to program from scratch what's been available
in MatLab for DOS for years.

An example of what's no so good: I also need spreadsheet facilities;
'sc' is fine for small quick jobs, 'oleo' looks promising but doesn't
seem to be there yet, and certainly doesn't go very far, and 'scc' under
X (= sc with some graphics) roughly equals "basic use of Quattro". Not
inadequate for modest demands, but not good enough for active professional
life.

An example of what's not good: I really need database facilities. The
Linux options seem to be Ingres and Postgres. The Ingres available for 
Linux is so bare-bones as to be almost unusable (where are the menu
interfaces, anyone?) and I haven't yet succeeded in getting Postgres
to work. If even the now obsolescent dBase-III for DOS were ported to
Linux this would make work a lot easier.

(BTW in the above "need" means NEED: I have work to do). No doubt others
can parallel these examples in their own situations.

So the possibility of porting good DOS packages to Linux is attractive;
they needn't be up-to-date versions since not many people would be
stopped in their tracks by lack of the most recent capabilities. Naively,
this looks like a good idea.

What worries me is that /commercial/ software is a Trojan horse.
You want a database? Sure, here, $100, good value at the price.
You want graphics too? No, you can't access Linux graphics from within
the database. But here's a graphics add-on at $200 that can. And so it goes.
Back to the DOS jungle. Is this too pessimistic?

The non-commercial alternative is the likes of John Eaton's great
'octave' enterprise. Maybe as Linux matures, and time passes, such
things will happen in other areas. I'm optimistic, but not expecting
much in the near future. However, unless something happens on one front
or the other, Linux is possibly doomed outside the "UNIX ham" world.
My basis for hope is that so many people use it and want to carry on
using it that positive developments are very likely.

Mike pointed out some of the dangers arising from the shifting state
of Linux kernels and libraries, etc. I think the time is close where
someone has to say: "Here's a kernel; here's a system; and (above all)
here's adequate documentation for that, and it's all - in itself - OK",
regardless of how fast things are moving at the leading edge of Linux
development. Then, but not before, people (e.g. myself) can decide to
devote time to developing on top of that for their own purposes.

"                   .......  I changed the subject line in the hope that
" you carefully read what I've written, and that you now are willing to start
" a serious discussion." (Mike)

I hope I've understood, and this is my bit towards a serious discussion.
I'm also willing to put my penny of effort in the kitty towards development,
but large-scale stuff is not what I'm capable of.

Cheers,
Ted.

CONFIG_I_AM_A_BROKEN_BSD_WEENIE taken out of config.in
Missed a check for the floppy device in the I/O request queuer.
Support for detecting the "ST11 BIOS V1.7" added to XT hard disk driver.
3c501 driver made somewhat more reliable by eliminating a critical region.
LANCE driver improved to work with VLB NE2100 compatibles, and the HP
        J2405A and HP Vectra built-in adapter.
AHA152x now knows about the VTech Platinum SMP.
SCSI drivers know about the QUANTUM PD1225S.
Oops. Memory mapper wasn't checking for failed kmalloc's.
Moved the arphdr structure to if_arp.h for compatibility with BSD based
        programs.
The 802.2 network handler didn't work with more than one protocol registered.
Yet more small nasties removed from the TCP code.
BSD accept sematics fixed.
