gentlebeings of cola and cold:

I'm trying to get a tape drive to talk to a linux box, and I don't know what
I'm doing wrong.  (Blush) Kernel 1.1.18, configured with 
bool 'SCSI support?' CONFIG_SCSI y
and
bool 'Scsi tape support' CONFIG_CHR_DEV_ST y
(together with bool 'Adaptec AHA1542 support' CONFIG_SCSI_AHA1542 y)

On boot, I get
[snip]

I can talk to the card fine: $ mount -t iso9660 /dev/sr0 /mnt 
mounts the CD ROM normally, and gives me access.  However, I don't have any
st0 devices.  I tried 
$ mknod /dev/st0 c 46 0
(and a couple of other minor numbers, 8 and 128) but each time I try
$ mt -f /dev/st0 fsf
or whatever, I get "/dev/st0: No such device".  Am I being particularly
dense? What is the fix?

Hi everybody !

I have the following problem, and I hope that some performance evaluation gurus
out there could help me.

I am writing a simulator of parallel architectures under Linux, and I have 
to manage a lot of data: for this reason program locality is very important
in order to improve the overall performance. 

In particular I would like to enhance the cache hit rate and minimize page 
faults, executing a smart scheduling (locality oriented) of the simulation 
events.

THE PROBLEM

How can I monitor the cache and virtual memory performance during program 
execution? I tried with xosview, but I would like to use a better tool and/or
a bettr tecnique (using standard libraries?) to profile the program behavior. 

Any suggestion is really appreciated.

Thanks for your time and consideration

Hey guys!

        I cannot say enough about this product!  It works, works
great!  Has one helluva great manual too (worth the extra bucks!).
IMHO is BETTER than dBASE by a long shot!  No runtime stuff to sell
your clients, no client licensing... you distribute compiled code and
files... We're already writing three applications and porting two
others right now for small businesses and have two major, bigtime
companies interested in porting their DOS/NOVELL/dBASE apps to Linux/
NFS/terminal-based systems.  I've said this before, but I'll say it
again, this, IMHO, is THE KILLER APP for commercial success in the
commercial DOS-based market.  Given the base of already developed
and successful xBASE applications out there and the ease of writing
these applications, this is a natural for the small independent 
software company.  Sure, it's great fun to hack around with developing
word processors, window managers, etc., but ya gotta pay the bills
somehow, right?  At the very least, get the demo (it's only an ftp
away!) and try it.  The intro pricing on this product for the Linux
community is an incredible deal also... about the same as a single-user
copy of dBASE for DOS!

        I think if we show some support for commercial ventures of 
this type, we'll see Linux become even more popular.  I'm not saying
cast Linux in stone like the "commercial" *nixen, there will always
be the source and freedom to hack away that we've all enjoyed, but 
products like Flagship will allow for commercial apps that we can 
all use to pay the bills while we still have room to play and hack!

        Go for it!

Let LILO do it... I heard, SCO has something like that. Just a LILO

Three questions:

Is there a disassembler for Linux object files which is freely available?

Is there a standard version of make (ie, not gmake but the other one)?  I have
many makefiles written for "the other" make that I would like to use.

Ok, only two questions - I'll save the other one for later.

They're planning to release a new version as soon as there are new, stable
versions of the kernel (I guess 1.2), gcc (2.6.x), the libraries (4.6.x) and
XFree (3.1).  They should all happen reasonably soon, so some time after
that we can expect the next version.

As far as I know, the EE32 and the later versions of the NE3200 are identical.

And then, the AC3200 driver should also work with the Mylex LNE390, the Eagle
3210, and the CNET 902, to name just a few.

The only difference from model to model is the table that translates the
config byte at slot+0C90 into the shared memory and interrupt selection

I have been pondering the same question for a while now.  Ideally, I
would like to use Motif, as I already know it, it is pretty standard,
and I like it.  Alas, it's not free.  I'm willing to pay for it for
Linux, but most Linux users aren't.  I'd like to make my stuff accessible
to as many people as possible-- that's why Linux has improved the way 
it has.  XView is a definite possibility since it's a complete toolkit
and it's free.  I find its look and feel somewhat ungainly though, and
now that Sun is abandoning it in favor of CDE/Motif, it is dying a slow
death.  There is also the Athena Widgets, which are free and relatively
complete, but kind of ugly.  You can get a 3d version, but it is only
partially 3d, and it appears not to have been worked on in a year or
two.  Finally, I've been looking at the widgets from the Free Widget
Foundation.  There are some very nice ones in the set, and they come
with good examples.  Unfortunately, the look and feel is not uniform
(some are Motif-like, some are Athena-like, and others are just out
there), and the set of widgets available is not as comprehensive as
Motif's.  Of course, there is also Stallman's recent note about Tk
and the Scheme bindings available for it.  I'm no big fan of Scheme,
however.  I'd prefer to stick with C or C++.  I'm not really interested
in using Tcl either-- I want to use a compiled language for speed.
I'm currently leaning towards FWF, and possibly writing a widget or
two of my own to fill in some of what's missing.  I'd like to hear others' 
thoughts on this though.

Since I think this is a fairly important question, I'm adding 
comp.windows.x.intrinsics and gnu.misc.discuss.

: Does anyone know of a freeware COBOL for Linux? [*]

: [*] No, I am NOT brain dead! I believe that Linux is one of
: the greatest operating systems I have ever seen (although I
: haven't seen Microsoft's NT yet :-).

: I believe, though, that COBOL and its ilk are still useful.
: I have a friend that was using a package written in COBOL --
: he swears at it, but uses it.  If COBOL is written for Linux,
: he may be able to use Linux when he replaces his SCO Xenix system.
: (That's assuming the program's vendor is even interested in porting
: his package to Linux...)

Well,   [ where'd I put that Nomex suit, anyway? ],  I agree with
you!  There are literally billions of dollars invested in COBOL code
that could be ported very easily to Linux were there a COBOL compiler
available.  I have heard that there is a compiler for SCO that will
also run in iBCS, so that may be an option.  Given that there are a 
lot of systems written in COBOL that are performing some function, but
are just not worth the effort of converting to C or C++ or whatever,
this could provide a very useful path for many businesses approaching
downsizing to *NIX platforms.  I would even like to see [ doning another
layer of Nomex ] a CICS port done.  IBM did it for AIX (bleech!), why
not for Linux?

Just the insane ramblings of an ex-IBM mainframe systems programmer.
      ("Not sure if I trust a computer I can't climb into."

Please forgive me if I've insulted anyone.

I have considered it.  It shouldn't be too difficult, just a little
tedious.  Don't do it now, though, I have rewritten the driver quite
subtantially to support a number of different things.  I am waiting
for the 1.3 stream to put it into, since I don't feel comfortable
releasing it as 1.2.

        If smail is doing this, it must be misconfigured. In the
transports file there should be a line in the appendfile driver that
tells smail to do the file append as the user who the mail is addressed
to. The syntax is append_as_user. The above .forward hack doesn't work
here, as the following debug extract will show.

director <dotforward> matched <jh>
    directed jh --> /etc/passwd ... send to file transport
transport file uses driver appendfile
  appendfile: write to file /etc/passwd
insert_addr_list() called:
        ERR133: transport file: failed to open output file: Permission denied
        /etc/passwd
write_log: /etc/passwd ... failed: (ERR_133) transport file: failed to
open output file: Permission denied
