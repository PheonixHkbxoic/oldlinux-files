I had patches to ld/ld.so to implement this for linux, but it is not really
worth the extra binary bloat by recording paths at compile-time. Having a
sensible cache in place is usually enough to satisfy the linking procedure.
The next-generation executable format for linux (ELF) will have this feature
by default (I remember seeing it in the EYC patches) as it is quite easy to
add sections to this format. You wll find it interesting that SunDOS which like
linux uses the standard a.out format does NOT have -R option to the linker and 
does not support path-recording. However Slowaris which uses the ELF format for
executable does have -R.

No Seyon had a bug in it. It is true to say linux is better at trapping bugs.
Our libraries are generally much more pedantic and you can not even get away 
with misdemanour let alone murder (which you can with SunOS/Slowaris). The
aforementioned systems will generally let you dereference willy-nilly, close
file descriptors multiple times, free up non malloc(ated) space etc, etc...

Hang on, I still have libc.so.2.2. I still keep around old binaries/libraries,

The most significant difference with linux ld.so and Slowaris/SunDOS ld.so is
that ours does not really do dynamic linking. In linux's version we just find
the libraries, mmap `em and then perform some fixups. On the contrary the other
two systems do not have their shared libraries at fixed addresses, and thus
ld.so does "true dynamic linking" using dlopen(), dlsym() for each symbol in
the binary.

The only problem with Linux and > 1024 sectors I've seen is that LILO
can't deal with partitions that start at a cylinder greater than 1023
(Actually a DOS restriction, I imagine).  It doesn't matter how big
the partitions are, but it needs the first sector of each partition <
cyl 1023 to write the boot information.  So put your small partitions
first and you should be OK.

Subject: Mosaic and other TCP/IP problems
Date: 1 Sep 1994 19:32:01 GMT


 I seem to be encountering difficulties with Linux's TCP/IP implementation.
 In Mosaic (running on Linux 1.0.9, 1.0.0, 1.1.0, 1.1.38, etc) I have the
 problem that image transfers > 5K break at 5632 Bytes always. They blitz
 up to this point then begin crawling at about 1K every 3 seconds. We have
 a T1 to the internet and the problem only occurs when moving from a fast
 transport (10BT Ethernet @ 10Mbits) to a slower medium (T1 or SLIP). When
 accessing the httpd server over straight ethernet, the problem does not
 show up. My network cohorts claim that 5632 bytes = 1 machine page + 
 minimum TCP packet + TCP header and that there may be a problem with the
 VJ conjestion control algorithms. Is this true or is the algorithm not
 even implemented?

 One other beef... the close() socket protocol is not implemented correctly.
 Instead of negotiating the close of a socket, Linux just waits 60 secs.
 and then closes the socket (/usr/src/linux/net/inet/tcp.h). For RPC servers
 that spawn when called, this is ok; the residual process just hangs
 around for an extra 60 seconds before going away. This can be seen on an
 httpd server that is under heavy load. Every access to the httpd server
 leaves a residual process for 60 secs. after completing the request. For
 RPC servers that are necessarily single-threaded, however, Linux's hack is
 not acceptable. The server must wait 1 minute before completing each
 request and accepting the next. Is there a fix for this in the works?

There is definitely something funny going on as of 1.1.49, you're right.
An even simpler test:

Stick an expendable formatted floppy in drive A:
dd if=/dev/zero count=2 of=/dev/fd0
mke2fs /dev/fd0
dd if=/dev/fd0 count=2 | od -a

You'll see that mke2fs did not actually write anything to the disk.  Syncs,
etc. do not help; I think the problem is in the block caching in the kernel.
However, if you just "cp" or "dd" a file to a floppy device it works (probably
tar works too).  The failure is not total; sometimes the above can be made to
work (e.g. playing around with the write protect tab).  The problem seems not
to be at the very lowest levels of the floppy driver, but at some intermediate
level.

The above FDC version numbers are quite odd.  Is it possible to look
at the FDC's markings and see who's right, or ask the manufacturer?

3 msec is standard for 3.5" (and newer 5.25") floppy drives.  The 4msec
is to allow a bit more latitude for slightly out of spec drives.  The
older kernels (up to 1.1.40) used 6 msec, and on 82077s in double density
this actually came to 12 msec (very slow and noisy).

...
Unfortunately, the 82077 cannot be made to behave *exactly* like an
8272A.  Closer than it is now, yes.  It might be worth having a handy
#define to cause the FIFO not to be turned on.  However, it *WAS*
working earlier on quite a few systems; more debugging is needed on
both of these problems.

There's nothing wrong with the current depca driver (it's working fine

1.0.9 of the backbone (the one which get the calls) and 1.1.49 (or

I have to disagree here.  The price/performance of a Pentium PC is
quite good (especially if you're running Linux :-).  I've done a lot
of shopping around in the workstation market and have run quite a
few benchmarks on various systems ... the Pentium scores quite well.
IMHO it's a much better deal than any of the low-end (< $20k) workstations
out there right now.  It's still a bit of a dog when it comes to fp
performance but you don't see serious MFLOPs in the workstation world
until you spend > $40k.

One of the most important benefits is vendor independence, I can buy
spare/replacement parts from anyone ... no need to purchase a
maintenance contract.  This was the big selling point for us, at one
time our research group was paying $35k/year in maintenance on 4
minicomputers.
