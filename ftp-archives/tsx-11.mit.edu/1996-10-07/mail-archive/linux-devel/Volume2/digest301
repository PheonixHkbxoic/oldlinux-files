Well, just to throw my two cents into this thread...
I just purchased a PowerMac 7100/66 for my brother this last weekend, and boy
was that thing fast, and _that_ was while running at least 3/4 of its software
emulated from 68k code

I would LOVE to have an asskicking os like linux running on this thing, rather
than system 7, especially now that i have to pay for updates to the os (i love
macs look-and-feel of software, but i've grown to loathe the actual os itself
over the last year or so, since my exposure to linux :-)

so here's hoping the guys working on the port can get as much info as needed
and that apple opens up and gives them what they need to know!

Sure.  Your serial port probably does not have a 16550A uart, right?

By default, the linux hard disk driver performs much of it's I/O with
all other interrupts masked.  When you use -m32, it is performing up to
32 times as much I/O per interrupt, with interrupts masked correspondingly
longer.  Odds are good that during this I/O, your serial port is dropping
characters, causing FTP to timeout and retry.

To negate this effect, the -u1 (hdparm) option can be used, though on 
some systems this causes trouble.  Backup first!

Hmmm. I don't believe it claims to be good in all cases at all.
Better re-read the man page, paying particular attention to the paragraphs
for the -m setting, which state (among other things):

              On  many  systems,  it also provides increased data
              throughput  of  anywhere  from  5%  to  50%.   Some

              series), seem to  run  slower  with  multiple  mode
              enabled.  Your mileage may vary.

<I was fooling around with it, and my results were not encouraging.

See last line above.

Use the built-in -t option for more consistent timings.
As noted in the man page, some drives are slower with multiple-mode
enabled, and many are faster.  Looks like yours are slower.

Sure. There's no law against a c compielr compiling Modula2 with the 
right flags, as long as it DOESN'T claim its an ANSI c compierl in that mode.
I think (correct me if I'm wrong) that this thread of conversation spun 
off someone claiming that // was being considered for inclusion in an 
ANSI revision-- and my responding such was highly unlikely since it woudl 
break previously legal syntax.

As a flagged option, sure, go ahead and put it in your compiler.  But 
don't expect ANSI portability if you use it.  Myself, when I want to 
write code like that I use c++, where its already legal.

Or, if your kernel is not pre-antique (considerably older than 1.0),
just use the setserial program to set the interrupts.

I have noticed ever since 0.98pl4 that I started with, that performance
has been dropping.  The only exception is the disk performance, which
increased because of the clustering.

In the early days, starting something in X windows was snappy.  Now I
get a noticable delay.  I still have a copy of Byte-3.1 results of
0.98pl4 and indeed it shows a decrease since then.  At that time, my
system yielded 3.0 and on 1.1.33 it had 2.3
(not as much decrease as it seems to be.  however, I should also note
that my fist reaction when running Linux was "boy this is fast", as my
only frame of reference at that time was SCO XENIX and SCO UNIX running
on comparable hardware.  over time, one gets used to the speed and wonders
how it could ever be experienced as "fast" :-)

Sorry, but simply because other compiler vendors want to break the
ANSI standard is not a sufficient reason IMHO.

The example cited most often,

        i = 4 //* comment */ 2;

is of dubious merit from a _style_ point of view. HOWEVER, it _is_
legal according to the ANSI standard. I would argue then that what
we're discussing is a change to the standard, not a simply a change to
a particular compiler. As such, it's my opinion that the change should
be evaluated in that light.

IMHO it still strikes me as a needless modification to the C standard
since in most cases C++ will look and feel enough like ANSI C that
simply using C++ should suffice.

As a postscript, I find the notion of supporting multiple comment
syntaxes as unusual in the extreme. I know of no other language than
C++ which has multiple comment syntaxes. I have yet to encounter a
compelling reason for it besides backward-compatability which isn't
_that_ compelling for me.

        Cheers,
        Bruce.

I just wanted to mention that Morningstar PPP has had a queueing

it treats ftp as *interactive*, same as a login session. So people

In line with all this; Where can I read what is actually done with any new

to this kernel; was there any TCP / SLIP / PPP development which may solve the 
TCP problems we are having?

Routed overwrites the Kernel 1.0.xx memory tables.  Eventually it will crash 
the system, depending how big the routing table becomes. I my case, within a 
few minutes.  Routed does not work properly anyway (the Linux version). The 
only way out is Gated, which I now use all the time... BUT it cannot be used 
with the 1.0.xx kernels!
So, if you MUST use a routed (gated) program, you also *must* use the new 
kernels. I am now using 1.1.52, which works fine as a multi-line SLIP dial-in 
server.

Subject: Need more than 32 mount's
Date: 13 Oct 1994 09:40:01 GMT

Hello,

I am running LINUX (kernel release 1.0) in a 'big' SUN network, using
the automounter 'amd' and YP.

The configuration works very stable, and the integration into the network
you can call 'perfect', except:

        In some cases the limitation of maximal 32 mounts inside
        LINUX is a blocking problem. Because of the use of 'amd'
        the problem is temporary, but shell's hang, if you want
        to move to a directory, which can not be mounted if the
        limitation is reached.

I was searching inside the sources, but was'nt able to redefine the
limit to an higher value (like 128).

I hope, someone out there can help me.

Thank you!

Thsi is a half-truth, it is true but incomplete.  It IS in many compilers 
BUT goes away if you set s 'strict-ANSI' flag.  Thsi is as it shoudl be 
for the reasons I already specified.  Making it a part of ANSI C would 
invalidate previosuly legal syntax-- a very very bad idea.

Guys, 
Pardon my intrusion but I think you are both sayign the same thing:)
And as a c++ programmer I agreee with you. /* */ causes alot of
problems (primary in this is its non-nesting nature. Yucko!).  I ALWAYS 
use // in new c++ programs.  I do find the c++ compiler accepting /* */ 
handy in  lazy sort of way, though, when i am porting straight ansi c 
code. (Yes, I could change the comments myself, or write a little 
processor to do it, but as I said, I'm lazy :)  )

Very true, he said, quickly jotting notes for the next inevitble 
super-set argument.

You'ld be suprised, though, how many people DON'T realize that c++ is not 
just extended ANSI C....
