Has anyone made/created a mixer for the PAS?  I've got the PAS 16 and no 
way to set volume, bass, treble, etc... for my card.  I've gone through 
the linux/drivers/sound directory with no luck.  I'd like such a thing if 
possible.  Pointers, ftp sites, etc....

I was giving a worst-case estimate - and allowing plenty of time for
"man patch" and slow network connections. And, btw, a DX2-66 isn't so

Agreed. You could have some intelligent queueing, though, with a
"large file" queue and a "small file" one, to make things run pretty
quickly (on the small file/ls side) without completely loading down
the remote site, or using up several of the limited anonymous logins
at the remote site.

I should have been more clear. By saying "mirroring of directories", I
meant the directory *entries*, not the files themselves. So, if I do
an "ls", I see the directory entries that have been cached locally,
rather than having to wait for ftpfs to open the connection, read the
directory, and show it. However, if I attempt to access a file that
hasn't been cached already, I have to wait for it to be
ftp'd. Clearer? As part of this, certain files in each directory could
be automatically cached along with the directory entries, such as the
00Index.txt, etc, to save time (and bandwidth) in accessing them
locally.

I dont' know: can this be done? I mean, showing just directory entries
even if the files themselves aren't there (well, some of them may be
there if they've been cached)?

: Ftpfs uses the ftp connection to check timestamps on files there.  It
: uses the timestamp to decide when cache entries are invalid.  ("dirty"

The problem is that each time a file is accessed, it has to be
checked. Why not automatically check a bunch of files at once, by
having a periodic "dirty daemon" that checks the files in
often-changing directories to see if they've been changed. Sure then
there's a chance that the user would get an old file, but that's no
worse than accessing an old version at a mirror ftp site.

: But then the user should be aware of this so he doesn't try to upload

You could have some way of specifying (maybe in an /etc file) that
uploads can't be done to linked directories, only to the "real"
directory. Have a daemon running that moves uploaded files to the ftp
site as the ftp site becomes available.

Subject: Sound Galaxy Soundcard Initialisation
Date: 27 Sep 1994 14:16:04 GMT


Linux works well on my system (486DX33 - 8MB - S3 video - Sound Galaxy
Pro16 - Panasonic CD) 

***BUT***

Sound and CD work fine under Linux only if, after powering up the
system, MSDOS is booted (at least as far as the point in CONFIG.SYS
which loads a driver (EEPROM.SYS) supplied with the sound card). If
this is not done, the sound card is not initialised properly, sounds
do not play for mre than about one second (interrupt problem??) and
the CDROM drive is not recognised.

I guess that EEPROM.SYS causes information contained in the EEPROM on
the sound card to be used to initialise its registers. (This fits in
with comments in the latest Voxware distribution about the need to
boot MSDOS before Linux when using software configured soundcards (not
jumpers)).

What I need is information on how to copy the EEPROM data into the
registers. Even better would be code already written. This could then,
I hope, be relatively easily incorporated into my copy of init.c (??)
in /usr/src/linux/drivers/sound. It should not be too big (EEPROM.SYS
is only 3K, 2K of which is full of zeroes).

Any input would be welcome.

Subject: problems compiling kernel 1.1.45+ for scsi
Date: 27 Sep 1994 18:44:26 GMT

I am running Slackware 1.2 with kernel 1.1.13.
I presently have only ide drives and they work just fine.
I ahev some (little) experience compiling kernels. I compiled
1.1.13, 1.1.35 many times with varying options.

I need to compile a kernel higher than 1.1.45 to support my new
scsi NCR 53c810 chip.

I downloaded 1.1.45 sources and the patches from 46 to 50.

I first patched all the way up to 50 and tried, but it bombed out,
same with 49. So I tried patching up to 46 and it bombed out too.
the error messages are all very similar.

Subject: >1GB SCSI disks & Buslogic Adapters
Date: 28 Sep 1994 04:30:33 -0400
Reply-To: andy@eng.kvaerner.no (Andrew Walker)

Hi,

There seems to be a lot of confusion around the use of large (> 1GB) SCSI
disks with Buslogic host adapters (e.g. BT-445S/BT-545S etc..) I thought
I'd try and clear things up a bit.

The Buslogic adapters have an option to translate drive parameters so that
DOS can deal with disks larger than 1GB. The translation tables are as follows:

        <=1GB           Heads 64,  Sectors 32, Cyls X
        >1GB <=2GB      Heads 128, Sectors 32, Cyls X >> 1
        >2GB <=4GB      Heads 256, Sectors 32, Cyls X >> 2
        >4GB <=8GB      Heads 256, Sectors 64, Cyls X >> 3

Without the translation option, the drive geometry will always be reported
as (same as <=1GB):
                        Heads 64,  Sectors 32, Cyls X

Unfortunately, the Linux Buslogic driver has no way of finding out if this
option is turned on (since it doesn't, and can't, use the Buslogic BIOS).
On the assumption that people owning >1GB drives probably want them to be
useable from DOS, the driver assumes that the translation is on, and thus
tries to mirror the translation for disks >1GB.

In this way DOS and Linux can agree on, and share, the partition table for
the disk.

So, if you access your >1GB disk from DOS you need to turn the translation
on. Linux will then happily co-exist with, and agree with, DOS's picture of
your disk.

If you only access your >1GB disk from Linux, it really doesn't matter
whether the translation is on or off. The driver will do the translation
anyway, but nobody will get hurt.

Right! Hope that helped somebody. Now a question.

- does anybody know how we can find out if translation is enable on
  a Buslogic adapter (undocumented functions????)

-Andy

Hallo !

I have recently bought a Mitsumi FX001D CD-ROM drive and I have no problems
under DOS or Windows or Linux. But when I try to mount a multisession CD 
under Linux the system prompts an error like this one: 

                       can't find superblock

Because I can read this CD under DOS and Windows I think it is a problem with
the dirver for Mitsumi CD-ROM's. 
Is there any possibility to mount multisession CD-ROM's under Linux with a
Mitsumi FX001D ?
Is somebody updating the mitsumi driver for multisession CD's ?

Subject: Is clock() broken in gcc 2.5.8?
Date: 27 Sep 1994 05:41:09 GMT


Does anyone know of any problems with clock() in gcc 2.5.8?
I recently downloaded and installed the slackware release of linux
(about 3 or 4 weeks ago) and this function does not appear to work as
advertised.  The code is extremely simple:

#include <time.h>
#include <iostream.h>

int main()
{
        cout << "\n\nclock() = " << clock() << endl;
        cin.get();  // wait a few seconds, then hit return
        cout << "clock() = " << clock() << endl;
        return 0;
}


CLK_TCK is reported as being 100, so 100 ticks per second.  The output
from the above code always indicates that clock() is returning the same
value the second time it is called as the first time (usually 2 or 3),
even when I wait several seconds before pressing return.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Scott

I would expect this. You are comparing an intel optimised compiler to a
compiler that is supposed to be portable first, and optimising next. The
model that GNU uses in the compiler seems to like having lots of general
purpose registers to reference, which the x86 does not have.

No way it won't. 

What args are wrong here ? This program works perfectly allright on SunOS 4.3 and
Solaris, but not on Slackware ...

#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
 
main()
{
  char *args[1];
  args[0]=NULL;
  printf("pid = %d, pgrp = %d\n",getpid(),getpgrp());
  if (execl("a.out",NULL)<0) perror("What the fuck\n");
/* or if (execve("a.out",args,args)<0) perror("What the fuck\n"); */

  return 0;
