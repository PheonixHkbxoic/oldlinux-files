You also can setup an alias for rm -r like Rm    :-))

My guess is that maybe you have too MUCH swap.  Also, swap files are not as
good as a partition.  I was also running normal processes on this box
includeing a primary nameserver, top with update set to 1 second, and
minicom...

Hope this helps in some way.  Please note that i put a \n in the fprintf in

I pointed David to "dcf77.441.tar.gz", which has a schematic and (did) run
on the raw clock on my system for some time. Not checking it again, David
told me that it didn't work any longer, as the format of the signal changed,
perhaps the first of September.

So here is a patch to synchronize the clock on the missing second before the
full minute, to make it work again. It offers also more command-line option,
to set the Polarity of the supply voltage, the threshold to distinguish
between a short and a long signal, to invert the logic meaning of the pulses
and to display the settings (-h)

But beware, it is written in german!

I tried to contact the original author Frank Sommer (fsommer@krefcom.gun.de
) some time ago, but got no reply, so perhaps he reads now.

Hi,

I need a full-pager SCSI-Scanner.
Since I am using only Linux on my PC it would be nice
to run it without MS-XXX.

Are there any Driver available?. I looked around and discovered
nothing. Is there Documentation available ( TWAIN ???)

Who has experience concerning this stuff?

How do you pass fd's to sockets?

Stevens, in "Advanced Programming in a Unix Environment,"
gives examples which use the __recvmsg call.

The recv() man page warns that recvmsg isn't implemented,
and goes on to say fd's "are now passed as ancillary data"
in struct msghdr- but that can't be, because msghdr
isn't anywhere to be found under /usr/include.

So, what's the deal?  Are messages free-form?

Thanks

dcfd does, Rob. It's in the ~/parse/util/ subdir.

dcfd. Anyway: xntpd is much better in terms of adjusting the clock
if the radio recptions fails due to the usage of the PLL. I use xntpd
on a standalone system (which runs IP, though).

No, you need IP up and running. xntp handles the receivers as pseudo-
hosts with addresses in the range 127.*.*.*. The daemon is not _that_
large. The good news is that you can configure a single xntpd to handle
both local receivers and remote NTP servers which is good to have 
backups in vital environments.

Quite easy if you can read ;^)

Subject: lynx dying when calling malloc
Date: Mon, 5 Sep 1994 19:22:49 GMT

I have problems with lynx. It dies when trying to access link like
file://localhost/~/ which is special lynx hack to access and manage
home directory. It seems that malloc library function is causing
segmetation violation. Lynx killed our Convex here some time ago (new
kernel installed without patches and no sources available |-:= ) because
of intensive usage of memory allocation. Stack trace below. Does any
library hacker want to look into details I can provide? My Linux is
1.1.49, libc 4.5.26, gcc 2.5.8, gdb 4.12, lynx 2.3.1 (lynx 2.3 dies too,
also with libc 4.5.21).

Yes it is incomplete. Get the one from ftp.funet.fi instead (two files).

Also you can't use gnat-1.81 with the latest linux kernels. I had
to downgrade to linux 1.0.9 and now it works fine.

Gnat 1.82 is out but a linux binary hasn't appeared yet that I have seen.
I think you need gcc 2.6.0 for gnat 1.82 anyway.

Great! I have hacked lmscd0.3 to work with 1.1.45 for my CM205, but it
is really only a quick hack.

Anyway I would love audio support...

Hullo guys,

please realize, that specint's don't say everything, get a bunch of  
benchmarks if you want to compare systems overall. Try to compare AIM  
numbers as well. It's true,that maybe specints cover all of your interests  
and so the machine with better specint is better for you. You in here  
compare total systems overall, trying to tell others which one is better  
. you'd need any benchmarks to cover that :) (3D graphics, where any indy  
will beat the shit out of a linux box for example .. sure .. not everybody  
needs it :)). I use linux and I like it, but if I could afford 64 MB RAM  
and other stuff, then I'd buy an indy :-)

Philippe

PS: repair costs of an indy are normally as high as the system costed .. 
    prost :-)

The first thing I would check is if Lynx somehow frees a malloced pointer
more than once. That can happen in many ways, like call fclose () twice on
an fp.
