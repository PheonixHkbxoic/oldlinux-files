Try rebuilding your kernel, after having changed the IRQ and BASE_ADDR entries in
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/mcd.h, to whatever you need them to be. You shouldn't
need to manually tell the kernel what's where on rebooring after this.
Hope this is any help,

Subject: Question on writing program to access serial ports & buffering
Date: 4 Oct 1994 23:28:32 -0400

Hello cyberspace! I'm trying to write a simple program which will write
a string to a modem and dump the results to the screen. This is a prelude
to a more complicated program.

The problem is, from the way that I've set up the serial port, it seems
as if the operating system, Linux 1.1.51, is not buffering the characters
from the modem, so if I don't read them immediately when they are received,
they get lost (overrun).

(Does anyone know of a good reference for this kind of thing other than
getty and comm programs?)

How do I tell the operating system to buffer the incoming characters?
I'm using /dev/cua0 at 2400 BPS. Here is a relevant snippet of code.
How would I modify this code to get the behavior I desire?

Thanks,

Doug             (code follows, comments are C++ style, _filedes has been
                  opened O_RDWR | O_SYNC)


  struct termios modem;

  // Get current modem attributes
  tcgetattr(_filedes, &modem);

  _baud_rate = B2400;
  cfsetospeed(&modem, _baud_rate);
  cfsetispeed(&modem, _baud_rate);
  
  // Set to 7 bits
  modem.c_cflag = (modem.c_cflag & ~CSIZE) | CS7;

  // Set to raw, no echo mode
  modem.c_iflag &= ~(IGNBRK | IGNCR | INLCR | ICRNL | IUCLC | 
                     IXANY | IXON | IXOFF | INPCK | ISTRIP);
  modem.c_iflag |= (BRKINT | IGNPAR);
  modem.c_oflag &= ~OPOST;
  modem.c_lflag = ~(ICANON | ISIG | ECHO | ECHONL | ECHOE | ECHOK);
  modem.c_cflag |= CREAD | CRTSCTS;
  modem.c_cc[VMIN] = 1;
  modem.c_cc[VTIME] = 0;

  // Turn off all flow control

  modem.c_iflag &= ~IXON;

Date: 4 Oct 1994 16:46:48 GMT

        There have been several questions about support for these
SCSI adapters.  As I was among many people asking, now that I have
some information it would be wrong of me not to post it.  These
adapters are all essentially the same.  The 274x is EISA version.
The 284x is the VL-Bus version.  And the 294x is the PCI version.
There is an alpha interim driver written that is supposedly fairly
stable.  I have not used it as of yet.  The driver as of now only
supports teh EISA and VL-Bus versions.  Support for the PCI is 
supposed to be coming soon.

The latest version and patches of the driver can be anonymously 
ftp'd from the following ftp site:

ftp.cpsc.calgary.ca    /pub/systems/linux/aha274x

Slackware bootdisks are also included as is more information about
the driver and its future.

I have had Novell servers crash due to hardware that was not obvious.  
Like a timing bug in the SCSI controller that happened once in a
while, a bad BIOS on a brand new design motherboard, and even 
a video card!  All of these things have caused weird unexplained
hangs on Novell equip, wiht perfectly functioning software.  Since
this is a new Pentium motherboard...is there a way you could put in
a 486 motherboard and keep everything else constant?  No everybody
has such things sitting around (I keep a spare file server or two
handy!)

I just discovered that REALTEK (GOOD) video cards that work fine in
lots of brands of compatibles stopped working on a 486DLC-40 box, a
slight bus timing difference.  Happens only once in a while, but
would make the boxes hang!  How annoying...I have 45 of these boxes.

Good luck.  I *hate* it when it happens to me, but it does all too
often...

This is a problem with the different Linux-Versions. I have the same
problem and I use Linux 1.0.9. 
Some searching showed me, that the missing type is defined in some
file, which is a linux-kernel-header in 1.1.* and which is only in the
kernel-source upto 1.0.9.

Here's a little workaround:

Patch trap.c with this:

And then put this _new_ file into ifmail/iflib:

sigcontext.h:

This works without any problems.

Well, yes and no.  If you are lucky to find a PC-02 controller, then it
works great.  If you are stuck with the TC-02, I don't think anyone has
figured out how to make it work (yet).  I bought mine from JEM computer in

Note that there are vogl and vogle. These are different though similar.
vogl is a gl implementation of earlier SGI's GL dialects and (I believe)
is not an implementaion of OPENGL. vogle has some extensions that cannot
be found in GL - don't ask me what at the moment. It may be a choice.
OTOH its only a client, that is it does not implement GLX

Well, have you contacted the "Tape channel" of the linux developers?
( I can't remember how, but it's in the FAQ :)

Some stuff I learned that *might* help you...  The 350M mode is known as
CMS-350, which is a Colerado-specific standard. It apparently slows the
tape down, while maintaining the same data throughput, to achieve the
higher data density. It still uses the same number of heads as QIC-150
though... so QIC-525(?) is impossible. The controller is known as the PC02,
and there is another known as the TC02 (jumpered, no compression) that will
work with linux, but will limit your drive to QFA-500 storage capacity. 
(QIC-150) 

>Thanks for any help in advance...
>

I hope this helped, as I'd _love_ to use it with linux!

Kevin

P.S. I found an MS-DOS TAR.EXE that is supposed to work with QIC-02 drives...
     it doesn't work either. :(

Does a NE2000 uses DMA channels? If so does it use the same channel as the AHA
card? A second guess , is the IO address for both cards the same?
