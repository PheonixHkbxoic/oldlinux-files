Subject: Kernel "ro" Parameter
Date: 1 Sep 1994 17:28:42 GMT

       I am in the process of configuring a Linux box to run in a
     networked environment.  A few days ago I came across an error
     message during boot and started investigating it.  The details
     are listed below:
     
     kernel:            1.1.12
     lilo:              0.14
     SysVinit:  2.4
     
     Problem:
     
     Use lilo to setup boot partition, mounting root as "ro" (lilo
     boots from partition boot sector, not MBR of disk).  When
     booting, init (SysVinit) reports error that "ro" is an invalid option.
     The "ro" flag should not be passed to init, it should be
     stripped from the command line by the kernel (or lilo?).  
     
     Fix:
     
     Linux source, subdirectory init, file main.c, function
     parse_options:
     
                while ((line = next) != NULL) {
     NEW-->          int PassToInit = 1;
                ...
                             }
                     } else if (!strcmp(line,"ro")) {
                             root_mountflags |= MS_RDONLY;
     NEW-->                  PassToInit = 0; 
                     } else if (!strcmp(line,"rw")) {
                             root_mountflags &= ~MS_RDONLY;
     NEW-->                  PassToInit = 0;
                     } else if (!strcmp(line,"debug"))
                ...
     NEW-->          if (PassToInit)
                             /*
                              * Then check if it's an environment variable or
                              * an option.
                              */
     
     If this problem has already been fixed, please let me know where I can
     get the "official" patch.
     
     Thanks!

     Can anyone suggests a reason why my ppp dies?  I upgraded to the lates 082994 driver because the one in the
kernel (1.1.49) didn't work either.  I've used debug to look at what happens -- I get a connection--and it sends
a few requests and gets a few replies for things like mtu--then the linux end sends some requests for ids? maybe,--
lcp requests and then pppd dies with a sighup --- is the kernel killing pppd?--I've also noticed my serial communications
under linux  don't seem to be too good--zmodem and term give lots of errors--I'm using a 14.4 modem and term just 
told me I was getting 544 CPS  can anyone help me?

Subject: Q:switching VCs under svgalib
Date: Sun, 4 Sep 1994 18:14:14

Hello Linux hackers -
I know this isn't a Linux development question, but it _is_ a Linux specific 
programming question, as svgalib is linux specific - 
Anyway - I've been fooling around with Jan Kybic's GhostScript front end 
BMV, mainly cleaning up the user interface a bit (personal prefs). However, 
this is the only svgalib program I have that won't allow me to switch VCs. 
I've checked out the sources for zgv, a graphics viewing prog. and it doen't 
seem to be doing anything special in order to support VC switching, and bmv 
doesn't seem to be doing anything special that would _disable_ switching, so...
BTW, this is with svgalib 1.12 (shared libvga 1.1.8)
Any help out there?
Thanks,

I have linux kernel version 1.1.27 and am running a dedicated ppp dial up

I don not have a problem connecting to other ftp sites on the internet just this one. when I connect everything appears to work but if I attempt to ftp file from the sun machine I get an message on the console on my machine that reads

Subject: DOSEMU 0.53 notes
Date: 4 Sep 1994 23:05:50 GMT

i've started playing around with DOSEMU .53 and i am VERY impressed.
        the idea of being able to have a real word processor (WP 6.0 DOS) and not have to
be in DOS/Windows is absolutely great!!!

        just a couple of notes.  things i've noticed and problems i've had

        mouse doesn't seem to work to well--do i need to run the DOS driver?  when i do
        i'm told its already loaded.

        is there support for the ATI mach32 chip?  i can only get 640x480 16 colors in
        graphics mode for WP--though the fact i can get graphics mode at all is great!  the
        screen goes screwy if i try 256 colors.  and if i try a different mode, WP tells me
        it won't work with my hardware config (it does work in native DOS).

        also, what do i need to do to get color in text mode--i got it once and i haven't a
        clue what i did, but i never saw it again.

        i do get color text in an xterm though.  that has LOTS of potential.  it does seem
        a lot slower though.   also delete and bs wouldn't work, but that might have been
        my termcaps not set up write in the dosemu.config or something like that.

        interesting--MS-UNDELETE won't work, it says i'm on a network drive and must use
        delete sentry--that's the one where it just copies deleted files to a hidden dir.

        lastly, can someone give me some information on good and SAFE ways to redirect boot to
        my DOS partition.  i also use double-space, so i'd be interested in knowing how to 
        gain access to that--the HOWTO is not completely clear and i'd really prefer not to
        thrash my hard drive, it's young and i want to break it in slowly.

        all in all, great stuff!!

Subject: missing headers
Date: Sun, 4 Sep 1994 23:40:42 GMT

I need some help from someone who has a copy of W.R. Stevens'
"Advanced Programming in the Unix Environemnt" (Addison Wesley
1992, ISBN 0-201-56317-7) - a great book, btw.

This book contains tons of exercises, and you can get the source
from ftp.uu.net (look for published/books/stevens*).

Anyway, many of the example sources include a couple of headers
that aren't in my Linux distribution (Slackware 2.0).  They
are: stddef.h & stdarg.h.  There are also other headers Stevens
says are common, but I don't have: cpio.h, float.h, langinfo.h,
& search.h.

My question is, was leaving these out a mistake?  If not, what
are the substitues?  If no substitutes, then why does Voelkerding
think we don't need them?

Thanks

Oops!
Sorry to follow up my own post, but of course, five minutes after posting
I solved the problem, after perusing the svgalib sources a little more 
closely.
It turns out the bmv spawns a background process to monitor the keyboard
while the parent is doing the display , and the two processes use SIGUSR1
to communicate - svgalib uses SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 to indicate VC aquire and
release! So, bmv's sighandler on SIGUSR1 was getting in the way. I removed
the background reading process ( I'm not sure why it was there anyway) and
voila! VC switching!

Yeah, I get this too. I always assumed it was a hardware problem, since
I don't run the machine under DOS, but recently my mother has been using
the machine under DOS and it doesn't seem to happen there. It was about
45mins fast after about 5 hours use the other night too - gave me a real
fright. The problem seems to have got worse a few kernels ago.
I manually fix the clock (and yes, I do write it back to the CMOS clock
as well) whenever I boot the machine.

Nothing special about the machine -
486DX33, ISA, OPTI chipset, 8MB RAM
2xIDE controllers, 3 drives (Segate 130Mb, Conner 170Mb, WD 540Mb).
1xfloppy controller, 2 drives (1.2, 1.44)
4x16540 serial
2xparallel
SB16 sound
3c501 ethernet

        Any experienced people out there willing to test out
ipfirewall?  Ipfirewall is a package with a kernel modification and an
application to allow you to do packet level filtering/firewalling with
your linux box. I've completed a port of this which was originally
written for BSD/386 by Daniel Boulet. I've been running it on my
machine for about a month now. For the moment, I consider this an
alpha release, although it has proven stable where I have tried
it. Installation involves applying a patch to a 1.1.45+ source tree
and compling it and the ipfirewall application. If you're not familiar
with this or your networking setup, please wait for a later release.

Primary-site: sunsite.unc.edu /pub/Linux/kernel/patches/network
              42 kB ipfirewall0.1.tar.gz 
(well, that's what the lsm said, currently it's in pub/incoming.)
Alternate-site: ftp.forsci.ualberta.ca /pub/linux

I have to think that, if there is to be any noticible speed difference, you 
really must stick to disk-intensive applications.  I would guess kernel 
compilation is not THE thing to test this with.

Off the top of my head, I'd suggest this: compile the kernel with and without 
hd enhancements.  In each state (out of X-windows, to be scientific), mount an 
empty filesystem and pipe yes into a file (yes > /mnt/tempfile)  until the fs 
is full--the amount of time it takes to fill up the fs should change if there 
is any improvement to be had.

I'd try this myself, but I'd like to get everything else working right now!  
If someone tries this (at your OWN risk!  (:  ), please post the results.

I use iozone.  I got a 50% speed up when I went from 1.0 to 1.1.45 with 
multcount 16, read-ahead 16, etc.  Going to VLB with my IDE drives yielded
another 35% improvement (on top of the 50% improvement from 1.1.45).

I think that iozone does a pretty good job.  Creating a new filesystem will
give you completely reproducable results, this is true.  But echoing yes until
it fills up may be overkill.

Even iozone isn't really great for anything but testing big silly sequential
writes and reads.  Timing the startup time of X is pretty good ;-)

Well, it just bugs me that I can reboot my system to Coherent and use the mouse
on COM2 and a terminal on polled COM4 at 9600 bps or higher (165450) without 
any trouble.  Running my terminal polled under Linux yields a speed which
looks, coincidentally, like it is slower than 1200 bps.  Coherent changes its
polling rate depending on the bps rate of the port.  This doesn't work when you
really go up in speed but it will definitely allow a 386 or even 286 to handle
9600 baud OK.

I am looking at the serial polling code now.  If I come up with anything, I'll
post patches for people to try.

: It is better to listen to the rest of the world, and somehow move your
: IRQs or use a board which can share IRQs.

I know this might work.  But, I don't want to wreck even a $5 board if I can
help it and I know that a lot of people don't want to either.  Linux should be
able to poll a port at a reasonable rate.  It's not too much to ask for.

Subject: which kernel with dosemu 0.53 ?
From: srini@tisl.ukans.edu (Srini Seetharam)

Reply-To: srini@tisl.ukans.edu (Srini Seetharam)


I downloaded the dosemu0.53 pre alpha release.

I would like to know which kernel it is compatible with.
preferably aftre 1.1.40 or so.
I also need compatibility with ncr 53c810 scsi,
PPP and PCI bus.

please bear with me , it takes me 2 hrs to compile a 
kernel on my slow 386.

I currenly run on a 386-20 but plan to move to a 486 
based machine with the ncr and pci bus.

Thank you

I too enjoy running WP 6.0 for DOS under Linux.

Hmm.  I load a mouse driver and it work OK as long as /dev/mouse is interrupt 
driven rather than polled.  Have you checked the config.sys and autoexec.bat
files to make sure it isn't being loaded twice somehow?

:       it won't work with my hardware config (it does work in native DOS).

Hmmm.  I don't know about this but my Cirrus Logic 5428 allows me to run at
1024x768x256.  What is your video line from dosemu.conf?  Mine is just:
video { vga console graphics }

:       also, what do i need to do to get color in text mode--i got it once and i haven't a

This may be connected to your getting it to work in an xterm.  You need a
different video config, I think, for things to work well on the console as
opposed to in an xterm.  For an xterm I leave out all video lines while for the
console I have the video line listed above.  Are you sure you didn't change it
to run under X and have not changed it back?

:       a lot slower though.   also delete and bs wouldn't work, but that might have been
:       my termcaps not set up write in the dosemu.config or something like that.

You can get delete and backspace to work in an xterm.  I didn't do anything
special but they work for me.

I find it is somewhat slower but WP6.0, DOSEdit, Turbo C++, etc. seem to run
pretty well.  You can't expect emulation to run flat out!

:       lastly, can someone give me some information on good and SAFE ways to redirect boot to

:       gain access to that--the HOWTO is not completely clear and i'd really prefer not to
:       thrash my hard drive, it's young and i want to break it in slowly.

:       all in all, great stuff!!

If you don't use lilo on your hard drive to boot (like me), all I did was
change the disk line from the "disk { image..." thing to:
disk { wholedisk "/dev/hda" }

It boots right off of it and loads Stacker just fine.

The only other problem I have noticed is that mem does not show any EMS memory
even though I ask for it.  Am I the only one for which EMS doesn't show up?

Did you try a "tail -20 /dev/zero"?

Short after bootup this stalls my system (486-66DX2, 16Meg, PCI) for about
an hour. On a system running some time, the command fails after a minute or
so with the notice " virtual memory exhausted".

Anybody has the same experience?

Actually I've always wondered how lilo works. I understand it records the
disk block the kernel is on. But what if the kernel isn't continuous? What
is it that knows enough about the file system in order to find *all* the
disk blocks that make up the kernel?
