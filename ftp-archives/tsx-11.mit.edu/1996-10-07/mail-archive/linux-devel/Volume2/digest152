Under Linux 1.1.49 I can read from my  Exabyte 8200 and
write small files, but when I do a big tar I get:

Oops: 0000

...now it just hangs...

What to do? I tried changing the buffer size and write threshold

Any ideas? I will fix this if I can, but I have
little time right now ...but I need this tape,
I can only read stuff in now, I'd like to do backups...

I really doubt that anyone who is foolish to program in COBOL would want to
run a UNIX system anyway.  They are probably locked into their current
mainframe system with no easy to upgrade.

I have a laptop that I run in 640x480 using XF86_VGA16 and a small enough
font that I don't notice the cramped resolution. Works like a champ.

For running DOOM, I use the XF86_SVGA server and chipset "generic"
with a stock VGA 320x200 modes line:
"320x200"       25      320 344 376 400         200 204 206 225

You can simply run the server, without any clients, and start linuxxdoom
on a VT. Looks very nice!

float are not different from gcc and BC or Microsoft C since
is is controlled by the hardware. Those floats has to be
input/output in the Math-coprocessor. In fact the format
for Sparc, HP Pa-risc and Intel x86 family is the same: IEEE standard.

Where is the difference ? Packing. Most DOS compiler have
a switch to pack (no alignement) data in structure. I don't
think GCC has such a switch (not very useful indeed since it
will slow down the application because processing miss-aligned
data is expensive). But GCC has a trick for the architecture
that can support it (Intel for one). You can selectivly
control the alignement of data inside the structure declaration
like this.

        struct foo {
                char b;
                int a __attribute__ ((packed));
                float f __attribute__ ((packed));
        };

I use this by placing a define like this:

        struct foo {
                char b;
                int a GCC_PACKED;
                float f GCC_PACKED;
        };


And when compiling on DOS, I define GCC_PACKED to nothing.

Of course this will only work in Intel architecture (between
DOS and Linux for one). If you are using C++, it is very easy
to define a class acting like a portable float, portable int, etc...
Here is the definition of a CompatFloat I am using. This
one is for Big Endian architecture (Sparc, PA-RISC). For other
architecture, simply reverse the indexes.

class CompatFloat {

private:
        unsigned char buf[ 4];

public:

        CompatFloat( float i) {
                union {
                        volatile float f;
                        char  a[4];
                };
                f = i;
                buf[ 0] = a[3];
                buf[ 1] = a[2];
                buf[ 2] = a[1];
                buf[ 3] = a[0];
        }
        CompatFloat( void) {}
        operator float( void) {
                union {
                        volatile float f;
                        char  a[4];
                };
                a[0] = buf[3];
                a[1] = buf[2];
                a[2] = buf[1];
                a[3] = buf[0];
                return f;
        }
};

A float on Sparc is simply reversed (endianness). Using CompatInt
and family, you don't have to deal with alignment to create portable
structure. And of course, the CompatXXX classes can deal with
more complex variation. You still have to copy from the portable
structure to the internal one if processing speed in needed.

        struct foo {
                char b;
                CompatInt a;
                CompatFloat f;
        };

The README file contains:
<<<<

Userfs  is a mechanism by which normal user processes can be
a Linux filesystem.  There are many uses for  this,  includ-
ing:
 
Prototype filesystems
 
     Prototype  new  block  allocation  algorithms in a user
     process and debug with gdb before going into  the  com-
     pile-crash-reboot cycle of kernel development.
 
Infrequent use filesystems
 
     You  want to mount "FooBaz 0X" filesystems under Linux,
     but you don't want it that often, and you don't need it
     to  be  maximum  speed.   Rather than trying to get the
     kernel  itself  to  understand,  or  write  specialised
     tools, write a filesystem program.
 
Add capabilities to existing filesystems
 
     Want  compression, encryption, ACLs?  Have a process to
     mirror an existing file tree, but with your own  exten-
     tions and semantics.
 
Completely virtual filesystems and new interfaces
 
     Add  a  filesystem-type interface to an existing mecha-
     nism, or a filesystem interface as a new way of  repre-
     senting data.  Sick of FTP?  How about
 
          $ mkdir /ftp/tsx-11.mit.edu
          $ cd /ftp/tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/Linux
          $ cp README $HOME
 
     Or mail?
>>>

I did test userfs and found it interesting. I'm not expert about News
Spooling but i believe it could do the job very well.

Reply-To: Ted.Harding@nessie.mcc.ac.uk

Not sure where best to post this, but anywhere that compiler buffs abound
looks good ....

I'm using gcc version 2.5.8 on SlackWare Linux 1.2, and having a problem
compiling a big software package (sipp) which uses flag -fPIC (and probably
absolutely necessary for this package). This flag causes trouble. The
trouble is reproduced in miniature by the following little program.
Basically, it seems the compiler phase produces -fPIC code, but the
assembler phase won't accept it.

Try it with 'gcc junk.c' -> OK; then 'gcc -fPIC junk.c' -> lots of
invalid "[" and "@" characters (use 'gcc -fPIC -S junk.c' to view assembler).
Same effect with -fpic.

Can anyone say why, and suggest what should be done? 
=============================================================================
/* Program junk.c */
#include <stdio.h>

static struct {float x,y; } Point, *Point_Ptr;

The comparison I was making was on a Sparc2 just for benchmarking purposes.
However, I do personally own a remanufactured Sparcstation with no
fortran compiler, so I use f2c+gcc on that machine when working with
my fortran codes.

I haven't priced the fortran compiler for Sparc. I just assumed it would
be a little to steep for the investment since most of my programming is
in C and Common Lisp.  GCC is a fine piece of work (so is Linux) for free
software and there really no need to purchase a commercial Common Lisp.
The GNU CL (formally AKCL) is excellent and CMU CL I've heard is even
better.

So it looks like the only compiler gap in the free software world is
FORTRAN.  I heard gf77 was about to enter beta and the only thing
it was really missing was 'EQUIVALENCE'.

Is this true?

Has anyone developed an Enhanced IDE controller for LINUX ?

I'm intending to run Linux upon a Pentium 90 m/c - has anyone
found any difficulties with doing so ?

Good God, why?!?

Well ... I suppose you could use the monitor config spreadsheet at 
sunsite (/pub/Linux/X11 is the closest I can point you ... sunsite is 
still down).  Plug in the rez and you'll get timings.

: P.S.  DOOM for X exists, and will hopefully be released soon.

Yeah ... fingering help@idsoftware.com reveals the same message re: Linux 
port as it has for the last two months: "RSN!! RSN!!"

Seriously, IMHO Doom will probably be more useable in the promised 
pixel-doubling mode than in a straight 320x200.  Easier to make things 
look innocent when the boss walks in ... "Hey, you're not actually 
_working_ in 320x200, are you?"
