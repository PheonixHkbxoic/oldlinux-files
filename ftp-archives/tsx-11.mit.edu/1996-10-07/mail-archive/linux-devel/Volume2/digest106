The ROM boot monitor loads and starts the boot block.
The boot block loads and starts /boot using patched in disk addresses.
/boot finds and loads /vmunix using knowledge about the BSD FS.

So one can toy around with vmunix files like any other file, all you
have to watch out for is that vmunix may not contain holes.

Under SunOS the installboot(8) program installs the bootstrap and the
addresses to /boot into the boot block.  This only needs to be done
once, because /boot never changes.

The LILO method is rather crude.

I was mistaken.  I stand corrected.  But once Xfree86 supports loadable 
drivers for different graphics hardware it will certainly open up the market
for people, companies, and organizations that would like to offer drivers
but for some reason or another don't wish to release the source code
modifications to the original release.  Although modified forms of
Xfree86 may be distributed without fear of license infringement, a loadable
module would surely be considerably smaller and for that reason probably
more palatable to offer and be received by a general distribution.  So
there are certainly reasons independent from fear of the GPL which make
the addition of loadable drivers for Xfree86 worthwhile.

I'm working with the DLL Tools for Linux, but I'd like to find the latest
version.  Could someone please let me know?

Also, is there a way for me to debug into a shared library that these tools
generate?  I tried gdb, but all I get are my non-library source files.

Also, where can I find information on alternative shared library
implementations?  I know that gcc supports a PIC option that supposedly
allows shared libraries to be created.  Where can I get more info on that?

Everyone talks price/performance and seems to ignore what I think is
relevant, which is price/flexibility. I'm sticking with traditional PC
architecture because, for low cost, I get decent graphics, good sound,
networking, mass storage, modem connection, fair performance, and
access to scads of fuddy apps, all for low cost.

I suspect that you, like most, decide what platform you want to run on
by what kind of apps you want to run. I'm a hobbyist (as I suspect most
Linuxers are), and I like to futz with lots of things at a low level.
Linux lets me do that in software, and the PC architecture lets me do
that in hardware, both without asking me to throw lots of money at my
hobby.

I hope you find what's right for you. I've certainly found what's right
for me :)

It has nothing to do with Dosemu. Fdd drivers in many of the v1.1.4x 
kernels (including 1.1.49) won't let you mount a write-protected disk. It 
doesn't seem to be a bug, rather a deliberate choice in the fdd driver. 
Perhaps somebody from the kernel-development team would care to explain.

yes! have a look on my small DCF77 program. since there are not much docs,
archie won't find it ;-)  but it's available on

        ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de:/tmp/dcf77-koenig.tar.gz

(thanks to Gert Doering for this place).


it uses RX at 50 baud and, if available, DCD with a special kernel patch
for getting the times stamp in kernel and not in user mode (~12 usec 
interrupt latency instead of ~10 ms before the user process gets scheuled)
and of course uses adjtime to correct the clock.

I'm getting about +/- 100 usec errror per minute with a very cheep receiver
(UA 2775 based).

feel free ask, make comments, add documentation, ...

Harald

PS: why do you want to use DCD for the DCF77 pulses? 
the UART (16450/16550) samples the RX input with 16 times baudrate 
(16*50baud == 800 Hz == 1.25 ms). so you get a jitter of 1.25ms with 
every second pulse (plus 190ms delay after the leading edge for 1/2 start bit
plus 8+1 data/stop bits). on DCD you the an exacty interrupt for the 
signal edges (~12 usec interrupt latency for a 486/DX2-66)

I am using the beta PPP driver, and I don't notice any speed difference

The FTP throughput depends on many things, e.g. distance from the server, 
modems, etc. With 1.1.45 kernel (with its own ppp.c driver), I was

I too am seeing this. With an older bootpd (from Slackware?), I could get

I have been having trouble with floppy disks. I haven't used the 3.5"
ones much and can't tell by looking at it whether it's write-protected
(I seem to remember 8" ones had a hole meaning you couldn't write,
and 5.25" ones have a hole meaning you can, and 3.5" ones have this little 
tab...)

Anyhow, I mounted a floppy under Linux, deleted some files,
copied some others on, got a directory listing, unmounted it and went 
home with the disk in my pocket. At home, lo and behold, the
old files were still there and no new one.

With some help from the net, I found my console wasn't working 
and logging wasn't writing to it. That fixed, there is still a problem.
Everything appears to work fine right up until the umount (or sync), when the
console displays error messages.

I would like to see some checking done at mount time, so that mount 
would only mount a write-protected device readonly. Then I'd get a message
on stderr when I tried to write to it.

As you'll have to upgrade to a 1.1.* kernel, try to get the latest patches
in order to avoid bugs. Grab the ppp pack (2.1.1 seems to be the current

Yikes!  My HDs are a Conner and a WD.  Since writing the above, however, I
have gone up to the 1.1.49 kernel, and now have some minor problems with
filesystems on floppies.  I only discovered this when experimenting with
something posted in another thread here though, as I almost never put 
filesystems on floppies.  It seems to be being worked very actively, too,
so I'm confident it will be straightened out before long.

It's on sunacm.swan.ac.uk. Get the one from Updates as that will also work
correctly with later 1.1.x kernels. There is also a bootp client if you
feel the urge to write a DHCP client too. The bootp server code is as far as
I can remember a cleaned up BSD bootpd

Ok. Who do I send the diffs to when I'm done? Is there a way to specify
the name of the kernel, like in 4.1.x? The closest thing I could find
was a file called version.h.

The oldest machine I've worked with is a sparc 330, so I guess that
makes me a young whippersnapper :). And on all the sparcs I've worked
with, the boot EEPROM takes care of most of that stuff. Before we
went Death Star, all I ever did was copy the customized /vmunix to
the root partition, and reboot.

You guys are talking about xntp-3.3 ;^) besides the xntp daemon which
keeps track of the time using a PLL, there's also dcfd which does not
support the NTP protocol but sets the time by adjtime() and ntpdate
which picks the time off a NTP server. xntp-3.3 is on sunsite. More
info about NTP in comp.protocol.ntp. My DCF77 clock radio cost less than
$20 and works perfectly fine with xntp-3.3p. There are newer beta versions,
though (3.4).

Do NOT set the time once a day. You can run into bad problems when your 
clock is fast, setting back the time. You'd violate the time's monotony :(
adjtime() alone isn't a good solution either because if reception fails, 
the clock will run with its own drift. xntpd compensates for the drift by
using a PLL, so if the reception fails, xntpd can adjust your system clock 
for quite a while until reception is back. 

xntp-3.3 also supports a number of GPS receivers.

You might as well wait for iX 10/94... ;^) There were several articles 
how to build DCF receivers in the German magazine ELRAD in the past few 
years. The most recent one was in issue 2/93.

No, Rob, it's been done. There's also a hint how to build a 5V-RS232
level converter in the xntp-3.3 archive. A better one will be in iX 10/94.

Ciao,

Please look at the xntp3.3q package again. I have found in it a nice
program for syncing my Linux-PC without the (I also think it is to complex
for a single Linux-PC) xntpd running. It is quite hidden, so I don't
remember the exact place :-(. 
There is a daemon and a test programm with verbose ASCII-Graphics-Output.
The dcf-clock must be connected to a serial port ( :-( ).

If you had a Quantum PD210A IDE HD you would probably have a destroyed
partition table. I distroyed mine with the 1.1.44 kernel while a 1.1.22 did
work. The 1.1.49 kernel seems to have fixed this particular problem, but I
did not yet try it.
