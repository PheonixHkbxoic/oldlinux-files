I have seen this, always with the "new" fast driver on tsx-11.  If

Yup, Yup, Yup.

Those who use it without crashing either use the slow driver, or use
swapping to a non-IN2000 disk, or swap to a file.  The IN2000 slow
driver comes with patches to the kernel to force swapping to happen
in 512 byte chunks.  (I know, it's lame, but it works).  The "new"
driver allows 4096 byte transfers to happen -- most of the time.
Eventually a latent bug shows up -- it could be in the firmware, for
all I know -- and the bus locks up.  Good luck debugging it!

: messages, that I cannot bootup again. 

Since the system is still running, <ctrl>-<scroll> is still functioning.
Try patching some IN2000 status routine printer into that routine.
If you need help crashing your SCSI, e-mail me for a copy of "thrash"
that exercises arbitrary amounts of swap-space.  <grin>

I tuned dip-337 some time ago to return an exitcode from the dip script.
Now you can say "exit 5" in the script, and dip returns "5" to the shell.
This allows me to auto-redial if a recoverable error (such as BUSY) 
occurs. I sent the respective patch to Uri Blimenthal but didn't
receive an answer. Seems he's not too interested. If anyone wants
the patch (actually, five or six lines more), drop me a note.

Can any developer tell me if the code in ~/linux/drivers/scsi/seagate.c
will support this card?  The board has a TMC-950 chip on it, but the
kernel cannot find it.  Does the TMC-950 referenced in the comments
in the code refer to a *board* or the *chip*?  

This model of the board does _not_ have a BIOS chip on it, does the 
driver need one?  If this driver does not work, does anyone have a 
(pre) alpha driver that I can try?

Thanks for any and all responces,
Andrew

        Such facilities do exist, and SparcBook computers act
        quite much like you describe, however not all the things
        are saveable, especially this is true with external
        communication -- say, remote end wants to timeout in
        X seconds, and the system is off for X+1 seconds ?

        Another environment/way to do it is implemented on IBM
        SP2 supercomputer (multi-cpu processor cluster) on which
        processes can be migrated in between the individual
        processors!  (Which said processors are independent
        AIX running systems each.)

....

>Any comments?  Anyone know of the program that did something like

        On BSD systems there is a  gcore  program, which is used to
        do several "weird" things, like checkpoint dumping of running
        programs -- generally there is no way to CONTINUE such
        program from a dump, just a way to make a core-snapshot..

        However preservation of process external status, (like files
        and TCP sockets, ) is going to be a lot more difficult!

        I think that when a "shutdown" is hit on the SparcBook, it
        writes ENTIRE core-state to the disk, and when it comes up
        again, that state is retrieved from the disk as is.
        (That includes the contents of the display RAM...)

        Device drivers must also be up to the task, several (all?)
        need special resetting on powerup, and running kernel can't
        be thrown in, unless the devices are on proper state.

        I don't think a kernel change can be done under such conditions.

I think you misunderstood the license terms. It says $99/$149 per cpu (i.e.

say?) The $10k (source?) license makes sense for sites with hundred(s) of

Argh!  This is the third time I've seen this this week.  The only real
difference between a 486SX and a 486DX is the math coprocessor -- the
DX has one and the SX doesn't.  The _3_86SX has a 16 bit external bus,
but even it still has 32-bit registers.

Now, I suppose I should mention that Cyrix's 486SLC chips are designed
to fit into a 386SX socket, more or less, so they have a 16 bit
external bus, but Intel's 486SX does not.

I seem to remember reading a while back about a program that
checkpointed running processes.  This strikes me as being a 
very interesting start for a larger project.  One thing that
I've always disliked is that when I reboot I have to set 
everything up again (i.e. boot X, run my programs, position
the windows, etc.)  I know that there are ways to save my
desktop, but I'm going one step beyond this.  In a perfect
OS/World, one could hit a large Red checkpoint button, and have
the state of all running processes saved onto disk, including
the state of IPC/file desciptors/etc. and make there a way for
this to be restored upon reboot (even up to the pids of the
processes -- why not?!)  I realize that this requires support
at multiple levels of the kernel to handle this persistance, 
but as with many ideas, one could take an incremental approach.
In OS/2, for example, when I reboot I get the same applications
that I was running, but of course it doesn't do checkpointing
of DOS/Windows programs, or even OS/2 programs I believe.  But
it looks nice.  Imagine a future where one recompiles a kernel, 
reboots into DOS just for the heck of it, and then boots up 
Linux again, to have X come up, the raytrace that has been going 
for the last week to continue, the TCP/IP connections to reestablish
themselves, and the two dosemu sessions to continue with the
EPIC Pinball games they were busy with. :)  It seems that different
applications try to support this persistance in a user visable way
(i.e. an option to continue an interrupted raytrace, or a save desktop
option in a window manager), but doing it with kernel support (i.e. 
SIGCHKPNT) is of course much more powerful.

Any comments?  Anyone know of the program that did something like
this already?  Remember this is just sort of a wishful post, not
a design document or a volunteer notice :)

Ummm... it's certainly be possible.  But make sense?  Last I checked,
fast/wide scsi 2 cards weren't exactly cheap.  Granted, it's faster
than ethernet, but how many people really, seriously, need more
than 10Mbits on their LAN?  Especially at home (the main Linux
presence).  The cabling for it would be a nightmare (25 pairs, not
just 2 as in 10baseT, *and* you have to worry about termination).

It's a cool idea, and perhaps useful in a Desk-Area-Network concept
(put an xterminal on your system via scsi and use that as your main
display, etc).  But it's not well suited as a general LAN technology.

From: gu@gus.kiel.org (Gunnar Kempke)
Subject: NCR-SCSI,Audio-CDs => kernel-panic
Date: Thu, 29 Sep 1994 09:36:21 GMT

Hello all!

My system: PCI/I-P5MP3 ASUS-board (BIOS ver 2.01) with NCR53C810-SCSI
           (BIOS ver 3.04), SCSI-HD, Toshiba 4101B SCSI-CDROM
           Kernel 1.1.19 with Drew's NCR-Driver Release 3

My problem: Every time I start playing an Audio-CD (with Workbone, Workman,
            doesn't matter), my system crashes. Everything else (including
            CD-Rom operations) works just fine. How come?

tia,

Gunnar
