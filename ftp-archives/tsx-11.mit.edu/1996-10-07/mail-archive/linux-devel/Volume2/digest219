Well, my Yygdrasil disk came with a pascal to c compiler (compiles pascal 
code to c code) called p2c.  I'm not sure where its from though...

Youa re most probobly dead on here.  The big problem in CD-ROm based 
programming (we do it for a living at Crystal Dynamics) is the seek time 
of a CD-ROM drive.  If you seek more than abt. 20meg away from, your 
current position, it gets VERY slow.  This is because CD-ROM is a CLV 
(continuos linear velocity) medium.  In order to pack maximum data on the 
disc, it actually changes rotational speeds durign these longer seeks.  
This emans that you have to wait for it to spin-up or spin-down to the 
right speed.

As a general storage medium, CD-ROM as it currently exists is really only 
appropriate as a long-term storage and/or distribution medium 9my 
opinion, since you asked).  When you are writing a CD_ROM based game or 
'multi-media' (god, i hate that term) product, you can design an entire 
strategy around the limits of the medium, but those are special cases.
(My opinion, since you asked ;)  )

Ok. I have to give you this one.  I keep forgetting that obscene amounts 
of ram are becoming more and mroe common.  IF you have enough ram to use 
your ram as virtual disk, rather then using your disk as virtual ram, you 
could probobly run UNIX off of tape! ;)

You guys obviously have a problem with your Fig and/or Fig-color
apps-defaults file(s).

Here's how long it takes me to start and quit xfig 2.1.8 (without
loading a .fig file) on a 386-33 with 8 MB or memory:

{/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults} date; xfig; date
Fri Sep 23 11:22:43 EDT 1994
Fri Sep 23 11:23:07 EDT 1994
{/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults} 

As for memory usage:

USER        PID %CPU %MEM SIZE  RSS TT STAT START   TIME COMMAND
hal         909  5.7 12.4 1090  876 p1 S    11:25   0:07 xfig

Less than a week ago, someone reported in c.o.l.h that there's a
problem with the app-defaults file, though I compiled 2.1.8 from
the standard distribution some time ago and never had this bizarre
problem.

Perhaps it is an artifact of some distribution.

Follow-ups directed to c.o.l.h, as this is obviously not a Linux
kernel development related issue.  Hell, it's arguably not even
a Linux related issue.

Actually the kernel NULL pointer trap is much older then the Linux
qmagic support. It was introduced in one of the < 0.98 kernel versions.
I remember, that one of the syscalls done by login failed, so I had to
compile an older kernel on a friends machine.

Windows NT runs fine on multi-pentium machines, and nt3.5 looks pretty

Here may be a shock: BINARIES LINKED AGAINST THE ELF/PIC LIBRARY MAY RUN

PIC/ELF library is being fine tuned which may speed it up significantly.
But the old a.out/DLL library is never tuned. At the worst case, I am
expecting no more than 5% slow down against the fine tuned a.out/DLL
library. Remember only libraries are compiled with PIC.

The patch 50 works fine for me.

Subject: ncr53c810, Linux, SCSI drive appears multiple times
Date: 22 Sep 1994 21:38:38 GMT

I have an NCR53c810 SCSI controller card, and a PCI bus machine.  I'm
using the Slackware Linux NCR boot disk.  After much pain and misery,
I got the Linux kernel to see the NCR controller and the SCSI drive.
The problem is that it thinks I have 7 identical disks, it seems to
see the same drive on every possible SCSI id.  I can partition the
disk with fdisk, but when I go into the Slackware setup, it apparently
sees all the ghost disks, and dies.

Of course, my NCR53C810 card doesn't have a BIOS on it, and I suspect
my Motherboard BIOS doesn't support the NCR controller.  The only
thing the (Award) BIOS has that sounds promising is "On board PCI/SCSI
BIOS".  I was kind of hoping that meant the BIOS was on board, but I
suppose it is only for motherboards that have a SCSI controller
on-board?  Am I out of luck?  Perhaps the Award BIOS can be upgraded
to a newer version that does support the NCR controller?

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

I had the same problem, but the remedy is simple. Bring up your editor

RCS is GNU software. Check prep.ai.mit.edu or one of its mirrors near you.
CVS works on top of RCS and allows version control of entire source trees.

        Hi fellow Linux-ers!

        We need some help over here in the Amiga Linux camp. We're gearing up
for an X11 port (fun, fun, fun!). To start with, we basically need a device 
driver that can mmap() the Amigas coprocessor registers into the user space. 
Is there a document around that gives hints how to do this? The old Linux
character device driver manual skips over the mmap part... :-(

        All we really need is:

        open()
        mmap()
        unmap()
        close()

        ...and a way to wake up the user process upon reception of a
hardware interrupt (from the blitter)

        I know someone out there must know how to do this!

        Thanks!

        I don't have any direct experience with Floptical's under Linux.
        However it is a SCSI device (looks pretty much like a Bernoulli
        to the device drivers used by DOS and Windows -- i.e. no special
        drivers needed for access -- but there was a special format 
        program.

   Last I read Patrick Volkerding was trying to implement something like
   this for Slackware 2.0.  I would get the readme file for that 
   distribution (sunsite.unc.edu:\pub\linux\distributions\slackware? or
   somewhere off of ftp.cdrom.com?) and see if it ever got tested.

   You'd have to write the slackware disksets to the tape in a specific
   order which he specified in one of his readme's.

At least on the x86, you just do it - there is no "execute" protection
in the page tables, and Linux has the code segment span the whole 3GB
address range. malloc() the memory you need, put your code there,
and jump to it.

You probably want to have a look at libdld (the GNU dynamic linker)
to save a lot of work.

I have tried both of the proposed GNU-TAR for windows. Both seem to have 
problem with my config.

In all cases, the process terminate with a message like this on the 
Windows side:
     "The virtual circuit was reset by the remote site."

I have been looking for a while on how to backup my notebook on a 
reliable way since my tape drive in on my Linux box. Here I found that 
somebody has ported the gnu-tar to Windows. Good work.
 
What is the tape length? Here is what I get, I know that the 'unformated' 
tape is 120MB for a Jumbo250, but once formatted???

I have done a simple test which has run ok.
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/ftape count=120 bs=1024k

This was supposed to write 120MB of null to the tape.
Returned no errors.

now when I use tar then there seem to have some problems writing to the 
tape, ALWAYS get I/O errors.

Here is the command used with WinTar:
 > rsh explorer "tar -cvf - @\\cyborg\dosc\wapps\explorer.bkf -L 120M -V

Explorer" | dd bs=10240 of=/dev/ftape 

Here is the results:

 dd: /dev/ftape: I/O error
 0+11356 records in
 0+11355 records out
| 


Note that for every test the records count differ (+-500 @ 11356).

Now what is the problem?
My Adaptec 1742A?
My Quantum HD?
Tape buffer size? (3)
Tape backup (Jumbo250MB)
GNU-TAR for Unix? (I suppose nothing to do with the windows side!)
My 486DX50 too fast for the streamer?
XIRCOM III <-> WD80x3E ?
Linux 1.1.51?
Something else?

I don't suppose that it is a bad tape as the 120MB of zeros worked!

Please somebody give me an answer, I don't like the idea of having data 
(525MB Linux + 200MB DOS AST Notebook) not backed up for too long and it 
already been.
