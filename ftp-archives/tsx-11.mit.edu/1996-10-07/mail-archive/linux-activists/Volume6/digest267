Subject: PPP for Linux
Date: 27 Sep 1993 15:28:06 GMT

I am going to be working on a project soon that will require the use of PPP.
I have asked why not SLIP (since it is built into the Linux kernel, and from
what I understand, works rather nicely), but it has already been decreed that
PPP will be used.  I am wondering if anyone can tell me if anyone has
successfully ported PPP to Linux, and if they did, does it require kernel
hacking.  I have gathered some sources for PPP, but the closest I have found
is Berkeley BSD 4.3 code that requires kernel hacking to get it running.  I
do not look forward to hacking the kernel at all.  That is best left to people
who know what they are doing.  I would really appreciate any info anyone
can spare.

Thank you.

Emacs-like!?!?  Hahahah!  Maybe I am wrong, but isn't JOE ==> "Joe's
Own Editor" which is distributed w/ SLS?  If so, it is HARDLY like
Emacs and more closely resembles Wordstar for DOS.  Sorry, I am just a

Is the display you are seeing vertically stable, but looks like it has
three or so tiny copies of the screen horizontally? That's what I'm
getting on an IBM PS/1 with a CLGD5426. And again 800x600 words fine
for me. And 1024x768 definitely works fine in Windows.

I'm beginning to wonder if the XFree86 cirrus driver is really complete.
That is, if it needs to set some of the chip mode registers slightly
differently than it does now; possibly a horizontal clock divisor???

I've been trying to figure out how Windows gets 1024x768 out of the
same hardware, and I did find something that looks interesting, but
I may be reading too much into it.  In the system.ini file, there's
a section at the bottom labeled "CLVGA". For 1024x768, there are
lines "Mode=96" and "Dots Per Inch=120". (or something like that).
For smaller resolutions, there's something like "Mode=95" and
"Dots Per Inch=96".

What do you mean: "rather slow"?

It is one of the fastest CDROM drives on the market. It is said to
be able to read with "double speed", and IT DOES.

My Linux-driver sbpcd0.4.tar.gz reads from that Matsushita / Kotobuki /
 Panasonic / CreativeLabs drive (regardless which interface you are
using - "sound" or "no-sound", "SoundBlaster" or "LaserMate") with a
rate of 300 kB/sec. Anyone seen something better ??? :-)

With that drive, that driver and a "special" CDROM (that is one which
is more than a snapshot of any server) - the YGGDRASIL is best-known
here - you can build a "CDROM dependent" LINUX installation which
keeps your mass storage devices almost free - and the transfer
speed with files on that CD is in the range of IDE harddisk transfer
times.
 
> Any other recommendations (money is an object)?

Spend your money on that drive and a couple of CDs.

I think it is legal.  Section 2 says

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

If you look in magazines, people sell gnu stuff for big dollars on tape
and cd.  They still have to provide source, though.  If they don't
provide source, section 4 lists alternatives.  One is

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          ...

I think the two sections are causing the confusion here.

The problem is that your PC's BIOS cannot find an operating system
so it has to revert to an old quirk, boot rom-basic.  Rom basic 
was included on the first PC's sold by IBM.  You have to install 
Lilo, which I think places it self at the top of the disk where the
Master Boot Record is (MBR).  From there it tells BIOS  to boot the
Kernel or another option that you can specify.

I was able to install Linux 0.99pl12 SLS 1.03 on a 20MB laptop. I used the
base installation with prompts and answered no to the stuff I didn't need.
Basically the system includes everything but Emacs, UUCP, GhostScript, News,
and the kernel source. The source would be neccessary if you ever wanted
to update or customize the kernel, but if you've got a friend with the
full system, they could compile a zImage for you.

Subject: DOS/LINUX partitions do not agree
Date: 27 Sep 1993 21:00:51 GMT

I ran into problems partitioning my drives for linux.  I was running
FDISK from DRDOS 6.0, partitioned 2 drives for DOS, and listed them to
be sure I had it right.  It said the first drive was C, and the second
drive was D (loical drive).  That was all fine, but when I ran FDISK
for Linux, it said that drives C and D were /dev/hda3 and /dev/hda4,
respectively.  So I figured, "OK, I'll make /dev/hda1 and dev/hda2 as then
Linux partitions, so I did.  When I rebooted, DOS didn't see its partitions (it
would not boot up to DOS)  It seems that DOS thinks partitions 1 and 2 are
DOS (but according to linux, they are 3 and 4).  I got around this by 
making four partitions using the DOS fdisk, and then changing the 
characteristics of /dev/hda3 and /dev/hda4 to Linux partitions.  I read that
this is not advides, so I was wondering if I did something wrong using FDISK
or something weird is going on.  I never read anything on this group
about DOS partitions "moving" in Linux.  Can anyone enlighten me?
