I just saw a rather slow CD that nevertheless supported Kodak
multi-session format.  It was called Panasonic CR 562.  I wonder if
anyone used it successfully with Linux?  Any other recommendations
(money is an object)?  Also, anyone has used the latest HP "el cheapo"
4L laser printer?  Would the postscript version (4ML) be more
adviseable?  Thanks,

Tony

Yes, they DO work :-) 
You have to get Peter Bauer's patch for 99p11+ .
We are (at work) an all DEC shop, so all our PC's are equipped with
either DEPCA's or the newer 16 bit DE200 ETHERWORKS TURBO.
No problem to use those NIC's.

I don't know where to ftp the patches (I got them from PB direct because
he lives pretty close to my place :-)) but it should be 
something like depca-05.tgz.

And here comes README.DEPCA

Try your neighborhood GNU mirror, or

if the following (from the info doc) is what you're looking for:

      This file documents the the GNU `time' command for running programs

Subject: Word Processor for Linux (lout)
Date: Sat, 25 Sep 1993 23:20:02 GMT




  There is a documentformatting package called lout which compiles
clean for Linux. It was posted ca. 3 weeks ago in comp.sources.misc.
Lout is much more newbie-aware than TeX, and it is remarkable for its
ease of use. It outputs Level I/II PostScript directly (no .dvi stage),
and you can drop in any compressed Adobe fonts for the PC which use the
.afm ending. It supports encapsulated postrscipt images, and has its own
native figure generating and symbolic math language.

                                    
 Lout will install in about 2 MB of disk space, but requires about 8
to compile and set it up.
 
     
For really small jobs, I am not using  the emacs-like editor called
Joe which is absolutely wonderful, and does things like underlining
and centering. It suffices for quick jobs, and has support for 7-bit
and 8-bit characters.

Brad --

Metro Link has been selling Motif for a while now and you are the
first complaint that I've seen so far.  Sounds to me like you might
want to try installing it again or talking to the company instead
of going to the net.   The problem you are experiencing could be
something that has nothing to do with either Metro Link's software
nor the SLS distribution.   How long did you look into the problem
before posting this note?  Does Metro Link have a support policy?
Did you call them?

I'm not ragging on you personally here, but I just don't  like seeing
users not take the time to look into the problem themselves before
blasting messages all over the net -- especially if the messages
are not justified.

-k

"Thank you for listening"

PS:  I don't have Metro Link's Motif, but I know they are in the FAQ.
     Look in there to get more info.  Maybe there is an email address
     where you can contact them.

Subject: Compiling Khoros for Linux.

Hello,

I have some questions  regarding the port of Khoros to Linux.
I got the original source and system files plus the patches by Wolfram Gloger.
My current version of Linux is 0.99pl12, I use gcc 2.4.5 and f2c-1993.04.2.8.
I applied the  patches against the Khoros source and system files, however
I failed to compile the program.  After some work I was able to compile Khoros
but I had to rewrite linux.cf file to implement my system configuration
(Wolfram uses SYSV and I like BSD).
Most of the Khoros' programs seem to work fine (I tested  editimage, putimage,
xprism3, xprism2, animate, many "vroutines"). However, there is a problem with
cantata. I get zombies every time when executing the routine (it gets pretty
bad after a while of using it :-( ). It seems that neither Wolframs patch to
src/xvroutines/Lib/xvforms/signal.c (replacing kill(pid, 0) with waitpid(...) )
nor the original version (I tried both) work for me.

Does any one have idea what can be done to fix this problem?
I tried to contact Wolfram Gloger at wmglo@dent.med.uni-muenchen.de (regarding
his Linux patch) but the e-mail gets bounced back.

Any form of help would be appreciated!

ALL shadow is OFF. 
LILO is not installed. 
ATI VGA Wonder 512k video card.
PAS 16 Audio card
The rest is likely not significant.

I am running the Slackware pl13 release of Linux.

I get the bugs while running stuff, mostly when I put stuff in the

Please help.  Thanks!
