        Don't know abt. mgetty, but getty_ps does just that for data -
no fax support.  It works just like real-live uugetty but better in that
it will let you set up a modem initialization string to send each time
the modem is released from use (either uucp drops it or it drops from
terminal mode.) as well as being able to use Dialers file type "expect-
send" chat entries.  This allows the modem to autobaud and the getty
software to adjust the speed so the user doesn't have to keep banging 
away on the enter or break key until the system finds a speed it's happy
with.  I think it's already installed but not active until you change
the format of the entries in inittab.  Source and doc should be found in:
                /usr/src/getty_ps (at least it is on mine :)!  )
Good luck!, Mark

        I tried to install Linux on my Gateway 66E (EISA) PC and found
        that the bootable floppy (disk a1) does not detect the 500MB
        SCSI disk.  It does detect the SCSI controller (which is the
        Ultrastor, 24F I believe) and otherwise seems functional
        (allows me to log in as root and when I try to run fdisk
        /dev/sda it comes back saying "cannot open /dev/sda").  Is it
        something I'm doing wrong?

I've got a Wangec E51000HT 1.0 GB 1/4" external tape drive and want
to use it under Linux ...

I have an Adaptec 1522, and have used it under DOS, but of course, the
1522 doesn't work under Linux so ...

I'm looking at buying another Adaptec SCSI card, so I have a few
questions ...

   - I know that xxx0 has no floppy controller and xxx2 does, so
that's no biggie.

   - But what's the difference between the Adaptec 1542B and 1542C ?

   - And how do they compare to the (EISA) 1742?

   - And what's a good price for all these cards, especially used.

(I've got a EISA 486/50 ...)

(Also, if anybody knows anything about the tape drive - what kind of
tapes do I need to use to get one gig on it, and do I have to do
anything special to do it ?)

As you can see, I have not fixed the monitor and the video card.
Any suggestion is welcome.

Problem with Linux--

I recently reinstalled Linux on my box.. and now I fear I made a mistake.

Problem:  I can't see the bottom 20 or so lines of text on my terminal.

Intention: I want a basic 80x25 text terminal.  Eventually, I may want to get
graphical text (ala a Sun) on this sucker, but only if this is available.

Error?:  I may have hit a wrong key when installing Linux this time, maybe on
the "preset graphics" part..  I don't know.


Basically, I need to find a way to determine how my terminal is set up, and
then find a way to get it to the way I want..


Any help would be greatly appreciated!  And, no, I don't yet have access to
the other comp.os.linux.* groups.  :-(

I wonder if this might be the memory fragmentation that was mentioned somewhere
else recently... do you only ever have problems when the machine has been on
for a while? Also, if you are using SLS PL12, it might the memory leak in that
kernel that is hitting you.

If it wasn't it would probably not run at all...

This bit's easy - Linux will only support up to 16MB on any one swap partition
or file. Divide your swap partition into two and run mkswap and swapon on them
individually, and you should be OK.

Although Specialix deal in intelligent I/O controllers, we do have a
dumb 4-port:

``The Specialix I/O4 is an entry level 4-port serial interface expansion
card, with full modem control. Compatible with the AST Fourport/XN
board, it supports terminals, modems and other serial devices.''

        MODEL   DESCRIPTION                     LIST PRICE
        I/O4    Non-intelligent, 4-port card    $ 300

These boards use 16C450 UARTs, which aren't socketed. We have a few of these
in stock here in the US office. I don't know if the other Specialix offices
have stock at the moment.

Initially, contact me here (jonb@specialix.com) for information.

        Yes, I've done this too, and I think my setup is OK....looks
        like the ET4000 drivers may be buggy.  I have also tried
        the NoSpeedUp option in Xconfig, but that doesn't make any
        difference.

Subject: SLS 1.3 with Ultrastore 34 Image
Date: 21 Sep 1993 01:11:55 GMT

Hi,
  I;m trying to bring up SLS (hot off of tsx-11) on a machine with
a Ultrastore 34f.  I got Image.Ultrastor, and am having a problem.
  It dies, unable to mount root device.
  I modified Image.Ultrastor as per SCSI-howto: Subection B4,
(hack a couple of bytes.)  But it did no good.
  Has anyone gotten this to work?

-s

Here is the suggestion in the HOWTO:

4.  The bootable kernel for an ALPHA driver does not work,
        resulting in a "kernel panic : cannot mount root device"
        message, or it does not work with your Linux distribution.

        You'll need to edit the binary image of the kernel (before
        or after writing it out to disk), and modify a few two byte 
        fields (little endian) to gurantee that it will work on your 
        system.  

        1.  default swap device at offset 502, this should be set to 0

        2.  ram disk size at offset 504, this should be set to the size
                of the boot floppy in K - ie, 5.25" = 1200, 3.5" = 1440.

                This means the bytes are 

                3.5" : 0xA0 0x05 
                5.25" : 0xB0  0x04

        3.  root device offset at 508, this should be 0, ie the boot
                device. 
Here is the code I used to do this:
main(){
  FILE *fp,*out;
  unsigned char c,c2; int i;

  fp=fopen("Image.UltraStor","r");
  out=fopen("NewImage","w");
  c=getc(fp);c2=getc(fp);
  for(i=0; !feof(fp); i++) {
    if (i>509) {
      putc(c,out);putc(c2,out);
    } else if (i==502) {
      putc(0,out);putc(0,out);
    } else if (i==504) {
      putc(160,out);putc(5,out);
    } else if (i==508) {
      putc(0,out);putc(0,out);
    } else {
      putc(c,out);putc(c2,out);
    }
    c=getc(fp);    c2=getc(fp);
  }
  fclose(fp);
  fclose(out);
}

Seems like it should have worked...

Hi.  I have a friend who has a 17" CTX CTS 1760 Proscan monitor and an
Orchid Celsius localbus video card.  We managed to get X running, sort
of, only the image being displayed is incredibly huge, regardless of the
resolution [we've tried 640x480, 800x600, and 1024x768, all with similar
results.  The higher resolutions shrink the picture a bit, but not enough
to make it usable.]

When we start X, the "logo" is partially displayed in the lower left
corner of the screen.  Then bash comes up in what resembles 20-column
mode.  Openwin has the same problem.. huge menus that scroll off the
screen.  By "huge" I don't mean with alot of options.. I mean the size
of the letters is gigantic.

I have tweaked all sorts of values in Xconfig, but the problem doesn't
go away.  Is there another file that controls this?

My next idea is to attempt to set the resolution to something like 2048x1024
and see what happens.

Any ideas are welcome.

Subject: Re: Where is Slackware Linux dist?
Date: 21 Sep 1993 03:24:41 GMT

Hello,

        Slackware can be found at ftp.cdrom.com in the
/pub/linux/slackware directory.  I just downloaded the stuff today -
with the exception of the stuff in the zooed directory, and it took
up 40MB to store the a1-14, e1-e5, f1, q1, x1-x11 disks.  

        Things I've noticed that SLACKWARE has, besides the same
stuff that SLS has are (to best of my knowledge):

        - networking that works
        - nfs install that works
        - pine binaries
        - TAMU package
        - latest version of Emacs (19.19)
        - the XS3-0.0.4 - for S3 accelerated video cards
        - Other editors - such as JOVE and JOE
        
        Those are just the things I can think of off the top of 
my head.  Both SLS and SLACKWARE have more or less the same
packages - the difference lies in how the series are named, 
and the quality of the install scripts.  I've done quite a few
installations of linux in the past two weeks, and the times I've
tried SLS, I haven't been able to install over NFS.  Slackware 
has worked everytime.  I also like the installation script 
SLACKWARE uses.  Good work, Patrick.

   LPD demon doesnt seem to run properly on version 1.03.  LPD doesnt appear
   in the process list after its typed (over a dozen times) and when I use
   LPR it gives a file not found.  Any ideas?

   If I switched back to an old LPD would it run on 1.03, I have the one from
   patch level 6 running around on disk still. 

   - Bryan

I was able to solve my lpd and lpr problems by running them with strace
-f in separate windows so I could watch both.  Most of the problems were
errors trying to open files or devices.

BTW, I think there's an SLS 1.03 and a Slackware 1.03 now, so you need
to specify.
