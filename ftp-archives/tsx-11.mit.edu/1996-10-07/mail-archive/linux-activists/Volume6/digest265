  I had that same problem, until I figured out which characters weren't

I once had a version of Linux fdisk, or efdisk, complaining about a bad magic
number but didn't take it too seriously. I suggest you try DOS fdisk or some
other tool such as Norton disk doctor to see if they spot the same problem.
You might find a tool that will correct the problem for you. I hope you have
got a bootable DOS floppy.

For displaying other fonts, look at fontpak.  It defines escape
sequences for two things:  downloading EGA-style fonts, and selecting
those fonts.  Each VC can have its own font.  My hebrew font and a PD

As the original poster, let me mention how I originally came up with the idea
of renting linux disks.  

1. As a recent convert from DOS to Linux, the _last_ thing I needed was
another thirty 3.5" diskettes!  I had plenty, and would have much preferred
someone letting me borrow their disks to install with and make copies from.

2. With only a 2400 baud modem, and nobody within quite a long ways running
linux, there really aren't that many alternatives!  

So I thought that offerring to make install disks available on a rental basis
might appeal to others in my situation.  Incidentally, though my initial
reaction to all the legal furor was to withdraw my offer, I am starting to
wonder if it really _is_ forbidden under the GPL.  I'm in the process of
reading it, and if we can go ahead with our plans we probably will.

Subject: The smallest Linux??
Date: 27 Sep 1993 01:26:21 GMT



I know about the SLS distribution and it's 55Meg (?) disk
requirements...  My question is, what is the smallest "neatly packaged"
(whatever that is :-]) Linux distribution? I do not need X as of right
now. Just a shell, minimal utilities, perl, and GNU C.

Can I realistically use Linux on a 30Meg partition? (I *need* a DOS
partition with at least MathCAD and pspice on it. That would take about
5M of my one and only 35M drive).

Does SLS lend itself easily to partial installation? What else could
I do?

Thanks in advance,

I just came back from a 8 day holiday, and Linux is still running

        I have a working port of CAP pl154, using UDP encapsulation. I
got everything compiled without that much effort. I nevertheless
(spelling?) have not managed to get the Shadow password support in aufs
working, ie, only works with out shadow passwds for people with null
passwds. I'll try to fix it this week, and then hopefully start looking
at Ethertalk/LocalTalk stuff. It would be very nice to see native
EtherTalk and LocalTalk support in CAP.

        I will make a patch availiable once I considere it finished.
That includes figuring out HOW to make a decent patch file ;-)

Subject: Linux Install Summary
Date: Sun, 26 Sep 1993 17:23:05 GMT

About 2 weeks ago I began the lengthy process of installing Linux on my
machine.  I'll provide this information in case it should be in FAQs or
hardware compatability files:

Gateway2000 4DX2-66Vesa Tower
Gateway2000 CrystalScan 1572FS
Diamond Speedstar Pro
8MB RAM
WD Caviar 424MB IDE Drive
Panasonic KX-P1180

The only trouble I had getting the base system installed and working was
getting the printer interrupt reset (gets set to IRQ 0x00 at boot, disabling
printer).  This was easily accomplished with the tunelp.c program.  'lpd'
easily followed that.

I've got the getty-ps distribution but have not been able to make the ring back
work.  As a matter of fact I've not been able to actually log into my machine
via modem yet.  I'm looking forward to getting this working.

XFree86 installed and worked as-is, no problems with the Diamond Speedstar Pro
as suggested by some of the literature.  No modifications have been made to
Xconfig.

OpenLook compiled (with quite a bit of hacking) and olvwm works fine now.  I
still wish there was a Motif-like Window manager out there (that is FREE!), but
OpenLook is pretty nice, especially the HUGE virtual desktop provided.

Final analysis: Linux is GREAT!!!  I couldn't have afforded a 'UNIX' this nice
if I'd had to buy one, so anyone out there who's undecided whether they want to
spend the time getting Linux up and working, trust me, it's worth it.

Cheers and GO BRAVES! 8^)

No. But you can create a soft link to your root partition or any other
partition to use those drive. For example, mount one drive as /usr1
and make a soft link from /usr1 to say /usr/spool/uucp.

OK then. I had this problem when the escape codes were wrong. Make
sure you put the codes linecheck gives you on the OTHER machine and
vice versa.
Also, I had to remove the default "ignore 17/19" lines.
Now it works excellent...

I suspect rlogin is not suid root.  I know that whenever *I* try to
compile my own little version of rlogin and don't run it as root I 
get that message :)

To fix, do a chmod 4555 /usr/ucb/rlogin and chown root /usr/ucb/rlogin.

Hope that helped..
