(From mind:)
Postgres is a three-level database system.
The top level is the postgres executable which does the direct database access.
The intermediate level is the postmaster, which does concurrency control etc.
The last level is the user program, which gives its queries to the postmaster
(which in turn gives them to the database engine, postgres).
Postgres distribution incorporates a library package to write your own programs
using the postgres database system.  To make life easier, the distribution
also incorporates a monitor program, which you (user) can use to enter queries
by hand.  Of course, you can also supply a text file which contains queries.

In short, the answer is: NO, no X-Win program, but you can write your own.

Good Luck!

I wouldn't say that. You won't get much of a rootdisk in 360k for
recovery purposes. If you have hard drive problems you would need to
borrow a HD drive again.

HD 3.5" drives are about $60 now. See if you think that's a reasonable
investment (consider that it can move with you to any future machine).

You don't need to do the mkswap in your /etc/rc. just the swapon.
This is pretty standard Unix operating procedure, nothing magical
here.

>If they don't, this should be mentioned in the FAQs 

FAQ's are not the best documentation (highly overrated in my opinion).
Get a Unix book and perhaps one on general Unix system administration.
At any rate, it *is* in black and white in the FAQ, question VIII.09.
It says to put the swapon command in your rc file for specific devices,
which of course would have worked for you, and hints that you can do it
via the fstab as well. For that method you would have had to dig a bit
but then again it's a pretty normal Unixy thing to do.

You do need to use mknod to make them but you don't have to do 
anything in the kernel to allow you to use any set amount.

Nothing wrong there... Look at "buffers". If you have RAM available and
read something from the disk, it is cached until more RAM is needed.
You have 10.6 Meg of Buffers. If you would load a program that uses more
than the 1.1 Meg you have available, the buffers would automatically be
reduced in size and more RAM would be available.

I don't know if this is already known but I have exactly the same problem.

I think I've seen a message saying that some Cirrus clone boards are bad.
May be we have both such a card.

I have another question. Before my VLB 5426 based video card, I was usind an 
ISA Paradise clone with XFree 1.2. And I now, it seems that my new card have
lower performances. This is specially true during scrolling in a xterm that
is full of text. Is it the same for every one having a 5426 board ?

I just purchased this CD-ROM from a PC show made by a company called
Infomagic. It includes Linux 0.99.10  386BSD and NetBSD source and
binaries. The Linux included seems to be a mirror of some major ftp
archive site, and includes SLS 1.01 under the /packages/SLS dir.

I've succeeded in installing the SLS package, but cannot get the
X to start. There are no scripts or binaries called xinit or startx,
contrary to the included instructions.

Am I missing something here? Any help will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.

   After hearing some very positive comments about Linux, I decided to go
ahead and install it on my system.  Before doing so, I read all the FAQs
and information I could find, and I discovered that Diamond cards are not
supported.

   I was told by an expert Linux user that the video drivers necessary
for using a Diamond Stealth VRAM with Linux are available somewhere
on the net.  I'd like to know where I might possibly find them, how solid
they are, and how to go about installing them (being new to Linux, I
haven't the slightest).

  If you have any information, please e-mail me, as I'm rather anxious to
try out Linux with X-Windows.  Thank you.

Well, actually Mark, I don't think he did.
yasee, Unix, as an Operating system, when you consider all the
built-in functions  (news, mail, write or chat)  It has the basic
makings to provide excelent BBS services.  It makes sense
to provide a menu (bbs like) shell interface for the user to 
protect him from the unix shell prompt, then use the built
in functions of mail, etc to do the work of the bbs.

I believe one of the greatest obstacles of doing that are the following:

One, for most bbs's it is a simple matter to remove a user  from
the list of users for bbs management.

Two, Most bbs's use a singular user for the bbs for the following:
this way you can have NEW users, and this way you can have just
one user, one set of permissions to regulate and keep sheltered
from other users. (should you have any)

It is difficult for someone to get an id, create an entry in the
/etc/passwd file, allow him limited access, promote, etc, etc, etc
in the current OS.  If you have one login for the bbs, and it
is public knowlege, you could build up users from that list.  Loyal
and current users who would like their own id could be accomodated for.

enough for now

Does anyone have a fully working X configuration/setup for the IBM PS/1?

I have PS/1 "Executive Consultant" series boxes. The basic SLS 1.03 install
worked fine when LILO got the right hard disk parameter information.

The display is fully capable of a 1024x768 resolution. But when I try that
in X, the display is wildly screwed up. The obvious guess is that the timing
info in the Xconfig file isn't fully correct. I can probably figure it out,
but has anybody already done it?

Are you kidding?  I've seen them for more like $45.  I bought an EHD

But I agree, it'll need some sort of higher density floppy, or Ethernet, or

I am using the same Linux and had to fiddle around quite a lot to add
a new user. Two hints: use `passwd -f user' (you must be root) to `forget'
the current password. Set the aging parameters to 0 10000 -1 -1; type
