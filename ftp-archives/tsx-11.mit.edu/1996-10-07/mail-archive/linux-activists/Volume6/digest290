[...printer...]

Have you got a link from /var to /usr ? (If not, do 'ln -s /usr /var')
If so, is there a directory /var/spool/lpd ?
If so, is there a file /var/spool/lpd/lock AND/OR /var/spool/lpd/lpd.lock ?
If so, remove them !

Subject: How to send signals from device drivers
Date: Wed, 6 Oct 1993 14:32:23 GMT

Hello hackers,

I'm currently writing a devicedriver for the DAS-12 I/O-board.
I try to use dma to fill a 64k block an take advantage of the dma counter
which loops after 64k. Before this loop happens I have to check out if
some of the dma-memory, for example 32k, has been allready filled and
then send a signal to the user program which had started the data recording.
My problem is how to send the signal. I studied the kernel hackers guide allready
but didn't find any note how to send a signal from a kernel driver to an user
program.
If somebody knows where to look, I would be happy if he could share his
knowledge with me.

Bye, Ove.

Start your xterm with the optione '-ls' ! 

That way xterm will read the .login or .profile because it'll act
as a login shell.

Please note that "HZ" on Linux is 100, not 60, unlike most other common
Unix systems (SunOS, Ultrix, *BSD, etc.).  Since 5217.4 / 8695.7 is
*exactly* 60/100, it's clear that the time taken under Linux was exactly
the same as the time taken under 386BSD.  Note also that the "Dhampstone"
results were identical.

Remember, these are designed to CPU-only benchmarks, so they don't
exercise the OS at all.  Leave those "shared library" theories at home :-)

I find this hard to believe. Subjectively on a 4Mb machine I found Linux
faster however straight CPU benchmarks were within 5% for 386BSD, Linux,
SCO, Interactive 3.2 when using the same compiler.

Subject: Xterm connect.with XDMCP in X11R5 (sls1.03)
From: rene@brinta (Rene' van Dalen)
Date: 6 Oct 93 10:37:26 GMT

hi,I'm trying to make XDMCP connections from an Xterminal to my linux server
Whenever the Xterminal does an XDMCP request to the Linux server the linux
server doesn't respond...

So what I'm trying to do is setup a Remote Xterminal that sends a XDMCP request
to the linux server for a login window....and then just work on the Xterminal
instead of the console.....

I'm running SLS 1.03 and I also have problems with XDM ....when I start it with 
the display going to the console (normal setup) it will only allow me to login 
three times..then the server will go down and I need to do a reboot...
    
Can Anybody help me with these 2 problems ??

Thanks in Advance,

a) obviously this NCR video card has no et4000 ;)
   comment everything OUT in file /usr/X386/lib/X11/Xconfig that belongs to
   vga256, comment IN what belongs to vga2.
   Then cd /usr/bin/X11; rm X; ln -s XF86_Mono X

b) your mouse device is wrong.
   edit Xconfig with the correct one. I dunno, what YOU have. *I* use a
   Logitech Pilot, which will be 
        Microsoft "/dev/ttyS0"

c) Never mind Roman_M

This seems to be a bug.
You can work around by pressing ALT-F<another console>.
E.g. ALT-F2 if you started X on screen 1 (the bootup screen)

The following was recently posted by af426@yfn.ysu.edu (Eric E. Bardes) as
an answer to a similar question:

In the mount options it allows for the specification of uid, gid, and umask.
I have a special group called "dos" (gid=30) that I issue to anyone i want to
be able to read/write my dos partition.  This is also good for floppies.

From the shell:
$ mount -t msdos -o uid=0,gid=30,umask=007 /dev/sda2 /dos

In /etc/fstab:
/dev/sda2       /dos    msdos   uid=0,gid=30,umask=007

This should be added to the FAQ.

   Hello fellow Linuxers, please take a decision: the decision where to post

   list is split up that long now, most sites now should carry all the COL.* now.
   Or am I wrong there?

You are not wrong but I should add that if you do decide to cross-post
(anywhere on usenet) then at least have the common courtesy to do it
properly - post one copy of the article to multiple groups not
multiple copies. This way anyone with a decent newsreader will only

Dear everybody,
I just get so frustrated on configuring for X. I am to Linux and X windows. When I try to use startx to run Xwindows, it gave a error message like this:
Could not open default font'fixed'
because it is in none of the fontpath directories.
But I have changed the config, so that the system can reach all of the 
fontpath that given from the SLS packages. Also, I have problems with video
setting! I have a Zenith 486SX25, but I have no idea what video card I have..I guess is a paradise's. I hope if anyone can provide me information to config my Xwindows, I will greatly appreciate your help!!

Waiting your help!
