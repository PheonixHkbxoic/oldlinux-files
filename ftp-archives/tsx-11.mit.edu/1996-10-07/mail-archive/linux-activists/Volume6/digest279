I have only one serial port, COM1 IRQ4.  Before I recompiled the kernel

Currently, it's not possible to increase the size of the standard filesystems
(e2fs, xiafs, minix). I've heard of it as something to do, but nobody seems
to be on it. Nevertheless, you can mount the new filesystem under the old one,
getting some of the least used parts, and almost fill this new filesystem.
This way you can save space on your old, assumed bigger, filesystem.

Hope this helps,

Try getting some of the distributions by ftp. The directions are:
SLS and MCC:

   sunsite.unc.edu               /pub/Linux
Slackware:
   ftp.cdrom.com                 /pub/linux/slackware
Each has it's advantages and inconvenients. SLS is the most complete, MCC is
the most stable, and Slackware the most up to date (or so say people from
any of this distributions).

Happy Linuxing! (You'll find yourself killing MS-DOS on your other disk 8^)

Subject: xauth doesn't work properly (SLS .99/p12)
Date: 1 Oct 1993 13:47:19 GMT

I set up SLS version 0.99/p12 without too much problem. After configuring X
there occured some problems with the xauth-security.

1) Using the xdm-Display Manager a MIT-Magic-Cookie is built that works fine.
The only drawback ist, that there is no random code used (as described in the
man-pages) but allways ffffffffffffff....    . 
What can I do to use a random hex-code????

2) Using xinit the Magic-cookie-mechanism doesn't work at all.
I create my files with xauth:
       xauth -f .Xauthority
             add maus:0 . 12345555555333333333333355555455
             add maus/unix:0 . 23423423423432423432222222222224
             exit

(maus acually is my machine's name)

then trying to use this thing with 
       xinit -- -auth .Xauthority

doesn't work.


What is the problem.

I'm running on a network and would also like to use the
magic-cookie-mechanism to connect to other machines. Therefore I copied the
Xauthority file to a nfs-mounted directory and everything is fine with the
xdm (there remains of course this fffffff...    problem) but nothing is
working with xinit.

When trying to run Xmem the Xmem window is displayed for

   "A configured device found,but display modes could not be resolved"
(4)How can I use the Linux to configured a network.Use netware or something els

It's not easy to divide a single partition later to have a second
partition for whatever. Especially newbies should keep a small
DOS partition.

This will work only if you have more than 4 MB of RAM. Without
a swap partition you will run out of memory already during 
installation if you have only 4MB. 
Even with more RAM it is a good idea to have a swap partition.
Swap files are possible, but slow.

So I would recommend to have at least 3 partitions:
        1 DOS
        2 linux
        3 linux-swap

Hi Neters

I have it working great here now.... took some effort though.  WP is the ONLY
program I know of with a full graphical preview mode for text terminals.

I have not yet gotton the "formula view" to work right- there are problems.
I have reported them to WP, and they are working on it.  It is due to the
emulation mode switchover it does on the terminal, it causes the "special"
keys like arrow and function keys to not work.

What path does the SLS install program look for if I want to install
the distribution from a hard drive.  When I try to do it from the hard
drive it looks like it mounts the /mnt to the DOS partition since
I tell it to use /dev/hda1 and hda1 is the dos partition.  I made an
install directory on the DOS partition with an "a2" directory just
like it is at the ftp site, but the install program says it can't
find the files in /mnt/install.

I have had problems with floppies so I am trying to find a way to
install off of the DOS partition.  I finally found out about sysinstall.
I tried sysinstall -doprompt -series x and it prints out on screen:

//install/catalog/diskx1: no such file or directory
. 
. 
. 
. 
. 
and so forth.


How many different ways are there to install this stuff?!?!

If anyone could help me, it would be great!!

It would be a good idea to include all Linux sources so that everybody
is free to compile the stuff new with up to date compiler and libraries.

I think all gnu sources and Linux diffs would be a good start ...

What's Linux Dual Boot? Linux can be booted from floppy (ugly) or from
the HD with any (?) boot loader. I highly recommend Linux own one, lilo
(LInux LOader), that can boot Linux, but also OS/2, DOS or whatever you
want with ease. How are you installing Linux? Every installation kit I
know has his own copy of lilo, and makes a bootable floppy right from
the begining.
