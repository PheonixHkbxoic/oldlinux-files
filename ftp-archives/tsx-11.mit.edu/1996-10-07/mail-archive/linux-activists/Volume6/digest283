Greetings,

I would also like to do what is needed to setup LILO to boot DOS by default,
since my system is also used by DOS *puke* users who would prefer booting
straight DOS without having to specify the OS explicitly on bootup. So if there
is a possibility to do this, please post it here!

No, you can use LILO to rewrite the boot sector on your hard drive
with a program that is run at boot time and lets you choose which
partition to boot off of.  LILO and it's docs are included with SLS.

I've tried to install slackware but failed, here's detail.

I've used fdisk in Linux to define Linux Native, Swap partition, then
tried 'setup'.
After a lot of questions, it seems that it starts copying files, but I
always see 'Not enough spaces', 'Directory not exist' something like
that.
I don't know whether the problem comes from formatting harddisk in the
setup process, as it seems that an error messages appear in the process.

Can anyone tell me what I should do?

thanks in advance.

This is deliberate:  It is a dos-ism to include the current directory
in the path searched for executable files.  There was a recent thread
about this (misplaced) in some col group -- The issue is probably
addressed in the FAQs of comp.unix.questions and/or comp.unix.shells

>2) Secondly, even when you type ./hello, you get:

This can be compiled by
gcc -fwritable-strings -o foo foo.c

I didn't try to read the obfuscated code, but this appears to indicate
that the program tried to write to the string "Hello, world!" which
can apparently be forbidden. (By the ANSI standard?  Or is
-fwritable-strings needed to make GCC ansi-compliant?  I don't know.)

Please note that the question was originally asked about Linux, and I
just tested the above on a sunOS with 2.4.5 GCC.  I doubt that I've
made a fool of myself in any signifigant manner, however.  gcc without
the -fwritable-strings on the sun failed just like it's supposed to
under Linux.

On the MIPS did you use GCC?  The same version of GCC?  Or did you use
the vendor's cc?

Followups to comp.lang.c -- This isn't really too appropriate to a
comp.os.linux group.

By the way, about two weeks ago, there was an announcement for a
QIC-40/80 device driver that would let DOS back up the 386BSD partition
using an image backup format.  I have just used it to back my drive up,
and I am please to say that version 1.1 (which is the most recent
version) works at least as well as advertised.

While this does not get a native *BSD driver for the tapes written, it
does allow us to at leat back up the hard drive while we get it going.

The program is available from ftp.uni-duisberg.de (I think).  I have put
version 1.1 up for anonymous FTP here in the pub directory.  It is
called rawdsk11.zip and is a DOS zip file.

Why?  Wait a few and you will be able to run Unix with Linux, MS-"DOS" under
dosemu (or a separate partition), & MS-"Windows" under WINE (or under the

First off...you have to format your swap partition before you run "setup".
Use "mkswap" or something of that nature. It tells you on the screen what
you use.  Then run "setup"... and remember you have to have about 90 megs 
of space for the complete install.

You can use LILO to boot different partitions of your hard drive that have 
different OS's on them. OS/2 Boot manager also works well. (Its the only part
of OS/2 that I kept. )

From what I encountered with my Logitech mouse on a Microsoft Inport, the
Linux kernel expects the bus mouse to be configured for IRQ 5 by default. 
You seem to have two choices.  Switch your mouse IRQ to 5, or as in my
situation, modify the file busmouse.h in the /linux/kernel/char_drv
directory to reflect your current IRQ and recompile the kernel.  It worked
for me.  Good Luck!

  I contributed sources that will be included with Xfree86 2.0

my latest version of the server (and sources) via anonymous ftp.

  Compressed binaries of the oak driver for linux on the machine 
ns.encore.com and the files are in the directory /pub/development/languages/C 
and should be obvious. The sources and a readme history are there also.

   Four people, that I know of, have gotten copies of it. One user is reporting
problems which I haven't looked into yet. The others haven't reported problems
other than one report of not being able to get a properly sized/positioned
color 800x600 screen. I've been using it pretty extensively and haven't
had any problems. I'm interested in other users reports. 

  One of the problems that the first user reported is that the server doesn't
get the clocks correctly. I've noticed that startup can be touchy and if
there is some other activity on the machine that the clocks come out wrong.
I've avoided this by adding a clocks line to my Xconfig. The clocks you can

Date: Sun, 3 Oct 1993 23:03:56 GMT


You'll know your mke2fs is old if it complains:
>"Unable to find a block for ...".
or you might have the older "Cannot allocate i-node..." problem.

In 28kbtk$b4s@samba.oit.unc.edu (in c.o.l.announce), Remy Card announced:
> The new release of the second extended file system support programs
>[...] should soon be moved to [sunsite.unc.edu:]
/pub/Linux/system/Filesystems/ext2.

To help out folks installing Linux for the first time, I grabbed
e2fsprogs-0.3c.tar.gz from sunsite, compiled it (with gcc-2.4.5
and libc-4.4.1), and made a little floppy using the new binaries.
Then I copied the new binaries, man-pages, and the README onto it.

You may want to use this mke2fs and e2fsck instead of the older ones
which are probably in the SLS or MCC you grabbed a week or more ago.

I'm packing the files two ways.  There's a gzipped tar
and a gzipped 360KB image of the little floppy.
If you don't have room to "untar" the tar.gz,
you can gunzip the little floppy onto a floppy (any size :-),
mount -t ext2 it in your second floppy drive,
and execute mke2fs directly from there.  This may be easier and
safer than trying to make room on your ramdisk or boot/root floppy.
After fdisk, you might make a 100 MB filesystem on partition 2 this way:
  mkdir /zlor
  mount -t ext2 /dev/fd1h360 /zlor
  /zlor/mke2fs -tv /dev/hda2 100000
  umount /zlor

The files are 
  e2bin3c.tgz (the gzipped tarfile) and
  e2bin3c.egz (the gzipped file system image)
in /pub/Linux/Incoming on sunsite and will move to
system/Filesystems/ext2 soon.
These files replace e2bbin.tgz and e2bbinfs.gz.

        ...and so on. 

 

Where am I going wrong? I am able to partition the 3rd drive for DOS 

using Adaptec's software. All of the SCSI ID's are set correctly.

Everything appears to be correct with the exception that to Linux the
