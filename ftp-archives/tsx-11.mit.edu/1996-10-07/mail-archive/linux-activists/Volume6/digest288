I've seen a number of messages in this newsgroup saying that it
should be phased out, and instead more specific newsgroups like
comp.os.linux.* should be used.

Has those more specific newsgroups been created net-wide?
If they have, I suggest the newgrp messages got lost somewhere. None
of the local sites I have access to have newgrp creation messages
for linux newsgroups, other than comp.os.linux and comp.os.linux.announce.

You should contact your news administrator.  The new groups are
listed in the checkgroups message, and in the list of newsgroups
posted by David Lawrence.

(The problem might, of course, be upstream from you; in that case
you need to contact your upstream site.  Iterate as needed.)

There seems to be something else that is wrong on your site, as well.

Subject: X hangs on exit. please help
Date: 5 Oct 93 16:22:04 GMT


I recently bought a pc GATEWAY2000 (486dx, 16mbRAM, 400MB IDE hard disk
crystal scan 1572 monitor). I installed Linux on my system. Everything
seems to be working fine. But I have a problem when exiting X. The faq
says to exit X kill the last process started in .xinitrc which is olwm
in my case. But when i kill my window manager, I am not getting back to
the shell prompt. Instead my whole screen freezes with vertical stripes
on it. I doesn't know what is happening.I have to reboot the system when
ever this happens, which is a big pain. I even tried alt-ctrl-backspc.
(I did this thinking that the X server was not killed) Even that is not
working. Can somebody tell me what is happening and how to overcome 
this ?

thank u very much,

Hi folks!
 
Does anybody know about a shell that is comparable to the
"Norton Commander" running under MS-DOS?
 
I mean a shell that makes copying, moving and purging files

If you know such one, could you post it to

Do you mean Word Processor or Text Editor? For text editor, I think
Emacs is the most powerful text editor ever made. However, if you
prefer user-friendliness to powerfulness, there is a WordStar look alike
text editor called joe. For word processor, there is 'doc' from the
InterView package. Not as good as WinWord, but it works. There is also
'ez' from the Andrew's package. However, I think LaTeX is nice too for
preparing papers or reports.

Savio Lam.

Use DESQview/X to run WordPerfect 6.0 in a DOS session.  If you can
tolerate low speed, start MS Windows 3.1 Standard Mode in DESQview/X,
then run Lotus Ami Pro 3.01 can be even more powerful...  :-O~

The printer I use is HP Deskjet 500C.

Which version of the CD?
There are 2 usual causes;
1)  You do not have your CD on the correct hardware settings.               
    you need base address 300 and IRQ 5 by default.                         
2)  Newer drives have nasty firmware that breaks the driver.                
    If you only have boot floppy rev B, you need rev C.

The ISO9660 filesystem is compiled into the yggdrasil kernel when you get
it.. otherwise you could never load the thing could you?

You you were running gcc version 1 (the default that comes with
386bsd 0.1) then that explains it.  gcc2 has a significantly better
optimizer that could easily explain this kind of speed difference.

Subject: problems with mounting dos partitions
Date: 5 Oct 93 21:51:03 GMT

Hello Linuxers,

I have 2 problems with mounting msdos partitions under linux.

1) I have my msdos harddisk partition automatically mounted at
   boot time as /c with the following fstab entry:

   /dev/sda2       /c              msdos   defaults

   things are almost fine, except that all files and directories
   on /c belong to user root, group root and have permissions
   rwxr-xr-x, which means I cannot create or modify any files
   on the dos partition as a regular user. I tried to give 'loose'
   permissions to the mount point (/c) to the device (/dev/sda2),
   I explicitely specified 'w' as mounting option, all to no avail.

   Is there a way to automatically mount the partition at boot
   time with rw permissions on the files ? I imagine writing
   a C program with owner me and 'setuid' bit set, which is called
   by the boot script and mounts the disk would probably work, because
   when I mount manually, the permissions are all right. But I find
   this an ugly hack and wonder if there is another way to do it. 


2) I also want to have the disk drives in the fstab file, so I
   don't have to specify the whole "mount -t msdos /dev/fd...... /a"
   command to mount a file. The problem is that I don't want to
   mount the floppies when booting. I tried

   /dev/fd0H1440 /a         msdos   noauto,default
   /dev/fd1h1200 /b         msdos   noauto,default

   This properly prevents the floppies to be mounted at boot time,
   but unfortunately a simple 'mount /a' does not work either.
   What can I do except writing a 'setuid' program that does the
   work ?

Thanks for any hints

Gerry

Pointless. A set up demo can make it look as good or BETTER than any
Unix workstation.

It runs the same software as other Unix workstations, and based on the
performance I get and benchmark results of other systems, it out
performs most (if not all) other PC Unixes.

Many many sites have all the new groups. Some are set up so
that newgrp messages get forwarded to a person, who may or may
not have time to create the groups.

Anyway, judging by your From: header line (above), I would
say your particular news installation needs a bit of work :-)

Seriously though, ask your news administrator to fix your From:
header and create the new groups. He can check the official group
listings from news.* if he doesn't believe you (or you can make
it easy on him and grep out the relevant info for him -- it should
even still be in the "currently active votes" periodic posting.

geez, considering that 386bsd beat linux by a large percentage
