Yep I've seen this too. It seems to be once too many sockets build up. I guess
it passed the 4K internal limit on a /proc file. But it _should_ trap it.

When term spawns a program and that program exits term gets a signal saying
it has exited. This interrupts the connect and then term breaks. Putting
a signal(SIGCHLD,SIG_IGN) before the connect sort of seems to work with 0.99.12
I can't get the 0.99.13ALPHA up for over 3 minutes so I can't test with that
(It is an alpha so ...)
>also - if I put a loop around the connect, so that if it fails, it tries again,
>it just loops indefinately, trying.
Once a connect is interrupted the socket seems to end up broken. I've been 
chasing this with little success.

I have INGRES, and the tinkering I've done, it works.  Does POSTGRES do SQL?
I know the publiuc version of Ingres doesn't.

My (failed) approach to using Windows swap space was just to swap
directly into the Windows swap file. Of course, this doesn't work
right now as the MSDOS fs doesn't support bmap. However, I think
that this will change real soon.

Thanks to all for their email on this.  I did tinker with LILO but
didn't get it to work (I followed the instructions in the Installation
manual).  I might have missed something.  Anyway I got it to work
yesterday (don't know how).  All I did was read /etc/lilo/README and
went to the steps one by one.  I even run the command using my newly
modified config file (see below): /etc/lilo/install -v -v -v -t

Right after that I could reboot from the harddisk.  I don't remember
if I ran /etc/lilo/install after but I know that I did ran it several
times before.  It could that I didn't set up my config file properly
e.g. using /dev/hda1 for boot instead of /dev/hda.  Anyway it works
real well now.

Add emulate3buttons to Xconfig. It mkaes sense to add it just after the line
telling XFree which sort of mouse you have.

Hi,

I am trying to select a PC to use mainly with Linux on it and was looking
into the Magazines. It seemd most of the systems carry Diamond graphics
card these days. I know it is not supported in Linux but some people seem
to be using it after some fiddling with the timing.

I'd like to know from the people using Diamond graphics card, which card
you are using and in which mode (ex, 1024x800, color, mono...). I would like
to have my system with 8bit color and 1024x800.

I'd also like to know what kind of tape drive people are using for backup
on Linux (including the controller). If I am to have few hundred Megabytes of
Disk space, I believe backup is an important aspect I should consider.

Any information would be helpful. Please send your reply to

Thank you.

Date: 16 Sep 93 11:08:35
Reply-To: jasko@cns.bu.edu


Numerous people have read posts on comp.os.linux from individuals
who have purchased the 383 Meg hard drives from me.
Since the original post is no longer there, I have received lots of
inquiries regarding these drives, what the price was, and whether or
not I could get any more.  I found out today that I can get more.  The
following is the original post.

*ORIGINAL POST FOLLOWS:**************************************

 I have a few brand new 383 Meg Seagate SCSI hard drives.  These
 drives went for $450.00 regularly.  I will give these 383 Meg drives
 away to anyone who wants one for $269.00 each.  Call me after 5:30 PM
 Eastern time if you want one.  I will give them out on a first come
 first serve basis and they will go fast.

 These are Seagate ST-2383N SCSI Hard Drives.  They were manufactured
 by SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY and are internal 5 1/4" Half Height Drives.  They
 are vastly superior to most of the non-SCSI hard drives out there.
 They will work with *ANY* SCSI controller.  They are brand new, still
 in the box, and come with docs.  They are
 100% guaranteed for 30 days.  If you get one and you don't like the
 way it matches your wallpaper simply return it for your money back
 *NO QUESTIONS ASKED*!

 These drives also work perfectly with Linux, BSD, and other Unices for the PC.
 They work fine with Macs.  The dimensions of the drive are as
 follows: 5 1/4" x 1 1/2" x 8 1/2" (Standard 5 1/4" half height
 internal PC drive dimensions).  If you are going to use it with a MAC
 then either make sure you have sufficient room in terms of drive bays
 or get an external enclosure.

 I can take Visa or MasterCard for these.  You can call any time after
 5:30 PM (and up until 2:00 AM) to order one.  My home phone number
 is (617) 246-3634.  If you think it is too late and they are already
 gone call anyway because your call will put you in line for one if I
 can get any more.  If nobody is home you can leave a message on our
 machine and I will call you within hours of your leaving a message.

 The cost is as follows:

 383 Meg Seagate Hard Drive               $269.00
 S&H                                      $ 10.00
 -----------------------------------------------------
 TOTAL                                    $279.00

 (This is the amount that would be charged to your credit card.)

 If you are going to pay with a check or money order:

 In order to acquire a Seagate make your payment or money order for $279.00
 payable to:

 Dr. John V. Jaskolski

 send it to:

I have a Future Domain TMC-1680 SCSI controller and Linux doesn't seem
to recognize it at all.  I thought I  read it was in the list of
'supported' hardware?

Anyone else using this card?  The a1 disk tells me I have 0 SCSI hosts
and 0 hard drives, tape drives and CD-ROM drives although I have one of
each attached.  

DOS and OS/2 work with all of these devices and the controller just 
fine.

No, Postgres uses a flavor of the QUEL language (used in INGRES?)
But I thought it was SQL-like. Isn't it?

Date: 16 Sep 93 10:27:48 CDT

I use a very simple scheme for sharing the swap partition between
MS-DOS/Windows and Linux. In Linux I do the mkswap and swapon during
boot. This accomplishes making the partition usable as a LINUX swap
space. 

After booting DOS, I format the swap partition. THE FIRST TIME ONLY, I
create a permanent swap file for WINDOWS to fill the partition
completely.

Later on, when I boot DOS, I JUST REFORMAT that partition to make it
usable by DOS. When I successively start WINDOWS, I get a complaint
that the permanent swap file is gone. Windows then offers to recreate
the swap file automatically. Just type 'Y' and you are in business.

Date: Thu, 16 Sep 1993 17:31:49 GMT


With all of the furor over SLS and all recently, I have a question as
to the differences between all of these new "distributions" going
around.

You see, when I first found out about Linux, I first just got copies
of the kernel and all of the utilities and all. I also got the little
readme file that detailed how I was supposed to run fdisk and then
mkfs and all that crap. It never did work for me.

That's why I was pleased when I found SLS, because it installed itself
for me and I was up and running. <shwing!>.

Now that there all of these competing distributions out there now, I
was curious what the difference between all of them are. The last time
I checked the faq, it just mentioned that SLS was a little easier to
install than the others of that time. 

Specifically, what are the perks offered by each of the
distributions?

Thanks.

Perhaps we could have a look at the FDISK from IBM OS/2 2.x, which claims to
be able to handle >1024cyl in some way.  That's probably as close to a 
"standard" as the PC world is likely to get, or at least as good a model
as anything else might be.  

I may give it a try on my own system to see what it thinks of my partitions..
