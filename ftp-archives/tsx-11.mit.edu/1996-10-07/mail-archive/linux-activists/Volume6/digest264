I am trying to install the sls disk set.  I boot with the a1 disk and it seems
to start ok.  But when it starts to talk to my Adaptec 1542c it is telling me
that an interupt was received but no mail.

The card works perfectly under dos and I have booted from this disk before I got
the adaptec and it worked fine.

Any ideas?  What does the no mail message mean?

Thanks,
David

Buy a different SCSI board, or if your particular DTC supports it,
use it in WD1003 emulation mode.

I've checked with archie and every listing that I see for doc
looks like its part of the Linux distribution (binary images).

doc looks like a great package and would be very useful to my users -
where can I get source that I can build on my Irix and AIX boxes ?

Thanks in advance,

I'm interested in this unit also, especially if the on board SCSI and
E-net has a full 32 bit address bus to memory.

Does anyone know how to get technical documentation from IBM/AMBRA so
that SCSI and network drivers can be written?

I'll try to track something down on Monday from IBM, but a contact
would be great.  I remember a Kafka like experience trying to get
technical information out of AT&T (aka "We're the Phone Company")  once
in my past.

I can relate, I just started to use Xmosaic, and I find it awesome to say 
the least. Especially for showing the power of the internet. I am using a 
9600 baud line, and being able to do other things is a BIG plus. I changed 
my mpeg_play so that it looped, other wise ofcourse, I be doing something in 
a character vt and miss the fun. I think I'll do something similar to the 
showaudio stuff. It's a blast listening to people talking on my little pc-
speaker :-). I suprised most people I talk to don't even know it exists. 
Next thing is collage, I tried to start some compiling of that, but it isn'
t going as straight forward as the mime package, or the pbmplus utils. I 
wonder, is anyone else trying to get it compiled, or maybe already do?

Well, the SLS 1.03 release (and ***ANY*** kernel that has ethernet
support compiled in) doesn't grok the UltraStor 34F.  The problem is
that the Autoprobe code in Linux doesn't keep track of ranges of ports
that are already in use, so that many devices tend to probe different
the same ranges of ports, even if the range of ports is already in
use.  This autoprobing tends to screw up the UltraStor for some
reason, so you must jumper it at a different address, say 0x340.  I've
seen two failure modes for this:  1) no scsi cards recognized or 2)
ll_rw_blk complaining about something not working.

Every time I boot a new kernel from the net, I have to rejumper the
board to 0x340.

Bull.  Please read the GPL.  All it talks about is making sure that
sources are available at a reasonable fee.  Nothing in it says that
you can't make a profit on the software.  The people that you give it
to still must retain the rights that you had with the software, and
you must tell them so.

Please quote the portion of the GPL that states that I cannot charge
$1,000 per copy that I distribute of program FOO that is covered under
the GPL.  Of course, people that pay the $1000 are bound by the GPL
and nothing stricter, so they can turn around and charge $0.25 or
nothing to distribute it.  I'm not prevented from continuing to
charge $1000, but few people would chose to get it from me at this
price, unless there was some compelling reason for it (say I would
wear a pager and let them call me 24 hours a day to help them with
problems they were having).

However, nothing in the GPL prevent me from charging money, so long as
I comply with all the terms and conditions of the GPL, which basically
says two things: 1) Those people I give the program to can give it to
other people.  2) I must provide, or offer to provide, the source
subject to the same terms and conditions.

I think that your understanding is incorrect.  What is going on here
is a service.  You are paying $20 to use the disks for whatever
purposes you see fit to use. Your rights to make additional copies is
not compromised, so this is perfectly OK under the GPL.

Please do recall that there is nothing in the GPL that says you can't
make money off the software.  All it says that if you distribute
something, you must make  the source available on request (subject to
certain terms and conditions, please see the GPL for all the details).

Ok, here's the deal.

I have a tvga8900cl card with 1mb.  I installed SLS 1.03 and the whole
thing went off without a hitch.  I modified the Xconfig files and set it
up to the best of my ability.  I inserted a line for my chipset and
modified the other parts according to the FAQ.  Xwindows runs fine but
when I start it up, my monitor flickers, makes a awfully loud *click*
and the screen goes dead.  Not just blank, but dead.  The power is still
on though. After about 1/2 a second it flickers again, and then X starts
to come up.  It also seems that the monitor is growing abnormally hot
after what seems to be a short period of time.

I don't want to damage my monitor so if someone could offer me some
advice, I would be most greatful.

Subject: QIC-40/80 Streamer support in Net/386BSD
Status: RO

Dear Dr Veit,

        I've seen your suggestion regarding the creation of support
for the Mitsumi CD Rom Drive, and certainly it's a wise move, I could
never understand why very popular and cheap hardware was kind of
"snubbed at" my most of the recent OS (including Unixware, NT etc.).
        There's though an area that needs even more attention (in my
opinion at least), namely  the support for the most popular (and cheap)
streamers.  I'm sure very few can afford QIC-02 or SCSI-based tape strea-
mers, however, almost everybody I know has a Colorado or Irwin model
(that can be had for less than a _third_ of the price of a QIC-02 or
a SCSI model) (thanks to Microsoft, due to the inherent instability of 
Windows it made everybody buy a streamer ;-) ).
        On the other hand I gather it's not that practical for the pro-
grammers that do most of the work on Net/386BSD to sit and write drivers
from scratch, it'll be much easier to put some pressure on the respective
ventors to create themselves the drivers.  The reason is that each brand
has a few variations, e.g. Colorado comes as 125Mb model with or without
the FC10 or FC20 controller, or as 250Mb model ditto, thus it'll be 
rather a lot to ask the Net/386BSD programmers to cater for all variations.
The ventors on the other hand can do it rather easily.  What's needed is
that as many as possible of the prominent people involved in Net/386BSD 
such as yourself, Messrs Chris Demetriou, Nate Williams, Terry Lambert 
et al. would write or email Colorado and Irwin and pressure them to create 
the drivers (just drivers will do fine, no need for more sophisticated 
software like Colorado's "jtape" for SCO/ISC ). 
        I'm sure they'll _have_ to pay heed to what people of your stand-
ing say to them.  I've taken the liberty to include here the mail and 
Compuserve address of Colorado, just in case you feel like supporting 
this idea. These are:
        Colorado Memory Systems,
        800 South Taft Avenue
        Loveland CO 80537 - 9929 , USA
Compuserve users can leave messages for Colorado Memory Systems Inc. in
IBMHW Forum/Session 4 at the following address : 
        (CO_MEM_SYS) SUPPORT 71621,3022
Thus, for Interneters, just email 71621.3022@compuserve.com (if I'm not
wrong).
        Unfortunately my local host does not cary netnews, so I've no way
to put a relevant message in comp.os.386bsd.*, however, if you feel like
posting any part or all of this message in these areas just to see how many

site I get:

/usr/bin/uuname command not found

or something similar... its like it is trying to use uucp or
something?

Subject: Need Help on Term
Date: Sun, 26 Sep 1993 16:47:21 GMT


Hi, 
   I am trying to use term for multiple communication channels through my
modem. However I am not able to get it running, this is what I do :

 I login to the remote system using kermit and run term.
 Next I escape back to the local kermit and enter :
         kermit> !term >/dev/modem </dev/modem &
         kermit> quit
         linux$ trsh
  After this the system just hangs, it does not do anything at all until I
press CTRL-C which returns me back to the linux prompt. I am using SLS 1.03
and a 2400 baud modem. I would be grateful if someone could enlighten me
as to what I am doing wrong,

Thanks in advance,
RAJ

Hi

   I am overwhelmed by the response of all those netters who have
contributed one way or another in helping me to solve the above
problem.  Thanks again guys!  
   Well I would like to share with the rest of you how the above
problems are solved.  The first if the PEX error... it turns out
that the SLS package does not include the PEX package.  I have to
download it from the the ftp site and extract it into the proper
directory.  The second problem is caused by my ignorant.  I have
to create a swap partition (8M) and this solve the problem of
Fontpath not valid.
    I am now happily exploring the openwin.  One thing bothers me
though ... is it possible to configure the X-window to 'shrink'
to just occupy the whole screen but not more? Hate to keep
panning up and down when playing xmahjohn.

Subject: anyone have Linux working on a DEC PC?
Date: 26 Sep 1993 20:59:48 GMT

The subject says it all.  I am considering purchasing a DecPC
466d2MTE w/ 486dx2 66 CPU, 16 Meg of RAM, 256K cache, 525 Meg
IDE HD, VL Bus High Res. Video Card - Weitek P9000 (??!!) w/ 2MB, 
and a 17" monitor for work, and I would like to know if anyone has
Linux working on this or a similar model DEC pc.  It is conspicuosly 
absent from the Linux hardware compatibility list and the new 
video lists seem unavailable.  I know that some dec pc's are available 
with SCO Unix...but maybe I like Linux better :)

Also, any general commments about such a machine are appreciated.
Its function will be as a workstation...probably always have some
compute heavy job in background, while I use the graphics interface
to read the net news :-)     thanks for any info, bill e.g.
