Just today in comp.os.linux.announce I saw an announce of
some new Linux distribution on CD (I forgot the name) that 
includes Linux itself and a lot of different stuff,
including Magic, Spice and Chipmunk - for only $90. I think, 
you can try. 

And, if you want to compile some system by yourself (I do)
why not to start with OCTTOOLS?

(We should note that given true PC-relative addressing, `link fix-ups'
or indirections through tables occur only for cross-`chunk' references,
such as calls from the application to a shared library.  But many
CPUs make PC-relative addressing difficult.)

This makes the Utah approach (as described at the last USENIX) all the
more interesting.  In this case, `executing' a binary invokes the
linker, which can choose either to run a cached `pre-linked' version or
to construct a new one.  As Terry notes, most applications are run much
more often than they need re-linking (the shared libraries do not
change often).  Hence, the same cached `post-fixup' version can be
reused (saving time) and shared (saving space).  In effect, this is
the happy medium between `pure static' and `pure dynamic': resolved
on demand, then static until something forces a change.

Note that if this is done `right', the cached post-fixup binaries do
not need to contain the shared libraries.  Rather, the dynamic linker
chooses an address for each shared library for each binary, and
attempts to keep this address constant per library.  If/when this
attempt fails, this falls back to the equivalent of `pure dynamic'
linking; when it succeeds, it works much like `pure static' linking.
The only thing that the choice of per-library address `constants'
affects is the ratio of successful `static-like' links to failed
`dynamic-like' links.

Assigning addresses to libraries would be the task of a program similar
to SunOS's `ldconfig'.  A library that lacks a preselected address
would simply have one chosen dynamically.  This would take more space,
to cache `preloaded' binaries and (at their preselected addresses)
libraries, but only those that are in fact used and/or only those that
meet some policy.  Again, the fallback is, in essence, `pure dynamic'
linking; all else is merely optimization.

Subject: Final:  Keeping fs clean
From: levinson@vax.sonoma.edu
Date: 11 Sep 93 19:11:22 -0800

I am primarily posting this to let users whom are still having the clean/dirty
problem what I found the solutions to be.

My problem was originally that VFS mounted root always saying that it was
unchecked.  If you get .99pl10 or higher, you will need to get e2fsck 0.3.  If
you have less then .99pl10, you wil not be able to mount root readonly.  Get 
bootutils and follow these steps:

1) Use RDEV and make your kernel flag read only.  This is done by rdev -R
/dev/xxx 1
2) edit your /etc/rc file so that the first thing it does is e2fsck -av.  If
you have more than one ext2 drive, run it once for each drive.  If e2fsck
encounters an error, it will not be able to fix it cause you mounted read
only.  Next make your rc file remount root as read/write using the -remount
flag.
3) Make sure umount -a works.  It should not say that a device is busy.  This
will happen if the umount is earlier and does not remount read only
4) Create /bin/brc and place in it:

#!/bin/sh
echo "Unmounting file systems"
umount -a

chmod 700 /etc/brc

Make sure you use SHUTDOWN only!! reboot and halt do not cleanly exit your
system.

I wanted to once again thanks all who wrote back to me with your suggestions. 
It is that kind of help which allows us DOS users to trash it for a better
operating system.

You should of corse use rdev on either zImage or /dev/fd* (You are really

Eh, e2fsck _will_ be able to correct the error because you mounted the
partition
read-only. The device is not read-only. After the errors are corrected you will
have to reboot to force the kernel to reread the partition.

If no errors are found, it is safe to remount the partition read/write.

>Make sure you use SHUTDOWN only!! reboot and halt do not cleanly exit your

You can safely use both halt and reboot, which are the programs starting
/etc/brc. shutdown are in fact starting halt or reboot.

(I hope I didn't introduce more mistakes... :)

This is a problem that I also had with the SLS 1.03 distribution.  Try this:

/dev/sda1       /       ext2    defaults
/proc           /proc   proc    defaults

Also, add a line for the swap partition if you have one.  For example (from

/dev/sda2       none    swap    defaults

Date: Fri, 10 Sep 1993 03:31:06 GMT

I've got a QIC-02 (Wangtek 60 meg) tape drive/controller and have been
unable to get Linux 0.99 pl12 to work with it...  Everything works fine
until I try to read from or write to a tape (i.e. boot shows all to be
ok).  When I write to the tape, I get several messages from the driver
some of which are;
tpqic02: isr: exception on tape controller
        status 4d
tpqic02: DMA transfer exception
tpqic02: write: dma: error in writing

ending in;
tpqic02: release: device dead!?

After this happens, if I try to read from the tape device, I get a
message that the tape is dead, saying that I need to do an 'mt reset'.
Any access to the tape device (read or write) now ends in the same error
until I reboot.

The tape is setup as IRQ 5, DMA 1, ADDR 0x338 and this is reported in the
boot message and the tape is successfully reset.  The tape device is on
Major 12, Minor 0 device (I tried Minor 1 and had the same results).

I don't know what particular model of Wangtek controller I have (I can't
find any numbers on the card, just 'Wangtek').  The drive is also Wangtek
and has a model #5099EN24.

This controller/drive works fine using the default Wangtek drivers that
come with Interactive 2.0.2 (System V.3.2).

Any ideas???

Thanks,
Tom

Last I heard, the people working on the project were able to run
Windoze "Solitaire", which as anyone who has spent any time with
'doze will tell you, is the only reason to have the thing at all.

If anyone on the team for this (WINE, it's called, right?) is reading,
do you need the whole Windoze package to run Solitaire, or just the
Solitaire files? (I'd love to install 'doze, remove the cruft -- i.e.,
Windoze -- and be able to play the Solitaire!)

Brian, if you're trying to go back to dos, try the following:
1.) Boot up from a DOS system diskette.
2.) Do a 'format c: /MBR' to put a new master boot record in the boot sector.

Subject: Thrashing - how to quantify
Date: 12 Sep 1993 13:54:13 GMT

When I run gcc on my machine with 5 megs of real memory installed, it
seems to run very slowly and swap frequently ... So it's probably thrashing ...
What I need is a way to quantify exactly how much time is spent swapping
in/out and how much is spent running the program. This way I can start
to tune the system. The obvious choice is ps, but this doesn't seem to give
the info I need, and really I'm stuck. Does anyone have any ideas?

Secondly, how much real memory am I going to need? This stuff is expensive,
and I think my only option is to go for the full 16+4 megs (I've only got
8 slots, with 4+1 config at the moment). This will cost more than I can bear
at the moment. Is there another solution.

Thanks in advance, ... Rich.
