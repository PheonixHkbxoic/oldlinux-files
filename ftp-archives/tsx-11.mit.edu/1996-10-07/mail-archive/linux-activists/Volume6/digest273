Subject: Term Binaries needed
Date: Wed, 29 Sep 1993 07:18:12 GMT

I need to get binaries for term for a sun 4 target machine. I
have term 1.07 running on Linux and on my campus NeXT and I'm pleased as
punch about the remote Xwindows capability but the real reason I started 
tweaking with term to begin with was to use it on our sun server. As
best I can tell it is a sun 4, as the compiler flags seem to indicate when
I attempt to make term and related files on the Sun. (never laid eyes
on the real machine). BUT for some reason the makefile pukes all over me
on the sun, it seems that it has a pre-ansi version of 'cc' - (is that likely??)
at least it seems unable to make heads or tails of ANSI-style prototypes.
Am I possibly overlooking a flag there? Anyway, I need one of two things:
 
term binaries built for Sun 4, or, 
a kick in the head with the correct CCFLAGS to make the binaries.

Any help earns my eternal gratitude....

Well, I decided to write a "Intelligent Board Driver" For Linux 4 days ago,
today As of today the board configuration and initilization works , as well
as input and output. No DCD/DTR ioctl calls are supported yet, but they will 
be. I'm expecting to release source to the drivers as "alpha" withen 2 weeks.
These are initially going to support "Digboard PC/8i, PC/16i, PC/8e,PC/16e,
PC/8m, PC/16m" but soon after "Star Gate ACL" will be supported, as well
as Digiboard COM/xx products. Others are on the list. 

 I was online on IRC for 2 hours with the Driver, and it seemed to hold up
 to the "non-demanding" but "constant" character stream rather well. It's
 coming along nicely, and the package I'm writing is designed to allow
 easy addition of different types of serial boards, and have it all be 
 dynamically allocated (from the minor numbers) at run time.

I am using Linux SLACKware
version .9PL13Alfa  Was fighting with SLS and tried the Slackware version. SLS
has better install but I like the Slackware version MUCH better when it comes 
to use.

  I have my linux box on the network and now telnet to my HP300 mini computer
to do my work.  I also goto my VAX as a VT100.  Unfortionatly the 3000 wants
hp terminal emulation.  what I want to do is make it look to the 3000 as if I
am on a hp terminal.  I want it to look right on my end to.   Right now
if I use the VT100 it hanges if I use any HP only stuff.  Can I set the

Then in another session use vt100???

I presume you did install Slackware 1.0.3.

There exist two files in /conf/net.  One of them defines the hostname.

In /etc there are several more files containing the hostname darkstar.
Do a grep -l darkstar /etc/* and you get a list of files containing it.
Just edit these files and fill in your desired hostname.

I did it and i'm happily using my machine `hurricane' for about
a week now.

Good luck, althouh i suggest people SEARCH first before posting this kind of

There are a couple of gotchas:
1) Make sure the termrc on one and only one end has the word remote in it.
2) Run linecheck and put the recommendations on both ends (most people say
just the other end, but it does not hurt to be conservative here).  If
linecheck does not tell you to escape CR/LF then look at your inittab,
gettytab or wherever you set up logins on Linux.  Follow the examples in the
includede termrc.

The real C standard is still K&R, 1st edition.  Lots of UNIX boxes,
including Suns running SunOS 4.1.3 , do not have ANSI support.  Many sites
have installed GCC to get ANSI support.  You might set CC=gcc in the
top-level Makefile.

If you are running Linux then RUN don't walk to sunsite.unc.edu and look at
all the wonderful linux goodies.  Follow your nose down to
Linux/apps/comm/term and you will find Sun4 binaries.

All X software with the features and complexity of WordPerfect for X Windows
will take that long to load.  Did you know that the current version of
Corel for X Windows takes a full 22 seconds to load????  Did you know that
that puts it more than DOUBLE the time of WP?????

And your complaint is only on the X version.  This does not hold water at
all on the text version......

Then you have the very first release of the software.  Those type of things
have been fixed in the 4/93 release which they will gladly give you for free
(although some of those things still remain).  This is WordPerfects **FIRST**
piece of X Windows software.  It is going to take some time to get it right.

We have over 40 printers in use with over 6 models.  We have never had ANY
printing problems.  (Use "Other Spooler", works just fine here for 1 year).

You are doing something wrong.

There are SCORES of advantages to using WordPerfect besides that
The pricing is very reasonable compared to other packages.  They have many
versions for many platforms.  They include **BOTH** a text and X version
for Unix.  They support every printer on the planet.  It is a very
functional and robust wordprocessor.  They have very good technical support
(AND AT NO CHARGE). Etc....   My hat goes off to WordPerfect Corp. for being
a long-term supporter of Unix.  Their text version is EXTREMELY stable
and yes, they are having a few problems with their FIRST X piece of
software; of which 3/4 of the problems were corrected with the 4/93 release.

Date: 29 Sep 93 13:59:29 +0100

Hi, 

I'm haven't got a PC yet, but am thinking of doing so, in order to run Linux
and DOS and maybe NT too.

What I'd like to know, is are there any Linux drivers that support read/write
CDs? Can these CD rom drives read ordinary CDs (I think it sounds a silly
question, but you never know...). How does a read/write CD drive compare
in access time/transfer rate to a CD Rom drive?

[I'm thinking of using the CD drive to act as a backup store, rather than use
 a tape or Worm drive. Of course I'd also like to use the Cd drive to install
 Linux...]

Cheers for any answers.

Reply-To: jvj@yorkshire.com
Date: Wed, 29 Sep 1993 14:39:53 GMT



 I have a few *BRAND NEW* 209 Meg Seagate SCSI hard drives.  These
 drives went for $245.00 regularly.  I will give these 209 Meg drives
 away to anyone who wants one for $145.00 each.  Call me after 5:30 PM
 Eastern time if you want one.  I will give them out on a first come
 first serve basis and they will go fast.

 These are Seagate ST-2209N SCSI Hard Drives.  They were manufactured
 by SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY and are internal 5 1/4" Half Height Drives.  They
 are vastly superior to most of the non-SCSI hard drives out there.
 They will work with *ANY* SCSI controller.  They are brand new, still
 in the box, and come with  *EVERYTHING* including docs.  They are
 100% guaranteed for 30 days.  If you get one and you don't like the
 way it matches your wallpaper simply return it for your money back
 *NO QUESTIONS ASKED*!

 These drives also work perfectly with Linux, BSD, and other Unices for the PC.

 I can take Visa or MasterCard for these.  You can call any time after
 5:30 PM (and up until 2:00 AM) to order one.  My home phone number
 is (617) 246-3634.  If you think it is too late and they are already
 gone call anyway because your call will put you in line for one if I
 can get any more.  If nobody is home you can leave a message on our
 machine and I will call you within hours of your leaving a message.

 The cost is as follows:

 209 Meg Seagate Hard Drive               $145.00
 S&H                                      $ 10.00
 -----------------------------------------------------
 TOTAL                                    $155.00

 (This is the amount that would be charged to your credit card.)

 If you are going to pay with a check or money order:

 Where can I find the file  .Xresources, that is named in the head of the file
 xnitrc to be at usr/lib/X11/xinit/.Xresources, I have search this file in this
 directory, and with find from / with no succes, when I run startx with the
 output file I have this message at the end of the output file:
 "xinit:  No such file or directory (errno 2):  unexpected signal 13"
 and suspect this file to be .Xresources.

Hi Netters ...
==============

A friend of mine doesn't have Internet access and asked me to post this
message (It's propably a FAQ - but I do not have the FAQ posting.)

I have only expirience with SV.x.x UNIX so I could not answer his question.

He wants to install the following OS software and doesn't want to boot
from a floppy:

- MSDOG 6.0 without compression
- IBM OS/2 2.1 with HPFS filesystem
- LINUX 1.02

Can anybody tell me in witch order he must install the OS's and which
partitions he has to set active so he can boot any of the 3 OS from HDD ???

Please E-Mail to my Mail-Plus address, because I do not read this newsgroup.
I will post a summary to this newsgroup, if there is interest.

Thanx in advance ...
