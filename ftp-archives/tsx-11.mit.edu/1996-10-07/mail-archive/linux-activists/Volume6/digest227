I thought that the numbers presented in the paper were, shall we say,
optimistic, especially with regards to the relative frequency of cache
hits.  There is also the problem of converting the usage back to vanilla
(or not so vanilla) C from the C++ required in their implementation.

The idea of attempting to place the tables at a known location in all
binaries was the real interesting idea -- that way the post-fixup pages
can be shared.  The problem with assigned addresses remains, however...
you still eat an address range for the library per version of the
library.  I don't think the work at the UofU went through very many
generations of libraries, and so this problem didn't become evident.
The dynamic fallback simply resolves the packing problem.  Admittedly,
this will alleviate the space issues somewhat, but with the excessively
frequent revisions to libraries for systems undergoing active developement
(like NetBSD/FreeBSD), this either implies a release authority with more
frequent releases or a plethora of incompatable library images.

I think it is just as possible to get around the problems with fixed GOT
locations; note that global data referenced by the libraries, unless it
is const data, must be pushed into the process at initial symbol resoloution
time, even if the link is delayed (as it is in the Utah system).  This
means that data reference must be through the relocation table as well,
and thus pushing the table out of the image will not be successful if
there is external and internal symbol references taking place... this,
in a nutshell, was the main impediment to using Pete's modification of
Joerg's fixed address libraries to produce workable X (or termcap)
libraries.


I think the basic justification for the Utah code comes from the ability
to launch or relaunch an application rather quickly; this is not the
highest item on my list of needs, and paying the per application fixup
penalty up front at exec time for the first instance of an application
is acceptable, especially as a trade-off to incurring additional run-time
overhead.

I think a lot of the problem could be alleviated by copy-on-dirty and
force-copy-on-text-busy to get the swap backing store into the swap
area and off the file (getting rid of the antiquated "ETXTBUSY" we bought
off on when we ate the MACH VM system whole).  A subsequent LRU garbage
collection in swap would buy us the pre-relocation benefits of the Utah
system by allowing copy-on-write from a prerelocated image -- the "old"
swap image being used to get the relocated GOT and read-only and non-dirty
pages without recourse to the image.  This would imply  a need for a
unification of the vnode LRUing similar to the SVR4 implementation to
let us force-flush a swap image of a vnode when the vnode itself was flushed
(this assumes that swap might not be the limiting resource).

A secondary benefit is that the currently broken NFS model (how do we return
ETXTBUSY when the file is executing on a client instead of locally?) will
be 'magically' resolved.

A tertiary benefit to the swap-store changes is that we will be able to
get a real system dump without reserving a dump partition other than swap.


It isn't necessary to buy off on the whole ball of wax to get most of the
benefits.

Reply-To: jasko@cns.bu.edu


Numerous people have read posts on comp.os.linux from individuals
who have purchased the 525 Meg tape drives from me.
Since the original post is no longer there, I have received lots of
inquiries regarding these drives, what the price was, and whether or
not I could get any more.  I found out today that I can get more.  The
following is the original post.

*ORIGINAL POST FOLLOWS:**************************************

I have a few 525 Meg (compressed) Tandberg tape drives that I will give out on
a first come first serve basis. These drives go for $790.00 brand new. I will
give these drives away to anyone who wants one for $235.00.  Just
think, now you can backup your entire system affordably and you can 
sleep easily at night knowing that if you crash you *WON'T* burn.  

These are IBM versions of the Tandberg SCSI tape drives.  
They were manufactured by Tandberg for IBM.  As a result, they
have been manufactured to IBM specs which means that they are very
high quality.  The drives will hold 525 Meg *COMPRESSED*
on a DC6250 tape (250 Meg uncompressed).  They are internal 5 1/4"
half height drives.  They are vastly superior to and 3 times faster than
the Colorado Jumbo 250.  They will work with *ANY* SCSI controller.
The drivers (i.e., ASPI managers) come with your SCSI controller.

These Tandbergs will also come with FREE Tape ARchive (TAR) Backup
software with which to perform backups in DOS.  This Backup Software
can backup your entire system at 2:00 AM.  It is so easy to use and self
explanatory that docs are virtually unnecessary (which is good because
these *DO NOT* come with docs).  Each tape drive comes with complete
installation instructions (written by me) and each comes with usage
instructions.  The drives are not *BRAND NEW*.  They are slightly used
floor models.  They are 100% guaranteed for 30 days.
If you get one and you don't like the way it matches your wallpaper
simply return it for you money back *NO QUESTIONS ASKED*!

S&H is $10.00.

I can take Visa or MasterCard for these.  My home phone number is
(617) 246-3634.  You can call me *ANYTIME* up until 2:00 AM seven days
a week.  The best time to reach me is after 5:30 PM.

These drives work perfectly with OS/2, Windows NT, Linux, BSD,
and other Unices for the PC.

If you are going to pay by MasterCard or Visa call me *ANYTIME* at
my home: (617) 246-3634.  If nobody is home you can leave your name
and a number that you can be reached at (and what time you want me to
call back) and I will call you back ASAP.

If you are going to pay with a check or money order:

In order to acquire a Tandberg make your payment or money order for
$245.00 ($235.00 + $10.00 S&H) payable to:

Dr. John V. Jaskolski

send it to:

P.S.  E-mail me if you have any questions.  Also, if you are at all
interested let me know now or when you try later they will almost
surely be gone.

I've heard lots of laughing about the desire to run Windoze programs under
Linux, but hear me out for a second.

I'd love to dump MS-DOS and move to LINUX.  I'd get a brand new 340-meg hard
drive to go with my 250, get 8 additional megs of ram, and have a blast. 
However, there are three programs I have which make this goal impossible. 
There are some programs which just aren't available and are not practical to
develop personally.

1.  Finale Music Composition 3.0.  This program is the finest musical notation
program available for the IBM today.  Unfortunately, it runs under Windoze.  I
just can't get along without it.  I'd be glad to set aside another partition
for DOS and Windoze, but it would be lots cooler to get along without it.

2.  Cakewalk 3.0 for DOS.  This program is a MIDI sequencer.  It would be
possible to create a similar program for UNIX without too much trouble, but it
would take lots more time than I have.

3.  MS Word.  This is actually not necessary, because there are equivalents for
UNIX and there must be X-windows word processors of similar quality.  However,
what I've seen so far doesn't have quite the flexibility.  I guess I could get
along without this program, especially because nobody on this newsgroup is
going to cry if Microsoft's corporate headquarters blow up tomorrow
unexpectedly.

Okay, I admit that most of you would just give me the snide remark "If you need
the program get out the C compiler and create it yourself for X-windows", but
these programs are the result of thousands of man-hours of programming.  Finale
in particular is both indespensible and impossible to recreate.  So although it
is possible to create a DOS partition and do DOS work under it, there is a
certain coolness to being able to run another operating system's stuff under
UNIX.  I know there are some commerical UNIXes that do this, though I don't
know how reliable they are.  If I could just find some musical notation program
of similar quality for UNIX or run the one I have under UNIX, I would be very
happy.

Linux still kicks serious butt, though . ..

Hello all,

Some of you (very few of you, actually) are aware that I was writing some
BBS software for Unix (Linux, to be specific).  Here's an update:

I started over.

What I've done now is to create a new programming language called
M-Script.  It is an interpreted language but it is tightly written and
very fast.  It looks similar to dBase or BASIC.  Anyway, M-Script is
designed for writing BBS's and other on-line systems (MUD's etc).  It has
many built-in functions that deal with ANSI colors/graphics, file
browsing, hyper text screens, menus, data entry, blah, blah, blah.  Of
particular interest to many of you may be its built-in Internet apps like
finger, telnet, FTP, etc.

I'm now re-writing my BBS in M-Script.  It's going a _LOT_ faster now -
even though I'm basically creating a new programming language _and_ a BBS
written in that language at the same time.  Loads'o'fun.  Really.  I mean it.

If you want to see what M-Script can do, telnet to buckyball.camosun.bc.ca
(134.87.16.6) and log in as 'guest' (password is also 'guest').  Note that
I've currently limited the guest account to a maximum of 3 simultaneous
logins, so if it won't let you in try again in a few minutes.

*************************************************************************
NOTE: What you will see on buckyball is a mostly useless mock BBS.  It
exists primarily for me to test M-Script and BBS concepts.  It changes
from day to day.  If you're really lucky you'll catch it just as I'm
making changes and it'll dump out on you.  Help screens are there but are
incomplete, etc.  There is _very_ little that you can actually do.  Don't
assume this is what my real BBS will look like.  This is just a SAMPLER.
If you don't like the mock BBS don't freak out.  With M-Script it could
have any interface you want: command line, menu, hot-keys, RIP, GTP, etc.
*************************************************************************

People who are interested in M-Script can drop me a note.  I'll be looking
for a half dozen or so beta testers in the next week or so.  M-Script
ain't gonna be free, but beta testers will get a free copy.  If you want
to be a beta tester, tell me why and how you plan to make use of M-Script.
When I've finished writing the prliminary programmers' reference I'll send
a binary of the M-Script interpreter (for Linux or SunOS - your choice)
and the reference to at most 10 testers who I feel are _really_ gonna put
it through its paces.

I'm having the same problem. The only difference is that the group at

It happens if I have less than 2 MByte free on my root-partition.
I think it is something like fragmentation ...
Could that be possible ?

Uh, Derek, many of us are showing that symptom, or others (I got a hang for
about a minute and a half which then turned into a kernel panic).  I don't
*have* a sound card...

And it's hard to recompile 0.99.12 from an 0.99.9 system (needs new gcc, which
needs new libs, which need new kernel...), and even harder to recompile from a
DOS system.

Hi fellow netters,

I am looking at getting a soundcard/cd-rom for my pc.
I am also looking at supporting SCSI.
I run dos and 386bsd on the same pc with 245 and 520 meg IDE drives.

I was looking at a PAS-16 with SCSI interface.  Has anybody succeeded in
plugging SCSI disks and/or tape units into the SCSI interface ?

I presume that the SCSI is SCSI-1.  If I later buy a dedicated SCSI card,
such as an adaptec 1542 or whatever, is it possible to disable the SCSI
on the sound card (or even use both SCSI sources) ?

Has anyone on 386bsd (or linux) had any experience with this sort of card?

Is the SCSI fast enough (throughput) for usable disks, I seem to recall
reading that it was only 8-bit.

How bad does performance suffer if the sound card is not playing "sounds" ?
What about if it is ?

Any other suggestions for soundcards/cd-roms.
I liked the PAS-16, cause it supported SCSI and the cdrom looked like it
was a decent one.  But crumbs, for $1700 (aus) for the kit, it would wanta be.

Any help appreciated,
