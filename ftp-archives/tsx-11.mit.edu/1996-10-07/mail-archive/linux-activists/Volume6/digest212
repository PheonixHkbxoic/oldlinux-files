This is ever so true!  For a while last year I spent a lot of time playing 
around with Linux and connected it to my NeXT and got it networked, etc.  
To set up the network, MOST of the time spent was getting Linux configured,
and then it was setting up flat files and the /etc/rc.net script, etc...
major pain in the ass!  I learned networking, but that stuff is just not
ready for prime time.  On the NeXT it was cake...just add the ip address and
hostname...NFS was easy and more reliable, too.

I'm using an Epson Progression at work with 2 megs of VRAM and it's doing
1024x768 in 16 bit color...and it's quite snappy.  And if you don't need
color, 8-bit greyscale looks really good and is really fast.

No, this machine is NOT slow!

It does NOT require EISA for good performance and 16 megs is commonplace 
these days...I had a 386-40 with 16 megs for Linux and a 32 meg NeXTStation
Color...sure, the station needed more memory, but it was a hell of a lot
easier to use and way more useful.  All the NEXTSTEP machines in my office
are ISA machine with LocalBus video...none are slow!

Two weeks is a long time...but initially it took me a while to get networking
up and running...too much digging around the FAQ and stuff.  Once I got it
going, though, it was cake.  At one point, we added a machine in the basement,
but had to run wire and set up the files...we did the entire installation
in about 5 minutes (including running the wire!)

You have to remember how Linux started - as an experiment into playing with
the TSS properties of the 386.  And from there it kinda expanded (a tiny bit
:)

Personally, I think it'd be great to have linux on different computers, 
especially cheap ones - that way I can run a connection right to the toilet
and have my ZX81 hooked up to a sony Watchman, and whistle while I ....
But the main problem is what would have to be ported:
        The kernel -  a lot of which is 386 specific.
        The Drivers - see above
        The Utils - not as bad, just a recompile once you port
        GCC       - ugh.  Even though it is out for different 
                    architectures, you'd still have to do a linux port.
        X386      - Hmmm....I see a problem in the name itself.
                    XZ80 anyone?

Once you get done with all these, or even just the Kernel and GCC, it's
not really Linux anymore :(

Subject: A new user of LINUX (want to run DOS and make apps)
Date: 8 Sep 1993 14:47:45 -0500

Hi people there, 

I write because I want to be a user of LINUX, I have read that it can run 
DOS applications, thanks to a DOS emulation (it is true?) I am taking about 
the version 0.98

I also claims come with and XR11 graphic interface, how good is it?

I am going (if I change) to make Pascal and C applications, and if possible 
with Network (LAN) support. I would appreciate If you give a more personal 
presentation of this UNIX to me.

Can LINUX make multitasking? even with DOS apps?
Can it run System V apps? Can it be installed in a DOS formated harddisk?, 
does exist a dual boot utility?

If you some FAQS send me them please....
Because I am running a BBS and if possible, I will change from MSDOS to 
LINUX and run it from it. So LINUX could be a 'boooom' in the non actualized 
pc community (I am talking about students), that think that DOS with 386 are 
the most powerful plattform for low end applications. With LINUX maybe they 
can make high end apps.

THanks and bye

Daniel,

  I really find it quite obnoxious that whenever someone asks a relatively
harmless question someone else (you) has to jump on it.  I have as much humour
as anyone, but I honestly don't think that it's such a 'silly' thing to
consider porting Unix to the Atari line of things.  In fact, if someone 
has the source I'd be willing to hack away at it myself.  Now on the point
of your Commodore 128 - yep, that system would be hard pressed to run a 
Unix port.  Btw, sure Linux was written for PC computers, but it's a 
shame that people can't be more open-minded about other systems.  I'm not
asking you to buy them, but it'd be nice if you gave them a chance.  You
don't see me bashing the PC line - although, after having worked for IBM
I'm sure I could rightfully come up with many gripes.  

  Well, I've wasted enough bandwidth on this so I'll leave it at that.  If
you feel that you've got something more to say about this please do it by
e-mail.  No one likes a thread going on about personal disputes.

Thanks,
Jason.

Hello,
   I am running an application under dosemu (v0.49) and am receiving:
      Interupt vector x'5C' in use.
   Is there a way to reserve the interupt vector before entering the
   emulator? Or if anybody recognizes the interupt, is it possible to
   not execute the module responsible for the interupt before entering
   into the emulator?

Most recent version -  0.99 patchlevel 12
Yes, it can run a good bit of dos apps with the emulator.

X11R5, from the MIT sources.  It can be as good as you can make it with 
whatever you add. (Window Managers, apps...)

C is the native language.  There is a program that will convert pascal code
to C.  As for lan support.  All I know of is Ethernet.  It would be nice if
it could interface with Novell... :)

> Can LINUX make multitasking? even with DOS apps?

Yes, Linux is multitasking.  It can multitask even if you have DOS apps
running.  You can even run more than one instance of the dos emulator,
though it's probably not a good idea.

> Can it run System V apps? Can it be installed in a DOS formated harddisk?, 
> does exist a dual boot utility?

Don't know about the first one.  You should be able to compile them easily,
but I'm not sure about running the direct binaries.  No, it can't be
installed on a DOS partition, but it can access them.  Yes, there is a boot
utility.

> If you some FAQS send me them please....

FTP to tsx-11.mit.edu  in the directory /pub/linux/docs
They should be there.

Depends on what you call high end and low end apps.  Personally, I think 
Ultima Underworld is a high-end app.  :)

I had that original problem and I disappeared when I removed
my NE2000 ethernet card.  I think my problem was that it was 
trying to autoconfig for a WD ethernet card and that 
conflicted with my setting on the ethernet card.

Than again, if you don't have an ethernet card then I guess
that can't be it.

Hi all,

I'm just about ready to toss linux on my 386 (waiting for that new hard

something about 5-600 articles old about a problem with linux and 2 IDE
