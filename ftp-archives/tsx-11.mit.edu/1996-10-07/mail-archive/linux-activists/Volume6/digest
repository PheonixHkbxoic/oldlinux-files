Or you can remove (comment out) this line altogether if you don't mind
root being able to log in from anywhere.  eg. not on a network.

Hi, I hope somebody can help with a problem I have loading Linux.
I have been given a series of Linus disks but I can't even get the boot
disk to run. When I boot the computer from the disk, it checks for comms
and printer ports. It then checks the SCSI Bus and reports the
following:-

Future Domain: BIOS at ca0000; Port Base at 140 using IRQ 5
Future Domain: SCSI Bus Reset
Future Domain: IRQ 5 Requested from kernel
scsi0; Future Domain TMC-16x0
Future Domain TMC-16x0 scsi driver version 3.5
scsi: 1 hosts
scsi (Future Domain): Abort Phase=2; target = 0 comnd = 0x00 pieces = 0 size = 256
IMR = 0xdfd9
IRR = 0x0000
ISR = 0x0000
scsi Status    =  1
TMC Status     = 43
Interrupt Mask = 29
scsi (Future Domain): Abort Phase=2; target = 0 comnd = 0x00 pieces = 0 size = 256
IMR = 0xdfd9
IRR = 0x0000
ISR = 0x0000
scsi Status    =  1
TMC Status     = 43
Interrupt Mask = 29

At thios point the system hangs with the HD light permanently on but
there doesn't appear to be any disk or other activity.

On the SCSI bus I have 2 hard disks, a Toshiba CD-ROM drive and an
Archive Viper Taper Drive. Both access lights illuminate briefly when
the disk first runs but go out and don't come back on again.
The BIOS is by AMI and is dated 6/6/91.

I have been given two different boot disks (by the same person) and they
both stop at exactly the same place and the second disk was tested
before given to me to try.

Any clues or hints will be gratefully received.
Please reply direct as I don't receive this newsgroup regularly.

Hello all!

Suppose I have a 386 running linux with an ethernet card as I have
now.  Then suppose I have a 286 running DOS (bleh!).  Now, for some
reason, I want to access the files on the 286.  So, can I get an
ethernet card and, say, Novell Netware Lite and mount the PC disk(s)
via the network?

If so, is it hard and is it reliable?  If not, how can I accomplish
this while still running DOS on the 286?

Thanks in advance,

Magic is a famous VLSI cad tool on workstations.
It works find on our Sun Sparc 2.
Has anybody ever compiled it for Linux ?
Any suggestion is deeply appreciated.

I read this as "or *any* real OS" rather than "or any *real* OS".
See the difference? The former implies "or any (other) real OS";
the latter is a suicide note.

This may well be your problem (on top of the one I previously

Please help.

I installed SLS 1.03 version linux on my machine last night, but I have a few problems. My machine is as follows.

486/33 AMI
8MB Ram
340MB Western Digital IDE drive currently on ISA bus
ET4000 Local bus display card
Sound Blaster Pro

I partitioned the drive

C: 20 MB dos Boot
extended partition
hda3 Linux 120MB active *
hda4 Linux 16MB swap
D: 180MB dos

I then installed LILO sucessfully and made C: inactive.

My system boots correctly and loads in to root ok.

======

On bootup I get the following messages, ('icrus' is my hosts name)

. 
.Could someone please describe the format of these messages SIOC<text>
. 
. 
/etc/rc.net: icrus(2112)SIOCSIFADDR: Invalid Arguement

.Sep 9 23:52:58 init[1]: Entering runlevel: 6
.Sep 9 23:52:58 icrus sysloged: /var/log/notice: no such file or directory

I am presently only a standalone computer, and I know that these messages are in
response to the kernal not being able to setup the host, but what should I do to correct this, I dont want to do any damage. I also think that to get rid of the last error message I should create the /var/log/notice directory and file, however what
is this used for and again is it ok to do this. I am unsure.

Also ....

So far I have installed as far as C3, at which point the SLS installation requested the blank formatted disk to be inserted for bootup. I did this and after I have fiddled around a while with the system, I wanted to continue to install the rest of the complete sls install, namely disks Dx, Tx, Sx and Xx.

I used the command

sysinstall -series D (for installing the D series of disks.

The prog then requested that I place D1 in floppy disk and press return

I did so but the program did not attempt to read from fd0, it just requested the same message again. After three <return>'s the sysinstall prog fell back into linux.
NOW... I can mount the fd0 floppy disk, and read from it, so I mounted the floppy disk with D1 in it and tried the sysinstall again, but it still did not work.
I also used the sysinstall -mount command to no effect

WHY and again can you help.

Lastly...

How do I setup myself as a new user, because I do not wish to keep using root. I looked at the command useradd but the man pages were pretty unhelpful and there is no info on the FAQ's or the install guide for linux.

Got the same problem a while ago.  I don't have my linux box around,
so I can't be very precise.  The trouble is (again) with the signal
handling incompatibilities between BSD and POSIX.  The signal handler
that gets called to handle window resizing does not reinstall itself,
nor uses siginstall().  To patch: get the rlogin source from the NET-2
distribution, search for signal(SIGUSR1, SomeFunction) and patch
SomeFunction() to read something like:

        SomeFunction(sig)
        int sig;
        { <do your job>

          signal(sig, SomeFunction);
        }

I don't know for the ^C problem (not noticed this).

Subject: Problems with installation
Date: Fri, 10 Sep 93 09:58:23 GMT

Sorry to bother, but I am out of ideas as to what I am doing wrong.
First, the machine:
        486dx33 w/4MB RAM
        234 MB HDD
        VLB Video 7 Graphics card

Second, the Linux:  I am using the latest release of SLS on tsx-11.mit.edu.

Lastly, the problem:

To start at the beginning, I have a 120MB DOS partition.  I then set
up a 110k block partition for my file system and a 7k block partition
for swap space.  I create a file system using "mke2fs -c /dev/hda2"
and a swap partition using "mkswap /dev/hda3" and "swapon"  So far,
no errors.

Then I run doinstall.  When I insert disk a2 and start uncompressing
the first file (I skip over the faq), I run out of disk space.  I
don't even get the first file to uncompress from "bin.tgz" before
I run out of disk space.

I tried this again (all of it, first deleting the partions using 
fdisk and then rebuilding them) but to no avail.  I then tried
creating a DOS logical drive, formatted it (to make sure there was
nothing left from the Linux), deleted it, and tried to reinstall
Linux.

Does this sound at all familiar to anyone?  If so, what am I doing
wrong?

Thanks in advance for your help,

Travis

It's not all the fault of the architecture.
When I first wrote these drivers I wrote them for MACH2.5.

this is a closely related OS and I was running it on the same hardware
(in fact, the same MACHINE)

performance under 386bsd was always considerably less than performance
under mach 2.5, on the same PC.

This is basically an artifact of the newness of the vm and io systems
within 386bsd and derivatives. Work is underway
to rebuild these systems, under both NetBSD and FreeBSD
(no, it's not a duplication, both groups share info)

I expect that within the next 6 months there will be great improvements
in filesystem throughput.
Don't blame bill, or the people who did the vm port..
it's just new code. it needs a good shakedown and it is getting it.
things will improve. The big thing to remember is that
until 0.1, the emphasis was on just getting it running.
Now that it seems to run with some reliablility, we can go back
an look at what is going on inside.
