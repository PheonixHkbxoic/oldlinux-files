Hello Linuxers,

I try to install networking in SLS .99pl12. I've installed packages a + b1 (that includes tcpip). I then modified the file /etc/hosts like this:

146.136.1.99    modem1
146.136.1.0     network

I set /etc/host to modem1
and /etc/domain to ntb.ch

the I did a reboot:

by executing /etc/rc.net there is the following error message:

SIOCADDRT: Network is unreachable

if I do a /etc/ifconfig all seems to look proper.

I tried to start networking without /etc/rc.net by first installing loopback device and the device eth0.

ifconfig eth0 146.136.1.99 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 146.136.1.255

(netmask is correct)

route add 146.136.1.99   ---->  SIOCADDRT: Network is unreachable


the ethernet card is a WD8003 and is correctly detected at boot time.

What's Wrong ???


Please send e-mail

thanks thomas

I did retry the whole installation process (start from begining with repartion,
reboot, reinstall) several more times (at least 5) but I keep getting the same
problem.  Although when it crashes, it does not crash at the same address or
same disk or file.  The most I got so far is be able to read in up to disk b3
then it crashes.  Sometimes it crashes right at disk a2.

If anyone have any idea what causes the problem and how to fix it, I would
be appreciated.

Subject: 'ls' doesn't work on net-2 in.ftpd for shadow passwords
Date: 9 Sep 93 15:49:09 GMT

Could somebody please point out what I'm doing wrong?  Ever since
I installed linux-0.99.10 and got net-2 working, the ftp daemon
has not allowed connections to my machine.  I found out that it 
was because I was using shadow passwords and ftpd couldn't handle
that.  So, when the new net-2 faq came out and said to retrieve
the shadow-enabled programs, I got net2-shadow-bin.tgz and tried
ftpd.

I was finally able to connect, using ftp, to my machine and actually
log in.  But the 'ls' command wouldn't work.  The client and server
programs both thought everything had succeeded, but no listing of
files was produced.  The normal status messages were generated,
like

200 PORT command successful
150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for /bin/ls.
226 Transfer complete.

but no files were listed.  Ftping to any other machine worked
correctly.  And the 'nlist', 'bin', 'get', 'status', and 'rstatus'
commands all worked correctly when connected to my machine.

So I retrieved the ftpd source (ftpd.c says it's version 5.40 but
vers.c says it's version 5.60) and modified it to use shadow
passwords.  It has the same problem.

Can anybody tell me how to get an ftpd that works with shadow
passwords, either in binary form or the patches to the source?  I'd
really appreciate any help.

    You might want to check the permissions on xlock... It must be able to read
the /etc/shadow file to get the encrypted passwords. It should probably be
owned root.shadow and setgid for shadow.

        Is that legal? I thought the law always allowed reverse engineering 
as long as code isn't stolen/ I even think there was a lawsuit whose result 
proved that (could be wrong here though). Or is this another area where the 
ever so wonderful U.S legal system (barf) allows one to get sued even 
though what they are doing is perfectly legal?


as long as code isn'y stolen.

Xircom considers infomation necessary to program them to be proprietary.
I would not look for any Xircom drivers soon, if ever.  D-Link is probably
your best bet.  

I am in the same boat, as Xircom (PE2) is supported under BSDi;  I
therefore assumed that drivers would be forthcoming under Linux, et.al.
Found out after purchase that the BSDi drivers were produced under
non-disclosure, (_and_ that the PE3 is unsupported; that of course is the
adapter _I_ have :-(

Subject: bug in XFree 1.3 (XDrawArc)
Date: Thu, 9 Sep 1993 21:47:38 GMT

I have found a bug in the XDrawArc-routine of XFree 1.3.
Whenever I draw an arc of some specific size (and position?),
the X server freezes - for 45 seconds on a 386-40, only a short time
on a 486-33.  Even the mouse pointer cannot be moved.
The problem appears on a Hercules card as well as on VGA.

This is a short (and dirty) program, that demonstrates the bug:

=================== bite here ===================
#include <X11/Xlib.h>

int main()
{
    Display *display;
    int screen, xid;
    display = XOpenDisplay("");
    screen = DefaultScreen(display);
    xid = XCreateWindow(display, RootWindow(display, screen),
        0, 0, 300, 170, 0, DefaultDepth(display, screen),
        InputOutput, CopyFromParent, 0, 0);
    XDrawArc(display, xid, XCreateGC(display, xid, 0, 0),
        -409, -1113, 3576, 2358, 0, 64 * 360);
    XFlush(display);
    return 0;
}
=================== bite here ===================

If is too fast, just add a for(i=0;i<20;i++) around the
XDrawArc :-).

BTW, I have the slight feeling, that the circle is not drawn exactly
with the specified width/height but maybe one pixel too wide.
(But I will have to test around a bit further.)
