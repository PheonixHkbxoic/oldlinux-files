I had the same problem and all I did was to put the broadcast in the ifconfig
line before the netmask, and that seemed to fix the problem.

So instead of:
>   /usr/etc/ifconfig eth0 ${IPADDR} netmask ${NETMASK} broadcast ${BROADCAST}

try:
    /usr/etc/ifconfig eth0 ${IPADDR} broadcast ${BROADCAST} netmask ${NETMASK} 

Whether that is a 'correct' solutionor not, I am not sure.  But it works.

Some deal!  You can have an 8 port Digiboard with socketed UARTs for $410
from Programmer's Paradise, and I'm sure better deals can be had.  Without
socketed UARTs, that's a major ripoff.

I assume you are writing to an NFS-mounted partition.

It's because NFS maps away your root permissions from the client to some
other userid (usually 'nobody' or -2). To get root permissions you must
modify the /etc/exports file on the server such that your client machine
is allowed root access to that filesystem.

HELP!  I can't add users under slackware.  I have it installed and connected
to Internet okay, but I can only login as root, and I can't add users.
Useradd seems to run okay, but when I try to change the passwd from the
root account for the new user, or try to modify or delete it, it says
'user does not exist' or something to that effect.  I'm sure I'm making
some stupid mistake, but I can't find any info about it in the Install-howto
or the FAQ's.  I tried to install the user manually, as per the FAQ but
it still didn't work.  When I try to useradd the user again, without
deleting its entry in passwd and shadow, it gives me that the identifier
exists, but nothing else can find the user.

Help extremely appreciated...

[ most of good list of stuff to do deleted for space ]

First off, I have a slight addition to the list of things you must have.

Thanks to Stephen Tweedie for helping me with this not too long ago!  All
credit for the following goes to Stephen.  Any errors in the interpretation
of his e-mail to me are mine.

Basically, versions of e2fsck before 0.3 had a bug where if a filesystem
was checked (i.e., clean flag not set), but no repairs had to be made, the
clean flag wouldn't be set.  The clean flag would only be set if there were
actually errors in the filesystem that had to be corrected.

So make sure you have at least version 0.3 of e2fsck (I don't know if there
is a more recent version---0.3 is the latest one I've seen, but I do know
it works).  If you don't have 0.3 or better, you'll end up having the root
filesystem checked every time you boot, and you'll always see the complaint
about it being unchecked.

>2) put 'read-only' in /etc/lilo/config, and rerun /etc/lilo/install.

Or if, like me, you don't run lilo (I use bootlin and switch in config.sys),
you can just use ``rdev -R Image 1'' to set the kernel itself to mount the
root partition readonly.

Later,

Subject: How does Linux compare to SUN IPC?
Date: Wed, 22 Sep 1993 05:31:34 GMT

It has seemed to me that my Linux system at home (X and GCC running in
a 15mb partition, on a 386-40, with room to spare) is faster than the
SUN IPC workstations I use at school.  I can only offer subjective 
speculation though, ie. time for a xterm to open, etc... 

I was wondering, if anyone has done benchmarks between the two for
various processors.  I am not saying that Linux is better, it still
has a ways to go before it can match the all around appeal of the SUN.

Thanks.

Look for term 1.07, which allows you to do this.  You can get it from (if
memory serves) ftp.tartarus.uwa.edu.au (Can't remember if that's the right
machine name, but it's close).

I'll repeat it for the n-th time. The 1542B hasn't been made (I think) to be
SCSI-2 compatible, but the 1542B does implement all the mandatory SCSI-2
features that were optional in SCSI-1. These extra features are hardly worth
mentioning, because almost every contempory SCSI controller (except the old
Atari ST and perhaps the older Macs) does implement those extra features.

Note that Fast and Wide SCSI-2, Command Queuing and Asynchronous Event
Notification are optional in SCSI-2 and the 1542B does not support ANY of
the optional SCSI-2 features. Neither does the 1542C, I believe.

So the fact that the 1542B may be called SCSI-2 compatible doesn't buy you
much. Actually, I advise not to buy any SCSI device that isn't SCSI-2
compatible as a SCSI device that doesn't allow arbitration or the extended
sense data option might not work in your computer system. But don't think
that a SCSI-2 device will be faster than a SCSI-1 device, although it
certainly might be faster, but check it out first!

The problem went away after recompiling the kernel!  All I did was

Hi Linuxers,

And what! It didn't recognise my SCSI disk.  It DOES recognise my SCSI card...

I got Slackware bootdisk from ftp.cdrom.com yesterday evening (september 21)

The weird thing is: I have SLS 1.03 running for a couple of weeks now,
SCSI disk no problem!

SCSI controller is Future Domain TMC-950
SCSI Disk is something like 150 Meg CDC 94161-9 Firmware rev. 6291 512bytes/sec

Question: WHY is my appropriate SCSI low-level driver excluded from the

Subject: [A]RAWDISK.SYS: QIC-80 Backup of non-DOS disks
Date: 22 Sep 93 11:41:12 GMT


Currently a lot of work is done, to implement a driver for
QIC-80 (Floppycontroller-) Streamertapes. In the meantime I
decided to write a DOS device driver, that enables logical
access to non-DOS disks/partitions under DOS.

RAWDISK.SYS is a DOS device driver, that maps an arbitrary
portion of a harddisk (given by a start- and endcylinder) onto a
logical DOS drive. The HD area is accessed (read or written)
through a regular DOS file. Logical drive administration areas
(bootsector, FAT and rootdirectory) are totally virtual, hence
no additional HD space is required.

The primary intention for this device driver is to get logical
access to harddisks and partitions foreign to DOS, to enable the
usage of any QIC-80 streamer and its DOS based backup software
for making image backups of this HD area. The general approach
of this driver, however, makes it possible to use almost any
useful DOS utilities to manipulate the HD area.

I recommend reading the documentation carefully. This is
especially true, if you use this driver with a DOS version other
than MS-DOS 5.0 or with a partitioned disk or with a disk that
has more than 1024 cylinders or 63 sectors or 16 heads, because
some features/limitations should be taken notice of. It is easy
to destroy the contents of the whole disk misusing this driver.
The driver requires partitions laying on cylinder boundaries,
as long as you want to access a single partition only.

The driver is available from:
