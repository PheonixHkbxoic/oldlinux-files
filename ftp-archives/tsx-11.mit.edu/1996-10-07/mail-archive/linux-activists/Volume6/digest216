Hey buddy.  You do have options, however, they are not Linux.
I am afraid that Linux relies on the architecture of the 386 or better
to opperate, and you will need to do some serious code writing
(equal to writing an os) to over-rule it.  HOWEVER, you asked
if there was a NON-multitasking LInux.  Well, if you are looking
for Non multitasking, you could always use one of many
Unix shells for dos.  This would yield the greatest speed, and provide
unix tools, programming, and UUCP.
As an alternet (sp) you could use (I believe) Xenix, atleast
for the 286, and (I think) Minix is available for 8088/286, and 
I have heard that there was a small version of BSD for the same.
this is all over hearing, since I haven't used any of these OS's
(except Xenix, which works great on a 386/16 laptop)
Good luck on your quest,
Me?, I just put 2 more XT's that have become available in this 
department, I just hung them on one of the hosts I have here,
the more terminals, the merrier.

I had simmilar problems with mine.  First, go to /usr/X386/tst/mouse
and or /usr/X386/lib/X11/tst/mouse
these both came with SLS 1.0
either one of these programs can be used to test the mouse.
also, read /usr/X386/lib/X11/INSTALL.base
this has many good hints about configuring your mouse.
HINT: remove your /dev/mouse file, and create it as described
in INSTALL.base with mknod.

Date: Fri, 10 Sep 1993 00:50:36 GMT

I recently installed SLS 1.03 on a 486DX50.  I have the following
problem:

After I added an user with useradd, I did passwd USERNAME to assign an
password, passwd reported the passwd has been changed. However, when I
try to login with that user name, it says password incorrect. I then
edited /etc/passwd and removed the password field *, this make login
bypass password checking. So the result is I cann't have any security
on my linux.

When I change password for root, it never takes effect on login, my
root login dos not ask for an password.  However, when I su root, the
password prompt shows up, and accept the correct one I set.

Could someone help me, thanks lot in advance.

Subject: Adaptec 1522 support?
Date: Fri, 10 Sep 1993 00:35:38 GMT


Hey, Linuxers!  (Ain't it great!)

I've been trying to install Linux on a Taiwanese motherboard with
SCSI local bus ... a GA-400 motherboard that claims Adaptec 1522
H/W and S/W compatibility.  Upon booting, Linux says that it doesn't
recognize any SCSI hosts or disks, and it won't install.

Is this because Linux doesn't support the 1522, or because of the
motherboard?

Any help would be appreciated.

Not really sure (not a termcap expert ), but a workaround for now is
issuing the command:

stty erase [hit the backspace or a del key here if interactive]

              or

stty erase '?' 

in a file that you execute.

I had the same problem in XFree86 1.2.  It's the kind of thing that
prompts one to buy a book on termcaps which I haven't needed to use
yet because XFree 1.3 fixed that (uses del instead of control-h).

The only reference I can find in that book for 'vs' (for visual start)
says it's for cursor intensity; when visual mode (vi) was added to ex 
(the real name of this editor), this mode has added to termcaps:
"makes the cursor very visible", such as a flashing block instead of
an underline.  The def to look for is 'bs' which represents ^H.  To
use something else, bc= capability must be used.  I'm not really sure
what to make of the rest...sorry.  This is one of the first good looks
I've had at this book.  It's one of the Nutshell series and looks pretty
good.

The Linux distribution kernels do not support the Adaptec 1522.  However,
Juergen Fischer has written a driver, and it is in public ALPHA test.

FTP tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/ALPHA/scsi/aha1522/*

Apply the patches and build a new kernel.

I used two IDE's quite nicely until my recent upgrade to a scsi drive
on an isa bus motherboard with an onboard host.  There might be some
kind of problem some VLB hosts, but I doubt it otherwise.  It's probably
not a bad idea to have two drives of similar geometry, but I don't think
it's necessary.

:       Is that legal? I thought the law always allowed reverse engineering

: though what they are doing is perfectly legal?

The current issue of Communication of the ACM has an article about this.
It was kind of an eye-opener to me about copyrights in general.
From what I can gather, it is perfectly legal to reverse engineer as long
as you don't use any code from what you got.  And the sueing bit is kind
of a mute point for us.  What are they going to sue us for?  Well, I guess
lawyers cost money, but Xircom wouldn't gain anything by that.  The code
would already be released.

Having said that, I don't think we should support loser companies that don't
release hardware specs.  In the long run they are not benefitting themselves
anyway.  I'm all for "helping" them go out of business buy not buying their
stuff and encouraging others to not buy it.  I think it should be a Linux
principle not to port stuff to companies that do not release their specs.

well I think that instead of people porting something that was written
from ground up on a 386 to some(possibly completely different) architecture
(like a refrigerator) they should instead see the impact linux
has made on the PC community, see how it works and *write a different*
operating system for that machine, built from the ground up so that it 
works 100% on that machine - theres no need to have "linux" as such
running on macs and amigas etc etc, they are looking for a program
which does the same job.

just my 0.02...

Don't know about the TERMCAP entry (not an expert!) but you can remap
using the command:

   xmodmap -e "keysym BackSpace = Delete"

Shutdown runs the script '/etc/brc' which actually does the job of umounting:

/etc/brc:

    #!/bin/sh
    echo "Unmounting Filesystems"
    umount -a

and make sure it's owned by root with perms 700.

It's been repeated many times: Xircom will not release programming
information, and thus there won't be a Linux driver for any Xircom
product.  But you should call them and ask for a Linux driver anyway.
Point out that it didn't say "for use with DOS only" in the
advertisement. 

The same holds true for the Cabletron E21xx series, although
Cabletron may write a E21xx driver themselves.  Or Cabletron may just be
saying that so that they don't lose current sales -- that's an old
trick in the proprietary game.
