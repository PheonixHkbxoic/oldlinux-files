Subject: Tape Drive (Trakker) / ZModem
Date: 13 Sep 93 05:07:39 GMT

Hi,
I'm using Linux from SLS 1.03 package (It's great!!!) and I have 2 
questions about it:

1. I have a 250M Colorado Trakker tape backup drive that plugs into a  
parallel port. Can I somehow use this drive with Linux and if yes how? 
I'd really like to backup from Linux onto it.

2. I'm logging in my school's computer very often and I'd like to use ZModem
to download and upload files to my account. What comm program should I use
to be able to download with sz? I tried kermit but it takes about 5 times
as long as when I use ZModem with PCPlus for DOS. 


Thank you and I'll post a summary of responses!

That's because of the difference in clock speeds. A rule of
thumb is that at a given clock speed a 486 is about 1/3 faster
than a 386, and that performance increases roughly linearly
(very, very roughly) in this range of clock speeds.
Comparing your 386/25 with your 486/33 you can see where the
factor of two comes from. The usual "386 v 486" question
centres on the comparison of a 386/40 with a 486/33.

Subject: What about a new numbering for Linux?
Date: Mon, 13 Sep 1993 12:55:58 GMT

Hello Linux developers and friends!

I am shure, that it is time for a change with the Linux numbering system.
Everyone, who really knows Linux, knows that it is an experimental system.
Keeping this in mind, there is no reason to avoid numbers greater than 1.00.
I think the best way of a change would be to skip off the redundant 0.99.
e.g:
Linux 0.99p12 would change to Linux 12.0 

This change would also stop the need (if there was really one) of several 
versions having the same name (like under Linux 0.99p12)

Many thanks to all developers of Linux!

If you want the works, then you'd need to set up an IP connection of some sort
onto the net.  This would probably mean running SL/IP.  I not familiar with
the state of the net in the UK, but here in Australia it is pretty restricted,
and a true IP connect is impossible unless you're with one of the Universities.

If what you really want is just mail/news, consider setting up uucp.  Everything
you need comes with SLS, and it's a damned sight cheaper to run...

First make sure you have the right IRQ.  If your mouse uses IRQ 2, set the
mouse IRQ in busmouse.h to IRQ 9.  (Don't ask.  I'm not sure I understand
it all either.)  While you're at it, to save time.  Set the mouse IRQ for
the inport mouse support (atixlmouse.c?) to IRQ 9 as well.

Configure linux to have both INport and busmouse support.

Now, using the mouse tester, try all combinations of drivers and
configured devices.  My mouse finally responded reasonably to the inport
device and the MMseries software.  Go figure. I thought I had a busmouse too.

It's always a good idea to keep the a1.3 disk around (assuming you
installed SLS).  You could have booted it, mounted your
linuxpartition, and repared the rootacount.

First thing I'd ask:  Do you have a swap-space, either partition or file,
created (mkswap ...) and enabled (swapon -a)?

It may be that your setup configureation got hosed.  Try rebooting and enter
your hardware setup program (Usaully pressing <DEL> or <F2> or somthing during

I hope that fixes you floppy problem.

        Did you figure out why no more windows could be opened?  There
are a few reasons I can think of:

        1) You're out of pty's -- I think there are only 16 for Linux
           and no one ever answers questions on how to increase them.

        2) You're out of processes.  64 is the max number the standard
           Linux distribution can have open.  I think this can be
           adjusted with NR_TASKS in include/linux/tasks.h and
           recompiling the kernel.  (There might be other things
           to do, so search the archives or repost for instructions).

Other things that may not be as you think:

        3) You didn't install the swap correctly.  It's not mounted,
           but swapon'ed.  A command 'swapon -a' will activate all
           the swap files in /etc/fstab.  Check this with free, which 
           should report something like (this is the kmem free)

              size       used      cache       free     shared
memory:      15284       3748      10832        704       2540
swap0:       10396          0                 10396          0
total:       25680       3748      10832      11100       2540

        4) You're reading used and free space wrong.  (Kmem) Used is the
           measure of how much is used by the processes.  Free really 
           includes the memory allocated to cache (which can be used by more
           processes).  Below is what /proc/meminfo says which matches
           the above free command.  You have to subtract buffers from 
           the used to get the amount used by the processes.

        total:   used:    free:   shared:  buffers:
Mem:  15650816 14934016   716800  2592768 10547200
Swap: 10645504        0 10645504

           So in reality: 

             Kmem free space = size - used
             Proc free space = total - ( used - buffers)

After some experimenting I found out the root of my Linux UUCP
problem.  It seems that ownership of the UUCP files (in /usr/lib/uucp,

during installation.  (Uid 11 is not in the installed passwd or group
files.)  I was setting the ownership to "uucp" (uid = 5, I think)
which should work but I think that I may have to set (haven't tried
this yet!) the ownership of several of the UUCp executables, (e.g. cu,
uuname, etc. in /usr/bin), from uid 11 to "uucp" too.  After setting
the ownership, I could uucico to download and upload mail to a remote
UUCP host via cron.  Smail mail conversion to C.* and D.* files works
like mint and so does uugetty for dial-outs.

However there are still some workarounds needed:
1) I have to use -x with a level of 2 and above to get uucico to
   actually dial out.  If I don't use -x or use -x1, the modem will
   not dial out even though two lights on Hayes Smartmodem (forgot the
   names for the lights but it is the 3rd and 4th lights from the
   right).  Interestingly they are the same set of lights that flicker
   a lot when I don't use the -r flag for getty or uugetty for the 
   modem line (cua1).
2) I have to occassionally delete the audit.local file otherwise
   uucico will not dial out.  I don't know why.  Perhaps it has
   something to do with the file size???


Other than that UUCP mail works fine.  I'll try out the news
capability later.

I am having problems dialing in to my Linux SLS 1.03 machine.  The
modem (on cua1 with "uugetty -r" or "getty -r") would answer but I
don't get the system to respond; no prompt no nothing.  I tried
creating /etc/default/getty.modem and /etc/default/uugetty.modem so
that the getty.log doesn't complain about missing default file for
modem.  I also tried changing the "next" labels /etc/gettydefs to
cycle through the various modem speeds (originally they cycle through
themselves e.g. 2400 back to 2400).  But to no avail.

Any suggestion on what needs to be set to get dial in to work on my
SLS 1.03 machine?

a SVGA card, and then used in 600x800 res. mode to run X with colors? This
is probably a stupid idea, because I don't know if the pin def./connector
is compatible between SVGA and VGA. But still it would be a very inexpensive
way of upgrading to color.
Any comments?
Thanks,
