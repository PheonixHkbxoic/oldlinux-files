The RocketPort(R) Linux Driver (6529) Release 1.07  July 11, 1995
  -- A driver for the Comtrol(tm) RocketPort Intelligent Serial Port Cards

PRODUCT OVERVIEW
----------------
This driver provides a loadable kernel driver for the RocketPort and 
RocketPort RA serial boards. These boards provide, 8, 16, or 32 high-speed
serial ports while requiring only 68 bytes of I/O space for all 8, 16, or 32
ports, and do not require an interrupt channel. This driver supports
up to four RocketPort or RocketPort RA boards in one machine simultaneously.
If you are using four 32 port RocketPort boards, you can put as many as 128
intelligent serial ports on your system.

INSTALLATION PROCEDURES
-----------------------
Read the instructions found in the HW-INSTALL file or the Hardware Reference
Card shipped with the board to install the RocketPort into your computer.

After the board(s) are installed:
1.  Copy the comtrol-1.04.tar.gz file to /usr/src.

2.  untar the file using GNU tar like this:
                  tar xzvf comtrol-1.04.tar.gz

3.  A subdirectory of /usr/src now exists called comtrol.  This contains the
    RocketPort driver and associated files.

4.  Edit the "rc.rocket" script so that the ROCKET_ARG variable defined 
    at the beginning of the script has the correct I/O addresses for your
    board(s), using the configuration options "board1", "board2", "board3", 
    and "board4". 

    For example, if you only have one board installed at I/O port 0x280,
    then this line should be set as follows:

         ROCKET_ARG="board1=0x280"

    For example, if you have two boards, one installed at 0x100 and the
    second installed at 0x180, then this line should read as follows:

         ROCKET_ARG="board1=0x100 board2=0x180"

    Note: Make sure that you allow a 68-byte contiguous address block for the
          first board (starting at 0x100h, 0x140h, 0x180h, 0x200h, 0x240h,
          0x280h, 0x300h, 0x340h, or 0x380h). The second, third, or fourth
          boards require a 64-byte contiguous address block, starting at one
          of the ranges mentioned above but not overlapping the first board.

    Run 'make install'

5.  Optionally, edit your /etc/rc.d/rc.S file so that the "rc.rocket"
    script is run automatically each time your system boots.

COMPATIBILITY ISSUES
--------------------
For backward compatibility with the serial drivers, the driver
supports the remapping of 38,400 baud to either 57,600 baud
or 115,200 baud. 

In addition, "setrocket" can be used to remap 38,400 baud to 230,400 baud.
This can improve performance when using high-speed (28,800 bps with
compression) modems. Beware, however, that not all modems support 230400 baud
 --- check your modem manual for more details.

If your system has a recent shared libc installed *and*
your communication programs have been recompiled to take advantage of
57,600 and 115,200 baud rates, then you may not need to use the
remapping option. 230,400 baud still requires the remapping option
until the appropriate changes can be propagated into the kernel, libc,
and communication programs so as to support this speed directly.
