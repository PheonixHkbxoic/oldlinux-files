Release notes for the Comtrol Rocketport Driver.

Version 1.12, 9-Sep-96
======================

Some Linux header files have the incorrect PCI values, since Comtrol
changed the assignments before some of the PCI boards went into
production.  Added support for the RP4QUAD and RP8J boards.

Fixed (rare) race condition in rp_hangup() which happened if the port
was closing during the hangup.

Version 1.11, 9-May-96
======================

Use officially assigned (static) major numbers, #46 and #47, for the
/dev/ttyR and /dev/cur devices, respectively.

Add fail-safe to make sure we don't accidentally signal a hangup due
to the hardware burping and issueing a spurious DELTA_CD interrupt.

Change how the driver loading works; "make install" now installs both
rocket.o and mod_rocket.o in /lib/modules.  The rc.rocket script will
try to load both modules.  This is more failsafe than trying to
determine whether the Linux kernel supports CONFIG_MODVERSIONS or not.
The rc.rocket script will now also unload the driver if given the
argument of "stop".

Add support for 230400 and 460800 baud using the native Linux
baud-rate mechanism. (Support for 230400 baud is already present in
modern libc and kernels; support for 460800 baud will require changes
in a future libc.  Note that application programs must support the use
of the termios.h defines B230400 and B460800 if they wish to access
these high speed baud rates using the termios interface.)

Added Doug Ledford's timing statistics code.  (Note: requires a
Pentium processor.)

Fixed a potential race condition problem in rp_write().

Added debugging/bulletproofing for "can't happen" situations.  They
get now logged as a warning and driver will continue robustly past the
error.  (If any "rp: WARNING" messages are logged, that's a sign of a
race condition; please notify tytso@mit.edu if this happens.)

Version 1.10, 2-Apr-96
======================

Added support for 460kbaud.

Fixed two race conditions in rp_do_transmit() which occured when there
was an attempt to transmit while the port was closing.

Updated install procedure so that it can correctly determine whether
or not the kernel has been built with modversions.  (Needed because of
a change made in late 1.2 kernels.)

Don't try to build mod_rocket.o if /usr/include/linux/modversions.h
doesn't exist.

Version 1.09, 2-15-96
=====================

Add support for 1.2 ELF and 1.3 non-modversion kernels.

Add support for PCI Rocketport boards.

Fix "soft hang" race condition.

Version 1.08, 1-16-96
=====================

Update documentation file.

Add support for compiling under 1.3 kernels.

Add support for the CSTOPB termios bit, which controls whether 1 or 2
stop bits are used.

Fixed race condition in block_till_ready() that could cause system
lockups/crashes on busy machines where hangups happened frequently.

Fixed more (very subtle) race conditions in rp_close() and rp_open().

Changed use of timer channel from 3 to 15, to avoid conflicts with the
kswap II patch.

Version 1.07, 11-Jul-95
=======================

Fixed documentation file HW-INSTALL so that the dip switches 7 and 8
are labeled MUST BE ON instead of MUST BE OFF.

Added code to reserve, check, and release IO port reservations.

Version 1.06, 21-May-95
=======================

Fixed a bug which caused odd and even parity to be incorrectly set
when parity was enabled.

Version 1.05, 19-May-95
=======================

Fixed bug in the rocketport driver which caused it to produce kernel
OOPS if a hangup occurred while data was being transmitted.

Fixed bug in the rocketport driver which caused it to not work with
the SLIP driver.  (Actually, whether the bug was in the rocketport
driver or in the SLIP driver is not quite clear, since the SLIP driver
was using the tty driver interface in a non-standard fashion.)

Changed the naming of the callout ports from /dev/cuR## to /dev/cur##.
This is to conform with the proposed new serial port device naming
scheme.  Note that if you were using version 1.04, and had configured
your system to use the callout ports, you may need to change some
configuration files.  For backwards compatibility, setrocket will
generate device names using the old device name if the -o flag is
passed to it, but it is suggested that you transition to the new
names.

Version 1.04, 25-Mar-95
=======================

Initial public release of the Comtrol Rocketport Driver.
