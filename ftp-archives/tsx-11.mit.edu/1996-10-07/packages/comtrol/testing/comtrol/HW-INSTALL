PCI Rocketport Boards
=====================

Just plug it in.  :-) The PCI Rocketport board is completely
plug-and-play.  The Rocketport driver will automatically find the
Rocketport baord and use the correct I/O address for the PCI Board.

ISA Rocketport Boards
=====================

Unfortunately, the ISA bus is not as advanced as the PCI Rocketport
board, and so you must assign and configure the I/O addresses used by
the Rocketport card before installing and using it.  This is done by
setting a set of DIP switches on the Rocketport board.


SETTING THE I/O ADDRESS
-----------------------

Before installing RocketPort(R) or RocketPort RA boards, you must find
a range of I/O addresses for it to use. The first RocketPort card
requires a 68-byte contiguous block of I/O addresses, starting at one
of the following: 0x100h, 0x140h, 0x180h, 0x200h, 0x240h, 0x280h,
0x300h, 0x340h, 0x380h.  This I/O address must be reflected in the DIP
switiches of *all* of the Rocketport cards.

The second, third, and fourth RocketPort cards require a 64-byte
contiguous block of I/O addresses, starting at one of the following
I/O addresses: 0x100h, 0x140h, 0x180h, 0x1C0h, 0x200h, 0x240h, 0x280h,
0x2C0h, 0x300h, 0x340h, 0x380h, 0x3C0h.  The I/O address used by the
second, third, and fourth Rocketport cards (if present) are set via
software control.  The DIP switch settings for the I/O address must be
set to the value of the first Rocketport cards.  

In order to destinguish each of the card from the others, each card
must have a unique board ID set on the dip switches.  The first
Rocketport board must be set with the DIP switches corresponding to
the first board, the second board must be set with the DIP switches
corresponding to the second board, etc.  IMPORTANT: The board ID is
the only place where the DIP switch settings should differ between the
various Rocketport boards in a system.

The I/O address range used by any of the RocketPort cards must not
conflict with any other cards in the system, including other
RocketPort cards.  Below, you will find a list of commonly used I/O
address ranges which may be in use by other devices in your system.
On a Linux system, "cat /proc/ioports" will also be helpful in
identifying what I/O addresses are being used by devics on your
system.

Remember, the FIRST RocketPort uses 68 I/O addresses.  So, if you set it
for 0x100, it will occupy 0x100 to 0x143.  This would mean that you
CAN NOT set the second, third or fourth board for address 0x140 since
the first 4 bytes of that range are used by the first board.  You would
need to set the second, third, or fourth board to one of the next available
blocks such as 0x180.

Here are some commonly used I/O cards and the I/O addresses which they
may use. This is not a complete list, but it may help you in choosing
an appropriate I/O range for your RocketPort cards which does not
conflict with your other adaptor cards.

CABLE PINOUTS
-------------
The RS-232 ports provided by the the Rocketport 8, the Rocketport 16, 
and the Rocketport 32 are female DB-25 exporting a DTE interface. This is in
contrast to the RS-232 ports exported by the standard PC-clone serial ports,
which generally tend to be *male* DB-25 connectors with a DTE interface. The
reason for this difference is historical; RS-232 computer interfaces used by
larger computers to serve banks of terminals have traditionally used female
DTE ports, and the RocketPort cards adhere to this convention.

This is generally not a problem, however. You merely need to keep
this in mind when obtaining cables to use with the Rocketport
interface. If you already have cables, a male-male gender changer is
all that you will need to convert the interface box to the PC's male
DTE.

If you are connecting a RocketPort port to a modem (which is a DCE
device generally using a female DB-25 plug), then, what you will need is
a straight-through male/male DB-25 cable. 

If you are connecting a RocketPort modem to a terminal (which is a DTE
device generally using a male DB-25 plug), what you will need is
male/female null modem cable.

An inexpensive alternative is the RocketPort RA Octacable card. It is an
8-port solution that provides you with a cable that plugs into the card
using a 78-pin connector with 8 cables exporting DB25 male DTE connections.
These cables can plug directly into external modems for example.

Here are the pinouts used by the Rocketport interface:

Pin            Signal
=========================
 1             Not Used
 2             Transmit Data
 3             Receive Data
 4             Ready to Send
 5             Clear to Send
 6             Data Set Ready
 7             Signal Ground
 8             Data Carrier Detect
 15            RS-422 (+) Receive Data
 17            RS-422 (-) Receive Data
 19            RS-422 (+) Transmit Data
 20            Data Terminal Ready
 25            RS-422 (-) Transmit Data

Note: The RS-422 pinouts are only available when you use the
RS-232/RS-422 interface box --- this box has a switch that supports
either RS-232 or RS-422 mode.

HARDWARE INSTALLATION PROCEDURES
--------------------------------
To prepare your RocketPort for installation, you will need to set the I/O
address DIP switch. After you set the I/O DIP switch, you are ready to install
the card. Use the following steps to install the card:
1.  Turn the power switch for the system unit to the OFF position.
2.  Remove the system unit cover.
3.  Select a slot to install the card.
4.  Remove the expansion slot cover.
5.  Insert the card in the expansion slot, make sure that it is properly
    seated.
6.  Attach the card to the chassis with the expansion slot screw.
7.  Replace the cover on the system unit.

IF CONNECTING A SYSTEM WITH AN INTERFACE BOX
--------------------------------------------
1.  Attach the male end of the RocketPort or RocketPort RA cable to the
    card and the female end to the connector on the interface box labeled
    "Host."
Note: If you have a RocketPort 32 or RocketPort RA32, the connector 
      labelled J1 corresponds to Ports 0 through 15 on the interface box 
      and the connector labeled J2 (closest to the bus) corresponds to 
      Ports 16 through 31.
2.  Connect the peripherals to the interface box.

IF CONNECTING A SYSTEM WITH AN OCTACABLE
----------------------------------------
1.  Attach the male end of the Octacable to the card.
2.  Connect the Octacable to the peripherals.
