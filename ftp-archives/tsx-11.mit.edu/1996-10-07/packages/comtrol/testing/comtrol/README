The RocketPort(R) Linux Driver (6529) Release 1.12  September 9, 1996
  -- A driver for the Comtrol(tm) RocketPort Intelligent Serial Port Cards

PRODUCT OVERVIEW
----------------
This driver provides a loadable kernel driver for the RocketPort and 
RocketPort RA serial boards. These boards provide, 8, 16, or 32 high-speed
serial ports while requiring only 68 bytes of I/O space for all 8, 16, or 32
ports, and do not require an interrupt channel. This driver supports
up to four RocketPort or RocketPort RA boards in one machine simultaneously.
If you are using four 32 port RocketPort boards, you can put as many as 128
intelligent serial ports on your system.

INSTALLATION PROCEDURES
-----------------------
Read the instructions found in the HW-INSTALL file or the Hardware Reference
Card shipped with the board to install the RocketPort into your computer.

After the board(s) are installed:
1.  Copy the comtrol-1.12.tar.gz file to /usr/src.

2.  untar the file using GNU tar like this:
		  cd /usr/src
                  tar xzvf comtrol-1.12.tar.gz

3.  A subdirectory of /usr/src now exists called comtrol.  This contains the
    RocketPort driver and associated files.

4.  Recompile the Rocketport driver.  (This is not always necessary, depending
	on the version of your kernel, but it is safe to do):

		make clean
		make

5.  Install the Rocketport driver as root:

		make install

6.  If you are using more than one ISA Rocketport board, or have
    installed your ISA Rocketport card at a non-standard address, you
    will set up the file /etc/rocketport.conf.  /usr/src/comtrol
    contains an example rocketport.conf file.  Copy it to the /etc
    directory and edit it according to the comments contained in that
    file.  This step is NOT necessary if you are using only PCI
    Rocketports.

7.  Optionally, edit your /etc/rc.d/rc.S file (or other appropriate
    boot-up script)so that the "rc.rocket" script is run automatically
    each time your system boots.

COMPATIBILITY ISSUES
--------------------

For backward compatibility with the conventional serial driver, and
previous versions of the Comtrol Rocketport, the driver supports the
remapping of 38,400 baud to either 57,600, 115,200, or 230,400 baud.
Note that not all modems support speeds faster than 115200 baud ---
check your modem manual for more details.

In addition, "setrocket" can be used to remap 38,400 baud to 460,800
baud.

If your system has a recent shared libc installed *and* your
communication programs have been recompiled to take advantage of
57,600, 115,200, or 230400 baud rates, then you may not need to use
the remapping option.  However, the use of 460,800 baud will still
require the remapping option until the appropriate changes can be
propagated into the kernel, libc, and communication programs so as to
support this speed directly.
