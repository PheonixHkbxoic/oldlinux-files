Hi all,

this version of InterViews works fine (for me) on my 486, with 16 Mb of ram.
I used libc-4.5.21, libg++-4.5.3l.2 and gcc-2.5.8.  My kernel is 0.99.15h.

The installed packages is about 12 Mb in total and will install to
/usr/local/InterViews.  You need to zcat iv-31-bin.tgz | tar -xvf - in /.
Check the perms afterwards.

The source I used is the original stanford distribution, using the linux
patches (X11/development/iv_linux.tgz).
