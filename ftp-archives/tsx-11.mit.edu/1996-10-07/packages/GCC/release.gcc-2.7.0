Starting from this release, ix86-*-linux will mean to configure gcc
for Linux running ELF. To configure gcc for a.out, which should be
only used for compiling kernel and modules, please use i486-linuxaout.
You also need a new set binutils which supports both ELF and a.out.
The Linux binutils 2.5.2l.17 or above must be used for this release. You
can get it from tsx-11 under pub/linux/packages/GCC

CAVEATS:
1. When you put

	extern inline foo (....)
	{
		.......
	}

   in a header file, gcc may not inline foo () even if you include the
   header file and use -O. It is documented in the gcc manual.
2. The ANSI C++ draft changed the for () scope:
 
        for(int i=0; i < 4; i++);
        i = 1;
 
   no longer works by default. Please use -fno-for-scope if you want.


There is an ELF paper, elf.ps.gz, on the ftp sites. You should
read it if you want to write applications/libraries in ELF.

Some ELF related WWW pages:

1. http://www.intac.com/~cully/elf.html
2. http://sable.ox.ac.uk/~jo95004/elf.html

The primary ftp sites for the compiler/C library are tsx-11.mit.edu
under pub/linux/packages/GCC and sunsite.unc.edu under pub/Linux/GCC.

This is the ELF binary release of the gcc 2.7.0 which can be
ftped from prep.ai.mit.edu under pub/gnu among many other GNU ftp
sites. You should use the Linux kernel 1.1.25 or above for the ELF
binaries. The Linux C library 4.7.2 (a.out) or above is required for
generating the a.out binaries and 5.0.9 (ELF) or above is also
required to generating the ELF binaries.

I have moved the g++ header files to /usr/include/g++.

The compatible ELF libg++ is libg++ 2.7.0 which will be on the Linux
gcc ftp sites. No a.out libg++ form now on. I am afraid the stock
libg++ 2.7.0 may not build for Linux without any changes. I will try
to resolve it as soon as possible. Stay tuned.

The file list

1. gcc-2.7.0.bin.tar.gz
   In ELF and generate ELF binaries. gcc, g++, cpp, cc1, cc1plus,
   cc1objc, protoize, unprotoize and version dependent header files.
   Object C, protoize and unprotoize are untested. Also binaries in
   ELF and generate a.out binaries. cpp, cc1, cc1plus, cc1objc and
   version dependent header files. Objective C stuff is untested. To
   install

	cd /
	gzip -dc gcc-2.7.0.bin.tar.gz | tar xvvf -

BTW, please fix the file permissions and ownerships if necessary.

To generate ELF binaries, please do

gcc

or

gcc -b i486-linux


To generate a.out binaries, please do

gcc -b i486-linuxaout
