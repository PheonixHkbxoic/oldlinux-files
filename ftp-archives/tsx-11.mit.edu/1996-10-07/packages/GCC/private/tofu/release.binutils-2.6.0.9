How to remove cross targets.

This is the beta release of binutils 2.6.0.9 for Linux, which is
based on the binutils snapshot, gas-960228. It is a Linux only release.
This release is only intended for an ELF based system. You also
need libc 5.2.18 and gcc 2.7.2 or above.

Please test this as much as you can. I want to release it to public
before Friday, Mar. 1, if everything goes well.

The changes from 2.6.0.8 are:

1. Cross linker/assembler for m68k/ELF and m68k/linuxaout are
   provided. Please configure gcc with

	# configure --prefix=/usr --local-prefix=/usr/local \
		--gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/g++  \
		--with-gnu-ld --with-gnu-as \
		--host=i486-linux --target=m68k-linux

   for m68k/ELF or

	# configure --prefix=/usr --local-prefix=/usr/local \
		--gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/g++  \
		--with-gnu-ld --with-gnu-as \
		--host=i486-linux --target=m68k-linuxaout

   for m68k/a.out

2. Ian provided a better fix for the .bss section size bug.

This is a beta software. Please send your comments to
linux-gcc@vger.rutgers.edu only.

Due to the bug in modules 1.2.8/1.3.57, modules created by ld in this
binutils may not work. Please get the current modules from:

http://www.pi.se/blox/modules/

which should work with this version of binutils.

The major changes from 2.6.0.3 are:

1. One serious bss bug is fixed in this release.

2. The linker will try to check conflicts in shared libraries caused
   by DT_NEEDED. Please check it out.

3. The linker no longer checks /etc/ld.so.cache for shared libraries
   included by DT_NEEDED. Please use -Wl,-rpath-link for any
   directories other than /lib, /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib where a
   shared library may be found. XFree86 needs to be fixed for it. For
   XFree86 3.1.2D or above, please add

	#define BinUtilsVersion         2608

   to your /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config/site.def or xc/cofig/cf/site.def.

4. If the static a.out library, libfoo.a, is compiled with the same
   header files, you can convert libfoo.a into the one compatible with
   ELF. You just need to use the shell script enclosed here to make
   libfoo.a compatible with ELF by removing the leading underscore
   in the global symbol names. After converting libfoo.a, you should
   install it in a directory which will be searched by the ELF linker.
   You can finnaly link static a.out libraries with ELF after the
   conversion.

5. A weak alias bug is fixed for libc 5.3.5.

6. The shared library support from Alan Modra alan@spri.levels.unisa.edu.au
   is finally in. If

	# configure --enable-shared

   is used, libbfd and libopcodes will be built as shared libraries.

7. The -Bsymbolic option is finally working right. Thanks, Ian.

8. I also include the assembler and linker for SunOS and Solaris under
   Sparc. But you have to configure your cross compiler with

	# configure --prefix=/usr --local-prefix=/usr/local \
		--gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/g++  \
		--with-gnu-ld --with-gnu-as \
		--host=i486-linux --target=sparc-sun-sunos4.1

  or

	# configure --prefix=/usr --local-prefix=/usr/local \
		--gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/g++  \
		--with-gnu-ld --with-gnu-as \
		--host=i486-linux --target=sparc-sun-solaris2

   to use the cross assembler and linker binaries without any changes.

9. The .plt section bug fix from pirker@eiunix.tuwien.ac.at.
10. Adding the support for linking ELF .o files against the
    static a.out libraries.
11. Fix the writable text section bug for executables when shared
    libraries are used.

This release contains "encaps" and a modified "objdump" by Ross. They
are used to compile the Linux kernel in ELF.

The primary ftp sites for the compiler/C library are tsx-11.mit.edu
under pub/linux/packages/GCC and sunsite.unc.edu under pub/Linux/GCC.
The beta directory is in private/tofu under the GCC directory.

To install this package, please follow the procedure very closely.
Please backup/save all the files you are instructed to delete and you
should do

	gzip -dc binutils-2.6.0.9.bin.tar.gz | tar tvvf -

to see what is in there.

The binary file is binutils-2.6.0.9.bin.tar.gz. The source code is
binutils-2.6.0.9.tar.gz. A diff against 2.6 is too big to be include.
binutils-2.6.0.8-2.6.0.9.diff.gz is provided for binutils 2.6.0.8.

Please do back up before you remove things.

To install, PLEASE DO

1. su root
2. cd /
3. gzip -dc binutils-2.6.0.9.bin.tar.gz | tar xvvf -

Now you have the new gas/binutils under /usr/bin and
/usr/i486-linuxaout/bin. You have to do

/usr/i486-linuxaout/bin/as

and

/usr/i486-linuxaout/bin/ld -m i386linux

if you want to use a.out as and ld directly.

Thanks.
