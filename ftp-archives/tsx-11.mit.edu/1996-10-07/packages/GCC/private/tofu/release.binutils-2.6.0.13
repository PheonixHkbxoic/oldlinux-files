This is the beta release of binutils 2.6.0.13 for Linux, which is
based on the binutils snapshot, gas-960408. It is a Linux only release.
This release is only intended for an ELF based system. You also
need libc 5.3.9 and gcc 2.7.2 or above.

Some changes from 2.6.0.12 are:

1. Now the linker will consult /etc/ld.so.cache again for shared
   libraries included by DT_NEEDED. -Wl,-rpath-link is no longer
   needed if you compile on Linux for Linux.
2. The objdump core dump bug is fixe.

I also include the cross assembler and cross linker binaries for
SunOS and Solaris under Sparc, m68k/ELF and m68k/linuxaout as well
as alpha running Linux. But you have to configure your cross
compiler with

	# configure --prefix=/usr --local-prefix=/usr/local \
		--gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/g++  \
		--with-gnu-ld --with-gnu-as \
		--host=i486-linux --target=sparc-sun-sunos4.1

for Sparc/SunOS, or

	# configure --prefix=/usr --local-prefix=/usr/local \
		--gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/g++  \
		--with-gnu-ld --with-gnu-as \
		--host=i486-linux --target=sparc-sun-solaris2

for Sparc/Solaris, or

	# configure --prefix=/usr --local-prefix=/usr/local \
		--gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/g++  \
		--with-gnu-ld --with-gnu-as \
		--host=i486-linux --target=m68k-linux

for m68k/ELF, or

	# configure --prefix=/usr --local-prefix=/usr/local \
		--gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/g++  \
		--with-gnu-ld --with-gnu-as \
		--host=i486-linux --target=m68k-linuxaout

for m68k/a.out, or

	# configure --prefix=/usr --local-prefix=/usr/local \
		--gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/g++  \
		--with-gnu-ld --with-gnu-as \
		--host=i486-linux --target=alpha-linux

for alpha/Linux to use the cross assembler and linker binaries
without any changes.

This release contains "encaps" and a modified "objdump" by Ross. They
are used to compile the Linux kernel in ELF.

The primary ftp sites for the compiler/C library are tsx-11.mit.edu
under pub/linux/packages/GCC and sunsite.unc.edu under pub/Linux/GCC.
The beta directory is in private/tofu under the GCC directory.

To install this package, please follow the procedure very closely.
Please backup/save all the files you are instructed to delete and you
should do

	gzip -dc binutils-2.6.0.13.bin.tar.gz | tar tvvf -

to see what is in there.

The binary file is binutils-2.6.0.13.bin.tar.gz. The source code is
binutils-2.6.0.13.tar.gz. A diff against 2.6 is too big to be
included. binutils-2.6.0.12-2.6.0.13.diff.gz is provided for binutils
2.6.0.12.

Please do back up before you remove things.

To install, PLEASE DO

1. su root
2. cd /
3. gzip -dc binutils-2.6.0.13.bin.tar.gz | tar xvvf -

Now you have the new gas/binutils under /usr/bin and
/usr/i486-linuxaout/bin. You have to do

/usr/i486-linuxaout/bin/as

and

/usr/i486-linuxaout/bin/ld -m i386linux

if you want to use a.out as and ld directly.

If you don't need the cross assemblers/linkers for m68k-linux,
m68k-linuxaout, sparc-sun-solaris2, sparc-sun-sunos4.1 nor alpha-linux,
please do

1. su root
2. cd /usr
3. rm -rf m68k-linux m68k-linuxaout sparc-sun-solaris2 sparc-sun-sunos4.1 alpha-linux


Thanks.
