The Ada support in the gcc driver binary is added and the Fortran
support is removed by request.

NOTES:

This is a beta software for Linux only. Please send your comments and
bug reports to hjl@gnu.ai.mit.edu, amylaar@meolyon.hanse.de and
linux-gcc@vger.rutgers.edu only. Please don't send them to any normal
gcc mailing lists/news groups.

This is gcc 2.7.2.l.3.  The only difference from 2.7.2.l.2 is some
Fortran patches are added. A patch against 2.7.2.l.2 is provided
as gcc-2.7.2.l.2-2.7.2.l.3.diff.gz.

CHANGES:
1. libgcc.a is compiled with -fPIC.
2. crtbegin.o, crtbeginS.o, crtend.o and crtendS.o are
   included.
3. gcc -shared will include -lgcc. Since libgcc.a is compiled with
   -fPIC, it should be ok.
4. gcc -profile is added, which tells gcc to link with -lc_p instead
   of -lc.
5. Update the gcc driver.
6. A patch to fix a typo in GCC 2.7.x's expr.c which causes GCC to
   silently generate incorrect code for Aladdin Ghostscript.

This release is UNTESTED and may contain new bugs. Please try it on as
many packages as you can. I have tested it on XFree86 3.1.2Db, libc
5.3.5, binutils 2.6.0.10, gdb 960308 and libg++ 2.7.1.4.

BUGS:
1. There are some x86 bugs in this release.

typedef unsigned short u_short;

---foo.c--
static int foo( u_short *bx, u_short *cx, u_short *dx )
{
   u_short error;

   __asm__ __volatile__( \
         "nop\n\t" \
         : "=a" (error), "=b" (*bx), "=c" (*cx), "=d" (*dx) \
         : "0" (0x530a), "1" (1), "2" (2), "3" (3) \
         : "ax", "bx", "cx", "dx", "si", "di", "bp", "memory");
   return 0;
}

int main( void )
{
   u_short bx, cx, dx;

   bx = cx = dx = -1;
   foo( &bx, &cx, &dx );
   printf ("0x%x, 0x%x, 0x%x\n", bx, cx, dx);
}
----foo.c--

The correct output should be

# gcc -O3 foo.c 
# a.out
0x1, 0x2, 0x3

This program may be miscompiled with -O0, -O1 and -O2. -O3 seems ok.

There is an ELF paper, elf.ps.gz, on the ftp sites. You should
read it if you want to write applications/libraries in ELF.

This is the Linux only release of gcc 2.7.2.l.3. It is based on the
gcc 2.7.2 release plus the gcc-2.7.2-2.7.2.0.l.diff.gz patch provided
by J"orn Rennecke (amylaar@meolyon.hanse.de). The full source code is
gcc-2.7.2.l.3.tar.gz.

This Linux only gcc release fixed most of known bugs in gcc 2.7.2,
including the strength-reduce bug. This release is intended only for
Linux, especially Intel x86. Please DON'T send any bug reports to the
normal gcc mailing list/news groups. All the bug reports should
be directed to hjl@gnu.ai.mit.edu, amylaar@meolyon.hanse.de and
linux-gcc@vger.rutgers.edu only.

I have moved the g++ header files to /usr/include/g++.

The file list

1. gcc-2.7.2.l.3.bin.tar.gz
   In ELF and generate ELF binaries. gcc, g++, cpp, cc1, cc1plus,
   cc1objc, protoize, unprotoize and version dependent header files.
   Object C, protoize and unprotoize are untested. Also binaries in
   ELF and generate a.out binaries. cpp, cc1, cc1plus, cc1objc and
   version dependent header files. Objective C stuff is untested. To
   install

	gzip -dc gcc-2.7.2.l.3.bin.tar.gz | tar xvvf -

BTW, please fix the file permissions and ownerships if necessary.

To generate ELF binaries, please do

gcc

or

gcc -b i486-linux


To generate a.out binaries, please do

gcc -b i486-linuxaout

To use libg.a for debugging instead of libc.so/libc.a, please use
-ggdb. To use libc_p.a for profiling instead of libc.so/libc.a,
please use -profile.
