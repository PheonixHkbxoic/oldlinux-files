This is the public release of binutils 2.7.0.3 for Linux, which is
based on binutils 2.7. You also need libc 5.4.7 and gcc 2.7.2 or
above to use the precompiled binaries.

The only changes from binutils 2.7 are:

1. The ELF hash table size has been increased. It is said
   to improve the run-time load speed of ELF binaries
   with many shared libraries.
2. encaps and objdump changes are added for linux kernels. They
   may not be necessary for newer kernels. But they are needed
   for older ones.
3. A weak/global change is made to work around a gcc bug.

I also include the cross assembler and cross linker binaries for
SunOS and Solaris under Sparc, m68k/ELF and m68k/linuxaout.
To use the cross assembler and linker binaries without any changes,
you have to configure your cross compiler with

	a. Sparc/SunOS:

	# configure --prefix=/usr --local-prefix=/usr/local \
		--gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/g++  \
		--with-gnu-ld --with-gnu-as \
		--host=i486-linux --target=sparc-sun-sunos4.1

	b. Sparc/Solaris:

	# configure --prefix=/usr --local-prefix=/usr/local \
		--gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/g++  \
		--with-gnu-ld --with-gnu-as \
		--host=i486-linux --target=sparc-sun-solaris2

	c. m68k/ELF:

	# configure --prefix=/usr --local-prefix=/usr/local \
		--gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/g++  \
		--with-gnu-ld --with-gnu-as \
		--host=i486-linux --target=m68k-linux

	d. m68k/a.out:

	# configure --prefix=/usr --local-prefix=/usr/local \
		--gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/g++  \
		--with-gnu-ld --with-gnu-as \
		--host=i486-linux --target=m68k-linuxaout

This release contains "encaps" and a modified "objdump" by Ross. They
are used to compile the Linux kernel in ELF.

The primary ftp sites for the compiler/C library are tsx-11.mit.edu
under pub/linux/packages/GCC and sunsite.unc.edu under pub/Linux/GCC.

To install this package, please follow the procedure very closely.
Please backup/save all the files you are instructed to delete and you
should do

	gzip -dc binutils-2.7.0.3.bin.tar.gz | tar tvvf -

to see what is in there.

The binary file is binutils-2.7.0.3.bin.tar.gz. The source code is
binutils-2.7.0.3.tar.gz. binutils-2.7-2.7.0.3.diff.gz is provided
for binutils 2.7.0.3.

Please do back up before you remove things.

To install, PLEASE DO

1. su root
2. cd /
3. gzip -dc binutils-2.7.0.3.bin.tar.gz | tar xvvf -

Now you have the new gas/binutils under /usr/bin and
/usr/i486-linuxaout/bin. You have to do

/usr/i486-linuxaout/bin/as

and

/usr/i486-linuxaout/bin/ld -m i386linux

if you want to use a.out as and ld directly.

If you don't need the cross assemblers/linkers for m68k-linux,
m68k-linuxaout, sparc-sun-solaris2 nor sparc-sun-sunos4.1, please
do

1. su root
2. cd /usr
3. rm -rf m68k-linux m68k-linuxaout sparc-sun-solaris2 sparc-sun-sunos4.1


Thanks.
