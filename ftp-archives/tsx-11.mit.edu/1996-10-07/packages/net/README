Welcome to the sunacm ftp archive.

This service is provided by the Swansea University ACM Student Chapter
with assistance from members of SUCS, the Computer Society at Swansea.

The sunacm ftp daemon will automatically tar and compress a directory
if you get it with the suffix ".tar.Z".

Files are grouped in one of three places:
  pub/acm  - documents from ACM
  pub/sucs - contributions from the Computer Society
  pub/misc - miscellaneous; anything else

There are no writable directories.

Everything ending '.z' is compressed with gzip, the FSF replacement for 
compress. This is a faster and more importantly more effective compression
tool. Gzip is available from prep.ai.mit.edu, and all other good FSF source
archives. Binaries and maintenance agreements for some machines are
available in the US from Cygnus.
