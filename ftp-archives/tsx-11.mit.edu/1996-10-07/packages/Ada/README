Distributed Systems Annex
    July 14, 1996 18:30 EDT
    Annoucing the first public release of DSA, the Ada 95 Distributed Systems
    Annex implementation for GNAT.  DSA is an environment for developing
    distributed applications based on Annex E of the Ada 95 Reference Manual.
    This environment comprises:

      - a complete PCS (Partition Communication System)
      - a compiler for a simple partition description language
      - utilities to build and start distributed applications

   This first release works with GNAT 3.05 on Sparc/Solaris and PC/Linux. This
   release also works on Sparc/SunOS although less efficiently. The release can
   be found in the "dsa" directory.

   Versions for DEC/Digital Unix, HP/HP-UX, Windows NT and SGI/Irix will be
   available in the future.

gnat 3.05 is now available

Version 3.05 release:
   The binary distribution is now available for the following configurations:
      alpha-dec-osf3.2 (includes tasking)

powermac (for machten) binary installation:
    July 9, 1996  01:30 EDT
    The binary distribution for powermac running machten is now available
    in the powermac directory. Instructions for installing are given in the
    README files contained in that directory.

i386-netbsd1.1 binary installation:
    June 18, 1996 23:30 EDT
    The binary distribution for netbsd1.1 is now available. The following two
    files make up the distribution: gnat-3.05-i386-unknown-netbsd1.1.README and
    gnat-3.05-i386-unknown-netbsd1.1.tar.gz.

nextstep for x86 binary installation:
    July 7, 1996 23:30 EDT
    The binary distribution for nexstep3 on the x86 is now available as the
    file gnat-3.05-i386-next-nextstep3-bin.tar.gz

Sparc Solaris 2.4 binary installation:
    June 11, 1996 23:00 EDT
    The binary distribution for Sparc Solaris 2.4 is now available in
    the file gnat-3.05-sparc-sun-solaris2.4-bin.tar.gz. 

Sun OS binary installation:
    June 11, 1996 23:00 EDT
    The binary distribution for Sparc SunOS 4.1.3 is now available in the file
    gnat-3.05-sparc-sun-sunos.4.1.3-bin.tar.gz. 
    The following warning message during installation (doconfig option 3)
    should be ignored. 
       ranlib: warning: libgthreads.a(io.o): no symbol table

Alpha binary installation:
    June 11, 1996 23:00 EDT
    The binary distribution for Alpha OSF3.2 is now available in the file
    gnat-3.05-alpha-dec-osf3.2-bin.tar.gz. This includes a preliminary
    version of tasking.

    Note: When installed on top of an existing directory, tar may give peculiar
    error messages so it is advisable to delete the old directory first.

SGI Irix 5.3 binary installation:
    June 11, 1996 23:00 EDT
    The binary distribution for SGI Irix 5.3 is now available in the file
    gnat-3.05-mips-sgi-irix5.3-bin.tar.gz. 

RS6000 binary installation:
    June 11, 1996 23:00 EDT
    The binary distribution for RS6000 AIX 3.2 is now available in the file
    gnat-3.05-rs6000-ibm-aix3.2-bin.tar.gz.

DOS binary installation:
    June 12, 1996 15:00 EDT
    The binary distribution for DOS is now available. It now includes
    tasking and a fully functioning gnatmake. The DOS version uses the
    latest version of DJGPP (version 2.0) which handles virtual memory
    much more efficiently. Therefore the new version of DJGPP needs to be
    installed for GNAT 3.05. The file djgpp-2.00-dos-bin.zip contains what
    is required from the new DJGPP release. The following four additional
    files make up the distribution: gnat-3.05-dos-bin-disk[1234].zip.
    The DOS version is now packaged inside the ez2load directory. It may
    be installed using the ez2load installer which is simply to use or by
    following the directions given below under "UNPACKING DOS".

    The "ez2load" directory currently contains a nice development environment
    for GNAT under DOS including AdaCAPS and a windows IDE is available. The
    Lovelace Ada 95 tutuorial is also located there.

    Depending on the OS you are running under (NT, W95, DOS, or OS/2) and
    the version of unzip you are using, LIBGTHREADS.A might come out as
    LIBGTH~1.A or LIBGTHRE.A in the \DJGPP\LIB directory.  If this happens,
    simply rename it to LIBGTHREADS.A or LIBGTHRE.A (depending on whether or
    not your OS supports long file names).

OS/2 binary installation:
    June 12, 1996 18:00 EDT
    The binary distribution of GNAT 3.05 for OS/2 is now available. Please
    note that GNAT OS/2 now uses five diskettes rather than four; three for
    GNAT and two for EMX.  Please read the unpacking instructions given below
    as well as the READ.ME and README.EMX files in the emx\gnat directory once
    the files are unpacked.

    Previous OS/2 users of GNAT are also advised to briefly check the
    unpacking instructions given below for any new details.


Linux (ELF) binary installation:
    June 17, 1996 23:00 EDT
    The installation directions mention to get package
    binutils-2.6.0.2.bin.tar.gz from either sunite or tsx-11. Unfortunately
    these are no longer available at these sites so unless you already have
    these available it is necessary to retrieve from sunsite or tsx-11
    the following pair instead: binutils-2.6.0.14.bin.tar.gz and
    libc-5.3.12.bin.tar.gz. If you get the later binutils (2.6.0.14)
    you must also get the later libc (5.3.12) as the newer binutils will
    not work properly with the old version of libc.
 
    June 11, 1996 23:00 EDT
    The GNAT 3.05 binary distribution for Linux elf format is now available
    in the file gnat-3.05-i486-linux-elf-bin.tar.gz. Its accompanying README is
    now included in the distribution along with an installation script.

gnat 3.04 is now available

Version 3.04 release:
   The binary distribution is now available for the following configurations:
      mac68k (for machten)
      Windows 95 and Windows NT for the Intel x86.

Distribution Update News: (version 3.04)
    All binaries are built on top of GCC 2.7.2.

Source Distribution Update News (Version 3.04):
    GNAT 3.04 must be built on top of GCC 2.7.2

mac68k (for machten) binary installation:
    July 9, 1996  01:30 EDT
    The binary distribution for mac68k running machten is now available
    in the mac68k directory. Instructions for installing are given in the
    README files contained in that directory.

Windows 95/Windows NT binary installation:
    June 12, 1996 15:00 EDT
    The GNAT 3.04a1 binary distribution for Windows'95 and Windows NT (3.5 or
    above) on the PC is now available in the file setup_gnat3041a_win95.exe.gz.
    It supports tasking.  It contains all the libraries you need to do Ada
    programming, but the libraries for direct calls to the Win32 API are
    available separately from LabTek (labtek@cs.yale.edu). See instructions
    below on unpacking the Windows 95/Windows NT version. This is the Labtek
    port of GNAT.

General Installation notes for Unix installations:
    Note to users trying to install using option 1 only:
    Option 1 is a bit trickier now trying to graft GNAT onto GCC version 2.7.2.
    Users trying to install with option 1, that it trying to install GNAT on
    top of their existing GCC installation, on a system running SunOS 4.1
    rather than 4.1.3 should make a link from sparc-sun-sunos4.1.3 to
    sparc-sun-sunos4.1 in their gcc-lib directory. If trying to install on
    top of a system running gcc 2.7.0 rather than 2.7.2 make a link running
    from 2.7.0 to 2.7.2 followed by the doinstall.

Version 3.03 release:
Distribution Update News: (version 3.03)
    All binaries are built on top of GCC 2.7.2.

Source Distribution Update News (Version 3.03):
    GNAT 3.03 should be built on top of GCC 2.7.2

The binary distribution is now available for the following configurations:
    i386-sun-solaris2.4 (for x86)
    hppa

HP PA binary installation:
    April 23, 1996 15:00 EDT
    The file gnat-3.03-hppa-bin.tar.gz representing the binary distribution
    for the HP PA-RISC architecture is now available.

Solaris x86 binary installation:
    Jan 24, 1996 13:40 EST
    The GNAT 3.03 binary distribution for Solaris x86 is now available. The
    following two files make up the distribution:
    gnat-3.03-i386-unknown-solaris2.4-bin.tar.gz
    gnat-3.03-i386-unknown-solaris2.4-readme

Version 3.01 release:
   The binary distribution is now available for the following configurations:
      linux (a.out)
      mips-dec-ultrix4.3

Linux (a.out) binary installation:
    Jan 5, 1996 00:30 EST
    The GNAT 3.01 binary distribution for Linux (a.out) is now available.
    The a.out version is available in the file gnat-3.01-linuxaout.tar.gz
    with an accompanying README in gnat-3.01-linuxaout.README.

Decstation Ultrix binary installation:
    Dec 17, 1995 19:30 EST
    The binary distribution for Decstation Ultrix 4.3 is now available in the
    file gnat-3.01-mips-dec-ultrix4.3-bin.tar.gz.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Old source and binaries of GNAT have been moved to pub/gnat/private/old
on cs.nyu.edu in order not to clutter up the main pub/gnat directory and
not to be picked up by mirror sites. If for some reason you need to
retrieve any of these old versions, that is where they can be found.

OS/2 PM bindings:
    July 7, 1996 13:00 EDT
    The public release of the OS/2 bindings are now available in the
    contrib/os2/bindings subdirectory. This directory contains os2bnd04.zip
    and a README.

Forest (Posix binding) bindings;
    June 12, 1996 18:00 EDT
    The public release of Forest version 1.4 is now available in the
    contrib/forest subdirectory.

The 5.95 version of the reference manual for Ada95 is available under the
directory rm9x-5.95.

  Since gnat 2.07 uses gcc version 2.7.0 the environment variables that are set
  as part of the binary installation need to reference 2.7.0 rather than 2.6.3
  which was used previously. So for those using the doconfig script with option
  3 make sure that the file env-vals created by the script is placed in your
  .cshrc and that it replaces any old one (with 2.6.3 references) that was
  there from a previous installation. The -gnatv option will indicate to you
  which version of gnat you are running.

CONTENTS::

The contents of the pub/gnat directory are:

This README file.

The file "features" which lists the language features that are implemented in 
the lastest version of GNAT is located both in the pub/gnat directory and as 
part of each distribution.  It is updated periodically to reflect new features
put into the latest release.

The subdirectory "docs" contains various documents about GNAT.
The file "unz50x32.exe" is used for unpacking OS/2 zip files (more below).
The file "unz511x.exe" is used for unpacking DOS zip files (more below).

There are source and binary distributions both for sparc machines running
SunOs 4.1 (these distribution files end in ".gz") and for OS/2 (these
distribution files end in ".zip").  There are also binary distributions
for other architectures/operating systems, including for example DOS and
most recently Windows 95.

Since the front end of GNAT is written in Ada, you need a running version
of GNAT in order to build GNAT from the sources.  Once you have GNAT
running on your system, most releases can be built from previous ones.
To get started initially (and when there are boostrap problems that will
be documented here) you need to install GNAT from a binary distribution.
We anticipate that many people will never have an interest in building
GNAT, and will therefore simply pick up new binary distributions.

Intructions for installing and running GNAT are in each distribution.  The
source distributions also contain instructions for building GNAT.

Make sure that you transfer with ftp in binary mode.

===============================================================================

UNPACKING UNIX DISTRIBUTIONS::

The Unix (specifically sparc) distributions need to be uncompressed with
'gunzip' (or equivalently 'gzip -d'), and then unpacked with tar.

 So the necessary commands would be something like the following for
 unpacking version GNAT 3.05 for the sparc solaris 2.4 version:

 gunzip gnat-3.05-sparc-sun-solaris2.4-bin.tar.gz
 tar xf gnat-3.05-sparc-sun-solaris2.4-bin.tar

Here is the scoop on gunzip:

  Because the unix `compress' utility is patented (by two separate patents,
  in fact), we cannot use it; it's not free software.

  Therefore, the GNU Project has chosen a new compression utility, `gzip',
  which is free of any known software patents and which tends to compress
  better anyway.  All compressed files in the GNU anonymous FTP area
  (prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu) have been converted to the new format.  Files
  compressed with this new compression program end in `.gz' (as opposed to
  `compress'-compressed files, which end in `.Z').

  Gzip can uncompress `compress'-compressed files and `pack' files
  (which end in `.z').  This is possible because the various
  decompression algorithms are not patented---only compression is.

  The gzip program is available from any GNU mirror site in shar, tar, or
  gzipped tar format (for those who already have a prior version of gzip and
  want faster data transmission).  It works on virtually every Unix system,
  MSDOS, OS/2, and VMS.

After doing this, check in the newly created GNAT distribution directory for
further installation instructions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UNPACKING Windows 95 / Windows NT DISTRIBUTIONS::

To install, use binary mode ftp and retrieve setup_gnat304a_win95.exe.gz and
gzip.exe, then run "win95-gzip.exe" on it to decompress. Finally run the setup
program which will guide you through the process.

Note: This Windows 95/ Windows NT distribution of the GNAT Ada compiler for the
Intel architecture is maintained by LabTek Corporation. For questions about the
Win95/Winnt version send mail to labtek@cs.yale.edu.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UNPACKING OS/2 DISTRIBUTIONS::

The executables for the OS/2 version of GNAT are split into 5 files, each of
which can fit on one 3.5-inch high-density diskette. Although it is possible to
install GNAT on a FAT partition, such an installation will be somewhat
limiting due to the restriction of 8 character filenames. But it is possible
to run GNAT in this mode using the -gnatk8 option. Therefore, we recommend to
install GNAT on an HPFS partition.

If you don't have the unzip program, you can download the file unz50x32.exe,
run it in an empty directory, and copy the file unzip.exe to a directory
listed in your PATH environment variable.  Please note that PKUNZIP will NOT
work.)

The executables for the OS/2 version of GNAT are contained in 5 zip files.
They occupy about 13 megabytes when unzipped.  

The contents of each zip file are as follows (xx is the minor revision#):

#1 gnat-3.xx-os2-bin-disk1.zip:
#2 gnat-3.xx-os2-bin-disk2.zip:
#3 gnat-3.xx-os2-bin-disk3.zip:
 The GNAT portion of the GNU compiler and utilities. GNAT runtime library.
 Documentation and examples.  README.OS2.

#4 emx09b-gnat-os2-bin-disk1.zip:
#5 emx09b-gnat-os2-bin-disk2.zip: Minimal EMX installation including the
 GNU gcc driver, the C portion of the GNU compiler, assembler, linker,
 debugger, utilities, "C" runtime library, C include files, necessary DLLs
 and documentation.

Important note for previous users of GNAT on EMX.
-------------------------------------------------
Since you have already installed the EMX09a zip files while installing the
previous GNAT release you need to remove the EMX subdirectory in order to
prevent conflicts between EMX09A files and new EMX09b files that will be
created during installation of GNAT 3.05.

Once this is done just follow the regular instruction starting giving below
in the paragraph starting with "To begin".

Release 3.05 is based on EMX 9b (with fix01) which was based on GCC 2.7.2.

To begin the installation copy the .zip files to the root of the partition
on which you wish to install GNAT. Unzip them there using unzip.exe.

Example (replace xx with the current GNAT minor version):

>c:
>cd \
>copy gnat-3.xx-os2-bin-disk1.zip .
>copy gnat-3.xx-os2-bin-disk2.zip .
>copy gnat-3.xx-os2-bin-disk3.zip .
>copy emx09b-gnat-os2-bin-disk1.zip .
>copy emx09b-gnat-os2-bin-disk2.zip .
>unzip gnat-3.xx-os2-bin-disk1.zip .
>unzip gnat-3.xx-os2-bin-disk2.zip .
>unzip gnat-3.xx-os2-bin-disk3.zip .
>unzip emx09b-gnat-os2-bin-disk1.zip .
>unzip emx09b-gnat-os2-bin-disk2.zip .

Once you've done the above, read and follow the directions in given
in \EMX\GNAT\READ.ME to complete the installation.

The file \EMX\GNAT\README.EMX (same as \EMX\README.EMX) explains about
the minimal EMX system subset that is being distributed through the files
emx09b-gnat-os2-bin-disk1.zip and emx09b-gnat-os2-bin-disk2.zip for support
of GNAT.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
UNPACKING DOS DISTRIBUTIONS::

These instructions pertain to GNAT 3.04 and later.

The file "unz511x.exe" is used for unpacking DOS zip files and is available
in the ftp directory.  You can also use the popular pkunzip.exe program if 
you already have it.

Unz511x.exe is a self extracting archive.  To use it you should create
an empty, temporary directory, copy unz511x.exe into that directory and 
run it.  (The reason for doing this is that it unzips itself and creates 
a number of auxiliary files which would clutter up an existing directory.)

Once you have it unzipped, you should copy the unzip.exe executable
to a directory listed in your PATH environment variable so that is can be
run from the GNAT installation directory.


The executables for the DOS version of GNAT are contained in 5 files.  They 
occupy about 10 megabytes when unzipped.  

The contents of each zip file are as follows (where "xx" is the minor
version number):

#1 GNAT-3.xx-DOS-BIN-DISK1.ZIP:
#2 GNAT-3.xx-DOS-BIN-DISK2.ZIP:
#3 GNAT-3.xx-DOS-BIN-DISK3.ZIP:
#4 GNAT-3.xx-DOS-BIN-DISK4.ZIP:  GNAT and Gnu "C" compilers and utilities.  
 GNAT runtime library. Documentation and examples.  README.DOS.

#5 DJGPP-2.00-DOS-BIN.ZIP: Minimal DJGPP installation including the go32
 memory extender, 387 emulator, assembler, utilities, "C" runtime library and
 documentation.

File #5 is required only if you don't already have the latest DJGPP release
(version 2.0) installed .


To begin the installation, create a directory called DJGPP on a drive
with sufficient disk space.  Copy the .zip files to this directory and unzip
them using unzip.exe or a compatible program.  The .zip files contain a
complete directory tree, so if you use pkunzip be sure to include the -d 
switch.

Example:

>MKDIR C:\DJGPP
>COPY GNAT-3.xx-DOS-BIN-DISK1.ZIP C:\DJGPP
>COPY GNAT-3.xx-DOS-BIN-DISK2.ZIP C:\DJGPP
>COPY GNAT-3.xx-DOS-BIN-DISK3.ZIP C:\DJGPP
>COPY GNAT-3.xx-DOS-BIN-DISK4.ZIP C:\DJGPP
>COPY DJGPP-2.00-DOS-BIN.ZIP C:\DJGPP
>C:
>CD \DJGPP
>UNZIP GNAT-3.xx-DOS-BIN-DISK1.ZIP
>UNZIP GNAT-3.xx-DOS-BIN-DISK2.ZIP
>UNZIP GNAT-3.xx-DOS-BIN-DISK3.ZIP
>UNZIP GNAT-3.xx-DOS-BIN-DISK4.ZIP
>UNZIP DJGPP-2.00-DOS-BIN.ZIP
or
>PKUNZIP -D GNAT-3.xx-DOS-BIN-DISK1.ZIP
>PKUNZIP -D GNAT-3.xx-DOS-BIN-DISK2.ZIP

Once you've done the above, read and follow the directions in 
C:\DJGPP\README.DOS to complete the installation.  Be sure to also read the
DJGPP readme files: README.1ST and README.DJ.

UNPACKING THE GNAT SOURCES
--------------------------
The GNAT sources are distributed in two formats, one using gzip and the
other using zip. The gzip format appears as gnat-3.xx-src.tar.gz (where xx
is the minor release number). To unpack just use gunzip and then tar to
extract. The zip format appears as three zip files: gnat-3.xx-src-disk1.zip,
gnat-3.xx-src-disk2.zip and gnat-3.xx-src-disk3.zip. To see which unzip
utility to use in unpacking these two zip files, see the instructions given
in the sections above called UNPACKING DOS DISTRIBUTIONS or
UNPACKING OS/2 DISTRIBUTIONS whichever is appropriate.
