This is the TheDraw v4.63. This will enable you to create ansi screens very
easily. This is a dos program so it must be run either under Sco Merge or
DosEmu for Linux. It is very simple once you get the hang of it. It will
be worth your time to learn how to use it, trust me :)

There are probably a lot of fancier ansi packages out there, but I think
TheDraw is one of the best, the rest have too many features, which you
don't need!
