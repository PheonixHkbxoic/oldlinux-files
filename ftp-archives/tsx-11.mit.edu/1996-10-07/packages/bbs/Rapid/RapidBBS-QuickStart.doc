Please note this is the Binary Distribution of RapidBBS

This information text file is for you to get the bbs working quick and easy.

1) Create a file in /etc/default called "rapid"
   In this file put the following line:
   PATH=/u/rapid   (Or whatever file directory you selected)
2) Put a enviroment variable in /etc/profile called RAPID
   ie) RAPID=/u/rapid;export RAPID
3) Select a file directory to store your BBS in (default is /u/rapid), I would
   recommend this directory structure, as little changing is needed.
4) Run the rpconfig in /u/rapid/bin
   Little changing is needed here, maybe the sysop name and bbsname and 
   paths if you chose a different path from /u/rapid
5) run /u/rapid/bin/rapid, log in as your name

Please note I have tar'ed all the files in separate files, which you
are going to have to untar in there directories. I have done this, because
I have found people overwriting there setup when untar'ing. New people
who are setting up the BBS for the first time, all you have to do is go
into each directory and untar the file and then delete the tar file.
