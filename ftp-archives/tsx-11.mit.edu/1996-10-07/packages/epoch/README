 I've uploaded Epoch 4.1 (L1) to tsx-11 (/incoming) and reggae.oit.unc.edu
(..../X11/Incoming). The program is linked dynamically with the shared
libs of gcc2.2.2 and X v1.1. I was going to wait until gcc2.2.2d is
released since it is going to be released soon (I think), but people
asked for it right now. I'm planning to upload a new version (L2) when
gcc2.2.2d is released. The following is a quote from the FAQ about Epoch
and then the IAFA info. 

--------- Quote from the Epoch FAQ ---------

A-1: What is Epoch?
  
  Epoch is GNU Emacs on steroids: an adaptation of GNU Emacs with lots
  of additional support for features made possible by the X11 windowing
  system.  These features include multiple editing windows, arbitrary
  colors and fonts (fixed-width and proportional), selectable zones per
  buffer with arbitrary display styles (font, color, underline, stipple,
  pixmap), an optional separate minibuffer window, improved keyboard and
  mouse handling, full 8-bit character set support, and more.
  
  Epoch, like GNU Emacs, is very customizable; much of this FAQ
  describes ways to customize Epoch for specific purposes.
