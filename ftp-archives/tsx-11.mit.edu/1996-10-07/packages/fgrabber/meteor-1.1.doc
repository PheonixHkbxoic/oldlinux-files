  This is a port and partial rewrite of the FreeBSD Matrox Meteor
FrameGrabber Driver, written by Jim Lowe and Mark Tinguely. The port
was done by Jim Bray. I have used Matt Welsh's bigphysarea mechanism
to substitute for the BSD vm_page_alloc_contig().

  It requires a fairly recent kernel (at least 1.3-series). It is
known to work with 1.3.72 and later. I made it with 1.3.95. There is a
list, meteor-users@rwii.com, for discusssion. It is managed by
majordomo; send mail to majordomo@rwii.com with no content if you need
instructions. The command to join would be "subscribe meteor-list" in
the message body. 
 
 Older and possibly newer versions can be found on ftp.rwii.com
in /pub/linux/system/Meteor, which is the driver's home site.

  This is version 1.1. It appears to be stable and usable on 
most hardware.

Please see the README, comments and so forth for more information.

 Enjoy.
