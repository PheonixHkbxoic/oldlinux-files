------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From: buck@wic.waterloo.shl.com (Charlie Krasic)
Laptop Make and Model: NEC Ultralite Versa 33C
CPU speed, type, upgradeable to: 33MHz 486SL, E series has 50MHz 
Disk size, type, upgradeable to: 340M removable (upgrade depends on what is available)
RAM  size, type, upgradeable to: 20M (20M is the max on-board)
Screen size, type: 9.5" active matrix colour
Max battery life while running linux: 3.5-5hrs (swapping floppy for 2nd battery)
	depending on type of activity.
Weight with battery: not sure -- 9lbs?
PCMCIA number of slot, type, bridge chip: 2 type II, or 1 type III, IBM bridge chip.
Mouse, Track Ball (location), ..etc.: Ballpoint mouse :(
Docking capability: Docking station or port replicator.  I have a docking station
  with an ethernet card (SMC Ultra 16), and an external video card (ET4000).  I use
  the ET4000 to run 1024x768 under X.
Power conservation: The usual..also has a save system image to disk program I do
  not use.
Misc neat stuff:  Biggy is the ability to use a 2nd batter instead of the floppy
 drive.  Removable hard disk is cool, I have DOS & QNX on one (for work), and Linux
 on the other.  Bad point:  video chipset not supported by XFree, so I can only
 use the generic VGA server on the LCD..this is limited to 16 colours and is very 
 slow.  On the upside, it does support an external card when docked so X runs
 very nicely when docked.  Coming soon.. a screen which supports touch and pen!
 Also, I have a Megahertz XJ144 pcmcia modem.  I have CSLIP working nicely ;).
Linux Version: Slackware 1.1.2 with various upgrades including 1.0 kernel.
 I use 332M for Linux and 8M for swap.

X386 (color, gray) monitor specs: 256 gray levels. Had to use the
	Xfree 1.3 server (everything else is Xfree2.0) because the
p	Xfree 2.0 had a bug in its AVGA support.

	the expansion base, since there is only one place where I have
	net access.

Screen size, type: 
 640x480 VGA 16-shade greyscale.  Don't know the exact size.
 Approximately 7.8" x 4.5".  NOTE: DESPITE THE RESOLUTION, THE ASPECT
 RATIO IS *NOT* 4:3, (THE PIXELS AREN'T SQUARE) GIVING THE SCREEN A
 "SQUASHED" LOOK. This isn't a problem for me, but it could bother the
 h*ll out of other people.

 corner.  Buttons on front face. Emulates a PS/2 mouse.
Docking capability:None.
Power conservation:
 All power management works flawlessly with Linux. The system has no "off"
 switch: it has a suspend/resume switch.  As such, I can hit a button and
 be popped into my X session.
Misc neat stuff: It's light and very quick.
Linux Version: 
 Linux v1.1.0 with pcsndrv-0.6, and noblink-1.0 patches installed.
X386 (color, gray) monitor specs: XFree86 v2.1 running the 16-color X server.
Networking (dlink/pcmcia modules):
 Currently running SLIP at 19,200 out the standard RS-232 port (which has a
 16450 chip).  DLink adapter worked well under 0.99.14. Haven't tried it under
 1.1.0.
 Will purchase both ethernet and a modem when PCMCIA drivers are completed.

Comments: i started with a mono dx2/66 tristar laptop. it didnt have a
 power management unit at all. so suddenly, when i am in the middle of
 something, the unit would just run out of power and die. there was no
 way to upgrade the bios to any apm compatible unit.  finally out of
 sheer desperation, i returned it and have been using the winbook. its
 a nice unit, though i find it a bit sluggish compared with the dx266
 unit.

  not.  Arrggh!)

		slow IDE HD (I was doing video work, and I missed the nice
		Sparc 5s they have in the labs :).

From: jc@marben.es
Laptop Make and Model: SDK 4000 III Extended version (From Taiwan). 
CPU speed, type, upgradeable to: 66Mhz, 486DX2, 486DX4 at 100Mhz
Disk size, type, upgradeable to: 530MB, 2.5" IDE (a Toshiba), 810MB (I think)

Floppy drive: 3.5" 1.44MB
Screen size, type, upgradeable to: 10" 640x480x256, SVGA Dual Scan, TFT (I wish
            I could afford one!)
Battery type (lithium-ion, NiMh, NiCd): NiMh
Max battery life while running Linux: Little more than 2 hours
Weight with battery: About 3kg (little more than 6lb)
PCMCIA number of slot, type: 1, III
PCMCIA bridge chip (intel, cirrus, databook, etc.): databook (I think)
Track Ball (location): It's actually a track point, located at the space bar.
            Takes some time getting used to. Buttons just below space bar,
            near the edge.
Docking capability: Yes (not tried yet though)
Power conservation: Screen blank, hard disk spin down (not sure if it works 
            with Linux). It has a standby button that seems to be pretty
            useless.
Misc stuff: It's completely modular. One can remove hard disk, floppy drive,
            battery, keyboard, and screen easily. Replacing the CPU is also
            easy as pie, just as would be adding more memory.
            By removing the floppy drive one can have an extra battery. It
            also comes with a SB Pro compatible soundcard, which works from
            Linux but must be initialized from DOS.
            I am running quite a lot of CPU- and memory-intensive jobs
            (mostly computer algebra, Lisp stuff, and cryptography-related
            stuff) and I am amazed (and proud) at the performance this
            gadget attains. Its 33.58 bogomips are most impressive.
Misc ports: Expansion box connector, CD port, sound in/out ports, external
            micro, external mouse, keyboard and monitor connectors.
Linux Version: Slackware from Dec '94, kernel version 1.1.71; 450MB Linux,
            77MB DOS, 13MB swap space shared by Linux and DOS.   
Networking (parallel/portable/pcmcia modules): I tried to use one of those
            nameless parallel port adapters, and it works from DOS, but not
            from Linux (maybe it will with the newer kernels?) It is supposed
            to have a networking pcmcia module, but I haven`t bought it.
X386 chipset specs: C&T 65540, 1MB video RAM. Works great with the XFree86 
            3.1.1 SVGA server.

RAM  size, type, upgradeable to: 16 Mbyte, TI-proprietary, upto 32M max
Screen size, type, upgradeable to: 10.4" TFT active Matrix, 16bit color
Battery type (lithium-ion,NiMh,NiCd): Lithium-Ion (2 separate batteries)
Max battery life while running linux: 5-8 hours (very good battery life!)
Weight with battery: 6.7 lbs?
PCMCIA number of slot, type: 2 of type II or 1 of type III 
PCMCIA bridge chip (intel, cirrus, databook, etc.): Cirrus
Track Ball (location): IBM thingy (between the G & H keys)
Docking capability: yes, PCI bridge brought thru to docking station!
Power conservation: kernel not running reliably with Linux APM support yet
Misc neat stuff: Lithium-Ion batterys charge very fast, don't have to
                 be discharged first!  The batteries have LEDs to
                 display their charge level (lit by small button).
                 Battery life is at least 4 hrs with disk spinning.
                 Has internal PCI architecture.  Has secondary 128K
                 cache.  Has infrared serial port. Soundblaster/16,
                 PCMCIA, Suspend/Resume, X11R6 (simple VGA only), LILO
                 all work under Linux.  Power-brick A/C adapter is
                 very small (1/2 cigarette box) but it gets hot!
Misc Ports: Stereo sound IN/OUT. Microphone IN. Mouse IN.  VGA OUT.
                 Serial/Parallel I/O.  PCI docking station connection.
Linux Version: Linux v1.2.8
Networking (parallel/portable/pcmcia modules): PCMCIA ethernet (IBM
                 CreditCard Adapter) works fine.  Others not tried.
X386 chipset specs: Cirrus -- GD7543 (not supported in XFree386 or
                 Xinside).  Chip can display 1280x1024 interlaced or
                 lower resolutions non-interlaced.  If support comes
                 out for this chip, will be able to display 16bit full
                 color.

Linux Version: 1.2.8
Networking (parallel/portable/pcmcia modules): Not used at this time
X386 chipset specs: Cirrus LGD-754x video - 640x480 LCD display
Comments: There was problems when I first installed 1.2.8 (InfoMagic 8/95).
          The man pages would give errors.  I recompiled the kernel, and
          all worked fine.  I downloaded the XF86_SVGA.gz and XF86Config.gz
          from ftp.shell.portal.com.  I had to remove/comment out all 
          occurances of 800x600, and replace them with 640x480 to get 
          Xfree86 to operate properly.  I linked /usr/X11R6/bin/X to
          the version of XF86_SVGA that I ftp'ed (above).
