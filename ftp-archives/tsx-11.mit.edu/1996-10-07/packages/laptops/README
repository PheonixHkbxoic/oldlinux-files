This is a repository for laptop specific linux hacks.  The pcmcia
support is done by David Hinds and manually mirrored off of
cb-iris.stanford.edu:/pub/pcmcia.  The apm support is done by Stephen
Rothwell and it currently being integrated with the pcmcia support.

There currently is no work on disk spin down policies and other
general power savings mechanism for laptops.

Enjoy!
