   in one directory tree.
-- Changed device code in ds.c to grab the first free character
   device number.  Also changed cardmgr to read /proc/devices to
   determine what device number was found.  This eliminates the
   need for a kernel patch to include/linux/major.h.
-- Moved the "improved" resource registrar code out of ioport.c and
   into drivers/pcmcia, since it seems unlikely to be adopted any time
   soon.  
-- Changed DE650 driver so that it will pick I/O ports aligned to a 32
   port boundary between 0x300 and 0x400, since odd boundaries don't
   work.
-- Fixed IBM modem test in serial driver so it won't bail on modems
   with incomplete CIS's.
-- Working on simplifying configuration of 3c589 driver.  Now you can
   set if_port from insmod: "insmod 3c589_cs.o if_port=#".  This still
   isn't useful, because cardmgr doesn't allow arguments for modules.
