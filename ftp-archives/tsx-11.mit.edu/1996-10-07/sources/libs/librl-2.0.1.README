Hi,

I have released, the new DLL readline library version 2.0.1 (sources as
distributed with bash-1.14.1). Included also is readline linked bash-1.14.1,
ftp and gdb-4.12 binaries.

WARNING: You must have ld.so version 1.4.4 or above installed for ldconfig
to support QMAGIC DLL's if you intend to use my librl.so.2.0.1 included.
Otherwise you may recompile the library yourself.

Enjoy
