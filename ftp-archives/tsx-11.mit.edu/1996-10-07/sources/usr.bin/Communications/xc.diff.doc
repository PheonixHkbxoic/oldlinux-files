Topic: xc.diff.tar.gz

Hi! I'm from Poland and I got your XC on CD with linux.
Because I had some problems with version 4.1.2 which I got
I made some changes.
I have 14400 bps modem with Error Correction and Data Compression
so I was interested in program supporting 57600 bps port speed.
I found your program as easy to use, though I decided to make proper
changes to make it support this speed. This is done in xcport patch.

XC will support 57600 and 115200 speed under linux after this patch.

Also in my system the master proces hung up when I tried to dial anywhere
from dial dir. A small change in loop in xcterm.c fixes this bug and doesn't
take any effect to the previous behaviour.

Stanley.
