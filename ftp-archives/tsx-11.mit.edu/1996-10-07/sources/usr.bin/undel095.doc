Title:          The Undelete System
Version:        0.95
Description:    `The Undelete System'(TUS) allows you to delete files with the
                possibility to recover them later if needed.
                (ON ANY UNIX SYSTEM with System V IPC features)
                This is done by moving and compressing these files. In
                contradiction to the Athena Undelete, TUS has built-in quota
                support that will allow you to specify what type and amount of
                files will be saved for undeletion, dynamically removing old
                files and replacing them with new files.
                Also, the `deleted' files will be removed from your quota
                (if the deamon is run by root) so you won't need to sacrifice
                any valuable disk space if you can get your system
                administrator to install the package.
