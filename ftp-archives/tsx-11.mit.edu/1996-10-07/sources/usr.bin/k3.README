         K3 v1.0 - displays memory free as percentage and bar chart


Description of the Program
--------------------------

'k3' displays the memory available as a percentage, the number of K free,
and a simple bar chart; for both physical and swap memory. K3 requires the
'proc' file system. If you're not sure whether you have that or not, try it,
you almost certainly have. Alternatively, do 'ls /proc'. :)
