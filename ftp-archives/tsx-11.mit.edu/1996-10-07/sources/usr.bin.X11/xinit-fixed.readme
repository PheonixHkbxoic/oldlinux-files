If you are getting error message after exiting X 
   xinit: unknow error (error 0) client error,
(or so ) here is the fixed xinit.
I pulled the source from clouso.crim.ca.
The credit goes to the good_folk @ crim.ca.

I assume, the latest version of Slackware has this
problem fixed ( as I don't see any more Q's on this
subject on c.o.l.help ).
