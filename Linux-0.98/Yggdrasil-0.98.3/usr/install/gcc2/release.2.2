Please read all the previous release notes and docs. This release note
only covers the new stuffs.

This is gcc 2.2 for Linux, which is equivalent to gcc 2.2.1 from
the FSF. It is on banjo.concert.net under /pub/Linux/GCC. Gcc 2.3 will
support Linux, according to RMS. The FSF has all the files Linux needs.

Please get the new binutils.tar.Z, which fixed some bugs in as.

From this release, gcc will use the shared lib. That means you have
to keep the shared images used by all the compilers you have. I think
there is no disk waste here since the benefit of the shared gcc more
than offsets the shared libs. Now both 2.2misc.tar.Z and
2.2lib.tar.Z can fit into one 5.25 floppy.

Libg++.a is 2.1. You can build it yourself. The source code is
available on the GNU ftp site. You may have to hack a little to compile
it. Please do not compile iostream and get rid of
libg++/src/regex.[cc|h]. Make sure ./libiberty only makes those
functions Linux doesn't have. Please send me a note if you are
interested.

The following bugs in libc.a are fixed.

1. index.
2. sigxxxx return values should be right now.
3. execxxx are taken from glibc.a 1.03. Please check it out.
4. malloc in stdlib.h and malloc.h, when they are included together,
   they may cause trouble. Can I include malloc.h in stdlib.h and fix
   malloc in malloc.h?
5. types used in sigsetmask and siggetmask are now sigset_t.
6. signal.h is changed.
7. hypot added to math.h
8. __cpluseplus in setjmp.h
9. prototype of gdbm_open in gdbm.h
10. Per is trying to fix fseek/fwrite with file opened for read and
    write. 
11. dirent.[ch] are fixed such that static memory no longer is used in
    readdir ().
12. sys/dir.h sys/dirent.h are modified such that there will be a
    warning when both of them are included. They are also compatible
    now.
13. __cpluscplus in fnmath.h
14. gets () will only give a warning during linking.
15. wait3 ().
16. <stdio.h> is fixed. fputc, fgets and gets are no longer macros.
17. <sys/user.h> is added in 0.96ap2inc.tar.Z.
18. The return value of clock ticks of the old sysconf () was wrong. It
    returned 60 instead of 100.
19. The domain errors in the math libraries are improved.
20. bsearch and qsort are fixed for zero element.

The following functions are added to libc.a.

1. accept
2. bind
3. bstring
4. connect
5. ftime
6. fchmod
7. fchown
8. ftruncate
9. getpagesize
10. getpeername
11. getsockname
12. getwd
13. ioperm
14. itimer.
15. listen
16. mmap
17. mntent.
18. ntohs/htons
19. ntohl/htonl
20. psignal
21. ptrace
22. setenv/unsetenv
23. sigsetmask
24. siggetmask
25. socket
26. socketpair
27. statfs () and fstatfs ().
28. tell (bsd)
29. truncate
30. usleep
31. vfork
32. wait3() and wait4 ().

Gdbm 1.5 is here for X11R5.

popen now is based on iostream.

I also changed the structure of header files. To install the gcc 2.2,
please do this first

tar cfz inc.bak.tar.Z /usr/include /usr/g++-include
/bin/rm -rf /usr/include /usr/g++-include

A new structure of gcc is introduced here. All the static libs are in
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-linux/2.xxx and all the shared libs are in
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-linux/2.xxx/shared. By default, gcc will search
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-linux/2.xxx/shared first, then the static libs.
You can turn off the shared libs with "-static".

BTW, you can still use the old compiler, xxx, with

gcc -V xxx

which will use the corresponding shared/static libs for that version.
That will make life for X11 easier.

The default should be the same as gcc -V 2.2

If you want to keep gcc 2.11c, please read FAQ. For the older version,
2.12d or above, it is done automatically.

There is a new file for making the shared images for gcc 2.2,
shlib-2.2.tar.Z. Please use that to build the shared libs. In this
file, a new naming scheme is used. The shared images will be called
"libc.2.2", which I think is better than "libc_v_2_2". BTW, you need
awk for inst2.x now.

There must be a few bugs. Please let me know if you find any.

File list:

1. 2.2lib.tar.Z (cpp, cc1, cc1plus)
2. 2.2misc.tar.Z (header files, drivers, libs, doc, ....)
3. shlib-2.2.tar.Z (making the shared libs for gcc 2.2)
4. libc-2.2.tar.Z (source code for the libs)
6. gcc-2.2.1.tar.Z (patches for compiling gcc 2.2.1)
7. 0.96ap2inc.tar.Z (the kernel header files for 0.96a patch level 2
   with <sys/user.h>)
8. 0.96ainc.tar.Z (the kernel header files for 0.96a)
