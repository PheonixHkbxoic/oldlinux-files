FEATURES
-------------------
This release is for 0.97 pl 4 above. You may have to have at least 2 MB
ram to run it and have some swap space (> 4MB) since cc1 and cc1plus
are about 1 MB. I only tried it with 4 MB ram and 2 MB swap space.

There is a known bug in gcc. If you have a very big initialized array,
gcc will use lots of memory. The result is `out of virtual memory'.
The FSF is trying to fix it.

For the details of the current gcc, please read the corresponding
release notes.

INSTALLATION
--------------
Get gcc 2.xx from

tsx-11.mit.edu or fgb1.fgb.mw.tu-muenchen.de under pub/linux/GCC.

Read ChangeLog for installation.
