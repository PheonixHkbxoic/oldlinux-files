.UC 4
.SH NAME
nice  \- change process priority.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <unistd.h>
.B int nice (int inc);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nice()
adds 
.I inc
to the priority for the calling pid.
Note that only the superuser may specify a negative increment,
or priority increase.
Note that internally, a higher number is a higher priority.
Do not confuse this
with the priority scheme as used by the 
.B  nice()
interface.
.PP
0 is returned on success, a negative value on error.
.SH ERRORS
.B -EPERM            
is returned if the non-super user attempts to do a priority increase,
a numerical decrease,
by supplying a negative
.I inc
.PP
