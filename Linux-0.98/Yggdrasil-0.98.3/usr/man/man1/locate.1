.TH LOCATE 1
.SH NAME
locate \- list files in a database that match a pattern
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B locate
pattern...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page
documents the GNU version of
.BR locate .
For each given pattern,
.B locate
searches a database of file pathnames and displays the pathnames that
contain the pattern.  Patterns can contain shell-style metacharacters:
`*', `?', and `[]'.  The metacharacters do not treat `/' or `.'
specially.  Patterns that contain metacharacters should be quoted to
protect them from expansion by the shell.
.LP
If a pattern is a plain string \(em it contains no metacharacters \(em
.B locate
displays all pathnames in the database that contain that string
anywhere.  If a pattern does contain metacharacters, it only displays
pathnames that match the pattern exactly.  As a result, patterns that
contain metacharacters should usually begin with a `*', and will
most often end with one as well.  The exceptions are patterns that are
intended to explicitly match the beginning or end of a pathname.
.LP
The database contains a list of the files that were on the system
whenever the database was last updated.
The frequency with which the database is updated and the directories
for which it contains entries are configurable by the system
administrator.
.LP
If the environment variable
.B LOCATE_DB
is set,
.B locate
uses it as the path of the filename database instead of the
compiled-in path.
