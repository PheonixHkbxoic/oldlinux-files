     _F_m is a simple text formatter.  With no options, the default behav-
     ior of _f_m is to copy its input (from specified files or from stdin,
     if no files are specified) to its output but with input reformatted
     into  lines  no  longer  than  72 characters long.  A blank line is
     taken to indicate the beginning of a new paragraph.  Lines that be-
     gin with a period are preserved.

     The  program will partially emulate some other text formatters, de-
     pending on what options it is given or what name it is  called  by.
     If the program is invoked by _n_r_o_f_f or _n_r_o_f_f _-_m_a_n, it will interpret
     man pages (this is equivalent to_ _f_m _-_j_m_o.) With the name  _f_m_t,  (or
     the  --bb  option)  it works like the UCB program of that name.  With
     the name _t_e_x, a very few TTeeXX  commands  are  interpreted  (this  is
     equivalent to _f_m _-_j_x.)

     The indentation and spacing of the input text is not preserved, un-
     less there is some formatting command to the contrary, or the  pro-
     gram is called _f_m_t, in which case spacing and increased indents are
     kept (and the latter cause paragraph breaks).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     The following options modify the default behavior:

     --_w_i_d_t_h
	  This changes the line width from the default of 72 characters.
	  This  is the maximum number of visible characters allowed, not
	  taking account of the newline character at  the  end  of  each
	  line.   However,  with the --bb option, if the program is called
	  by the name _f_m_t, for compatibility, the width requested is de-
	  creased  by one, so that in effect, the newline character does
	  count toward the maximum.

     --ii   This option will cause _f_m to preserve indentations, and blanks
	  or tabs at the beginning of a line begin a new paragraph.

     --jj   Justify  output lines.  (The default is to output lines with a
	  ragged right margin).

     --cc   Crown margin mode.  The indentation for the first  line  of  a
	  paragraph  is  taken  from  the indentation of the first input
	  line of the paragraph, and the indentation of the second input
	  line  of  the paragraph is used for the remainder of the para-
	  graph.  This option is for compatibility with UCB  _f_m_t,  which
	  has  the problem that if input lines are much longer than out-
	  put lines, more lines than just the first may get the indenta-
	  tion of the first input line.  This bug is preserved.

     --CC   For  C  code,  display comments reversed, flow-of-control key-
	  words in bold, storage-class keywords underlined, and pre-pro-
	  cessor  keywords  blinking.  No other formatting is done.  The
	  -u option is assumed unless the -o option is given.

     --mm   Interpret a few commonly used _n_r_o_f_f -man commands.  Those  un-
	  derstood (in some fashion) are:

	   .B .I .R .S .G .SM .C
	   .IR .BR .RI .BI .RB .IB
	   .SH .SS .TH .PP .P .LP .TP .IP .HP
	   .RS .RE .DS .DE .NT .NE .VS .VE
	   .CT .PN .MS
	   .UC (ignored) .DT (ignored) .PD (ignored)

     And a few other nroff commands that occur commonly in man pages are
     recognized:

	   \fI \fB \fR \fP \fC
	   .sp .br .nf .fi .ti .na .ad .hy
	   .\" \*(lq \*(rq .ta (ignored)

     More details can be found in the document _c_m_d_s_._t_e_x.

     --oo   Produce bold and underlined text with  overstriking.   If  the
	  terminal  and  termcap entries permit, the bold and underlined
	  portions can be seen on the screen by  feeding  _f_m  output  to
	  _u_l_(_1_).   Bold  is produced by fonts B/bf, S/tt, and underlined
	  by I/it, G/sl.

     --uu   Produce bold, underlined, reversed, and blinking text for ter-
	  minal  display  (using termcap md, us, mr, and mb entries, re-
	  spectively).  This is useful only if one of the options -m  or
	  -x  is also chosen.  Bold is produced by font B/bf, underlined
	  by I/it, reversed by S/tt, and blinking by G/sl.

     --ss   Split lines only.  Short input lines are not  joined  to  form
	  paragraphs.

     --bb   Berkeley mode.  Preserve indentation and word spacing like the
	  UCB _f_m_t program.

     --xx   Interpret a few commonly used _T_e_X commands.  Those  understood
	  (in some fashion) are:

	   \hsize \hoffset \parindent \parskip \noindent \par
	   \break \leftskip \rightskip \bye \end
	   \bigskip \medskip \smallskip \$ \# \{ \}
	   \& \% \^ \_ \~ \' \" \\ \it \sl \bf \rm \tt
	   \TeX \centerline \rightline \raggedright \obeylines \item
	   { } \(space) ~ $ (ignored) \backslash \beginsection

     --hh_h_y_p_h
	  Assign  hyphenation  level.   0 means don't hyphenate; a digit
	  from 1 through 9 means do hyphenate.  2-9 prevents dividing  a
	  long  word  arbitrarily,  when no legitimate hyphenation point
	  can be found, in the extreme situation when the  word  exceeds
	  the total available line width.  6-9 prevents dividing after a
	  real hyphen.  7-9 prevents hyphenating a "word"  with  non-al-
	  phabetic  characters  surrounded  by alphabetic ones, as in an
	  email address.  (Default is level 1,  unless  the  program  is
	  called _f_m_t, in which case the default is no hyphenation.)

     --pp_o_f_f_s_e_t
	  Change  the  page  offset.   This moves the output text to the
	  right by the indicated number of columns.

     --tt_t_a_b_s_i_z_e
	  Change the default spacing between tab stops from  8  to  some
	  other  value.   This affects the interpretation of tab charac-
	  ters in the input text when spacing makes a difference, and it
	  also  affects  the output, since _f_m putputs tab characters for
	  leading white space only when the tabsize is 8.

     --aa

     --nn   These options have no effect.  (They are present to allow  the
	  program to be invoked with "nroff -man ...".)

TTIIPPSS
     In _v_i, you can define a macro that will reformat paragraphs by typ-
     ing_ _"_:_m_a_p _V _{_!_}_f_m _-_i _-_h_0_^_M_" or by putting the line
	  _"_m_a_p_ _V_ _{_!_}_f_m_ _-_i_ _-_h_0_^_M_"
     in  your_ _ _._e_x_r_c  file.   After defining this macro, pressing _V will
     cause the paragraph under the cursor to be reformatted.  (Use the _u
     key to _u_n_d_o if necessary.

     TeX  command interpretation doesn't have a chance of working except
     for files prepared with the limitations of _f_m in mind.  Nroff  -man
     interpretation has a fair chance.

     Not all combinations of options will give sensible results.
