DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ddvviippss is a program that takes a _d_v_i file produced  by  TeX
       and  converts it to PostScript commands that can be fed to
       a PostScript printer for printing.  The dvi  file  may  be
       specified without the _._d_v_i extension.

       The  _d_v_i_f_i_l_e  argument  is  mandatory.   All  the rest are
       optional.  Optional arguments are:

       --nn _n_u_m _n_u_m pages will be printed out.

       --pp _n_u_m The first page printed will  be  the  one  numbered
              _n_u_m_.

       --oo _n_a_m_e
              The output will be sent to file _n_a_m_e_.

       --hh _n_a_m_e
              Use  file  _n_a_m_e  as the header file rather than the
              default.

       --cc _n_u_m Generate _n_u_m copies.

       --qq     Run in quiet mode.

       -f     Run as a filter.  Read the dvi file  from  standard
              input  and write the PostScript to standard output.

       --rr     Reverse order the pages.  Normally, page  one  will
              be printed first.

       --??     Print out the banner identifying the program.

       --dd _n_u_m Set  the debug flag.  Usually should not be used by
              normal users.  This will only  work  if  ddvviippss  has
              been  compiled with the DEBUG option.  See the file
              _d_e_b_u_g_._h in the sources to see what  the  values  of
              _n_u_m can be.

       The  ddvviippss  program  also recognizes two environment vari-
       ables, TTEEXXFFOONNTTSS (to search for tfm files,  like  TeX)  and
       TTEEXXPPKKSS (to search for pk files.)

       The  config file can be used to set many of the options to

       this section.  The options are:

       oo _n_a_m_e The default output file is set to _n_a_m_e

       tt _p_a_t_h The path to search for the tfm files is _p_a_t_h_.

        _p_a_t_h  The path to search for the font files is _p_a_t_h_.  The
              TEXFONTS environment variable will override this.

       rr      Default to reversing the pages.

       dd _f_o_n_t _m_a_p_p_e_d_F_o_n_t _j
              The  font  named _f_o_n_t is treated as a resident font
              and is mapped to the font named _m_a_p_p_e_d_F_o_n_t_.  I have
              no idea what the _j parameter means.

       qq      Run in quiet mode by default.

       ff      Run as a filter by default.

       hh _n_a_m_e Add  _n_a_m_e  as a header file to be downloaded at the
              beginning.

       This program supports use of the \special command  in  TEX
       to  include  special  POSTSCRIPT  code  for graphics, etc.
       Specifying ``\special{psfile=foo.ps}'' in the  TEX  source
       will result in the contents of file ``foo.ps'' (assumed to
       contain POSTSCRIPT code) being copied into the  output  at
       that  point.  For most included graphics, the user's (0,0)
       point will be set to the point  of  the  \special  command
       with  x  and  y coordinates increasing up and to the right
       and in units of POSTSCRIPT points (1/72 inch) -- thus  you
       must explicitly leave space above the \special command for
       most graphics.  For graphics produced by Apple Macintoshes
       (i.e.,  MacDraw,  MacPaint,  etc.), the top left corner of
       the drawing will be at the point of the \special  command;
       in  this  case you must leave the required space below the
       \special.

       The \special string can contain any number of the  follow-
       ing ``keyword=value'' pairs, separated by blanks:

         hsize    dimension  specifies  maximum  horizontal  size
       (for clipping)
         vsize    dimension  specifies maximum vertical size (for
       clipping)
         hoffset  dimension  specifies amount to shift right

         voffset  dimension  specifies amount  to  shift  up  (or
       down, for Macintosh drawings)
         hscale   number     specifies   a  scale  factor  in  x-
       dimension
         vscale   number     specifies  a  scale  factor  in   y-
       dimension

       Dimensions  are  given in POSTSCRIPT points (72 per inch).
       For example,

        \special{psfile=foo.ps hoffset=72 hscale=0.9 vscale=0.9}

       will shift the graphics produced by file ``foo.ps''  right
       by  1"  and  will  draw  it at 0.9 normal size.  Hsize and
       vsize are given relative to the (0,0) point of the drawing
       and  are  unaffected  by  offsets and scales.  Offsets are
       given relative to the point of the \special  command,  and
       are unaffected by scales.

       If  Macintosh  drawings  are to be included, the Macintosh
       LaserPrep file must be downloaded to the  printer,  either
       permanently  or  as another header file in addition to the
       standard ``tex.pro'' header file.
