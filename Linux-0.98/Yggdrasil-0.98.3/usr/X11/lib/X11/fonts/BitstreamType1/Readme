Bitstream Inc. has donated eight Postscript Type 1 fonts to the MIT X
Consortium, four styles each of the Bitstream Charter and Courier
typefaces.  Six of these fonts were shipped with the X11 Release 5
core software in Speedo outline format.  The Type 1 outlines can be
used with the Type 1 rasterizer shipped as part of the contributed
software for X11R5.

The eight fonts comprising this donation are as follows:
Courier
Courier Italic
Courier Bold
Courier Bold Italic
Bitstream Charter
Bitstream Charter Italic
Bitstream Charter Bold
Bitstream Charter Bold Italic

How to use these outline fonts:

If you have not already done so, integrate the Type 1 font rasterizer
into your font library.  To do this, move or copy the directory from
R5 contrib:

contrib/fonts/lib/font/Type1   to    mit/fonts/lib/font/Type1

See contrib/fonts/lib/font for the files to change to integrate this
code.  Rebuild the font server and/or X server.

(You may also wish to move contrib/fonts/scaled/Type1 to
mit/fonts/scaled/Type1 to use the other Type 1 fonts contributed for
R5.)

The Charter Bold fonts distributed in R5, both bitmaps and Speedo
outlines, are actually Black, a heavier weight than bold.  The Charter
Bold fonts in this set really are bold.  What we have done in our
local sources at MIT is to rename the old fonts to "black" and use the
new fonts for bold.  The steps for doing this are described below.

The bitmap Charter Bold fonts in R5 are just a rasterization of the
Speedo fonts, so they can be removed to make the change-over easier.
Remove the mit/fonts/*dpi/charB*bdf files.  The Imakefile in each of
the fonts/75dpi and fonts/100dpi directories will have to be edited
to remove references to these font files.

Edit mit/fonts/scaled/Speedo/fonts.scale to rename the
-bitstream-charter-bold-* fonts to -bitstream-charter-black-*.

Move the files in this directory into mit/fonts/scaled/Type1/,
merging fonts.scale with any fonts.scale file already present.
Update the Imakefile to include the new fonts.

Restart the font server or rehash the font path in the X server, and
you are set to use the new fonts!
