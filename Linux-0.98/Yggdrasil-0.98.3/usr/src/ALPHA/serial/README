These are patches to Linux 0.98 to improve the serial driver.  Main features 
added are:

	* The Interrupt routine has been made much faster; hopefully
		this should prove performance on 16 megahertz machines.

	* Automatic IRQ detection --- it's no longer to necessary to 
		configure non-standard IRQ's for serial ports.
	
	* Non-standard UART clones found in some internal modems
		should now be recognized (because of the above change.)

	* The driver now supports hardware flow control to prevent
		receiver buffer overruns.

	* Initial support for an optional "Secure Attention Key" which 
		provides a "trusted path" to the login program.
		(See the Department of Defense Trusted Computer System
		Evaluation Criteria, 15 Auguest 1983 for more information.)

	* The termios flag IXANY is now supported.

The file "serpatches" is a context diffs which contains patches versus
0.98.  The other files are there in case you just want to pick up
replacement copies.  

I'd appreciate it if people with 16 megahertz machines could try this
serial driver at 9600 and 19200 baud.  (19200 may not work if you have
X or any other programs running; as far as I can tell, this the fault
Linux kernel having too high of a interrupt latency, and there's
little the serial driver can do about this.)  Also, I'd appreciate it
if people with internal modems, particular Zoom internal modems, could
try it out and see if the kernel recognizes the modem now.
