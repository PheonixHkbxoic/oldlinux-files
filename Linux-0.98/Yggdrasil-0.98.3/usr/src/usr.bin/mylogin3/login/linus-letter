I have uploaded the latest version of my login program for linux
to our local ftp-site:

	ftp.daimi.aau.dk (/pub/Linux-source/mylogin3.tar.Z)

I have dropped the pathetic gethostname code, when I discovered it was
already in the kernel.

The utmp routines are now much better, and should comply with XPG2 and
SVID2. In connection with this I threw away the ugly uwtmp.c code, and
put the necessary things in the login.c code.

The hostname.c code is now for a real hostname(1) program.

There's also a last(1) command for perusing the wtmp file.

Feel free to include some or all of this in Linux.

Files:

	login.c	-	the main login code
			the getpass() routine might go in libc too.
	putenv.c -	implements the putenv() function, put it in libc
	setenv.c -	implements setenv(), put it in libc
	utmp2.c - 	the getutent(), pututline() etc. functions,
			these should go in libc too
	encrypt.c - 	for encrypting passwords, I haven't had time to
			make a real passwd program yet.
	last.c	-	peruse the wtmp file backwards
	who.c	-	list utmp / active users.
	hostname.c	implements hostname(1) program
	param.h	-	slight extension of <sys/param.h> includes
			getdtablesize() macro.

Keep up the good work.


Regards,

	Peter. (poe@daimi.aau.dk)
