MODE LINE
---------

The line above the function key display at the bottom of the screen
is referred to as the "communication line".  This is where Origami
interactively communicates with you.  Later you will see how Origami
prompts you for information on this line, such as to initiate a
search.  Origami can report things to you on this line as well.
 
>>  Type C-X = and see what appears in the communication line. Don't worry
    about what all this information means - it is just an example of how
    Origami lets you know more about the file you are editing.
 
The line immediately above the communication line is referred to as the
"mode line".  The mode line looks something like
 
=* Origami 1.5.7 (Emacs,None) == teach-emacs ===============================
 
This is a very useful "information" line.
 
  -  The asterisk (star) indicates that changes have been made to the file.
     Immediately after opening or saving a file, there is no star.
 
  -  Any words inside the parentheses indicate the "modes" Origami is
     currently in.  Modes will be discussed in the next section.
 
  -  The next string is the name of the file you are currently editing.
 
>>  Look at the mode line and identify the items discussed above.
 
 
MODES
-----
 
Listed within the parentheses are the current "modes".  The modes
influence the behaviour of Origami.  Some modes appear as a side effect
of a command, others are global modes.  The command prefixes to add and
delete these global modes are

     C-X M     Add a mode
     C-X C-M   Delete a mode
 
>>  Type C-X m o.  Origami is now in overwrite mode.  To get it back to
    insert mode, type C-X C-M o.

If you use a long filename and many modes are actice, your status line
may become too wide.  If this happens, Origami uses abbreviations for
the modes, e.g. O instead Over.
