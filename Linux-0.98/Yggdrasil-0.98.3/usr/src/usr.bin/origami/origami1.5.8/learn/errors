ERRORS
------

Sometimes you may do something which Origami doesn't allow.  If it is
something simple, such as typing a CONTROL key sequence which is not
associated with any command, Origami will just ignore it.  Otherwise,
Origami will also display an informative error message at the bottom of
the screen.  Simple messages are displayed in brackets, prompts will
appear without brackets and end with a question mark.
