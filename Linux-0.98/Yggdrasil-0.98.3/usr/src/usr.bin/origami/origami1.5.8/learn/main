You are looking at the Origami Emacs-mode tutorial.

NOTE:  This tutorial attempts to help you "learn by doing".  The characters
       ">>" at the left margin of your screen indicate directions for you to
       try using a command.

Origami commands generally involve the CONTROL key (sometimes labelled CTRL
or CTL) or the META key (generally labelled ESCAPE).  Rather than write out
CONTROL or META each time we want you to prefix a character, we'll use the
following abbreviations:

    C-<chr>   Hold the CONTROL key while pressing the character <chr>.
              Thus, C-F would be:  hold the CONTROL key and press F.

    M-<chr>   Press the ESCAPE key and release it, then press the
              character <chr>.  Note:  All command treated in this tutorial
              will have the same meaning for upper or lower case characters
              (<chr>).  They will be written in lower case characters.
 
    M-C-<chr> Press the ESCAPE key and release it, then hold the CONTROL key
              while pressing the character <chr>.
 
>>  Now type C-V (View Next Screen) to move to the next screen.
    Remember:  hold the CONTROL key and press V.
 
 
IMPORTANT NOTE:  If you must exit at some point, type C-X C-C.
 
For the time being, you'll be expected to type C-V whenever you finish reading
the current screen.
 
Note that there is an overlap when going from screen to screen; this provides
some continuity when moving through the file.
 
The first thing that you need to know is how to move around from place to
place in the file.  You already know how to move forward a screen with C-V.
To move back a screen, type M-v.
 
>>  Try typing M-v and then C-V to move back and forth between screens a few
    times.
 
 
SUMMARY
-------
 
The following commands are useful for viewing screens:
 
     C-V      Move forward one screen
     M-v      Move back one screen
     C-L      Clear screen and redisplay everything, putting the text
              near the cursor at the center of the screen.
 
>>  Find the cursor and remember what text is near it.  Type an C-L.
    Find the cursor again and see what text is near it now.
 
 
BASIC CURSOR CONTROL
--------------------
 
Getting from screen to screen is useful, but how do you reposition yourself
within a given screen to a specific place?  There are several ways you can
do this.  One way (not the best, but the most basic) is to use the commands
previous, backward, forward and next.  As you can imagine these commands
(which are given to Origami as C-P, C-B, C-F, and C-N respectively) move the
cursor from where it currently is to a new place in the given direction.
Here, in a more graphical form, are the commands:
 
                          Previous line, C-P
                                  :
                                  :
   Backward, C-B .... Current cursor position .... Forward, C-F
                                  :
                                  :
                          Next line, C-N
 
You'll probably find it easy to think of these by letter.  P for previous,
N for next, B for backward and F for forward.  These are the basic cursor
positioning commands and you'll be using them ALL the time so it would be
of great benefit if you learn them now.
 
>>  Do a few C-N's to bring the cursor down to this line.
 
>>  Move into the line with C-F's and then up with several C-P's.  Note what
    C-P does when the cursor is in the middle of the line.
 
>>  Try C-B at the beginning of a line.  Note what happened to the cursor.
    Do a few more C-B's.  Then do C-F's back to the end of the line and beyond.
 
When you go off the top or bottom of the screen, the text beyond the edge is
shifted onto the screen so that your instructions can be carried out while
keeping the cursor on the screen.
 
>>  Move the cursor off the bottom of the screen with C-N's and see what
    happens.  Note the new position of the cursor.
 
If moving by characters is too slow, you can move by words.  M-f moves
forward a word and M-b moves back a word.
 
>>  Type a few M-f's and M-b's.  Intersperse them with C-F's and C-B's.
 
Notice the parallel between C-F and C-B on the one hand, and M-F and M-B on
the other hand.  Very often META characters are used for operations related
to English text whereas CONTROL characters operate on the basic textual units
that are independent of what you are editing (characters, lines, etc.).
 
Two other commands which are useful are C-A and C-E.  These commands move the
cursor to the beginning (C-A) and the end (C-E) of the line.
 
>>  Try a couple of C-A's, and then a couple of C-E's.  Note that the cursor
    does not move when either of these commands is repeated continuously.
 
Two other simple cursor motion commands are M-< (less than), which moves
to the beginning of the file, and M-> (greater than), which moves to the
end of the file.  If you need the shift key to type a "<", then you must
also use the shift key to type M-<.  Otherwise, you would be typing M-, .
 
The location of the cursor within the text is also called "point".  To
paraphrase, the cursor shows on the screen where point is located in the
text.
 
Here is a summary of simple moving operations, including the word and
line moving commands:
 
     C-F       Move forward a character
     C-B       Move back a character
 
     M-f       Move forward a word
     M-b       Move back a word
 
     C-N       Move to next line
     C-P       Move to previous line
 
     C-A       Move to beginning of line
     C-E       Move to end of line
 
     M-<       Go to beginning of file
     M->       Go to end of file
 
>>  Try all of these commands now a few times for practice as these are
    the most often used commands.  Since the last two will take you away
    from this screen, use C-V's and M-v's to return here.
 
Like all other commands in Origami, these commands can be given arguments
which cause them to be executed repeatedly.  The way you give a command
a repeat count is by pressing META (ESC) and then the number before you
enter the command.
 
For instance, M-8 C-F moves forward eight characters.
 
>>  Try giving a suitable argument to C-N or C-P to come as close as you
    can to this line in one jump.
 
This also applies to the screen moving commands, C-V and M-v.  When given
an argument, they scroll the screen up or down by that many screens.

>>  Try typing ESC-3 C-V now.

If you would like to scroll up, you can give an argument to M-V.


FOLDS
-----

Origami is a folding editor.  Now is the time when you will get familiar with
folds.  If a fold is closed, the first text in the fold header are three dots,
followed by two blanks.  A fold can be opened with C-O.  The beginning of the
fold header changes from the three dots to three opening curly braces. The end
of the fold is marked by three closing curly braces.  You can close a open fold
with C-C.

>>  Go two lines below and type C-O

{{{  This is the fold header

These are the contents of this fold.

>>  Type C-C to close it.
}}}

Another way to edit the contents of a fold is to enter it.  Entering is done
by M-C-O.  Such a fold can be exited with M-C-O.

>>  Move the cursor to the fold below and type M-C-O

{{{  Another fold
>>  Type M-C-C to exit this fold.
}}}

Folds are created with M-C-N.
 
>>  Move the cursor at the beginning of this line and type M-C-N once to mark
    the beginning of the fold at this line.  Move the cursor below this line
    to mark the end and type M-C-N again.  The new fold will be closed.
 
>>  Write somthing at the fold header.  Remember, that you can write two
    characters right from the three dots.
 
>>  To unfold this fold, type C-U while the cursor is on the closed fold.
 
The folds above contain text in this file.  Another kind of folds contains
text of other files.  These folds are called file-folds.  You can not open
file-folds, only entering them is possible.
 
>>  The next chapters are file-folds.  They begin with ...F and the name of
    the chapter.  Enter then with M-C-O and exit them with M-C-C.
    Move the cursor two lines down and enter the file-fold of the
    abort chapter.

CONCLUSION
----------

Remember:  To EXIT use C-X C-C.

This tutorial is meant to be understandable to all new users, so if you
found something unclear, don't sit and blame yourself - complain!

You'll probably find that if you use Origami for a few days you won't be
able to give it up.  Initially it may give you trouble.  But remember,
this is the case with any editor, especially one that can do many, many
things - and Origami can do practically everything.
