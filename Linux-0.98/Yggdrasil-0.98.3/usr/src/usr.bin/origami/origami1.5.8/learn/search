SEARCHING
---------

Origami can do searches for strings (these are groups of contiguous
characters or words) either forward through the file or backward through
it.

>>  Now type C-S to start a search.  Type the word "cursor", then <return>.
 
>>  Type C-S <return> to find the next occurrence of "cursor".
 
The C-S starts a search that looks for any occurrence of the search string
AFTER the current cursor position.  But what if you want to search for
something earlier in the text?  To do this one should type C-R for
search-reverse.  Everything that applies to C-S applies to C-R except that
the direction of the search is reversed.
 
 
TEXT REPLACEMENT
----------------
 
>>  Move the cursor to the blank line two lines below this one.  Then type
    M-r changed <return> altered <return>.
 
    Notice how this line has changed; you have replaced the word "changed"
    with "altered" wherever it occurs in the file after the cursor.  After all
    the substitutions have been made or the end of file has been reached, a
    message informing you of the number of substitutions which have been made
    appears in the communication line.
 
The more customary command for replacing strings is the interactive
command query-replace-search (M-C-R), which has several options.  In
essence, it shows each occurrence of the first string and asks you if you
want to replace it or not.
