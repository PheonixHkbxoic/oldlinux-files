INSERTING AND DELETING
----------------------

If you want to type text, just start typing.  Characters which you can
see, such as A, 7, *, etc.  are taken by Origami as text and are
immediately inserted.  Type <Return> to insert a line separator, i.e., a
single linefeed character.

You can delete the last character you typed by typing either <Backspace>
or C-H.  On some keyboards, there is a dedicated key for creating a C-H.
If so, it is usually labelled as either "Backspace" or "<--". <Delete> is
a key on the keyboard, which may be labelled "Rubout" instead of "Delete"
on some terminals.  More generally, <Backspace> deletes the character
immediately before the current cursor position, whereas <Delete> deletes
the character the cursor is under.

>>  Now type a few characters and then delete them by typing <Backspace>
    a few times.
 
>>  Now start typing text until you reach the right margin, then continue
    to type.  When a line of text gets too big for one line on the screen, the
    line of text is "continued" off the edge of the screen.  The dollar sign
    at the right margin indicates a line which has been continued.  The line
    will scroll if you move the cursor forwards.  The maximum line length is
    256 characters.
 
This concept is easier to understand by doing rather than by reading about
it so it is suggested that the following exercises be done.
 
>>  The following line actually goes off the edge.  Try typing enough M-F's
    so that you move off the right hand end of this line.  This is a long line of text.  Note the "$" at the right edge.  Keep typing M-F's and watch where
    Origami decides to scroll the line.  Now, type M-B's until Origami decides to scroll the line again.
 
>>  Go to the line you entered which the text continued off the edge of the
    screen.  Use C-D's to delete the text until the text line fits on one
    screen line again.  The continuation "$" will go away.
 
>>  Move the cursor to the beginning of a line and type C-H.  This deletes
    the line separator before the line and merges the line onto the previous
    line.  The resulting line may be too long to fit on the screen, in which
    case it has a continuation indicator.
 
>>  Press <Return> to insert the separator again.
 
Remember that most Origami commands can be given a repeat count.  Note that
this includes characters which insert themselves.
 
>>  Try that now -- type M-8 * and see what happens.
 
If you want to transpose two characters, move to the last one of the pair
and type C-T.
 
>>  Move to the n of the word wrogn and type C-T.
 
You've now learned the most basic way of typing something in Origami and
correcting errors.  You can delete characters, words or lines as well.
Here is a summary of the delete operations:

     <Backspace>   Delete the character just before the cursor
     C-H           Delete the character just before the cursor
     C-D           Delete the character the cursor is under

     C-K           Kill from the cursor position to end of line
     C-X C-K       Kill a whole line
     M-C-K         Kill a whole line and put it to the kill/pick-buffer
 
Now suppose you kill something with M-C-K, and then you decide that you
want to get it back?  Well, whenever you kill something with M-C-K,
Origami saves it for you.  To yank it back, use C-Y.  Note that you don't
have to be in the same place to do C-Y.  This is a good way to move text
around.  Note that a line can be a closed fold.  C-K does not allow to
kill a fold, it only works on text lines.  M-C-K and C-Y work with folds.
Origami puts the yanked text in a fold.  Use C-U to unfold it.

C-X C-K works for folds too.  You might think that the last one is
dangerous, but you can get such a line back by typing C-X C-Y directly
after you deleted it by accident.  This function only works for one line,
which means that you should be careful when using C-X C-K.

>>  Type C-N a couple times to position the cursor at some line on this
    screen.  Now kill that line with M-C-K.
 
The text that has just disappeared is saved so that you can retrieve it
by C-Y.
 
>>  Try it.  Type C-Y to yank the text back.  Then unfold it with C-U.
 
Think of C-Y as if you were yanking something back that someone took away
from you.  Notice that if you do several M-C-K's the text that is killed is
all saved together so that one C-Y will yank all of the lines.
 
>>  Try it.  Type M-C-K several times.
 
>>  To retrieve that killed text:  Type C-Y.
 
Sometimes you want to copy parts of your text instead of moving them.  This
function is performed with M-w, which only copies a line to the kill/pick
buffer and does not remove it from your text.
 
>>  Move the cursor to this line and type M-w.
 
>>  Move the cursor to this line and type C-Y to get it back and C-U to unfold
    it.
 
If you want to copy or move longer blocks of text, put them in a fold and copy
or move this fold.
