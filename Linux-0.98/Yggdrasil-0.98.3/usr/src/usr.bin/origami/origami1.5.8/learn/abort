ABORTING COMMANDS
-----------------
 
The Origami command used to abort any command which requests input is
C-G.  For example, you can use C-G to discard a numeric argument or at
the beginning of a command that you don't want to finish.

>>  Type M-100 to make a numeric argument of 100, then type C-G.
    Now type C-F.  How many characters does it move?  If you have
    typed an ESC by mistake, you can get rid of it with C-G.

>>  Exit this chapter with M-C-C after reading it.
