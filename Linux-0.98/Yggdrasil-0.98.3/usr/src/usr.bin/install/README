Ye Olde Computer Shoppe - YOCS #4 - install(1), v1.2

Hi gang!

  When making new programs it's usually a rather tedious business to
have to strip all files, copy them, chown them, and finally chmod them
using 4 separate commands. install(1) does it all. I copied the options
from a sun manual page, so I think it's pretty standard. (including a
unused "-c" option to make install(1) copy in stead of move. install(1)
always copies)

  Install(1) knows two major actions:
	- Making a directory:
	  "install -d pathname" Will create the given directory, and
	   any directories in the path up to it.
	- Copying files: Without the "-d" install works just like
	   the cp(1) command
  Install(1)s behaviour can be modified with the following options:
	"-m omode" - set the created directory's (or copied file's)
		mode to omode. Octal notation only.
	"-o owner" - perform a chown on the created file/directory.
		The group ownership will be taken as the given
		owner's group.
	"-g group" - perform a chgrp on the created file/directory.
		This allows setting a different group than the one
		associated with the owner.
	"-s"       - Strip the file. Only for executables.
		Note that stripping may cause links to be lost if they
		existed for the destination file.
  If install(1) is used for creating a directory, and the directory
exists already, then the total effect will be that of the subsidiary
actions (chown/chmod).

  In this shar file you will find a (hopefully) working install(1).
The README file is this message. Makefile is included, please check
definitions for CC, CFLAGS & BINDIR. "make" will make install, "make
install" installs install using install. Sorry about that, let's hope
make won't get as confused as I get from this. ;-)
  I included a man-page, which can be added to /usr/man/man1 with:
	cat install.man >>/usr/man/man1

  The previous version forgot the group id given with the '-g' option
if it was followed by a '-o' (which sets owner id, and should set
group id only if no '-g' is given).

Greetings, Bert Laverman.
