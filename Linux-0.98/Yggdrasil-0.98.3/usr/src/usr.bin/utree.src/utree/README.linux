Compiling under Linux:

The patches needed to compile were trivial and involved 
fighting with the Makefile, renaming "remove"
in file.c and commenting out the function "putchar" in
utree.prlist.c. The diffs are in utree.linux.cd.

To compile:
patch -p1 < utree.linux.cd
cp sys/Makefile.linux src/Makefile
cp sys/conf.h.linux src/conf.h
Edit the toplevel Makefile for defaults.
make
