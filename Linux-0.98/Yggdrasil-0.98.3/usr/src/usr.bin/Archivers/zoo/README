zoobin.tar.Z and zoosrc.zoo are the source and binary for zoo as ported
to Linux. Because the zoosrc.zoo was far smaller than a tar.Z, and zoo
users will want to use zoo, and the static linked zoo binary may be useful
to people without an hour to compile... use zoobin.tar.Z zoo (static
linked) to unpack the zoosrc.zoo.
