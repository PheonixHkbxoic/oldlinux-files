The terminal emulation has changed a lot in linux 0.96b.
It now conforms much more closely to vt102 and several new
features have been added. Among other things, the escape
sequence reserved for setterm commands has changed (it
clashed with the vt102 reset mode sequence). That means
that a new version of setterm is needed. Here it is, with
a number of new switches.

New options

-cursor [on|off] turns displays/hides the cursor.

-repeat [on|off] turns key-repeat on/off.

-appcursorkeys [on|off] causes the arrow keys to
 send either normal cursor codes, or application
 mode cursor codes. The codes are:

			Normal		Application
	Up		Esc [ A		Esc O A
	Down		Esc [ B		Esc O B
	Right		Esc [ C		Esc O C
	Left		Esc [ D		Esc O D

-linewrap [on|off] turns automatic margins on/off. If the
 margins are on, long lines get wrapped on the next line
 below, otherwise the remainder of the line is not displayed.

-ulcolor [bright] <color> can be used to set the color for the
 underline attribute (color displays only).

-hbcolor [bright] <color> can be used to set the color for the
 half-bright attribute (color displays only).

The obsolete -standout switch has been removed.

-inversescreen [on|off] turns the inverse video mode on/off.

-half-bright [on|off] turns the half-bright attribute on/off.

-tabs displays the current tabulator settings.

-tabs [tab1] [tab2] [tab3] etc. sets tab stops. [tabn] is a number
 between 1 and 160.

-clrtabs clears all tab stops.

-clrtabs [tab1] [tab2] [tab3] etc. clears tab stops.

-regtabs [length]  sets regular tab stops. The parameter specifies
 tab length. If the parameter is omitted, a lenght of 8 characters
 is used.


I hope the changes in the terminal emulation are all for the better.
However, a lot of things have been rewritten and there might be some
nasty surprises. For these I will accept full blame. If something
works right, the credit probably belongs to Linus. :-)

P.S.	Check out the included termcap entry. It is for 80x25 mode
	only, but it can easily be converted to any display mode
	by changing the li# (lines) and co# (columns) capabilities
	on the first line accordingly. I wrote this termcap entry
	from scratch and it includes every single capability of
	the virtual console (well, those there was a capability
	_for_, anyway :-). Plugging this into a remote machine can
	do wonders for editing on a slow connection.
