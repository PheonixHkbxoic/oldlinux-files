GNUPLOT 3.1:
------------

I have included two files:
    - gnuplot.tar.Z is the original gnuplot 3.1 distribution.
    - gnuplot.cdiff is the necessary patches to run gnuplot under
      linux. It includes the current version of VGAlib (vgalinux.c
      and vgalinux.h), a new terminal driver (term/linux.trm) and
      a couple of minor fixes.
To compile and run gnuplot you need the following:
    - The 0.96 kernel or newer 
    - GCC 2.11 or newer
All you need to do is to apply the patches and compile:
    - "cd gnuplot"
    - "patch -p2 <gnuplot.cdiff" 
    - "make linux"
