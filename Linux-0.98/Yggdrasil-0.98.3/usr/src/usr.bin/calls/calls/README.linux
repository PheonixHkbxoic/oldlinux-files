Calls is a very nice program which will print out the calling pattern
(which function calls what) of a C program (in one or multiple files).

Originally from the net. Major revisions by Kevin Braunsdorf, PUCC.

Ported to Linux (mainly ANSIfications and gcc stuff) by Sotiris Vassilopoulos

- Enjoy

PS. The included binary was compiled using the -static option. If
you have gcc 2.1 or above, use the included Makefile to produce a
shared-lib executable.
