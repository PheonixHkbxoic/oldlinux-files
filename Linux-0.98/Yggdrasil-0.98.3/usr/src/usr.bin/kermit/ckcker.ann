We are very pleased to announce the availability of C-Kermit version 5A,
edit 179, for public Beta testing.  Over three years in the making, C-Kermit
5A was written by Frank da Cruz of Columbia University with contributions
from hundreds of other programmers all over the world.  Its major new
features include:

ADVANCED KERMIT FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL

Sliding window packet protocol, up to 31 window slots, for improved
efficiency, especially on connections with long delays (public networks,
satellites, etc).  The maximum packet size has been increased to 9024.
Sliding windows and long packets can be used together.  Using combinations
of long packets and sliding windows, file transfer efficiencies up to about
95% can be achieved (and more when Kermit can compress the data).

CHARACTER-SET TRANSLATION

C-Kermit translates character sets during text-file transfer and terminal
emulation.  Most Roman-alphabet-based character sets are supported, as well
as Cyrillic character sets and Japanese Kanji.  A new locking-shift
mechanism is provided for efficient transfer of Kanji and other
predominantly 8-bit character sets in the 7-bit communication environment.

SCRIPT LANGUAGE PROGRAMMING

C-Kermit now has a powerful and easy-to-use script programming language
similar to MS-DOS Kermit's.  Write script programs to automate your logins,
interact automatically with remote computers or services, and even run your
scripts late at night, unattended, when phone rates are lower and networks
less congested.

NETWORK SUPPORT

On UNIX computers that have Berkeley Sockets libraries and a TCP/IP
connection, and on VAX/VMS systems with TGV MultiNet, C-Kermit now can make
TCP/IP TELNET connections.  Unlike regular TELNET, C-Kermit brings its
script language capabilities and character-set translation ability to the
Internet world.  And unlike FTP, C-Kermit can translate text file character
sets as part of the file transfer process.  On SUN computers with SunLink
X.25, X.25 connections are also supported.

SYSTEMS SUPPORTED BY C-KERMIT

C-Kermit 5A is available for the following platforms:

 - Most known variations of UNIX including V7, 2.x BSD, 4.x BSD, AT&T
   System III and System V R2, R3, and R4, POSIX, Ultrix, SUNOS, NeXT OS, AIX,
   HP-UX, DGUX, IRIX, SCO XENIX, DNIX, UMAX, RTU, DYNIX, PTX, etc, etc, on
   hardware platforms of all makes, models, sizes, and shapes
 - VAX/VMS, including a completely new RMS interface
 - OS/2 1.3 and 2.0
 - Commodore Amiga
 - Atari ST
 - OS-9

Full ANSI C and/or POSIX compliance can be selected.

HOW TO GET IT

C-Kermit 5A(179) BETA is available on the Internet via anonymous ftp from host
watsun.cc.columbia.edu [128.59.39.2], using text (ASCII) mode, in the
directory kermit/test, and on BITNET/EARN from host CUVMA through the KERMSRV
file server, in the T: area.  Warning: some files might have records longer
than 80, making it impossible for KERMSRV to MAIL them to you.

You can also order C-Kermit 5A on magnetic media (9-track tape, TK50
cartridge, or quarter-inch tape cartridge) from Columbia University by mail
order as "Tape T" (see the order form, kermit/a/aaxfly.doc or aaxfly.ps).

The C-Kermit filenames all start with the letters "ck" (for C-Kermit).  The
third letter in the filename is used for grouping: c = Portable C, u =
UNIX-specific, v = VAX/VMS-specific, etc.  The following sections give
brief synopses of the files you will need for each version.  A detailed
description of the file naming conventions and organization is given in the
file ckaaaa.hlp.  Notation:

    *   = match any string of characters
  [abc] = match the single character a, b, or c

ALL VERSIONS

All C-Kermit versions include the files ckc*.c, ck*.h, and ckcpro.w.  These
files implement the Kermit file transfer protocol.  The user manual is
ckuker.doc (plain text), ckuker.ps (postscript).  It applies to all
versions, but (so far) includes system-specific information only for UNIX,
VAX/VMS, OS/2, Amiga, and OS-9.

THE UNIX VERSION

  UNIX sources:     ck[cuw]*.[cwh]
  UNIX build:       ckuker.mak (for 2.1xBSD, use ckubs2.mak)
  UNIX executable:  (none, build from source code)
  UNIX doc:         ckuker.doc, ckuker.ps

To build the UNIX version, rename ckuker.mak (or ckubs2.mak) to makefile,
read the comments at the top of the makefile to select the make-option
appropriate for your computer, and then give the appropriate "make" command,
for example "make bsd", "make sunos41", "make sys5r4", etc.  Read the file
ckuins.doc for further instructions and hints.

  There is also a compressed tar archive of the UNIX sources in
  kermit/bin/cku179.tar.Z, which you can ftp in BINARY mode: 595K.

THE VAX/VMS VERSION

This version is not quite finished.  Work on an interrupt-driven
communications I/O module is still in progress.  However, the file system
interface is more or less complete, and is quite advanced, thanks to endless
and unenviable hours of work by Terry Kennedy of St Peter's College in New
Jersey.  The result is quite usable, provided you don't push the
communications too hard (very long packets and/or big sliding window sizes),
especially on small, slow, or old VAXes.

A special feature of VMS C-Kermit 5A is called "labeled files", which allows
VMS files of any type to be transmitted to a foreign system and then
brought back to a VMS system with all their attributes and formats intact --
or for that matter, between two VMS systems directly.

  VMS sources:      ck[cuwv]*.[cwh], plus ckvcvt.c (labeled-file decoder)
  VMS build:        ckvcdt.com plus ckvker.com (DCL), ckvker.mak (VMS MAKE),
                    or ckvker.mms (DEC MMS)
  VMS executable:   ckvker.hex, use ckvdeh.mar to decode it into .EXE format.
  VMS doc:          ckuker.doc, ckuker.ps

THE OS/2 VERSION

C-Kermit was originally adapted to OS/2 by Chris Adie, of Edinburgh University
in Scotland in 1988.  Kai Uwe Rommel of the Technical University of Munich in
Germany has brought Chris's version up to date and added many new features in
the bargain.  This program runs in an OS/2 window under both OS/2 1.3 and 2.0,
performs VT102 emulation complete with key mapping, screen rollback, etc.

  OS/2 sources:     ck[cuwo]*.[cwh], ckwart.def, ckoker.def
  OS/2 build:       ckoker.mak
  OS/2 executable:  ckoker.boo (unboo with ckbunb.c), kermit/bin/ckoker.exe
  OS/2 doc:         ckuker.doc, ckuker.ps

THE COMMODORE AMIGA VERSION

The adaptation of C-Kermit 5A to the Amiga was handled by Steve Walton,
California State University at Northridge.  The original adaptation (for
C-Kermit 4E) was done by Jack Rouse of the "Software Distillery" in 1986.
The files are:

  Amiga sources:    ck[cuwi]*.[cwh]
  Amiga build:      ckiker.mak (use Aztec C V5.0b)
  Amiga executable: ckiker.boo, kermit/bin/ckiker.exe
  Amiga doc:        ckuker.doc, ckuker.ps

THE ATARI ST VERSION

This one is hot off the press, just in from Bruce J Moore of Allen-Bradley
Company in Highland Heights, Ohio.  This is not a desktop application; it
must be run under a character-mode shell like msh (which comes with Mark
Williams C), gulam, ksh, or bash.

  Atari ST sources: ck[cuws]*.[cwh]  (Mark Williams C)
  Atari build:      cksker.mak
  Atari executable: cksker.boo (decode with ckbunb.c), kermit/bin/cksker.ttp
  Atari doc:        cksker.bwr (more coming)

THE OS-9 VERSION

OS-9 is a UNIX variant from Microware Systems Corporation, designed mainly
for the real-time processing environment, mostly on Motorola CPUs.  C-Kermit
5A was adapted to OS-9/68K by Christian Hemsing, RWTH Aachen, Germany, and
Bob Larson of the University of Southern California.

  OS-9 sources:     ck[cuw9]*.[cwh]
  OS-9 build:       ck9ker.mak or ck9ker.gcc
  OS-9 executable:  (None, build from source code using cc or gcc)
  OS-9 doc:         ckuker.doc, ckuker.ps

OTHER VERSIONS

Macintosh Kermit is not at BETA level yet.  Much work remains to be done and
is, in fact, underway at this moment.  Announcements to come in forthcoming
Info-Kermit Digest issues.

Previous editions of C-Kermit were available for Apollo Aegis and Data General
AOS/VS.  The Aegis version appears to be pretty much dead; most people run
a UNIX-like environment on Apollos now, under SR10.  The Apollo SR10 UNIX
environments are fully supported by the UNIX version.

Work on updating the Data General AOS/VS support has recently begun.  Watch
this space for announcements.

Anybody who might have plans to adapt C-Kermit to any other kind of system,
please contact us first so we can keep all efforts coordinated.

DOCUMENTATION

Much of the documentation listed below needs additional work.  Improved
documentation will be announced as it becomes available.

  ckaaaa.hlp   Explanation of file naming conventions
  ckaplm.doc   C-Kermit "program logic manual"
  ckuker.ann   This message
  ckuker.doc   plain-text user manual, UNIX and VMS
  ckuker.ps    Postscript user manual, UNIX and VMS
  ckuker.mss   Scribe source for user manual + ckuhdr.mss
  ckuker.nr    UNIX man page, NROFF source (NEEDS WORK!)
  ckuins.doc   UNIX and VMS installation instructions, plain text
  ckuker.bwr   UNIX and VMS "Beware file", plain text
  ckvker.bwr   VAX/VMS-specific "beware file", plain text (mostly obsolete?)
  ckvker.hlp   VAX/VMS help file, for VMS HELP command (needs updates)
  ckiker.bwr   Amiga beware file
  ck9ker.bwr   OS-9 beware file
  ckuker.upd   C-Kermit program update history, plain text, BIG

As you might guess from the contents of this message, C-Kermit has grown
considerably in size and complexity since version 4E.  Consequently, many of
its features are now deselectable via feature-selection switches at compile
time: network support, script programming language, character sets, etc.  This
is necessary when the target computer (or compiler or linker) does not have
the capacity (memory or address space) to support this version in its full
glory.  The feature-removal techniques are documented in the file
ckuins.doc, and the various build procudures (UNIX makefile, etc) show which
(if any) features are removed from which versions.  In most versions, the
SHOW VERSION command also lists which features are present and which are
absent.

WHAT NEXT?

As far as features are concerned, this is the end of C-Kermit 5A.  Bugs will
be fixed, support for various systems will be updated, and then it will
replace version 4E(072) as the standard, supported, released version.  New
features will be added to future releases.

Please report successes or failures to Frank da Cruz, FDCCU@CUVMA.BITNET
or fdc@watsun.cc.columbia.edu.
