This is the periodic commands I use: at and atrun.  To install,
untar this into /src/at (or wherever), make sure the directories in
the install script are OK with you (and match what's in at.h), su to
root, and do "./install".  If you just type "install", you'll get a
lot of garbage as bash tries to execute /bin/install. :(

After the install script has done it's dirty work (you *did* look at
it, didn't you??), you need to do two things to make this all work.
look on your favorite unix box).  Place "* * * * * /usr/lib/atrun"
in root's cron file somewhere, so that atrun gets run every minute.

You're done!

If someone could kindly provide man pages, I'd be forever in their debt. :)
