This directory contains the BSD sources for uuencode and uudecode,
modified for compilation on a SYSV box, along with the executables.

The file Makefile.sysv is used for creating and installing the executables
on linux.

The file uuencode.man should be copied to your catman directory, it is
the formatted output of uuencode.1.  Also, this should be linked to uudecode
(one man page for both of them.)

The file uuencode.forma (should be named uuencode.format.5, but we only
have 14 letters) is the source for the man page describing the 
uuencode/uudecode file format.
