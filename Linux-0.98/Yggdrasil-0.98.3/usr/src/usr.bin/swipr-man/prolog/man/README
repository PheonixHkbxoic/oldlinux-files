				MANUAL

This directory includes the LaTeX sources of  the  manual.   The  actual
source files are named *.doc and are converted into .tex files using the
sed(1)  script  `totex'.  `tex' is supposed to create the entire manual.

Copyright to this manual is owned  by  Jan  Wielemaker.   Holders  of  a

It is not allowed to change the title, the author,  the  institution  or

These manual sources are also used to produce the  online  manual.   The
online  manual  is  updated  by running the script `online'.  The online
manual is produced by having TeX producing the entire document in  fixed
font  and extract the formatted text using dvi2tty, of which the sources
are included in the subdirectory dvy2tty.
