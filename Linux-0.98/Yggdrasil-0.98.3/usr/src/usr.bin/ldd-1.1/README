Version 1.1:  5 July 1992

Here is an updated version of my ldd program.  The original one would
fail, sometimes with a core dump, when run on shell scripts.  This new
version tries to make sure that a file is executable before trying to 
exec it.  The error messages are slighttly more descriptive now also.

Version 1.0:  18 May 1992

I've heard several people asking for an ldd program for Linux.  Well,
I finally broke down and wrote one!  For those who don't know, ldd is
a program which prints the shared libraries required to run specified
programs.

Here's how it works.  Ldd forks and execs each program with argc equal
to zero.  The code which normally loads the shared libraries, notices
this special case and simply prints the required libraries and exits.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  Ldd will NOT work with some very old programs which
were linked before ldd support was added to the compiler releases.  If
you use ldd on one of these programs, the program will attempt to run 
with argc = 0 and the results will be unpredictable.

Please let me know about any problems.  Enjoy!
