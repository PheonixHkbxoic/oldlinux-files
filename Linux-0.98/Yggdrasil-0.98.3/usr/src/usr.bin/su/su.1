.TH SU 1 "LINUX"
.SH NAME
su - substitute user id
.SH SYNOPSIS
su [ -Kflm ] [ login ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Su requests the password for login
(or for `login root', if no login is provided), and switches to
that user and group ID.
A shell is then invoked.
Su currently uses only the local password file to find the password for
login.
If su is executed by root, no password is requested and a shell
with the appropriate user ID is invoked.
.PP
By default, the environment is unmodified with the exception of
USER, HOME, SHELL.
HOME and SHELL are set to the target login's default values.
USER is set to the target login, unless the target login has a user ID of 0,
in which case it is unmodified.
.PP
The invoked shell is always /bin/sh.
This NOT is the traditional behavior of su.
.SH OPTIONS
The options are as follows:
.br
.EX "-l" "Simulate a full login."
.br
The environment is discarded except for
HOME, SHELL, PATH, TERM, and USER.
HOME and SHELL are modified as above.
USER is set to the target login.
PATH is set to `:/usr/gnu/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/etc:/local/bin'.
TERM is imported from your current environment.
The invoked shell is the target login's, and su
will change directory to the target login's home directory.
All system and user initialization files will be run.
Only users in group 0 (normally `root') can
su to `root'.
.SH BUGS
Su currently allows ONLY members of the same group to su.
Su does not care about the shell field in the passwd file.
The path in bash(1) is compiled-in.
.SH FILES
