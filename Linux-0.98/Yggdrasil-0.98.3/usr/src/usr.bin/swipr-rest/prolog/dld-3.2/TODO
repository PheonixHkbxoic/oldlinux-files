shrink the size of the online symbol table and relocation info by
removing the unnecessary items: (all nlist for the debugging info, and
the reloc info for the local symbols).

higher level interface to the symtab and unlink functions
	call_func (func, args);

add in support to link (mmap) in SunOS 4's shared library.

*maybe* : provide support for multiple symbol tables--kind of like the
idea of "package" as in Lisp.  This allows different package to define
the same global symbol and so on.  But don't know how this should be
intergrate with C's scope rules, or if there is any conflict with
them.  Need to think about this more.
