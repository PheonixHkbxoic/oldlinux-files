Remaining problems in SWI-Prolog

* Communication about times is a mess at the moment.  Best solution seems
  to pass all times as a real and to supply some conversion functions
  to get the day, month, etc.

  See time/6, get_time/1, time_file/2 and time_source_file/2.

* Specification of machine capabilities is not very structured at
  the moment. Best solution seems to be the GNU solution, using md files.
  Using GNU make to structure things might be wise.

* The standard loaded library facilities get a bit of a mess.  A
  better idea might be to take out many of the functions and use dynamic
  library loading instead.  Another idea is to put the entire system in
  a module called system, so the user can abolish it whenever appropriate,
  without cripling the system itself.

* Still, we have to search for a solution to garbage collection
  while foreign code is active.
