The GNU Copyright is applyed here and to the programs.

This couple of programs implement a simple split system for a floppy

The problem is that Linux don't have a EOF in the floppy device
( This is reasonable since the EOF is the end of floppy itself)
This create problems when you want to backup short files or files
that are longer than one disk.

Both diskbackup and diskrestore work with stdin/stdout and use
stderr for messages with the operator. This make possible to 
pipe tar in one end or another and avoid to create BIG files

Ex: To backup a complete disk you can use
NOTE: /tmp is used for the temp file by diskbackup ( A file as big as
a floppy ) and therefore we don't want to backup /tmp

cd /
tar -cf - bin etc dev usr home var | compress | diskbackup "Backup at day one"

Note that The variable FLOPPYDISK must be set to a valid disk
The program assumes 1.44 disks and therefore the device to use is
FLOPPYDISK=/dev/PS0; export FLOPPYDISK

To restore the disk just type

cd /
diskrestore | compress -d | tar -xf -
