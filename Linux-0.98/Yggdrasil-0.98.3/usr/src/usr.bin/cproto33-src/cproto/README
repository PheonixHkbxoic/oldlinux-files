This is Chin Huang's cproto v3.3.  I took strstr.o out of the
list of OBJECTS files in the Makefile, and I added -O2 to CFLAGS.
Also, I had to lex and yacc on another unix machine so don't remove
the y.tab.c and lex.yy.c files.

=====================================================================

Cproto is a program that generates function prototypes and variable
declarations from C source code.  It can also convert function
definitions between the old style and the ANSI C style.  This conversion
overwrites the original files, so make a backup copy of your files in
case something goes wrong.

The program isn't confused by complex function definitions as much as
other prototype generators because it uses a yacc generated parser.  By
ignoring all the input between braces, I avoided implementing the entire
C language grammar.

Cproto is in the public domain.  If you have any comments or find any
bugs, please let me know.
