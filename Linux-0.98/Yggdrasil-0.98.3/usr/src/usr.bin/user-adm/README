This is my contribution to the Linux effort.

This tar file contains TCSH scripts to do simple USER management under Linux.

The reason why I am using TCSH is because the /bin/sh program in the 0.95c
root image seems to be buggy.  Nevertheless, it shouldnt be too hard to 
convert scripts.

The scripts made use of the programs getpass (based on Craig Hagan's adduser)
and PWGET/GRGET developed by HP (but free).

The following scripts are available:


    adduser

	Creates a new user account.  Sets up the home directory and
	copies any dot or rc files that might be necessary

    addgroup

	Creates a new user group

    deluser

	Deletes an user.  If the -R option is specified, it will
	also delete the user home directory.

    delgroup

	Removes a group from /etc/group

You should install this files in /usr/etc and create a directory
/usr/etc/lib to contain the default user configurations.
The /usr/etc/lib/generic contains the rc files that are always needed.
There should be also /usr/etc/SHELL where SHELL is the name of each of
the supported shells.  Also, compile the pwget/grget and getpass
programs and put them somewhere in the path.

adduser and addgroup have interactive modes that are easy to use.
deluser and delgroup require the group or user to be deleted to be
specified in the argument.  deluser also has the -R option.
