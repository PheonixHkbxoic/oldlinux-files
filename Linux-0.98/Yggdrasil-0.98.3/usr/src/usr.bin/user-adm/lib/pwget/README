These utilities provided a common command level access to /etc/group and
/etc/passwd much in the same way as getgrent(), getpwent(), et al.

This is especially useful if your system is running NFS and Yellow Pages.

With Yellow pages, there is no easy command level interface for this
information that will give you the same results as the libc routines.

These routines use "getopt()" so make sure your system has it.

Edit the Makefile for your machine/os and for the owner, group, mode
and destination of the binary and the man page.

Install with: make install.
