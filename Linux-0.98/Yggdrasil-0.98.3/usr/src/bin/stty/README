This functions like normal stty but has several extra features.

You can start up a program on a terminal:

stty [desired modes] -a [device name] -e [command] [arguments]

For example:

stty sane 2400 cs8 -a /dev/tty2 -e /bin/sh

Additional flags:
 
stty -r "command"      executes the command in the new mode and then restores
                       the old mode.

stty -b                hangup modem before execution (drop baud rate to 0).
stty -h                hangup modem after execution.
 These don't work at the present time since linux doesn't have modem control
 yet.

Its likely that there are still some bugs, if you run across any please
