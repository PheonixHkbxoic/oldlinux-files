   NAME
     dvilj2, dvilj2p, dvilj, dviljp, dvi3812 - convert dvi files to HP Laser-
     Jet or IBM 3812 format

   SYNOPSIS
     dvi2lj [-afontpath] [-b ] [-ccopies] [-dmode] [-D]  [-eoutput  file]  [-
     ffrompage]  [-g]  [-hheader  file]  [-l]  [-mmag] [-ppages] [-q] [-r] [-
     ttopage] [-spagesize] [-v] [-w] [-xxoff(mm)] [-yyoff(mm)] [-Xxoff(dots)]
     [-Yyoff(dots)] [-z] [filename]

   DESCRIPTION
     Dvilj2 converts TeX-output .dvi files into HP PCL (i.e. HP Printer  Con-
     trol  Language)  commands  suitable  for  printing on a HP LaserJet+, HP
     LaserJet II and fully compatible printers.
     Dvilj2p converts TeX-output .dvi files into HP PCL commands suitable for
     printing  on  a HP LaserJet IIp, HP LaserJet III or HP Laserjet 2000 and
     fully compatible printers. This version uses a newer PCL command set and
     provides landscape printing.
     Dviljp and dvilj are similar to dvilj2p and dvilj2 but they support only
     128  character  fonts. They may be used for Laserjet clones which do not
     support 256 character fonts.
     Dvi3812 converts TeX-output .dvi files into PMP files, the  native  com-
     mand language of the IBM 3812 page printer.
     All programs are generated from the same source dvi2xx.c.  They are usu-
     ally called by a shell script or as a line printer filter.


   OPTIONS

     -afontpath
          directory to take fonts from (alternative to  environment  variable
          TEXPXL); see below for details about the font directory structure

     -b
          take paper for first page from alternate cassette (only 3812)

     -cnumber
          print each page number times (including original)

     -dnumber
          print in duplex mode. The option -d1 means long edge  binding,  -d2
          stands  for short edge binding. This option is only selectable from
          dvilj2p, and works only on a LaserJet IId or a LaserJet IIId.

     -D
          Double-sided printing - see below; -D1 prints odd sides  only,  -D2
          is  for  even pages, a trailing - suppresses printing of empty pad-
          ding pages.

     -eoutput file
          default output filename is the basename of dvi file  and  extension
          '.lj' for laserjet and '.pmp' for 3812. The '-e' option can be used
          to override this default and to direct the output  to  a  different


                                                                            1






   DVILJ2(1)


          file.  If the output filename is set to '-` (option '-e-') the out-
          put is directed to stdout and can be directly piped into a spooler.

     -fpage number
          start printing at top of given page number

     -g
          go - do not reset printer at start of job

     -hheader file
          headerfile to be copied before translation of  dvi-file.   Used  to
          send arbitrary commands to the laserprinter.

     -l
          landscape - print output in landscape mode. This option is provided
          only for dvilj2p and dvi3812.

     -mmagnification
          Specifiy the magnification to use. The following are available:
          -m#usermag  e.g. #1200
          -m0  equivalent to -m#1000
          -mh  equivalent to -m#1095
          -m1  equivalent to -m#1200
          -mq  equivalent to -m#1250
          -m2  equivalent to -m#1440
          -m3  equivalent to -m#1728
          -m4  equivalent to -m#2074
          -m5  equivalent to -m#2488

     -pnumber of pages
          print given number of pages

     -q
          quiet operation

     -r
          toggle  reverse/not  reverse  order   for   output.    By   default
          reverse=FALSE for 3812, reverse=TRUE for laserjet.

     -spagesize
          Spezify pagesize (LJ-family only!)
          -s1:  executive         (7.25in * 10.5in)
          -s2:  letter             (8.5in * 11in)
          -s3:  legal              (8.5in * 14in)
          -s26: A4                 (210mm * 297mm)
          -s80: monarch          (3.875in * 7.5in)
          -s81: commercial-10    (4.125in * 9.5in)
          -s90: international DL   (110mm * 220mm)
          -s91: international C5   (162mm * 229mm)
          All values are from the LJ II technical reference manual.   If  the
          -s  commandline  option  is omitted no clipping is performed at the
          bottom of the page.

          laserjet)

     If no arguments are specified a short help file is displayed.

   font directory structure
     The specified fontpath may contain more than directory names. Under Unix
     the  direcory  names  are separated by a ':', under MSDOS by a ';'.  The
     paths are searched from left to right. For each directory in  the  sear-
     chpath the following font naming conventions are tried:
     - dpi<resolution>/<fontname>.pk (eg: ./dpi300/cmr10.pk)
     - dpi<resolution>/<fontname>.pxl (eg: ./dpi300/cmr10.pxl)
     - pxl<magnification>/<fontname>.pk (eg: ./pxl1500/cmr10.pk)
     - pxl<magnification>/<fontname>.pxl (eg:./pxl1500/cmr10.pxl)
     - <fontname>.<resolution>pk (eg: ./cmr10.300pk)
     - <fontname>.<resolution>pxl (eg: ./cmr10.300pxl)
     - <fontname>.<resolution> (eg: ./cmr10.300)

   \special commands
     Two TeX '\special' commands are implemented:

     \special{file=<filename>}
          copy specified file to  the  printer;  either  vector-  or  bitmap-
          graphics PMP commands (for laserjet and 3812)

     \special{orientation=<value>}
          set page orientation to 0, 1, 2,  3;  rotate  following  output  to
          landscape mode etc.  (3812 only).



                                                                            3

     others:
     There are a few other special  commands  implented  for  the  LJ-series,
     which should only be used in connection with the distributed style files
     (eg graybox.sty). They are likely to be changed in forthcoming versions.

   Double Page Printing
     The command line option -D causes the printer  to  print  in  doublepage
     mode,  that  is  -  roughly speaking - printing first the even pagen and
     then the odd pages of a document.  If -D is used to print both even  and
     odd  pages  (-D  is used without the optional 1 or 2) the following will
     happen after half of the pages is printed:

     3812: the printer beeps, shows message U1. An operator has to refill the
           printed  pages into the paper tray and to push the continue button
           on the printer.

     LJ:   the printer stops, shows message "FEED"  and  switches  on  manual
           feed  led. The printer continues when either the printed pages are
           fed into the manual page feeder, or the operator pushes  the  con-
           tinue button (after placing first the printed pages into the paper
           tray).

     If -D1 was specified only odd pages will be printed, -D2 can be used for
     even  pages. A trailing `-' (as in -D-, -D1- or -D2-) supresses printing
     of empty pages which are generated for padding otherwise.

     The driver allows the -D option for both print-directions (front-to-back
     or back-to-front printing). It tries to be clever in certain cases: when
     a document has an odd number of pages it inserts in the right  place  an
     empty  page  when  a  document  starts with page 0 the driver inserts an
     empty page after the 0-page when a piece of a document is  printed  that
     starts  with  an even page-number it prints this page at the backside of
     the first page to ensure that the odd sides are always on the frontside.
     The 0-page is treated like an odd page.

     The doubleside option works for all LJs, not only for the  new  D  model
     with  does  doubleside-printing  (actually, i don't know wether it makes
     much sense on the new LJ II D at all).

     Caveat on the doubleside-option: When it is used frequently or  on  very
     large  files,  it  might become necessary to clean the printer much more
     frequently.

     The command line option -pX can be used to abort printing after the out-
     put of X pages (can lead to strange results together with -D). I person-
     ally dislike this option. The secure way of printing a part of  a  docu-
     ment is using -f (from) and -t (to).

   ENVIRONMENT
     The environment variable TEXPXL can be used to specify one or more paths
     to  the  raster fonts (.pk, .pxl). The path separator under Unix is ':',
     under MSDOS ';'. GF-fonts can  be  used  when  the  source  is  compiled
     without the preprocessor switch USEPIXEL set.
