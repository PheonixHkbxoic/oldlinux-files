Dear user of the dvi2xx driver for the ibm3812 and the lj-family!
The new release (0.51) features in the following points:
 
The following items are changed since 0.50:
        - MakeTeXPK support:
          If a pk-file is not found on the fontpath the script
          MakeTeXPK (included in the distribution) is executed to 
          generate the pk file in the requited magnification.
        - a bug fix for clipping 1 pixel to much on the paper edge
          (thanks to  TeX spieler@linac.ikp.physik.th-darmstadt.de
          (Christian Spieler) 
        - better handling of large bitmap glyphs (reduced memory
          assumption esp. in dvilj2p)
        - vms support (thanks to Henk de Haan <HAAN@IRIMCF.TUDELFT.NL>)
        - various cleanups in the code
        - better handling of negative page numbers
        - support for 3b2 machines (strange c compiler)

        - a sample bsd-stype printcap entry for SunOS (thanks to Ted

          Stefan Essers contribution in comp.lang.perl)
        - 2up.sty (from tvz@zandtwerk.Princeton.EDU (Timothy Van Zandt))
          which allows to print LaTeX documents in two-up style (two
