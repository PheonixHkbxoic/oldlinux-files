			Getty 2.0 manual page files.

This README describes the files used and created by the Makefile.

In general, a file with a `.m4' extension is nroff source intersperced
with m4 macros.  These files are processed by m4 to yield nroff-able
files, and use the macros to create man pages whose content matches the
way you've configured your getty/uugetty executables.  Running m4 on
the .m4 files produce ready-for-nroff files with either a `.1m', `.3'
or `.4' extension, depending upon the chapter to which the man page
belongs.  The makefile will also run nroff on these files, producing
files with a `.man' extension, by saying "make man".

After running make in this directory, you will have the following files:

	getty.1m	nroff-ready man page for getty
	getty.man	nroff'd getty man page
	gettytab.4 *	nroff-ready man page for the gettytab file
	gettytab.man *	nroff'd gettytab man page
	issue.4		nroff-ready man page for the issue file
	issue.man	nroff'd issue man page

* Note: the name `gettytab' will be replaced by the actual name you
  assigned for that file -- usually `gettydefs'.

Also, you may have some (or all) of the following files, depending upon
the configuration of your Unix/Xenix.  These files describe library
routines used by getty that were not found in your libc.a (and thus
homegrown versions were used):

	getutent.3	nroff-ready man page for getutent(3)
	getutent.man	nroff'd getutent man page
	strdup.3	nroff-ready man page for strdup(3)
	strdup.man	nroff'd strdup man page
	putenv.3	nroff-ready man page for putenv(3)
	putenv.man	nroff'd putenv man page

You will need to manually install the man pages.  Use either the .{1m,3,4}
(pre-nroff) or .man (post-nroff) files, according to the needs of your
system.
