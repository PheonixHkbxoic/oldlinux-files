There are potential legal problems with three TrueType-related files that
were distributed as part of Release 5.  The files are:

mit/fonts/server/MacFS/Font_DA_Mover
mit/fonts/server/MacFS/TrueType
mit/fonts/server/MacFS/TrueType Fonts

Please apply the patch given below, and remove all copies of these files
from your system.

Please be advised that use or redistribution of these files could result
in legal action being taken against you.

We regret any inconvenience.


To apply this patch:

cd to the top of the source tree (to the directory containing the "mit"
and "contrib" subdirectories) and do:
	rm -f mit/fonts/server/MacFS/Font_DA_Mover
	rm -f mit/fonts/server/MacFS/TrueType
	rm -f 'mit/fonts/server/MacFS/TrueType Fonts'
	patch -p -s < ThisFile
Patch will work silently unless an error occurs.  No rebuild is required
after applying this patch.
