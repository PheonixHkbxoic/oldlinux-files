DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _X_d_v_i is a program which runs under the X window system. It
       is used to preview DVI files, such as are produced by TeX.

       This  program  has  the  capability  of  showing  the file
       shrunken by various (integer)  factors,  and  also  has  a
       ``magnifying  glass'' which allows one to see a small part
       of the unshrunk image momentarily.

       Before displaying any page or part thereof, it  checks  to
       see if the dvi file has changed since the last time it was
       displayed.  If this is the case, then _x_d_v_i will reinitial-
       ize  itself for the new dvi file.  For this reason, expos-
       ing parts of the _x_d_v_i window while _T_e_X is  running  should
       be  avoided.  This feature allows you to preview many ver-
       sions of the same file while running _x_d_v_i only once.

       In addition to using keystrokes to move within  the  file,
       _x_d_v_i  provides  buttons  on  the right side of the window,
       which are synonymous with various sequences of keystrokes.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       In  addition  to specifying the .ddvvii file (with or without
       the .ddvvii), _X_d_v_i supports the following  command  line  op-
       tions.   If the option begins with a `++' instead of a `--',
       the option is restored to its default value.  By  default,
       these  options  can be set via the resource names given in
       parentheses in the description of each option.

       _+ppaaggee  Specifies the first page to show.  If  _+  is  given
              without  a  number,  the  last page is assumed; the
              first page is the default.

       --ss _s_h_r_i_n_k
              (.shrinkFactor) Defines the initial shrink  factor.
              The default value is 3.

       --SS _d_e_n_s_i_t_y
              (.densityPercent)  Determines the density used when
              shrinking bitmaps for fonts.  A higher  value  pro-

              duces a lighter font.  The default value is 40.

       --ddeennssiittyy _d_e_n_s_i_t_y
              Same as --SS.

       --pp _p_i_x_e_l_s
              (.pixelsPerInch)  Defines  the size of the fonts to
              use, in pixels per inch.  The default value is 300.

       --aallttffoonntt _f_o_n_t
              (.altFont)  Declares a default font to use when the
              font in the dvi file cannot be found.  This is use-
              ful, for example, with PostScript <tm> fonts.

       --ll     (.listFonts)  Causes the names of the fonts used to
              be listed.

       --hhuusshhssppeecciiaallss
              (.hushSpecials) Causes _x_d_v_i  to  suppress  warnings
              about \special strings which it cannot process.

       --hhuusshhcchhaarrss
              (.hushLostChars)  Causes  _x_d_v_i to suppress warnings
              about references to characters which  are  not  de-
              fined in the font.

       --hhuusshh  (.Hush)  Causes  _x_d_v_i  to suppress all suppressable
              warnings.

       --rrvv    (.reverseVideo) Causes the  page  to  be  displayed
              with  white  characters  on a black background, in-
              stead of vice versa.

       --bbww _w_i_d_t_h
              (.borderWidth) Specifies the width of the border of
              the window.

       --bboorrddeerrwwiiddtthh _w_i_d_t_h

       --ffgg _c_o_l_o_r
              (.foreground)  Determines  the  color  of  the text
              (foreground).

       --ffoorreeggrroouunndd _c_o_l_o_r

       --hhll _c_o_l_o_r
              (.highlight)  Determines the color of the page bor-
              der.  The default is the foreground color.

       --bbdd _c_o_l_o_r
              (.borderColor) Determines the color of  the  window
              border.

       --bboorrddeerrccoolloorr _c_o_l_o_r
              Same as --bbdd.

       --ccrr _c_o_l_o_r
              (.cursorColor)  Determines the color of the cursor.
              The default is the color of the page border.

       --tthhoorroouugghh
              (.thorough) _X_d_v_i will usually try  to  ensure  that
              overstrike  characters  (_e_._g_.   \notin) are printed
              correctly.  On monochrome displays, this is  always
              possible  with one logical operation, either _a_n_d or
              _o_r.  On color displays, however, this may take  two
              operations, one to set the appropriate bits and one
              to clear other bits.  If this is the case, then  by
              default  _x_d_v_i  will instead use the _c_o_p_y operation,
              which does not handle overstriking correctly.   The
              ``thorough''  option  chooses  the  slower but more
              correct choice.  See also _-_c_o_p_y, below.

       --ccooppyy  (.copy) Always use the _c_o_p_y operation when  writing
              characters to the display.  This option may be nec-
              essary for correct operation on  a  color  display,
              but overstrike characters will be incorrect.

       --kkeeeepp  (.keepPosition)  Sets  a flag to indicate that _x_d_v_i
              should not move to the home position when moving to
              a new page.  See also the `k' keystroke.

       --eexxppeerrtt
              (.expert)  Prevent the buttons from appearing.  See
              also the `x' keystroke.

       --vveerrssiioonn
              Print information on the version of _x_d_v_i.

       --mmaarrggiinnss _d_i_m_e_n
              (.Margin) Specifies the size of both the top margin
              and  side  margin.  This should be a decimal number
              optionally followed by "cm", e.g., 1.5 or 3cm, giv-
              ing a measurement in inches or centimeters.  It de-
              termines the ``home'' position of the  page  within
              the  window as follows.  If the entire page fits in
              the window, then the margin settings  are  ignored.
              If,  even after removing the margins from the left,
              right, top, and bottom, the page still  cannot  fit

              in  the  window, then the page is put in the window
              such that the top and left margins are hidden,  and
              presumably  the  upper left-hand corner of the text
              on the page will be in the upper  left-hand  corner
              of  the window.  Otherwise, the text is centered in
              the window.  See also `MM' under the KEYSTROKES sec-
              tion.

       --ssiiddeemmaarrggiinn _d_i_m_e_n
              (.sideMargin)   Specifies   the  side  margin  (see
              above).

       --ttooppmmaarrggiinn _d_i_m_e_n
              (.topMargin) Specifies the top and  bottom  margins
              (see above).

       --ooffffsseettss _d_i_m_e_n
              (.Offset) Specifies the size of both the horizontal
              and vertical offsets of the  output  on  the  page.
              This should be a decimal number optionally followed
              by "cm", e.g., 1.5 or 3cm, giving a measurement  in
              inches  or  centimeters.  By decree of the Stanford
              TeX Project, the default TeX page origin is  always
              1 inch over and down from the top-left page corner,
              even  when  non-American  paper  sizes  are   used.
              Therefore, the default offsets are 1.0 inch.

       --xxooffffsseett _d_i_m_e_n
              (.xOffset)  Specifies  the  size  of the horizontal
              offset of the output on the page (see above).

       --yyooffffsseett _d_i_m_e_n
              (.yOffset) Specifies the size of the vertical  off-
              set of the output on the page (see above).

       --ppaappeerr _p_a_p_e_r_t_y_p_e
              (.paper)  Specifies  the  size of the printed page.
              This may be of the form _wx_h (or _wx_hcm), where _w  is
              the  width in inches (or cm) and _h is the height in
              inches (or cm), respectively.  There are also  syn-
              onyms   which   may  be  used:   us  (8.5x11),  usr
              (11x8.5), legal (8.5x14),  foolscap  (13.5x17),  as
              well  as the ISO sizes a1-a7, b1-b7, c1-c7, a1r-a7r
              (a1-a7 rotated), etc.  The default size is 8.5 x 11
              inches.

       --nnooggrreeyy
              (.grey)  Turns  off  the  use  of  greyscale  anti-
              aliasing when printing shrunken bitmaps.  (In  this
              case,  the  logic  of the corresponding resource is
              the reverse: -nogrey corresponds to grey:off;  +no-
              grey to grey:on.)  See also the `G' keystroke.

       --mmggss[[nn]] _s_i_z_e
              (.magnifierSize[n])  Specifies the size of the win-
              dow to be used for  the  ``magnifying  glass''  for
              Button _n.  See the MOUSE ACTIONS section.  Defaults
              are 200, 350, 600, 900, and 1200.

       --mmggss _s_i_z_e
              Same as --mmggss11.

       --ggeeoommeettrryy _g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y
              (*geometry) Specifies the initial geometry  of  the
              window.

       --iiccoonnggeeoommeettrryy _g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y
              (.iconGeometry)  Specifies the initial position for
              the icon.

       --iiccoonniicc
              (.iconic) Causes the XDVI window to  start  in  the
              iconic  state.   The  default  is to start with the
              window open.

       --ddiissppllaayy _h_o_s_t_:_d_i_s_p_l_a_y
              Specifies the host and screen to be used  for  dis-
              playing  the  dvi  file.  This is normally obtained
              from the environment variable ``DISPLAY.''

KKEEYYSSTTRROOKKEESS
       XXddvvii recognizes the following keystrokes when typed in its
       window.  Each may optionally be preceded by a (positive or
       negative) number, whose interpretation will depend on  the
       particular  keystroke.  Also, the "Home", "Prior", "Next",
       and arrow cursor keys are synonyms for `^', `b', `f', `l',
       `r', `u', and `d' keys, respectively.

       qq      Quits the program.  Control-C and control-D will do
              this, too.

       nn      Moves to the next page (or to the nnth next page  if
              a  number  is given).  Synonyms are `ff', Space, Re-
              turn, and Line Feed.

       pp      Moves to the previous page (or back nn pages).  Syn-
              onyms are `bb', control-H, and Delete.

       gg      Moves  to the page with the given number.  Initial-
              ly, the first page is assumed to be page number  1,
              but this can be changed with the `PP' keystroke, be-
              low.  If no page number is given, then it  goes  to
              the last page.

       PP      ``This  is  page  number  nn.''  This can be used to
              make the `gg' keystroke refer to actual page numbers
              instead of absolute page numbers.

       CCoonnttrrooll--LL
              Redisplays the current page.

       ^^      Move to the ``home'' position of the page.  This is
              normally the upper left-hand corner  of  the  page,
              depending  on the margins as described in the -mmaarr--
              ggiinnss option, above.

       uu      Moves up two thirds of a window-full.

       dd      Moves down two thirds of a window-full.

       ll      Moves left two thirds of a window-full.

       rr      Moves right two thirds of a window-full.

       cc      Moves the page so that the point currently  beneath
              the  cursor  is  moved to the middle of the window.
              It also (gasp!) warps the cursor to the same place.

       MM      Sets  the margins so that the point currently under
              the cursor is the upper  left-hand  corner  of  the
              text  in  the  page.  Note that this command itself
              does not move the image at all.  For details on how
              the margins are used, see the -mmaarrggiinnss option.

       ss      Changes  the shrink factor to the given number.  If
              no number is given, the smallest factor that  makes
              the  entire  page  fit  in the window will be used.
              (Margins are ignored in this computation.)

       SS      Sets the density factor to be used  when  shrinking
              bitmaps.   This  should  be  a number between 0 and
              100; higher numbers produce lighter characters.

       RR      Forces the dvi file to be reread.  This allows  you

              `keep-position' flag which, when set, will keep the
              same position when moving between pages.  Also `0k'
              and `1k' clear and  set  this  flag,  respectively.

       If the shrink factor is set to any number other than  one,
       then  clicking any mouse button will pop up a ``magnifying
       glass'' which shows the unshrunk image in the vicinity  of
       the mouse click.  This subwindow disappears when the mouse
       button is released.  Different mouse buttons produce  dif-
       ferent  sized  windows,  as  indicated by the --mmggss option.
       Moving the cursor while holding the button down will  move
       the magnifying glass.

       Also,  the  scrollbars (if present) behave in the standard
       way:  pushing Button 2 in a scrollbar  moves  the  top  or
       left  edge  of  the scrollbar to that point and optionally
       drags it; pushing Button 1 moves the image up or right  by
       an  amount  equal to the distance from the button press to
       the upper left-hand corner of the window; pushing Button 3
       moves the image down or left by the same amount.

       Uses the environment variable ``DISPLAY'' to specify which
       bit map display terminal to use.

       The  environment  variable  ``XDVIFONTS''  determines  the
       path(s)  searched  for fonts in the following manner.  The
       string consists  of  one  or  more  strings  separated  by
       colons.   In  each  such  string,  the substring ``%f'' is
       changed to the font name; ``%d'' is changed to the  magni-
       fication;  and  ``%p''  is  changed  to  the  font  family
       (``gf'', or ``pk'').  If no ``%f'' appears in the
       string,  then the string ``/%f.%d%p'' is added on the end.
       For example, if the string is ``/usr/TeX/tex/fonts'' and
       the  font  is  cmr10 at  300dpi,  then  it  searches  for
       /usr/TeX/tex/fonts/cmr10.300gf, and
       /usr/TeX/tex/fonts/cmr10.300pk,  in that order.  An extra
       colon  anywhere  in the ``XDVIFONTS'' variable causes
       the system default paths to be tried at  that  point.   If
       the  font is not found in the desired size, then _x_d_v_i will
       invoke Metafont to create the font in  the  correct  size.
       Failing  that,  it  will try to find the nearest size.  If
       the font cannot be found at all, then  _x_d_v_i  will  try  to
       vary  the point size of the font (within a certain range),
       and if this fails, then it will use the font specified  as
       the alternate font (cf. --aallttffoonntt).

       For  compatibility with TeX, you may also use ``TEXFONTS''
       in place of ``XDVIFONTS'', although in that case the vari-
       able  should not include any ``%'' specifiers.  The reason
       for recognizing TEXFONTS is that certain versions  of  TeX
       also  support  the  convention regarding an extra colon in
       the font path; therefore, users who create their own fonts
       can  put  both their .tfm and raster files in the same di-
       rectory and do ``setenv TEXFONTS :MFdir'' or ``setenv TEX-
       FONTS MFdir:'' in order to get both TeX and _x_d_v_i to search

       their directory in addition to the system standard  direc-
       tories.   The  XDVIFONTS  variable  overrides the TEXFONTS
       variable, so that on those sites where  TEXFONTS  must  be
       set  explicitly, and therefore this feature is not useful,
       the XDVIFONTS  may  be  set  to  an  empty  string  (_i_._e_._,
       ``setenv XDVIFONTS'') to cause _x_d_v_i to ignore TEXFONTS.

       _x_d_v_i  also  recognizes  the  PKFONTS  variable,  which  is
       checked after XDVIFONTS but before TEXFONTS.

       You can also enable recursive searching in the  font  path
       by  using  the ``*'' and ``**'' specifiers.  At this point
       in the path, _x_d_v_i will recursively  search  subdirectories
       of  the  given  directory  in order to find font files.  A
       single asterisk limits the search to one level;  a  double
       asterisk  will  search through an arbitrary number of lev-
       els.  Also, the variable TEXFONTS_SUBDIR can  be  used  to
       give  a colon-separated list of directories to recursively
       search.  This is equivalent to  including  the  specifiers
       with  a  ``*'' after each; the usual conventions regarding
       extra colons applies here, too, relative to a default sub-
       directory  path.  Asterisks may not be preceded by a ``%''
       specifier in any path component.

       The ``XDVISIZES'' variable must be set to  indicate  which
       sizes of fonts are available.  It should consist of a list
       of numbers separated by colons.  If the list begins with a
       colon,  the system default sizes are used, as well.  Sizes
       are expressed in dots per inch; decimals may be  used  for
       ``pxl''  files: for example, a 300 dots per inch file mag-
       nified by half a step comes out  to  1643  dots  per  five
       inches, which should be encoded as 328.6.  The current de-
       fault set of sizes is 300 : 328.6 : 360 : 432  :  518.4  :
       622  :  746.4.   _x_d_v_i will also try the actual size of the
       font before trying any of the given sizes.

       Virtual fonts are also supported, although _x_d_v_i  does  not
       have  any  built-in  fonts  to  which they can refer.  The
       search path for .vf files can be specified with the  ``XD-
       VIVFS''  environment  variable in a similar manner to that
       for the ``XDVIFONTS'' variable.  _x_d_v_i will also check  the
       VFFONTS  variable  if  the  XDVIFONTS variable is not set.
       Virtual fonts are searched for immediately  after  looking
       for the font as a normal font in the exact size specified.
