README - 0.97 Root Filesystem
Jim Winstead Jr. - 4 August 1992

This root disk is in many ways a bug fix to the 0.96 version - no
significant changes.  Maybe I should charge $50 for it and call it a
major new release - it worked for Microsoft and Windows 3.1.  :)

You should be careful to read all the documentation on the disk.  To
do otherwise could result in an endless number of problems.

Unfortunately, this disk is not very well suited to updating an
existing Linux system.  This will be addressed in future releases.  If
you have suggestions on how this should be done, please send mail to
the address below.
