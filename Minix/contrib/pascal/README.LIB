Modern operating systems should have a C++ compiler. So since
1 1/2 years I program at one. Since 2 weeks a have finished the
work and I can say that it runs under AIX, SUN-OS, SUN-SPARC,
DOS, WINDOWS 3.11, WINDOWS 95, OS/2 WARP 3.0. ***BUT*** not under
Minix. I do not why. I think it is a problem of the library. But 
I do not find the reason. I am still searching like a crazy man
and I hope that I will find it this year. I will write a new C-library
for the C++ compiler. If you have any idea about that, please let me know.

Yours Henrik Quintel
