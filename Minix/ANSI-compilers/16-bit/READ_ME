This directory contains the source of the ACK ANSI C compiler driver, and
the binaries of the compiler and libraries.  You should install the compiler
passes in /bin, /lib, /usr/bin, or /usr/lib, as you wish.  The locations of
the passes have to be defined in ncc.c, which you can then compile and move to
/bin/cc.
