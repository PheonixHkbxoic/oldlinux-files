List of bugs discovered in 1.7.1.  Please report more bugs to kjb@cs.vu.nl.

- The updates to the BIOS driver have only been tested on a few machines.
  If it doesn't work on your machine then type 'processor=86' to the
  Boot Monitor to force Minix into real mode.

- The XT and PS disk drivers do not work, use the BIOS driver instead.

- Disabling all WINI drivers in <minix/config.h> leads to a compilation
  error.  (The definition of NR_TASKS in <minix/const.h> is wrong.)
  Leave at least one of the WINI drivers enabled.

- The AT disk driver uses a scratch buffer in its initialization
  routine that has not been initialized.  This error is masked if the
  Adaptec SCSI driver is initialized first, because it will then
  initialize the scratch buffer for the AT driver.  This is why the
  installation ROOT floppy works.  A kernel with only the AT driver
  fails on an old AT disk, but an IDE disk will seemingly work.  The
  bug will cause the driver to report wrong parameters to 'part'.
  A fix to this bug is found in fixes/fix-1.
