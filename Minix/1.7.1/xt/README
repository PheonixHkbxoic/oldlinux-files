Suggestions on installing Minix on a machine with little memory.

The file TINYROOT is a small replacement for the ROOT image that is
needed if your machine has only one floppy drive and less than 2
megabytes of memory.  You can use it to boot your machine, but you
should use ROOT for the installation if you can.

If your floppy drive is only 360 kb then have to use TINYROOT for ROOT,
and TINYUSR1 for USR.  The very last step of the installation, filling
/usr from USR.nn, will fail, because you need some commands that are on
TINYUSR2.  You have to copy those commands into the /usr tree (mount the
floppy and cpdir the lot).  TINYUSR2 also contains the kernel image
used for TINYROOT in the tmp directory that you can use as /minix.

A machine with only 640 kb memory will have trouble to run the
installation script.  Use

	exec instdist

to overlay the login shell of root with the script.  The USR.nn and
SRC.nn images can be split in two 360 kb pieces with the commands:

	dd if=image of=first-half bs=1k count=360
	dd if=image of=second-half bs=1k skip=360

If you want to compile a new kernel as bin use

	chsh /bin/sh

to change the login shell of bin from ash to the much smaller sh.  Log
out, log back in, and use

	exec make xxx

If it still fails then you have to make things bit by bit by running
make in subdirectories.

Note that you are on your own in this enterprise, anyone mad enough to
still use an XT had better be smart enough to find his own way.  Testing
the TINYXXX stuff has consumed enough of my time.  If you still dare to
ask me questions then you'd better make it very interesting questions.
