A revised version of my IBM PC simulator is available by FTP.  Many thanks
to David Barto for his help in improving it.  The simulator could still
stand improvement, so who knows, maybe your name could be in the posting
of the next revision.

The simulator runs on the SPARC and probably other machines, although this
has not been tested.  It simulates enough I/O gear of the IBM PC that
you can run MINIX 1.1 on the simulator.  The simulator is not perfect,
but may be of some interest to people.  It will not run MS-DOS because
MS-DOS needs a BIOS, and the BIOS is copyrighted, so it is not included
in the simulator.  If you provide your own BIOS, it might work.  This 
has never been tried.  

The simulator is available ONLY by FTP.  It is on ftp.cs.vu.nl (192.31.231.42)
in directory minix/simulator.  There is also other minix stuff in minix/*
as well as Amoeba stuff in Amoeba/* (Amoeba is a distributed operating system).
All the directories have READ_ME files explaining what's in them.

Everything in all the directories is copyright.  Permission is hereby
granted to upload and use the files for educational and research use only.
Other use requires written permission from the copyright owner.
