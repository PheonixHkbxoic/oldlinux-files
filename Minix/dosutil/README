The FDVOL, WrtDsk or RaWrite3 programs can be used under MS-DOS
to copy images to floppies. The FIPS utility can be used to shrink an
MS-DOS partition if the disk of the machine you wish to install Minix
contains a single MS-DOS partition that covers the entire disk. (As is
often the case.) Note that the task of FIPS is not a trivial one, a million
things could go wrong. Back up your data first! 

FDVOL is the preferred utility to make Minix floppy images, WrtDsk and 
RaWrite3 are provided as alternates just in case. (Writing floppies raw is
a tricky thing under DOS.) 

The four utilities are in the files fdvol.exe, wrtdsk90.zip, rawrite3.zip, and 
fips15.zip together with their documentation, except for FDVOL, but its
use is simple: 

        fdvol 1440 A: ROOT USR          - Combine ROOT and USR on one floppy
        fdvol 1440 A: SYS.TAZ           - Put SYS.TAZ on several floppies
        fdvol 720 A: ROOT               - Just ROOT on one 720k floppy
