The <a href="fdvol.exe">FDVOL</a>, <a href="wrtdsk90.zip">WrtDsk</a>
or <a href="rawrite3.zip">RaWrite3</a>
programs can be used under MS-DOS to copy images to floppies.  The
<a href="fips15.zip">FIPS</a> utility can be used to shrink an MS-DOS
partition if the disk of the machine you wish to install Minix contains
a single MS-DOS partition that covers the entire disk.  (As is often
the case.)
Note that the task of FIPS is not a trivial one, a million things could
go wrong.  Back up your data first!

<p>
<b>FDVOL</b> is the preferred utility to make Minix floppy images,
<b>WrtDsk</b> and <b>RaWrite3</b> are provided as alternates just in case.
(Writing floppies raw is a tricky thing under DOS.)

<p>
The four utilities are in the files
<a href="fdvol.exe">fdvol.exe</a>,
<a href="wrtdsk90.zip">wrtdsk90.zip</a>,
<a href="rawrite3.zip">rawrite3.zip</a>,
and <a href="fips15.zip">fips15.zip</a> together with their documentation,
except for <b>FDVOL</b>, but its use is simple:

<pre>
	fdvol 1440 A: ROOT USR		- Combine ROOT and USR on one floppy
	fdvol 1440 A: SYS.TAZ		- Put SYS.TAZ on several floppies
	fdvol 720 A: ROOT		- Just ROOT on one 720k floppy
</pre>
