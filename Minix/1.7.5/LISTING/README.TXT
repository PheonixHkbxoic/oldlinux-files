This directory contains the full source code listing of MINIX in three
different formats:

	LISTING.ASC	- Flat ASCII text
	LISTING.PS	- Postscript file
	LISTING.T	- troff source for making LISTING.PS

An index to the source code is provided in
	INDEX


Note: The listing is designed to be printed in LucidaSans Typewriter.
If you own this font definition, please prepend it to LISTING.PS before
sending it to a PostScript printer. We cannot supply this font because it is
copyright by Bigelow and Holmes.  

If you do not have the font available locally, change the

.fp 5 CW LucidaT

line in LISTING.T to a locally available monospace font (e.g. letter gothic)
and run troff again.

Alternatively, just print LISTING.PS, but it will print in Courier instead
of Lucida.
