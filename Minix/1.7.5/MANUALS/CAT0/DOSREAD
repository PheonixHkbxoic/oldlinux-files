Syntax:    dosread [-a] drive file
Flags:     -a  ASCII file
Examples:  dosread C g/adv >adv     # Read file g/adv from hard disk
           dosread -a A prog.c >x   # Read ASCII file prog.c from  drive
                                      A

     Dosread reads one MS-DOS file and writes  it  on  standard  output.
The file name must use slash, not backslash as a separator.  ASCII files
have the final CTRL-Z stripped, and carriage return plus line  feed  are
mapped to line feed only, the usual MINIX convention.  See dosdir on the
use of single letter drive codes.
