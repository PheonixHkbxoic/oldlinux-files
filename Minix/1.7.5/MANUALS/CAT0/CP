Syntax:    cp [-pifsmrRvx] file1 file2
           cp [-pifsrRvx] file ... directory
           cpdir [-ifvx] file1 file2
Flags:     -p  Preserve full mode, uid, gid and times
           -i  Ask before removing existing file
           -f  Forced remove existing file
           -s  Make similar, copy some attributes
           -m  Merge trees, disable the into-a-directory trick
           -r  Copy directory trees with link structure, etc. intact
           -R  Copy directory trees and treat special files as ordinary
           -v  Display what cp is doing
           -x  Do not cross device boundaries
Examples:  cp oldfile newfile       # Copy oldfile to newfile
           cp -R dir1 dir2          # Copy a directory tree

     Cp copies one file to another, or copies one or  more  files  to  a
directory.   Special  files  are  normally opened and read, unless -r is
used.  -r also copies the link  structure,  something  -R  doesn't  care
about.   The  -s option differs from -p that it only copies the times if
the target file already exists.  A normal copy only copies the  mode  of
the file, with the file creation mask applied.  Set-uid bits are cleared
if the owner cannot be set.  (The -s flag  does  not  patronize  you  by
clearing bits.  Alas -s and -r are nonstandard.)

     Cpdir is a convenient synonym for cp -psmr to make a  precise  copy
of a directory tree.
