Syntax:    ctags [-r] file ...
Flags:     -r  Generate refs as well as tags
Example:   ctags -r *.h *.c         # Generate the tags file

     Ctags generates a tags file from a collection of  C  source  files.
It  can  also  generate  a  refs  file.  The tags file is used by elvis'
':tag' command, and its -t option. Each C source  file  is  scanned  for
#define  statements  and  global  function definitions.  The name of the
macro or function becomes the name of a tag.  For each tag,  a  line  is
added  to  the  tags  file  which  contains:  the name of the tag, a tab
character, the name of the file containing the tag, a tab character, and
a way to find the particular line within the file.

     The refs file is used by the ref program, which can be invoked  via
elvis  K  command.   When  ctags  finds a global function definition, it
copies the function header into the refs file. The first line  is  flush
against  the right margin, but the argument definitions are indented.the
C source files.
