Syntax:    uname [-snrvmpa]
           arch [-snrvmpa]
Flags:     -s  System name
           -n  Node/network name
           -r  Operating system release
           -v  Operating system version
           -m  Machine type
           -p  Processor family
           -a  Short for -snrvm
Examples:  uname -n                 # Print the name of the system
           arch                     #  Print  the  name  of  the  system
                                      architecture

     Uname and arch give information  about  the  system.   The  options
indicate  which  information strings must be printed.  These strings are
always in the same order.  Uname and arch only differ w.r.t. the default
string to print, -s and -p respectively.

     The strings are compiled into the  commands  except  for  the  node
name,  it is obtained from the file /etc/hostname.file.  Uname -m should
return the actual machine type, not the same string as with -p.
