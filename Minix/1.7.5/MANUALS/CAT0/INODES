Syntax:    inodes
Flags:     (none)
Examples:  inodes                   # Print information about file names
                                      typed in
           cd /dev; ls | inodes     #  Print   information   about   the
                                      special files

     Inodes expects a list of file names on stdin,  one  file  name  per
line.   For  each  file  named, the file type, mode, uid, gid, checksum,
length, and name is printed.  The checksum is the same as used  by  crc.
This  program provides a way to see the sizes of the block special files
in /dev, as shown in the second example above.
