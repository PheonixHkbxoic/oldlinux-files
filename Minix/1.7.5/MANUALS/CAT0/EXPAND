Syntax:    expand [-t1,t2, ...] [file]
Flags:     -t  Tab stop positions
Example:   expand -16,32,48,64      # Expand stdin with  tabs  every  16
                                      columns

     Expand replaces tabs in the named files with the equivalent numbers
of  spaces.  If no files are listed, stdin is given.  If only one tab is
given, the rest are multiples of it.  The  default  is  a  tab  every  8
spaces.
