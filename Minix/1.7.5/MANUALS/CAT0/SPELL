     Spell is the MINIX spelling checker. It is actually a  short  shell
script.   First,  the program prep strips off the roff, nroff, and troff
control lines, and the punctuation, and lists each word  on  a  separate
line.   These  words  are  then  sorted.   The  resulting output is then
compared to the dictionary.  Words present in the file but  not  present
in  the  dictionary  are  listed.   The  dictionary  must  be located in
/usr/lib/dict/words.
