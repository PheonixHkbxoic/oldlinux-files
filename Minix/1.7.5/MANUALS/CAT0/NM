Syntax:    nm [-dgnopru] [file] ...
Flags:     -d  Print the offsets in decimal instead of in hex
           -g  Print only external symbols
           -n  Sort numerically rather than alphabetically
           -o  Prepend file name to each line rather than only once
           -p  Do not sort, print in symbol-table order
           -r  Sort in reverse order
           -u  Print only undefined symbols
Examples:  nm -n a.out              # Print  all  symbols  in  numerical
                                      order
           nm -dg a.out             # Print  globals  alphabetically  in
                                      decimal

     Nm  prints  the  symbol  table  of  executable  files  when  it  is
available.   If  no  file  is  given, the symbols in a.out are used. The
format of the table is somewhat compatible with  the  one  produced   by
asld  when  used  with the -s option. The symbol table can be added with
ast. Assembly language files do not have symbol tables.
