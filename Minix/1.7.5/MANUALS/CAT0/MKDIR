Syntax:    mkdir [-p] [-m mode] directory ...
Flags:     -m  Create directory with mode
           -p  Create missing intermediate directories
Examples:  mkdir dir                #  Create   dir   in   the   current
                                      directory
           mkdir -p /user/ast/dir   #   Create   the    /user/ast    and
                                      /user/ast/dir

     The specified directory or directories are created and initialized.
If  any  intermediate  directory  is  missing  and  -p is specified, the
missing component will be created and no error  displayed  if  directory
already  exists.  If  the  -m flag is used, this will be equivalent to a
chmod on the directory after its creation.
