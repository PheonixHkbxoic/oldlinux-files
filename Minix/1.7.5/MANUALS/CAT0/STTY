Syntax:    stty [option ...]
Flags:     (none)
Examples:  stty -echo               # Suppress echoing of input
           stty erase #             # Set the erase character to #

     When  given  no  arguments,  stty  prints  the   current   terminal
parameters.  It can also be used to set the parameters, as follows:

   cbreak   - Enter cbreak mode; erase and kill disabled
   echo     - Echo input on the terminal
   nl       - Accept only line feed to end lines
   raw      - Enter raw mode; no input processing at all
   tabs     - Output tabs (do not expand to spaces)
   erase c  - Set erase character (initially backspace)
   int c    - Set interrupt (SIGINT) character (initially DEL)
   kill c   - Set kill line character (initially @)
   quit c   - Set quit (SIGQUIT) character (initially CTRL-\)
   even     - Use even parity
   odd      - Use odd parity
   [5-8]    - Number of bits per character
   [110-9600] - Baud rate
   default  - Set options back to original values

The first five options may be prefixed by - as  in  -tabs  to  turn  the
option  off.   The  next  four  options  each  have  a  single character
parameter separated by a space from the option.  The default option sets
the  mode  and  the four settable characters back to the values they had
when the system was booted.  It is  useful  when  a  rogue  program  has
messed them up.  For convenience you can specify control characters as a
two character combination:  ^H for instance is a backspace.  The form ^?
is a DEL.
