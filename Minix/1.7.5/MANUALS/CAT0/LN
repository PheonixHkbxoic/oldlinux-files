           -f  Remove existing links
           -m  Merge trees, disable the into-a-directory trick
           -rR Recursively link a directory tree
           -v  Display what ln is doing
           -x  Do not cross device boundaries

     A directory entry is created for name.  The entry points  to  file.
Henceforth,  name  and file can be used interchangeably.  If name is not
supplied, the last component of file is used as the link name.  If  more
than  one  file is supplied or the name refers to an existing directory,
links will be created in that directory.  An existing name will  not  be
removed unless the -i or -f flag is specified.

     Clone is a convenient synonym for ln -fmr  to  create  a  so-called
"link farm", a directory full of links to the original tree.
