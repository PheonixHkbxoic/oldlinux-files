Syntax:    ascii [-n] [file]
Flags:     -n  Extract the lines containing nonASCII characters
Examples:  ascii file >outf         # Write all the ASCII lines on outf
           ascii -n <file >outf     # Write all the  nonASCII  lines  on
                                      outf

     Sometimes a file contains some nonASCII characters that are in  the
way.   This program allows the lines containing only ASCII characters to
be grepped from the file. With the  -n  flag,  the  nonASCII  lines  are
grepped.  No matter whether the flag is used or not, the program returns
an exit status of true if the file is pure ASCII, and false otherwise.
