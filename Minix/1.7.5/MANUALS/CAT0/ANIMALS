     Animals is a guessing game.  The  user  picks  an  animal  and  the
computer  tries  to guess it by posing questions that should be answered
by typing 'y' for yes and 'n' for no. Whenever the  computer  loses,  it
asks  some  questions  that allow it to improve its database, so as time
goes on, it learns.  The default database should be in /usr/lib/animals.
