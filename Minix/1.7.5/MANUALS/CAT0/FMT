Syntax:    fmt [-width] [files] ...
Flags:     -N  Specify the line width
Example:   !}fmt                    # Formats one paragraph  when  typed
                                      in vi

     Fmt formats paragraphs  in  a  text  file  to  make  the  lines  be
approximately  the  same  width.   It  preserves  indentation  and  word
spacing.  It is typically used from within vi as in  the  example.   The
default  line length is 72 characters, fmt -66 for instance would format
text to a 66 character line length.
