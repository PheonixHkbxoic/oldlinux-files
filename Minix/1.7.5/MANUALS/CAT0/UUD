Syntax:    uud [-n] [-s srcdir] [-t dstdir/] file
Flags:     -n  Do not verify checksums
           -s  Name of directory where .uue file is
           -t  Name of directory where output goes
Examples:  uud file.uue             # Re-create the original file
           uud - <file.uue          # The - means use stdin

     Uud decodes a file encoded with uue or UNIX uuencode.  The  decoded
