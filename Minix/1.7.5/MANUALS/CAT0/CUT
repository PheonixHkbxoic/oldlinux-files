Syntax:    cut [  -b | -c] list [file...]
           cut -f list [-d delim] [ -s]
[file...]"
Flags:     -b  Cut specified bytes
           -c  Select out specific characters
           -d  Change the column delimiter to delim
           -f  Select out specific fields that are separated by the
delimiter character ( see delim)"
           -i  Runs of delimiters count as one
           -s  Suppres lines with no delimiter characters, when used
with the  -f  option.  Lines  with  no  delimiters  are  passwd  through
untouched"
Examples:  cut -f 2 file            # Extract field 2
           cut -c 1-2,5 file        # Extract character  columns  1,  2,
                                      and 5
           cut -c 1-5,7- file       # Extract all columns except 6

     Cut extracts one or more fields or columns from a file  and  writes
them  on  standard  output.   If  the  -f  flag  is used, the fields are
separated by a delimiter character, normally a tab, but can  be  changed
using  the  -d  flag.   If  the -c flag is used, specific columns can be
specified.  The list can be comma or BLANK  separated.  The  -f  and  -c
flags   are mutually exclusive.  Note: The POSIX1003.2 standard requires
the option -b to cut out specific bytes in a file. It  is  intended  for
systems  with  multi byte characters (e.g. kanji), since MINIX uses only
one byte characters, this option is  equivalent  to  -c.  For  the  same
reason,  the  option  -n  has no effect and is not listed in this manual
page.
