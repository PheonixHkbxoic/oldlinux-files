     MINIX allows files that have been deleted (e.g.,  with  rm)  to  be
restored  (in  /tmp).  The trick is that when a file is unlinked, its i-
node number is kept in the directory entry.  As long  as  the  directory
entry  and  disk blocks are not reused, the file can be recovered.  This
program is actually just a little  front  end  for  de,  which  must  be
installed as a set-uid root executable.
