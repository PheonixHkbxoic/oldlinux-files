                output
Syntax:    printroot
Flags:     -r  Print only the root device, not a full mtab line
Example:   printroot                # Print the name of the root device

     Printroot is useful for initializing the /etc/mtab when the  system
is  booted.   It  figures  out what the root device is by searching /dev
until it finds a block special file with the  right  major/minor  device
numbers.
