Syntax:    yes [answer]
Flags:     (none)
Example:   yes | script             # Answer yes to all  questions  from
                                      the script

     Yes sends out an endless stream of y's, each on one line.  One uses
it  to automatically say "yes" to all questions a command may ask.  This
is useful for commands that ask too many "Are you sure?" questions.  The
optional argument makes yes use answer as the word to print instead of a
single y character.
