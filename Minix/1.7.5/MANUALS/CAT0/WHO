Syntax:    who [file]
Flags:     (none)
Example:   who                      # Print user  names,  terminals  and
                                      times

     Who prints a list of currently logged in users.  For each one,  the
user  name,  terminal,  and login time is printed. This program gets its
information from the file /etc/utmp, which is updated by init and login.
If  the  file  does  not exist, neither of these will create it, and who
will not work.  Note that if you decide to create an empty /usr/adm/wtmp
to enable the login accounting, it will grow forever and eventually fill
up your disk unless you manually truncate it from time to time.   If  an
optional file name is provided, the logins in that file will be printed.
