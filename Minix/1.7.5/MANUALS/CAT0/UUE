                mailing)
Syntax:    uue [-n] file [-]
Flags:     -n  How many lines to put in each file
Examples:  uue file                 # Encode file to file.uue
           uue file - >x            # Encode file and write on stdout
           uue -800 file            # Output on file.uaa, file.uab etc.

     Uuencode is a famous program that converts  an  arbitrary  (usually
binary)  file  to  an encoding using only 64 ASCII characters.  Uudecode
converts it back to the original file.  The uue and uud programs are the
MINIX versions of these programs, and are compatible with the UNIX ones.
The files produced can even be sent successfully over BITNET,  which  is
notorious  for mangling files.  It is possible to have uue automatically
split the encoded file up into small chunks.  The output files then  get
the  suffixes  .uaa,  .uab,  etc.,  instead  of .uue.  When uud is given
file.uaa to decode, it automatically  includes  the  subsequent  pieces.
The  encoding takes 3 bytes (24 bits) from the input file and renders it
as 4 bytes in the output file.
