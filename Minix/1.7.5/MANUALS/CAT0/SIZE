Syntax:    size [file] ...
Flags:     (none)
Example:   size file                # Print the size of file

     The text, data, bss, and total sizes for each argument are printed.
If  no  arguments  are  present, a.out is assumed.  The amount of memory
available for combined stack and data segment growth is printed  in  the
column 'stack.' This is the value manipulated by the chmem command.  The
total amount of memory allocated to the program when  it  is  loaded  is
listed  under  'memory.'  This  value  is just the sum of the other four
columns.
