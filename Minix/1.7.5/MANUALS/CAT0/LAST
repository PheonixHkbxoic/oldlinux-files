Syntax:    last [-f file] [-r] [-n] [name] [tty] ...
Flags:     -f  Use file instead of /usr/adm/wtmp
           -r  Search backwards only to last reboot
           -n  Print a maximum of n lines
Examples:  last reboot              # When was the system last rebooted?
           last ast                 # When was the last login for ast?
           last -10 tty00 tty01     # Display last 10 logins on tty00 or
                                      tty01

     Last  Searches  backward  through  the  login  administration  file
(default  is  /usr/adm/wtmp), printing information about previous logins
and reboots.  During a long search, the SIGQUIT signal  (CTRL-\)  causes
last to display how far back it has gone; it then continues.
