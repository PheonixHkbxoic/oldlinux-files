Syntax:    wc [-clw] file ...
Flags:     -c  Print character count
           -l  Print line count
           -w  Print word count
Examples:  wc file1 file2           # Print all three  counts  for  both
                                      files
           wc -l file               # Print line count only

     Wc reads each argument and computes the number of characters, words
and  lines it contains.  A word is delimited by white space (space, tab,
or line feed).  If no flags are present, all three counts are printed.
