Syntax:    unshar [-btvx] sharfile member ...
Flags:     -b  Unshar brutally, overwriting files if need be
           -t  Tell what is in the archive but do not extract
           -v  Verbose mode
           -x  Extract only the members listed
Examples:  unshar arch.sh           # Extract all members of the archive
           unshar -t arch.sh        # List the contents of the archive
           unshar -xf1 -xf2 arch.sh # Extract f1 and f2 from arch.sh
           uniq -d inf outf         # Write duplicate lines to outf

     Unshar extracts members of a shell archive, the same as sh,  except
much  faster.  It expects shell archives created with shar.  It also has
options to list the contents of a  shell  archive,  and  to  selectively
extract some members but not all.
