Syntax:    term [baudrate] [parity] [bits_per_character] [device]
Flags:     (none)
Examples:  term 2400                # Talk to modem at 2400 baud
           term 1200 7 even         #  1200  baud,  7  bits/char,   even
                                      parity
           term 8 9600 /dev/tty01   # 9600 baud, 8 bits/char, no parity,
                                      use tty01

     Term allows MINIX to talk to a terminal or modem over RS232 port 1.
The  program  first  sets the baudrate, parity and character length, and
then forks.  The parent sits in a loop copying from stdin  (usually  the
console's  keyboard),  to  the terminal or modem (/dev/tty00). The child
sits in a loop copying  from  the  terminal  or  modem  (/dev/tty00)  to
standard  output.  Thus when RS232 port 1 is connected to a modem, every
keystroke typed on  the  keyboard  is  sent  to  the  modem,  and  every
character  arriving  from  the  modem  is displayed.  Standard input and
output may be redirected, to provide a primitive file transfer  program,
with  no  checking.   To exit term, hit the middle button on the numeric
pad.  Important note: to use term, it is essential that  /etc/ttytab  is
configured so that there is no shell hanging on /dev/tty00. If there is,
both the shell and term will try to read from  /dev/tty00,  and  nothing
will work.
