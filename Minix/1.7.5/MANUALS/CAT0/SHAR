Syntax:    shar file ...
Flags:     (none)
Examples:  shar *.c >s              #  Collect  C  programs   in   shell
                                      archive
           sh <s                    # Extract files from a shell archive

     The named files are collected together into a shell archive written
onto  standard  output.   The  individual  files  can  be  extracted  by
redirecting the shell archive into the shell.   The  advantage  of  shar
over  ar  is  that  shar archives can be read on almost any UNIX system,
whereas numerous, incompatible versions of ar  are  in  widespread  use.
Extracting  the  files  from  a  shell  archive  requires  that  sed  be
accessible.
