Syntax:    tail [-c n] [-f] [-n n] [file] ...
Flags:     -c  The count refers to characters
           -f  On FIFO or special file, keep reading after EOF
           -n  The count refers to lines
Examples:  tail -n 6                # Print last 6 lines of stdin
           tail -c 20 file          # Print the last  20  characters  of
                                      file
           tail -n 1 file1 file2    # Print last line of two files
           tail -n +8 file          # Print the tail starting with  line
                                      8

     The last few lines of one or more files are printed.   The  default
count  is  10  lines.  The default file is stdin.  If the value of n for
the -c or -n flags  starts  with  a  +  sign,  counting  starts  at  the
beginning, rather than the end of the file.
