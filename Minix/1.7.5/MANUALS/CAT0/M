Syntax:    M device [-r]
           U device
Flags:     -r  Mount read-only
Examples:  M root                   # Mount the RAM image on /root
           M 0                      # Mount /dev/fd0 on /fd0
           U fd1                    # Unmount /dev/fd1 from /fd1

     M and U allow easy mounting and unmounting of  a  device  by  using
only  an abbreviated device name or keyword.  Special keywords are root,
tmp, and usr for the three hard disk partitions Minix runs  in.   Floppy
devices are mounted on /fd0 or /fd1.  You can use 0 and 1 instead of fd0
and fd1.  A device it doesn't know about is mounted on /mnt.
