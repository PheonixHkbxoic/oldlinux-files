Syntax:    look [-f] prefix[/suffix] [dictionary]
Flags:     -f  Fold upper case letters to lower case
Examples:  look ard                 # Print words starting with ard
           look /bing               # Print words ending with bing
           look -f f/ar             #  Print  words  starting  with   f,
                                      ending with ar

     Look takes a prefix and/or suffix and searches  /usr/lib/dict/words
or  the  specified  dictionary for all words with that match.  The words
are printed.  The -f flag causes all upper case letters to be treated as
lower case.
