     Uniq examines a file for consecutive lines that are identical.  All
but  duplicate  entries  are deleted, and the file is written to output.
The +n option skips the first n fields, where a field is  defined  as  a
run  of  characters  separated  by white space.  The -n option skips the
first n spaces.  Fields are skipped first.
