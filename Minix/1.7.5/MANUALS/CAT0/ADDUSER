Syntax:    adduser user group home-dir
Flags:     (none)
Examples:  adduser ast other /usr/ast # How user ast could be added
           adduser bin operator /usr/src # How user bin could be added

     Adduser adds a new user to the system  by  making  new  entries  in
/etc/passwd  and  /etc/shadow  for  the  new  user,  creating a new home
directory, and copying the  contents  of  the  template  home  directory
/usr/ast  into  it.  The user-id of this new user will be the first free
number not less than 10.  The password is initially empty, the full name
must  be  set,  and the shell is the Bourne Shell, /bin/sh.  Use passwd,
chfn, and chsh to change.
