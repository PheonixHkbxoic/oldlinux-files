Syntax:    cmp [-ls] file1 file2
Flags:     -l  Loud mode. Print bytes that differ (in octal)
           -s  Silent mode.  Print nothing, just return exit status
Examples:  cmp file1 file2          # Tell whether  the  files  are  the
                                      same
           cmp -l file1 file2       # Print all corresponding bytes that
                                      differ

     Two files are compared.  If they are identical, exit  status  0  is
returned.   If  they  differ,  exit  status 1 is returned.  If the files
cannot be opened, exit status  2  is  returned.   If  one  of  the  file
arguments is -, then stdin is compared to the other file.
