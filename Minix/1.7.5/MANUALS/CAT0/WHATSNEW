Syntax:    whatsnew [-n] file.c file.c.cdif
Flags:     -n  Output line length
Examples:  whatsnew file.c  file.c.cdif  #  Print  file.c  with  changes
                                      marked
           whatsnew -70 file.c file.c.cdif # Same as above, but with  70

     It  commonly  occurs  that  cdifs  are  posted  to  USENET.   After
installing  a  cdif file, it is sometimes desirable to print out the new
file, with the changes marked on it.  Whatsnew does precisely this, with
the changes + and ! printed in the right-hand margin.
