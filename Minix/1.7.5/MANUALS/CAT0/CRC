Syntax:    crc file ...
Flags:     (none)
Example:   crc *.c                  #  Print  checksums  of  all  the  C
                                      programs

     The checksum of each argument is computed and printed,  along  with
the file length and its name, one file per line.  This program is useful
for seeing  if  a  file  transmitted  to  another  machine  has  arrived
correctly.   It  is  conceptually  similar to sum, except that it uses a
stronger checksum algorithm and also prints the length.
