Syntax:    fold [-n] [file] ...
Flags:     -n  How long should the output lines be
Examples:  fold -60                 # Fold stdin to 60 characters
           fold file                # Fold file to 80 characters

     Fold takes copies its input from the named file (or stdin, if  none
is  specified) to standard output.  However, lines longer than the given
maximum (default 80) are broken  into  multiple  lines  of  the  maximum
length by inserting new line characters.
