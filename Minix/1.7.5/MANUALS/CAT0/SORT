Syntax:    sort [-bcdfimnru] [-tc]  [-o name] [+pos1] [-pos2] file ...
Flags:     -b  Skip leading blanks when making comparisons
           -c  Check to see if a file is sorted
           -d  Dictionary order: ignore punctuation
           -f  Fold upper case onto lower case
           -i  Ignore nonASCII characters
           -m  Merge presorted files
           -n  Numeric sort order
           -o  Next argument is output file
           -r  Reverse the sort order
           -t  Following character is field separator
           -u  Unique mode (delete duplicate lines)
Examples:  sort -nr file            # Sort keys numerically, reversed
           sort +2 -4 file          # Sort using fields 2 and 3 as key
           sort +2 -t: -o out       # Field separator is :
           sort +.3 -.6             # Characters 3 through  5  form  the
                                      key

     Sort sorts one or more files.  If no files are specified, stdin  is
sorted.   Output  is written on standard output, unless -o is specified.
The options +pos1 -pos2 use only fields pos1 up  to  but  not  including
pos2  as the sort key, where a field is a string of characters delimited
by spaces and tabs, unless a different field delimiter is specified with
-t.   Both  pos1  and pos2 have the form m.n where m tells the number of
fields and n tells the number of characters.   Either  m  or  n  may  be
omitted.
