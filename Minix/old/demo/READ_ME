This directory contains MINIX demonstration disks.  To use them, first
download the correct one to your machine:

	demo_dsk.ibm (IBM PC, XT, AT, or 386)
	demo_dsk.st (Atari ST)
	demo_dsk.sp (SPARC) 
	amiga.lzh (Amiga)

Then copy it bit for bit to a floppy disk.  These files are exact disk images.
They are not files readable by any operating system.  They are bootable disks.
For the Atari, you must use a 360K diskette.  For the SPARC, you need a 1.44M 
diskette. The Amiga demo is a standard lharc archive.

To transfer the demo disk to a floppy, you need a program that can write
a raw disk image.  A program 'rawrite' has been provided for MS-DOS users.
The Turbo C source (rawrite.c), the executable (rawrite.exe), and the
user manual (rawrite.doc) are provided in this directory.  For the Atari,
use file2dsk instead of rawrite (see file2dsk.doc).

The demo user manual is available in PostScript form as manual.ps or as
flat ASCII text as manual.txt.  If you can print PostScript, use the
former; if not, use the latter.  The manual.txt file can be printed
on any printer that can handle ASCII text (including Form Feed).

The announcement file tells more about MINIX, describes the MINIX newsgroup, 
comp.os.minix, and the MINIX archives.  It is a flat ASCII file.

The files ending in .Z are compressed using the UNIX compress program.
Not all the files are compressed, just the larger ones.  If you have the
UNIX or MINIX compress program, download the .Z files to save bandwidth, and
decompress them on your own machine.  Please do not FTP during business
hours European time, (i.e., please FTP after 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time).

Once more, to avoid any confusion, MINIX is not public domain or shareware.
It is copyrighted software.  All the files in this directory, including
the demo disks are also fully protected by copyright.  The copyright owners 
hereby grant permission to copy and use the MINIX demo disks and other files 
in this directory only for the purpose of evaluating MINIX to see if it 
is suitable for your needs.

=============================================================================
The crcs of most of the files in this directory are listed below.
The crc is the MINIX replacement for sum.  It gives a much stronger 
checksum.  The source is in crc.c, in case you don't already have it.

     If you have previously purchased MINIX from Prentice-Hall, you can get
a discount of $60, but only if you order by mail and include the label from 
the original PH boot disk (or the entire disk) with your letter.  Not valid 
for email, phone or FAX orders since you must enclose the original boot disk 
label (not a photocopy).  Mail orders can be by credit card or check for 
$169.  You will be billed for tax and shipping.
