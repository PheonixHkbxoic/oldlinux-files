This file describes two ways of getting an Atari ST boot image file onto a
floppy disk.  One method uses two drives.  The other uses a RAM disk and
one drive.  Read this file to select the one most appropriate for your system.


------------------------------ Method 1 ------------------------------
file2dsk.ttp -- (c) 1991 Ken Corey (aka kenc@vaxb.acs.unt.edu)

This program is intended to copy the demonstration copy of MINIX-ST to floppy
disk.  Any other use indicates a warped mind, and you should get help fast!
Why?  Because this copies a file bit for bit, sector for sector to the A: 
floppy.  No questions asked.  It'll work with any file, and can thoroughly 
confuse and trash TOS, forcing a reboot.

Usage is simple:  

file2dsk filename.ext [B:]

Where filename.ext can be any legal pathname, ending with filename.ext.

The B: on the end is optional.  Matter of fact, any extra word out there
 means to use drive B:.  (For instance, you could type 'BILL' out there)
 and file2dsk would assume you had meant drive b.

WARNING: This program will eat whatever is stored on the drive you chose. 
  Matter of fact, you should format the floppy as single sided, USING THE 
  DESKTOP, prior to using this program! No other configuration is supported, 
  recommended, allowed or condoned. (We'll get Guido out after the offenders)

Once you've done this, you must turn the ST off for a few seconds, because it 
still thinks that the floppy in drive A: is not bootable, and won't pay any 
attention if you simply hit the reset button.  Turn your ST on, give it about
15 seconds, and you should hear the magical sound of the floppy booting, and 
see the screen go black.  You're on your own from there!

Yeah, the BS rights area....hm....

This program MAY NOT be charged for other than the costs of duplication.  I'll
be happy to send uuencoded versions to anyone who needs it, assuming they have
access to internet.  If someone reads this, and MUST have a copy, I'll mail 
the source (in Sozobon C) and program on a floppy for $4.00...cheap, but that's
my price.



------------------------------ Method 2 ------------------------------
If you have only one drive, you can use a RAMDISK. Download the file 
dyer512.prg. If not yet present, make a subdirectory A:\AUTO on the floppy
that by now should contain dyer512.prg, demo_dsk.st and file2dsk.ttp.
Copy dyer512.prg into the A:\AUTO directory. Reboot from this floppy.
Now you can:

 - Go into command mode (by clicking COMMAND.PRG or GULAM.PRG, or some 
   other command language program).
 - Copy demo_dsk.st and file2dsk.ttp onto M:
 - Change working directory to M:
 - Remove A:
 - Insert the fresh formatted demo disk
 - Use file2dsk.ttp to copy demo_dsk.st onto A:
