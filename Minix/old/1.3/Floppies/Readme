This directory contains images of the 360K PC floppies which hold Minix 1.3.
These are archive disks created by Warren Toomey, by hand-patching Minix 1.2
with the USENET diffs for 1.3 posted by Andy Tanenbaum. As such, this is not
an official version of Minix 1.2 from Prentice-Hall. However, it is still
covered by the following copyright notice:

	MINIX BINARIES AND SOURCES FOR 640K IBM PC'S
	by Andrew S. Tanenbaum
	(c) 1989 Prentice-Hall, Inc.

All disks are labelled `Minix 1.3c Backup, 6th December 1988'.
The disks are labelled as follows:

Disk 01: Boot Disk (ST238R Driver)
Disk 02: Root File Structure
Disk 03: /usr/bin/[a-f]
Disk 04: /usr/bin/[g-t]
Disk 05: /usr/bin/[t-z]

Disk 12: /usr/local/bin, 6th August 1989

Note: The image for disk 5 has a bad 512-byte block at offset 311808, which
has been replaced with an all-zero block. I haven't booted Minix to find
out which file is affected.
