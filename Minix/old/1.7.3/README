Minix 1.7.3 doesn't exist.  If you nevertheless believe to have this
version on your disk then you can use the files in this directory to
upgrade this thing you call 1.7.3 to Minix 1.7.4.  The new34.tar.Z file
contains all the files that are to be changed or added, and old34 contains
a list of files that are to be removed.  All paths are relative to /usr/.
The commands:

	! cd /usr
	! zcat ..../new34.tar.Z | tar xvfp -
	! rm `cat ..../old34`
	! make clean
	! make install
	! cd tools
	! make hdboot

Should bring your system back into the world as Minix 1.7.4.
