How to upgrade from 1.7.0 to 1.7.1.

- Replace the sources, that's /usr/include, /usr/man, and /usr/src, with
  the 1.7.1 sources by extracting the SRC.nn images in the normal way.
  (Don't forget to move or remove the 1.7.0 stuff.)

- There are two ways to continue.  You can do the daring aproach and
  type 'make install' in /usr/src to recompile everything, or you can
  compile only the pieces you need right now to get a 1.7.1 kernel up.
  1.7.1 compiled command should run under a 1.7.0 kernel, so there are
  no problems there.  Let's take the careful road:

- Move to /usr/src/lib and type 'make install'.  You need new libraries
  for the new kernel.

- In /usr/src/boot type 'make install'.  The new kernel needs a new boot
  monitor.

- In /usr/src/commands/simple type 'make bin /usr/bin/dd'.  The next
  step uses a new dd option.

- Customize /usr/include/minix/config.h to add or remove drivers.  In
  /usr/src/tools type 'make hdtest', or 'make fdboot'.  Test the new
  kernel.

- If the kernel works then go back to /usr/src/tools and type
  'make bootable' to install a new boot monitor on the root partition.

- Next use 'make hdinstall' to install an new kernel image on the root
  partition.

- Your system is now running 1.7.1.  You can use 'make install' in
  /usr/src to recompile the rest if you didn't do so already.

- Run 'checkhier' as root.  It suggest commands to execute to fix
  descrepancies in the top level directory tree.

- Compare all files in /usr/src/etc with those in /etc.  Some have
  changed and should be replaced.  Be careful not to lose changes you
  have made to files in /etc.
