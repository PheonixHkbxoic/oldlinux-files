MINIX

This directory and subdirectories contain MINIX, a small UNIX-like
system for IBM PC's and compatibles. The prime objective of Minix is
education. Major parts of it can be studied and understood by one
person in a limited amount of time. Minix is a redesign, using a modern
microkernelish setup. Read the Minix Info Sheet
(http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/minix.html) for more information. Read it first if
you have a Web browser. 

Minix is free for educational use only, read the Minix license-to-use
in the file LICENSE. You have to agree to its terms if you want to use
this software. 

You can find the following directories in this tree: 

  CD-ROM-2.0/           - Minix 2.0 CD-ROM

  2.0.0/                - Minix 2.0.0 (same as CD-ROM-2.0/MINIX/, but
                          with README's adapted to FTP and WWW users)

  dosutil/              - Useful MS-DOS utilities for Minix installation

Files with suffix .Z are compressed, files with suffix .tar are archives of
files, files with suffix .TAZ are compressed archives. Use one of 

        uncompress file.Z
        tar xvf file.tar
        zcat file.TAZ | tar xvfp -

to uncompress or unpack compressed files, archives, and compressed
archives. Our FTP server allows you to transfer entire directory trees
in a single command if you reference the directory with .tar attached
to its name. So you could get 2.0.0.tar in one blow if you want to, but
note that you probably do not want everything in a given directory.
Inspect the contents of a directory first.
