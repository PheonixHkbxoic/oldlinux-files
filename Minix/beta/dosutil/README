The WrtDsk or RaWrite3 program can be used under MS-DOS to copy images
to floppies.  The FIPS utility can be used to shrink an MS-DOS partition
if the disk of the machine you wish to install Minix contains a single
MS-DOS partition that covers the entire disk.  (As is often the case.)

RaWrite3 may occasionally fail to recognize a diskette properly, there
is no solution but to retry until you get it right.  WrtDsk is a brand
new replacement for RaWrite that should not have these problems.  Please
try it.  Note the disclaimers on all these programs, they mean it.  Back
up your data first!

WrtDsk allows one to write images to disk in one command:

	wrtdsk ROOT USR USR.* SRC.*

It allows you to redistribute the data on the floppies, so you can tag
USR onto ROOT, and concatenate the USR.* and SRC.* images if your
floppies are big enough.  Note that USR.01 and SRC.01 must be the first
on a new floppy!
