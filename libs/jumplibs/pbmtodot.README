Notice:
  This is a package of the program 'pbmtodot'. Included are binary, manual
  page, and source. It is a program to print a 'pbm' file on a dot matrix
  printer. The executable is linked with my graphics jumptable lib, so 
  you'll need the package libgr01.TZ as well to use the binary. 

Warning: 
  The graphics jumptable lib is in a testing phase. The binary works
  correctly as far as I can tell.
