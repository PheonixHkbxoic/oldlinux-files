Hi,

Since I packaged these files I noticed a small (?) problem with distributing
shared images. The images have a large hole in the file, and it seems that
'tar' cannot reproduce this hole. So: If you are installing the packages by
tar, the shared images in /lib/*.so.* will take up more space than needed.

If you want to have the full advantage of the shared images: please get the
'makehole' program by HLU, and use it on the supplied *.so.* files.
