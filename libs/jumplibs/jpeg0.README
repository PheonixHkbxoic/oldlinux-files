Notice:
  This is a package of the programs 'djpeg' and 'cjpeg'. These binaries
  are linked with my graphics jumptable lib, so you'll need the package
  libgr01.TZ as well to use the programs. Source code and manuals of
  the programs is in package jpegsrc3.TZ

Warning: 
  The graphics jumptable lib is in a testing phase. The binaries work
  correctly as far as I can tell.
