We experience a problem on out Linux 1.1.19 systems where
the inetd goes deaf and won't handle any more incoming connections.

If you run inetd in debugging mode then as I recall you see that
select() starts to return -1 [Dimly remembered]

The fix is to kill inetd and start a new one.

The cause?  I have found that the problem is caused by people connecting
with SLIP and using the *wrong IP address* on their end.  In other words
they have configured their IP stack with an address different from that
in the diphosts file.

Perhaps that will help someone,
Steve

        My laptop has 3Mb of ram, a 60Mb hard drive, and a 386/20.
Nonetheless, I have a current kernel on there, plus I set up plip so that
I could mount the disk on my "big" system via NFS.  I put microEmacs on there,
and I have GCC (it tends to swap a lot if I use it for more than a small test
file.  I have a separate kernel that I can select w/o TCP/IP if I do not intend
to use networking.

        I picked it up real cheap, but for misc word processing applications
and reading mail it does the job.  I brought my main machine in to work, so all
I have at home is this laptop.

Some motherboards have the CPU mounted on the MB(non removable). Those 
boards usually have another socket to allow you to disable the current 
CPU and upgrade your computer. This is usually expensive.

Well, finally after 2 boards and a new cache, figured out what was happening.
I was running 5M in the following config: Lower 1M in 256K SIMMS and upper
4M in 1M SIMMS.  Unfortunitly, the 256Kers were 100ms which is waaaayyyy
too slow for a cached 386DX40.  So after pulling them and just using the
4M SIMMS, everything seems to work.  But I did get a bonus in the deal.
The first board had a soldered on cpu where the current one is socketed
so I can later load a SLC in there.

Let me get this straight:  The pub library in Lenox has just received
a grant to do something the director hasn't the faintest idea how to
do, and they're not using the money to hire competent systems analysts
to do the implementation, but rather trying to solicit volunteers to
do the work (and afterwards maintain the software)?

I suspect this isn't what you mean.  As it comes off at first glance,
this seems a recipe for disaster.  I can put in touch with some very
competent people who could do the work.  They aren't independently
wealthy, though, and to get them and their time a few dollars would
need to fall their way....

I guess what I don't understand is this:  Isn't the point of the grant
to get $$ for staff and equipment??

Maybe I'm just having a foggy day....

May be it is worht mentioning that some work is going in that area for
the Linux kernel (see Viper-project entry in projects-faq). Currently, we
have a first kernel up and running understanding the notion of (kernel) 
threads.

At this very moment work is underway to develop an "lwp-create"-like
interface-operation to create another thread in the process space. However,
we are now working on re-directing signals, etc (they should be sent to
threads now, rather than processes).

With some luck, we should have an alpha-release at the end of this year,
which includes a full interface to create threads, destroy them, suspend
and resume them etc. Also, work is underway to port  Chris Provenzano's
pthreads-package to this platform.

After this work is finished (very vague term as it always evolves), phase
2 shall start, which includes full kernel pre-emptibility and bounded
dispatch latency times, prevention of priority-inversion and hidden
scheduling problems (a careful reader knows that this means a true real-time
kernel is underway). Finally, within a few months I hope to purchase a
motherboard containing two (at least!) pentium processors to start development
of a linux kernel based on symmetric multi-processing.

So, all linux-fanatics yelling for real-time support and/or threaded kernels
and/or SMP-support: have some patience as development has already started.
BTW: the HURD-project has also some interesting stuff worth looking at!

Regards,
        Leon.
