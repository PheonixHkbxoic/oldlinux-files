I noticed this also.  The file system rearrangement was sloppy. Some
scripts don't run without complaints about missing files and
directories. I was never sure whether there was a problem with the
CD-ROM install, my machine, or me. The Fall '94 is half-baked.   

I used the Fall '94 for a whole day - Columbus Day, which I had off.
Then, giving up on this possibly bogus product, I blew up the install
and went back to Summer '94, which, in my opinion, seems to be a better
quality package. Next time I go to my favorite UNIX reseller, Promox
Systems in Sunnyvale, I'm going to bitch about it.  I have two Linux
machines which were supposed to be Summer and Fall, respectively; at
this point, they're now both Summer '94.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted biweekly to
comp.os.linux.announce.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not a contribution to the development
of Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration
- should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.

The cops are unlikely to know, and even if they did, I doubt anyone would
be breaking into your house.  To answer your original point, distributing
stolen copyrighted material is a violation even if you aren't the one who
took the copy in the first place.  Distribution is one of the rights covered
by copyright.

Basically it's just a couple of addresses in the kernel initialization

Why? Mine works fine with XFree86 3.1. Just make sure to keep the old

Subject: Linux v1.1.45, XView v3L5.1 - compile warnings
Date: 13 Oct 1994 19:57:42 -0600
Reply-To: mrash@xmission.com

Here's my problem.  During installation of XView (version info in subject 
line), I keep getting warnings to the effect:
seln.c:32: warning: passing arg 1 of `xv_create` makes integer from 
pointer without a cast.

I also get some that say (this one is not a direct quote):
warning: comparison of integer and pointer.

I'm doing the installation of XView right now and don't know whether 
it'll work or not.  Over the last few days, I've been 
gathering/building/installing quite a bit of software from the 
comp.os.announce newsgroup messages.  I also see messages from people who 
appear to be successfully running them.  I get these same two messages in 
almost everything I try to build (xrn, xvnews, xgopher, xarchie).  Some 
actually build and run (although some funtions they provide kill the 
whole program or just don't work), while others die and won't build at all.

My question (Finally!) is:
What is wrong here.  
here are the versions of some of my stuff:

gcc = v2.5.8
XFree86 = v2.1.1
libc = 4.5.26
linux = Slackware 2.0
kernel = 1.1.45
XView = 3L5.1 (Today is first install of XView, it has not been on my 
system before now.)

I do have the olwm though and it runs fine.  Won't know about after XView 
installation 'til it finishes.  It's been building stuff for an hour or 
more now...  hmm. It's in ../src/sspkg/drawarea now.

Any help and/or suggestions will be most appreciated.  I'll upgrade 
whatever I need to.  Don't know whether I can downgrade anything.  We'll see.

Thanks in advance.

Incremental damage is irrelevant bullshit, Binesh.  Distributing copyrighted
material without the owner's permission is illegal _even if you weren't the
original violator_.  That is a fact, whether you like it or not.  Ignoring
that fact is foolish.  Publicly advertising that you're ignoring it is even
more foolish.

Wow, if you think going along with Clipper is a conservative or safe

I "found" the linux news groups yesterday also.  However, I read the
FAQ and the HOW-TOs before this, my first posting.  I found the FAQ on
comp.os.linux.announce yesterday.  So they are there.  No excuses for
not seeing them.  On the other hand, some of you linux advocates may
want to be a little nicer with potential brethren.  Just a thought.

On with my questions.  I am not yet using linux.  I have tried OS/2,
DOS, Windows, and I am not happy with them.  I am a UNIX fan and am
thinking of giving linux a shot.  Here are a few things I'd like to
know before I go through with the deed:

1) I read that Linux can run some DOS executables using DOSEMU, but I
also read that there is no support for Windows exectuables yet.  But I
have also seen mention of Windoze.  So do we support Windows
executables or not?  (Trying to decide whether to keep a partion with
DOS and Win on it.)

2) I read that I can use Ghostscript to print non-ASCII files, such as
PS files to my HP Deskjet 500.  Can anyone verify that this works
well?

3) I'd like to get a little feed back on the speed of using xterms and
X windows that are executing on remote machines using a 14.4Kbps modem
and Xfree86 with linux.  I will be doing this a lot so its efficiency
is a major concern in my decision whether to switch to linux or not.


Thanks for your time and input.

Huh? I never said ALL software development follows this tradition.
I just said that it isn't true that nobody would do anything if
there wasn't a monetary incentive. Although, probably with COBOL
you might have a point... I doubt anyone would program in COBOL
unless they were paid...

Also, I just realized something else that I might not have made
clear to Gina, since she said that she assumes that Paramount
has a legal basis to their claims...

I would not dispute that they may or may not have a legal basis
to their claim, since, I know nothing about the legality of this
issue, and further, I don't care about the legality or illegality
of my actions. What I DO care about is the ethics of the thing.
Like I keep saying IF I can see that I am hurting Paramount in
some tangible way by distributing the script, then I would not do
it... You could trust it or not, but... So, again, please tell me
how I'm hurting Paramount by distributing the script to people who
would not have bought the script anyway... (I know that much for
a fact (That they wouldn't have bought the script had it not been
for free)) AND, everyone I gave it to, is going to see the movie
anyway...

And, again, I'll reiterate my claims.
I do NOT justify the initial posting of the script, and truthfully
I find posting the script AGAIN at this point is kind of silly,
All I'm asking is how exactly Paramount gets hurt by continued
distribution of the script. And noone has yet told me any tangible
way that Paramount is getting hurt... I've heard "potential loss"
I've heard "it's not the writers final draft" etc. etc, but no real
way that Paramounts wallet is hurting... Certainly not per EACH
copy that is made (cause I've heard about the 1% of the population
who reads the script and says "I ain't paying to see that", which
if Paramount counts that, they should bring libel suits against
every reviewer also... Unless people tell me that reviewers all
have to be registered with Paramount before they do a review.)

Hi there,
I reacently tried to install Linux on my machine but I had some 
frustrating problems.  My SCSI card is an ABIT SC3210V VL-BUS
generic SCSI card.  My hard drive is a 1 Gigabyte (1080 MEG) 
11 ms drive.  When my pc boots up, I get the following 
information from the controller card: 
===============================================================
ID7:SC3210V VESA SCSI CONTROLLER V1.0         V
ID0:No SCSI device connected
ID1:No SCSI device connected
.....all the way to ID6 then:....
ID6:Quantum 1079MB Drive 0

Parameters of logical drives:
Drive 0: Cyl:1028 Heads:64 Sct/Trk:32      1079MB

Drive 1: Cyl:     Heads:   Sct/Trk:

===============================================================

I opened up my computer and I discovered that my card has
an NCR53c94 chip on it (It also says so in the manual).
When I try to boot up linux with the modern boot disk it
won't detect my hard drive or my controller card.
I then tried to pass the following parameters to the kernal:

boot ramdisk hd=1028,64,32

It then tells me:

hd.c ST-506 interface disk with more than 16 heads detected,
probably due to non standard sector translation, giving up.

when I don't set any parameters and let it boot up with the 
default settings it responds with:

mcd=0x300,10 Init failed, no such device...

Any reply or help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much.

Subject: Smallest Linux Box
Date: Sun, 16 Oct 1994 05:03:05 GMT

The "Weakest Box" thread is a hoot.  What I'd like to know is what's the
physically *smallest* Linux box?   All the palmtops I've seen are ROM-based
and floppyless (and few have enough RAM), so I would imagine those are out
of the question.  I've heard from folks running it on a Thinkpad 500 (at
least the textual portions, dunno about X11 yet) and some other machines
around four pounds (Compaq, Toshiba, Canon), but not on any of the handful
(pun!) of machines that are even smaller.  The Handbook, Omnibook, and DTR-1
all come to mind.  The consensus seems to be that Linux probably won't get
along with the funkier hardware & power conservation features in these
systems (and good luck getting the whacky input devices to work), but I
don't know if anyone's actually tried yet, or perhaps there are some other
wee systems that I'm overlooking.

It's kind of both funny and appealing at the same time...  Pocket Linux!

 ______________________
| Restore       Alt+F5 |
| Move          Alt+F7 |
| Size          Alt+F8 |
| Minimize      Alt+F9 |
| Maximize      Alt+F10|
| Lower         Alt+F3 |
|----------------------|
| Close         Alt+F4 |
|______________________|

        Both the double-click and selecting the "Close" works.  If it doesn't
work for you, you might want to ask whatever company you got Motif from.

That's very interesting.  Perhaps they should consider adding it to the
projects FAQ.  I haven't seen it there.  With all the debate about 
Linux word processors, I think many people would be interested to know
about this.

There is a Wordprocessing/Desktop-Publishing System for Linux in progress -
programmed by a group of german enthusiasts. It'll take a lot of time to
get it working, also it will cost al little bit. Please don't be impatient,
it's a lot of work.

This is not necessarily true. The DX4 has a different layout and needs
less clock cycles for some commands. This is why Intel calls it DX4 and
not DX3 (which would be the more logical name), they claim that it
behaves like a normal 486, *four* times overclocked internally.
(Physically it's only a triple-clock)

just my $.02, Michael
