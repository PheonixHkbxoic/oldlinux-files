Hello everyone.

I'm having a strange problem with linux 1.1.49; hopefully someone has some
insights:  
Was trying to compile dosemu when I noticed that I had mangled /usr/include
contents through a previous experiment... I reloaded /usr/include from the
Slackware gzip.  Immediately after this, no user except root can login to
the machine- execute permission on the shell is denied to anyone with
a group id other than 0.  Permissions on the shell programs=755; same on
the /bin dir.  No /etc/nologins file.  Everything in /etc/shells looks ok.
/etc/passwd and /etc/group look OK.  Problem also affects su- can't su to a
 user from root.  The only way 
a user can login is if I set gid to 0 for that user AND the shell program
permissions include world execution. 

I've tried recompiling/installing kernel from clean source dist.; also tried
kernel 1.1.47- same problem.  

I find it hard to believe reinstalling the includes did this.  Am I 
(most likely) missing something blatantly obvious?

Thanks for any pointers; they may save me from a from-scratch reinstall.

Subject: Newest kernel version to fix memory problems...
Date: 6 Sep 1994 10:00:49 -0400

I've been watching the /proc/meminfo file lately to see how memory intensive
some of the programs I run in the background are and I noticed something fairly
disturbing to me.  After running a while with normal usage (say a day or two)
without being shutdown and rebooted, memory seems to be marked as used, even
though all ''memory expensive'' programs have been killed.

At one point, 11 mb worth of buffers were shown as being used and I thought
that it had to do with playing audio cd's through my cdrom.  So I stopped
doing that.  It didn't help.  So I unmounted all nfs file-systems.  Ditto.

I'm stumped.  It seems that the kernel should return all alloced memory to the
general memory pool after a process terminates even if that process never freed
the memory itself.  So I tried mallocing a meg or so and exiting, but that did
not seem to be the cause.

If anyone knows the cause of this, and if there is a kernel patch that will fix
it, please let me know.  I'm running kernel ver 1.0 and haven't seen the need
to look for a later version until now.

Please reply here or directly via email.

A thousand thanks in advance for any help you may be able to offer,

My generic S3 801 VLB (US$ 85) gives me essentially the same performance as

15" KFC monitor @1280x768 (really wish I had a 17" Viewsonic 7 like at work)
but in terms of bang for the buck I can't complain at all.

I'd look at spending the extra $$ for the second MB - mine cost me US$60 via
mail order and it's worth it to be able to run in the 1280x1024 resolution.

Well, you're in luck. There is an "unofficial" version of gcc-2.5.8 
from Intel people with Pentium optimizations on sunsite.unc.edu in
/pub/Linux/Incoming. I think it's called gcc2.5.8p or some sort.

Hope this helps.

Everything that I have ever owned by Boca, and anything that anyone I

seen.  Everything from modems to mutli-port boards, to whatever else they 
claim to make that doesn't do the job that it is supposed to do.

I had a Boca 14.4k that never connected above 2400bps... and everything 
was configured right.  If you want a multi-port board, go with DigiBoard 
products.  I'm unsure if they have Linux drivers as of yet, but they are 
excellent products.  I have a PCx/16e in one of my SCO boxes, and it 
performs flawlessly.  You can configure it (on-the-fly) to have modem 
controll or not, simply by doing:

disable ttyi1a
enable ttyi1A

to turn on modem control.

Very easy and simple.

Yeah.  The SCSI 486 system has the advantage in the drive area, something 
that the original poster forgot to mention (or got cut from the quotes 
before I saw it) was the amount of ram in each system.  I would say that 
if they have the same amount of ram, see if you can wheel-and-deal with 
the sales company to possibly put a Fast SCSI drive in for around the 
same price.  That way you would have the best of both worlds.  

I would have to say that if it comes down to the point where you want the 
Pentium, you would more than likely be wasting your time with an IDE... I 
use a 1.2 gig SCSI at work on my SCO box, and a 212 meg IDE at home on my 
Linux box, and I can notice a big difference in time (Of course there are 
other factors involved, such as the SCO box at work is a Multi-Processor 
486dx50 with 48 megs ram, and my comp at home is a 386sx16 with 5 megs 
ram :) )

But IDE and Pentium and Linux would be like cramming several thousand psi 
of a thick liquid through a stirring straw... it will be a slow and 
tedious process.
