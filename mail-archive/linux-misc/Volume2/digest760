I recently added Linux to my OS/2 machine and am quite
happy, so I feel somewhat qualified to answer this post:

I'd recommend making a dedicated Linux partition.

Boot it from the OS/2 boot manager if you're using that.  That's
what I do.

Order one of the Slackware 2.0 CDROMs from any of a number of
distributors.  I got mine from Morse Telecommunications for
about $50, which includes the installation book (printed, of
course) and three months of tech support.

Hi all !

I would be interested in replies to this question, being that I had to
give up approx 35 MB of my 545 MB drive, due to non standard translations
done by my IDE accellerator, when heads go over 1024. ( I was time
limited when transferring my linux files off of my 345 ) I have since
learned I can work around this with the new kernel I have, (1.1.45) since
it queries the drive directly.

I had almost everything on a 105 MB partition for a few months, till I
replaced my second drive. I found that when I gave it 200 + 16 swap,
I had lots to spare *but* it's quickly filling up, as I'm adding new
stuff to it. (wine, dosemu, TeX). I think it depends on how you want
to use it. The stuff available for linux seems endless.

Yggdrassil has a plug'n'play cd and slackware has a cd version also,
where I hear you can run some of the less frequently used binaries
from, ( also hear it's slower ).

I'd say you can more than get away with 200 MB (a least for a few
months)

Hope this helps.

OS9 was designed as a stripped down clone of UNIX.  It was written in assembly 
language and ran in 64K RAM with no swap file on a 6809 chip (hence the OS9 
name.)  It has grown in many ways since then.  There is now an Intel version 
(OS9000.)  It has a specific market that it is the leading operating system in: 
embedded controllers in an industrial environment.  It is enough of a real-time 
operating system, with enough flexibility and power to do this task well.  It 
is the operating system for CDI systems.  It was not designed to compete with 
UNIX, so it should not be compared directly with it.

Definitely get the SCSI!  Linux recognizes it and works with it
perfectly as long as it can tango with your SCSI controller.

Plus, when transferring CD -> Hard Drive, I believe Linux can do a
direct transfer on the SCSI bus.  Someone please correct me if I'm
wrong about this.  All I know is that Linux was _very_ much faster
than OS/2 when transferring from the CD to Hard Drive.

Hmmm, a case of semantics.  I prefer to consider a "Disk Operating System" to
be an operating system whose primary concern is simply serving as a way to
access physical file storage.  DOS does not, for example, manage tasks to any
great extent, nor does it provide multiuser capabilities, etc.  So, in that
sense, I see the term DOS as being a limit to the capabilities of the OS in
question.

Date: 13 Sep 1994 18:23:50 GMT

I have installed Linux v1.0 Slackware release for 24hr SLIP access
into ClarkNet and SMTP for my Novell 3.11 LAN.  Everything works 
great except some mail that is sent out through SMTP causes a 
uucp_neighbors error.  I know there is a missing file called
/usr/lib/smail/routers that will correct this with the right config 
in it.  The error is :

Xdefer: <address> reason: <ERR_127> router uucp_neighbors :
command '/usr/bin/uuname' returned exit status EX_32256

I know calling uuname is a bug in SMAIL and a routers file will fix
this but I don't know wht to put in it.

What do I need to put in /usr/lib/smail/routers to get these messages
delivered?  Thanks for the help.

Please use a copyright that some real (not net) lawyer have read and

Hi Linuxers,

I know there are lots of Linuxers with high performance PC's, so
there is a good chance that some of them have thought about 
installing NeXTSTEP, or have had experience with
it and now converted to Linux, or maybe currently working with both 
OS's on the same platorm.
I want to ask the following:

Given the same high performance PC platform, 

1. Which is cheaper to get?
     (Answer is easy) Linux, of course. This is one of
     the main advantages of Linux. Otherwise I wouldn't be using it.

2. Which one is easier to install and has less problem with existing 
   PC hardware?

3. Which one has more choice of application software?

4. Which one is faster (for the same task) ?

5. Which one has a capability that the other doesn't have?

6. Which one has better future? (this is a question for discussion
   and not for a definite answer.)

Haven't seen this is any of the FAQs (unless I missed it...):

I would like to be able to boot linux from our diskless workstations.
Has anyone done this?  Currently, we use Novell's remote boot feature
to load DOS.  I would then like to run a DOS program that talks tftp
to a UNIX server where the Linux kernel would reside.  This would
boot and NFS mount all the system stuff.

An alternative would be a small boot floppy that NFS mounts the rest
of the system.  I did this once using an old version of the SLS, but I
would rather do without the boot floppy.

So, am I dreaming?  Or can this be done?

MS-DOS, PC-DOS, etc... and UNIX are not a DOS!  That's a misnomer.  These
are full fledged operating systems that provide disk services along with
lots of other services (memory management, program loading, console, etc...).
You *may* be able to call the collection of disk services and the disk driver
a DOS within MS DOS, but I don't think that's completely accurate in the case 
of MS DOS.  Further, an application does not "quit to a DOS", it returns to 
an operating system which in this case, happens to be misnamed "DOS".  

This is all pretty silly and a waste of bandwidth.  After all, this started
when someone either didn't understand a joke, or was so sarcastic that his 
humor flew over a lot of our heads.  At the risk of continuing to be the
victim of a possible troll, I've got one last thought.

What's the proper way to refer to the type of computer that most of us are 
running Linux on?  IBM Compatible?  Certainly not.  Compatible with what? 
Amstrad?  How about IBM Compatible Personal Computer?  No, that could refer 
to an AIX box.  IBM Compatible Personal Computer based on Intel architecture?  
No way!  Which Intel architecture using which Intel chip?  We just lost 
"compatible".  I got it.  IBM Compatible Personal Computer based on 
Intel architecture with an EISA/ISA/MCA bus and an Intel x86/x88/Pentium
processor... no.  I wouldn't want to leave out AMD.  

PC (political correctness) is too much trouble for me!  At the risk
of offending Mac users, referring to Apple Computer Corp's Macintosh, 
not the hat, I'll keep using "PC" for what I have on my desk.  And 
I'll use "DOS" to refer to that OS I'm still forced to use so often.

Depends on what window manager you normally use. olvwm is usually started
as the last thing in the .xinitrc file, which means if you kill it,
your X session exits.  twm on the other hand is usually run in the background,
and an xterm is the last thing in the .xinitrc file, so the x session doesn't
end until that xterm is killed. I am not sure how people normally use fvwm;
I suspect like olwm because of the quit entry in the menu.

You can change your .xinitrc not to start up a window manager (make
sure your initial windows give you some viable typing area!), or change
it so that killing your window manager does not end your session.

This is always heated debate. A more general answer is that if you have enough
ram, disk performance lessens in importance, because memory gets used as a
fast disk cache, and you also reduce the incidence of swapping.

> CPU-speed is definitely more valuable. 

(cpu speed being a generic relative processing speed, not raw clock speed of course)

Again, if you are low on ram, cpu speed is almost meaningless, because
the swapping is the real bottleneck, and no matter how fast your disk
is, it's a lot slower than ram. Now if you have *enough* memory, then 
cpu is, by my last paragraph, probably much more important than disk speed.
