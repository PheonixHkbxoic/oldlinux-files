I've been told there is a linux kernel driver for the Mitsumi in alpha

Didn't the BSD fast filesystem suffer pretty dramatic performance 
degradation if this was set to 0?  I believe that keeping a certain
amount of space free allows it to better resist fragmentation, 
keeping it quick.  Don't know if this applies to ext2 as well, but
it might.  Of course, the reason you give is plenty valid too.

In the home user PC market, yes.  But in business, there's still a lot
of people using IBM mainframes and IBM PS/2s to connect to them.  Not
as many as there were, granted, but there's still a lot out there.

And, you'll note, that Mr. Brostigen quantified his statement with
"when it comes to Token Ring and MCA based machines".  Given that IBM
is just about the only person who makes microchannel machines,
and that Token Ring has always been an IBM play area, I don't really

I want to know if anyone knows *why* this happens.  Please post

It goes to buy you a little nametag on the front which says "Compaq".
Oh, and, at least in older Compaqs, a case put together with
nonstandard screws, so that you can't open it without a special tool,
so that you're more likely to use their service department than
a random PC hacker.

On a more serious note, Compaqs and other name-brand quotes are,
perhaps, a little more reliable than hole-in-the-wall made-in-Taiwan
stuff.  But the extra thousands of dollars you spend on them don't
get you any more I/O, not unless you specifically buy a system with
a faster/wider bus.

        Are you sure it isn't because you don't have permission to write
into the directory you started DOOM from? What I did was to make a symlink
in my home directory to the place that I had the DOOM1.WAD file located,
so I could run DOOM right from my home directory. Then the saving & loading
of games worked fine.

I think I read that it is no longer what it was originally intended to be,
however.  ie, it no longer runs on Linux.  I think it now is either the
same applications as before, but on UnixWare, or it is simply an
Internet-access package for Windows.  They took the teeth out of it
after Ray Noorda left.  The new CEO, Bob Frankenberg, is yet another
dull business man with no real interest in his industry.

Not exactly. The exact resolution for ISO A4 format is 1728 pel / 215 mm
horizontally and 3.85 lines/mm in standard an 7.7 lines/mm in fine
resolution vertically. This is about 204 * 98 standard and 204 * 196 fine.

Ummm... If it's an ISA bus, don't expect DMA to above 16M.  You've
only got 24 address lines on an ISA bus, so it's a pretty fundamental
limitation.  With PCI, EISA, or (presumably) MCA, you can get around
this.

Better yet, install nvi 1.34 from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu.  It's the best

Ben,
  Unless I'm very much mistaken, your xdm prompt should
blank out after five minutes anyway.  I can't think of
a good reason for running a screensaver/locker over the
top of an xdm login (call me old-fashioned).  I would
just start the screensaver in my .xsession file, on a
per-user basis. I know it doesn't answer your question
but it just seems like a pointless question.

Did you put a T-connector with 2 terminators on the ethernet connector?
If not, you will get this error as soon as you try to send something.

Ethernet cards must always be connected to a network, and this setup
is the minimal network (only one node, and the two terminators that should
always be at the ends of the network cable)

(of course this assumes you use thinwire)

Subject: How to swap CDs from inside DOSEMU (2nd post)?
Date: 22 Sep 1994 23:04:56 -0700

I have a research program I want to run from dosemu.  It uses several 
CDs and prompts for them to be swapped as needed.  Alternatively, it can
be set up to issue a dos command at each disk swap (such as to dynamically
DOS-mount from a CD server).

I have one CD drive, a Toshiba 3401.  When Linux mounts a disk, it locks the
eject button until the drive is unmounted (correctly so).  So I can't just
swap the disks, if the disk was mounted under Linux.  But I can't get
dosemu to see the drive at all if the disk is not Linux-mounted.

Is there a way to issue a DOS command to umount/prompt/remount a CD under
dosemu?  Or is there a way to make dos map MSCDEX to a linux device driver?
Can lredir load as a named device driver for MSCDEX to see?
The dosemu docs are serriously lacking in this area...

Any help would be appreciated, this is costing me $400 a month in CD charges
and a lot more than that in lost use.
PLEASE SEND IDEAS, NO MATTER HOW WILD!

Xscreensaver works fine under xdm on my PC. You have to disable the
password locking of xscreensaver because there is no user logged in
and the keyboard is grabbed by xdm. I don't know if that is the
solution of your problem. Did you try to disable the Xauthorization in
xdm-config (hmm, is that the right name of the file)?

Nope.  I've noticed this myself.  If you have two Xterm windows up, and
highlight text in the first, then *click* on the second, you no longer
have text selected for cut and paste.

Anyone know how to fix this?
