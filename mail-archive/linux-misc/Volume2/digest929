Hello out there,

now I'm able to *CANCEL* my warning about possible damage of non-green
monitors. Thanks to Craig Groeschel for clarification:

    Because colors are handled differently at 8 and 16 bpp.
    
    8-bit mode uses a color lookup table.  The screen saver writes
    five bytes out to the card, and boom, the lookup table
    returns "black" for every color.  Screen goes dark.
    Very simple very easy.
    
    16-bit mode does not use any such lookup table, so to save
    the screen, I just disabled the CRT controller.  Yes, I know,
    quick and dirty hack.  Anyone please feel free to UTSL.
    
    >And here's the problem: What if my monitor wouldn't like powersaving

    You'll have to pardon me for deleting the FUD in your message.
    There are no special powersaving signals in this case.  When the
    CRT controller is disabled, no signals go out to the monitor.
    It's like having your monitor turned on but your computer turned off.

They also (usually) don't give you a video subsystem that can match
the #9GXE series, or expandable busses.  OTOH, they do include ethernet.
I just saw a flyer for a DEC Alpha.  Its price looked OK, until you
saw just how under-configured the system was.  1024x768 video?
Gimme a break.  One more thing -- how much do they force you to
spend on software "upgrades"?

If you want to install Linux yourself, you should be able to
trade up to a Pentium/PCI/Vision864 system for about the same
money as the system listed above.

You want an S3-801 based card, like an Actix GraphicsEngine32
or STB PowerGraph X-24.  I think Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 comes
in an ISA version, too.  You should be able to find one of
these for US$100 to US$130.

All these boards are quite happy doing 1024x768ni at 256 colors,
with 1M DRAM.  Spending extra bucks on the 2M versions (if available)
probably isn't worth it because of bandwidth limitations.
Under DOS, with unaccelerated drivers, the ISA bus really hurts.
Under XFree86 or MS-Windows, it's no big deal; all the drawing
operations are done with registers anyway, and you are limited
by the 32-bit path from S3-801 to video memory.  STB claims
a 10 to 30% speed penalty compared to the VLB twin.

Why not?  You're all gung ho about defending SWT and publicly accusing me of
being dishonest in my dealings with SWT, and yet you are unwilling to address
the issue of whether or it was dishonest of SWT to write a rubber refund check
and then refuse to pay me the charge my bank charged me for depositing a
rubber check?

Why do you feel that you have the right to make accusations against me, based
on only speculation and supposition, but you aren't willing to discuss
something that SWT did that was obviously wrong and that they have not
disputed doing?

Oh, and by the way, why have you still not answered this, which I wrote to you
in a posting on October 7: "Bob, are you speaking from the point of view of a
satisfied customer of SWT or something more?  Are you and Wu acquaintenaces,
perhaps, or even friends?  You did tell me in E-mail that you are `on
reasonably good terms with Marvin Wu.' What exactly does that mean?"

|> Have you never bounced a check?

Yes, I have.  In college, about seven years ago, once or twice, because I
forgot to transfer money from savings into checking.  I immediately apologized
to the payees, paid the fees that were charged to them, paid the fees that
were charged to me, and transferred money into the account to cover the checks.

Furthermore, my bank was *thought* I've bounced checks a number of times since
then (because of errors on their part, not on mine), but rather than refusing
to cash them, they've cashed them and charged me a bounce fee, because they
know I'm good for the money.

Now, let's analyze the differences here:

1) I'm a person, and I bounced personal checks.  SWT is a company, and it
bounced company checks.

2) I apologized immediately when I bounced checks, before being contacted by
the payee, and paid their fees.  SWT didn't try to contact me about the
bounce, despite the fact that they should have known about it before I did,
and didn't offer to pay the bounce fee I was charged (and, in fact, has
ignored my repeated E-mail asking for them to pay the fee).

3) My bank pays checks that they think I've bounced, even when they're large,
because they know I'm good for the money (I do, after all, have a savings
account with them with enough money in it to cover the checks, and I've never
written a check I didn't have enough money to cover from my combined
accounts), and because they can charge me the $20 bouncing fee even if they
pay the check.  SWT's bank refused to pay their rubber check (implying,
perhaps, that the bank doesn't have faith in their ability to cover it?).

4) The checks I bounced were seven years ago.  The checks (plural, because as
I've mentioned, over people have told me they've had the same experience with
SWT) SWT has bounced are very recent.

I might still be angry at SWT about wasting my time and making me pay
shipping, but if they had apologized for bouncing the check and offered to pay
the $4 charge my bank charged me, my opinion of them would be many notches
higher than it is now.

VLB won't help a lot under linux, as the driver only supports good'ol WD mode.
Instead of paying for on board cache memory you'd better put RAM directly on
your system : Linux will manage it more efficiently.
I have upgraded my box to 16M and now it really flies under X (it's only a

How about calling it "regression"?  Too bad it's still necessary.  There
is evidence, though, that the WWW community will soon address the multiple-
language "problem" by extending HTML+ appropriately.  I can't wait for the
day when I can just make papers that quote several languages available in
electronic form, and can relegate hardcopy to onside as-needed production!

Subject: Problem with TERM
Date: 11 Oct 1994 17:27:06 GMT

I downloaded TERM 2.14 (I believe, the lastest one on sunsite) and
compiled it on an ultrix machine here and on my 1.0.9 Linux at home.
I used Seyon to connect, ran linecheck, updated ~/.term/termrc
with correct escape and ignore values on each side,
and start term (with the suggested command line options from Term.HOWTO),
quit seyon without hanging up, and started term locally (again with
suggested command line params including "-r") and tried "trsh"
and after pressing returns a few times I get the prompt, I can do
a little and then it just stops transmitting for no obvious reason.
I can see the send/receive lights flashing on the modem, so the
two sides are talking to each other, BUT it is dead. At this point,
if I open another window and try trsh again, it doesn't connect
to the other term at all and I can just press "^C" to quit the new
trsh, but the original trsh is locked. When I close everything down
(sometimes echo '00000' > /dev/modem works) and look in the log
file on linux I see an error message about "gethostbyname...".
On the ultrix side I see nothing or '00000'.

Is it possible that linecheck missed something? (I have not had
better luck so far with expanding the escapes, but when I tried
them covering a lot more I had no luck with term, now  at least
it starts to work).

I have not had term work correctly for more than 1-2 minutes.
During that 1-2 minutes, the 2nd time, I tried to use "txconn"
but I couldn't get it to give me a good display name. Hmm!!

Do I need to get a newer version of linux? Do I need an older version
of term? I don't get it!!

But the DX/4-100 *can* be run as a dx/2-- one of its pins (previously
a no-connect on other 486's) will select whether the external clock is
multipled by 2 or 3, depending on whether it's tied high or low.  So,
invert the usual state of this pin, up the bus clock to 50MHz, and you
should get a substantial performance gain (assuming the rest of the
motherboard, in particular the cache SRAMs, can keep up).  This
selector pin is in the specs, but I've never heard of anyone using it.
It should also be possible to overclock a DX/4 a little bit without
bad thermal problems, since it's a 3.3V chip...

Date: 11 Oct 1994 17:31:41 GMT



  A couple of days ago I posted about not being able to use
 sz to download files from a Linux system to a DOS system.
 
  Both are using 14.4k modems with 19200 as DTE speed. Both
 are using RTC/CTS hardware flow control.
 
  I discovered yesterday that if the connection is made at
 a slower speed sz works. As long as throughput is below
 1500 cps all is OK. When above this the DOS machine receives
 the first 19k and then starts to choke, giving timeouts and
 CRC errors, etc
 
  Anyone know why this is ? Any possible solutions ? Is there
 some other source for a Z Modem transfer program ( or indeed
 any other program that allows me to download files from 
 Linux to DOS using serial modem connection ) ?
 
  Thanks in advance.

Answer: they don't.  What they sell is a REPLACEMENT processor, the DX2/66.
You pull your old chip out and plug the DX2-66 in instead.  Since its 
EXTERNAL speed is still 33mhz, it looks to the rest of your machine like 
your old chip, but INTERNALLY it process instructions twice as fast.

This is quite right.  It *is* a pet peeve of mine.  Hmmm.  I guess my
only worry is that if someone designs a system with no thought of multi-
linguality, this will be hard to graft on later.  Bidirectional wordwrap,
though not exceedingly complex, is hard to work in after the fact.  Input
methods for Japanese characters, contextual Arabic forms, and so on also
need to be at least given a nod early on.

These things don't all need to be implemented.  Just taken into the over-
all scope of the project so that, for example, someone who's interested
(or funded) could see to it that such capabilities were added.

Does this make sense?

Word processing is a very specialized type of programming, involving all
sorts of knowledge that most programmers don't have - in particular how
writers in many different fields do their work.  Typography is also quite
specialized, as are various low-level details such as printer interfaces
and drivers, and GUIs.  Then there is the problem of coding schemes, such
as Unicode.  I doubt many technical people have much training in the kinds
of considerations that go into the design philosophy of Unicode, or of
SGML, for that matter (which should also come into the picture, like it
or not).

It's no wonder to me that it's been difficult to find anyone to fill this
void.  There are a lot of us out here who could fill one or another part
of the void.  We need the technical equivalent of a "Refridgerator" Perry
to fill this one, though.

What's an idle daemon? :-)
Does that have something to do with idle-time?? :)
