Hi! Has anyone got Tierra (or any other AI/ALife program) working under
Linux, and if so could you tell me where to get it and how to build it
(if it requires special building for Linux)?

Thanks.

There is work on a QLogic SCSI PCMCIA driver and a New Media SCSI PCMCIA
driver.  There needs to be some kernel modifications before these driver
can be completed.  I do not know of any work being done on the Adaptec/
Trantor SlimSCSI card.  Are the programming specs freely available
(non-NDA)?

Subject: Driver support for PS/2 (MCA) version of SMC/WD?
Date: Tue, 27 Sep 1994 04:47:05 GMT

I have been working on getting Linux up and running on an IBM PS/2 Model
70, which has not been an enviable task, to say the least!  But, beggars
can't be choosers, either.

I have no problem with the Adaptec AHA-1640 SCSI host adapter, which Linux
detects and uses as an AHA-1542.  My 1.7GB SCSI-2 drive and 2GB Archive tape
drive work flawlessly under Linux.

Which leaves me stuck with the following problem:  network support.  I
originally had an NE/2 adapter in this machine, which was not supported by
Linux at all.  For that matter, the Crynwr packet drivers for the NE/2
under DOS don't work either (Russ Nelson says he hasn't tested them).

So, to make a long story short, I was able to scrounge an IBM PS/2 Ethernet
Adapter /A.  This is a microchannel version of an SMC Ultra, from what I
have been able to tell.  Under DOS, the same SMC_WD.COM packet driver is used
for this card, as for an ISA based SMC Ultra or WD8013.  Biggest difference
is that the I/O port address range is up at 0x800, rather than 0x300 - no 
big deal, and the RAM address is fixed in the PS/2 setup program.

Problem is, even with the 0x800 I/O port range added to the scan list in the
WD.C and SMC-ULTRA.C kernel driver, the card just doesn't work right (under
Linux - works fine under DOS).  I get TX status 3 (timeout on TX) when
attempting to access the network.

Looking through the Crynwr packet drivers shows that there are differences
between operation of the NS (8390?) chip used on these boards on the ISA
vs. MCA bus.  Specifically, the MCA bus has twice as fast a clock cycle as
the ISA bus.  The Crynwr driver inserts extra delays if it detects operation
on a Microchannel machine.  Other differences are some extra setup in
certain registers on the NIC's ASIC.

Has anyone done this work already?  I.e., does anyone have Linux working
with an IBM Ethernet /A?  If so, PLEASE share it with me!

If not, then I intend to rewrite the SMC/WD kernel drivers in Linux to
support the microchannel version, as my contribution to the Linux
community.  I just hate to duplicate the work, or spend time I don't
have on this project...

Thanks!

There is currently no "drivers" for the Matrox MGA.  There is,
however, a private company  developing a replacement Xserver for Linux
that includes MGA support. Xmga will go into BETA some time this
month, I believe the beta period will be rather short, as they've put
LOTS of work into the pre-beta testing;).  This will be a commercial
product, I THINK it retails for around $200, but I'm not sure.  My
point of contact there is inappropriate for pricing information, but
is you call Matrox they have the information.

In itself it sounds like an excellent idea. Don't forget to include
UMSDos though!

The only snag I see is that the typical DOS/Windows user that you have
in mind, actually is better served by his/her MS-Windows system. If
you only use one task at a time and don't put too much load on the
machine, there is no inherent need to use Linux. The typical Windows
application is sufficient for that and certainly 'smoother' in looks
and use.

Real operating systems only come into their own when you have
complicated tasks and heavy loads on the machine, like program
development. I feel that from the beginning the 'newbie' (Yes, I was
one myself not too long a time ago and some might still consider me
one) should be able to experiment with the features in which
Unix/Linux/X is way better than DOS and MS-Windows. Unfortunately that
are exactly the applications that you proposed to omit.

So at least you should make certain that 'upgrading' is very, very easy!

Paai.

Calm down, Neal.... calm down.

One of Digi's employees is currently at work on a PC/Xe driver for Linux,
with release due in a month or two.  I suspect he's listening, and when
they ask him what's next, he'll say "ISDN".  :-)

Subject: NEWBIE!: How do i Print from GS (not over LPR!)

Hello Brothers & Sisters :)

I believe, It's one time more a very simple newbie question...
(Some of you would Think, RTFM, but I've done it, but i dunno found  
anything...)

How do I Print from GhostScript 2.6.x directly to my
 HP-Deskjet/Laserjet.

I have a PostScript File that's over 1.6 Megs great, and if i
try to Print over the LPR Daemon, i got after some time and many
Pages an errormessage like:

"Spoolfile to great", or so... (Sorry, I haven't noticed it,
                                and now i'am sitting in my office :/(  .)

If i let GS write the output via -sOutputFile=/test/out.prn
into an PRNfile it goes perfectly, but the file are over 36Megs
in great (Uhmm...) The same, if i wrote it into singlefiles for
each page with .../out%d.prn.
It works perfectly (and the copy it in binarymode to lpt1 via MS-DOG)

What i searching for, is a function to print directly to
the lpt1/lp0 Port from GS. NOT VIA THE LPR Daemon !
Otherwise, if it should go over the LPR-Daemon, how do i say him,
"Start printing after each 10 Pages!", because i don't wanna get
the same errormessage like yesterday...

By the way, the Document is the LDP-Install-guide :))))

Please send Suggestions and helpful hints via eMail...

Since you mentioned C++, I would say go for Linux. I think only Linux
gives you the best C++ support in stdio. Under Linux, the C++ iostream
is built on the top of libio in the Linux C library. You don't have to
worry about anything.

This works with Cnews to get news via UUCP.  You tell it what groups
you want from your newserver, and everytime you connect you invoke the
program to retrieve new articles.

    I'm happy to help you try and configure it and news if you email
me privately.  In a nutshell you'll have to first configure Cnews,
then add a couple of files for slurp.  Slurp itself is easy to install
and use.

There is an RFC which covers this very topic.  Unfortunately, I do not recall 
which RFC it was.  However, the point is that there are several blocks of 
address space which have been excluded from internet mapping to allow 
stand-alone networks.  Several blocks of class-A, B, and C addresses have been 
reserved for this purpose.  The only block I recall is the one I use 
internally, which spans 172.16.x.x through 172.31.x.x (16 class b subnets).  I 
usually use 172.16.machine.1 for my private hosts, and special addresses such 
as 172.16.machine.100 for snmp traps on those machines, etc...

Of course, if you plan to connect your private network to the internet, you 
need to use a machine with a valid (non-private) ip address for the ppp or slip 
device.  I have not done this yet, so perhaps someone else can clerify the 
routing issues when connecting private ip space to the public internet...
