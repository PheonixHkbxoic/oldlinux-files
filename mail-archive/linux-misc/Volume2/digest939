Subject: 2nd RFD: comp.os.linux reorganization
Date: 14 Oct 1994 15:45:43 -0400

                     REQUEST FOR DISCUSSION (RFD)
                     comp.os.linux reorganization

Summary: An extensive reorganization of the comp.os.linux hierarchy is
         proposed.  It includes the creation of five unmoderated
         groups, the renaming of three unmoderated groups, and the
         creation of one moderated group.

Proponent: Dave Sill, de5@ornl.gov 

History: This proposed reorganization was prompted originally by the
         excessive level of traffic in comp.os.linux.help.  Following
         a straw poll conducted by the proponent, an RFD was posted
         for breaking comp.os.linux.help into various subgroups and
         creating comp.os.linux.answers for separating the
         documentation and announcements currently posted to
         comp.os.linux.announce.  During the discussion period, it
         became evident that it would be preferable to create the
         groups directly under comp.os.linux, rather than splitting
         comp.os.linux.help.  The previous RFD reflected that change.

         This revision of the RFD incorporates several other changes
         resulting from the previous 11 days of discussion.

1) Create group: comp.os.linux.advocacy (unmoderated)

 Charter: For discussion of the benefits of Linux compared to other
          operating systems.

2) Create group: comp.os.linux.answers (moderated)

 Charter: For posting Linux FAQs, How-To's, READMEs and other
          documents that answer questions about Linux.  This will
          help keep the traffic down in other c.o.l.* groups and will
          leave comp.os.linux.announce for true announcements.
          C.o.l.answers will be moderated by Matt Welsh
          (mdw@cs.cornell.edu), the moderator of c.o.l.announce.

3) Create group: comp.os.linux.development.apps (unmoderated)

 Charter: For questions and discussion regarding the writing of
          applications for Linux and the porting of applications to
          Linux.

4) Create group: comp.os.linux.hardware (unmoderated)

 Charter: For questions and discussion specific to a particular piece
          of hardware, e.g., "can this system run Linux?", "how do I
          use this disk drive with Linux?", etc.

5) Create group: comp.os.linux.networking (unmoderated)

 Charter: For questions and discussion relating to networking or
          communications including Ethernet boards, serial
          communications, SLIP, etc.

6) Create group: comp.os.linux.x (unmoderated)

 Charter: For questions and discussion relating to X Window System,
          version 11, compatible software including servers, clients,
          libraries, and fonts, running under Linux.  XFree86 issues
          not unique to Linux will be directed to
          comp.windows.x.i386unix.

7) Rename group: comp.os.linux.development (unmoderated)
             to: comp.os.linux.development.system (unmoderated)

 Charter: For questions and discussion regarding the development of
          the Linux operating system proper: kernel, device drivers,
          loadable modules.

8) Rename group: comp.os.linux.admin (unmoderated)
             to: comp.os.linux.setup (unmoderated)

 Charter: For questions and discussion relating to Linux installation
          and system administration.

 Rationale: "setup" is clearer than "admin", and is a more obvious
            place for installation questions.

9) Rename group: comp.os.linux.help (unmoderated)
             to: comp.os.linux.misc (unmoderated)

 Rationale: Comp.os.linux.help is too general.  It currently overlaps
            comp.os.linux.admin, and if the proposed groups are
            created, will overlap comp.os.linux.hardware and
            comp.os.linux.networking as well as comp.os.linux.setup.

      Note: The intent here is actually to remove comp.os.linux.help,
            not to rename it to .misc, which already exists.
            Unfortunately, it's not possible to remove it directly.

                                    c.o.l.x

After a discussion period of 21-30 days, if there are not overwhelming
objections to any of the proposed groups, there will be a Call For
Votes (CFV) posted to the groups as this RFD.  The voting period will
be at least 21 days.  Each proposal that passes, by receiving 100 more
YES votes than NO votes and twice as many YES votes as NO votes,
will be implemented.

Absolutely.  If I can get 8 256k 30 pin SIMMs, I'm going to set up my
old 386DX40 motherboard this way (I've got a few spare ethernet cards
laying around anyway).

You might just want to run free DOS/Windows TCP/IP software for that
function though.  If you just boot up and run KA9Q, you should get
bitchin' performance out of a box like that.  KA9Q should have better
network performance than the Linux kernel does, I would think.

I get it...

486DX2-66 has 1/2 the performance of a hypothetical real DX-66,
486DX3-100 would have meant 1/3 the performance of a DX-100,
so then DX4-100 must mean...

The primary difference is that I personally feel that we don't need another
WYSIWYG X based wordprocessor. It exists in basic form in EZ.

However what's missing is the functionality along the lines of early
WordPerfect or Word applications. Text based, formatting hidden from the
user, prints to lots of printers, basic wordprocessing functionality of
font size and type, text placement, highlights like bold, italics, underline
etc., and basic table generation.

In fact HWP is making headway towards this goal.

I think we can integrate existing editor (JED), menu(dialog), mouse(the
selection replacement of the Mouseless Commander), formatter (QuikScript),
and renderer (GhostScript) into a workable system that can meet the basic
wordprocessing demands of most folks.

Comments?

Hi guys !
We have a very heterogeneous network with the Operating Systems :
Solaris, Sun-Os, Os2, DOS/WINDOWS, MAC-OS, CLIX,OS 400, IRIX, AIX, HP-UX,
sco-xenix, linux, ... 
Linux can easy be used as a print server for most of the OS's .
Most of the unix/os2 systems print to the linux-box using lpr (berkley printing
 system), and the dos/windows systems print files whith pcnfs own printing mechanism .
It would be very nice if I can find an implementation of the system-V print spooling
for linux, because there are some unix systems which only have a system-V style print spooling implemented!
Any information is appreciated !
Thanks in advance !

PS:  It 's the third time I'm posting my problem , I never got an answer !

   You will have to grab the latest version of the Linux kernel from a
   suitable FTP site first.  Then,

   cd /usr/src
   umask 022
   rm -rf linux
   tar xvvfz linux-1.1.xx.tar.gz
   cd linux
   make config                  <- Select suitable options
   make dep
   make clean
   make zlilo
   cat /vmlinuz > /dev/fd0              <- Makes boot disk

   -- 

Actually there are 'ncr1  & ncr2' disks under 
        sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/distributions/slackware/slakware
which I installed as custom and did a setup again & created a boot image.

Works like a charm!

The lead on Unix was pretty great too. I could have bought a Unix for my
PC about 10 years ago. But I chose to wait until something free came along.
I've got the source code, and I can modify it however I like.

Why is a word processor any different? I've never spent $250 for a word
processor. That's why I use the copy that's on my machine at work. I also
hate a lot of the bugs in MS Word, but I can't do a damn thing about them.
I have to live with Word's limitations forever.

   I use a Install bootdisk with an updated NCR boot image which works well.
   When I installs Linux, I use custom disks ncr1 & ncr2. When these disks are installed I get
   an error message wich tells me that there are maybe missing som files on the disks, but I chose to continue,
   and everything seems to work well. (I know that the filesizes at the disk is a bit different than what
   displays in ncrdisc1 & ncrdisc2, but i just asume that there's maybe an difference in the way that unix and dos counts bytes..)

   Anyhow, in the setup I choose to not install scsi & ide files located in a1, but instead i select ncr later on.

   When setup makes a bootup floppy, it seems to take to short time to make it, and it will not work when i try to boot on it either. 
   If I include scsi or ide support from disk a1, then the bootdisk that setup makes will boot, but the system will not be able to connect
   to my scsi drives.

   My conclusion is that i either do something wrong, or that i am missing som files. Anyone that can give me som help here?


In custom setup, did you tell it 'ncr' or 'ncr1'. You should say 'ncr' as
it knows there are 2 disks!

I did this and had no problems.

Without being too specific...  It is impossible to install or run Linux
on a
Quadra 610 DOS compatible, even if you install it using a PC to a SCSI
drive and
try to run it on the Quadra.  Apple did some tricky low level things to
get the
Houdini to work, and as a result, anything that wants to talk to the
controller
is SOL. OS/2 has the same problem.

The problem is not fixed with the new Houdini cards.

I am working on a port of Linux that will run on the Houdini; however,
Apple is
being very uncooperative about releasing some of the technical
information I need
to write the drivers.

I'm about halfway there, and I've been working on it for 6 months.

I think this will fail on the most recent version of Uri's dip.
It eats CONNECT, and errlvl is set to 1 upon connection (errlvl
is set to different things depending on what is returned: 0-OK,
1-CONNECT, 2-BUSY, 3-NO CARRIER, etc).
