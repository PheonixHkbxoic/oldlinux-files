Remember that even if you can get the refresh rates for 320x200 on your
monitor, it's going to look really ugly!  Remember CGA?  That's 320x200.

When you use the normal PC VGA mode of 320x200, it's really 640x400 but with
each pixel doubled in both directions.
This is the key here.  Would be nice to have XFree hook
into that particular VGA (MCGA) mode (ho ho ho), but now we can't expect
the Xfree team to write something that has no purpose other than Doom,
can we?

Not many people will be able to use this set because of the extremely
low dot clock. The ATI Mach64's only go as low as 25. Correct me if
I'm wrong, though.

Me and my 486dx2 16Megs linux system via a slip connection to the net

We were very dubious about doom running over the internet and over a
slip line AND even past a firewall on one end across the country like
this; however, it worked amazingly enough. It was slow and jerky but
still playable - 3 hours of mindless fun on account of it. I'd
recommend against ftp'ing anything big on a slip while playing doom,

From: robert@plasma.apana.org.au (Robert Kroes)
...
   I would like to know how I can create a Slackware boot disk (the one used
   to install Linux from scratch) and install a kernel of my choice...

   Why? So I can make use of an alpha network driver to perform an NFS install
   and save copying 100+ MB of Slackware 2.0 on to floppies :-)

I have exactly the same need !

   I've formatted a diskette with "fdformat", 
   added my kernel with "dd if=/zImage of=/dev/fd0", 
   created a ramdisk with "rdev -r /dev/fd0 1440", 
   and changed the root file system with "rdev /dev/fd0 /dev/ram" (I think :-)

   The bit I can't work out is how to tweak it so it asks for the ROOT disk, 
   and copies that filesystem to the ramdisk, after the kernel has loaded...

Done the same thing execept that I did  "rdev /dev/fd0 /dev/fd0".
After boot the system ask for the  root diskette, but when I insert it
I get errormessages like 'IO-error on /dev/fd0' and 'could not read
masterblock'. 


   Please don't tell me this requires a specially modified kernel :-)

   Any and all hints gratefully accepted (email especially appreciated since
   this *ensures* I can't miss your response :-)

You havent't found a solution - have you ?

On my 486/66 16 Megs - ATI Mach32 PCI card it is very smooth

at triple pixel.

Excellent work by iD and Dave Taylor - this will get my

Just another set of experiences:

I have installed both the SUmmer94 and Fall94 Yygdrasil and found them 
simple and easy.  Of the two, though, the latest is much better for a 
beginner as they have streamlined and improved the installation a bit.

I don't really understand the other posters problem with X.  Doesn't your 
card emulate a basic standard vga?  There is a standard vga driver in the 
yygdrasil release that aught to let you get X up and running on ANYTHING 
that is really a VGA of somekind...  You coudl then use X for your 
configuring.  The Summer94 was a bit of a pain in that I don't like to 
run X myself, as i have a slow machine (386-33, origial Oak stock vga.)
The fall94 yygdrasil however explains hwo to do all the most important 
stuff from the command line.

Granted I have a little Sparc admin experience (not alot, just a little) 
but i on the whole found it easy to work with.  Note that that there IS 
one major problem in teh currnet Fall94 Yygdrasil release-- apparently 
the kernel in this release has a broken sony-cd driver (it dies witha  
null pointer refernce if you have a sony-interface cd in your machine.)  
I assume Yygdrasil is going to correct this soon...

       an "ads" hierarchy has been proposed.  If you need such, create it!
       You may also find that certain biz newsgroups may tolerate private

*This* is a valid reason for a biz group.  It is in fact the reason
biz exists.  But since the comp.os.linux.* groups already seem to
permit this it's not a reason to form a new hierarchy.  IMO, of course.

Really, I have the opposate problem.  I can file my gun and have the sound

I have a SB16 and a ET4000 video card.  This only happens when the system is
