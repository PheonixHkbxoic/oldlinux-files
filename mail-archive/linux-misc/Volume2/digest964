There is a reason for buying a 386DX/40 MB now.  Like I said, I bought 
one for $90, but I've heard of them selling for around $50.  All of the 
good ones will take a 486DLC/40 and a math co (upgrade path!).  In the 
near future, I will probably be buying a DLC to get a bit of a speed 
boost.  Then again, I may wait, save my $$, and get a DX2/66 or 80.

Can I suggest a working hypothesis? It's on the lines of "If you can find

of that page". However, I want to avoid issues that involve the scanning-in
of images and colour laser printers that cost 6 figures in $$$.

A more humble paradigm is: If a black-&-white printed page could have
been set up by a traditional compositor placing pre-cast lumps of metal
in a block, then the production of that page can be computerized, and
what's more the user interface can be character-based if you wish to be
that "primitive" (and that's not meant to be an insult either - it can be
extremely efficient).

Now that paradigm covers the hand-setting of printed pages where you could
have representatives of many different languages and scripts all on
one page. It's been done many times, and excellent examples dating
from the 19th C can be found in libraries. To computerize it, however,
you need the complete set of founts for the languages you will use,
in a common "format" (i.e. each "lump of metal" needs reference-points
in a standard format, so that the computer knows what to do with them).
Standard PostScript does this with the commoner Latin characters and symbols.
Downloadable stroked definitions allow other "lumps of metal" to be
"cast". So ONE QUESTION is whether the PostScript approach is adequate
for all likely Multilingual needs. My guess is that it is.

Given that, the NEXT QUESTION is going to be HOW to represent
instructions to the computer to "compose" the page. Not WHETHER:-
according to the above "humble paradigm", it IS possible.

But I think, rather than spend time wondering how to jury-rig a job lot
of tools to do a rough and incomplete approximation to this, if
the ML-WP project is to be serious the basic planning has to start with the
issues just discussed.

I am running an AMD 386DX40 MB, OPTI chipset, AMI BIOS rev. 8/93,
20 ns cache RAM, 8 Mb 70 ns DRAM (3 chip/SIMM), and I have my VLB
IDE/F/S/P/G card set to 33MHz, no wait states. (The VLB I/O card is some
Made In China brand, Pine or something like that.)

I am running Linux and OS/2 2.1 at 2-1-1-1, and 0 wait states for
cache and memory access. DOOM runs fine under Linux and as a
DOS full window process under OS/2. (It isn't very fast but you'd
be amazed at what a 386/40+VLB+cheap S3 card can do.)

I am running the AT bus at CPU/3 or 13.3 MHz, w/o problems.

Under MS-DOS 6.2.1 however, DOOM flakes out on these settings, and
I have to change to 3-1-1-1 and 1 wait state to cache and main mem.,
and lower the AT-bus to CPU/4. Weird; another strike against DOS?

I have done 5 or 6 compiles of the Linux kernel w/o any problems;
on a 486/66 MB I had the compile would break until I added wait states
to the cache.

I suspect sample to same variations in MB and cache chips are
greater than touted, and may explain some of this flakey behavior
especially with low priced MBs.

After reading the thread about Yggdrasil 1994 Fall release,
I just want to let you all know that a week ago I purchased
a Linux+BSD rel.4 CD-ROM from TransAmeritech and enjoyed it
very much. It has this very attractive option to quickly install
full-fledged Linux on top of your DOS file system (they call
it 'test drive'). After trying this, I've made a regular
installation to discover no problem worth to mention.
I think the CD-ROM is a pretty good bang for its 30 bucks.

If you have ispell, what you can do is make a symlink from ispell to spell.
This is mentioned in the ispell man page.  What it says, is that if you 
run ispell as "spell" (i.e. a symlink), it will operate as the original
unix spell did.  After creating a symlink from ispell to spell, my Pine 
spell-checking works great!

        A couple of things.

        1). Every year Congress reviews various things, one of which is 
the cable act. In 1992 (or thereabouts), they asked Cable (or rather, 
their PACs) what they wanted changed to improve their service. Cable 
responded that they would like the ability to do NO-KNOCK SEARCHES of 
private residences with HIRED ARMED GUARDS (not cops). Why? "cable 
thieves" was the response. That's right, Joe Schmoe hooks up that black 
box he got from his buddy so he can watch Plaboy for free, and the next 
thing he knows his door is broken down without warning, and armed men are 
ripping apart his entertainment center. Fortunatly, Congress has a few 
more brains than most people account for, and of course told them no 
chance in hell.
        By now you are asking "what's this got to do with copyright 
violations?" Well, The essence here is that's exactly what ol' Joe was 
doing: Violating Copyright. And there are people out there that take it 
rather seriously, especially when they are losing money on it. And some 
of them have some clout where it can do a LOT of damage to the freedoms 
that are a basic part of America. So it boils down to respect; Respect 
someones freedom to protect something (even second-hand), and you won't 
force these people with (probably far too much) power to take action 
against EVERYONES freedom.

The scripts typically work with what is called a "Hayes compatable" modem.
There is a very large list of modems which are in this category.

It depends.  It would force you to buy a "genuine" DX2-80 (read: spend more
money) -- although someone said it was only about $20 more--in this case, it
seems to be almost stupid to continue to make the 66Mhz version!

>|> But a DX2-80 can't be just a relabeled, overclocked DX2-66.

You're missing the point, I think:  A DX2-66 system has a motherboard with
a clock crystal that enables the system to run at 33Mhz (if I'm not mistaken,
the crystal *is* 66Mhz).  If I have a motherboard that allows me to set
multiple clock rates (and I do :) than I can rip the xtal out, replace it
with a faster one, and set the jumpers to say I'm running at 40Mhz, not 33.
"overclocking" in this case, means to run the chip out of spec by running a
chip designed for 33Mhz at 40Mhz.  I think you misunderstood me. Do you
understand now?  If not, maybe someone can do a better job than me:)
