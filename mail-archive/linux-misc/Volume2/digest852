Date: 28 Sep 1994 22:34:15 -0700

Ok, I didn't know QNX costs major money.  So I am considering
either 386bsd or linux.  One person said I should get linux because
386bsd is monolithic (controlled I guess), while linux is non-monolithic.
Now the question is, which os better?  Better as in...

1) least bugs, and stable IMPORTANT!
2) more software available that runs on it
3) faster
4) more compliance to POSIX (I think standards are good, or am I wrong)
5) more people using it.
6) more support for third-party hardware (VLB, EISA, modems, etc) IMPORTANT!
7) platform for programming.

I hope someone can seriously asnwer these questions.  Note that Im not
trying to start a flame.  I appropriately crossposted only to the
relevant newsgroups that discuss these two operating systems.  I
don't want to waste time downloading 50 or so megabytes and find out
that the other OS is better.  Has anyone actually used both systems?

"... and the answer is..."

Although several people responded to my post, no one really had an answer 
I hadn't tried before. :(  In searching throught the SCSI-HOWTO, however, 
I *did* come across a note that proved to be the answer to the problem.

Around line 840 or so, there appears three lines of code like thus:

        DATA = ...
        CONTROL = .... |
                        (stuff...);

Swapping the order from DATA, CONTROL to CONTROL, DATA worked.

Thanks to all who emailed with suggestions!!

I was bored here today so I decided to build povray with -mpentium -O4
to see if it will work.  It won't.  You need to -O2 a couple of files
otherwise you get a seg.fault...

Here is how to do it..

get the povray-2.2l.src.tar.gz
edit Makefile to add -mpentium -O4 to the CFLAGS
make
rm objects.o
rm xwindows.o

re-compile object.c & xwindows.c with -O2  (using -O4 on these two
   files will break povray...)

type make again to build binaries...

I'm just now running a test on it to see if its any faster but it
should be the render.c is -O4  which is the most inportant :)

If people want I can put a binarie tgz up on sunsite.  let me know..

Win4WG is just Windows 3.1 with networking built in - definitly NOT
multi-user.  As for NT, I don't know about NT Advanced Server, but the
normal NT is single user.  It is multi user in the sense that it has
file ownership and such, but only one person can be using it at one time
because you can only log in on the console, unless you use some third
party program (and you can do that in some ways under Windows 3.1, and
even under DOS).

        For those too busy/lazy to find this out from other sources, the 
best way to get *YOUR* printer working under Linux or X-Windows' Andrew 
or GhoastView or whatever, is to ftp sunsite.unc.edu and go to soemthing 
like /pub/Linux/HOWTO and get Printing-HOWTO. It is in ascii and you can 
copy it to your DOS partition and print it from there...then follow the 
instrustions. now, suprise suprise for those who are used to being spoon 
feed what to do, you will have to find out some info on your printer. 
(e.g. an Epson Stylus 800 is not a "Stylus" or someversion of that, it's 
an ESC/P2.
        If you play enough you'll get it right (probably).

I started following the Linux development closely around the time of
0.10, on alt.os.linux.  Unfortunately I had only a 286 back then, and
0.95 (which probably should have been called 0.20) came out right
before I got my new nifty 486, so I never got the pleasure of running
an 0.1x version.  :-(  Still, I remember those early kernels... when I
guess the Linux kernel had a half-life of at most a few days, and when
shared libraries had a *date*, and you had to have the exactly right
version or it wouldn't work... (so you ended up with 5 or 6 shared
library versions, and still 80% of your binaries were statically linked).

I remember the thrill of the first time I got an X cursor up on my
screen... I think it was then I realized Linux was never going to be
just a toy like Minix.

I was also considered rather loony when I set up one of the PC's in my
research lab to run Linux... we were going to use it as an X-terminal,
and it involved running a program called X11d since the version of X
floating around was made before the Linux kernel had Internet sockets.
The kernel was either 0.97 or 0.98; can't remember.  Sure it crashed
every once in a while, but basically it worked... and it worked well
enough that I got to buy a *dedicated* Linux machine about a year
later.

I am interested in using an Ungerman Bass Ethernet card, model UB NIU PC/EOTP.
However, I do not seem to be able to locate information regarding linux and
this card.  My searches have yielded nothing. If anyone has used, or knows
about compatibility of this card, I would greatly appreciate it. It is possible
that the card emulates a 3com or something else more predominant, and I would
love to hear from you if you know anything about these Ungerman-Bass cards as
they relate to Linux.  Thanks!

Yes it is. There is a lot of talk on the norwegian

The subterfuge is in pretending that a (gmp) dependent body of code
isn't dependent just by virtue of being distributed separately.
It is a change in packaging, nothing more.  Your analogy would

Wrong on both counts.
WFW is just the same old Windows 3.1 with built in networking. Whoopee.
MicroSloth calls Windows NT "serially multiuser" wich just means that
people can take turns using it (just like OS/2).  Whoopee.

It's what the old schoolteachers teach English-speaking students, and
most never stop to think whether it's true or not.  As far as I can tell
the a in bad is actually longer than the a in plate, though they call
the second one long.

If I remember right, the definitive way of pronouncing Linux is something
most English speakers can't comfortably say:  lee-nooks (spelled using
that inimitable pseudo-phonetic writing we English speakers use).  Tho
even this ain't right.  The ee is shorter, and the oo is fronted.  We got
no such vowels in English!

Before this blows up out of control, note that it is in the FAQ!

I agree totally, I have many friends who have used Unix on the school
systems, and would like SOME of the features without the difficult
setup that is inherrent in a unix system (which does also add a lot of
performance benefits, but, some people just don't want to be

I really don't like this idea, single use mode, especially in Unix
gives the person way too much ability to mess up the system, maby if
the distribution added a user name automatically and a password in the

This is a good idea, although I think there are people who will want a
csh also... but ??? .. and to translate .BAT files (or maby even be
able to run them with a command that took them as input...) shouldn't
be too hard, as there are very few DOS commands..

Possibly perl, and an emacs clone (jove possibly, as it is small, and
it is still a text editor), or even pico so that they have a
text-based editing program..

Hmmm.. I think as maby an addon SLIP would be good, (same with Mosaic)

Great idea, I think that you should have a setup-program that would
also let you choose possibly 800x600 resolution, or maby even enhanced
resolutions that are standard to specific cards, to elinate any
problems with people wanting more space on the display...

You might want to include ghostscript that is configured for quite a
few major printers, and have it be able to automatically configure an
LPR filter that will let them print postscript from their
printers.. that way they dont' have to worry about not being able to
print without a lazer printer.. (minimal fonts etc...)

That is true.  I don't know if it is true anywhere else in Finland,
but at our department, if one teaches a course and does not have a
credit for it, one gets the credit.  One must, of course, have the
the necessary knowledge and skills to teach the course first (lest
anyone thinks we hire just anyone as a teacher).  For some curious
reason, the people in charge think Linus can teach the courses he
teaches.

Agreed. In a nutshell, though, the things that you plan to strip away from
Linux are the things that make Linux a powerful operating system. If the
typical home PC user doesn't want to mess with the complexities of Linux,
then I think it's safe to say that Linux isn't for them.

If you're just going to run single user then why run Linux?

If you're just going to make Linux look as brain dead as DOS, why run Linux?

I'll remove the rest of your iedas to save bandwidth, but my opinion is that
if you have a user that uses DOS and Windows and is happy running what they
have, why water down a Linux distribution just so they can do the same
thing? That's foolish.
