Ok, but why don't you use the standard termcap.h?
Is ncurses' termcap.h is just meant for ncurses?
If so, perhaps you could use a different name (ntermcap.h?)

I would hope that it would be installed in
/usr/local/include/ncurses, myself.  Gcc, and most other
compilers search there without -I flags. (I think!)

BTW, thanks for writing such a great package.  My programs so
far run identically under Solaris 2.3.
You may treat my questions as stemming from ignorance :-)

Not hard - I can write you a benchmark to show either is better. The older
*BSD kernels were slower especially on a 4Mb machine due to lack of shared
libraries and other things. On the whole they are pretty similar.

Subject: Linux on a Thinkpad 720 - 160MB disk, How?
Date: 6 Oct 1994 12:36:25 -0400

Has anybody put Linux on Thinkpad 720? W/ 160MB disk?

I tried a slackware-compatible bootdisk from peipa.cs.uk (something
like that) that would automagically detect the disk paramters.
It came back with 64 heads, and then proceeded to croak that
the head count was > 16.

Running PCTOOLS on this disk gives the following geometry
    head=64, cylinders=161, sectors/cyl = 32

With 512 bytes/sector that gives me 168,820,7xx bytes. 

THis is an ESDI disk. If it was IDE with proper sector translation,
I could divide the heads by four and multiply the cylinders by
4 to get the same storage, but that doesn't work.

Any good ideas out there? Anybody done this?

Thanks,
Phil

This is not really a fair comparation is it ? The Dell is a top og the line
PC (are there any 100MHz on the market yet ?) whereas the SGI is the absolute
bottom of the current SGI line (do they sell any 100 MHz R4000 anymore ?)

What I would love is a 133 MHz R4600 with Linux, the problem is that even
though MIPS claims that their CPU's cost only half of the price of a Pentium, a
PC motherboard with a MIPS is still for more expensive that a Pentium board.

Still hope though !

that it is using the Linux kernel 1.1.18 but now I see the kernel is all the 
way up to 1.1.50 (anything newer?). Being a newbie to Linux, should I be

Subject: interesting slip problem
Date: 6 Oct 1994 17:18:24 GMT

Hi, I'm having a rather strange problem with slip.  I have two 
linux machines connected with slip, one at work <with internet
access> and one at home <without :)>.

At work, I'm using dip to handle inbound slip and at home I
use dslip to connect to work.

Instead of using the slip line to connect one machine at home
with the network at work, however, I have a route set up in the
router at work to link a network over the slip line, to connect
the three compuers I have at home to the world.

Now comes the problem...

Periodically <it seems very random> while connected through
one of the machines at home <not the one with the modem>
I suddenly cease to be able to get anywhere.  Upon connecting 
to the machine at work from another computer, I find a route
set up directly to the machine that stopped resonding has
magically appeared, and the device for the route is eth0... which
doesn't work too well, since the machine is on the other end
of the sl0 device.

Any ideas why this silly computer would keep forming routes
like this?  It happens on either of the two machines I have at 
home that are not directly connected to the modem.  The
computer that serves the slip connection at home never has 
this problem.

Both networks use ne2000 compatible cards.

Thanks for any help, in advance.  email responses are preferred,
but I'll keep an eye out for posted responses too.

A 1 character packet uses about 100 bytes if that. sock_wfree is called

It's a pity that the size tracking is used to manage the TCP windows and
you now have a totally invalid broken TCP that will crash if someone sprays
you with tcp frames. 

What is interesting is everyone reporting the problem uses PPP. I've looked
through the PPP driver but I can't see anything wrong with it.

Is there any way round this?  I've had this happen on occasion, using an

Subject: diff between Slackware 2.0.1 vs 2.0.0?  & cannot open mouse dev
Date: Fri, 7 Oct 1994 13:28:51 GMT

Hi everybody,

Anybody can point me out were to look for a list of differences between 
Slackware dist 2.0.0 and 2.0.1?

It seems I messed it up by using boot/kernel and root/install of 2.0.1 
and disk sets from 2.0.0 distribution.
could that be the reason why I can't get my mouse to be recognized?

(Microsoft busmouse connected through the ATI ULTRA grapphic card)

both selection and test-mouse give the error message: 
Cannot open device

Trying 
 # ls -l /dev/mouse 
I get:

... /dev/mouse -> inportbm

instead of 
... /dev/mouse -> /dev/inportbm

Is this a "bug" of the Slackware 2.0.1 distrib?

Then I tried to hard link the mouse device with:

 # ln -f /dev/inportbm /dev/mouse


( I assume that should be a _hard_ link after checking with, for example, 
"# ls -i /dev/cdrom " because those as well as /dev/modem are hard links to 
the proper devices 

It did not work either. I got the cannot open device again and again. 
Tried starting again and again repartiotioning and reformattning the partition 
but nothing.... well I learned a lot reading all the staff (the HOWTOS' and

Subject: Microsoft busmouse on the ATI ULTRA , cannot be opened?

Hi, I tried tried tried and keep trying.

I cannot install the mouse under Linux (Slackware 2.0.1 distribution)

Hardware:
It is Leaguer busnouse, recognized by all the soft under both Linux and 
(ehhem, sorry DOS) to be a microsoft (protocol) and busmouse (interface). It 
aso has the 9 pins rounded connector with the notch as described in the 
busmouse HOWTO. so for me there was no doubt its a busmouse.

It is connected trough the graphic card ATI ULTRA (w/mach8 processor for 
the accelerated mode).

I tried mknod ... /dev/inportbm
and when running "selection" or "test-mouse" 
with "-t bm" or "-t ms"  
and "-m /dev/mouse" or "-m /dev/mouse" options, 
get:

ms_init: Cannot open device


the same when booting.

why? why? why?
many thanks!
