Huh?  I agree that a AMD 486DX2-80 would operate @ 40 MHz externally and
80 MHz internally.  What I am trying to explain is that I can take an
AMD 486DX2-66, run it on a 40 MHz motherboard, causing it to run at 80 MHz
internally, thus making it into a 486DX2-80.  Save money *and* get better
performance than you would with an Intel 486DX2-66!  Now that AMD is 
actually selling chips labeled 486DX2-80, this might mean that AMD
is testing thier current batch of 486DX2-66's and relabeling the ones that
are stable at 80 MHz.

True, TeX supportts all the major languages, plus other stuff. I don't know any
system that supports as many languages. Speaking about making LaTeX to
speak A language, I'm claiming that people are just lazy. My own experience
with Russian and Sanskrit shows that people just have no idea how to do
the localization. But it is possible and involves not only TeX or MF but
also an environment you are working within because the lacalization where
you transliterate letters of AN alphabet with Latin characters is not a localization.

Don't tell me about vi -- I hate it. XEmacs! Go for it. Speaking about sed
and awk, all of these features sit inside Emacs. The real trouble, however,
that slows people from going to a normal text processing systems is
an absence of WYSIWYG, which, I believe, for TeX is unacceptable because
it'll slow down your work by 100s of times.

 You forgot

 3) font queens.

 I've yet to find a good monospaced italic X font, and find that
the bulk of the freeware fonts don't compare to the vga fonts I've
written or found.

  (And I've got a nice Mach32 card on one of the machines that I
use as a desktop machine, too. Windows are kind of nice, but I'm
not willing to exchange good fonts for multiple windows.)

Yes, I was going to pick up on this.  The reason Motif and
MS-Windows are similar is not that Motif copied MS-Windows,
but that they both try and adhere to the user interface
standard CUA (common user access), originally proposed and
designed (mostly) by IBM.

If you want to send me a check for $4, I'll gladly accept it.  I don't turn
down free money.  I've already told you that when you made a similar offer in
E-mail to me.  However, receiving $4 from you is not going to stop me from
continuing to warn people about SWT on the net.  Even receiving the money from
SWT, at this point, wouldn't stop me from warning people about SWT on the net.
I'm not publicizing the problems I had with SWT in order to extort them into
paying me money, even if I do think it's money that they owe me.  I'm
publicizing the problems I had with SWT in order to prevent other people from
having the same experience I did.

Incidentally, if SWT does decide to pay me some or all of the money I believe
they still owe me, I will certainly make note of that in the review of them
that I post periodically, and it will certainly reflect favorably upon them. 
Whether or not they think it's worth it is their problem.  I doubt they do,
considering that (a) they never responded when I sent them a copy of my review
and asked if they wanted to send me a "rebuttal" to put in it, (b) they never
responded to any of my E-mail asking for them to pay me the $4 their bounced
check cost me, and (c) they never responded to the complaint I filed with the
Dallas BBB.

Incidentally, I think it unwise for me to post my U.S. Mail address in a
world-wide newsgroup.  If you still want to send me $4, send me E-mail and I'll
send you my address.

Then you have not bothered to read my postings very carefully.  As I have
mentioned at least once in this thread, someone else contacted me and told me
they had almost exactly the same experience with SWT as I did, including the
bounced check.  Who knows how many others there are besides me and the person
who contacted me.

I don't have it any more, but there is an App. Note from Dialogic describing
their ADPCM format.  Probably available on their BBS, and definitely
available on Compuslurp (go dialogic).

I, too would be interested in Linux drivers for D40 cards...I've been mulling
over giving Dialogic a call and seeing if they'd throw me some HW in exchange
for writing Linux drivers (once I get Linux running, of course :-).  They DO
charge beaucoups bucks for their *IX drivers, though, so I'm not sure how 
receptive they'd be...

In any case, if anyone has written Dialogic drivers for Linux, please let me
know.
                          Thanks,

Intel called their trippled 30/90 a DX4/100.  They CLAIm that this was 
because the court ruled that their old dx2 designation was descriptive, 
it was not a trade mark so this time they chose something 
non-descriptive.  Myself, i just think its typical Intel slimy marketing, 
hey who CARES if its accurate, it SOUNDS better!

IMO

I don't think this is a primary goal - as such - of many people who
would like to see Linux working better as a workbench. To be frank,
one of the reasons many people stay with DOS is that the applications
are varied, in many cases excellent, and easy and quick to use - you
can get your work done efficiently using them. This is not yet the
case with more than a few applications on Linux. The work-horse areas
are text-processing, spreadsheets, databases, graphics and (for some)
maths/stats/computation.

        I think this is an older version, and in addition, it crashes a 
hell of lot.  I'd appreciate a newer version.

Does anyone know if any of the Unix versions of Netscape will run on 
linux?  I've tried the Win version and was _very_ impressed.
