Subject: Wanted: XFree86 compatible ISA card (and recommendations)
Date: 7 Sep 1994 03:22:59 GMT

I'm interested in cheap XFree86 SVGA cards.  I'd like recommendations and
if you have one to buy, perhaps used, I'll consider buying it.

Situation:  At school there is an old 386 computer on which I have Linux
running.  I got X to run in 16-color VGA mode (ho ho ho... sort of like
a dog walking on its hind legs, it does it poorly, but you are amazed it
does it at all).  But the "SVGA" card that came with it is just too stupid
to deal with XFree86.

At the moment the best I can do is have it display its X-windows on
a Sparc in the same room, which is cool in and of itself, but not
real useful.

So I'd like to yank that card and put in a better one.  It needn't be
wonderful, it needn't be new, it just needs to work and be usable for
low intensity X-use.  I just want to be able to show people how great
this stuff is---my home system is has the ATI GUPro, displayed on a
17'' screen, but I can't (don't want to) haul that into school.

I also don't want to spend too much, since the sole purpose is to
demo this for other people.

Recommendations appreciated.

I couldn't disagree with that statement more. Installing applications and 
getting them to work on my Slackware distribution has taught me more 
about the inner workings of Unices in general than anything else ever 
could, and I've been in the computer business since 1981. 

When I wanted to learn the inner workings of Un*x I installed Slackware 
at home, because during the day I was too busy getting things done to 
pick apart SunOs. 

So at night I customized and upgraded Emacs, Got PPP working with my 
office network, fixed some bugs in the version of xlock originally 
supplied with the distribution, got X configured and set up to my liking, 
and then I started playing with the kernel source. 

Each and every one of the above experiences has been put to use in that 
most important of daily tasks called "making a living". The experience I 
have gained with my Linux system has put me steps ahead of the rest of 
the folks working with me, because when something goes wrong, it's 
usually me who finds the answer, simply because my experience with Linux 
has given me a basic idea of where to look.

So, to all of you out there, I say hack away. You never know when some 
tidbit you learn by playing with Linux in your spare time is going to add 
a little more to that next bonus check!!

Effectively buffers ARE the general memory pool!

Any 'unused' memory in Linux is allocated to the buffer cache.  When a program
requires extra memory (eg you startup Emacs) then the cache is shrunk by
enough to allocate the required memory.

This has been discussed ad nauseum these past few weeks....

Hello,

I am considering purchasing a 486DX2/66 with at least SCSI-2
and possibly PCI. This firm seems to put together a nice system at
a good price. They also make sure it runs Linux.

Is this too good to be true? Has anyone out there done business
with this firm? How did it go? Are you pleased with your system 
and the company?

Thanks in advance

The Boca 2by4 (4S/2P) does support modems and works well.  Only bad
this is that each port requires it's own IRQ.

Certainly.  And RMS and MIB have also said that commercial/binary-only
stuff will be allowed on the Hurd.

Note, however, that crt0.S could have used the "as a special exception"
copyright used by the stuff in libgcc.a: the file itself is under the
GPL, but as a special exception, applications built with gcc and linked
to it don't fall under the GPL.  This is how the FSF and Cygnus folk
have been addressing the issue of key files that always have to be
linked in.

Question for the Linux/68K folks... Was porting Linux to the earlier

a couple adds for "DN3500 w/ 32M ram / 170M HD, 19" color monitor, etc.
etc. etc. $400 obo", and wanting to reclaim my '486 from mail/news

The multicasting is in almost all drivers (although not always to best of
ability) but there is no user side interface to use it to its full
currently. Its the dev->set_multicast_list() function.

BPF can be found in tcpdump as a usermode library. BPF is a performance
issue however as it requires promisc mode. It's built on the SOCK_PACKET
interface that allows you to receive specific protocols or all packets
depending on your desire. The libpacket.c in DOSEMU is a library for using
it and DOSEMU's virtual packet driver for Novell is a fine example of how
it works.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.
