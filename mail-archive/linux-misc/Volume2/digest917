Yes, it's good to have the option to go either way-- X is nice and
versatile, but when it's necessary to run stuff remotely over a
s_l_o_w modem connection the additional delays imposed by X often
outweigh its advantages.  Also, sometimes it's handy to be able to log
in on any old character terminal or dial-up line to do some document
editing or whatever.  The termcap and ncurses libraries provide enough
functionality to cover probably 75% of my word-processing needs
(anything that doesn't need explicit embedded-graphics, multi-font,
proportional spacing support; underlining, bold, page formatting, etc.
can all be done in character mode).  The extra overhead of supporting
character mode in addition to X (or whatever) isn't that much for a
lot of software.

maybe it can't be changed with the panasonic drives.

To put the record straight:

The mitsumi driver _does not_ use the interupt. It does however have
the ability to generate one, and is connected to an interupt line on
your PC bus. As you can't share interupts in a PC/AT compatible you must
define the IRQ line mainly so that no other device can, and in the off
chance that an error causes your drive to generate an IRQ it is safely
ignored. 

Not using the IRQ makes the driver much more cpu intensive, and also probably
slower, mitusmi is not exactly free with the programing info to allow a driver
that uses the IRQ, but I know of atleast one person with the documentation and
expect the mitsumi driver will one day support the irq, better be ready and
have your irq correct now :-)

Most of the journals in the kind of linguistics I used to do before I

I know this question has probably been asked a thousand times,
so feel free to flame me for asking the thousand and first.
Here goes:  How do I set up my Xconfig to support a "320x200"
resolution.  It's a standard enough video mode that I suspect
the same line added to the Xconfig would work anywhere.  So 
flame away guys,  but I will consider you unqualified to

Has anybody got showaudio to run for Mosaic? I am having trouble 
compiling it. Is there Linux specific source and if so where? I also 
realized I didn't know how the include directories for gcc can be expanded,
without doing it from the command line, where is that setup and defined?
One other question, is there a way to cut and paste text between sessions

'vim' handles such files just fine.
so can emacs - here's the code I use (grabbed from gnu.emacs.sources ages ago)

;;;
;;; This package does two things:
;;;
;;; If a file being read into a buffer has the ^M character at the end of each
;;; line then these extra characters are discarded from the file's buffer.
;;; The trailing ^Z, if present, is discarded too.  The buffer is now put into

;;;
;;; Secondly, when a buffer in dos-mode is being written out, the ^M and
;;; optional ^Z characters are replaced before the write happens.
;;;
;;; dos-mode can be toggled for a buffer with M-x dos-mode.
 
;;; Installation:
;;;
;;; Byte-compile dos-mode.el to dos-mode.elc and put them both in a directory
;;; on your load-path.  Load the package from your .emacs file with:
;;;
;;;   (require 'dos-mode)

It is not possible with lilo as it stands,  but it is possible with a combination
of another boot-manager.

I have a little master-boot-loader called winiboot, (which BTW, might have been
the one with SLS 0.99.x).

It prompts you with the 4 main partitions, and lets you press a number of the one
to boot from, with a timeout and default partition.

I have lilo installed in /dev/hda4 rather than /dev/hda (because winiboot is 
installed in /dev/hda), so if I chose partition 4, the lilo boots.   If I choose
partition 1, DOS boots.  Now, I have a DOS program, and a unix script that change
the partition that winiboot uses as default - so, if I boot dos, it sets the default
partition to 1, and if I boot linux, it sets the default to 4.

Simple eh?
