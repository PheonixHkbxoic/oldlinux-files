Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

Subject: 525MB streamer that wouldn't backup 300MB: SOLVED!
Date: Tue, 6 Sep 1994 09:29:58 GMT

Hi all!

First of all, thanks to all of you who replied to my initial post! I received
many suggestions, backup scripts etc. I tried many of the solutions you suggested,
but none seemed to solve my problem. Fiddling around with cpio's parameters
I tried different block-sizes, IO-sizes (-C param)... whether my streamer was
in streaming mode (almost) all the time or started-stopped pretty often didn't
make any difference.

I got NovaStor under MSDOG, and it didn't do any better either. Its main virtue
has been to tell precisely how much data I got on a single tape: about 160MB...
That sort of gave the game away: the tapes I had were labelled "DC6525", but were
in fact DC6150's... I got myself another tape, a 3M DC6525 and lo and behold: 523MB
on a single tape...

Once again, thanks to all of you who helped. The lesson seems to be that not every
DC6525 is in fact a DC6525 ;-)

Regards,

Eelco.

        Hi All!
 
        I'm trying to use a 3200 bpi tape for reading a backup from 
a Nixdorf mainframe , and I've got a TL5212 Overland Data tape, controlled
by a Peltec controller board. I've got DOS drivers, but I have nothing for
UNIX. Does anybody know where to find drivers for SCO or LINUX?
 
                Thanks in advance!!

Hello !

Is there an easy way for upgrading to gcc version 2.6.x. I thought about something like 
a pkg-tool package (-> Slackware).
Or can I at least find the object libraries, binaries and include files prepared 
for Linux somewhere (I do not necessarily want to compile and patch everything myself
if someone already did so.)

Thanks for your help

pbmplus does use shared libraries. libgr.so.1.3 is based on this package. On my
linux system pbmplus10 is composed of about 128 utilities and uses a total disk
space of 850kb.

Subject: Required: Prolog
Date: 6 Sep 1994 06:29:40 -0500

Hi,

I am having great difficulty getting a version of Prolog to build on my 
linux machine.  I've tried five of six different versions, all to no avail.
The build problems were sticky ones which I couldn't simply resolve either.
I even had one which offered a `linux specific' configuration but that was for
a v0.99 kernel and wouldn't build either.

To summarise: I am running Linux 1.08 and if you have a version of Prolog
              which will run on my system, contact me by e-mail and I will
              tell you how best to send it to me.

Thanks a lot in advance, this is really driving me crazy.

Kieran.

Please wait. Once when gcc 2.6.x is stable enough, there will be an x86
binary release. You just need to untar 2 files if you don't want to compile
it yourself. That's all.

It's a software emulated mips system with an operating system used in

I recently purchase a new hard drive and went to re-install Linux from the Ygg 
Sum94 CD-ROM and about halfway thru I start getting I/O and time out errors 
from the CD.  I have installed this several times before and wonder if the CD 
has gone bad. There are a couple of small scratches on the CD but I have some 
very old audio CD's that are in far worse condition and work fine.

Is there any way to recover from this or should I just write it off and buy a 
new one?  I heard rumors that Yggdrasil has a Fall94 release out but have not 
been able to find out any info on it.

mail you when the T-Shirts are printed, and then get the details, before
I send them. 

"Linux! Not UNIX!" T-Shirts are either, Black on White, Navy Blue on White, 
or White on Black, Long or Short Sleeved T-Shirts. "Linux! Not UNIX!" is
written on the back of the shirt, and on the front left corner a neat litle
"Linux." is printed.

"Linux Inside" T-Shirts have the "Linux Inside" Logo, by Rick Lyons, printed
on either Long or Short sleeved. White T-Shirts. I will only print a limited
amount of these T-Shirts, so please get your order in now.

"Linux.. The Choice of a GNU Generation" T-Shirts have the slogan printed in

I do not advise sending cash in the mail. Unless you _have_ to, then
please don't, and I will not take any responsibility if the money is
stolen by Australia Post, or the local Post man. :)

PPP implements CRC-16 at the present time. This is error __detection__
and is not error __correction__. This enables PPP to discard frames
which have been corrupted in the transmission. Error __correction__,
if you wish to give it a wide definition, is done by the TCP end-to-end
acknowledge and re-transmission logic.

If you use an error correcting modem, the benefit of PPP's CRC is
depreciated. The modem itself will do the retransmission sequence of
data. There is a IETF draft to allow the CRC to be negotiated up to a
CRC-32 and discarded in the case of a 'V.*bis' modem.

The time that is spent in doing the FCC calculations is insignificant
when compared to the speed of the modem.

Both protocols communicate at the same speed over the same equipment
and telephone line quality. The overhead of a PPP frame is typically
four bytes (including two for the CRC). The overhead of a SLIP frame is
two bytes.

This is seriously misleading, for a number of reasons.  For starters, almost
anyone who wants to use SLIP or PPP will be using a higher-speed modem, and
connecting in some flavor of error-correcting protocol.  Secondly, PPP's
error correction is basically just checksumming, which shouldn't have any
noticeable effect on throughput at normal serial rates, unless you're running
a 16-Mhz 386, and probably not then either.
