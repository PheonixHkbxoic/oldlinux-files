Yeah, probably not.  Consider, after all, Windows:  Chicago promises to

still has 90% market share.  Sheep follow the shepherd...

         So whether or not package A can be distrbuted only under the
         terms attached to package B depends on the existence or
         non-existence of package C, where A, B, and C do not share any
         lines of codes and are not otherwise derived from one another?
      
         This is rational?

   Sure, because the copyright for B says that if you use it, you're
   making a derivation, and copyright law says that you can control the
   use of derivations.

Sorry, the definition of "dervitive work" is defined in the copyright law,
not in the GPL.  So is the definition of "fair use".

I hate to disagree, but there is ALWASY a need in machine-intensive 
applications for a small amount of assembler.  Until the compilers get as 
smart as humans (which includes doing ungly things like using the top n 
bits of a register for one purpose and the bottom n bits of it for 
another assemblers will be necessary for some applications (such as 
games).

This is true, although not as nasty as it sounds.  Its quite usable for 
small routines (I just wrote a few at work.)

Or perhapse more to the point, the GNU tool intended for thisi purpose-- 
the gasp assembler macro preprocessor.

One last comment.  Gcc supports in-line assembly ina fairly nice way.  
You might want to look at that first to see if it meets your needs...

Okay, I'm fairly inept when it comes to Xfree86 or any Xwindows system

At boot time, the kernel should print 

        "lp_init: lp1 exists, using polling driver"

If not, recompile your kernel with parallel printer support enabled.

No.  The licensing being discussed is a single-user license.  You would have to
talk to Waterloo about a multi-user situation.  

The previous follow-up pointed out that the price for linux is the same as for
Windows.  No, there is not (yet??) a student version -- not for any un*x as 
far as I know -- this is the first time the question would be reasonable, but
if they are pricing mapleV/linux at the same price structure as mapleV/Windows,
it seems like they are going a long ways to satisfy the needs of this community.

Yeah, it's more than a student version on any machine.  But it is, in my
opinion, the best general-purpose CAS program available.  (More religious wars 
on that coming, I'm sure).  

Please don't suggest that, simply because they don't run some high-powered 
license manager, that we should consider violating the license agreement and run 
it in multi-user environments with a single-user license.  More than this one
program is on the line with that; since if vendors believe that their software
will be pirated wholesale under linux, they won't release it, and linux will 
never become accepted in a broader community.  You don't want to have to 
deal with a license manager on your PC.

I would like to add two other points:

        - It might be a good idea not to use the newest versions of
          kernel and applications, but only those that are known for
          stability.

        - As I see the situation, the most important handicap for a dos/
          windows user to start using linux will be the lack of information.
          Surely you can get manpages, faqs, HOWTOs and even tutorials
          for nearly all problems on the net, but a newbie needs a careful
          introduction starting at his (assumable low) level of knoledge
          teaching him all he needs to make good use of the system he's
          using now.

Both is, as I think, important to keep frustration from the desired users.

Good luck with it.

Andy

Subject: Pentium problems/performance
Date: Thu, 29 Sep 1994 13:48:39 GMT


Since there is a lot of discussion about pentium problems/
performance with linux, I will summarize here my experience
with hope that it is going to be helpful for those of you
who plan getting a new machine.  

1. Hardware:
        -Pentium 90MHz CPU, 512 Cache, P54VL-PCI matherboard,
         16 MeG Ram,ATI 32mach 1Meg(Dram) (PCI),
         Conner 420MeG hard drive, (VL controller),(bought from
         Zenon), Viewsonic 15E monitor;  

2. Software:
        -Slackwere 2.0 Linux, 1.1.47 kernel,2.5.8 gcc (I tried
         compiling the version of gcc for pentium, the 
         performance was worse about 10-15%  (?));

3. Problems:
        -Linux didn't want to boot at the high speed (turbo on).
         It got stuck every time.  Change of settings in BIOS
         didn't help (thank you very much to whose who tried
         to help). Since also some dos software (win) didn't
         work at high speed, tech. support was willing to help.
         After about 16 hours of phone conversation, the 
         problem was localized to Flash chip (addition to 
         AMI BIOS).  Now I got a new one (new version) and it
         works fine.  Performance was about 50% down (at least
         dhrystone test) when run at low speed (turbo off). 

4. Performance:
        -I have only dhrystone test here, the results are for
         dhry11, dhry21 (kernel compiled with network support).  
         1-4: dhry11
         5-8: dhry11 under XWin

If so, could you let me know what model and what firmware revision?  I have 
a DOS  program that will scan the SCSI devices and tell you what the 
firmware revision is if you need it.  I can email it or whatever -- just let 
me know.  Thx.

I have WordPerfect 5.0 for X/Ultrix at work.  It is ghastly.  Quite 
probably the worst written piece of software I have ever seen.

And free software and it's life is threatened by lawsuits, software patents
and interface copyrights. (That includes programs like X-Windows or the free
spreadsheet you are using right now!)
