Has the Kerberos system been ported to Linux?  If so, where could I get

Ugh, I forgot what nachos stood for. Not Another Completely?
Heuristic? Operating System? Doesn't make sense, but that's what first

Hi!

From what I recall, the numbers you listed are the speeds of the
serial port itself.  The seed of the modem is set using the
initialization string that you send to it and don't have to be the
same.  Use the 19200 baud speed for your serial port.  That way the
serial port sends to the modem at 19200 baud, the modem then
compresses and sends the data over the phone lines at 14400.

Agree.  I have a STB Powergraph X-24 ISA.  It's a very nice card.
Very fast for this price ($125 at Treasure Chest).  

BTW, I do have some funny problems on the clock-synthesizer.  It takes
about 5 second to set the clock, no matter when I start the X, or when
I switch the mode.  It works fine, just takes some time.  Someone
suggests that it might be my monitor problem, 'cause I have a cheap
no-name monitor (Korean made SVGA NI).  Is it the problem you're
talking about on the synthesizer of recent boards?

Thanks.

Date: 5 Sep 1994 23:02:34 +0200

I just got myself an external SCSI Toshiba CD-ROM drive - 3401TA (at least
that's what gets reported at boot time).

The good news:

It works fine with my Adaptec 1542C (at least under Linux, under Dos I had some
troubles setting it up. If you have done so successfully, let me know. I'd
also be interested in getting PhotoCDs to work under DOS; the drive didn't 
come with any drivers for DOS).

The bad news:

Fine in the previous sentence means: `audio' and `data' work fine.

I can't mount PhotoCDs. Is PhotoCD (which I believe is CD-ROM XA) supported by
linux/isofs ? Do I need special software in order to use PhotoCDs ?

Can anyone shed a light on this peculiar problem?

It's not a silly question at all.  It is, however, misplaced.  Note the

>Can I just remove the 8250 from an (very) old Serial Card and replace
>it with a 16550

Yes, you can, assuming your serial board has a real 8250, and not just a
multi-function chip that emulates an 8250.  If this board is as old as you
say, there's a good chance of that.

The 8250, 16450, and 16550 UART families are all pin-compatible, so you
can replace one with another at will.  Of course, you'd be crazy to
replace a 16550A (or better) UART with an 8250 or 16450, and you'd lose
the extended FIFO and interrupt handling...but you could.  :-)

You may run into trouble if your UART isn't in a socket (i.e., if it's
soldered in).  If this is the case, your best bet is to take a small pair
of wire-cutters and cut the old UART off the board.  Then, using a
low-power soldering iron (absolutely no more than 25W, preferably
something between 15W and 20W), remove what's left of the pins from the
chip.  Be *VERY* careful not to overheat the copper traces on the board,
or they'll detach themselves, and you'll have yet another headache on
your hands.  After you're done with that, insert a 40-pin DIP socket,
carefully solder it in place, and when it's cooled down for a bit, insert
the new UART.

Once you've replaced the UART, you're good to go (assuming you didn't burn
anything up by overheating it with your soldering iron).

>to improve serial throughput?

Whether or not it will improve your throughput depends on a lot more than
what's installed right now, and what, if any, problems you're having.  I'll
be glad to answer more questions on that, but not tonight...we spent all day
today out on the boat, and my brain still seems to think it's out on the
open water (i.e., there seem to be waves rocking this apartment, and the
nearest water from where I live on the island is across the street).  Of
course, this happens every week, but.....  :-)

In fact, it depends on the quality of you telephone line.

1) Your line is a good one, so they are not numerous errors, SLIP is faster
because it doesn't contain any errors correction protocols as PPP does.

2) Your line is poor and you are using SLIP, so the packet correction is made 
via TCP/IP standards procedure, which is much slower than serial line dedicated PPP 
error correction procedures

Subject: Re: WARNING about shadow-mk package
Date: 6 Sep 1994 02:10:30 -0500


=====BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE=====

This post is in regards to the login.secure program included in
the shadow-mk package authored by Mohan Kokal.  I, Joseph R.M. Zbiciak,
am the sole author of this program, and would like to dispell any
rumors labeling it as the tool of a "cracker." 

Included in this post is the source code for my /bin/login replacement.

The binary included in the shadow-mk package distributed by Mohan Kokal
was apparently compiled under GCC 2.4.5, using libc 4.4.4.  I base this
statement on the fact that the binary was indeed compiled by me on my
personal Linux box, "asylum," prior to June 9th.  On June 9th, I upgraded
to GCC 2.5.8, and libc 4.5.26.


Inspection of the login.secure binary will reveal that it was indeed
linked with libc 4.4.4.  

Therefore, I seek corroboration of the following, since I cannot
do this myself (my system has no room to dl libc 4.4.4 and gcc 2.4.5 to
try this):

The login.secure binary was most probably compiled as follows:

gcc -o login.secure -s -N -O6 -fomit-frame-pointer -m386 login1.c

(as I said, under GCC 2.4.5, and libc 4.4.4)


Using GCC 2.5.8 and libc 4.5.26 yeilds an executable of 1328 bytes
with these options.  

Let me remind you that the /bin/login on my system has been and continues 
to be the login.secure binary that was included in shadow-mk.  (Size:
1124 bytes.  CRC: a4abbb26)


I have PGP-signed this post to ensure its authenticity.  My public key
is available via finger.  Please finger im14u2c@cegt201.bradley.edu.
Pipe the output to a file and run pgp -ka on the file to add the key
to your keyring.  This key is primarily for private messages.  I do not
yet have a well established key for business use.  One will be forthcoming.

Please:  I urge *ANYONE* that has any questions, problems, etc. relating
this program to CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY.  My email address is, once again,
im14u2c@cegt201.bradley.edu.  Should that address fail, there's also
im14u2c@camelot.bradley.edu.  Should both of those addresses fail for one
reason or another, email Mohan Kokal at magnus@cegt201.bradley.edu, with
instructions to forward the mail to me.

And again:  I do apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused
anyone.  The shadow-mk package is not insecure.  The login.secure is
indeed what it was titled.  I do hope that this post lays to rest any
suspicion about the shadow-mk package, its contents, and its author.
I also apologize to Mohan Kokal for not realizing that such a small piece
of code would cause such a large number of people to label him as a
cheap-and-dirty cracker.
