Hi.  I have upgraded tkppp to 1.2; the file on sunsite.unc.edu is

        /pub/Linux/Incoming/tkppp-1.2.tgz

and should be moved elsewhere (/pub/Linux/X11/xapps/comm ??) soon.

Thanks to jmmadiso@iupui.edu for some excellent improvements
including a cool color icon!

Please send any bugfixes and enhancements to jeschke@cs.indiana.edu

Revision 1.1  1994/09/03  21:36:59  jeschke
Initial revision

-[README]-----------------------------------------------------------

What is tkppp?
==============
tkppp is a short wish (tcl/tk) script I wrote to control a PPP
connection on my Linux box.  It presents a small window with
buttons for starting and quitting PPP, a small status message area 
and a quick-glance icon for determining the status of the PPP
link.

What is required?
=================
  -  the PPP package, including working ppp-on and ppp-off scripts.
  -  tcl/tk
     [ I'm not sure what versions of tcl and tk I used to make this,
       but there is nothing fancy here, so just try it out. ]

Installation
============
  -  unzip and untar the package.
  -  edit tkppp and change the paths at the top of the file
     to suit your system.
  -  try it out.  You may need to run tkppp as root IFF your
     own ppp-on and ppp-off scripts require that.
  -  If you like it, you may want to move the files someplace
     more permanent.  I suggest /usr/include/X11/bitmaps for
     the bitmaps and /usr/local/bin or some such for the tkppp script.
     Be sure to edit tkppp if you move the bitmaps around.

What it does
============
tkppp calls the ppp-on and ppp-off scripts that should be provided
with your PPP distribution.  You will need to get these working or
write your own scripts to initiate and take down the PPP connection.

Once tkppp is running, it wakes up every so often to check whether
the pppd daemon is still running and updates the status display
accordingly.

Distribution
============
I place this package in the public domain.

*** I am maintaining tkppp, so please pass along your comments,
bug fixes, patches, enhancements, etc. to jeschke@cs.indiana.edu
so that I can merge them into future releases of tkppp. ***

Enjoy!

We have been moving the production date back a couple of days each month.
By the end of the year everyone should receive their issue before the
start of the month matching the cover date plus it will be on the
newsstands before the cover month.

For example, the October issue is currently at the printer (issue #6) and
will be back on the 9th of September.  That means it should be in the mail
by the 14th.

For our US subscribers, we hope to have the subscription base up high
enough so that we can start sending via Second Class early next year.
That should decrease the delivery time.

For you people in Canada, tell your friends about us.  Because of the low
number of subscribers in Canada we have to pay very high postage rates.

If you wonder where the subscribers are, hang in there.  There are some
charts in issue #6 that show what our subscription base looks like.

[If you have any questions or comments about Linux Journal, call or
send e-mail to linux@ssc.com.  Also let us know if it is ok to publish

I have just installed Rob Hooft's 1mar1994 binary NETPBM package, and
trying to print a received fax with efax's "fax print" command
resulted in the following error message:

        "g3topbm: error allocating memory for a row"

Has anyone encountered this before, is there a fix, or has anyone a

Does anyone know of another way of converting g3 format files to

That's a matter of personal opinion.  Take for example the recient fiasco 
with Steve Winters and the post about 'War on Satans BBS's', which was a 
long tirade about how pagan bbs's need to be terrorized and shut down.  
It was signed Steve Winters (and Steve is a well known 'hardcore' 
christian) and it was quite the rant and very believeable that Steve 
could have written it.  It was also a PGP signed message.  This ADDED to 
the believability of it.  However it was later discovered that Steve 
never had a PGP key, and never wrote the message.  If (before this 
incident) Steve had made a public key, some people could have checked the 
validity of this *highly* volitile message.  Mr. Winters now is (or is in 
the process of) making a public PGP key so this kind of thing can't 
happen again with his name.

Do all of you (meaning the posters in this thread) have really slow
machines or something?

386sx-20, 4M RAM, 6M swap. Kernels take a bit over 2 hours, pushing
2.5 for the latest ones. The .99.14 kernel took more like 1.5. X
putters, but it's fast enough for non-demanding stuff like xbombs.
(I also have a really slow video card.)

I believe that installed according to the documentation, drealm is secure. 
However, the menus are configurable, and it would be possible for the sysop of
the BBS to use a menu function called 'system' or one called 'shell' to
perform external commands or even allow a user to shell out.

Since the BBS runs *as* the user running it (all drealm users have bona fide
unix accounts), any system command will be executed with the user's
permissions, plus the extra group (effective gid) bestowed while the bbs is
running - again a special bbs group, used for nothing else on the system.

There are a handful of setuid executables, which will be needed if you wish
dial-in users to create their own accounts, in the style of a Dos bbs, and for
a sysop to destroy an account.   On a linux machhine you also need a setuid
copy of chgrp and chown, as the BBS is supposed to ensure the right ownership
on files created during its execution.   The documentation advises how to
create a special BBS directory structure to ensure that these can only be
reached within the context of BBS execution.

We have asked various experienced unix users to try and hack the system from a
shell and so far they have been unable to do so.  

I would advise however, that the SysOp is a person who is trusted on the
system as a whole, as a combination of configurable menus and setuid
executables would leave an opening for an untrustworthy bbs operator to cause
some disruption.

Try overwriting your boot sector with zeroes (use some disk editor)
and booting up from a DOS diskette with SYS.COM on it and doing a SYS C:.

Make sure the diskette has exactly the same version of DOS as the
partition had you are trying to recover.

We had 5-8 users on a 4Mb 386DX40 quite happily all using tin (reading news
via nntp), elm , a small bbs written here, telnet/rlogin and some small mud
clients. In other words basically a user to internet front end. It worked
but was a lot happier with 8Mb. With the light disk usage (barring swapping)
it got the IDE drives were also adequate.

For a general purpose 5 user system I'd probably now be looking for a VLB
486SX and 8Mb of RAM for light usage. For heavy usage - lots of compiles,
mosaic, X stuff going on you'll want a lot more ram and possibly a real
disk controller.

Xhfs will do 1.44Mb mac disks. It's on sunsite. I've not found many formats
I can't read under Linux - even obscure stuff like OS/9 seems to be

Correct as I understand it unless there is some requirement for the code
to be derived from the AT&T code...

It would cost a lot and include royalties according to the X/open blurb I
saw.

There is a simple solution to all of this. Write an Mgetty-HOWTO or a
DIALOUT-HOWTO or something. I'd actually agree with both of you. getty_ps is
the best getty unless you want dialout when mgetty is much better.

And I suspect every single one was insecure. If it used a sys5.2 or sys5.3
bourne shell it was insecure (end of story). sys5.4 bourne shell I never
tested out in full. If the system has symbolic links its probably insecure
anyway.

Valid point. I guess if someone feels like fixing the kernel so that it
doesn't have the implicit script re-open race and is thus safe at that level
it would be quite nice.

It can definitelyt read all incoming packets on all the cards I use
(barring etherexpress) otherwise tcpdump wouldnt work. Outgoing packet
viewing is very recent but now works.
