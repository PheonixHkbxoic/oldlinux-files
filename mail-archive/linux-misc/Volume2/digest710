Subject: Popmail server, how to setup in Linux?

   The internect access provider that I am interested in joining has
the popmail server for e-mails.  Can anyone tell me how to
setup my Linux box for this option?

  Any opinions will be greatly appreciated.

I'd be perfectly happy to drop in another ethernet card to run (only)
native appletalk if that would be an easier approach.  It would be
a lot cheaper than any of the other alternatives.

        Yes it can, and yes it will, if YOU tell it to in your

        To quote from /usr/src/lilo/README:
LILO automatically makes backup copies when it overwrites boot sectors. They
are named /etc/lilo/boot.<nnnn>, with <nnnn> corresponding to the device
number, e.g. 0300 is /dev/hda, 0800 is /dev/sda, etc. Those backups can be
used to restore the old MBR if no easier method is available. The commands are
dd if=/etc/lilo/boot.0300 of=/dev/hda bs=446 count=1  or
dd if=/etc/lilo/boot.0800 of=/dev/sda bs=446 count=1
respectively.

: I basically need some (major) help reconstructing the DOS boot record.

        Unless you have seriously screwed up the images LILO saved for
        you, you are going around Mars to get to your elbow with this
        approach.

        You're welcome.  You may wish to read up on some of the documentation
        provided with Linux on the LILO boot loader for future reference.

Reply-To: cmattern@mindspring.com

I've got a bit of a stumper here.  I installed afio this afternoon and
ran a backup with no problems.  After doing some major reconfiguration I
attempted another backup (several times).  On my first try I got a good
deal of I/O error messages.  On a subsequent try I got this type of 
output:

bin/ftp.z -- (45%)
bin/gunzip -- okay
afio: "/dev/rmt0": Permission denied
afio: "/dev/rmt0": Permission denied
afio: "/dev/rmt0": Permission denied
afio: "/dev/rmt0": Permission denied
bin/gzip.z -- (46%)
afio: "/dev/rmt0": Permission denied

The program is bing run as root so I can only assume that the file
is still locked by a previous session.  No other users are on the system
as the error occurs.  I suspect that a reboot would solve the problem
but I would prefer a cleaner solution.

Hardware:

486/DX2 66 processor
20 megs ram
Adaptec 1542b SCSI card
Archive 2150s tape drive
Fujitsu 500 meg SCSI disk
Micropolis 1.5 gig disk

Software:

Linux 1.1.48
afio 1.3

Any help would be appreciated.

It'd be good to see a sample copy first - though I'm prepared to accept

Warning I'm a Farallon employee.
That said, there are a few other advantages that an Etherwave card has 
over regular 10bT cards plus hublet configuration.  Potentially the most 
important advantage is that unlike a hub of any kind(including hublets), 
Etherwave cards do not increase a packets hop count. We've seen a number 
of sites where a hublet is just not an option because a given Ethernet 
packet is already going through too many repeaters(e.g. hubs, routers, or 
bridges).  The addition of a hublet in such situations would make it 
impossible for packets to reach certain destinations.  Since Etherwave 
cards aren't repeaters, they do not have that limitation.


You are correct in stating that our Etherwave ISA card is based on the 
3C509 chipset and is therefore identical to a 3C509 from the computers 
point of view.   However, we do have a number of of products in the 
Etherwave line including:
Etherwave PCMCIA-based on 3Coms PCMCIA Ethernet card
Etherwave AUI-Adds Etherwave capability to any Ethernet card with an AUI..
Etherwave AAUI-Same as above for AAUI devices.
as well as a number of different Etherwave products for Macintoshes.

   That, and also (preferably) in $XUSERFILESEARCHPATH/Mosaic. Same
   stuff, but putting it in its own file keeps .Xdefaults (or whatever)
   short. By helping programs avoid reading stuff in resource files that
   they would just ignore anyway, improves startup time of all X
   clients. (I think more thorough explanation can be found in the X or
   Speeding up X FAQs)

X applications don't read .Xdefaults every time they start up.
When X is started, xrdb is used to load .Xdefaults into the X
server's resource database.  You might note that editing
.Xdefaults won't affect application behavior until you restart
the server.

I've used SLIP, CSLIP, and PPP on my system.  For a long time I
could only use SLIP; when I tried CSLIP it would not work at all,
and neither would PPP.  Then I recompiled my kernel from stock
sources (the Slackware 2.0 kernel source) and suddenly both CSLIP
and PPP worked; I hypothesized that a particular kernel patch
(the inline assembler string functions patch for 1.0 kernels) had
somehow broken the IP header compression.

What I found after a little playing with both CSLIP and PPP on my
system is that PPP gets almost the maximum theoretical
performance possible on my 14.4Kbps modem -- I'd see 1.6-1.7 K/s
for large compressed binary FTP transfers, for example.  CSLIP
under the same circumstances was doing only about 0.95 K/s.  So
now I use PPP all the time, since I have a connection to a system
with dialup PPP access.

Yes, there is no difference in how TCP/IP applications work with
either SLIP or PPP; they are link-layer protocols that are used
to send the IP datagrams that your applications deal with.

If you have perl, then there's a little program called "pop-perl"
available for anonymous FTP at sunsite.unc.edu,
pub/Linux/systems/Mail/pop-perl-1.0.tar.gz.  It's a little perl
script that handles connecting to a remote POP server and
fetching your mail periodically to your local mailbox on your
home system.  There's also a POP client written in C in the same
directory, called popclient-2.21.tar.gz.  I use pop-perl and it
works great; it might also be a little easier to customize than
the C client (I hacked mine for a different polling interval and
to not add its own "From" line).

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
