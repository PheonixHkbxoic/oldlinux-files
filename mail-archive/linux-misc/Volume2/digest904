Download the sources for the newest version (lynx2-3-1).  It has 
the linux-ncurses entry that I submitted.  They sort of screwed up
the entry though.  Edit the Makefile and find the entry for
linux-ncurses.  You need to add -DFANCY_CURSES to the defines, this is
the option which allows the nice looking (highlighted, not reversed)
links.  I have also changed my setup to use optimization (makes a large
difference in the speed! ;-) ).  Then compile with:

make linux-ncurses

        I would like to second this.  Splitting rarely accomplishes anything
because so many people cross-post, and it does nothing about the fundamental
problem which is that there are simply too many posts for most of the active
developers to follow.  By creating regional groups, the local experts can
assist their own local users, and the load is low enough that it is not
overwhelming.

Those are all ISO 8859-1 languages.  You can get those without even
trying.  I'm talking about things like Japanese, Arabic, Greek, and
so on.  While multilingual in one sense, apps that do the languages
you're talking about are basically just using a single (Latin) script.

Guys, the race is on to capture growing markets in China, India, and
perhaps Russia and Islamic countries, and Unix is way behind the Mac
(WorldScript) and NT (Unicode); probably behind NeXTStep, too, though
I don't know what they've been doing lately....

TeX has never cared about ASCII.  All it cares about are charcodes,
its own internal representation of what characters "mean", and these
can easily be changed.  For example, I once wrote a small TeX file to
map the accented characters on a VT220 to the appropriate accent +
character sequence.  That way, I could enter accented characters using
a two-key compose sequence, and they appeared in the editor and in the
final printed form as a single accented character.  The only
limitation is that TeX can only handle 8-bit characters.

This capability has always been with TeX, and in fact it was one of
its original reasons for being.  When it was developed, Stanford
University had terminals with odd extended keyboards that included
keys for many common mathematical symbols.  TeX was designed so that
these terminals could be used to their full potential.  Now, I agree
that this feature of TeX is not well exploited, but that is another
issue.  Right now I am working on an IPA console font for Linux and a
LaTeX style file to go with it.  Once I get it done I will be able to
type up my Dagaare word lists without having to type a single
backslash.

(P.S. Sorry if this is hard to follow.  I'm only on my first cup of
coffee.)

If you want to run gcc 2.6.0, join the gcc channel, install the
snapshot releases as they are available and test it.  I'm sure your
bug reports (should you find any bugs) will be appreciated.

Suggesting that everyone else should run it too, on the other hand, is
stupid.  Not smart at all.

It is on an ftp site.  Join the GCC channel and find out where.

Subject: Yggdrasil Fall '94 Linux CD-ROM
Reply-To: ambarish@Cadence.COM
Date: Tue, 4 Oct 1994 01:06:48 GMT

Hi Netland,
        Just bought the Yggdrasil Linux CD-ROM. Am having major problems installing
stuff. Has anyone else had a similar experience or any advice?

I have a Pentium PC with a Soundblaster 16 bit card and a Mitsumi CD-ROM. For some
reason, when I tried to boot from the Yggdrasil floppy, it would refuse to recognize
my CD-ROM. (My CD-ROM is a port address of 0x230 and an interrupt(IRQ) of 11).

The only way I could get to the CD-ROM was to first boot to DOS (after commenting out
my HIMEM and EMM drivers and some soundblaster stuff).
Once I had the basic DOS up, I had to do runlinux from the CD-ROM.

Once I got things running this way (after many painful hours), I tried installing as
much of Linux as possible on my hard drive. The installation scripts for the
components of Linux seems broken - I kept getting errors of File not found etc.
Finally, I wrote a shell script to do a lot of the installation by hand.

The Linux still doesn't recognize my CD-ROM unless I boot through DOS. My machine
still hangs if I try to run Linux directly from the disk (without having the CD-ROM
available) - I seem to still not have some of the files needed at bootup.

Are my problems due to Linux, Yggdrasil or my stupidity/hardware?

Please help/comment,
Ambarish

P.S. Is anyone at Yggdrasil listening?

        You need the Motif package (not included with Linux, but available
for about $150) in order to compile Mosaic.  If you don't have Motif and
don't want to buy it, you can get a version of Mosaic that is compiled with
static libraries from sunsite or tsx-11... it works just fine under Linux
and does NOT require you to have Motif.

Prove it.  What output did you get when you ran NIST PCTS and/or VSX?

I think any claims of standards conformance without going through a
validation suite and acceptance process is specious no matther which
group the claims come from.

Same thing goes for iBCS2 or other ABI conformance, for that matter.

It won't appeal to the Windows user, but it will appear to the Unix guru
the user asks to help fix a problem. It's not Unix w/o vi.

Don't forget less used. Python may be good, but it's not ubiquitous. If you
leave out sed and awk you're breaking a lot of shell scripts. How many
makefiles use sed or awk in them? None of those will work if you remove them.

Reply-To: Ted.Harding@nessie.mcc.ac.uk

For what it may be worth, can I report the following. Running DIP/SLIP
from Linux machine A (at home) I can telnet easily to non-Linux machine B
(local Univ mail server) and while logged in to machine B can telnet 
easily to Linux machine C (in my office). While thus logged in to C,
I can monitor (ps -ax) what is happening on C.

Now I try to telnet direct from A to C. At A I get the message
"connected to C.C.C.C", and it hangs.

On the other channel, I do "ps -ax" at C, and get the following:

 2009  ?  S     0:00 -A.A.A.A: connected

where in the above "A.A.A.A" etc are the FQDNs of the machines.
And there it hangs. Is this a clue? (I should add, that the same hang
occurs if the "telnet C" from A is the only activity.) Both A and C
are running Slackware Linux 2.0 (A = 1.0.8, C = 1.0.9).
