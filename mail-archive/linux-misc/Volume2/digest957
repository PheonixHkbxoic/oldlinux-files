I just put the line in my .xinitrc and typed xinit.
But the window for the xconsole displays "Couldn't open console."
Could any one tell me why, and how to fix the problem?

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted biweekly to
comp.os.linux.announce.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not a contribution to the development
of Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration
- should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.

  concept though; Linux ("University Igres") version lacks the friendly(er)
  front-end of the commercial version. 
* 'postgres': Could be good for users who want sophisticated database
  concepts. Won't work for me (wrong kernel - and I ain't up-dating
  till I hear that something later is SOLID). Same front-end problem
  as INGRES.
* Flagship: Very good, but compiler ONLY of application already composed
  in dBASE-type language. Needs a dBASE-compatible prototyping workbench
  (see dBMAN below).
* Metalbase: interesting, but scruffy and primitive front-end. Also, for
  me, severe "ncurses" problems - writes at random all over the screen;
  not impressive yet (am trying to solve this with new ncurses).
* dBMAN: Commercial dBASE-III+ with extensions, recently ported to Linux.
  This could be what people are looking for (I have copy on order, will
  report whether it's as good as it's hyped).

|

| 
* Agreed graphics is better served in Linux than most other applications.
  Main problem is smooth interface with other (spreadsheet, dbase,
  computation) applications. Need svgalib graphics for when you don't
  (or can't ... ) use X (GLE is nice but quirky, not yet mature, I think

  on 'gnuplot' for graphics and for some aspects of the computation
  (like contouring) that it ought to do itself. However, it's almost the
  only "free" option worth looking at. Not to everyone's taste by any means.
* Maple: Commercial and good; ported to Linux.

No, not one which satisfy both those criteria. Each commercial vendor provides
his/her own automounter which is not compatable with other systems. Linux
however does support the AMD automounter which can be compiled and run
on a wide variety of machines. But AMD cannot talk the correct language to Sun

You want to run how many terminals off of one machine??!?!!?!
(I think you'll need more than one machine.)

You can get terminals that run X, Xstations, and such. Sorry, don't have
the prices. You might want to consider just getting a bunch of fast 386es,
they're rather cheap, and the processing power will be more than you'll
ever get trying to run all of your terminals off aof one (or even a few)
Pentiums.

i don't want an operating system that falls over once or twice a day,
software that costs about $50 - $100 per year to upgrade every package,
to fix the bugs in the current package, and that i have to buy extra 
bits (mail, etc) to make it work.

what i want an operating environment that is:
        a. robust
        b. cheap
        c. complete
        d. rich in applications.

linux scores well in the first two, and windoze + apps + bits & pieces
scores well in the last two.

however, if linux remains the province of the skilled and enthusiastic 
hobbyist, then it will _DIE_ and _DISSAPPEAR_, and we will all end up 
paying a yearly license fee to Mr Gates, just like what IBM, DEC 
et al did to their customers.

this is not an outcome that i want to see.

>Do we really care about "market share" like Bill Gates?

hence, _YES_ !

>Do we want Linux to be a mass-market product?

again, _YES_ !

the alternative is too awful to contemplate.

Reply-To: root@psie81


Having an AMD486DX2-66, I made some tests. By overclocking it at 40
(=80) MHz and slowing the bus accesses accordingly, I was able to
run DOS and (more important) Linux for more than a day.
The heatsink was quite cool.

Why only for one day? Because when I tried to run Windows my applications
crashed (general protection faults). And until someone will port serious 
music apps under Linux I need WinDog (sigh!), so I played for a while with 
BIOS hardware settings, and eventually I switched back to 66MHz.

I wonder why this happens: maybe because Windows uses a broader
instruction set than gcc? Undocumented instructions? Continuous
real/protected mode switches? Bad programming practices?
Do you think that getting a better motherboard and/or faster memory
will help?

My AMD CPU is quite new, so it's probably no more able to run at
80 MHz.

I hate to sound like a recording- but using svgalib is *******NOT********
a good choice.  It is not a standard on multiple platforms.  This means
the software would be Linux specific and not portable to all the other
Unixes (SCO, Solaris, HP/UX, etc).  When we work hard on free software,
I think it should be available to as many different people and platforms
as possible.

In addition, X is the "official" graphics environment for Unix.  Writing
things which do not run in X will greatly annoy those who want integration
and flexibility.  X apps can run on any Unix platform, via modem, hardwire,
ethernet, Xterminals, remote workstations, consoles, distributed,
centralized, multihost, etc....   This flexibility and power is not
available in a platform & OS & hardware proprietary graphics environment.

Then why did you say "..the lines of early WordPerfect..."?  I was just trying
to prevent people from thinking that WordPerfect did not support text modes
anymore.  Trust me, if they did that, I would drop the product at work
like a hot potato!

Please do install- I was doing the same thing.  I put off upgrading the
kernel for 6 months before a took the plunge.  The insmod stuff is cool and
really works!  Too bad all drivers/kernel extensions aren't using insmod.

Well, buy software for ***US*** then!!

Actually, it does not surprise me.

I had no idea.

Indeed, I agree.  But this is what a floating license allows.  You can
connect your two Linux machines via ethernet and have one running a
license daemon.  This way you can run the program on either.

I know, it does suck.  It sucks big time.  It majorly sucks.
