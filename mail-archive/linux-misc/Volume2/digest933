|> It seems that SWT is not the only business with which you have disagreements.

You're trying to use the fact that in the seven+ years I've had an account
with BayBank, they have on occasion made errors which caused checks to be
bounced from my account, as proof that my complaints against SWT have no
merit?  Oh, *please*.

I've played the game by your rules until now, Bob, but no more.  You accused
me of returning the machine to SWT because I changed my mind about wanting it,
and I explained in excruciating detail why I have not yet had time to do the
research necessary to buy a new machine.  You ignored my explanations.  Now,
you're once again making completely unfounded accusations (i.e., that any
problems I've had with BayBank were my fault).  You have no more proof this
time than you had the last time.

You say it's so.  I say it's not.  I don't see the point in trying to prove
that, because you'll ignore anything I say.

Hey, Bob, I'll tell you a secret.  I occasionally have disagreements with my
bank about the way they run my account.  I occasionally have disagreements
with the MBTA about the way they run the bus routes around here.  I
occasionally have disagreements with my landlord about the way he runs my
apartment building.  Heck, I occasionally have disagreements with my barber
about the way she cuts my hair!  Well, gee, I must be a horrible person whose
opinion doesn't count for anything; after all, honest, trustworthy people
never have disagreements with anybody, right?

No, I think you missed the point.  More likely, you ignored it and chose to
put an obnoxious slant on it and hoped people wouldn't notice.

I don't have overdraft protection.  Despite that fact, BayBank has paid checks
on my account when they thought I didn't have the money in my checking account
to cover them, and charged me the same fee they would have if they'd bounced
the check.  They're legally entitled to do that; in fact, most banks do it
when they think that the client is good for the money.

Therefore, one might conclude from the fact that SWT's bank bounced their
check that the bank was *not* sure that SWT was good for the money.

Incidentally, Bob, you still haven't told us why you feel qualified to make
unfounded accusations against me but you aren't willing to answer a simple
question: Is a company that bounces a refund check on more than one occasion
behaving in a professional, responsible manner?

You also still haven't answered this question: Bob, are you speaking from the
point of view of a satisfied customer of SWT or something more?  Are you and
Wu acquaintenaces, perhaps, or even friends?  You did tell me in E-mail that
you are `on reasonably good terms with Marvin Wu.' What exactly does that mean?

You seem to be awfully good at ignoring points to which you have to answer,
Bob.  I've answered every one of the points and accusations you've made, no
matter how absurd they are.  Put up or shut up.

I didn't say that I would stop posting my review if SWT paid me the $4 or that
I wouldn't have started posting it if they had done so.  I won't stop posting
the review if they pay me the $4, and I would have started posting it even if
they had done so immediately when the check bounced.

|> If you think

I do not believe that I have a strong enough legal claim against SWT for it to
be worth the effort to take them to court.  I would have to base my case on
convincing a judge that the machine SWT sold me was never in working order,
something which I find it highly unlikely I would be able to prove to a
computer-ignorant jurist (after all, you're a smart guy and you're
computer-literate, and *you* seem to have a lot of trouble understanding it!).

Regardless of whether or not I have a legal claim, or a legal claim that is
strong enough to bring to court, there are thinks that are more important than
legalities.  I believe that SWT should refund my shipping because I believe
that it is the "right thing to do."  Even more so, I believe that refunding a
check-bouncing charge which is there fault is the right thing to do.

|> The simple fact
|> is that Marvin never agreed to pay for any of your banking fees

Oh, I see.  So before signing the purchase agreement with SWT, I should have
made them put into it, "If we give you a refund check and it bounces, we'll
pay the charge your bank charges you for the bounce."  Yeah, right.

Here's a clue: When an honest, responsible person or organization bounces a
check and it's his own fault, he pays the payee whatever was lost because of
the bounce.  That's how honest, responsible people operate.

Most stores enforce this honesty by charging a returned-check fee.  You've
seen the signs in stores that accept checks, right, Bob?

A company which bounces a $5000 refund check and then refuses to reimburse the
payee for his losses because of that bounce, and refuses to even acknowledge
those losses, is not behaving in an honest, responsible, professional manner.

|> You needn't reply but I'm sure you can't resist having the last word.

Priceless, Bob.  Why don't you try sticking to the issues and answering the
very simple questions that I've asked, instead of attacking me over and over
again with innuendo like this?

Sure, your Superblock Information is lost. You should make a e2fsck on

superblock, which lets you only the possibility to make it manually,
telling it to take the 2 Superblock on the disk.

If this works well, boot your Linux system with a boot-disk telling

Subject: proper usage of mmap()
Date: 13 Oct 1994 18:10:05 -0400

Hello,  I'm working on porting a C program that utilizes mmap().
Unfortunately the kernel 1.1.18 uses something like do_mmap().  Is
there information available on the proper use of mmap() to map
memory to files using the kernels' do_map()?  Right now, all I
get back from mmap() is EINVAL, errno=22.   I can't seem to find
how the mmap() C funtion gets mapped to the do_mmap() in the kernel.

The man page was slightly helpful for mmap().  It said that not
all the functions were available, all I need in MAP_FILE....
The program makes the file available for use as a product queue.

Thanks for any information in advance, send replys directly to 
cermak@gandalf.rutgers.edu.

Subject: Mosaic Netscape for Linux?
Date: 13 Oct 1994 14:31:38 GMT

Does anyone know if Mosaic Communication Corp.'s Netscape Web Browser is
going to available for Linux anytime soon? I checked out the HP-UX version
this morning and it looked pretty nice. And FAST! It says that it does multiple
connections for faster loading of pages and has native support for jpeg
images. It even has a native newsreader that works pretty good, and has 
threading almost as good as trn (IMO). Kind of stingy on the colormap tho.

I's also supposed to be optimized for use over phone lines with 14.4 devices.

They have binary versions for Windows (16-32 bit, WFW + NT) Mac sys7 and
X versions for HP, SunOS, RS-6000 and a few other systems but no Linux or
source code (for obvious reasons when you read the license).

If you don't have a clue as to what I'm talking about, go to this page:

You're right.  But the `new' driver uses the irq.

I accept your apology.  I suppose that your arrogant and condescending
remarks are consistent with your apparent contempt for your readers.
It seems that you believe your frequent and windy postings are important
beyond any requirement to check whether or not you got any of the facts
right.  If you can't remember what you said in your own articles, I suggest
that you concentrate on posting fewer, more memorable, articles.  At least
you could take the trouble to run your article through a spelling checker
before posting.  Bob Tisdale

There is nothing magic about the Syquest.  We use an 88MB Syquest to get
files to and from the system that drives our imagesetter.  (Yes, the
imagesetter we use to typeset Linux Journal is hooked to a Linux system.
When it was being installed we managed to bend the ear of the installers a
whole bunch about Linux and all the installation problems had nothing to
do with Linux.  The imagesetter will talk over a parallel or serial port.
We send data over the parallel port but monitor the serial port for status
information.  The installers were impressed that I could do both at once
on Linux as people couldn't do this on MS-DOS systems. :-) )

Anyway, back to your question.  Treat the drive like any other SCSI
device. If it is your second drive it would be known as /dev/sdb and the
partitions would be /dev/sdb1, /dev/sdb2, etc.

You can make filesystems on it using fdisk to partition and mke2fs (or
whichever filesystem you use). Mount as usual (e.g., mount -t ext2
/dev/sdb1 /hotstuff).

An alternative is to use it as a tar device (which we commonly do with
stuff for the imagesetter).  In that case you refer to the whole device
(/dev/sdb, for example).  To read in the whole sucker, 
    tar xvf /dev/sdb

Consider this an anti-***HORROR**** story. I have had near-zero
problems. One server crash the first time I tried the admittedly
in-development LBX. And don't accidentally try to start two servers
on the same screen, or you will lose permission to start up any more
clients.

I tried mosaic, which is statically linked with motif libraries last
night; no problem. I run olvwm all the time with no changes and no
problems, and nearly 10 512mprovement in xbench score. I also used fvwm
in 300x200 "doom mode".

I suggest go ahead and try it, but don't throw out 2.1 yet. Maybe it
is more difficult for Slackware users.

Clearly, a matter of semantics.  However, I *did* read the manual, and
had in fact read that quote.  However, "recommend" and "require" are
distinctly different words, with different meanings attached to each.

All the documention states is that those machines with 4MB *must*
specify additional virtual memory.
