CorelDRAW runs on Sun, SCO, AIX, etc... Has anybody had any luck running
it on Linux? It's my main DOS application, so if there's a reasonable
chance of success, I'd like to use it at home on my Linux box.

I am about to buy a PCMCIA ethernet card (I need 10BT although one
that would work with other wires would be great.) Are any of the cards
with Linux drivers superior, or should I just go with the best price?
I am not very knowledgeable about networking in general, or ethernet,

If i didn't say so already, I think its aa good idea, too.  A particular
example is this 'I can't get Yygdrasil F94 to boot on my sony cd' problem.
I've been tellign the same story over and over, 'cause it disappears in
the flood of mail.  If there was a place were people could ask yygdrasil
questions, and read their posts, it might alleviate some of this.

I just went through the whole process of setting up my linux station
with a PCMCIA ethernet card, so I guess I can share some of my
experience.  For PCMCIA service, you'll need at least version 1.1.49
of the kernel (found in ftp.funet.fi) as well as two files from 
stanford.edu (can't recall the exact name of the FTP site).  You'll need
the file module.tgz (?) and pcm-2.2.2.tar.tgz (?), module.tgz gives
you an updated version of 'insmod' and pcm-2.2.2.tar.tgz is the actual
PCMCIA service driver (the author did a great job).  I have the
3Com589 Combo card and it has been running perfectly once I set it up
right.  BTW, don't buy Xirom cards since they are supported by the
driver.....

Hi folks..
I'm a long time advocate of OS/2 and I am curious about Linux..

1)will it run on a386DX40 8M ?
2)how much HD is required ?
3)does it require it's own partition or can it live alongside DOS and OS/2 in 
the same partition ?
4)can it be booted from DOS or does it require it's own boot manager ?
5)what are the files required to get me up and running ?
6)where can I get these ?
7)no flames please about not having read the FAQs, I don't know which farqing 
faqs to read !!

Thanks to anyone who can help, I look forward to trying Linux !!

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

WordPerfect for Unix does not require networking.

Exactly

The SCO version of WordPerfect for Unix runs just fine under Linux.  They
are ****NOT**** going to make a native version for Linux.  We should work
to get WordPerfect/Novell to SUPPORT running the SCO version under Linux
(Which they currently do not).

The suggested retail price of all versions of WordPerfect are the same.
The Unix version can be had for under $299.  Upgrades or crossgrades are
even less expensive than that.  Government/educational prices are lower
also (check DIT/GSA/etc).

Why does it have to be native??  Keep in mind that it is utterly futile to
expect a native version of WP for Linux.... I T   W I L L   N O T   H A P P E N

I AM ABSOLUTELY LIVID.  FURIOUS DOESN'T EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE IT.

Firstly, because Ted Ts'o has joined in with the ignorant flamers.  He
himself has stooped to spreading the Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt that
he claims he finds so harmful.

There was nothing inaccurate about my posting, and nothing that needed
correcting.  The posting went through several drafts on a mailing list
with several hundred people, with _no_ objections.

Secondly, because the moderator of comp.os.linux.announce, Matt Welsh,
posted this so-called "correction" WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE TO ME.  I
find this particularly galling considering the fact that Matt is a
*member* of the mailing list I mention above.

Unfortunately I am going away on holiday for a week, so I will not be
able to battle this out.

However, I am EXTREMELY ANGRY that Theodore Ts'o has turned a message
that would have accurately and honestly reassured those who have been
confused by the FUD surrounding this topic into an opportunity for him
to score points of the FSF and RMS, and that Matt Welsh, whom I would
have expected to know better, allowed him to do so.

This has greatly damaged the cause of free software, and will no doubt
make the lives of all the developers and users of Linux much more
difficult as they wrestle with the problems caused by missing,
unclear, home-built or otherwise unhelpful copyright notices.

HI Folks !

I'm looking for infos on the ReadLINK ENET16/U Rev. C Ethernet-Card.
This card can be jumpered for WD80x3 and NEx000 mode and has a lot of
jumpers on board :

  J10   Eprom-Addr            A18-A13
  J9    I/O ADDR              A8-A5
  J11   NE1/NE2

        32K/8K
        WD/NE
  J5    SEL
  J4    <unknown>
  J12   0WD-DLY
  J8    PROM
  J15   EPROM CONFIG
                16K
                16/32K
                32/64K

  J14   EPROM SIZE
                E16K
                E32K
                E64K
  J6A   Upper IRQ's  (15,11,10)
  J6B   Lower IRQ's  (2,3,4,5,7)

Whatever setting i choose (WD oder NE), whatever IRQ/IO i choose, the card  
is recognized but

  - in NE-Mode the card hangs together with HD-Access  CRASH
  - in WD-Mode, all works fine, but the cards (2 of this kind) don't
    recognize one another on the NET

I got these cards very cheap but without infos.
Can anyone post me infos for this card ????

HELP !!

Easier said than done for some of us.... it would mean a motherboard AND
video card upgrade.  And it might mean trashing all your RAM too....  Not
cheap!  I have not done this yet because my machine is fairly respectable
(486 DX 33,16MB 0 wait, true SCSI, etc).  Oh well.  Technology marches
on.  Certainly, Doom for Linux is a good excuse for upgrading video :)
