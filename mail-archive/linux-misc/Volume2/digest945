If you want to run X applications in window, you can try out xwin. It is located:

        src.doc.ic.ac.uk
        /computing/systems/ibmpc/windows3/demo/xwindemo.zip

It is a fully functionaly demo and it works well!!

good luck!

        Well, I have about the same setup as what you want. On my 110 Mb
drive, I have 5 partitions :

Boot Manager    Main, bootable           1 Mb
DOS             Main                    13 Mb
OS/2            Extended                35 Mb
Linux           Extended                50 Mb
Linux Swap      Extended                10 Mb

        You'll want more disk space in your Linux partition if you run X,
say 80 Mb. I for one have a 50 Mb partition, 35 Mb of which are used by
Linux, man pages, info pages and development system. I don't use X (yet).
At the moment, the 10 Mb swap partition is oversized, even when I compile
programs that I wrote; but I would recommend keeping at least 10 Mb swap
to use X (especially since I have only 4 Mb RAM).
        The OS/2 swap file is on the other hard drive (210 Mb). It runs
much faster than if it were on the OS/2 partition on the first hard drive.

        Hope this helps.


                                                        Ludovic.

I have IBM 540 MB HDD and it has 1062 cylinders, I think, by the
manual. Since Yyigdrassil (sp?) didnt work with so many cyl., I set up
1024 of them in the BIOS.  In meantime, I installed Slackware version
1.0.9 from the sunsite and it works perfectly.  I have a 150 MB DOS
partition, 360 MB Linux and 16MB swap. Well, I guess I lost a meg or
so, but it is worth it :-)

        Wasn't there a package included with the Slackware distribution
that claimed to be an editor that saved it's files in TeX format? I don't
do any real text editing on my Linux box, and for the program editing I do
I just use VI (hey, at least at work I live in Emacs), so I never tried it.
I seem to remember it was on the same series as "idraw".

        That might be a good place to start working from.

Hi!

I grabbed the source diffs for mush 7.25 from sunsite and then got
a mush 7.25 source package from ogi.edu (??)

Needless to say, the diffs all don't work, and it wont compile.

Which source package was the diffs on sunsite meant to be applied to?

Now, my turn after some silent days....... 

Using /dev/ttyS? for dial-in and /dev/cua? for dial-out works great for me 
too.

What is /dev/cua? doing? What is it for?

I've read that implementing /dev/ttyS? for dial-out and /dev/cua? for 
dial-in was a solution to a (obviously) "problem" since the kernel 1.0.*.

Let's see.. Richard Stallman puts together GCC, it's very popular
(I'll attest to that...) And, it's free even... By the way, EMACS
is also, free in case you didn't know... 150 is just a contribution
you could make or not... And, everyone gets to use GCC and EMACS
and everyone's happy! Doesn't seem like such a hellish experience...

Oh, I better include this as well...

Linux automatically blanks the screen.  Your monitor evidently picks
up on this and goes into powersaving mode.

`setterm -blank 15' will set your monitor for a 15 minute period
instead of a 10 minute one.

You're being silly. now.  Please read the manual page for `setterm'.

However, it might be considered odd that your monitor goes into
powersaving mode for 16 bit and not 8 bit modes.

Please don't post a hysterical warning unless you're sure.  Better
yet, never post a hysterical warning -- it is is true, people can get
hysterical without too much help.

I like the way you keep referring me to the Paramount legal department,
and how you just accept whatever they say as gospel. You keep saying
there IS an incremental damage associated with EACH copy, but you don't
even know what it is. Just because Paramount doesn't want the script to
be further redistributed, doesn't mean that they're losing money off the
extra distribution, it could just mean they're embarassed. And, I have
no intention of calling Paramount's legal department, because I'm
not a lawyer, and I would have no clue as to how to proceed with them.
So, since, you're the legal expert here, why not call them up yourself
and post a summary here? Or, maybe you just take it on blind faith that
since the "Paramount Legal Department"  <ta da! Insert theme music!>
proclaims that further redistribution is Wrong, then it must be so.
Well, that's fine for your faith, but I don't share that faith, and
I have no intention of talking to a bunch of lawyers, and hearing the
lawyer-speak.. NO, I am NOT putting down lawyers, but it would be like
me with a group of surgeons, and I'm a programmer. I wouldn't get what
they're talking about. Again, being the apparent legal expert here,
why don't you call them up, and post a summary? I promise you, if you
tell me the incremental damage, I will never redistribute the script
ever again, and I will delete all copies, I may have.

And, you'll notice that none of my arguments had anything to do
with the legality or illegality of anything...

You believe so? It's incredible all the things you take on blind faith...
And, I'm not discussing whether or not it is illegal, so much as whether
it should be or not, and whether IF it should be,  how such a law would
be enforced... Someone just posted the entire script on r.a.s.misc

Anyway, I never photocopied the script...

You should know the facts before posting "stupid" flames. The "4" has
nothing to do with the clock-tripling but with the performace compared
to a normal 486.
And you should have said: AMD will "copy" another chip from Intel. :-)

Yes, since there are tolerances in the production of chips they can actually
test if the chip runs with 40MHz internally. If they want to sell it as a
Dx/2 80, they are going to check that it runs with at least 90Mhz or so, which
means if you overclock an DX2/66 it might run with 80 (it almost always will),
but it doesn't have to, and your range of tolerance is pretty small.
