Um, perhaps you weren't listening.  Someone may see the problems you listed
as fundamental problems; not all of us do.  Some of us see the "fundamental
problems as being elsewhere, and having been addressed by the additional
disclaimers.... ;)

Oh, BTW, these arguments might go on less interminably if everyone adopted a
less confrontational style. ;)

I've seen this idea mentioned before.  Just for the record, some of us 
running Linux actually have no intention of ever FTPing DOOM.
So I think it would give you a good count of people running Linux with 
time  on their hands to play games, perhapse, but not a complete count of 
Linux users.

Trying to predict the future is not a particularly smart thing. Who knows
who will be the next owner of WP and what its policy WRT porting to
Linux (or whatever free OS) might be? Even Novell could change its mind...

SpecInt is a measurement of the integer performance, SpecFp does the
same for the foating point dpt.

  The Spec Benchmark are run in an UNIX/Posix environment and include
various real-world applications. So they measure the memory and I/O
performance, too. But as the CPU vendors typically use lots of memory
for good results, the CPU and memory interface seem to determine the
result most.

  I think of the Spec suite as the closest measurment in terms of
applicability to the use under Linux compared to the masses of
DOS/Windows benchmarks with small 16Bit programms run in real mode
(DOS fits into a large 2nd level cache).

I have to disagree with YOU, sorry.  Thsi is a very dangerous, and untrue 
statement.  (By way of crednetials, my folks have been freelance authors 
all their lives and have been officers, both of them, at various times of 
the American Society of Journalists and Authors.  I practically grew-up 
with the concept of copyright, as that is what kept me fed!)

Under the last copyright law revision, (passed sometiem in the 80s, I 
believe) a work is Copyright to its author as soon as it is created.  
There are only 2 ways in which this copyright can be lost.  It can be 
signed away by the author, or, a special case, the work coudl have been 
done under a "work for hire" arrangement, in which case the author's 
employer owns that work.  (Thsi is why, fellow programmers, your boss 
owns what you do at work.)

What IS true is that without a copyright statement on your work, it is 
difficult to prove that the infringer knew the work was copyrighted.  If 
you cannot prove this fact, you cannot go for punative damages.  fro thsi 
reason it IS true that you should always put a copyright notice on your work.

A side note, of use to programmers is that the following is NOT a valid 
copyright notice.

        (C)1993 FooBarCorp.

This is because the law only recognizes two forms of the copyright mark, 
either the word 'Copyright' or a c in a cricle.  Two braces does NOt 
constitute a circle.  To be safe the form should always be as follows:
        
        Copyright 1993 FooBarCorp

Thats not really true, but has a kind of tangential reality to the poitn 
i brought up above.

>
>I don't claim to be an expert on the subject but I have reistered

For the record, registering a copyright is not necessary. Unlike a 
patent, a copyright exists whether the fact is registered with the 
government or not. By the same token, the government acceoting said 
registration says nothing abotu the validity of the copyright. All the 
government is providing in this case is an absolutely unimpeachable 
witness to the fact that thiw rok existed in your hands at the time it 
was registered, not that thsi isnt useful if a question of who copied 
who comes up later.

A totally different issue, but one you may be confusing with the 
acquisition of a copyright, is the question of infringement. A copyright 
is just that, the right to make copies of the work.  In this case, the 
question of whether someone has seen your work (with our without a 
copyright notice) is vital. If they copy your work, then its 
infringment.,  If, on the other hand, the develop the EXACT SAME THING 
without EVER seeing your work, they own a legitimate copyright on their 
version.  This is why clones of software are done in the 'clean-room' 
approach, where the people developing the release code never actually see 
the original. Instead, there is a second team that digs into the original 
and writes a specification.  Thsi is handed 'over the wall' to the celan 
team who code to the spec.  Their result is handed back over the wall to 
the dirty team, who test it, find all the difference from the original, 
and write a new spec to be handed over the wall again.

This is how those comapnies that foirst cloned the IBM BIOS and Apple 
Toolkit were able to do so without infringing the appropriate copyrights.

As a few 9G disk users will attest to, you're wrong.  

For your edification, I present a snippet out of the SCSI-II

same thing with the exception of the DPO bit, although it's arranged 
numerically rather than alphabetically, making things harder to find :

Note the 32 bit Logical Block Address field.  2^32 sectors * .5K each = 
2 terrabytes.  Assume that we have a sign problem somewhere in the 
Linux code, and we still have 1 terrabyte of disk space per drive.

Partition it however you like, Remy's ext-2 code will handle it.

All this demonstrates is that Sun/Auspex screwed up, and ought to

This is ridiculous. Of course this is piracy. By your reasoning I
could buy any Windows software to run under WABI (or Wine, or whatever),
copy it and return the original just because I've suddenly discovered I
don't have Windows on my machine -- just a piece of software that will
`assist' me in running the program after all. The claim of `lack of
suitability' is self-defeating.

Anyway, copyright is not dependent on being able to actually take
advantage of the copied work; if I gave you a copy of my WordPerfect
disk that you were going to ritually burn or use as a boat anchor I
would still be in violation of copyright laws. If I didn't own a
computer at all, but bought a copy of WordPerfect just to prop up my
coffee table, I'd still be eligible for updates, calls to the hotline or
whatever type of support is offered with the package.

Other than that, I take it that somewhere near the start of the
WordPerfect manual you will find a disclaimer to the effect that
Novell/WordPerfect won't in fact guarantee that the bit patterns on the
disk make up a valid program, let alone that that program will be
`suitable' for anything at all. Therefore I'd doubt that you'd get a
refund merely on the grounds of `lack of suitability', anyhow. I suppose
you will also find that returning the package for any reason will
require you to destroy all the backup copies that you have made, and so
on.

  am I a copyright lawyer. The above should not be construed as legal

      40 MB   Extended   HPFS  [ OS/2 Warp I ]
       1 MB   Boot Manager
Drive 1:
      45 MB  Primary     FAT 
      55 MB  Extended    FAT

I tried to install Slackware 2.0 a couple of months back
unsuccessfully on Drive 1 (on both the primary and extended.)

I'm willing to completely restructure both drives and figure
that since I'll be installing the new OS/2 beta soon, now would
be a good time.  Could someone please suggest an appropriate 
partition configuration that would result in the LEAST amount
of trouble for both OS/2 and Linux?  

Thanks!

Does anyone know the current status of Qlogic host adapter support by Linux?
The SCSI howto says it's under development, but the howto is several
months old.

Has anyone gotten a Qlogic SCSI adaptor to work with Linux?  Please respond
via email to gjb@cs.duke.edu

Thanks.

Subject: HYDRA - serial bidirectional transfer for Linux?
Date: 14 Sep 1994 13:11:58 GMT


Guten Tag!

   Did anybody consider porting HYDRA, a serial bidirectional file transfer
program to Linux?

   HYDRA is a file transfer protocol available for MS-DOS and Amiga machines
which allows sending and receiving files from/to serial connections at the
same time. On a 19200 connection it is said to manage >2200cps for sending
or receiving - resulting in >4400cps considering the bidirectional transfer.

   The good thing is that the source code of this program is available.
At least the documentation says so. Unfortunately, I did not find the source
code on the net.

   So: Is any port for Linux available? If not where can I get the source
code so that I can have a try on it myself?

   Any information will be appreciated. Thank you in advance!

Before people put anything in the public domain be aware that the public
domain doesn't mean people cannot sue you for writing crap code that
breaks their computer! Therefore its much better to place the program
under a license along the lines of 'Do as you please but I'm not liable
for the results'.

Rumour has it Xfree86 3.1 has 320x200x256 support for DOOM. As to mode
switching you just hit CTRL-ALT-+ and go back 1024x768 when the boss is
around.

Please, do this for ANYTHING you register.  Too often I see
registration forms that have stuff like "1) DOS, 2) Windows, 3) Mac"
and no "4) other" column.

For instance, when I registered for TADS, there was no way to
indicate that you were not using any of the listed systems.
I scribbled stuff on the form, but I suspect that most of the
people that registered for unix or amiga versions did not do
this.  Yet I seem to recall a statement like "the number of
non-msdos users is too small to justify...".

That sounds like a termcap entry problem... I don't have it, and I'm using
a different distribution.  The console vt100 emulation -- an attribute of
the _kernel_ -- supports IL and DL directly, even correctly interacting
with the scrolling region.  Check other termcaps, and if you're equipped,
take a look at the console.c in your kernel source tree to see what it
expects.  This is an area that deserves better documentation.  The
authoritative source for the emulation ought not to be the termcap file.

Cheers,
