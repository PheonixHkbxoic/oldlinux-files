Here is a quick little script which I wrote yesterday while making a
DOOM package for our local Slackware install server.  It does the
following tricky stuff:

a) installs in .../bin while all the real DOOM! files go in
   .../lib/doom.
b) restores the functionality of the DOOMWADDIR variable while still
   permitting system-wide *.wad files (e.g. doom1.wad) to be stored in
   .../lib/doom.
c) defines a new variable DOOMSAVEDIR, where the DOOM! save files go
   (the default is the current directory).

Note that .wad files referenced on the command line which are not in
DOOMWADDIR (or current directory) or .../lib/doom will have to be
references with an absolute path, since the way all this is done is by
building a small symlink farm in /tmp and cd'ing there.

#!/bin/bash
#
# The Linux version of DOOM! doesn't seem to like it if the .wad files
# aren't in the current directory when playing.  Solve this problem in
# an extremely klugy fashion.
#
# This script makes DOOMWADDIR work as advertised, and also implements
# an environment variable DOOMSAVEDIR, where your DOOM! saved games appear.

When I boot linux, it says that there are 384 kb in reserved memory.  Looking
at mm/memory.c, it seems clear that this memory is from 0xA0000 to 0x100000,
presumably reserved since video memory and BIOS's are in that range.  However,
it seems that the actual physical memory in this region is lost.

I assume that there is no general way to remap this physical memory so that
it can be used, but is there a way to turn on selected say 64k chunks of
this memory that don't conflict with video memory etc?  

At present, if I go into memory.c and unreserve a bit of this reserved
region, (say 0xF0000 to 0x100000).  The kernel crashes on boot up with
a general protection error.

I am using an OPTI 495SX motherboard with 8 MB of memory.  The manual says
that the motherboard has some ROM->RAM shadow features, but doesn't say
how to program it.

The Doom Port works GREAT!

I recommend:  16 bit Sound card (I use an old PAS-16)
              A recent kernel (you need new sound drivers...)
              Don't use pixel doubling
              Find a 320x240 mode for X (see my posts elsewhere...)

THANKS ID, I plan on buying a registered version....

BTW, I can have two instances of DOOM running at ONCE!
I think I get sound from both mixed together... but I'm not sure...

Wouldn't it be cool if you could play 1 on 1 on a single X server?

The only problem is that the pixel doubling mode (at least in 256 colors)
looks really horrible.  However, I'm _extremely_ impressed by the speed of
the thing.  Just two real complaints.

1)  I wish 8 bit sound sounded decent.  He makes a comment that if you

Almost completely unplayable on a 386/40/8.  Runs 'way too slow, and _that_ 
is at 320x200.  Video card is an OTI-087, using an experimental accel 
driver that speeds everything else up ...

Found a couple possible bugs already, too:

a) When one stupidly cranks up the mouse sensitivity, the action window 
becomes half-size until the .doomrc is wiped.

b) Pixel-doubling/tripling results in weird endianness problems in the 
display.  This could be my driver, though.

Well, it _is_ quite playable on my system.  I've got a 486/33 with 8MB
RAM and an Orchid Fahrenheit 1280+ (S3 801, 1MB, ISA), using Linux 1.1.49,
XFree86 2.0 in 1024x768x256.  It hesitates occasionally, but it is generally
pretty smooth.  It is also, of course, quite small at 1024x768.  And I
only have an old 8-bit Soundblaster, so no sound :-(.

Sound driver >= 2.90 beta will do. it is reported 1.0.9 kernel is OK.
Mine is Kernel 1.1.37 + snd driver 2.90 beta on 486DX-33/8MB+trident 
8900C/1MB (really the slowest non-accelerated card you can get). It
is playable at 320x200. I use -grabmouse to enable mouse on my OpenLook
because Alt key doesn't work as expected (close the desktop:-( ).
Sound is good (I have a Sound Galaxy NX 16) but no music (like SGIxDoom).

the environment DOOMWADDIR does not work as said in README.linux. the
DOOM*.wad and sndserver HAVE TO BE in the current directory. I wrote
a script to create symbolic links before playing them and erase them
after playing.

I have a feeling that if there'd been an easy way to fix the problem, it
wouldn't have been there (it even said that pixel-doubling didn't work
right in the README.linux file).  Personally, I think the option should
have been removed if it couldn't be implemented correctly, but perhaps
that's just my opinion.  Besides, I'd rather see the DOOMWADDIR problem
fixed before anything else.

 My opinions may have changed, but the fact that I am correct has not.

I am playing LinuxXDoom under OPENLOOK. I am looking for a way to switch
focus to different application with keyboard because I use -grabmouse
to use mouse to play doom. But I can't use keyboard at the same time
because the doom window is NOT focused at the time.

I patched mine form 1.2 to 1.666. It works fine for me. I have not tried
the shareware doom1.wad nor commercial doom ][ doom2.wad.

Hah! I'm running it on a Trident 8900! Actually I've always been quite
surprised with how *good* the Trident's performance in Xfree86. It's
