Indies are great machines when doing graphics...I think somebody
has posted a Very LOW end indy vhint to this thread...the
following the the Indy R4000 we have here at Indiana University
for public use:

1 100 MHZ IP22 Processor 
FPU: MIPS R4010 Floating Point Chip Revision: 0.0
CPU: MIPS R4000 Processor Chip Revision: 3.0 
On-board serial ports: 2
On-board bi-directional parallel port 
Data cache size: 8 Kbytes
Instruction cache size: 8 Kbytes Secondary 
unified instruction/data cache size: 1 Mbyte 
Main memory size: 64 Mbytes 
Iris Audio Processor: version A2
revision 4.1.0 
Integral Ethernet: ec0, version 1 CDROM: unit 4 on SCSI
controller 0 Disk drive: unit 1 on SCSI controller 0 Integral SCSI
controller 0: Version WD33C93B, revision D 
Graphics board: Indy 24-bit 
Vino video: unit 0, revision 0, Indycam 

notice the 2nd cache is 1mb!!! and 24-bit color is very good and by
God I can tell it is faster than a P5-90...just look at how fast it
can animate a 3-d object full-screen.  However, it cost a lot
my than a P5...

and the following is a Indy2...

1 150 MHZ IP22 Processor 
FPU: MIPS R4010 Floating Point Chip Revision: 0.0
CPU: MIPS R4400 Processor Chip Revision: 5.0 
On-board serial ports: 2
On-board bi-directional parallel port 
Data cache size: 16 Kbytes
Instruction cache size: 16 Kbytes 
Secondary unified instruction/data cache size: 1 Mbyte 
Main memory size: 32 Mbytes 
EISA bus: adapter 0 
Iris Audio Processor: version A2 revision 1.1.0 
Integral Ethernet: ec0, version 1
Integral SCSI controller 1: Version WD33C93B, revision D 
Tape drive: unit 2 on SCSI controller 0: 
DAT Disk drive: unit 1 on SCSI 
controller 0
Integral SCSI controller 0: Version WD33C93B, revision D 
Graphics board:
GR3-XZ Indigo2 video: unit 0, revision 3

It is even faster, much faster than the Indy R4000 (faster XZ
Graphics board and R4400 150Mhz CPU, but it only has
32mb RAM)...it cost about $20,000 and will be used as a 
video production workstation, ie, hook up with a high-end VCR
and make movies...etc.

I like to use Indies, but if I were going to buy a computer
for personal use, I'd go for a P-5...after all, I am not
a rich professor :-)

It does look pretty, but a much better reason:

This is really vital in our work. All our (students) theses are now
being done in LaTeX, and most of the scientific writing.  But it is
the capabilities, not the fact that I use it that makes it worth
using. (I wrote my these B.T. and used an organic word processor. It
is much easier, although it eliminates a lot of revision
possibilities).
If your word processor can do the following, it is at least excellent
if you can use it.

1. Generate all the fonts and symbols that you need.
2. Keep track of references and citations, so that adding a
bibliography item "Arand" doesn't require manually updating almost
every citation.
3. Keep track of section numbers, theorem numbers, etc, so that
changes can be done automatically.
4. Do all the formating that you want/need. (For theses, most graduate
schools have a specific form that MUST be followed.)
5. Produce files that can be sent to others -- best via e-mail or ftp.
(Then they have to pay for the paper.) and allow distribution. The AMS
has set up a preprint distribution system, and there are other systems
as well, and they require some sort of standard that satisfies at
least 1 above.

Note: The requirements of 1 above vary greatly from field to field. I
would suspect that English requires less symbols that Mathematics, for
example. 

Enough, not really appropriate to this newsgroup anyway.

How about "Linux FOR a Pinhead"? This is a truly horrible idea. Read below

Sure. Why not give them a crippled Linux system to replace their crippled
DOS system. Multiuser account have purposes - like preventing newbies
from doing "rm /dev/*". If they can't understand multiple account, they
shouldn't be using Linux (or Unix, VMS, WinNT, Novell, ...).

Good idea - that way they won't have to learn Unix. Of course, without
tcsh, many scripts they get off the net won't work. But they won't know
how to install them anyway, right? Command.com is terrible - even DOS
users who have never touched Unix hate it (I always did). The shell is
one of Unix's wins - don't hide it.

But people don't like the functionality of DOS. They want more.

But Networking is small and simple to not install. If you leave it out,
then we won't be a real Unix. I can't wait to read the reviews of Unix
tcp/ip unbundled.

My brother has SCSI and he runs Windows. I know tons of dedicated OS/2 
users with SCSI. With PCI, SCSI is becoming more and more popular.

Good idea. We'll replace their optimized Windows driver with a slow 640x480
X server. That'll make a good impression.

This is Unix you said? I don't believe you.

Have you seen MCC+TinyX? It has Networking, etc. in less disks then that.

Why would people want to use it? What extra functionality will they have
when they can't:

1) Use virtual consoles
2) Network
3) Compile
4) Do cool pipes
5) Make X perform decently

This would be a highly crippled Linux distribution. I can't imagine how
this would convince a DOS/Windows user that Linux was a good thing. 
They'd take one look at it and laugh all the way home. You have to give
people a reason to give up there nice safe Microsoft-approved world. You've
removed all of the best reasons.

Subject: RAMDISK problem with new Slackware rootdisk
Date: Wed, 28 Sep 1994 07:32:18 GMT


I have built a new kernel and put it on a 'bare' Slackware 2.0.1 root floppy as
described in the Slackware FAQ. But when I boot, I get the following message:

   RAMDISK: 1474560 bytes, starting at 0x1c4ab6
   floppy: disk absent or changed during operation
   floppy I/O error
   dev 021C, sector 2
   RAMDISK: I/O error while looking for super block!
   VFS: Insert root floppy and press ENTER

The root disk is not loaded into the ramdisk, but continues to run off the
floppy disk. Fortunately I am installing from SCSI tape, but I am not able
to write the tape index on a floppy.

The original boot floppy worked allright.

Does anyone have any ideas of what the above message means.

I've always wondered why security is a less important issue among the
industry and the masses? Is it acceptable that you actually have to
REBOOT your computer? Is it acceptable that the operating system can
potentionally crash due to an error in an application? People must be
smarter than that? Or aren't they? Are they simply paralyzed by the
shaded buttons and the fancy icons?

Date: 28 Sep 1994 00:01:16 -0400

In compiling 1.1.50 with FPU emulation turned on (somthing I don't
normally do) the build fails on drivers/FPU-emu/poly_atan.c:

gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src2/kernel/linux-1.1.50/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -m486 -DPARANOID  -fno-builtin  -c poly_atan.c
{standard input}: Assembler messages:
{standard input}:266: Error: Unimplemented segment type 54002 in parse_operand

I did the above with a `-S' in place of `-c' and found the offending line to
be:

                 jnc 0f;

Assuming that 0f was being treated as octal by the assembler, but is supposed
to be hex, I changed it to `jnc 0xf;' and it assembled fine.  I'm not sure if
what I did is actually correct.

If I compile without optimization (no -O2) it works fine - no `jnc 0f' is
generated.

Has anyone seen an error of this sort?  I'm using gcc 2.5.6 and gas 2.3.

Thanks,
Marc

gcc foo.S

Use preprocessing tools (e.g. #define in the C preprocessor) to obtain
"macros". Use "0b, 0f, 1b, 1f" etc. instead of local jumps within
#defines.

If you'd like you can check my Apple II+ emulator that I wrote for
Linux. A large part is written in AT&T assembler using preprocessing
techniques to obtain "macros".
