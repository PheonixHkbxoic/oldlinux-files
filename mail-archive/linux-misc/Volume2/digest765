I'm going to guess that you have either a Sony CDU-31A or a CDU-33A.

Yes, we figured out the problem and the faulty driver and figured out
how to correct it..  (I sent a patch off to Linus so it should be
fixed for everyone soon enough.)

We hope to have a revision B boot floppy out later today for the
people using Sony CD-ROM drives.  Thanks.

Nothing of the sort.

We use `ext2' for hard drive installation and `iso9960' (with Rock
Ridge extensions) for our CD-ROM.  Both are the closest thing to
"standard filesystem" types for Linux.

In fact, `mkisofs' (create an iso9960 filesystem) is copyrighted by
Yggdrasil Computing and we placed it under the GPL for everyone's use.

Beyond that, our Fall 1994 CD-ROM is conformant to the Linux FSSTND,
but that is a whole different ball of wax.

Huh? The LaserWriter 360 has PCL, Postscript, and autosencing from all
ports. What's more compatable than that? Any postscript or PCL driver
should work with it unless you want to use the FAX option.

The July Issue of Circuit Cellar Ink- The Computer Applications Journel
has a short new product blurb on pg 11. No info on price or interface.
It's a 140MB medium, uses a 'new universal file system', and can play
audio MDs. I reckon that the fs could be the deciding factor on linux
support, depending on how open Sony is with it. The model shown is
MDM-111, and the US contact listed is Sony Electronics, 3300 Zanker Rd.
San Jose, CA 95134 (800) 352-7669. 

Looks pretty cool to me!

Subject: Clocks of the Diamond SpeedStar 64 Alpine (PCI)
Date: 15 Sep 94 20:19:29 GMT

I recently acquired a Zeos Pantera-90 that came with a Diamond
SpeedStar 64 Alpine PCI bus adapter.  I've installed Linux-1.1.42
successfully, but I can't discover the clocks on the video board.
I've run the version of SuperProbe that comes with XFree86-2.1.1
but it doesn't recognize the chipset (CLGD5434) and doesn't report
the clocks.  All it reports is the "Signature data: a8 (please
report)", and that the RAMDAC is either a Sierra SC1148{2,3,4}
15-bit or a SC1148{5,6,7} 15/16-bin HiColor.

I've also tried to run XF86_SVGA-2.1.1 with the -probeonly option,
but it won't report the clocks without a valid ModeDB entry.
But I can't produce a valid ModeDB entry without knowing the
clocks.  I tried creating a 28MHz ModeDB line but it makes the
characters in text mode unintelligible.

Can anybody tell me how to discover the clocks on this board?
The XFree86-2.1.1 documentqtion says that this board should be
supported by XF86_SVGA because it has the Cirrus chipset on it,
and somewhere the CLGD543x chipset is listed as working.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Yes, you said that already. I understand what you are saying. I don't
understand why you think you can't use the current comp.os.linux groups
for that stuff.

col.announce has been open for ads, price sheets and thinly disguised
announcements of ports of commercial software to Linux. col.misc has
been open to more ads and price sheets and announcements. col.help
has been open to problems with commercial distributions and people
looking for commercial providers. Some providers like Yggdrasil
post replies regularly to col.help, although they may not be reading
the groups on a regular basis and probably should. On the other hand they
run a commercial help line, and clearly state in their manual on what
basis help is available (I don't work for them, I use their distributions).

So what is it you want to post that you can't find place for??????

I understand the appeal of trying to create a group just for your
own use :-) but that's counterproductive. Post your ads where people
read other things, so they can see these too. The biz hierarchy is
believed to have a limited distribution and having articles there won't
keep them from expiring.

>Also it would give a place for vendors to have 
>a forum to discuss problems with product and current sales.

Why not use col.misc? Do you really think you would be flamed for that?

You may have been flamed once or twice for posting commercial stuff
to the col hierarchy, but I don't believe flamage here is anywhere close
to what it is in other groups. That is because, again, so far, the
commercial stuff has been well in line (IMHO) with expectations of
the linux users.

When that gets abused (hopefully never), it may be time to step up
the flamage and kick this stuff out of the groups, but I don't think
we are anywhere close to this point.

Now, that should not prevent us from splitting the groups further :-)
But this biz.linux hierarchy idea seems to head for a duplication
of existing groups, and we certainly don't need that. I may change my
mind if the subgroups are specifically disjoint from the col subgroups,
and I can't think off the top of my head of a way to do that. I hardly
thank that discussing current sales would get anywhere close to keeping
a newsgroup busy.

Help....

My system consists of a 486/66 with two old seagate drives 
(120 and 170 Mb).  I installed Linux on a partition on the secondary
drive and wrote LILO to the MBR, so that I could select the boot
partition.

Linux was nice, but I needed the HD space for something else, so I
used FDISK (dos) to remove the partition and rebuild the dos
partition to use the whole drive again.  I reformatted the drive
and noticed that LILO was still there - on the primary drive - OK,
fair enough - I wasnt too bothered.

I just got DOS 6.22 so I decided to upgrade.  I backed up my machine
and deleted all the partition info from both drives using FDISK (dos).
( This sounds a bit intense, but I was going to purge the drive
anyway - I collect a lot of shite !)

I installed DOS 6.22 and let it build the new partitions, and format
the disks, and install itself - brill - except that LILO is still
there - kind of - When I boot from HD, the screen fills up with
LI (^M) and continually scrolls up - not responding.

How do I get rid of the remains of LILO ?  I can only boot from
floppy now, and using the dos SYS command doesn't get rid of it.

Help.....

So, if you're intending to do raytracing, the Pentiums look awefully nice.

At almost 5 times the speed of a 486/dx2-66, the $600 should be easily
justified.

Now I hope you are kidding!!!  Anyone with half a brain knows the
e-field goes into the past, not you.  So you'll hear the sound too
soon.  If you are not carefull, you'll react to these sounds and avoid
whatever caused them.  The resulting temporal pardox will either cause
your entire body mass to convert into pure energy, destroying the
planet you are on, or give you a really nasty headacke.

Hmm, I think I paid $49.95 for the full set of the high density 3 1/2 disks
from Linux Systems Lab. The Linux Installation and Getting Started Guide
came with it too. And they even offered the CD to me for $29.95 and had 
EVERYTHING from the Slackware 2.0 distribution.

Sounds impressive, but nothing listed is stuff that you can't get from any
FTP site that mirrors Slackware and with so many vendors selling the complete
mirrors of some these FTP sites, why buy this?

Just some thoughts.
