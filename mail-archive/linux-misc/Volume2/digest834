Due to a major design mistake on USRs side, the "ole USR fax/modem" speaks
only fax class 1, which doesn't support distinguishing fax and data on
incoming calls.

FlexFax has some tricks built in to make the faxd trick the modem into
trying fax first and then data (or the other way round, or round-robin),
but it's not 100 per cent reliable.

 NO the Promise does not, as reported to me by Promise.  According to
the promise people all 3&4 drive support is done through the primary (i.e
standard) controller IO ports and addresses.  I have the source to 
Promise drivers for ATT & SCO under non-disclosure.  Unfortunately I
have not had the time to do much more than experiment and those
experiments have not been successful.  I know that they read the drive
configurations from the controller nvram but have not successfully be
able to get that to work under Linux.

I have two WDs on the primary port of my promise and get occasional
lockups also.  Mine do not appear to be related to heavy disk activity
however.  I would almost suspect a timing problem with defered writes 
(which is more likely to happen under heavy load).

Another thing about the Promise controller is that it does not
support the multisector (hdparm) transfers.  I am ready to sell mine
and just get a generic VL bus controller.

Reply-To: gmarzot@wellfleet.com


VGA16 seems to be the only mode detected by X when I start up on an NEC
UltraLite. I looked at the sample Xconfigs and found that the toshiba
laptop only listed VGA16 as well. Is there some inherent limitation here
or can I get 256 colors on my laptop? I know it can handle it since
windows runs with 256 colors.

BTW, I was running the UMSDOS kernel 0.3a and the very compact
distribution a[1-2].zip that comes with it. This is a really excellent,
unobtrusive way to get linux running on my laptop's small and partially
used hardrive. Way to go UMS!!

doc is NOT an editor for TeX.  Its output is NOT TeX, but more like the save
format that ez uses.  However, doc has no option to print your files.  It is
also unbelievably slow.

Hi.

I am looking for good reference books and/or magazines that include

Please reply by e-mail as I do not follow this newsgroup all the time.

Linus is now 24 years young (a puppy, that is), and will be 25 years old
before the end of the year.  He is not a graduate student, which at least
in Finland means that he isn't working on his PhD thesis.  The basic
grade you can get here corresponds to MSc in the US; after the MSc you
can continue to become a PhD.

There was one in issue 3 of the ancient Linux News (ftp to ftp.funet.fi
and search below /pub/OS/Linux).

Well, you are complaining abotu kernel compiels.  For a compiler, a math 
co-processor is useless, so Ild opt for the improved micrcode and caching 
of a 486.  (Note however that NOT all 486's are equal.  The IBM 
blue-lightening 486 for instance, is really a 386 with improved caching.  
it does NOt have the improved micrcode and runs somewhere btw a 386 and 486
in performance....)

:    You should note the the Indy has a MIPS R4600 processor, which is
:    much faster than Pentium.  Also, the SCSI Drive is faster and more
:    expandable than the Dell IDE.  Overall, the Indy will have much
:    higher throughput and lower price/performance.

But don't forget the costs for the OS-Support !!! 
IRIX 5.2 is a buggy piece of shit. It only looks good (i'm using it).
But the applications we use (CAD ...) are really fine. :-)

So every machine (PC or a WS) has its advantage:
If you are looking for a good application, and then the hardware it needs,
SGI should be a good choice.

If you buy first a computer and search after that for the right application,
then have to buy a PC or Nintendo.
But this isn't called a solution. - It's a game.

Look for a copy of xanim.  It should have in the docs the location of where to 
always find the most up-to-date version.  Version 2.69 supports sound.  While 
I can run .avi's and .mov's under X, the Quicktimes are the only ones with 
sound support.  Works great though - and this is on a 386-33 w/ 8 M.

A lot of this can be attributed to X Shared Memory extensions.
