Well, thanx a lot for all your comments on my previous posting, as
usual, some says I am insane, some says I have a few points of truth.

However, I'm not going into the discussion about which OS is the better
one or which WP is the best. I merely states that there are quite a few 
reasons *at the moment* for *not* putting Linux in a commercial
environment. So far none of your postings have made me change my mind.

When we are talking about customers and their *weird* environment, with
LAN's based on NetWare and TokenRing and there's an AS/400 in that ring
and they use their PC's to connect to the AS/400, Linux falls through.

I have used UNIX since 1987 and have been working 4 years with the
Norwegian distributor of a UNIX product called Q-office (87-91). I still
use Linux today for a lot of different tasks.

The only time my MS-DOS/Windows combination needs a reboot, is every
time I use Mosaic for Windows and it cannot open a connection. All the
other programs we run, and our customers run, are running flawlessly. 
They boot up in the morning and shut down in the afternoon.

The moment, we as an system integrator and network builder, can order
the different packages and install them without 'any' problems on
the different PC's, Linux might be interesting, but today, no!

It's also interesting that some people say: 'You can just transfer and
compile the different drivers and so on yourself'. In a business 
situation, we don't want to do that. We need packages that are tested 
and at least as stable as what you find in the MS-DOS world. Personally,
I run 1.1.51 and the latest ALPHA/BETA versions of the stuff around.
I also have a Mach64 card which runs X soothly, though unaccelerated.

When it comes to nationalization, what about man-pages in the local
language? This is something that needs to be done.

At last, some of yoy says 'Why not do something yourself?' There is so
much that should be done, but I can't manage, neither can my company
spare the time and money at the moment. But, if there are people in
Norway or the rest of Scandinavia whom might be interested in making
Linux more commerciable (>-|), maybe we could do something together.
If so, please mail me!

Happy computing everyone!

Svein Erik

Funny. If I should try to be honest, NeXT's support for academia was 
never better than today here in Germany. For 690,- DM you get a full 
NEXTSTEP user+developer for any supported hardware, leaving the actual 
hardware discounts to the manufacturer (and you know what that means e.g. 
for HP).

When they sold us their own black hardware, there was never more than 10% 
higher edu discount! That were the bad times for us!

Ok, if we speak of actually 'supporting' academia in Germany, well, I've 
never ever noticed that anytime.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

Subject: Reading from parallel port??

Reply-To: hank@automat.uni-essen.de

Hi everybody!

I'm trying to talk to my PostScript printer, which is connectec to a
parallel port. Sending data is no problem, but I'd like also to recieve
the 'answers' from teh printer, to get infos etc. without having to
print everyting on dozens of sheets of paper. But it seems to be not
possible to easily *read* data from a /dev/lp?. As I can see it, the
kernel does not have any functions to read from these port anyway.

So my question: is there any way of capturing the data the printer sends
to the parallel port? Thanks for any ideas!

        Cheers,
                Hank

/usr/src/linux/include/linux/autoconf.h is created after you do a make
config in the /usr/src/linux directory.  The kernel uses it, as well as
some other applications, to know how the kernel is configured.  There are
two ways it can be removed, one is to explicitly remove it and the other
is to do a make mrproper in the /usr/src/linux directory [can we get this
changed anyone?].  You will need to do a make config again to recreated it.

I'm looking for a source for either the adaptec 174x or ultrastor 24F
EISA SCSI controllers.  Since these are both out of production it seems
to be a good time to pick one up.   I've read that the 34F is now available
for $89 from CSC.   Unfortunately they don't carry any EISA controllers.
I currently have a VLB video card and IDE controller so I'd like to take
advantage of those empty EISA slots I have :).  Any tips to who might
still have some of these in stock.   I'll consider used, but prefer new.
I've checked the Computer Shopper, but its discount days are long gone.


Thanks in advance,

        Is it in the buffer?  Can't say yes or no for sure, but what I
        *am* sure about is that after I click on the other window, I
        can no longer paste my selection.

        So for you latecomers, let me again describe the problem:

          Two xterm windows up.  Select text in the first window.  Click
          on the second and try to paste.  Nothing happens.  I'm not
          in an editor, just have a shell (bash) in each window.  I'm using
          olvwm as my window manager.

        Another person thought it was relelated to my window manager.
        I don't think so.  I use olvwm on my Sun at work as well as at
        home, and I'm using the same config files on both machines.
        (Or very close to the same.  I don't know of any differences,
        but I'm not willing to swear on it.)

        Oh -- I use the oeft button to drag the highlighting for selection,
        and use my middle button to paste.  Note that cut and paste *does*
        work if I don't click on the second window first.

Actually, to be fair, Microsoft is the biggest player in the computer 
world. IBM is really a has-been and may be will-be but definitely 
not-here. Of course this is in the US, not Norway.

Yes, you're may be right, but we never said we want to force Linux on MS 
Windows users for whom double-clicking is an art.

Actually, if you do read these newsgroups, you'd see many .com and .org, 
once in a while a .mil and a .gov.

Subject: Term - Periodic traffic generation
Date: 23 Sep 1994 12:57:07 GMT


Is there a way to make term generate traffic periodically?

The problem I have is the timeout on the dial-in modem is small,
so if I get in the shower or go to lunch right before a tupload ends,
the modem times out and closes connection, thus I have to restart
everything more often then I'd like.

If there is not a way to do this, is there a tping or other sort
of utility avaiable, that I can throw in a script to periodically
ping my router on the net end?  I think this would solve the
problem, too.

Thanks!

Just to add my $0.02 to this, I have a Royal box at home.  When I
received it, the system had obviously not been burnt in.  The monitor
(still packed with the original tape) had several LARGE color distortions
and was wholely unacceptable.  Furthermore, the 3.5" floppy drive controller
cable *wasn't even plugged in*!

After calling them several times (over a period of 3 weeks while they kept
asking me to find someone locally to verify what my own eyes were showing
in regards to the monitor), I finally talked them into replacing the monitor.

After this rather major incident, I was not impressed.  Since then, I have
had the power switch on the front of the case fail on several ocasions (I'm
about to go to Ace and just get a cluggy switch to replace the acursed thing).
Once I got it turned on, I've vowed to just use my power strip to turn it on
and off.  :-/

All in all, I was *NOT* impressed.
