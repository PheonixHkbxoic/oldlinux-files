I think that the SpecInt92 values which are published by Intel
or MIPS are the results of the best available compilers with
the most suitable options.
The pentium gains about 15% with GCC2.5.8p vs. GCC2.5.8.

Subject: SCSI CD-ROM and TMC-850M wont work...
Date: Mon, 26 Sep 1994 16:42:12

Can somebody give me some suggestions regarding access to my CD-ROM?  I am 
using the Slackware 2.0 dist. with kernel version 1.0.9; I have a Future 
Domain TMC-850M scsi card and a Texel CD-ROM (SCSI of course, SCSI ID #2)... I 
have read the HOWTO regarding SCSI and CD-ROM; I have recompiled my kernel 
with SCSI CD-ROM and generic SCSI support turned on as well as iso9660 file 
system support;  I have created the device files as per the HOWTO.....

HOWEVER....  When I boot up I see the message:

scsi : 0 hosts.
scsi : detected 0 SCSI disks 0 CD-ROM drivers total.

ANY help will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
Oh, by the way, is there somewhere that I need to tell the driver what I/O 
address to use and what IRQ to use?  I don't remember supplying this 
information during setup -- or, is the driver auto-configuring?  Thx again.

Please respond via email.

This doesn't have anything to do with the `line length in Linux' because
there is no such thing. Individual programs may put limits on the length
of lines that they process, but these days this is no longer considered
Politically Correct -- the GNU coding conventions, for instance,
discourage this.

It is likely that you've run up against a limitation either on the
command line length or the input-buffer size in the shell you're
using, or else a limit on the size of the command line arguments of a
process in the kernel. From the description you're giving it is
difficult to tell which. RTFM for `xargs' to find a solution, perhaps.

FWIW, I have the same DELL, and I went and got that compiler (note that
this is *not* the one Intel released, but 2.5.8 that someone merged
in with the intel patches).  I had the same result as Valery - programs
ran exactly the same speed as the 486 optimized one, or a tiny bit
slower.  I tested it with a few real-world programs, like POVray.
The -04 option even crashed the compiler in a few cases.

So, either the compiler has problems, Dell lied to me and shipped 
a 486x200 (POV is amazingly fast anyway! YAY!), or there is some real
problem with the compiler/Dell architecture (which is an Intel motherboard).
Anyone else try this lately with a Petium and the gcc-i2.5.8p version?

Date: 27 Sep 1994 16:49:54 GMT

As I know, both Western Digital (now SMC?) 80x3 series and NE2000
series NIC work in linux, but which one will give better performance?

From manuals, WD80x3 uses memory mapped buffer (dual port?) but
NE2000 uses I/O ports, which one is faster in response, or which one
is more capable in sending/receiving back-to-back packets?

Then which (WD80x3 vs NE2000) one requires more CPU cycles to take
care with, let say per packet?

All the above is in the context of current linux (1.1.51?) kernel
network code.  What about in general, ie. disregard the relative
robustness of driver code in linux, what's the inherit merits of
the above cards?

Any comment is welcome, please either post here or email me.  I'll
summarize if I get sufficient replies.

Actually I can get OS/2 RAID support from various places. Good raid arrays

Date: 26 Sep 1994 23:08:57 GMT


Just thought I'd mention that the Pentium CPU is a match for ANY SGI
except ones based on the R8000, even the R8000 isn't muich faster
on INT but is 3-4 times on fp.  Yes even the ones with the 1 MB
L2 cache.  Not that the SGI's won't win some benchmarks, just that
the P-90/100 are in the same class.

SGI's are great for visualization because of software not some
other inherent advantage.

Of course when compared to machine in the same price range (running
at 100 Mhz, without L2 cache) it's even more favorable to the
Pentium.

Most low end Indy's don't have a Z buffer, or accelerated 3-d video,
I don't see any reason they should be any faster at 3-d visualization.
Of course SGI's come with much more software for such things, compared
to Linux.

If anyone has a benchmark that shows SGI's totally outclassing Pentiums,
I'd be interested in seeing it.

===============================================================================
                      Third BETA Distribution Announcement
===============================================================================

BSVC is a microprocessor simulation framework written in C++ and Tcl/Tk.
It was developed as a senior project at North Carolina State University
by Bradford W. Mott.  BSVC provides a graphical user interface and a
collection of C++ classes to facilitate the development of microprocessor
simulators.  So far the BSVC framework has been used to developed a 
Motorola 68000 simulator and a HECTOR 1600 simulator.  The BSVC distribution 
contains the following:

  * BSVC Graphical User Interface (written in Tcl/Tk)

  * BSVC Simulator Framework (C++ classes)

  * Motorola 68000 simulator & assembler (including the M68681 Dual UART)

  * Hector 1600 simulator & assembler


CHANGES
=======

This is the third BETA release of BSVC.  The following changes have been made:

  1.0b2 to 1.0b3:

    a) Added an INCLUDE directive to the 68000 assembler
  
    b) Fixed a bug in the Program Listing window that caused it to
       only work for programs listed in ascending order
           
    c) Corrected a small problem with the file selector that caused it
       to "grab" the mouse while reading a directory (This causes problems
       with networked file systems that take a long time to read)

    d) Fixed bugs in two of the Framework classes that caused them not
       to compile under GCC 2.6.0

  1.0b1 to 1.0b2:

    a) Added a BREAK instruction to the 68000 simulator and assembler
       that acts like a breakpoint.  When the simulator executes this
       instruction while "running" it will stop running like it
       hit a breakpoint.

    b) Added a new file selector to the user interface

    c) Fixed several small bugs in the HECTOR 1600 simulator


Supported Systems
=================

The BSVC distribution supports the following systems:

  * Linux 1.x.x
  * Ultrix 4.3
  * SunOS 
  * HP-UX 9.0


Required Software
=================

BSVC requires the following software to compile and run:

  * gcc and the g++ library

  * Tcl/Tk (Needs the "wish" executable with the addinput extension.
            I'm working on making "wish" binaries available for the
            supported systems listed above)

I have just jumped (headfirst, without looking) into the linux world,
and it was a bit scary, even though I'm not so much of a DOS/Win
weenie.  A "quickie" distribution of this type would be great for
people wanting to see what Linux was all about.  Going through boot
disk, root disk, setup, etc...is a bit much if it's for a trial
installation.  
        Anyone that actually does this should be careful so as to keep
the setup open enough such that the user can just add to it instead of
starting over with native linux fs (and the works).

      An odd kind of interface copyright if you can unilaterally take the
      "copyright" away from the "copyright holder", by actually programming
      to that interface.

      In other words, if you don't like the gmp "interface copyright", write
      a package that is compatible with it (that people would seriously
      use).  That act takes away the "interface copyright", which could not
      happen under copyright law if an actual copyright on the interface was
      claimed.

   So whether or not package A can be distrbuted only under the terms
   attached to package B depends on the existence or non-existence of
   package C, where A, B, and C do not share any lines of codes and are not
   otherwise derived from one another?

   This is rational?

Sure, because the copyright for B says that if you use it, you're
making a derivation, and copyright law says that you can control the
use of derivations.

What you're hoping for is a world where every rule can be written down
in advance, and no interpretation of rules is ever necessary.

   I suppose that since no one else has written a freeware distribution of
   MS-DOS, the fact that your drivers dynamically link with MS-DOS means
   that they are "one program", and you are therefore misappropriating
   Microsloth's program by using the subterfuge of distributing drivers
   separately from MS-DOS?

No, because neither MS-DOS nor the packet driver spec were written as
an escape from the GPL.

Subject: Source copyable software is better than artificial life
Date: Thu, 29 Sep 1994 13:08:40 GMT

I don't know a lot about this artificial life stuff
-- but I'm suspicious of anything Newsweek gets goofy about
-- and I suspect its primary use is as another money extraction tool
to be applied by ai labs to the department of defense
(and more power to 'em).

Nevertheless in wondering why free software is so good these days
it occured to me that the propagation of free software is one gigantic
artificial life evolution experiment, but the metaphor isn't perfect.

Programs are thrown out into the harsh environment, and the bad ones
die.  The good ones adapt rapidly and become very robust in short
order.

The only problem with the metaphor is that the process isn't random
at all.  Python _chooses_ to include tk's genes;  Linux decides
to make itself more suitable for symbiosis with X, etcetera. 

Free software is artificial life, but better.
