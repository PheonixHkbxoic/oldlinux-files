If you are using ncurses then you SHOULD be using the <termcap.h>
that comes with it. This is kinda the point!

So how do you propose handing your problem? <ncurses.h> includes
<unctrl.h>. Without the -I you won't find it. Besides ncurses 
could be installed elsewhere (eg. /usr/local/include).

        Gateway-2000 P4D-100 (486DX4-100 PCI) system. I am really happy with

Please follow the section called "SETTING UP A MACHINE FOR INCOMING
PPP CONNECTIONS" in the README.linux file.

The trick to set up a 'dynamic IP' address is to simply fix the IP
address on the linux side. If you have multiple ports into the Linux
system, then want to setup the IP address, one for each of the
ports. The IP address would go into the configuration file for each
tty line. For example, /dev/ttyS1 would be called /etc/ppp/options.ttyS1.
The software gets the name of the tty with ttyname(), removes the /dev/
prefix, and uses the remainder as the key to the file name.

Always put your local address in the file. I use 10.128.5.10 in this
example. This defines the value that the remote must use as it's
remote address. This IP address does not need to be unique. You may
use the same IP address for all of your incoming lines, as well as one
of the ethernet devices.

For example, if you wish to the remote to use the local address of
10.128.4.12, then you would put the following into the
/etc/ppp/options.ttyS1.

10.128.5.10:10.128.4.12
-detach

The options.tty file is accessed while the pppd process is still root.

In this manner, your client would not specify a remote address. The
address would be assigned to the value in the options file on the
server. Each port which the user connects would have a unique
address. Let the telephone equipment do the hunting for a non-busy
line, and by association, modem.

The -detach parameter prevents the pppd from forking into the
background.  Since it is started by uugetty, the fork would confuse
the getty process into thinking that the shell has disconnected.

(I'll add this to the documentation for the next version. Thanks for
the help.)

For gcc 2.5.8 yes.  But I believe gcc 2.6.0 does some more

yeah, I remember the PC-Unix set (something like that) that you could

I'm using a Zeos P90 PCI - it has only been a few days since I installed,
though.  Seems like it runs just fine and smaller load on heavy tasks than
I get on NETCOM at 3:30 am ;)  I haven't got X to run yet; xinit complains
about a missing config file.  My configuration is:

  Zeos P90, 16 MB RAM, 540 MB IDE HD & 340 MB IDE HD, Mitsumi CD-ROM (*),
  2 * 16550 serial ports, Phoenix BIOS (v4.0??), Diamond Stealth 64 (using
  the S3 Vision 964 64-bit chip - not tested yet...), Practical Peripherals
  PM14400FXMT modem - not tested yet), Microsoft mouse (not tested yet).

I been throught a lot of the standard Unix utils, and they all seem to run
just fine.

(*) The Mitsumi drive, as configured by Zeos, needs the command "mcd=0x310,10"
when booting the Mitsumi kernel otherwise Linux won't recognize the drive.

The Hurd is coded for the i386/i486 architecture. BTW, my work in the
`Linux on Mach' project (was formerly knows as linuxss) is based on
the Hurd: ie. my goal is to implement Linux compatibility on the
Hurd. Right now I have an ext2fs server working (but still alpha).

So the Hurd does not spell doom for Linux.

Thank you for reading this.
I have a slight problem with linux/os2-2.1/dos-win.

I have a 1gig ide drive, on which I am trying to install os2 
and linux to replace dos-win.

problem 1 > os2 boot manager freeses when I select dos boot.

problem 2 > linux doesn't understand the drive, possibly
                because of my BIOS.

problem 3 > I am using stacker on another disk that has all of my 
                DOS applications, which I wish to retain, and
                can't un-stack because that drive is small.

problem 4 > tape drive / sound card / cd-rom all seem
                non-functional under OS2 and linux.
                Am I missing something obvious?

I spend the weekend going through news, documentation, and FAQs.
I didn't find much to help.
I think getting stacker for OS2 will solve some problems,
but is there a stacker for linux?  Or should I byte the bullet (sorry)
and delete some applications?  

Any help welcomed.

thnak you again,
        p

Once upon a time there was a DOS user who saw Unix, and saw that it was
good. After typing cp on his DOS machine at home, he downloaded GNU's
unix tools ported to DOS and installed them. He rm'd, cp'd, and mv'd 
happily for many days, and upon finding elvis, he vi'd and was happy. After
a long day at work (on a Unix box) he came home, started editing a file,
and couldn't figure out why he couldn't suspend vi (w/ ctrl-z) to do
a compile.

That day he want and got Linux (0.95) and installed it. Viola! ctrl-z worked
and all was good.

That user was me, and DOS's illusion broke down pretty quickly for me.
