Subject: Linus' visit to Perth
Date: 25 Sep 1994 22:11:40 -0700

[ Article crossposted from aus.computers.linux,aus.auug ]
[ Author was Patrick D'Cruze ]
[ Posted on 22 Sep 1994 02:39:19 +0800 ]

I thought I might post a brief summary of Linus' presentation at WAUG.

I'd never attended a WAUG meeting before.  I wasn't really sure about what
they did and what happened in their meetings.  So I didn't know what to
expect.

I got there about 15 minutes early.  After obtaining a brochure on WAUG and
AUUG I was pleasantly surprised to see free copies of the September issue
of the Linux Journal.  I believe that LJ sent over 200 copies of the issue
to WAUG at very short notice - well done LJ.  I didn't take a copy (I've
already got the issue at home) but I think many people were quite interested
in its contents - it was a real eye-opener for some.

The meeting started at about 6pm and Linus stepped up after a short
introduction and began his presentation.  His presentation gave an
introduction to Linux, to some of Linux's main features, a few of its
internals, current developments, and future developments and the benefits
of free software.  I don't think there were quite as many questions as the
SLUG meeting but there were nevertheless some significant questions asked.

Two highlights during the presentation:
a) someone asked if Linus could compare Linux and BSD4.4.  This brought
a huge response from the rest of us - I think we've all witnessed the
massive flame wars that erupt whenever someone asks this question on
Usenet.  Linus diplomatically declined to comment claiming a certain
degree of bias :)

b) Linus was commenting upon how he still hasn't earned his bachelor (of
computer science?) from the university yet.  Its an interesting procedure
though because Linus is allowed to teach a few courses at the university
even though he hasn't formally studied the units at the university.
However by teaching them he gets credits for those units towards his
degree.  I guess there's just no substitute for 'on the job experience'.

After the meeting people chatted outside and helped themselves to the beef and
bread carvery.  There was a lot of people waiting to meet and talk with Linus
and I'm glad I took the opportunity to do so.  Linus is a very personable
fellow and I certainly agree with Jamie Honan's sentiments when he stated
that "you couldn't meet a nicer bloke".

Linus now has a few days to enjoy WA's hospitality and I believe he's
heading up to Monkey Mia on Thursday.  He'll be giving a tutorial
on Linux kernel internals on Saturday morning and then departs Australia
on the Sunday for a week in Singapore.  And then will end another leg of
the Linus Torvalds World Tour.  I would've volunteered to show Linus
around our fair city in his remaining days here but I beleive he already
has a number of tour guides to do that :)

In closing and on behalf of many many people, I would like to thank WAUG
and AUUG for bring Linus to Australia and for allowing us non-WAUG
members the opportunity of attending Linus' presentation.  Their generosity
is very greatly appreciated.  And I'm sure that everyone who obtained a
copy of the Linux Journal feels doubly appreciative.  I know of quite a
few people who will subsequently be sending in applications to AUUG and this
is perhaps the highest compliment I can give.

And hopefully it won't be so long before we see Linus in Australia again. :)

Subject: Usenet groups via SLIP

New Topic Alert!  Flame Suppression equipment enabled.

I have a linux system set up to run over SLIP at this time.  I dial into
my slip server every night to get my SMTP mail.  The mail-server trys to
deliver mail every 30 minutes.  Therefore, I may have a waste of up to 30
minutes waiting for mail.  What I would like to do is set up an NNTP news
transfer program to accept the groups I follow down to my Linux machine. 
From there, I could read, post, etc.  What I am looking for is what I
would need to setup in terms of configuration files, etc. and what program
would work best.  I don't expect to receive enough news to overload the 
bandwidth.  Only about 10 groups.

        Thanks for any help

Maybe he should.  PC World magazine, in their Sept. 94 issue, rated the
Dell Dimension XPS P90 with the above config a #1 Best Buy at $3828.  I'm
sure _they_ must have called Dell at one time or another.

Sounds like two realities are in effect here ... one belonging to the 
Dell rep who talked to the PC World folks and the other belonging to the
Dell rep who talked to Mr. Pyeatt.  It doesn't inspire a lot of faith in 
Dell phone support.

I found that, at a hit on some functionality (not really a priority for me),
using the -n option with [R]TIN eliminated the nasty "Reading active
news file..." delays.

The catch, though, is that you need to create a .newsrc that contains
only the newsgroups you care about.  The newsreader will then only
acquire information relevant to these groups.  This means, of course,
that a "goto" command specifying a group not on your active list
results in an "not in active file" error.

I find that that the drawbacks don't annoy me too much, as my
subscription list is fairly fixed, and I rarely need to read/post
elsewhere.  (Furthermore, TIN has always been my newsreader of choice,
and I didn't want to part with it :-)

: 2. SGI Indy does not cost ~3 times more than a top of the line DELL.

:         CD Rom Drive, 1G IDE disk, ethernet card, 3 year warranty.
:         Price: ~$4400

Funny in my 2 month old magazine I see a DELL P-90, 16 MB ram, 17" monitor,
#9 2 MB vram card (250k xstones), 1 GB disk, 3*cdrom for
$3899.   I'm sure the ethernet card doesn't cost $500

:       SGI Indy, 16 Meg Ram, 17" monitor, accelerated graphics
:         1G FAST SCSI Drive, ethernet, CCD camera, 3 year warranty.
:         Price: ~$6500

Best price I've seen.

:    You should note the the Indy has a MIPS R4600 processor, which is
:    much faster than Pentium.  Also, the SCSI Drive is faster and more
:    expandable than the Dell IDE.  Overall, the Indy will have much
:    higher throughput and lower price/performance.

SCSI has it's advantages.  But EIDE has a higher peak speed (12-13 Mb/sec),
and can handle 4 drives (which isn't bad).

Isn't that price for the 100 Mhz 4600?      INT   FP    
SGI IndyPC   R4600     50/100 16/16         62.8  49.9 May94 SGI anno

Hardly competition for a p90:
Intel XPRESS Pent735   90     512+8/8       90.1  72.7 Mar94 comp.arch(Intel)

Even if it's the 133 Mhz with L2 cache (I doubt it):
SGI IndySC   R4600     66/133 512+16/16     93.7  72.9 Aug94 SGI anno

Still slower.

So I suspec to get 62 specint you spend $6500 or get 90 specint for 
$3900 with Dell.  BTW you can get scsi p-90's with 17" for less from
other vendors.

I find that DOZ/Windoze takes *a* *lot* of administration in order
to make programs run right. The process mostly consists of
1. Edit config.sys
2. Edit autoexec.bat
3. reboot.

I think that over the last 4 years I have spent at
least 2-3 weeks in this loop. Usually in order to
release more memory for a new application.

In dos 6+ this has become a little bit better, since
it allows you to have different startup options
in your config.sys and autoexec.bat. But this will
of course mean that you have to sacrify something
in order to make other things work. And if you want
to swich from doing one thing to doing something else,
you might have to reboot.

In linux, this is no problem. On my 16MB box I realy
*have* 16MB to play with, not 640.

  2.  What is the purpose of the lost+found directory?

  3.  Why does ext2 have a bunch of options that don't do anything yet?

It doesn't seem to be a Linux specific port as the IRIX version is also

I think you've run across an annoying "feature" of elvis, rather than a
feature of xterms.  Try vim, works better for me.

YES IT IS, at least it may be misconfigured. I have this 'problem' on two

Seeing that fvwm is in the keywords list leads me to believe that it is not

I use "OpenWindows.SetInput:   followmouse". I don't have to click on a 
window to type in it but sometimes I want to raise it before pasting.
(I don't like autoraise). Clicking on the title or border should not 
unselect anything. 

Again I ask the question: "how do we fix this".
