I'm not sure if this will work for me.  I'm trying to speed the program up, and
using more precision causes it to converge faster.  The multi-precision 
functions are probably so much slower than the native machine instructions that
any speed gain from fewer iterations will be lost.  Since the x87 does all its
math at 80-bits internally anyway, using 80-bit numbers will just increase
load/store operations a little.

What if my program doesn't use any REALs or complex numbers?  It has integers
of course, and I can't make them 40-bit.

From RFC 1597 . . . .

3. Private Address Space

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved the
   following three blocks of the IP address space for private networks:

        10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255
        172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255
        192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255

   We will refer to the first block as "24-bit block", the second as
   "20-bit block, and to the third as "16-bit" block.  Note that the
   first block is nothing but a single class A network number, while the
   second block is a set of 16 contiguous class B network numbers, and
   third block is a set of 255 contiguous class C network numbers.

   An enterprise that decides to use IP addresses out of the address
   space defined in this document can do so without any coordination
   with IANA or an Internet registry.  The address space can thus be
   used by many enterprises.  Addresses within this private address
   space will only be unique within the enterprise.

Subject: Summary: SCSI and IDE working together (MS-DOS/Win & Linux)
Date: Tue, 20 Sep 1994 23:49:52 GMT

About a week ago, I posted requesting information about the
experiences of the Net regarding SCSI/IDE combinations in
general, and specifically in regard to MS-DOS/Windows and
Linux setups.  Though the original query went out in a couple
of different forms to a number of different lists and groups,
this single summary is being cross-posted to those newsgroups.

I received responses from a number of people, and while a
few indicated that problems would abound, most agreed that
this setup was generally problem free.

Specifically, of those with Buslogic and Adaptec 1522 SCSI
controllers not one reported problems.  One person who has
a Trantor 130B indicates that while it works, it is very
difficult to configure.

While obvious to many, conflicts between address and IRQ spaces
between IDE and SCSI controllers were mentioned often.  One
person suggested a combination IDE & SCSI controller but
provided no more specifics (anyone have a specific one in mind?)

Two or three people report being able to boot MS-DOS off of the
SCSI drive but most indicated that booting off of the IDE would
be the only workable solution.  One suggested that connecting
the IDE drive to the middle connector on the ribbon cable 
connecting it to the controller would enable it to be the D:
drive and the SCSI drive the C: drive.

As far as booting Linux, consenus seems to be that LILO needs to
be on the IDE drive and everything else can be anywhere.

As far as contact information goes, I got Adaptec info from the
SCSI FAQ but can't locate Buslogic info...anybody?

I thank those who responded and if anybody has anything to add
either followup to this summary or email me.

Subject: Support for CD-ROM hosted by sound card
Date: Tue, 20 Sep 1994 16:44:08 GMT


I have recently acquired a CD-ROM based distribution of Linux 
(Walnut Creek).  My system is somewhat out of date (AMD 386DX40...,
), and underconfigured (quaint 170MB IDE drive...).  Fortunately,
there is the luxury of consulting the expertise out in netland
before purchasing additional hardware.

Two upgrade paths seem feasible:

1) Sound card with CD-ROM support; appropriate CD-ROM drive;
   2nd large IDE hard drive

2) SCSI host adaptor; SCSI CD-ROM drive; large SCSI hard drive


Option 1 is more appealing with the added functionality of
a sound card, and probably lower cost.  Option 2 would be
higher performance, and components could eventually migrate 
to subsequent non-PC platforms.

The Linux FAQ and HOWTO's have been very helpful in cataloging
supported hardware, but there are a few points that need
clarification.  

In particular, I am wondering whether there is current, alpha, 
or planned support for CD-ROM hosted by the Gravis UltraSound MAX 
card? 

Are there any strong testimonials for other sound card/CD-ROM
combinations?  The HOWTO's explicitly state support for ProAudio
Spectrum and various Sound Blaster products.  I have no special
requirements for sound card features, aside from an aversion
to conspicuously obsolete technology.

Thanks in advance for any info.


Cheers,
Jean.

Doesn't the coprocessor do all arithmetic internally in 80 bits already? 
If so, the question then becomes whether or not it is prudent to keep
around the extra bits from the 80 bit internal operation when stored in
variables.

I think you can use 80-bit values (tenbytes) directly but you need to drop
to some inline asm to accomplish it, since the language doesn't support it
directly.

We have had a similar probem.  We are running slip to our internet

just sits  3) provides a login prompt, takes input, and never gives the 
password prompt (ususally creating a login zombie in the process).  

This is our singularly most vexing problem.  It has been present since 
the first <1.0 kernel we used (now 1.1.45).  

Anyone else seeing such behaviour?

                       create are stored on the HD

custom (35 megs)       Small set of programs, including a minimal X-Windows
                       setup, are stored on the HD.  Supposedly the X
                       "control panel" lets you install other packages, but
                       it never worked for me...

standard (600 megs)    Supposed to be only 300 megs, but the Yggdrasil guys
                       changed it at the last minute to include storage of
                       all the source code (compressed) in the HD
                       installation.  This setup contains pretty much every-
                       thing that's on the CD.

complete (1 gig)       Everything on the CD; source code decompressed.

        The programs that are included on this CD pretty much cover
everything you'd need for a solid Linux system: X-Windows (along with a slew
of graphic editors, games, graphic file viewers, multimedia mail, on and
on), emacs, TeX, Ghostscript, gcc, communication software (minicom, xc,
rz/sz, seyon, kermit), mail readers (elm, pine, mail, smail/rmail),
newsreaders (tin, nn), UUCP stuff, TCP/IP networking stuff, ftp, gopher,
yadda yadda yadda...  You name it, it's there.  If only there were options
to install by package instead of the above CD dependencies...  The
distribution could use a bit of work.

        But for systems that only have about 40 megs to dedicate to Linux,
the Plug-and-Play CD is a fairly good option.  It needs some tweaking, but
it gives you access to programs that you would otherwise not have access to
without lots of hard drive space.  Hell, it's only about $25...
