What's more, if I remember correctly, the original reason for this
agreement was that Intel wanted to sell to the government, who won't
buy anything unless there's a second source for it.  (an entirely
sensible rule, if you ask me).

If you have ispell, what you can do is make a symlink from ispell to spell.
This is mentioned in the ispell man page.  What it says, is that if you 
run ispell as "spell" (i.e. a symlink), it will operate as the original
unix spell did.  After creating a symlink from ispell to spell, my Pine 
spell-checking works great!

I bought one becuase the Linux distritribution I was trying to use

(well, next to Linux itself) for a couple days.  A few months later I
realized I hadn't used it at all after those first couple days, so I
gave it away.

Now that DOOM is out for Linux, I might have to scrounge up a sound

My older machine is a 386-20 with 2MB RAM.  I use it to play with SLIP
to my 486.  It has two MFM drives connected to it and currently runs
Linux 1.1.52.  Enough to ftp to it, but unusable for serious work.

Absolutely.  If I can get 8 256k 30 pin SIMMs, I'm going to set up my
old 386DX40 motherboard this way (I've got a few spare ethernet cards
laying around anyway).

You might just want to run free DOS/Windows TCP/IP software for that
function though.  If you just boot up and run KA9Q, you should get
bitchin' performance out of a box like that.  KA9Q should have better
network performance than the Linux kernel does, I would think.

But it is not posted to this group, which is probably the most logical
place for a newbie to look (based on names). I think this is a very
good argument for support of Ian Jackson's proposal to post the FAQ
in all Linux groups.

It doesn't!  The setuid bit that applies for scripts is the one on the
*command interpreter*.  It is then up to the command interpreter to
decide if it wants to honour the setuid bit on the script (the command
interpreter has to be setuid root in order to be able to do this.  It
is doable with perl, but not with bash).

I was at UNIX open in Vienna and the general distributor for Austria
told me that Frame will bring with the new version of Frame Maker
in March also a Linux Version of Frame Maker.

Go on.

I wonder if it will cost $2000 for a single floating license like the SCO
version does.

You can get a single for $300 and at school we used to run the single on
multiple machines all the time.  No idea why.  I personally think
floating licenses are a ripoff.  I know people with more than one
machine at home and it's stupid for them to not be able to log into
either of them and run a program.

Yeah, I know all about loss of sales but I think most of that is BS.

Subject: Comments about the Linux WP idea

In article <37mion$kjm@solaria.cc.gatech.edu>, byron@gemini.cc.gatech.edu

 : I think we can integrate existing editor (JED), menu(dialog), mouse(the
 : selection replacement of the Mouseless Commander), formatter (QuikScript),
 : and renderer (GhostScript) into a workable system that can meet the basic
 : wordprocessing demands of most folks.

The fundamental question is how the buffer is going to be implemented---
what will the data structure look like.  Fundamentally, a word processor and
an editor are very different.  I suspect that the best choice for a data
structure for the WP would consist of a linked list of paragraphs.  Perhaps
the paragraph should be implemented as a buffer gap. Also, how will the
character attributes be stored?  Should we store an attribute with each
character?  Should the data structure consist of a parallel stream of
attributes?  Questions like this are going to be fundamental to the
development of the WP.  I suspect that it is NOT a good idea to integrate an
existing editor into the WP.

The user interface should be fairly simple to implement.  For example,
consider my S-Lang library.  It already has routines for multiple keymaps,
keyboard tty input, Screen Managment Facility (with color), etc...  In fact,
much of JED is interfaced to this library.  The rest of JED consists of
routines to handle its representation of the buffer.  Finally, I am also
working on a Text based window library for S-Lang.  One could incorporate
this library into the WP to handle windows, Scroll bars, dialog boxes,
etc... to make it look pretty.

But, the fundamental question remains:  What will the representation of the
buffer look like?

Finally, is this project worth doing?  How well does DOSEMU run Wordperfect?
Can it run Wordperfect over a serial line?  If we ever do get a WP for Linux
off the ground and functional, will it be better than Wordperfect running
under DOSEMU over a serial line?   (I am emphasising serial line because I
would like to use something like it remotely from, e.g., a vt100)

Always willing to play Miss Thistlebottom, let me just remind you guys to
make sure those data structures can accommodate wide characters (e.g. what
you'd find in Unicide) and that your wrapping and other algorithms aren't
obsessive about text going left-right all the time!
