+                 RESPONSE FROM SWT TO MY COMPLAINTS
+
+I E-mailed to SWT a preliminary revision of this review on July 17,
+1994 and offered them a chance to respond to the claims made in it.
+They never responded.
+
+Others who were interested in purchasing hardware from SWT and who
+have seen this review asked SWT to respond to the complaints raised in
+it.  One such response from Marvin Wu, which was forwarded to me by
+its recipient, contained what I consider to be lies.  Here's what he
+wrote, with my comments interspersed in it:
+
+>       We have two unsatisfied customers so far, Jonathan Kamens being
+>       one. He had the machine for three months, without paying anything
+>       except part of the shipping.
+
+That's sort of true, with the exceptions that (a) "part of the
+shipping" came to over $100, (b) he mentioned nothing about the
+bounced refund check, (c) he mentioned nothing about the $4
+check-bouncing charge which SWT never paid me back for (they never
+even acknowledged my mail about it), and (d) the system didn't work
+properly, and I spent much time trying to get it to work properly, for
+the entire time I had it.
+
+>       The probelm of the machine was
+>       mostly due to the Seagate scsi driver, as we've sold many
+>       identical systems with other SCSI adaptors doesn't have any
+>       problem at all. This is solved now by the NCR53C810 driver.
+
+I think that's a lie.
+
+Many people are using the Seagate SCSI driver.  I simply don't believe
+that it caused significant problems with my system.  None of the
+problems I experienced seem to me to be directly or indirectly
+attributable to problems with a SCSI driver.
+
+If the problem with my machine was "mostly due to the Seagate scsi
+driver," then why did SWT send me replacements for the CPU cooling fan
+and power supply on my system, and why did most of the problems I was
+experiencing go away after making those replacements?
+
+During the entire time I was working with SWT to get the machine
+working, Mr. Wu never said a word to me about the Seagate SCSI driver
+causing most of my problems.  Once, shortly after the machine arrived,
+he mentioned in passing that the Seagate card might be causing
+problems, but he never mentioned it again, and nothing that happened
+subsequently supported that possibility.  He also didn't mention
+anything about the Seagate driver when I sent him my review of SWT and
+asked him for comments before posting it.
+
+Why did he never say anything about the Seagate SCSI card being a
+problem before I returned the machine?  And if they discovered *after*
+I returned the machine that it's what was causing the problem, why
+didn't they tell me so and offer to send back the machine with another
+controller?
+
+Incidentally, I didn't ask for the Seagate SCSI controller; they
+offered it to me; that particular controller was their choice, not
+mine.  Presumably, if they were going to pick a controller to sell me
+without any preference on my part, they would have picked one that
+they sell regularly.  And if that's the case, then how come none of
+their other systems with that controller had any trouble?
+
+
+            BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU COMPLAINT AGAINST SWT
+
+On July 25, 1994, I filed a complaint about SWT with the Better
+Business Bureau for the greater Dallas area, asking for reimbursement
+for all my shipping costs, reimbursement for my bank's bad-check
+charge, and an admission of fault from SWT.
+
+The BBB forwarded my complaint to SWT on July 29, 1994 and asked for a
+response.  As of August 22, they had received no response, so they
+sent a followup letter with another copy of the complaint.  They again
+received no response, so on September 8, they closed the complaint
+without resolution.
+
+As of September 26, their automated complaint information system had
+no information about the company.  I spoke to a representative and
+asked why, and she said that they don't actually tell anyone that
+there are complaints against a company until "enough" people complain.
+I asked what "enough" means, and she said that it varies.
+
+Therefore, if you've had trouble with SWT, and they did not resolve
+your complaint to your satisfaction, I encourage you to file a
+complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  You can get a complaint
+form by calling 214-220-2000 or by writing to Better Business Bureau
+of Metropolitan Dallas, Inc., 2001 Bryan Street, Suite 850, Dallas, TX
+75201.

hi all,

I have testet the other adresses ... it works fine!
The Problem is the soundcard. This BS-card catch ever adress between 0x330
and 0x339, this means ever 0x33x. (too simple control-logic ;-0 )
So , if i'm using 0x334 for my adaptec, the soundcard and my adaptec fight 
each other, and i'm the looser ;-(

thanx all for the hints.
so long Stephan.

Because in my personal opinion manufacturers aren't the least bit interested
in writing scanner drivers for Linux. I've talked to representatives for
both HP (at Comdex) and Canon (over the phone). I had the hardest time
getting them to understand that I wasn't running DOS/Windows. Once I succeeded
in doing that the HP folks tried to get me to buy one of developers kits
(which allows one to write custom DOS/Windows applications using HP's current
TWAIN driver) while the Canon person said he needed to talk to his "exclusive"
developer (oh about 6 months ago - haven't heard from him since.). So I'm 
admittedly discouraged. The manufacturers seem to think that anything other 
than Windows is a waste of time.

In all honesty all we really need is the interface specifications for the
interface card and the scanner. But getting the representatives I've talked
with to understand the concept is like pulling teeth. Then when the light
finally clicks on the standard response is "I have no idea how to get that
information.". Maybe I'm just asking the wrong folks the wrong questions.

My plan (which is stated in the Info-Sheet) is to check out EPSON because
as far as I know they are the only flatbed scanner manufacturer that actually
releases the hardware/interface specs for their interface boards.

Did you include the WHOLE time for installing the numerous tools that you would
need to have an equivalent system, all the apps that are basic in Linux.
Besides: I don't know what you guys are 'installing' so much.
It took me one afternoon to install almost all of slackware, one german
LaTeX addon, an extra GUI-Lib and some further stuff, like my old WinWord 2.0 
Texts. I even have a diamond card (And had to find out that this and 
only this one is suported)
I wouldn't consider this a summer worth of free time.

I didn't say anything about this. My objection was the flat-out
observation that no such software even _exists_ for Linux, which
is obviously false.

Get my script from eecs.nwu.edu in /pub/linux/doom/doom.tgz to fix it.

Well, here in Houston you can get a fully loaded 486 board with 3 VLB slots,
256k L2 cache, and AMI or Award BIOS for about $100.  No CPU.

A 486dx33 with the above stats is about $230, a 486dx2/66 is about $320.
These prices are for CPU and motherboard.

I don't know what the prices are like in Mass., but this might give you
some idea of pricing.  (In the US, anyway)

You can accomplish this by rebooting with the "Boot" and "Root" disks 
provided in the Slackware Distribution and mounting the drive with RW

Holy catfish, Batman!  We plan to install Linux, and were going to get a 
Digiboard for dialin lines.  What are people using for this, if not 
Digiboards?  Please email me for a response, in addition to any post

Thanks!!

Date: 24 Sep 1994 05:41:47 GMT


Does anyone know if drivers have been written for this card yet??

I think it uses a cirrus logic 5434 chipset

I would obviously prefer the driver to be public domain

I know that it is supposed to be coming in xfree86 3.1, when is this due
out???  

Is there any way i can get an advance copy of the driver??


And what does accelerated vs. unaccelerated support mean on the linux 
hardware compatability sheet??

thanx,
