Statements like this always make me run to my Linux Counter database.
A VERY fast grep on simple registrations only gave me:

aun% grep 'edu:' countlist | wc -l
    1229
aun% grep 'com:' countlist | wc -l
    1097

This does not weed out duplicates, does not count "form" entries, and
generally only leaves a rough idea, but still...
What is more amazing is that the relation between "home" use and "work"
use is just about the same in both groups:

aun% grep 'com:' countlist | grep 'home' | wc -l
     894
aun% grep 'com:' countlist | grep 'work' | wc -l
     234
aun% grep 'edu:' countlist | grep 'home' | wc -l
     986
aun% grep 'edu:' countlist | grep 'work' | wc -l
     281

That is, 75% home, 25% work.
Linux is not for academics only. But most of us use it at home.

(According to my estimates, between 37.000 and 950.000 use it at work.
This is not an insignificant number)

Subject: NYC Linux Meeting at Unix Expo - Tuesday Oct4
Date: Mon, 3 Oct 1994 13:45:57 GMT

There will be a New York City (and region) Linux Users Group meeting at Unix
Expo at New York's Jacob Javits Center on Tuesday October 4, at 5.30pm.  It
will be in the conference room area on the lowest level.

Please check at the NYC Linux Users Booth #1888 for the room number (or with
the Linux Journal's booth 1881) during the show, ie before 5pm.

The general theme of the evening will be "ask the guru", and we will be
trying to encourage as much interaction between the attendees as possible. 
There will be a panel of knowledgable Linux users on hand to discuss issues
from how to configure hardware, to the future of the Linux OS for both
recreational (DOOM) and corporate use.  The Panel will include:
Michael K. Johnson, editor of the Linux Journal.
Michael Johnston, President of Morse, Publishers of the Slackware
Professional 2.0 Linux CD Package.
Marc Ewing, Developer of the new Redhat Linux Distribution.
H. J. Lu, Coordinator of the Linux Developers Tools project.

The goal will be to have the "audience" contribute as much as possible.

So come out and meet many of the local and a few national Linuxers.  There
will be even be give aways and we'll invite some suppliers of Linux products
and tools, who will be at the show, such as the Linux Journal crew, to drop by.

You can get a complimentary exhibits pass by registering electronically by 
telnetting to: blenheim.com
and logging in as: unix94
choose your terminal mode (ansi or vt100)
and fill in the form. It did odd things when I registered, but seemed to work.

See you Tuesday.

Cheers,  Bob Young,   bob@acc-corp.com

The LDP archives at sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/LDP are official, as
are the HOWTO and faqs there. The Linux-faq is actually at ftp.cam-orl.co.uk
but sunsite mirrors that nightly.

>        Source/binaries for applications

Which application? X is at ftp.x.org, tex is probably somewhere at Stanford,
gcc is at prep (w/ binaries at tsx-11, mirrored to sunsite), etc. There
are thousands of applications, many of which aren't on sunsite or tsx-11.

>        Source/binaries for kernel development

Source is at ftp.funet.fi, mirrored to sunsite and probably to tsx-11
as well. No binaries should be considerd official - just officical parts
of the various distributions.

Depends on the developer.

Sunsite's has found some bugs in the OS it's now running. The problems
should be fixd by now, but more may crop up.

Sorry for all of this trouble, but uploading a network server that hands
out well over 6 gigabytes of info a day is bound to run into problems.

Is there a driver for a braille-box available? It is connected

ROTFL!
You can't delete it. The only way to remove is, you have to remove
your ram.
But believe it or not the 16M file don't use a bit of your disk-space.

You can get the binaries at sunsite, if memory serves. Look in /pub/X11/motif 
(or something like that). There will be two files, moxftp.tar.z and mftp.tar.z 
-- the second one is the binary, the first is the source.

Hip! I have exactly same problmes 1 and 2 without slip !!!!!!! Not the
problem 3.

I have a 66MHz 486 + 32MB RAM + 2GB disk + 2000 (!) user accounts in my 
Linux box.

Usually it works nice, but sometimes the whole net software seems to
do nothing with the new connections.  Login opens the window and
connects, but no "login:" prompt.  Same problems with smtp
connections, they jammmm similar way.  I think all telnet connections
hang somehow or are extremely slow.

In the begining I got "no more sockets" to the /usr/adm/messages.  I
doubled the socket tables in kernel.  It did actually not help,
expect I am not getting "no more sockets" into the /usr/adm/messages.

My laste experiment: I did delete smtp from inetd.conf and started to
run sendmail directly "standalone". I do not know if it helps. I have
not had problems after that, but the week is in the begining. :-(

: Additional information/trends noticed:
: If the lockup occurs, allowing the telnet session with the locked
: connection to sit while starting another is *always* successful. 

This is interesting. I have not noticed that.  Must check it next time
if I have same situation.
