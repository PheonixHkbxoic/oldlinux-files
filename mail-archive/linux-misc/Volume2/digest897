How about this:

When an svgalib program starts, it checks to see whether it has the
I/O permissions it needs.  If it doesn't, it exec's another program
which is suid root.  This program checks that the first program is
entitled to have direct access to the video system; if it is, it
adjusts the I/O permission bitmap accordingly, and then exec's the
first program (after setting its euid back to the proper value).  This
program does what it did last time--looks to see whether it has the
relevant I/O permissions.  This time, it does have, and starts
working.

This allows normal users not only to run svgalib programs, but to
write ones of their own.  The svgalib clients do not have to be
trusted.

Of course this will only work if I/O permissions are not reset by the
exec() calls.  I don't know whether this is the case or not--the only
thing I use for graphics is X...

The DLC is 486 instruction set compatible.  It has only a 1K cache.  It 
has the same pin-out as a 386DX, though.  Apparently, this means that it 
can't do anything a 486 does with those extra pins.  (The only thing I 
know of is burst mode, there could be more.)

A friend of mine claims to get about 486DX/33 performance from a DLC/40 w/ 
mathco.

They seem to have fallen off the face of the earth as everyone waved
goodbye.

Right after 1.0 came out, Peter (SLS guy) announced a new SLS - 1.05 I
think. People tried it and found:

1) Bugs that had become well known on the net were not fixed in the new
   version - not even simple things like permission problems.
2) Binaries were horibly out of date
3) A completely modular kernel was introduced. Neat hack, but Linus didn't
   like how it was implemented and decided not to use it in his kernel. This
   made SLS's changes a lot less appealing to people (fyi, Linus's objections
   were technical and well-founded)
4) SCSI wasn't supported properly in the modular kernel, and SLS was selling
   the fix for a lot of money.

Peter never has responded to email from me or many other folks, and we just
got sick of it. It's still on tsx-11 (and probably its mirrors) if you're
really interested in it, but Slackware is *much* better.

Remember that FTP is running two simultaneous sessions with the other host, 
a data channel and a control channel.  With only a standard two-wire modem,
the line must be repeatedly turned around from TX to RX and back again.
(Four wire, dedicated-line modems are pricey.)  Services like news and
the web have little upstream traffic, mostly downstream, since they
have no control channel.

We got LOTS of fluff, but no *one* set of it.  That is sort of the main 
difference.  You want standardized interfaces?  Not likely.  A vendor could
provide one -- most of them do.  But linux is a creature of the net, and there
will not be only one GUI interface.

I don't think this is too hard, and it is a good idea.

This is arleady avialable.  Try GREAT.  Really.  It takes a while to 
configure, and you should have Motif to get the best performance, but it has
lots of options.

Y'know, the browser from Ghostview is similar to this -- not as advanced,
though.  GREAT's file manager is similar, as well -- though not the

Again, GREAT -- along with what you can do with .xinitrc, can do this.  There
is also another program out there that does things like this.  Can't 
remember the name, but check them out as they show up. 

Much of your suggestions are really already available, and I don't see any
interest in somehow standardizing them.  Making such bells&whistles available
is one thing, making them ubiquitous is another.  Don't just assume that,
if it isn't in slackware, it's not available.

Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought that TeX was originally designed for
CS types and mathematicians.  For people in the vast majority of academic
disciplines it's not exactly ideal.  Like I mentioned before, it's very
irksome to me to have to preview to see my Arabic or Greek or Hebrew in
its native font.  I also prefer to be able to switch keyboard layouts on
the fly within my word processor app, so I can touch type in any language
I know how to do that in (just two :-(, but still you see what I mean).

This is not to say that LaTeX is a bad system.  It probably serves many
people's needs quite well.  I just don't think it's the system of the fu-
ture.

Subject: Linux installed from CD but now won't read it...
Date: 7 Oct 1994 10:15:04 -0400



Last night I was finally able to get Linux up and running from the August
Slackware CD (NEC SCSI CD_ROM drive connected to an SB16 SCSI-II).  I only 
installed the basics initially, and now I want to go back and install X, etc.
from the CD.  The only problem is, Linux has decided not to recognize the
CD-ROM drive any more.

The drive is recognized in the list of SCSI devices when linux starts up,
but when it tries to mount I get an error message that says "/dev/scd0 is
not a block device".  (/dev/scd0 is the device that seemed to work for the
initial install).  Attempts to mount it manually using "mount -t iso9660
/dev/scd0 /cdrom" return the same error.  There is a disk in the drive
when I start up.

Anyone know what could be happening here?


Also... how can I change the login prompt to something that doesn't say
"darkstar login:" ?

Wrong. All of the following packages have their own TrueType fonts for the  
specific language, most allow to write right -> left, up -> down or whatever.  
With Universe you can even mix as many languages on one page as you wish.

Logos - plug in for WinWord with special keboard drivers

Right Type - plug in for most Windows programs with TrueType and Bitmap fonts,  
incl. keyboard drivers

Glasnost Cyrillic Library

Switch - switches between cyrillic and latin with a hotkey incl. keyboard  
layout swapping

TurkishFontFactoty and EastEuropean FontFactory - like Switch

Kyrillica - despite the name also has fonts for almost every language in the  
world

Twinbridge Chinese Japanese Korean tools

Gamma Universe word processor for almost every language, incl. keyboard  
redefinition on the fly

The point is: you can do that under Windows easily (NT even easier in Unicode)  
as you just have to create TrueType (or Postscript if you want) fonts and  
intercept the keyboard driver with a suitable one or for more exotic languages  
with an input help like a selection pad (for Kanji etc). And most of the plug  
in's work with every Windows application that is coded properly (i.e. doesn't  
come with its own drivers).



Cheers,

Subject: Flame on the attitude of Linux towards GCC development
Date: Fri, 7 Oct 1994 06:39:33 GMT

I want to start a flame here. Please feel free to flame me as well.

Ever since the gnu c 2.6.0 compiler coming out, there are always some people
out there telling people that gcc 2.6.1 is coming out R.S.N., because
they know(yeah, I know you, you are an expert ?!?!), gcc 2.x.0 always
have bugs!!!, whenever some people
ask "could we get the new version for my linux version, PLEASE", and
no matter how sweet the plea may sounds. Because they just want to
WAIT until more bugs are fixed. 

But how could people fix those bugs? At least the gnu people? I think
mainly through people using and testing them. That's also how the
Linux itself is improving.  Linux is a big community,
lots of users are exposed to the Unixish world just through this
box. Linux kernel is built using the gnu compiler. How could we
act so selfish and just sit there and wait until somebody else fix the bugs?

Think about the scenario, when linus announced his first release of
linux and no body wanted to try that out? You know the answer,
don't you?

Oh, yeah, you could say, if you want to test them, you could always
go ahead and join the GCC channel, maybe you could get 
the more up to date code and compile and install it yourself. Oh, sure,
but some ordinally user may not have the necessary conditions to do
it, for example, lack of harddisk spaces, don't want to go through
lots of troubles(it is time consuming, you know that, GOD?)

So, please, stop sit back and wait, Start to support the gnu c development 
today. I know many of are experts(in real), if you could afford the time
and know more about things, why not help us update our compiler? Maybe
the compiler will become better faster? Don't you think? Give them more
credits. I don't think that they are dumb enough that they want to
release some bad product. We should be helping them to fix the bugs.
In fact, I have strong evidence that gcc2.6.0 is lot better than
gcc2.5.8, Also, gcc 2.6.0 is an official release.

I have just waited for so long and tired to hear about RSN.  I am also 
wondering the RSN is how soon?
Without many people using and testing them? These days, I chose not
to use my linux box, because it doesn't have an up to date
gcc compiler. I have some template class code which compiles perfectly 
well under gcc 2.6.0 but failed under gcc 2.5.8, I don't even have
the opportunity to become the bug reporter, you are not suppose
to report a bug in gcc 2.5.8 which doesn't occur in gcc 2.6.0 any more.

There are alwyas some kind soul offers to put the newer version in an
FTP site, please Don't say don't, OK! That's your personal opinion.

Your opinion?

Flame with me or flame me!!! It's a free world, isn't it?
