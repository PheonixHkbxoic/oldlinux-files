I have used FTAPE with Jumbo250 and Linux 1.1.18.  Seems to work fine, however
I have had so many other problems with 1.1.18 I have gone back to 1.0.9 with
UMS support built in (on sunsite and rsx-11).  When you download the Q disks
and the D disks, if you load the D disks last you will get 1.0.9.  If you
load the Q disks last you will get 1.1.18.  I had to reload getty from 1.0.8
to get it to work at all.  1.1.18 seems to have heartache if you try to compile
it without networking... It compiles if you leave the netwroking defaults in
the make config alone.  BTW, the instructions that talk about lodlinux are
not quite correct.  The sample does not have the rw option set which freaked
out my computer when I tried to boot from DOS.  I am planning to pick up the
source for FTAPE and recompile it for Linux 1.0.9.  Maybe 1.1.18 will work
fine for you, give it a try.  Note FTAPE will not run with Colorado
accelerator cards... just leave it hooked up to your floppy cable and you
should be alright.

There is no special message, it seems to link ok. But when I run that
version which I linked with "-g", it fails at XOpenDisplay as described.
(gdb showed me it seems to call strncpy(0x0, "esaster,8) and thus yielded
a sig11 segfault when trying to copy to the nullpointer.) 

"esaster" is part of my hostname "desaster".

Sounds like you could almost do it now by piping /dev/audio
through a pair of term sockets.  Throw in the lossy compression
code announced here recently, and you might almost have it!
Now you have the classic bootstrapping problem:  if someone
has enough of Linux running to get their sound card configured,

You can  access terrabyte drives under Linux, using the normal 
partitioning scheme.  With Remy's changes to ext2, you can 
even have 9 gigabyte partitions if you want.

Linux ignores the H/C/S fields in the partition tables, and only 
looks at the 32 bit flat addresses which don't have this problem.

If you look more closely, I think you'll find it's built by Best Data, and
it's called the ACE card. It's made w/ licensed Mwave technology rom IBM,
which I worked on for a while.

It's good technology, but writing a Linux driver will be non-trivial. I doubt
IBM will release the internal specs of the DSP code that you would need
to write a driver (the driver/dsp interface is medium level - lots of
work went into it). Even if you could, you'd have to write a complete real-time
preempting OS to reside on the card. No kidding. That's why if can do so
many things at once. If you're seriously interested in this, talk to
me via email, and I'll seee if I can convince IBM it's a good idea.

Look at the size of the drivers though (such as mcifax.dll). The code is pretty 
complicated, but that's what gives it such good performance.

That isn't really necessary, except if you try to stick with getty.

IMHO, too complicated ;-)
If you use uugetty, you don't have to run the modem in quiet mode, uugetty
supports "active" handling of the modem, that is, answering the RING
command or understanding any immediate CONNECT message.

There is a second package, again IMHO ;-) _very_ good, called mgetty+sendfax
by Gert Doering. It even supports incoming and outgoing faxes, but
you can disable it, if you don't have a fax modem.
