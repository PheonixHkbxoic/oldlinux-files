I compiled Nachos 3.2 when it first came out under linux.  The main thing
to do is remove all of the non-386 code from switch.s.  There are several
other changes, but didn't take me more than a couple of hours (much less
for someone who knows what he's doing)

Hi out there!

Does anybody know What fontformats are supported by XFree?
Started xconq yesterday, but ther server didn t find the correct fonts on  
the client(linux/XFree).
Xconfig:
"...
FontPath        "/usr/X386/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"
FontPath        "/usr/X386/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/"
FontPath        "/usr/X386/lib/X11/fonts/PEX/"
FontPath        "/usr/X386/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/"
FontPath        "/usr/X386/lib/X11/fonts/xconq/" 
...".
The upper directories contain fonts with the extention .pcf.
Added (...fonts/xconq/) are fonts with the extention .snf und .bdf.
Have I to convert them?
Any idea?

Yeah, I got this present from 1.1.45 as well. It's still broken in 1.1.49.
My dosemu doesn't (seem to) even make it to vid init. It causes a
segmentation violation right off the starting line. Perhaps the lads @
dosemu.devel and kernel.devel should introduce themselves :-)

This is definitely a problem, though, and I for one would at least like some
advice on where to start poking.

It is my understanding that the 1542CF fixed/cured some of the

has been quite reliable and has not exhibited any of the fussyness
problems I've heard about regarding the first 1542C controllers.

However, as Rob Janseen pointed out, you do need to be sure you have

most SCSI host adapters anyways.

 I am using a gree motherboard on mine and have had zero problems that
 were from Linux. The only problem resulted from the use of very old
 (and slow) 80 meg drives. LILO would boot and if I selected my dos
 partition on hdb, it would not spin up fast enough and sometimes would
 screw up. If I just let hda spin up, it would run Linux no problem.
 Even with spindowns. I have since replaced A with a new segate and now
 the DOS partition will not boot at all, it doesnt seem to spin up fast
 enough for the system. Drives me crazy. Its an excuse for new drives I
 guess. :)

This is an interesting point.

From what I've seen Linux develop into - one area in which it differs 
radically from other Uni*es is in the way binary distributions of 
packages have proliferated.

Unlike most systems, we seem quite happy to taken binaries from other 
peoples systems and use them on ours - I'm a case in point. As the 
producer of the binary distribution of sendmail-8.6.9, there are now X 
systems out there running AS ROOT a binary that someone else compiled - 
how do they know I can be trusted ;-)

Frankly, this is why DOS viruses have spread so fast. Under DOS, hardly 
anyone had a compiler and/or experience on their systems to compile their 
own source-code of their favourite game/etc, so they took binaries 
instead. Here we are - all with access to a great compiler - but we would 
rather drop the hassle of compilation and use someone elses work.

With other Uni*es, they have usually been owned by companies/universities 
who have MONEY - and therefore had heaps of disk/resources to spare - so 
it's quite practical to compile all your own stuff. Try compiling 
XFree-2.2.1 on a 120Mb HDD :-) It just isn't practical to compile 
everything yourself on such "boutique" systems as most of us own.

Me, I'm happy to accept the risk, as we have seen with the likes of wuftp 
- you can't even trust source code these days...

Subject: Linux is a GNU system and the DWARF support
Date: 5 Sep 1994 22:04:13 GMT

I don't know if that is necessary. Since I started with Linux several
years ago, I always had a feeling that the FSF didn't really like Linux
very much. They wanted hurd instead. It looks like there was some
misunderstanding, at least on my part.

From what I see, Linux uses all the GNU packages, except for the kernel
but which is also covered by GNU GPL. Although there are almost no
GNU packages for the system administration stuff, the Linux system still
looks/feels pretty much like a GNU system. But somehow I felt the FSF
didn't want to have anything to do with Linux.

Today after I talked with RMS on the phone, I learned that the GNU project
is preparing for a Linux/GNU distribution based on the Debian distribution,
which is due in a few weeks. I think noone should call GNU is a vaporware
now since the Linux/GNU system is running on x86. I was told if Linux had
came along be fore hurd was started Linux would have been used as the GNU
kernel. Now since hurd is well on the way, it should not be aborted. It looks
like porting Linux to other platforms may pick up some steams as well as the
work on the Linux kernel. I am glad to see it finnally happen.

Also Linux/GNU is moving toward the ELF binary format. But the DWARF support
in gcc 2.x is still not there yet, especially C++. RMS likes to see anyone
can spend time on the DWARF support in gcc 2.x and do it right. If you
are interested, please send email to rms@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu. For the time
being, we may use stabs-in-ELF.

I have created a class XPlayer:Player which does try to open a window.
It uses XOpenDisplay( display_name ) for this, and segfaults. It seems
to try copying "esaster", which his part of my hostname "desaster" to a 
nullpointer. How can this happen? It only happens when I compiled it with
debug-flag: "-g". If I compile it with "-O2 -m486" optimizionflags instead,
it works?

Is this a bug in gcc 2.5.8 ?

Here is the code:

#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <X11/Xutil.h>

XPlayer::XPlayer(char *display_name, char *name, FigureClass *f) 
: Player(name, f) 
{
        // the following correctly outputs:
        // creating "player1" on display "unix:0.0"

        cout << "creating \"" << name << "\" on display \"" << display_name 
        <<"\"\n";
       // now I try to open the display.
        // At this point I get a sig11, Segmentation fault
        // trying to use function strncpy(s1=0x0, s2="esaster", n=8)
        // copying part of my hostname "desaster" into a Nullpointer...

  dpy = XOpenDisplay( display_name ); 
}


main() {

        char *display_name = "unix:0.0";

...
        
        XPlayer p(display_name, "player 1", f);

I know that there is a software named "Peek & Spy" from Networking

but then was adapted for Unix, Software makes a spy over any tty,

You seem to ignore the fact that the performance of a Linux box does not
depend exclusively on the cpu speed. The hard disk performance is also
essential, and here the 486 box is at a clear advantage. The extra disk
space is a bonus, too. 

So, it's not going to be an easy choice :-)
