The SunOS lpd displays exactly the same behavior, as does every other lpd
I have come across, and in a way it is perfectly logical:

        A comment line ought to be ignored wherever it appears,

BUT, a continuation line is not a a separate line, as far as lpd is concerned,
and the "printcap" format does not provide for comments within an entry.

A workaround which can be used for real comments (but not for "commenting out"
portions of an entry containing colons) is to simply surround your comment
with colons, it is then a superfluous field which is simply ignored by lpd.
We use this here to include a note about where a printer is physically located.

lpd is not the only utility which exhibits this behavior, btw; I have come
across versions of "make" which don't like comment lines, say, in the middle
of a macro definition which stretches over multiple lines. I don't know 
whether this is true of all makes, but it wouldn't surprise me.

Hello,

I could really use some help on the following:

1)  Does Linux support the Pentium?
2)  Does Linux support 32 | 64 bit Video (PCI)?
3)  Would an SCSI HD make life better?
4)  How does one get Linux + a GUI (X Windows / Motiff) + a C++ compiler
    and other utils?
5)  Are there any major brand hardware peices I need to watch out for?
6)  Or, is there a list (are there lists) of Linux / Xfree86 / C++ 
    compatibility and availability w/respect to Pentium / PCI Video. 
    I'd LOVE to know.

I really need to buy a machine and get Unix (Linux) running ASAP.  I do 
some DOS programming so I'd like to go with the Pentium and whatnot, but
perhaps not...  From what I've gathered, I need to watch what I buy if I
go with Linux.

Help would be very greatly appreciated.  My other option is to just buy
the SCO Unix (spelled $$$).  I'd like to avoid that.

Thanks,

DT

Get SWI-Prolog from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/devel/prolog. It's compied
fine on Linux since 0.96c+. Gosh I miss those version numbers!

Hardcoded paths are annoying WHEN ABUSED.  I can't stand packages that
rely on more than a handful of hardcoded paths.  My favorite applications
have a single hardcoded pathname that points to a configuration file
(usually in /etc), and the configuration file can either provide or
override the other pathnames.  Good examples: sendmail, Taylor UUCP,
ld.so (for eliminating hardcoded shared library paths), SAMBA, inetd,
named, lilo.  Bad examples: inn, nn, and many, many others.

Frankly, I don't WANT my programs looking at argv[0] for paths!
argv[0] can be ANYTHING.  It is only a UNIX convention that argv[0]
contains the name of the executable.

What about setuid programs?  Should they inspect argv[0] to see where
their configuration and library files are?  Do you see what a gaping hole
this is?

UX:(./script) ERROR:Bad substitution

If I use basename instead:

        #!/bin/sh
        cat `dirname $0`/notes

then it works.

However, if I put this script in a directory that is in my PATH,
and run it from a different directory, no it does NOT find
the notes file.  Also, if I point a symlink at it, or even a hardlink,
and run it from a different directory, it does not find the notes file.

I think the above is a horrid example of shell script.

Noooo!!!!  NOO!!!!!!

I disagree.  There's got to be something wrong in a rom on the 1542C, at least
the one I have.  I have a 760 meg hard drive, a Chinon 435 cdrom, and a 525
meg Viper tape on mine, and have had an incurable problem with reading from
the chinon.  Any other activity that comes to the scsi bus during reading from
the Chinon has good (but not 100%) odds of hanging the scsi so hard I have to
remove power to make it start to function again.

I took Adaptec's advice and set the controller to disallow stops on the
chinon, and I even cobbled my 1542 driver in the kernel to only allow 1
mailbox, as suggested by the howto files (which agree that this is not a rare
occurrence).  These two both helped some, but the problem still occurs on such
a regular basis that I can't get some files off my cdroms at all.

Under msdos, this is less common on the same machine (Chinon and adaptec
themselves supplied drivers there) but it still occurs.

I suspect Adaptec has some kind of assumption about timing coded into the rom
on this board and the Chinon is exceeding what somebody thought was the
longest time you'd ever have to wait for a response.

Date: 7 Sep 1994 15:14:03 GMT


I'am looking for some Linux admins which have experiences in installing
and managing a small (private) local network.

This is my equipment:
i486/33 20Mb, i386/25 4Mb, 2 HD (340Mb, 120Mb), 5 1/4 + 3 1/2'' floppies,
2 multisync Monitors, 2 VGA cards, 2 seriell cards, 2 mices, 2 keyboards,
a printer.
I will buy 2 Ethernet cards etc.

These are my goals: Running the i486 as an NFS server and let the
other one boot diskless via NFS (if possible, otherwise boot the kernel
by diskette). Having two X Terminals with WINE emulator running
MS-Windows (argh..). One of the two should work as a spooler/print
server.

Now my questions: Is this possible? Has anyone done this? What do I have
to buy additionaly? What should I buy? And:
        WHERE can I find DOCUMENTATION for that?

I'am happy about any help!

Send email!
Thanx for all, Joerg

Date: Wed, 7 Sep 1994 14:16:22 +0000

Hi,
 I have been playing recently with some 'Artificial Life' books and software,
 notably Rudy Rucker's Artificial Life Lab (Waite Group Press) and Boppers
 program. (Highly recommended). In the book Rucker refers to Tom Ray's
 'tierra', which I have downloaded and am trying to get running under Linux.
 (anon ftp: tierra.slhs.udel.edu:/tierra/tierra.tar.Z)

 Basically, it compiles with a few minor tweaks (Linux and GCC grumbles),
 and seems to run OK. There is an X windows view on the process ('ov'),
 which I cannot get to run. It is supposed to connect via a socket to the
 main 'tierra' program, but it hangs in connect(). It all works a treat
 on the Sun at work, but that's not much help.

 Has anyone successfully ported 'tierra' and friends to Linux? If so, what
 did you do?

Regards
Neil

I am not an expert, but I don't think this is a bug.  If you access the hard
drive, the disk buffers are stored in free ram.  When the program terminates,
if there is still some free memory, it makes sense to mark the previously used
memory as 'buffers', and use some more of the totally free memory.  That way,
if you try to access the hard drive again in the same place as you did before,
the stuff is already in a buffer. 

If the kernel had 'freed up' the memory, this info would no longer be 
available.  So, there is no reason to free up this memory to the general
pool unless it is needed at the moment.  For this reason, if you use your
computer for a long period of time, all of the memory will be used after
a while (for buffers) and there will remain basically no free memory.
This makes perfect sense.  Otherwise, you are completely wasting your
precious memory.

I don't think you have any reason to worry.

Subject: Best use of 2 PCs for Linux/X
Date: Wed, 7 Sep 1994 15:14:55 GMT

I have a 386/DX-40 (ISA-bus, 8Mb) and am thinking of getting bigger PC,
(say 486/DX2-66, >=16Mb).  I'm running Linux/X11.  I have about 1Gb of ESDI
disk, probably move to SCSI in the future.
This is for S/W development, mail and general fooling around.
I also have some diskless PCs that need a disk server.

(Actually I'm trying to justify an accelerated ISA video card. VL or PCI
would mean buying a new mother board)


I can think of 3 possibilities:

1) Junk the 386 and put everything on the 486, (but I'd like to move the
disks to the cool quiet basement).

2) Put the disks on the 386 for a NFS server and use the 486 as a compute
and X server.

3) Put the disks on the 486, use it as a disk and compute server and make
the 386 a Xserver (essentially a X-terminal).

Option 3 makes sense to me as it keeps the disk in the compute server.
Also, the kids can play MSDOS games on it without interfering with the
server.

The 386 is maxed out at 8Mb (and I don't want to buy any more obsolete 30pin
simms).  It looks to me that 8Mb is ok for a X-server. 
IBM Xstations (140 and 150) come with 4Mb and 8Mb.
I think a disk-server could use all the memory it can get.


Some questions:

I assume X traffic would be less of a load on the net than NFS: TRUE of FALSE?
(X-terminals seems to work, and Linux-NFS seems slow at the current time).
I've tried a simple test (doing a ls -lR on a NFS mounted disk (on HPUX)
and doing the same from a xterm on the disk-server with display on my W/S)
and the xterm won the race.

Assuming a accelerated card (ATI Graphics Xpression looks good, once XFree 
supports it; any other suggestions?), what about performance?
From looking at X-bench numbers, performance is mostly independent of the type
of BUS (ISA/VL/PCI).  What about the impact of processor speed (the xbench
survey lists few 386 boxs)?

If I did want to use an ISA video card in a machine with >=16Mb it would
mean I couldn't use the linear frame buffer.  Does this matter a whole lot?

What is a good networking card (NE2000 clone)?  Does it really matter?
