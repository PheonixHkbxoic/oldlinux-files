It SHOULD be pronounced "linooks".  You know.  Unix backwards.

Or maybe I should say Unix is Linux backwards.

        Least bugs is a relative thing.
        
        If you want to go by reported bugs, then it difficult 
        to give a clear answer.   As is know in the industry,
        what maybe a bug to one person is a bug to another.
        And as "bugs" go, system stability is a far more important
        factor.
        
        To that I would say that if test suites were available,
        (and maybe GNU would do this) then perhaps a go measure
        for persons, like yourself could be achieved.   To this
        question of "stability", at this time I would say - 
        Go with Linux.... else if you can wait for the release
        (mailing) of 386bsd release 1.0.

: 2) more software available that runs on it
:
        By your comment, I guess you would want the broadest
        assorment of software to run on you platform.
        Linux wins hands down.  However, most Linux applications
        fall under *copyleft* legal issues.  So, if you plan
        to make (or use) your code in a commercial manner,
        you may want to investigate that issue with the poeple
        at Linux, as they have the best answers.

: 3) faster
:
        Again, no benchmarks (or stats) are available for
        any of the above.  Numbers generated depend heavily 
        on equipment used and application (program) design.

: 4) more compliance to POSIX (I think standards are good, or am I wrong)
:
        POSIX is an arguement in itself.
        POSIX is a good start for internationalization, but
        many commercial vendors have found their own twist 
        on this issue.   For the "free" UNIX people POSIX is
        a nice buzz word, but NO ONE can even remotely (IMHO)
        suggest compliance with POSIX.

: 5) more people using it.
:
        No valid numbers are available, but if the "newsgroups"
        are any indicator I would say LINUX.

: 6) more support for third-party hardware (VLB, EISA, modems, etc) IMPORTANT!
:
        LINUX, definitely!... they certainly have more screwy 
        peripherials in operation than any of the other UNIX variants.(sp?)

        However, I must, at this time say, this IS NOT a good thing.
        IBM PC machines have a real problem with off-shore vendors
        doing screwy things.  Ask any software house about this
        boxes and you'll get to answers 

        1) get money.
        2) too many variations on a single topic (i.e. CD-ROM)

: 7) platform for programming.
:
        Linux, at this time, has the serious lead in documentation.
        By my book, even the best tricks are just that, if you
        dont' know how to use them.

: that the other OS is better.  Has anyone actually used both systems?
:
        I'm running the FreeBSD and 386BSD versions in house.
        I run both, because I'm still waiting for 386bsd release 1.0
        Since I need to do X-windows development and TCP/IP  testing
        at this time FreeBSD is of choice.

        Is one system better than the other?

        FreeBSD is better only in terms of getting the latest
        versions of applications to run on it.  In other words,
        if I want the latest version of Mosaic to run in house,
        I am forced to used FreeBSD because the latest version
        of X-windows no longer supports 386bsd release 0.1.

I'm very pleased with my ASUS SP3G 1.6 ($259) with an onboard NCR 53c810
SCSI controller.  I chose an Intel DX2-66 ($264), 32Mb of 70-nsec memory 
($34 per meg), an extra 53c810 card ($80), and a #9GXE64 ($249).  With 
lilo, I can boot Linux 1.1.51, Windows NT 3.5 RC1, or DOS (for games).
Only WNT can use both 53c810 controllers at the same time, but I don't 
really need the second one.

If you decide on the ASUS board, insist on Version 1.7 or later, And  you 
should get a lower price on the DX2-66 by this time.

IMHO Linux is great when networking... There was an article in LJ about
Linux becoming a standard terminal on the Info Highways : Mosaic & news
readers are the killer apps that can make people trash their MS* partition
and jump in the Linux train. So, I think you should reconsider omiting the
networking part in your distribution.

What about a first disk set dedicated to the installation part : basic system,
X-Window, tunings. Then your DOS-Win dummy could choose to load a pack of
X apps and/or a complete programming environnement (emacs or ez & gcc + all
related utilities), and/or an Internet config with PPP, Mosaic, mail & news
readers. All should be preconfigured for a single system.

To impress your DOS-Win dummy, X with a few toy applications won't be enough.
It would be better to insist on the weak side of MS-* thus presenting net
apps (add some cool WWW pages, a few messages in the /spool/news directory)
or showing the compiler working while your editing part of a program (that is
true multitasking without MS-Crashes(tm)).

This was my 2 cents advice.

There are to files 'english.au' and 'swedish.au' to hear the exact

I found them on the Infomagic 2CD set, but they must be on sunsite or tsx.

Otherwise, you are violating their policy.

There seems to be quite a bit of talk about the ASUS motherboards.
One dealer in biz.comp.hardware has it for $275 with SCSI, IDE, etc.
The only drawback for me is that it has no 30 pin memory sockets, and
I have a bunch of 30 pin SIMMs.  The other factoid I've seen is that
PCI and VLB don't mix well.  Read comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware.chips,
there is quite a bit of Linux motherboard discussion there.

"The LaTeX Companion" by Goosens, Mittlebach, and Samarin.

Further to the CD-ROM with Slackware stuck on the front of 
the UK version of PC Plus, I read an article in Sept 29 
"The Guardian" a reasonably popular paper (traditionally left 
of centre), entitled "Freedom Fighter" with a big photo of 
Linus Torvalds.  A generally positive, and reasonably accurate 
appraisal -- but I suspect the free and permanent aspect of the 
software may appeal to a cooperative political spirit.  Plenty 
of mention/credit also given to FSF in the article.

Linux, is I think, making its mark in the UK as something rather 
unique and interesting and I hope we'll see more articles like 
this in the press.

BTW, no DOS slagging here (which is a relief), in fact the 
author (Godfrey Nolan) admits linux/X not as easy to set up as 
MSDOS/Windows.  I thought it was a good article, really.

I'm having trouble getting my slackware pro 2.0 release of LINUX/X to recognize
my Logitech P7-3F busmouse.  I've tried configuring two new kernels of Linux:
one with Logitech and one with Microsoft bus mice and the former does get me
into X without error but the pointer doesn't move with mouse movement.  I did
change the symbolic link of /dev/mouse to /dev/busmouselogitec with the first
kernel and have tried both that one and /dev/busmousems with the Microsoft
kernel.  Anything with "busmousems" fails to find the mouse at all.

Is there a quick way of determining that my mouse is configured properly for
linux without going into X?
