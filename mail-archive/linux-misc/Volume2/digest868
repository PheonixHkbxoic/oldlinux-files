Hello!

Could someone please help a future Linux-er:

My machine (at the moment running dos) has two harddrives (170 and 130). I want
to convert my second drive into a Linux partition. Is it still possible to run
dos of drive 1 or do I have to swap drive so that Linux is always the booting
partition?

Could you please e-mail me 'cos it takes ages to download the WHOLE newsgroup.

Yep.  I run FreeBSD now, because it's more familiar to me.  Also, I have
heard from people I trust, who run Linux, that the BSD networking code is
more reliable than Linux.

I run FreeBSD because it's familiar, having worked with SunOS for many
years.  Both Linux and Net/FreeBSD are impressive.  The only reliability
problem I've had since the FreeBSD 1.1 release is from my VGA card over-
heating, which is unrelated to the software (since it does it under OS/2
and MS-Windows also).

As far as applications and hardware support, look around, see if they run
what you want/have/need, and if so, you're probably makeing a safe choice.
A word of caution, though: if you're seriou, get a CD-ROM drive supported
by your system of choice and buy the OS on CD-ROM.  It'll save you a ton
of work.  I know, I've done it the hard way several times: NetBSD 0.9,
Linux, and FreeBSD 1.0 all ftp'd to work and loaded onto floppies.  When
FreeBSD 1.1 was released, I broke down and bought a $40 network card, 
which made it somewhat less painful.  I'm going to buy a cd-rom when 2.0
comes out later this month.  ;^)

If you have enough disk space, or can buy another disk, get both and decide
for yourself.  I have two disks, 340M and 424M, on my machine, running
DOS+Win, OS/2, and FreeBSD all.

And what about those of us that DON'T see it?  Basic setup is a
dedicated PPP link on a 14.4 dialup, NET-3 stuff, ppd 2.1.2a,
etc., with an InfoMagic/TransAmeritech CD-ROM combined install.

I move many megabytes of files around via FTP daily, and another
many megs around with mosaic and lynx.  Sendmail+IDA's been
rock-solid.

The AMPR code is still beta-stuff, I think.  Do you really need it?
Also, are your users using ncftp or 'stock' ftp?  Aside from the X25
stuff in your kernel, and the fact your dialin users are seeing/causing
this, there probably isn't much difference in the way we do things.
I have no dialup users.  So, if that's any help, there might be 
something in the way your getty handles buffering (if there is
such as thing); I use agetty.

That's because we're using a special Mach64 server that's not a part

Yggdrasil users,

I'm stuck with a few questions:

-       Is there a solution to the above described problem?
-       Why is it that the fall 1993 CD was allright as far as I knew,
        the summer 1994 gave me a lot of problems right away and this one won't 
        install simple packages in Xwindows?
-       Is this really plug & play? Is it my fault? Am I doing things
        wrong? Did they test it?
-       Last but not least, are there any other CDROM's that say
        they are plug & play. I might get me one.

        Regards,
        Jan Willems.

Having worked with both of them, the obvious solution to the Yggdrasil 
problems is to junk the CD and buy the Slackware PRO CD. While the Yggdrasil
CD-ROM shows a lot of promise, it is far behind the Slackware distribution
in terms of "Plug and Play".

I've installed Slackware distributions many times over the last year and never
failed to have a running system. After 5 or 6 shots at installing a CD-ROM less
Yggdrasil system (and yes, I read the fall 94 errata sheet), I've yet to 
be able to pull the CD-ROM out without working laboriously through the file
system deleting symbolic links to it. That sucks.

Yggdrasil is cute if you only want to burn 10MB of hard disk space and don't
mind a _slow_ system running from CD-ROM. Past that, its a mess. One example: 
after following the errata instructions carefully, and installing as much
of the system as I could on my hard drive, I then attempted to create a 
user account via the control panel. The result? "/usr/bin/usermaint: not
found" or somesuch. Cute.

CD-ROM distributions, given their read-only nature, _must_ have careful
preparation since you only have one shot at doing it right. Yggdrasil's Fall 
94 CD-ROM shows all signs of being rushed out and poorly tested. I can't 
believe that anyone ever even attempted a CDROM-less installation (the only
sane option) before they cut this thing.  

Spend your money on Slackware and you'll be glad you did.

I have found the root cause of the  problem.  It is a call to sock_wmalloc
that keeps eating memory.  It eventually goes over the 32767 (in skbuff.h in
the linux includes).  It tends to return EAGAIN, assuming memory would be
made available eventually, which results in silent failure.  since ping,
and other utilities use different sockets, they start allocating at 0.
I can't even overallow, since it only goes to 65535 (although it is a long,
it fails at this point).

Perhaps it is not the "root" cause, since it may be the free that is failing,
or merely a fragmentation problem.  But it only seems to affect TCP based
protocols with PPP.

I hope someone knowledgeable can fix this.

I've used Magic and IRSIM, but neither is a VHDL tool.  Magic is a
simple but very easy to use layout editor.  It does on-the-fly DRC (it
uses the one variable, lambda method) and some autorouting.  I've
actually used it to produce a simple stack cpu.  It's pretty fast and
comes with a nice tutorial, but best of all is its low price - free.

IRSIM is a timing tool, a pretty simple one compared with commercial
ones, (like pearl - the only one I'm actually familiar with).  But it
works well with Magic - it does timing on the actual layout.  It can
do things like longest phase to phase delay, etc.

Anyway, you can get Linux binaries of these two from 
sunsite.unc.edu in

magic63p3-src.tar.gz     VLSI graphical layout tool [src]

Magic requires X obviously.  These tools are great for learning how to
do VLSI CMOS design/layout.  I suspect they're mostly used by
university students.
