The driver for Spea Media FX and other Ensoniq SoundScape based cards is
under construction.  Some kind of (ALPHA) driver should be available
within a month or two. Announcements will be sent to the SOUND channel.
To join send a message to linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi. Include
just a line containing "X-Mn-Admin: join SOUND" to the message.

But you should be careful not to use a long keyboard cable!  I have seen

Hi,


yesterday I tried to compile one of my FORTRAN programs with the
f2c translator using the -g option, but the f77 script which is 
from the Slackware 2.0 package f2c.tgz complains about a missing

The f2c.tgz package contains only a shared library and libf2c.sa.

I tried to find the sources for this particular f2c version, but
I did not find any sources for libf2c.a


Any hints ?

If anyone figures out the codes for (numpad) end and pgdn, let me
know.

I am very adjusted to using those keys to strafe, and can't seem to
play any other way.

BTW The unregistered WAD runs great in 320x200, but pixel doubling

I have dip running on a linux system.   I would like to use SLIP over
a modem configured for dialback.   Here is what I would like to see:

        local  - start dip up and make the call
        remote - ring ring; answers and asks for username, password, and
                 access code; then hangs up
        local  - wait for the call
        remote - call me back and prompt for username and password
        local  - pick up the phone and give appropriate username and password
        remote - respond with terminal server prompt
        local  - select slip and away we go !

Here is what is happening:      

        local  - start dip up and make the call
        remote - ring ring; answers and asks for username, password, and
                 access code; then hangs up
        local  - EXIT DIP WITH ERROR
        remote - call me back

Does anyone have a sample dip configuration file that will do what I want ?

     Once again, a new version has been posted to sunsite which
fixes the problem.  So problem is moot anyway.  (Fixes it for -2 and
-3 anyway).  In anycase it's pretty silly to run the doubling or
tripling modes because this really mauls performance.  It's so much
easier to use the cntrl-alt-+ hot key to switch it (the X server)to
a more appropriate video mode.  People have been posting Xconfig info
for various low rez modes.  

   Has anyone got music going?  I'm running it on my 1.1.33 kernel
on a 486/66 with 16M ram.  I've got the 2.9 sound driver and a pro
audio spectrum 16.  Otherwise everything works great...smooth motion
and good effects sound.  But no music.  I don't know whether it's 
supposed to work or not.

Later...

You can't just copy your DOS Doom default.cfg to your Linux
.doomrc.  There are different options in the Linux .doomrc and
the keycodes are completely different.

At least for ASCII-character keys, you can just put the ASCII
code for the character generated by the key as the code for the
key in your .doomrc.  I haven't figured out how the
shift/control/function keycodes work yet.

"Reasonable" is a relative term which everyone must interpret for their
situation.

We purchased WordPerfect (SCO Unix version5.1) from WordPerfect for $99 U.S.
dollars earlier this year. This is a single-user license and the price is
based upon already owning version 5.1 for other platforms. This appears a
most reasonable price.

Just to clarify: I did not joke about the performance on my 386. It seems
that there are quite some differences in performance between systems that
should be comparable at first sight. Maybe this has got to do with the 
amount of support that XFree has for a particular chipset? Anyway, LinuxDOOM
is fast becoming a very popular benchmark now ... ;-)

Hi all,

        I posted last week an article dealing with laptop and notebook
compatibilities with LINUX. Thanks to all persons who gave me a response.

        Now, I would like to buy a precise system. (I give the configuration below). It is a notebook. I would like to make sure it 
will be compatible with LINUX. Have you got an idea about it ??? Any
suggestion is welcome.

        ---------------------------------------------
        CPU             : Intel 486 DX2 50      (OK)
        FPU             : Integre
        Architecture BUS: ISA
        RAM             : 8 Mb
        Motherboard     : Compal                (???)
        BIOS            : Evergreen             (???)
        Controllers     : Winbound W8376        (???)
        (floppy,hard disk)
        Harddrive       : IDE Seagate (405 Mb)  (???)
        Video cards     : Chips Technology VGA  (???)
        Monitor         : ecran LCD, STN 
                          (Max 1024 * 768)
        ----------------------------------------------

Can I buy it without problem ? 

        Thanks in advance,

                        Florence.
