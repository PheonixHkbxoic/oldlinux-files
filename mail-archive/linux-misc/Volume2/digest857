Date: 28 Sep 1994 20:32:52 -0000

Just read the latest PC Week and found that they mentioned Linux in a 
short article about 32-bit OS's. It was one of 2 "options of particular 
interest" for UNIX OS's (the other was AIX 4.1). I was favorably 
impressed by the following quote:

"Linux, meanwhile, is a UNIX-compatible system with freely available 
source code, high stability, and growing commercial support."

I especially like the mention of high stability. Maybe this will satisfy 
the "it's not ready for prime time" naysayers; then again, probably not.

Date: 1 Oct 1994 09:36:26 -0400

Hi. I'm relatively new to Linux, and to unix in general, having used DOS
basically all my life. My suggestion is this: Do all the stuff you're
talking about, about single user mode and scripts to emulate dos
commands, etc., because it will provide a familiar atmosphere. But also
make it incredibly easy to, layer by layer, strip away the crippledness.
TeX, for example, is a tremendously powerful and complex thing, but it's
not difficult to begin using it to produce attractive documents. The key
to this whole debate is transition. Obviously no one wants to see millions
of DOS users stuck with a shitty distribution of Linux. Unfortunately it
is quite possible that this new distribution may actually become a
standard for many people, unless active steps are taken to encourage
them in and inform them about unix's greater power and versatility. The
only way I can see to do this is to give them a complete distribution,
in which many of the features and commands are simply turned off,
waiting for a very simple procedure to make them active.

So give them the DOS interface they know so well, and the single user
mode, and all the rest of the nightmare. And underneath it all, give
them LINUX!

I would imagine the higher price for maple is due to unix being a
multi-user platform. Windows is for one person, however on a unix
implementation of a program (unless it is otherwise restricted, and 
I dont think maple is) then that program is available to alot of
people.

(only a guess :) )

[stuff deleted]

Is this post for real? It is not the 'sacred cows' of Unix you are 
sacrificing, it is essential functionality. If all you want to accomplish is 
to make Linux look like DOS/Windows, why bother? Why not just install the real 
thing instead?

What you are suggesting here sounds about as ridiculuous as a car dealer 
would, who would try to sell cars cut in half lengthwise to appeal to those 
'motorcycle dummies' out there. Unix (or Linux) is *NOT* DOS/Windows, nor was 
it ever meant to be; the very reason why one would want to run UNIX is to have 
networking, multiuser capabilities, etc... the very stuff you are trying to 
take away.

Ah, why do I bother? This posting was probably flame-bait anyways.

        No, the main problem is that the FSF appears to interpret the
word "dependent" in a fashion which appears incompatible with U.S.
Copyright law and current precedents (few though those are).  Applying
the generally-accepted Copyright law definitions of critical words and
phrases, such as "derived from" and following the precise wording of
GPL2, the allegedly "gmp" dependent code in the standard example is
not legally gmp dependent (unless you apply an interface copyright);
and in the grey areas, the separate distribution is potentially
significant, too.

Yes, a manual for the library (not about the builder) is available as
an ordinary book. I saw it in several bookstores. It seemed to be
identical to the OI-lib-manual that you get when you buy an OI license.
Title is 'OI Programmer's Guide' or similar.

Subject: Re: New Linux Distribution
Date: 29 Sep 1994 06:00:04 -0400

Thank you for the suggestions so far. I am serioulsy considering making
this WIT distribution. But my intention, as I said, is that this will be
a trial (transitional?) distribution, not a final one, so upgradeability
to a major distribution (Slackware) is a main concern. I take S. Lee's
idea of using UMSDOS and packaging it as LINUX.ZIP (WIT.ZIP). I changed
my mind on the SCSI issue. In general, given the lack of drivers, ( a la
 *.SYS *.DRV in Dos-Win) in the Linux kernel and the difficulty of setting
up Xconfig in a generic way, maybe the only solution will be to provide
several different precompiled kernels and X servers/Xconfig's and ask the
user some questions about their hardware in order to automatically choose
the right configuration. So, I think I'll follow the example of the 
existing distributions with their multiple kernels.

I did not change my mind about keeping the distribution tiny, stripping 
many Unix utilities. Even if the distribution looks similar to WinDos it
won't be. Even with only enough utilities to match Microsoft's ones users
will have the following advantages:

        - Nonpropietary formats in data files. I started hating Microsoft
products the first time I wanted to edit the data I stored using CARDFILE.EXE

        - Upgradeability for FREE

        - Powerful shell scripting. I do not want to prevent users to use it,
I just want to make it easier for them. One of the points of the .BAT->.sh
translator is that users will be able to look at the .sh output and learn
the basic .sh commands that way. And it seems so easy to make!

        - Reliable I/O redirection and pipes. Not even OS/2 does that 
properly.

        - Coherent integration of windows and shells. How frustrating is to
try to open or close a Windows program from the command line.

        - No stupid limits on resources or size of files to edit. Reliable
crash protection. No stupid limits on command lines. Reliable virtual memory.
32bit disk and memory access without hassles and in general a much better
handling of the (supported) hardware.

        - Powerful automation of tasks via batch and cron. For example, running
updatedb every night beats the fastest DosWin file finder by orders of 
magnitude.

        - Freedom from the 8.3 constraint.

        - Consistent mouse selection with and WITHOUT windowing system.

        - Multiple virtual consoles (I never thought of not having them, Erik)

        - Multiple users. OK, I changed my mind on this one, mainly because
I realized that accounts make it easy to have different background bitmaps
for different moods :-) I really don't buy the claim that having root 
access is dangerous since DosWin users have root access all the time. It's
not that bad, it just demystifies the unix sysadmin work.

So, my WIT distribution, as I see it now, will consist of:

        - Dos-like and Windows-like utilities
        - Grep, awk, sed, bash
        - Slip client and Mosaic
        - Dosemu and ( later ) Wine
        - Ghostscript

Maybe I will include perl, tcl and tk (or tkperl) so that I can write
a few frontends to some common tasks (like zipping/unzipping)

I haven't decided yet about the applets that I'll include, so I am open to
more suggestions. I don't have a complete list of Windows equivalents, so
please help me with that. I feel there is a need to have a distribution like
the Windows Introductory Trial distribution I am proposing. Repartitioning and
filling 50M of your disk is just too much to try Linux. And the problem with
installing just the "a" series of Slackware is that you get a lot of utilities
that you will never use while others (like Xfm and dosemu) are missing. 
So thanks to all of you who made suggestions. I'd like to have more.

Digiboard will be releasing a Linux driver (1.1.50 kernel) for their PC/Xe

probably don't want to run 16 ports without using an intelligent I/O

being advertised in Linux Journal. The driver is on sunsite in pub/Linux
/kernel/misc, I think, with the name cyclad*. I believe they have an 8-port
and 16-port version, and they are co-processed boards.
