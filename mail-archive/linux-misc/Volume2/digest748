Subject: Need beta testers: sasteroids with sound
Date: Mon, 12 Sep 1994 06:15:50 GMT

Hello,

I need a few testers for a beta version of the game sasteroids,
with digital sound. Yeah, I know this is embarassing considering
linux doom came out this week too :-)

If you've got voxware 2.9 or greater (included in linux kernels 1.1.32 and
up) and a sound card capable of 8-bit mono digital playback, try ftp'ing to
imagineer.disc-net.com (198.162.12.57). You'll probably have to use the IP
address. (name service is flakey to this site right now)

/pub/pitzel/sasteroids1.5-beta1-src.tar.gz      (sources)
/pub/pitzel/sasteroids1.5-beta1-bin.tar.gz      (precompiled binary)

You only need one of the above files.  Note that your high scores aren't
saved -- this is due to a change in the setuid() behaviour in recent
kernels. I'll release an official new sasteroids once these probs get worked
out. You need g++ 2.5.8 and svgalib 1.11 to compile it.

thanks,

Reply-To: Kevin Esler <esler@ch.hp.com>

Does anybody have any benchmark figures on the relative raw CPU
performance of:

        486/dx2-66
        Pentium 60
        Pentium 66
        Pentium 90

I am planning to purchase a system and it seems like the price
difference between the 486/dx2-66 and the P66 is about $300, and about
another $300 difference to get to the P90.  I'm trying to allocate my
$ resources in the best way possible.

I realize that system performance depends on more than just CPU
performance, by the way.

I am soon to purchase a system to run Linux. It will have a SCSI hard
disk.  It will also have a double speed CD-ROM drive.  Should I shell
out the extra $50-$100 to get a SCSI CD-ROM, as distinct from a
non-SCSI ?

Date: 12 Sep 1994 07:27:11 GMT

        I was finally able to get through to sunsite (see my previous post)
        and download the linxdoom.tgz file but there are problems with it now.
        When I first downloaded it I tried to see what the file sizes were
        in the tgz file by using the following command 
                "zcat linxdoom.tgz|tar tvf -" and I got a weird error like 
        the following:  tar: directory checksum error (804781340 != 63782) 
        so I renamed the file to linxdoom.tar.gz and tried: 
                "gunzip linxdoom.tar.gz" but again I got an error message.
        gunzip: linxdoom.tar.gz: invalid compressed data--crc error 
        and before anyone asks, yes I downloaded the file in binary mode
        from within ftp! Just to check I tried twice. Same result both times.
        So anyone who successfully got the fixed pixel-doubling version from
        sunsite.unc.edu, could you make it available on an ftp site somewhere
        else? Or perhaps the original person who downloaded this from ID
        software could re-upload it.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

I didn't think POSIX had solidified a thread standard yet.
Therefore it would be impossible to have a POSIX compliant thread
implementation.

Aside from that, kernel threads don't exist on Linux yet.
Several cooperative thread implentations exist, though, and I
suspect would be fairly easy to port to Linux.

Linux ran nicely on my 386SX/16 (4 meg, 8 meg swap), but I don't regret

I'm writing this note to rescind two statements I made on this thread earlier
in the day.

> linuxxdoom is unplayably slow...

It turns out that I was at fault.  I don't have sound driver installed in my
linux; the search for nonexistent sounddriver seems to be the cause of slow-down.
After I commented out the sndserver line in .doomrc, linuxxdoom runs beautifully.

> running xclient on a remote similar system is faster...

While it was the case when I had the sndserver problem, but not anymore.
local is much faster (at least for 486-66/75 class systems with 16+megs); 
after all, the advantage gained in bus (vs. TCP/IP packets) far outweighs
the computational overhead.

> It's an admirable effort...

I still stand by this statement:), sans all the qualifications and "but"s.

Thanks DDT!

now maybe I have enough incentive to do a kernel upgrade to install the sound 
driver.

I would recomend using the twm, since fvwm grabs the Alt-arrow
combinations, so you can't use the straffe feature.

I haven't had time to check this personaly, but it seems that olwm
grabs shift-arrows, so no fast movement with olwm.

Hope this helps,
miguel.

The reason why you don't see it often is because most services or BBS-s you 
call that have 14.4 modems drive it at 19.2 or 38.4; so there is no chance to 
have a throughput higher than that.

I have seen throughput much higher than 56k when I connected two modems of my 
own (115K DTE-DCE rate) and transferred highly compressible stuff.

Edit .doomrc to have the full path to sndserver,  only sndserver uses
the DOOMWADDIR env var,  doom expects to find the wad in the current
directory (I use a symlink).

(One fun thing to do is to run sndserver by itself,  you can get some
