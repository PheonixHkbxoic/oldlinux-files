another option (if you have the disk space available) is to add "mx#0"
to your /etc/printcap -- "man printcap" sez that mx specifies the maximum
size file that can be printed (or something similar :) and that a value of
0 means no limit.  This just went by in col.h (I think :) a while back...

That machine is running on a ppp link so be patient.

I am looking for a way to run windows software on my Liunx Box.  I have
checked out WINE but it won't cut it right now.  Is there a version of
SoftPC that will run under Linux.  I am willing to pay for this if there
is.

Date: Mon, 3 Oct 1994 00:58:54 GMT

Dear Netters,

I have a problem starting Seyon. The modem doesn't respond to anything I
do. /dev/modem was originally linked to /dev/cua3, which produced a
"modem read error". After relinking /dev/modem to other devices the
best result I got was with /dev/ttyS1 which doesn't give any errors,
but nothing happens when I try to dial, or type anything in the
term emulator window. I've tried all plausible devices in /dev
with no success. The modem is hooked to com4, and I have used all
the settings that work with DOS in the starup file.

Any suggestions?
Thanks in advance

Konstantin

: -- 

Well, I'll just relate some of my experiences to you. I'm currently running
NetBSD. HAve been since Feb '94. In Apr '94 I bought an adaptec 2842 VLB SCSI
board. I also have an adaptec 1542 board. The reason I bought the 2842 was because
I have 32 Meg in my system and with the ISA 1542 I could only have 16Meg or
using a SCSI device crashed my system. I bought this under my own premis that
if the 1542 was supported than the newer, faster VLB board of course would be
supported. Here's where it started.

I started perusing these groups to get any info on a 2842. First thing I'm told
is that Adaptec are being butts, not letting any information go, and insisting
that anyone writing such a driver needed to sign an NDA (non-disclosure agreement,)
and no source was to be provided.

Well I called Adaptec. I'm a hardware engineer and have had good dealings with
Adaptec in the past. Well I did get kind of a "butt" response from a person in
Tech. Support, but this isn't the first time. So I pressed him on the issue, and
he suggested I talk to their Tech. Publ. Hotline or something. Well, to make a 
long story short, I have Tech. Ref. Manuals on the 274x and 284x as well as on the
AIC-7770 RISC processor on the board.

During this time I heard that someone in the Linux camp was developing the driver.
Yea! The person who got me up and running on NEtBSD said it was possible we could
port the driver to NetBSD. Someone else tried to convince me to run Linux. Well
trying to be an open minded person, I ordered the InfoMagic Linux CD. WOW! This
CD had XFree86 source and binaries, Sunsite.unc.edu and more archives, 4 distributions
of Linux, GNU archives, even a preliminary version of WINE (Windows Emulator.)

I thought well there must be a CD like this for NetBSD. The nearest I've found
is TransAmeritech, which is still predominantly a Linux CD, but they also carry
a NetBSD distribuition. Mind you I don't know what version.

Well the guy working on the Linux driver posted something in the USENET about
having a pre-alpha version at rev. 5 on an ftp-site. I promptly grabbed it and
took a look. Now I've never coded anything for UNIX before, but have wriiten a
few drivers for :-( DOS. I posted a note just 2 days ago asking for info on
porting this driver to NetBSD. Some nice gentleman E-mailed me saying it was
impossible since LINUX was developed under GPL, which I later deduced was the
GNU Public License. He said none of this Linux person's code could be used. Now
excuse me, but this seems in direct confrontation with the excuse I heard 2 months
ago about how Adaptec insisted to source code be provided, where GPL insists that
source code be provided.

Needless to say, I'm looking at the real possibility, much as I don't want to,
of switching to Linux. :-( I happen to like NetBSD a great deal.

I am having a stability problem with LINUX kernel 1.1.51.  I have had
similar symptoms with 1.1.4X kernels.  Typically the system will run
normally for one to four days, then processes start hanging in a "D"
state and when new commands are invoked they die with "segmentation fault".

The syslog errors look like this:

Hi Jeff,

Having a nice day?

If you will notice, I was not attempting to respond to the original question
but, rather, to to Jan's comments. It is quite common, and even expected, to
edit out the irrelevant parts of a post you are responding to. Saves bandwidth,
so they say.

Since you are also on Netcom, I see, then I suggest that you try 1) a decent
newsreader that allows you to backup through a thread, like trn and 2)
the "P" key (you know, the one just above the ";" key). That will allow you
to step back as far as you need to see the beginning of this thread. Or do
you just feel like raving on someone who criticizes your baby? 

As for your aspersions that I have some kind of hard-on for Yggdrasil, I 
install and maintain UNIX systems (mostly SunOS) as a consultant for a living.
I've seen tons of installs and I know a mess when I see one. Other comments
in this thread and other threads throughout the Linux newsgroups bear that
out. I _did_ say that Yggdrasil shows a lot of promise. It just isn't there
yet. 

My comments were constructive and to the point. Hopefully Yggdrasil will 
read these and others here and take more care the next time. In the meantime
the Slackware distributions I've used have always worked perfectly and give
much finer control over the install process. Jan asked if there was a better
CD out there and I told him.

Do you have a problem with that?
