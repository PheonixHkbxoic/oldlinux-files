Subject: X won't use my RESOURCES???
Date: 3 Sep 1994 02:43:03 GMT

I'm trying to learn toolkit programming but I'm having a really
annoying problem on my Linux system.  I'm having problems getting
X to consistently accept my resources.  I've tried setting
XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, XAPPLRESDIR, and XENVIRONMENT.
None of these seem to work all the time, I've got 3 out of 4 programs
to work but the only way to get the fourth one to work is to load
the resources with xrdb.  I've verified that the program works on
another computer.  It ran with no problems.  I've RTMs (several).
Any thoughts?  I'm using Linux 1.0, gcc 2.6.0, Motif 1.2.4, 486 PC
with 16M ram.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Actually I'd recommend getting it from:

    ftp.uwa.edu.au                    /pub/nn/beta/nn-6.5.0.b3.tar.gz

Kim Storm no longer maintains nn and the version that most places have
is still 6.4.18. This newer nn is much nicer I have found as it
supports NOV so you don't have to run all the extra database programs
with nn. I had very little problems compiling nn-6.5.0 on Linux, but
you will have to make your own s-linux.h file. If the other site uses
NOV then you will get to see NN speed along over the nntp connection.

In most 'well written' programs, there is a hard-coded path, but often
it can be overridden by an environment variable.

The only time I get really annoyed by the hard-coding of these
pathnames is when I want to test a package and then have to recompile
when I decide it's suitable -- Moving the configuration files from
somewhere under /var/tmp/lib to /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib ..

>Un*x passes the pathname the executable (relative to the current

With execve(), you can pass *anything* as argv[0] -- By convention, I
suppose, argv[0] is often the path of the executable -- More often
absolute, especially when running a binary that is on PATH.  But you
could very well pass 'cheese' as argv[0] when running /sbin/login ...

Since I believe that in a *perfect* system, all the source is online
or in some easily accessible secondary storage (FTP counts!:),
hardcoded pathnames and even certain configuration options aren't
evil.  And if you don't get source, and get binaries instead, then let
them make the choice of where to put files.  A little bit of symbolic
linkage (/usr/lib/foo can really be anywhere you want it to be) and
you have all the freedom you need.

As for the part I deleted (A little script that, with the argv[0]
assumption, would cat a file in the directory where the script
resides), I *like* having the executabes in a couple of big places and
their configuration files in nicely divided areas (/bin and /usr/lib/*
respectively).  And any user-created data files should be in user
specified paths.

Netters,

I have a few questions about the Irwin 7251QE (QIC-02) tape drive.

I grabbed the current Ftape FAQ and it made reference to the QIC-02,
it doesn't support it.  Last time I compiled my kernel I saw an entry
for QIC-02 support.  If I compile with QIC-02 support can I mount the
tape drive and then write to it a gzip'd tar file?  And if so, what
are the specifics.  Can a tape have more then one file, etc?

Is anyone out there using a QIC-02 (or Irwin 7251QE) to do backups?
If you have a moment I would appreciate hearing what it can and cant'
do.

Thanks,
Rod

Un*x passes the pathname the executable (relative to the current
directory) in argv[0], and that in addition to the current working
directory tells you exactly where the program is.

For instance, here's a shell script that will always cat the file
"notes" which is in the same directory as the shell script.  Notice that
neither the name of the directory nor the name of the script is
hardcoded.

#!/bin/sh
cat ${0%/*}/notes

Unix programs still tend to hard code pathnames though, because otherwise
you can't create links to the program from other directories.

Of course, if you assume they are always symbolic links, you could make
the program do an lstat() on the executable to see if it's a symbolic
link and do the right thing.

You're almost certainly running these DRAMs far out of spec, on very 
thin ice.


The original design was probably doing a single refresh cycle on each
15us timeout.  Lets assume that they used 16Kbit DRAMs
organized as 128 rows of 128 ram cells each, requiring that all cells
be refreshed once every 2000us.   (I believe those numbers to be correct
for DRAMs of the XT era).
Each refresh cycle hits an entire row of 128 cells, thus all 128 rows 
are covered every 128*15us = 1920us, just barely meeting the 2000us spec.

When bigger DRAMs were built there were more rows of ram cells to hit,
but system designers would not put up with anything less than 15us refresh
intervals.  This carries over to the current day.  Opening a data book
at random, I see the Toshiba 4Mbit DRAM TC514400J/Z  (might be used in 
currently available PC's).  It is organized as an array of 1024 rows by
1024 columns by 4 bits, and has a refresh requirement of "1024 refresh
cycles/16ms".  So if we do single refresh cycles on 15us intervals,
we will cover the entire chip in 1024*15us = 15360us, again just barely
making spec.

A more efficient memory system design would be to do a burst of many
refresh cycles less often.  As an extreme example for the 4Mbit case, we 
might choose to do 1024 refresh cycles once every 16000us.  Perhaps most
memory systems on PC's today do it this way, if they do I would assume
that they have arranged for the hardware to be properly initialized.

DRAM's can be very forgiving.  I recall turning the power off of a
graphics system for 10 seconds, and seeing an almost correct image on
the screen when the power was restored.  The DRAM's used to store the
graphics pixels had retained their data with the power off.
When debugging a design I have often thought that a system was working
perfectly, only to find later that DRAM refresh was not working at all.

DRAM's tend to forget their contents much more readily as the heat goes
up, I believe this is an exponential trend.  Parts are often spec'd at
up to 70 degrees C (chip temperature, not ambient).
So perhaps you can cheat the spec by an order of magnitude or more if you
can keep things cool.  But memory errors can be very difficult to diagnose, 
and you must be willing to accept the consequences.

I am not terribly familiar with PC memory system design, but I have been
designing around DRAM since 1978.
Anybody out there able to shed a bit more light on what is going on with
current PC hardware?  I would assume that if they are typically doing
refresh once each 120us, then it is a burst 8 refresh cycles.
Any guidelines for figuring out if your hardware might be getting
initialized by somebody for 15us when it really could be 120us?

Um, I don't really like the idea of giving out Xconfigs, I figure everyone
should "roll their own" with the spreadsheet template provided by the
XFree distributions combining with your Monitor Specs. Check it out if you
haven't already.

My Diamond SS24X was purchased in Nov 1992. My monitor is a MicroScan 4A/ADI
15" purchased at the same time. I used the "freq" program to set a Clock at
80MHz. This is a bit over specs for my Monitor. But it hasn't blown in over
a year of this (and I'd like an excuse to buy a 17" anyway ;-). DIAL DOWN
the value from 80MHz TO BE SAFE. I have lower (e.g. 72 75 77 MHz modes there
as well, try them first, I am pretty sure they work for my setup)

Here is the relevant portion of my Xconfig. Ignore the 1072x768 mode I cooked
up: I use it to completely fill the monitor screen. I got 1152x900 to work
as well, but the characters weren't crisp enough and led to eyestrain.

Good luck and BE CAREFUL. Read your Monitor's user manual and use the
spreadsheet first, that's how I made these!

Subject: Possible FAQ?
Date: 3 Sep 1994 18:56:08 -0400

People keep on asking about BBS software available for Linux.  Maybe it's
time that a FAQ was available listing software that people got compiled
under linux and the places where its available (eg, xbbs, citadel, etc.)
The FAQ could also list projects currently under development and the contact
information of the authors/co-ordinators of the respecitve projects.

Regards,
Vaibhav
