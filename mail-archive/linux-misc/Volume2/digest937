If you dont want to use xwin  then you might get away w/ 30meg for
Linux.  I'm not a guru, but I think that you'll need to reserve some
space on the 1.08g drive for linux file systems.  That is if you want
to store Unix like files.  Os2 and dos (I run both of those and Linux)
will not read linux partitions, although Linux will readdos (I'm not
sure about HPFS though)
>(I don't want to make a bootable floppy disk.)  
No problem.  I use OS2 Boor Manager to get into Linux.  Very simple to
set up.

>(I want to use X-WIN or OpenWin.)

Sorry, I missread this.  I have 200 meg devoted to Linux.  With xwin
you might want about 120+ meg for just Linux. I think it can be done
w/ 80 but I'm not sure.  You can put the entire Linux file system on
your 1G hd and just boot it from there.  I have Linux as the las
partition of my second HD.  No problems at all.

>(I use Linux 1994 cd-rom release 4.)

I used the Info Magic, so I don't know about this one.

The answer to this is question has 2 parts:
        a) Can Linux read data off of my Dos or Windows CD-ROMS
           Answer: very probobly. As long as a CD-ROM confroms to the
                   ISO 9660 stanard, linux cn moutn and read it.
        b) Will the reader program that comes with my Cd-ROM work?
           Answer: Not directly under Linux,as it is a DOs or Windows
                   program. It MAY work under one of the emulators (then
                   again, it may not.)

Subject: Linux on Dual Pentium?
Date: 14 Oct 1994 13:38:28 GMT


I was just curious - Is Linux capable of utilizing a dual pentium
system?  I've seen some of these for sale, but I've yet to hear
of a program (except for the upcoming Windows 4.0) that will take
advantage of them.

If Linux does not, then does anyone have any plans in the works
for adding this capability?  I think that, down the road, multi-
processor systems are going to become mainstream.

We can supply you with the complete Slackware Linux Distribution on 51 3.5"
diskettes for only $59.95

The quantity of diskettes is not as bad as it sounds as they are sorted into
the distribution's component parts (eg 10 disks for X Windows, 14 for the
Linux kernel etc...).

This is the LSL diskette distribution that has been one of the most popular
diskette distributions since 0.99.13 due to its consistent quality.

This diskette package comes with a printed copy of Matt Welsh's Installation
and Getting Started Guide.

Cheers,  Bob.

Have you heard about UNIX? Linux is a true UNIX system with a lot
of advanced features. There are emulators that run dos and windows
under Linux, but not the other way around, Dos/Windows do not have the
"brain" to run Linux. 

Try it, you will love it.

Apart from the interesting things that have already been mentioned earlier,
there is another extremely elegant system to create a bootable disk: it's
Karel Kubat's (karel@icce.rug.nl) SAR (Search and Rescue) system. The
SAR system creates a bootable Linux disk, holding your actual kernel and
other programs you might need to restore your system after a minor or major
system crash.

Info about Karel' SAR is at http://www.icce.rug.nl, and the most recent
SAR-X.YY.tar.gz file is at ftp.icce.rug.nl, pub/unix. It's also at sunsite,
but that might not be the most recent one.

I just searched the source for how this happens and can't find it. I can
find the bit where it extracts the interpreter from the #! line but nowhere
can I find where it inhibits setuid scripts. I'm stumped.

I've discovered an anoying problem... Maybe it is just my configuration,

Anyway, when one su's to root and types mail it should say no mail

since it checks the MAILPAIH variable it still checks the old file.

I wonder where it gets the username... if it was from LOGNAME

If noone responds I guess I check the sources myself, but I would
be interested to see if this is the correct response, in my history

Hi there,

a am thinking of using Linux as a operating system for an application
which requires absolute data security and integrity, i.e. a power failure
should not result in loss of datan (this should be easy with a ups).
Furthermore, a failure of a hard disk shouldn't cause any problems either 
(a little bit harder, maybe RAID subsystems). Finally I even have to consider
the failure of the computer (difficult, maybe something like Novells Fileserver
duplexing - two identical file servers). Has anyone information how I can
achieve a high data integrity with Linux. I would appreciate ANY information,
including hardware products which are known to work with Linux, such as 
e.g. RAID subsystems.
In addition to that, I would like to know what database systems are available
for linux (not necessarily public domain...)

I use the X-Inside server with my PCI Mach64 card, and it works very well.  I
only have the 2mb Mach64, but I understand that 1600x1200 is indeed possible
with the 4mb card.

There is some information available on ftp.xinside.com.
