   LINUX 0.12 is a freely distributable UNIX clone.  It implements a
subset of System V and POSIX functionality.  LINUX has been written
from scratch, and therefore does not contain any AT&T or MINIX
code--not in the kernel, the compiler, the utilities, or the libraries.
For this reason it can be made available with the complete source code
via anonymous FTP.  LINUX runs only on 386/486 AT-bus machines; porting
to non-Intel architectures is likely to be difficult, as the kernel
makes extensive use of 386 memory management and task primitives.

Alt.os.linux is a newsgroup for discussing the development of Linux.
The Linux-Activists@joker.cs.hut.fi mailing list currently contains over
400 recipients, and it is melting down from overload.  Thus, the
creation of alt.os.linux is the result of an emergency situation.  The
expectation is that comp.os.linux will be proposed as a new newsgroup,
and when it is created, alt.os.linux will become obsoleted by the new
group.

Like comp.lang.perl, there will be a news <-> mail digest gateway
installed for people on the old mailing who cannot receive Usenet.  It
is expected, however, that the vast majority of the 400+ members of
Linux activists will be reading things via this newsgroup.

LINUX INFORMATION SHEET
(last updated 13 Jan 1992)

1. WHAT IS LINUX 0.12
    LINUX 0.12 is a freely distributable UNIX clone.  It implements a
subset of System V and POSIX functionality.  LINUX has been written
from scratch, and therefore does not contain any AT&T or MINIX
code--not in the kernel, the compiler, the utilities, or the libraries.
For this reason it can be made available with the complete source code
via anonymous FTP.  LINUX runs only on 386/486 AT-bus machines; porting
to non-Intel architectures is likely to be difficult, as the kernel
makes extensive use of 386 memory management and task primitives.

     Version 0.12 is still a beta release, but it already provides much
of the functionality of a System V.3 kernel.  For example, various
users have been able to port programs such as bison/flex without having
to modify code at all.  Another indication of its maturity is that
it is now possible to do LINUX kernel development using LINUX itself 
and freely-available programming tools.

2. LINUX features
  - System call compatible with a subset of System V and POSIX
  - Full multiprogramming (multiple programs can run at once)
  - Memory paging with copy-on-write
  - Demand loading of executables
  - Page sharing of executables
  - Virtual memory: swapping to disk when out of RAM
  - POSIX job control
  - virtual consoles on EGA/VGA screens
  - pty's
  - some 387-emulation
  - ANSI compliant C compiler (gcc)
  - A complete set of compiler writing tools
    (bison as yacc-replacement, flex as lex replacement)
  - The GNU 'Bourne again' shell (bash)
  - Micro emacs
  - most utilities you need for development
    (cat, cp, kermit, ls, make, etc.)
  - Over 200 library procedures (atoi, fork, malloc, read, stdio, etc.)
  - Currently 4 national keyboards: Finnish/US/German/French
  - Full source code (in C) for the OS is freely distributable
  - Full source code of the tools can be gotten from many anonymous ftp sites
    (Almost the entire suite of GNU programs has been ported to Linux.)
  - Runs in protected mode on 386 and above
  - Support for extended memory up to 16M on 386 and above
  - RS-232 serial line support with terminal emulation, kermit, zmodem, etc.
  - Supports the real time clock


3. HARDWARE REQUIRED
   - A 386 or 486 machine with an AT-bus.  (EISA will probably work, also,
     but you will need an AT-bus hard disk controller.)
     Both DX and SX processors will work.
   - A hard disk implementing the standard AT hard disk interface--
     for example, an IDE drive.  SCSI drives are not supported yet.
   - A high-density disk drive--either 5.25" (1.2MB) or 3.5" (1.44MB).
   - At least 2 megabytes of RAM.  (LINUX will boot in 2 Mb.  To use
     gcc 4 MB is a good idea.)
   - Any video card of the following: Hercules,CGA,EGA,VGA

In addition, LINUX supports
   - Up to two serial lines
   - A real time clock 

4. PARTIAL LIST OF UTILITIES INCLUDED IN OR AVAILABLE FOR LINUX 0.12 
   - The MTOOLS package (reading/writing to DOS filesystems)
   - The complete GNU filetools (ls, cat, cp, mv, ...)
   - The GNU C compiler with GNU assembler, linker, ar, ...
   - bison
   - flex
   - rcs
   - pmake (BSD 4.3 Reno/BSD 4.4  make)
   - kermit
   - Micro emacs
   - less
   - mkfs
   - fsck
   - mount/umount


5. LINUX BINARIES
    The LINUX binaries and sources are available at three
    anonymous FTP sites. These are:

    nic.funet.fi:/pub/OS/Linux
    tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux
    tupac-amaru.informatik.rwth-aachen.de:/pub/msdos/replace


6. LEGAL STATUS OF LINUX
     Although LINUX is  supplied with the  complete source  code, it is
copyrighted software.  Unlike MINIX, however, it is available for free,
provided  you obey  to the  rules specified  in  the  LINUX  copyright.


7. NEWS ABOUT LINUX
     Since LINUX's  introduction to the public there has been a rapidly
growing mailing list, "linux-activists@niksula.hut.fi". To subscribe to 
this  list,  mail to  "linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi".  If the
traffic in this lists increases  further, there are  plans to swap ( at 
least partially ) over  to comp.os.misc, so  watch out  for  any  LINUX 
articles in  this group.  For the current status of LINUX, do "finger
torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi".


8. FUTURE PLANS
     Work is underway on LINUX version 1.0, which will close some of the
gaps in the present implementation.  Various people are currently working
on:
     - A virtual filesystem layer 
     - STREAMS 
     - init/getty/login
     - Interprocess communication
     - IEEE POSIX P1003.1 / P1003.2 compatibility
     - SCSI support

  I would like to know whether Tex/Latex/mf is ported to linux. Does Linux
support/permit bitmapped graphics on vga/svga cards. This question is
important to me as I am interested in knowing whether it is possible to port
dvi previewers / picture drawing facility to Linux. 

Please bear with me if these questions are inappropriate to the current state

	Hmm.. My friend installed it on one 386 last night and it took
him about 3-4 hours total with disk backup & partitioning etc. Howewer,
he is really a unix wizard and someone with less experience in such opera-
ting systems might have faced lots of difficulties and so on. It isn't 
particularly easy to install and it lacks some utilities (I know, you can
port and add then yourself, but..) but it has some edge. You don't
have to pay several hundred dollars just to try it. If you are interested,
it is well worth trying!

No, Tex/LaTex has not been ported to Linux yet.  It should be fairly
easy to compile the Tex/LaTeX formatters themselves; the rub (as you
yourself pointed out) is doing the previewer.  

No, there are no interfaces for doing graphics operations on Linux
(yet).  There are several people who are interested in porting X11 to
Linux, which will solve all sorts of problems, but there are a couple of
things like BSD Networking/sockets that we would have to implement
first.

Does Linux use Mach as it's kernel? I don't know how hard it would

Is there any way to get a preexisting boot disk that will allow enough of
a Linux format that I can then get the rest of the stuff on my disk without
having to read and write raw blocks myself?  I fear I'm not quite studly

First, does ANYONE already have 'make' for Linux?  I'm trying to compile
it right now.

Next:

I have figured out how to boot up Linux from both the hard disk and the 
floppy.  I have a 18969 line uuencoded compressed SHAR file that I could
post (in 19 files).  

Should I post it?

I THINK that all you have to do is to:

  1. Boot up from the floppy.
  2. Create your hard disk partition and mount it.
  3. Copy the floppy to the hard disk.
  4. Run the ChangeBoot program listed in INSTALL-0.10


BUT!!!  I haven't tried this as I only have one disk and its working fine
thank you (I've been working on this since last night (Friday) and just
got it working an hour or so ago.

I used SHOELACE to boot up stuff, and now I can boot up on 1 floppy that is
also a root file system. Same thing for the hard disk.

Please let me know if you want it.  I might also be able to make it
available via ANON FTP if that would be better..

make is part of the standard release.  In versions 0.10 and 0.11 it
was in the file utilbin.tar.Z.  In version 0.12 utilbin.tar.Z has
been replaced by fileutil.tar.Z and utils.tar.Z.  You'll find make
in utils.tar.Z.  In addition you may want to grap the text utilities
in test-1.1.bin.tar.Z.  Other utilities have been ported separately.

I believe all these are on the normal linux distribution systems
mentioned in the INFO sheet that was just posted.

With the various kernel changes going on, I'd be tempted to keep
separate boot and root disks.  But that's just a personal opinion.

>BUT!!!  I haven't tried this as I only have one disk and its working fine
Posting of untested or alpha versions are likely to cause problems.

Get a copy of the rawrite.exe program to do it for you.  It's
very simple.  You give it a filename and a device, and it
will put the file on the device.  Source, doc, and exe are

This sounds like it has indeed changed your root-device, but something
is missing on it (like it couldn't find /dev/tty1, and bash is exiting
at once?). Check out that the root device has all the necessary files.

Also check out the bootup-message that tells you the size of the
root-device: do the numbers look ok?

Are you sure you updated the utilities and /dev (it changed
significantly in 0.12) before trying to boot the hard disk?
Note that the cp +recursive command has changed behavior
between 0.11 and 0.12, and if you use the 0.11 installation
instructions to do the copy, it will put the new files in
the wrong places.  Watch to make sure that the file get
copied to /bin, /dev, and not to /bin/bin or /dev/dev.

The relevant change is:
0.11: cp +recursive +verbose /$i $i
0.12: cp +recursive +verbose /$i .

Ok, I found my problem.  When I did my

cp +recursive...
to copy the root filesystem to hd3, bin/sh only got half written.

I think that this is a problem with my hard drive, not with linux.  I
have been unable to copy the file over, because every time I try, I
get a kernel panic, which I will reproduce here:

Kernel panic: HD controller not ready

>Who is doing TCP/IP?
Looks like I am unless someone tells me they have already started it :)

I just sent this to the mailing list but now that the group is here I'll send
a copy here to:


I'm just about done with some modifications to greatly speed up the floppy
drive. The new version has a floppy cylinder buffer and always reads a
cylinder at a time and satisifies any further requests on that cylinder out of
the buffer. This speeds up reads a lot and seems to make the floppy perform as
well or better than it does under MS-DROSS. I'm still working one one
obnoxious problem that appears to be the fault of Not-So-Intel, if a screen
scroll happens during a floppy read it appears to tie the bus up long enough
(presumably Hercules has lots of wait states) to prevent DMA from happening on
time, causing the drive to constantly reset when you scroll :( At this point I
am just going to try to have it silently retry, but any other ideas would be
appreciated. I'm also going to add a format IOCTL call for the floppy driver
and am considering a set of minor numbers that would automatically format a
floppy. This way you could go through backing up onto a box of blank floppies
without having to format as you go. If all goes well (a big if since it is
Intel) I will upload the new driver sometime this evening.  

I'm considering a similar trick with the HD driver but TCP/IP is probably
more important at the moment.

It looks like I am going to be doing the TCP/IP port after all, the person
who claimed it before decided to do IPC instead. If any one else has started
warn me so we don't duplicate efforts. 

A friend of mine has been working on a self booting floppy that contains 
fdisk and some other needed utilities. This would allow a system to be 
setup from scratch without having to involve MS-MOSS.

I can't wait for X-Windows to work, it will be so much fun playing X-tank in
front of people who think EVENT-QUEUE-CLUDGED-ON-TO-MS-LOSS 3.0 is the
greatest thing since sliced bread ;)

Hello NetLanders,

   Well earlier yesterday and today I was banging right along with Linux.
I was able to tell Linux to boot from the hard disk and mount the root from
the hard disk (/dev/hd1). I used ShoeLace to do this.

THEN I tried to activate swapping on /dev/hd2.  No joy.  mkswap told me I
couldn't use the second partition because it was a DOS extended partition.

So, I proceded to try to change the partition type with 'edpart', which
seemed to work, until I tried to re-boot using the hard disk.  NO JOY!

It now would not boot!  Fortunately I had a bootable rootable floppy, which
I then proceeded to boot from.  When I then ran 'fdisk', it said that 
/dev/hd3 and /dev/hd4 were my partitions instead of /dev/hd1 and /dev/hd2!!!!

"Well", I says to myself, "I can live with that.", so I proceeded to install
ShoeLace to use /dev/hd3 as the root.  No Joy.  Upon booting /dev/hd3, it
comes up and says that I still am trying to use /dev/hd1 after I've already
told it I want /dev/hd3!  Pretty wierd, eh kiddies?

So, unless someone has any ideas, I'll just have to run without Swapping
enabled until I or someone else figures out how to get mkswap to accept
a DOS 5 or DOS 3.3 extended partition!

   Any ideas?

   Thanks!

There is no real consensus on whether partition #1 is the first
partition on the disk, or is the first entry in the partition
table.  Some parition programs sort this information on the
screen only, some will write the sorted information back to the
hard disk.  Linux assumes that the first entry is hd1, and so
if some utility starts sorting/reordering the table these things
can change.

A useful hack is to make each of your partitions a different size.
Then after any editting or possible change to the partition table
you can boot a floppy system and run fdisk (linux's, not DOS) to
see if the assignments still hold.

The 16 bit FAT DOS(4) Extension selection in edpart is acceptable
to linux for both the regular file system partitions and swap space.
These are not the same as the extended dos partitions that can
contain multiple logical volumes which linux objects to.

At least it works for me.

Shoelace has a bug in it. As far as I am aware, it will not be possible
to use shoelace to boot a kernel that does swapping (something to do
with the fact that shoelace overwrites the wrong bytes in the bootsector
when loading. If you want to grab the shoelace sources, I am informed
that it is a fairly easy bug to fix. )

Linux does not use Mach, nor any other pre-existing kernel.  Is
completely written by Linus Torvalds (+ collaborators, from the
Linux-activists mailing list (which this newsgroup tries to replace for
people with news access)).

I don't think saving steps has been a guiding priciple for Linus.  In
fact, I secretly think he started the project because he got tired of
playing Prince of Persia (or something like that, I never bothered to
take a look at the game).

This is approximately true.  I don't remember the exact date, but that

I seem to remember reading somewhere in this newsgroup that zmodem had been
used successfully with Linux.  However, I really don't know any more about
that.  I can, perhaps, help you speed up kermit, though...

At the kermit prompt, try typing "set send pack 1000" and "set rec pack 1000".
Do this on both ends of the connection.  This will allow you to use 1000
character packets, making the transfer speed much closer to that of Ymodem
(1k-Xmodem).  Not all versions of kermit support the extended length packets.
I know that MS-Dos kermit does, and the Unix kermit we are using here at WPI
does.  Also, you may notice that newer versions of kermit claim to let you up
the packet length to 2000 characters.  I have never gotten kermit to work with
anything greater than 1000 character packets, and I mean 1000, not 1024. 
Anyway, try it.  I think you'll find kermit much more livable.

I'm the author of rawrite.exe, a program that writes DOS files to
floppies.  The original purpose of rawrite was to write the Minix demo
software on floppies so people could check if their computer was
compatible enough to run Minix.

My mind boggled a little when I saw David's first note.  Pulled out my
archive copy of rawrite.c, compiled it, then went looking for that
string..

It's part of the scanf() library routine.  Borland tried to set it up
so that the floating point library would only be loaded if needed...
and since there aren't any floats in rawrite, the floating conversion
routines aren't loaded, and the string appears when scanf() is asked
to perform such a conversion.

Then I started wondering where scanf() was getting a format requiring
floating point conversion.

Then his second note crossed my tube... :-)
				   
Bug reports are appreciated.  Some people may wonder why data is read
and written in 3-sector chunks.  I discovered, during testing, that
some BIOS' didn't correctly implement full-track writes to floppy
drives.  Considering DOS-compatible floppies have 9, 15, or 18 sectors
per track, using 3 seemed to be a good idea.

Regards,
Mark

I wasn't able to get shoelace to work.  The trouble is that I don't know 
or understand minix stuff, so the instructions were confusing. 
Here's what I did: what is missing?

1. I managed to get Linux 0.12 installed and working well on hd3,
booting from my bootimag floppy (1.2Mb: I defined a /dev/floppy0
for this.)  I've had no trouble installing utilities, vi, etc., using
rawrite and tar.

2. Working through the readme file on shoelace (from minix, apparently),
and skipping the floppy testing (I understand DOS MBRs and boot sectors,
and figured I wouldn't mess my hard drive) the only commands that it 
seemed I had to do were

   laceup /dev/hd3 wini

and

   laceup -w 3 /dev/hd0

What this achieved is a correct "winiboot", in that on startup I select
between partition 1 and 3 (DOS or Linux), but when I select Linux the
system doesn't boot because it can't find the kernal, then it can't
find the loadimage either.  It seems the steps I took don't actually
get the "bootimag" of the floppy disk onto the HD, so the kernal is never
loaded.

The screen I get looks like this (retyped by hand)

-------------------------------------

I tried copying the bootimag file to /usr/src/linux/linux/Image, and
also tried the (bootimag - the first sector), but these don't work either.
Somewhere I am missing a step.  The partitions are fine, but the kernal
is not found on the hard disk.  Assumably it is in my bootimag on the
floppy.  How do I put it onto the hard disk? 

Meanwhile I can still boot from the floppy, etc., or get DOS running no
problem.

Well, people are posting to alt.os.linux already.  If you are seeing
articles from alt.os.linux, it's probably a safe bet to start posting
there, especially if you see a copy of this message on alt.os.linux on
your site.

And now, for a couple of questions that were on the

      - Does Linux use TSS segments to provide multitasking?

Yes.

      - If not, is the kernel fairly 'easy' to read that building a
	'BIOS' emulator wouldn't mean having to rewrite everything.

Do you mean a DOS emulation mode?  It's not impossible, but due to the
way the 386 chips work, each 8086 task would have to have its own set of
page tables, and you would have to put in routines to intercept and deal
with I/O instructions, BIOS calls, etc.  It's probably more difficult
that you think...

      - Does Linux work on IDE drives?  I have a 80meg IDE drive
	(user-defined in the BIOS) and it doesn't work with the
	at-wini.c in Minix 1.3.

Yes; IDE drives work just fine.  (I using one on my system.)

      - How big is the 'complete' Linux package?

Well, the boot and root image disketts are about 750k compressed.  The
kernel sources are about 200k compressed, and the libc sources are
another 170k compressed.  The GNU C compiler is 670k, and the other
miscellaneous unix utilities are probably a bit over a megabyte.

Now add sources to whatever you want to port and compile yourself.  The
sources to GNU emacs are about 3 megabytes, compressed.  Groff (a troff
replacement) is just over 1 megabyte.

If you think this is big, remember that the OS/2 2.0 Limited Availability
release is 20 1.44 megabyte diskettes.

      - I don't have FTP access.  Any dial-up systems that I could pick it
	off of?  (i'm at 2400 MNP5/v.42/v.42bis)

I suggest you find a friend with FTP access; I think it's a bit too big
to comfortably grab via a modem.  After February 1st, I *may* be willing
to ship Linux distribution diskettes to people without net access for
some distribution fee (probably around US$ 5.00/diskette plus S/H).
(The price reflects the fact that I don't have fancy duplicating
equipment, and I want to encourage people who have friends with net
access to get it via FTP. :-)

	Instead of using /dev/tty64 and /dev/tty65 for the serial line

likely to get confused that way.

	Linus, I would recommend doing the same thing in the

following:

1)  How much disk space does a full Linux installation take up?  With all the
    extras and utilities?  How about a minimum install?

2)  How stable is Linux in sharing a disk with DOS?  Does it reside nicely
    on a partitioned disk?  


Any other information/experiences people can share about running both Linux
and Dos would be very helpful.  I free 386 Unix has been a long time coming,
but I'm not ready to give up all my DOS programs to use it...thanks in 
advance.

To firm up my previous offer:  As of February 1st, I will make available
diskettes which contain the Linux distribution and utilities.  The
distribution fee which I will charge is US $5.00/diskette, with shipping
and handling costs of:

$2.50 * (ceil(number of 5" diskettes/5) + ceil(number of 3" diskettes/3)) 
	For addresses within US/Canada

$5.00 * (ceil(number of 5" diskettes/5) + ceil(number of 3" diskettes/3)) 
	For other addresses

Note that the Linux distribution is freely available; I do not plan to
get rich over this.  Once you a Linux distribution (by whatever means),
you are perfectly free to give away copies to whomever you wish.  I am
charging something to cover the costs of the diskettes and floppy
mailers (it doesn't even begin to cover for my time), and to encourage
people who can find some way of getting access of Linux to use them.

If someone with time to burn wants to undercut me and do it for free, or
for a reduced distribution fee, please step up.  If someone else wants
to run this service, I will have more time to do other things.  :-)

Assuming no one else steps up, I will be figuring out how to package the
distribution, and will post something about that in a week or two.
Figure on 2 disks for the boot and root images, and another 2 or 3 for
the binaries of basic utilities: gcc, diff, rcs, etc.  The source code
for the kernel, library, etc. should fit on one diskette.  Sources for
the GNU utilities will vary (and will be big).  The sources to GNU emacs
will take at least 3 disks, for example.

hi.  I don't have ftp either but have found that there are many ftp mail
servers out there that can do the job and send you the files via mail.

The server I use is ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  I send it mail with the ftp
commands in it and it send back a log of the ftp session and the request
files.  Binary files are in uuencode format and split into 60k(+-) junks
so mail can handle them.  You edit the mail, put the pieces back together
and run uudecode to convert back to the original binary file.

It's not as simple as ftp, but it gets the job done.

To find the list of commands valid at an ftpmail server, send a message
with just "help" in the body.  The server will send back instructions
and command list.

Example:     mail ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
	     Subject: anything you want
             help

To get a list of files available from tsx-11:/pub/linux send:

	mail ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
	Subject: whatever
	reply <your return mail addr>
	connect tsx-11.mit.edu
	chdir /pub/linux       #only 1 chdir allowed per session
        dir -R
	quit

First you'll get back acknowledgement of your request.  Then after
awhile you get a log of the ftp session, and the output from dir.

To get files in uuencode format send this to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com:

	reply <your return addr>
	connect tsx-11.mit.edu
	binary
	uuencode
	chdir /pub/linux
	get images/bootimage-0.12.Z
	get images/rootimage-0.12.Z
	get docs/INSTALL-0.11
	get docs/RELNOTES-0.11
	get docs/RELNOTES-0.12
	quit

I think I found a problem in the new Linux 0.12.  The kernel
panicked saying "tty_ioctl: dev<0".  Anyway, this is what I did:

  1. Started 10 /bin/sh background jobs
  2. Typed "logout" twice.

....and it happened.  If I'm not mistaken, it should've just killed 
the shells and logged me out.  Apparently it has problems doing that.

Date: Mon, 20 Jan 1992 01:40:10 GMT

I'm currently in the process of getting linux down to my '386; to try
it out... looks like it's going to be something nice to have...

I have noticed a great amount of brew-ha-ha in the minix group about
the missing init/login, and thought I would offer a suggestion - which
I would implement myself, but I don't think I'll have the time; since it's
going to take a couple of days to get everything downloaded (2400 baud
kermit...)

Anyway, in the comp.os.sysv386 group; not too long ago was a public domain
login - which can replace login under ISC, etc...   Perhaps someone
can just get that and compile it...  (if you're game, and don't have
the source; toss me a note and I'll send it to you, it's only two parts).
Then all we really need is init, which may already be around just
as this login() was.  [By the way, this is apparently a small change
to the login replacement in comp.sources.misc.]

No, not at all. I know next to nothing about installing and
maintaining unix machines, and the only problem I had when starting
with linux was that I thought my ESDI drive would not work with it. I
tried some old MFM drives and that was it. I even started with linux
0.10 and at that time you even needed minix demo diskette to make
filesystems, but everything else was easy. There were difficulties
with some bugs but those ones have got a lot of DDT since that time.
Now installing linux is very straightforward. Of course you can't do
too much with the system without some knowledge, because you need to
compile the programs you use yourself. Nobody I know sells
shrink-wrapped software for this system. But also porting things is
easy, rather often just "make".

After all even the problem with my ESDI drive got solved (for those
that don't know, at least Joincom controller with Magtron drive work
well after you comment out the "unexpected hd interrupt"-message from
hd.c).

I would suggest trying it out, especially because it is free. You
don't lose anything (if you have backups :). I was really impressed.

How about using the 'screen' package ? It should be portable even to
Linux.

I'm so found of it that I even use it under X :-)

Organization: McAfee Associates

Greetings,
    Happy!  Since this newsgroup has been created, my mail/day has dropped
from 56 to 22!  *grin*

    In regards to init/login, there was some SERIOUS fur flying when I
tried to install that.  I'm not sure what was the matter, but 1) the
libc.a library's /etc/passwd accessing calls were *TOTALLY* bogus.  (They
returned values that boggled the mind...)  I'm not sure what I ended up
doing, but along the way I found that I had two different library source
collections, and that one wouldn't work at all, and the other would.  *sigh*

    Anyhow, the init.c program (from qpl-init.tar.Z, as I recall) has an
unfortunate bug that the author couldn't have forseen (not having terminals
hung off their serial port, as they said).  In the while loop that loads in
the next terminal definition if and only if that definition is 'on', the
conditional is reversed.

    That's an easy fix.  (It's something like '== ON' and it should be
'!=ON', or something similar.)

    A stranger problem involved 'login' always giving a 'Login incorrect'
message before the login prompt when it started up.  This was fixed by
adding a '-p' inside the getty field in "/etc/ttytab".  (This problem was
compounded by my having had *NO* idea what /etc/ttytab was for when init.c
mentioned it.  I downloaded one off this site, and trimmed it down to two
'terminals'.)

    Now for my main *PROBLEM*.  init now loads login correctly for both
my real terminal and my Modem.  (Useful, trust me.)  The problem is that
input from the serial port is *NOT ECHOED BACK*.  Moreover, it's
evidently not even accepted into login!

    (Actually, if I 'doshell /dev/tty64 /bin/sh &' and a person is attached
to my modem, they are dropped into the shell happily.  Except their input
still doesn't echo!  *argh!*)

    I also have the problem that when my modem answers the phone, I get a
GPI, then things continue fine usually.  (I believe it also happens when
the modem hangs up.)

    I'd like to second the mumble of frustration of the person for whom a
disk error on the disk they are reading from causes the need for a reboot.

    (fsck is bitching at me about problems on my disk, that it evidently
can't fix, and I think it's caused because I wasn't able to sync with the
'floppy reset called' flashing up my screen.  If anyone has a suggestion on
how to fix fsck errors, I'd love to hear them.)

    Even including these clear and simple little beta problems, the
operating system is (to giggle slightly) more valuable to me than the
Coherent operating system that I purchased a while back.  A salute to
Linus for a brilliant job, and the willingness to share it with us all.

I've been doing a lot of reading & mock-coding for it, but I haven't
gotten to the testing stage yet.  (Primarily because I'm waiting to

Keywords: Linux segmentation fault
Nntp-Posting-Host: bwdlh115

A couple of weeks ago I installed linux 0.11 on my machine (386-33 12M RAM) and
set it up to use /dev/hd1 as the root volume.  Whenever I was using linux 0.11
I would receive intermittent segmentation faults (seemingly at random) but
overall I was able to do a fair amount with it.  This weekend I decided to
install 0.12 and give it a try, hoping that the segmentation fault problem
would have vanished.  Well, not only did it not vanish, it has enlarged to
the point where linux 0.12 is practically unusable - most major commands now
fail with segmentation faults compounded by the root process dying after a
couple of faults are received.  The only thing I have been able to determine
so far is that the problem may be related to the memory in use by disk buffers
(ex. tar tvf man.tar or fdisk usually works, where as tar tvf utils.tar or mkfs
usually fails).  I've essentially given up on the idea of using 0.12 for 
anything useful until I can determine the source of these segment faults.  Has
anyone else out there run into this problem ?  If so, have you determined
the source ?  I would appreciate any ideas/suggestions that anyone has on
resolving this problem.

mvdir needs kernel resources that aren't there yet - it would have been
my next project after the linked lists, but once again I'm hoping for
VFS, and I don't want to touch the fs too much before that arrives. The
reason the rename system call isn't implemented yet is that there are a
couple of problems with it: it isn't as straightforward as you'd
imagine. Race conditions, inclusion checking etc..

It will befinitely be in 0.13 or 14 - if you remind me. It's not /that/
difficult, just needs a little thought. In the meantime, you might fake
it with "cp +recursive" and "rm -rf". Be careful with that though..

I have a generic 486-33 with 4mb and a 120mb ide drive.  I can boot linux
0.12 from floppy, and use the root floppy disk.  

I've made a ~40mb partition to use for linux.

#fdisk
/dev/hd3: 86079 blocks active 16-bit DOS (>=32M)
/dev/hd4: 41072 blocks unknown partition type 0x9F
# mount /dev/hd4 /user
/dev/hd4 mounted
#

...so that works OK.  I copied all the root files to the /user partition.

Now I'm ready to edit the bootimage and be able to use the root filesystem
on the hd.  Following the directions in the various INSTALL documents,
I believe that I should change the word at offset 508 to be 0x0304.

My binary editor uses hex offsets, so 508 = 0x1FC.  I therefore need to
change byte 1FC from 00 -> 04 and byte 1FD from 55 to 03.  I did this.

However, after the Loading.... message, and the VGA selection prompt,
nothing happens.  The computer locks, and C-A-D does nothing.

Can someone point out the stupid error I'm probably making?  thanks!

Hello,

	Glad there is finally a group for Linux!  I've been using Linux for
a couple of weeks now, and am very impressed.  I do have two questions
though:

1) Is it possible to boot directly from the hard disk?  Currently I have
   a hard drive partition for Linux, as well as Coherent and DR DOS, as
   the root partition, but I still must boot from floppy.

2) What is the directory structure for GNU C?  I have tryed various locations
   without any luck, gcc cannot find cpp, cc1, etc, I was able to get the
   compiler to work only by setting links to the gcc-* files, such as
   ln gcc-cc1 cc1.  If anyone is using this successfully could you please
   E-Mail me your setup?

Any and all replies welcome, thanks!

When I was helping to install linux (v.12) we could make a big (read
>32M) partition on the hard drive.  But, when we typed 
   mkfs -c /dev/hd1 81974  (or just about any size greater than 32K blocks)
mkfs choked.  Is there any reason for this?  I've seen references to other
people using bigger than 32M partitions.  Our solution was a kluge, we
partitioned the 124 meg hd into 32,32,32,28, making them all dos partitions,
and used the 1st one for dos, and the other 3 for linux.  (BTW is there a
better version of edpart or pdisk out there that won't choke on partitions
over 32M  (not dos 5 fdisk, we need to create two regular dos partitions, not
one regular and one extended.)?

Any help would be appreciated.

Hey, everyone!  First I would like to express my sincerest gratitude
to whoever wrote Linux.  Jolly good job!

Second, we figured out our partitioning problem.  It turns out that
the edpart program (dated 1990) worked, but in a bit of a cryptic 
manner.  If you use dos 5 fdisk to make your primary dos partition
as big as you want, then use edpart to make your other partitions
and set their status as UNACCESSIBLE, Linux would recognize them
just fine.  We still couldn't find a way to make Linux use 
anything bigger than a 32M partition, but oh, well.

Third, is there any possibility of a 286 version of Linux coming
out, or how hard would it be with the sources, to modify it to
run on a 286?  (I have a 286 and can't afford to upgrade right
 now)

I'm running linux on a fairly small 386sx machine, with a 1.2MB floppy
drive.  Everything works OK except that I can't do backups with tar.
I get one of two failure modes.  (1) system goes into an infinite loop
printing "Reset-floppy called".  (2) The system hangs, with the floppy
drive light on.  In the first case, it appears that something has
caused a recal (I suspect an error of some sort -- I haven't been able
to duplicate it since putting in extra prints), and the recal fails,
thus triggering a reset, which of course triggers a recal, which also
fails...  (I got to see the error message by causing a recal to always
appear to succeed.  This broke the looping, letting me see what was on
the console.) I don't know what is happening in the first case, as I
find it a bit harder to figure out what sort of debugging code to put
in.

I'm reluctant to do any further work on the system when I can't
back it up, and I don't have the PC expertise to fix it myself.

	I have always wanted un*x to have one part of the FS
	dynamic (only in memory, it's run-time) where all process etc.
	stuff is like:

		/system/proc

	You might want to send something to one process  with

	Which could cause signal (and the data) to the process 1123.

Might be easier to simply run Linux under the PC-Soft 386 emulation
software.  (Assuming the m68k is a Mac box.)  I wonder if that would
work?

Subject: Buggy omit-frame-pointer?
Date: 21 Jan 92 17:23:26 GMT
Organization: Bell-Northern Research, Ottawa, Canada

Hello.  First, I'd like to express my gratitude to Linus and the rest
of the Linux contributors.  It's a nice piece of work.

With that out of the way, let's move on to the bitching :-)

For now, I'm cross-compiling Linux from Minix using GCC 1.40.  There
seems to be a problem with variadic routines compiled with
"-fomit-frame-pointer".  At first I though that my version of GCC was
screwed, but then I noticed that a similar problem shows up in the
distributed init/main.s.

From init/main.c:

    static int printf(const char *fmt, ...)
    {
        va_list args;
        int i;

        va_start(args, fmt);
        write(1,printbuf,i=vsprintf(printbuf, fmt, args));
        va_end(args);
        return i;
    }

From init/main.s:

    _printf:
        pushl %ebx
        leal 12(%esp),%eax
        pushl %eax
        pushl 12(%esp)              !!!! THIS SHOULD BE 8(%esp) !!!!
        pushl $_printbuf
        call _vsprintf
        movl %eax,%ebx
        pushl %ebx
        pushl $_printbuf
        pushl $1
        call _write
        movl %ebx,%eax
        addl $24,%esp
        popl %ebx
        ret

Strangely enough, my version of GCC uses an offset of 16 in both places
where 12 is used above.   This is even more wrong.  Is this a known bug
in GCC?  If so, why do all the distributed makefiles use -fomit-frame-pointer?
I couldn't get anything to work until I deleted this from the makefiles.

Tssk.  Be /very/ careful when assuming bugs in gcc: I find it very
satisfactory, and most bugs aren't in gcc but in the person who thinks
they are.  (Well, there is one known bug in the linux-gcc, but that's
due to my porting, and doesn't actually make incorrect code).

No, 12(%esp) is correct.  You are forgetting the return address: there
are three longs on the stack before the push: %eax, %ebx and the return
address.  Thus the offset 12 is correct.  The fact that the resulting
code actually works should have made you cautious.  Not using the frame
pointer makes for code that is a bit harder to follow, but on a 386
where the registers are few anyway, I hate to leave one register
practically unused for no good reason.

As it is now, it gives "super block unreadable" if I try to df the

The limitation in Linux is 64M (actually 65535 1K blocks) not 32M.
I used edpart to create multiple 64M partitions (64,999 blocks).

The version I used was: edpart.exe      23833  12-12-90  11:06

Are you saying that you can't create a 64M partition with edpart,
that mkfs refuses to use it, or that Linux has problems when using
it?

like the child is dieing, causing a SIG_CHLD; which I should either
catch or ignore - neither of which do much - the sleep is then
terminated, causing the children to be run over and over, more than
once a second!

Ideas???

p.s. I have the uuencode and uudecode from the BSD source tree ported

     or should items like this go directly to some/all FTP archives?

Blush. I'm usually very cautious when I think I've found a bug in a
compiler.  It seems that in this case, I wasn't quite cautious enough.

Actually, what I was overlooking was that the "pushl %eax" decremented
the stack pointer.  This comes, as you mention, from not being accustumed
to examining code which doesn't use the frame pointer.

>The fact that the resulting
>code actually works should have made you cautious.

Except that, in my case, the resulting code did not actually work.
(The makefile generates main.o from main.c not main.s -- why was main.s
included?)  As I mentioned, my version of GCC 1.40 was using an offset of
16 instead of 12, and not only in this file/function.  Anyway, I guess
what this means is that I need to take a close look at what I've done
to my GCC, rather than sending off mail to Stallman (or here).

Hello!!

Thanks again to the programmmers who put so much effort into this
real *nix system!

I've recently pulled down the gcc and tried installing it.  Unfortunately I've 
been getting errors about it not being able to find its binaries.  I tried
creating soft links to the files with the gcc- prefix and that helped some,
but now I'm getting similar errors regarding as and ld.

Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.

Put gcc in /usr/bin or some other easily ascessible place, put all the

I've been seeing this question a lot, so I'll pull in something from the
soon to be released (I hope!) FAQ list:  (People are working hard on it,
behind the scenes....)

						- Ted

   QUESTION: I've got all the things on site ??? but I don't know what
   goes where.

   ANSWER: include.tar.Z goes to /usr/include; ggcbin.tar.Z goes in
   /usr/local/lib except gcc which goes in /usr/local/bin. Moreover each
   gcc-xxx of /usr/local/lib should be linked with gxxx and xxx in
   /usr/local/bin.
   system.tar.Z contains the latest sources of the system files (mkswap,
   mkfs, fsck and fdisk). utils.tar.Z contains a new tar to handle the
   symbolic links, make, uemacs and minor programs (sed,...).

Rather than just hacking in /proc, it would be better to implement
a complete "file system switch" abstraction in the kernel, and
rewrite the existing disk file system in terms of that.  Then
when the time comes to add things like (say) NFS, it will be much
easier.

One might obtain inspiration for how to structure such a file
system abstraction from, say, the BSD sources (vnodes) or
the Plan 9 papers.

Roughly speaking, most such abstractions include at least:

	reading and writing bytes (of course)
	reading and writing "stat" information
	name to internal filehandle conversion (namei--
		in BSD, probably System V, and Plan 9,
		the abstraction usually provides a
		"walk one path component" operation)
	deleting names
	renaming names
	making hard links

Then access to file systems could go through a "file system
switch" table, in much the same way that access to devices
is vectored through a device table.  (In fact, in Plan 9
they have eliminated all such tables except the file system
switch, and all device drivers implement file systems.)

Well, once you have tasted the feeling of the real Vi, there's no clone
that can sitasfy you. Anyway, maybe I'l test myself on It.

P.S Is there anyone working on a porting on zterm ?
I managed to make it work on Linux, but due to latest things, and since
Andy Tanenbaum wrote ( at least the original term ) for Minix I want to
rewrite it from scratch.

How about elvis, a vi clone?  Here's an excerpt from the man page
for my MS-DOS verision:

     Many other people have  worked  to  port  elvis  to  various
     operating  systems.   To  see  who  deserves credit, run the
     :version command from within elvis, or look in  the  system-
     specific section of the complete documentation.


I don't have the skills to port this, but I KNOW that someone out
there does.

No, init/main.s is being compiled correctly.  I think you're forgetting
about the return address.  (If it wasn't being compiled correctly, my
kernel wouldn't be able to boot; and I *know* printf works in
init/main.c :-)

This is what the stack looks like just before the call to vsprintf:
The stack here is growing downwards:

	argn		|
	...		| These arguments pushed onto the 
	arg0		| stack by the caller
	fmt		|
	return addr	| pushed on the stack by the call to printk
	%ebx		| push %ebx
	&arg0		| push of leal 12(%esp)
	fmt		| push of 12(%esp)
	_printbuf	| push $_printbuf

At this point a call of vsprintf(printbuf, fmt, args) happens.

Is it using an offset of 16 with no other push calls?  Is the assembler
code otherwise identical?  Or is some other register being saved, like
%ebp?  (Not that it should be mucking with the frame pointer anyway,
since it should be able to use a register to save the variable i instead
of needing to allocate space on the stack for it.)

Perhaps your Minix GCC doesn't handle omit-frame-pointer; the GCC 1.40
distributed with Linux certainly works correctly with it.  It should be
fine to remove it; -fomit-frame-pointer just makes the resulting
assembler a little bit more tighter and efficient, at the cost of making
the code less debugable.  But we don't have a kernel debugger right now
anyway, so we might as well make the code fast.  :-)

It works just like the normal time command.  I'd like to add it to the

Before you write any of the small utilities, it might behoove you to try
look at the GNU(*) utilities to see if someone has already written a freely
distributable version of a command.  For example, there is a GNU time
program which already has been written.  (And, like most GNU programs,
it suffers from acute featuritis  :-)  See below for where to find the
GNU programs....

>It works just like the normal time command.  I'd like to add it to the

Right now, there is no "standard distribution";  just upload it to the
FTP sites, and announce it to the newsgroup once it's been made
available via FTP.  Someone chaotic, but Linux has been changing to fast
for people to put together "standard distributions".  I expect this will
change once more features are added and it finally leaves beta release.

>Second, it seems all of the fields in 'rusage' are returned zero

>programmer.

Yes, this is correct.  Linux currently isn't keeping track of those
statistics.  I just passed them back in the rusage structure so that
once we do add those features to the kernel, people won't need to
recompile their programs.  But right now, yes, they're all zero.

>Third, can these little pesky utilities be found in source code
>somewhere, or do we have to write them all ourselves?

Most of the sources to the Linux-specific programs (mkfs, fsck, etc.)
are on the Linux FTP sites: (nic.funet.fi, tsx-11.mit.edu,
tupac-amaru.informatik.rwth-aachen.de).  Most of the "regular" programs
(cp, mv, gcc, etc.) are from the GNU distribution.  They can be found
vai FTP from prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu.  Most of the Unix utilities that
you'll be looking for will be bundled up in one of these packages:
file-utils, text-utils, shell-utils, and bin-utils.  

(*) GNU stands for GNU's Not Unix, which (besides being a recursive
acronym) is a project started by the Free Software Foundation (the FSF)
to write a freely distributable version of Unix.  The GNU kernel is
named HURD, and is based on Mach.  It is currently being written, and is
not yet done.  Many of the GNU utilities, however, are completed and are
much more functional than the original Unix utilities.  Since they are
freely available, Linux is using them as well.

Hi all,

I was wondering what the legal point of view is on compiling minix commands
on linux, and then later putting the entire source out on a linux archive.
Commands like tty.c and date.c seem to compile ok.  But is it a no-no to
copy the source to a linux archive because it came on the minix diskettes?

Hello everyone, I have read some of the articles in this group with great 
interest.

I am a non-technical user who has a non-science background.  Essentially,
I play around in UNIX and DOS environments learning through trial and
error.

Right now I have access to both a 286 and a 386 and would love to try linux,
but I have a few questions I was hoping could be addressed:

1) Are there instructions in how to install it?  I mean, is there a file
   with a basic installation procedure that doesn't require a CS degree
   to understand?

2) How would this operate in an OS/2 environment?

3) What kind of applications would this open to me?  After all, I don't
   write my own programs (though I intend to learn C &/or Pascal at some
   point) and don't use unix for much more than a communication gateway
   in emacs.

Even if two and three don't look very good for me, I'm sure I'll give this
a shot.  

Thanks!

Is anyone working on a dos device driver that can access (albeit minimal)
linux fs files?

I've tried compiling mtools, but it wants a device[s] to be defined in
devices.c.  Can anyone send me a sample of drives defined in this module?

Someone asked about backing up there system with tar and multiple volumes.

I've found it very useful to have 2 hd-partitions with linux root image.
I can boot from either one, and mount the other on /mnt (or something)
to access the files on it.  I normally boot from hd1 and on regular basis
mirror hd1 to hd2 with cp.  I also keep a compressed tar copy of hd1 on
hd2 which is still less then 5meg (the tar file).

If you can afford a 10 meg partition, it'll make a great backup device
as opposed to dealing with floppies.

Surely not.  In your /etc/rc, instead of the line

			> /etc/mtab

change it to
		echo "/dev/hd? /" > /etc/mtab

where the ? is the hard drive that is your root partition.  This also 'fixes'
mount returning nothing if you only have your root partition mounted.

Hi Linuxers!

The originall FAQ 1st version was posted in Dec. 19, by Robert Blum, 
I've just changed some little things. As Robert seems to be out
" J'ai repris le fambeau"
Do not flame on me if I walk on anybody toes, just let me know.

The Question/answer modified (even sligthly) have been marked with (-)
The New one have been marked (+).


Any way, most credits of this work to Linus, Robert and Ted the rest was on
the list posted by many (real) activists (not me ;-) 

Following is a FAQ-compilation for Linux.
Mail me, if you like it, and mail me, if you dislike it or have
any ideas on changing this.

Thanks in advance,
				Marc

PS: For the future i plan to do sections in the FAQ to make it more readable

=====================================8<=====8<===============================
QUESTION: What is linux?

ANSWER: Linux is a small unix for 386-AT computers, that has the added
advantage of being free. It is still in beta-testing, but is slowly
getting useful even for somewhat real developement.
The current version is 0.12 still in Beta-test, date: Jan. 14th 1992.

   LINUX 0.12 is a freely distributable UNIX clone.  It implements a
subset of System V and POSIX functionality.  LINUX has been written
from scratch, and therefore does not contain any AT&T or MINIX
code--not in the kernel, the compiler, the utilities, or the libraries.
For this reason it can be made available with the complete source code
via anonymous FTP.  LINUX runs only on 386/486 AT-bus machines; porting
to non-Intel architectures is likely to be difficult, as the kernel
makes extensive use of 386 memory management and task primitives.

(+)QUESTION: I've just heard about linux, what should I do to get it?

ANSWER: First read all this FAQ, and the INFO-SHEET monthly post, then 
go to the nearest ftp site (see below),
download the Images there are two a rootimage and a bootimage (in
general in the images directory), download the INSTALL file. Find the 
rawrite utility (for example at tsx-11 it's in /pub/linux/INSTALL), 
then rawrite the images on high density floppies (5.25 or 
3.5), finally boot on the root diskett and that's it.

(-)QUESTION: Does it run on my computer?

ANSWER: Linux has been written on a clone-386, with IDE drives and a VGA
screen. It should work on most similar setups. The harddisk should be
AT-standard, and the system must be ISA. 
A high density floppy drive -- either 5".25 or 3".5

Otherwise
the requirements seem relatively small: a 386 (SX, DX or any 486). 
Any video card of the following: Hercules, CGA, EGA, (S)VGA.


It needs at least 2M to run, and 4M is definitely a plus. It can happily
use up to 16M (and more if you change some things).


QUESTION: Will linux run on a PC or 286-AT? If not, why?

ANSWER: Linux uses the 386 chip protected mode functions extensively,
and is a true 32-bit operating system. Thus x86 chips, x<3, will simply
not run it.

(+)QUESTION: How big is the 'complete' Linux package?

ANSWER: Well, the boot and root image disketts are about 750k compressed.  The
kernel sources are about 200k compressed, and the libc sources are
another 170k compressed.  The GNU C compiler is 670k, and the other
miscellaneous unix utilities are probably a bit over a megabyte.


Now add sources to whatever you want to port and compile yourself.  The
sources to GNU emacs are about 3 megabytes, compressed.  Groff (a troff
replacement) is just over 1 megabyte.

If you think this is big, remember that the OS/2 2.0 Limited Availability
release is 20 1.44 megabyte diskettes.

(+)QUESTION: Since how long does linux exist?

ANSWER (partial): Few months, v0.10 went out in Nov. 91, v0.11 in Dec.
and the current version 0.12 is available since Jan. 14th 92

(+)QUESTION: What's about the copywright of linux.

ANSWER: In the previous release, Linux was copyrighted by Linus
Torvalds but free. The copyright will change  (v0.12) to follows
the same set of rules as the GNU copyleft.


(+)QUESTION: Should I be a UNIX and/or a DOS wizard to install/use Linux?

ANSWER: Not at all, just follow the install rules. Right now Linux is used by 
more than 400 persons, very few of them enhance the kernel, some adds/ports
new soft and most of us are only (but USEFUL) beta testers. So join us and
choose ur "cast"

(+)QUESTION: Is Linux better than Minix386 ?

ANSWER (partial): It depends on what u're looking for, Linux is free Minix 
is not; Minix is ported on many architecture Linux not.


(-)QUESTION: Does linux do paging? Can I have virtual memory on my small
machine?

ANSWER: Linux0.12 does do paging, but it's pretty rudimentary. It's even 
more beta than the rest of linux. How it selects which page to be thrown 
out of memory is particularly primitive. It is there though and it does 
appear to work

QUESTION: Can I have tasks spanning the full 4GB of addressable 386
memory? No more 64kB limits like in coherent or standard minix?

ANSWER: Linux does limit the task-size, but at a much more reasonable
64MB (MEGA-byte, not kilos), so bigger programs are no problem.


QUESTION: Does the bigger program sizes mean I can run X?

ANSWER: X is not ported to linux, and though I hope it will be some day,
I cannot guarantee it. It's big, and wants a lot from the system.


(-)QUESTION: Where can I get linux? Is there a mailserver?

ANSWER: Linux can be gotten by anonymous ftp from 
	nic.funet.fi (128.214.6.100):
		directory /pub/OS/Linux
	Tupac-Amaru.Informatik.RWTH-Aachen.DE (137.226.112.31):
		directory /pub/msdos/replace
	tsx-11.mit.edu (18.172.1.2):
		directory /pub/linux
	ftp.eecs.umich.edu (141.212.99.7):
		directory linux
You might want to check out which of these is the most up-to-date.

If you don't have ftp-capability, you are in trouble. You might try
mailing "mailserver@nic.funet.fi" with "help" in the body of the mail.

There are now others sites as in the UK:
        puffin.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7)

(+)QUESTION: I do not have FTP access, what can I do to get linux?

ANSWER: Try to contact a friend on the net, with those access,
otherwise contact tytso@ATHENA.MIT.EDU

(-)QUESTION: Is there a newsgroup or mailing-list about linux? Where can I
get my questions answered? How about bug-reports?

ANSWER: alt.os.linux is formed, and comp.os.linux is on the way, for
those who can't access to the news u can ask for digest to:
Linux-Activists@NEWS-DIGESTS.MIT.EDU.
Mail sent to Linux-Activists@NEWS-DIGESTS.MIT.EDU are posted to alt.os.linux

DO NOT mail "I want to [un]subscribe" to the mailing-list/news, 
use the request-address. IF not ur mail-box will be over-crowded by activists.

Questions and bug-reports can be sent either to the mailing-list or to
"torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi", depending on which you find more
appropriate.



QUESTION: How can I be sure I won't be writing over anything important?
I have to use DOS in on my machine, and I don't want to lose any files.

ANSWER: Back up everything. Just in case. Then, write some easily
recognizable pattern to the partition you have reserved for linux, using
some DOS tool. You can then use "cat /dev/hdX" under linux to examine
which of the partitions you used.


(-)QUESTION: Linux mkfs doesn't accept the size I give the device, although
I double-checked with fdisk, and it's correct.

ANSWER: Be sure you give the size in BLOCKS, ie 1024 bytes, not sectors.
Also, make doubly certain that you have the correct partition.


There are a few rules about this: /dev/hd0 and /dev/hd5 are always the
same under linux and minix.  DO NOT USE THEM, they are the whole raw
disk, not partitions. Also if a partition is on drive 1 under minix (ie
/dev/hd1-4), it is drive 1 under linux as well.
Moreover, there is no real consensus on whether partition #1 is the first
partition on the disk, or is the first entry in the partition
table.  Some parition programs sort this information on the
screen only, some will write the sorted information back to the
hard disk.  Linux assumes that the first entry is hd1, and so
if some utility starts sorting/reordering the table these things
can change.
REMARK Minix does some reordering.

A useful hack is to make each of your partitions a different size.
Then after any editting or possible change to the partition table
you can boot a floppy system and run fdisk (linux's, not DOS) to
see if the assignments still hold.


QUESTION: I mounted the linux filesystem, and copied the files from the
root-disk to the harddisk. Now I cannot find them any more, and
somethimes linux dies with a "panic: trying to free unused inode".

ANSWER: You have probably forgot to sync before rebooting. Linux, like
all unices, use a "buffer cache" to speed up reads and writes to disk.
On a machine that has enough memory, this buffer-cache is 1.5MB, and if
you forget to sync before exiting, it may not be fully written out to
disk. Re-mkfs and re-install (or try to use the preliminary fsck, but
remeber that although fsck tries to correct the faults it finds, it may
fail.)

(+)QUESTION: Is it possible to access to DOS world from Linux

ANSWER: Yes, there is the mtools package (with patches for devices.c)

QUESTION: the mtools package  won't work. I get an ENOENT error
message for all devices.

ANSWER: mtools needs to be told which device to look for. Use 'ln' or
'mknod' to create a sepcial file called "/dev/dosX", where X is A, B,
C, X or Y. A and B are for floppies (12 bits), C is for hard disk and
X, Y for any. This file should point to the device you want to read.


(-)QUESTION:  Turbo (Microsoft) Assembler won't compile the Linux boot code.
In fact, some of the opcodes in these files look completely unfamiliar.  Why?

ANSWER:  The Linux boot codes are written in Bruce Evans' minix assembler,
which has the same opcodes as the original minix assembler ported to
linux get as86.tar.Z
Anyway there are a few differences between these and normal DOS assemblers:

 - No segments - everything is in the same segment (at least in the
   bootsectors and setup, as they don't use the .data segments)

 - mov[b|w|l] are shorter versions of mov ax,[byte|word|long] ptr [XXX].
   This is how unix assemblers normally give the size (byte, word or long).
   Gas has similar constructs.

 - There is no "jmp short", the opcodes are "j" for a short jump and
   "jmp" for a long one.

 - "jmpi" is a jump with a segment:offset pair. I don't know how this is
   written in DOS assembly.


QUESTION:  While running du I get "Kernel panic: free_inode: bit already 
cleared".  Also, du produces a ENOENT error for all the files in certain
of my directories.  What's going on?

(-)ANSWER:  These are both consistent with a bad file-system. 
That's relatively 
easy to produce by not syncing before rebooting, as linux usually has 1.5MB
of buffer space held in memory (unless you have <=4M RAM, in which case
the buffers are only about 0.5MB). Also linux doesn't do anything
special about the bit-map blocks, and as they are used often, those are
the thing most likely to be in memory. If you reboot, and they haven't
been written to disk ...

Just do an fsck on the device, the -a flag might repair it otherwise,
the only thing to do is to reinstall the filesystem from the Images.


A sync is done only every 30 seconds normally (standard unix practice),
so do one by hand (some people think you should do 3 syncs after each
other, but that's superstition), or by logging out from the
startup-shell, which automatically syncs the system. Unmounting a
filesystem also syncs it (but of course you can never unmount root).

Another (sad) possibility is that you have bad blocks on your disk. Not
very probable, as they would have to be in the inode-tables, just a
couple of blocks in size. Again there aren't programs available to read
a disk for bad sectors and put them in some kind of "bad-sector-file".
On IDE drives this is no problem (bad sectors are automatically mapped
away).


(+)QUESTION: I've got all the things on site ??? but I don't know what
goes where.

ANSWER: include.tar.Z goes to /usr/include; ggcbin.tar.Z goes in
/usr/local/lib except gcc which goes in /usr/local/bin. Moreover each
gcc-xxx of /usr/local/lib should be linked with gxxx and xxx in
/usr/local/bin.
system.tar.Z contains the latest sources of the system files (mkswap,
mkfs, fsck and fdisk). In version 0.12 utilbin.tar.Z has been replaced
by fileutil.tar.Z and utils.tar.Z which contains a new tar to handle the
symbolic links, make, uemacs and minor programs (sed,...).
Other utilities have been ported separately.

QUESTION:  What is the "em" binary?

ANSWER:  Em is micro-EMacs (probably version 3.10).

(+)QUESTION: It seems that $#@! ported on linux don't run correctly

ANSWER: Possible, but check first if the size of ur file corresponds to the 
one on the ftp sites, if it is then do a complete report of the error,
try to correct it.

(+)QUESTION: Does anyone port this to linux?, if not i'll compile it

ANSWER: First check on the sites, have a look to the info-sheet monthly
post and also available on sites. Have a look in the "old" digest files
and mail-archives of linux-activists, these are kept at least at tsx-11 
and nic possibly at tupac. Ask then on the list/news.

(+)QUESTION: I want to port *** to Linux, what are the flags?

ANSWER: Recall that Linux implements subset of SYSV and POSIX, so -DUSG and
-DPOSIX work in general. Moreover throw away most of the ld flags such as
-termcap, -g.

(+)QUESTION: Linux lacks on ****/ Linux has a bug in ***, what are the 
rules to enhance/correct the kernel?

ANSWER: Before anything check if some one else is working on that subject,
contact those people. Test  ur improvment (it should work is NOT enough), 
then send the patches in cdiffs form to Linus and/or the list, moreover 
the localization must be clear. This does NOT mean that bug-reports and 
patches are not accepted.

QUESTION: I seem to be unable to compile anything with gcc. Why?

ANSWER: If you have only 2 MB RAM, gcc will die silently without compiling
	anything. You must have at least 4 MB to do compilations  

(-)QUESTION:  I'm using a program that uses signal handlers which are installed
using sigaction() with the SA_NOMASK, and they get a general protection
error right after the signal handler tries to return.  What's going
wrong? 

ANSWER:  You are using a libc.a that has an out-of-date signal.o and
sig_restore.o file, and they don't know how to deal with SA_NOMASK.
(The one in gccbin.tar.Z is out-of-date). Get the new libc.a and put
it in /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib  


QUESTION: gcc complains about not finding crt0.o and the system include files
What am i doing wrong ?

ANSWER: The include files normal place is in /usr/include. libc.a and *.a 
should be in /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib


(+)QUESTION: While compiling some GNU packages gcc chocs on
regex.c with an insn code, what can i do?

ANSWER: There is a little bug in the port of gcc, this will be corrected
on the port of v2.0 (with g++). Right now thraw away the -O flag and
every thing will be alright.

(+)QUESTION: I can't move directories under Linux, why ?, what can I do?

ANSWER: mvdir needs kernel resources which don't exist yet.
The reason the rename system call isn't implemented yet is that there are a
couple of problems with it: it isn't as straightforward as you'd
imagine. Race conditions, inclusion checking etc..

It will befinitely be in 0.13 or 14 - if you remind me. It's not /that/
difficult, just needs a little thought. In the meantime, you might fake
it with "cp +recursive" and "rm -rf". Be careful with that though..

This also appears to be the reason why mv's of sym links do not
work properly.



(+)QUESTION: I've read that linux has virtual consoles, what must i do to
get them?

ANSWER: Yes there are, u can access them with the left <alt>-key
together with <Fn>-key. But first u have to activate them with
doshell /dev/ttyn /bin/sh &
where n is the number of the Virtual console.
BTW: the serial ports are now /dev/tty64 and /dev/tty65. tty0 is the general 
console. tty128- are reserved to pty's

(+)QUESTION: What are the editors available in linux

ANSWER: Right know there are uemacs and elvis-1.4, some one (R. Blum)
is working on that, and some one else is working on emacs 18.57

(+)QUESTION: du seems buggy when i used it the number of disk
occupation is wrong.

ANSWER: Take care, if u want size in kbytes use the -k flags.

(+)QUESTION: Is there only the %$#@ keyboard ?

ANSWER: There are Finnish, French, German, UK, and US keyboards. 
Set it in linux/kernel/chr_drv/keyboard.S, then compile the kernel
again.

(+)QUESTION: What must I do to mkfs a floppy?

ANSWER: blocks are of size 1K so 1.44 floppy is 1440 blocks

(+)QUESTION: What are the device minor/major numbers?

ANSWER: (early Linus mail 06/11/91, updated Jan. 19 92)
		Memory devices: Major = 1 (characted devices)
minor
0	/dev/ram 
1	/dev/mem 
2	/dev/kmem - not implemented (easy, but I haven't done it)
3	/dev/null
4	/dev/port (implemented, but untested - don't play with it)

example: "mknod /dev/null c 1 3"


		Floppy disks: Major = 2 (block devices)

minor = drive + 4*type, drive = 0,1,2,3 for A,B,C or D-diskette

type	1: 360kB floppy in 360kB drive (5.25")
	2: 1.2M floppy in 1.2M drive (5.25")
	3: 360kB floppy in 720kB/1.44Mb drive (3.5")
	4: 720kB floppy in 720kB/1.44Mb drive (3.5")
	5: 360kB floppy in 1.2M drive (5.25")
	6: 720kB floppy in 1.2M drive (5.25")
	7: 1.44M floppy in 1.44M drive (3.5")

Thus minor nr for a 1.44Mb floppy in B is: 1 + 4*7 = 29, and to read an
old 360kB floppy in a 1.2M A-drive you need to use minor= 0 + 4*5 = 20.

Example: "mknod /dev/PS0 b 2 28" (b for block: 2 for floppy, 28 for 1.44
in A)


		Hard disks: Major = 3 (block devices)
minor
0	/dev/hd0 - The whole hd0, including partition table sectors etc.
1	/dev/hd1 - first partition on hd0
....
4	/dev/hd4 - fourth partition on hd0
5	/dev/hd5 - The whole hd1, again including partition table info
6	/dev/hd6 - first partition on hd1
....
9	/dev/hd9 - fourth partition on hd1

NOTE! Be /very/ careful with /dev/hd0 and /dev/hd5 - you seldom need
them, and if you write to them you can destroy the partition tables:
something you probably don't want.
The only things that use /dev/hd0 are things like "fdisk" etc.

NOTE 2!! The names for hd's are the same as under minix, but I think
minix orders the partitions in some way (so that the partition numbers
will be in the same order as the partitions are physically on the disk).
Linux doesn't order anything: it has the partitions in the same order as
in the partition table (ie /dev/hd1 might be physically after /dev/hd2).

			Tty's: Major = 4 (character devices)
minor
0	/dev/tty0 	- general console
1 - 63			- reserved for virtual console
64-127			- reserved for serial io
128-			- reserved for pty's

And more particularly we have:
64	/dev/tty64 	- com1
65	/dev/tty65 	- com2

Yes, this is a no-no.  Minix is copyrighted.  Linux is copyrighted, but
freely redistributable.  This is not the case with Minix.  Even putting
the binaries of Minix- or AT&T- derived sources is illegal, without
explicit permission from the copyright holders.
