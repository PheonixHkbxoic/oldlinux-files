I agree. As you say, this would decrease the overall size of the source 
code, the resulting binary, and mean when one code chunk is fixed , 
it fixes all related routines.

I have done this with the scsi drivers, isolating everything that can be
shared among st.c and sd.c to scsi.c, have a single read / write 
interrupt routine in sd.c, READ / WRITE are in the same place, and 
only change the opcode byte of the SCSI command, and the lowlevel drivers
are responsible for as little possible, simplifying there code.

As someone mentioned a while back, it would be convenient to
be able to use floppies with non-standard formats, to get more
stuff on them.  I've just done some experimenting, with only
very partial success.  To access 3 1/2" hd floppies formatted
by the msdos program Fdformat v.18 with 82 tracks, 21 sectors
per track, I changed an entry in the table of types in
floppy.c, the later table with block sizes, and the "18" to "21"
in the declaration of the track buffer in floppy.c and head.s.
I put 0x0C for the gap length.

I can make a file system, store and retrieve files ok, but
the drive mutters a lot, files consume over twice the space
they do on the hard disk, and I can't unmount the device
after having used it.

What am I missing?  I haven't done anything about the sector
interleaving of 2 which, according to the Fdformat document
is necessary because "sectors are used as gaps".

it seems to work ok (in 0.95), though it's pretty slow.  Mtools can read

You said it.  It is a familiar structure.  It is the structure which 
most standard distributions are set up to live within - you get 
a program off of the net, make config, then make install,
by default man pages end up in /usr/man, and depending on
the program binaries / libraries in /usr/bin /usr/lib or /usr/local/*.  

As Linux becomes more standard, Joe User is going to go, see something 
on his "real" Unix machines, say "Gee, this is cool," go out on the 
net, get the source, and build under Linux.  If everything, including
the install, works as is out of the box, this is simpler.

Do you work under both Berkeley, SYSV, AIX?  Berkely has /etc/rc,
SYSV has /etc/inittab.  The printer configurations can be different,
command names, syntaxes, config file formats, etc.  It is a real nuisance
to have to remember all of these, plus the different Berkely dirivatives 
(Xinu BSD, Ultrix, SunOS), AT&T dirivatices (SunOS, IRIX), 
etc.  And these directory layouts are basically the same. If they weren't,
things would be even more heinous.  

I'd like linux to be as close to what I know as possible.  If not, that's
a strike against an otherwise excellent operating system.

Yes, Linux is neat for playing with new ideas.  The dependance of 
the kernel on the 386 architecture allows a lot of coding shortcuts.
Shared libraries that are not dynamically linked give you reduced
memory usage, but without added overhead in exec()
for linker code.  But these are implementation issues, and have 
nothing to do with how the user sees the system.

mount, fsck, umount, init, belong in /etc like all other sysadmin
things, as they are on "normal" Unix machines.  Hard drives should be 
labeled as /dev/hdXY where X is the drive number, 0 based, 
and Y is the partition.  Normally, partition c would be the whole
drive, partition g /usr, partition a root, etc.  As far as the 
interface, we should move to something POSIX, or Berkely, or SYSV,
but something standard.

Other than that, I'm happy with my setup because it looks like Unix,
runs programs like Unix, acts like Unix,  goes easy on resources 
(This is relative, of course), and is easy to hack.

 A thousand pardons.  To tell the truth, I was so happy about finding 
a host that accepted posts that I forgot to think about most of what 
I was saying :^>

 I have, however, gotten mail about one other point - my comment about
needing a small, generic mtools on the root image.  The difficulty seems
to be (and, I assume, the reason no one has posted a mtools binary 
anywhere) is that the device database in devices.c needs to be set up 
specifically for each machine.  My thought was to create a small version
of mread, mwrite and mcopy with a generic database of reduced size.  
To limit the size we could, say, use only drive floppy drive A and limit
ourselves to high-density disks, the type most likely to be found in the
386's that Linux runs on.  That way we'd only need to have entries for
at most four disk types in the database.

Am I completely off-base with this?  Am I forgetting/overlooking 
something?


Thanks for tolerating me, everyone. :-)

I know how it goes.  I was just pointing out that the development of
Linux is going so rapidly, that something that is missing now will
likely be filled in quickly.  A case in point is rdev - rootdev
appeared on the 0.95 root floppy, and within a few days someone built
a better mousetrap that modified boot images as well.  Not bad, I
think.

> I have, however, gotten mail about one other point - my comment about

I don't see mtools as being necessary, at all.  If you want to
transfer files from DOS to Linux, get rawrite.exe and rawrite tar
files to diskettes, and then read those with tar under Linux.  The
only possible advantage of mtools is that it can access DOS hard drive
partitions, but I personally wouldn't trust it to do so.

As a result, you won't see mtools on the 0.95a root floppy.  It would,
however, be great if someone took the time to make a mtools.tar.Z that
came with a good README.linux and a sample devices.c, so those that
felt a need for mtools could compile it easily.  The currently
available ones are a bit tricky to set up, and require a bit of
guesswork in devices.c.

>Am I completely off-base with this?  Am I forgetting/overlooking 
>something?

I wouldn't say you're off base, but I think you're tackling the issue
from the wrong side.  I don't think Linux should be forced to read DOS
devices - I think DOS should write things that Linux can read.

Tar is already on the root floppy because it is a 'standard' Unix
tool.  We should make use of that rather than try and jam more onto
the already-crowded root floppy.

Then again, if someone writes a DOS file system for Linux, this
discussion would be pointless.  I'd rather see a faster file system
for Linux, first, though, to replace the brain-dead Minix one.  I need
room for more descriptive filenames like bc-1.02.bin.tar.Z and
bc-1.02.src.tar.Z.

Well, I use Mtools all the time. I have excellent communication programs
for DOS, which I can't say about Linux. As a result, I do most of my
downloading under DOS. I also keep most of the packed Linux stuff in
a DOS partition, because it's such a pain to fool around with rawrite,
tar and a bunch of floppies. It is MUCH easier to type
'mtype foo_tar.z | tar xz', which unpacks a .tar.Z file straight from
the DOS partition and in no time at all.

I don't see why you have to try and pack everything on the root floppy
in the first place. It is my impression that the root floppy is mostly
useful only for getting a root file system onto the hard disk. Period.
Why not make a third distribution image, which has all the best tools
on it: tar, un/compress, mtools, bash, the works? After you've got
your hd root file system up and running, it's a piece of cake to mount
the tool image and copy the rest of the stuff.

This is silly. I'm willing to bet that most Linux users are running
a hybrid system, with both DOS and Linux on it. In such a system there
will always be a lot of data shuttling back and forth between the two.
In my opinion, we should go for the most convenient way to do things,
which at the moment is Mtools, without doubt. I don't expect anyone will
write anything compareable for DOS anytime soon...

I for one don't want to put up with unnecessary contortions just because
it's 'standard' Unix. I agree that the root floppy shouldn't contain
any unnecessary stuff, though.

I agree. If someone wants to write DOS file system for Linux, I won't
kick up a fuss, but it really isn't important, not urgent.

Yes, this is a pretty major weakness of Linux - Kermit and Pcomm are
nice, but they simply aren't up to the standards of most of the DOS
terminal programs.  Of course, I've gone the opposite route as you and
just learned to 'deal with it'.  I miss my old term program in a way,
but I've found I can get just as much done using kermit or xc (another
term program that I've been working on porting).

I was responding to people who suggested mtools be on the root floppy,
who apparently think everything needs to be on the root floppy.  :)

>It is my impression that the root floppy is mostly

That's my goal, too.  That means getting something like pfdisk on the
root floppy is more important to me than mtools.

A third distribution image would be nice, but would go against trying
to keep the distribution small - some people are not going to want to
download 3 megs just to install an experimental operating system.
That's why I'd like to get as much as possible, and as much as
necessary, on one root disk.  Tar and compress are important enough
that definitely deserve to be on there....

>This is silly. I'm willing to bet that most Linux users are running

As am I.  But, the only reason I still have DOS around is for business
purposes - I still have to do some programming under DOS.

>In such a system there will always be a lot of data shuttling back and 
>forth between the two.

Are you sure?  The last time I moved anything from DOS -> Linux was
probably the 0.12 kernel, and I'm sure there are also others that are
making the transition away from DOS, just as many people have moved
away from Minix.

>In my opinion, we should go for the most convenient way to do things,

But remember, not even mtools is that easy to configure and set up to
use the hard drive.  rawrite and tar work 'out of the box.'

>I for one don't want to put up with unnecessary contortions just because

I'm glad we're agreed on this.  It's too bad some people aren't.

>I agree. If someone wants to write DOS file system for Linux, I won't
>kick up a fuss, but it really isn't important, not urgent.

I wouldn't say it's not important, but it's not urgent.  I think it
would be nice to find something more flexible than mtools, which I
think a DOS filesystem would be.  Then you aren't limited by the set
of tools that mtools gives you.

Also, keep in mind in all this that I'm not saying mtools shouldn't
even exist for Linux - that'd be silly.  I'm just saying that it is
not important enough to be on the root floppy.  If people want to use
mtools, they'll only have to use rawrite three times in their life.
(Root floppy, boot floppy, and mtools.tar!)

I agree;  I have included an MSDOS extended version of Linus's 'edit'

It is overkill, but is an attempt to help someone who is just starting.

The official documentation is rather vague about the extended partitions
scheme: warnings that it should be used with caution have little
effect if we don't know how to implement it.  Should there be
a special partition code in the primary partition table to indicate
a linux-style extended partition?  How does the extended partition
indicate its own parts?  How do we set it up and test it?

   If you feed uncompress a corrupt file it goes mad, eating up all
   memory. This is true for uncompress in general, not only the Linux
   version.

That's true.  The difference is that on other systems, accesses to
memory that's clearly not part of the text or data segment will result
in a Segementation Violation.  Linux does not have that concept down
yet; if you access a non-existent page, it will map in a zero-filled
page for you.  It doesn't first check to see if it's reasonable for that
page to exist or not.  Therefore, it takes longer for uncompress on
Linux dies a slow painful death when you feed it a corrupt file, where
as on other systems it dies a quick one.  :-)

   1) Organize the ftp sites such there are different subtrees for different
      releases of linux.

The problem with this suggestion is that there are many things which
will work for multiple releases, and it's painful to have to do figure
out what should be considered Linux 0.12, or 0.13, or 0.11..... for
example, the gcc which I have been using up until very recently was the
original GCC compiler that was released for 0.10.  

It doesn't make sense to ask each FTP site maintainer to make their own
judgements about what binary works for which version of Linux.  I (at
the very least) do not have that kind of time on my hands.

I do recognize the need for what you are requesting, and I have been
pinning my hopes on the "ABC Release" of Linux, which will hopefully
have everything bundled up for people to use.  There will still be a
place for the more chaotic and concontrolled method of FTP distribution,
for people who are willing to live on the bleeding edge of technology.
But for most people, the "ABC Release" should make it much easier to put
together a release.  

Of course, I suspect that the "ABC Release" will lag a bit when compared
to Linus's release of the sources, but if you're really impatient, you
can either do it yourself or pay someone enough money that they feel
like doing it for you on your schedule.  Keep in mind, Linux is free
software, and that means is that while suggesting that someone might
want to do *X* can be productive, demanding that people to do things
just because it makes things more convenient for *you*, at possibly
great time and effort for *them*, doesn't necessarily go over very well.

There is a bug in ptrace as supplied in 0.95.  Arount line 110 where 
the address is computed should be as given below.  The mistakes were
in the first line the mask was 0xffff000 and the shift was 8, and
in the third line addr was not added.  Sorry for any problems.

Also I've created a primitive kernel configuration system.  I
uploaded it to tsx-11.mit.edu, so it should be available soon.
(Of course with 0.95a comming out, everything will need to be
changed.)

	Ross Biro bir7@leland.stanford.edu 

  /* Now compute the address, and make sure that it is present. */
  address = ((task[tsk]->ldt[seg].a & 0xffff0000) >> 16) |
            ((task[tsk]->ldt[seg].b & 0xff) << 16 ) |
	    (task[tsk]->ldt[seg].b & 0xff000000) + addr;

  page = *((unsigned long*) ((address >> 20) & 0xffc));

this construct will work, but the <xxx>xxx doesn't help, since
rz neither reads or writes standard i/o.  standard i/o behaves

To use sz & rz, do the following:

bin$ kermit
(Kermit startup message)
KERMIT> connect
(dial & login)
remote$ sz file1 file2 file3
(type CTRL-"\" "C" to escape to Kermit)
KERMIT> (type CTRL-Z to suspend Kermit)

bin$ rz &  # runs rz in the background

This transmits file1-3 from the remote host to my Linux machine.

typing "rz" at the remote host and "sz f1 f2 f3 &" on the local
machine sends files to the remote host.

The name of the modem is compiled into rz & sz.  I named the device
/dev/modem, which is a link to (in my case) /dev/tty66.

Good luck,

>I see you are actually using ka9q - where do you get SL/IP for Linux from
>(I take it it is that what you are using.)

Huh?  KA9Q is an implementation of TCP/IP, which includes SLIP.  Thus
it is SL/IP for Linux.  I'm not sure what you are asking.  If you want
to know where KA9Q is, it's in athos.rutgers.edu:/pub/linux.  I'll be
doing another minor release once 0.95 stabilizes.  It has "ip stat"
report statistics on SLIP and header compression, and has an option to
adjust the timeout on the main select call (a very minor performance
tweak, useful primarily for debugging).  I'll upload that release to
tsx-11.  (Actually, if the tsx-11 mavens wanted to look at /pub/linux
I wouldn't complain.)

This is a very old version of KA9Q, before NOS.  However I've
retrofitted compressed SLIP, some minimal domain support, and a few of
the recent TCP protocol improvements.  I use it with a Cisco terminal
server, but SLIP support is available for a variety of other systems.
(Unfortunately I don't know where.)

The problem with using it under 0.12 is that you need 2 or 3 kernel
patches (all of which are in the same directory: You definitely need
nonblock.tar.Z and select.patch, and you probably want serial-hang,
though whether you need it seems to depend somewhat upon your serial
controller chip.)  SLIP basically works under 0.12 with these patches,
but there are performance problems, because the kernel tends to lose
characters on the serial line.

Under 0.95 no kernel patches seem to be needed, however until Linus
releases his fixed-up 0.95 (0.96?  0.95a?), there are going to be
performance problems that cause display to be choppy.  In fact KA9Q
can be used as a workaround for one of the bugs in 0.95: the TCP
checksum detects the problem reported earlier with characters getting
interchanged, so telnet sessions may work better than kermit sessions.
But that assumes that you find 0.95 usable otherwise.  Based on
reports here, this seems to depend upon the details of your system.

First of all: kudos to a successful os.  I've been using linux 0.12 since
around mid January. I've just upgraded to 0.95 and gcc 1.4. 
I waited until 0.95 came out to ask a few questions because I had applied
a number of patches to 0.12 and it becomes hard to figure out if it's a
patch that's causing the problems. Ok here goes - I noticed someone mention
this problem already but I may have missed the answer:

If I try to execute Emacs shell mode this is what I get:
   
Process shell background read attempted from control tty

The status line says:
--**-Emacs: *shell*                (Shell: stop)----All----etc.....

Needless to say the shell doesn't work :-( - Any ideas??? and yes it still
occurs in 0.95!

The next problem occurs with gdb. Basically I was testing it out on a simple
program - "hello world" that also asks for character input and branches 
accordingly.  This is what gdb tells me: 

(no debugging symbols found)...
(gdb) run
Starting program: /usr/root/hello 
[ioctl TIOCSPGRP failed in terminal_inferior: Not owner]

Program received signal 21, Stopped (tty input)
0x6cc in read ()
(gdb) quit
The program is running.  Quit anyway? (y or n)y

 Gee - if root isn't the owner than who is?
 Still - linux is great and it's free so I won't complain too loudly.
 *BUT* here comes the worst part - 0.95 and gcc 1.4 has trouble compiling.
 I picked up the new linux source from tsx-11 and wanted to recompile so
 I could use ps. Well!, it mostly compiled ok except for two files:
 
 	console.c and fork.c

For both of these files I got this type of message:

gcc -Wall -O -fstrength-reduce -fomit-frame-pointer  -finline-functions -nostdin
Program  got fatal signal 436.
make[1]: *** [console.o] Error 1
make: *** [kernel/chr_drv/chr_drv.a] Error 1

The fix seems to be to remove -O from the Makefile - then it all compiles ok!
But by the time I create the Image file it's considerably larger than the
distribution (could be due to a change in optimization and 1.4 rather than
2.0 I guess):
 
tools/build boot/bootsect boot/setup tools/system /dev/hda4 > Image
Root device is (3, 4)
Boot sector 512 bytes.
Setup is 1384 bytes.
System is 217088 bytes.
sync

Booting from this Image is - well - not happening :-(
more output:

Kernel panic: Trying to free up swapper memory space

And then it just sits there - bummer.

One other thing with 0.95 - the keypad arrow keys output things like: 
^[Ox and ^[Ov rather than the usual  ^[OA and ^[OC etc.
This was another reason to recompile - maybe by changing the keyboard to US
it would change the keypad output.

Anyway - I've had no problems applying patches to 0.12 and recompiling the 
kernel. Am I doing something wrong with 0.95? Oh yeah - before I forget,

  My 2 cents on this is:   
Since Linux in still very deep in development stages, code combiming 
should be done much later on a much advanced system.  If you combine
all the code, then when something breaks
  1)  It is easier to fix when parts are separate.
  2)  Less things are effected by such a bug.

For ease of programmer (Like Linus), wait til you got it ALL working right.

Rather than one tar.Z file, I think it would be better to have a set,
each small enough to fit on a floppy.  I originally took the 0.12
boot, root and rawrite, and created a hard disk root, I then untarred
4 compressed tars, each one containing a portion of the abc-banjo
root, over the top of the initial root.  I created the 4 tars by
running the following awk script to create lists of abc-banjo files
that would fit into a less than 1.44 Mb tar.Z.  If this were augmented
with help on configuration installs  would be even easier.

Here's the awk script.  I've found it usefull for chopping up other
things I've moved to linux.  I'm short of disk space so I also use the
same script on linux to help with backups to floppy.

One thing I noticed in the upgrade from 0.12 to 0.95 is that the

They should be.  0.12 simply used the bits as an EGA attribute byte.
This resulted in a non-standard color scheme.  0.95 uses a mapping
table.  The codes now have the same values as in kermit and the ANSI
escape sequences in other OS's I've used.  Since the new values are
consistent with the rest of the world, I wouldn't think Linus would
have any reason to change them again...

Subject: NetHack 3 pl 10 now at tsx-11.
Date: 14 Mar 92 10:32:37 GMT
Organization: Wellington City Council, Wgtn, NZ

I put a binary distribution of NetHack 3 Patch Level 10 on
tsx-11.mit.edu.

    ~ftp/pub/linux/binaries/usr.games/nh3p10bin.tar.Z 

It needed fewer patches than Patch Level 6.  It plays with no visible
problems.  Thanks to Quowong P. Liu (qpliu@phoenix.princeton.edu) for
giving me a solution to the problem with screen draws on zapping and
throwing.  This posting contains a few things I forgot to put in the
readme.

The tar is called nh3p10bin.tar.Z and is 549399 bytes, and should
verify with sum (on an Ultrix-box at any rate) of 27459 537.

To untar, cd to root, and untar to create entries in /usr/games and
/usr/man/man6 (the manuals format OK with cawf).  I've included the
formatted version of the guide.  Unpacked it requires about 1.7 Megs
of disk.

You need the poe-igl login/init, and possibly other patches like
non-blocking.  I've lost track of which patches I've applied to my
0.12 system, so I can't say much more than this.

I have all the /usr/games files owned by games, with suid being set as
appropriate.  

I forgot to change the Wizard's name (ie game debug name) from
"michael", my name, to something more generic.  But I've verified that
you can use mg to edit the executable to change the occurances of
"michael^@" to something else like "root^@^@^@^@" (i.e. a null padded
string which works out to the same size as my name).  But unless you
want to be the Wizard, just don't worry about it.

The job control support doesn't work (and in this distribution I
forgot to switch it on anyway - sorry).  You can suspend it, but you
can't get back in.  Also, I don't seem to be able to kill -HUP, except
from the owning terminal session (not even when I log into another
v-console as root).  When job-control is turned on, you can get back
in, but the tty is no longer in raw/cbreak mode (which should it be?).

The -dec character set option works fine on a vt320, but on the
console, the dots come out as Pound signs, but the line drawing set
looks OK.  I compiled for S.V. colour term capabilities, but I
haven't noticed any colours (anyone know enough to test this?).

Here's what I put in /usr/games/lib/nethackdir/README.LINUX:

Nethack 3 Patch Level 10 
Unoffical patches to port pl10 to Linux 0.12 using GCC 1.4
Michael Hamilton (hamilton@csc.wcc.govt.nz)

See the patches in linux.patches. They address:
 1) A suitable configuration for linux:
    System V
    -lcurses
    no mail (not on my box yet)
    compress in /usr/bin/compress
    ...
 2) Problem with /usr/include/pwd.h and unixmain.c
 3) Problems with screen draws for zap and throw.
    Fix suggested by Quowong P. Liu (qpliu@phoenix.princeton.edu).
 4) Problem with %[,]%[\n] args to linux scanf.
    Wrote my own tiny-parser so that the score logfile
    will not need changing when scanf does work.

This is a quick hack, and I'm sure I nethack-hacker could do better.
BUT IT WORKS ON MY MACHINE JUST FINE.

The patches here should be distributed as a formal notification that
the binaries have been created from patched files that have been
changed from the official Version 3 Patch Level 10 distribution.

Definitly runs for 2 users in 4 megs + 1 meg swap, but there may be
problems with memory when you get very deep.

Ain't linux great!

KA9Q is a TCP/IP implementation.  It's a port of software written for
MS/DOS.  Under MS/DOS, it uses the packet drivers.  There is a packet
driver for TR that emulates an Ethernet.  Unfortunately it's harder to
do Ethernet or TR under Unix.  Under Unix, user programs (which KA9Q
is) don't normally use hardware like Ethernet or TR cards at the low
level that KA9Q expects.  However that's just tradition.  There's no
good reason you couldn't implement a device driver that supports a
/dev/ethernet or /dev/token, with read and write system calls to read
and write packets, and a couple of ioctl's.  That would be enough to
let KA9Q do its thing.  There'd need to be some low-level coode in
KA9Q as well, but it would be easy to write.  The hard part of the
Ethernet or TR encapsulation is ARP, and that code is already present.

This might be a reasonable intermediate step in progress towards full
network support.  The main disadvantage would be that the version of
KA9Q I ported is really a single-user program.  That's probably OK for
SLIP, but maybe not so good for Ethernet.  There's another Unix port
of KA9Q that reorganizes it into a single server talking to multiple
clients in a way that would probably work with "tubes".  That would be
more appropriate for Ethernet or TR (and it's even possible that it's
got some support for Ethernet -- though you'd still need a device
driver).  Sorry, I don't recall where that port is.  If you look for
KA9Q in archie you should turn it up.  I didn't use that version
(1) because there was nothign like tubes when I first did the
port, and (2) because that version looked more difficult to port.

Hmm, a lot of people have asked exactly the same in other newsgroups.
The problem is that new versions of rz/sz use /dev/tty as the device
for sending/recieving files. This is fine if you call the Unix/Linux
machine from remote, because then on the remote machine /dev/tty IS your
terminal, but locally, /dev/com<whatever> != /dev/tty.

The solution is either to use an old version of rz/sz (pre-88, PD too)
or find in the source the "Tty = open("/dev/tty", 2)" and change this
to "Tty = 1" or something suitable.

Hope this solves your problem, Mike.

This is already planned for Linux 0.95a.  The kernel will first look
in /etc for init, and then it will look in /bin.  The root disk will
have it in /etc, per the Linux Directory Structure Standard.

This will likely occur as well.  I'm waiting for more feedback from
the Standards people before I move more things around on the root
floppy.

This is also silly in that /usr can be a mounted partition.  How do
run init from /usr/etc if it's not mounted yet?

Also, a note to people wondering where I'm coming from and saying how
things "will be" in Linux 0.95a.  I will be handling the release of
the root diskette for Linux 0.95a, expected sometime next week.
Things I have changed or plan to:

- 	ash replaces bash as the standard shell.  This frees up a lot
	of room.

-	There is a nearly complete, but empty, directory tree on the
	root floppy.  This conforms to the LDS Standard.

-	All of the standard devices will be there.  That means no more
	people asking why mount /dev/hdb4 doesn't work.  The /mnt
	directory is there as well.

-	Some preliminary installation documentation and scripts.  This
	is the area I need the most feedback on.  What would you like
	to see here?

-	compress and tar are back on the root floppy, with tar
	compressed as on the 0.12 floppy.  cat has also been added.

If you have suggestions for changes to be made from the 0.95 -> 0.95a
root floppy, fire away.  Time is limitied, though.

(Also, although it won't happen in 0.95a, it is my hope that 0.96 or a
later release of the 0.95a root floppy (0.95b?) will used shared
libs.  This will create even more room on the root floppy.)

Is this necessary ? Having less directories makes it easier to spot new
files. A script should be sufficient to create an LDS tree.

I think the root FS disk will become an emergency toolbox as soon as a
more complete release (e.g. ABC) with installation tools will be out, so
why shouldn't it be kept compact ?

You're right, of course, but I hadn't thought of that.  :)  One of my
next projects is to develop a 'mktree' script that will install the
LDS standard directory tree on a file system.  Suggestions are
welcomed...

The idea is that the root floppy should be a 'more complete release'!
The ABC release, as I understand, is more of a way of organizing and
distributing the more complete tools.  Basically, it's like this:

Linux 0.95a:	Boot disk by Linus, root disk by me.  This will contain
		the most fundamental Linux utilities necessary to make
		a filesystem and be able to use it as root.  This would
		include /bin, a simple /etc, /dev, possibly /lib, and a
		very few things from /usr/bin.  Installation scripts
		and installation documentation would be here too.

ABC-Release:	A collection of tar files (?) that 'fill the holes' to
		make a complete Linux filesystem.  This would include
		most of /usr/bin, the sources for most of these
		utilities, and in general, the things that are not
		absolutely vital to installing/recovering Linux.

If people think differently (especially the people behind the
ABC-Release!), I'd like to say this makes more sense than having
'competing' releases.  We'll leave that to the BSD/386 and 386BSD
crowd.  :)  (I realize this a gross overgeneralization of the
situation with BSDI and the Jolitz release.  It's just an example.)

The root floppy should still be kept reasonably compact, but the idea
is to still provide maximum functionality in minimum space....

Hm ... I thought the ABC release would be targetted at those who want an
easier way to install Linux. This surely includes better structuring of
the tools collection, but I think, a kernel and the root disk stuff
should be there as well (plus a clever installation program). Have I
missed the point ?

They probably won't compete at all. The ABC release will be naturally
much slower to incorporate new features, but will be a comparably stable
base release instead. (How often do you upgrade the OS on your bigger
irons ? Weekly ? :-)

If the ABC release includes good installation tools, I see no reason why
the average user would want to use the root disk for system installation.
Therefore, I don't see a need why the root disk should be tied to LDS.

Reading through my posting again, I notice that I'm making quite a few
assumptions about the ABC release. Are they correct ?

Here's my point:  Why should the 'standard' root disk be a 'harder'
way to install Linux?  That is part of the reason why I took over
maintaining the root disk from Linus:  He is busy working on making
the kernel as stable as possible.  I have the time to make the
distributed root disk as useful as possible.

Why should the 'standard' release be any less stable?  The only reason
things are changing so rapidly now is that Linux is still relatively
new - not even a year old.  (By the way, when is Linux's birthday?)  I
expect that once we reach Linux v1.0, things will be very stable.

Linux is *very* close to a v1.0 release, which is why we're at 0.95a
now, instead of 0.13a.  You'll notice the number of changes between
0.11 and 0.12 were much greater than those between 0.12 and 0.95.

Once we hit v1.0, I would be willing to bet there will be a
significant change in how Linux is distributed, in that there will be
actual beta releases of new kernels before they are distributed for
mass consumption.  At least, this is how I'd like to see it.  Right
now, all of Linux is considered alpha/beta.

>If the ABC release includes good installation tools, I see no reason why

I see no reason why the average user shouldn't be given a root disk
that has good installation tools for system installation.  The root
disk should be tied to LDS because it is important to pick a standard
and support it.

>Reading through my posting again, I notice that I'm making quite a few
>assumptions about the ABC release. Are they correct ?

I don't think so, but my assumptions may be just as incorrect.  You
seem to see the ABC release as the 'easy install' release, rather than
providing some organization to how the myriad utilities for Linux are
released, as is how I see it.

This should be, or is on the FAQ.  The stock binary distribution is for US 
keyboards, the stock source distribution for finnish.  Go into keyboard.S,
and change the KBD_ whatever to KBD_US, so you get a "normal" keyboard.

Well, I should have said "it lacks job control that can compile

Are there any fixes to these bugs?  If so, I'd like to go ahead and
fix them for the Linux 0.95a release, since that will have ash as the
primary shell on the distributed root floppy.

If you have found a bug that is current, please check the file
tsx-11.mit.edu:pub/linux/patches/BUGLIST
to see if it is there.  I have realized that I have missed a lot of
news here at stolaf due to serious net.hicoughs, and may have missed
your bug report.

Along those lines, I have noticed something rather interesting:
I have hostname set to roland, and PS1 set to `hostname`%
After I run kermit, for a while, I get _either_
%
or
roland%
as my prompt, sometimes alternating, and the longer the kermit session
was, the longer this condition occurs.  I have not yet found a
pattern.  Any clues?

A few extra notes on rawrite+tar vs mcopy.

The only program of the mtools you actually _need_ is mcopy.

Using rawrite+tar requires formating the diskette between times. It
also requires every file being <= 1.44M.

The way I use mcopy is to copy files from my DOS-partition onto my
Linux-part.  That way you don't need any extra diskettes, no worrying
about File Sizes.

If it comes to tar _or_ mcopy, tar is of course the choice.

BUT mcopy (and mdir) is my _main_ tool for communicating with the outside
world. I think the same goes for several others.

Johan

Are you sure about this?  I was under the impression that mcopy was
merely a front-end for mread and mwrite.  If that's the case, you've
got 130k of binaries right there.  Leave out mwrite, and you've still
got about 70k.

>Using rawrite+tar requires formating the diskette between times. It

Does it?  I've been successful tarring directly to the same floppy
many times, and that's basically the same operation...

Note that the 1.44 limit also applies to writing a file to a DOS
floppy and using mcopy to get it from there.

How do you distribute a pre-compiled mtools that can handle all the
different partitions people have?

We're definitely agreed there.

I understand that, although I do tend to lose sight of it sometimes.
It's easy to start thinking everyone uses kermit under Linux to get
all their stuff to the computer....

70 kB should be enough. If you merge all the mtools parts into a single
executable and link mattrib, mcd, etc. to it, it's only 62 kB (42 kB
compressed, probably less with gcc 2.0).

> How do you distribute a pre-compiled mtools that can handle all the

The devices database could be loaded at run-time. If you stuff everything
into a single binary, this gets even easier (single entry point).

I've just built such a merged mtools and it seems to work. A better way to
handle the devices database is still missing, but that shouldn't be
difficult. It will need a lot of testing and I'll have to discuss this
with the author, so I wouldn't expect this to get released before next
weekend.

By the way, is there an 'official' Zmodem port yet ? Or is anybody working
on it ?

That's pretty impressive.  Why the heck is mtools distributed with all
the seperate programs, then?  If it could all be sym-linked, it seems
silly not to do this.  (That means mtools is wasting almost 200k on my
hard disk!  Argh!)

Easier to program, but not necessarily easier to use by a novice.

If you can pull this off, and I can fit it on the root floppy, it will
be there.  In any case, a better mtools would be ideal - the current
one obviously has some holes in it.

I don't think so.  Several people (myself included) have a compiled
Zmodem, but mine is a bit flaky.  I'll try and work on it after 0.95a
is released, but I also have a number of other things to do, first.

Why ? I have an /etc/mtools file right now, which looks like that:

A /dev/at0
B /dev/PS1
C /dev/hda1

No FAT bits, no sector numbers, etc. Of course, if the defaults don't
fit, or if the device has a strange name, one would have to specify the
other parameters too. (E.g. B /dev/dosB 12 80 2 18)

I few questions remain, however:
  a) has anybody *ever* seen a floppy disk with a 16 bit FAT on it ?
  b) has anybody *ever* seen a hard disk with a 12 bit FAT on it ?
  c) what are the /dev/dosA and /dev/dosC devices for ?

(Please mail, this mtools discussion already hogs alt.os.linux too much.)

There is a mechanism by which DOS determines the disk parameters, which is
based on a historically grown mixture of media bytes and format descriptors
(very ugly). Mtools already knows about this. I'll have a look at that.

Hmm ... are there any other known problems other than its awkward
configuration ?

Don't know for sure, but maybe the new 2.88 MB diskettes (found currently
only in some IBM PS/2's, but probably coming to other machines soon) use
something like that. If they still use 512-byte sectors, that makes
5760 sectors that simply can't be addressed with a 12-bit FAT.

     b) has anybody *ever* seen a hard disk with a 12 bit FAT on it ?

Yes. I have installed several of them as boot partitions (~2MB) for 
Netware 3.11.

I've decided to try linux am having a problem creating a boot disk. 
- downloaded rawrite.exe and bootimage (0.12 and 0.95)
- use rawrite to create boot disk, it say disk has 9 sectors
  (I am using 360K disk on my XT to do this)
- Boot the disk on my 386SX
- It says "Loading" and displays a whole bunch of :
  0000

  @X:0404
  AX:020A
  .... on and on and on ....

This happened with 0.12 and 0.95. FYI my system is a Gateway 386SX/16,
no math co, if that matters. Any help appreciated.

I did the same. In my case, when I booted up with the bootimage
diskette in my 360K drive a, I got the mesaage: "Loading ..... ". The
dots went on for a while and then nothing happened, I didn't even get
the above CX ... etc. message. I have a 386sx-25 (AMD) with 2MB of
RAM. Any help is greatly appreciated.

The BIOS routines in most computers
will report the MAXIMUM size supported by a disk - in your case,
15 sectors.  The linux boot program says "Hey, this is a 5.25"
high density drive, so I'll read 15 sectors for each track".  This is 
the mechanism which allows the same immage to be used on 1.2M, 1.44M,
720K, and 360K drives, unlike DOS where the bootrecord has the 
information hard coded into at as to what type of disk it is.

But since it really is a low density disk, sectors 10 - 15 are just not 
there.

The error codes mean sector 10 not found.

Several things you can do : 
1.  Write it out to a disk formatted high density (you can
	format a 360K disk highdensity - although 
	you will get a few bad tracks near the end,
	the first 800K on most disks is useable, and 
	we only really need to first 200K

2.  Try setting disk type to 360K for the SX A:.

But that's a REAL 360K drive, and BIOS will report the capacity correctly.

The problem here is that the linux boot-sequence asks the BIOS what kind
of drive you are running on, gets the answer "1.2M drive" and tries to
read 15 sectors/track. This obviously won't work. Use a high-denstity
diskette, and live with the fact that the kernel uses only 15% of the
capacity.

Ok: this one is a totally unrelated problem.  Now the bios reports the
correct kind of disk, so the system loading goes all right.  After that
the bootup sequence tries to determine the root-disk type, and finds out
it's not a gigh-density floppy, and dies.  It should really print out an
error-message, but there was no space left in the boot-sector, so it
doesn't, it just goes into a loop waiting for a reboot. 

If you have only a 360kB drive, I don't see how to install linux. The
root-disk simply won't fit on 360kB - even 1.2M is a bit tight. If you
have a bigger B: drive, you might swap cables, and use that as A:

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE read the documentation files folks!

From the INSTALL-0.12 file:

And from the INSTALL-0.11 file:

Now, the rootimage-0.12.Z file is 1.2MB uncompressed.  Pray tell how
do you get all of that onto one 360K floppy?!

Let's use some common sense.  VERY few 386 systems these days come
with a floppy disk drive not capable of at least 1.2MB (otherwise
it is NOT an AT compatible).

From the INFO-SHEET file:

By the way, shouldn't the RAM requirement be a RAM + swap space requirement?

Hi,

Gcc 2.0 is still in the alpha testing. IT MAY NEED A 387 OR 0.95 KERNEL
TO RUN. DO NOT WASTE TIME IF YOU ARE USING 0.12 AND NO 387.

BTW, it has the shared libs.

Yes, you can rawrite files from DOS to disk, and then read them with 
tar.  However, this gets _very_ tedious, especially if one doesn't 
have multiple scratch floppies sitting around.  Also, I tried explaining
how this process works to a friend of mine, and gave up after the 
fifth "what? huh?".

My point is that yes, in a perfect world UNIX would have no programs
whose sole function is compatibility with DOS.  However, most(all)
of the people I know who are running Linux have used a DOS system
to download the necessary disk images and files.  For the root and 
boot this isn't a problem, but the other files I got were stored
on DOS-format disks until I rawrited/tar'd enough of them over to
Linux to get mtools compiled.  I don't know about you, but I think
most people don't happen to have access to another UNIX system with
net connections, and most new users don't have a previous installation
of Linux to help with the bootstrap.  DOS systems seem to be prevalent,
and I think it would make sense to have something available (maybe 
a "bootstrap" disk image?) with some mtools binaries on it to help
get those files from dos disks.  After Linux is up, these binaries
could be rm'd and never used again(if that satisfies your UNIX
sensibilities :-) :-)).

I'd voulunteer, but I have no system I can use at the moment.  If 
you can wait a month, I'll do it then.

Or maybe if we end up having Linux distributed on a set of UNIX-mountable
disks, as images like the boot and root.

How is this less tedious than having to copy files to a spare DOS
floppy, and then using the 'bare-bones' mtools that you proposed to
read them?  That just adds another, unnecessary step...  All one
really needs to do is this:

-	get the tar.Z or tar file.
-	rawrite the file to floppy
-	'tar zxvf /dev/floppy0'

In a perfect world, DOS wouldn't exist.  :)

That was the mistake.  The 'other' files (gcc at least, I presume)
should have been rawritten to floppies in the first place.  How is
that any more difficult than copying them to a DOS-format disk?

>could be rm'd and never used again(if that satisfies your UNIX

Not really, what happens if they nuke the root partition?  I've come
close to doing that several times.  (And I won't mention how many
times I've wiped out whole directories by accident. :)

I'm all for it.  I don't use mtools, though, so it's not something I'm
really worried about.

That would be nice, but that could also be worked around by doing
something that the GNU Hurd is doing - make tar a filesystem.  That
way mounting a rawritten tarred floppy is the same as mounting any
other partition (providing it is not compressed, unless the filesystem
did that as well).

>Good luck getting things sorted out for 0.95a.

Thanks, things are falling into place nicely with all the suggestions
I've gotten.  I'm sure it won't thrill everyone, but it should provide
a good base to work from in finding a suitable way to distribute Linux
v1.0 and beyond.

Subject changing is good...  It keeps the subject more informative.
As for quotes, well, they're just there to jog the other person's

Ok.. I'm speaking from experience here...having not had a working 
mtools until AFTER I had installed just about all of the currently
ported linux packages.  

My boot path was as follows:  I moved all of the existing files
over to a local internet host, then used a DOS based comm package
to move them over to my home PC over the phone line.  So here
I sit with ALL of linux in a DOS directory and 1 at a time
rawriting them onto a floppy, rebooting LINUX,  taring the package
into linux, rebooting DOS, rawriting the next package, rebooting
LINUX, etc.

Once I got mtools working(which took more than one attempt
due to local stupidity on my part)  it was merely a matter
reading all of the files from my C DOS drive onto LINUX. 
No more rebooting(YEEEEAAAAH!)

I spent something like 10 hours moving packages over the hard 
way BEFORE I got mtools up and running.  That could have been
reduced by half if I'd had mtools up and running earlier.

(errors deleted)

as86 should not work on keyboard.S.  Instead you must use gcc -E
(to get keyboard.s) and then as (or gas); as86 should be used only
on the sources in linux/boot.

I presume that as86 will eventually disappear when (g)as+(g)ld can
create an absolute boot sector.

well, i just ported Elm2.3P11 to our 386/ix sysV machine and did a 
lot of patch work. I'll see if i can port the modified sources onto
linux on Monday..no Tuesday (i have a maths assignment for mon).
Should be good, BUT I need to know where I could find a source for
sendmail (/usr/lib/sendmail)

It seems to me that a great combination would be Taylor UUCP, Elm, and
Smail 2.5.  Smail 2.5 is small and fast, and could be set up with a
minimal "paths" file that just points to your smart host.

I've been working on getting Taylor UUCP going; but haven't had
time to try version 0.95.

Now, with the advent of 386BSD; I'm probably going to (at least
temporarily) trash my linux machine.  Would someone like to take
over from what I've got so far?  I could send you diffs or my entire
current source tree.

(I've gotten everything to work, except for the actual transfer,
 i.e. uucp, chat, etc... the machines exchange shere=?; send
 a couple of control packets, then linux locks up...)

I see from Michael Hamiliton's compiling hethack that he used SYSV

compiling nethack under MINIX.  I believe BSD curses is the present

It's easier to fill DOS floppys with files than to calculate how many 
you can tar together and rawrite onto a diskette.  Am I missing something, 
or are we limited to one file to a diskette?  Anyway, you have to format the
disks under DOS anyway to use rawrite - why not leave them useable for
DOS again when you've got Linux running?

  IMHO, most people who receive a new copy of linux will get it
in the form of disk images stored as compressed files on MS-DOS floppys,
simply because that's the way they tend to get transferred.  If a person
downloads the files from a BBS, they naturally put 'em on a DOS disk.
 If the files get downloaded to a hard drive, all that would be necessary
is to boot Linux, and copy the files across partitions.

BTW: Even with all the wierd partition schemes, there are a finite number 
of combinations that people can have, so writing a generic mcopy to read 
HD's is not impossible, just a little harder. )

  What I'm trying to put across is that it makes sense to have more than 
one way to get files loaded into Linux.  I know there isn't that much
space on the root diskette, but this would seem to be a valuable addition.
 This is _one_ thing AST had working right in MINIX - he loaded the root
image into a RAM disk, freeing up a drive to load the /usr programs.

 Not really.  How would you like to be running PRODOS?  I don't subscribe
to all the DOS-bashing that seems to be going on these days.  I know 
DOS is _very_ limiting, and agree that it should be retired, but it 
served us well for a number of years and it deserves a little respect.
(Not much, but just a little.)

Wouldn't this be _really_ slow on the average '386?

Er, yeah, whatever.  Oops.  :)

I think you're overplaying this a bit.  It doesn't take much to look
at a few files and decide if they'll fit into 1.2 megs or not.

This also isn't necessarily relevant, because you'd only really need
to do this once - to get mtools over to the hard disk.  After that,
you have the flexibility to use whatever you want.

>Am I missing something, or are we limited to one file to a diskette?  

Right, just one file, unless I've missed something as well.  But
that's also all you need.

Why not use them for Linux?

That may be the way usual MS-DOS programs get transferred, but why
can't it be different for Linux?  I think it's far more useful to give
someone an already-rawritten boot/root disk than to give the
compressed files, and for the same reasons, it would be of more
utility to give them rawritten floppies with the major utilities (like
mtools).

>If a person downloads the files from a BBS, they naturally put 'em

What if they use Linux to do all their calling out?  :)

>If the files get downloaded to a hard drive, all that would be necessary
>is to boot Linux, and copy the files across partitions.

Right, after they have gone through the motions of rawriting a tarred
floppy and untarring it under Linux *once*, to get the mtools binaries
over.  Is this too much to ask?

I'm not saying that mtools should not even exist for Linux, I'm saying
that is not vital to have it on the root floppy.

>BTW: Even with all the wierd partition schemes, there are a finite number 
>of combinations that people can have, so writing a generic mcopy to read

Finite number doesn't necessarily equal small number. :)  If you have
the 'generic' mtools set up to handle many different partition types,
you have an mtools that is that much harder to use by a DOS/Unix
novice.  How many people really now if they have 12 or 16-bit FAT
tables?

>What I'm trying to put across is that it makes sense to have more than 
>one way to get files loaded into Linux.  I know there isn't that much
>space on the root diskette, but this would seem to be a valuable addition.

I think I could agree here - but if mtools makes it on the 0.95a floppy
(which it might, since someone has volunteered to try and make a
'generic' mtools), and space later becomes cramped (i.e. for 0.96 and
beyond), it will be one of the first to go.  It's nice to have, for
some people, but hardly necessary.

>This is _one_ thing AST had working right in MINIX - he loaded the root
>image into a RAM disk, freeing up a drive to load the /usr programs.

Yes, it is a shame that so much of the boot disk is wasted - it would
be nice to be able to load a number of programs from there.

>>In a perfect world, DOS wouldn't exist.  :)
>
>Not really.  How would you like to be running PRODOS?

Who said the alternative to DOS is ProDOS?  You're even talking about
two entirely different architectures...  (If we're talking about the
same ProDOS - the Apple II OS.)

I should have said - DOS wouldn't exist *anymore*.  It has outlived
it's time, which is why companies like Microsoft are developing
Windows/NT, and IBM is working on OS/2.  DOS was a dead-end from the
beginning.

>>Not really, what happens if they nuke the root partition?  I've come

> Sorry, I must be one of that extreme minority who've never had many
>problems with rm. ;-) 

Not necessarily just rm.  It is possible some other program will go
hog-wild and wipe out a partition.  It is also possible to introduce
deadly bugs in the kernel while you're working on it.  Just ask
Linus...

>>[tar as a filesystem]

>Wouldn't this be _really_ slow on the average '386?
>(Sorry for being a bit negative, but two negatives can be positive.)

I don't know, about that - you'd have to ask the GNU Hurd people.  It
may not be all that fast, but it would be useful.

>Phew.  I'm getting _really_ longwinded.

I know the feeling well.

I think we've almost beaten this horse to death...  I don't see mtools
as a utility vital enough to _have_ to be on the root disk, and
nothing you've said really changes that.  I do, however, appreciate
the usefulness of mtools for those of us that haven't dived completely
into Linux yet.  It will be on the root floppy if I get a version that
is generic enough to be of utility to most users, and more
importantly, if it fits.  Beyond that, it's hard to make promises.

Hi,

I am starting to get "read" errors while booting my computer (not the MSDOS
partition) This is new. However I have lately been experimenting with 
DR-DOS, which has had some nasty effects on some non-dos partitions 
(junked).  Now I am looking into trying to lowlevel format the
disk again, since using the AMI bios hard disk utility hasn't had any
effect. (I'm posting to hardware groups since this is soooo close to a
hardware issue.... suppose I had bought a new IDE harddisk which needs 
to be formatted....)
Any help will be appreciated.

	Technically, you are not supposed to low-level and IDE drive, it should
come that way from the factory.
	However, I low-leveled my Maxtor drive with a utility I got off of the
Maxtor tech-support BBS.  If you call your drive manufacturer, they will usually
send you or let you dial-up and get the software you need for free... you can't
really pirate a drive, so they'll give you the stuff w/o having to send in a
proof of ownership form or anything.
	Hope this helps.

The "bad things" error is a message that happens when the memory manager
gets a request for a page not in the users process-space, which
shouldn't be possible (as those errors should be trapped by the
segmentation handler).  However, ptrace() does some mucking around with
the memory, and it had a bug (now fixed, I hope) that is probably the
reason for this.  I'm happy most of it seems to work, though.

I have had the same problem when compiling dvijep & dvijet (for hp-laserjet).
My gcc-doc does not mention it, but there exists a machine-dependent option
-m80387 which enables/forces gcc to produce FPU-instructions. If you don't have
an '387 (I don't have one myself) this will still work as the kernel takes care
of the resuling exceptions and emulates the basic operations. Slow but working.

Hi:

  I saw a posting some time ago indicating that some one is trying to port
dvips. Does this mean somebody else has ported TeX? A even better question:
Has any body ported TeX? If so, may I know how I can get it?

Let me get greedy here: If the port of TeX is already complete, is there
any one who has done a port of programs that print dvi files on dot-matrix
printers? Again, can I have it if it is ready?

  says that version 0.12 does not recognize extended partion. Oh, well.

  Should I stick with 0.12 ? But I can't use my extended partition ...
  (I have freed my F: drive for Linux, but don't know how to)

Trying version 0.95 :
+ able to get both boot and root images on 1.2 M floppies
+ boot able to detect SVGA
- then the floppy made a noise and error msgs printed :

Reset-floppy

Is my copy of rootimage-0.95 bad ? or my floppy is bad ?

That's good.

This is correct, actually.  You have an EGA+ card (SVGA) with a color
monitor.  The only four possible things the kernel will report are
EGAc, EGAm, *MDA, and *CGA.  (According to the code in
kernel/chr_dev/console.c, at least.)

You could use something like Norton's Disk Editor to make the extended
partition into another partition type, such as PC/nix or Minix or
something.  Or wait for 0.95a, which should handle extended partitions
properly.

Still good!

>+ boot able to detect SVGA

I don't see how this should be any different - as far as I noticed,
the SVGA detection code didn't change from 0.12 to 0.95.

I'm willing to bet it still print EGAc in the corner, but you didn't
notice!  The true test if Linux detects your video card is if you
press <RETURN> at the 'Press <RETURN> to see SVGA-modes...' message.
If you have a a SVGA card that Linux recognizes, it will ask you to
choose a screen size (132x50, whatever).  In 0.95a, if Linux doesn't
detect a SVGA card, it will default to 80x50 mode.  (Thus, for those
who are content with 80x25, you should hit any key except <RETURN> at
the above prompt, such as the spacebar.)  At least, I sent the patch
for 80x50 to Linus, and he said it'd be in 0.95a.  If not, I'll post a
patch here...

>Reset-floppy
>Reset-floppy
>Kernel panic: Unable to mount root

This is a known problem with 0.95.  Due to a small bug, it doesn't
work on all machines.  This will be corrected in 0.95a, along with a
nasty tty bug (crashed my machine twice yesterday...) and some other
problems.  Another main feature of 0.95a is a greatly improved root
disk.

I have recently installed 0.95 in my machine with a svga card based on the
trident 8800 chipset with 256k ram. Linux hasn't been waiting for keyboard
input at all, it presents the "Press <RETURN> to see SVGA modes" prompt,
but just just steps straight on an mounts the root file system.

I have no troubles using this card and config in 132*60 mode from DOS,
any suggestions as to what might be causing the problem ?

Unfortunately, it looks like young Iain is going to have to jump

needs a special account on a relay or certain other host to have

that does have authorization who can volunteer to forward mail? After

Subject: 'pklite' for Linux.
Date: 16 Mar 92 00:30:27 GMT
Reply-To: jyelon@cs.uiuc.edu
Organization: The Internet

I considering writing binary file compressor for Linux, much like
pklite for msdos. The salient characteristic will be that you
can compress a program, and you won't have to decompress it
in order to run it. (It would decompress itself automatically
into RAM). I need ideas.

First of all, how do I pull it off?

Here is plan 1:

    1. start the to-be-compressed executable using ptrace.
    2. read out all of its memory into a file.
    3. compress the file.
    4. prepend a tiny in-memory decompression routine to the file,
    5. prepend the proper headers for an executable program, and presto!

The disadvantages:

    1. I like shared pages. However, a text segment that gets
       decompressed at runtime isn't 'read-only', so that does
       it in for shared pages.

    2. Shared libraries would probably get linked in as soon as
       ptrace ran the thing, so the libraries would become a part
       of the compressed file. Yuck!

    3. Thousands of copies of this decompression routine, one in
       every executable, like a virus. Gross. Plus, the kernel
       is constantly loading the same decompression routine from
       disk. Wasteful.

The advantages:

    1. It's pretty easy, considering that I already have the
       code for dumping a running process into an executable file.
    2. Nobody has to be aware of it. A compressed program would
       run just like any other.

Here's another plan:

    1. Edit the kernel code for exec, to look for a new 'compressed
       executable' magic number.
    2. Have it then decompress/load the file into ram, and
    3. Have it then proceed as if it had just loaded a non-demand-paged
       executable.

The advantages.

    1. Its very clean.
    2. The decompression routine is in the kernel, so it only
       needs to be loaded once.
    3. It sounds more reliable than the above approach.

The disadvantages.

    1. The kernel is getting bigger (although not much,
       assuming that the decompression routine is small).
    2. You have to have the decompressing-kernel to run
       compressed programs.
    3. Again, compressed files are not demand-paged. (I, personally,
       could care less - I tend to think that demand-paging slows
       things down as much as it speeds things up).

Whaddaya think?

Also, about compression algorithms:

I have considered using 16-bit Huffman codes, but I'm only getting
a 70% compression ratio. Lempel-Ziv is okay (that's what compress
uses), but it takes gobs of ram to use it. Besides, I prefer a
static scheme- one where the decompression tables are fixed. (after
all, everything being compressed will be stylized gnu C 386 code...
why use an adaptive algorithm when there is nothing to adapt to?)
On that note, I was also considering inventing a specialized
algorithm for compressing 386 opcodes (it would still produce correct
output on other stuff, it just wouldn't be able to compress much).
Anybody know anything concrete about the feasibility of this?

PS: In order to do this I would need sample data - namely, assembly
listings containing BOTH opcodes and mnemonics, so I can pore them
over and see what kinds of regular patterns the gnu C compiler
typically produces. I cannot obtain this, since I do not have
access to a 386 right now. Would anybody be able to mail me a 100K
listing from the assembler?
y
Thanks in advance 4 ideas!

Disk is cheap, memory is expensive.  If you can't share
pages, you're going to loose memory, and start swapping to disk
much sooner.  I sometimes look at the memory allocation, and 
see 100+ shared pages when I'm heavily loaded - that's
400K.

Puting the decompression code in the kernel eliminates this problem :
the pages can still be read / execute only, and clean, and still
be shared.

Why use ptrace?  You probably want to set up a new magic number,
and prepend that to a compressed a.out file.

If its in the kernel, there aren't "thousands of copies of this routine"

Much better.  You still have shared pages, etc.  The only real problem
you still have is not being able to page from the file, and text gets
swapped like data.

Demand paging speeds things up in several ways : 
1,  Exec is faster because fewer pages are loaded at once.
2.  Real memory use is lower, as the whole thing hasn't 
	been loaded.  Less real memory used = less 
	swapping.  Remember, disk is 1000 times slower 
	than real memory. 

You might look at what happens to compression, etc if the file
is compressed in Xk hunks, X some small multiple of page size 
(4K).  This way you could seek to that part of 
the compressed image (using a directory at the begining),
and still demmand page / not swap text.

>Also, about compression algorithms:

Kludge alert : 
Why not, atleast for prototyping purposes, do a 
pipe(2), fork(2), and exec  /<standard location>/uncomrpess? 
The code isn't in the kernel.

PPS : root disk woes : 

1.  Put a scaled down shell on.
2.  Loose init, etc.  I'd much rather have compress, tar on my root floppy than
	init, login, getty, and their ilk.

Actually, this is a faulty analysis.  Disk is cheaper than ram, but
the program takes up memory only when it is running; it takes up disk
space whether it is running or not.  If your system spends much of its
time thrashing, you don't have enough ram and you should get some
more.  If you're not thrashing, why worry about a few unshared pages?

For me, a strong motivation for exec file compression is to be able
to put a Linux setup/demo system onto a single floppy.  A smaller
shell would help, too, as people have been discussing.

I agree that it should be in the kernel, but another alternative
is for it to be in a shared library.  Then it is out of the kernel
but there aren't thousands of copies around.

   you still have is not being able to page from the file, and text gets
   swapped like data.

This doesn't seem bad to me at all, and I see no way around it.
Currently exec won't allow this, but I think there will eventually a
way to run executables like this.  For one thing, I'd like to be able
to mount ms-dog filesystems through VFS, and those are hard to seek
around in, making paging directly from the file difficult.

The "uncompress" part of the Unix 'compress' utility is VERY small--
maybe 1k of code.  See the famous "shark" archiver for a super-compact,
unreadable implementation.

Actually there IS another alternative, which is perhaps not in the
spirit of Un*x but may be practical: put the decompression code in the
FILE SYSTEM (through vfs).  Then we could add additional decompression
algorithms, etc., by adding vfs drivers.  The FS would recognize
files with a "compressed" bit set; these files would be read-only
and sequential-access-only.

This is certainly the most general solution. In fact, with VFS going
properly I'd say it'd definately be the method of choice. Why limit
ourselves to executables?

I'm unsure why this is not in the spirit of Unix. Especially, if we
have VFS why waste the opportunity for a simple, general solution?

I'm also not sure I see why the files have to be either read-only or
sequential-access only. It sure makes things easier to begin with, but
on-the-fly compressions systems for Microsloth and other PC OS's
manage to get around this. The choice of block size and so on is up to
you.

No. I don't like the idea. Without demand-paging, Linux will be just like
another DOS. I don't want to see any DOS-like program in Linux.

For reference, the standard location (at least on the root floppy) for
compress is /bin.  This could arguably also be /usr/bin, but if you
follow the train of thought that tools necessary to the restoration of
a lost partition should be in /bin (since /usr is frequently a mounted
partition), compress should be in /bin, since backups will most likely
be compressed.

That was how I got into this mess.  :)  0.95a will feature ash as it's
main shell.  It's still got a few small problems (sometimes backspace
doesn't work, because something isn't being initialized properly, and
job control is still absent 'cause I haven't had time to try and sort
it out), but it is more than adequate for bare-bones use.

Tar, compress, init, login and getty are all on the root floppy.  I
may look at eliminating init/login/getty, but that may not prove
necessary.  There are some advantages to having init/login/getty
around.

I'll try and post a directory/file tree of the root floppy for
everyone's perusal and comments tomorrow.  It does not look like
mtools will make it in time for 0.95a, but I may end up doing another
root floppy release before the next kernel release.  (I don't really
want to do this, but....)

Subject: SCSI drivers for .95 available, configuration
Date: 16 Mar 92 02:51:39 GMT
Organization: University of Colorado at Boulder
Nntp-Posting-Host: caesar.cs.colorado.edu

This weekend, I sat down and patched the SCSI drivers into .95.  
They pretty much drop right in - trivial changes are made to 
ll_rw_blk.c (3 lines), fs.h (1 macro + a few comments), 
a line in main.c, and copy the SCSI files in.

There are a few larger changes made - namely to config.h, keyboard.S,
main.c, and kernel/blk_drv/Makefile.  I decided that the current configuration
scheme (Well, lack of real configuration, and #defining KBD whatever
in keyboard.S, which really should be done in config.h) needed changing 
in a drastic sort of way.  

config.h changed - so that there are a number of CONFIG options supported.

KEYBOARD - set this equal to KBD_US, KBD_FINNISH, whatever,

CONFIG_BLK_DEV_xxx

where xxx is a device name

This "enables" the choosen block device, so that it is compiled into
the kernel code.

CONFIG_CHR_DEV_xxx

Enables the character device xxx

Etc.  There is also a CONFIG_DISTRIBUTION option, which 
basically enables all devices, US keyboard, and whatever will be
the "most common" settings.

The SCSI devices are setup to  respect this configuration information - 
so when SCSI makes the distribution kernel, non-SCSI people can
simply leave CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ST undefined.
None of the SCSI code will be compiled, or linked into the kernel.

Compiled or linked : You heard it.  I've come up with some heinous 
looking Makefile entries involving cpp, sed,  etc, and have set it 
up so the Makefiles share the same configuration file as 
the C and assembly source.  

Take a look at the source if you're interested,
it's all in  scsi-.95.tar.Z.

Subject: new ka9q on tsx-11
Date: 16 Mar 92 05:00:45 GMT
Organization: Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, N.J.

I've uploaded a new copy of ka9q to tsx-11 in /incoming.  I trust the
staff there will put it in the right place.  (If it gets lost, you can
ftp it from athos.rutgers.edu, /pub/linux, ka9qbin.tar.Z and
ka9qsrc.tar.Z) The main changes are:

  - a new configuration command "wait", to allow you to adjust the
	wait time in the main select.  "wait 100" gives 100 millisec,
	and is the default.  "wait 0" disables the select, causing
	the program to continuously check for input, using nonblocking
	reads.  In theory wait 100 should work fine, and cause ka9q
	not to interfere with other things going on, but if you're
	trying to do TCP transfers while other things are going on,
	you may get better results from wait 0.  This is because of
	bugs in select.  0.95a fixes some of the bugs, but I don't
	yet know whether it's going to be a complete fix or not.

  - "ip stat" now shows statistics of various sorts for SLIP,
	including the number of compressed and uncompressed packets
	if you're using compressed SLIP.

I've built ka9q successfully with gcc 2.0, but this version was done
with 1.40.  If you want to compile with 2.0, you'll have to define
_NFILE in daemon.c (presumably as 20), and remove the toupper and
tolower definitions in sys5unix.c, since they conflict with the
builtin ones.

Reply-To: apr%dec001.ziap.wtza-berlin.de@noc.belwue.de (Andreas Priebe)
Organization: The Internet

Hi everybody!

I have installed 0.95 and have a few major/minor questions:

1.  I made the following:

              diff strings.h string.h | less

(the gnu diff which I used with 0.12 already) and I gave him a lot
of <SPACE> to skip fast over the file. After some skipping forward
thats what I got:

general protection: 0014"di");"c" (0xffffffff), "0" (cs),"g" (ct)
EIP:     0008:0000C1FA
EFLAGS:  00010006
fs: 0010
base: 20170000, limit: 00000018
Pid: 394, process nr: 8
8e e0 ff 05 b0 71 02 00 b0 20
Kernel panic: free_page_tables called with wrong alignment

(hope no misprints - I took it by hand off the screen :-) )

Can anybody explain me what this means?
FYI:
I use 0.95 from the original boot/root-disks on a 386sx with 2MB
(I thought I had 8MB swap, but see question 2!)

2. when using the newgcc (1.40) as in newgcc.tar.Z of tsx-11 I get
a lot of Out of swap memory/ Out of memory. When I turned
swapping to fs on:
    swapon /dev/hdb2
things went better. But I had patched the bootfloppy so I thought
it would recognize swap partition automatically (As it was in 0.12).
Don't asked: I patched the relevant bytes, hope 66 03 is ok. for /dev/hdb2
as swap?!? Anyway the next two bytes (for root partition)
are recognized at bootup!

3. When rebuilding the kernel I get errors mainly at big modules
(sched.c) which usually start with a couple of
   Unexpected HD interupt/HD timeout
the mixed up with a lot parse errors. Maybe this is connected with
question 2. ???

4. At first I could not compile mtools, then I turned swapping explicitly
on (see above). Then it went out very interesting:
I could compile mtools only after several retries - just repating (!!!)
the make. So errors aren't reproducible.


Any suggestions?

Sorry, but 0.12 seemed to be a lot more stable.

I have been working on a Linux fdisk.  At the moment there are
two real problems: (1) it ought to be able to get the number of
sectors, heads, and cylinders from the kernel, but this requires
a kernel patch; and (2) it ought to be able to set up Linux extended
partitions, but I haven't done anything about this yet.

I'd be glad of anyone suggesting (or supplying) a good kernel
interface, for example an ioctl.  The tool should be available
in a couple of days, perhaps in time for 0.95a?

Well, don't forget we already have pfdisk, and I have been able to fit
that on the root disk.  Thus, there is a way to partition a hard disk,
but you do have to know your drive's cylinders, heads and sectors.  I
just repartitioned my system yesterday, so I know that muchw works.  :)

A new Linux fdisk, that did the partitioning as well, would be great,
though.  pfdisk is okay, and it works, but it needs to be told the
drive statistics, like I said, and it is a little hard to use.

A couple of days might be too late for 0.95a, but that doesn't mean
you shouldn't work on it, by any means.  I would really like to see a
fdisk that is small, powerful, clean, and not too hard to use.

Subject: .95 Testing + other things
Date: 16 Mar 92 10:51:32 GMT
Organization: Computing Lab, University of Kent at Canterbury, UK.

Hello !
This weekend I spent some time to test linux :-)
I found some "strange" things and I am posting it here hoping that more
people will start hunting for problems. The idea is that if there are
problems it is better to solve them now than later.

1) How to increase the file buffer area.
   This is an answer from Linux and it works.
   In linux/init/main.c look at the function start_kernel. In there there
   is a sequence of if (MAX memory) > .... then buffer_memory_ent =
   something; Well you just have to change the buffer_memory_end to a value
   that sit to you. Linux raccomend to leave the boundaries intact.
   Ex: if the buffer_memory_end is 3*512*1024 it may be wise to change it
   to 4*512*1024 :-)
   BTW: I would like this kind of things in config.h togheter with all
   other installabele stuff. Something like:
   #define BUFFER_MEMORY=value
   #define RAMDISK	/* Compile the ramdisk support		*/
   #define PRINTER	/* Compiler prineter support		*/
   #define SCSI		/* Compile SCSI support			*/
   #define INET		/* Compile TCP-IP support		*/
   #define IPC		/* Compile shar-mem, semaphores..	*/
   #define HAVETSENG	/* If you have a tseng VGA		*/
   And so on.... 
   Seems reasonable and will avoid a lot of the patching business..

2) Ftp servers support.
   I understand that the ftp administrator is VERY buisy. For this reason
   my previous suggestion to organize the linux tree as a set of sobtree
   one for each release was aimed to REDUCE the work of the sysadmin and
   increase the clarity of the system.
   The idea is that the administrator create one subtree for each release
   and put into the subtrees ONLY new software. DO NOT move soft around. DO
   NOT create symlinks to previous version of software. DO NOT rename old
   version to avoid naming conflict.
   Ex: New INSTALL software for the .95a is release. This goes under the
   linux.95a subtree under the install subdirectory. The sysadmin DO NOT
   worry about what soft is compatible with or if there is no cc under
   .95a. The idea is that the user will browse trought the old releases and
   pich up what he needs. By this way the problem of name conflict is
   eliminated. ( cc is called cc in all subtrees and if you want the latest
   you just go in the latest release ( if there is one cc in the latest
   release)). It seems easier and clearer to me. Am I still tryng to make
   other people working more ?

3) Now the testing. Testing malloc.
   I have 5mb of ram and 6Mb of swap space. It appears that malloc does not
   care of how much ram or swap I have and always return a pointer != NULL.
   ALso tryng to assign a null value to the newly allocated area works in
   the sense that id does NOT memory fault or kill the process. 
   To try this just 
   p= (char *)malloc (40mb );
   for (i=0; i<40mb; i++)
      *P++ = 0;
   
   I applied the "patches" to swap.c that appeared some articles ago. It
   does not change much still there are problems. 
   The system become a bit hung when the loop start tryng to touch non
   existent space and messages like no more swap appears ( but the process
   is still running ). It would be nice if other people try to play with
   malloc and report the results.

4) More testing. vi with a huge file
   A possibly related problem is tryng to edit a huge file ( 7mb ). 
   the distributed vi just say that it has an error reading back the
   temporary file. Again I did some testing with the patched kernel in
   swap.c but there is not much difference apart thet the problem tahe
   longer to appear.

5) Testing tar.
   With all this testing I tryed to use tar to backup....
   I am tryng to use the multivolume option. Something like
   tar -cvMV "test" -zf /dev/PS0 -L xxx .
   The problem is that tar report "broken pipe" someway at the end of the
   first disk. It may well be that I am doing something wrong but I think
   not ... :-) Anyway. In doing the tar some messages appears in the
   terminal of the type:
   Unespected Hd Intr
   And the console blink ( possible interaction between console code and
   floppy interrups and hd ? )

6) Testing pipes and disks.
   Since tar does not seems to work I then resorted to the simple backup
   program I wrote. It also says broken pipe.....
   Ex: tryng to do a 
   tar -cf - . | compress | diskbachup "test"
   Result in a broken pipe. I am not really shure of where the problem
   lyes. I just would like to know if the write to the floppy devices MUST
   be of a fixed size ( a multiple of some number ) since the device is a
   block one or I can do write of different size. 
   Probably by today I will have the answer anyway since I am going to try
   but it would be nice to know anyway :-)

7) Small consideration.
   It would be nice if /unix is present in the / directory. The fact is
   that it is a bit odd to have a special database to know the symbol
   address of the kernel. If /unix is present in / then you can use nlist
   to find out where the stuff in the kernel is and get it by /dev/kmem.
   It is not complicated. It is just changing the linux Makefile so it has
   something like
   unix: same dependency list of tools/system
	cc -nostdlib \
	same objects list of tools/system
	-o /unix

8) For all of you that don't know yet...
   You can have a kind of ps by pressing the scroll-lock button...
   and a kind of memory status by pressinf CTRL-SHIFT-SCROLLOCK
   BTW: During my malloc testing i saw that at some point the shared pages
   figure went to 0 instead of the 50 or more that used to be.
   Also after having press many ctrl-c in the offending process and vaited
   for some 2-3 minutes the process eventually died BUT the kernel
   complained with some child-without-parent message.
   I am going to try again today sometime. I am also going to take more
   note of the test I am doing :-)

9) Consideration....
   I received a nice letter from the person that ported the groff.
   He is sayng that since groff is not really an nroff it should be in
   /usr/local .... 
   It is true that groff is not really a simple nroff. It is true that gcc
   is not really a cc. It is true that most utilityes are not really the
   same that you can find in a sparc or an HP or ......
   BUT since they are the only one we have WHY do we put them in /usr/local
   I really think that the distribution MUST NOT use /usr/local and that
   the names of the executables MUST be as close as possible to the
   "common" naming conventions. We don't want to create a "babele" of
   names, don't we ?

Linux is turning into a classic medium-to-large-scale programming project,
with all the problems that entails.  I'd like to make a plea for the use
of RCS on the kernel sources to help keep these problems in check.  Briefly,
some of the benefits would be:

1. One can tell at a glance the version number of each file.
2. Changes become self-documenting (well, partly!): the programmer has to
   enter a log message when each new revision is checked in, and this
   gives us a visible history of changes, who made them, and why.
3. Undoing changes becomes easier: it's possible, if necessary, to
   backtrack to any earlier revision.
4. Merging one's own modifications with a later release becomes easier.

Personally, I'd like to see the kernel completely RCS-ised by version 1.0.
What do other people think?

It works for me.  It's pretty easy to check out the previous version
of something if you break it.  

Also, RCS only keeps diffs between different versions, and will use less disk 
space than keeping a backup copy of everything.

Sounds like a good idea to me.  Easy for me to say, considering I don't have

Hello.

  I'm very interested in trying out Linux.  I obtained the root and boot images for both 0.12 and 0.95.  Made my diskettes, and tried it out.  I didn't get as far as I thought I would though!

  One of the first instructions says to check the hardware requirements.  Okay, as I understand that, that means 386, AT-bus, AT-hard drive.  I have a PS/2 Mod 70.  Am I totally out of luck?  I thought that maybe I would at least be able to get the floppy root up, but I only get as far as the boot diskette telling me I have 8 virtual consoles and 4 pty's.  Then it just sits there.

  One other note:  I only have a VGA, yet the boot diskette asks me to select an SVGA mode.  I hit a key other than return hoping that it will default to some VGA mode, however.

  The same thing basically happens whether I boot 0.12 or 0.95, except that I get one error message about queues on 0.12 and the screen clears on 0.95.

  I suspect (unfortunately), that I am disqualified immediately because I have a PS/2 with MicroChannel.  Am I right?

  Thanks,

This probably isn't a great question since Linux is a hackers OS and Messy-dog
isn't, but are we ever likely to see a DOS emulator of some form running under
Linux?  The machine i'm playing with linux on in the wee hours of the night
also runs a BBS system under MS-DOS by day.  None of my other machines run
MS-DOS, emulated or otherwise.   I think Linux is an *excellent* hack.. 
great work, Linus...  keep up the good work...  now if it only had a DOS
emulator, I wouldn't be forced to play with it in the middle of the night.

HOW TO MAKE A SIMPLE DOS EMULATOR
=================================

Needed
------
1. A 386 or 486 computer
2. A real OS
3. MS-DOS
4. A hard disk
5. Time

Put the 386/486 in virtual 8086 mode.  Trap all interrupts and I/O port
accesses.  Catch the general protection fault to simulate the action of the
hardware.  Initialize the memory segment allocated to this virtual system
to be the same as of DOS at boot time.  Force a boot from a DOS partition
on the hard disk.  Let run.  Puke.

To keep demand page loading you want to compress on each n*4k byte
boundary. The larger n is the more memory required fora page fault,
but there should be fewer page faults. The big disadvantage is that this is
a kernel mod.

Another way is to create a shell script that checks for the appropriate
binary. If it's not there it uncompresses the compressed version,
executes it and then removes it.

Here would be a sample script
#!/bin/sh
if [ -f /comp/bin/<command> ]; then
/comp/bin/<command>; else
uncompress /comp/bin/<command>.Z; /comp/bin/<command>; rm /comp/bin/<command>
fi

A few commands like sh, rm, and  compress shouldn't be compressed.

Now that I got Linux 0.12 up and running on my harddrive, I am all exited :-)
Time for some questions:

- Downloaded newgcc.tar.Z (from nic.funet.fi). "limits.h" was not found
  in the include directory. I had to fetch "include.tar.Z". Is this
  what I am supposed to do ?

- Installed kermit and pcomm. I am able to dial/connect to my host with
  pcomm, but when I hit a key the screen just went blank.
  I am still in pcomm though (since ^A-h displays the help menu)
  How do I "talk" to COM1 ?
  Is tty64 and tty65 assigned as COM1 & COM2 respectively ?

- Trying to compile "mtools" to recognize 720K and 360K disk. 
  I have to create the proper devices first.
  How do I calculate minor numbers for 720K and 360K disks ?
  minor = type * 4 + nr
  INSTALL-0.11 only tells "type" for 1.2 Meg (2) and 1.44 Meg (7) disks.

- What should I do when the 0.95a is out ? Can I still keep the configuration
  that I have on my harddisk (ie only modify some of the files such as
  /etc/rc, ... etc. :-). How difficult it would be to upgrade to 0.95a ?
  If I have to do major things on my harddisk, I'd wait installing things
  until 0.95a is out.

- I am still using 80x25 screen. Somehow 0.12 boot disk doesn't let me
  choose the screen, just straight asking to insert the root floppy or
  just straight to the harddisk in this case. 0.95 boot disk let me choose
  a bigger screen (smaller font). 

Sorry if the question is in the FAQ (is there a FAQ ?)

thanks

Below is a limits.h.  I don't know where it's from -- my include
directory is a mess.  I have 3 versions of stdio.h, and I don't
know which I should be using.  I've gone through approximately
the procedure you described: applied Lankester ps patches to
0.95 kernel source, recompiled with "newgcc" (1.40), except
I didn't throw away any .h files.  Mine works.  Ps is great.

There's an easy fix to the problem.  The first thing to do is to untar
the the old include tarfile.  Now untar the newgcc.  The updated include 
files will overwrite the outdated ones.  I have had no trouble since doing
this.

I, 'boyer@sumax.seattleu.edu', am willing to be the 'U.S.' mail 
receiver of 'ideas/wishes' to include into the 'beginner's guide to
Linux/Unix' specifically for those coming from the DOS world into
Linux. I will put together papers which I will submit to the newsgroup
and what is acceptable will hopefully be made available on ftp sites.

I will include /bin binaries explanations, file-for-file, suggestions
for running Linux from a floppy only system, for trial use, setting
up the hard disk partitions (what programs to use from what is available),
using mtools, being a sysadministrator all of a sudden with given
responsibilities, shell usage, etc.... all understandable by DOS users.

So, since the chap in U.K. has a bouncing line, I will avail myself
this side of the Atlantic/Pacific to receive these mails of suggestions.

Hello linuxoids,

Some abnormalities: Linux 0.12 detects my Paradise plus16 card ok but if I try and use any mode beyond 25x80 then everything goes south suddenly after about  10 minutes, even if I have done nothing at all.

After using Kermit to transfer a file from my schools Vax, my keyboard is remapped to return control keys only; really a drag because if I could get comms working well I could forget about DOS for the most part (rawrite and all that jazz).
Any suggestions?

I've been working on making the root diskette (yes, still :), and I
have a few questions/comments to throw out at people:

-	I'd like to change the naming of tty6[4567] to be ttys[1234].
	It's easier to remember, and makes it clear those are serial
	devices.  (This is a random thought:  Does anyone have a
	printer running off a serial port?  Can Linux talk to it
	through the serial port?)  Also, before someone asks about my
	including tty66 and tty67, Linus has indicated there will be
	some support for all four serial ports.  ttys[13] and ttys[24]
	share the same IRQ, though, so that might not be too reliable.

	(I'm assuming that for those of us with ttys[34] on alternate
	IRQs, it will just be a quick kernel patch, but I haven't seen
	the new serial drivers.)

-	Just in general, who should be the owner, what should be the
	group, and what should be the permissions for the /dev files,
	the /etc files, and the /bin files?   (And so forth.)  The
	system here at school has root:system as the owner for most of
	this, so that's how I have it set currently.

-	init/getty/login will be on the root floppy, because there's
	room, and because it's really nice (and almost necessary, due
	to a small bug in ash), to be able to start processes on more
	than just tty1.  I'm going to look at the feasibility of
	patching the kernel to include a very basic init that would
	start /bin/sh on tty[1234], but I doubt this will happen in
	0.95a.

-	mtools will not be on the root floppy because I haven't
	received anything from anyone, yet.  Maybe next release.

-	pfdisk will be on the root floppy, and I'm hoping someone will
	write a better fdisk.  pfdisk is adequate, but not easy-to-use
	and not equipped to make Linux extended partitions.

-	tar and compress are back on the root floppy!  By substituting
	ash for bash, I was able to fit them and pfdisk on, easily.

-	There is a 'mkdev' script, which will make the basic device
	drivers in $1/dev.  It will create $1/dev if it doesn't
	already exist.  ($1 being the first argument passed to the
	script, i.e. /mnt.)

-	There is a WARNING file to point out some of the important
	changes from 0.12/0.95 to 0.95a, such as ash replacing bash
	and the movement of some programs from /usr/bin to /bin.

-	The Linux Directory Structure Standard is on disk, with a
	sample directory tree.  This takes up minimal space, so I
	thought it would be a nice addition.  There will also be a
	'mktree' script that will make this tree built down from a
	specified place.  (Like /mnt.)

-	There will be an 'install' script that will copy the
	appropriate files from the root floppy to the specified place,
	and this will also probably try and preserve existing
	configurations, warning about changes that may need to be made.
	(Such as warning you to check /etc/rc for proper /dev/hd*
	names, and files that have been moved from /usr/bin to /bin.)
	I don't know how robust this will be, yet.

-	I'm working on creating a revised installation instructions,
	based on INSTALL-0.11 and RELNOTES-0.95.  This will probably
	not be that pretty, since others are apparently working on 
	doing this same sort of thing.  (I'd appreciate it if those
	that are would send me candidates for later root diskettes.)

Well, I've rambled on long enough (again), so I'll let y'all chew on
that.  If you see any problems with anything I've said, holler fast,
because the release of 0.95a is imminent, and the next root disk
release will likely not be until shared libraries are considered
out of alpha testing.

The following is the copyright notice from the creator of Linux,
Linux Torvalds....
 
          RELEASE NOTES FOR LINUX v0.95

Linux-0.95 is NOT public domain software, but is copyrighted by me.  
The copyright conditions are the same as those imposed by the GNU copyleft: 
get a copy of the GNU copyleft at any major ftp-site (if it carries linux, 
it probably carries a lot of GNU software anyway, and they all contain the 
copyright). 
 
 
The copyleft is pretty detailed, but it mostly just means that you may
freely copy linux for your own use, and redistribute all/parts of it, as
long as you make source available (not necessarily in the same
distribution, but you make it clear how people can get it for nothing
more than copying costs).  Any changes you make that you distribute will
also automatically fall under the GNU copyleft.
 
 
NOTE! The linux unistd library-functions (the low-level interface to
linux: system calls etc) are excempt from the copyright - you may use
them as you wish, and using those in your binary files won't mean that
your files are automatically under the GNU copyleft.  This concerns
/only/ the unistd-library and those (few) other library functions I have
written: most of the rest of the library has it's own copyrights (or is
public domain).  See the library sources for details of those. 
 
-------------------------------------
(DOS) BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO LINUX
-------------------------------------
 
          INSTALLATION
 
 
Installation of Linux is covered in two documents;
 
 
INSTALL-0.11
and
LINUX.FAQ
 
 
INSTALL-0.11 is the installation documentation that accompanied version
0.11 of Linux and dealt with installing Linux onto a hard disk, among
other things. 
 
LINUX.FAQ is the linux 'Frequently-Asked-Questions'
documentation file. Grab a copy of these for future reference. Most of
the material will be beyond your understanding for a little while, but
once you have installed your Linux copy for yourself you should have
gained an understanding through the process to understand much of what
is included in these documentation files.
 
 
It is assumed that you have a working knowledge of how to grab a document,
file, etc. from an archive site through Internet. You use 'ftp' to call
up and log onto the system, 'binary' to set the mode of transfer, and
'get filename' to transfer the file from the logged onto system ftp
site to your home directory of the machine you have called out from.
 
 
It is also assumed that you have a basic working knowledge of DOS and
can get around well enough. (Perhaps you know how to create batch files
using your favorite editor, or 'copy con' command line statement, and
how to use the basic DOS utilities; fdisk, copy, erase, etc...). I am
only trying to create a documentation here for DOS users who are totally
unknowlegable of Unix system calls, utilities, commands and lastly;
being a System Administrator (which you will be once you have Linux up
and running on your 386/486 machine).
 
 
In a later chapter I will describe the commands and utilities, etc. that
are available to you. I, too, am a 'beginner' unix system user, so much
of the explanations found here have been 'donated' in time and effort
by programmers/concerned users of Linux from the 'alt.os.linux' newsfeed.
(I have listed their names at the end of this documentation.)
 
 
Anyway, back to installation of Linux on your machine. Basically, you can
run Linux one of two ways; either from your floppy drive only, or from
your hard disk/drive. If you just want to play around with Linux and
get the 'look and feel' of using a Unix Operating System (as opposed to
a DOS operating system) then you might want to choose to just run it
from the floppy drive. Basically, the logic here would be that, you
don't want to screw up anything on your hard drive (which is loaded
with Windows, word processors, graphics programs, data-base programs,
etc.), and you have either spent long and hard learning hours to have
it set up that way, or you had someone else set it up for you and you
wouldn't have a clue on how to re-set it up yourself. Running Linux
from your floppy disk drive will not screw up your hard drive, basically.
There 'are' programs on the Linux disks that you will have access to
that 'can' ruin your hard drive though. (typing 'mkfs /dev/hda' for
instance may render your hard drive unreadable by DOS, but then you
wouldn't know how to do that yet...). 
 
Or, you could run Linux from booting from the floppy drive and thereafter 
having it run from the hard disk drive. 
 
The differences between these two methods are that Linux will run a lot 
(10 times?) slower if you choose to run it solely from the floppy disk 
drive, and you will be limited to the commands and utilities that you can 
run using the floppy drive only situation.
 
On the other hand, running from the hard disk drive will run Linux
much faster/quicker as well as give you space to have many more programs
and utilities to run/use, but it also entails you having to learn to
1) create a Linux partition on your hard disk drive, and 2) learning
how to maintain this partition with a handfull of sub-directories.
 
---
---
this is the beginning of the '(DOS) Beginner's Guide to Linux' documentation
that I plan on composing over the next two-three weeks to take care of
all of those users (like me) who are new to the Unix world.
Any comments, suggestions, topics/text to be submitted for inclusion
are happily received by 'boyer@sumax.seattleu.edu'.
thanks.

I (and I suspect others) ported TeX some time ago, just for fun. OK, I
cheated; rather than porting the whole system, web2c etc al., I just took
the C source generated by web2c on a sparc (with bigTeX changes) and compiled
it under 0.12. It built without any hitches, and passed the trip test.

Here's the more tricky bit. One solution; port dvips, should be easy, then
port ghostscript with Epson LQ driver, should be easy, then in theory you can
drive an LQ printer. Alternatively, you could try the Beebe drivers; I'm not
sure what printers they support.

Of course, the tricky bit is screen previewing; presumably one could extend
the mmap()/EGA demo, but things probably aren't really stable enough as yet.
Or you could just wait for X11. An interesting solution would be to write a
very simple driver for ghostscript, the use the dvips/gs combo as above. Slow,
but it should work.

I would *really* like a working TeX system under Linux; it's the only real
reason I have for booting MSD*S nowadays. Mind you, it'll take a lot to beat
the emTeX previewer...

i've ported dvips and have posted it on my local bbs (703-231-7498) and
will ftp it to tsx-11.mit.edu today, hopefully. it includes an emtex
font library.
   hopefully, ajh will do the same with his port of TeX itself..i'm very
short on disk space.
   yes, a good screen previewer (like emtex's dviscr with it's zooms and
search ability) would be nice. first of all, tho, there needs to be lp
support in the kernel.

Another approach may be to catch the int 21 and int 10 calls, and first
emulate those. This will give you the ability to run "well-behaved"
programs. Also screen access speeds will be better than under DOS!
Also this would give you access to the linux filesystem.

That's not as easy.  Int 21h is a fairly complicate routine.  You want 
to run real DOS for compatability, and emulate the underlying BIOS / 
hardware.

Hi.
I installed 0.95 yesterday and everything worked just fine, except kermit.
I entered kermit, set the line to "tty65" (com2), set the speed to 9600
and typed "connect". After hitting "return" a few times, the remote host
responed. A few seconds later I got the following error message:
"Can't get character: EAGAIN"
"[Back at Local System]"
and I was back at the C-Kermit prompt.
What went wrong and why.

Ah, but there is!  Read the group for a while, it'll turn up.
Or go look on your nearest linux archive site (I use tsx-11.mit.edu)
and FTP the docs from there.

Organization: Netcom - Online Communication Services  (408 241-9760 guest)

Can someone please let me know where the source of setterm is?  I can't
locate it on tsx-11.  If it's part of a package, I haven't figured it out.

Incidentally, I'd like to find source for wc, expr, and crypt.

Also, the stdio.h I have is inconsistent with the newlibc source; the
latter uses iop->_ptr, and my stdio.h has structure elements __rptr and
__wptr.  Where is the stdio.h for newlibc?

Would appreciate any inputs.

I am running .95 on a 386 clone, with no problems.  I do use kermit
with block check 3 since otherwise some errors occur when I'm compiling in 
one window while downloading in another.  The lp patch works nicely;
I want to get the setterm source so that I can end up with a PrtSc capability;
it's really handy when I'm logged into a host over the phone line.

wc can be found in the gnu textutils.  
expr can be found in the gnu shellutils.

see prep.ai.mit.edu for the latest versions.

crypt can be found in the UFC sources, bundled with poe-igl.

setterm - check nic.funet.fi.  It might be in the virtual console patches
for .12.  It was posted to the mailing list - you could check the 
archives.

Hang on a minute..... I must have missed something here! I have absolutely no
problems that I know of getting mail from anywhere so postings should come to
me (although I appreciate the offer).

I have put together the first part of the guide and will be posting it later
this evening. It covers the use of rawrite and fdisk in I hope full detail with
examples and other info and should be enough to let anyone test whether linux
will work for them. I need feedback on this please. Of great importance (and
still to be added) are possible sources of grief during start-up and possible
solutions so mail me with your experiences.

The guide looks as though it will be quite big when everything is covered so I
had a think about it and I propose splitting it into sections so that you have
for example a guide to installation (including shoelace etc), a guide to
getting and installing other software and a guide to basic system maintenance
(backups and things). Each one would contain the info on that topic plus common
problems and solutions. Any thoughts on this?

I will try and start on some partitioning and mkfs stuff
tonight when I repartition my HD (moving swap partition to swap file) but this
is bound to be big so don't hold your breath. I am planning to use edpart 'cos
that's what I've got so I hope this section will cover the following:

- basic ideas of partitions
- creating partitions using edpart (tell me about other progs please)
- Installing to HD
- Booting from floppy -> HD (word at 508 etc)
- Booting entirely from HD using Shoelace (yuck!) or some alternative (if
  anyone has any)
- And of course, common problems.

I might also cover national keyboards here 'cos I suppose that's part of
installation too but I'm not sure.

Till later then,

Iain

                   A Beginner's Guide to Linux
                   ---------------------------

Purpose
-------

	This document is intended to be a complete beginner's guide to the
installation and running of Linux (a free Unix clone) and, as such,
tries to make as few assumptions as possible. However, some familiarity
with Unix at an "ordinary user" level (i.e. no sysadmin experience) is
assumed/required but I'll try to keep to a "hand-holding" level for anything
out of the ordinary. I don't intend this as a technical reference
guide, merely something to get you started and keep you clear of trouble!

	I hope to cover everything you need to get "up and running"
but if not please let me know so that I can change things. Similarly,
if there is anything you think is a "must know", a useful tip, or a
waste of space please let me know so I can do something about it.
Email is best 'cos I can't guarantee to see all the stuff posted to
alt/comp.os.linux. 

          Hope this helps and happy hacking,

			Iain Reid [Iain_Reid@ed.ac.uk]

p.s. This document is quite big (and has a lot of information in it
     hopefully) so you might find it useful to print it out. I know
     this is damaging to rainforests, aardvarks etc but then again do
     you really want to be stuck in the middle of something tricky
     with nothing to refer to if everything starts to go wrong?

/***********************************************************/
Required abilities
------------------

	To get Linux and keep up to date with new releases you will need
to be able to get files from your nearest Linux archive site,
uncompress some of them and transfer them to a DOS filesystem. If you
don't know how to do this you should ask someone at your local site to
show you because the exact method used is highly dependant on your
local hardware and software.

	All the files and utilities mentioned should be available from the
Linux archive sites.
/***********************************************************/

Ok, ready to start.... First and foremost....

BACKUP EVERYTHING!!!!!! 

I don't expect you to have problems but if you do then why risk losing
everything? You'll need to do this before installing to hard disk
anyway so why not do it now?

1. Preliminary testing (otherwise known as 10 steps to happiness)
----------------------

Q. Will Linux run on my hardware?
A. If you have a 386Sx or above with 2 or more megabytes of memory
   then the chances are that Linux will run but the easiest way to
   check is to try running from floppy.

You will need - the current bootimage (bootimage-0.96.Z)
              - the current rootimage (rootimage-0.95.Z)
              - rawrite.exe (a utility to write the boot & root images
                to floppy from within DOS)
              - Two formatted floppies (2 x 1.2 Mb or 2 x 1.44 Mb but
                both must be the same capacity)

	It's up to you whether you use 1.2 Mb or 1.44 Mb disks but you
should use whichever type you can boot your machine from. For example,
my disk drives (under DOS) are

   A: 3.5" 1.44 Mb floppy drive [ bootable ]
   B: 5.25" 1.2 Mb floppy drive [ NOT bootable]
   C: 110 Mb IDE Hard Disk [ bootable ]

In my BIOS setup program I can choose to boot from drive A or C so I
would choose 1.44 Mb floppy disks.

What to do:

   1. Get the three files listed above from your nearest archive site.
   2. Uncompress the boot and root images and transfer them plus
      rawrite.exe to DOS
   3. Run rawrite.exe and you should see something like the following
      (type bootimage or rootimage where prompted and use whichever
      drive you can boot from)

c:\> rawrite
Rawrite 1.2 - Write disk file to raw floppy diskette

Enter source file name: bootimage <RETURN>
Enter destination drive: a <RETURN>
Please insert a formatted diskette into drive A: and press -ENTER-:

    4. Save bootimage (about 200 Kbytes) and rootimage (about 1100
       Kbytes) to separate disks using rawrite as above. You should
       see some information about tracks and sectors and the numbers
       should keep changing until it is finished and the command
       prompt comes back. Bootimage is fairly quick to transfer but
       rootimage is sloooooow so leave it running and have a cup of
       tea or something.

    5. Reboot your machine with the boot floppy (i.e. the one with
       bootimage on it) in your floppy drive. If all goes well your
       floppy should whir a bit and the message "Loading...." should
       appear. The floppy will whir and click a bit more and some more
       dots should appear. On my machine this takes about 6 or 7
       seconds in total... it should be fairly quick. The following
       message should appear

Press <RETURN> to see SVGA-modes available or any other key to continue.

       and you may see something like EGAc in the top right corner of
       your screen. Things get slightly hazy for me here because Linux
       and my video card disagree about things but you can have a
       quick explore here if you wish. I have no idea what is supposed
       to happen, I just know that it dosn't happen for me :-(. Press
       return or any other key as instructed and you should see
       something like this

8 virtual consoles
4 pty's
Partition table ok.
Insert root floppy and press ENTER

    6. Put the root floppy (i.e. the one with the rootimage on it) in
       the drive and press enter. You should see something like the
       following although the numbers may be different)

52/1200 free blocks.
285/400 free inodes.
797 buffers = 816128 bytes buffer space
Free mem: 2621440 bytes

(none) login: 

	7. login as root (no password) and you should see

    8. Congratulations! Linux is now running (from floppy admittedly)
       on your system. The '#' is your command prompt so you can have
       a play now although there isn't very much on the root floppy.
       Something like this should work but this is about as exciting
       as it gets for now.

# cd /etc
# ls -l
 
       Don't worry about your floppy drive bursting into life at odd
       times (usually at least once every 30 seconds or so (see "sync"
       later on)).... this is normal.
 
[ You can run entirely from floppy but as you can see it really isn't
much fun so, if you like what you see, onwards ever onwards, otherwise
please think again... Linux really is gorgeous to use once you get it
set up. Still not convinced? Oh well, bye then ] 

    9. You now know that Linux will run on your processor so the next
       question is "Will it run on my hard disk?". To test this use
       the fdisk command

# fdisk

/dev/hda2:  69286 blocks active 16-bit DOS (>=32M)
/dev/hda3:  31710 blocks unknown partition type 0x9F
/dev/hda4:   8610 blocks unknown partition type 0x9F

        The messages you get will vary according to what you have set
        up on your hard disk but, if it tells you about any partitions
        (I have 3 as shown), then Linux can read at least part of your
        hard drive. This is good. If it barfs then things don't look
        so good and, if you think Linux should run on your hardware
        (see the info sheet at the archive sites), you should tell
        Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux) 'cos he needs to know
        such things. Please be very sure that it is supposed to run on
        your hardware before sending off that mailer tho' :-)

    10. Sync. This is an initially mysterious command which you must
        ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS run before you log out. What does it
        do? Well, in common with many unix systems, Linux stores some
        information in buffers in memory (remember those 797 buffers
        at bootup?). Some of it is to do with what's where on the disk
        so rebooting the machine without syncing (writing those
        buffers to disk) could leave you in a BIG mess. That's why you
        must ALWAYS sync. 'Nuff said?

# sync <RETURN>

Well, you've got this far so that means that 1. you can run Linux, 2.
your hard disk and Linux are on talking terms and 3. You're ready to
install to hard disk :-)
/***********************************************************/

Installing Linux on your hard disk
----------------------------------

1. The theory 
-------------

 - In common with just about every other operating system Linux operates
   best from hard disk although it can be run entirely from floppy if
   you are feeling particularly masochistic.
 
- The Linux file system is not comaptible with any other file system so it
  will need its own area on your hard disk. This area is known as a partition.

- Creating partitions is easy and trouble free (in theory :-))

2. The practice
---------------

You will need: the current bootimage on disk (see above)
               the current rootimage on disk (see above)
               a disk partitioning program (e.g. edpart.exe for DOS)
               
1. Remember the bit where I suggested you backup everything? The bit you
   then promptly ignored 'cos as everyone knows, accidents only ever happen
   to other people and their hard disks. Backup everything now because
   first of all you're going to HAVE to rely on those backups in a
   minute, secondly, you may surprise yourself and in a fit of tired
   mindlessness do something which on reflection is unbelievably
   stupid (trust me, I know what I'm talking about here) and thirdly
   'cos you're going to be furious with yourself if something does go
   wrong and you haven't got any backups. So....

          !!!!!!!BACKUP ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING NOW!!!!!!!

   In theory it is possible to partition a disk without wiping out
   everything on it but it is not particularly easy to do properly and
   you're much safer with a backup on a stack of floppies/tape
   drive/another machine. I realise that this is not pleasant (I have a
   110 Mb hard disk and a BIG stack of high density floppies to prove it)
   but it is isn't worth the risk not to do it. The exact method you use
   is up to you but I what I did was 

1.1 Create a DOS bootable floppy and test it thoroughly (see your DOS
    manual for details). What you put on it is up to you but don't
    forget your partitioning program or pkunzip. Mine looks like this

a:\aliases.txt			<-- stuff for 4DOS
a:\autoexec.bat
a:\command.com
a:\config.sys
a:\filelist				<-- output from dir /FS c:\ under DOS

a:\DOS\ansi.sys
a:\DOS\attrib.exe
a:\DOS\emm386.exe
a:\DOS\fdisk.exe		<-- Just in case
a:\DOS\format.com		<-- Just in case
a:\DOS\himem.sys
a:\DOS\keyb.com
a:\DOS\keyboard.sys

a:\4DOS\4dos.com

a:\UTILS\edpart.exe		<-- disk partitioner.... don't forget it
a:\UTILS\emacs.rc		<-- startup file for MicroEmacs (ue.exe)
a:\UTILS\pkunzip.exe	<-- do NOT forget this
a:\UTILS\pkzipfix.exe
a:\UTILS\prune.com		<--
a:\UTILS\rawrite.exe	<--
a:\UTILS\ue.exe			<-- Various non essential but handy utils
a:\UTILS\whereis.exe	<--
a:\UTILS\zipzap.exe		<--

1.2 Then I used the pkunzip with the -rP options to create many zip
    files of less than 1.44 Mb. [The -r means recurse into sub
    directories and the -P means store path information. Do not forget
    the path 'cos restoring without it is a nightmare.] As you zip
    things up remove the originals (if sensible i.e remove things like
    Windows directories but leave DOS) to make space for new zips (unless
    you have plenty of free hard disk).

1.3 Fill up your stack of floppies with whatever will fit. I had no
    disk with more than about 10K free on it by keeping my zips
    relatively small (i.e. try to avoid too many >500K zips).

[ You can use the DOS backup command to backup your hard disk but I have
  had problems with it from time to time so I prefer not to ]

2. Reboot your machine using your DOS bootable floppy. This is a bit
   slow but gets there in the end. Run edpart.exe (on the bootable
   floppy) and you should see something like the following

[to be continued]

That's about it so far.... if all goes well with my repartiotioning tonight
there should be a bit on that available soon but I need honest comments,
experiences with different setups etc, problems to make it usefull so put
fingers to keyboard and get writing :-)

I just uploaded the new kernel source and image to nic.funet.fi into the
incoming-directory under linux.  As usual, they won't show up for a day
or two: wait for arl to announce that it's available.

The new version called 0.95a has no major new features, and is just a
bug-fix release for 0.95 - it hopefully fixes all known bugs, but that's
what I thought about plain 0.95 :(.  There are even less installation
documents than before: (a) they haven't changed since 0.95 and (b) the
rootdisk is no longer made by me (which means that 0.95a will probably
be the first release that actually has all the needed device special
files there.)

Everyone's favourite bug is also fixed: 0.95a actually returns the
correct version number from uname().  (Boy did I get bug reports on this
one :^)

I'm including the release-note at the end of the post.

		Linus

PS: Whoever made the GNU-emacs binary available for linux - the
inability to use the "meta-X shell" command is a bit disturbing.  I
looked into it a bit, and my guess is that the linux config file doesn't
define HAVE_SETSID.  Could somebody with more diskspace than I have try
to recompile gemacs with HAVE_SETSID defined, and tell me if this fixes
the problem?

		RELEASE NOTES FOR LINUX v0.95a
		Linus Torvalds, March 17, 1992


This is file mostly contains info on changed features of Linux, and
using old versions as a help-reference might be a good idea.

		COPYRIGHT

Linux-0.95a is NOT public domain software, but is copyrighted by me.  The
copyright conditions are the same as those imposed by the GNU copyleft:
get a copy of the GNU copyleft at any major ftp-site (if it carries
linux, it probably carries a lot of GNU software anyway, and they all
contain the copyright). 

The copyleft is pretty detailed, but it mostly just means that you may
freely copy linux for your own use, and redistribute all/parts of it, as
long as you make source available (not necessarily in the same
distribution, but you make it clear how people can get it for nothing
more than copying costs).  Any changes you make that you distribute will
also automatically fall under the GNU copyleft.

NOTE! The linux unistd library-functions (the low-level interface to
linux: system calls etc) are excempt from the copyright - you may use
them as you wish, and using those in your binary files won't mean that
your files are automatically under the GNU copyleft.  This concerns
/only/ the unistd-library and those (few) other library functions I have
written: most of the rest of the library has it's own copyrights (or is
public domain).  See the library sources for details of those. 


		NEW FEATURES OF 0.95a


0.95a is mainly a bug-fix release: it didn't even get it's own version
number.  Plain 0.95 fixed a lot of bugs in 0.12, but also introduced
totally new bugs: 0.95a tries to correct these. The bugs corrected
(knock wood) are:

- floppy and harddisk drivers should now once more work with most
  hardware: I'd be interested in reports of "unexpected HD interrupt"
  and "reset-floppy called" with the new kernel. 

- A rather serious tty-bug corrected: this one messed up the screen
  under 0.95, and switched characters over the serial lines.  Under
  extreme circumstances it could even crash the machine.

- ptrace had a bug: hopefully it works now.

- The extended partitions didn't work under 0.95, although most of the
  code was there.  Please somebody tell me it works under 0.95a.

- the 0.95 fdisk was broken: a new one with the new root-floppy should
  clear up the confusion.

- select() and the sleep-wakeup code had fundamental (but relatively
  benign) problems under 0.95 (and all earlier versions).  The sleeping
  code is totally redesigned, and select should work better even under
  load. 

One actual new feature, not just a bug-fix:

- ser3-4 support is there, although I've been unable to test it (as I
  haven't got more than ser2).  NOTE! Due to AT hardware limitations,
  ser1 cannot be active at the same time as ser3, and likewise ser2 and
  ser4 are mutually exclusive.  The interrupt-handlers should have no
  problems with shared interrupts, but the actual hardware probably has,
  so the kernel disables interrupts from one serial line when the other
  one is opened. 

- faster default keyrepeat rate: this is going to need some getting used
  to, but is extremely practical especially with bigger screen sizes.

- VGA cards that aren't recognized at bootup are put into the 80x50
  character mode if <enter> was pressed when asking about SVGA modes. 


		NEW FEATURES OF 0.95

	Init/login

Yeah, thanks to poe (Peter Orbaeck (sp?)), linux now boots up like a
real unix with a login-prompt.  Login as root (no passwd), and change
your /etc/passwd to your hearts delight (and add other logins in
/etc/inittab etc). 

	Virtual consoles on any (?) hardware.

You can select one of several consoles by pressing the left alt-key and
a function key at the same time. Linux should report the number of
virtual consoles available upon bootup. /dev/tty0 is now "the current"
screen, /dev/tty1 is the main console, and /dev/tty2-8 can exist
depending on your text-mode or card.

The virtual consoles also have some new screen-handling commands: they
confirm even better to vt200 control codes than 0.11. Special graphic
characters etc: you can well use them as terminals to VMS (although
that's a shameful waste of resources), and the PF1-4 keys work somewhat
in the application-key mode.

	Extended vt200 emulation

0.95 contains code to handle a vt200 application keymap mode: the cursor
keys send slightly different codes when in application mode, and the
numeric keyboard tries to emulate the vt200 application keys.  This
probably isn't complete yet. 

	Symbolic links.

0.95 now allows symlinks to point to other symlinks etc (the maximum
depth is a rather arbitrary 5 links). 0.12 didn't like more than one
level of indirection.

	Virtual memory.

VM under 0.95 should be better than under 0.12: no more lockups (as far
as I have seen), and you can now swap to the filesystem as well as to a
special partition. There are two programs to handle this: mkswap to set
up a swap-file/partition and swapon to start up swapping.

mkswap needs either a partition or a file that already exists to make a
swap-area. To make a swap-file, do this:

	# dd bs=1024 count=NN if=/dev/hda of=swapfile
	# mkswap swapfile NN

The first command just makes a file that is NN blocks long (initializing
it from /dev/hda, but that could be anything). The second command then
writes the necessary setup-info into the file. To start swapping, write

	# swapon swapfile

NOTE! 'dd' isn't on the rootdisk: you have to install some things onto
the harddisk before you can get up and running. 

NOTE2! When linux runs totally out of virtual memory, things slow down
dramatically. It tries to keep on running as long as it can, but at
least it shouldn't lock up any more. ^C should work, although you might
have to wait a while for it..

	Faster floppies

Ok, you don't notice this much when booting up from a floppy: bash has
grown, so it takes longer to load, and the optimizations work mostly
with sequential accesses.  When you start un-taring floppies to get the
programs onto your harddisk, you'll notice that it's much faster now. 
That should be about the only use for floppies under a unix: nobody in
their right mind uses floppies as filesystems.

	Better FS-independence

Hopefully you'll never even notice this, but the filesystem has been
partly rewritten to make it less minix-fs-specific. I haven't
implemented all the VFS-patches I got, so it's still not ready, but it's
getting there, slowly.


	And that's it, I think.

Happy hacking.

Date: 17 Mar 92 20:57:57 GMT

Well, I finally got the .95 kernel to compile, and I have a word of warning to
those, who, like me, edited their partition tables to put a bootable Linux
partition on that last unused 4M of their C: drive.

It's not enough to defrag and edit the partition tables; also edit the boot
record so DOS doesn't merrily assume it has the whole disk.  I found this out
after about the third time Linux and some of my documents had stomped each
other :-(.

Anyway, I was wondering if someone could please tell me the device numbers I
need for a 720K 3-1/2" a: drive and a 360K 5-1/4" b: drive (they're really HD
drives, but I'd like to be able to use my older DD disks with 'em).

From the FAQ:

type:
	1: 360kb in 360kb drive

I think that we should create a "how did I port ...." directory.
This list should be maintained at one of the FTP sites. Everyone who
ports something to linux should be requested to enter a file, with
information that will make it easier for the rest of us.
I'll give an example to make things clear:

Program ported:   Mtools.
Program version:  2.05
FTP site:         nic.funet.fi
Directory:	  pub/...... (sorry, don't know right now)
Linux version:    0.12 & 0.95
Kernel patches:	  NONE
program patches:  Edit devices.c for your configuration.
Makefile flags:   NONE
Warnings that can be ignored: NONE

Patches that were required should be included, except as in this case,
where the patch is configuration dependent.

Yes, it is ftp'able at this site:

agate.berkeley.edu

in this directory:  pub/386BSD

this is very interesting stuff.  I like the ethernet board inclusion.  May

As an aside: does 386/BSD have drivers for tape streamers? I'd like to
have tape-support for Linux! An example [source] might make it easier for
me to write that. [I'm not sure I could do all of it though.]

Subject: Man pages
Date: 18 Mar 92 01:27:58 GMT
Reply-To: johnsonm@stolaf.edu (Michael K. Johnson)
Organization: The Internet

OK, here's an update on the recently announced man pages project, and
a call for more help.

Two people have announced that they would like to work on the man
pages, but no one wants to coordinate the project.  So I will start
the thing going, waiting for someone to take charge -- I can't carry
this through.  Therefore, if you think that you would like to get
involved in this project at any level of commitment, please tell me.
I will be willing to co-ordinate this until someone else steps up or
until the end of the school year, whichever comes first.  I will need
volunteers both to do some writing and a little research, and someone
to take my place as co-ordinator.

If you don't feel up to kernel hacking, or if kernel hacking is not
your interest, but you would like to contribute significantly to
linux, this is your chance.  If there are two people who would like to
share the burden of co-ordination, that might work too.

We might as well divide the man pages the way they are divided
already:  It will take different people to work on different sections.
I will list the sections, and ask that someone volunteer to organize
each one.

Section 1: User commands.

	This should involve little more than collecting already
written manpages:  GNU has man pages for most of their programs, and
most of the programs we are using are GNU's.  This will involve
writing man pages for all the linux-only programs that we have.

Section 2: System calls.

	It would be nice if a hacker-type would help with this one.  I
think that this need not be too hard -- Between the linux source,
posix documentation, and man pages already existing for BSD that I
believe are free, this should not be too hard either.  But we need
someone who knows what is going on here.

Section 3: Subroutines.

	These are the man pages for the standard library.  I don't
know if GNU has these, but we can probably use posix and BSD again.  I
don't know these nearly well enough, so I, at least, really would be
depending on whoever picked this up.

Section 4: Devices.

	Ok, this should not be too hard:  we don't have a heck of a
lot of them yet.  Anyone looking for a decently easy task?  First
come, first serve :-).

Section 5: File Formats.

	Again: we don't have a lot yet.  This will definitely be a
continuing effort as we build functionality into linux.  Anyone for a
steady, long-term commitment?  OK, OK, I'll quit the puns...

Section 6: Games.

	Come on, _someone_ has got to have an interest...  Actually,
these should come with the games, so unless games become standard...

Section 7: Miscellaneous.

	Uh, yuk.  who decides what goes here?  Well, here's your
chance.  Seriously, someone please tell me what goes here.  I need to
know even as interim co-ordinator.

Section 8: System administration.

	This is another section which calls for a long-term
commitment, because linux will be evolving administrative commands,
especially as people write programs to make things easier for others.
This will definitely need someone who wants to have a long-term
(though low-intensity) project.

Section l: Local

	Good thing we don't have to deal with this.


If you don't want to co-ordinate a section, but want to help, please
mail me.  If you are not sure, and want to talk about how difficult a
task one of the sections would be, I'm sure that we could talk.  It's
just that I will definitely need volunteers with some time.

If anyone has information on the legal status of any sources of man
pages, or knows of sources that I havn't mentioned, please write me
and tell me.

Thanks for putting up with this long article.

I took a few days off, and have only caught up through digest
#104!  Would you guys slow down a bit???   :-)

Several people have commented that changing VGA modes via an
ioctl will be hard because SVGA registers are undocumented
and all different.  The mysterious nature of SVGA registers
appears to be mostly myth.  Since the registers on a VGA
can all be read, it is fairly simple to write a program to
discover what to put in the registers for any given video
mode.

For an example of how this can be used to implement VGA mode-
switching in protected mode, take a look at the Minix port of
the MGR window system.  On bellcore.com, in /pub/mgr/minix,
you will find the latest version of the Minix port of MGR.
The vgaregs.zip file contains an MSDOS program that can be
used to read the VGA registers.  The videodef.h file is a 
sample of what's produced by vgaregs.  To switch to a different
mode, one simply blasts the appropriate set of values into the
registers.  (Well, it may not be quite that simple, but you
get the point.)  The number of people actually running MGR
under Minix is probably still fairly small, but I've seen
reports of success from several people and no reports of VGA
incompatibility.  I run MGR in 800x600x2 mode on my no-name
clone SVGA, and have had no problems.

In the Minix VGA implementation, there are four special files
in /dev corresponding to text mode and three graphics modes.
/dev/screen is a link to the graphics device to use for MGR.
Two programs, tmode and gmode, are used to set either text
mode or the graphics mode selected by /dev/screen.  Linux
wouldn't have to limit the choices like this.

So, no further SVGA documentation is needed.  All that's needed
is someone with the time to spend pounding out the code.  That,
unfortunately, lets me out.  :-(

Subject: Transferring stuff to Linux
Date: 18 Mar 92 05:00:18 GMT
Reply-To: paula@atc.boeing.com
Organization: The Internet

There's been some discussion lately about difficulties some
are having with moving files from the net into Linux.  I've
developed a mechanism for doing this for Minix, and it works
just as well under Linux.

I consider the floppies that I use to move stuff from the net
into Minix or Linux to be my archive backup.  They are formatted
with DOS filesystems and contain one large uncompressed tarfile
each.  When I've got a bunch of stuff to transfer, I tar the whole
mess up in one big tarfile and break it into smaller independent
tarfiles that can fit on a floppy.  An early version of the program
I use to split tarfiles was posted to comp.sources.unix (years
ago when Rich $alz was the moderator).  If there's interest, I
can package it up and post my current version here.  Once I've
got my data in floppy-sized tarfiles, I use one of several means
to write them onto DOS floppies and then carry them home.  To read
stuff off of one of these floppies, I don't need rawrite or mtools.
A simple "tar -x -i -f /dev/fd0" does the trick.  (The -i flag
means "ignore stuff that doesn't look like a tarfile".)  When I've
got what I need off of a floppy, it goes back in a storage box
to await future use or a final determination that its contents
are so old that it can be scratched.  

Note that "tar -i" can handle multiple tarfiles on one floppy.
You need to take care, however, to ensure that they are written
one after the other onto a freshly-formatted diskette.  This
will give DOS no opportunity to scramble the blocks in the tarfiles.

Date: 18 Mar 92 05:42:03 GMT
Organization: Harvey Mudd College, WIBSTR

I have uploaded the root image for Linux v0.95a to nic.funet.fi.  As
with the bootimage, you will have to wait for it to be moved to an
accesible directory.  (I assume it will be moved over at the same time
as the bootimage.)

A summary of the changes has been included in the file CHANGES-0.95a,
also uploaded, and is also included below.  There is also an
INSTALL-0.95a, which I have not posted below since it is largely a
rehash of INSTALL-0.11 and RELNOTES-0.95.

As Linus has said, these files will available in a day or two from
nic.funet.fi, and an announcement will be made when that happens.
They will be available on the other sites shortly after that.

CHANGES IN THE LINUX v0.95a ROOT DISKETTE
Jim Winstead Jr. - March 17, 1992

This file mostly contains info about the changes in the root diskette
from Linux v0.95/0.12 to Linux v0.95a.

CHANGES

With the release of Linux v0.95a, the maintenance of the root diskette
has been assumed by Jim Winstead Jr. (jwinstea@jarthur.Claremont.EDU).
This means there are a few large changes between the Linux 0.95 and
0.12 root floppies and the Linux 0.95a root floppy.  These are
detailed (as much as I remember them) below:

-	'bash' has been replaced with 'ash', the BSD 4.3 /bin/sh.  This
	freed up nearly 200k on the root floppy.  However, there are
	some problems with 'ash' that haven't been resolved:

	- sometimes the backspace key will not work on a virtual
	  console.  I've found that it usually works on all _but_ one
	  console, so this is only a minor hinderance.

	- 'ash 'supports BSD-style job control, and this has not yet been
	  adapted to Linux's more POSIXish job control.  This means
	  that 'ash' does not yet support job control, but it's being
	  worked upon.

-	'tar' and 'compress' are back on the root floppy.  'tar' is
	compressed, and both utilities are in /bin.

-	'pfdisk', a disk partitioner, was added to the root floppy.
	This makes it (almost) possible to install Linux on a machine
	without looking at another OS.

-	the file pager 'more' has been added to the floppy.  This was
	added because of the addition of some documentation files on
	the root floppy.

-	'cat' has been added to /bin.

-	many utilities have been moved from /usr/bin to /bin, to
	conform to the Linux Directory Structure Standard (v1.0).
	These utilities are ones that are 'vital to the restoration of
	other file systems in the case of a corrupting crash.'

-	'init' and 'update' have been moved to /etc from /bin.  This
	was done because neither program should be executed from the
	command line by any user, including root.  (That means don't
	put /etc in your PATH!)  This has been a matter of some
	controversy, but this is how it will stand until the Linux
	Standards mailing list/committee decides otherwise.

-	tty64, tty65, etc, have been renamed to ttys1, ttys2, etc.

-	the directory /INSTALL was added, which contains some
	documentation, and three simple shell scripts to make
	installing Linux on a hard drive partition easier.  These are:

	- 'mktree', which makes a directory tree on the specified
	  mounted device.
	- 'mkdev' which creates the standard devices in the dev
	  directory of the specified mounted device
	- 'install' which installs the programs on the root diskette
	  to the specified mounted device

	These programs will normally be called with '<name> /mnt'.

-	rootdev is different than the one on v0.95.  A couple of days
	after the release of 0.95, a program called 'rdev' was posted
	to alt.os.linux that duplicated and extended the functionality
	of rootdev.  This was renamed to rootdev and replaces the old
	rootdev.

-	agetty was renamed to getty, to be consistent with common Unix
	practice.

-	an improved fdisk was added that correctly reports extended
	partitions,  (Thanks to Linus!)

-	/dev is complete, or at least more complete than the last few
	releases of the root diskette, which always seemed to be a
	major complaint.  :)

-	/etc/issue and /etc/motd have been expanded to be a little
	more informative.  (Yeah, I know, big deal! :)

-	chgrp was removed.  You can use chown to get the same effect,
	but you just have to specify an owner, too.

Many of these changes were discussed on alt.os.linux, or the Linux
Standards group, so they may look familiar.

If you have questions, problems, or complaints about the root
diskette, either post to alt.os.linux, or send mail to me at
jwinstea@jarthur.Claremont.EDU. 

If you have questions, problems, or complaints about the boot diskette
or the kernel itself, post to alt.os.linux or send mail to Linus
Torvalds at torvalds@cc.helsinki.fi.

Remember, the only stupid questions are the ones you don't ask.

FUTURE CHANGES

I'm already anticipating some changes for the next release, so here's
a sneak preview:

-	shared libraries.  These are currently in alpha testing, and
	will hopefully free up some more room on the root floppy for
	more goodies.

-	a generic mtools might be added to the root floppy.

-	a better fdisk to replace the current fdisk/pfdisk pair.  You
	won't need to know your drive's geometry for this, and it will
	know about Linux extended partitions.

-	an improved sh.  I'm working on the backspace problem, and
	adding job control.  I'm also going to look at using the GNU
	readline library for input, as long as it doesn't add
	substantially to the size of sh.

-	init/getty/login may be removed from the root floppy.  The
	main reason they'll still on there is the backspace problem
	with ash.

-	improved installation documentation.  People have started work
	on this already - read alt.os.linux for previews.

-	more robust installation scripts.  The current ones are quick
	and dirty, and work well, but I'd like to add better ones.

-	miscellaneous utilities added.  I'd really like to add an
	editor to the root disk, but I haven't found one small enough.
	Any suggestions?

-	various other things that I can't remember right now.

Again, mail your questions, comments and suggestions about the root
diskette to me at jwinstea@jarthur.Claremont.EDU.

Unfortunately, SCSI support did not make it into .95a.  However, there are 
clean diffs against .95.  The code autodetects too, and can run in non-scsi
systems so it will be possible to include SCSI support in the standard
distribution.

Currently, the only finished low-level driver is for the seagate 
SCSI hosts. Dave Gentzel is currently testing his Ultrastor driver - 
so it should become part of the SCSI distribution soon. 

I don't know the status of the Adaptec driver, and the DTC / future 
domain drivers are student projects and therefore subject to spring 
break.

*That* would be wonderful.  Not using version control will result in a
situation like we have with MINIX: awful and uncontrolable.  I highly
recommend using version control, because there are so many people
working on Linux, that we might get a similar situation if Linus stops
administrating everything.

Subject: Help!  Can't create file system..
Date: 18 Mar 92 10:13:11 GMT
Organization: Sophomore, Math/Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA


	I (finally) got Linux 0.95 to actually boot, but I'm having problems
creating the file system with mkfs on my hard drive.  I've tried about
every possible combination of partition-types - even formatting the
entire drive and giving linux the first primary partition.  I still get
errors though.


First, when booting and right before (maybe right after) the opening
"Welcome to Linux 0.95" message (or whatever) I get:

_setutent: can't open utmp files: no such file or directory
_setutent: can't open utmp files: no such file or directory


(yes, twice).  fdisk seems to run fine, as does mkfs.  Once I run mount
though, no matter which options or device I use, I get:

mount: unable to open lock-file

If I try it a second time it doesn't even check the disk (in a buffer or
something?).  I suspect that this is not a problem with the actual
partition - I don't really see what could be wrong.  

Any suggestions????

Subject: More testing + malloc considerations + tape + ....
Date: 18 Mar 92 08:37:32 GMT
Organization: Computing Lab, University of Kent at Canterbury, UK.

I spent some more time on testing the version .95 of linux. I am a bit
amazed that I haven't wiped my HD yet :-) Anyway, here goes:

1) Got the new PS.95 compiled succesfully after having patched, no fuss
   no problem with the patches. Try to load the new kernel and this is what
   I got:
   .........
   ..........
   Free mem:3407872
   hardisk I/O error
   dev 0342 block 24576
   hardisk I/O error
   dev 0342 block 24576
   hardisk I/O error
   dev 0342 block 24576
   general protection ffd0
   EIP :0008:000000c187
   ....
   PID:1 process:1

   Not very nice. I must say that I have some "unespected HD interrupt" 
   sometime but I newer got this before :-( Some strange interaction between 
   the patches and my HD ....

2) The backup story....
   I managed to have tar write multiple floppyes using
   tar -cvf /dev/PS0 -L 2730 -z .
   The point was to understand that the length is in blocks of 512 bytes.
   The problem is that I can't do  a restore yet :-)
   I tried with:
   tar -xvf /dev/PS0 -M -Z
   But after the first disk tar doesn't stop and ask for the second...
   Any idea ?

3) What happen if.....
   I change one of the shared executables on the fly ?
   Ex: I got the new bash. I was logged is as root and i changed the 
   old bash with the new bash. It was not possible to use the new bash
   until the old bash exited. ( At least this is what it seemed to happen )
   I don't know how the sharing works... I am just thinking that if the
   system do not realize that a the program has changed and try to load
   bits of the program from what it thinks is the old file some strange 
   things can happen....
   How is the system supposed to react in an event of executable change 
   while the executable is still in use ? ( and possibly shared )

4) I understand the idea behind the malloc syscall...
   It is the same idea behind the mach OS.. :-) The point is that I think
   the the OS does not react in a good way when tryng to access all the pages
   that are supposed to be there. It become veeeery slow and seem to be frozen.
   Also the offending process doesn't seem to go avay...
   I am not shure that the mach idea is a good one. From one side it is really
   nice. It allows you to have very sparse databases in a machine.
   On the other side there is the problem that a resource like memory
   is newer completly granted to a process. 
   Ex: My program not only has to check for
       if ( (ptr=(char *)malloc (bignum)) == NULL )   
   But also it has to check for possible memory faults during execution even
   if the allocated area is supposed to be there.....
   Anybody has some opinion about it ?
   I vould like to be able to choose.... Something like
   malloc ();	/* Returns a pointer to an ALWAYS available memory area */
   mmalloc ();  /* Returns a pointer to a NOT ALWAYS available memory	*/ 
       
5) This has nothing to do with linux testing, or maybe a little :-)
   With all this testing I have to have a backup...
   Now, floppy are a bit exepnsive if you start to need many of them 
   compared to a tape. I was thinking that I may be able to 
   afford to buy a small tape ( The QIC10 ) It is supposed to 
   be a 120Mb and the tapes cost very little if compared to the
   cost of the equivalent in floppyes. In the long term tape is cheap :-)
   Anyway. The point is:
   Anybody know how the beast can be accessed from linux ?
   ( It is supposed to work using the floppy interface... but it is NOT
     a floppy. So, how does it works ? Will it work with linux ? ( I bet no ))
   If it will not work with linux, anybody can point me in the direction
   where I can find informations on the format of the commands ?

6) Sorry, again with ftp-sites :-( Last posting about this !
   Ftp sites. I haven't received any complains about the idea of having
   a separate subtree for each release of linux. Each subtree will contains
   ONLY the NEW stuff that is released for that release. NO symlinks to OLD
   stuff. NO old stuff anyway. This will keep the naming consistent
   ( No INSTALL.12 INSTALL.95 ... but jsust INSTALL ) The same apply for
   each new release of cc, nroff, X11 and so on
   It is easier to know what is new ( just have a look at the latest release )
   The work for the ftp admin is reduced since what you have to do is just
   put the new stuff into the current release. No messing around with name 
   clashing...
   Anybody like the idea ?. Too much work ?. Not worth it ?....
   
7) Last bit.
   I follow a bit amused the various articles that got posted in alt.os.linux
   The most amusing are the one that ask if it is possible to add this and 
   that to Linux. I wonder if the poster of such articles had ever had 
   ours of work zapped because the OS...
   As I said before. It is possible to implement compression on the fly,
   DOS emulators, and anything you like. The point is that this is not
   the right moment. It is COMPLICATED to get an OS up and running.
   Linux has done a GREAT job but to be able to continue the system HAS
   to remain simple ! ( At least until it get a bit more stable )
   And even then there are better things to do:
   Shared libraryes ( this will save a LOT of disk space )
   IPC ....
   TCP/IP....
   X11....
   I think that the system is already too overloaded with "unneeded" stuff
   ( ok ok, now many of you will write BY MAIL the reason that the following
     stuff is absolutely needed :-) )
   Ex:
   exec of files beginning with #!/bin/sh
      This has reported to be buggy. Linux can spend time to debug the HD
      code or do something else if this is not required.
      If you absolutely need that you can just do a system from inside
      you executable ( just for now, in the future it may be back )  
   Swap on a file.
      I don't know if this is related with the malloc problems I think
      that having a partition for swap is much safer than having a file
      It should also be faster....
      Most unices swap on a separate partition. Some of the new ones swap
      on a file too. Let's give Linux time to fix other stuff before
      adding this bit.
   Symlinks
      Yes, we need them to fix programs that want to be where they should not
      be... But one symmlink is enought. Isn't it ?
      ( Yes yes, I already ear the letters arriving..... )      
   Ok. it's all ! Before you post a reply sayng that all this stuff is needed
   just remembar that:
   I am not sayng that it is not useful. I am sayng that we can wait a bit 
   for it and give time to linux to fix other bugs...
   Seems reasonable to me :-)

Kudos to Linus for linux.  

I got .95 installed on my machine and am able to boot
from the HD.  My problem is that I can't mount floppies that were created with
rawrite under DOS.  The error that comes back with fsck is bad magic number in
the super-block.  Drive A is 1.44 and B is 1.2. 

For some reason, I can mount the rootimages of both .12 and .95 (I used DOS & rawrite).
If I make a fs under linux, with the mkfs /dev/PS0 1440, it works fine and is
mountable.  Do I need to modify rawrite?  What am I missing here?  

Sorry if this is a FAQ.  Thanks in advance,

OK, since you asked, here is the assembler code for Trident VGA
detection.  I got it from sources/system/linux/boot/setup.S.
Try putting this code fragment into a MASM or TASM file (with any
necessary changes to get it to assemble) and see if it works with
you card under DOS.  If it does, then it's a LINUX problem.  If it
doesn't then it's a problem with the code itself.

Hi fello Linux fans,

I have some problem with using 'as86' on Linux 0.95. It complains even
when I tried to assemble crt0.s from the Linux kernel source.

I looked up in Linux kernel's makefile (linux/Makefile), which uses the '-0
-a' option, and I tried that without success.

Do I forget something here? either the option switch, or simply the wrong
assembler?

I also tried to use gcc2.0 to compile a hello-world program. It requires
'as' and 'ld', so I linked my as86 to as and ld86 to ld respectively.
But it fails in a similar fashion.

The as86 and ld86 I have now were from Linux' distribution file
"binaries/compilers/as86.tar.Z" from FTP site tsx-11.mit.edu.

Could somebody help me out?

Thanks in advance.

In addition, has anyone yet been able to add any sort of Ethernet support

Ok.  I have been playing with the SCSI driver stuph and almost have the

I can mount the HD and it doesen't lock up too often.  Next question:  
I have two 1.7G drives that work flawlessly under DOS with
my controller, but linux requires 64M partition limits.

Now, that is 53 partitions I have to make!  I haven't yet dug through the

Once VFS is fully in Linux, it will be trivial to implement neat things 
such as Berkely FFS and LFS, the pageable RAM filesystem (great for 
/tmp) , DOS FAT file system, etc.

Then you'll be saved.  However... until then...

As the author of the aha1542 driver for I suppose I better answer.
I've written a driver for Linux-0.12. I still needs to be integrated
into the stuff drew wrote and thus be adapted to 0.95[a].

I very pressed with time at present, but will, if nobody else will 8^),
eventually do it.

Sorry for taking so long moving IPC over to .95. I'm having to add a 
few more features to VFS before I can get it to support pseudo directories.
It may take a while longer but it should save a lot of future work since
the kernel will be much more modular, and will make it possible to
have things like
/proc
/inet 
etc.

I really think we should try to be innovative rather than just being 
compatible. I think this is one of the biggest things Linux has going
for it.

Last night, I attempted to create a ZIP archive of several files
I was working with.  Using LINUX 0.95, I called the zip program
which I FTP'ed from tsx-11.  It compressed several files of less
that 20K, but stopped after compressing a file of approximately
64K.  I then tried compressing that file seperately, and got the
same error.

The error was EINVAL, but that didn't give me any useful information.

If someone wants to look into this, I'll send her or him the file
that caused the problem.

Thanks.

I propose that you spend your time in implementing shared libraries,
this will drastically reduce the size of the binaries (for example,
/bin/ls is 13336 bytes long on a SunOS 4.1.1 machine while using
122880 on Ultrix), among other advantages of shared libraries
(bug-fixing in the libraries without recompilation of the binaries)

I tried to  install 3 things last night:

textutils 1.3
shellutils 1.6

I have various unresolved refs and so on but at one point I get the
complaint that it can't find libg.a.  I've already installed gcc 2.0
and it worked fine to build the linux .95 kernel.  Does it want
libg++ or libgcc which I have or do I have to get libg.a also?

At this point I could probably use the recently proposed repository
of people's porting experiences for particular packages (I picked
the above mentioned versions because they were higher than what I
found for linux on the ftp sites).

It wants libg.a also.  A workaround is to go into /usr/lib,
and do an ar -r libg.a.  This will create a libg.a, albeit
and empty one.

4 megs of real memory, another 2+ M of swap space if you are interested in
gcc2 rather than gcc1.40.  This swap space can be created either in 
its own partition, or on on any normal file system.


>partitions of a hard drive with the user selecting between them upon 

Yes.  Also, with careful manipulation of the partition table and 
boot record of your DOS partition, you can shrink the DOS partition
and create a Linux partition without reformatting and repartitioning
the disk.

>bootup?  Has anyone thought of porting X-Windows to Linux?

yes.  Zorst is working on this.  Linux currently supports shared libraries,
we have enough of a sysV mmap() call implemented to map the SVGA frame 
buffer into user space, the socket emulation library which runs 
on tubes, and Zorts has some IO permissions bitmap stuff that lets
the Xserver go straight at the hardware.  

Add that together, and you can see that X should be here in the near 
future.

Well, I just got linux runing on my system here. (Yea!)  I backed up my 81 
meg HD, and re-partioned/formated it. I used a shareware program called 
PDISK to create the partitions (DOS fdisk leaves a lot to be desired..). I 
made a 50 meg partition for DOS, and a 31 meg partition for linux. Then I 
followed the steps in the INSTALL file. This is only v0.12, because 0.95 or 
0.95a isn't available here yet. The INSTALL file gives a sample C program to 
change the root-disk to the HD, but a hex-edit was easier. Anyhow, the point 
is -- finally -- that it runs just fine on my 386sz/20Mhz with a 31 meg DOS 
partition, and 2 MB of RAM.

Hello,

a few comments first I like linux even if I can only run it from floppies
(so I cut cost in building my 386 buy using what I could from my old xt)
I just read that the .95a will have cat and more added... great
I was getting tired of cp ????.?? /dev/tty0

my biggest problem/question is what do all these extra commands do
I know the standard ones, but looking through and seeing commands
that aren't very helpfull and having to guess what they do and
then having them do nothing visible and reporting no help not even
a list of options. is there a list someone of what each comand does?
or atleast a list of options... I know what I want is man pages...

if someone could take type up something very brief maybe even 5 lines
per command (like mknod creates devices.. well... sort of...)
noting to be the end all of end all.. but something to give those that
like to play with things something to do... a direction.

and my major question.. beyond what goes where is I'm used to only
using a multi user system.. someone else created the account, and 
set up most of the programs, etc.... and I'm used to owning and setting up
a single user system (pc, dos etc) so I haven't more then a clue what
needs to be done to admin a unix system.... and advice..help
documentation or referals would be appresiated.. any good books?

thanks in advance.....

There are some man pages and a man program on tsx-11.mit.edu..can't 
remember the names of both..sorry.  text-1.1.tar.Z in /binaries/usr.bin
is one of them, I think.  You also may need groff or cawf from time to
time.  Some packages come with unformatted man pages.

A good choice for a first book about system administration is this one:

"Essential System Administration"  by AEleen Frisch.  It's one of the NutShell
Handbooks by O'Reilly & Associates, Inc.  It presumes a knowledge of basic 
Unix commands, but is written largely for the person with minimal sysadmin
experience.  A classic get-to-know-Unix book is "The Unix Programming 
Environment", by Kernighan and Pike.  It covers everything from basic commands
to shell programming to nroff to...I think you get the idea.  It's published
by Prentice-Hall, along with many other related titles.  I'm pushing the K&P
book because Brian Kernighan just spoke at our local University today.  :-)
A great lecturer and a fine author!

The originall FAQ 1st version was posted in Dec. 19, by Robert Blum,

Most credits of this work to Linus, Robert and Ted, the rest was
either on the list posted by many (real) activists, not me ;-), either
in some other news groups, or else by direct posting to me (thanks
Humberto). I haven't copyrighted them, so thanks to every one who 
participated even indirectly to this FAQ.

[To find what has changed, view the `Cdiff-faq' in my previous posting. 
The last-change-date of this posting is always "two minutes ago".  :-)]

This is the introduction to a list of frequently asked questions (FAQ
for short) about Linux with answers (Yeap!).  This article contains a
listing of the sections, followed by the question/answer part.

This FAQ is supposed to reduce the noise level ;-) in the alt.os.linux
newsgroup (and also the 'linux-activists' mailing list), and spare the
time of many activists. I will post it twice a month, since there are
more and more new incomers, and new features.

BTW I think this FAQ should be available at the main Linux sites in
the doc directory (have you read this  Ary, Robert, Ted ?). So I will
send a copy to the main sites.

Please suggest any change, rephrasing, deletions, new questions,
answers ...  
Please include "FAQ" in the subject of messages sent to me about FAQ.  
Please use corsini@labri.greco-prog.fr whatever will be the From part 
of this message.


Thanks in advance,
				Marc <corsini@labri.greco-prog.fr>

Remind the vote for comp.os.linux;
post the YES vote to linux-yes@bloom.beacon.mit.edu
The voting period will last through 00:00 UTC (7:00pm EST), 19 March
1992. 

Future Plan:
	- verification/location/organization for files available 
	via FTP (I've tried what a mess!!)
	- cross posting this to news.answers as soon as comp.os.linux 
	is created.
	- reorganization of the FAQ. I don't know how, but I feel it's
	needed, any help appreciated.

I. LINUX GENERAL INFORMATION 
=============================


QUESTION: What is linux?

ANSWER: Linux is a small unix for 386-AT computers, that has the added
advantage of being free. It is still in beta-testing, but is slowly
getting useful even for somewhat real developement.  The current
version is 0.95a, date: March 17th 1992. The previous version v0.95
(March 7th) had some bugs, please do not use it anymore.


   Linux 0.95(a) is a freely distributable UNIX clone.  It implements a
subset of System V and POSIX functionality.  LINUX has been written
from scratch, and therefore does not contain any AT&T or MINIX
code--not in the kernel, the compiler, the utilities, or the
libraries.  For this reason it can be made available with the complete
source code via anonymous FTP.  LINUX runs only on 386/486 AT-bus
machines; porting to non-Intel architectures is likely to be
difficult, as the kernel makes extensive use of 386 memory management
and task primitives.


QUESTION: What is the current state of Linux?

ANSWER: do "finger torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi", or read the
alt.os.linux newsgroup.


QUESTION: I've just heard about linux, what should I do to get it?

ANSWER: First read all this FAQ, and the INFO-SHEET monthly post, then
go to the nearest ftp site (see below), download the Images there are
two a rootimage and a bootimage (in general in the images directory),
download the INSTALL and RELNOTES files.  Find the rawrite utility
(for example at tsx-11 it's in /pub/linux/INSTALL), then rawrite the
images on high density floppies (5.25 or 3.5), finally boot on the
root diskette and that's it.


QUESTION: Does it run on my computer?

ANSWER: Linux has been written on a clone-386, with IDE drives and a
VGA screen. It should work on most similar setups. The harddisk should
be AT-standard, and the system must be ISA.  A high density floppy
drive -- either 5".25 or 3".5

Otherwise the requirements seem relatively small: a 386 (SX, DX or any
486).  Any video card of the following: Hercules, CGA, EGA, (S)VGA.

It needs at least 2M to run, and 4M is definitely a plus. It can
happily use up to 16M (and more if you change some things).  People
are working on a SCSI-driver.

BTW it works for some ESDI drive (Joincom controller with Magtron
drive after you have commented out the "unexpected hd interrupt"-message
from hd.c). And quite recently for some SCSI adapter.


QUESTION: How would this operate in an OS/2 environment?

ANSWER: Fine.


QUESTION: Will linux run on a PC or 286-AT? If not, why?

ANSWER: Linux uses the 386 chip protected mode functions extensively,
and is a true 32-bit operating system. Thus x86 chips, x<3, will
simply not run it.


QUESTION: How big is the 'complete' Linux package?

ANSWER: Well, the boot and root image diskettes are about 750k
compressed.  The kernel sources are about 200k compressed, and the
libc sources are another 170k compressed.  The GNU C compiler is 670k,
and the other miscellaneous unix utilities are probably a bit over a
megabyte.

Now add sources to whatever you want to port and compile yourself.
The sources to GNU emacs are about 3 megabytes, compressed.  Groff (a
troff replacement) is just over 1 megabyte.

If you think this is big, remember that the OS/2 2.0 Limited
Availability release is 20 1.44 megabyte diskettes.


QUESTION: Since how long does linux exist?

ANSWER (partial): Few months, v0.10 went out in Nov. 91, v0.11 in Dec.
and the current version 0.95a is available since March 17th 92. But even
it is pretty recent it is quite reliable. There are very few and small
bugs and in its current state it is mostly useful for people who are
willing to port code and write new code.


QUESTION: What's about the copywright of linux.

ANSWER: This is an except of the RELEASE Notes v.095a: Linux-0.95a is
NOT public domain software, but is copyrighted by Linus Torvalds. The
copyright conditions are the same as those imposed by the GNU
copyleft: get a copy of the GNU copyleft at any major ftp-site (if it
carries linux, it probably carries a lot of GNU software anyway, and
they all contain the copyright).


QUESTION: Should I be a UNIX and/or a DOS wizard to install/use Linux?

ANSWER: Not at all, just follow the install rules, of course it will be
easier for you if you know things about Unix. Right now Linux is used
by more than 400 persons, very few of them enhance the kernel, some
adds/ports new soft and most of us are only (but USEFUL) beta testers.
So join us and choose your "caste"


QUESTION: What are the differences, pros and cons compared to Minix ?

ANSWER (partial): 
Cons: 
- Linux is not as mature as Minix, there is less working software right now.  
- Linux only works on 386 and 486 processors.  
- Linux needs 2M of memory just to run, 4M to be useful.  
- Linux is a more traditional unix kernel, it doesn't use message passing.

Pros: 
- Linux is free, and freely distributable, BUT copyrighted.  
- Linux has some advanced features such as:
  - Memory paging with copy-on-write
  - Demand loading of executables
  - Page sharing of executables
  - Multi-threaded file system
  - job control and virtual memory, virtual consoles and pseudo-ttys.
- Linux is a more traditional unix kernel, it doesn't use message
passing.


QUESTION: Does Linux use TSS segments to provide multitasking?

ANSWER: Yes!


QUESTION: If my PC runs under Linux, is it possible to ftp, rlogin,
rsh etc.. to other Unix boxes?

ANSWER: Not yet, but kermit has been ported to Linux, and the ka9q too.


QUESTION: Does linux do paging? Can I have virtual memory on my small
machine?

ANSWER: Linux0.95(a) does do paging in a better way than Linux0.12.


QUESTION: Can I have tasks spanning the full 4GB of addressable 386
memory? No more 64kB limits like in coherent or standard minix?

ANSWER: Linux does limit the task-size, but at a much more reasonable
64MB (MEGA-byte, not kilos), so bigger programs are no problem.


QUESTION: Does the bigger program sizes mean I can run X?

ANSWER: X is not ported to linux, and I hope it will be some day,
people are working hard on it but it's big, and wants a lot from
the system.


II. LINUX USEFUL ADRESSES 
=========================

QUESTION: Where can I get linux?

ANSWER: Linux can be gotten by anonymous ftp from
	nic.funet.fi (128.214.6.100):
		directory /pub/OS/Linux
	Tupac-Amaru.Informatik.RWTH-Aachen.DE (137.226.112.31):
		directory /pub/msdos/replace
	tsx-11.mit.edu (18.172.1.2):
		directory /pub/linux
	ftp.eecs.umich.edu (141.212.99.7):
		directory linux
        src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7):
		directory /pub/os/Linux
	hpb.mcc.ac.uk (130.88.200.7):
		directory pub/linux
	ustsun.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp (133.11.11.11):
		directory misc/linux

You might want to check out which of these is the most up-to-date.

If you don't have ftp-capability, you are in trouble. See next Q/A.  If
you have no uncompress utility, there are a lot even for DOS, have a
look on SIMTEL, or else use facilities provided by some sites to
uncompress for you. Don't do that if you can, because it's lengthy,
expensive and causes troubles to other users on ftp sites.


QUESTION: I do not have FTP access, what can I do to get linux?

ANSWER: Try to contact a friend on the net with those access, or try
mailserver/ftpmail server otherwise contact tytso@ATHENA.MIT.EDU. You
might try mailing "mailserver@nic.funet.fi" with "help" in the body of
the mail.  If you choose ftpmail server (example: ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com),
with "help" in the body, the server will send back instructions and
command list. As an exemple to get the list of files available at tsx-11
in /pub/linux send:

		mail ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
		subject: anything
		reply <your e-mail>
		connect tsx-11.mit.edu
		chdir /pub/linux
		dir -R
		quit

QUESTION: Is there a newsgroup or mailing-list about linux? Where can
I get my questions answered? How about bug-reports?

ANSWER: alt.os.linux is formed, and comp.os.linux is on the way, for
those who can't access to the news you can ask for digest to:
Linux-Activists-request@NEWS-DIGESTS.MIT.EDU. On the other hand, mail
sent to Linux-Activists@NEWS-DIGESTS.MIT.EDU are posted to
alt.os.linux

DO NOT mail "I want to [un]subscribe" to the newsgroup, use
the request-address. IF not your mail-box will be over-crowded by
activists.

Questions and bug-reports can be sent either to the newsgroup or to
"torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi", depending on which you find more
appropriate.

BTW People are working on the organization of Linux, this is done on
a separate mailing-list.

linux-standards: Discussion of distribution and directory standards
for the Linux operating system, including directory structure, file
location, and release disk format.

Requests to be added to this list must be sent to:
	      linux-standards-request@banjo.concert.net

QUESTION: Does there exist a place where the traffic of the newsgroup
is kept?

ANSWER: Yes, on nic and tsx-11 (see the ftp adresses above)

III. INSTALLATION and SECURITY 
==============================

QUESTION: How can I be sure I won't be writing over anything
important?  I have to use DOS on my machine, and I don't want to
lose any files.

ANSWER: Back up everything. Just in case. Then, write some easily
recognizable pattern to the partition you have reserved for linux,
using some DOS tool. You can then use "cat /dev/hdX" under linux to
examine which of the partitions you used.


QUESTION: Linux mkfs doesn't accept the size I give the device,
although I double-checked with fdisk, and it's correct.

ANSWER: Be sure you give the size in BLOCKS, ie 1024 bytes, not
sectors. The mkfs doesn't work for very big partition (over than 64
Megs). Also, make doubly certain that you have the correct partition.

There are a few rules about this: /dev/hda (under linux0.95a) corresponds
to /dev/hd0 (under minix) and /dev/hdb (linux0.95a) to /dev/hd5
(minix).  DO NOT USE THEM, they are the whole raw
disk, not partitions. Also if a partition is on drive 1 under minix
(ie /dev/hd1-4), it is drive 1 under linux as well.  Moreover, there
is no real consensus on whether partition #1 is the first partition on
the disk, or is the first entry in the partition table.  Some parition
programs sort this information on the screen only, some will write the
sorted information back to the hard disk.  Linux assumes that the
first entry is hda1, and so if some utility starts sorting/reordering
the table these things can change.  Moreover, do not use extended
partition (this is in the installation notes). 

REMARK Minix does some reordering.

A useful hack is to make each of your partitions a different size.
Then after any editting or possible change to the partition table you
can boot a floppy system and run fdisk (linux's, not DOS) to see if
the assignments still hold.


QUESTION: I have a one partitionned 40Mb disk. If I run mkfs, what
happens?

ANSWER: If you do that, you will have an empty 40Mb Linux file system
(currently the same fs as Minix). You should, at least, make on your
hard disk, one partition per operating system you want to use.


QUESTION: I mounted the linux filesystem, and copied the files from
the root-disk to the harddisk. Now I cannot find them any more, and
somethimes linux dies with a "panic: trying to free unused inode".

ANSWER: You have probably forgot to sync before rebooting. Linux, like
all unices, use a "buffer cache" to speed up reads and writes to disk.
On a machine that has enough memory, this buffer-cache is 1.5MB, and
if you forget to sync before exiting, it may not be fully written out
to disk. Re-mkfs and re-install (or try to use the preliminary fsck,
but remember that although fsck tries to correct the faults it finds,
it may fail.)


IV. LINUX and DOS 
=================

QUESTION: Is it possible to access to DOS world from Linux

ANSWER: Yes, there is the mtools package (with patches for devices.c)
The original sources of mtools can be found at any places not only at
nic, tupac and tsx-11, and the patches for Linux (with fix for big DOS
partitions are in the directory patches or ports). Moreover you should
download the file patch.Z to apply patches :)
It is possible to find the compiled mtools stuff at mcc (see above for
the adress)


QUESTION: the mtools package won't work. I get an ENOENT error message
for all devices.

ANSWER: mtools needs to be told which device to look for. Use 'ln' or
'mknod' to create a special file called "/dev/dosX", where X is A, B,
C, X or Y. A and B are for floppies (12 bits), C is for hard disk and
X, Y for any. This file should point to the device you want to read.
About the minor/major pair have a look in section INSTALLATION HINTS.


QUESTION: What is as86.tar.Z ?

ANSWER: It's the port of Bruce Evans' minix assembler, you need it to 
be able to recompile Linux at your convenience.


QUESTION: Turbo (Microsoft) Assembler won't compile the Linux boot
code.  In fact, some of the opcodes in these files look completely
unfamiliar.  Why?

ANSWER: The Linux boot codes are written in Bruce Evans' minix
assembler, which has the same opcodes as the original minix assembler
ported to linux get as86.tar.Z Anyway there are a few differences
between these and normal DOS assemblers:

 - No segments - everything is in the same segment (at least in the
   bootsectors and setup, as they don't use the .data segments)

 - mov[b|w|l] are shorter versions of mov ax,[byte|word|long] ptr
[XXX].
   This is how unix assemblers normally give the size (byte, word or
long).
   Gas has similar constructs.

 - There is no "jmp short", the opcodes are "j" for a short jump and
   "jmp" for a long one.

 - "jmpi" is a jump with a segment:offset pair. I don't know how this
is
   written in DOS assembly.

Hi (again)
This is the second part of the FAQ.

--------
V. SOME CLASSICAL PROBLEMS 
==========================

QUESTION: While running du I get "Kernel panic: free_inode: bit
already cleared".  Also, du produces a ENOENT error for all the files
in certain of my directories.  What's going on?

ANSWER: These are both consistent with a bad file-system.  That's
relatively easy to produce by not syncing before rebooting, as linux
usually has 1.5MB of buffer space held in memory (unless you have <=4M
RAM, in which case the buffers are only about 0.5MB). Also linux
doesn't do anything special about the bit-map blocks, and as they are
used often, those are the thing most likely to be in memory. If you
reboot, and they haven't been written to disk ...

Just do an fsck on the device, the -a flag might repair it otherwise,
the only thing to do is to reinstall the filesystem from the Images.

A sync is done only every 30 seconds normally (standard unix
practice), so do one by hand (some people think you should do 3 syncs
after each other, but that's superstition), or by logging out from the
startup-shell, which automatically syncs the system. Unmounting a
filesystem also syncs it (but of course you can never unmount root).

Another (sad) possibility is that you have bad blocks on your disk.
Not very probable, as they would have to be in the inode-tables, just
a couple of blocks in size. Again there aren't programs available to
read a disk for bad sectors and put them in some kind of
"bad-sector-file".  On IDE drives this is no problem (bad sectors are
automatically mapped away).


QUESTION: How can I partition my hard-drive to use Linux?

ANSWER: There are (at least) two ways to answer this. The easy way is
probably to use a program which will do it for you, such as the MS-DOS
fdisk, Minix fdisk, Xenix/Unix fdisk, or programs such as edpart.exe 
or part.exe.

On the other hand, you can use a disk editor and modify the contents
of the partition table directly. This has been already done, and an
extensive explanatory note can be found in the mailing-list archives 
(25th Jan. 92).

BTW It might be useful to set three (3) separated partitions for
Linux, one for the root, another one for the usr and a third one for
swap, as an illustration, my root partition is 10Meg, the usr is 22Meg
and the swap partition is 8Meg (twice the size of RAM on my box). As 
an experience I have used MS-DOS fdisk to partition my two hd and got 
no peculiar difficulties.

QUESTION: What must I do to mkfs a floppy?

ANSWER: blocks are of size 1K so 1.44 floppy is 1440 blocks. The
floppy has to be formatted before this will work.


QUESTION: When I run kermit under Linux, I get "Warning, Read access
to lock directory denied". What am I doing wrong?

ANSWER: Nothing, you just need to create /usr/spool/uucp, which is
where kermit like to lock files.


QUESTION: du seems buggy when i used it the number of disk occupation
is wrong.

ANSWER: Take care, if you want size in kbytes use the -k flags.


QUESTION: du works just fine on directories, except on / and /dev,
moreover "ls -l" returns either big or negative number on /dev. Why?

ANSWER: This is a "feature" added in Linux 0.12; it was originally
present in Minix; more specifically, when you stat a device file
belong to a block device, it will return the maximum size of the block
device in the st_size member of the stat structure. If you don't like
it, it's very simple to patch it out. Look in the fs/inode.c, in the
subroutine read_inode().
BTW I have not tested it under 0.95a

QUESTION: When I try to (un)compress many files in one command, the
command partially fails?

ANSWER: This is a bug, many partial fixes are floating around but ..
You can solve it by a bash command "for i in whateverfiles;do 
compress $i; done". Another possibility is to download the
compress-fixed.tar file.


QUESTION Sometimes, I get "mount can't open lock file"; what does this
means? 

ANSWER: This can happened for two reason: 
A) You try to mount something as non-root. In that case you can either
retry as root, or set the setuid bit to mount.
B) You are root. mount wants to open /etc/mtab and /etc/mtab~ - the
first one for reading, the second as lock file. If there is already a
mtab~ remove it. This can happen if you used once gnuemacs on mtab.

VI. INSTALLATION HINTS 
======================

QUESTION: Where can I find the basic starting help?

ANSWER: You have to download the INSTALL notes, and more specially
the 0.11, 0.12 and the current one 0.95(a). Pretty soon, a special
help for beginners will be available on the net.


QUESTION: I've got all the things on site ??? but I don't know what
goes where.

ANSWER: include.tar.Z goes to /usr/include;  system.tar.Z contains 
the latest sources of the
system files (mkswap, mkfs, fsck and fdisk). In version 0.12
utilbin.tar.Z has been replaced by fileutil.tar.Z and utils.tar.Z
which contains a new tar to handle the symbolic links, make, uemacs
kermit and minor programs (sed,...).  Other utilities have been ported
separately.


QUESTION: I don't know how to install gcc stuff, is there special places?

ANSWER: It depends on the release of gcc you are using. Right now
there are 3 packages : the original one gccbin.tar.Z contains all
the gcc-1.37 binary distrib; recently the gcc-1.40 has been ported,
it's in newgcc.tar.Z and a few days ago the BETA version of gcc-2.0 
Choose yours

A) gccbin.tar.Z goes in /usr/local/lib except gcc which goes in 
/usr/local/bin. Moreover each gcc-xxx of /usr/local/lib should be 
linked with gxxx and xxx in /usr/local/bin. 

B) newgcc.tar.Z goes in /usr, then uncompress and untar it. Files are
directed to /usr/lib, /usr/include and /usr/bin. You have to link ar,
as, ld with gar, gas and gld, this will prevent some error while using
make (especially whilst re-compiling Linux kernel). More information can 
be found in section VIII. 

C) gcc-2.0 is splitted in 2 files 2lib.tar.Z and 2misc.tar.Z, to
install them do the following:
cd /usr
tar xvofvz 2misc.tar.Z

read the FAQ in /usr/gcc2/install. Then

cd /usr
tar xvovfz 2lib.tar.Z


QUESTION: When I use the images, and i type "tar xvf ..." I got
"command not found". What did I wrong?

ANSWER: Nothing, in the distribution of 0.95 there is no tar (due to
lack of place); you should get the 0.12 images where the tar is in 
compressed form (lack of place). You have first to copy tar.Z on 
another disk/diskette and uncompress it, this command is available 
on your diskettes.


QUESTION: It seems that $#@! ported on linux don't run correctly

ANSWER: Possible, but check first if the size of your file corresponds
to the one on the ftp sites, if it is then check the BUGLIST available
on the main linux sites. If the bug is not reported, do a complete
report of the error, try to correct it and send your result to
johnsonm@stolaf.edu.


QUESTION: Does anyone port this to linux?, if not i'll compile it

ANSWER: First check on the sites, have a look to the info-sheet
monthly post and also available on sites. Have a look in the "old"
digest files and mail-archives of linux-activists, these are kept at
least at tsx-11 and nic possibly at tupac. Look also at the GNU(*)
utilities to see if someone has already written a freely distribuable
version. Ask then on the list/news.


(*) GNU stands for GNU's Not Unix, which (besides being a recursive
acronym) is a project started by the Free Software Foundation (the FSF)
to write a freely distributable version of Unix.  The GNU kernel is
named HURD, and is based on Mach.  It is currently being written, and is
not yet done.  Many of the GNU utilities, however, are completed and are
much more functional than the original Unix utilities.  Since they are
freely available, Linux is using them as well.


QUESTION: I've ported *** to Linux, what should i do to add it in the 
standard distribution?

ANSWER: Read first the previous Q/A, then to make something available to
others you have to post it (with cdiffs of the source, a short README if
needed) in the incoming directory of one of nic,tupac,tsx-11, then drop
a short note to the list/group and to the site advisor.  
On nic    it's arl@sauna.cs.hut.fi (Ari Lemmke)
On tupac  it's blum@cip-s01.informatik.rwth-aachen.de (Robert Blum)
On tsx-11 it's tytso@athena.mit.edu (Ted Ts'o)


QUESTION: I want to port *** to Linux, what are the flags?

ANSWER: Recall that Linux implements subset of SYSV and POSIX, so
-DUSG and -DPOSIX work in general. Moreover throw away most of the ld
flags such as -ltermcap, -lg, since the libg.a and libtermcap.a are
missing.


QUESTION: Linux lacks on ****/ Linux has a bug in ***, what are the
rules to enhance/correct the kernel?

ANSWER: Before anything check if some one else is working on that
subject, contact those people, since end february a buglist (thanks to
Michael Johnson) is kept on the major sites. Test your improvment (it
should work is NOT enough), then send the patches in cdiffs form to
Linus and/or the list, moreover the localization must be clear. This
does NOT mean that bug-reports and patches are not accepted. Moreover,
you should sent a brief note to Michael: johnsonm@stolaf.edu


QUESTION: I seem to be unable to compile anything with gcc. Why?

ANSWER: If you have only 2 MB RAM, gcc will die silently without
compiling anything. You must have at least 4 MB to do compilations

BTW Since swapping is possible, I have heard that compilation is
possible with only 2Meg and a lot disk traffic :) Isn't it great?

QUESTION: I'm using a program that uses signal handlers which are
installed using sigaction() with the SA_NOMASK, and they get a general
protection error right after the signal handler tries to return.
What's going wrong?

ANSWER: You are using a libc.a that has an out-of-date signal.o and
sig_restore.o file, and they don't know how to deal with SA_NOMASK.
(The one in gccbin.tar.Z is out-of-date). Get the new libc.a and put
it in /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib. Again check your compiler version


QUESTION: gcc complains about not finding crt0.o and the system
include files What am I doing wrong ?

ANSWER: The include files normal place is in /usr/include. lib*.a and
*.o should be in /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib


QUESTION: While compiling some GNU packages gcc chokes on regex.c with
an insn code, what can I do?

ANSWER: There is a little bug in the port of gcc-1.37, this will be
corrected on the port of v2.0 (with g++). Right now throw away the -O
flag (to compile regex) and every thing will be alright.

BTW there are some minor bugs with this release of gcc because it was
compiled under linux-0.10, whith odd libraries. These problems have
disappeared with the new gcc-1.40 package.

QUESTION: I tried to port a /new/ version of gnu stuff. But in the
linking phase, gcc complains about the missing libg.a.

ANSWER: Yes this is well known, throw away the flag -g that's all,
anyway libg.a is /only/ for debugging purpose.


QUESTION: What are the device minor/major numbers?

ANSWER: (early Linus mail Nov. 6th 91, last update Jan. 19th 92)
		Memory devices: Major = 1 (characted devices) minor
0	/dev/ram 
1	/dev/mem 
2	/dev/kmem - not implemented (easy, but I haven't done it) 
3	/dev/null 
4	/dev/port (implemented, but untested - don't play with it)

example: "mknod /dev/null c 1 3"


		Floppy disks: Major = 2 (block devices)

minor = drive + 4*type, drive = 0,1,2,3 for A,B,C or D-diskette

type	1: 360kB floppy in 360kB drive (5.25")
	2: 1.2M floppy in 1.2M drive (5.25")
	3: 360kB floppy in 720kB/1.44Mb drive (3.5")
	4: 720kB floppy in 720kB/1.44Mb drive (3.5")
	5: 360kB floppy in 1.2M drive (5.25")
	6: 720kB floppy in 1.2M drive (5.25")
	7: 1.44M floppy in 1.44M drive (3.5")

Thus minor nr for a 1.44Mb floppy in B is: 1 + 4*7 = 29, and to read
an old 360kB floppy in a 1.2M A-drive you need to use minor= 0 + 4*5 
= 20.

Example: "mknod /dev/PS0 b 2 28" (b for block: 2 for floppy, 28 for
1.44 in A)


		Hard disks: Major = 3 (block devices) minor
0	/dev/hda - The whole hd0, including partition table sectors
etc.  
1	/dev/hda1 - first partition on hd0 
....  
4	/dev/hda4 - fourth partition on hd0 
5	/dev/hda5 - Extended partition
65	/dev/hdb  - The whole hd1, again including partition table info 
66	/dev/hdb1 - first partition on hd1
....  
69	/dev/hdb4 - fourth partition on hd1
70	/dev/hdb5 - extended partition on hd1

NOTE! Be /very/ careful with /dev/hda and /dev/hdb - you seldom need
them, and if you write to them you can destroy the partition tables:
something you probably don't want.  The only things that use /dev/hda
are things like "fdisk" etc.

NOTE 2!! The names for hd's are no longer the same as under minix,
there is a straightforward correspondance, but I think
minix orders the partitions in some way (so that the partition numbers
will be in the same order as the partitions are physically on the
disk).  Linux doesn't order anything: it has the partitions in the
same order as in the partition table (ie /dev/hd?1 might be physically
after /dev/hd?2).

NOTE 3!! Extended partitions are recently detected, use them VERY VERY
carefully.

			Tty's: Major = 4 (character devices) minor
0	/dev/tty0 	- general console 1 -
63			- reserved for virtual console
64-127			- reserved for serial io
128-			- reserved for pty's

And more particularly we have: 
64	/dev/tty64 	- com1
65	/dev/tty65 	- com2


QUESTION: How to start Linux from drive B?

ANSWER: There is a DOS utility called boot_b.exe (look at DOS ftp).
Another simple way is to open the box and invert the cables.

QUESTION: The program boot_b works fine /but/ once the first disk is
read the system go back to the first drive, any hints?

ANSWER: Yes, change the bootimage in just the same way that you change
it to boot on the hard drive, execept that the major/minor pair is
different. All these information are in the file INSTALL-0.10.
Remember that if you use a sun or other endian machine, you will need
to reverse the byte order when you run the filter program (also in the
same file).


VII. FEATURES 

=============

QUESTION: I've read that linux has virtual consoles, what must I do to
get them?

ANSWER: Yes there are, you can access them with the left <alt>-key
together with <Fn>-key. With the Linux 0.95a Images distribution, 4
consoles are available, agetty runs on them. 

BTW: the serial ports are now /dev/tty64 and /dev/tty65. tty0 is the
general console. tty128- are reserved to pty's


QUESTION: What kind of shell is /bin/sh ?

ANSWER: Until v0.95 it's the Bourne Again Shell, bash-1.11 and 
compilation was straightforward (Linus dixit), just "make" 
that's all or nearly. But as the shell comes bigger and bigger the
v0.95a /bin/sh is ash the BSD 4.3 sh.


QUESTION: Does there exist a man page for **** ?

ANSWER: Download man.tar.Z from your favorite linux ftp site, there is
most of the fileutils man page -- either **** or g****, example there
is nothing on ld, but there is for gld :) --, check the whatis
database provided. The files in the cat1 dir are pre-formatted man
pages that the man program can use.

BTW there is no roff,troff nor nroff for Linux. Cawf 2.0 works just
fine for simple man pages, and a partial ms support too.


QUESTION: What are the editors available in linux?

ANSWER: Right now there are uemacs, elvis-1.4, some one (R. Blum)
is working on some other vi clone. The port of emacs 18.57 has been
done by John T Kohl, files can be found at the different sites
at nic 		it's in the directory xtra
at tsx-11	it's in the directory ports/emacs-18.57.
Also the port of mg (micro gnu) has been done and can be found at
least at athos.rutgers.edu (128.6.4.4) in pub/linux, mg is the binary
and mg.tar.Z is the sources file.

QUESTION: Does there exist a printer package for Linux?

ANSWER: There are lp patches for linux.0.12, which implement a
parallel printer interface and feature a greatly improved driver
design. the patches are in lp.12.tar.Z As I have no printer (yet), I
don't know how good it is. There is nothing yet for 0.95(a).


QUESTION: Does there exist a ps for Linux?

ANSWER: Yes in ps095.tar.Z I have not tested it yet.

QUESTION: It's nice to have the df utility, but it would be nicer if
it would give statistics of the root file system. Would it be
difficult to do?

ANSWER: surely not, in your file /etc/rc, instead of the line
			> etc/mtab
put the following
		  	echo "/dev/hdX (root)" > /etc/mtab
where the X is the hard drive you use as root partition. 


QUESTION: How do I make swapping work?, when I boot I get the
following message: "Unable to get size of swap device"

ANSWER: There are two ways (as far as I know). Recompile the kernel
and makes the swap device available (have a look in the main
Makefile). Or else you can modify the bootimage, in that case you have
to put a full device number in the word reserved for the swap device:
the logic is the same as for the root device. Thus, if you want
/dev/hda2 to be your swap-device, you'll have to write a 2 (minor nr)
into byte 506, and a 3 (= harddisk) into byte 507. You can use
virtually the same program as for the root-device (look in INSTALL
files). 


QUESTION: When I boot I get one of the following messages:
"Unable to find swap signature" or "Bad swap-space bitmap"

ANSWER: You probably forgot to make your swap-device, use the mkswap
command. 


QUESTION: How do I know if it is swapping?

ANSWER: You will notice it :)) First of all, Linux tells you at boot
time, "Adding swap: XXX pages of swap space", and if you start running
out of memory, you will notice that the disk will work overtime, and
things slow down. Generally a 2Meg RAM will make the system swap
constantly while running gcc, 4 Meg will swap occasionnaly when
optimizing big files (and having other things active, such as make).


QUESTION: Is there only the %$#@ keyboard ?

ANSWER: There are Dannish, Finnish, French, German, Uk and US
keyboards. Set it in linux/kernel/chr_drv/keyboard.S, then  
compile the kernel again.


QUESTION: Does there exist shared libs ?

ANSWER: They seem to work. The kernel features are in Linux 0.12
already. 


QUESTION: Does Linux permit/support bitmapped graphics on vga/svga 
cards?

ANSWER: No, there is no interface for graphics operations on Linux
(yet). Some work has been done by Orest Zborowski (mmap/munmap, and
vga demonstration). The (un)mmap was patches for 0.12 kernel, but I've
been told that new versions (for 0.95a) will be out in a short while.

QUESTION: There are a lot of patches available (fd patch, lp patch
login patch ...) can I be fairly confident the subsequent patches will
work?

ANSWER: This is not true yet for the current version; but it will be
so I kept it :) 
No you can't, patching is a real beta tester art :)).  People are not
working on the same patched release, so you have to check if the
patches you already applied works on the same kernel part, if not,
/great/, just apply them. If yes, check if there is an order, patch
creator knows that, and (should) try to warn patch user (in other
words: beta tester) otherwise you should edit the patch files (and
possibly make a brief note to others on this list/newsgroup or even a
cdiff) before applying them, another solution is to keep cool and wait
for the next version of Linux where, in general, the modifications
have been done but this behavior is /not/ Linux helpful.


QUESTION: I got the patches on some ftp sites, and applied them to the
kernel and tried to compile. It didn't !!. Are the patches buggy?

ANSWER: Before remake, just do a make clean in the directories
involved by the patches. This will force a rebuild of the .o and .a
files. 
If you have a RCS running on your source tree, did you checked a
patched version of the files changed before /any/ CO either by you or
make


VIII. MORE HINTS 
================ 

This part is recent and try to keep track of the different information
that appeared in alt.os.linux and on the list since beginning of
February. I tried to update it for v0.95(a), so there might be some
mistakes. Moreover take care to use the correct library and include
stuff for linux-0.12 and the ad-hoc gcc you use !!!


QUESTION: How can I backup my Hd under Linux ?

ANSWER: I know at least two ways. One possibility is tar and mtools,
another possibility is the diskbackup/diskrestore of Diamano Bolla
(digest44 vol. #1) which saves big hd to floppies using the
stdin/stdout. These utilities have been uploaded to the major sites in
file disksplit.tar.Z.
An example usage (Roger Binns) is:

tar cvf - bin dev usr etc .. | compress | diskbackup

and to restore:

diskrestore | uncompress | tar xvf -


QUESTION: How to use setterm: for the novice?

ANSWER:The setterm utility provides access to most of Virtual Consoles
(VCs) functionality.  You can set your screen up to blank at 10
minutes using:
	        setterm -blank 10

You can set colors, and clear the screen.  For a full list of commands,
just type "setterm" with no arguments.
        
There are a few tricks with the screen dumper can really make VCs go a 
long way.  Here are a few of the common ones that I use:

		setterm dump

Dumps the contents of the current VC to screen.dump (in the current dir).
					
		setterm dump 4
				
Dumps the contents of VC 4 to screen.dump
		
		setterm -file mydumpfile -dump 4

Dump the contents of VC 4 to the file mydumpfile

		setterm -file /dev/tty0 -dump 4

Dumps the contents of VC 4 to the current VC.
					
		setterm -file /dev/tty4 -dump

Dumps the contents of the current VC to VC 4.
		
		setterm -file /dev/tty64 -dump
				
Dumps the contents of the current VC to the serial port.
Handy if you are logged on and want to paste a screen full without
having to resort to doing a file transfer.

		setterm -file mydumpfile -append 4
				
Appends to instead of overwriting the dump file.  Useful if you
have several screens you wish to concatenate.


QUESTION: I know there are VC, but where is the setterm stuff?

ANSWER: It's in the current distribution (i.e. on the images)


QUESTION: While using emacs in 80x25 mode, the mode line is constantly
moving around, why?

ANSWER: This appear to be a bug in the scroll region handling of the
console. Some one has suggested to simply remove the last entry in the
vt100 termcap that refers to the scroll region escape. Namely remove
the cs entry.


QUESTION: When I use make as non root, it doesn't work, why?

ANSWER: ?????, the message is either (null) setuid ..., or (null)
setgid... I don't know how to fix it. 
BTW This problem does not exist with the pmake (make for BSD 4.3 Reno
and BSD 4.4) package. 


QUESTION: How can I get Linux to boot directly from the harddisk?

ANSWER: Right now, this can be done via the shoelace stuff or the
bootany package.


QUESTION: Sometimes, when I want to remove a directory, I get an error
message, is it a (known) bug?

ANSWER: No, There is no bug at all, you probaly have another shell 
on another VC whose working directory is either the one you try to 
remove, either a subdirectory of it.


QUESTION: can anyone give me a sample /etc/inittab entry for login
from a pc attached to serial line /dev/tty65? 

ANSWER: "Humberto speaking :)"
First step up the modem to turn off echo and enable auto answer, I do
this in kermit by connecting to the modem and typing "ate0s0=1"
followed by enter (w/o quotes). Then setup inittab to spawn getty on
the modem
tty65:console:/etc/agetty -m 1200 tty65

Then it should work. Some modems can be permanently set to disable
echo and set auto answer, see your manual.

QUESTION: When compiling some code, cc1 complains about some insn
code, what's that? 

ANSWER: An insn is an internal representation that gcc uses when
compiling. The main part of gcc is to take ordinary c (or c++) code,
and compile it, while ding optimizations in insn part, which is
soft/hard independant. Then another part which is hard/Os dependant
takes the insns and translate it in assembly language. The fix is only
to turn off the optimization flag (-O) or download the new gcc release
(1.4) which has been made available at tsx-11 (newgcc.tar.Z and the
ad-hoc libraries newlibc.tar.Z).


QUESTION: While compiling some stuff, I'm getting the following 
error message:
Undefined symbol ___addsf3 referenced from text segment
as well as ___mulsf3 and __cmpsf2. 
These symbols are not in the program or in it's header files.

ANSWER: These are math helper functions, and you can usually compile
these programs to use the kernel floating point routines by adding
'-m80387' to the compiler switches. If the program does any wierd 
fp math (exp(), sin()) it'll die when you run it though.


QUESTION: What are the enhancement of the newgcc.tar.Z ?

ANSWER: There were some bugs in the old port that have been corrected, 
moreover this package contains 387 support 
there is libm.a (for those with 387)
	 libsoft.a (for those without, I for example)
	 libtermcap.a (from tput 1.10)

The -mstring-insns option is no longer needed nor supported :( [As
an example to recompile (successfully) linux0.12 you have to throw away 
this flag in all the Makefile]

gcc-1.40 has some registers problem, you should had -fcombine-regs
flag while compiling (the linux kernel for example)

BTW Notice also that include files have changed (stdio.h which is no 
more ansi compliant).


QUESTION What's about gcc2.0 ?

ANSWER: It has been ported to linux, but remember that gcc2.0 is an
ALPHA, it is not stable at all (have a look in gnu.gcc.bug or
gnu.gcc.help). Anyway the files are 2lib.tar.Z and 2misc.tar.Z
Uncompress and untar 2misc, read the FAQ and play with it.

QUESTION: I've been trying to get Linux to run on my [3/4]86 box. It
can't even boot. Any suggestions?

ANSWER: The most common error/problem is writing the bootimage to a
low density disk. It fits, but the bootstrap code will only recognize
high density disk. So try to format explicitely disk as high density:
- for 3.5",  'format a: /n:18 /t:80 '
- for 5.25", 'format a: /n:15 /t:80 '


QUESTION: Does there exist games, languages (other than C), and
anything which make the system more friendly?

ANSWER: Yes, among other things there are rogue and yatzee; TeX;
Prolog.. but in general, if you want some extra tool port it to Linux
this is also a good beta-testing exercice.


QUESTION: Does emacs handle the arrows-key

ANSWER: Yes it does, one simple way is to put some elisp code in your
..emacs, this is an except of mine:

(global-unset-key "\e[")
(setq esc-c-map(make-keymap))
(fset 'esc-c-prefix esc-c-map)
(define-key global-map "\e[" 'esc-c-prefix)
(define-key global-map "\e[B" 'next-line)
(define-key global-map "\e[A" 'previous-line)
(define-key global-map "\e[C" 'forward-char)
(define-key global-map "\e[D" 'backward-char)

The keycode was obtained by ^Q followed by the key


QUESTION: Whenever I use uemacs 3.1X on a symlink, the symlink does
not exist anymore, why?

ANSWER: (Tristram Mabbs) Since ue3.10, uemacs uses 'safe save' mode,
writing the file to a temporary and moving it OVER the original. In
the process, this deletes the original. To prevent this just add the
following in your emacs '.rc' file: set $ssave FALSE

Nachpt.  You could also put it in the disk driver, a la Stacker.  This would
have the advantage of cleanliness, though you'd only get page-by-page
compression.

But... naah.  I think it would actually do best in the buffer cache.
Whenever you load a chunk of data in, you decompress it; whenever you store
it back, you recompress it.

Random access shouldn't be a problem, but from what I know of compression
algorithms writing is.  Most files on a system are only read, anyway, so
this shouldn't be much of a problem.

   Yup.  Most of us suckers here in North America can't get mail to you.
   The UK gateway refuses our mail, stating that [we] are not an
   'authorized sender' (or is it 'user' ?)

Since I started this after getting a bounce from mailing Iain (on
investigating, you got an automatic reply saying his account wasn't
authorized) and then jumping to conclusions and posting... I'll
explain.

I have since learned that over the weekend, there was a problem with
some of the relay machines over in the UK. Apparently a disk filled
and so a list of hosts authorized to receive mail from the US, which
gets built nightly, was prematurely truncated. Actually all hosts on
the JAnet over there are authorized to get mail from here; this I
would guess covers most UK posters. The result was this erroneous
bounce. I presume this is now corrected (I haven't gotten a bounce in
the last day or so), so if you have been having trouble mailing
someone there, just try again. I don't think the ~5 hour mail
propagation time to there is going to change soon, though :-(.

In the meantime boyer@sumax.seattleu.edu was collecting US
suggestions; perhaps you guys ought to get together over the newly
working mail link :-). Both postings looked like a good start. 

Enough mailer stuff, now back to our regularly scheduled hacking...

	The vt100 response string doesn't work!

I'm running kermit, connected to my school computer, and it uses

Okay, I've been looking at this further, and it appears the output
from copy_to_cooked is not being flushed properly.  Using a small test
program that sends ESC-Z to the screen, I've found that Linux doesn't
respond until one of two things happens:  if the test program is run
on the remote computer, a keypress causes the response string to be
sent, and if it's run on my computer (under Linux, obviously), the
string is sent immediately.

The program: (watch out, it's a big one! :)

main() { printf("\033Z"); }

Any ideas?  (Linus?)

Are others having this problem?  You will want to be absolutely sure
that you've set yourself up for 'binary' mode transfers when ftp'ing
and anywhere else along the line (with kermit, etc).

You can check to see if the checksum's match with what I got if you
have a 'sum' program available on your machine.  I get the following
output:

25001	624	rootimage-0.95a.Z

This is true for both my copy on my machine and on my school's
machine.  This should be a decent indicator of whether your transfer
went okay or not.

So I'm not going insane after all!

I got this very same problem today.  I didn't try nic.funet.fi, but I
copied the file several times from tsx-11 and got the same symptoms as
you.

Can this please be fixed soon?

Thanks.

There has been a change at tsx-11:  When you drop things off in
/incoming, send mail to ftp-linux@tsx-11.mit.edu.  This way, both Ted
and I will get the mail, and whoever gets to it first will put it up

Hello, world,

I have just FTPed the latest version of Linux, 0.95a. The boot image seems
to be OK. 

But I am unable to uncompress the root image. My compress
commmand on DOS simply gives me an error message "file token bad in
root95a.Z". I tried it on a SunOS, with compress command went crazy: I
saw the uncompressed file size growing well over 1,600,000 bytes, and
compress was still running.

Is there a problem with this root image?

I tried the root image both from Finland and MIT. They are the same.

By some evil twist of fate, the rootimage-0.95a.Z uploaded to
nic.funet.fi was corrupted in transit, and as a result, was also
corrupt on tsx-11.mit.edu.  I have uploaded a fresh copy to tsx-11,
and this will be available momentarily (the last five minutes have
been a flurry of email for me :).

I will also be uploading a new copy to nic.funet.fi momentarily, but
I'm not sure when this will become available.  Watch this space for
details....  (For US users, you're better off waiting for tsx-11 to
get it to reduce the transatlantic net.load - especially since the
root image is more than 600k....)

I apologize profusely for the problems this has caused.

The rootimage for .95a at tsx-11 now appears to be good (i.e. it
uncompresses flawlessly) due to quick action on the part of Jim
Winstead.

You can find out by looking in /usr/include/errno.h and in

you can't get you system up and running. (by the way, most programs

(DOS) BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO LINUX v0.95a
--------------------------------------
Comments enclosed in double brackets: (( text )) 'are' the
inclusions
by Chuck Boyer and are the 'DOS-beginner's-guide-to-linux.'

          RELEASE NOTES FOR LINUX v0.95
          Linus Torvalds, March 7, 1992

          COPYRIGHT

Linux-0.95 is NOT public domain software, but is copyrighted by me.


The copyright conditions are the same as those imposed by the GNU
copyleft: 
get a copy of the GNU copyleft at any major ftp-site (if it carries
linux, 
it probably carries a lot of GNU software anyway, and they all
contain the 
copyright). 

The copyleft is pretty detailed, but it mostly just means that you
may
freely copy linux for your own use, and redistribute all/parts of
it, as
long as you make source available (not necessarily in the same
distribution, but you make it clear how people can get it for
nothing
more than copying costs).  Any changes you make that you distribute
will
also automatically fall under the GNU copyleft.

NOTE! The linux unistd library-functions (the low-level interface
to
linux: system calls etc) are excempt from the copyright - you may
use
them as you wish, and using those in your binary files won't mean
that
your files are automatically under the GNU copyleft.  This concerns
/only/ the unistd-library and those (few) other library functions
I have
written: most of the rest of the library has it's own copyrights
(or is
public domain).  See the library sources for details of those. 


          INSTALLATION

Installation of Linux is covered in two documents;

INSTALL-0.11
and
LINUX.FAQ
INSTALL-0.11 is the installation documentation that accompanied
version
0.11 of Linux and dealt with installing Linux onto a hard disk,
among
other things. LINUX.FAQ is the linux 'Frequently-Asked-Questions'
documentation file. Grab a copy of these for future reference. Most
of
the material will be beyond your understanding for a little while,
but
once you have installed your Linux copy for yourself you should
have
gained an understanding through the process to understand much of
what
is included in these documentation files.

It is assumed that you have a working knowledge of how to grab a
document,
file, etc. from an archive site through Internet. You use 'ftp' to
call
up and log onto the system, 'binary' to set the mode of transfer,
and
'get filename' to transfer the file from the logged onto system ftp
site to your home directory of the machine you have called out
from.

It is also assumed that you have a basic working knowledge of DOS
and
can get around well enough. (Perhaps you know how to create batch
files
using your favorite editor, or 'copy con' command line statement,
and
how to use the basic DOS utilities; fdisk, copy, erase, etc...). I
am
only trying to create a documentation here for DOS users who are
totally
unknowlegable of Unix system calls, utilities, commands and lastly;
being a System Administrator (which you will be once you have Linux
up
and running on your 386/486 machine).

In a later chapter I will describe the commands and utilities, etc.
that
are available to you. I, too, am a 'beginner' unix system user, so
much
of the explanations found here have been 'donated' in time and
effort
by programmers/concerned users of Linux from the 'alt.os.linux'
newsfeed.
(I have listed their names at the end of this documentation.)

Anyway, back to installation of Linux on your machine. Basically,
you can
run Linux one of two ways; either from your floppy drives only, or
from
your hard disk/drive. If you just want to play around with Linux
and
get the 'look and feel' of using a Unix Operating System (as
opposed to
a DOS operating system) then you might want to choose to just run
it
from the floppy drive. Basically, the logic here would be that, you
don't want to screw up anything on your hard drive (which is loaded
with Windows, word processors, graphics programs, data-base
programs,
etc.), and you have either spent long and hard learning hours to
have
it set up that way, or you had someone else set it up for you and
you
wouldn't have a clue on how to re-set it up yourself. Running Linux
from your floppy disk drive will not screw up your hard drive,
basically.
There 'are' programs on the Linux disks that you will have access
to
that 'can' ruin your hard drive though. (typing 'mkfs /dev/hda' for
instance may render your hard drive unreadable by DOS, but then you
wouldn't know how to do that yet...). Or, you could run Linux from
booting from the floppy drive and thereafter having it run from the
hard disk drive. The differences between these two methods are that
Linux will run a lot (10 times?) slower if you choose to run it
solely
from the floppy disk drive, and you will be limited to the commands
and
utilities that you can run using the floppy drive only situation.
On the other hand, running from the hard disk drive will run Linux
much faster/quicker as well as give you space to have many more
programs
and utilities to run/use, but it also entails you having to learn
to
1) create a Linux partition on your hard disk drive, and 2)
learning
how to maintain this partition with a handfull of sub-directories.

You should eliminate the hd[0-9] stuff, it's irrelevant and confusing.

Some comments:

-	things should probably be lined up better (use tabs!) so it
	reads a little easier.

-	I'm not quite sure what the point is.  What you have now is
	primarily a dump of the /usr/man/whatis file.

	I think you should work on expanding the descriptions to a few
	lines apiece, and show the relation between DOS commands like
	copy, delete, etc and the Linux commands.

(Sorry if any of this sounds too bossy - I'm just trying to throw some
thoughts at you....)

(DOS) BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO LINUX v0.95a
--------------------------------------
Comments enclosed in double brackets: (( text )) 'are' the
inclusions
by Chuck Boyer and are the 'DOS-beginner's-guide-to-linux.'
 
 
          RELEASE NOTES FOR LINUX v0.95
          Linus Torvalds, March 7, 1992
 
 
          COPYRIGHT
 
 
Linux-0.95 is NOT public domain software, but is copyrighted by me.
 
 
 
The copyright conditions are the same as those imposed by the GNU
copyleft: 
get a copy of the GNU copyleft at any major ftp-site (if it carries
linux, 
it probably carries a lot of GNU software anyway, and they all
contain the 
copyright). 
 
 
The copyleft is pretty detailed, but it mostly just means that you
may
freely copy linux for your own use, and redistribute all/parts of
it, as
long as you make source available (not necessarily in the same
distribution, but you make it clear how people can get it for
nothing
more than copying costs).  Any changes you make that you distribute
will
also automatically fall under the GNU copyleft.
 
 
NOTE! The linux unistd library-functions (the low-level interface
to
linux: system calls etc) are excempt from the copyright - you may
use
them as you wish, and using those in your binary files won't mean
that
your files are automatically under the GNU copyleft.  This concerns
/only/ the unistd-library and those (few) other library functions
I have
written: most of the rest of the library has it's own copyrights
(or is
public domain).  See the library sources for details of those. 
 
 
 
          INSTALLATION
 
 
Installation of Linux is covered in two documents;
 
 
INSTALL-0.11
and
LINUX.FAQ
INSTALL-0.11 is the installation documentation that accompanied
version
0.11 of Linux and dealt with installing Linux onto a hard disk,
among
other things. LINUX.FAQ is the linux 'Frequently-Asked-Questions'
documentation file. Grab a copy of these for future reference. Most
of
the material will be beyond your understanding for a little while,
but
once you have installed your Linux copy for yourself you should
have
gained an understanding through the process to understand much of
what
is included in these documentation files.
 
 
It is assumed that you have a working knowledge of how to grab a
document,
file, etc. from an archive site through Internet. You use 'ftp' to
call
up and log onto the system, 'binary' to set the mode of transfer,
and
'get filename' to transfer the file from the logged onto system ftp
site to your home directory of the machine you have called out
from.
 
 
It is also assumed that you have a basic working knowledge of DOS
and
can get around well enough. (Perhaps you know how to create batch
files
using your favorite editor, or 'copy con' command line statement,
and
how to use the basic DOS utilities; fdisk, copy, erase, etc...). I
am
only trying to create a documentation here for DOS users who are
totally
unknowlegable of Unix system calls, utilities, commands and lastly;
being a System Administrator (which you will be once you have Linux
up
and running on your 386/486 machine).
 
 
In a later chapter I will describe the commands and utilities, etc.
that
are available to you. I, too, am a 'beginner' unix system user, so
much
of the explanations found here have been 'donated' in time and
effort
by programmers/concerned users of Linux from the 'alt.os.linux'
newsfeed.
(I have listed their names at the end of this documentation.)
 
 
Anyway, back to installation of Linux on your machine. Basically,
you can
run Linux one of two ways; either from your floppy drives only, or
from
your hard disk/drive. If you just want to play around with Linux
and
get the 'look and feel' of using a Unix Operating System (as
opposed to
a DOS operating system) then you might want to choose to just run
it
from the floppy drive. Basically, the logic here would be that, you
don't want to screw up anything on your hard drive (which is loaded
with Windows, word processors, graphics programs, data-base
programs,
etc.), and you have either spent long and hard learning hours to
have
it set up that way, or you had someone else set it up for you and
you
wouldn't have a clue on how to re-set it up yourself. Running Linux
from your floppy disk drive will not screw up your hard drive,
basically.
There 'are' programs on the Linux disks that you will have access
to
that 'can' ruin your hard drive though. (typing 'mkfs /dev/hda' for
instance may render your hard drive unreadable by DOS, but then you
wouldn't know how to do that yet...). Or, you could run Linux from
booting from the floppy drive and thereafter having it run from the
hard disk drive. The differences between these two methods are that
Linux will run a lot (10 times?) slower if you choose to run it
solely
from the floppy disk drive, and you will be limited to the commands
and
utilities that you can run using the floppy drive only situation.
On the other hand, running from the hard disk drive will run Linux
much faster/quicker as well as give you space to have many more
programs
and utilities to run/use, but it also entails you having to learn
to
1) create a Linux partition on your hard disk drive, and 2)
learning
how to maintain this partition with a handfull of sub-directories.

chuck
(boyer@sumax.seattleu.edu)
(these are the 1st draft of these instructions, there will
definately be more continuity and further instructions by the
second draft, about 2 weeks from today, eg.; 4/8/92).
===========================
For now, let's just take the basic 'usage of Linux' files. These files
are found in the directories; /bin and /usr/bin. /bin files are the
files that are 'vital to the restoration of the Operating System
in the event of a failure....', /usr/bin files are usually all
user files, files available to everyone. Linux can be set up on
one machine with many other machines connected to it. In this case
the System Administrator/Operator would be in charge of setting up
and maintaining everything. For our examples we will assume the
basic 'one-user' system. So, you are the System Administrator.
So, when we say 'files available for users' it would assume more
than one user. Most tinkers of Linux will not have any other users,
just themselves.
 
(I, 'boyer@sumax.seattleu.edu', am also just a 'beginner', so I don't
know yet the usage of all of the available utilities/files myself!!
So, I will begin just explaining the usage of the ones that 'I' do
know for now. Hopefully, some kind soul will update me on the usage
of the ones that I don't know, so that we can give these instructions
a more complete feeling.)
 
 
basename
bigram
bison <--- part of GNU
cat   <--- two definitions/uses; lists files to screen that already
           exist, and creates a file if used 'cat > filename'
 
examples: (we will use 'filename' in the command line usage instructions
to indicate a wildcard statement that the user (you) should supply in
this place the name of an acaual file that you wish to use).
 
cat filename(ENTER)
  would list the contents of named file to screen, continuously scrolling
  the data (in the case of a large file) across the screen. You can stop
  the scrolling with holding down the Control key (ctrl) and pressing
  the 's' alpha key. (notated as 'ctrl-s') and starting up the scrolling
  again with 'ctrl-q'.
 
cat > filename
 
  would be using 'cat' to edit a new file named 'filename' (whatever
  you choose to name it. After typing 'cat foo' (we will use 'foo'
  as our example of 'filename') you would be put on the next line of
  the screen and the machine would now be holding, waiting for you
  to type input. Type a few words, and hit 'ctrl-d' and you are exited
  out of 'cat' and put back at your prompt. The file 'foo' is now 
  created with the words that you typed;
  example;
 
  cat > foo
   This is foo.
  ctrl-d
 
  cat foo
   This is foo.
 :
The first line 'cat > foo' issues the command to begin a new file named
'foo' and 'This is foo.' is the line you type in on the next blank line.
'ctrl-d' is the command keystrokes you issue to end this cat'ing command.
And you have created a file named 'foo' which contains the text line;
'This is foo.'
It is strongly suggested that you will understand these instructions
instantly (or better at least) if you try out the examples instead of
just reading them.
 
A third example of using the cat command would be to append an existing
file to an already existing file;
 
cat filename1 >> filename2
 
This command usage of 'cat' would add the contents of 'filename1' to
the already existing 'filename2'.
So if you had 'readme.txt' text file and wanted to add it to the end of
'readme2.txt' you would type; 'cat readme.txt >> readme2.txt'.
Then use 'cat readme2.txt' to check and see if this indeed did happen.
(Watch out, if you don't add the second greater-than bracket symbol (>>)
then, in fact you will overwrite 'readme2.txt file with 'readme.txt'
file and you would no longer have what was in 'readme2.txt' file but
just two copies of 'readme.txt' file.
Try out your own one or two line examples of these commands before
trying them out on real files that are important to you. Also, a good
practice at first in starting out using these unix commands is to first
make a copy of your file. The command to copy a file is;
 
cp readme.txt readmetxt.bak
 
Use 'cat readmetxt.bak' to get a quick readout of the file to ensure that
you have successfully copied the file. Using 'cat' to read a file is
also an overlap usage of another file which is available to you for 
reading files which is called 'more.' You will read about 'more' later.
=============
 
chgrp <--- change group file read/write ownership flags
chmod <--- change file/directory read/write/execute flags
 
   Usage:
           chmod u+rwx readme.txt
 
will render the file 'readme.txt' (r)eadable, (w)riteable, and
e(x)ecutable to (u)ser. What this means is that when you first create
a file, usually let's assume that it has no 'access' permissions. That
means that you can do nothing with it at all, you can't read the file,
you can't write to the file (add or remove from it), or execute it
(if it is an executable file). So, you have to change the mode of the
file, therefore you have the utility 'chmod' which changes the mode
of files. This allows for different settings for different access
permissions, security, etc. The possibilities are (u)ser (that's you),
(g)roup, in a larger system that's the group that has been designated
as having permissions to the same files, and (a)ll, for 'all' users.
 
 
chown
cmp   <--- compare two files
code
comm
cp    <--- copy a file to; (user defined/supplied new filename,
                            directory)
 
cp is the command for copying a file from one filename or directory
location to another filename or directory location. (you can also
use the 'mv' command, to be discussed later). Ther is the 'copy'
command in DOS, this is somewhat the same command. You will find
that in the unix world (Linux is a Unix operating system) that some
of the same commands exist, but they are called by shorter names.
Therefore 'copy' in DOS is 'cp' in Linux/Unix world. Unix uses the
basic philosophy that 'smaller is better.' This is the logic behind
calling the copy command 'cp' in Unix.
 
usage: 
      cp readme.txt read.text
 
would create a duplicate of 'readme.txt' named 'read.text'. You can
copy a file in the current directory that you are in to another 
directory;
 
cp readme.txt /usr/docs/read.text
 
would copy the readme.txt in the current directory to the sub-directory
docs which is a sub directory under /usr directory and rename it
'read.text'.
 
csplit
cut   <--- cut a large file up into smaller pieces
date  <--- give the system date
dd
dhrystone
dir   <--- same as 'ls' command, give listing of files,
 
dir is here for DOS users I guess, as in most unix systems this file
is named 'ls' instead. (Perhaps 'ls' stands for 'list structure'?).
 
usage:
 
dir -l          gives a listing printed lengthwise up and down the
                screen, scrolling on if more than one page/screen worth
                of files are there to be listed.
 
dir -la         the 'a' option gives 'hidden' files listed.
 
dir -lFR        gives a listing of all directories and files that are
                existing beneath/below the current directory that you
                presently are in.
                I use this command with the output piped to a file
                in the root directory to give a listing in a file that
                I can then read (with 'cat' or 'more') which give me
                a listing of all files that exist in my system.
                ex:  'dir -lFR > files'
 
          gives me a listing of my entire files on my system in a text
          file names 'files' which I then read with 'more files'.

I'll probaly stay with Linux since it doesn't need a coprocessor like 386BSD
does.   Now I just have  to get Linux  to sit nicely on my harddisk.

I personally plan on sticking with linux and NOT going to the
free release of 386BSD.  Why?  Well, my machine now only
has 4 megs of RAM, which seems to be fine for linux, but I
suspect would crowd BSD.  I also currently only have 80 megs
of disk space, 40 of which I devote to linux and 40 to DOS.
(I would throw DOS out completely, but I have too much invested
in software for it to disregard it completely).  40 megs
should be sufficient, approaching comfortable, for linux.
If you tell 386BSD unix you only have 40 megs available for
it, it will just laugh at you.  Also, DOS and 386BSD cannot
co-exist on the same machine (yet).
Just wanted to get my $0.02 worth in.  Keep up the good work
Linus, I'll stay with you!

It boots on many machines.  It doesn't boot on a lot.  With Linux,
you still have the option of running DOS on only one hard disk, 
with BSD you do a mklabel etc, and that IS your hard disk.   DOS and
BSD will not coexist.  BSD has neither virtual consoles nor X, 
so you want something there's no way to hangup, and you need a 
spare dumb terminal.  No ptrace, no shared libraries, heavy resource
usage.  BSD 386 is where linux was last year in terms of stability.

BSD has name recognition, FFS, networking, and tape support.  It will 
take more to rectify the 386 BSD problems, and add Linux standards like 
shared libraries, virtual consoles, etc.  than it will to add the 
missing features to Linux.

I do however see a cross pollination of code between BSD and Linux, 
with people from both groups borrowing code from eachother.

Minix : Linux and BSD will definately hit Minix's non-educational
users.  As far as educational users, the operating systems professor
here at CU was practically salavating over BSD 386, and having a
"real operating system" that he can teach with.  

I plan on staying with Linux.  At this point, BSD 386 just has a 
long way to go.

At this point I'm staying with Linux because its more fun. It will soon

Users of PS/2 70/80 etc. with MICROCHANNEL are stuck with Minix, too, like it

I'd propably use Linux if only MCA were OK. I'm still working on 386Minix-

Newsgroups: alt.os.linux
Subject: Here I go again.  (*another* shell - rc!)
Date: 19 Mar 92 08:29:13 GMT
Organization: Harvey Mudd College, WIBSTR

Well, when I first started making noises about replacing bash on the
root floppy with ash, a few people made happy sounds about a shell
called 'rc' in my direction.  Now that the root floppy (0.95a) is out,
and I have a little more time on my hands (after that corrupted
rootimage fiasco - sorry again!), I decided to track down a copy of
'rc' and see what was so swell about it.

I'm really impressed with 'rc', especially with either the GNU
readline library (which adds a bit of weight, but makes it as nice to
use as bash at 1/3 the weight), or with the smaller GNU-readline like
library included with rc-1.3beta (not quite as nice as readline, but
saves a fair amount of baggage.)

I'm going to run 'rc' through the hoops for a while on my system, and
will upload binaries to tsx-11 by the end of the week, probably with a
readline and an editline version.  For those that can't wait - compile
it yourself, it was absolutely painless.  (It's available on
archone.tamu.edu in /pub/rc.)

As you might have guessed, I'm also debating whether or not 'rc' might
find it's way onto the root floppy.  It would be nice, since it is
about a billion times better for interactive use than 'ash', but it
also means stepping into that fuzzy area of breaking a rather solid
tradition.

For those that are curious, rc weighs in at about 70k with the
editline library, and closer to 100k with the GNU readline library.
This drops dramatically with shared libraries, too.  (Down to about
50k for the GNU readline version, if I remember right.)

Very few programs have impressed me as much as 'rc' has in the last
few hours, and I've barely even scratched the surface of it's
capabilities.  If the rest of Plan 9 is this nice, someone should beat
up AT&T and force them to release it to the general public....

Also, a quick update on finding a small editor for the root-disk:

	People have suggested 'joe', which I remember hearing about
	before, but where can I get the latest version?  Archie only
	turns up earlier versions (I know Linux-support is in the
	official version, because I remember seeing the announcement.)

	I took a look at 'ae', a small editor which has it's roots in
	that wonderful hard-to-read C code contest (yeah, must be
	rough), but it can't handle the arrow keys out of the box, and
	I don't really want to try and add them in.

	I've got the fptedit posted to alt.sources today, but I
	haven't had a chance to look at it or try and compile it.
	I've been playing with 'rc' too much.  :)

386BSD is at release 0.0; Linux is at 0.95, right?  And you're
surprised that there is a difference? Amazingly enough (8-)), Linux is
actually more mature than something else out there.

>Bugs that Linux doesn't have (anymore), and features already added.

Does Linux have networking and NFS yet?  386BSD already has that, and is a
great incentive to go with it, instead.  (I'm holding off, actually; I
suspect that they can cross-pollinate each other, and end up looking
a great deal alike.  When they can run each others binaries, it'll be
time to think about dumping one of them 8-).)

be paying $99 for Coherent instead of using BSD.

Yup.  Several PS/2 machines do, indeed, have ISA buses.  I believe they
are the model 30 and 70 lines, but I'm not sure.

Depends.  It shouldn't be impossible, but MCA is (IMO) a much more rigidly
structured system, where you can use things like _protocols_ across a
hardware bus... no more should beed to be said than that...

Actually, the PS/2 70's have MCA architecture (something I was delighted
with 3 years ago when I got it and have regretted ever since!  Especially
now with the proliferation of free UNIXes which only support AT-buses).
Just out of curiosity, what is your objection to the more rigid MCA bus
(here, alas, my ignorance shows).  Will that make porting more difficult?

Anyone want to buy an IBM PS/2 70 :)

Subject: Re: Linux v0.95a bootimage uploaded
Date: 19 Mar 92 20:22:52 GMT
Organization: Prime Computer R&D

Yes, the 0.95 bootimage has been uploaded!  I found it on tsx-11
last night.  So, I thought I would list a few comments after booting
it on my system.

My System configuration:
	386-DX 25MHz
	1.2MB and 1.4MB floppies
	70MB and 80MB MFM hard disk drives
	4MB ram memory
	256K S-EGA (Genoa clone)  (NEC 3D monitor)
	4 serial ports (COM1-COM4, IRQs 4,3,4,3)
	Bus Mouse (IRQ 7, oops, not supported yet B^)

1)  The rootimage on tsx-11 was identified as corrupt 5 minutes
    after I started downloading it!  Sigh.  So I created both
    a 0.95a BOOT floppy  for the 0.95 ROOT disk, and a 0.95a BOOT
    floppy for my hard disk file system (also 0.95 root disk).

2)  The boot loaded the 8x8 font after not recognizing my video card.
    OK, it's an EGA, so my screen is now 80x43.  LINUX thinks my
    screen is 80x50!  And it sets up the TERM variable of my login
    shells to con80x50.  It also tells my video controller that I
    must have 50 line per screen, because 17 lines disappear below
    line 43 before the display starts to scroll!  Can I give a simple
    test to the video people to discern VGA from EGA?  It was published
    in DDJ a while back when they started the Graphics column.
    It involves calling a VGA BIOS interrupt.  EGAs (and CGAs, etc)
    return the function number, while VGAs return a 0 error code.
    Very simple.

2a) I want to add my EGA extended text modes to the setup.c code.
    I guess if I am patching code for my own use, I can just add
    it at the fall through label where everything else failed.
    In order to do more (and send my new code back to Linus for
    inclusing into the real source), does anyone know how to detect
    a GENOA EGA BIOS?  I can find GENOA copyright notices in the EGA
    BIOS.  Are these notices in the same location in EVERY GENOA
    EGA card?  Does the SVGA book mention anything about EGA cards?

2b) OK, so I may be buying an "S3" based SVGA card soon (it was going
    to be Real Soon Now, but my 70MB disk had a head crash last night,
    bad timing, huh?).  Is there any "clues" for these new cards?
    S3 text modes should still be limited to 16 colors, regardless
    of the graphics modes capabilities (with Sierra RAMDACs).
    (It was going to be the Diamond Stealth Hi-Color w/1MB, in case
    anyone was interested.)

3)  So I reset the TERM value, and EXPORT it from BASH.  GnuEMACS
    still thinks I have 50 lines on my screen.  Is it ignoring the
    TERM environment variable?  Do I have to load a local TERMCAP
    environment variable?  The shell also still beleives I have 50
    lines of text.  Is this because my video card seems to beleive
    this as well?  Do I have to re-set a register on the video card?

4)  I cannot run KA9Q or KERMIT from a non-root user.  KERMIT says
    EPERMS when trying to open the serial port.  KA9Q gets in an
    infinite loop that neither ^Z nor ^C can abort!  How can I log
    the user out?  Do I need a ps command?  How can the user access
    the serial port?  Do I need to chmod /dev/ttys0?

4a) KA9Q does the same if you try and open a non-existent serial device.
    Even as ROOT.  Can't get out of it. 

Side Comment to new ROOT disk maintainer:  Make the serial ports
    ttys0, ttys1, ttys2, and ttys3.  All other devices are 0 based.
    ttysx should be too.  I also like the idea of the hard disks
    being numbered as hdXY where X is a disk number and Y a partition
    number (or letter for SUN compatibility).  The same should hold
    true for SCSI disks: sdXY.  Both hd and sd devices should use the
    SAME naming scheme for X and Y.  either both numbers, or 1 letter
    and one number.  If up to 16 partitions are to be allowed, then
    X should be a number, and Y a letter to keep the devices as 4
    character names.  (We won't be supporting more than 10 disk drives
    per controller, will we??)

5)  Since I'm going to be buying a new disk drive or disk drive/controller
    RSN, what are LINUX's restrictions with regard to ESDI, IDE, and SCSI.
    I'm looking at 4 possibilities, with budget approval:

    a)  Find an 80MB HH MFM drive to replace my 70MB FH drive that died.
	this will allow me to replace my DOS stuff with minimal changes,
	and give me 9-10 more MB for LINUX partitions.

    b)  Buy a 150MB ESDI drive from a friend, an ESDI controller, and
	try to run this along with my current 80MB MFM disk under both
	DOS and LINUX.  This will be about the same cost as a) after the
	new controller, and allows me a new 80MB of disk space.
        If I cannot run both drives together, I will still have 150MB
	total disk space.  DO I NEED TO WRITE AN ESDI DRIVER or is
	someone already working on one?  This answer might influence
	the brand of ESDI controller to buy.

    c)  Buy a SCSI drive and controller.  SCSI is the wave of UNIX,
	though SCSI support for LINUX seems limited.  I've been
	reccomended to buy either a WD or Adaptec controller if I
	want to run more than just hard disks from it (like cartridge
	tape, or CD-ROM).  Is there more SCSI support than just the
	Seagate ST-0x controllers?  If so, then for what?

    d)  Buy an IDE drive and bus interface.  Same question.  Can I
	use LINUX with IDE drives?  Are there IDE drives I cannot
	(yet) use LINUX with?

    In all b), c) and d), I'm assuming that I can run two different
    disk drive types on two different controllers as long as either
    the MFM or IDE controllers can be configured as the "secondary"
    disk controller.  I have a fried who claims its possible with
    an ESDI controller as his primary, and an IDE as his secondary;
    under DOS.  I assume this will work under LINUX also?  Or does
    LINUX not yet support any disk controllers at the secondary address?

    So basically, what is my best choice for LINUX from the four above?

If you'd waited about ten minutes more, the problem would have been
corrected... :)  In any case, the 0.95a root disk, not corrupted, is
available on tsx-11.mit.edu now.  I'm not sure if the one on

That's something I hadn't considered when I did the 8x8 font - oops.
If someone can send a simple way to tell whether a EGA or VGA card is
in use, it's a trivial change.  (For now, change the line that says
'return 80x50' to 'mov al, #0x502b', which will tell the kernel you're
using 80x43.  Make sure to create a con80x43 termcap entry!)

>2a) I want to add my EGA extended text modes to the setup.c code.

If the EGA extended modes are handled through int 10, it would be
simple to add the detection routine as if it were a SVGA card.  If it
involves selecting different fonts, scan lines, etc, it gets a bit
trickier.  (I might look at this eventually for different VGA modes,
but not yet....)

When you modify termcap to handle con80x43, you should be able to copy
con80x50 and just change any reference to '50' to a '43'.  There's
about four or five things you need to change.

Make sure the serial devices have read/write permissions set for
everyone.  (That'd mean chmod /dev/ttys*.)

Good point, and one I hadn't thought of.  I'll make the change for the
next root disk.  (Just in case everyone isn't confused enough already!)

The current naming scheme could handle 26 drives and 15 partitions per
drive.  Y can be hexidecimal, much as the pty numbers are. (16 if we
made them zero-based....)

I run Linux with two IDE drives (a Conner and a Seagate, with a
Seagate controller).  It works fine for me, but I'm not mixing drive
types.

tty0 is the curent screen, tty1 is the actual first console, hda1 is
the first partition on the first drive, ttys1 _should_be_ the first

Something to keep in mind if you are a non-hacker, or won't have enough
disk space to build the Xserver.  

The stock X386 driver supports Tseng and

I agree wholeheartedly with this. My feeling is that Linux should appear
as "standard as possible", with normal names for disks, serial
ports, etc.  On most Unix machines, disks are numbered in the form

/dev/{r,}{h,s}d followed by a disk number and then a partition number.

Normally, I've seen disks numbered numerically, partitions with letters,
and it's pretty safe to assume partition c is the whole disk, a root,
g usr, etc.

Technically, with SCSI it is possible.  There are SCSI controllers that
hang off of a SCSI bus, and make 7 SCSI drives appear as LUN 0-6 of
their ID.  You can have 7 of these on one SCSI bus - so that's 
49 drives!

Note that ESDI / MFM / RLL / IDE normally all appear to the system
as a WD1003 compatable conroller. This means that they occupy the same
address. You can set one up as a secondary. but right now Linux does
not support this.  Hard disk driver hack, anyone?

This will probably be the way to go, but Right Now (tm), the only 
fully supported adapter is the Seagate. However, Dave Gentzel 
is in the testing stages with his lowlevel Ultrastor driver, David Darknell
with the lowlevel CSC driver, Tommy Thorn is working on an adaptec, 
Michael Johnson on a DTC driver, other people on Future Domain and 
Always IN-2000. 

SCSI also coexists with MFM / RLL / IDE / ESDI with no problems.
As far as SCSI now, your choice are to wait, or if you have a good 
deal on a SCSI disk pick one up and use it with a Seagate ($20)
until you get a "real" SCSI host.

Since the Linux SCSI drivers do not go through BIOS, or any brain-dead
mapping schemes to get the disks to fit within the geometries
allowed by BIOS / DOS, and instead uses that native SCSI as a block
device, you will be able to unplug one host adapter, plug in a different
one, hook the same disk up to it, and use it without reformatting or 
anything.

With SCSI and unmodified sources (other than the SCSI patches), only 
SCSI will coexist with any of the others. Otherwise, you'll have to 
hack the HD driver to support a primary / secondary controller.

If you want to use your current disk too, I'd say SCSI - but you probably 
want to wait for something other than the Seagate (slow, but very cheap), 
or Ultrastor / CSC (fast, but not so cheap) drivers.  

If you don't care about your current disk, or don't mind hacking
in support for primary / secondary controllers, I'd say whatever
is cheapest.

I am very enthused about linux, and I am especially interested in 
the ability to use SCSI.  I have a Future Domain 1650 Controller.
Has anyone had any experience - or know of any available sources - 
to anything that talks to this controller.  I am hoping I can build upon 
the work done for the Seagate Controller - but FD gives you no docs
or sample code.  They will sell you thier dev kit for big $$$$'s though.

That's the whole point of my three-tiered SCSI driver package.  Adding 
support for new devices, such as SCSI tape or SCSI printers, and 
adding support for different SCSI hosts is trivial.  The midlevel
driver handles all of the timeouts for you, retring error conditions
and classifying them as "Fatal, Could retry, Ignore, and media error,
you should remap", etc.  The high level drivers handle their devices
(ie SCSI disk)  for ANY lowlevel driver, and share a lot of common code 
in the mid level driver.  

Also, the way it's set up, the drivers are 100% self configuring, so
that one distribution kernel can be used for all supported SCSI hosts,
as well as "normal" IDE / MFM / RLL / ESDI systems.

To implement the lowlevel driver, including comments and DEBUG code,
you're looking at  300-500 lines of code.  Conversely, the rest of 
the package is over 2000 lines of C and header files, plus Makefile and
clean diffs against .95.

Right now, Ken Corey - <kenc@sol.acs.unt.edu> is working on a Future Domain
low level driver, unfortunately last I heard he's on a floppy / SCSI only 
system and running gcc off of floppy disks (it is possible - 
I've made file system images available from headrest.colorado.edu with
a mostly compiled kernel, where all that remains is linking in the
SCSI code modified for your system.  This is .12, gcc-1.39).  

You might talk to him and see if he's found out anything. 

Also, if you brown-nose the right people, you might be able to get 
a free developer's package out of it. Explain the situation, how 
a group of netters led by Linus are developing a free 386 Unix,
how the generic SCSI drivers fit into the picture, supported and 
soon to be supported SCSI hardware, etc.  Most companies want their
hardware to be supported, many are very helpful to students, and
are willing to help out.

I have set up the "linux-scsi" anonymous FTP site and mailing list.

Here's what I use.  It's based on the termcap entry supplied with
Linux, but has removed a few things that don't work (at least in
0.12).  It is set up for a color screen, so it gives you a green Emacs

Don't want to blow too much bandwidth with this problem because I am probably

/INSTALL/install shell script from the .95a root floppy.
issueing the following command:

	mount /dev/hda3 /working {from rc file same as .12 and .95 rc file

results in :   mount: unable to open lock-file

what am I missing here?

As long as you've brought it up, what are your thoughts on the
'install' script?  Good, bad?

I suspect you have a file called '/etc/mtab~', probably from editing
your mtab file with emacs at one time :).  You need to delete this
file before you can mount another partition.  (This is new to the
mount in 0.95, I think, and is used in creating the new mtab file
safely.)

Speaking of mount, etc:  I'll try and combine the sources to all the
misc. Linux-specific utilities like mount/umount/fsck/fdisk, etc, and
upload them to tsx-11.mit.edu sometime soon.  If I get really
ambitious, I'll write a man page or two, also.

0.95a runs perfect. Some info :
- the install scripts didn't change my /etc/rc
  I had some commands that were moved to different directory after
  installation. I was expecting the 'install' command would put the new
  /etc/rc in there, but it didn't. I had to copy the new /etc/rc manually

- I tried 'setterm' to change the foreground color to 'green'. It works fine
  until I invoke my editor (vi or joe), the foreground is back to white.
  Any trick to make it stay green ?

I created a 'normal' userid and found several problems with it:
- I can not use kermit to access /dev/ttys1
  When I am root I can use kermit with no problem (I am typing this letter
  with kermit connected to my Univ machine).
  Any solution ?

- I can not compile program(s) with 'make' with this userid. It gives
  this error msg :

  (null): setuid: Not owner. Stop.

  Compiling by hand (ge:  gcc -o test test.c   works fine). I checked
  the 'make' program. It's not setuid.... hm....
  BTW, I forgot where I got the 'make' program, probably tsx-11.mit.edu.

  Anybody had this kind of problem ? or does everybody use 'root' all
  the time ? :-)

- I'd like to get gcc 2.0 up and running. Which file(s) should I get ?
  (I don't want to mess up my configuration now. Last time I downloaded
  gcc I got the wrong libraries... took me a while to figure it out)

- Where can I get the include files for "curses" the library that I got
  seems to be the lib only.

Please post responses since this may be usefull for others ...

Thanks

They aren't designed to change your /etc/rc.  What they should do,
however, is warn you that you may need to change some things.  I did
this because with the utilities on the root disk, there's no neat way
to modify the /etc/rc, and if you're like me, your /etc/rc has been
customized to a fair degree (to mount partitions, set up the hostname,
etc.)

You need to use setterm -foreground green -store.

Make sure that /dev/ttys1 gives read/write permissions to 'other'
users.  As root, do a: chmod a+rw /dev/ttys*.

This is a known problem with the make from tsx-11.mit.edu, and nobody
seems to have worried about it enough to compile the GNU Make or
anything like that.  You can use the pmake from tsx-11 as a stop-gap
measure, but it would be nice if someone would just go ahead and port
the GNU Make.

>  Anybody had this kind of problem ? or does everybody use 'root' all

I use root all the time, but I'm trying to get away from it.  I keep
running into all the file permissions that aren't set very nice,
though.  :)

You need 2misc.tar.Z and 2lib.tar.Z, and the header files from the
latest kernel release, I believe.  Send mail to hlu@eecs.wsu.edu for
the most definitive answer, and for information on how to obtain the
latest release of gcc 2.0 for Linux.  (It's still in alpha-testing, so
I don't want to post it to alt.os.linux.)

Could you (anybody) point to the exact file filname for the header files ?
(Actually I can search the tsx-11 directory, but this would save my time

Hello Linuxers,
	I have changed over to .95a from .12 and like the improvements but
a few changes have me confused. In ver.12 I set a prompt with:
                           PS1='[\u] \w>'
                           PS2='[\u] \w|'
                           export PS1 PS2
in rc in /etc and also in .profile which was in two dirs in ver .12. This does
not work in .95a and I can't find a .profile (naturally I wrote one and it had
no effect. What am I missing?

Also: has anyone had any problems with uemacs-linux in .95a? It worked fine in
..12 but refuses to save a file now.

And: I have never used the Gnu compiler (Linux is my first experience with 
unix) .....where are the docs located? I tried to find a site that had the
docs by themselves, to no avail...I can't ftp a 3meg file to my school account.

I'm crazy about Linux and can't wait to put it on my big scsi drive and use my

Setting the prompt in /etc/rc would have no effect, but that has
absolutely nothing to do with your problem.  :)

The problem is that the new /bin/sh on the 0.95a root floppy doesn't
have all the wonderful little goodies you can include in your prompt
like bash (the old /bin/sh) does.  There are ways to work around this,
but they're messy and you're better off using 'bash' as your
interactive shell, anyways.  How do you do this?

1) get out the ol' 0.12 root floppy.
2) mount it (most likely something like 'mount /dev/at0 /mnt')
3) cp /mnt/bin/sh /bin/bash
4) edit your /etc/passwd so the last field is /bin/bash instead of
   /bin/sh.

>Also: has anyone had any problems with uemacs-linux in .95a? It worked fine in

If you're logged in as non-root, make sure the directory you're saving
to has file permissions set up such that you're allowed to write to it.

>And: I have never used the Gnu compiler (Linux is my first experience with

There is a manual page with the gcc 2.0 compiler, but it wouldn't be
of much use if you have no experience with unixish c compilers.  The
best thing you could do, I think, is to poke around on your school's
machine for manual pages on 'cc'.  The semantics are essentially the
same.

It's not a bug, it's a feature. :-) The new login program sets XON/XOFF
flow controll in all the terminals. So ^S stops the screen from
scrolling, and ^Q restores scrolling. Work around: M-X save-file works
(type ESC X save-file ENTER). Fix, get stty from tsx-11 and disable
XON/XOFF, or recompile poe-IGL 1.2 to do the same.

Someone, I forget who, was asking for reports of peoples experiences of

I've successfully run Linux 0.12 on a Toshiba 2200SX, and on a Toshiba
4400SX.  The only problem was loosing the use of the 'resume' facility, which
saves what you were doing when you power the machine off, and restores it
when you power back on.  This seems to need a DOS file system in place, and I
had given the whole disk over to Linux.

   As the subject line says, I upgraded to 0.95a kernel but kept everything
else as it was with 0.12. Generally things are ok except for the following.
Whenever I mount or umount any partition mtab becomes empty. Somehow mtab is
always empty. This is quite annoying as I don't know what file systems are
mounted and where. Also df doesn't work (as mtab is empty). Can anyone help?

In this guide I will be giving descriptions of the files that
are executables for the most part. There are many files here,
perhaps over 30 listed here, and you can download more, 
perhaps over 110. Many of these executable files are for
intermediate or advanced usage, many are for particular
situations only. I will only be showing definitions of how
to use the few necessary files that you will need to do the
basic tasks in Linux/unix, ie; moving a file, deleting a file
or directory, listing a file's contents to screen, making
a file or directory.... etc. These definitions, examples of
usage will allow you to move around, do things. If you read
the newsgroup, and other newsgroups, you will see many 
examples of how to use the other utilities that you have 
access to in Linux. 
 
These are executables, called 'binaries' in the unix environment.
(In DOS they are files with the filename extensions of '.exe, or
'.com', or '.bat'. Dos only 'runs' these files with these 
extensions. In Linux/unix there does not need to be an extension
to the 'filename' of an executable file, just that in running the
file by calling its name in a 'command line' the shell will either
'run' it if it finds in the header of the file executable 
instructions, or it 'won't' run it if it does not find them. Also,
as you will learn in reading about 'chmod' commands, even if it is 
an executable type of file, it 'can't' run if the mode of the file 
attribute is set to non-execute... say 'read' or 'write' only, but 
not set to 'execute' permission 'on.' This is only 'theory' if you
are 'Root' ((system administrator, which you are in booting up 
Linux)), because 'root' has permission to everything. It only 
applies if you are logged on as a 'second' user other than root.)
 
(Filenames with a * are in /bin directory on the 0.95a rootimage,
with a ** are in /usr/bin directory on the 0.95a rootimage. So,
these are immediately executable from the initial booting from the
rootimage and bootimage files at bootup. The rest of these binary/
executable files are available by downloading the '        '
file.)
 
  basename
        strips path off of filename
  bigram
  bison
        part of GNU
        parser generator (yacc replacement). A 'beginner' user 
        won't usually have dealings with this.
 
* cat
        two definitions/uses; 1) lists files to screen that already
        exist, and 2) creates a file. In our examples we will use
        the example of 'text.doc' to designate our filename, when 
        talking about what to do with a command line instruction. 
        In the case of 'cat', for the 1st usage example, as a way
        of writing a text file's contents to screen ('stdout' is
        the proper name of 'writing to screen', by the way) then
        we would type; 
                cat text.doc(ENTER)
        
        and we would get a displaying of the contents of 'text.doc'
        to the screen (stdout). If it is a short text file, say,
        shorter than 25 lines of text, then it just gets written
        to the screen and you are returned to your prompt. But if
        the text file is larger than 25 lines then it will just
        continue on scrolling on the screen until it gets to the
        end of the document, then return you to your prompt. The
        way to scroll it to the screen and stop it it to use the
        key sequence; 'ctrl-s' (hold down the 'ctrl' key and tap
        the 's' key. This stops it. 'ctrl-q' begins the text
        scrolling again. Do this over and over again until it 
        reaches the end. This method is okay, but someone wrote
        a utility for automatically stopping the screen text
        scrolling one page full at a time, and this executable
        program file is named 'more.' 'more' is included in the
        Linux distribution. So, use 'more text.doc' as a better
        method of reading a file. (Someone came up with another
        text browser program called 'less' and this works fine
        also.)
 
        The other usage of 'cat' is as a quick text file editor,
        creator.
 
                'cat > text.doc'
 
        would put you at the first blank line of the file you
        were about to create called 'text.doc'. Anything you
        typed after that would become the text of 'text.doc' 
        file. Use 'ctrl-d' to return to your prompt, and you
        have created a documentation file of text called
        'text.doc'.
 
        Actually, a third usage of the file 'cat' utility would
        be to 'concatenate' (this is where 'cat' comes from)
        two (or more) files together. 'Concatenate' means to
        attach two things to each other. It's kind of like hooking
        up a train car up to another one, both cars become the
        train.
 
                'cat text1.doc text2.doc > text3.doc'
 
        would copy the contents of 'text1.doc' followed by
        the contents of 'text2.doc' into a new file called
        'text3.doc'.
 
        You must actually play around with these examples, 
        typing in your own example text, to really learn
        how to use these utilities. Otherwise it's just
        theory.
 
  chgrp
        change group file read/write ownership flags
**chmod 
        change file/directory read/write/execute flags
**chown
        CHange OWNer
  cmp
        compare two files
  code
  comm
        compare two sorted files line-by-line
* compress 
        reduce the actual size of a file.
        
        'compress text.doc'
 
        Try this, create a 'text.doc', and then compress it.
        If the file was small in the first place it probably
        will be larger after compress. I think that the compress
        program places a translation table in the file first,
        so that adds bytes to the file. If you used this example
        on a larger file, you would see the compress utility
        would actually produce a smaller file. This is what
        people use to reduce the size of a file before they
        send it through mail or news out to the alt.os.linux
        newsgroup, so that it doesn't take up so much space
        and time transfering it. Then when someone gets the
        file they must uncompress it to be able to use it.
 
        When you type;
        'compress text.doc'
 
        compress adds a '.Z' title to it. This designates it
        as a compressed file. So, in our example you would
        end up with;
        'text.doc.Z'
 
        you would then uncompress it;
 
        'uncompress text.doc.Z'
 
        and it would strip off the '.Z' filename designator and
        you would have 'text.doc' again.
 
 
* cp
        copy a file to; (user defined/supplied new filename,
        directory)
 
        'cp text.doc text1.doc'
 
        would duplicate the file 'text.doc' into a new file
        'text1.doc'. It can copy a file in the current directory
         to another directory as a different name;
 
        'cp text.doc /usr/docs/text.doc'
        -or-
        'cp text.doc /usr/docs'
 
 
csplit
        split a file into sections determined by context lines
 
  cut
        cut a large file up into smaller pieces
  date
        give the system date
  dd

  dir
        same as 'ls' command, give listing of files,
        only available on 0.11/0.12 Linux as they are
        alias'es set up in 'bash' shell initialization file.
 
  doshell
 
  du
        Disk Usage 
 
  egrep
        print lines matching a regular expression (extended grep)
 
  em 
        GNU micro-emacs type of editor
        (this isn't GNU.  Just MicroEMACS.)
 
  expand
        expand tabs to spaces 
* fdisk
        in Linux, report hard drive disk partition sizes, in DOS
        and Unix and Minix; and change the partition size, type.
 
        Using fdisk alone;
 
        fdisk(ENTER)
 
        Reports the available hard drive partitons and sizes.
        You would use this information it reports to mount
        that partition to a directory-mounting-point.
 
  file
        report what kind of file it is; executable, binary,
        text...etc.
  fiz
        fix zoo archives
  flex
        GNU lex, lexical anylyzer
fold
        wrap each input line to fit in a specified width
        wrap long lines
* fsck
        file system check, check the partition status
  getty
 
  grep
        search through a file for a specified pattern
 
        'grep word text.doc'
 
        Would search for the word 'word' in the document
        'text.doc'. If it finds it, it will print the line
        that the searched for word (word) onto the screen
        (stdout).
 
  group
        group membership, etc
 
  head
        list the top 5 or 10 lines of a file.
 
        'head text.doc'
 
  join
        join lines of two files on a common field
 
  less
        list contents of text file to screen (backward/forward
        scroll).
 
  lesskey
 
* ln
        link a file in one directory to be in the current
        directory, without actually having to copy it, or link to 
        another name (i.e. compress -> uncompress)
 
        'ln /usr/bin/compress uncompress'
 
        Would create in the current directory that you issued
        this command from a file named 'uncompress' which is
        actually just a file pointer to the file 'compress'
        which is in the /usr/bin directory. If you run the
        compiler to compile a program source file for example
        and in its' instructions it looks for 'cc' file and
        you have 'gcc' then you would just 'ln /usr/bin/gcc cc'
        and the file 'cc' would be created, but actually it's
        just 'gcc' with a new name.
 
* login
 
* ls
        list contents of current directory, or any specified
        directory.
 
        ls(ENTER)
 
        Gives you a directory listing which is vertical with
        tabs between filenames.
 
        'ls -l' gives a horizontal listing.
        
        'ls -lFR' gives a horizontal listing, recursive (which
                means it continues listing down from the
                directory that you are presently in).
 
        'ls > text.doc' 
 
        Would give a listing of the filenames in the current
        directory, but you wouldn't see it on the screen. What
        it does is put the results of this command into a
        file 'text.doc'. Then you could read the 'text.doc'
        with 'cat text.doc', or 'more text.doc' and you'd see
        the contents of the file 'text.doc'. This is useful
        for being at the 'root' (beginning) directory and
        doing;
 
        'ls -lFR > text.doc'
 
        and you would have screens full of a listing in text
        form of all of the directories and files in your system.
 
  make
        compile a source file system specified within the
        Makefile of the source.
  man
        list the contents of found/specified manual pages on
        specified subject.
 
  mattrib
 
  mcd
        mtools, from Linux you can change directory in a DOS 
        directory.
 
        These utilities (mcd, mcopy, mread, etc.) are in the
        'mtools' file for your downloading. They are to
        be uncompressed in a directory which will have room
        for all of them to be held in their uncompress form.
        So, if you are going to set aside a hard disk space
        for Linux you would get and use these tools to
        read a file that is in your DOS partition while you
        are in Linux. (read a file, write a file from DOS
        to Linux, from Linux to DOS, list a directories
        contents, etc.)
 
                
  mcopy
        mtools, from Linux copy a DOS file to Linux
        directory/file.
  mdel
        mtools, from Linux delete a file in a DOS filesystem.
 
 
  mdir
        mtools, from Linux list the contents of a DOS
        filesystem.
 
        'mdir c:'
 
        would list to the screen all of the files in the directory
        c: in the DOS system on drive c: of the hard drive while
        you are in Linux, issuing this command from Linux.
 
  mformat
        mtools, from Linux format a disk for DOS.
* mkdir
        make a directory
 
        'mkdir one'
 
        Would create a fresh, blank directory named 'one'.
 
  mkfifo
 
* mkfs
        make a file system. Format a partition or disk for
        Linux. (This doesn't really format a partition, it

        make node, make a special file (e.g. hard drive
        partition, printer port, etc.)
 
* mkswap
        make a swap space on a partition on the hard drive.

        'more text.doc'
 
        Would list the contents of the file 'text.doc' to
        the screen. (listing to screen in Linux/unix
        terminology is referred to as 'listing to stdout').
        (standard output is screen).

        'rmdir one'
 
        Would remove the directory 'one' if it is empty of all
        files, the shell will complain with an error message
        if the directory is not empty, in which case you would
        have to move into the directory ('cd one') and erase
        all files 'rm *' ('*' is a wildcard meaning 'everything')

Greetings,

 I've been using Linux since v0.11 on a 386sx with a 40 meg. IDE drive
partitioned for DR DOS, Coherent, and Linux.  I've since killed the Coherent
partition in favor of Linux, and have a root and /usr filesystem each approx.
20 meg.  I upgraded to version 0.95a last night, and am having no problems...
except when the system first boots.  After the prompt for screen size 
I am confronted with the following messages:

Unexpected HD interrupt
HD-Controller reset failed: 00
Unexpected HD interrupt
Bad Partition table on dev 0340
Partition Tables ok.

This is the first time I have had problems with error messages upon
booting.  These messages appear *very* quickly, and the system boots like
normal, but it is still disturbing to see something like this.  Previously
0.95 worked without a hitch.  The weekend before I had recompiled the
kernel with GCC 2.0 using the patch for the ps command, and had no
problems at all.  Anything significant change with the hard disk code
since 0.95?  I'm using the *good* boot image from tsx-11, and have not
tryed to recompile my own yet.  Any ideas would be appreciated.

Also on a totally different topic.  I noticed in a previous posting that
someone had ported the Plan 9 'rc' shell to Linux.  This is great!  I
don't care much for ash, but then again it is a good basic shell.  What
I was wondering was if anyone has looked into porting the PD ksh?  I've
looked through the source before (tryed to build on a Sys. V r3 machine),
and it does mention about compiling with POSIX systems.  If the PD ksh
can be ported it might make a nice shell for the distribution disk.

I haven't noticed anyone mention anything about 'cpio', but I've got this
working on my system (GNU cpio v1.15) if anyone is interested.  I've used
it the backup the kernel source directory to floppy, and copy back down
as needed.  It seems to work flawlessly with the options I use.  The only
thing that it doesn't seem to do is multple disks, it asks for the next
volume when the first is full, but then dies when you hit enter after 
giving it the next volume.  Oh, well.  Back to 'tar' for *full* backups.

Subject: 2nd hard drive with 0.95a
Date: 20 Mar 92 07:06:33 GMT
Organization: NASA Dryden, Edwards, Cal.


Has anybody else tested linux 0.95a with 2 hard drives.  I've got
2 ESDI drives, the first with all my DOS stuff and the second
for linux.  Version 0.12 worked without a hitch.  I never got around
to trying 0.95, but I just got 0.95a (the "good" copy) and it can't
read my second drive, which unfortunately is the one I use for it.

It complains during boot from floppy that it can't read the partition
table for device 0340.  (It right after says that the partition tables
are ok; I guess it was happy to be able to read the one from the first
drive).  fdisk shows the 2 partitions (/dev/hda3 and /dev/hda4) on the
first drive, followed by entries for /dev/hda5 /dev/hda6 /dev/hda9
and /dev/hda10, which I don't understand; the later 2 devices don't even
exist in /dev.  It then complains about not being able to read /dev/hda10.

By the way, I also notice that the minor device numbers for the 2nd hd
in the FAQ differ by 1 from the numbers in the nodes in /dev.  The
FAQ says that minor number 65 is the whole second disk, whereas I see
that /dev/hdb on the root disk has number 64, which makes more sense.
I assume the FAQ is wrong.  Could somebody perhaps have made a simillar
off-by-one error in the code?  Is there something else that has changed
to make 2nd hard drives not work?  Or is it just my system?  This did
all work fine under 0.12 (and I checked to make sure this excercise
hadn't messed up my disk; I can still boot 0.12 and use the 2nd hard
drive with no problem).

The FAQ is wrong, and as far as I know, the code in the 0.95a kernel
is good.  I've had no problems at all, and I'm using /dev/hdb4 as my
/usr partition, with the devices set up as on the root disk.

Subject: Problem with 0.95a and 2nd disk drive
Date: 20 Mar 92 08:09:22 GMT

When I tried to install 0.95a on my machine last night, I couldn't
access my 2nd disk drive (where I keep my root partition). After
rebooting with 0.95 and fiddling around with the 0.95/0.95.a 
kernel/blk_drv/hd.c, I found that the function check_partition()
resets the sector count for device 0x0340 (i.e. hd[64].nr_sects)
to zero!

When I removed the new extended partition check (commented out
lines 97-102 in the 0.95a hd.c) and recompiled, the problem went away.

Has anyone similar experiences?

There is a ps095.tar.Z file, it's a patch that you have to apply to
the kernel. As it was for 0.95, the automatic patch doesn't work
completly, you have to "finish ny hand" the patch of mm/swap.c

I've done it. It works, it is well documented, enjoy

(you have to do tar xvofz ps095.tar.Z in /usr/src/linux (or whatever
place the kernel sources are kept)

Hope this helps.

Well, I just installed .95a today. I had been using .95 with no 	
apparent problems. With .95a, all appears fine except my 2nd hard
drive has started making a continuous whining noise and the access
to it has slowed considerably. It sounds like it is in a constant	
seek mode. I put up with it for a while, but I eventually rebooted
with the .95 kernel and the drive is back to normal. Therefore, I
don't think it's my hardware.

I have:
386 33mhz
2 - 32 meg seagate drives
WD controller

Anyone else encountered this?? wierd....

The booting process on 0.95a is flawless from floppies.
I haven't yet changed the hex number to reflect root on /dev/hdb2.
(it is still set up for 0.12, and that floppy boot reads /dev/hdb2
okay, yet when I do that /dev/hdb3, /dev/hdb4 don't read, have bad
IO numbers, blank-o!).
Under 0.95a I can mount, read, etc. all /dev's on drive1 okay.
But I can't get mtools to work at all reading drive0. I even 
'mknod /dev/c b 3 1' (which is the correct, under 0.12, device for
reading my drive0 DOS hard drive). But in 0.95a it always reports
errors reading A:, and I can see it reading drive a: floppy.

I have some files on drive0 that I'd like to get to the drive1 Linux
partition, but can't get over to there with mtools anymore.
Any suggestions?
(they are filetar.Z files, I know that if I go back to DOS, back
to the comm program, back to the school unix/bsd, uncompress them,
download them as tar's, rawrite them to floppy a:, then get back
into Linux I can then copy them over with 'tar xvf /dev/at0').

As I understood, Terry's problem was that the kernel didn't try
to check for SVGA at all, but went ahead and booted instead.

Yeah, I have something called 'Expert VGA' with a Trident 8800CS
chip on it (I wonder if the 'expert' refers to the knowledge required
to make the card work ;-) ). The code above failed to recognize
my card, at least, so I had to do some tinkering. I've mailed the
patches to Linus, but I'll post'em anyway, just in case they didn't
make it into 0.95a.

Summary: Don't use them
Date: 19 Mar 92 16:40:23 GMT
Organization: University of Helsinki

WARNING! Linux 0.95a correctly identifies extended partitions, and seems
to set them up /partly/ right: but it also seems as if the actual new
partitions aren't correct.  I don't know the exact layout of the
partition information in the extended partitions, and I just assumed it
was identical to the normal partitions.  It seems I was wrong. 

If your fdisk reports partitions within the extended partition, DO NOT
USE THEM! They seem to get the correct size, but not the correct
starting sector.  Thus read/write to one of the extended partitions
(/dev/hdaX and /dev/hdbX , X >= 5) will access the incorrect sector, and
possibly corrupt data on one of the other partitions.

If someone could send me the data on the partition information within an
extended partition, I'd be grateful.

I just booted up 0.95a on my 386 - 4mByte - AMI BIOS, and the old 0.12
loaded on the HD.  I did the /INSTALL/install to upgrade (great idea!!).
But when it all finished, writing any new file the date/time somehow
does not write properly in the INode table.  'ls -l' gives a date/time
of "??? ??? ?? ?? ??:??" (or something close.) But the date/time on old
files does show correctly.  Is this a feature! ? ( bug ?? ) or do I have
to rebuild the entire thing.

Another possibly related problem, I have an old program that called
time() (?) to give me a pause, but it just seems to loop forever now, it
does not wait the way it did on 0.12.

What's up? What's the cure??

     There are a TON of 386 PS/2s with an ISA bus... like the model 40

Well, recompiling with the hd.c from 0.95 (not a) worked just fine--my drive
is no longer making ugly sounds.

I'm having some ps woes, though--the kernel patches went OK (swap.c I had to
do by hand, but no biggee), and the kernel recompiled fine, but when I try
to compile ps, I get all the .o files fine.  Then I

gcc -o ps ps.o psdata.o update_db

and it gags and dies with


ps.o: Undefined symbol __cytpe referenced from text segment
ps.o: Undefined symbol __ctype referenced from text segment
cmdline.o: Undefined symbol __ctype referenced from text segment

What's going wrong?

Hi, folks!

Well, Coherent finally failed me (small-model compiler won't do what I
need), so I thought, "This looks like a job for Linux!", and went out
and got a bunch of things off tsx-11 (boot, root, gcc (I think :),
emacs...).

0.95a boots like a dream on my 486-33 (4 meg, Trident svga), actually
asks me about SVGA modes and even WAITS FOR ME TO ANSWER! Gosh, I
thought, this is fantastic! I even got kermit working. Great work,
Linus and everyone involved!

I have only two problems (the first of which must be a FAQ, but I
couldn't find it in the FAQ :)

1) What do I need to do to get my hda4 partition mounted as / at boot
time?

2) Deals with gcc. I'm not completely sure what all I need to run gcc
1.40. I got newlibc.tar and newgcc.tar from tsx-11 and installed them,
but when I try to compile a little "#include <stdio.h> main()
{puts("Hi, world.");}", I get the following mystifying output:

	I'm amazed at the quality of help I've been getting here - better
support than any software company I've ever had to deal with.  Thanks,
really.  

But, I'm still having a few minor problems:



1) My "make" doesn't work.  It says "error executing binary:  cannot
execute binary file" or words to that effect.  The permissions are fine.
 I had this same problem with gcc until I moved it to /usr/local/bin
(and it works fine now), but make won't work *anywhere*.

2)  Is there any way to transfer files over to linux besides using
mtools or tar??  I'd like to rawrite my emacs.Z file onto a floppy and
the uncompress it, but it doesn't seem to work.

3) I have 0.95 running fairly well, but I'd like to upgrade to .95a. 
How can I update the kernel without destroying the partition?  (or won't
mkfs destroy it?)

4) I'd like to get Linux, DOS, and OS/2 v1.3 running on the same drive. 
Right now I have 3 primary partitions (80, 62, 60mb) with DOS on the
first and identical Linux partitions on the second (in case I destroy
one :-] ).  Is there any way to put OS/2 on the 2nd or 3rd partition? 
The installation program is fairly brain-dead.
It seems like I should move my DOS partition to my 2nd primary, and just
let OS/2 do it's thing on the 1st partition.  EXCEPT - it says in the
manual that if I install HPFS on a partition that I won't be able to
access any partitions after it!  yikes..
Anybody have a setup like this?  Should I just wait for 2.0??



Thanks in advance..

Subject: Something writes kernel memory where it shouldn't
Date: 20 Mar 92 20:12:46 GMT
Organization: University of Colorado at Boulder
Nntp-Posting-Host: hamlet.cs.colorado.edu

I picked up .95a kernel sources, threw in my SCSI drivers, and 
ocassionally programs would segfault.  At an address in the 0x0008 
segment.  This is kernel memory, in a SYS call.

I figured, hey, I screwed something up, flipped the configuration file
macros so SCSI wouldn't be built, and it worked fine.  So, I put SCSI
back in, but never initialized it, so everything in data, and BSS would
be nudged up to where it was being corrupted, but it couldn't be 
the SCSI.  Same problem.  I traced the problem back to the code
fragment 


83 78 08, at address 0008:00012269.  Same thing EVERY time, irregardless
of the program running.

The address is unimportant, but 
I used that to get an object file, decided that the sys_write
function was where it was segfaulting, disassembled the code by hand 
and came up with cmpl $0, 8($eax), searched for that in the 
assembler output, and translated back to 'C' to come up with this 
line, in the dereferencing of the file_operations structure.


assembler output
 
L48:
	cmpl $0,12(%ecx)
	je L49
	movl 12(%ecx),%eax
	cmpl $0,8(%eax)
	je L49


'C'

	if (file->f_op && file->f_op->write)
		return file->f_op->write(inode,file,buf,count);

	

Fails here at file->f_op->write dereference.  The SCSI code was just
big enough to move things just enough so that this got corrupted, instead of 
something else, more insidious.  

This could also explain a lot of other little quircks that 
go on  - I guess I'm just lucky enough to have gotten a segfault 
instead of some other more insidious error.


This brings up some important issues : 

Linux NEEDS a kernel debugger.  Being able to do stack 
backtraces, etc would REALLY help track down the problem.  Also,
the die() code in traps.c should be changed so that ALL registers
are dumped out, as these (eax was being used as an index in this
case), will help track down the problem.

At least until Linus is 100% stable, it should check for valid data
structures wherever possible.  Seeing if f_op was minix_operations,
and panicing there if it wasn't would have saved some trouble.

I can't read debug dumps fast enough - and they sometimes fly off
the screen.  A good thing that should be done would be to 
make printk() print to a user (perhaps syscall) selectable device -
like a printer.

Also, implementing a pause key that freezes the kernel would be nice 
for debugging too.  How about a sysreq invoked kernel debugger?  
The debug registers would make this really convienient.

   I thought the voting was over a long time ago but this group still
   hasn't appeared.

No, actually the voting just ended yesterday at 7:00 EST (0:00 UTC).  (I
suspect you were confusing the 1 month discussion period with the 1
month voting period.)  

I'm currently in San Deigo attending a conference, so is rather
inconvenient for me to make sure all of the votes are correct and to
eliminate duplicates, etc.  I plan to do that Tuesday or Wednesday,
after I return to Boston.  After the voting results are posted, there
must be a five day waiting period while people can verify the votes and
complainin about any voting anamolies.  After the waiting period, *then*
the newsgroup can be created.

Although I have not double checked all of the addresses of people who
have voted to eliminate duplicates, I have done a first pass over the
votes, and the unofficial results is roughly 850 yes votes and 5 no
votes.  So it is extremely likely that the comp.os.linux newsgroup
*will* be created.  Just please be patient while we work through the
formalities in the next week or two.

Linuxites,

	I am attempting to write a guide for programming on linux,
more a porting software, patching the kernel manual than actual

using make, what to link as to, etc. I have an extensive outline and shold be
able to get a draft done this weekend. (promises, promises :-)) 
	In an attempt to disprove, "Those who can do, those who can't write

fileutils-3.1, and have discovered that there seem to be some 
#defines missing from include/sys/*h, or atleast gnu expects to find 
some things there. BSIZE (blocksize ?) and NINDIR (something about 
blocks per Inode but I haven't quite figured it out.)
	If instead of just telling me BSIZE = 1024 or something similar,
which solves one problem, you told me somewhere where this info could be 
found I would'nt have to bother you again.
	Also some info on where gnu docs gan be obtained without

Gcc 2.0 is very different from 1.40. There are lots of new functions in libc.a.
You may want to write a guide for that, instead of 1.40. As a matter of factor,
a volunteer is needed. If you are interested, drop me a note at hlu@eecs.wsu.edu.

If you could afford a PS/2 you can certainly afford the money for a real 386
or 486. There are many 486's under $2000 now and they will blow the PS/2
away. You might even be able to sell your PS/2 to some gullible person for 
enough to buy a real machine :-)

PLEESE, let's not start holy wars, not here in alt.os.linux.  The fact is that
PS/2s with 32-bit MCA can transfer data across the bus at up to 40Mb per
second.  That completely obliterates the ISA bus, which usually clocks around
4Mb/sec if I remember right, and even beats the EISA bus (which I use) that
gets 33Mb/sec on a good day.

Fact is, for disk intensive 32-bit OS, this is likely to more than make up for
the extra power you can get out of a faster processor.

If you need raw horsepower, get a clone.  If you need the fast bus, get a
PS/2, or if you can stand the headaches, get EISA.

If you can't accept more than one architecture, get lost (lots of :->s).

Maybe not. If I get some free time, I may do a PS/2 port. I have already ported
another Unix to the PS/2, so it shouldn't be too big a deal.

In kermit you can use  C-\ (that's   ctrl  \  ) and after that hit  c
you get the "C-Kermit>" prompt. From there you can use  '?' to get help.
You can even quit from kermit and then fire it up again with no problem.
The only problem that I have with kermit is that it won't hangup the phone.
I had to power the modem off or give  +++ ATH0 command.

My guess would be that insufficient wait states are being
added to bus accesses at 33Mhz.  Since most PC's on the market divide
clock frequency to get the bus clock as this is cheaper than using a 
separate clock circuit for the bus, the problem would not manifest itself 
at 8Mhz when the bus is running at 1/4th the speed.

This could corrupt data coming
in off the hard disk, etc.  Most software deals with potentially
slow devices on the bus by putting a jmp instruction after any port
access - ie in MASM you would have something like

foo:
insb
jmp $+2		; flush pipeline
loop foo

as the jump will flush the pipeline and slow things down to a workable speed.

If your CMOS has an extended setup, where bus waitstates can be set,
you probably should increase them.  
 
Otherwise, search the linux source code for any in, out, or ins / outs 
assembler instructions where a jump like this is not being performed.
Under gas, you would do this like

outs
jmp 1f
1:
outs 
jmp 1f
1:

Hi:

   I remember reading that you could use the lp.12 patches to get lp support
on 0.95a. So I tried it today. But alas, something happened somewhere and the
kernel I got complaint a lot about General Protection errors (the thing
that used to be very common in 0.95) and said NO lp! :-(

So I rebooted (not a cold boot) with the old kernel but still I got the GPE's.
Only after switch-off-on sequence with the old kernel solved the problem.

Has any one succeeded in getting lp patch to work? If so, did you hand patch
all the files? Again, if so, can you post/e-mail the diff with fresh 0.95a.

Any help would be appreciated.

I've installed 0.95a and I'm very pleased. The install scripts are a
major improvement! Great work!

Now a question: I am running a mono-vga in 50 line mode and really
like it. I do have a problem with kermit not using all the lines and
not resetting the terminal to its original state. I've played with
setterm, but with no results. Is there any easy way to get kermit to
use all 50 lines?

Second, I know it is in the newgcc.faq, but I still can't seem to find
limits.h. Where is it? Thanks.

Thanks!  (Really, though, I wish someone would complain - the only bad
thing I've heard is that the install script doesn't handle the case
where /usr is a mounted partition.)

I assume you're having problems once connected someplace (such as your
school's computer), in which case the other end has to know you have
50 lines available.  If the other machine is a Unix box, that's easy:
use stty on that machine.  (stty rows 50).  I'll agree that 50-line
mode is simply wonderful.  Whenever I have to use 25-line mode (less
and less :), the gargantuan letters bug the heck out of me.

Also, for those keeping score:  I rebuilt the kernel with the Finnish
keyboard, *again*.  This makes every kernel since 0.11.  I swear, I
thought I changed it this time, but it changed itself back.  Gremlins,
that's what it is....

	All:

	I am having problems getting linux installed on my personal machine
	and was wondering if anyone can help me out.  I have been working
	with Linux on the machine at work for about a month now. but I can't
	seem to be able to get anyplace with installing it on my machine
	at home.

	Here's the setup.
		Machine:	BSR 386SX/16
		Memory:		4 MB
		Floppies:	Drive A:	1.2MB 5.25"
				Drive B:	1.44MB	3.5"
		Hard Drives:	Drive C:	Plus HardCard IIXL
				Drive D:	Seagate ST1106 (RLL)
		Controller:	Floppy:		On Motherboard
				Drive D:	Seagate ST-21/22

	Here's the problem:
	I can boot linux fine and run off of floppies (either one)
	when I run fdisk it just returns (NO ERROR, Nothing printed
	at all).  What I think is happening is that it is not even
	seeing either of the hard disks, I do NOT know why? I can
	understand it not knowing about the HardCard, but Does anyone
	know of any reason why it is not finding the RLL drive?
	I have heard of other people running off of RLL drives,
	is it just the particular card that I have? can someone
	offer some assistance and a possible soloution to this
	problem? 

	Thanks for any assistance that anyone can give me.

	Paul

	P.S. Before someone else suggests it, I have tried using the
		RLL drive as C: and the HardCard as D: and I end up with
		the same results.

   if /dev/mtab doesn't exist :- (this should be in /etc/rc anyhow ..)

    then try mount again, all should be sweetness & light ...



People having trouble with kermit should try (/dev/tty64 = com1
					      /dev/tty65 = com2 ...)

/bin/stty 9600 < /dev/tty64 > /dev/tty64

  in /etc/rc to set the com port's line speed.  set baud 9600 at the kermit 
prompt changes the speed kermit tries to talk to the device but (it seems) 
doesn't change the device's speed ...

BTW I cannot successfully get kermit to transmit on com1 at 19200 - Any clues 
would be greatfully received.  I've got ka9q running at 9600, with the following
in /etc/rc :-

/bin/stty 9600 -IXOFF -IXON < /dev/tty64 > /dev/tty64

   ... but 19200 would be so much better, if poss ....

Also, when using ka9q I keep getting an "extra" return/linefeed every time I hit
return.  I found the following clears up this problem, and doesn't seem to
mess up anything else :-

stty -ECHONL

	perhapse this could become the default ???

PS. I'm not a guru, so please don't be too cruel if I've got some/all of this

-Problem with login thru /dev/ttys1 and /dev/ttys2:
 I am having problem with <CR>. Hitting return key does not move the cursor
 down. For example if I do 'ls -l', the first output will overwrite the
 current cursor line and at the end of the command the cursor stays at the
 line where the command ended. Is this a known bug ?
 BTW, "who" works fine. I can see a list of people login in :-)
 "write" works too...

-I am looking at 'procmail' and thinking that it could be the mail transport
 agent (MTA) for local mail. With procmail I can create a dummy "sendmail"
 and indeed it delivers the mail to the right userid with the right ownership.
 I'll post a msg if I can get this up and running. I understand somebody
 else is working on 'deliver'. How is it going ?
 Is anybody working on 'sendmail' and 'smail' ? I'd like to know how it goes.

-I am also looking at 'elm' and 'mush' as mail user agent (MUA).
 Unfortunately the 'Configure' script for 'elm' breaks since I don't have
 'expr', 'awk', 'sed', 'echo'. I found 'gawk' and 'sed' in tsx-11.mit.edu 
 but no 'expr'. Anybody ?
 Compiling 'mush' is not as smooth as I expected. It breaks trying to find
 getlogin(), re_comp(), and re_exec().
 Where can I find these libraries  ? I can see re_comp() and re_exec()
 in <regex.h> though. Is there a switch I should use when compiling.


Setup: Linux 0.95a, newgcc (is this 1.40 ?)

Thanks,

expr should be a shell builtin.  It is a standard in the bourne shell.  You
may have to do a little script editing.

expr should not be a shell builtin, if you subscribe to the 'rc'
philosophy of keeping things out of the shell that are just as well
suited to stand-alone programs, which I believe expr is.

'expr' is part of the GNU shell utilities, which should be on the
tsx-11.mit.edu.

Also, you might want to take note that 'expr' is not available as a
builtin in either 'bash' or 'ash'.

	Just a question about the rawriting-tar-files-to-disk thing.  I
understand that tar knows how long the file is going to be, but doesn't
compress also?  Why can't you rawrite a compressed file to a floppy and
just read it in?  (I couldn't get uncompress to read from a device :-[ )

	Just asking to be annoying..  :-)

All right. Earlier I had posted about a noisy second hard drive. 
Well, I did what was suggested and rebuilt the kernel using the
old hd.c from .95 but I also found how to modify the hd.c from v.95a.
It is simple and it seems to work but do not ask me why.
Just change the line in hd.c that reads:

static int reset = 1;
to
static int reset = 0;

It is near the top of the file. Again, I am not sure exactly what I did
here but it works.

Thanks to all who responded with the same problem. Now I can sleep
knowing I have a complete .95a version. ;)

1. Below find a patch to ls.c of the 3.1 fsf file utilities
for a simple change to show file types in color: executables
in green, directories in cyan, links with blue background.
Flag '-f' disables the colors (but you might want to reverse
the sense of this).

2. Maybe it's time to consider gcc 2.0 with the shared library
to be a beta.  I've compiled the 95a kernel, 1.6 shell utilities,
3.1 file utilities, kermit 5A, ps, and it seems to work fine.

3. ... except kermit 5A doesn't echo CR correctly in command
mode.  Does anyone know what to do about that?

4. I can't access a 720kb 3.5" floppy in my 1.44mb drive.  Do
I need to change an entry in the floppy_type table in floppy.c?
If so, what specs should I use?

5. It would be nice to be able to format floppies.  There's a
note in the 95a source from Keith White that he has a patch
for that.  Is that available anywhere for ftping?  Or perhaps
he could post it.

I need a trivial help. I am used to hitting cntrl-<space> to set mark in
Gnu-emacs. But in Linux cntrl-<space> simply produces a space. I think
emacs expects "null" character for cntrl-<space>. Could a kind sole
tell me the correction in keyboard.S (I am hoping that it is one of the

BTW, I am also interested in the ability to format diskettes in Linux which

any day now and glibc.a 1.02 is just released. I want to use them
instead of 2.0 and 1.00. I will try to start testing for 2.1 and 1.02
as soon as possible. We will have almost all the non-networking stuffs
in glibc.a 1.02.

Since libc.a grows bigger and bigger, we need a list of functions we
have, At least, it should have name and proto type of each funcion.

I hope gcc 2.0 will replace 1.40 very soon.

H.J.

Make sure that /tmp and /usr/tmp have file permissions set so that
non-root users can write to them.  I'm 99% certain that's your
problem.

On a related note:  Has anyone given any thought to writing a 'adduser'
program for Linux?  Editing the passwd file by hand is a pain in the
rear.

This is a problem with the permissions on /tmp.  You should set permissions on
/tmp to 1777 - sticky, r/w/x all.  Tmp must be r/w all so anyone can make files
there, and should be sticky so users cannot delete files they don't own.

Did you set the permissions on the temp directory so that everyone can
read and write it?

Summary: What do people think of this idea?
Date: 21 Mar 92 18:27:17 GMT
Organization: University of Tennessee, Knoxville - CS Department
NNTP-Posting-Host: thud.cs.utk.edu


I am toying with the idea of providing a distribution service for Linux.
My motivation is to make enough money so that I can work full time on Linux,
hopefully improving and extending it in the process.

I would appreciate feedback from people who think this is a *Bad* idea as
well as those who think it is a *Good* idea.  Please see the QUESTIONS below.

Here is my thinking:

For a small fee I would provide the following:

	* A copy of the Linux Boot and Root disks with the Latest Release

	* A Disk with Patches which have been Posted to the Net

	* Optional Software disks, with Dependencies clearly marked

	* Printed Introduction and Installation Instructions

	* 2nd Day Air or Overnight shipping (Overnight costing extra) (US only)

	* A telephone support line which you can call for help with Linux

	* A BBS and/or FTP site where you can pick up Patches and New Releases

You would of course be free to copy and re-distribute any and all the material
provided if you so chose.

In the event that this distribution service was an overwhelming success,
excess profits would be turned back into Linux Research and Development,
buying new machines, hiring employees, supporting a connection to the
Internet, advertising to attract more potential Linux hackers, making the
BBS and Support Line Toll Free, etc.

				QUESTIONS

I would like to ask you the following questions, please send answers to
battle@cs.utk.edu:

1. Do you think this service would be useful?  

2. Can you think of anything additional which could be provided which would
make you more likely to be interested in such a service?

3. Is there some media other than 3.5" diskettes which would be preferable
or more universally acceptable?

4. What do you think would be a reasonable price for this service, considering
media, packaging, and shipment costs and the time required to prepare a
distribution?

5. Do you think people would be willing to pay this price?

6. Do you think I would have any time left to hack on Linux?  Do you think
I would make enough to support myself?  Will I get tired of doing this?

7. Do you have any other comments which you would like to make about this idea?


Thank you all for any feedback you can provide,

I've hashed this over once in e-mail already, but it was early in the
morning (before noon, even!), and I wasn't altogether clear, so I'll
have another go at it:

What's enough money?  Subsistence, comfortable, filthy rich?  Really,
that's a quite vague goal.  It's also interesting the number of people
that have been able to make very significant contributions to Linux on
their free time, with extremely little to (more likely) no monetary
reward.  I cannot see Linux being a full-time thing for anyone at this
point, really.

>I would appreciate feedback from people who think this is a *Bad* idea as

If you haven't guessed, I fall into the first camp.  :)

You're really only offering two things that haven't been done for you
already:  mailing disks, and telephone support.  The installation
instructions are at least partially written (see INSTALL-0.95a :), and
there are a number of people working on better installation
instructions and intro-type material.

Other people have already volunteered (although I don't know how
seriously) to distribute Linux on floppy.  If someone started trying
to sell Linux on disk for what I thought was an unreasonable price, I
would seriously consider offering to make the same sort of thing
available, for my cost only.  (Disks, packaging, shipping.)

As for phone support, well, I don't see the demand, really.

>You would of course be free to copy and re-distribute any and all the material
>provided if you so chose.

Of course, the GNU Copyleft requires it.  :)

You're dreaming!  Have you tried adding up the cost of all these
wonderful things your enterprise is going to buy?  All of the things
you mentioned would cost in the thousands, each.

>I would like to ask you the following questions, please send answers to
>battle@cs.utk.edu:

Well, I've posted them, since I think this issue concerns the Linux
community as a whole, really - you won't be the last with this idea. :)

>1. Do you think this service would be useful?  

Useful, sure.  Feasible, not a chance.  Like I said, the demand is
simply not there.  Most of what you're offering duplicates freely
available services.  Support is even freely available through mail and
this newsgroup.

>2. Can you think of anything additional which could be provided which would
>make you more likely to be interested in such a service?

Not really.

>3. Is there some media other than 3.5" diskettes which would be preferable
>or more universally acceptable?

You're going to have to support 5.25" HD and 3.5" HD, at least.  There
are many people without 3.5" disks, even on 386's, and many people
have their 5.25" HD drives set up as their boot disk.

>4. What do you think would be a reasonable price for this service, considering
>media, packaging, and shipment costs and the time required to prepare a
>distribution?

Disks, assuming a modest collection of utilities with the boot/root
floppies:	$5 (for 10)
Shipping:	$4 (US Postal Service, with box)
Additionals:	$2 (printed instructions, etc.  This is being *very*
		    generous.)
Time:		$2 (this obviously does not reflect 'start-up' time,
		    which would be minimal)

That's about $13, and I'm assuming you're not going to do anything
silly like buy a computer for this venture and work it into the
price.  I'm also assuming very little advertising, which may not be
fair.  Even then, it shouldn't increase the price beyond $15.)

>5. Do you think people would be willing to pay this price?

Sure, but I don't think that's the price you had in mind, since it's a
bare-minimum, no-profit cost.

>6. Do you think I would have any time left to hack on Linux?  Do you think
>I would make enough to support myself?  Will I get tired of doing this?

You would not make enough to support yourself, unless you can live
outdoors and feed off the land.  You will have plenty of time to
'hack' on Linux, because I can't see the distribution game being a
real happenin' business, and I think you will soon see it's futility.
(Then again, I'm not being real optimistic.  :)

>7. Do you have any other comments which you would like to make about this
>idea?

I think this is not a suitable direction for Linux' future.  Linux has
been written entirely by volunteers who have been working on their own
time, and I don't think that should change.  I also don't think it's
fair that someone take what has been written for free by people and
try and sell it to turn a buck (i.e. make a living doing so).  How
fair is that to those of us who contribute our time freely?  I know I
spent in excess of 20 hours last week getting the root floppy together
and distributed, and I know I'll be spending a fair amount of time
each week preparing for the next release.

>Thank you all for any feedback you can provide,

Well, it may not be the most encouraging feedback, but it's the best I
can give.  This sort of operation is not without precedent, however,
as I mentioned in mail.  Cygnus Support is reportedly doing quite well
by supporting GNU software - however, the market for GNU software is
quite large, and there's actually people to support.  I don't see that
sort of market for Linux in the near future.  (Speaking of near in
terms of years.)

I agree with Jim Winstead;  almost all of what you propose to provide is
*already* being provided for *free*.  Linux has, through the generousity
and hard work of Linus, and the hard work of many, many others, become
the *nix of those who wish to avoid commercial channels.   I think Jim's
suggestions for service prices are about right.  I don't think, however,
that $15 dollar distributions could sustain your service unless it was
not much more than (or just) a hobby.  I plan to do some ports as soon
as I am able to expand my diskspace and give gcc 2.0 a try (the libs for
1.40 are not quite complete, though very stable);  I will do this for the
joy of it and as my contribution to Linux.  If you do set up a distribtuion/
support service, I hope it's in the same spirit.

Hi, i have an unusual problem with floppies:

I have just migrated linux 0.12 from a 386/sx-16 to a 486-33
(i will add that it FLIES on a 486/33). Anyhow, both systems
have drive a as a 1.44 meg 3.5" floppy. Yet, the floppy doesn't
work properly on the 486 -- i get "reset floppy called" messages
flying by -- after tar has succesfully read most of the floppy.
However, this crashes my kernel, and i lose everythign i wanted to
transfer. If i write to the floppy the system reboots. Oddly, this
worked for a while perfectly, then (without any mods)

I am using:

/dev/PS0 where i have the major/minor numbers as follows: 2 28

---

an aside on gcc-2.0:

using dhrystone on a 486/33 i have obtained the following results:

(note there was a minor varience on multiple runs)

no optimization:	~12468 dhrystones/second
-O			~24300 dhrystones/second
-O2			~23850 dhrystones/second

Interestingly, gcc-1.40 produced about 17300 dhrystones/second (with -O).

I know that a benchmark is just that, and has little meanint elsewhere,
but it is odd that -O2 would execute *slower* than -O, since (according to
the manual) more optimization is performed.

Well, to tar files from my floppy drive, I followed the INSTALL-0.12 file, 
and did something like this:
mknod /dev/floppy0 b 2 28
for a 1.44MB floppy in drive A.. Maybe that'll help? I got the 'Reset floppy 
called' message before I did that..

Hi again, folks.

A couple of people sent me tips on gcc 1.40 (thanks all), and I'm now
pretty confident (famous last words) that I've got everything in the
right directories with the correct permissions, etc. However (very
large :-{ ), I'm still getting "Program got fatal signal xxx" errors,
even on entirely trivial programs (i.e. "main(){}"). This happens
right after "as -o <file>" in the output (cpp and cc1 seem to work
OK), and is accompanied by what appears to be a dump of process-state
information, but I'm out of my depth here and wouldn't want to be
quoted on that.

Things I've done right:

a) linked /usr/local/lib/cc1 and ../cpp to /usr/lib/cc1, /usr/lib/cpp
b) compiled using -fcombine-regs
c) all the executables are a+rx
d) all the xxx/tmp directories are a+rwx


No joy. Help me, please! 

Eternal gratitude,

Joseph

here is a utility that i wrote to add new users to a linux system.

It asks for the username (and checks if it is in user).
the group id, and user id (sorry, you still have to manage these),
the users root directory, shell, and default password.

this was a quick hack, i haven't seen any bugs, though.

From: hedrick@dartagnan.rutgers.edu (Charles Hedrick)
Newsgroups: alt.os.linux
Subject: cdiffs for 0.95a from Linus for alpha testing
Date: 22 Mar 92 00:15:22 GMT
Organization: Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, N.J.

The following cdiffs come from Linus.  He's had trouble getting
postings out.  They are alpha -- only for people who like to test
things.  They appear to fix some of the problems with multiple disks,
and some problems with serial lines.  I can't be sure about that.
They do fix my problem with gdb getting "bad things happen".
If the posting from Linus shows up, the diffs in that posting
should be identical to these.

Subject: diff for extended partitions
Date: 22 Mar 92 00:33:14 GMT
Organization: Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, N.J.
Cc: torvalds@cc.helsinki.fi

The following diff appears to fix extended partitions.  At least on my
system I get the right list of partitions, and making a file system on
one causes no visible damage.  Note that I've added code to print the
start and end of all the partitions at startup.  Until we get
confidence in this code I strongly recommend that you look carefully
at the partitions to make sure that the logical partitions don't
overlap each other or any real partitions.  Since the kernel defines
partitions only by start and size, as long as those numbers are
reasonable, the partitions should be safe to use.

Unlike the previous posting, this one is NOT from Linus, and is not
endorsed by him.  (In fact, he hasn't seen it yet.)

It turns out that Linus' guess for how extended partitions would be
done was not right.  He figured that the partition table in the
extended partition would be used just like the main partition table.
It appears that this is not the case.  The problem with that is that
it would only allow 4 logical partitions.  In fact what they do is
make a linked list of logical partitions, with each link in the list
being a partition table.  The tricky thing about it is that in those
link partition tables, the "start" fields are interpreted oddly.  The
first one should be offset by the location of the partition table.
The second one should be offset by the location of the main extended
partition.

I've tried this code on a machine with one disk and one extended
partitions.  (I've set up a number of logical partitions, including a
gap between two of them, just to make sure that I tested the code as
much a possible.)  Be suspicious of what might happen on a machine
with more than one disk or using DiskManager partitions (what ever
that is).

A PS to my extended partition code: This is based on 0.95a with the
diffs from Linus that I posted in a previous message.  So you should
apply those diffs first.  I think my code could be put in a stock
0.95a, but some minor changes would probably be necessary.

I know there's somebody keeping track of patches.  Do I need
to do something separate to get them to you, and have them go
onto tsx-11, etc., or do you pull all patches off the newsgroup?

Actually, I *have* ported GNU Make, but not because of the 'setuid'-
problem. :-) 
I have diffs for gmake-3.62/Linux-0.12. I'll try to upload the
diffs+executable after I have verified them for Linux-0.95a. [Maybe 
Friday, I still have some upgrading to do].

Gmake-3.62 seems to work ok, but there is one know problem: if gmake
forks another 'gmake' [such as when you are makeing a new kernel] and
press ctrl-C, the tty just hangs until you press ctrl-C again. I haven't
figured out yet why.

Also, pmake [Berkeley] makefiles can use things like 
'OBJS+=module1 module2' and use files in /usr/share/mk/*. The libcurses
stuff I have seems to do this. So sometimes you may need to rewrite
an occasional Makefile if you import foreign [BSD] programs.

PS: After I've uploaded gmake, I'm going to take a look at the BSD386
tape-driver and see if it's possible to port it to Linux. (I just happen
to have the right drive [Wangtek]!) Any pointers to info on tape formats and 
interfaces (lots of people have Colorado's, I think) are very much appreciated.
Also is the source for 'mt' in the public domain? Anybody got info on ioctl
calls for tape devices? I would prefer to keep things portable, if possible.

Here's an fdisk-like thing that uses the same method of handling
extended partitions as my kernel patches.  (However it's a bit more
limited: it only knows about one disk, /dev/hda, and can only handle
one extended partition on that disk.)  If you're nervous about firing
up kernel support, you can use this to check whether my code can
figure out your disks.  [By the way, all this stuff I'm posting

First, an aside...

Now that I have the UltraStor SCSI driver working, I had enough disk space to
try and rebuild GNU Emacs 18.57 and see if I could find out why creating a
shell buffer hung the process.  Surprise!  It works!  I have no idea why the
version on tsx-11 has this problem.  Only strange thing is that it only works
with ash, not bash, as its shell.  All bash processes get immediately
suspended because of "background input".  If I get time, I'll try to figure
out the problem with bash and upload a new version of emacs.

Now, the main message...

Here is an update of a patch I posted back on 25-Feb for version 0.12.  It
appeared in Digest V1N70.

----------

To make using Emacs easier for those of us used to DEC keyboards, here is a
patch to keyboard.S which maps control-space to control-@.  This is far easier
to type and almost second nature to many Emacs users with DEC keyboards.

Line numbers may vary depending on which other patches you & I have applied.
Patch is to version 0.95a.

0.95a has code that should have this effect already.  When the control
key is down, all characters are anded with 1f.  This maps space, @ and 2
into null, so you can hit ctrl-space, ctrl-2, or ctrl-@.

I finally got round to picking up 0.95a this afternoon and, after playing about
with my partitions I came to install properly. During a full floppy boot (508
and 509 == 0) my HD burst into life with an unhealthy sliding note (shoelace
does the same thing). The error message at the time is HD timeout. What is this
(other than an HD timeout), what is the likely cause, solution, prognosis etc.

Normally this wouldn't worry me but in the course of a a full HD reformat
tonight I discovered some HD damage (nothing major but worrying all the same).

Beginner's guide (2): I have been working on the HD partitioning, installation
and booting bits of the guide and wondered what pfdisk was supposed to do. I
thought it was supposed to partition but as far as i could see it all was
willing to do was write a small program to my partition table. Can anyone
enlighten me (examples good too)?

Thanks,

p.s. Sorry if this is little weird.... I'm very tired (long night trying to

Subject: Idea for elegant TCP/IP in user-mode
Date: 22 Mar 92 14:48:06 GMT
Organization: University of Tennessee, Knoxville - CS Department
NNTP-Posting-Host: thud.cs.utk.edu

I have an idea for an elegant implementation of TCP/IP (supporting Ethernet
as well as other interfaces) in user-mode on Linux.  See what you think.

The problem with most user-mode TCP/IP implementations (such as KA9Q) is that
they are monolithic in the sense that each application has a copy of the
TCP/IP stack linked in.  Thus, only one TCP/IP application can be run at a
time.  This results in kludges like the PC/IP telnet which includes code for
a terminal emulator and and FTP server!

However, this is a result of poor design rather than inherent limitations on
what can be done with a user-mode implementation.  Consider this:

A TCP/IP process could be created which would open all network devices and
manage routing packets between these and user processes.  User processes
would talk to the TCP/IP process through a connection to a named socket
(named tube in Linux?).

The advantages of this approach are:
	* We don't have to mangle the kernel trying to get it to do networking.
	  It can remain clean and simple.
	* It's easier to write code that runs in user-mode because you have
	  all the facilities provided by the kernel and user-mode libraries
	  at your disposal.
 	* Development work on user-mode TCP/IP could proceed completely
	  independently of kernel work on Linux.
	* The only thing needed in the kernel would be network device drivers
	  which would be responsible only for buffering packets as they were
	  received and writing outgoing packets to the device.  It's legal
	  to drop packets if you run out of buffer space.  This should
	  be easy.
	* A socket emulation library could easily be written that would
	  make it look to applications programs like TCP/IP was in the kernel.

I know this can work, because I have something very similar working on a Sun
for a class project.  I took the PC/IP code and ported it to a Sun, using
/dev/nit (the "network interface tap") as my "Ethernet card".  All that would
be needed would be to add some code to demultiplex packets to user processes.

Here's what we need:

	* A network device driver of some kind.  For example, a driver
	  for a serial line.  It wouldn't even have to speak slip.
	  It would need to be able to support multiple serial lines so we
	  can test the routing code in the user-mode TCP/IP.  It would be
	  fine if these were separate /dev files.  The only fancy
	  thing it would need to do would be to buffer incoming packets until
	  the user-mode process could read them.  Eventually we'll need
	  an Ethernet device driver.  There are PD packet drivers available
	  for every Ethernet card under the sun.  I don't know how portable
	  these would be to Linux, though.
	* A light-weight process library.  I think there are PD LWP libraries
	  that could probably be ported to Linux with little trouble.  This is
	  needed in the user-mode TCP/IP (I use Sun LWP in my Sun version of
	  this).  Porting something like this to Linux would probably uncover
	  all kinds of bugs, but it would be good for it in long run.
	* Something that works like named sockets, so that application
	  processes can open connections to the TCP/IP process.  I don't
	  know how close tubes are to providing this functionality.  This
	  is the same functionality that is needed for X, though, so I'm
	  sure someone is working on it.
	* An emulation library to make all this look like traditional
	  network sockets.
	* And, of course, the user-mode TCP/IP implementation.  This shouldn't
	  be too hard given all the other stuff, and given something like
	  PC/IP and/or KA9Q as a starting point.

With a little time spent on specification, progress could be made in
parallel on all 5 of theses pieces.

Comments?  Does somebody else want to write the specification, or should
I have a go at it?

There is a version of KA9Q that is built this way already.  The reason
I didn't look at it when doing the KA9Q port is that we didn't have
any Unix-mode sockets or equivalent at the time.  I believe with
"tubes", that version could now be used.

Hey, How about this idea,

If you create the binary with a #! /usr/bin/uncompressexec \n
line as the first line, you may even not need ANY kernel modifications!
(uncompress to /tmp , exec file, remove file in /tmp, can be done in 
a shell script! (need dd, compress, and rm, you figure it out!)

That's an interesting idea, but there are a couple of things you
will want to watch out for.  You'll want to keep the temporary file
around as long as the program is running so that the VM system can
read pages back in from it if a code page gets dropped from RAM.
You'll also want to check and see if somebody else is using the
program and run from his uncompressed binary if he is so that you
can take advantage of shared text.  (Just think of a dozen people
running emacs without shared text!)

On some systems this could dramatically slow startup time, as well.
I would think that a sophisticated system would create the VM space
for the program but, rather than loading the whole thing into memory
right away, mark all the pages as swapped.  Then when the program
is run it will be loaded into memory though successive page faults
as it runs.  This ends up using more CPU time overall, but saves
on on disk accesses if all the facilities of a large program are
not used and also lets a large program start up quite quickly.

Uncompressing the program first, though, involves reading in the
entire program (albeit in compressed form) and then writing the
whole thing out to disk again before you even think about startup.
The uncompression, too, would be a drag on a system with a slow
CPU.

What files need to be online when you run a program linked with shared
libs ? I was wondering if you could link programs in /bin shared. And in that
case what else need to be in the / mount point ?
I have used gcc2 without any problems yet, compiling gnu-utils amongst others
but I have not tested the programs for correct output and with different flags.
So the only thing I know is that they pass the compiler and can be run. I have
used both static and shared libs.

/lib is where the shared libraries live, so it must be online before
you run any programs that survive on shared libraries.  /lib should
also be part of your / mount point (along with /bin, /dev, and /etc).

If you've used the inst2.0 script that comes with gcc 2.0, you'll need
to copy /usr/gcc2/shared/lib/lib92.03.15 (or whatever the date is) to
/lib, especially if /usr is a mounted partition (as I learned today).
Otherwise you end up with all sorts of errors when Linux can't resolve
the line that inst2.0 creates.

I've had great luck with gcc 2.0, with both static and shared libs.
With shared libs, everything compiles down really nice and small,
especially most of the minor utilities in /bin (hostname, chsh,
passwd, etc.)

I finally got gcc-1.40 working. Apparently /bin/as got corrupted in
transit; replacing it with the 'as' from gccbin.tar seems to have done
the trick. But this is a different version, if I understand correctly
--- am I going to encounter some obscure incompatibility? I'm going
to download newgcc.tar again, and see if I get the same behavior.

Another thing --- 'setterm -dump' doesn't seem to perform as

a screen.dump file containing 30 lines of ^C^D. Anyone else had this

Yeah, it's "elegant" and aside from most likely being slow as death,
it should work fine.

Networking goes in the kernel if you want it fast.

Are you sure tty0 is the current screen?  For my /dev, there isn't a

It has been brought to my attention that the SCSI work on my

If you are one, please mail me which NCR chip your controller uses

The current naming wouldn't be so bad if it were documented somewhere.(

I had a feeling he was right, but I wasn't sure, since I've never seen
a /dev/tty0 on any Linux systems.  Should this have major 4 and minor 0?

In a way, I guess that's true.  It makes sense either way, really
(with zero-based, or one-based), so I don't think I'll mess with it,
much as I'm tempted to do so.  (Really, /dev/hda refers to all
/dev/hda[0-x], if it were zero-based.  That corresponds to /dev/tty
referring to the current /dev/tty*.)

Well, I don't like how it makes the different floppy names so
radically different from each other.  /dev/fdDT keeps all the floppy
drives under one name.

I know I won't make everyone happy.  :)  Some people have already made

I like this idea of /dev/fdD for the 'default', but I have a little
question - would that be a default on a Linux-wide basis, or per
machine?  I would suspect on a per-machine basis....

>Virtual consoles:	ttyN  where N = number [1-8]

Yes, the correlation between /dev/tty1 and Alt-F1 is nice.

>Serial ports:		ttyX  where X = number [a-d]
>			Note: ttys[1-4] are sometimes used for PTY's

Does Linux support this many (presumably > 32) pty's?

Naming the serial ports /dev/tty[a-d] runs into problems if someone
has more than 9 virtual consoles (is that even possible?).

I still haven't a solution to the problem of serial devices I'm
entirely happy with.  /dev/ttys[0-3] could suffer from name
collisions, /dev/tty6[4567] is really non-informative, and groups it
with the virtual consoles, and /dev/com[1-4] is just icky.

Overall, I like the naming scheme you mentioned:  It's consistent, and
it makes sense.  That's what I'm going for by bringing up renaming the
serial devices and floppy devices...

Yes, my intent was on a per-machine basis.  The install or mkdev script

I'm not sure about the kernel, but there are enough minor device numbers
available for 64.

Probably possible, but not very likely.  I have trouble using up the 
standard 4.  8 is more than I would ever need.  I don't multitask as
well as Linux. :)

I've been around Unix systems for years, and I have yet to see any
really nice system of naming devices.  Fortunately in most cases it
really doesn't matter.  For disks, you put it in /dev/fstab and that's
the end of it.  Backups and fsck's are typically done (at least with
bsd software) using the file system names, e.g. you dump /usr rather
than /dev/sd0c.  Thus I think it's best just to leave things alone,
except when there's some really compelling argument, since names that
keep changing are worse than any choice of names.  I do agree that
it's probably worth changing the serial lines from /dev/tty64+ to
/dev/ttysN.  I like the idea of having a link from /dev/fd to the
floppy device I normally use, but that's something I can do for
myself.

Current practice has /dev/fd being a directory or pseudo-directory where
you can open /dev/fd/<number> to get a dup of a filedescriptor, with links
from
	/dev/fd/0	->	/dev/stdin
	/dev/fd/1	->	/dev/stdout
	/dev/fd/2	->	/dev/stderr

It would be nice if you *didn't* use /dev/fd for the floppy disc 
so that Linux might be able to follow this convention as and when someone
implements /dev/fd/* :-)  Can I suggest /dev/floppy or /dev/fpy instead ?

I do agree with the general principle though.  In fact, I do the same thing
myself :-)

It's appropriate, although theoretically one can have multiple host adapters,
etc to get over 7 drivers.

>SCSI tapes:		stD   where D = drive [0-?]
>Other tapes:		tpD   where D = drive [0-?]

Normally, magnetic tapes are /dev/mt*.  Also there will often be a 
second entry for each mt, nrmt*, which says don't rewind at end of file.

Finally, under "normal" unices all block devices have a second character
device entry for them, the raw device - as in

/dev/rst*
/dev/rwd*

   It's appropriate, although theoretically one can have multiple host adapters,
   etc to get over 7 drivers.

True, and multiple LUN's (at least 2) per controller should also be
supported. In fact, I often run SCSI-based systems with multiple
host adapters.

Extended partitions should also, IMHO, be defined with their own letter,
like they were just multiple filesystems in a single partition (as in
SCO Xenix and Unix). The system should of course support using only a
single extended partition with multiple file systems.

"Primary" partition support could very well be dropped as too dos'ian thing.
An operating system should not need to use more than one entry in the
"master" partition table.

So, we end up with at least:

SCSI disks:	[r]sdHCLPF	where	H = host adapter [0-1],
					C = controller [0-7],
					L = LUN [0-1],
					P = partition [0-4] and
					F = file system [0-7, for example]

Each disk controller would of course need an own major number, but this
should not be a problem. This is also what SCO Unix does.

It seems that gcc2 works great, dynamic or static libraries (and the shared
library versions of everything are sooo much smaller).  The included 
half-linked version of tr doesn't work, and uname(1) only returns the 
hostname and operating system name - but I would assume this is 
a result of configuration problems with those programs, not with
gcc2 or shared libraries.

I think it's clarification time.  There are two different BSDs for the 386.
One is commercial, one isn't.  The commercial one is named BSD386, bsd386,
or bsd/386, depending on who you ask.  The just-released free one is named
386bsd.

BSD386 is in beta test right now, and will feature support for lots of
different disk controllers and drives, will have X11R5 bundled, and so on.
Release 0.0 of 386bsd is in very early testing, and is unable to operate
in much more than single-user mode.  It is unlikely to ever be as polished
as BSD386, and will definitely never have telephone tech support!  :-)

BSD386, when released, will cost $1000 with source code.  386bsd will be
free.

The place for information on both products appears to be comp.unix.bsd.

      Waiting for 386bsd to be just a little bit more stable...  :-)

I have now been informed that the beta BSD386 is currently priced at
US$1000 with source, but its price will go up later.  If you really want
to know, contact BSDI or read comp.unix.bsd.  I'll go keep my mouth shut

Oh yeah.  Both are based on the NET/2 release of BSD4.3 from Berkeley.
(This was an incomplete source-only distribution that consisted of all
teh AT&T-free stuff that Berkeley had at the time, also where the Linux
port of TCP/IP will probably get it's sources).

Most of the work on i386 support for the NET/2 release was done by Bill
Jolitz (see Dr Dobbs Journal, last year+this year).  For various
reasons, Jolitz wasn't very happy with the company he helped to found to
sell BSD for 386's (BSDI, responsible for the $1000 BSD/386), Berekeley
for not distributing 386 binaries, so he set about getting a working
version up.  And it's called 386bsd.

Simple, huh?

Actually not so :-)  a number of shell functions, including
test, expr, echo, catf, line, . . . are available as builtins
in ash.  One may, however, choose to compile them out.  Including
them as builtins may lead to some funny behavior (expr is not

Be careful, there's two places ash can be gotten from - the BSD
sources, or the comp.sources.unix archives - the one on the root disk
comes from the former source, with some small changes taken from the
latter.

Scripts may run a bit faster with 'expr' as a builtin, but it
contributes to make the shell larger - not a good thing.  The shell
should be running programs, not replacing them.

This brings up something I've been meaning to ask.  Are you (or anyone
else) planning on keeping a set of "recommended" kernel patches, and 
possibly even fully patched set of sources.  I'm mostly thinking about
bug-fixes here but we might want to also include an alternate set of
"expirmental" patches (and source) with the caveat that they may or
may not be included (at Linus' discretion) in the next release.

What I'm hoping to avoid is the "patch anxiety" experienced by users
like me who get a bit antsy when their kernel reaches a certain level
of patches.  I remember when the patches to 0.12 started to overlap.
They appeared to work but I didn't feel very secure.

expr is part of the gnu shell utilities (shellutils-1.6).  I have it
running on my system; I'll email you a uuencoded binary.

I am looking for source for setterm; I still haven't found it.

Organization: Computer Consoles Inc., Rochester, NY

I'm wondering if anyone has, or knows a way I can obtain or create,
a VAX cross compiler (for a MicroVAX) that will run under Linux?
I both some variant of CC as well as an assembler-- (gcc and gas
would be great, but can they be built under Linux to compile for
a VAX?)  As far as libraries go, I can probably just build most
of them from the Linux sources, once I have the compiler/assembler,
or I can get them from a local site here, if the a.out format
is compatable with the BSD format.
Do I need a new version of ld, too, or is it generic enough to work
with any system that uses the same a.out?

Thanks.

Got 0.95a and uEMACS up and running, and as usual, I'm having a problem with

For now, setterm can be found in one of the virtual console patchkits
for Linux 0.12.  You'll need to take the color definitions that are
commented out and uncomment them, and delete the color definitions
that were being used instead.

As soon as I get around to it, I'll release the most current source
code for the Linux-specific utilities.  This includes setterm,
doshell, update, mount, umount, fdisk, and a bunch of other little
programs.  I've been working on this off and on since Linux 0.95a was
release, but I've been busy with other work the last couple of days.

This is a function of the shell.  BASH supports job control, ash

You have compiled the kernel with finnish keyboard. U.S. keyboard is the
default in the images (*sigh*), but the sources default to the finnish
one. Look at the beginning of kernel/chr_drv/keyboard.S for defines.

Now you know how we finns have always felt with your american pc-unixes

Check in keyboard.s - looks like you have not specified US keyboard;
early kernel sources have specified Finnish keyboard.

After ftp'ing a few megs, I installed Linux 0.95a this weekend on my
machine: Micronics board, 386-20, 2 MB RAM, HGC, 5.25 and 3.5 inch
drives and a WD 1006 with a Micropolis 70 MB MFM winchester drive.
(and lots of dust from over three years, but I doubt that counts:)

The rootimage was very helpful, I needed only a short while until the
machine booted the first time with root fs on winchester.  Everything
uncompressed fine and worked on first try.

When I copy *really* big files, like creating the swap file, I sometimes
get "HD timeout" messages.  Is this a warning or an error (read: can I
ignore it)?

After years with MINIX, I had to try out what might happen, if I start
two compilers parallel.  I got a trashing machine, as expected :)  But
something else happened as well:

   Warning, pid 1450 older sibling 10 has mismatched ys link
   Warning, pid 1450 younger sibling 10 has mismatched os link

What does that mean?  It happens from time to time, if the machine starts
thrashing.

When I try to compile the kernel, compiling fork.c will get aborted by
"Program got fatal signal 2615".  I tried to compile this, and a a few
more file without -O and finally got an Image file of 215552 bytes.  I
copied this file to /dev/at0 and rebooted the machine.  After printing
the usual information Loading .....  and number of ptys, I got a kernel
panic from swapper, trying to free unused page or similar (sorry, I'm
typing from memory).  I can give more information, if I didn't make a
wellknown mistake...  I used gcc 1.40 (newgcc) for compiling.

btw: Doesn't Linux create a core dump when a program produces a
segmentation fault?

There seems to be no putenv and no regex in the library, right?

Everything else seems to work fine, just now I am writing this article with
Origami, wnews and wmail only needed slightly changes (grrr, MINIX specific
code).  I am impressed of the speed of Linux, if I would have known that
earlier, I would have changed earlier, no matter how much bugs the older
versions had and I am really looking forward to the possibility of compiling
the kernel.

I currently have two curses libraries, BSD curses which came with Linux
and a PD curses package, which has its origin in PC curses and ncurses.

I think BSD curses is awful old and 7 bit characters are a pain.  On the
other side, it is standard.

The PD curses has a few minor bugs, but I used it under MINIX for example
to compile sokoban, rogue and a few other games.  The weak points are the
print/scan functions (no ANSI way to pass arguments) and such things.  Its
features are support of ACS characters like SYS V and 8 bit characters with
standout, underline, bold etc.

If there is no other curses library, I will work more on this PD curses,
because I really need a curses lib.  Any comments?

How about using the original ncurses? A package ported to unix from a PC port
of a unix package is not exactly the way to go. I'm sure ncurses is floating
on the net somewhere; if not let me know and I'll upload my copy.

Hi Linuxers,

I've got a problem with the keymapping when using kermit to connect from my 
Linux PC to our SUNs :

How can I remap a key ? I know it is something like set key .. .. when using
mskermit under MS-DOOF, but that doesn't work with Linux :-(

Is it possible ? How ?

	If and when x11 is ported to Linux .. what will this mean.
From my reading of the faq s in comp.windows.x the 2 major intefaces
Motif and OPEN LOOK appear to both be commercial products.
	(I may be wrong!)
	If they are then won't X be a bit useless without them?

	Second question (and here I really display my ignorance)
how much work is involved in porting X? I suppose the OS will have
to be a bit more stable than it is now before work can really begin.
	Could someone estimate a time frame ( always a dangerous

Not at all.  The MIT libaries and window managers are still available.
The Motif and OPENLOOK stuff looks sort of cute, but from a functional
point of view twm is quite reasonable.  Note that Sun has donated the
libraries need to do openlook applications, as well as the OPENLOOK
window manager to the consortium, so you can use OL if you want to.  I
think we'll survive without Motif.

Kernel support for networking doesn't have to be all-or-nothing. A
number of people (Clark, for one) have suggested putting just
multiplexing facilities in the kernel, and then doing the rest as a
library within the destination user process. For TCP/IP this would
mean putting all of IP and the connection control block lookup for TCP
into the kernel.

Some advantages are:

 - performance - you don't have to go kernel -> user process 1 -> user
   process 2

 - debugging is easier than full kernel implementation, although not
   as easy as full user process method.

 - "standard" TCP, RPC, etc. be supplied in shared library, but
   applications would be able to use custom tuned implementations as
   well. (see IEEE Network 1/92, article on RPC performance, for a
   good example of why you might want this)

Just a thought...

Some bizarre is going on with the HD timeouts, I think.  I get the
same problem running GCC (DJGPP) under DOS, which is also 32bit.
Every so often, I get a ``not ready error reading drive C:'' Of
course, that absurd.  I also get the same error when running some
programs compiled with GCC (DEMACS, e.g.).  BTW, my machine is a Dell
325D ('385 at 25MHz), with a Seagate (yuk) 110ish HD (IDE).

The bottom line is there's no reason the HD should timeout, or be not
ready.  I've spoken to Dell repeatedly about this matter.  The first
time they told me the software was as fault.  The second time they
told me there was a problem in their BIOS.  When they sent me the new
BIOS, the problem changed its manifestation, but was not repaired.
(Now whenever I get the error, the HD jumps to track 470 and stays
there.)  I spoke with tech support yesterday (but to my great surprise
got someone who didn't speak enough English to communicate.  What's
happening to Dell?)  He told me that one of their super-gurus said
it was either a problem on the motherboard or a problem with the HD.
They will replace the motherboard me.

Whatever the case, something screwy is going on.  I suspect problems
of a similar nature may be plaguing Linux.

I had a few HD timeout errors while running DJGPP too, but I don't have
a DELL, I have a VIP 386SX-16 with Phoenix BIOS, 40Mb IDE. I've read
some traffic on comp.os.msdos.desqview about Not Ready Errors (NRE's)
but have not been able to figure out the exact nature of the problem.

I actually got 386BSD up and running.  It is a *MESS*.  People have compared
it to linux a year ago.  Perhaps.  Perhaps even worse.  I recommend that
anyone interested in 386BSD test it (yeah, blow away your hard drive, see if
I care), then watch it fail, "extra interrupt", hang, core dump, etc etc.
I am sure that in time, it will develop into a "good thing", but right now..

				     NOT!

My thoughts:  Get the WD8003 code out of 386BSD, get TCP/IP working.  Linux
beats the pants off of 386BSD at this point.

Organization: "Lehrstuhl fuer Technische Informatik, Uni Tuebingen"



Hi Linuxers,

While playing around with the Linux0.95a images I found a few minor bugs.

 - At boot-time, when I am asked if I wish to select any VGA mode or
   just press any key to stay at 80x25, I noticed that some keys will
   keep the system from reading the root-image (i.e. the arrow-down key).
   BTW: In the upper right corner appeared EGAm instead of EGAc...

 - The backspace-problem appears even on a virtual console where backspace
   worked at first when I log out and try to log in again.

 - Has anybody tried to fill up the process table yet? O.K. this is what
   I tried: I started about 55 shells from the same virtual console :-)
   The last shell I started neither gave me a prompt nor printed any
   error message. Pressing ScrollLock showed that I had 58 processes.
   Switching to another virtual console where I also was logged in I still
   could start processes, but after a few seconds I got error messages
   like memory fault or out of memory or out of swap space (certainly,
   running from diskettes, I didn't have swapping enabled).
   Maybe I just ran out of memory but I think even then, this behaviour
   is, if not a bug, a little bit strange.
   BTW: We should get a /bin/kill in the root image :-}

 - One more bug: If I press ScrollLock and stay on the key for a few seconds,
   I get a few dumps from the process table, then the kernel hangs and
   prints:

     general protection: 0014
     EIP   : 0008:0000c166
     EFLAGS: 00010086
     fs: 0010
     base: 0076ffff, limit: 00000018
     Pid: 0, process nr: 0
     8e e0 ff 05 b0 a1 02 00 b0 20
     Kernel Panic: free_page_tables called with wrong alignment
     In swapper task - not syncing

   Looks like a real bug, doesn't it?

I was running Linux on a 386sx 20Mhz board with 32kB cache and 4 Mb RAM.

Linux is really great, thank you Linus and all the others!

Well, this is something I have been thinking before. Is there some
advantage to the program kill versus the shell command kill? I mean,
there is kill built in bash and quite a few other shells. Note that I
am asking because I don't know, not flaming or anything like that.
After all, maybe the shell distributed on the root image doesn't even
have kill. I've never tried that shell anyway.

Ok, this is a known bug: it happens with all keys that send 2 keycodes
(the num-pad ENTER, cursor keys etc) and has to do with the fact that
the keyboard controller never gets an accnowledgement for them both, so
it doesn't interrupt when the next keys are pressed - thus linux won't
read the enter (or any other key) when the bootimage has been put in.

I don't know any fast fix: I haven't looked into it. It's probably a
one-line fix, but it's mostly cosmetic..

> - The backspace-problem appears even on a virtual console where backspace

I think this is a problem with ash and the termios interface. ash
probably sets the back-space key to something else than \177. I dunno:
haven't used ash. Get bash, and this (and other problems) will go away
at the cost of some diskspace.

Ok, this is a real bug: the keyboard interrupts happen too fast for all
the information to be printed, and the kernel stack gets overcrowded:
reboot. The easy solution is not to do this, the more complete solution
is to put some kind of lock on the info-key. I'll look into it.

repartitioning to DOS and Linux, noting down EVERYTHING that happens,
reinstalling 2 filesystems, writing it all up, removing ambiguities and trying

Nested functions and other new extensions, more optimizations, more
helpful error messages, builtins for mem* etc. (not sure if these are
for the 386), better fp support, etc. etc.  Dunno about Linux specifically.

>..... is 2.0 stable (I remeber it being described as barely past alpha)

It's not stable and probably has more bugs than 1.40 which is a
production compiler.  Gcc 2.1 should be coming out RSN, though, with
probably some bugs fixed and some new ones implemented.

>..... anything else you think i should know about it?

It doesn't have linux as a choice in config.sub or configure.  Someone
who is using it for Linux should send the diffs to make ./configure
i386-linux work (or whatever it is) to rms ASAP - minix is a supported
OS in gcc2 and Linux shouldn't be any worse ;-)

Shared libraries.  Small programs shrink by a factor of 2-3 on 
average, larger programs by ~50K.  it also compiles C++, and replaces
both gcc1.xx and g++1.xx


>.... is 2.0 stable (I remeber it being described as barely past alpha)

Seems to be.  There are a few quirks in the include files, but those
can be dealt with.

| I actually got 386BSD up and running.  It is a *MESS*.  People have compared
	It seems to depend on your hardware... I've got a 486/40, AMI
Bios, and I haven't had any major problems getting 386BSD up and on
the net using SLIP. (I haven't seen any of the "extra interrupt"
problems on my system.) Sure it is a little shaky in places, but it
isn't a year behind linux -- it's hard to even compare them
meaningfully. (Linux has it's own style of shakiness... 0.12 would
wedge if I tried to doshell to a pty that wasn't configured at
startup, for example.) I know of someone successfully using the WD
ethernet code, too.
	The difference is that Linux was constructed whole from
scratch, recently, while BSD has been developed over years. Linux
started out with a 386 base, whereas BSD started out on VAXen and the
386 code was only recently written. There are a lot of OS'es out there
which started with earlier versions of the BSD code -- SunOS and
Ultrix, just to name about 50% of the workstation market :-) So parts
of BSD are "vintage" and parts are very new.

done under 386BSD than I can under Linux. (NFS is already there, SLIP
is already there, etc.) This is a statement, not a criticism -- Linux
is a "good thing", having it under GPL is a *really* good thing. It's
an interesting kernel to hack on. In time, people will port other
features to it. There is a place for both... and I expect to see a
large amount of "cross-pollination."

Hello Linuxers,

Since I'm fairly low on disk space, I've switched out Emacs in favor
of groff as my disk hog.  I have Jove 4.14.7 (from ftp.cs.toronto.edu)
working (i.e. i-shells & job-stopping), except that the screen
keeps getting messed up.

I'm using gcc 2.0 and linux 0.95a (the same thing happened with gcc 1.40)

I don't think its jove, since the same code compiles fine on the
school HPUX machine, and its probably not the console driver, since
I can use Linux to acces Jove on the school computer over the telephone
using the HPUX termcap entry for vt100, and the screen doesn't get
bungled.

Has anyone had similar problems?  Also has anyone ported Jove and
NOT had screen problems (especially with i-search)?

Additionally, has anyone ported CRISP?

I'm rather anxious to find a usable editor that fits
in < 1MB disk space :-)

Thanks much,

David.

Upgrade mount and umount to the 0.95(a) versions: the 0.12 version opens
/etc/mtab~ with O_CREAT | O_EXCL, but no O_WROLNY, so writing to the
file will fail (and mount doesn't check for it). The 0.12 kernel didn't
check for the open-mode when writing, so it worked for that, but 0.95a
does.

I had the same problem. My second drive wouldn't mount at all

Surprise! My second drive is a 65 Meg Seagate RLL and my controller
is Western Digital something or other. ;-)

If you want to run 0.95a, you can do this by compiling it with the
hard disk driver from version 0.95. It works fine. However, if anyone
has ideas about how to fix this little problem, I'd be delighted to
hear them.

I must have a faulty memory chip, or something, but every time I don't
have the documentation at hand I'll swear I have a WD controller, but
as it happens, my controller is a Data Technology 7287 Revision B.

Oh well. I did a little testing this morning and I managed to pinpoint
the bug (or perhaps the drive just got tired of whining). It appears
that the bug is in reset_controller(). The 0.95a hd driver forces a
controller reset at startup and this messes up the Seagate drive.

One way to get around this is to change the line:
   static int reset = 1;
back to:
   static int reset = 0;

However, if you ever run into serious enough a hd failure to cause a
controller reset, the drive will probably start screaming again.

You could also comment out the code in reset_controller(), but this
way you could still get stuck with a hd failure. Sigh.

Could one of you guys who really know this stuff take a wee look?
Linus? Drew? Please.

Hello

I've been using gcc-2.0 with no difficulty (other than a few
problems with the header files that can be easily worked around).

I keep hearing how shared libs make the executables so much smaller,
and I can see for myself that the files in the shared/bin directory
*are* small :-)

Unfortunately, I have no idea how to compile using shared libs
versus static libs.  How does one specify this at linking?

Gratefully,

David.

1.  You must have created the directory /usr/lib/shared, with an
	appropriate libc.a in it.

2.  The shared library itself must be in /lib

3.  No flags with gcc2 will link shared by default, -static will
	link statically.

If you take the program

main () {puts("Hello World!");}, it should come out to ~5K when linked shared.
That will let you know everything is set up correctly, and that the shared
libraries are being used.

It's quite simple, using no options you link your applications with
shared libs, using -static you link with normal libs. Beware not to
clean your objects, since gcc-2.0 is still a beta it is supposed to
change, at least shared libs are supposed to change, and your
executable maybe unable to find right objs in the new libs.

Shoelace and winiboot

kermit & pcomm

Linux eats the first 640K for kernel text (~200K), kernel
data and BSS, and buffercache.  Your mother board may eat up
384K because of a shoddy chipset.  That leaves 1M of memory.

Subtract from that :

init, a shell, update, posibly other daemons like crond.  
You might be down to 600K of real memory left now.


Looking at gcc1.39 , I get


rwxr-xr-x  0/0 472068 Sep 22 04:33 1991 gccbin/gcc-cc1

looking at gcc2, I get 

-rwxr-xr-x   1 drew     wheel      726020 Mar 16 17:40 cc1*


You won't have enough space to run gcc in your real memory, will have 
to page heavily (remember, the kernel and buffercache cannot be 
paged), and it will be slow as molasses in january.

Subject: Request for Sources for ABC Release of Linux .95a
Date: 23 Mar 92 17:24:05 GMT
Organization: Concert Network -- Internet Operations Group

Now that .95a is out, I am preparing the "ABC Release of Linux of .95a".  This
will be comprised of full source and binary for as many software packages as I
can find, including compilers, utilities, games, user applications, and
whatever else you are willing to send me!

Distribution of the "ABC Release of Linux .95a" will be completely free, and
will be available for anonymous FTP from banjo.concert.net, when it becomes
available.  I may also offer floppy-disk based distribution at a cost-recovery
price, but that has not yet been established.

I will *NOT* be distributing a root or boot diskette, as they are already
being done.  Source for the kernel *WILL* be included in the distribution.

Now, the request:

	Anyone having ported a package to Linux that you would like to
	see in the "ABC Release of Linux .95a", please upload the *SOURCE*
	to the directory /private/ABC.Release on banjo.concert.net.

	Please make the sources into a single tar file including a README,
	a Makefile, and instructions on building and installing the package.
	Please also note any dependancies on other packages.  The packages
	should follow the Linux File System Standard 1.0 for placement of
	supporting files.

	The sources will be put into the directory tree under /usr/src and
	will then become standard parts of the ABC Release of Linux .95a.

I will *ONLY* take packages that are uploaded to banjo, as I am not sure of
the lineage of many of the packages that are currently available in the 
archives.  If you have ported software, SEND IT TO ME!

I am asking for SOURCE since I will be distributing both sources and binaries,
and I would like to assure that it can be built under the current version of
Linux.  If you have ported a package that you would like to have distributed
in BINARY FORM ONLY, please let me know.

All sources will remain the "property" of the person that did the port, and
that person (NOT ME!) will be responsible for keeping me up-to-date on any
changes that are made to that package.  I will be acting only as a coordinator,
and will not modify sources at all.  If a package does not compile/install/run,
I will notify the person that did the port, and wait for a new version that
does work.

Patches may be made available at a later time to allow easy upgrades to the
"most current version" of the packages, but I expect in the short term to just
replace the old version with the new ones and make an announcement.

Simply use 'date' to reset your clock.  It's lost its time, and that causes
the weird question marks.  It happened with me some time ago, with another
linux version, and I only noticed it because 'make' got so upset.
It could be that linux has corrupted the CMOS, but a more likely problem is a
flat backup battery, due to wearing out or something.

Here are the diffs I made when I compiled gmake-3.62 (as far as I know
there are none of the common bugs ascociated with these diffs - eg
setuid problems, Ctrl-C not working etc.)

Unfortunately I compiled with gcc2 & shared libs so I can't really
upload the binary, although I could upload the .o file ready for
linking. Mail me if this would be useful.

tex3.14, latex2.09 and dvips5.47 for linux (beta test) are available for ftp in
pub/linux at archsci.arch.su.oz.au (129.78.66.1).

texbin.tar.Z - contains binaries for tex, latex and various utility programs
texlib.tar.Z - contains tfm, fmt, sty etc files
dvips.tar.Z  - contains binaries, support files and documentation for bibtex

The default directories for the various programs are as per the tar files which
should be untarred in the '/' directory. The normal unix environment variables
should enable these defaults to be extended or overridden if required.

There are no pk or fli files included as these should be available from local
tex ftp sites.

dvips has been built with the font library feature enabled (as this is how my
fonts are stored on messy-dos). The undocumented L option for configuration files
is available for telling dvips where to find fli files (see included config.ps for
example). This feature is in ADDITION to normal pk file access.

bibtex is having segmentation fault problems but should be available soon.

mf is also on the way.

In fact, DOS format does two or three separate things when used on a
diskette:

1.	It creates the actual tracks on it (if they don't already exist)
2.	It creates a DOS directory structure on the disk
3.	It may also transfer the operating system files on the disk, if
	asked

So, basically, you don't need the format command because of the DOS
directory structure, but to create the tracks for rawrite to write on.

In some operating systems the above things are separated to different
commands. For example, in SCO Unix (if I remember right), the format
command does only phase 1, and a separate command (mkfs) is used to
build the file system on the disk (phase 2)if required. This makes the
logical distinction much clearer, and I believe a linux-based format
will work that way, when (not 'if') created.

RAWWRITE writes to a disk that has already been lowlevel formatted. 
From the factory, most disks don't come in this state.  The DOS format
command does a lowlevel and a highlevel format on floppies.

Alternatively, you could use Linux .012 with floppy formatting patches,
or formatted them in any other machine that uses that disk format.

Hi there!

I found Linux some days ago when searching for 386BSD. Rather good stuff but
installation is quite difficult. My problem: 0.95a ist successfully installed
on hd but i'm not able to transfer any files i've downloaded on my DOS-
partition. After writing a file with rawrite i can't mount the disk on Linux.
The mount command says: mount: error 16.
Here is what i did:
	writing an image of an file (ie. kermit.z) with rawrite under dos5:
		rawrite
		 source: kermit.z
		 destination: a
	booting Linux:
		mount /dev/PS0 /mnt
		-> mount: error 16

Any suggestions what i did wrong?

   I've successfully run Linux 0.12 on a Toshiba 2200SX, and on a Toshiba

   restores it when you power back on.  This seems to need a DOS file

Are you sure about this?  I'd be surprised to hear that suspend/resume has
anything dependencies on a DOS file system.  I'd think it just needs a
Linux driver to handle the interrupts properly.

I have a Sampo 386SX notebook.  Linux runs fine on it as long as I disable
all the power-save features, such as screen blank, disk power-down, and
suspend/resume.  I think these could all be handled with proper drivers in
Linux.

However, I wonder if these features are handled in any "standard" way
across all models of notebooks.  I tend to doubt it.  I think the new 386SL
based notebooks may be more standard, since the power-save features are
built into the processor rather than "tacked-on" by the manufacturer.

If anybody knows details about how suspend/resume or other "power-save"
features work, I'd appreciate any details you can offer.  Maybe someday
I'll write the necessary drivers.  It'd sure be nice to extend my battery
life beyond 3 hours!

Summary: NOT!
Date: 23 Mar 92 21:15:30 GMT
Organization: University of Tennessee, Knoxville - CS Department
NNTP-Posting-Host: thud.cs.utk.edu


I have been overwhelmed with the *positive* responses through email to
my offer to provide distribution and support for Linux from those who would
like to have a solid distribution of Linux to play with.  One person (an
obviously-knowledgeable administrator of a largeish network of Unix
workstations) even suggested that this might be worth as much at US$150!!!
This is about 3 times the *maximum* amount I would consider charging!

Thanks to all who responded for your comments.

However, I was astounded at the near-hostile responses I received from
some of the people working on development of Linux (Linus has NOT commented).

I think that the way these developers feel is blasphemy to the GNU GPL.  The
GPL is clearly set up to allow anyone who wants to to provide distribution and
support services *and make a reasonable profit at it* while providing the
users with the assurance of the availability of source code and the right
to make copies.  I'm sure Stallman is happy to have Cygnus Support around to
take some of the hassle of distribution and support off his shoulders.  I'm
sure he's not at all upset that they aren't losing their shirts at it.  In
fact, I'll bet he would be tickled pink if they got filthy rich; it would
just go to show that his philosophy about freely distributable software is
economically viable.

Not so for the Linux developers I've heard from so far.  Unless I'm willing to
contribute my time for free (or at least absurdly cheap) they won't be happy
with me distributing and providing technical support for Linux, notwithstanding
my willingness to contribute back any improvements and/or extensions I make.

Given this, I don't think it is a good idea for me to try to provide this
service.  I would need cooperation (or at least tolerance) from other Linux
developers in order to provide this service effectively, and that doesn't seem
to be forthcoming.

My apologies to those who still have no way of easily and cheaply getting
a complete, timely, and solid distribution of Linux with all the sundry
source and utilities.

My pity on those misguided developers who seem to think that a vow of poverty
is needed from any potential development/distribution/support provider.  If
this attitude becomes prevalent among Linux developers, my prediction is
Linux will die.  It will quickly be replaced by something that people can
make a living developing/distributing/supporting; most likely BSD or GNU.

I would like to know how Linus feels about the distribution/support
situation.  I imagine his feelings would be much more positive.

I think it's a good idea to offer commercial support - though it would
be appropriate to forward some part of the price the client pays to
the author(s?) of the software.  I understand that the FSF recommends
something like this.

One social commentary - when you do this, don't brag and boast about
the tens of thousands of $$$$ you are getting and complain about how
bothersome it would be to implement any of the proposals to forward
some of the money to the community every week on alt.os.linux like
Eric S. Raymond is doing on alt.folklore.computers ;-) ;-)

I agree.

Oops, well I guess I haven't done anything for Linux so I guess I have
no business in meddling in the affairs.

Given the differences of opinion, I suppose someone would need to keep
track of the copyrights etc. - FSF policy seems to be the require
written paper disclaimers / assigments for the stuff they distribute
to keep clear of legal trouble.

Cygnus does not sell software.  Cygnus Support sells support for software
(and only supports software that's free).

If you wish to sell support for the code, you are more than welcome to.  If
you wish to charge for distribution, it should be a "reasonable" fee (of
course, what's "reasonable"?  I don't know.  Do you?  Does rms?).  The GPL
says, "you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee."
You, however, want to be in the business of distributing the code.  As long
as it's a reasonable rate, I don't think anybody can fault you for it.
(Witness all the [ok, both, that I know if 8-)] Freeware on CD cdroms that
are out there now.  At least one of the people doing it is making a tidy
profit on it; of course, he's also only charghing $20 or so for the cdrom.
If he were charging $500, I suspect he would have very few customers.)

You also seem to want to sell support for it.  That's also, fine.  But are
you *really* surprised when the people you tell this to, people who are
already contributing support and code for free, react negatively?

Cygnus does that:  it sells support.  It also generates a huge amount of
code on the software it supports, and does ports, adds features, etc.  I,
personally, think that's why the free software community approves of cygnus:
yes, it's making money at what it does, but it's also fulfilling all of the
goals of free software, and most of Cygnus' employees are involved for
"religious" (or "moral" or "ethical") reasons.

Is that what you want to do?  Did you want to support Linux because it's a
great system, and you wanted to help contribute to it, and help get other
people using it?  Or were you just in it to make a buck?

Note the followup.

Perhaps this is a question for the FAQ, but I was wondering how to detach
the floppy after having booted and re-mounted the hard drive with version
0.95a.  

After booting from a floppy, the root subdirectories are off of the floppy
(ie /bin /usr /dev /etc, etc.), and the hard drive root directories are 
subdirectories off of /mnt.  I would like to cut off the floppy drive and
have the directories on the hard drive as root directories, such that the
standard un*x utilities can be located in the standard places.


Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated (yes, I am converting
from DOS, but am eager to get going in Linux).

This should be in the FAQ, but :

You must change the root device, which is specified at offset 508 in the
kernel.  It is stored minor byte first, then major byte.  So, to use
partition one on the first hard disk as the root partition, 
you would change the bytes at offset 508 and 509 to 01 03 respectively.

This can be easily accomplished using any sector editor, or using dd 
under Linux.

Under BSD you can just mount the root partition on the harddisk over /.
Unfortunately this doesn't work on Linux, I just tried it.  You have to
edit the boot disk and tell it to get its initial root from the hard drive.
Instructions are included in the INSTALL directory on the root image for 0.95a.

I have a program called "fixboot" that will patch your boot diskette
with the correct numbers - no more math!  "fixboot /dev/hda3" or whatever
will patch your diskette.  It also has a "-q" option that tells you the major
and minor device numbers of the current root device, and "-r" will reset
them to "0" (ignores the hard disk).

I'll be posting the code tomorrow here -- it's on the other side of a
firewall on a system I can't get to at the moment.  It should work on any
linux implementation.

Your program will probably work, but it shouldn't.  I wrote a similar program
last night.  It will be fine for resetting the device numbers to 0 for
making Linux use the floopy drive for root, but if you just booted Linux
for the first time and you have your floppy drive mounted as root, you really
shouldn't take the root floppy out to put the boot image in.  But maybe you
have a solution to this problem that I didn't think of?

Hmmm, does a 'rm swap-file-name' works ?

You obviousually have to cut the call to swapon from your rc.

If you have a swap partition, well just make an fdisk on it.

Something posted in an earlier message suggested that Linux doesn't

to be fixed?

I belive most modern unices (BSD4, SCO UNIX, and I think the newest AT&T
versions) allow up to 256 or so characters.  It would seem to me that a
new unix clone (such as linux) should support this from ground floor
rather than having to upgrade later.

hi-
	i've noticed a small problem with agetty [i posted this to
linux-activists@fi, but haven't seen it; but our mail/net is jumbled now].

1) i have an esprit terminal connected off my serial line that i'd like to
   run at 19200 baud. when i set the correct line in inittab, the login
   program seems to be executing at the wrong speed, 9600 baud. when i switch
   the terminal to 9600 baud, i get the login, but after logging in the
   terminal goes back to 19200 baud. i'm forced to run everything at 9600 baud.
   is there another file to specify the login speed?

2) this same connection is also used to drive my modem at 2400 baud. to turn
   off the login on the terminal i comment out the line in inittab, then use
   kill -1 1. this works, but won't kill the current login process. if i
   enter in some dummy name, the process will go away after the failed login.

I just installed 0.95a on my machine last night.  The installation went
fairly smoothly, and I was impressed with the progress made since the
last release.  However, I did run into a few snags in the process.
I post them here in the hope that pointing them out will lead to them
being more quickly corrected.

* The installation instructions in /INSTALL on the rootimage disk for 0.95a
  refers to a file called pfdisk.man.  I was unable to locate this file.

* The instructions also refer to pboot.exe, which I was unable to locate on
  any of the FTP servers (it may be there, I just couldn't find it).

* pfdisk prints /dev/hd0 as an example.  This should probably be brought
  up to date with the /dev/hda style naming.

* Backspace consistently doesn't work when mounting root on floppy and
  consistently works when mounting root from hard drive.

* Typing ? to more results in a "Can't open help file" error message.
  I was impressed with the full featured "more" on the root disk, however.

* I see Andy Tannenbaum (ast) has an account.

* What's the "--------dummy line" thing at the end of /etc/passwd?
  Perhaps the answer is "so dummy's like you will ask"?

* 64meg partition size limit is very annoying

* Would be nice to have a reboot command so we don't have to sync sync sync.

* The gcc files in newgcc.tar were named cc1 and cpp, but gcc didn't work
  until I renamed them to gcc-cc1 and gcc-cpp.

* I tried to mount the rootimage floppy on /mnt after I got it booting from
  the hard disk (so that I could grab the INSTALL directory which doesn't
  got copied (rightly so)).  However, I got repeated "Reset floppy called"
  messages when I tried to read it.

* I saw an article on comp.unix.bsd telling how to mount a root partition
  from hard disk over / on a floopy disk.  I tried this on Linux, and it
  doesn't work.

On the whole, an excellent job, though.

Newsgroups: alt.os.linux
Subject: Top
Date: 24 Mar 92 13:58:17 GMT
Organization: Brunel University, Uxbridge, UK

I have uploaded top to tsx.  It is a bastardisation of ps.  Below is
the readme:

Top
===

Disclaimer:

It works on my system.
Linux 0.95a 33MHz 386 IDE hard drive 4MB ram
GCC 1.40 (the new one)

Prerequisites:

ps by Branko Lankester
termcap functions (tgetent, tgetstr, tgoto etc)

Description:

This is top, inspired by the real world top.  It is based on ps by Branko
Lankester (I used ps095.tar.Z).  It displays the 'top' system processes, 
either by cpu use or memory use.

There are 24 fields that can be displayed for each process.  These are copies 
of the fields that ps would display.  You can select which fields you want
displayed or not.  Top can save this (to ~/.toprc) and will use it the next
time you run top.

The interval for update can be changed from zero to nine seconds.

Top displays a line giving help for keys.  Longer descriptions:

q	quit
k	kill - send any process a signal
n	nice - nice the top process (the code would allow changes to other
	processes's nice value, but there is no system kill)
c	sort processes by cpu usage
m	sort processes by memory usage
0 to 9	change update delay (in seconds)
A to X	toggle display of field
ctrl-W	write update delay, which fields are displayed to .toprc
	top reads this file on startup	
	
Installing:

Unpack top to the same directory as ps.  To compile:
cc -O -DNO_UPDATE -o top top.c psdata.c topcmd.c -ltermcap

Bugs/Notes:

Setting update delay to zero slows the machine to a crawl.  It is really good 
for wathcing executables being demand paged in.

The code for calculating all the fields is lifted straight from ps.c.

The keyboard response is jerky.  I tried using select, but it didn't work.  
Instead, it does a keyboard read every second.

Comments and bug reports for ps to:   lankeste@fwi.uva.nl (Branko Lankester)

For top, you'll have to sort it out yourself.  I probably won't have access to
a linux system for the next six months, starting friday 27 march.  I will
still respond by email, but can't do anything about it.  Hopefully Branko
can incorporate it back into ps.

My email address is cs89rdb@brunel.ac.uk (Roger Binns).

I can second that!  I installed 0.95a this afternoon on a 386SX and the

I, too, tried the 386BSD route.  I couldn't get it to boot, and I couldn't
get ANY help from the comp.unix.bsd folks, so I just said "screw it" and
ftp'd 0.95a from tsx11.  I only scrogged my HD once :)

I WOULD like to see (1) a way to boot straight from the HD without the floppy
"in the loop", and (2) a kernel in the root directory :)

I'm now in the process of porting Taylor uucp 1.03 beta to 0.95a.

There was a /bin/passwd on the Linux 0.95 boot floppy.  I took it off
for the 0.95a boot floppy, for space reasons, but you'll eventually be
able to get the binary (and source) seperately, either as part of a
new release of poe's init/getty/login suite, or as the Linux 0.95a
system utilities.

You need to create a small shell script for clear.  Do this:

	cat > /usr/bin/clear
	#! /bin/sh -
	echo ^[[H^[[J
	^D
	chmod 0755 /usr/bin/clear

^[ means to press the escape key, and ^D means to press Ctrl-D.

There are already devices for the modem - check out /dev/ttys1 and
/dev/ttys2, which correspond to COM1 and COM2 under DOS.

On login, /bin/bash reads $HOME/.profile, much like standard 'csh'
reads .login and .cshrc.  Also, you're better off using shell
functions instead of aliases, but it's no big deal either way.

Well, it ends up executing another program, so it's a tad slower - not
a real big deal, though.

Actually, it'd be nice if someone would whip up a small termcap-using
clear command.  It shouldn't end up being more than 5k with shared
libs, which is not too unacceptable, and that way it supports all
terminal types.

Ok: I didn't comment before, as I hadn't much to say, and I'll just make
my standpoint clear here once and for all, as people seem to be
wondering. 

I feel that if David is serious and willing to take on anything like
what he suggested, it certainly can't hurt anyone.  If people are
willing to pay for David's services, it means they are wanted, and he
shouldn't be discouraged.  What he proposed is certainly allowed by the
copyright, and I think some of the reactions were a bit harsh. 

Naturally, I'd feel even happier if /I/ got all the money off this
enterprise, but on the other hand, I wouldn't want to bother with all
the distribution problems etc, so I have only myself to blame (*).  If
somebody wants to make the same services available as David, I'll be
happy, but I don't feel it's a good idea to try to undercut David just
because of a I-wrote-parts-of-it-why-should-David-get-the-money?
sentiment. 

I can't say I made any "sacrifice" in writing linux and making it freely
distributable: I enjoyed most of it (bug-reports aren't fun, and I
/hate/ hardware-dependent bugs, but they are interesting), and I got out
as much as I gave (if I hadn't made it public, I'd probably never had
implemented some features I now think are indispensable).  Also, most
persons sent me diffs well aware of the copyright: admittedly it changed
between versions 0.11 and 0.12, but I made it clear at the time, and
nobody minded it then. 

I hope David makes it clear to potential customers what linux is and
that it is available for free if you want to take the trouble to find it
and set it up - his service would be just that: a service.  If people
find it worth the money, then everything is fine.  The amount of money
he makes is irrelevant.

(*) I also didn't want to make linux "guilt-ware", so I have even tried
to avoid asking for voluntary donations.  Sometimes I'm too stupid for
my own good.

Darn, someone finally caught me on this!  It's not there, so if you
want a copy, either download the pfdisk.tar.Z which I believe can be
found on tsx-11.mit.edu in /pub/linux/sources/sbin, or right around

It may not be there.  I'll try and upload it to tsx-11.mit.edu - look
for an announcement in alt.os.linux.  (I think you're better off using
something like Norton's Disk Editor, though - pboot is a little
outdated, since it refers to the old /dev/hd* scheme, and is a little
harder to use than it needs to be.)

Good point - I just compiled pfdisk and let it loose, originally - I
didn't look at it much.  I'll see if I can't clean it up a bit (user-
interface wise) a bit before next release.

That's why it drives me nuts.  I think I may have tracked the bug
down, but I'm not sure.  So, it may or may not be fixed on the next
root-disk release.  :)  Your best bet is to replace 'ash' with bash,
which should be available from tsx-11.mit.edu.

The more help file isn't on the root floppy.  No space, really.  (And
I forgot, 'more' was a last minute addition.)

Yeah, that's been there for some time.  I should probably take that
out of /etc/passwd one of these days.  Doesn't hurt anyone, though.

Right!  No, seriously, login seems to have some problems reading the
last /etc/passwd entry, so I added those lines.  I don't know what
causes it.

You're right, it doesn't.  :)  You'd have to ask Linus about this one,
I'm afraid.  (This would be nice, though, although I'm sure it
wouldn't be the most fun to implement.)

Interesting... the 2200sx I tried it (.95a) on barfed... kernel panic,
couldn't mount root ... after a few reset-floppy's.

Yes... it uses part of the HD as a 'swap space'.  I believe it is actually
mrely having a small partition for swapping.  Most Linuxers would wipe it
out, I think...
I base this on the fact that if you run standard DOS 'fdisk' to delete all
the partitions, and recreate them, resume doesn't work.  However, if you
use the Toshiba DOS 'fdisk' everything goes o.k.

No. Toshiba and Zenith, for example, use -completely- different schemes to
implement this... I haven't seen the guts of enough SL machines to know
about _them_...

Hm.  Usually, they use a custom BIOS call.  (Back to the DOS emulator
question! :-)  The custom BIOS is "normally" (we -are- talking notebook,
here)  ..."normally"  where the extra code is held.

This *could* be written in the kernel, ya know.  linux supports a variety
of VGA display cards -- why not 386SX notebook computers?

It might be better to make that one a loadable device driver, though.  In
fact, why not make the VGA drivers loadable drivers?  Make a generic one
for bootup, and the real one gets loaded after the kernel starts up.

True, but a smart serial card would require a new, major device number
and driver so we might want to use different naming scheme for them.

The pfdisk package (uploaded to tsx-11 and nic.funet) already does what 
you want. 
Ad 1) There is a command to set the number of sectors, heads and cylinders.
      It is also possible to compile these numbers in the code (although
      this won't work for a distribution version for the root-disk).

I had the same problem. I just added "/usr/src/linux/lib/ctype.o"
to the list of object-files when I linked ps. (so I did something like:
gcc -o ps ps.o psdata.o update_db.o /usr/src/linux/lib/ctype.o.
This solved my problem with ps.

swap:

My swap-partition is on /dev/hdb2. When I make /dev/hdn2 a link to /dev/hdb2
the output is what you would expect. What's happening?

I have written a small DOS program called 'setroot.exe' that allows to set
the major/minor boot device in the root floppy. Because it is a DOS program,
it is an alternative to using NU. If there is demand for setroot, I can
post it. I always thought there must be such a tool already - if it isn't,
shouldn't it be included with a standard distribution? I think many
non-hacker users don't like poking around in their diskette's boot sectors.

   bug-fixes here but we might want to also include an alternate set of

   What I'm hoping to avoid is the "patch anxiety" experienced by users
   like me who get a bit antsy when their kernel reaches a certain level
   of patches.  I remember when the patches to 0.12 started to overlap.
   They appeared to work but I didn't feel very secure.

I just looked at PATCH.DOC.  That's nice for tracking all patches, but
I'm looking for something more definitive though.  Something along the 
lines of:  "these are the recommended patches to the latest kernel for 
everyone running Linux."  The patches would be checked (and edited if 
necessary) to ensure they could be applied to a clean kernel automatically.
They would then be given identifying names like patch-0.95a-1, -2, etc.

Ideally, Linus would be the one to maintain such patches, but I'm sure
he's bsuy enough as it is.  Having someone else do it would keep Linus
free to continue kernel development (as long as he wants to, that is).
If nobody else volunteers, I'll do it.  Perhaps the patches and fully
patched kernel could be included in the upcoming ABC release.  What do
you think Alan?

Is there there some magical directory for all the binaries of gcc?
Any alt-spam symbolic links to files needed?  Some assembly required? :)

As far as I can tell, Linux doesn't care what kind of partition you
use, except for extended partitions.  Extended partitions are a hack
to allow more than 4 partitions: they are a single large partition
that contains an arbitrary number of "logical partitions" embedded
inside.  Linux will try find all the logical partitions in the
extended partition and let you use them.  (With the right set of
patches, it will even succeed in this attempt.)  I recommend using
some partition types other than the normal DOS ones, just to avoid
confusing DOS, which in the newest releases only seems to want one
primary and one extended partition.  Minix looks like a good choice,
since the file system format is based on Minix.

   You need to create a small shell script for clear.  Do this:

	   echo ^[[H^[[J
	   ^D
	   chmod 0755 /usr/bin/clear
Actually, use setterm -clear, as this will work on your terminals too,
if you have them.  In the same spirit as this answer, you can make a
shell script like this:

cat > /usr/bin/clear
#! /bin/sh -
setterm -clear

chmod 0755 /usr/bin/clear

   Hmmm, does a 'rm swap-file-name' works ?

   You obviousually have to cut the call to swapon from your rc.

   If you have a swap partition, well just make an fdisk on it.

mkfs, of course -- fdisk won't help much :-)

#include <excuses.h>

First a few comments-

Alan B Clegg - subj: ABC release.
	I would like to suggest that in the packages containing binaries
you include a list of files with their checksums.  Many of us (me for 
example have to move the files though quite a few networks and to quote
Linux "bad things happen".

Jim Winstead - subj: install script.
	Great job, but could you pander to my laziness and have it ask me
if I want my BASH bashed.

To those installing gcc-1.40 this should be of help. 


	These are instructions for installing gcc-1.40 on Linux-0.95a.
Lunux-0.95a contains everything you need to install and run gcc 1.40
however an editor would certainly be helpful for testing.

You will need to get include-0.12.tar and newgcc.tar to your linux system.
It is probably easiest to uncompess them  and Rawrite them to floopies under
DOS. You should also read newgcc.FAQ.

Now cd to / and untar the include files (include-0.12.tar)
	For example if you have rawritten your uncompressed include-0.12
files to a 5 1/4 inch disk put your floppy in drive a: and type

tar -tvf /dev/at0 | more
   (This shows you what files are in the tar, as well as detecting some errors. 
     If Murphy's laws do not apply to you, you can skip it.)

tar -xvf /dev/at0
   (This should write a bunch of *.h files into /usr/include . If you are 
      paranoid go to /usr/include and look at some of them.)

Now cd to /usr and untar newgcc.tar.
	If you are working with rawritten floppies put in the floppy with
		newgcc.tar and

tar -tvf /dev/at0 | more (for people with healthy paranoia)
tar -xvf /dev/at0

	This will overwrite some of the include files from include-0.12,
don't panic, thats why you untarred the include files first.)

Now gcc looks for ccp and cc1 in /usr/local/lib while they are actually in
/usr/lib so you will need to create symbolic links with

ln -s /usr/lib/cc1 /usr/local/lib
ln -s /usr/lib/cpp /usr/local/lib


Now to test it create the file hello.c

#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
  printf("Hello Linux\n")
}


and compile it by

gcc -o hello hello.c

and run it

../hello

For folks using the dos-rawrite/linux-tar-x method I'd recommend leaving the
files compressed and wrapping them in another tar file before Rawrite-ing them
onto the floppy -- this allows you to fit larger files and more than one at
a time.  If you do this wrapping on a unix box instead of under dos it even
preserves the file names for you.

Subject: ESDI disk with 1629 cyl
Date: 24 Mar 92 22:36:07 GMT
Organization: The Great Beyond

Dilemma: I have a maxtor 600 MB drive with Ultrastor 12F esdi ctrlr.
The controller offers me track mapping, which, when invoked, fools
(DOS) into thinking it only has 1024 cyl (increases sectors/trk
accordingly).

BUT, Linux, like all other good Unix systems, won't run with the
controller in mapped mode.  Thus, I can only use 300+/- MB of
my disk.

Is there anything I/we can do to take advantage of the track
mapping?  I assume one would have to use the controller's
BIOS in some way. right?/wrong?

I'm willing to do some work myself - give me a place to start looking.

    I'm not familiar with the Ultrastor controller per se, but I do have 2 ESDI
drives that have more than 1024 cylinders.  I have a Western Digital controller.
It offers a mapping scheme that translates both drives cylinser count to some-
where around a quarter of the actual numbers and changes other counts accord-
ingly.  Perhaps the Ultrastor has a similar mode.  Linux accepts this mapping
just fine.

1) The file is kernel/chr_drv/keyboard.S.  keyboard.s is made during
   recompilation.

2) This used to be on the FAQ list.

3) One of the first changes I made the first time I recompiled the
   kernel:

   a)  In keyboard.S, delete the line '#define KBD_FINNISH'.

   b)  In the same directory, in the Makefile, add at the top
       a default line 'KB =FINNISH', and after the keyboard.s: keyboard.S
       line, insert the word '-DKBD_$(KB)' before keyboard.S.

   c)  In the main Makefile, two directories up, change the original
       line to '(cd kernel/chr_drv; make KB=$(KB))'
       and insert at the top 'KB = US' or UK or FR or whatever.

Hi,

	I have Linux 0.95a running fine on my 386 clone with 4Mb (80Mb IDE,
AMI bios, OPTI chip set).  Yesterday I bought 4Mb of RAM to bring my machine
up to 8Mb. The power on memory test OK's the new RAM; MSDOS runs fine; Minix
runs fine, recognizing all the memory.  However, Linux gives a kernel panic:
free block list corrupted, or some such.  I think it unlikely that the RAM is
at fault since I've switched the new RAM for the original 4Mb and everything
works fine.  Is this a known problem?  Do I have to reconfigure the kernel?
Any help would be appreciated.

Date: 25 Mar 92 00:51:49 GMT
Reply-To: dhl@wet.net.netcom.com (Dahai Li)
Organization: The Internet

Hello, every one,

I know someone has asked this question before, and I read the replies. But
I still make it work.

I un-tared 2misc.tar.Z and 2lib.tar.Z under "/usr/" directory, and ran the
"inst2.0" came with "2lib.tar.Z", with no problem.

I saw "/usr/lib/shared/" has the library files soft-linked to ones in
"/usr/gcc2/lib/gcc/i386-linux/2.0".

Then I compiled a a simple "main(){puts("Hello, world!")}" program, by
calling "gcc hello.c" command. (This gcc is from gcc2 package, not newgcc).
The size of file "a.out" is 30,722.

Then I copied the gcc lib files to the directory "/lib", and compiled the
program again, (and removed the "a.out" file) and compiled the program
again. Its size is the same as before, not "~5k" as mentioned in one of the
replies to the previous help request to shared lib.

I am terribly confused about people's comments on the contents in directory
"/lib", one reply says:
	"shared library itself must be in /lib"
another one says:
	".. copy /usr/gcc2/shared/lib/lib92.03.15 (or whatever the date
	is)"
and another one says:

	"/lib/what_this_version_of_the_shared_libraray_is_as_specified_in_crt0"
	
Are shared libary (libaries) in different files than the static ones, I saw
the  "inst2.0" script linking "/usr/lib/shared/*" and "/usr/lib/static/*"
to the same files?

Or is there a single piece of file containing the shared lib,
"lib92.03.15", which I cannot find from 2misc.tar.Z or 2lib.tar.Z?

Or it is something else?


Please help me out.


Thanks in advance.

I spend several hours last night trying to get 0.95a to work on my PC to

When I boot I get several HD timeout messages on both my hard drives...but
it gets through this and says "Partition tables OK" and boots...everything
seems to work ok for a while and I start untarring stuff (backup, gcc2.0, etc)
....only the first couple of untars work...I use the following command:

	tar zxvf /dev/at0

the floppy drive will be accessed for a while but it never starts untarring...
I can ^C out of it but after this happens once I am unable to untar anything
large...I have started from scratch by:

	mkfs /dev/hdb4 20757 -c
	mount /dev/hdb4 /mnt
	mktree /mnt

	install /mnt

but the same thing happens eventually...

My system is a 16MHz 386sx with AMI BIOS, 4 meg RAM, 2 MFM drives...my root

   Well, I've decided this isn't my day.  Thanks to all who wrote
me.  Since this morning, I have installed Linux twice!  Once
because I got the gcc (2.00) compiler working but ran out of swap
memory (I was compiling df.c  !).  So, brillant me decide to play
with the mkswap program(s).  Well, I did a 

  mkswap /dev/hda2
    (  It said it wanted a device name  )

Well, bad MOVE!  In a few minutes I had a totally trashed file system
with no idea how to repair it.  :)  I got a kernel panic (my first)
and fsck said "bad magic number in superblock"..  I found this very
funny.  :)

Second, I did a "find" and told it to exec tar xf...  Bad Move 2.
It untarred everything in my root.. EVERYTHING!  So, I'm starting
completely from scratch.  I'll get just the needed soures and 
binaries to function.  Maybe I can get somewhere except backup
heaven.  *grin*

Anyway,  one question.  (well two)
  Where can I get a binary of ps (process status)?  My roommate
  could not get it to compile either on his machine.

  And how do you fix file system problems?  I rm(ed) my swap
file that I managed to get on the second try and had a little
fun with fsck.. :)

Again, thanks to all who answered.
Wish my luck on install number 6!

Step one, uncompress kermit.tar.Z into kermit.tar.  If you are
doing this on a PC, get an MS-DOS compress/uncompress.  Otherwise,
do this on your system onto which you FTP'ed the compressed files,
before transferring them to your PC.

Step two, use rawrite.exe to write out kermit.tar to the floppy disk.

Step three, under LINUX, attach to the directory you want to untar
the file into.

Step four, "tar xf /dev/PS0".  This will extract all entries from
the "tar" file on the floppy disk into the current directory
(or as modified by the pathnames in the "tar" file).

rawrite does NOT write out a mountable file system.  It writes
out the file (in sequential sectors) directly on the floppy disk.
tar then treats the floppy as if it were a single disk file, with
the data stored sequentially.

Hi,
	I had the same problem when I tried to get the kermit in my system. 
Then I found out that the file was not in 'tar' form.  So I have to 'tar' it
(i.e.  tar cvf kermit.tar kermit) after I uncompress the file kermit.Z.

	Now I have another problem.  How to 'set line' so that I can use the
modem that is connected to serial port #1 ? 

	Thanks in advance.

I have been playing with Linux for a while now and I've noticed
two odd things that maybe somebody can help me with:

1.- Why can I execute a program (has the execute permissions set) that is

copy it to a directory in the path to run it!

2.- I have noticed that you can do a 'cd directory' even if you don't
have the access permissioms for that directory (non root login)!  You can't
do a 'ls' once you are in, but I think that you shouldn't be allowed to
'cd' into the directory in the first place if you don't have the access
permissions.  Any comments?

You need to have . in your path.  I don't recommend putting . in root's
path though.  Too easy to run something you didn't mean to.  If you're
root and you want to run something in the current directory, use "./something".

>2.- I have noticed that you can do a 'cd directory' even if you don't

Dunno, sounds like a bug unless you have "x" access, in which case being
able to cd but unable to ls is the correct behavior.

Someone mentioned a while back about going faster than 38400 on a serial port.
It's quite easy (in theory, at least) - edit the quotient table (near the
top of kernel/chr_dev/tty_ioctl.c) and replace the entries for 2304 (50 baud)
with 2 (57600 baud) and 1536 (75 baud) with 1 (115200).  You then
"#define B57600 B50" aand "#define B115200 B75" in your application, remake
the kernel, and everything should work.

BTW, the formula for converting baud rate divisors is 115,200 / baud_rate.
Works both ways, too...

Try setting up your CMOS wiyh the Power-On defaults if you have an AMI BIOS,
that is turn off/down your wait states for the bus, etc...  Also, turn off
the BIOS and VIDEO Shadow options.  Basically, don't tweak and push your
machine too much.  This works for me (386/33/64).

Subject: mtools... drive c: doesn't work in Linux 0.95a...??
Date: 25 Mar 92 04:12:24 GMT
Organization: Seattle University, Seattle WA


There's much more interesting things going on for Linux 0.95a I
know, but, (heh) I've got to get gcc2.0 and the libs are larger
than my 5 1/4"/1.2M floppy drive disks can hold. I was used to
(under Linux 0.12) just downloading things to the DOS box and
then using Mtools to copy it over to my Linux partition...
Now I can't read drive c: (/dev/hda1) (don't suggest me trying
to read /dev/hda for this stuff, as I did once in the 0.12 and
had mangled my DOS FAT tables and had to reformat the drive
and reload everything, luckily I've got x2WD 40Mb IDE's, one
for DOS, one for Linux)... can't Mtool anything to drive
/dev/at1 either...hmmmmm....
Is there some reason that things have changed at all in this
regards?

I'm trying to set everything up, plus walk a friend through the
process and add all of the steps in the (DOS) Beginner's Guide...
so any suggestions will get documented.

Subject: X386 - a unix platform xmindows
Summary: Looking for this puppy.

    I've heard about this xmindows (called X386?) that works on
many of the other unix(s) out there.  Has anyone heard of this too?
I've been wanting something like xmindows, actually anything that
will let be display graphics.  (I don't know enough about any unix
to figure out how to access and modify the IO prevl. map for the
386)

    I've found just about very thing on linux that my DOS
can do except graphics... (DOS has better interfaces for word
processing about I can live without it for now... :)

PS.  I think it is written entirely in assembly.

Thanks,
Dan

(DOS) BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO LINUX v0.95a
--------------------------------------
Compiled by Chuck Boyer with help from the persons on the
'alt.os.linux' newsgroup.
====================
Following are the 'copyright' for Linux, followed by the
guide itself. The 'Beginner's Guide' is in a 'draft' mode
and will be posted with updates about one weekly until
the target date of April 15, 1992 in which case I plan to
be done with its basic form.
==================== 
 
          RELEASE NOTES FOR LINUX v0.95
          Linus Torvalds, March 7, 1992
  
          COPYRIGHT
  
Linux-0.95 is NOT public domain software, but is copyrighted by me.
 
The copyright conditions are the same as those imposed by the GNU
copyleft: get a copy of the GNU copyleft at any major ftp-site (if 
it carries linux, it probably carries a lot of GNU software anyway, 
and they all contain the copyright). 
 
 
The copyleft is pretty detailed, but it mostly just means that you
may freely copy linux for your own use, and redistribute all/parts 
of it, as long as you make source available (not necessarily in the 
same distribution, but you make it clear how people can get it for 
nothing more than copying costs).  Any changes you make that you 
distribute will also automatically fall under the GNU copyleft.
 
 
NOTE! The linux unistd library-functions (the low-level interface
to linux: system calls etc) are excempt from the copyright - you 
may use them as you wish, and using those in your binary files 
won't mean that your files are automatically under the GNU 
copyleft.  This concerns /only/ the unistd-library and those (few) 
other library functions I have written: most of the rest of the 
library has it's own copyrights (or is public domain).  See the 
library sources for details of those. 
==================
(DOS) BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO LINUX/UNIX
================== 
          INSTALLATION
 
Installation of Linux is covered in two documents;
 
INSTALL-0.11
and
LINUX.FAQ
INSTALL-0.11 is the installation documentation that accompanied
version 0.11 of Linux and dealt with installing Linux onto a hard 
disk, among other things. LINUX.FAQ is the linux 
'Frequently-Asked-Questions' documentation file. Grab a copy of 
these for future reference. Most of the material will be beyond 
your understanding for a little while, but once you have installed 
your Linux copy for yourself you should have gained an 
understanding through the process to understand much of what is 
included in these documentation files.
 
It is assumed that you have a working knowledge of how to grab a
document, file, etc. from an archive site through Internet. You 
use 'ftp' to call up and log onto the system, 'binary' to set the 
mode of transfer, and 'get filename' to transfer the file from the 
logged onto system ftp site to your home directory of the machine 
you have called out from.
 
It is also assumed that you have a basic working knowledge of DOS
and can get around well enough. (Perhaps you know how to create 
batch files using your favorite editor, or 'copy con' command line 
statement, and how to use the basic DOS utilities; fdisk, copy, 
erase, etc...). I am only trying to create a documentation here for 
DOS users who are totally unknowlegable of Unix system calls, 
utilities, commands and lastly; being a System Administrator (which 
you will be once you have Linux up and running on your 386/486 
machine).
 
In a later chapter I will describe the commands and utilities, etc. 
that are available to you. I, too, am a 'beginner' unix system 
user, so much of the explanations found here have been 'donated' in 
time and effort by programmers/concerned users of Linux from the 
'alt.os.linux' newsfeed.
 
Anyway, back to installation of Linux on your machine. Basically,
you can run Linux one of two ways; either from your floppy drives 
only, or from your hard disk/drive. If you just want to play around 
with Linux and get the 'look and feel' of using a Unix Operating 
System (as opposed to a DOS operating system) then you might want 
to choose to just run it from the floppy drive. 
 
Basically, the logic here would be that, you don't want to screw up 
anything on your hard drive (which is loaded with Windows, word 
processors, graphics programs, data-base programs, etc.), and you 
have either spent long and hard learning hours to have it set up 
that way, or you had someone else set it up for you and you 
wouldn't have a clue on how to re-set it up yourself. Running Linux 
from your floppy disk drive will not screw up your hard drive, 
basically. 
 
There 'are' programs on the Linux disks that you will have access 
to that 'can' ruin your hard drive though. (typing 'mkfs /dev/hda' 
for instance may render your hard drive unreadable by DOS, but then 
you wouldn't know how to do that yet...). Or, you could run Linux 
from booting from the floppy drive and thereafter having it run 
from the hard disk drive. The differences between these two methods 
are that Linux will run a lot (10 times?) slower if you choose to 
run it solely from the floppy disk drive, and you will be limited 
to the commands and utilities that you can run using the floppy 
drive only situation. 
 
On the other hand, running from the hard disk drive will run Linux 
much faster/quicker as well as give you space to have many more 
programs and utilities to run/use, but it also entails you having 
to learn to 1) create a Linux partition on your hard disk drive, 
and 2) learning how to maintain this partition with a handfull of 
sub-directories.
 
===================
When you boot up Linux 0.95a with the two floppies, the second
(rootimage floppy) will put into Linux as the system admin-
istrator ('root', as well as '/'). You are presented with
a blank screen other than your line prompt ('#'). You are
sitting on a drive/directory which is the beginning directory.
You are root ('system administrator', or '/'). If you issue
a command 'ls(ENTER)' (that's; type 'ls' and hit ENTER), you
will be presented with a listing of the directories;
                                                    
# INSTALL         dev     mnt     usr
  bin             etc     tmp
 
 
====================
This is the '/root' ('/') directory on the Linux 0.95a
distribution file; 'rootimage.0.95a' at tsx-11.mit.edu 3/23/92.
 
(issue the command; 'ls -l' to get this type of listing;)
====================
 
drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root          160 Mar 17 19:33 INSTALL
drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root          432 Mar 17 18:14 bin
drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root         1232 Mar 17 19:18 dev
drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root          272 Mar 22 08:45 etc
drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root           32 Mar 17 17:06 mnt
drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root           32 Mar 17 14:20 tmp
drwxr-xr-x   3 root     root           48 Mar 17 18:15 usr
====================
These are 'all' directories. You can mount another drive using
'mnt', 'tmp', or 'usr' directories. You can move into a dir-
ectory by issuing the command; 'cd directoryname'. Try, for
instance,; 'cd INSTALL'. Do an 'ls -l' or 'ls' and see what
files are there.
 
Read the files with the command; 'more filename' (where 'file-
name' is any filename that you choose, i.e.; 'install' or
'readme', etc.). If the file is large and keeps scrolling across
the terminal screen then use 'ctrl-s' to stop it and 'ctrl-q'
to resume printing to screen. (the 'more' utility sends the
output of 'filename' to stdout, which is an abbreviation for
'standard out', which is just the term used to describe what
the process is doing). (stdin/stdout are two terms you will
see often in discussions here in the 'linux' newsgroup at times.
They stand for 'standard in, or 'the standard/default place
for input to come from = keyboard', or 'standard out' 'the
standard/default place for output to be sent = screen/monitor/
terminal').
 
====================
These are the files in the '/bin' directory on the Linux 0.95a
distribution file; 'rootimage.0.95a' at tsx-11.mit.edu 3/23/92.
--------------------
This is a listing using the command; 'ls'
(This ends the examples of using the 'ls' (straight, without
any 'switches' selected in the command line for optional output
in different formats.)

'/mnt'
and
'/tmp'
are empty of any files as they are the 'mounting' points for
floppy drives, hard drives, and other file systems that you
wish to mount to.
 
====================
These are the files in the '/usr/bin' directory on the Linux 0.95a
distribution file; 'rootimage.0.95a' at tsx-11.mit.edu 3/23/92.
====================
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     sys         29700 Mar  7 23:58 chmod

====================
 
An explanation of the above files' listing;
-rwxr-xr-x 
        are the 'permissions' settings for the files/directories.
1 root 
        is the owner of the file (root in this case.)
sys
        is the kind of file (a system file.)
29700
        is the size of the file in bytes.
Mar 7
        is the date the file was created (or last modified.)
23:58
        is the time the file was created (or last modified.)
chmod
        is the filename.
====================
EXPLANATIONS:
====================
Given the above example again of a directory listing of the
file 'chmod' in the directory '/usr/bin':
====================
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     sys         29700 Mar  7 23:58 chmod
 
        The 'permissions' settings for the files/directories.
        'r' means 'read' permission (can read the file).
        'w' means 'write' permission (can write to the file, i.e.
                edit/change it.)
        'x' means 'execute' permission (can execute the file,
                if it is an executable/binary file.)
 
-rwxr-xr-x
0123456789
        There are nine place holders for settings in 'all' 
        cases of permission settings on all files.
        The '0' place is for the type; file, or directory.
        The '1' place is for 'read' for 'sysadm/root'.
        The '2' place is for 'write' for 'sysadm/root'.
        The '3' place is for 'execute' for 'sysadm/root'.
        The '4' place is for 'r' for 'group'.
        The '5' place is for 'w' for 'group'.
        The '6' place is for 'x' for 'group'.
        The '7' place is for 'r' for 'all/anybody'.
        The '8' place is for 'w' for 'all/anybody'.
        The '9' place is for 'x' for 'all/anybody'.
 
The idea here is that a file can be set for security reasons
to be readable by some, all, nobody, writeable by some, all, 
nobody, executable by ..... etc. It is for system security 
reasons that the system administrator has the ability to set
file attributes/permissions so that only she/he can run certain
system routines, as well as other things. Also, any other user
can open up a directory and its files (or only certain files)
for others to read, others to write to (group that they all
belong to, for instance), or others to execute. So everybody
gets to set/change file attributes in one fashion or another.
The command to change a file that has just been written for
instance so that you can read it afterwards for instance is;
 
'chmod u+r filename'
 
To have it read and write and execute;
 
'chmod u+rwx filename'
 
To have 'all' read and execute it;
 
'chmod a+rx filename'
 
The three designations for changing files attributes then are;
read, write, and execute permissions set to either on or off.
Also, there are three sectors affected by these permission
settings; user, group, all. ('u', 'g', 'a').
 
=====================
ERROR CODES and their MEANINGS
=====================
You can find these by looking in /usr/include/errno.h and in 
/usr/src/lib/estdio/errlist.h . However this will be a problem if
you can't get you system up and running. (by the way, most programs
report "EPERM" instead of "error 2", which just depends on how
one compiled the program. 
 
Here comes  /usr/src/lib/estdio/errlist.h:
 
/* EUNKNOWN          0 */ "Unknown error",
/* EPERM             1 */ "Not owner",

COMMANDS and their USAGE
=================
(I must admit that I too am a beginner, so I have not included
the explanation for all of the commands available in Linux.
You will have fun learning from other books, reading news
discussions on the net, etc. I have given examples of the 
utility programs that you will find most helpful and most
useful during your first stages of learning.)
 
In my examples I will give you a listing of the command to
type and what you will type will be enclosed in single
quote marks; 'type this'. Then always assume to hit the
ENTER key. Also, where command affects a file for you
to use then I will give a generic name to the file
for the examples' sake of 'filename' where you supply
the actual name of the file.
=================
bawk
        pattern matching language
 
cat
        concatenate files and write them to standard output
 
        This means that using 'cat' you can list the contents
        of a file to your screen.         
 
        'cat filename'
 
        (you can also use the 'more' command as the standard
        file 'browser' utility. 'less' is an enhanced 'more.')
 
        
cd
        change working directory
        
        'cd ..' moves you backup one directory in the directory
        tree. (branches, root).
 
        'cd /' moves you to the root/beginning.
 
        'cd /usr/bin' from anywhere that you are moves you to
        that subdirectory.
 
 
chmod
        change access modes for files, directories.
 
comm
        print lines common to two sorted files
 
compress
        compress a file
 
        'compress filename' creates; filename.Z
 
        'uncompress filename.Z' creates; filename
 
 
cp
        copy a file
 
        'cp filename /usr/bin/filename' copies the file
        to the /usr/bin directory.
 
cut
        cut out columns in a file
 
dd
        disk dumper
 
df
        report free disk space and i-nodes
 
        You can use just 'df' to see a report of how much free
        disk space you have.
 
du
        print disk usage
 
file
        guess at file's type by contents.
 
find
        find files meeting a given condition
 
grep
        search a file for lines containing a given pattern
 
        'grep anything filename' will find each occurance
        of 'anything' in the file 'filename.'
 
group
        group identity
 
head
        print the first few lines of a file.
 
        'head filename' prints the first 5 lines of the file.
 
issue
        system identification file
 
kill
        send a signal to a process
 
ln
        (link)
        link a file
        using 'link' you can save file space in bytes. You issue
        a command line command to make a link in this directory,
        to a file which resides in another directory. The file
        in the other directory stays there. A 'name-marker' in
        the inode table is given a number and a filename in the 
        current directory that you are in. The new 'name-marker
        filename' link runs the file in the linked from file/
        directory.
 
        So;
        'ln /usr/lib/gcc cc'
 
        would give you a link in this current directory called
        'cc' to an actual file in /usr/lib named 'gcc'.
 
        The benefit of this is that the link filename is only
        the length in bytes as the filename place marker is.
        That's usually about 18 bytes. If /usr/lib/gcc was 180 
        thousand bytes, then this would be a huge savings in 
        disk spaced used/saved. Thus the benefit of 'link' which 
        in Linux is 'ln'.
 
        As in the example, 'ln' can also be used to make a second
        name for a file that is actually pointing to the first
        filename. (In the root floppy image of Linux distribution
        in /usr/bin directory 'uncompress' is actually linked to
        'compress', in the same directory. They both 'call' the
        same program at run time.
 
ls
        list the contents of the directory. (Show all files)
        (list contents of directory tree with files to standard
        out), (standard out is another name for the terminal,
        or monitor screen). (standard out in computerese is 
        referred to as 'stdout', so one may find that title
        referred to in a description.)
 
        'ls(ENTER)'   gives;.....
 
        file1   file2   file3   file4   readme  file6
        file7   file8   file9   file10  file11  file12

        You can fit the output of the directory listing command
        through the use of a director (greater-than symbol key)
        and put it into a file instead of to stdin/stdout 
        (keyboard, screen). 'ls > filenames'
        Would save the output of the 'ls' command to a file
        named 'filenames.' Then you can type the contents of
        'filenames' to screen (stdout).
make
        a program to run a 'Makefile' which is a script file
        to run a 'compile' process on a group of files to
        compile a program.
 
man
        display manual pages
 
mkdir
 
        make a directory.
 
        'mkdir dirname' creates a directory called 'dirname.'
 
mkfs
        make a file system
 
        You use this on a pre-formatted DOS disk to render
        it readable by the Linux Operating System. Or use
        it on a hard drive partition. You have to supply the
        size for mkfs to setup the drive/disk to. On floppies
        it's;
 
        'mkfs /dev/at0 1200' for 5 1/4" 1.2M disks -and-
 
        'mkfs /dev/at1 1400' for 3 1/2" 1.4M disks.
 
        For a hard drive partition you would first issues
        the command 'fdisk' to get a readout of the sizes
        on your partitions that fdisk reports. Then mkfs
        your partition size using that reported information.
 
        'mkfs /dev/hda2 20000' if it were the 2nd partition
        on your first/only hard drive and fdisk had reported
        the 20000 size.
        
mknod
        make a special file (/dev/***).
 
        
more
        pager
 
mount
        mount a file system
 
        You mount a file system so that you can access it.
        
        'mount /dev/at0 /mnt' would mount the disk in 
        the floppy drive to the filesystem name '/mnt'
        (which is provided for you on the distribution as
        an empty filesystem for this purpose.)
 
        'mount /dev/hda2 /usr' to set up second partition
        on first hard drive mounted to the '/usr' file
        system.
 
        
mtab
        mount table
 
mv
        move or rename a file
 
        'mv filename newfilename' would rename 'filename'
        to 'newfilename'.
 
patch
        patches up a file from the original and a diff
 
pr
        print a file
 
rm
        remove a file
 
        'rm filename' would erase the file.
 
rmdir
        remove a directory
 
        'rm dirname' would erase the directory only if it is
        first empty of any files. (You would have to remove
        all of the files first).
 
sh
        shell
 
        When you boot up Linux 0.95a you are in the shell.
        The shell in 0.95a is 'ash'. You can get 'bash'.
        Bash is larger but has more features.
 
 
stty
        set terminal parameters
 
sync
        flush the cache to disk
 
tail
        print the last few lines of a file
 
 
        'tail filename' would print to stdout/screen the last
        ten lines of 'filename'.
 
tar
        tape archiver/files w/sub-directories attached into
        a compressed 'tar' file.

This is a little program I wrote last night to patch linux boot diskettes
to boot from other devices without having to do the Norton/dd/whatever patch
stuff.  It won't work from the root diskette, because it has to be unmounted,
fixboot run, then re-mounted.  Maybe someone can fix this - it shouldn't be
very hard, but I've been busy with the Taylor-uucp port, and don't really have
time to hack it any further.

Not necessarily so :)  I hear that the 16550 can run at 115KB - also, if you're
running a fast 386 or 486, it might be able to handle it (with careful tuning
of the driver, that is).  That's why I said "in theory". It certainly won't
work in all cases.

BIBTEX

bibtex now works and is available for ftp in pub/linux/bibtex.tar.Z on
archsci.arch.su.oz.au (129.78.66.1). This file contains the binary file only
as the support files were included in texlib.tar.Z also available in the same
directory.

For those who need to do citations of the form (Knuth 1972) in their documents
the files in pub/harvard on the same site provide this capability together with
documentation in harvard.tex.

METAFONT

Binaries ONLY for metafont are available in pub/mfbin.tar.Z. You will need
to get font source files, etc from one of the standard tex sites.

dvips has a facility for generating fonts that it cannot find by calling a
script file called MakeTeXPK (provided either in texlib.tar.Z or dvips.tar.Z)
which will need modification w.r.t. where to put the generated pk files.
The dvips documentation describes this in more detail.

i put ptex.tar.Z in tsx-11.mit.edu's incoming today. it contains virtex
and my standard format file (plain + eplain [see Tex for the Impatient] +
a few extra fonts preloaded [ read tex.log ]). the expected directory
structure is listed in texdir.default (tfm files in
 /usr/local/lib/tex/fonts/tfm     ,etc)
together with dvips.tar.Z which is already in the usr.bin dir, this
is all one needs for hard-copy (+ lp and a printer of course).
   a screen previewer will take a while.

Oh bloody hell.  This news leads me to believe that there is some problem with
DTK motherboards and Linux.  I just hopped into here to post my own gripe about
a bug..  
 
Linux 0.95 runs just fine on my 386sx/16 with 4mb of RAM. it runs FAST! kudos.
  infact, it runs so fast that I decided to move it over to my BIG machine...
  alas.. no joy.
Linux 0.95 on my DTK 386/25 (no cache) with 4mb of RAM and two Seagate ST1144A

IDE harddisks does very odd things..  here's a description:

It runs alright, but at random intervals it 'sticks' and keeps repeating
"HD timeout" and the hard disk makes evil angry noises. IT continues to do this
for about 8 to 10 retries and then reports "HD I/O error: bad block xxxx"
(or an error messgage similar to that. my system is just sitting there being
perfectly calm at the moment, so I can't quote the message)  and then repeats
the entire cycle of "timeout-timeout-timeout-I/O error" over and over and over
until I give it a three finger salute.   I've picked up the habit of appending
a ";sync" to all my commands so that i don't lose much when I reboot it.
 
Is there a fix?  I am running 0.95.. would 0.95a help me any?  Are there any
other DTK users who are not having this or other problems?

Not all shells have a built in kill.  However, consider what happens 
when the process table fills up.  If kill is a process, and the 
process table is full, it can't be started.  So, you wait for 
update to sync, if it hasn't been killed, and hit The Big Red Button.  

However, if kill is also available as an internal command in the shell,
you can free up enough processes to sync and reboot.

Subject: DOS program to set root device
Date: 25 Mar 92 09:06:28 GMT

Here is a small DOS program I hacked using Turbo C to be able to
conveniently set the root partition. It is quite primitive, as it
requires major/minor device numbers and can only access a boot disk in
drive A:, but it works. Using it, installing Linux can be done in
these steps:

      1. boot the Linux boot disk
      2. make HD file system
      3. run install script
      4. sync
      5. boot DOS
      6. run setroot.exe to set root file system to HD
      7. boot the Linux boot disk again

Here's the source:

------------------------- begin setroot.c ------------------------------
#include <stdio.h>
#include <bios.h>
#include <conio.h>

char buffer[512];

void check(int res)
{
  if(res==0) return;
  printf("Disk error status: %x\n",res);
  exit(1);
}

main()
{
  int result,x;
  char in[80];
  unsigned int major, minor;
  printf("\n\nInsert Linux boot disk into drive A: and hit a key ...");
  getch();
  printf("\n");
  printf("Resetting controller ...\n");
  result=biosdisk(0,0,0,0,1,1,buffer);
  check(result);
  printf("Loading boot sector ...\n");
  result=biosdisk(2,0,0,0,1,1,buffer);
  if(result==6) result=biosdisk(2,0,0,0,1,1,buffer);
  check(result);
  printf("Current major boot device: %d\n",buffer[509]);
  printf("Current minor boot device: %d\n",buffer[508]);
  printf("\n");
  printf("New device values:\n");
  printf("Enter new major device: ");
  gets(in);
  sscanf(in,"%d",&major);
  printf("Enter new minor device: ");
  gets(in);
  sscanf(in,"%d",&minor);
  printf("\nCheck: changing root disk to major %d, minor %d\n",major,minor);
  printf("Is this OK (y/n)? ");
  x=getch(); printf("\n");
  if(x!='y')
  { printf("Aborting ...\n");
    exit(0);
  }
  buffer[508]=minor;
  buffer[509]=major;
  printf("Writing boot sector ...\n");
  result=biosdisk(3,0,0,0,1,1,buffer);
  check(result);
  printf("Root device changed!\n");
}
------------------------- end setroot.c ------------------------------

Among the file permissions which are not properly set, note that
the root disk sets all devices (including disks and kmem) to rw-rw-rw.
In general, disks (except DOS disks) and memory devices should
only be readable by certain users.  This may mean making, for example,
mtools setgid bin or something.

Mtools as delivered has some detestable code which resets the home
directory to a:\ if it hasn't been accessed in some time.  Is it
perhaps the case that you have not recently typed mcd c:?

Has anyone else noticed that the tools/pfdisk.tar.Z on nic.funet.fi
and on all its mirrors is corrupt?  This is a pain, since the
earlier version of pfdisk seemed to have been put together with
files transferred from a DOS system in binary mode, and containing
hundreds of null characters.

I use /dev/ps0, minor 16, for this.  On Minix, the tables were

     dev    x   size drive dsk tr sec
     fdx   0-3   any  any  any any any
     pcx   4-7  5.25  .36  .36 40  9

     PSx  28-31 3.50 1.44 1.44 80 18

You'll notice that a few combinations simply do not occur.  In that
case, something similar usually works: e.g., psx for a 720k floppy
in a 1.44mb drive, qdx for a double density 3.5 inch disk in a 1.4mb
drive.  fdx was supposed to be an inefficient way of reading/writing
virtually any floppy, but it often failed in practice.

This sounds like a case of bad permisssions.  /tmp must be rwxrwxrwx

Hi,	I'm thinking about setting Linux up and running it as a bbs. I
figured that it would make a quite powerful bbs, allowing the users to
do much more than uploading, downloading files and read news.  I'm 
wondering if anyone has done this before and would give me some suggestions.
I know Linux has bugs, etc. but I believe that it's save enough for nice
users.
	I'm especially interested in ways of setting up "notes" or "news"
etc. on Linux.  I was planning on writing one, but decided to ask around
if there're such programs already for Linux first.
	Any help would be appreciated.

Hi fellow netters!  i've got a BIG problem with Linux, thats probably 
already been covered, but I haven't been paying much attention to the
newsgroup lately.

My 386/25 has 4mb of real memory and i set up a 16mb swap partition
on my drive (as /dev/hdb4) (it seemed to need it. it did.)
and did the 
	mkswap /dev/hdb4 16384
	swapon /dev/hdb4
as shown in the release notes/installation 'guide'....
 
after about 4 hours of use installing lots of programs and rebooting and 
all sorts of natural things to do, it starts giving me:
Out of swap-memory
out of memory
Segmentation Fault
 
mkswap'ping the partition all over again doesn't fix anything.  
 
Why doesn't Linux release memory when it's done with it?!
 
This is linux 0.95 (not a..... haven't gotten 0.95a yet.)
 
Side Question: will Linux 1.0 be released as a complete self-installing 
package like 386bsd?  I vote yes.. :-)

One thing I'd like clarified.  Are we so enamored (sp?) with
'tty' that nothing else can be considered?  After having worked
a while with ISC's 386 UN*X, I've found I like their nameing
convention:  /dev/vt?? for Virtual Terminals, /dev/pt?? for
network psuedo terminals, and /dev/tty?? for real, honest-to-goodness
serial ports.  And yes, /dev/tty automagically gets your output
to you, regardless of which device you are actually using.

Admittedly the number of users on a Linux system (at the moment) is
very close to 1.  However, someday, that will change, and I'd like
to see a naming convention that lends one to easily see how someone
is accessing the machine.

Just a thought.

You don't use the -m switch to getty, do you? Well you shouldn't :-) 
If this is not the problem, then maybe it's just the good old problem with
high bps rates in linux.

On the other hand, getty does try to infer the baud-rate from the login-name.
Have you tried to just hit return or break a couple of times instead of
changing the baud-rate of the terminal.

You are right.

I am considering to replace the init program with a real sysV compatible init
that some guy from the Netherlands (forgot his name) wrote for minix.

That should fix that problem...

When the new libc is stable and source is released I will release the new and
improved version as poeigl-1.3.

I can't offer any suggestions, but I'm having the same problem.  I posted a
message about it a few weeks ago, and only got a few mail responses which
weren't much help.
    My system runs at 33 MHz with no problem under MSDOS.  It's only under
Linux that it crashes at 33 MHz.   What motherboard are you using?  I have a
DTK 486-33 with 64K cache & 4 Megs RAM.

Is it possible that the problem stems from the bus speed?  Many
machines run faster than the standard 8MHz, and some peripherals (HD,
e.g.), start to act flakey at higher speeds.

       Some cheapo 486 clones don't work properly in 32-bit mode.
I ran into this on a Greenleaf machine, which may have had a DTK
motherboard.  It passed Checkit, the PC diagnostic program, and would
happily run 8086 or 286-type programs, but anything that kicked it into
32-bit mode, like a program using a DOS extender, would crash.  

       I returned the computer and bought a Mac instead.

excessive. I'll have another look at pfdisk and see if I can find a
good boot program to write to my boot record (maybe some of the

Any way, sorry it's late (I did try to upload it last night but my
comms link was ropey) so here it is.... comments and suggestions to
Iain_Reid@uk.ac.ed as always please.]


Section II: Installation to Hard Disk
-------------------------------------


	You've tried the basic tests in section I; you liked what you saw
and you want to install to hard disk. Well, there are a few things you
should know before you start...


	The file system that Linux uses is not compatible with that of any
other operating system. You will, therefore, have to give it its own
area on your hard disk and keep that area separate from everything else.
This is done by creating a separate PARTITION (area of disk) for
Linux. This is quite straightforward but is a fairly major thing so
I'll start with a little theory so that you know what you're doing and
why...

.... There are two types of partition that Linux can use- primary and
extended. At the moment, however, the extended partition code is still
being written and tested so, in the interests of simplicity, I will
only cover primary partitions.


Q. What is a primary partition?
A. The first sector (512 bytes) of a hard disk contains the primary
   boot record. This is a record of various pieces of information
   about the physical characteristics of the hard disk, code for use
   during bootup and information about partitions. There is a fixed
   amount of space allocated for this partition information (enough for 4
   entries) and so there is a limit to the number of divisions that a
   hard disk may have (4). A primary partition is one of these 4 major
   divisions of a hard disk.	

   This limit of 4 partitions on a disk was rather restrictive and so
   secondary or extended partitions were introduced to bypass it. As
   with most add ons, however, they are not as "clean" from a
   programming point of view and special care is needed when dealing
   with them.


Q. How do you create a primary partition?
A. Simple. You just edit the partition table in the primary boot
   record to reflect your needs. Reformat any areas of the disk
   affected by the partitioning and that's about it (in theory
   anyway!)



Armed with that extensive tour of the intricacies of hard disk
partitions you are now ready for the main event. To make things
clearer I will use the example of a machine with one hard drive, a 107
Mb IDE drive which at the start has one partition (all disks must have
at least one) but which I want to divide into a 47 Mb Linux partition and
a 60 Mb Dos partition. The actual figures involved are irrelevant and
are meant as an example, not a guide.

Q. How much disk space should I give to Linux?
A. How high is the sky? This is very much a personal decision based on
your computing interests, whether you intend to run in single or
multi-user mode, whether you are planning to have Usenet stuff on your
disk etc etc. I can't give you a figure that is guaranteed to be what
you'll need. I doubt I could even come close but, even with a couple
of versions of the kernel compiled up, lots of source sitting around,
lots of big text files (linux mail archives), lots of Usenet stuff,
lots of utilities etc etc I haven't gone beyond about 18 Mb (+ 8 Mb
for swapping). At the moment I'm using about 18 Mb and that's only
because I've just de-archived my entire Linux partition and there are
lots of duplicate files to throw out.



Structure of the rest of this section
-------------------------------------

There are a number of topics which you may want/need to read about
before partitioning. To keep the main bit reasonably brief I have put these
at the end of the section as appendices. They are:

  Appendix A: The DOS bootable floppy

  Appendix B: Rootset.c


The rest is straightforward - Disk partitioning using pfdisk
                            - Installing Linux to hard drive
                            - Booting entirely from hard disk (not yet)
                            - Common problems and solutions (not yet)


Installing Linux to HD
----------------------

You will need: - the current bootimage (0.95a)
               - the current rootimage (0.95a)
               - tools to reinstall DOS, OS/2 after partitioning
               - Hard drive specifics (number of cylinders, heads and
                 sectors- look at your BIOS setup for these)

What to do:
-----------

1. Backup everything. You have no choice in this.... you either backup
   or say bye bye to DOS (or whatever else you have on your hard disk).

2. Boot up into Linux from floppy... login as root (see part 1 of this
   guide for details)

[ Remember, one HD, 107 Mb -> 47 Mb Linux + 60 Mb DOS ]

3. Once logged in run pfdisk as follows

# pfdisk /dev/hda

  This command means run pfdisk (a disk partitioner that comes on the
  0.95a root disk) on /dev/hda (my entire primary hard disk). Some text
  like this

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
# pfdisk version 1.2.1 by Gordon W. Ross  Aug. 1990
Modified by S. Lubkin  Oct. 1991
 
        Warning:  The device "/dev/hda" is assumed to have:
        cyls=306, heads=4, sectors=17 (an arbitrary guess).
 
        This program was compiled for generic UNIX and therefore
        does not know how to determine the disk parameters.  You must
        describe the disk geometry manually, using the 'G' command.
For help, enter: '?'
pfdisk>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

  will appear if all goes well. The first thing to do is to tell pfdisk some
  things about your hard disk using the 'g' command ('g' for geometry).
  The format for this is g <cylinders> <heads> <sectors> so for a disk
  with 523 cylinders, 15 heads and 28 sectors (such as mine), the
  command would be 

pfdisk> g 523 15 28

  Next you use the 'l' command ('l' for list) to see what is currently
  set. You should see 4 entries (remember 4 primary partitions per hard
  disk) but only one of them should have any numbers in it (one 107 Mb
  partition) . For a partitioned disk this looks something like this

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
pfdisk> l
# Partition table on device: /dev/hda
geometry 523 15 28 (cyls heads sectors)
#  ID  First(cyl)  Last(cyl)  Name  # start, length (sectors)
1 128    512        228       Minix # 28, 96152
# note: first(1): phys=(512,1,0) logical=(0,1,1)
# note: first(1): phys=(512,1,0) should be (512,0,1)
2   6    229        521       DOSbi # 96180, 123060
3   0      0          0       empty # 0, 0
4   0      0          0       empty # 0, 0
active: 2
pfdisk> 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

  You may have noticed that my first partition runs from cylinder 512
  to cylinder 228....a feat that is physically impossible as far as I
  know. This is an artifact from a battle with edpart (a DOS disk
  partitioner) which I would strongly advise you to avoid. The first
  cylinder should be 0 but the disk seems stable enough so I'm going
  to leave it until i have problems.

  Make a note of the number in the ID field (labelled) for the single
  partition. If you are partitioning a dos disk (as in the example
  then this value will probably be 6. For other systems other values
  apply.

  Make a note of the maximum cylinder (521 on mine despite the fact
  that the tech support people reckon 523 and the bios is set to 523)

  Now for the clever bit..... I decided I wanted 2 partitions (47Mb
  and 60 Mb) so I divide up my 523 cylinders in that ratio i.e.

  (47/107) x 523 = 229 clusters for Linux (near enough)
  (60/107) x 523 = 294 clusters for DOS (what a waste)
                   ---
                   523 <-- make sure everything adds up!
                   ---

  then you use the "unnameable" command to partition your hard disk.
  The format of this command is

  n sys_id first_cluster last_cluster sys_name

  where n ............ is the partition number
        sys_id ....... is a magic number (ID in example above)
    and sys_name ..... is optional and should not be used ('cos it
                       makes things fail (strange but true)


  For DOS sys_id is 6 (and you should have seen that in the ID field
  above), some other systems have their own code. Linux doesn't so
  pick an arbitrary number such as 128 for the Linux sys_id and use
  whatever the original ID was for the other partition (e.g. 6 for
  DOS).

  For the example disk I would type the following

pfdisk> 1 128 0 228
pfdisk> 2 6  229 521

  Explanation time..... partition 1 is now a Linux partition with 229
  clusters (0 to 228 inclusive). Partition 2 is a Dos partition with
  294 clusters (Mmmm... my bios is set up as 523 cylinders but every
  partitioning program I have tried reckons 521 (+ this was the
  maximum in the original partition so I reckoned that 521 was the one
  for me. Seems to work ok but I'd check with someone who knows what
  they are doing if I were you :-)).

  Last bit... last but not least is the 'a' command ('a' for active)
  which marks a partition as the one to boot from. I chose partiton 2
  (DOS) 'cos Linux cannot boot entirely from hard disk without some
  assistance (more later). So ....

pfdisk> a 2

  Finally, the 'wq' command ('wq' = write partition table and quit) so...

pfdisk> wq


 4. That wasn't too bad was it? Now all you need to do is make a Linux
    filesystem, install Linux and rebuild DOS. Filesystem first I think...

    ... at the command prompt use the fdisk command and you should see
    something like this

# fdisk
Disk 0:
    /dev/hda1:  48076 blocks unknown partition type 0x80
    /dev/hda2:  61530 blocks active 16-bit DOS (>=32M)
#

	What this tells you is that you have 2 partitions which, as far as
    Linux is concerned, are known as /dev/hda1 and /dev/hda2.
    /dev/hda1 is 48076 blocks long (1 block = 1 Kbyte thus this 
    partition is 48076/1024 or 46.9 Mb) and is of type 0x80 (hex 80 =
    decimal 128 (sound familiar yet?)). The other one is a 60 Mb Dos
    partition.

	Next you use the mkfs command (make filesystem) with the following
    format
 
    mkfs -c device blocks

    the -c option specifies that it should perform some checking as it
    works and the blocks figure is the one from fdisk (above). To make
    a file system on this partition I would type

# mkfs -c /dev/hda1 48076

    Your hard disk will be busy for a few minutes and you should get
    some numbers popping up and changing on your screen. Don't worry
    about these... you don't need to know anything about them (nor
    could I tell you much about them :-))


    Ah, finally.... you are ready to install to HD! Thanks to Jim
    Winstead's excellent installation scripts this is easy as pie so
    without further ado type the following

# mount /dev/hda1 /mnt

    to "attach" your newly created/formatted partition to the file
    system (currently on the floppy) at the mnt directory in the root
    directory. Remember to use whichever device you have formatted.

    Now type

# cd /INSTALL
# ./install /mnt

    to run the installation script and install the file system bits
    and pieces in whatever is attached to the file system at /mnt.
    This is of course part of your hard disk so you are now installing
    properly to hard disk from the original file system on the floppy
    disk. Clever huh?

	When that finishes (you'll know when) you unmmount you partition
    by using the umount command (e.g. umount /dev/hda1) and you should
    sync (see part 1 of this guide) and logout (with the exit command).

WARNING: ALWAYS SYNC IF POSSIBLE AND LOG OUT PROPERLY. THIS IS UNIX
         NOT MESSY-DOS AND THE 'OLD 3 FINGER SALUTE (CTRL-ALT-DEL) WAY
         OF EXITING IS LIKELY TO LAND YOU IN TROUBLE SO DON'T DO IT!


  5. Go back to DOS and edit the bootimage to reflect the partition
     upon which you have installed Linux. How? Well, there are 2 main
     methods:

        1. Edit a fresh copy of the bootimage and rawrite it to a
           FRESH floppy (i.e. not you existing bootimage 'cos you
           never know when you might need that (pure floppy boot +
           mount /dev/hd?? is a very useful way to sort out problems)).

        2. Edit the bootimage disk (while keeping a copy- same idea as
           at 1). I haven't come across any binary editors that can read
           in rawritten disks but the Turbo C absread and abswrite
           function seem to manage it (see Appendix C) so you could
		   write a small utility to make your life easier/safer (as I did)


	The important bit, regardless of the method used, is to change the
	bytes at offset 508 and 509 in the bootimage to store the major and
	minor numbers for your new Linux partition.

	For a hard disk the major number (offset 509) is always 3, and the
    minor number is a combination of primary or secondary HD drive and
    partition details (see FAQ for details). Suffice to say


    Device      Major    Minor       Device      Major    Minor
    ------      -----    -----       ------      -----    -----
    /dev/hda1     3        1         /dev/hdb1     3        65
    /dev/hda2     3        2         /dev/hdb2     3        66
    /dev/hda3     3        3         /dev/hdb3     3        67
    /dev/hda4     3        4         /dev/hdb4     3        68
    /dev/hda5     3        5         /dev/hdb5     3        69
    /dev/hda6     3        6         /dev/hdb6     3        70
    /dev/hda7     3        7         /dev/hdb7     3        71
    /dev/hda8     3        8         /dev/hdb8     3        72


  6. Boot up linux with your new boot floppy. It should give the
     loading messages and then switch to booting and running from hard
     disk.

	 Taaaaaa-Daaaaaa!


  7. When you're happy with it logout and rebuild dos. I don't intend
	 to cover this in any detail 'cos most dos manuals already do
     that. What you need to is to format your new dos partition using
     format (on the dos bootable floppy you made). Something like

A:\ format /u /s /v:"Dos_5_0" c:

	 should do the trick. After that finishes you should have a
     bootable Dos partition on your hard disk and you can reinstall
     from your backups.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Appendix A: The DOS bootable floppy
-----------

Q. What is a "DOS bootable floppy"?
A. A DOS bootable floppy is a floppy disk containing just enough of DOS to be
   able to be "boot up" and produce a command prompt. It consists of 4 things:

      1. A DOS boot sector (first 512 bytes on the disk)
      2. MSDOS.SYS (a hidden dos system file)
      3. IO.SYS (another hidden dos system file)
      4. COMMAND.COM (the DOS command interpreter)

Q. Do I need one?
A. If you run DOS at the moment and want to keep DOS somewhere on your hard
   disk then you will need to create a DOS partition. Once created you will
   need to reinstall DOS to this partition and a bootable floppy makes this
   much, much easier.

Q. How do I make one?
A. You can create one in either of two ways using DOS commands.

1. Use the SYS command with a blank, DOS formatted floppy disk e.g.

# sys a:

   will copy the "system" (the 4 things above) to a disk in drive A.

2. Use the FORMAT command with the /s and /u switches e.g.

# format /s /u /f:1.44 /v:"Dos_Boot" a:

   will perform an unconditional format (checks for bad sectors etc) on the
   1.44 Mb floppy disk in drive A, labels it Dos_Boot (11 characters maximum
   allowed length) and copies the "system" on to it.

Now test it by resetting your machine with the boot disk in the floppy drive.
Your machine should start up (floppy is much slower than hard disk though)
and you should get a command prompt. Try some simple commands like DIR to
satisfy yourself that you are running from floppy only.

[ If your machine boots from hard disk and ignores the floppy you will need
  to check your BIOS setup and enable "Floppy Seek at Boot" (AMI BIOS) or
  equivalent option and try again. ]

Next you need to copy some things to your bootable floppy. What you copy is
entirely up to you but the following is the sort of thing I have on mine

4DOS  - 4dos.com            [ an excellent command.com replacement ]
      - aliases.txt         [ my command aliases/macros for 4dos ]

DOS   - ansi.sys
      - attrib.exe
      - emm386.exe
      - fdisk.exe
      - format.com          [ Absolutely essential! Do NOT forget ]
      - himem.sys
      - keyb.com

UTILS - pkunzip.exe         [ for restoring backups ]

autoexec.bat
command.com                 [ Just in case ]
config.sys
filelist                    [ dir /skf c: > filelist before I backed up ]

Once you've got everything you think you want onto the floppy write protect
it (in case of foolishness) and THOROUGHLY TEST IT (i.e. make sure it boots,
formats, restores backups etc 'cos you're going to have to rely on it!)

You can't run an asynchronous port reliably with a divisor of 1.  It has
to do with how the chip samples the analog signal -- you need divide by 2
at least.  So 57600 is about the upper limit on PC hardware.  And with kernel
and interrupt latency, that's pushing it.

Hello linuxers,

Earlier I posted regarding problems with Jove, asking if anyone has
has similar problems.

I have found that Jove 4.14 compiled on my school HP-UX system
works fine with terminals supporting vt100 emulation at school
and Telix at home, but produces garbled screens with kermit
at under Linux over the modem, comparable to the garbled screens
I get when I run Jove on Linux.  In addition, less(1) doesn't work
properly over the modem, and some screen-manipulation characters
printed on startup don't work. :-(

I'm wondering if anyone has had similar (or contrary) experiences.
I plan to investigate the nature of the emulations defects as
time permits.

With all the fancy things going in to Linux these days, let's not
forget the simpler important ones such as terminal emulation that
is either 1) standard or 2) accurately represented in termcap.

Cheers, :-)

David.

Subject: gcc1.4 and mtools
Date: 25 Mar 92 09:50:01 GMT
Organization: Cray Research, Inc.

Firstly, thanks to all those who sent me suggestions about how to
get gcc 1.4 installed and working.  I don't think I quite followed
anybody's suggestions exactly, but this is what I did:

1. Got include-0.12.tar.Z fromt tsx-11.mit.edu in pub/linux/sources/system
   Untarred it in the root diretcory / of my linux system

2. Got newgcc.tar and untarred in directory /usr of my linux system

3. Got newlibc.tar.Z from tsx-11.mit.edu in pub/linux/sources/lib and
   extracted limits.h and placed this in /usr/include

4. Linked *all* of what was in /usr/lib to /usr/local/lib:

   ln -s /usr/lib/* /usr/local/lib

   (I still got some funny error message if I only linked cc1 and cpp)

And that was that.

To compile mtools, I untarred mtools-2.0.5.tar.Z
from hpb.mcc.ac.uk (130.88.200.7) in pub/linux/tools into / on my linux 
system (the mtools files are placed in a new /mtools directory).

The Makefile seems to expect a compiler called cc rather than gcc, so I just
copied gcc to make a new command called cc (I didn't know what else to do, but
there is probably an easier way - just changing the line LD = cc in the 
Makefile didn't work).  I left the Makefile file as it was.

Then I edited devices.c to include a devices structure for my DOS disk 
drives.  This is full of #ifdefs which I didn't like the look of so I copied
the dell entries, deleted the #ifdef and #endif lines and edited them as
follows:

struct device devices[] = {
        {'A', "/dev/flpy", 0L, 12, 0, (int (*) ()) 0, 80, 2, 18},
        {'C', "/dev/dos", 0L, 12, 0, (int (*) ()) 0, 0, 0, 0},
        {'\0', (char *) NULL, 0L, 0, 0, (int (*) ()) 0, 0, 0, 0}
};

(Drive A is 1.44 Mb 3.5 inch floppy - see the Configure file for others.
 My drive C is only 15 Mbytes, so it is FAT 12, but anything bigger is 
probably FAT 16)

Then entering the make command, and a cup of coffee and it was all done.  
I linked the device names I used in devices.c to the actual disk 
device names:

ln -s /dev/PS0 /dev/flpy
ln -s /dev/hda1 /dev/dos

And yippee, mcopy, mdir, etc all worked.  

Thanks again for the help - the above may not be the most elegant way to
do it - apologies, but I don't know any better!

Trivia question: what is the standard make for linux? I'm
(unsuccessfully) using pmake, and absolutely nothing is working. Can't

Wish I could say the same :)

I get the following error from ld when compiling mattrib.o (in mtools):

mattrib.o: undefined symbol ___stderr referenced from text segment.

But stderr *is* defined in stdio.h, which is #included in mattrib.c.
What gives? Very perplexing.

Help would be tremendously appreciated.

Subject: Problems with terminal on ttys2
Date: 25 Mar 92 14:18:55 GMT
Organization: Concert Network -- Internet Operations Group

Well, I noticed the support for /dev/ttys[34] in the kernel under .95a, and
was extremely happy to be able to move my modem off to ttys3!  It works GREAT!

Anyway, as with all things, now I have another problem.  Having cleared ttys2,
I re-enabled my multi-IO boards "COM2", and tried hooking up my other PC as
a terminal (my wife wants to play nethack while I work, and being able to
share the modem would be nice too).  

Having added this line to my /etc/rc:

		/bin/stty 9600 < /dev/ttys2 > /dev/ttys2

and adding this line to /etc/inittab:

		ttys2:vt100:/bin/getty 9600 ttys2

and connecting the two machines with a null-modem (actually a smart-cable that
is acting like a null-modem), I get garbage when the machine first puts up 
the "welcome to linux" message, and no keystrokes on the remote machine ever
seem to get back into /bin/login.  I have tried running kermit out over ttys2,
and get a repeatable sequence that makes *NO* sense what-so-ever, and again,
no keystrokes on the remote machine are ever displayed by kermit.

I have tried all parity/speed combinations that my hardware supports, so now I
am finally saying:

	 HAS ANYONE GOTTEN THIS TO WORK, AND IF SO, HOW??

	I AM SURE IT IS A NUMB-SKULL CONFIGURATION PROBLEM

			BUT I CAN'T FIND IT!

Reply-To: apr%dec001.ziap.wtza-berlin.de@noc.belwue.de (Andreas Priebe)

Hi Linuxers,

again some questions/remarks:


1.
MTOOLS:
I made in devices.c several entries for A and B (to read 360/720/1.2 in 1.2M
and 720/1.44 in 1.44MB drive).
A 1.2MB disk in a 1.2MD drive and 1.44 in 1.44 work very fast and without
any error messages.
Reading a 720k in an 1.44MB drive gives:

Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
floppy I/O error
dev 021c, block 9
Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
Reset floppy called
floppy I/O error
dev 021c, block 9
Reset floppy called

After that the normal mtools header (anyway I don't like that header,
to much information for a simple copy, but he tells me that 9 sectors
and all the other things are correctly recognized) appears and
the data (ie dir or copy) are correct.
Similiar results are obtained with 360k/720k in an 1.2MB drive, although the
number of "Reset floppy called" may differ.
The data don't seem to be corrupted.

Is this the normal behaviour (I had this with 0.12 already!) - can't
I use several formats on one drive type?

BTW: I can't remember exactly, but it seems somebody had patches to mtools
which allowed copying (mread/mwrite) to/from stdout/stdin with file - .
Could this guy drop me a mail with the patches???

2.
Maybe I'm wrong, but should'nt compile at least the kernel _without_ any
warnings?
I applied the Alpha patches from Linus to 0.95a and get several (not too much,
but some warnings) (using gcc1.40) - ok its Alpha only, I know,
but I think its a priciple question.
BTW: It would have been nice, if somebody had mentioned to use patch 
with "-l" (or is it assumed, that Alpha testers guess it themselves?).
With me the patches work, but sometimes with very hard disk traffic
(swapping during 2 parallel compilations and several background
"ls -lR / &") I get HD timeout which don't seem to corrupt the results.

3.
I applied the patches for extended partitions (by Charles Hedrick,
22 Mar 00:33 GMT). This is what I get after makeing a new kernel and
booting:

[stuff about partitions on disk 1 and 2 - seems ok]
[but shouldn't end and start of two partitions differ by one ?]
harddisk I/O error
dev 0303, block 0
Unable to read partition table of device 303
[but the extended drive within hda3 was recognized already with exact size!]
part 4 [ .... start size end stuff]
Partition tables ok
Kernel panic. Unable to mount root [Why that ??? Root is 304!]

Why is there anything about 303 ? Root device is 304! (BTW 303 is
an extended DOS partition with one drive! - see below)
Why is the partition table on the second extended partition on the
second physical drive recognized ok ?
Maybe this is due to the fact, that 303 contains one DRDOS6 drive, compressed
with SuperStor???? If that is the case, why not simply ignoring it
(with a warning) - Mounting Root should be possible anyway!

My disk setup : 2 drives IDE, first Quantum 50MB, second Seagate 3144A (123MB).
3 partitions on drive 1 (2,3,4 - 3 is extended with one drive, Linux root is 4),
4 on drive 2 (1-4, 3 is extended with one drive, 2 is Linux swap, 4 is
mounted Linux partition)
I could mail additional data about my partitions if anybody want - don't want
to post them.

4.
Shouldn't create Linux a core-file after dieing a process with
segmentation fault ?

5.
A shutdown script would be very nice. Anybody working on it or another
way to go to single user mode and back to multiuser?


Greetings from Germany

This is what happens if you use the /dev/PS0 device (ie "b 2 28") - to
read a 720kB floppy you have to use anuther device number: linux doesn't
try to find out what kind of floppy you are using (which seems to be
relatively standard unix practice). Use /dev/ps0 ("b 2 16")

Minor number for floppies are as follows (should be in the FAQ):

nr+4*type, where nr = 0,1,2,3 for A,B etc floppy
type:
1 - 360kB floppy in 360kB drive
2 - 1.2M floppy in 1.2M drive
3 - 360kB floppy in 3.5" drive
4 - 720kB floppy in 3.5" drive
5 - 360kN floppy in 1.2M drive
6 - 720kB floppy in 1.2M drive
7 - 1.44M floppy in 3.5" drive

>2.

Ok, I was lazy: I use "-Wall" for gcc which gives warnings for most
everything, and I didn't correct quite all the warnings. They are easy
to correct, or you can remove the -Wall flag :)

>3.

Hedrick's patches break with more than one drive: he had only one drive
to test on.  I'll make a new alpha-patch available which should fix most
problems (including this), but it won't be until next week. 

>4.
>Shouldn't create Linux a core-file after dieing a process with

It doesn't even try right now: I don't know in what format the core-file
should be anyway etc..  I might implement it if somebody tells me what
format gdb expects, or I'll accept patches (the stubs are there already,
but the actual core-dumping isn't). 

>5.
>A shutdown script would be very nice. Anybody working on it or another

Ok, at least the 0.95(a) kernel supports it: I haven't tested it out,
but the reboot system call should be able to reboot the machine, so
automatic shutdown isn't that difficult any more.  Anybody interested in
writing one? Note that the reboot system call needs a lot of magic
numbers (I didn't want any accidental reboots), and can also
disable/enable the three-finger-salute for people who don't like it.

Is C-A-D "unreliable" for anyone else?  For me, sometimes the machine
reboots, sometime the system merely hangs.  This is no biggie right now,
but it interfere with a complete shutdown implementation. 

I noticed some changes to reset_now (?) in .95a wrt .12.  Know what the
significance of them are?

   I'm wondering if anyone has, or knows a way I can obtain or create,
   a VAX cross compiler (for a MicroVAX) that will run under Linux?
   I both some variant of CC as well as an assembler-- (gcc and gas
   would be great, but can they be built under Linux to compile for
   a VAX?)  As far as libraries go, I can probably just build most
   of them from the Linux sources, once I have the compiler/assembler,
   or I can get them from a local site here, if the a.out format
   is compatable with the BSD format.
   Do I need a new version of ld, too, or is it generic enough to work
   with any system that uses the same a.out?

This goes back to the same old issue of how to get GNU cc and ld built
properly to cross-compile.  It's not hard to get the compiler to
cross-compile (find a gcc source distribution and read the doc files) for a
given architecture, but it's a royal pain getting gld to do the right thing
across architectures.  I tried doing this in the reverse direction - I
tried to build a cross environment to build Linux executables from both a
Sparc and a VAX.  I could do everything but the ld step, and I eventually
gave up (for now).

You may have better luck than I.  Part of the problem with what I was
trying to do I bet results from the FSF not testing it with a 386 sysV
target (there aren't many of them widely available).  On the other hand, I
bet the VAX target has been extensively tested, so maybe it'll be doable.

To get started, find the latest gcc and binutils source distributions
(prep.ai.mit.edu is the canonical distribution point), and start studying
the doc files (you'll need to know how to run tex and view/print .dvi
files).  It's supposed to be easy to build cross-development environments.

Can anyone explain why it seems to be so difficult to get gcc 2.0 running
under Linux?  It's supposed to "just work" off-the-shelf, right?  I mean a
386/387 SysV object in a.out format is pretty generic, why are there Linux
issues involved (I'm sure I'm just being ignorant - educate me)?  Are any
of the problems being encountered relevant to trying to build a gcc that
runs under Linux but produces code for a VAX or Sparc?  If so (I doubt it),
Frank would presumably need to start building his tools from the sources
ported to Linux, not the vanilla GNU distributions.

Gcc2.0 can be found under "/pub/linux/bianaries/compilers/gcc2.0" directory
at  ftp site tsx-11.mit.edu.

But I just learnt from some body else that that one doesn't have shared
libarary, and you need to get the newer version of gcc2.0 from ftp site
dec1.eecs.wsu.edu.

Happy hacking.

   What's enough money?  Subsistence, comfortable, filthy rich?  Really,
   that's a quite vague goal.  It's also interesting the number of people
   that have been able to make very significant contributions to Linux on
   their free time, with extremely little to (more likely) no monetary
   reward.  I cannot see Linux being a full-time thing for anyone at this
   point, really.

   You're dreaming!  Have you tried adding up the cost of all these
   wonderful things your enterprise is going to buy?  All of the things
   you mentioned would cost in the thousands, each.

I don't know, maybe Linux isn't ready for this, but in principle the
idea doesn't seem too bad and there is precedent for it.  The GNU
project is being worked on by a mixture of volunteers and full-time
paid hackers, and the Free Software Foundation gets the money to pay
the hackers by distributing tapes and manuals (but not phone support).
The FSF salaries are a lot lower than industry would pay comparable
programmers: they are intended to provide people willing to work on
GNU full time a way to keep a roof over their heads while doing so.
In this sense, anyone working for the FSF needs to have a streak of
volunteerism.  I was the first paid FSF programmer (in 1986-7) and found
it to be a very rewarding experience.  Working on free software
around first-classs programmers was infinitely more satisfying
than standard sleazy software company jobs, even though it paid a
lot less.

Date: 25 Mar 92 17:42:19 GMT
Organization: The Ohio State University
Nntp-Posting-Host: bottom.magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu

Last night I obtained the linux 0.95a bootimage and rootimage from
tsx-11.  Linux will boot from my floppy but I get HDtimeout (roughly
10 times) followed by I/O error and "Unable to read partition on
device 0300"  followed by the same messages as it tries to access my
second harddisk.

The root system is running fine from the floppy drive.  fdisk tells me
about one partition on my C: drive (which I want to remain DOS) and
one on my D: drive (currently DOS but which I want to devote to
linux).  The partition sizes and types are correct.  I then run "mkfs
/dev/hdb1 43529 (I think)" and am told that linux is unable to write
the file system.  The error that shows up here has varied each time I
have run mkfs but it seems to have something with not finding the
partition table.

My system is about as vanilla as you can get.  I'm running a

DTK 386SX-16 with 5mb
2 Seagate HD's : 1239A (drive C:)
                 st251-1A (drive D:)
1.2 mb floppy.

I don't know what to do about this.  Once upon a time linux-0.12 ran
just fine, created a filesystem, and mounted /usr on D: with no
problems.  I foolishly erased those images.  I'll go back to version
0.12 if I have to but I would prefer to run 0.95a.  I've checked the
FAQ but all it implies is that is fdisk works then mkfs works.
Obviously that's not the case.  Any assistance will be appreciated.

Thanks,

Bill

Bonjour a tous, 
Y-a-t-il un francophone sur le reseau
(marre de ne pratiquer que la langue de Chat qu'expire :)

Linux est Genial !!!


------------------------8<----snip/snip----->8-----------------
VI. INSTALLATION HINTS 
======================

QUESTION: Where can I find the basic starting help?

ANSWER: You have to download the INSTALL notes, and more specially
the 0.11, 0.12 and the current one 0.95(a). Pretty soon, a special
help for beginners will be available on the net.


QUESTION: I've got all the things on site ??? but I don't know what
goes where.

ANSWER: include.tar.Z goes to /usr/include;  system.tar.Z contains 
the latest sources of the
system files (mkswap, mkfs, fsck and fdisk). In version 0.12
utilbin.tar.Z has been replaced by fileutil.tar.Z and utils.tar.Z
which contains a new tar to handle the symbolic links, make, uemacs
kermit and minor programs (sed,...).  Other utilities have been ported
separately.


QUESTION: I don't know how to install gcc stuff, is there special places?

ANSWER: It depends on the release of gcc you are using. Right now
there are 3 packages : the original one gccbin.tar.Z contains all
the gcc-1.37 binary distrib; recently the gcc-1.40 has been ported,
it's in newgcc.tar.Z and a few days ago the BETA version of gcc-2.0 
Choose yours

A) gccbin.tar.Z goes in /usr/local/lib except gcc which goes in 
/usr/local/bin. Moreover each gcc-xxx of /usr/local/lib should be 
linked with gxxx and xxx in /usr/local/bin. 

B) newgcc.tar.Z goes in /usr, then uncompress and untar it. Files are
directed to /usr/lib, /usr/include and /usr/bin. You have to link ar,
as, ld with gar, gas and gld, this will prevent some error while using
make (especially whilst re-compiling Linux kernel). More information can 
be found in section VIII. 

C) gcc-2.0 is splitted in 2 files 2lib.tar.Z and 2misc.tar.Z, to
install them do the following:
cd /usr
tar xvofvz 2misc.tar.Z

read the FAQ in /usr/gcc2/install. Then

cd /usr
tar xvovfz 2lib.tar.Z


QUESTION: When I use the images, and i type "tar xvf ..." I got
"command not found". What did I wrong?

ANSWER: Nothing, in the distribution of 0.95 there is no tar (due to
lack of place); you should get the 0.12 images where the tar is in 
compressed form (lack of place). You have first to copy tar.Z on 
another disk/diskette and uncompress it, this command is available 
on your diskettes.
BTW tar and compress are back in v0.95a distrib.

QUESTION: It seems that $#@! ported on linux don't run correctly

ANSWER: Possible, but check first if the size of your file corresponds
to the one on the ftp sites, if it is then check the BUGLIST available
on the main linux sites. If the bug is not reported, do a complete
report of the error, try to correct it and send your result to
johnsonm@stolaf.edu.


QUESTION: Does anyone port this to linux?, if not i'll compile it

ANSWER: First check on the sites, have a look to the info-sheet
monthly post and also available on sites. Have a look in the "old"
digest files and mail-archives of linux-activists, these are kept at
least at tsx-11 and nic possibly at tupac. Look also at the GNU(*)
utilities to see if someone has already written a freely distribuable
version. Ask then on the list/news.


(*) GNU stands for GNU's Not Unix, which (besides being a recursive
acronym) is a project started by the Free Software Foundation (the FSF)
to write a freely distributable version of Unix.  The GNU kernel is
named HURD, and is based on Mach.  It is currently being written, and is
not yet done.  Many of the GNU utilities, however, are completed and are
much more functional than the original Unix utilities.  Since they are
freely available, Linux is using them as well.


QUESTION: I've ported *** to Linux, what should i do to add it in the 
standard distribution?

ANSWER: Read first the previous Q/A, then to make something available to
others you have to post it (with cdiffs of the source, a short README)
in the incoming directory of one of nic,tupac,tsx-11, then drop
a short note to the list/group and to the site advisor.  
On nic    it's arl@sauna.cs.hut.fi (Ari Lemmke)
On tupac  it's blum@cip-s01.informatik.rwth-aachen.de (Robert Blum)
On tsx-11 it's ftp-linux@tsx-11.mit.edu (Ted Ts'o and Michael Johnson)


QUESTION: I want to port *** to Linux, what are the flags?

ANSWER: Recall that Linux implements subset of SYSV and POSIX, so
-DUSG and -DPOSIX work in general. Moreover throw away most of the ld
flags such as -ltermcap, -lg, since the libg.a and libtermcap.a are
missing.


QUESTION: Linux lacks on ****/ Linux has a bug in ***, what are the
rules to enhance/correct the kernel?

ANSWER: Before anything check if some one else is working on that
subject, contact those people, since end february a buglist (thanks to
Michael Johnson) is kept on the major sites. Test your improvment (it
should work is NOT enough), then send the patches in cdiffs form to
Linus and/or the list, moreover the localization must be clear. This
does NOT mean that bug-reports and patches are not accepted. Moreover,
you should sent a brief note to Michael: johnsonm@stolaf.edu


QUESTION: I seem to be unable to compile anything with gcc. Why?

ANSWER: If you have only 2 MB RAM, gcc will die silently without
compiling anything. You must have at least 4 MB to do compilations

BTW Since swapping is possible, I have heard that compilation works 
with only 2Meg and a lot disk traffic :) Isn't it great?


QUESTION: I'm using a program that uses signal handlers which are
installed using sigaction() with the SA_NOMASK, and they get a general
protection error right after the signal handler tries to return.
What's going wrong?

ANSWER: You are using a libc.a that has an out-of-date signal.o and
sig_restore.o file, and they don't know how to deal with SA_NOMASK.
(The one in gccbin.tar.Z is out-of-date). Get the new libc.a and put
it in /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib. Again check your compiler version


QUESTION: gcc complains about not finding crt0.o and the system
include files What am I doing wrong ?

ANSWER: The include files normal place is in /usr/include. lib*.a and
*.o should be in /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib


QUESTION: While compiling some GNU packages gcc chokes on regex.c with
an insn code, what can I do?

ANSWER: There is a little bug in the port of gcc-1.37, this will be
corrected on the port of v2.0 (with g++). Right now throw away the -O
flag (to compile regex) and every thing will be alright.

BTW there are some minor bugs with this release of gcc because it was
compiled under linux-0.10, whith odd libraries. These problems should 
have disappeared with the new gcc-1.40 package.

QUESTION: I tried to port a /new/ version of gnu stuff. But in the
linking phase, gcc complains about the missing libg.a. In fact it
depends on the gcc package you use.

ANSWER: Yes this is well known, throw away the flag -g that's all,
anyway libg.a is /only/ for debugging purpose.


QUESTION: What are the device minor/major numbers?

ANSWER: (early Linus mail Nov. 6th 91, last update Jan. 19th 92)
		Memory devices: Major = 1 (characted devices) minor
0	/dev/ram 
1	/dev/mem 
2	/dev/kmem - not implemented (easy, but I haven't done it) 
3	/dev/null 
4	/dev/port (implemented, but untested - don't play with it)

example: "mknod /dev/null c 1 3"


		Floppy disks: Major = 2 (block devices)

minor = drive + 4*type, drive = 0,1,2,3 for A,B,C or D-diskette

type	1: 360kB floppy in 360kB drive (5.25")
	2: 1.2M floppy in 1.2M drive (5.25")
	3: 360kB floppy in 720kB/1.44Mb drive (3.5")
	4: 720kB floppy in 720kB/1.44Mb drive (3.5")
	5: 360kB floppy in 1.2M drive (5.25")
	6: 720kB floppy in 1.2M drive (5.25")
	7: 1.44M floppy in 1.44M drive (3.5")

Thus minor nr for a 1.44Mb floppy in B is: 1 + 4*7 = 29, and to read
an old 360kB floppy in a 1.2M A-drive you need to use minor= 0 + 4*5 
= 20.

Example: "mknod /dev/PS0 b 2 28" (b for block: 2 for floppy, 28 for
1.44 in A)


		Hard disks: Major = 3 (block devices) minor
0	/dev/hda - The whole hd0, including partition table sectors
etc.  
1	/dev/hda1 - first partition on hd0 
....  
4	/dev/hda4 - fourth partition on hd0 
5	/dev/hda5 - Extended partition
64	/dev/hdb  - The whole hd1, again including partition table info 
65	/dev/hdb1 - first partition on hd1
....  
68	/dev/hdb4 - fourth partition on hd1
69	/dev/hdb5 - extended partition on hd1

NOTE! Be /very/ careful with /dev/hda and /dev/hdb - you seldom need
them, and if you write to them you can destroy the partition tables:
something you probably don't want.  The only things that use /dev/hda
are things like "fdisk" etc.

NOTE 2!! The names for hd's are no longer the same as under minix,
there is a straightforward correspondance, but I think
minix orders the partitions in some way (so that the partition numbers
will be in the same order as the partitions are physically on the
disk).  Linux doesn't order anything: it has the partitions in the
same order as in the partition table (ie /dev/hd?1 might be physically
after /dev/hd?2).

NOTE 3!! Extended partitions are recently detected, use them VERY VERY
carefully.

			Tty's: Major = 4 (character devices) minor
0	/dev/tty0 	- general console 1 -
63			- reserved for virtual console
64-127			- reserved for serial io
128-			- reserved for pty's

And more particularly we have: 
64	/dev/ttys1 	- com1
65	/dev/ttys2 	- com2
66	/dev/ttys3	- com3
67	/dev/ttys4	- com4


QUESTION: How to start Linux from drive B?

ANSWER: There is a DOS utility called boot_b.exe (look at DOS ftp).
Another simple way is to open the box and invert the cables.

QUESTION: The program boot_b works fine /but/ once the first disk is
read the system go back to the first drive, any hints?

ANSWER: Yes, change the bootimage in just the same way that you change
it to boot on the hard drive, execept that the major/minor pair is
different. All these information are in the file INSTALL-0.10.
Remember that if you use a sun or other endian machine, you will need
to reverse the byte order when you run the filter program (also in the
same file).


VII. FEATURES 

=============

QUESTION: I've read that linux has virtual consoles, what must I do to
get them?

ANSWER: Yes there are, you can access them with the left <alt>-key
together with <Fn>-key. With the Linux 0.95a Images distribution, 4
consoles are available, agetty runs on them. 

BTW: the serial ports are now /dev/ttys1 and /dev/ttys2. tty0 is the
general console. tty128- are reserved to pty's


QUESTION: What kind of shell is /bin/sh ?

ANSWER: Until v0.95 it's the Bourne Again Shell, bash-1.11 and 
compilation was straightforward (Linus dixit), just "make" 
that's all or nearly. But as the shell comes bigger and bigger the
v0.95a /bin/sh is ash the BSD 4.3 sh.
BTW I think that next time, it will be rc which is much more better
than ash and tiny wrt bash. If you want to test it, it's (at least) at
nic in /pub/unix/shells and the file is rc-1.2.tar.Z . The compilation
is straightforward (just a few things to modify in Makefile and
mksignal). 


QUESTION: Does there exist a man page for **** ?

ANSWER: Download man.tar.Z from your favorite linux ftp site, there is
most of the fileutils man page -- either **** or g****, example there
is nothing on ld, but there is for gld :) --, check the whatis
database provided. The files in the cat1 dir are pre-formatted man
pages that the man program can use.

BTW there is no roff,troff nor nroff for Linux. Cawf 2.0 works just
fine for simple man pages, and a partial ms support too. Quite
recently the port of groff has been done (due to gcc2.0 port), you can
found it (at least on tsx-11) in pub/linux/binaries/usr.bin/groff.

Moreover Michael Johnson is the coordinator for man pages under Linux,
he is looking for volunteers, so contact him (johnsonm@stolaf.edu).


QUESTION: What are the editors available in linux?

ANSWER: Right now there are uemacs, elvis-1.4, some one (R. Blum)
is working on some other vi clone. The port of emacs 18.57 has been
done by John T Kohl, files can be found at the different sites
at nic 		it's in the directory xtra
at tsx-11	it's in the directory ports/emacs-18.57.
Also the port of mg (micro gnu) has been done and can be found at
least at athos.rutgers.edu (128.6.4.4) in pub/linux, mg is the binary
and mg.tar.Z is the sources file. You can also find a PD ed, and elvis
has an ex mode.

QUESTION: Does there exist a printer package for Linux?

ANSWER: There are lp patches for linux.0.12, which implement a
parallel printer interface and feature a greatly improved driver
design. the patches are in lp.12.tar.Z As I have no printer (yet), I
don't know how good it is. There is nothing yet for 0.95(a), but I've
been told that the patch for v0.12 will fit the v0.95 and possibly the
0.95a. 


QUESTION: Does there exist a ps for Linux?

ANSWER: Yes, a very simple one is implemented by default, just press
the scroll-lock key; ctrl-shift-scrollock gives a kind of memory
status. There is also a much more complete ps/memory package it's
ps095.tar.Z. I have tested it, it's GREAT and well documented.


QUESTION: It's nice to have the df utility, but it would be nicer if
it would give statistics of the root file system. Would it be
difficult to do?

ANSWER: surely not, in your file /etc/rc, instead of the line
			> etc/mtab
put the following
		  	echo "/dev/hdX (root)" > /etc/mtab
where the X is the hard drive you use as root partition. 


QUESTION: How do I make swapping work?, when I boot I get the
following message: "Unable to get size of swap device"

ANSWER: Quite simply, you need the swapon and the mkswap binaries.
Then you can choose between a swap partition or a swap file


QUESTION: When I boot I get one of the following messages:
"Unable to find swap signature" or "Bad swap-space bitmap"

ANSWER: You probably forgot to make your swap-device, use the mkswap
command. 


QUESTION: How do I know if it is swapping?

ANSWER: You will notice it :)) First of all, Linux tells you at boot
time, "Adding swap: XXX pages of swap space", and if you start running
out of memory, you will notice that the disk will work overtime, and
things slow down. Generally a 2Meg RAM will make the system swap
constantly while running gcc, 4 Meg will swap occasionnaly when
optimizing big files (and having other things active, such as make).


QUESTION: How is it possible to remove a swap file?

ANSWER: Simply perform a rm on that file, and remove the swapon of
your /etc/rc file.


QUESTION: How is it possible to remove a swap device?

ANSWER: mkfs the device, and remove the swapon of your /etc/rc file.


QUESTION: Is there only the %$#@ keyboard ?

ANSWER: There are Dannish, Finnish, French, German, Uk and US
keyboards. Set it in linux/kernel/chr_drv/keyboard.S, then  
compile the kernel again.


QUESTION: (special FINNISH/US) I booteed up with the new image and
everything work except that some keyboard keys produce wrong
characters. Does anyone know what is happening?

ANSWER: images of 0.95a are US product (and so are US-keyboard
oriented), BUT linux sources are FINNISH product, and so the default
keyboard is set to be FINNISH. The solution is in the previous Q/A.


QUESTION: Does there exist shared libs ?

ANSWER: They seem to work. The kernel features are in Linux 0.12
already. 


QUESTION: Does Linux permit/support bitmapped graphics on vga/svga 
cards?

ANSWER: No, there is no interface for graphics operations on Linux
(yet). Some work has been done by Orest Zborowski (mmap/munmap, and
vga demonstration). The (un)mmap was patches for 0.12 kernel, but I've
been told that new versions (for 0.95a) will be out in a short while.

QUESTION: There are a lot of patches available (fd patch, lp patch
login patch ...) can I be fairly confident the subsequent patches will
work?

ANSWER: This is not true yet for the current version; but it will be
so I kept it :) 
No you can't, patching is a real beta tester art :)).  People are not
working on the same patched release, so you have to check if the
patches you already applied works on the same kernel part, if not,
/great/, just apply them. If yes, check if there is an order, patch
creator knows that, and (should) try to warn patch user (in other
words: beta tester) otherwise you should edit the patch files (and
possibly make a brief note to others on this list/newsgroup or even a
cdiff) before applying them, another solution is to keep cool and wait
for the next version of Linux where, in general, the modifications
have been done but this behavior is /not/ Linux helpful.


QUESTION: I got the patches on some ftp sites, and applied them to the
kernel and tried to compile. It didn't !!. Are the patches buggy?

ANSWER: Before remake, just do a make clean in the directories
involved by the patches. This will force a rebuild of the .o and .a
files. 
If you have a RCS running on your source tree, did you checked a
patched version of the files changed before /any/ CO either by you or
make

Finally, make sure the patches succeded. Normally, failed patches on a
file FILE will leave a FILE# file. Moreover you will get a "chunk
failed" message. It is possible to capture the output while patching:

	patch -p0 < patchfile | 2>&1 patch.result | more


VIII. MORE HINTS 
================ 

This part is recent and try to keep track of the different information
that appeared in alt.os.linux and on the list since beginning of
February. I tried to update it for v0.95(a), so there might be some
mistakes. Moreover take care to use the correct library and include
stuff, and the ad-hoc gcc you use !!!


QUESTION: How can I backup my Hd under Linux ?

ANSWER: I know at least two ways. One possibility is tar and mtools,
another possibility is the diskbackup/diskrestore of Diamano Bolla
(digest44 vol. #1) which saves big hd to floppies using the
stdin/stdout. These utilities have been uploaded to the major sites in
file disksplit.tar.Z.
An example usage (Roger Binns) is:

tar cvf - bin dev usr etc .. | compress | diskbackup

and to restore:

diskrestore | uncompress | tar xvf -


QUESTION: How to use setterm: for the novice?

ANSWER:The setterm utility provides access to most of Virtual Consoles
(VCs) functionality.  You can set your screen up to blank at 10
minutes using:
	        setterm -blank 10

You can set colors, and clear the screen.  For a full list of commands,
just type "setterm" with no arguments.
        
There are a few tricks with the screen dumper can really make VCs go a 
long way.  Here are a few of the common ones that I use:

		setterm dump

Dumps the contents of the current VC to screen.dump (in the current dir).
					
		setterm dump 4
				
Dumps the contents of VC 4 to screen.dump
		
		setterm -file mydumpfile -dump 4

Dump the contents of VC 4 to the file mydumpfile

		setterm -file /dev/tty0 -dump 4

Dumps the contents of VC 4 to the current VC.
					
		setterm -file /dev/tty4 -dump

Dumps the contents of the current VC to VC 4.
		
		setterm -file /dev/ttys1 -dump
				
Dumps the contents of the current VC to the serial port.
Handy if you are logged on and want to paste a screen full without
having to resort to doing a file transfer.

		setterm -file mydumpfile -append 4
				
Appends to instead of overwriting the dump file.  Useful if you
have several screens you wish to concatenate.


QUESTION: I've tried clear/reset, like most of unix but it doesn't
work, have I missed something?

ANSWER: setterm -clear or setterm -reset will solve your missing.  For
clear, you can also write a small script (which use the cl: part of
/etc/termcap wrt your TERM), or use bash where ctrl-l will do it for
you.


QUESTION: I know there are VC, but where is the setterm stuff?

ANSWER: It's in the current distribution (i.e. on the images), the
source can be found in virtcons.tar.Z at nic.


QUESTION: While using emacs in 80x25 mode, the mode line is constantly
moving around, why?

ANSWER: This appear to be a bug in the scroll region handling of the
console. I have not tested the new termcap but with the one for 0.12 I
use the following function.

	 e(){TERM=vt100; /usr/bin/emacs}


QUESTION: When I use make as non root, it doesn't work, why?

ANSWER: ?????, the message is either (null) setuid ..., or (null)
setgid... I don't know how to fix it. 
BTW This problem does not exist with the pmake (make for BSD 4.3 Reno
and BSD 4.4) package. 


QUESTION: How can I get Linux to boot directly from the harddisk?

ANSWER: Right now, this can be done via the shoelace stuff or the
bootany package. Quite recently a monitor program has been posted for
Minix, Michael is working on the port to Linux.


QUESTION: Sometimes, when I want to remove a directory, I get an error
message, is it a (known) bug?

ANSWER: No, There is no bug at all, you probaly have another shell 
on another VC whose working directory is either the one you try to 
remove, either a subdirectory of it.


QUESTION: can anyone give me a sample /etc/inittab entry for login
from a pc attached to serial line /dev/ttys2? 

ANSWER: "Humberto speaking :)"
First step up the modem to turn off echo and enable auto answer, I do
this in kermit by connecting to the modem and typing "ate0s0=1"
followed by enter (w/o quotes). Then setup inittab to spawn getty on
the modem
ttys2:console:/etc/agetty -m 1200 ttys2

Then it should work. Some modems can be permanently set to disable
echo and set auto answer, see your manual.

QUESTION: When compiling some code, cc1 complains about some insn
code, what's that? 

ANSWER: An insn is an internal representation that gcc uses when
compiling. The main part of gcc is to take ordinary c (or c++) code,
and compile it, while ding optimizations in insn part, which is
soft/hard independant. Then another part which is hard/Os dependant
takes the insns and translate it in assembly language. The fix is only
to turn off the optimization flag (-O) or download the new gcc release
(1.4) which has been made available at tsx-11 (newgcc.tar.Z and the
ad-hoc libraries newlibc.tar.Z).


QUESTION: While compiling some stuff, I'm getting the following 
error message:
Undefined symbol ___addsf3 referenced from text segment
as well as ___mulsf3 and __cmpsf2. 
These symbols are not in the program or in it's header files.

ANSWER: These are math helper functions, and you can usually compile
these programs to use the kernel floating point routines by adding
'-m80387' to the compiler switches. If the program does any wierd 
fp math (exp(), sin()) it'll die when you run it though.


QUESTION: What are the enhancement of the newgcc.tar.Z ?

ANSWER: There were some bugs in the old port that have been corrected, 
moreover this package contains 387 support 
there is libm.a (for those with 387)
	 libsoft.a (for those without, I for example)
	 libtermcap.a (from tput 1.10)

The -mstring-insns option is no longer needed nor supported :( [As
an example to recompile (successfully) linux0.12 you have to throw away 
this flag in all the Makefile]

gcc-1.40 has some registers problem, you should had -fcombine-regs
flag while compiling (the linux kernel for example)

BTW Notice also that include files have changed (stdio.h which is no 
more ansi compliant).


QUESTION What's about gcc2.0 ?

ANSWER: It has been ported to linux, but remember that gcc2.0 is an
ALPHA, it is not (yet) stable but it works. Anyway the files are
2lib.tar.Z and 2misc.tar.Z Uncompress and untar 2misc, read the FAQ
enclosed and play with it.  You can find these files at tsx-11 in
binaries/compilers/gcc-2.0.  In a short while gcc-2.1 will be out, and
will fix many problems.


QUESTION: What can gcc-2.0 do for me, that gcc-1.40 cannot?

ANSWER: Shared libraries: small programs shrink by an average factor
of 2~3, larger program by 50K. It also compiles C++, and so replace
both gcc-1.xx and g++1.xx

 
QUESTION: I've been trying to get Linux to run on my [3/4]86 box. It
can't even boot. Any suggestions?

ANSWER: The most common error/problem is writing the bootimage to a
low density disk. It fits, but the bootstrap code will only recognize
high density disk. So try to format explicitely disk as high density:
- for 3.5",  'format a: /n:18 /t:80 '
- for 5.25", 'format a: /n:15 /t:80 '


QUESTION: Does there exist games, languages (other than C), and
anything which make the system more friendly?

ANSWER: Yes, among other things there are rogue and yatzee; TeX;
Prolog.. but in general, if you want some extra tool port it to Linux
this is also a good beta-testing exercice.


QUESTION: Could someone explain how to use rawrite?

ANSWER: Well, rawrite is a DOS util, which write sequential sector of
a formatted disk/floppy. When a floppy has been rawritten, you can
(under Linux), mount and untar it (only use x, v and f flags). Do not 
rawrite compressed files.

QUESTION: Does emacs handle the arrows-key

ANSWER: Yes it does, one simple way is to put some elisp code in your
..emacs, this is an except of mine:

(global-unset-key "\e[")
(setq esc-c-map(make-keymap))
(fset 'esc-c-prefix esc-c-map)
(define-key global-map "\e[" 'esc-c-prefix)
(define-key global-map "\e[B" 'next-line)
(define-key global-map "\e[A" 'previous-line)
(define-key global-map "\e[C" 'forward-char)
(define-key global-map "\e[D" 'backward-char)

The keycode was obtained by ^Q followed by the key


QUESTION: Whenever I use uemacs 3.1X on a symlink, the symlink does
not exist anymore, why?

ANSWER: (Tristram Mabbs) Since ue3.10, uemacs uses 'safe save' mode,
writing the file to a temporary and moving it OVER the original. In
the process, this deletes the original. To prevent this just add the
following in your emacs '.rc' file: set $ssave FALSE


QUESTION: Uemacs doesn't work anymore with 0.95a, whenever I want to
save a file; what can I do?

ANSWER: ^S and ^Q are used for flow control. One solution is ^X^W
followed by the	filename, or M-X save-file. Another possibility, 
if you have download the stty.tar.Z file, is to do stty -IXON 
before you first use uemacs (this can be included in your .profile).
And the last is to recompile the Peter Orbaek init-1.2 package.


QUESTION: I have an SVGA, but Linux detect an EGAc/EGAm; is it normal?

ANSWER: (Jim Winstead) This is correct actually. You have an EGA+ card
(SVGA) with a Color/Mono monitor. The only four possibilties are EGAc,
EGAm, *MDA and *CGA (according to the code in
kernel/chr_drv/console.c).
The true test, if Linux detects your video card, is if you press
<RETURN> at the "Press <RETURN> to see SVGA- ..." boot-time message.
If you have a SVGA  recognized card, it will ask you to choose a
screen size. If not detected, the default is 80x50 mode. 
BTW if you have no SVGA, press the <space> and you are in 80x25 mode.

I think the point here is that Richard Stallman is not on the poverty
line himself and he does get paid for working. He's quite happy to have
Cygnus provide the service they do because it's no skin off his nose if
other people also get paid for working on free software. 

However, the sentiments of many people working on Linux are
understandably quite different. They get no financial benefits out of
Linux and are working on it for fun and because it's a worthwhile
project. If all you intend to do is provide a service and make a little
money on the side then that's in this spirit. However, when you say
things like, "can I make a living out of this" and the such like then
their reaction is, not surprisingly, "why should I give my free time so
that someone else can get rich". This is basically exploitation of others
good intentions.

If you are just going to make a little extra money providing a service
to those without easy access to Linux, then good luck. If you intend
making a living off the backs of others then you deserve what you get.
This is certainly not in the spirit of the GPL.

|

The above sounds like something from AT&T. If we can't make any money
from it then why bother. People have to live but the whole point of the
free software is that software development should not be guided by
profit but by the need for it.

I think the harsh words of those who are against your aims are due to
their reluctance to spend all their extra hours working on Linux, while
you get rich and they stay poor. Remember, many of those working on
linux are doing so because they can't afford to spend money on software
i.e. they are NOT rich.


Well, those are my thoughts on the matter.

I'm personally in favor of the SCO XENIX (/UNIX?) standard of naming
console screens as tty01, tty02,..., tty12; direct-connect terminals as
tty1a, tty1b, tty2a; serial-connect terminals as tty1A, tty1B, tty2A
(where the number represents the physical card and the letter represents
the port on that card.  For normal 2-ports-per-serial-card, this means
that COM1 and COM2 are tty1a and tty1b, and COM3 and COM4 are tty2a and
tty2b.  For a multi-port serial card this means that you have tty1a
through tty1h.); pseudo-terminals are ttyp0-ttypf, ttyq0-ttyqf, etc.

Well, from my experiences with various flavors of Unix, i've grown to 
like my own naming scheme. (Everyone's gotta have their own). I use these
whenever I build device names.
tty01, tty02,...,ttyXX  for consoles, local terminals, and the like.
	(I.E. Anything thats directly connected to the system)
ttyM01, ttyM02, ...ttyMXX for modems, remote terminals, etc, and so forth.
ttyP01, ttyP02,...ttyPXX for psuedo-terminals (or pty01, pty02...)
ttyL01, ttyL02,...ttyLXX for printers and other ouput devices.

I'm odd.. I don't want the device name to tell me what it refers to in the
hardware; I only need to know that during installation. I want the device
names to tell me what the device is DOING for me.

   Dunno, sounds like a bug unless you have "x" access, in which case being
   able to cd but unable to ls is the correct behavior.


right.  this would be a bug if they don't have search access to the
directory.  cd should be a shell internal function which just calls
the system routine chdir.

here is the pertinent manual entry from sunos, which i assume is close
to the standard.

CHDIR(2V)                 SYSTEM CALLS                  CHDIR(2V)

NAME
     chdir - change current working directory

SYNOPSIS
     int chdir(path)
     char *path;

     int fchdir(fd)
     int fd;

DESCRIPTION
     chdir() and fchdir() make the directory specified by path or
     fd  the current working directory.  Subsequent references to
     pathnames not starting with `/'  are  relative  to  the  new
     current working directory.

     In order for a directory to become the current directory,  a
     process must have execute (search) access to the directory.

RETURN VALUES
     chdir() returns:

     0    on success.

     -1   on failure and sets errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     EACCES              Search permission is denied for  a  com-
                         ponent of the pathname.

     ENAMETOOLONG        The length of the path argument  exceeds
                         {PATH_MAX}.

                         A  pathname  component  is  longer  than
                         {NAME_MAX} while {_POSIX_NO_TRUNC} is in
                         effect (see pathconf(2V)).

     ENOENT              The named directory does not exist.

     ENOTDIR             A component of the  pathname  is  not  a
                         directory.

SYSTEM V ERRORS
     In addition to the above, the following may also occur:

     ENOENT              path points to an empty string.

WARNINGS
     fchdir() is provided as a  performance  enhancement  and  is
     guaranteed to fail under certain conditions.  In particular,
     if auditing is active the call will never succeed, and  EIN-
     VAL  will  be  returned.  Applications which use this system

CHDIR(2V)                 SYSTEM CALLS                  CHDIR(2V)

     call must be coded to detect  this  failure  and  switch  to
     using chdir() from that point on.

Hi Linuxers!
Back (again), I've corrected some bugs (minor/major nums). Added
information on boot-floppy and a few other things

======


The originall FAQ 1st version was posted in Dec. 19, by Robert Blum,

Most credits of this work to Linus, Robert and Ted, the rest was
either on the list posted by many (real) activists, not me ;-), either
in some other news groups, or else by direct posting to me (thanks
Humberto, Dan, Michael, Drew). I haven't systematically copyrighted
them, so thanks to every one who participated even indirectly to this
FAQ. 

[The last-change-date of this posting is always "two minutes ago".  :-)]

This is the introduction to a list of frequently asked questions (FAQ
for short) about Linux with answers (Yeap!).  This article contains a
listing of the sections, followed by the question/answer part.

This FAQ is supposed to reduce the noise level ;-) in the alt.os.linux
newsgroup (and also the 'linux-activists' mailing list), and spare the
time of many activists. I will post it twice a month, since there are
more and more new incomers, and new features.

BTW I think this FAQ should be available at the main Linux sites in
the doc directory (have you read this Ari, Robert, Ted/Michael ?). So
I will send a copy to the main sites.

Please suggest any change, rephrasing, deletions, new questions,
answers ...  
Please include "FAQ" in the subject of messages sent to me about FAQ.  
Please use corsini@labri.greco-prog.fr whatever will be the From part 
of this message.


Thanks in advance,
				Marc <corsini@labri.greco-prog.fr>

Future Plan:
	- verification/location/organization for files available 
	via FTP (I've tried what a mess!!)
	- cross posting this to news.answers as soon as comp.os.linux 
	is created.
	- reorganization of the FAQ. I don't know how, but I feel it's
	needed, any help appreciated.

I. LINUX GENERAL INFORMATION 
=============================

QUESTION: What is linux?

ANSWER: Linux is a small unix for 386-AT computers, that has the added
advantage of being free. It is still in beta-testing, but is slowly
getting useful even for somewhat real developement.  The current
version is 0.95a, date: March 17th 1992. The previous version v0.95
(March 7th) had some bugs, please do not use it anymore.


   Linux 0.95(a) is a freely distributable UNIX clone.  It implements a
subset of System V and POSIX functionality.  LINUX has been written
from scratch, and therefore does not contain any AT&T or MINIX
code--not in the kernel, the compiler, the utilities, or the
libraries.  For this reason it can be made available with the complete
source code via anonymous FTP.  LINUX runs only on 386/486 AT-bus
machines; porting to non-Intel architectures is likely to be
difficult, as the kernel makes extensive use of 386 memory management
and task primitives.


QUESTION: What is the current state of Linux?

ANSWER: do "finger torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi", or read the
alt.os.linux newsgroup.


QUESTION: I've just heard about linux, what should I do to get it?

ANSWER: First read all this FAQ, and the INFO-SHEET monthly post, then
go to the nearest ftp site (see below), download the Images there are
two a rootimage and a bootimage (in general in the images directory),
download the INSTALL and RELNOTES files.  Find the rawrite utility
(for example at tsx-11 it's in /pub/linux/INSTALL), then rawrite the
images on HIGH density floppies (5.25 or 3.5), finally boot on the
root diskette and that's it.
BTW From another Unix system a "dd" works fine.

After playing a while, you should want to install linux on HD (there
are scripts on the v0.95a images for that purpose), see also section
III for INSTALLATION. Then you will need
a compiler (gcc) and utilities, all can be found at the different
places described in section II below.


QUESTION: Does it run on my computer?

ANSWER: Linux has been written on a clone-386, with IDE drives and a
VGA screen. It should work on most similar setups. The harddisk should
be AT-standard, and the system must be ISA.  A high density floppy
drive -- either 5".25 or 3".5

IDE and MFM seem to work with no problem. It works, also, for some
ESDI drive (Joincom controller with Magtron drive after you have
commented out the "unexpected hd interrupt"-message from hd.c). There
exists a high-level SCSI driver, under which low-level drivers are
placed; a ST-01/ST-02 low driver has been completed

Otherwise the requirements seem relatively small: a 386 (SX, DX or any
486).  Any video card of the following: Hercules, CGA, EGA, (S)VGA.

It needs at least 2M to run, and 4M is definitely a plus. It can
happily use up to 16M (and more if you change some things). 


QUESTION: Why the suggested 4Meg, for Linux?

ANSWER: Linux uses the first 640k for kernel text, kernel data and
buffercache. Your mother board may eat up 384K because of the chipset.
Moreover there is: init/login, a shell, update possibly other daemons.
Then, while compiling there is make and gcc (1.39 ~400k; 2.00 ~700k).
So you don't have enough real memory and have to page.


QUESTION: How would this operate in an OS/2 environment?

ANSWER: Fine.


QUESTION: Will linux run on a PC or 286-AT? If not, why?

ANSWER: Linux uses the 386 chip protected mode functions extensively,
and is a true 32-bit operating system. Thus x86 chips, x<3, will
simply not run it.


QUESTION: Will Linux run on a 386 Laptop?

ANSWER: It works for some at least.


QUESTION: How big is the 'complete' Linux package?

ANSWER: Well, the boot and root image diskettes are about 750k
compressed.  The kernel sources are about 200k compressed, and the
libc sources are another 170k compressed.  The GNU C compiler is 670k,
and the other miscellaneous unix utilities are probably a bit over a
megabyte.

Now add sources to whatever you want to port and compile yourself.
The sources to GNU emacs are about 3 megabytes, compressed.  Groff (a
troff replacement) is just over 1 megabyte.

If you think this is big, remember that the OS/2 2.0 Limited
Availability release is 20 1.44 megabyte diskettes.


QUESTION: (Dan) How long has Linux been publicly available?

ANSWER (partial): Few months, v0.10 went out in Nov. 91, v0.11 in Dec.
and the current version 0.95a is available since March 17th 92. But even
it is pretty recent it is quite reliable. There are very few and small
bugs and in its current state it is mostly useful for people who are
willing to port code and write new code.
As Linux is very close to a reliable/stable system, Linus decides that
v0.13 will be known as v0.95

QUESTION: What's about the copyright of linux.

ANSWER: This is an except of the RELEASE Notes v.095a: Linux-0.95a is
NOT public domain software, but is copyrighted by Linus Torvalds. The
copyright conditions are the same as those imposed by the GNU
copyleft: get a copy of the GNU copyleft at any major ftp-site (if it
carries linux, it probably carries a lot of GNU software anyway, and
they all contain the copyright).


QUESTION: Should I be a UNIX and/or a DOS wizard to install/use Linux?

ANSWER: Not at all, just follow the install rules, of course it will be
easier for you if you know things about Unix. Right now Linux is used
by more than 400 persons, very few of them enhance the kernel, some
adds/ports new soft, most of us are only (but USEFUL) beta testers.
Last but not least, various Linuxers work on manpages, newuser_help,
file-system organization. So join us and choose your "caste"


QUESTION: What are the differences, pros and cons compared to Minix ?

ANSWER (partial): 
Cons: 
- Linux is not as mature as Minix, there is less working software right now.  
- Linux only works on 386 and 486 processors.  
- Linux needs 2M of memory just to run, 4M to be useful.  
- Linux is a more traditional unix kernel, it doesn't use message passing.

Pros: 
- Linux is free, and freely distributable, BUT copyrighted.  
- Linux has some advanced features such as:
  - Memory paging with copy-on-write
  - Demand loading of executables
  - Page sharing of executables
  - Multi-threaded file system
  - job control and virtual memory, virtual consoles and pseudo-ttys.
- Linux is a more traditional unix kernel, it doesn't use message
passing.


QUESTION: Does Linux use TSS segments to provide multitasking?

ANSWER: Yes!


QUESTION: If my PC runs under Linux, is it possible to ftp, rlogin,
rsh etc.. to other Unix boxes?

ANSWER: Not yet, but kermit has been ported to Linux, and the ka9q too.


QUESTION: Does linux do paging? Can I have virtual memory on my small
machine?

ANSWER: Linux0.95(a) does do paging in a better way than Linux0.12.


QUESTION: Can I have tasks spanning the full 4GB of addressable 386
memory? No more 64kB limits like in coherent or standard minix?

ANSWER: Linux does limit the task-size, but at a much more reasonable
64MB (MEGA-byte, not kilos), so bigger programs are no problem.


QUESTION: Does the bigger program sizes mean I can run X?

ANSWER: X is not (yet) ported to linux, and I hope it will be some day,
people are working hard on it but it's big, and wants a lot from
the system.


II. LINUX USEFUL ADRESSES 
=========================

QUESTION: Where can I get linux?

ANSWER: Linux can be gotten by anonymous ftp from
	nic.funet.fi (128.214.6.100):
		directory /pub/OS/Linux
	Tupac-Amaru.Informatik.RWTH-Aachen.DE (137.226.112.31):
		directory /pub/msdos/replace
	tsx-11.mit.edu (18.172.1.2):
		directory /pub/linux
	ftp.eecs.umich.edu (141.212.99.7):
		directory linux
        src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7):
		directory /pub/os/Linux
	hpb.mcc.ac.uk (130.88.200.7):
		directory pub/linux
	ustsun.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp (133.11.11.11):
		directory misc/linux
	banjo.concert.net (192.101.21.6):
		directory pub/Linux/mirrors

You might want to check out which of these is the most up-to-date.

If you don't have ftp-capability, you are in trouble. See next Q/A.  If
you have no uncompress utility, there are a lot even for DOS, have a
look on SIMTEL, or else use facilities provided by some sites to
uncompress for you. Don't do that if you can, because it's lengthy,
expensive and causes troubles to other users on ftp sites.


QUESTION: I do not have FTP access, what can I do to get linux?

ANSWER: Try to contact a friend on the net with those access, or try
mailserver/ftpmail server otherwise contact tytso@ATHENA.MIT.EDU. You
might try mailing "mailserver@nic.funet.fi" with "help" in the body of
the mail.  If you choose ftpmail server (example: ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com),
with "help" in the body, the server will send back instructions and
command list. As an exemple to get the list of files available at tsx-11
in /pub/linux send:

		mail ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
		subject: anything
		reply <your e-mail>
		connect tsx-11.mit.edu
		chdir /pub/linux
		dir -R
		quit

QUESTION: Is there a newsgroup or mailing-list about linux? Where can
I get my questions answered? How about bug-reports?

ANSWER: alt.os.linux is formed, and comp.os.linux is on the way, for
those who can't access to the news you can ask for digest to:
Linux-Activists-request@NEWS-DIGESTS.MIT.EDU. On the other hand, mail
sent to Linux-Activists@NEWS-DIGESTS.MIT.EDU are posted to
alt.os.linux

DO NOT mail "I want to [un]subscribe" to the newsgroup, use
the request-address. IF not your mail-box will be over-crowded by
activists.

Questions and bug-reports can be sent either to the newsgroup or to
"torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi", depending on which you find more
appropriate. Moreover there is a BUGLIST file available in the
different main site (at least you can find it at tsx-11, in
pub/linux/patches/BUGLIST). 

BTW People are working on the organization of Linux, this is done on
a separate mailing-list.

linux-standards: Discussion of distribution and directory standards
for the Linux operating system, including directory structure, file
location, and release disk format.

Requests to be added to this list must be sent to:
	      linux-standards-request@banjo.concert.net

QUESTION: Does there exist a place where the traffic of the newsgroup
is kept?

ANSWER: Yes, on nic and tsx-11 (see the ftp adresses above), and since
12th March, a Gopher server is up at beryl.daimi.aau.dk
(130.225.16.86). The archives go back to Nov. 18. 91

III. INSTALLATION and SECURITY 
==============================


QUESTION: I have copyed all the rootimage stuff on my HD, how can I
use the hard-disk as root?

ANSWER: There are two ways to answer this:
a) You have download the linux sources and a compiler, in that case
recompile the kernel to make a new boot-floppy according to your
environment. Just have a look in the main Makefile and in
kernel/chr_drv/keyboard.S (notice .S not .s) to set your national
keyboard. 
b) You have nothing except the images and DOS, in that case you should
have read the INSTALLATION notices provided at your ftp site, but well:
You have to change the boot image at offset 508. The word (in
386-order, i.e low-byte first) tells the system which device to use as
root: initially it's 0 which means that we want to use a floppy of the
same type as the boot-disk (this is the reason why HIGH density
floppy is required for the boot-image).
In order to use the HD as root, this value has to be changed to point
to the correct device. For that purpose you can download the program
enclosed in INSTALL-0.10 (provided some slight modification according
to the new minor/major numbers) use the program written by Henning
Spruth wich can be found in digest#149 vol1 (there are both the C code
and the uuencoded DOS executable) or else any sector editor.

QUESTION: How can I be sure I won't be writing over anything
important?  I have to use DOS on my machine, and I don't want to
lose any files.

ANSWER: Back up everything. Just in case. Then, write some easily
recognizable pattern to the partition you have reserved for linux,
using some DOS tool. You can then use "cat /dev/hdX" under linux to
examine which of the partitions you used.


QUESTION: Linux mkfs doesn't accept the size I give the device,
although I double-checked with fdisk, and it's correct.

ANSWER: Be sure you give the size in BLOCKS, ie 1024 bytes, not
sectors. The mkfs doesn't work for very big partition (over than 64
Megs). Also, make doubly certain that you have the correct partition.

There are a few rules about this: /dev/hda (under linux0.95a) corresponds
to /dev/hd0 (under minix) and /dev/hdb (linux0.95a) to /dev/hd5
(minix).  DO NOT USE THEM, they are the whole raw
disk, not partitions. Also if a partition is on drive 1 under minix
(ie /dev/hd1-4), it is drive 1 under linux as well.  Moreover, there
is no real consensus on whether partition #1 is the first partition on
the disk, or is the first entry in the partition table.  Some parition
programs sort this information on the screen only, some will write the
sorted information back to the hard disk.  Linux assumes that the
first entry is hda1, and so if some utility starts sorting/reordering
the table these things can change.  Moreover, use very carefully extended
partition they are still in beta-test (this is in the installation notes). 

REMARK Minix does some reordering.

A useful hack is to make each of your partitions a different size.
Then after any editting or possible change to the partition table you
can boot a floppy system and run fdisk (linux's, not DOS) to see if
the assignments still hold.


QUESTION: I have a one partitionned 40Mb disk. If I run mkfs, what
happens?

ANSWER: If you do that, you will have an empty 40Mb Linux file system.
You should, at least, make on your hard disk, one partition per
operating system you want to use. 


QUESTION: I mounted the linux filesystem, and copied the files from
the root-disk to the harddisk. Now I cannot find them any more, and
somethimes linux dies with a "panic: trying to free unused inode".

ANSWER: You have probably forgot to sync before rebooting. Linux, like
all unices, use a "buffer cache" to speed up reads and writes to disk.
On a machine that has enough memory, this buffer-cache is 1.5MB, and
if you forget to sync before exiting, it may not be fully written out
to disk. Re-mkfs and re-install (or try to use the preliminary fsck,
but remember that although fsck tries to correct the faults it finds,
it may fail.)


IV. LINUX and DOS 
=================

QUESTION: Is it possible to access to DOS world from Linux

ANSWER: Yes, there is the mtools package (with patches for devices.c)
The original sources of mtools can be found at any places not only at
nic, tupac and tsx-11, and the patches for Linux (with fix for big DOS
partitions are in the directory patches or ports). Moreover you should
download the file patch.Z to apply patches :)
It is possible to find the compiled mtools stuff at mcc (see above for
the adress)


QUESTION: the mtools package won't work. I get an ENOENT error message
for all devices.

ANSWER: mtools needs to be told which device to look for. Use 'ln' or
'mknod' to create a special file called "/dev/dosX", where X is A, B,
C, X or Y. A and B are for floppies (12 bits), C is for hard disk and
X, Y for any. This file should point to the device you want to read.
About the minor/major pair have a look in section INSTALLATION HINTS.


QUESTION: What is as86.tar.Z ?

ANSWER: It's the port of Bruce Evans' minix assembler, you need it to 
be able to recompile Linux at your convenience. In fact this is only
used for boot/setup.s and boot/bootsect.s
BTW as86 should not work on keyboard.S, instead, you must use gcc -E
and then (g)as.


QUESTION: Turbo (Microsoft) Assembler won't compile the Linux boot
code.  In fact, some of the opcodes in these files look completely
unfamiliar.  Why?

ANSWER: The Linux boot codes are written in Bruce Evans' minix
assembler, which has the same opcodes as the original minix assembler
ported to linux get as86.tar.Z Anyway there are a few differences
between these and normal DOS assemblers:

 - No segments - everything is in the same segment (at least in the
   bootsectors and setup, as they don't use the .data segments)

 - mov[b|w|l] are shorter versions of mov ax,[byte|word|long] ptr
[XXX].
   This is how unix assemblers normally give the size (byte, word or
long).
   Gas has similar constructs.

 - There is no "jmp short", the opcodes are "j" for a short jump and
   "jmp" for a long one.

 - "jmpi" is a jump with a segment:offset pair. I don't know how this
is
   written in DOS assembly.


V. SOME CLASSICAL PROBLEMS 
==========================

QUESTION: While running du I get "Kernel panic: free_inode: bit
already cleared".  Also, du produces a ENOENT error for all the files
in certain of my directories.  What's going on?

ANSWER: These are both consistent with a bad file-system.  That's
relatively easy to produce by not syncing before rebooting, as linux
usually has 1.5MB of buffer space held in memory (unless you have <=4M
RAM, in which case the buffers are only about 0.5MB). Also linux
doesn't do anything special about the bit-map blocks, and as they are
used often, those are the thing most likely to be in memory. If you
reboot, and they haven't been written to disk ...

Just do an fsck on the device, the -a flag might repair it otherwise,
the only thing to do is to reinstall the filesystem from the Images.

A sync is done only every 30 seconds normally (standard unix
practice), so do one by hand (some people think you should do 3 syncs
after each other, but that's superstition), or by logging out from the
startup-shell, which automatically syncs the system. Unmounting a
filesystem also syncs it (but of course you can never unmount root).

Another (sad) possibility is that you have bad blocks on your disk.
Not very probable, as they would have to be in the inode-tables, just
a couple of blocks in size. Again there aren't programs available to
read a disk for bad sectors and put them in some kind of
"bad-sector-file".  On IDE drives this is no problem (bad sectors are
automatically mapped away).


QUESTION: How can I partition my hard-drive to use Linux?

ANSWER: There are (at least) two ways to answer this. The easy way is
probably to use a program which will do it for you, such as the MS-DOS
fdisk, Minix fdisk, Xenix/Unix fdisk, or programs such as edpart.exe 
or part.exe.

On the other hand, you can use a disk editor and modify the contents
of the partition table directly. This has been already done, and an
extensive explanatory note can be found in the mailing-list archives 
(25th Jan. 92). You must also edit the bpb on the Dos partition you
are shrinking, otherwise Dos will step on Linux.

BTW It might be useful to set three (3) separated partitions for
Linux, one for the root, another one for the usr and a third one for
swap, as an illustration, my root partition is 10Meg, the usr is 22Meg
and the swap partition is 8Meg (twice the size of RAM on my box). As 
an experience I have used MS-DOS fdisk to partition my two hd and got 
no peculiar difficulties.
You can, as long as you stay within the 64MB per filesystem
limit, have swap, root, etc, ... all on there.

QUESTION: What must I do to mkfs a floppy?

ANSWER: blocks are of size 1K so 1.44 floppy is 1440 blocks. The
floppy has to be formatted before this will work.


QUESTION: When I run kermit under Linux, I get "Warning, Read access
to lock directory denied". What am I doing wrong?

ANSWER: Nothing, you just need to create /usr/spool/uucp, which is
where kermit like to lock files.


QUESTION: du seems buggy when i used it the number of disk occupation
is wrong.

ANSWER: Take care, if you want size in kbytes use the -k flags.


QUESTION: du works just fine on directories, except on / and /dev,
moreover "ls -l" returns either big or negative number on /dev. Why?

ANSWER: This is a "feature" added in Linux 0.12; it was originally
present in Minix; more specifically, when you stat a device file
belong to a block device, it will return the maximum size of the block
device in the st_size member of the stat structure. If you don't like
it, it's very simple to patch it out. Look in the fs/inode.c, in the
subroutine read_inode().


QUESTION: When I try to (un)compress many files in one command, the
command partially fails?

ANSWER: This is a bug, many partial fixes are floating around but ..
You can solve it by a bash command "for i in whateverfiles;do 
compress $i; done". Another possibility is to download the
compress-fixed.tar file.


QUESTION: I can do this as root but not as non-root, is it a bug?

ANSWER: Except for the make utility, the problem is caused by an
incorrect permission flag. The most common problems are about /tmp
which should be 777 and /dev/ttys? which might be 766. So as root do

	chmod 777 /tmp ; chmod 766 /dev/ttys?


QUESTION Sometimes, I get "mount can't open lock file"; what does this
means? 

ANSWER: This can happened for two reasons: 
A) You try to mount something as non-root. In that case you can either
retry as root, or set the setuid bit to mount.
B) You are root. mount wants to open /etc/mtab and /etc/mtab~ - the
first one for reading, the second as lock file. If there is already a
mtab~ remove it. This can happen if you used once gnuemacs on mtab.

I personally have no problem with people profiting from distribution of free
software as long as it is done honestly (this is what the GPL tries to
insure). Unfortunitly not everyone has net access and you can't expect
people to put out the effort to mail out thousands of copies of Linux
without earning something for it.

I do some consulting work in addition to my part time job at WPI. So far
I've had to do it all in DOS (YUCK!!!), the main reason is that its hard to
convince a customer to shell out $1000 for Sys V to run a mailing list.
Fortunitly I have access to Linux from the net, but there are many people
who could make use of Linux who don't have this good fortune. Please don't
pretend Linux is just a toy, once it has network and X support it will be
the best PC operating system available. Lets make sure people can use it
instead of just a small cult of those fortunite enough to have ftp access.
Some day you will be thankful that you can write in a real OS rather than a
microsoft excretion.

While not distributers arn't legally obligated to do so I think it is only
fair that some of the profits earned from distributing linux go back into
improving it.

   However, the sentiments of many people working on Linux are
   understandably quite different. They get no financial benefits out of
   Linux and are working on it for fun and because it's a worthwhile
   project. If all you intend to do is provide a service and make a little
   money on the side then that's in this spirit. However, when you say
   things like, "can I make a living out of this" and the such like then
   their reaction is, not surprisingly, "why should I give my free time so
   that someone else can get rich". This is basically exploitation of others
   good intentions.

Hmm... well, my reaction is that it doesn't make any difference if
someone tries to make a buck off of Linux, since the GPL states that
when something is distributed under the GPL, (1) the GPL must included
as part of the distribution, in an obvious place, and (2) either the
source must be included or a pointer to a place where the source can be
made freely available.  So anyone who gets pays $1000 for Linux will be
immediately treated to the obvious fact that they can give it away to
anybody they want.  I find it very doubtful that anyone would be able to
"make a living out of this" under these circumstances.

Also, if there are really stupid people out there paying $1000/copy for
Linux, you can be sure that I and several other people will immediately
go out there and offer to sell copies of Linux for $500/copy, and then
$100/copy, and then $20/copy..... and pretty soon the free market will
take care of driving the price to "natural" levels.

I really don't see the big deal and fuss.... the GPL is designed so no
one will be able to make outrageous amounts of money over the mere
distribution of the software.  Support?  That's a different matter; but
if you are selling support, (like Cygnus), you need to put in a lot more
effort yourself --- it's not like you're just mooching off the efforts
of other people.

This isn't the most elegant solution, but is the one involving the

Well, since it has been a slow day and I have been frustrated at
trying to get version 0.95a up and running, I decided to try an
experiment.  (All of this has happened since my last post).  First, I
found the post by Iain Reid and followed it to the letter.  No luck,
0.95a still would not mkfs on my d: drive.

Since that didn't work, I retreived the 0.12 images, booted under
that, and created a file system on my d: drive.  No problems at all
were encountered.  So, I now have a working 0.12 linux system.  Then,
I rebooted using the 0.95a bootimage and rootimage.  This is a literal
transcription of what occurred:

	<After Loading........ etc. and SVGA prompt>

At this point I figured I'd better quit.  But, just to make sure, I
rebooted from my 0.12 bootimage disk and, lo and behold, I have a
working filesytem on /dev/hd6 (which, if I am not mistaken is the same
as /dev/hdb1).

As I mentioned before, the disk I am trying to install to is a Seagate
ST251-1 IDE drive (~40M).  Running Norton disk test on it reveals no
errors, it has worked fine as a DOS disk for 2 years, it is currently
working fine as a linux 0.12 disk, BUT linux 0.95a seems to want
nothing to do with it.  What gives???

As before, any help will be greatly appreciated.  I'm at a complete
loss here.

Thanks,

Is anyone working on support for Adaptec SCSI controllers? Particularly

disks, but of course it can't see my disk. 386BSD has failed to come up
on any of 7 different machines so far. Of course it doesn't have SCSI
support either, so I guess I am stuck with OS/2 2.0 (At least it has
Adaptec support :-)

I think it is a little unfair to see things quite like this.  First
of all, Linux has 14 character file names.  Secondly, this is not
because Linus wanted Linux to have 14 character file names, but
because the Linux file system is inherited from an older system
with which it had to be compatible.  Thirdly, work is in progress
on a new file system for Linux which is not subject to this limitation.
And finally, note that the 14 character file name limit is the one
specified by the current Posix standard (which, however, allows
a conforming system to permit longer file names).

This may have resulted from giving 'mount' the wrong device --
/dev/PS0 for 3.5 inch 1.44 Mb disk on your A drive, /dev/at1 for
5.25 inch 1.20 Mb disk on your B drive.  Horrible, but likely to

In this case, I prefer Linux's behaviour to BSD's.  I suppose one could
rewrite the mount system call to unmount anything mounted on an existing
mount point, but all sorts of things become problems (i.e., the cwd
of all existing processes, log files being written, files like /etc/mtab
that contain information which should not be lost, etc).  The unixes
I know do not allow this, but I have the (adjective deleted) fortune
not to have any BSD systems to manage.

According to bash documentation, the .bashrc and .bash_profile files are
sourced only if bash is not called sh, and in the latter case, if bash
is executed as a login file.  The version of doshell.c published in
this list starts up bash (or any shell) with a '-' at the start.
Anyway, if it is named 'sh', a bash login shell reads the file ~/.profile.
Either use that or link /bin/sh to /bin/bash.

I have a DTK 386-20 mother board.  I haven't had any problems with the  
board or linux not working with the board.  I have been running linux  
since January.

	I don't know what high I/O rates are, but I have run a serial  
network at over 56k baud on my board under DOS.  If the high I/O rates  
refer to drive access, then I do have a slow drive.   :-(

Hi,

I am the guy who ported gcc 2.0 to Linux. During the porting, I
rearranged the libc.a. I included glibc.a, libg++.a and some functions
from poeigl-1.2. The libc.a come with gcc 2.0 is almost totally new.
The shared libraries are also in gcc 2.0.

Gcc 2.0 is now in the very late alpha testing. There are some bugs in
libc.a. I hope the number of bugs can be reduced to a tolerable level
after the alpha testing. After that, I will release all the source
codes for libc.a and patches for gcc 2.0. I have submitted my patches
for gcc 2.0. I hope it will be in gcc 2.1. It may be too late for that.

If you want to test gcc 2.0, please drop me a note. Be prepared to ftp
a new release every one or two days, even twice a day. That is what
happened during the early stage of the alpha testing. Now it is quite
stable.

I am enclosing the part of FAQ for 2.0.

I just got gcc 2.1. The next testing release may be 2.1.


H.J.
-----------FAQ-------------
QUESTION: What are the main differences with the old release?

ANSWER: Here are the features.

1. gcc and g++ are in one.

2. ANSI and BSD 4.4 compatible stdio.

3. iostream for g++. It has

* Full implementation of ANSI C stdio.
* Full implementation of the streambuf layer of AT&T's
  iostream library for C++.
* Full compatibility between stdio and streambufs.

and libg++.a 2.0.

4. Libc.a is almost new. Most of glibc.a 1.02 (nonnetwork stuffs) are 
here.

	a. ctype
	b. grp
	c. locale
	d. posix
	e. pwd
	f. stdlib
	g. string
	h. time (untested)

Some other functions are added.

	b. cvt
	b. drand48
	c. getlogin (poeigl-1.2)
	d. getpass (poeigl-1.2)
	e. mkfifo (is that supported in kernel?)
	f. regex (GNU)
	g. ufc
	h. utmp stuffs (poeigl-1.2)

These old functions are not changed very much.

	a. soft math (fmod is added)
	b. math (some are new)
	c. termcap
	d. unistd

5. The shared libraries are here. To link with the static libraries,
add the -static flag to gcc.

QUESTION: Is stdio ANSI compatible?

ANSWER: Yes, please test it.

QUESTION: Is g++ in 2.0?

ANSWER: Yes. Use g++ to compile the C++ code. Libg++.a 2.0 is here.
Only thing missing is curses since I don't have it. I am going to run
the tests. For the beta version of libg++.a 2.0, the only test not
passed is tFix24.

QUESTION: What options can I use for gcc?

ANSWER: Read manual page, gcc.ps or gcc.man. -O3, -O4, -O5 or even
higher should work with 2.0. -O3 is said to be the best. Don't ask me
why. Try it yourself. Also -static tells gcc to use the static
libraries. The default is the shared libraries.

QUESTION: Where is the source code of the new libc.a?

ANSWER: I will release the source code at least after the alpha test is
finished. Please test it as much as possible.

Subject: Problems with pcomm...
Date: 26 Mar 92 00:10:36 GMT

All-
  I am having trouble getting pcomm to recognize my com1 port.  For
a tty I have tried: tty0 and tty1 however I get no response from either.
I have used minix and I seem to remember something in the rc file that
initizlized the com1 port: stty 2400 </dev/tty1.  Do I need to initialize
the port?  If so, where can I find the binary for stty?

I enjoyed using term, sz, and rz with minix -- is there a linux counterpart?

                      Thanks-
                          Gary Moyer

OK, I'm about to give up on GCC 2.0 for now, sob!  I tried both the 92-03-24 and
92-03-25 versions and with both cpp would hang in processing hello.c.

I CAN compile with 1.40 and link with 2.0 to get a small 5K working executable.
Is this legitimate?  Is the cpp hang a problem known by anyone else?

Thanks in advance for ideas/info.  Compiling with 2.0 would be great!

Subject: SCSI problem w/seagate driver
Date: 26 Mar 92 01:55:49 GMT
Reply-To: chad@src.umd.edu (R Michael McMahon)
Organization: College of Engineering, Maryversity of Uniland, College Park

The seagate driver is not working on my system (386/7, Phoniex BIOS,
C&T chipset). I can boot with 0.95a without SCSI support, and have
no problems except the lack of a harddisk. Using the latest 0.95a 
SCSI bootimage (ftp'ed on 3/23), here are the diagnostics:

Host 0 is detected as a(n) Seagate ST-01/ST-02.
Seagate ST-0X SCSI dirver by Drew Ekhardt
$Header .....blah.... $
1 Host adapters detected
Detected SCSI disk at host 0, ID 0, lun 0
Detected SCSI disk at host 0, ID 1, lun 0
Detected 2 disks, 0 tapes total
Kernel panic: scsi_done() called with invalid host number

(Note: I have a Quantum 105s and a Seagate 296N installed. The 
 panic occurs with either or both drives attached.)

I have not moved any jumpers on the ST-02, meaning on-board BIOS is
at the default location, etc.

Any help for this would be appreciated. In particular, is there a way
for me to recompile (or a place to ftp) a SCSI bootimage with full
debug options? I don't have a non-scsi HD in order to do this on
my system very easily.

I have access to the Adaptec driver written by James da Silva of U.M. 
(he works upstairs!) for Minix. As soon as my Seagate is working, I
will work on porting James' driver to my Adaptec. Any others working
on this task, please send e-mail so we can collaborate.

And it works in a 1.44mb drive?  Well, it doesn't for me, at least

In that series of questions, I asked about Kermit 5A not displaying
responses to commands.  At least part of the problem can be fixed
by adding "fflush(stdout);" at the beginning of the routine "coninc()"
in source file "ckutio.c".  Also, for a non-root person to use kermit,
I found I had to change permissions: "chmod og+w /dev/tty".

This is (should be) in the FAQ. newgcc installs cpp and cc1 in /usr/lib,
but they should be somewhere on your path instead. Just link them with
ln -s.

This is not necessarily true. There's no need to include /usr/lib in PATH. All
I did was rename cc1 and cpp to gcc-cc1 and gcc-cpp. I also make a link cpp
in /usr/bin to /usr/lib/gcc-cpp so you can invoke cpp independantly.

				      ^^^^^^^^^^^^
Alpha release? Beta release? Prerelease? You can pick your term but it is
hardly experimental. I am "playing" with it because I don't have a machine
(yet) that I can dedicate for it (I have a small partition setup on my PC
at work mostly for trying it out and learning the internals). But once I
get my home machine I plan to use Linux as my main OS (it helps that all I
need is gcc, emacs, sc [for my finances ofcourse] and a few other odds and
ends.) Most of the tools are all available on the net. As for the few that
aren't I believe I can put together something usuable with the existing tools.
I have never needed nor am a big fan of GUIs. Other than that "usability",
the value added by commercial OS' is kinda dubious (may be good for the
average Joe Sixpack, but not for me or most of the people reading this group).

We all agree we like Unix. Let's not propagate past sins just because they
are/were 'standard'. If there is a better tool for the job, let's use it.
The standard be damned.

Keywords: 0.95, hd, hard drive, DR-DOS, partition, RLL
Date: 24 Mar 92 17:55:01 GMT
Distribution: alt.os.linux
Organization: University of North Florida, Jacksonville


	Here's a situation I encountered while installing 0.95a
on my Northgate 386. First, the hardware:
	Northgate 386/20 
	4 meg RAM
	Drive one: Imprimis 110 meg RLL (as C: with DR-DOS 6.0)
	Drive two: Microscience 68 meg RLL
	Adaptec 2372B controller
	A: floppy: 1.44
	B: floppy: 1.2 
	Trident 8900 SVGA running a Princeton Ultra 14

	I never had any problems with .12 and .11 to speak of. The change
in the hard drive partition ordering in .95 was confusing, because the FAQ
had the numbering wrong (someone alluded to this in another article). Linus
was kind enough to post a fix when I e-mailed him. Eventually got .95 up, 
even though I had the reset-floppy bug like everyone else.
	In my initial Linux installation, I couldn't get the system to 
install on the second drive at all. That drive had a Coherent partition which I
moved to en extended when I learned Linus doesn't like extended parts. Still,
it wouldn't install. Then I learned that DR-DOS 6.0's fdisk does some odd par
partition ordering the active partition as the *fourth* partition on the
drive partition table. This confused Linux (and me). The fix was to re-
partition the second drive using fdisk from MS-DOS 4.01, which placed the
partitions in the "right" place.
	Before installing .95a, I dumped Coherent, freeing up the 68 meg.
I tried to make the entire drive one file system, but fdisk in Linux wouldn't
do it (the only clue I had that something was wrong was that when I entered the following line: mkfs -c /dev/hdb1 66500, the command would come back with a usage error , as though I entered the command incorrectly. There should be an error
message here that specific (like: "cannot make fs that large"). I dug through
copies of saved articles and found the clue: Linus telling someone else that
64 meg is the biggest file system size.
	Back to DOS fdisk. I created two partitions, one 55 meg and another
about 10 meg. I created a Linux filesystem on the first partition. I then 
looked at the partition setup using Linux fdisk. First partition is okay. 
Below that, it shows the second partition as hdb2, extended, and don't use.
Below *that* it shows hdb5 as what I believe is a subset of hdb2, slightly
smaller (about 10 meg). I decided to create a filesystem on the other
partition for use as a swap file drive. No problem creating the fs. Then, yesterday, I read the note from Linus warning not to use any partition that shows
up as >=hdb5, or the system will mess up the start and stop points of the
partitions. 
	I decided to finish installing the system on the first partition. Late
last night, while installing the kernel source code, the installation quit,
apparently out of drive space. What I discovered was that the files I was
installing (over 10 meg) were somehow ending up on /hdb5, and soon I was
out of room. 
	I had to wipe the filesystem clean, repartition the drive, create
one filesystem on the main partition, and reinstall the entire filesystem
and the supporting files. It was a late night.

	My advice is therefore to carefully check how Linux sees each partition. For some reason, you cannot create a filesystem in the extended partitions at
all, even for use as a swapfile.

  Questions:

1)  Where do you untar lib-0.12.tar?

2)  My roommate and I are trying to set up a remote terminal
  in one of the virtual comsoles (prefer 8).  We are using a 
  null modem to connect the two computers.  (mine = ttys2, his = ttys3)
   How do we set this up?

3)  How do I setup a printer daemon?
4)  Where can I get the binaries of rz and sz?  I have source but
  I don't enough memory to compile anything.

5)  Will at swapfile fix this problem with my compiler not having
enough memory?  If so, how do I set it up?   

6)  Can anyone point out books that I can use as guides on how to
  program in an environment like Linux?

7)  Can ka9q use a modem?  I know it is TCP/IP but what is needed
   to run this puppy?  :)

That's all for now.  *grin*

Thanks!

>(i.e.  tar cvf kermit.tar kermit) after I uncompress the file kermit.Z.

	There's an easy way to move files from DOS to Linus using
rawrite, and you don't have to tar the file either. You need to be
sure you have the dd file conversion utility on your linux disk (it was
in the 0.95 distribution, but it may have been dropped on 0.95a. Get it.
	1. Write down the file size in bytes as reposted by DOS. Be 
exact, as this is needed later.
	2. Format a floppy ans rawrite the file to the floppy.
	3. Crank up linux. Put the floppy with the raw file in the disk 
drive and enter this command (this assumes your using a high-density
3.5" drive for a floppy. Change the device as necessary)
	dd if=/dev/PS0 of=filename bs=1 count=filesize
"Filename" is the name of the file, "count" is the DOS size you should
have written down. This command will copy the fil from the floppy to
the current directory on the hard disk. "bs=1" tells the dd command
to do a byte-by-byte copy, as though you transferred an image.
	This worked for me very well today.

	The correct command it set line /dev/ttys2 for com2. Don't forget
to set the modem speed as the next command.

That was my first thought too, but like I said, it works fine under MSDOS at
33 MHz.
 
    I have noticed that the few people who have mentioned this problem are all
running 486's, for whatever that might be worth.

I don't think this is a good idea. It is VERY hard to get this kind
of thing right. Some people have existing minix partitions, others
have OS2 partitions, some want to make the partition autoboot, others
don't. Anyway, I think it will do more harm than that it can help.
(humans are much better than machines at errorsolving. How
would you program the install program when you get a mount error 2?
Forgetting to check the return code will canabalize the root
floppy. Can you find any reasons that could allow your
program to continue?)

Acceptable could be a step by step, highly interactive version, which 
says exacly what it is going to do, and then upon confirmation, will do it.
It should allow the dos users a slightly easier move to linux. 
however for instance, repartitioning a HD is an operation guaranteed to
destroy all data on your hard disk. If you make it too easy, you'll make
some nasty friends. (remember that for instance programs that optimize
hard disks also warn you to backup the hd, which lots of people don't
do, since it is almost never neccessary)

Thanks to all you people out there for making this a very
helpfull conference. (Linus, the Linux is great)

I'm having some problems after uppgrading to 0.95a.

1. Can't make the gcc1.40 (wich worked wonders under
   the 0.12), work now.

   This is what happens when I try to compile:

   general protection
   EIP:   000f:00000180
   EEFLAGS:   00010246
   ESP:   0017:03BFFECC
   fs:  0010
   base:   20000000, limit 04000000
   PID 18, process nr: 8
   18 89 55 fc 8b 45 fc 80 38 2d
   Program fatal signal 18

   Any ideas ???

2. Can't make the gcc2.0 work proparly. Complains
   about error in include file.

   When compiling I get:

   parse error at or near '(' in line 97 in
   the stdio.h file.

   What is wrong ? (me ?)

3. I final question: I'm no UNIX guru, but I want to take
   advantage of all the patches out there.
   Can anyone mail me a description of how patching is done ?

I would be very gratefull for any help / suggestions !

If the track-mapping is in the controller and not in some bios-routines,
linux should be able to run with it: indeed it happens automatically for
most machines I've heard of. Are you 100% sure linux can't use it
already?

/If/ linux seems unable to use the mapping-feature, there is still some
hope.  I've left in the old code that hardcoded the harddisk parameters
instead of reading them from the BIOS, and by editing the config.h file
you can hardcode linux to think you have a specific number of sectors/
heads/tracks.  Check out linux/config.h: the HD_TYPE macro. This isn't
guaranteed to help your problems, but it's worth a try.

Subject: Bug in gets()
Date: 25 Mar 92 16:45:03 GMT
Distribution: alt.os.linux
Organization: Department of Theoretical Physics, University of Helsinki,
	Finland

Just one day I fooled around with gets() and found out about this oddity.

First some theory:

gets() reads characters from the stdin to an array up to a newline. When
gets() encounters a newline, it terminates the array it was building and
returns a pointer to it. It should return a pointer to NULL pointer if it
can`t read from stdin or there is some other kind of a problem.


Then the practical bits:

I had a line of code like this in my code:

	while(gets(foo[i++]) != NULL)
		;

When this code digested an empty line (ie. a line that contained just the
newline character) gets() returned a NULL pointer. Clearly not at all what
I wanted!


And some background:

I compiled the code with the Gcc 2.0 (shared libraries) in Linux 0.95a. I
tried the same code in SunOS 4.1.2 and it worked just as it should, gets()
returns NULL pointer only at the end of file.

So, if someone who has the source for the libc could look this up.

It might be beneficial to use the same naming scheme for smart serial
cards, too. It would hide the differences of the hardware and programs
could just open /dev/tty<letter><number>, even if some of them were
smart cards and others not.

I have been trying to build ispell for linux with mixed results. I have

a dictionary because the makefile macros use the standard unix spell program for
some processing when building the dictionary files. I have tried building the
dictionary files on a sparc (where they work) and then moving them to linux but
they fail some magic number test in ispell (possibly due to byte translation).

I have been unsuccessful, so far, in tracking down the sources for spell and am
therefore asking does any one have a working version of spell for linux.

If you read National Semiconductors (or any elses) databooks this is
correct.. BUT it does work without problem at least between to 8250
compatible UART's. But to use it you need to have 16550A (or
compatible) with buffers so that the computer won't be overrun. I
don't know if Linux 0.95a uses the buffers, but it shouldn't be
impossible to add if it isn't there already.

Has anyone sucessfully installed newgcc.tar from tsx-11? After my post
about this problem last week, I got mail from several people who had
had this problem. Is it possible tsx-11's newgcc.tar is corrupted
somehow? 

Replacing /usr/bin/as with gccbin/gcc-as from gccbin.tar seems to fix
this problem.

I installed gcc 1.4 from newgcc.tar and newlib.tar soon after they
were put on tsx-11.  I then built df.c from it.  No problems.

And seeing as I couldn't use the previous gcc, I was quite amazed.
Of course following the instruction from various people probably
helped a lot since I tried installing the old gcc with no help
at all.  Read the documentation that come with newgcc.  It helped me!

Hello LINUXer,

I'm no kernel-guru, but I have a serious kernel-problem.
I run Linux on my NoteBook, which has hardwired spindown
of the HD after some period of time. When spinning-up
again the kernel timeouts and system hangs. I had no
problems with version 0.11 so I think it must be possible
to adjust the timeout so that it doesn't timeout that
fast. (Spinning up takes about 1.5-2 seconds).

Since I'm no kernel-guru (as stated before) I dont't
no where in the kernel-source the timout-values might
be distributed.

Someone knows where to search 4 those?

BTW: reCompiling the source and building a bootable
     disk is NOT the problem.

I have x2 Western Digital IDE hard drives, hard drive #2 (drive1 by
unix terminology standards) I 'had' /dev/hdb1 33M, /dev/hdb2 8M
last night. (DOS 5.0 fdisk'd and formatted under DOS). (I had played
around with DOS, edpart.exe, with it's 32Mb limits, pfdisk, actually
feeding it with 'g 782 4 27' the correct parameters for my disks'
parameters..., but couldn't get it to work with Linux mkfs until I
did the partitions from within DOS 5.0...ugh!!!).

Everything was fine until I used mtools (athos.rutgers.edu) to mcopy
2gcclib.tar.Z (large, 1.4M file) over to a subdirectory on my
Linux partition (33M /dev/hdb1) and halfway through it gave an
error of no more disk space left. I issued a 'df' right away and
found that it reported the mounted root partition only had 8M
and it was 'all' used up... heh. I immediately backed up onto floppies
everything and got out to DOS. Partitions were still reported okay...

Anyway, I repartitioned my hard drive to 1) less than 32M (29M),
2) 2Mb, 3) 8Mb for the swap space..... I hope to have no other
problems with things being larger than 32Mb as half of the programs
available that people are suggesting to use don't recognize them,
and to avoid extended partitions..... 

Wish me luck.

I've been trying to get Linux up on my 486 to the point that I could
run the fairly demanding genetic-algorithm jobs I'm working on for my
thesis. I ditched Coherent because its small-model compiler couldn't
handle the sizes of the data structures involved. So today I *finally*
got everything working (reasonably) well, and managed to compile the
GA --- and boy, was it worth it! Same machine, same exact code --- but
compiled under linux with gcc-1.40, it runs *at least* three times
faster, even with a fairly intense kermit session on another pty! WOW!

I like having it both ways. I set up the ttys by card and line similar to
/dev/ttya1.., but then create a hard link by function (e.g. /dev/modem,
/dev/printer, /dev/x10, /dev/mouse).  This way applications can use things
like /dev/mouse and find it where is currently located, and I can also find all
of the devices in order for testing/debugging.  The power of UNIX is the
filesystem, use it!

There are indeed.  As one of the instigators of the binutils patch I
have a few comments.  Don't expect to just drop in the changes and
expect gld to magically produce correct a.out files for linux.  When
I was making the changes I was thinking only of 386bsd (or whatever
it's called these days).  For which purpose it works great (IMHO).  If
anyone wants some hints on how it may be possible to make this produce

I have asked our hardware engineers about the DTK problem and it seems that 
power distribution on the board is less than optimal.  At higher clock rates
or with a number of add-on cards installed or both the 5 volts on the mother
board is closr to 3 or 4 volts.  Some systems and cards can handle this but
most can't.  So a good work around is to not have very many add-on cards.  
heat also makes the problem worse so if your case is badly ventilated you
will see the problem more.  Hope that this helps the cause [.

   I think the harsh words of those who are against your aims are due to
   their reluctance to spend all their extra hours working on Linux, while
   you get rich and they stay poor. Remember, many of those working on
   linux are doing so because they can't afford to spend money on software
   i.e. they are NOT rich.

Yes, and please nobody go off and make any money making Linux usable
for non-hackers, because doing so will make Linux so popular that those of
us who wish to remain poor hackers with expertise on Linux internals won't
be tempted to service the growing base of Linux users.  And doing so will
result in funding for making improvements to Linux that we'd all rather spend
our valuable but un-paid time doing ourselves.

Really, this whole thing is silly.  Someone setting up a company to distribute
and service Linux is _not_ doing so "on the backs of other people's labor",
that's entirely the _point_ of the GPL.

Put another way, after spending over 2.5 years doing _volunteer_ work creating
a free (GPL-protected) Fortran compiler (it's nearly ready for alpha -- I
just need a machine!), I have _no_ problem with companies like Cygnus coming
along and making money off distributing and servicing it.  In fact, without
such companies, I could pretty much write off any expectation of my Fortran
compiler becoming widely accepted and widely used, and hence allowing me to,
if I choose, service and enhance it myself for a fee, or giving me good reason
to do so for free.  Without Cygnus and the kind of company the original
poster described, things like GNU software and Linux simply _cannot_
penetrate certain markets and companies due to their own rules about not
using software that doesn't have committed, paid-for support in some form.

And when people are literally standing around wanting to give you money so
you can support _free_ software for them -- software you already pretty much
understand, want to learn better, and _want_ to support anyway -- it's
hard (and perhaps silly) to say no unless you feel you have better things to
do with your life.

Finally, because most or all of the software involved is GPL-protected, we
can _all_ share in the benefits of such companies.  It is better to have
someone support Linux for a fee, meaning we'll have access to all their
improvements in the versions of Linux they release to their supported
customers, than to have others support _either_ a PD UNIX (where they make
proprietary changes) or a proprietary UNIX (where we never see the source
code in the first place).

Put another way, when a customer wants to spend $100,000 in a year to
improve _some_ version of UNIX so it does things the customer needs (like
run X, perhaps, or run page-layout software we might all like having), that
customer has several choices:

    1.  License a proprietary UNIX w/source, hire talent to do the work.

    2.  Grab a PD UNIX w/source, hire talent to do the work.

    3.  Grab a GPL-protected UNIX w/source, hire talent to do the work.

Now, options 1 and 2, however they're done, are likely to result in the
wonderful improvements _not_ benefitting the rest of us, because source code
for the improvements won't be released.

Option 3 results in _all_ of us having access to the source code for the
improvements (unless the customer hires someone to do the work as for-hire
work and never distributes the results or derivatives of the results -- not
the case when companies like Cygnus do the work).

So option 3 is the best option given the existence of such a customer.

Now, do you _really_ want to bad-mouth anyone willing to start up a business
that covers option 3?  Because as long as you do, and as long as such
behavior prevents people from supporting Linux for a fee, customers with
lots of money will _have_ to choose options 1 or 2 -- and we'll see no
benefit from that.

And, in particular, "poor hackers" who know the internals of Linux will have
a much harder time getting contract or full-time work supporting customers
who have chosen options 1 and 2 than those who have chosen option 3, or
snarfed copies of the results of some other customer who paid for option 3,
or whatever.

Welcome to the world of Free Software (as in GPL-protected).  There's lots of
money to be made.  There's lots of room for volunteer work (as I've done so
far).  But, unlike most previous models for software licensing or public
domain, this model allows the greatest exercise of revenue production with
the lowest-permissible impact on the volunteer work.

So, there's no reason to resent or be upset about people profitting off your
work on Linux in one way or another.  That can't really hurt you, except
insofar as it represents competition if _you're_ trying to profit off your
own work.  And it sure can help you, as I've described above.

Right now I _wish_ there was some organization like the one proposed that
supported Linux for paying customers.  Then I'd have more hope of either
getting the machine configuration I want to buy to run Linux or getting
support for doing the necessary work voluntarily (like access to scopes or
whatever is needed to write drivers, or access to possibly expensive
technical documents describing device interfaces).  Instead, without Cygnus
supporting Linux and without some other company supporting it, I have to
assume that, since I have (or will have after I buy the machine) virtually
no spending money, I'll have to creep through building drivers and suchlike
myself, something I'm only vaguely looking forward to right now.

And, if you're interested in my experiences with GNU Fortran, in the 2.5
years I've been working on it, far-and-away the _best_ support I've received
on the project has been from Cygnus Support -- definitely not the FSF.
(Remember this is Fortran.  Hardly anybody in the free-software world cares
about Fortran at the moment, though that will change.)  If it wasn't for my
taking a contract to have access to a UNIX workstation for a while and for
Cygnus either getting me some money or giving me a few weeks access to one
of their machines (including free parking in Cambridge during that time),
my compiler would be over six months away from alpha test, instead of ready
for internal testing (for which I still need a machine).

So let's _encourage_ those who want to start for-profit service organizations
for Linux.  The worst that can happen is _they_ lose _their_ shirts!  And
as long as they have any half-baked business sense, we won't even have to
hassle them to fund our work -- _they'll_ come to _us_ to make improvements,
especially the long-term ones, to ensure continued interest in (and demand
for) _their_ services from customers.

(1)  pfdisk does not do what I want: it requires me to know the

     a small patch to get this information from the kernel.

(2)  My pfdisk now does most of the required handling of extended

Because the gcc 2.0 is in alpha testing, there have been quite a
number of releases.  Shared libraries did not work in one of these,
which I believe is the one now on nic.funet.fi.  Get the latest

sort comes from GNU textutils.  A slightly outdated version
(as of March 16) can be found in textutils-1.2.tar.Z in /pub/linux/mcc-bin
on hpb.mcc.ac.uk [130.88.200.7], which is accessible by anonymous ftp.
This contains binaries and patches.  I call it slightly outdated
because GNU have released textutils-1.3 on March 16.  This is
being worked on.

With respect to the files on this machine, several people have
made good suggestions about their organisation, which will be
implemented as soon as time permits.

Some British Linuxists have asked whether this machine can be
accessed by coloured book file transfer (NIFTP).  I have not been
able to answer all of them, in one case because my mailer refuses
to accept his address.  Such software does exist on that machine,
but it will stop working when we upgrade its operating system.  It
is poorly written and does not support anonymous ftp in a secure
fashion.  While it is still there, I am willing to set up temporary
user names for specific people on a short term basis, but I cannot
open the machine up for general access using this software.

I have tried to get an info-server working, but have not yet found
one which works on HP-UX.

This is a bug.  I am using 0.95a + the published patches from Linus.
The cd works, but if you type pwd when you are there, the command
fails.  I suspect error checking in bash, which is older than the
current library release.  This bug does not exist in the same version
of bash on other machines.  It is also possible that some error code
is not being interpreted properly.

It's not a problem.  Only one request at a time will be passed to the 
device driver.  It's taken care of farther up than the device driver.

With disks : No, it won't be a problem.

With serial ports, etc : output isn't a problem, except that there

You can't compile it with -finline-functions, for some reason.  Or
at least it compiled when I took out that option.  In fact there are
quite a few files in the kernel for which I had to switch compiler
options.  Also, there's a lingering d_entry in swap.c that should
be removed, I think.

And I'm not even sure I did it all right, because ps doesn't work
for me-- it only displays the header line, and sometimes it complains
about /dev/kmem.

I personally plan on sticking with linux and NOT going to the
free release of 386BSD.  Why?  Well, my machine now only
has 4 megs of RAM, which seems to be fine for linux, but I
suspect would crowd BSD.  Ipalso currently only have 80 megs
of disk space, 40 of which I devote to linux and 40 to DOS.
(I would throw DOS out completely, but I have too much invested
in software for it to diiregard it completely).  40 megs
should be sufficient, approaching comfortable, for linux.
If you tell 386BSD unix you only have 40 megs available for
it, it will just laugh at you.  Also, DOS and 386BSD cannot
co-exist on the same machine (yet).
Just wanted to get my $0.02 worth in.  Keep up the good work
Linus, I'll stay with you!

Why would you think that?  According to Jolitz a year or two ago, the then
386bsd could run in 640k of RAM (although it would "take gcc five minutes to
compile a null program").  I suspect it would be extremely happy in 4MBytes
(BSDinc says 4MBytes RAM is minimum, unless you want to use X, in which case
you should have 8, which makes sense).

>I also currently only have 80 megs of disk space

Ah.  Now *that* is probably a limitation.  I believe you'd want to dedicate
that 80MBytes to 386bsd, if you chose to run it, even though you get the
added advantage (supposedly; I'm not sure it works yet) of having NFS, which
Linux doesn't have (yet!).

Actually this bring up even more questions about serial ports and addressability.

Under DOS, the BIOS checks for serial cards at 3F8, 2F8, 3E8, and 2E8.
Unless your BIOS is really old, or your machine is a PS/2 machine.
The really old BIOSes only check for 3F8 and 2F8, and the PS/2 machines
look at 3F8, 2F8, and 6 addresses in the 38xx range.  The first four
addresses that respond during POST are stored in segment 40 starting
at location 0.  If your machine only has 2 serial ports at addresses
2F8 and 3E8, then DOS will recognize COM2 as COM1, and COM3 as COM2.
Confused yet? 

Under UNIX, device names usually reflect a name which designates
a particular controller or device driver, and a number of device
numbers and/or sub numbers which correspond to the major and minor
device numbers given to mknod.

If the serial ports at 3F8, 2E8, 2F8, and 3E8 are all accessable using
a singular device driver, then they should all have the same
device subname, and be differentiated via numbers/letters.
There should also probably be a 1-to-1 coorespondance between a
particular IO address, and a device name.  In that way, the device drivers
are easier to maintain (tables of addresses).

If the serial ports from a "smart-board" are not useable from the
standard serial device driver, then they should use a different
device base name (which probably requires it's own device driver,
rather than hacking the standard one).  This will all become painfuly
obvious when device drivers are able to be selected during a kernal
rebuild.

This will all help to separate the "PC" serial devices from the "PS/2"
serial devices from the "other" serial devices.

The only arguments left will then be what base names to use, whether to
use letters or numbers, and whether to start numbering from 0 or 1 B^).

Yes, it can use a modem.  In fact that's the only mode I've actually
tested.  However at least as I've built it, it can't dial.  I use
kermit to connect to a system at Rutgers, log in, and start SLIP.
Once the line is running SLIP, I exit from kermit and start KA9Q.
This is certainly not optimal.  Ideally there'd be something like the
kermit script language to dial and login for you, so that novice users
could use it without having to know kermit as well.  But this is not
shrink-wrapped software...  The big practical problem is finding a
machine connected to your campus or company network that can run SLIP.
KA9Q isn't enough to put you on a network -- there's got to be
something at the other end that is willing to talk SLIP and forward
packets onto a network.  (It's sort of hard to have a network with
just one machine.)  If the modems on your campus are connected to
terminal servers rather than directly to computers, there's a good
chance the terminal servers can be configured to do SLIP.  We use
Cisco terminal servers, which do this, but I believe several other
kinds do as well.  Even if the modems are connected directly to
computers, there are implementations of SLIP for Unix and I think VMS.
(Don't ask me where though, because I don't know.)  However setting
things up at your campus or corporation is going to require
cooperation on the part of your systems staff: if you're using a
terminal server, they'll have to configure SLIP and enable it; if your
modems are directly on computers, they'll have to install the SLIP
software, which must be installed in the kernel.  (I think it can be
done without having kernel source.)

MOST Directory permissions : 
should be 

755 - read / write / execute owner, read / execute everyone else

/tmp and /usr/tmp should be 1777 - sticky, read / write / execute all.
Sticky keeps people from deleting files they don't own.

Executables should probably be 555, read / execute all, unless they 
are setuid.  Many people like to make mount / umount setuid to 
root so that "normal" people can run them.  The best thing to
do there is to make the permissions on mount / umount 

u+s 750 , owner root, group wheel, and put yourself in group wheel.


/dev  

terminals, etc should probably be rw all - ie 666, hard disks 600, 
floppies 666.

This depends if the mapping is done at the BIOS or hardware level.  My guess

You can hack hd.c to perform appropriate translations before issuing

I too have a DTK-PEM-2530  80386DX 25MHz with a 12.5MHz bus speed. Linux
works fine in Turbo mode.  The troubles I've been having with "HD Timeout"
are all caused by a very cheap IDE hard disk controller card. The system works
just fine with a newer, faster card. 

(In case you're curious, the HD Controller is talking to two Seagate 1144A
drives and occasionally the system will "miss" an interrupt and things 
go haywire.)

Is this certain? Someone suggested in an earlier post or two that
Linux was 'exactly' compatible with Minix (what version of Minix
I do not know, I was going to ask). If this is true....

The filesystem is still pretty similar to minix: the only addition is
the symbolic links. If you do not use symlinks, minix and linux
filesystems are totally interchangeable. There are some very minor
differences: minix always clears the inode->mode word when it deletes an
inode, and linux doesn't, so minix fsck will report some spurious error
messages for linux partitions, but that's no big deal (you can make the
linux fdisk report the same errors with the "-m" flag).

Both are correct: it's decimal 65 and hex 41.  Use decimal numbers for
most things (ls -l does), but when giving the whole device number as
one, it's usually easier to use hex.  Thus /dev/hdb1 is (3,65) but also
0x0341 depending on what you want to do.

This has to do with how shared libraries are currently implemented in 
Linux.  

The top 4MB of a process's address space is reserved for shared 
libraries.  Any references to this address space will result in the 
shared library being  demmand paged into this area, just like a 
normal executable.

When you link with a library under /usr/lib/shared, the addresses in that 
library point to areas in that top 4MB. The libraries here are 
"stubs" so to speak, and have no actual code.

The /lib/lib92.03.16 or whatever file (the version of the shared 
library is maintained in crt0.{s,o} is the actual code 
which gets page faulted in.

Both the actual binary, and shread library stubs must be present
for shared libraries to work.

address space as a normal executable is.

X windows is an interaction between "client" processes (ie
xterm, xbiff, etc) and a server.  X386 is the xserver for 386 unixes.

Also, you can do graphics if you have used obz's mmap(2) patches,
by mapping the frame buffer into user memory.  Bank switching, etc
can be done through writing to /dev/port.

hardly.  A VERY small portion of the device dependant code 
(/src/mit/server/ddx/x386/drivers from the stock X11R5 distribution) 
is written in assembler, and then only the bank switching code.

I built ispell some time ago, and didn't run into this problem at all
- it compiled just about perfectly out of the box, from what I
remember.  I think there's something in the README or INSTALL notes
about building some of the things without the 'standard' UNIX spell.
(Such as there is one pre-generated file in the package, but it isn't
used by default - sort of how yacc/bison and flex stuff sometimes is
provided for those without the necessary programs.)

If you still have problems, drop me a line and tell me what the
Makefile is trying to generate (the dictionary, I assume) and I can
package up the dictionary I have.

Where are they?

I'm having problems compiling stuff with gcc.  I started out with gcc-1.40,
stuck it in the right places and made the right links, but couldn't even
#include <stdio.h> in my programs.

I read that I needed the compiler sources to get the headers, so I ftp'd
'em, and gcc2.0 at the same time.  I installed the newer compiler, which
came with a stdio header, but now compiles fail when the program wants to
include other stuff, particularly <dirent.h>.  This file exists in gcc2.0's
private includes directory, but then dirent.h includes sys/dirent.h, which
I can't find anywhere, not even with the linux 0.95a sources.

Another program I was trying to build wanted to include termio.h, which
didn't exist, but termios.h did, so I changed the name, and it was happy I
think.

Is there a full set of standard include files somewhere, or at least a
list of names, so I know what I'm missing (and hopefully where to find them)?


P.S.  If you post a reply to this, would you please mail a copy directly
to me as well?	My news feed misses about 98% of the articles posted here.

I looked at the pathnames with "tar tf /dev/xxx" and do a "cd" so the file

You need to run a terminal emulator (like kermit) in the vc.  You then need
to have kermit do a "set line /dev/ttysx" to own the serial line.  On the other
side, you need to have a getty running on serial port being connected to.
Note, it you try and connect the two serial ports together that are running
the gettys, then you will end up with the 2 gettys trying to talk to each other.
Not very useful.  Now the kermit user can go into the terminal emulator, and if
you did things right, he should be talking to a getty which is asking him
to login.

How are you fixed for disk space?  Can you setup a swap partition or
put a swap file in your file system somewhere?  I turn my swap partition
on with a "swapon /dev/hdxx" in my /etc/rc file.  Turned 4 MB into 9 MB.

I get my sources from tsx-11.mit.edu, though I will admit to not knowing
if Z-modem is there or not.

It should, swap space (whether a partition or a disk file) should look
to you like virtual memory.  It may not be as fast when you have to use it,
but you can do more before you run out of "memory".

Sorry.  Unix programming is new to me too.  That's why I'm playing

I have KA9Q running between home and my office via a modem connection.
Here's how I did it.  In my office I have an 286 PC with 640K memory
running DOS 3.3, and KA9Q for DOS.  It also has an ethernet card.
the DOS KA9Q is set up to route packets from the ethernet to the modem
via SL/IP.  My machine at home and the machine in my office are on a subnet
by themselves.  AT home under either DOS or LINUX, I have similar AUTOEXEC.NET
files that configure my home PC.  First from home, I call the modem in my office
(usually with kermit since the KA9Q for LINUX doesn't support TIP yet).  Once the
two modems are connected, I bring up KA9Q at home.  Since both KA9Qs are talking
SL/IP over the modem, I AM CONNECTED.  As long as the name service and routers
at work know about the SL/IP routing, I AM LIVE ON THE INTERNET.  I can then
TELNET, FTP, PING, etc to my heart's content while I am running KA9Q.

I can't wait for when SL/IP support is in the LINUX kernal, and all I have to do
is make the modem connection for ANY LINUX user to be able to use the SL/IP
connections.

I'm currently live at 2400 BAUD.  Both KA9Qs support SL/IP, cSL/IP, and PPP.
I will admit to not trying out the latter two yet (It involves remembering
to change both configurations correctly at a penalty of being unconnected
for 24 hours if I get it wrong).  I tried just changing one side from SL/IP
to cSL/IP.  It didn't work.  I know that when cSL/IP is installed on a UNIX
box it will make connections with either SL/IP or cSL/IP.  Whoever put the
support in KA9Q must have cut a corner for cSL/IP.

One of these days, I'll get around to using a faster modem/protocol and see what
happens.

YES.  This is normal behavior with Mtools.  It tries every entry for 
A:  or whatever in the devices.c?  file (in the source), and when
it gets an error it tries the next one.  Set the devices up so
that the first entry for A: or whatever is the most commonly 
used one.

Those are WARNINGS.  Warnings mean "Hey, you may have done something stupid,
but syntactically, it's correct.  Just thought I'd let you know".  gcc

As far as having parallel compilations, etc you probably shouldn't do it.
With one build, you may swap a little on a typical 4M system,
, but mostly you'll still be in
real memory.  With two, that won't be the case with limited 
amounts of ram.  The rule of thumb is that disk is 1000 times slower than
real memory.

No.  The die() routine prints out some information, but no 
core dump is performed.  Some one might want to 
implement core dumps now that we have a debugger.

You want to fork() then exec() not just exec when running the

I've been messing around trying to get mail up on my machine. smail
compiles fairly cleanly, and same for elm after I got all the programs
necessary to run the configure script.  I have a problem with local
mail delivery, though.  Anyone have a suggestion as to shere to get lmail?
I tried writing lmail as a sh script.  To make it work,wit has to run suid.
However, even suid, I can't chown the mail file after appending a message
to it.  Is this a bug, or am I doing something wrong?  My lmail is just:

#!/bin/sh
cat - >>/usr/spool/mail/$1
chown $1 /usr/spool/mail/$1

Any help appreciated.

Depends. When I got pfdisk and compiled it with gcc-1.40 I discovered
a bug in the sscanf library-routine (in "newlibc"). I did a very crude
hack to get around this bug. The only problem with this hack is that 
you have to type exactly *one* space between the numbers. I put this
hacked version of pfdisk.c as pfdisk.c-bjl in the kit which I uploaded
to tsx-11 and nic.funet. I explained in the README file what I did.
I don't know which gcc version was used to compile pfdisk and which 
version of pfdisk.c was used. I haven't tried it with gcc-2.0 yet. 
To summarise: grab the sources of pfdisk (the one on nic.funet seems to 
be corrupt), check your version of gcc and recompile.

I'm not sure I understand this. I uploaded pfdisk.tar.Z to tsx-11 and
to nic.funet. I'm sure it was the same file I sent to both servers. 
It is true that the original files came from a DOS system (with ^Ms
after each line) but I cleaned them up and it worked on my system. The
only difference between nic.funet and tsx-11 could be that tsx-11 has
binary mode as the standard mode for ftp. It was the first time I ever
uploaded something, and I might have forgotten to set binary mode when
I uploaded to nic.funet. Unfortunately our InterNet link is down so I
can't check this.

I just checked it and the version on nic.funet is indeed corrupt. 
I tried to uncompress and untar the file and it crashed at a small
binary file. So I suppose I indeed forgot to set binary mode when I
uploaded the file to nic.funet. Sorry for that. The copy on tsx-11
(pub/linux/sources/sbin/pfdisk.tar.Z) is correct. Maybe the one on
nic.funet can be replaced with the correct one?

Every now and then, a few people have had problems with the bootable
images for SCSI.  I think 3 people have had an identical problem with
the .95a images.  The only "common" thing I've seen, and possible
difference from my system is that no one is using shoelace.

You might try the bootimage-0.12.seagate.3 Linux .12 bootimage,
and make a root file system with shoelace and the kernel on it.

As far as a debugging version of the kernel : I will upload 
a version compiled with debug flags to headrest.colorado.edu
RSN.

Tommy Thorn tthorn@daimi.aau.dk is currently working on this,
and in a post of his I saw today, it was promised "RSN"

It looks like Wierdness has struck with Linux .95 - the larger 
kernel (compared to .12) + larger SCSI patches (seagate + ultrastor)
move an area being stomped on to something noticeable.  If you used
every patch available with .12 together, you also noticed
this problem.

In some cases, Linux (the stock kernel) stomps on Kernel memory, 
and depending on who you are, something not noticeable / file_table[] / stack 
, etc.  gets corrupted.  In my case, it was file_table[] that 
was being stepped on, with SCSI drivers in place and "active",
or with the initialization routine replaced by a return to eliminate
any chance the SCSI drivers had for messing things up.

The distribution SCSI kernel, or the kludge.diff moved this and made 
it go away.  

Also, if you are booting off of floppy without shoelace, BSS will be
uninitialized, and is not guranteed to be all 0's.  This 
may or may not effect Linux.   I don't know what happens to BSS 
if you are using shoelace.

     encrypted password
     numerical user ID
     numerical group ID
     user's real name, office, extension, home phone.
     initial working directory

     The name may contain `&', meaning insert the login name.
     This information is set by the _c_h_f_n(1) command and used by
     the _f_i_n_g_e_r(1) command.

     This is an ASCII file.  Each field within each user's entry
     is separated from the next by a colon.  Each user is
     separated from the next by a new-line.  If the password
     field is null, no password is demanded; if the Shell field
     is null, then /_b_i_n/_s_h is used.

     This file resides in directory /etc.  Because of the
     encrypted passwords, it can and does have general read per-
     mission and can be used, for example, to map numerical user
     ID's to names.

     Appropriate precautions must be taken to lock the file

Could someone tell me where I might find the binary or sources for
date, bash, and who?  Yes, I've looked on tsx-11.

Also, I noticed that whenever I use ^C to kill an incomplete 
command line, the shell properly gives me a new line and a
prompt, but it forgets to kill the old command line.  Maybe
I'll just port tcsh...

I (boyer@sumax.seattleu.edu) am about (in one week) release the 
'completed' version of the '(DOS) BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO LINUX/unix'!!

PLEASE!!!: read it, as it will represent Linux 0.95a. 

Old users (programmers, comfortable, seasoned unix users);
 please read it for any syntactic problems. This guide is meant to
 answer 99% of the 'new-users (especially from DOS)' silly, idiotic,
 questions which will clutter up the net, while more important
 programming/compiling, bug questions/posts/discussions are going on...
 So, your corrections, suggestions, concerns will be used.

New users (DOS users who are trying Linux/unix for the first time ever);
 please read and try out a few examples from the manual. Mail me where
 you find problems understanding my explanations, where something is
 confusing. This will help the next 'new' user out a lot, as I will
 implement your suggestions in the final release.

The final release will be April 4th.!!! So, suggestions made after
April 1st will not be addressed/included into the Guide. I will then
take a rest, do other things, and will not change/update the Guide
Until June at least (perhaps that will be Linux release 1.2? Whatever).

Especially Linus, any responses?

-------------
Already mailed requests/responses that I will implement;

1) There will be appendices for
	a. ls -l listings (which will also be 'crc' checking listings
		for anybody.
	b. error code listing moved to appendix b.
	c. special problems that need further explanations, appendix c.

2) the loose usage of root, /, and /root will be clarified.

I had originally patched the bootsector to muck with the FD

track reads on anything but lowdensity disks.

When I did this, I put in the now infamous code that does the 
error dumps

@X:xxxx
AX:xxxx
BX:

etc.

for my own debugging purposes, and left it there as I decided that 
it was a Good Thing (tm) - it's real easy to look at a dump, 
and say "Hey, you wrote it to a low density disk, and that's 
why it doesn't work" 

That @X isn't supposed to be printed, and is the result of a one line    
omission in the bootsect.s patches (I had originally been assembling 
with A86, as I could then use a symbolic debugger on the boot code.
I translated from the original source to MASM syntax with a small 
perl script, but patched the original sources by hand once it was
working - and left off one instruction).  The following patch corrects this :

Date: 27 Mar 92 04:54:35 GMT

Nntp-Posting-Host: kinglear.cs.colorado.edu


When doing heavy kernel hacking and debugging, sometimes the DEBUG messages
implemented with printk()'s would fly off the screen so fast, it would 
make you dizzy =8^)

I have fixed this misfeature with the pause patches.  What these 
do is ensure that you have atleast X seconds (configurable) to read 
each printk() message.  If the last printk is going to scroll off the 
screen, and X seconds have not elapsed, it goes into a kernel pause,
where interrupts are serviced but everything else is sstopped.


The keyboard lights move from left to right when this happens,
so you know what has happened.

The patches are in the file pause.tar.Z at the usual places 
(arl, and tytso - it is in incoming of tsx-11 and nic.funet)
and on my machine headrest.colorado.edu under pub/linux/src

What else needs to be done - these patches work with the configuration
system I am currently using.


--- IMPORTANT ---
You also need a config.dist.h, and config.site.h.  You can grab the 
config.dist.h from the SCSI patches, or just touch(1) it.  
touch config.site.h.  

Note that keyboard.S and config.h are patched against the originals - 
if you have installed the SCSI patches, you'll have to either 
patch by hand, or patch the original distribution files.

I have been having problems with tar in version 0.95a, it usually happens
with large compressed tar files (the gcc2 files for example)...I use the

	tar xvofvz 2misc.tar.Z
and tar just hangs doesn't extract any files sometimes it will show the

press ^C to cancel so it is not actually locking up...most of the time
I can go ahead and uncompress the tar.Z file and then untar the tar file
but that did not work with the new gcc2 files (3/25/92)...what I did was
boot up version 0.12 untar the files with no problems and then boot version
0.95a and run the inst2.0 script...but now I can't compile anything
even something like:
	gcc -o man man.c
hangs...again I can press ^C to cancel...I had been using the 3/15/92 version
of gcc2 with no problems until today...

I would appreciate any help on either of these problems...

Please don't.  If memory serves, the Minix software is copyright Prentice-
Hall or Andy Tanenbaum.  I don't think that Linux should have software

Subject: Sound Blaster for Unix: Version 2 released
Keywords: SB sound audio
Date: 27 Mar 92 05:36:46 GMT
Organization: Netcom - Online Communication Services  (408 241-9760 guest)

I've just posted the second release of a suite of Unix drivers
and applications for the IBM PC Sound Blaster card.  It will
also do synth stuff on the Adlib.

The full driver is a classic Unix character device driver.
It should port over easily to the two 386 BSD implementations;
I haven't looked Linux drivers so I don't know what you're in for.

I use it on AT&T V.3; it is loadable on ESIX.  SCO is unknown.  
It hangs the kernel on startup under on ISC 3.0; I don't know why.

Here's the README:


                         Sound Blaster(tm) Driver
                       (Copyright 1991, Brian Smith)

	Rewritten for Release 2 by Lance Norskog, March 1992

This is a driver and application suite for the Creative Labs'
original monophonic Sound Blaster card.  It should work on
other cards that claim to be SB-compatible, like the SB Pro,
MediaVision, etc.  (The Adlib synth chips are supported, but
you may have to comment out the SB DSP chip support if you
want to run the Adlib or Game Board cards.)

Version 1 of the driver & applications was written by Brian Smith 
(brians@rigel.cs.pdx.edu).  Pace Willisson (pace@blitz.com) rewrote
the driver for overall cleanliness and to use in-kernel buffering
to avoid the gottverdammter clicking problem. Independently, I
rewrote the assembler interrupt to attack this issue, and have
since merged my ugly hacks into Pace's very clean rewrite.
There's nothing new in the application suite except a program
to play a .INS file as a tone, just as a previewer.  

REQUIREMENTS

This driver and the associated user programs require a 386/486 system
running System V 3.2 Unix.  It has been tested on ISC Unix versions
2.0.2 through 2.2.1.  I believe it will work correctly on Esix, Intel,
and AT&T Unix.  SCO is a mystery to me (as well as many others).  I do
not believe it will work in SysV 4.0 and above, but the modifications
should be fairly minimal.  Remember, though, THERE IS NO WARRANTY.
As a character driver, it should port easily to Linux and the various
BSD 386 ports going on.  There is a Streams driver that presently
only does MIDI; this should port to V.4 easily.  It should also be
easy to port the sampling and FM synthesis parts of the driver
into the Streams version, but nobody's done it yet.

GENERAL INFORMATION

This driver is for the Sound Blaster sound card designed by Creative
Labs, Incorporated.  The Sound Blaster is a sound card for the
IBM-PC(tm) type I/O bus.  The card is capable of sampling sound from a
microphone jack from 4KHz to 23KHz (or 24KHz, depending upon which
portion of the manual you believe) at 8 raw bits of resolution.  It is
also capable of playing samples at speeds from 4KHz up to 12KHz.  The
board can play raw 8 bit samples, or 2 bit, 2.6 bit, or 4 bit ADPCM
packed samples.  ADCPM is a lossy method of data compression.  The
sampling and output may be directly driven by the CPU, or it may be
driven by DMA.  The card is also capable of playing music through an
on-board FM synthesizer chip.  The chip may play 9 simultaneous
instruments, or it can play 6 simultaneous voices with 5 additional
rhythm instruments.  In addition, the board (but NOT my driver) also
supports the addition of 2 C/MS chips. For more information, read the
advertising blurb, errr...  manual which comes with the Sound Blaster.

The driver is capable of utilizing only a subset of the capabilities
of the Sound Blaster card.  The driver is accessed through four
device nodes.

The /dev/sbdsp node accesses the DSP chip which controls sampling and
sample playback.  Only 8-bit sound is supported thus far.  The driver
utilizes DMA, and therefore is very unobtrusive to the system load.
The ls utility is harder upon the system.  Read(2) and write(2) upon
/dev/sbdsp sample sound and play back sound samples, respectively.
Several ioctl(2)'s control sampling/playback speed, resets, etc... 
The play_snd utility demonstrates the use of the /dev/sbdsp node.

The /dev/sbfm node accesses the FM chips.  The only access to the FM
chips are through ioctl(2)'s.  The play_cmf utility demonstrates the
use of the FM chips by (mostly) interpreting and playing CMF files.
The various options controlling the voices can be dumped from a CMF
file by the get_instruments utility.  Those familiar with synthesizers
can then learn how to create their own instruments.  

The /dev/sbcms node accesses absolutely nothing.  The C/MS chips are 
really awful, and Creative Labs is trying to forget it ever used them.

The /dev/sbmidi node does MIDI I/O if you have a MIDI dongle box
attached to the joystick port.  The driver reads & writes a longword
per MIDI byte, with the other 3 bytes giving a Unix time code.
There are no programs for this; read the driver.  The mfplay
program does not compile by itself.  It needs an old version
of TJ Thompson's 'midifile' library; it should be rewritten
for the recent 'mf2t' version of that library.

This driver is merely the rough outlines of what it could be.  Support
could be added for oodles of features, like efficiency improvements, and
ADCPM interpretion for the /dev/sbdsp node.  If you wish to add to this
driver, please be my guest (after reading the license file).  

The file sb.prog.doc gives the complete info on programming the
SB and SB Pro.  If you have an SB Pro and want to hear it do
stereo, you'll have to modify this software.  Please send in
your changes.

With Brian's consent, I have taken over as maintainer of this suite.
Please!  Send your fixes to me, and I'll integrate them, test them,

All-
  I have been having nothing but trouble getting pcomm to work.  I finally
got it to dial out now, however I get *no* echo back once connected!
(this also means no echo from the modem either, not even the OKAY after
the completion of a modem command).  I've tried going FULL/HALF duplex.
Any suggestions from anyone?
                      Thanks (in advance).

Organization: Bleeding Edge Technologies - 'Sliding Down The Razor Blade Of Life...'

OK, this is what I'd like to do. I'd like to build gcc on a SPARC,
but run it on a 386 running linux 0.95a.  I've built the stage 1
compiler (according to the INSTALL docs in the gcc-2.1 directory),
but am stumped when it tells me I don't have libgcc.a.  How do I build
this?

It seems that the GNU stuff is relatively well documented per-product,
but it completely lacks a document for GNU virgins.  Something like
"OK, I've ftp'd the GNU stuff from prep.ai.mit.edu - now what do I
do?"

If someone would like to email/call me and help me through this, I'd gladly
take notes, and write them up for a /pub/gnu/READ-ME.FIRST doc or something.
I guess I'm just totally confused.  I know generally what I have to do to
make a cross-compiler, but I'm not sure of the exact steps that you need to
do with GNU.

I'd like to install the following:

1.	gcc-2.1
2.	glibc-1.02
3.	gas-1.38

I assume that I need 2 built to build 1, right?  When I'm done' I'd like to
have, sitting on my SPARC (ready for download), executables for (say) an
i386-sysv system, so that I could tar them off/download them and be able to
compile stuff.

Thanks for your time and assistance.

Hi folks,
I've been giving linux a run. I AM impressed with the quality of of linux (good
work linus). However, I did come up with various problems here and there:
These happened will I was tryimg to compile alternative shells.
Ksh compiled without to many problems if you exclude job control.
On running though it was a bit flakey. when typing 'cd -' it output a random
character and linefeed before it works. This is quite cosmetic. Of a more
serious nature is that it can't handle & at the end of command line; it print
%6291404 29998 %%%-2d%c %5d %-20s % %s
-Oh} ${PATH:= blah, blah, blah
and then it dies! This used to work on minix by the way.
In trying to compile zsh, I had all sort of problems figuring out if linux
was SYSV or BSD or a mixture of both + POSIX that is not in either.
I found out that setpgrp is not an implemented system call (even the prototype
was wrong. -O caused unrecognized insn errors (anybody figure out why?)
Also no utmp.h
In other news today, the adduser package has a crypt.o which has no _crypt  and
refers to ufc_* functions not in the library. I'm using the libc.a that came
with newgcc. Is newlibc a more uptodate one?
Any finally for today, some commands, say mv mostly, output a couple of 
linefeeds and then a couple of prompts. is this a kernel or a shell problem?

Thanks for any hints, and keep up the good work,
Zeyd

[reposted as it didn't seem to make it into the newsgroup, or at least into

My mouse was getting fat from lack of exercise, so I have put together a
package that allows an area of text to be selected from any VC and
subsequently pasted to any VC. The package requires a Microsoft-compatible (I
think) *serial* mouse. I find it pretty useful; I've become dependent on
cut'n'paste under X, and missed it under Linux.

The package is in two parts; kernel patches (against standard 0.95a) to
tty_ioctl.c and console.c to implement the selection mechanism, and some
application code to implement the mouse driver and user interface.

I can't upload stuff to FTP sites, but will willingly post the package to
anybody who would like to try it out. selection.tar.Z.uue is about 10K.
If I get enough requests, I'll post it to this group instead, or someone could
upload it for me.

I would like to have a look at it, all versions I know are modified (read
hacked) in some ugly way.  Hopefully the original version is the solution
to the problem of a curses library.

After I got a basic system running, I started getting and compiling sources
for all these binaries I got.  At the moment, I am compiling the GNU textutils,
shellutils and fileutils.  I encountered a few minor problems:

-  After running the configure script, I deleted -g from the Makefile
-  I added -D_POSIX_SOURCE
-  A few commands must be compiled without -O because the optimizer
   dies with a strange error message
-  for one or two commands you have to link them with additional object files
   which are still missing in the library

That's all :)  But my main problem was building a new library to overcome
the last problem.  I know, I could just add the missing things to the lib
and run ranlib, but that's not the point.

At first, the Makefile has pretty weird variables set, for example for
-Iwhoknowswhatismeant.  Second, it will build a Libc.a, Libm.a and
Libtermcap.a.  I still wonder what is with libsoft.a and gnulib.  Any
hints?  Apart from that, I can't compile stdio, because I seem to have
only an estdio stdio.h.  So, these are my questions: Which libraries am I
supposed to have? What are libm.a, libsoft.a and gnulib for? What flags
have to be used with a 387, what flags have to be used without a 387?
Where can I get the newest include files? What is the newest version of
the library?  I am using GNU C 1.40.

After uncommenting the -fcombine-regs option I successfully recompiled
the kernel.  Then I applied the ps patches for 0.95 and only got one
problem with swap.c.  Just now it is late and I am awfully tired, and I
think I must have made something wrong because the kernel with patch
boots and after accessing the HD once, it instantly reboots.  I think I
made a mistake with patching swap.c, so it would be nice if someone
could send me his working version or post the concerned part.  If it
runs at my machine, I will create a new patch set for 0.95a and upload
it, if no one else wants to do it.

Thanks

I am thinking seriously about purchasing a PC-compatible system that is
large enough to handle the kind of UNIX and compiler development work I'm
doing.

Though I like to avoid cross-posting, I've done it here because I need the
special expertise of not only Linux aficionados, but "straight" PC users
(MS-DOS and/or MS-Windows) and PC-UNIX users as well, since what I'm doing
is trying to combine, probably for the first time in some cases, hardware
with new free software.  Definitive answers probably will be hard to come by,
of course, but perhaps I can learn enough by getting input from the various
camps to determine whether I'm likely to get various parts of the system
working under Linux.  (I'm also open to using other free UNIXes to which I
can contribute my volunteer-coding efforts, such as 386BSD, for example; or,
if someone wants to donate a proprietary UNIX for my immediate needs, that
would be fine, too. :-)

I'd like any input on whether/when Linux (or, generally, any arbitrary OS
running a 486 in 32-bit mode at 33MHz, etc) will be able to support various
parts of this system, especially the hard drive and the monitor.

Here's the machine configuration as it currently stands (not purchased yet):

Motherboard stuff:
    Tower case w/8 drive bays and 250-watt power supply
    Intel 32-bit 80486 CPU 33MHz
    64KB cache RAM standard (expandable to 256KB)
    Support for Weitek 4167-33 math co-processor (don't need the chip yet)
    AMI BIOS
    EISA-compatible standard system bus architecture
    16MB RAM (70ns) expandable to 64MB
    2 serial ports, 1 parallel port
    8 EISA slots (apparently each supports 32-bit EISA, 16-bit ISA/AT, 8-bit)

Disks:
    Adaptec AHA-1740 SCSI-2 controller
    Maxtor PO-12S 1.2GB SCSI-2 hard drive
    5.25" (1.2MB) internal floppy
    3.5" (1.44MB) internal floppy

Monitor:
    Sigma Designs L-View LVS-PC-1S01A (or thereabouts), 1664x1200 118dpi
        4-gray-scale monitor & card

Other stuff:
    101-key tactile keyboard (NMB RT-101+)
    3-button Microsoft-compatible serial mouse
    Cardinal 9650V42 9600 baud V.42 internal modem
    Panasonic FX-BM89 FAX board (9600 baud)

Offhand, I think the total cost for this system will be around $7500.  At the
moment that seems beyond my budget, but I figure I'll start with pretty much
my "ideal" system, find out what's technically wrong with it, work my way
"down" in cost (for example, a less-expensive and more-standard monitor, a
less-expensive HD, ISA instead of EISA, whatever).  Then I'll find some way
to finance the system once I've decided on what it should be.

The monitor is one of the areas I'm very concerned about.  The original
system I was looking at had an IBM 8507 20" monochrome VGA monitor plus
an SVGA adapter (Trident 8900 chipset), but the monitor seems kind of ugly
to me, and at 1024x768 (despite 64 shades) I don't think the resolution will
be quite up to snuff.  The L-View is much more expensive and I might not be
able to afford it, but I might try and save money elsewhere because a solid
monitor is _most_ important to me -- I'd rather spend $2000 on a monitor
(w/high-res card) for a $200 computer than vice versa, if the computer is,
as with this one, going to be my main system.  But, I don't know whether I'll
be able to get access to the lowest-level information on how to access the
device (i.e. lower than BIOS level), and without this information, obviously
I won't be able to write a driver for it.  So I'm going to call Sigma Designs
and see what they have to offer -- at least this monitor subsystem, unlike
another (less expensive and quite decent) subsystem I looked at, is still being
made and supported and having drivers written for it for lots of software,
which is a good sign.  I hope Sigma Designs recognizes the usefulness of making
it easy for free-software volunteers like myself to help them sell more
hardware!

(FYI, color might be nice, but I doubt I'll have any need for it for some time;
I'm _very_ happy with B&W, even 4 gray scales is a luxury I can forego.  Also,
being a Mac SE/30 user, and having also used NeXTs (4 gray scales) and other
systems with decent monitors, as compared to an IBM RT I had on loan for a
while with an IBM monitor and other such interlaced or just cheapo monitors,
I'm pretty much spoiled.  Even though my Mac has only a 9" screen and 72 dpi,
it's rock-solid.  The NeXTs are excellent with the 4 gray scales as well,
though the tendency of their MegaPixels or whatever to go out of focus pretty
much sours me on those systems.)

I've seen other postings asking about support for Adaptec controllers, though
not sure if the 1740 was mentioned.  Again, I expect to have to write a driver
for this thing, as well.

Similarly, for the mouse, modem, and FAX board, I expect I might have to
write drivers to use them under Linux.  Probably not for the keyboard and/or
mouse, or perhaps the modem, but almost certainly for the FAX board, though
using it under DOS will probably be adequate for quite some time.

Now, I'm not particularly averse to writing drivers, though doing this kind
of stuff on Intel machines is new to me.  (I've done OS internals work on
several machines, mostly Prime.)  In fact, in some ways, I'm kind of looking
forward to it.

So I recognize that I might well spend two or more _months_ just using DOS and
assemblers just to try and get drivers working so I can even _run_ Linux,
not to mention getting my _real_ work done (Fortran compiler development,
at the moment).

I could buy a more stock system and/or spend less on hardware and buy SCO
UNIX or some such thing.  But given that the free-software thing is happening
anyway, and I want to contribute to it (more than just by writing a Fortran
compiler -- rms asked me to do that when I came to him three years ago asking
if I could help write the GNU OS itself, and I even want to do my own OS
and related research), I figure I should go ahead and buy the _best_ hardware
I can for what I can afford, and solve the software problems via acquiring
and writing free software.

But, I'm worried that one or more of the components in my system will turn
out to be effectively impossible to get working under Linux, 386BSD, or
whatever, due to who-knows-what -- poor documentation, critical flaws in
the hardware (postings about 486's not working at 33MHz under Linux or in
32-bit mode worry me, for example), whatever -- and while I can't be
prescient about these things, I can at least ask you all!

One thing I'm aware of is that right now Linux doesn't support >64MB
partitions or >14-char filenames, though others might fix these things
("fix" being a very general term -- "provide enhancements for" is probably more
accurate, given Linux's evolution, as these aren't really bugs from what I
can tell), or I might fix them.  (I've hacked OS filesystems before.)

If any of you have information on the workability of various aspects of this
configuration, by all means send me email (burley@gnu.ai.mit.edu) and let
me know.  I'll probably summarize the info I get, and almost certainly post
info on my final decision as to what to do (which might include bailing out
for now and just buying a used NeXT to finish my Fortran work or upgrading
my Mac SE/30 to run UNIX for that purpose, and later looking into a PC-compat
for OS work -- but I hope that isn't necessary).
