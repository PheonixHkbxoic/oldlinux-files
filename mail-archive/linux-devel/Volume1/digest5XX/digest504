Well, the 8514/A and friends (and maybe all VESA-compliant cards)
have a Display Control Register DISP_CNTL at 0x22e8, bits 0 to 7.
A 1 in bit 5 enables the display and a 1 in bit 6 disables it.  This
register controls other display attributes--such as interlace--as well,
and it is write-only, so you will have to know something about the current
video mode--so you can restore it--before you fiddle with this register.

Subject: A driver for v3.4 Future Domain SCSI BIOS?
Date: 26 Feb 1994 13:16:57 -0600

I've always used Rickard Faith's v5.9 fdomain.c support, and it's worked
just wonderfully, so I got another Future Domain TMC-1680 for a new
system.  Unfortunately, the new card has a v3.4 BIOS (as opposed to my old
v3.2), and the fdomain.c driver doesn't recognize it.

This is my last ditch effort at finding someone who knows about this
problem, and I'm sure someone here must be able to point me in the right
direction.  I need a new version of Faith's fdomain.c driver, or some
other Future Domain support, or just a patch so that fdomain.c recognizes
the new BIOS.

Thanks for any help you can offer,

Hi !
With all those new processors around I would expect
Intel to come up with a 'real' RISC-Processor one day
exclusevely for the PC-Market. No 8086-Compatibility no nothing.
This probably would lead to the thing that 8086-compatible 
Processors will vanish from the market which in turn
would force us to migrate to another platform with Linux
that day.
So I think that porting to other architectures, e.g.
keeping the architecture-dependant parts of the kernal small
is the only way to ensure the future of Linux.

There are already two implementations:
        yp-linux
        NYS
The first one can be found in any Slackware source archive, while the
second one is (at least) available fron nic.funet.fi in /pub/BETA
yp-linux is a port of the NetBSD implementation, while NYS is written
from scratch and features service switching between files, nis, nis+ and
hesiod. But it is not yet completed and will force you to recompile all
affected binaries while the yp-linux support is included in libc since
release 4.5.x

Intel has already produced RISC processors without any 8086
compatibility, but nobody in PC business was fool enough to try to
build a PC with them. If a PC can't boot MSDOS, then it's not a PC :-)

They already have.  the i750, i860, and i960's are all nice risc 
microprocessors.  It's just that intel hasn't been pushing them in the pc
arena (their main useage seems to be in the large parrallel computing 
projects).

There's no problem with odd netmasks under Linux.  If you don't
specify a netmask, it will use the standard ones, but the fancy
byte-oriented guessing code is no longer present.  The only case I
know of where it will not deal with netmasks correctly is ICMP
redirects.  In that case there's no netmask present, so it will assume
the standard ones.  This is a bug.  It's supposed to redirect only the
host.  (I'll try to get that fixed.)

It would NOT have to be GPL'd as far as I know. If it did, Linux would have 
such silly licensing to be forever nothing but a toy. I sincerely hope that 
would not be the case.

Precedent:

NeXT wanted an Objective-C compiler, instead of the preprocessor that
Stepstone distributed at the time.  So, they wrote a bunch of
functions that when linked with the GCC source, produced an
Objective-C compiler.

They distributed these as .o files, not giving out the source code.
Anyone who wanted to could modify the actual GCC source, link it with
the Objective-C .o files, and get a new Objective-C compiler.  But you
weren't allowed to distribute the .o files or the final, linked
binary.

The FSF got mad and their lawyers contacted NeXTs lawers, or something
like that.  In the end it was determined that since you couldn't use
those .o files without linking them to GPLed sources, they were
obviously a derivative work and so they fell under the GPL as well.

The result: NeXT was forced to release their Objective-C compiler
under the GPL.  That's why GCC includes an Objective-C compiler today.

That's my understanding, yes.  So, you should be *really* careful to
make sure you just use POSIX interfaces.  Then there should be no
problem.

Please, tell me, what does "get anywhere in the world on a serious

Why should I, as a simple computer hobbyist, care if Linux ever does
this?  I'm more concerned with making sure *I* have the source code to
everything I can possibly get the source code for.

Greetings,

I am learning to code in C under linux SLS 1.03 0.99.pl14 with

through the O'Reilly & Associates Book "Practical C" the program
listings compile fine without a -g flag. However, gcc -g ???.c
causes all kinds of problems. Bellow is an example from Chpt 6,
on page 75.

I am seriously thinking about trashing this whole installation and downloading
the Slackware 1.1.3 distribution. Do you think that might be my problem?
Somewhere in all the upgrading to this system something my have got crossed up.
However, I have downloaded many programs sources which have compiled succes-

At the moment the kernel supports a READ-ONLY HPFS file system. You'll need

This seems to be a bug in the scsi driver.

We reported it here about some months ago, after we had verified it's
reproducibility.

Eric Youngdale, who did work inside the code, stated that this behaviour
would come through old and/or defective hardware.

We could reproduce the effect on the following different configurations

our access) with different versions of linux:
