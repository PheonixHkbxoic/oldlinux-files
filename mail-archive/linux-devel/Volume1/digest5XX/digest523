Dean, you're not alone.

I started using Linux about a year ago with SLS, before I and many others

Rather than politely either answer the question, or point out where the

They drove a lot of people away from Linux, to either BSD or a commercial
*nix, or back to DOS or OS/2, somewhere else where they can get help by
asking, rather than getting trashed. This is Not a Good Thing(tm), and if
it continues (as it will, no doubt, in at least some quarters), it will
ultimately hurt Linux.

I hope this doesn't happen because I happen to like Linux a lot, and want
it to succeed as more than just a hobbyist OS with a small but devoted and
sometimes overzealous club of acolytes. I'd like to see some heavy-hitting
commercial AND free/shareware developed for it, and have it become a 
major player in the Unix market. But it's slowly gaining a reputation 
that it's got to shake soon, or it will die out.

I also have to agree.  As a group we need to inculcate a more helpful attitude
for newbies (on public channels like this one).  Of course private maillists
are quite a different matter (I've been trodden under with my own ignorance

Well other are sick and tire of people asking questions without reading
the docs first. The FIRST line of the release note says "IF YOU MISS ONE
LINE IN THIS RELEASE THE LIBRARY WILL NOT WORK FOR YOU". How much clearer
can things get. It questionable s to what wastes more resources: people
who ask questions that are already answered, or those who flame them for
not doing their homework before openning their (proverbial) mouths.

There is such thing as nettiquette. People are supposed to read any available
docs, and browse through the group before asking questions. The flame wasn't
as directed at Junk, who by then had figured out the answer, but others who
are inclined to ask questions that have been answered repeatedly.

To run COFF binaries, you need only the COFF loader. To run iBCS programs, you
need the iBCS emulator. The iBCS emulator is being developed. If you wish
the development version of the code, then please join the developer's mail
list. Instructions for joining the mail list may be obtained by sending
an email message to "linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi" with the
text of "help".

The channel for iBCS is called IBCS2.

Being able to run COFF binaries is probably not going to get you very much
additional functionality. It is the iBCS compatability that you are truely
seeking. (I say this because just having the COFF loader is pretty
usless in itself. It is like having the ELF loader. Only when they are
taken in concert with the emulator do they become useful; at the present
time, of course.)

Just if anyone wondered, what all the magic code around the clock
support (sched.c) and the _adjtimex() system call does: The new RFC 1589
documents this time and frequency PLL control code. It allows
to gradually adjust the time offset as well as the frequency of
the system clock to a reference clock (e.g. a radio time normal
or a network time normal as with NTP). This allows to let the
Linux clock tick with very high precision according to the official
time.

I do not know about the other older versions, but with 0.99pj I 
can switch on and off the caps-lock-LED on my keyboard only...

...it has no influence on the letters, they are always lowercase...

I might not have noticed earlier since I use it so seldom... Normaly
the SHIFT-key does the job :-)

Is this a common problem with 0.99p15j?

Subject: AMD 486DX problem (with Linux?)
Date: 05 Mar 1994 05:42:38 GMT


        I have found an annoying problem with the AMD 486DX chip and
Linux that is leading me to believe that there may be a compatibility
problem with this chips math functions.  One reported symptom is
that ghostscript dies during initialization. While trying to track
down the problem I booted my kernel with the no387 option (using Lilo).
To my surprise ghostscript worked in this configuration.

        I decided to investigate further, and found a problem with
single precesion (ie float) multiplys.  The following is a sample
program that illustrates the problem.

---cut here-----------------------cut here-------------------------cut here---

main()
{
  float a=1.3125;
  float b=7.9999;
  double x= 1.3125;
  double y= 7.9999;
  
  printf ("%f * %f =", a, b);
  a *= b;
  printf ("%f\n", a);

  printf ("%f * %f =", x, y);
  x *= y;
  printf ("%f\n", x);

  if (a != (float)x)
  {
        printf("Test Failed, this must be an AMD 486DX chip!\n");
  }
  else
  {
        printf("Test succeeded!\n");
  }
}

---cut here-----------------------cut here-------------------------cut here---

This is the output that I obtained on my system:

% ./amdtest
1.312500 * 7.999900 =10.499990
1.312500 * 7.999900 =10.499869
Test Failed, this must be an AMD 486DX chip!
%

        The correct answer is 10.499869 rounded off.  It certainly is
not 10.499990. The a *= b gave an erroneous result.  I thought that I
may have a defective chip. So I tried running some coprocesser
diagnostic software obtained on the net.  Of course the chip passed
all the test. FYI I tried CHKCOP ver 2.20 from Intel, 87TEST from
Microway and MCPDIAG from Advance Computer Graphics.

        I also looked through some old news postings to see if anyone else
might be having these problems.  There were a few posts suggesting
that some people are having problems with ghostscript.  Perhaps all
of these people had AMDs also.

        Anyways, I was hoping that someone else with an AMD 486DX
could verify that this is an AMD problem (or whether it is just
limited to me :( ).  If someone also had another OS/Compiler
combination to ensure that this is not just a AMD486DX/GCC/Linux
problem.

For those interested my configuration is:

AMD 486DX/40
AMI Enterprise III EISA/VESA MB
ADAPTEC 1542B controller
16MB RAM

Linux 0.99.15 & 0.99.15h
gcc 2.5.8
libc 4.5.21

Any help, advice or solutions would be appreciated

Greg.

TIOCLBI[CS] are BSD-specific tty modes, as you've no doubt surmised.
It's been a number of years since I've hacked this stuff, but my
recollection is that none of these modes are unique to the BSD, i.e.,
there are equivalent modes in the Sys-V and POSIX (Linux uses the
POSIX interface) tty drivers.  I know that LLITOUT is equivalent to
turning off OPOST in termios->c_oflag.  You'll have to get ahold of
the man page for tty(7), and possibly stty(1) from a BSD system, find
the modes used with TIOCLBI[CS], then map them onto the POSIX
equivalents found in the termio (or is it termios?) man page.  Hmm, it
seems I don't seem to have one here on my system, so I don't know if
Linux even has a termio man page...  If not, the POSIX ioctl interface
is derived from System-V, so in a pinch you can probably get by with a
System-V version.

 Bah Humbug.  I installed numerous PC Floppy drives in Amiga computers and

 the hardware of the controller, part of the Amiga's custom chipset.  The PC
 controller just cannot access the floppy drive in the same manner that the
 Amiga chipset can.
