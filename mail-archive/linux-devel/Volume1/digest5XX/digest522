   I'm in the process of porting PCLU to Linux.  I've gotten
most of it to compile but now I'm stuck with a few undeclared 
constants.  TIOCLBIS and TIOCLBIC are the most troublesome.
On an Ultrics system, these constants are defined in 
/usr/include/sys/ioctl.h.  I also noticed the constants TIOCGETC
and TIOCSETC in this header file.  On my Linux system TIOCGETC and
TIOCSETC are defined in /usr/include/bsd/sgtty.h.  I'm not sure what
TIOCLBIS and TIOCLBIC are used for, but here are the comments from the
ultrix includ file.

#define TIOCLBIS _IOW('t', 127, int)     /* Bis local mode bits */
#define TIOCLBIC _IOW('t', 126, int)     /* Bic local mode bits */


This is one of the lines of code that uses TIOCLBIS.

ioctl(ch->wr.num, TIOCLBIS, LLITOUT)



The only other constant that is undefined is F_OK.

This constant is defined to be 0 in the Ultrix file.h header and is
used to tell if a file exists.  This is the line of code where it is used.


acc = access(fname.str->data, F_OK);


Thanks for any advise on this project.

I recently installed an ultrastor 22f in my computer.  This is
an eisa esdi controller card.  The ultrastor SCSI driver detects
this card and thinks it is a SCSI card, and crashes the machine.
This happened with the slackware boot disk.  If anyone is interested
in more infomation about this bug, contact me.

You must have missed that this newsgroup is about "Ongoing work on the
Linux operating system", not about asking questions.  That largely explains
the attitude towards people asking questions anyway, especially when they
are so clearly answered in the read.me file that came with the package
that they are asking about...

I was warned by my boss about this.  Apparently, the 3c509 has a tiny
buffer on the card, as opposed to something infinitely more useable (2k ?), and
you will get all kinds of problems with overruns in the buffer.  It makes sense
that you have problems with big transfers.

This was his experience using this card with packet drivers in D*S.

I bought a 3c503 card instead.  I heard it has a more adequate buffer.

Please discuss.

IBM is currently marketing an ISDN card for PCs (both ISA-bus and MCA).
It is named the Waverunner.  You might have the company check this out 
before investing development money into another one.  As memory serves,
the Waverunners retail somewhere in the $500 range.  E-mail me if you would
like more info.

I dont't know if ioperm() is really a library function but as for
inb() and outb() they are defined as inline functions. You will have
to compile with the -O switch, otherwise you will get the unresolved
symbols you mentioned. I have been using these functions successfuly
to interact with some special hardware on my machine.
Dont't forget to include <asm/io.h> (I'm using Slackware 1.1), where
they are declared, and to run your binary as root.
Hope this helps.

Hee hee.  Since when have legal definitions of words necessarily agreed with
English definitions?  And in the case of a word that has multiple definitions,
does the legal wording cover all definitions, or merely the definition that
applies in context?  This is why some legal papers can spend most of the
time defining words and limits of the definitions!  Whole legal cases have
been argued over the definition of a word.  And to make things harder, the
English definitions can change over time (eg "Gay").

I'm sure that if someone took the GPL and scrutinized it according to strict
English definitions, they would get a conclusion that is not the correct one
understood in law.

Some. It's hardware, so everything I say must be qualified with a
disclaimer. (I did say "should"...)

However, I would guess from the complete lack of existing software
(including specialized DOS programs to tweak the hardware like exist
for Mac floppies) that there's at least one big problem I don't know
about. :-) 

The strange stuff the trackdisk.device does should be possible with PC
hardware, unless that hardware is even less capable than I thought. If
the Amiga does something else, like write more tracks than the average
PC drive can access, I don't know about it.

Yes, I have. It's amazing that it can be done at all, however
poorly... :-)

  We have been running our linux boxes mainly on 3c509's.  We encounter the
problem you talk about quite frequently.  Our linux File Server gives out these
messages because of the high traffic it receives.  We also have a linux box
set up to run a MUD, and it regularly has 50-60 mud users on it (yes its
a popular one, Highlands I think).  It also complains about transmit time
out errors.  I did some debugging/testing on the card and I didn't find a 
problem with Donald's driver.  I also talked with 3com and they said that
it isn't the cards fault, its the driver.  
  I haven't tried out the 15i release yet, but the 3c509 is not suitable for 
high traffic lans.  We had a linux box on our busiest subnet here and it 
choked.

True, you will always get this message if you try to ftp to a local machine.
It is especially bad between two linux boxes both with 3c509's in them.  I end
up getting about 50K per second between two linux boxes because the cards seem
to get really confused talking to each other.  My guess is that it is a
hardware problem.

I am having some major problems getting my little mini-network
setup.  I have two identical WD80x3 cards (10baseT), and I have

Memory = 0xCC00

I get this no matter what but only on one machine, the
other seems fine.

I think this card is a 16K card, since the DOS config for it lets
me set it at that (it is used, don't have any manuals).

I have two computers, identical except one has 8 megs , the other 4 megs.
The 4 meg machine crashes regularily if I try to ping it from the
8 meg machine, however the 8 meg machine never crashes regardless
of what I do.

In fact I can make the 4 meg machine crash by trying to rlogin or
ping from the 8 meg machine.  Both are running the same kernel.

here is my hosts file:

I eventually figured out that the problems that I was having was
hard-ware related.  I went to the dianostic part of the CMOS setup
for the card, the card failed  4 of 5 memory tests, so I put the
cards memory from the low of 0xCC00 to 0xDD00.           

And now all of a sudden everything works great.
