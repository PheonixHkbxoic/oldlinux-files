mmap() isn't yet fully implemented. You can only map a file
read-only or with Copy-On-Write. You have of course discovered it by
yourself.

>To make it short:
>I NEED a mmap() that supports read/write and MAP_SHARED.

It is possible, but I think the biggest problem is, that you have to
change some basic functions of memory management, which is of course a
very critical part of the code.

>Is there something in the linux memory system that prevents such a mmap()
>functionality?

The problem is to synchronize the memory with the file. File buffers has
always to be marked dirty, when someone writes on the memory of the
mapped file. Ok, this can be done in a write protection fault handler.
But after the buffer is written on the disk, it is marked clean and the
memory pages must be set back to read-only again. This functionality
has to be implemented. But I'm not a Guru, there could be a simpler
solution.

There is System V Shared Memory, it works.

I have to start my senior project next quarter.  I thought I might
do something with Linux.  It's for a BS in computer engineering and
is supposed to last 6 months.  Any suggestions would be greatly
appreciated, (ie Write device drivers for XXX, etc).  Please let
me know the relative difficulty of the project, if you know. Also, 
my funds are limited so I won't be able to spend too much on hardware.
I'm running Linux on a 386DX-33 with a Trident Video card, no math-
coprocessor.

If anyone has any ideas please send them to pbaleme@joule.calpoly.edu
E-mail please, I don't get a chance to read this group that often.

Subject: Can I extract kernel form scsiboot.gz?
Date: 9 Mar 94 21:49:57 MDT


my system is a 486-33 
8 Meg memory
dos/os2/linux partitions
IDE hard-drive controller (1 hard drive 2 floppy)
Ataptec AHA-1520/1522 SCSI ver 1.4  for Texel cdrom drive
SMC network card  wd80??
sound blaster card
trident 8900c

I installed Slackware from ftp.cdrom.com

using a floppy with rawrite -> scsiboot and color177 
I installed the A series and X, everything works great.

However the kernel installed during setup 
has Mitsumi cdrom support which pretends 
to detect a cdrom at the same IRQ =11 where 
my SCSI would like to be.

I boot using scsiboot floppy and typing 
mount root=/dev/hda6
and then inserting the color177 disk when prompted

Should I learn to compile my own kernel, or 
can I somehow extract the kernel, that I like, from the rawritten
scsiboot disk?

Subject: ircII compilation problems - Fix!
Date: 10 Mar 1994 16:03:37 GMT

I fought with trying to get ircII2.2.9 to compile on Linux 99.14+ for
about a week until I saw the Makefile from another person who hadn't
had any problems. Every time I would try to compile I was getting a
error reported from ld: libl missing. I use irc over ppp, he uses it
over term as a side note. After comparing our makefiles, I had to
change the LEX= line from lex to flex and the LEX_DEFINE= line from
-ll to no arguments.

I also added CFLAGS of -O and -m486 and removed -g, which resulted in
a ~300K binary instead of over 2MB. Hope this helps.

Subject: Amiga File System, once again
Date: 10 Mar 1994 10:06:54 GMT

I've been reading for some time the discussion about implementing an
Amiga File System for Linux. It seems that all the discussion has 
centered around such a file system for ix86-Linux. Other than the 
fact that this is probably possible, I see no reason why such a 
file system is needed. PC users don't need an Amiga file system, and 
the rest of us who have Amigas can use CrossDos(tm) or MSH, or some
other transfer system to create a PC-readable disk. So on the PC side,
an Amiga file system is kindof useless.

The big question (and I think this was probably the main point of the 
original post) is whether an Amiga file system will be written for Amiga
Linux. While it is true that we can use msdos disks, most disks that 
are owned by Amiga owners aren't formated msdos, ext2, or even minix, but
as amiga. It would be really nice if we could mount our amiga floppies
and hard disk partitions in Amiga Linux. I don't really see why this would
be very difficult (though I am not volunteering to do it :).

So how about it... are there plans for an amiga file system for Amiga Linux?

Date: 10 Mar 1994 13:33:08 -0500


Is there a driver available for  the  NEC 16-bit AT SCSI Host Adapter and
the Toshiba 4101b CD-ROM, and if not, can one of the existing drivers
be used?

The NEC 16-bit AT SCSI Host Adapter uses no IRQ or BIOS ROM out of
the box, but contains jumpers and switches to use IRQs 3,5,7,10,12,14, and 15,
and BIOS ROM addresses C*000h, CA000h, CE000h, D0000h, D4000h, D8000h, or
DC000h.  Its a SCSI-2 interface, and the software that comes with it
(for those useless, non-linux OS's) claims it meets the ASPI standard 
proposed by Adaptec (and there are drivers for Adaptec).

The CD-ROM is a double speed drive that groks Red Book, Yellow Book, 
CD-ROM XA, Photo CD, CD Bridge, and CD-I ready (whatever those mean).

Thanks,
Jim

'tcpspray' has a major bug in it, and the reading process will
segmentation fault on any reasonable unix implementation if the program
can't keep up with the data that comes in (so you usually don't see the
problem on fast machines or when testing against slower machines). 

The problem is that 'tcpspray' calls read() with a buffersize argument
that is larger than the buffer allocated: there are two lines that look
something like this:

        if ((cnt = read(sock, buf, bytes_left)) == -1)  {
                                   ^^^^^^^^^^

and they should both be changed to:

        if ((cnt = read(sock, buf, blksize)) == -1)  {
                                   ^^^^^^^

for it to work correctly (EFAULT would probably be a cleaner return
value than a segmentation fault, but checking the memory space
completely for each read() would be rather inefficient, and I'd rather
penalize buggy programs than the default case).
