Well seeing I was the one who posted the original artical I would like to
saw I don't have the money for sometime like LynxOS or QNX. Nor do I have the money
for another architecture.

In addition I have a TON of software I am using in my project that hasn't been ported
to these other o/s's . You know it's kind of funny, but I am finding very esoteric
software not likely to be used by others has already been ported to Linux.

Anyway I have not got a single positive response to my question about drivers for a/d
boards. Actually I am looking at using my sound blaster for real-time control. I have
a sound blaster 16 with the asp chip. I was thinking for downloading my control
program to the board and let it do all the realtime stuff. I need the get the specs to
see if this would work. Plus it would be far cheaper that most a/d boards. The a/d
board that I currently own, a National Instruments AT-MIO-16, cost roughly $1000.00.
I guess I would need the see the specs for the front end amplifiers to see how noisy
they are, what sort of programmable gain there is, harware filtering, coupleing, ...
etc. But for low frequency work with 2 channel in and 2 channel out this should be a
cheap solution. In addition if you could run more that I card, it would be great!

Any ideas?

As someone else has already mentioned, there seems to be a
problem of some sort with the NE*000 probe.  My system worked
fine with 0.99pl15j but it won't work with the new v1.0 :-(

It just hangs immediately after the `Net2 debugged' messages.

[I have the umsdos patches installed as well, if that makes any
difference].

Anyone have any idea how to fix this?

        Not true.  On 28 Feb 94, in message <robertl.762402975@amsg>,
Robert Lipe, head code-layer for Arnet (his phrase), a "ports board"
company, speaking unofficially but apparently referring to some of his
company's products, said:

                "As proprietary as these executables is the
                interface as to how a programmer talks to them."

        In context, "executables" refers to the onboard code, and
"interface" is the hardware interface used by the host computer's
operating system device drivers.  Thus, since they do not wish to
reveal the host-side interface, a GPLed OS device driver is
unacceptable to them.

Hello Netters!

I have noticed that SyQuest has released a new version of their 3.5" 
removable media hard drive. Does anyone know if this unit is supportable 
already by linux or does anyone think it will require newly written support?

I am very interested in obtaining one of these units and my linux system 
would benefit greatly with more hard disk space. My drive is presently at 
94% occupancy.

The latest slackware release will install in an msdos filesystem with at 
least 20Mb free (if memory serves) so no need to partition if you are 
just trying linux out.

        Uhh.. it seems to me that most (if not all) Unix IP implementations
        are based on that ridiculous idea of correct configuration.

        There is nothing in BSD net/2 preventing you from sending packets to
        127.1 to the network.  And the BSD is the culprit of this silly idea
        of local net, 127.0. 

        I just tested this on two net/2 based systems (namely, OSF 1.3 and
        AmiTCP/IP).  Both require you to say "ifconfig lo0 127.1".  Both
        send packets to 127.2 happily to default router.  SunOS 4.1 and
        HP-UX 9 route 127.2 to default router, too.  I guess that they are
        not conforming to RFC 1122.

Now that I think about it, if multiprocessors become commodity items,

much easier to implement a multi-processor system (with as many as 3
or 4 CPUs) using a master-slave arrangement where CPU 0 runs all of
the kernel code--it owns all the devices and services all system
calls.  The slave CPUs are scheduled to run user code only.

This straw poll had more respondents than 95% of all newsgroup
votes... As this is a straw poll and I'm just the polltaker, I am not
even going to try to analyze what the results "mean."  I suspect we'll
see lots of that in news.groups over the next few weeks.  However, I
will note that by Guidelines result methods, both col.admin and
col.development automonitoring would "pass" if this had been an
official vote.  -- Ron


This vote was conducted by a neutral third party.  For voting
questions only contact rdippold@qualcomm.com.  For questions about the
proposal contact Ian Jackson <iwj@cam-orl.co.uk>.


PROPOSAL (Ian)

[ Ian indicated during the polling period that Subject keywords would
be acceptable for software that couldn't handle Keywords headers.
However, I haven't tampered any with the original polling text. -- Ron ]

 I propose to set up an auto-response daemon which will scan the
 newsgroups  comp.os.linux.misc, .help, .development and .admin.

 It will send email to the posters of any messages which either
  (a) do not include one of a set or recognised keywords in the
      Keywords line or
  (b) are crossposted between two or more of the groups listed above,
      without a Followup-To header being used to direct followups
      into no more than one of those groups (plus perhaps one or more
      groups outside the comp.os.linux hierarchy).

 The email will be a brief, friendly introduction to the newsgroup in
 question and the hierarchy in general - probably based on Matt Welsh's
 introduction to the comp.os.linux hierarchy and my daily postings in
 comp.os.linux.misc and .help.

 It will say where the FAQs are, why to read them, and where to get
 them.

 It will also say why the message has been sent to the user, and give a
 brief explanation of why Keywords are a good thing and/or why
 crossposting is a bad thing (as appropriate).

 I would determine the set of allowable keywords with assistance from
 the Linux community; I expect the set to change quite frequently, and
 there to be a dozen or two at most.

 The existence of my daemon would be documented in a regular posting to
 the groups (preferably as part of an existing regular posting).

 Note that this proposal will NOT prevent anyone from posting and does
 not involve marking the groups as moderated.                         
                                                                      
 I hope to be able to provide an email-to-news gateway that will be   
 allow users with retarded software to post with Keywords lines.      


 RATIONALE (Ian)

 During the recent discussion in news.groups regarding my original
 proposal to moderate col.* using a program, several people suggested
 that perhaps many of the "poor" posts do not come from first-time
 posters, and that therefore it would be sufficient to send email to
 posters whose postings did not have one of a set of approved keywords.

 Doing so would allow experienced users to start using killfiles to
 read only postings they believe they would find interesting, based on
 keywords, since any users posting without such keywords would be
 informed by the daemon that and why their posting might not get the
 attention they would wish for it.


Since the Ack List is huge and this is a Straw Poll, I'm just going to
post it to news.groups as a followup so it won't swap those of you who
follow the Linux groups via modem. -- Ron
