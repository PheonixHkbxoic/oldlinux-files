Thanks to the gcc-2.4.5 info pages and the Linux GCC-faq, I now have a
working cross-compiler on my sun4c machine which generates nice code
for my Linux box at home.  Many thanks to those who made building the
cross-compiler possible (and not all that painful).

Now, there's only one thing holding me back from trading my Linux
development kit for TeX (limited diskspace on the home box); kernel
builds.  as86/ld86 to be precise.  I checked into the original bin86
and the recently released bin86-0.1 distributions, and see that
cross-compiler support is desired, but not implemented.

I'm not likely to undertake the project myself at this time, but I
tought it was worth a public query.

Anyone got a working cross-compiler version on sun4c or other
big-endian machine?  Can I have a look at the mods?

I know that it works like that.  Of course there is always a level where
programming is easy.  (like calling BIOS on a PC, or accessing /dev/hda
in Linux)
Of course there are DMA channels and disk controllers on a 370, and they
need to be controlled by code as well.  To be on a comparable level, you
should talk about the (micro)code that makes the channel processors
do their work...

Subject: Re: effectiveness of cache ram?
Date: 7 Mar 1994 23:01:13 GMT

If anyone's interested I have run the following tests.
SHASTA based system 486DX2 66 16MB RAM (4*4MB Simms) compilation of Linux kernel via NFS
LAN Adapter NE2100 clone.
compile time 28 minutes.
SIS EISA based system 486DX2 66 16MB RAM (1*16MB Simm) compilation of same kernel via NFS
LAN Adapter NE2000 clone.
compile time 23 minutes.

BTW the EISA board has 256k Cache RAM. In my eyes the SHASTA based machine should
have the upper hand, after all it's got a bus master based LAN card but still it
was substantially slower than the EISA board. Under DOG/Windows the SHASTA shows
up to be the quicker of the two when running various benchmarks.
I should have rather gotten 8 * 1MB simms and tested that as well since at this
stage the SHASTA only has one bank of RAM ie. no interleaving, but the same is
true for the EISA board.

At the end of the day, as far as I'm concerned CACHE RAM can be a good thing
if implimented correctly, the SHASTA based board however can also perform
quite well and is, at least in this country, substantially cheaper than the
SIS EISA board. Having run various benchmarks in the past has shown me that
the SIS board is one of the quicker around.
If anyone's interested I will conduct more tests and post the results.

Well, in a word: yes!

For a somewhat longer explanation: there isn't really something like PC  
DMA or disk controllers. On a 370, you use "channels" (I/O coprocessors)  
by giving them a "channel program" (a linked sequence of data transfer  
commands, somewhat like the Mac SCSI Manager). Then you simply start those  
and wait for completion. I/O addressing works by every device having one  
12-bit-address, which is used for communication with the channel.

The channel then does all the ugly details for you.

Hi, i'm using linux to connect two LANs, i need to spread RIP information

that i've tryed to compile gated and nothing, there's allways some error.
It seems to me that gated and linux don't work together.

Have a look in /proc/uptime -- the first number is the number of seconds
that the system has been up.

If you really want to grub around in the kernel, 'jiffies' contains the
number of clock ticks since the system has been up, and the clock ticks
every 1/100 second.

BTW: Now that /proc/kstat exists to read the cpu states from which the
     idle time can be calculated, does /proc/uptime also need to have
     the idle time in it?  I would say not.

Hi,

As the subject line says, I need the time, when the system was started to calculate time differences since system start up.

I need the kernel-variable, has the startime
SUN-OS delivers the starttime in the kernel-variable "_boottime".

What is the similar name in Linux ?

I checked only the manual for the main board and asked the person who installed

The test program was successful but buggy:
The cast in the final test is double to float and should be float to double!

Same here.  However, I did look at the source (not too thoroughly, though :)
and I *think* that the package is non-preemptive.  P-threads stands for
POSIX (1003.?, I think) thread package.  As such, it seems to use setjump/
longjump to switch context.  Reschedule seems to be called from within the
p-thread kernel (syscalls, etc,) or manually (on heavily compute-bound
threads.)  It would be very interesting to verify whether it is true.

If the package really *is* non-preemptive, it would be very interesting to 
add pre-emption.  As a matter of fact, I might actually do just that (if I
manage to find the time--not very likely :( .)  Anyone interested to give a 
hand?[1]

I haven't tried to compile or even run them on a big-endian machine,
but from what I remember from the source, endianness should not be a
problem, since the programs never write ints directly to a file, but
use conversion functions. You may have to change a few defines, though.
