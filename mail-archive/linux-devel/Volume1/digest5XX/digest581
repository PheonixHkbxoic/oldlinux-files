Look for it under /usr/lib/gcc-lib/*/*/include/; the method of argument
passing is compiler specific, and GnuC consequently puts the relevant
header files into its own directory. That include directory is searched
before /usr/include and other include directories.

This note doesn't have enough information to diagnose the problem.
Network changes in the patches after 1.0 have been fairly minimal.  I
use SLIP without any trouble.  I just FTP'ed the kernel both
directions using 1.0.4, and it was fine.  Retrieving it was quite
smooth.  Sending it involved some retries.  However the terminal
server I'm using is incrementing its overrun count, so this seems to
be the fault of the terminal server.  At least Linux retries are
working properly.

Unfortunately this message doesn't contain enough information to do
any diagnosis.  I will say that systems like this are complex enough
that it's easy to draw incorrect conclusions.  I thought Linux had
broken TCP in going from pre-1 to 1.0.  However further investigation
made it clear that for some reason my terminal server had started
dropping characters more often.  That seemed to be a one-time thing:
further experience with 1.0 and 1.0.x has been pretty much the same as
late 0.99pl15.

I do think there's a possible problem in dealing with some PC TCP
implementations.  However so far no one has sent me any packet traces,
so there's nothing I can do about it.

There is an important omission in moddev-0.1 README file.
The lines to add to rc.local should be
/sbin/insmod /sbin/moddev.o
modload &

The README file omitted the "&" --- booting will not finish!!!
It did say modload runs in the background, which subtley implies
that the "&" is needed.

That is why one should ALWAYS have a fall back method of rescuing
one's system.

Hello Linux-World!

I have to apologize for my postings about TCP-problems with the
1.0-kernel. Sorry!
The evil-doer was the syslogd-daemon from the net-std package. Without
these daemon running all works fine. Just for interest: does somebody

The problem is not only whith ftp, but whith any program. The network works
proprely whith 1.0.4 between 2 linux boxes on Ethernet, but as soon as I
connect an Annex terminal server whith SLIP or PPP, these connexions
work randomly; I can telnet or rlogin or ftp or anything whith no problem,
but receiving data blocks. A "cat" of a text file may show the first lines,
then stop for a few minutes, then restart or hang definitively...

The /proc stats may show errors on the sl0 interface, or may not. :(

Whith plain 1.0 (or the last  patches before 1.0) it use to work really well.

I don't know which 1.0 patch broke it, since I have been running 1.0 for
10 days, trying 1.0.? whith no problems on my second machine, which does not 
SLIP... I realized the problem when, after 10 days, I had to reboot the other
machine because of a stupid hardware problem, and decided to upgrade it
to 1.0.4 in the same time. It seems that Carl Schott has the same problems
starting whith 1.0.2...

I thought about a serial problem, but anything else using the modem works
as well as before. So I'm back to 1.0 whith this machine :-(

stdarg.h is (should be...) here:

/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.5.8/include/stdarg.h

If the compiler is proprely installed, just #include <stdarg.h> should
work; GCC knows about his local includes.

Using varargs is obsolete and you really should use stdarg if you write
new code. Anyway, your original code using varargs compiles and works
under Linux as well; I have just tried it. (Gcc 2.5.8 and libs 4.5.21)

If it does not for you, I suggest you get the original development packages
built by H.J.Lu, on your favourite mirror site...
(Generally found in ...../packages/GCC )

I think there is a problem with ifconfig somehow.
I use a very old ifconfig and it works fine (1.0.4 kernel).
Newer version retrieved this week does not work.  Weird...

Answer 1: Because we want to avoid kernel bloat.
Answer 2: Because a user process could give an arbitrary amount of scrollback,
        possibly using buffering on disk, while it would not be exactly easy
        (or clean) to make the keyboard interrupt routine access a disk file
        or swap space.
        Moreover, as soon as you have arbitrary scrollback, you'll want to search
        for a string, dump parts of the screen to a file, etc.

Interesting. I have not noticed any difference between 1.0, 1.0p2 and 1.0p3.
My SLIP runs as usual and ftp works.

Well, as one guy pointed out you should use stdarg not vararg (stdarg is what
my example came from.  For Linux/Suns and HP-UX just include <stdarg.h>
(Not sure which HP-UX version this is, but want to think something like 9
 but its running on a hp9000s700 - hprisc machine) and you should be set.
I was able to find va_list and va_dcl in varargs.h (which is what stdarg.h
includes on HP-UX).  Includeing stdarg.h should solve the problem on both 
systems.

Don't know about a more complete set of header files, as Slackware should have
all the standard header files that come with libc.  As for man pages, don't know
which manual page set slackware is giving, but I think in the doc directory on
sunsite.unc.edu there is a manpage file that contains a whole slew of them
(can't remember the exact location right now though).

Well, I normally don't get into these OS-religious flames, but you
obviously haven't thought this through very much.  The problem isn't so
much that the operating system forces 8.3 but that non 8.3 filenames break
the existing _applications_.  I use both dos and linux, and writing a
device driver for DOS that would hook the various dos services interrupts
and provide bigger filenames would probably only be a long weekend hack. 
But too many applications would break for it to be useful.  DOS isn't
perfect (far from it), but it is fairly extendable.

Subject: Kernel crash under load
Date: Sat, 26 Mar 94 23:04:46 GMT

While running my systtem under extreme load I got this kernel crash
when switching VC's.

EIP: 16ae45
EFLAGS: 10206

....

Here is the kernel code that crashed:
(I compiled the kernel with -g and used gdb
/usr/src/linux/tools/zSystem /proc/kcore)

gdb> list *0x16ae45
0x16ae45 is in kbd_bh (keyboard.c:867).
862                             last_console = fg_console;
863                             change_console(want_console);
864                     }
865                     want_console = -1;
866             }
867             if (tty && tty->ldisc.read_flush)
868                     (tty->ldisc.read_flush)(tty);
869             do_keyboard_interrupt();
870             cli();
871             if ((inb_p(0x64) & kbd_read_mask) == 0x01)
gdb> x/i 0x16ae45
0x16ae45 <kbd_bh+149>:  cmpl   $0x0,0xb4(%edx)

0xb4 is the offset of the ldisc.read_flush in the tty_struct:

gdb> print &((struct tty_struct *) 0)->ldisc.read_flush
$12 = (void (**)()) 0xb4

Looks like tty is valid while it is being checked, and when it is
used, it has become invalid.

After the kernel fault, the user process running at the time
(ironically, gdb) was killed, but the kernel stopped working. There
were some complains about gfp called non-atomically from an interrupt,
twice, at the following addresses:

gdb> list *0x11a8d3

0x11a8d3 is in swap_in (swap.c:257).
252             }

(Yeah, I know the 2 things above are not interrupts! Tell Linux that!
:) I think a bug in the fault handling code confused the rest of the
kernel, which resulted in it crashing (read on...)

VC switching was totally ignored, ctrl/shift/altgr-printscreen stuff
still worked. (these symptoms were just like what happened with the
tcpspray problem). altgr-printscreen showed it always with EIP
0023:00000000 and EFLAGS: 282. It was constantly staying at 23:0
(i.e. in user space at location 0), never entering kernel mode except
to print the printscreen info.

In addition to the bug causing the fault, it appears there is a bug in
the fault handling code. If a process is killed due to a fault in an
interrupt, or in other "bad" places, it kills Linux.

I have not been able to replicate the problem. It looks like some sort
of race condition. It took a lot to get it to happen in the first
place. Really high load average, a lot of thrashing, and a lot of I/O.
It seems like it could occur under any load (less likely though,
usually race conditions show more under high load). I still think it
should be looked at, no amount of load should cause a crash. I hope
the information here helps.

Setup: 486/DX33 running 1.0.4 with the modules patch (no longer needs
ksysms.lst), various local patches (none in any of the bottom half
handlers though!), and Ted Tso' new tty code (I patched it into
0.99.15h and kept patching the kernel up to 1.0.4, sometimes having to
manually patch.)

Subject: Problem trying to directt IP address back to loopback interface
Date: Sun, 27 Mar 94 00:24:18 GMT

I want to be able to direct an IP address back to the loopback, but it
does not work. If I have my IP adress as not 127.0.0.1 and my externel
interface is down, sending to it gives a "Netowrk unreachable" (as
expected). If I try to route that IP adress to the loopback, all
packets to it are dropped.

E.g. If my IP address is 125.5.5.5 and my externel link is currently
down, I would want to not have to change my hosts file to point to
127.0.0.1, but still point to 125.5.5.5. If the link is up, (e.g a
SLIP link with my IP address as 125.5.5.5 and the server at
125.1.1.1), using 125.5.5.5 will act like loopback. If the link is
down and I do this:

route add -host 125.5.5.5 dev lo

Packets set to 125.5.5.5 are dropped! This is BAD, since apps like
talk to a local user will fail if it uses the 125.5.5.5 IP address.

Here is some debug info:
127.0.0.1 works
125.0.0.1 fails

inet_debug = 3: (dev.c)

It looks as if the loopback interface is working on the way out, but
the packets are dropped before coming back (through loopback_xmit,
etc).

Where exactly is that happening?  How it I fix it? Where do I look? I
tried looking in loopback.c but no luck there.

P.S. There should be a way to have the kernel log ALL dropping of
packets. Not know when or why the kernel is dropping a packet is very
bad, it makes debugging really difficult.
