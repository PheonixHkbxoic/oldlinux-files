Any system which when supposedly 'correctly configured' spits 127.* to the
wire is broken. On that basis Linux is ok. On the other basis nothign is OK
because as route I can force the issue anyway.

The later BSD/SunOS manuals are quite clear on the matter of writing to
the time interval. Anyone who doesn't do it properly gets burned and its

Subject: gcc/ld linking static binaries!!!?
Date: 14 Mar 1994 22:40:06 GMT

Lately I've been noticing some annoying behavior with gcc/ld during the
linking phase... It appears as if gcc/ld is linking some of my binaries
statically, although I have not passed any arguments to gcc/ld specifically
indicating that I would like it to do so!  I have gcc 2.5.8 and the ld
that came with the 1.9.3 binutils (I believe).  This behavior (linking
things statically w/o me telling it to do so) seems to be assoicated with
the order in whic libraries are specified for linking on the command line.

Ex:

gcc file.o -o file -ltermcap mylib.a

might cause a static binary to be produced, where

gcc file.o -o file mylib.a -ltermcap

will create a shared binary...  In a few other cases, I can't
get a shared binary at all!  (Ex: at2.6b compiles statically).
Am I doing something wrong... is this a bug, or what?

Date: 14 Mar 1994 21:18:00 GMT

Sorry if this is a FAQ (I read it and numerous howto's and didn't find
it).  I recently installed Slackware and, after getting getty_ps,
started up my machine with a getty_ps watching ttyS1 (a Sportster 14400)
at 38400.  The first call in after reboot always gets hung up just after
connection (no message from getty_ps).  All future calls work fine.

Second problem:  I followed the advice in the Net-2-FAQ about setting up
SLIP clients and servers.  I can call in and establish my DIP connection
but several things are wrong.  First, once the DIP connection is
established, I can't actually do anything with TCP/IP on the client
side.  For example, telnet host.slip.server.ca says Connected... but
nothing ever comes back.  Second, if the client eventually gets DIP to
drop the connection, the getty_ps watching ttyS1 never gets respawned so
the line never answers again (until reboot).

Help!  (these DIP problems probably stem from a lack of understanding.
For example, what is the mtu number?  What should it be on the server?
On the client?)

Many thanks.

I think that this is bad -- 127.xxx.xxx.xxx should _never_ be on the
wire.  This is required.

It seems to make more sense for the kernel to populate the routing
table with the special cases in RFC 1122 (3.2.1.3  Addressing: RFC-791
Section 3.2).  This behavior should never be dependent upon the
(possibly bad) setup of some machine.

I doin't think that enabling an interface should create a route,
either.  But I do think that the kernel should be responsible for
ensuring the special cases.

I guess that I agree in principle, but I don't think that shoving the
responsibility for something important over to the sysadmin is wise.

As I pointed out in my previous post, the entry in DNS is
0.0.127.in-addr.arpa.  That means that if 127.0.0.2 goes to the
nameserver, the response is going to be "localhost".

I really think that we are in violent agreement about this -- the

Hey !

Please don't be so angry about people who say more or less RTFM first.
Please remember some facts ;-)

        - The amount of traffic in c.o.l.* is enormous
        - There are so many newcomer questions that are FAQ's
        - There are so many "poor quality" subjects

        which makes reading/helping very hard !

Suppose you have an amount of 30 minutes a day, to ANSWER BEGINNER
QUESTIONS. WHAT WOULD YOU DO in newsgroups, where several hundreds
(thousands ?! ;-) of people are waiting for help ???

        - answer only SOME questions verbousely
        - or answer MUCH MORE questions by telling people what
          doc gives help on that topic ? 

Besides it's BOARING to answer the same questions again and again
in a verbose way. If there is good docu available, a pointer should 
be ENOUGH. Don't think I'm an impatient soul or an arrogant expert.
No ! Please read this under the background, that there *is* good docu 
available and people should try to read it first. 

So many people have spend hours of their free time to make this help 
available to newcomers .. but so many people do ignore that again and
again .. It seems to be more convenient to ask other people.

This INDOLENT MANNER brings us the hundred's of UNNECCESSARY POSTINGS.
"Help me, I'm a consumer" ;-)

It makes no fun reading overcrowded newsgroups. The few articles 
or threads with good Subjects, questions of general interest are
hidden by the mass of - let me simply say - shit.

Another thing is, that nearly all unmoderated linux newsgroups 
contain so MANY ARTICLES WITH BAD SUBJECTS, that you have NO CHANCE 
to recognize, if the question was ALREADY ASKED by another person.
HARD TIMES THESE DAYS !!!

Here some suggestions, that could help minimize the traffic additionally.
I personally think that the idea of the "AUTO MODERATION" off certain
groups (see CURRENT VOTING) is a good idea.

But PACKAGE MAINTAINGER could also do some good things, to PREVENT
hundreds of unnecessary or unnecessary bad (-> quality of subjects)
articles:

HI PACKAGE MAINTAINERS !!! ,-)

WHAT ABOUT THE FOLLOWING PROPOSALS:

a) force people to install manual pages or available FAQ's, HOWTO's
   and ghostscript during the installation (ghostscript -gs- for printing
   postscript files).

b) Write people (root) a greetings mail after a successfull installation.
   It should include the following topics:

        - how to get help in Linux (man, xman, info, xinfo)
        - location of available documents (faq's, howto's)
        - how to print the docu - printer setup -
        - how can I print postscript files on a non PS printer
          (how to use gs as a filter)
        - explain to them, that linux newsgroups are overcrowded,
          so they should read locally installed docu firs, instead of 
          waiting for an answer that points them to that docu if it's 
          a faq ;-)
        - if posting for help, explain user, that he should choose
          a significant Subject (not only "need help"). 

        [ perhaps include apsfilter ( printer filter with file type auto 
          recognition) into your package, so people can print ps and dvi 
          files automagically ]

c) Include in /etc/motd or /etc/issue a note, where system specific
   End User Docu is locally installed.

   "Please note, that lot's of documentation is installed in /usr/doc.
    Please read it first instead of posting the 1001st frequently asked 
    question"
        
d) distribute an initial news database (for cnews or inn) that contains the
   up to data faq's in a separate newsgroup read.me.first or such, that 
   won't be expired....

e) include in /etc/profile a line to fire up the systems favourite
   newsreaderwith this group read.me.first.

Hope that could help a bit avoiding faq's and perhaps some annoyances, too.

Crerating a group comp.os.linux.kernel will not stop any problem.
People will start asking their kernel related questions in it.
There is only one change: follow-up on each misplaces article on
c.o.l.d, saying, that this is the wrong group to place this
article, and that you would be happy to answer, if the question
is reposted to the right group.

But you need a somewhat flame-proof asbestos west, if you do that

I had the same problem once, I tried to select(2) a SOCK_DGRAM-Socket,
and, well, it showed exactly the same behavior: select returns 'yes' ;), 
and when I recvfrom(2)ed, I got 'connection refused.' 

This was with Slackware 1.1.1 (99.14) and I didn't try it again with a

turned off his status display, and refused any cooperation until I turned it
