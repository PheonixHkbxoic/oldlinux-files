        All of the "good" boards I have seen actually follow the first layout.
The only way I can see the 2nd scheme working is for not-very-good boards that
look (at a hardware level) like "standard" com ports. A decent *intelligent*
I/O card should not waste it's time looking like a standard COM[123] port.
You won't get anywhere with a DigiBoard or Specialix intelligent card trying to
talk to it like a "dumb" I/O multiport adapter under DOS. DOS has no idea the
card is even there, or what it is. You need their special driver which
downloads their own custom OS to the card, along with some version of card
specific drivers (which execute under the special OS), and then patches the
apropriate HOST operating system (DOS, Unix, etc) to be able to talk to it.

        Very clearly the portion that actually "hooks into" the OS would be
covered by the GPL, and not one of the developers has said they have a
problem with that. But the code that actually runs on the CARD is *not* OS
specific, is the same for DOS, Unix, whatever, and could be provided in
binary-only format with no problems.

        The 2nd. diagram may be how it appears to someone who is just doing
IOCTL's to talk to the device, but it is leaving out the portion that the
discussion was about (the downloaded code that runs on the card itself).

Is this anywhere near enough.  Most people here use two machines, plus there
are all sorts of xterms, fridges, coffee machines etc.  I can easily see
the ratio of ip addresses per person being >1, and those numbers will
run out in a faily sparse ass IP nets are.

Unixware probably uses either UFS or the SysV filesystem.  Linux
supports the SysV filesystem; it does not support UFS.

Excuse the question, but why do you want both Unixware and Linux?  I

I must agree with Eric on this one.  rc.local is not really part of
the system as provided.  It is something that the user is expected to
hack, munge, whatever.  I don't want to have to tell 1000000 people
that boot linux to make sure they don't muck with the loopback stuff.
It is one more thing for a novice to break/forget.  Heck, when I had
my Linux machine on the network, I didn't even think to add the
loopback stuff, and I even added it wrong a couple of times.  This is
from someone with 8 years of TCP/IP configuration/programming
experience who was clueful and did read the FAQ and HOWTO and every
other doc that I could get at the time.

The Kernel should put 127 in the routing tables by default, but it
should allow its removal by a knowledgible enough user (which could
mean recompiling the kernel, for example).  Give the troubles that
putting 127 on the wire causes, I think that this special case is
suffient reason to violate whatever purity requirements dictated that
you not automatically add the route.

Otherwise, the Linux IP code will get a bum rap from all the sys
admins that have to chase the problem down.

In addition, 127.* should be ignored when received as well, if that
isn't already happening.  I had thought this was clear by implication,
but private email seems to indicate otherwise.

/etc/networks has nothing to do with routing.  It's just a
symbolic-to-numeric map, like /etc/hosts is for host names.

Look in your routing table.  You'll see a host entry for 127.0.0.1, but not
a network entry for 127.0.0.0.  So it will send to the default router.

Who ever claimed that SunOS conformed to everything in RFC 1122?

Subject: Future development of Linux and affects on other architectures
Date: 15 Mar 1994 21:21:06 GMT

I'd just like to mention here that anyone who is developing new
features in Linux, or is enhancing existing features to add new
functionality should keep in mind that Linux is being ported to other
architectures.

Any time you feel the urge to put inline assembler into code which has
no direct link to either the i386 architecture or the IBM PC clone
architecture, think twice before doing so.

If you absolute must put in inline assembler (speed reasons are the
only possible reason I can see), please abstract it out into an
"inline function" or a preprocessor macro, and keep the definition of
the inline function or macro separate from the main functionality.

If you follow rules like this, then it makes porting of these new
features to Linux on other architectures easier.

An example of the benefits of this is the fact that the "net/unix"
Unix domain socket code ported over to Linux/68k with absolutely no
changes required to the source.  I was very happy when I was able to
do this.

Are you saying both the Linux and AmigaDOS versions of the Amiga file
system will already work on PC-formatted floppies, or that, given that
both systems support alternative filesystems, they could be written?

The FreeBSD man pages also talk about this, so I suspect that the
NetBSD to do as well.

However, the following platforms do not write to timeval:
        DEC Ultrix
        SGI IRIX
        Sun SunOS 4.x and 5.x
        FreeBSD current (1.0 and later)

        BSD 4.4
        HP HPUX (8.x and 9.x)
        IBM AIX (3.2*)
        All x86 SVR4 clones I've tried

Subject: Linux 1.0 old problem, new problem...
Date: Tue, 15 Mar 1994 23:21:20 GMT



I posted previously about a problem in Linux pl14 and pl15 with
gopher/www servers hanging when serving DOS or Windows clients.  One
e-mail reply I received claimed that this was a known bug, but should
be fixed in the 1.0 kernel.  Well, as far as I can tell, it isn't.

I'm using Slackware 1.1.2, but I downloaded the 1.0 kernel from funet.fi
and installed it over the pl15h that is currently in Slackware.  I am
also using the 2.01 version of gn as my gopher server, which compiles
after I fix a couple of things (what is a SIGSYS in Linux?).  When I hit
on the server using a DOS or Windows client (NetManage or PCG from UMN)
the data gets transferred (according to gn debug log, and the dialog
box on the client), but the transfer hangs at the end.  The client 
seems to be waiting for the server to close or something, and the
server thinks everything is fine and has already closed.  These same
clients can hit on any other gopher server on the internet without
a single problem, so I know it isn't a problem with the client. 

Please, I am positive this is a bug in the kernel somewhere (tcp layer?).
I've tried four versions of gopherd, two or three versions of gn,
and many different DOS and Windows clients with different packet 
drivers and Winsock stacks... they all have the same problem, and
the only thing in common is Linux.  I've also tried two different 
ethernet cards, 3c501 and 3c509, and both had the same trouble.

Also, I'm using getty_ps 2.07c (included in Slackware 1.1.2)... it
seems to not be working quite right with the new kernel.  It thinks
that it succesfully initialized the modem, when it actually didn't.
(I can tell by looking at the lights).  If I enter/exit kermit to
force it to re-init then it works ok.  This was never a problem 
before I installed kernel 1.0... my modem strings and other setups
worked just fine.

Could someone please look into these? Thanks!

Date: Tue, 15 Mar 1994 15:54:49 GMT

It seems to me that the address 127.x.x.x is not special. What is special
is the loopback device.

When the "lo" device is brought up, it will register itself as IP address
127.0.0.1. You must still create the route to the loopback device as you would
for any other device in your configuration.

If you don't have a route for 127.x.x.x to the "lo" device, but have a default
route to an ethernet controller, for example, then requests to 127.0.0.1 will
go out the wire just as requests to any other IP address. Until a route is
created to the loopback device, the address 127.x.x.x is an unknown address
just as if _I_ asked for address 192.83.17.1. It would need ARP to resolve it
to a real ethernet address and subsequently the request would go out the
default route.

So, it is not the "implementation of TCP/IP" which is broken, but the
operator's setup of the TCP/IP configuration which is broken. There is nothing
"magical" about the address 127.0.0.1 other than the convention that it is the
loopback device and is normally _configured_to_route_ back to your own machine.

I guess what I am saying is that the routing of frames is not a function
solely of the device's IP address, nor is it a function soley of the device
type. There is no magical "override" which says that "Oh, you have address
127.0.0.1. I won't bother to look it up. I know that this is the loopback
device and will simply put it there". It is a function of the routing tables
within the system. If the routing tables do not include a route for the 127
address, then it will use the default route or fail if there is no default
route. If it must use the default route to some eithernet controller then it
will need an ethernet address. This means that it will ask for the ARP
translation of 127.0.0.1.

So after I heard about the announcement of Linux 1.0, I grabbed

run Xfree any more.  Using pl15 and pl15c(or something near c),
I had 0 problems with X.  I changed 0 things in my setup from
