PLEASE, can't people read the notices.  With the Linux kernel sources
comes a file COPYING.  It contains the GPL, but there is a paragraph
before it:

   NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
 services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
 of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
 Also note that the GPL below is copyrighted by the Free Software
 Foundation, but the instance of code that it refers to (the linux
 kernel) is copyrighted by me and others who actually wrote it.

                        Linus Torvalds

Why are we having arguments over absurd interpretations of the GPL
when Linus has clarified the interpretation that actually applies to
Linux?

I'm interested in an Alpha port.  As many people out there know my current
research interest is cost-effective off-the-shelf clustered processors.  If
DEC does come out with a low price on AlphaPCI boards I would probably be
interested enough to spend a lot of time on a Linux port.

In article <CLstDJ.4GB@fc.hp.com>, Dave Hollenbeck <dbh@fc.hp.com> wrote:
>How about porting to a Hewlett Packard? :-)  Same argument.

Easy answer: cost.  HP isn't interested in a low-cost PA implementation.
Sure, they are "competitive" when you add all of the common workstation
overhead to the single-processor price, but when considering the minimal
system to build a cluster node (processor, memory, small disk, and OS) they
don't come out ahead even with their relatively fast processor.

To switch back to DEC for a moment: despite my hopes, I don't expect the
AlphaPCI to be low-priced.  I think DEC will do the traditional
big-computer-company thing and try not to compete with their higher-priced
products.

Subject: O_SYNC (GNU Emacs on X can't be interrupted by CTRL-G)
Date: 27 Feb 94 15:05:51

I found that when using GNU Emacs on X, it can't be interrupted by
CTRL-G, because Linux doesn't support O_SYNC and SIGIO (yet).  It can
be interrupted when it runs on terminal, because a terminal device
driver generates SIGQUIT by CTRL-G.  Please try to evaluate the S
expression

        (while t)

and press CTRL-G.

# My Linux is version 0.99pl15, GNU Emacs is version 19.22, Mule is
# version 1.0pl1 (based on GNU Emacs 18.59).

I can't imagine a life without Emacs, so it is rather big problem for
me.  :-)

And I have another application which depends on O_SYNC for
asynchronous I/O.  If it works on my Linux box, I would be very happy. 
:-)

Since Linux comes with source code, I can try to hack it.  However, I
want to know if someone is trying to implement that feature or not.

Please let me know.
Thank you in advance.

I'm trying to read keyboard scan code directly by using the call:

Everything seem ok except for the fact that pressing 'r' will result
in the scroll lock light turning on and further input inhibited until

I don't think there is any evidence whatsoever that this is true.  Prior
to the invention of the GPL, mod.sources was doing good business.  Even
my own experiences with Shadow and Linux indicates that non-GPL'd code
gets supported by someone.  In particular, Ed Carp and Peter MacDonald
both did excellent work).

What the GPL does that the other "free" copyrights don't do is create the
environment for anyone to hack and slash the code as they see fit.  If
you've ever tried to maintain logical consistency of a large software
package when people are clamouring for new features, you can imagine
what this is like.

You may not benefit, but you won't lose anything.

You can now buy a Specialix board and get a driver to go with it. If
the driver doesn't work, you can take your board back or write a
better driver yourself.

For most other hardware, you get just the hardware, and it is *your*
responsibility to make it work with Linux.
   
Now, if the product in question was a pure software product like, say,
Stacker, there might be less of an incentive to write a free version
(I don't really think so myself, but I can sympathise with such a
view).  However, a driver for some piece of hardware is almost an
integral part of the hardware itself.

Once more I study what I wrote and see a need for amendment.  I said, "If
you think this is unprofessional, ... You are obviously..."  The "You are
obviously ..." is dependant upon the "If you think this [wanting to be paid
some portion of commercial sales of your software] is unprofessional."

I didn't write it this way, bit that's how I meant it.  I stand by this
meaning.  I don't think Russ thinks this is unprofessional.  I hope I'm right.

Subject: Finding new maintainer for dialog
Reply-To: lam836@cs.cuhk.hk
Date: Sun, 27 Feb 1994 09:32:54 GMT

Hello all,

        I am the author of a program called dialog. For those who don't
know, dialog is a program that can be used to display dialog boxes using
a curses/ncurses interface from a shell script. It is used by Slackware
1.1.2 for the 'color144' setup program. Due to some personal reasons, I
find I can't spend as much time as before on dialog. Since I don't want
to hold to development of dialog just because of me, I am seeking a new
maintainer for dialog. My requirement is simple: dialog *must* remain
freely available to everyone (I prefer the GPL), and that my name as the
original author should be mentioned in the sources and in appropriate
places in the documents (e.g. the man page, the README). Of course, the
new maintainer can add his own name to it. Also, first priority should
be given to Linux (i.e. It *must* run under Linux, porting to other
Unices is of second priority).

        Anyone who is willing to look into the code of dialog and do
modifications to it can do the job. If he's not familiar with curses
programming, he can find another person to work with him. In other
words, I don't mind how many are working on dialog, as long as they are
cooperating with each other.

        Please send me a mail if you are interested. I will forward
mails I've got about suggestions send in, so that you can decide on
which features to add in the next version.


Savio

Yeah, but you could make a license that is similar, but differs in those
areas where you think the GPL should be modified.  The copyright on the
GPL covers its expression of the terms of the license, but it does not
cover those terms themselves.

The best way to do this would be to make a list of the rights, restrictions,
and obligations spelled out in the GPL.  Delete those you don't want.  Add
any new ones you want.  Then give the list to a lawyer and tell him or her
to write a license agreement for you.

I've been looking for a topic for a paper I have to write, and a legal

Hi all together,
recently I upgraded my libraries to 4.5.19 and gcc to 2.5.8. Afterwards I have 
problems with a bunch of programs which I tracked down to a problem 
probably regarding shared libs.
As an example the xrolodex program runs without any problem with lib 4.4.4
after upgrading it dumps core. I ran strace on it and get the following list:
>> strace xrolodex
uselib("/lib/ld.so") = 0
getgid() = 100
getegid() = 100
stat("/etc/ld.so.cache", [dev 8 3 ino 1914 nlnks 1 ...]) = 0
open("/etc/ld.so.cache", RDONLY, 144) = 3
mmap(0, 899, READ, SHARED, 3, 0) = 0x40000000
close(3) = 0
access("/lib/libXm.so.1", 0) = 0
uselib("/lib/libXm.so.1") = 0
access("/lib/libXt.so.3", 0) = 0
uselib("/lib/libXt.so.3") = 0
access("/lib/libX11.so.3", 0) = 0
uselib("/lib/libX11.so.3") = 0
access("/lib/libc.so.4", 0) = 0
uselib("/lib/libc.so.4") = 0
munmap(0x40000000, , 899, ) = 0
 - [SIGSEGV]
 + [SIGSEGV]

This is the same on every program I have problems with. Then I compiled 
xrolodex as static and.... no problem anymore worked like before.
Any clue??

Thanks Achim

You should have consulted before you started this. NLS has been implemented

time somewhat.

It is based on the ELM version - which is incidentally freely distributed -
and I have sent my patches to make it even faster back to the author.
The integration is complete now with full support for LC_MESSAGES in
setlocale() and quite a few people are using it with Polish/German/French

use it (ELM being one) and it seemed a good idea to make it catalog compatible
with already existing applications. I have posted a more simple application
to sunsite.unc.edu (hostid.tar.gz) which has NLS support to help people
along.

If someone had the time it would be wonderful if the all the GNU stuff were
Internationalized and passed back to them as there exists very little NLS'ed
applications, and people don't realize that support for NLS in Linux even
exists - you for one :-)
