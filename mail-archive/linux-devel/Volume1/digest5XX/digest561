I'm not sure of the utility of errors reported like this, since a common use
of datagrams is programs with a lot of peers and determining which destination
is invalid doesn't seem to be possible with the socket interface.

Anyway, I just ignored them and did something like you are doing with EINTR.
i.e.:

switch(select(...))
{
   case -1:
     if (errno == EINTR || errno == ECONNREFUSED)
        goto again;
}

Subject: Andrew 6.1 for Linux: who did it?
Date: Tue, 15 Mar 1994 19:59:14 GMT

I grabbed a copy of the Andrew Toolkit for Linux version 6.1 and I must say
that this port definitely causes more problems than it solves.
Most of all it seems incomplete.
For example the .overview files are missing, templates are missing and 
much much more.
Yet it's amazing to see what already does run, so I was wondering 
if anyone has solved all these problems and tailored a running Andrew >= 6.1.

If so, I'd surely like to know where I can grab a copy.

It work you up to receive the error report. You had previousely done a sendto()

I've actually seen a network whose admin (in his infinite wisdom) uses the
127.* network for normal IP numbers.  I.e. his machines are 127.0.0.2,
127.0.0.3, etc.  Strangely enough, it actually works.  Can't see why,
though.

Suffice it to say that there are only IBM implementations of TCP/IP on this

Hi,

I just popped a TI486DLC cpu into my system only to discover that there is a
DOS program that enables the internal cache on the chip.  It works great 
for DOS, but linux is still kind of slow.  

Has anyone tried to add DLC support to the kernel?  For that matter, does
anyone know how to enable the internal cache of the CPU?

| OK, so, when do we get started? :-)  Seriously, thought, how hard would

| asynchronous for this to work?

I haven't been following the UN*X industry for a few years now, so I
can't answer any questions about what SVR4 or Solaris or any other
random system XYZ do...  But, I have mucked around the innards of
realtime UN*Xes before, so I can offer some spiritual guidance.

There are two important pieces of a realtime scheduler, one is easy to
implement, and the other is hard.

The easy part is having fixed scheduling priorities.  So-called
"timesharing" schedulers have mutable priorities--the OS raises the
prority of sleeping procs so they have a better chance of getting the
CPU when they awaken.  This helps interactive jobs get better response
time, and keeps them from getting swamped by CPU-bound jobs.  By
contrast, a realtime OS has no business mucking with the priorities of
critical realtime jobs, they stay fixed at what the application
programmers/administrators set them to.  If more than one process has
the same fixed priority, they are scheduled round-robin within their
priority level.  The scheduler I worked on had the priority space
divided into two, with priorities from 0-127 being fixed realtime
priorities, and 128-255 being lowly UN*X timesharing priorities.

Ok, now that you have a scheduling algorithm that allows fixed
priorities, how are you going to guarantee a small lower-bound on
scheduling latency?  Linux and traditional UN*Xes have single-threaded
kernels, meaning that once a process is executing in kernel-mode, it
keeps the CPU until it finishes the system-call, or explicitly gives
up the CPU by sleeping.  When a realtime OS gets an interrupt on a
device of interest to a realtime process, it doesn't want to wait
until some lower priority process finishes its system call or decides
to sleep--IT WANTS THE CPU NOW!  That means the kernel must be
preemtable, and that's the hard part.  A preemptable kernel needs
fine-grain locking of individual data-structures (e.g., file-table,
inode-table, mount-table, individual inodes, device-descriptors,
etc.).  By contrast, a non-preemptable kernel essentially has the
ultimate coarse-grained locking policy; there's only one lock and it's
system-wide: if a process has the CPU in kernel mode, it keeps it 'til
it's done.

My opinion is that it's too much work for too little benefit to make
Linux preemptable.  99% of Linux users don't care about realtime, and
those that do probably don't consider most PC I/O architectures up to
the task (I'm not speaking with authority here, but I suspect this
might be the case).  It should be noted that preemptability is also a
prerequisite for symmetric multiprocessing, which is potentially more
interesting to Linux users, but not that much more interesting, since
commodity Intel computer systems are uni-processors.  If it ever
happens that multiprocessors become cheap and widely available, then I
think you'll see Linux evolve in this direction, but not otherwise.

I have developed a character device driver and to debug it I was

The kernel's finger is pointing at crond, but the last command crond tried to
exec was to check if term was still connected, so I think it dumped from trsh
which was trying to access an un-established unix socket.  I've only seen it
once and that was within two minutes of installing Linux 1.0 :(
        I can't reproduce it anywhere?  crond spawns term_check every 15 mins
and it hasn't died since, trsh on its own just reports "Connect: Invalid argument"
which is normal behavior.

Not so.  There can be hurt.  This behavior couples with the known 
bug that allows network connections to hang around for a while.  The
result is that *your* machine becomes unreachable until the bogus
connections (eventually) time out.

If we didn't have the "hanging around" bug, 127.0.0.1 on a network
wouldn't be much of a problem, but since we do have the bug, it *is*
a problem.  Luckily it only shows up on crowded nets with misbehaving
machines that do put 127.0.0.1 out on the net.

To my sorrow, we have that problem here...


To change the subject slightly, we seem to have reached some agreement
in this thread.  (1) 127.0.0.1 should never be put out on the network
(although how that is to be done is still being argued about) and 
(2) no machine should respond to an external address of 127.0.0.1.

At the moment (1) is taken care of in a properly configured linux
machine, but (2) is still broken...

My printer is HP DeskJet 500.  
And here is the problem :
        When I am trying to print file linux doesn't send CR to the 
printer.  So All I get are linefeeds at the end of lines.  Hence all
I can print out are the first three lines on any file
and they would look like this:

Line one
       Line two
              Line three 

And so on.  

If someone has a solution please answer by mail to kirill@crl.com
I will post the solution.
Thank you,  Ken.
