Hi,
I have two questions.
1. Do you know a book that describes the various object-file formats e.g.  
coff, elf, omf etc.?
2. Is there a document that describes the GNU object-file format?

I am having some trouble getting Mosaic 2.0 to compile of My Linux

What is lib Xm? Is it part of Motif? Do I need Motif to compile and

I would appreciate help from anyone who has gotten this to work. A
makefile would be nice, or instructions on what I need to use it.

Only a few, generally older, motherboards of questionable design require 
adding more cache to expand memory. 

In a recent issue of "Microtimes" (a silicon valley area tabloid and
computer shopping mag), there was an article questioning the value
of >64K cache. They quoted a report from some independent testing
lab that found 60% of the motherboards they tested ran faster
with external cache disabled (unfortunetly, there were no details
of how they conducted the tests). Designing a good cache subsytem
is not a trivial exercise, unfortunetly a lot of motherboad vendors 
appear to be more interested selling more SRAM's, then in making a few 
perform well (SRAM's are one of the few items on a motherboard with
significant profit margin).

I have heard about this paradoxical effect before (someone had LESS trouble 
had a higher speed than at a lower one). If you send, wait around long 
enough, and thus get to handle the UART while still in the interrupt driver, 
you save an extra call to the interrupt driver. Way less latency and less load.

P.S. with a 16550A you should not be having problems like you describe. 
Try pl15h. It might help.

Add this to the file and, you too, will have _doprnt() under any ANSI
C compiler.

#include <stdio.h>
#define _doprnt(format,args,stream)   vfprintf(stream,format,args)

Or, perhaps a better alternative is to use the editor and change the program
to be ANSI C compliant. Change the name and the order of the arguments.
