I had my first crash in many weeks a few hours ago, and I can't seem to
be able to do anything to recover.  I was shutting down X, when the
system just suddenly seized.  I rebooted to get this message:
extra data not valid  Current error sd801 sense Key Illegal request
Additional sense indicates Logical block address out of range

and when I booted with an old recovery disk, I got:

Dumping sense buffer: 112 0 5 0 0 0 0 10 0 0

My system is a dx2/66 VESA m/b w/ IN2000 scsi and S3-805VLB video.
someone please tell me there's a tool that can help me recover some/all
of my files.  thanks.

If the SCSI disk is properly designed, and properly implements the SCSI
spec, all that is required is to set the appropriate control pages, issue a
mode select, the issue a format unit with the certification bit set (which
is SUPPOSED to be the default).  Many non-SCSI compliant drive manufacturers
(particularly of low-cost low-reliability low-stability drives) do not
implement the SCSI spec correctly (most notable is Maxtor).

If you set the control mode pages, do a mode select and a default format
unit, and the drive develops an error within 2 years, you should send it
back to the manufacturer for replacement as it has a manufacturing or design
defect.

Manufacturers who create high quality drives will take them back for free
re-conditioning under warranty on a yearly basis (CDC, Fujitsu), and will
last for years of continuous heavy service with no problems.

Other drives (not to mention Maxtor again, but they make the most unreliable
and feature-free drives you can waste your money on) will last barely any
time at all before developing errors.

This is my opinion and experience only, and your mileage may, of course,
vary.  You will find however that a bottom-of-the-line Fujitsu drive will
operate and last much longer than a top-of-the-line Maxtor, and that the
Maxtor does not implement most of the features in SCSI that are most useful.

I have a CDC (real CDC, not ScuzGate) drive that is now coming up on 8 years
of continuous heavy service, almost 24 hours a day, 366 days a year, with
nary a hitch.  I have yet to see any maxtor drive last more than a year
under the same load ...

There is a beta test IPX layer for Linux, but no netware support. Novell
guards its netware details with lawyers and complex licensing agreements
involving thousands of dollars. So forget it - Linux does Lan manager and NFS

Subject: PPP defroute problem - hosts, rc.inet1 config?
Date: 22 Mar 1994 15:42:00 GMT

I have just completed upgrading to LINUX 1.0, GCC 2.5.8 & LIBC4.5.21.

PPP was working beautifully on 99.14 before the upgrade. I have a
static hostname and IP address on every connect, so I want to hardcode
my system files to use it. I am still unable to get a stable chat
script to work consistantly, but manually connecting via kermit will
work with an additional step. Here lies my problem:

Now, after connectiong to my ppp server and escaping back to the
kermit prompt and running pppd, I now have to manually add the default
gw route to get things working. Under 99.14, that route was added
automagically. I have tried with and without the defaultroute
command.

Could someone who has ppp working in that way under 1.0 send me a
couple things:

#1 A copy of your /etc/hosts with the significant portions (routeer,
net, localhost, etc. 

#2 A copy of your rc.inet1 or wherever you happen to configure lo
and/or ppp0 with your hostname, ip, default raoute, net and gateway.

#3 A copy of your chat (or kermit) startup script if you have it working.

Thanks in advance!

Subject: Kernel don't recognizes HP PC LAN Ethernet Card !
Date: 22 Mar 1994 15:57:30 GMT

Hello all!
Finally i got a new machine and tried to install
Linux. Everything fine, some fiddling with XFree 2.1,
and no the Problem:
I have a HP PC LAN Adapter / 16 TL+ (aka HP 27252A )
and compiled the Kernel ( Version 1.0 + patch 1 + 2 )
with CONFIG HP PCLAN. But after compiling, the Kernel
don't recognizes my Card.
Here is my Machine:
HP Vectra 486/66 MHZ, 8 MB,
integrated VGA Card Localbus with 512 KB
HP 27252A Ethernet Card /* This Card is mentioned in the
Ethernet-HOWTO as one of the best Cards, but there are no
hints / tips , why the Kernel don't recognizes it */

What i have done this weekend :
HP has a nice program  for setting up the card,
it is called hplanset.
I have done this :
Set the IO to 300-31fh
        IRQ to 10
        Station Adress is 080009-530D4C
compiled with CONFIG HP PCLAN -> no chance
compiled with CONFIG_LANCE -> no chance
compiled with every available Ethernet card -> no chance
Tried it with LILO : ether=10,0x300,0,0,eth0 -> no chance
Copied a kernel from this machine ( This is a 386/25 MHz
HP Vectra with only 4 MB and a HP LAN Card, the older model
with only 8 bit ) to the new machine, but it fails again.

And now i have absolutly no idea, what to do next.
Any help would be very nice.
Thanks Thomas

Subject: Hanging CSLIP with ftp
Date: 23 Mar 1994 14:38:41 GMT

Folks,

Here's the scoop... All I have to do to hang my CSLIP connection is
try to ftp an uncompressed xpilot map across the connection. Once I
compress the map (which I will include here), the transfer goes
smoothly.

I suspect it has something to do with long strings of identical
characters and the compression algorithm(s), but I'm basically taking
an educated guess (no facts or code-grazing to back me up).

I thought someone might be interested in this, assuming it's not some
boneheaded mistake on my part.

And by the way, I meant _hung_, so don't try this unless you're
willing to restart your CSLIP connection...

Nick Vargish

p.s. This is the map I was talking about, gzipped and uuencoded. It
should work gzipped, and fail ungzipped...

You can emulate a lot with fork(), but in my experience the
applications I have written using pthreads() seem to behave better.
Mutexes can be done with semaphores, but conditions (as in
pthread_condition) get a little hairy when you have a master process
controlling a bunch of slave processes.  Plus, pthreads lets you give
up the processor with pthread_yeild() which can make threaded
applicaitons more effieient.

sometimes becuase of the gcc installation that file gets moved to

if you have not tried using the find command to locate the file
(find / -name stddef.h -print) then you just might find the file
in a directory path resembling but not necessarily exactly like --->
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.5.7/include/stddef.h
Like I said... obscure.  You will of course adjust OS and version numbers 
according to your own installation :)

hope this helps.

Subject: plotter works with 0.99pl1[4,5], but not 1.0
Date: 22 Mar 94 21:07:49 GMT

Hi there

I have a plotter (HP ColorPro) attached to /dev/cua1.
It worked fine with plain 0.99pl14 and 0.99pl15, but with 1.0
it seem to loose characters from time to time. Sometimes the plots
are ok, but most of the time the plotter starts going crazy in
the middle of the plot, obviosly getting some wrong vector values.

For the older kernels (pl14,pl15) I have NOT used the kernel patch 
mentioned in the Printing-HOWTO (Dec 1 93, included at the end of 
this posting) for setting up a serial printer at that time, since 
it worked fine without it.

In the current Printing-HOWTO (Feb 22 94) the patch is not mentioned any 
more. Also the relevant lines in /usr/src/linux/kernel/chr_drv/tty_ioctl.c 
have changed, so that the older patch can not be applied anyway. It 
looks as if some kind of bug was implemented by this recent changes.

Does anybody has similar problems or a idea what's going wrong?
Or a idea for solving the problem? 
My current solution is not to use 1.0 :-(

Thanks Denis

====================================================================
Some more information:
I have the plotter running with lpd connected to a dummy device, as
it is described in the Printing-HOWTO. The setting for the serial
port are made at boottime with 'stty'. I have set up these settings
with the 0.99pl14 kernel and have nothing changed since then.

====================================================================
My stty settings are:
cat:~$ stty -a < /dev/cua1
speed 9600 baud; rows 0; columns 0; line = 0;
intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^?; kill = ^U; eof = ^D; eol = <undef>;
eol2 = <undef>; start = ^Q; stop = ^S; susp = ^Z; rprnt = ^R; werase = ^W;

====================================================================
From the older Printing-HOWTO (1 Dec 93) about setting up a serial printer:
...
First, there is a kernel patch you need to make. This applies
to  pre-net-2 lpd  as well  (actually, the  use of  this should
probably just  be commented  out of  the lpd  source code). The
change is for  at least patchlevel 10,  but probably all others
as well.

in /usr/src/linux/kernel/chr_drv/tty_ioctl.c, around line
390, you will see:

        case TIOCEXCL:
        return -EINVAL; /* not implemented */

Change this to return 0,  recompile the kernel, and you'll be
  all set.
...
====================================================================

I can give more info about system configuration, if this is important.

Subject: bug? or don't I get something?
Date: 23 Mar 94 16:45:10 GMT


        Greetings. I ran a butchered version of iozone 1.6 (old) with
        mods to allow for concurrent execution (to test just to what
        extent IDE sucks in multi-tasking applications - oh, btw, it
        sucks the chrome off the bumpers... more later)

        Anyway, for this little test to be "fair", I had to shoot 
        Linux buffers in the foot (by allocating most of my memory
        with an "eatmem" program). I left about 1.5MB for the
        multiple instances (up to 20) of the 23K executable.

        What I noticed was that linux was groping the swap even 
        though there was ~1MB in the buffers. After a few [dozen]
        trials, it was REALLY eating swap like there was no tomorrow!

        I'd like to know something before I go any further: What does
        linux prefer to do a) write/read directly to disk or b) write/
        read to buffers which are really swap [sigh]. Also, can it
        tell the difference? Further, is there anything that can be
        done to help this?

        Also, my system is as follows: Linux 1.0 kernel (debugging on,
        SCSI compiled in (not used)), xiafs FS on a 200MB Maxtor IDE
        (17 ms), 486DX 2/66 VLB, 16MB ram, 13MB swap (partition), 
        256K cache, 11MHz ISA buss, 33MHz VLBuss. (note that eatmem
        program "ate" 11MB)

        I include a list of "free" after it started looking fishy:

        By this time ~5 hours & maybe 30-40 trials had been run. Right
        now, as I write this, "free" says:

             total       used       free     shared    buffers
Mem:         13748      13012        736       1056       4860
Swap:        13368       6740       6628

        And, let me exit the eatmem,

             total       used       free     shared    buffers
Mem:         13748       7268       6480       1044       4864
Swap:        13368       1120      12248

        Well, the swap looks better but... why was I loosing memory
        above... Is that a "fact of life", is it a bug, is it a leak,
        is it paranoia, what is it?

        Also, why does linux keep buffers @ 4MB even though it [should]
        know that they are really swap. Or is that the problem... it
        doesn't know the buffers are swap... eh?

        BTW, I case anyone is wondering what kind of #'s I got from
        my benchmarks... If you're planning to get an IDE, you 
        DEFINITELY want to read this (hopefully you'll change your
        mind):

        Well, the best (or worst, depending on your point of view)
        test was 20 instances of iozone writing/reading a 1MB file.

RESULTS:

        20 : concurrent jobs
         1 : MB (file size)
     10425 : bytes/second READ
     89767 : bytes/second WRITE

        [sniff..sniff..Whhhaaaaaa....]

        Right behind (or in front :-) was 10 instances of 2MB iozone.

RESULTS:

        10 : concurrent jobs
         2 : MB (file size)
     20274 : bytes/second READ
     76145 : bytes/second WRITE

        It got better with less instances... 1 instance of 20MB was

RESULTS:

         1 : concurrent jobs
        20 : MB (file size)
    302009 : bytes/second READ
    552318 : bytes/second WRITE

        which just goes to prove that while IDE is "fast" in a single
        task environment like MS-DOG or, to a lesser extent, MS-WINDOZE,
        it really reeks for anything that has 2 or more processes writing
        to the disk. And, God forbid, you have 20 users on line...

        This is my BEFORE segment... I'll rerun all these tests after
        I get my BT445S & 1.8GB :-) and post the AFTER...

        I can upload the kludged iozone to sunsite so others can have
        a go at it (if you don't believe me). A more complete version
        of this article will be posted to comp.periphs.scsi to stop
        silly flame-fest on IDEvsSCSI speed...

        Take care (sorry this is so long and I hope the first item can
                   solved. Thanks!)
