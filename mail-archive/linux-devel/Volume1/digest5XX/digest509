Not really the library is LGPL/BSD/PD and the kernel is Linus and co code

I was just porting the NetBSD timed and interestingly, I found that 
<linux/ip.h> and <linux/icmp.h> do not define struct ip and struct icmp,
respectively. I did some grep'ing to see if they were defined elsewhere,
but came up with nothing.

I'm using the standard pl15, patched to pl15h, all taken from nic.funet.fi.
No net3 code or anything like that; it's a vanilla kernel (+ppp). Sooo...

ISDN should be doable soon. There is now a rather nice PPP ALPHA release
for the protocol layer and all that's needed is the card software.
I'm fortunately working on ISDN software at the moment, but for now real

I'd also like to see a 1.0 and a pl16 split together. There is a lot of

No the Linux interface is hardly unique and specialy at a functional level.
In addition the interface to Linux is specifically not GPL'd. The whole
issue is a bit of a mess. It's easy to see what RMS means to accomplish
but not how its interpreted. Certainly I regard the two issues as 
seperate. I'm dubious about GPL forcibly applying to modules however..

Yes, I experience that every day, just between my two Linux boxes.
The problem is different for me:  Sometimes, when I rlogin or telnet to
the other box, and exit; the next rlogin or telet  will wait 30 seconds.
(minimum).

Or sometimes the connections hang:

renux:/home/rene $ netstat
Active Internet connections
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address          Foreign Address        (State)       (Uid)
tcp        0   1825 renux.frmug.fr.n:login plux:1023              ESTABLISHED

plux:/home/rene $ netstat
Active Internet connections
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address          Foreign Address        (State)
tcp        0      0 plux:1023              renux:login            ESTABLISHED  

This is an xterm on the machine "plux", 'rlogged' on the machine 'renux'.
It  has been totally frozen for 2  hours, I can't type anything in it.
Other connections ( deleted here) work ok.

I notice that the problem occur more frequently when I connect another
network whith a PPP or SLIP dialout...

When a connection freeze like that, it is NEVER between the Linux box and
the remote SLIP connection, but ALWAYS between my two Linux systems.


Now, when I kill the processes, windows, and all, I try new "rlogin",
this is what happens:

plux:/home/rene $ rlogin renux

... nothing. wait, wait, wait.

On renux, I get:
tcp        2      0 renux.frmug.fr.n:login plux:1023              FIN_WAIT2 
On plux,  I get:
tcp        0      0 plux:1023              renux:login            SYN_SENT  

And I can wait like that one hour... I can no longer 'rlogin'. To be able
to rlogin, I have to stop the rlogin procedure, wait for the old socket to
be closed, (it can be long !), and then everything works proprely for a
moment, until the next problem. (One hour or three days later, it occurs
randomly).


PS: I put a followup to c.o.l.d, since this is not an admin problem, but
    is related to the kernel...

I'm sure that, in the documentation of your v32bis modem, it is explained
that in order to get a 14400 connection, you have to set the speed of the
modem / machine link to a fixed 19200, 38400 or 57600...

Subject: serial driver woes
Date: 28 Feb 1994 22:35:12 -0500
Reply-To: gkm@tmn.com (Greg McGary)

I've been wrestling with the linux 0.99.15 serial driver for a couple of
days now with limited success.  I would appreciate hearing from others
who have delved into the serial/tty/ns16550a morass.

Here are my findings, in no particular order:

* I found at least three bugs in the calculation & deployment of
  rs_timer() timeouts, with the net result that timeouts intended to
  happen within a few jiffies don't happen for 60 seconds!  When an
  interrupt is lost (and they are lost with some frequency), the
  driver waits all that time before things start up again.  I
  discovered this after noting that uucp performance on my 14,400bps
  modem (with 16550a UART) was miserable due to 60 second dry-spells
  in transmission every 20-30Kb transferred.  I fixed this, and got a
  significant improvement, but other problems still exist...

* The code sets the 16550A FIFO trigger at 8 bytes.  This appears to
  work for receive interrupts, but not for transmit--I always observe an
  interrupt per character on transmissions.

* Receiving high speed file transfers (DCE->DCE at 14,400bps, and
  DCE->DTE at 38400bps) works reliably with zmodem, but is unreliable
  with uucp.  The only observable difference is that zmodem sets VMIN
  to 96, while uucp sets VMIN to 6.  My cursory inspection of the
  Taylor uucp code leads me to believe that it continually adjusts
  VMIN to match what its expecting according to the protocol ('g' in
  this case), but I observed no change in VMIN when I ran the
  following while a uucp transfer was in progress:
  
    while :
    do
        stty -a </dev/cua1
    done |egrep min >cua1.log
  
  I find it hard to believe statistically that I wouldn't take a
  snapshot of the tty modes at some time that the VMIN is set to
  some larger value for receiving a 64 byte packet.  I'll have to
  run uucico under gdb, to see if the ioctl()s to reset VMIN are
  actually occurring.  In any case though, application code shouldn't
  have to divine the "proper" settings of VMIN/VTIME in order to get
  reliable operation--the worst thing that should happen is that
  the CPU should have to work a bit harder with less efficient settings.

* For some as yet unexplained reason, when I run the aforementioned
  unreliable uucp receive transfers with lots of printk() debugging
  turned on, the transfers become reliable and run at full speed
  (betw. 1200-1300 bytes/sec. on a gzip'ed file at 14,400 bps
  DCE->DCE).  When I turn the debugging printk()s off, I get many
  "tty65: input overrun" errors.  This makes no sense to me, firstly
  because printk() is relatively simple and fast, and secondly, if
  anything, the printk()s should prolong the interrupt handler and
  thereby *cause* more overrun errors.  A worthwhile experiment would
  be to replace the printk()s with short delay loops to see if its the
  extra time that's significant, rather than something else peculiar
  about calling printk().

* The UART seems to require a "cooling off" period after servicing the
  interrupt, before the interrupt handler can return--I have to poll
  until the UART_IIR_NO_INT bit is set before returning.  It usually
  takes at least a couple times around the service loop, after all I/O
  has been performed and there's nothing left to do, before the bit
  comes on.  Sometimes, it takes a dozen loops before the bit comes
  on!  This is neither here-nor-there, I just find it curious
  behavior, and, of course, it would be nice if the interrupt could be
  serviced faster without all the thumb-twiddling at the end,

Now, some questions:

* Is the Linux serial driver generally known to be buggy/unreliable at
  high speed, or is there something about my hardware configuration
  that's causing me problems that others don't have?
  
* Are there multiple versions of the 16550a, some of which don't
  work--possibly like mine! :-(

That's all that comes to mind at the moment.  Please be in touch if
you care about reliable, high-speed serial I/O under Linux and can help!
