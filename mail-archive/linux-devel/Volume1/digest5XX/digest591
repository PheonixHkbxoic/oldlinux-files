 Great idea! But I don't think it would work that simple... As far as I
can remember, the usual c64 <-> 1541 transmission protocol uses no hand-
shaking, i.e. the c64 doesn't wait until the 1541 has processed a bit be-
fore it sends the next one. And the daemon you propose may be sleeping as
long as it likes if there is heavy load on the machine. I think it's better
to design your own protocol and implement it in the *kernel* (as a 
standard unix device driver). The commodore protocol is much to slow anyway.
 
 BTW, polling is generally NOT recommended on a real OS like Linux.

 Also a great idea! But instaed of a 1541 filesystem I'd rather recommend a
1541 block device driver just like the usual /dev/fd* interface and some
utilities similar to the mtools that operate on that device. 
(with this design, you could even create an ext2fs on a 1541 floppy if you're
funny enough!)

I just installed the patch to enable Multimode with my IDE drives, and
got the following message on bootup:

hda: WDC AC2340H                              (325MB IDE w/128KB Cache)
hda: older drive, multiple mode not enabled
hda: hda1 hda2
hdb: st3144AT                                 (124MB IDE w/32KB Cache)
hdb: older drive, multiple mode not enabled
hdb: hdb1

I would have thought the Western Digital drive would have this feature, as
it is practically brand new.  Oh well, it matches the rest of my system. :)
My question is this: Since multimode is not available, can I expect to see
any performance increase by installing this patch?

Well, any implementation that doesn't handle infinite-sized buffers is
"broken".  How may NFS server will happily serve 63K+ buffers?  Where do you
draw the line?

The limit right now is due to the unfragmented UDP packet size on ethernet
of about 1500 bytes.  1K is the largest power of two that will fit
completely into a single UDP packet / ethernet frame.  If you think about
it, 1K is thus the most logical size for the NFS limit.  Any larger size
will require fragmenting the UDP packet, which has the bad attribute that
losing any single fragment will require retransmitting the whole thing.

You certainly wouldn't pick an unusual value like 2^13... nahhh, no one
would do that.

>P.S. Is calling vmalloc from an interrupt bad?

Yes.

Subject: Writing AST _EIGHT_ port driver, coprogrammer wanted.
Date: 30 Mar 94 16:46:24 +0100


Hello,

I intend to write a driver for linux for the AST EIGHTport 
adapter (note, NOT the 4port). The eighport adapater is an intelligent
8 port serial port adapter. Writing the code that is to be loaded
into the adapter's memory is do-able for me, but I am looking for someone
who is willing to help me to adapt this code it to linux, to
establish the interfacing between the linux-code and this board.

Would there be anyone interested in joining me in this task?

Please answer by e-mail (mvdl@et.tudelft.nl)

Date: Tue, 29 Mar 1994 21:55:49 GMT

Hmmm.  "Haapi" is a fairly up-to-date Linux system, running the .21 libraries,
the latest kernels, the gcc 2.5.8.  Processor is 486DX50, SCSI controller
is an Adaptec 1542b.

It runs CNews, Taylor, and Smail as its main purpose in life, and does it
all quite nicely.

Back around PL15h, I installed the cluster diffs, and grew misty-eyed as the
perceived performance of the SCSI drive improved dramatically.  Next day,
however, "newswatch" reported something like the following to me:

        relaynews: error closing history file (I/O error)

I got several per day, though not every run of relaynews produced the error.

I upgraded to 1.04 with NO cluster diffs and ran that for several days, and
saw no errors, then installed a 1.05 kernel+cluster diffs, and IT'S BACK.

Now, I can't find anything wrong with the history file, and I get no other
reports of problems from the system, but I'm curious as to why such low-level
driver changes could cause such errors.  Anybody else seen 'em?

Subject: Diffs for /proc locking info
Date: Wed, 30 Mar 1994 15:55:16 GMT

The uuencoded part of this message contains my rather trivial 
quick & dirty kernel diffs for adding file locking information
to the proc filesystem.

DISCLAIMER: I don't really know what I'm doing. This code seems to
            work for me, but don't hang me up on it.

After applying the diffs (which are for kernel 1.0.5) and building 
a new kernel, for every process there will be  a file 
/proc/some_process_id/locks which contains a line for every lock 
the process holds.

Example:
=================================
$ cd /proc/92
$ cat locks
  4   1   0 2147483520 2147483520
  3   1   0 2147483520 2147483520
  3   0   0      85928      85928
  5   1   0          0 2147483647
================================= EoE

Every line consists of 5 numbers:

fl_fd      file descriptor
fl_type    lock type        0=read lock, 1=write lock
fl_whence  'whence'         I'm not sure about this one since
                            my database apps only use SEEK_SET
fl_start    first byte of lock
fl_end      last byte of lock

It's just a bit harder! Not only the c64 doesn't wait for the 1541, you must
look for the correct times, too. This means that ther can't be any activity
while using the PC and a drive for the c64. Only while waiting for the c64
the PC can do other things.

This would be very nice. But as you mentioned above this is not easy to do.
I've tried to run my transferroutines under Linux and they worked only if
I didn't use the PC for any other work. Even if the system writes the diskbuffer
back to disk the routines hang and I had to kill the process.
Mention that I had to disapbe the keyboard in the dos program Disk64E so the
OInterrupt isn't called while accessing the 1541. I think the driver is
only possible if you find a way to stop ALL system activities while accessing
the 1541.

I'm just now at the point where I want to start poking around

I am looking for tips on writing serial drivers specifically,

Failing that, does anyone have any tips on successfully removing

As far as I understand, the package won't speed anything up if it isn't

Okay.  Thanks to everyone who has patiently tried the previous
iterations of these patches.  The following is the UUencoded .tgz 
file that I have submitted to Linus for eventual kernel inclusion.

These patches are for Linux systems using IDE hard drives.
They should not negatively impact systems with older drives (MFM,RLL..).

Several new features are provided over those of the stock kernel:

(1) IDE drive identification at boot time, with an option for even more info.
(2) Support for IDE multiple sector transfer mode, which reduces kernel
        overhead during disk I/O, and speeds up data throughput.  On my system,
        kernel overhead drops by 20-30% for I/O, and data throughput improves
        by about 15%.  Turned "off" by default.
(3) Provision to run with interrupts unmasked most of the time inside the
        hard disk driver routines.  This eliminates "serial port overrun"
        errors due to disk activity on most systems.  Turned "off" by default.
(4) New ioctl() calls to enable/adjust the settings for features (2) and (3),
        as well as a sample C program you can use "out of the box" to do this.

Have fun.

Hmm...

Our configuration matches almost exactly.  I have a small network at home
here with normally 2 linux machines, sometimes 3 or 4.  I also connect up
to an Annex Micro XL for my PPP link.

Now, I never ever have problems or errors.  I also push the Annex at the
full DTE it supports (57,600) and using 2 Hayes 28.8K modems.  Transfers
of ftp, news, and mail are just smooth as can be, both up and downloading.
And I never have hung connections and stay online from 3-20 days at a time
without loss of connection or an unreasonable ammount of errors (sometimes
collisions, which I think is odd).

I wonder where the fundamental differences are that cause problems.

(thinking hard...)
