Subject: Small patch for Umsdos, please give it a try
Date: Mon, 14 Mar 94 05:16:49 GMT

umsdos 0.2 is now used by many. I have received few bug reports
difficult to replicate. All those were related to the inability
to locate a file even if it is there (a ls just after the failure
shows it). I have located and fixed at least one bug. A small diff
follow.

Those who have that kind of odd behavior, could you try it. If possible
could you email again even if this is fixing it or not. I have
received a number of mail reporting mostly "false alarm" bug. To
make things more complicated, my email system went a little crazy
and I am pretty sure I have lost some messages (since 3 weeks ago).
I have updated to the latest sendmail and now all look fine.


This patch must be applied in /usr/src/linux/fs/umsdos

Thanks in advance!

PS: For those who asked, here is the status of umsdos.

1-Make sure all known bug are solved (pretty close I guess).
2-Promote integration in the standard kernel right after 1.0 is out.
3-Enhance performance.

In parallel I intend to produce LADR (Linux Advanced Desktop Release).
I am currently exploring the Andrew Multimedia system
to produce the help and administration system. Anyone with good
experience with it ? Some pointers would be welcome :-)

Hi there,
I wonder if someone could email me, post, or give me a pointer to a
brief summary of using SOCK_PACKET to obtain raw Ethernet packets
under Linux.  I have a prototype program that uses raw Ethernet
sockets under SGI IRIX, but before releasing it I would like it to run on
Linux as well.  I only need to know the things that are specific to
the SOCK_PACKETS interface compared to UDP or RAW sockets (or, if you
happen to know the SGI SNOOP/DRAIN interface, the differences between
that and Linux).  I am primarily interested in nonpromiscuous use
(based on a specific Ethertype).

What happened was the typical Usenet digression.  Everyone (that understood
the topic, that is) agreed that what Specialix wanted to do was perfectly
fine.  The topic moved to loadable device drivers (*not* the original
downloaded embedded code), and some uninformed people started flaming the
Linux developers for claiming something that had never been claimed.  The
out-of-context quotes caused even more people to jump in, and ...
the flames went on.

I disagree with this diagram.  The vast majority of devices have a
register-level interface that appears as hardware, and the device drivers
are tightly integrated with the kernel

OOps.  Not the modem caused the problem.  The printer did.  The
last sentence should read as "They happen on my 386 DX 40, when
I send large bitmaps to the printer."

Sorry for my confusion.

Subject: Performance on remote machine using rlogin
Date: 14 Mar 94 10:00:42 GMT

Hi everyone, I have serious problem when rlogin a remote machine and do
some modem stuffs. For example, after rlogin another machine and run
kermit, I can't dialup to outer world successfully no matter it is a BBS
host or a unix machine. I did get connected but a lot of characters
dropped. Is it the *famous* TTY overrun? Doing same thing on the machine
(sitting in front of it :-) works fine up to 38400 without a glitch. I
am using a AMD386 DX40 and ZyXEL 1496E+ and 16450 though.

In another occassion, I tried download some files (a few MB) from a
dialup unix host. Everything fine until I rlogin this machine from
another one. I do some 'ls', 'rm, 'cp' stuffs etc. Then lots of retry
coming out. I stop, it continues fine. Doing similar things locally
shows no problem. Is it a network problem or the remote stuff is
so demanding(seems not so)?

I tried the hard-params.c program posted in this group last

Steven.Pemberton@cwi.nl, about it.

It is now called `enquire', to be found in {pub}/misc on

Subject: Linux 1.0---A better UNIX than Windows NT
Date: 14 Mar 1994 12:51:16 GMT

Finally, here it is.  Almost on time (being just two years late is
peanuts in the OS industry), and better than ever:

        Linux kernel release 1.0

This release has no new major features compared to the pl15 kernels, but
contains lots and lots of bugfixes: all the major ones are gone, the
smaller ones are hidden better.  Hopefully there are no major new ones. 

The Linux kernel can be found as source on most of the Linux ftp-sites
under the names

        linux-1.0.tar.gz                (full source)
        linux-1.0.patch.pl15.gz         (patch against linux-0.99pl15)
        linux-1.0.patch.alpha.gz        (patch from linux-pre-1.0)

it should be available at least at the sites

        ftp.funet.fi:
                pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus       (now)
        sunsite.unc.ed:
                pub/Linux/Incoming              (now)
                pub/Linux/kernel                (soon)
        tsx-11.mit.edu:
                pub/linux/sources/system        (soon)
        ftp.cs.helsinki.fi:
                pub/Software/Linux/Kernel       (now)

This release finally moves Linux out of Beta status and is meant as a
base for distributions to build on.  It will neither change Linux'
status as FreeWare under the GPL, nor will it mean the end of
development on Linux.  In fact many new features where held back for
later releases so that 1.0 could become a well tested and hopefully
stable release. 

The Linux kernel wouldn't be where it is today without the help of lots
of people: the kernel developers, the people who did user-level programs
making linux useful, and the brave and foolhardy people who risked their
harddisks and sanity to test it all out.  My thanks to you all. 
(Editorial note: if you think this sounds too much like the Academy
Awards ceremony, just skip this: it's not getting any better.)

Thanks to people like Aaron Kushner, Danny ter Haar and the authors of
the AnwenderHandbuch (and others) who have helped me with hardware or
monetary donations (and to the Oxford Beer Trolls and others who took
care of the drinkware).  And thanks to Dirk, who helped me write this
announcement despite my lazyness ("hey, it's just another release, who
needs an announcement anyway?"). 

To make a long and boring story a bit shorter and boring, here is at
least a partial list of people who have been helping make Linux what it
is today.  Thanks to you all,

You might want to just put a 1 shot on the board, this would avoid having

I found that neither my Silicon Graphics host nor my Linux host
answered correctly to 127.0.0.2.  When I put in an explicit route to
network 127.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 it correctly assigned it to the
loopback interface and then connecting to 127.0.0.2 worked.

Personally I find this use of a class A network for this purpose pretty
ridiculous, but I can see where having multiple loopback addresses
could be of use; 127.0.0.1 should then be the equivalent to the
"outside" entrypoint.  But a Class A?  Give me a break.

Two issues:

1. I would assume support could be there; memory could me kmalloc()ed
at load time if the font is loaded with the "set only this VT" option.
Since the maximum size of a font is 32x256 = 8K, having two data block
pointers/VT would do it.  If set to NULL, use the global font.

2. The EGA/VGA hardware supports 512-character fonts as well; you lose
highlighting the foreground or blink (if you chose to lose the blink
you have to force the CRTC into 8-column mode and invert the font,
then swap foreground and background).  

Once my exams are over this quarter, I am going to look into this and
a couple of other features I have been thinking about.
