Now this is a fair statement.  I agree totally with Russ here.  If you
are going to give something away, give it away.  I won't go into the GPL
vs. BSD/MIT copyright issues here, but suffice it to say both of the
above copyrights are much easier to deal with than the 'no commericial'
copyright.  

If you want to make money from it, don't use other folks for free
advertising and bug fixes, which effectively giving it away for
non-commercial use is.  It gets debugged and nice features are added, so
that at a later date you can charge for it and commercial entities can't
use your (debugged and featureful) code w/out your permission.

Unfortunately, the folks who do Kermit (yes, Columbia University) forbid
commercial entities from distributing it w/out buying a copy of the
kermit book for every copy distributed.  I call this blackmail. 
Granted, alot of work has gone into making kermit a VERY nice product,
but as a former beta-tester, I didn't get paid for my efforts in doing
this.  I feel a bit cheated since I have always looked upon kermit as
'free software', and not encumbered.

Anyway, I'll get off my high-horse now.

Hi,

Anyone know the UID of the person who ported IV 3.1 to Linux ?  I am
refering to the copy under X11/devel/iv31-bin.a[abc] and
X11/devel/iv31-lib.tgz.

Thanks,

        Cedric

Subject: Netmasks not on byte boundaries?

I know this has been discussed here recently, but I've been very late
catching up with c.o.l.*, and my latest FAQ copy only has a mention of
netmask restrictions.

Currently I am led to believe that netmasks can only be set on whole-
byte boundaries in Linux (pl15).  I did note some code in the network
sources that included something like ">>8" to shift mask bits (I'm not
a C-language guru, sorry).

Is anyone working on it, or is this one of those rather tricky changes
which interacts with lots of other things?

I'd like to use a netmask on my Linux box in which the line between
network number and host number is drawn through the middle of a byte.

Chuck.

MY FELLOW MORTALS,

THIS IS THE ANTI-CHRIST THAT SPEACK TO US.  HE WANTS US TO BELIEVE THAT 
HE IS THE LORD AND DEVERT US FROM THE STRAIT AND NARROW PATH TO HOLY
LINUX.

After slackware by Satnists and Jesus is coming perhaps the people seeking to 
reduce noise in the linux heirarchy shouldn't be proposing c.o.l.advocacy or 
more moderation but c.o.l.religion instead.
