Notice that '[ ... ]' part above? I did *not* say NYS would be contain
just the stuff in SunOS 5 and nothing else.The "fputspent()" is one of
many additions (some to have some compatibility with your code, atleast
that was my original intention).

You're really funny, did you know that? Why do I get the feeling your
feelings are hurt because I don't use your shadow stuff in NYS?

(The major reason was that at the time when I wrote that stuff JFH's
shadow library wasn't LGPL'd. Another big reason was that I wanted
a set of *clean* functions and header files without all the compatibility
stuff for 4711 different unixes that pollutes JFH's shadow library).

Btw, what's stopping you from writing your own NYS library with your
shadow stuff if you think my stuff is so bogus, wrong and totally useless?

/Peter (peter@ifm.liu.se)

Ps, I'm always open for suggestions for improvements if they are presented
in a nice manner. If some jerk starts a request for improvement by flaming
me, then I can promise you I'll completely disregard his/her opinions.

What I'm considering is to add a function named __getspnam() (or fgetspnam()
or whatever) that will read the shadow file only, and nothing else.

But the basic getspnam() function will stick to getting it's information
from /etc/shadow, /etc/passwd, YP, NIS+, Kerberos or whatever (as specified
in the "/etc/nsswitch.conf" configuration file).

Huh? I didn't know your version of Shadow was NameServiceSwitch-aware.
getspent() in Solaris 2 uses the /etc/nsswitch.conf file to find out
from which service to get the shadow information. In the YP (NIS version 2)
case it gets it from the Passwd map. I have only extended this to cover
the case of files also.

Bullshit. Sure, chfn has to use some other way to find out from which source
it got it's information, but it has to do that anyway since the information
might come from YP (in which case it has to talk to a remote rpc.yppasswd
server to change the information) or NIS+ (in which case it has to do an
authenticated RPC call to to NIS+ server to modify the information).

Agreed. But NYS does *NOT* give the encrypted password when you call
getpw*(). Where on earth did you get that impression? It's the getsp*()
functions that fall-back to reading /etc/passwd if /etc/shadow doesn't
exist, not the other way around.

Ah, I just noticed one improvement I'll add and that is that if the
file /etc/shadow exists, but is read-protected then the getsp*()
functions won't fall back to reading /etc/passwd (or perhaps they
will do that but return "*" in the passwd field, hmmm. Have to make up
my mind on that issue).

Like wow man. Big problem. Sigh. The next version of NYS will contain
a set of functions __setspent(), __endspent(), __getspent(), __getspnam()
that will only read "/etc/shadow" and nothing else.

Setting up an YP server doesn't have to be complex. If the YP server
is properly written all it would need would be the following two
lines in /etc/rc (or the equivalent):

        /usr/sbin/rpc.portmap
        /usr/sbin/rpc.ypserv

(Ideally it would automatically build GDBM/BerkeleyDB databases from the
text files when it detects that the files have been modified. Ie, no need
for "cd /var/yp; make").


>the system from being complex, or reliable.  What are you going to
>propose when ypserv doesn't and ypbind gets hung as a result?

Sorry, I can't parse what you're talking about here.

If one is using NYS and ypserv or ypbind dies/hangs then one simply
logs in as root (since the root passwd and things are in
/etc/passwd+/etc/shadow and one keeps "files" ahead of "yp"
in "/etc/nsswitch.conf" line for "passwd") and then restarts
ypserv and/or ypbind if needed.

NYS isn't targeted at every BSD system on Earth. It's targeted at
Linux primarily. The way I see it Linux has a chance to do it right
instead of having to suffer from the same stupid limitations as some
other have.

From the manual page of "ndbm" from a SunOS 4 machine:

     The sum of the sizes of a key/content pair must  not  exceed
     the  internal  block  size (currently 4096 bytes).  Moreover
     all key/content pairs that hash together must fit on a  sin-
     gle  block.   dbm_store()  will return an error in the event
     that a disk block fills with inseparable data.

Need I say more? This limits the number of (for examples) group members
in a NDBM-version of /etc/group to prox 4096/(sizeof(username)+1), less
than ca 1000 users. Ever wondered why Sun's YP has the same limitation
with regard to the number of users in a group...?

I'd much rather use the new Berkeley DB (that is used in the new
Sendmail v8) that doesn't have these stupid limitations.

                              STRAW POLL
                     Linux groups automonitoring

Votes must be received by 23:59:59 UTC, Thu 17 March 1994.

This vote is being conducted by a neutral third party.  For voting
questions only contact rdippold@qualcomm.com.  For questions about the
proposal contact Ian Jackson <iwj@cam-orl.co.uk>.


 PROPOSAL (Ian)

 I propose to set up an auto-response daemon which will scan the
 newsgroups  comp.os.linux.misc, .help, .development and .admin.

 It will send email to the posters of any messages which either
  (a) do not include one of a set or recognised keywords in the
      Keywords line or
  (b) are crossposted between two or more of the groups listed above,
      without a Followup-To header being used to direct followups
      into no more than one of those groups (plus perhaps one or more
      groups outside the comp.os.linux hierarchy).

 The email will be a brief, friendly introduction to the newsgroup in
 question and the hierarchy in general - probably based on Matt Welsh's
 introduction to the comp.os.linux hierarchy and my daily postings in
 comp.os.linux.misc and .help.

 It will say where the FAQs are, why to read them, and where to get
 them.

 It will also say why the message has been sent to the user, and give a
 brief explanation of why Keywords are a good thing and/or why
 crossposting is a bad thing (as appropriate).

 I would determine the set of allowable keywords with assistance from
 the Linux community; I expect the set to change quite frequently, and
 there to be a dozen or two at most.

 The existence of my daemon would be documented in a regular posting to
 the groups (preferably as part of an existing regular posting).

 Note that this proposal will NOT prevent anyone from posting and does
 not involve marking the groups as moderated.                         
                                                                      
 I hope to be able to provide an email-to-news gateway that will be   
 allow users with retarded software to post with Keywords lines.      


 RATIONALE (Ian)

 During the recent discussion in news.groups regarding my original
 proposal to moderate col.* using a program, several people suggested
 that perhaps many of the "poor" posts do not come from first-time
 posters, and that therefore it would be sufficient to send email to
 posters whose postings did not have one of a set of approved keywords.

 Doing so would allow experienced users to start using killfiles to
 read only postings they believe they would find interesting, based on
 keywords, since any users posting without such keywords would be
 informed by the daemon that and why their posting might not get the
 attention they would wish for it.


HOW TO REPLY

Subject: Problem with NET-2 and Winsock Gopher/HTTP clients?
Date: 10 Mar 1994 11:39:54 GMT

Hey, y'all.  This is kinda an oddball question, but it came up late last week
on the gn-main list for users of the GN Gopher/HTTP server.  A little work
leads me to believe that we're looking at a glitch in NET-2, but I thought
I'd check here before I pester the NET-2 developers.

Here's the scenario.  I'm running the Yggdrasil release of Linux (kernel p14),
and another site running Slackware (kernel version unknown, I forgot to ask)
has reported the same problem.  We can serve Gopher/HTTP to X clients, Mac
clients, and OS/2 clients without problems.  Same goes for curses clients.
However, when we attempt to serve Gopher/HTTP to any app that uses the
Winsock DLL (e.g., BCGopher, WinMosaic, Cello), some really odd stuff happens.
On occasion, we can move graphical images to the client without problems.
Usually, though, the transfer of data is not completed.  The client shows that
the file has been moved, but nothing happens.  No decompression, no pretty
pictures, nothing.  It appears that there is some sort of timing problem with
Winsock clients who try to connect to a GN server running under Linux.

My first reaction was to blame the Winsock client, but all of the ones I've
tested work just fine with other systems.  Plus, the other guy ran a sniffer
trace that seemed to indicate to him that the communication was timing out
from the Linux box.  (I dunno how to read the trace report, but if anybody
wants to see it, let me know and I'll be happy to mail a copy.)  I'm pretty
sure the problem ain't with GN, since I can use WinMosaic to connect to other
GN servers without trouble.

My conclusion is that we've probably uncovered a fairly minor bug in NET-2.
Does this seem reasonable, or have I missed more than my usual quota of
something?  If it helps, my box is a 386-40 (we built it ourself) with 8 megs
of RAM and a Longshine LCS-8634 (NE2000 clone) ethernet board.  The other guy
is also using an NE2000 clone, I think, so there is also a remote chance
that the problem is with the NE2000 driver and clone boards.  I dunno.

Any advice/information will be most appreciated, especially if it will help me
figure out who to bother first with this problem.

Thanks!

_Of course_ it loses precision.  But the difference reported was far
larger than you'd expect from that.

The point still stands.  I took the liberty of posting a short
summary and the test program to comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware.chips so
that the folks out there can try it too.  We'll see what happens.
Is it Linux?  Is it GCC?  Is it AMD?  Or some obscure interaction
