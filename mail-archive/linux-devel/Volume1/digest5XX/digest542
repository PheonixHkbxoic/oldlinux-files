Huh?  Who replaced this with variable bit density zones?  Not on the Mac or

Maybe I didn't word that right...  What I intended to say was the variable
speed capability of 800k capable Mac drives would be hard to fake in
software.  But writing GCR on an MFM drive _should_ be possible if the
controller circuitry is sufficiently flexible.  Just doing GCR may not be
good enough to read 800k disks on a PC 1.4M drive, and I doubt that using
variable bit density zones would be good enough either.  Of course I could
be wrong.  At any rate, I think it is highly unlikely that anyone will
ever write a driver or program for Linux to read 800k Mac floppies...  since
they are being phased out there isn't much incentive to do so anyway...

You should certainly learn how to compile your own kernel...

Subject: Error with ld when trying to use CheckerV0.3 (ld.so.1.9l.4) on linux
Date: Thu, 10 Mar 1994 05:38:46 GMT

I am trying to get the Checker program (V0.3) to work and
am having trouble with ld when I try to run Checker.

Specifically , I am running linux-0.99.15, and I just installed
gcc2.5.8, libc.4.5.21, and CheckerV0.3  (I installed all of the 
above as I wanted to use Checker !! and the README said I needed
a gcc at least 2.5 something (I was at gcc2.4.5 before) ).

In installing the above I installed ld.so.1.9l.4.

After all this when I try to compile a program with checkergcc I get:
# checkergcc test.c -o test
ld: unrecognized option `-checker'
Usage: ld [-d] [-dc] [-dp] [-e symbol] [-l lib] [-n] [-noinhibit-exec]
       [-nostdlib] [-o file] [-r] [-s] [-t] [-u symbol] [-x] [-y symbol]
       [-z] [-A file] [-Bstatic] [-D size] [-L libdir] [-M] [-N]
       [-static] [-nojump] [-dll-verbose] [-S] [-T[{text,data}] addr]
       [-V prefix] [-X] [file...]

I tried to use the ld.diff file (that came with the CheckerV0.3)
to make a new ld.so
, but it seemed wildly different
than the ld.c file the diff file was compared against (the ld.diff
file starts it's changes at line 1154, and the ld.so.c file
for ld.so.1.9l.4 has only 458 lines.

Can you help/ any suggestions ?

Thanks,

I thinks there's a new bug here.  I also noticed LOTS of serial overruns on
one occasion from my *mouse*.  This is for the first time ever, with ALPHA-1.0.
The condition persisted until I rebooted.  Haven't seen it since.

Of course, I am now also running with my hd.c enhancements for Multiple-mode
and IRQ-enabling, so interrupt latency is no longer a big problem.

Subject: Linux pre-1 bug with NFS
Date: 9 Mar 94 21:37:09 GMT

I had a NFS server crash on me today while I was running a "df"
command, so I switched to another V.C. and issued the command
kill -9 pid, where pid was the pid of the df command.
Normally this works, since I mount the server with the options
(intr,soft) but this time, the process just sat there with
a "D" in the ps status field forever, no matter how many times
I sent it a kill signal.  This used to work in previous versions,
so it leads me to believe that it might be a bug.  Thanks!

I have an AMD 486DX-40, running at 50MHz (overclocked).  I just
compiled the AMD floating point bug "demo" using PCC (Personal C
compiler, which is shareware).  It uses real mode, with 64k segments
and all that, but that shouldn't affect the floating point processor.

I passed the test.  No bugs here, at least not in the circumstances
present when I ran it.  I am willing to run it again if anyone can
suggest circumstances likely to tickle a bug.  I cannot run Linux - at
least not until I get the new hard drive!

Sorry, I don't know a serial # for the chip - I would have to remove
the motherboard in order to get the chip fan off.

I was wrong here. It depends on reason for disconnect.
After loss of carrier it works fine. If disconnect
on close, then problems are present.
BUT it even did not assert DTR when there are active
processes like compile, ....

Tech info: 386SX 25MHz 16450 speed 19200
RTS/CTS flow control, modem Hayes ULTRA 96.

After successful uucp session next two
attempts gives I/O error. On third attempt
connection goes fine again. If I run cu
the same problem after session if I disconnect
by ~. If disconnect initiated by remote side
everything is fine.

So the problem somehow related with tty output queue.
May be the modem drops CTS very fast
after DTR going off?
I am also puzzled by long delay (about 1 second) between
open of line and DTR assertion.

Actually, mine (running on a 386 with pl15d) runs to completion.
After a minute or two, it reports:

Memory mallocatable ~= 1045497 Kbytes

This on a machine with 8M RAM, 10M Swap.  1 GB allocated?
Pretty good!  A more useful(?) version of that program would
try _using_ the memory it has allocated, as any _real_
program would.  Then the pages would actually get mapped,
and you would get a realistic answer.  It is scary seeing
your swapspace fill up steadily, though!

The Adaptec 152x driver, which has been in the kernel for some time,
will work with that chip.  Use a recent kernel, because the earlier
version of the driver didn't work quite right on some fast connections
to the 6260, like LB and MB-direct ones.

Well, it has certainly been around for a while (it was there in the pl10
MCC kit that I ran last year ...) but I think most people use 'host'.  
This one bothered me, too, so I finally got around to looking at it a 
few days ago.  I fetched the newest version of the bind kit for Linux
that I could find.  I'm not sure at the moment whether this came from
sunacm.swan.ac.uk or from sunsite.unc.edu.  [ Aside - does anyone know
of an ftp client that logs your fetches ??? ]

I never got past compiling nslookup - it worked perfectly, out of the box.

Since I'm not sure where I got it, I've put a .tgz file of the nslookup
source (and binaries) in pub on nepahwin.cs.laurentian.ca - if you want
to fetch it from there.

Subject: Short delays outside of the kernel
Date: Sat, 12 Mar 1994 16:29:33 GMT

I'm in the process of building a EPROM/Microcontroller board. I'm planning
on writing the software under linux. One of the requirements is to have
a very short (100 uS) pulse to program the parts.

I've examined the kernel because I remembered that BogoMips had something
to with short delays. This led me to linux/delay.h and the __delay and
udelay calls. Seems straightforward enough.

I have two questions:

1) Can I use these calls outside the kernel? Since they are inlines I don't
   think that's a big problem except getting access to loops_per_second.

2) Bigger problem. is the udelay call interruptable? I examined their 
   use in a couple of the drivers and it wasn't clear to me if interrupts
   were turned off or not. If the udelay call ever got interrupted then
   my poor EPROMS and Microcontrollers would start releasing magic smoke ;-)

I'm curious about the implications of holding the processor for 100 uS
at a time. Does anyone know what kind of effect these delays would have 
on the system.

Lastly I'm willing to use one of the PC hardware timers if it's available and 
can gurantee a 100 +- 5 uS blip on my output line.

Do I need to write a mini device driver to do this or can I run it from
user space?

Thanks for any info you can offer.

BAJ

P.S. The interface board is realy simple. I bought a dual serial card with
an empty socket and interfaced to it some TTL on a perfboard via a DIP
jumper cable. The card gives you 8 decoded I/O ports, a clock, and an
interrupt plus an extra serial port. Cost less than a empty proto card
from Rat Shack.

The (terrible long) title says it all:

I built a kernel with cluster patches 08a included, put this kernel
on a floppy with a minix filesystem and installed lilo on that floppy.
Unfortunately the floppy refuses to boot.  More precisely: the kernel
stops when it should copy the boot floppy into the ram disk.  The screen
reads something like:

RAMDISK: Loading 1200 blocks into RAM diskRAMDISK: I/O error on block 0

It works if leave the cluster patches out.  By the way: My kernel is
version 0.99pl15b.

Any ideas?  Looks like a bug?
