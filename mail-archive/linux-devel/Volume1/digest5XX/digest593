gprof gives me lots of timing data, so I would guess something is
wrong with your installation.

Due to changes in the signal stack (where the signal handler installed
by profil() gets the program counter from) there exist incompatible
combinations of kernel/libc which break timing data from gprof.
Perhaps you should update either your kernel or (more likely) your C
library.

Do you have the line

#include <stdlib.h>

in your code. I have had similar action many times, and I always find
the same bug in my program.

More memory - 8 or for serious work 16Mb, maybe a larger disk. With either
Linux or *BSD you'll need to buy Motif (its not free). Several vendors sell

You can have both on one disk. OS/2 comes with its own boot selector,

I do pretty serious development in 8Mb. For serious C++ work you want 16Mb
(thats more a reflection on gnu C++ liking to waste memory...)

Did you include <stdlib.h>?
This is required on Linux, and isn't on some other systems.

On my A4000/040 with linux 0.08 mount works, in contrast with some other
programs (like sync...). I didn't tried mkfs since I already had a MINIX
file system on my IDE drive (created under 0.07pl4).

The ifconfig syntax is effectively unchanged. There are two fundamental
changes to the system about routing from early pl15 to 1.0 kernels. 
Firstly the route logic was rewritten by Linus to be readable and
logical. Secondly for 1.00-pre the BSD route convention of
route add somesite gw localifaceaddr
was added to allow BSD type route specification and support the 
Berkeley routed.

There are two drivers that work with the board, the Adaptec 1540 driver
in the standard kernel, and the Buslogic alpha driver available from
the usual place (tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/ALPHA/scsi).

You also want to use the cluster patches for improved (perhaps 
by 100%) throughput.

The *only* possible way that the performance patches could cause this
is if you are using multiple mode *without* allowing the driver to
unmask interrupts.

On my system and on many others, the exact opposite behaviour is observed
when the patches are applied and interrupt unmasking is enabled.. the mouse
goes from very unresponsive to more responsive.

Suspicions are because of problems encountered with non-standard implementations
on older drives, and the one common denominator was that all of the troubled
drives supported fewer than 32 sectors in multiple mode.

However, this restriction is removed in the final version (posted yesterday),
which does not enable multiple mode by default for any drive.  Instead, a 
separate program is provided to allow you to tweak the settings on the fly,
to find what works best for your system, if anything.  On troublesome drives,
the error-recovery should still kick in and turn the feature off again if 
there are problems.

Have fun!

Hmmm... I didn't write the IDE driver, but I just had a look at it
while thinking "cache".  After reading from the disk, the driver
doesn't invalidate the instruction cache for the memory into which the
disk sectors were read.  The driver should really do this, since the
IC doesn't know that there is new information in that memory.

I've just seen the ad for getting these cards at $19/29 respectively (limited 2 cards per customer).
Would they both work with the .99p15 and above kernels, since they are NE2000 clones?  Likewise,
since the AE-200JL is software configurable vs the AE-200LC's hardware jumpered, is there a utility
to configure it (or others that are software configurable)?

The problem is that with 32 sectors read at once, you will certainly
lose interrupts. The solution is to enable interrupts during disk
transfer (not to use a 16550 even for the mouse at 1200bps...)

Someone has claimed the following patch doesn't work for all disk
drives.  (No, I don't know which) Careful testing with a r/o partition
first is recommended. The patch is against a 0.99.15something w/o
multi-mode and runs stable in my machine for a long time. If a
multi-mode hd.c doesn't patch with this, replace every insw() with
ninsw() manually, ditto for outsw().

I did not in any way turn off interuupt handling.  I applied the patches
directly on a linux 1.0 kernel without modification and found my mouse to be
completely unusable under X when there is any disk activity.  I really hope
this doesn't make it into the standard kernel as I would have to forever more
use an old kernel (at least until I purchase a scsi disk).
