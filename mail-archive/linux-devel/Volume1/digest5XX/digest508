Yeah, noticed it here too. I was starting bdflush *before* fsck-ing.
Start it *after* fsck-ing and speed is back to normal, with this change:

in wakeup_bdflush() (fs/buffer.c), commented out the printk and sync_buffers
if bdflush_running is false.

Works for me, but not to say I didn't inadvertantly break something... :)

Subject: Patch to scheduler in developemnt : Simple Question
Date: 28 Feb 1994 05:24:45 -0500

        I am working on a patch to the Linux scheduler to reserve a
certain percentage of CPU time for the superuser. This would prevent mere
users from creating so many processors that a superuser couldn't access
the system quickly to fix some damage.

        The system works by keeping track of which processes deserve
special treatement and incrementing an int everytime a process that is
flagged gets a timeslice. It uses a decay function and modifies priorities
such that the superuser processes get increased user level priorities
whenever the decay function indicates cpu use below the threshold which is
set by a system call.

        Now, my question:

        You don't want users who run setuid root programs to count against
the superuser. You don't want logins, gettys and system daemons and stuff to
count either (or do you?). I have to determine during the fork system call
whether to mark the process as part of the special group or not. Is there
some simple algorithm that I haven't thought off?

        I currently do it based on the real user id. Unfortunately this
includes login and update and demon processes. I can't think of an easy
fix. Any ideas?

Okay, it complains about not being able to write /etc/ioctl.save, but
that's more an informative error. It just doesn't write the record, but
it actually doesn't care.

Yup. I only put in shutdown.allow as a feature, if you have problems
with it then just don't create shutdown.allow - then all will be as
it was in init 2.4 (aren't the docs clear about this?)

> had the same problem you have with kill.

I heard. There is a patch on sunsite and tsx-11 for bash. It reckognizes
that the shell it is running on is actually bash, and re-enables the
builtin kill command (you can do that. GNU software can do everything :)

As you know, I'm off the net for half a year. Just wanted to put out a new
version. Some things have changed, but I think for the better. I hope
some distribution makers will pick it up, then it will crystallize
eventually. Things aren't as bad as they seem. I am convinced sysvinit 2.50
is as good, or better, than 2.4.

Hi,

I'm experiencing a real weird problem with my sendmail. I recently
upgraded from 8.6.4 to 8.6.5. Since that time I am unable to send

I really have no clue as to what is going on. At first I thougth the getopt
function that comes with the sendmail src somehow broke the address, but
after some debugging that didn't appear to be the problem.

I'm running linux with gcc-2.5.8 with libc-4.5.19. I've compiled 8.6.6
with optimizing, without optimizing, static linked, but that didn't solve
the problem.

Has anybody got an idea as to what may be going on?

Thanx in advance,

Ed

Subject: TTY bugs
Date: Mon, 28 Feb 94 07:00:29 GMT

These tty bugs exist both in standard pl15h and in the new tty code by 
tytso@athena.mit.edu.

1. /dev/tty0 points to the vc that was active at OPEN time, not
read/write time.
2. If /dev/tty0 is the tty of the process, all access to /dev/tty
returns ENXIO: No such device or address.
3. If /dev/tty0 is the tty of the process, control-c, etc are IGNORED.

This exists in the new tty code:

4. The new tty code hoses the TTY column of procps. It shows con for
processes with no tty, for example.

Any ideas on what needs to be done?  I am willing to help fix these
bugs. The fixes will be relative to the new tty code. I have switched
to using the new tty code, it seems to be a much cleaner interface,
etc. Good work!

P.S. I did send a subscribe message to the new-tty mailing list, but
have not got a confirmation so I am sending this post here for the
time being.  (I don't trust mailing lists too much anymore, ever since
I got dropped from the KERNEL channel by a software glitch). Also, 3
of the 4 bugs listed above exist in the standard pl15h distribuution.

I picked up a copy of the latest NYS and checked out some of the
functions.  There are two serious deficiencies --

1). /etc/shadow is mishandled when it or a single entry doesn't exist.
2). There is no support for DBM files.

The first bug makes an application incapable of determining if an
entry actually exists since getspent() and friends will return the
entry from /etc/passwd instead.  While this might seem to be a favor,
it is imcompatible with SVR[>3].

The second isn't really a bug and the regular C library has this same
shortfall.  The result of this is that if you have a large /etc/passwd
file it takes longer for the last user in the file to login than the
first.

I've not had a chance to look at yp-linux, but if it is based on NetBSD
it probably doesn't have /etc/shadow support at all, though it should
have DBM file support since BSD is where DBM file support comes from ...

How bizarre.  I got this same response in the mail ...

Anyhow, I needed that for something I wrote and it only took a few
hours to whip up.  I will look at the referenced package closer, but
when I looked at it last weekend it appeared to be incomplete and
I wasn't convinced in the least that it would work.  Based on your
posting I suspect I need another look at it.

Of course they do. The more GPV-infected code there is out there, the closer

Because others are exhorting people to use the GPV to license their code, and 
so the question "Is the GPV a Good Thing?" is relevant.

Subject: Adaptec 1542A and kernel panic
Date: 28 Feb 1994 09:19:26 -0800

Hello all,

I am running Linux on a AMD 386/40.  It has IDE hard disk and I 
recently added the 1542A SCSI controller and a LMS CM214 CD-ROM.
Previously, my kernel didn't have SCSI in it.  I recompiled kernel
and everything is working fine. But, the kernil panics after being
idle for a while. The panic message goes some thing lik
"Swapper killed", "Swapper Not syncing" etc.  This panic occurs
even with the kernel without SCSI compiled in it.  Mere presence
of the SCSI controller causes this.  I've tried with 
pl13 and pl15 with same results.  Is this a known problem with
Adaptec 1542A?  

I also have the following, USR SPortster, Actix GE 32 video card.
The 1542 is using IRQ11, DMA 6 and port 0x330.

I appreciate any help you can offer.  I am going nuts with
these panics since I leave the machine on all the time to
