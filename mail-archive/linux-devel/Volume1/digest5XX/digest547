Subject: Linux's vgalib functions blocking bitpad input.
Date: 13 Mar 1994 15:31:31 GMT

Our lab is in the process of converting some of our pcs to Linux, and
I am in the process of compiling some very important digitization
software using Tommy Frandsen's libvga.a. The software runs fine under
X along with the bitpad, but using regular vga, I get no bitpad
errors, but the bitpad also sends no information.

Do any vgalib functions change tty parameters in any way? The bitpad
needs com2's data to be unchanged ... I'm pretty well stumped on this
one, since the bitpad does work under X.

I'm not sure what your asking, but we will be able to run programs compiled
for Windows under Linux.  Also, we will provide a library form of Wine that
will allow you to compile a Windows application under Linux for use on a
Linux system.

Maybe.  There are no cross-compilers running under Linux
capable of generating the Windows executable format.  However, one of
the commercial DOS-based compilers may run under DOSEMU in the future.

   If you have a patch for Seyon (2.1 rev 2) to set HUPCL before closing the
modem device to drop DTR, please mail me a copy or a pointer to it.

   Thank you.
