The Linux floppy drivers do not report write errors to the writing
program.  This is more a case of broken-as-designed than an actual bug.
A real fix probably won't happen in the near future.

You do however get a kernel message if a write error occurs.  If you really
care about the data you write to a floppy, monitor the kernel messages for
the string "floppy I/O error".

If you are running X, you can do this with an Xconsole.  If you are using
a virtual console, you will have to make sure that the `level' of kernel
message printing is correct. There is a command to set this level, but I
can't remember its name right now.  The level may have been set to suppress
floppy kernel messages at boot time in the rc or rc.local file.

In every commercial unix implementation  I've worked with I can make 127.x.x.x
ride the ether, and I can switch it back. But I've always seen the 127 net
defaulted to l0 (loopback) or something like that.

No solution, but an Idea what happens:
Linux puts your notebook into the protected mode and takes control.
If your notebook uses a bios routine that checks for low battery,
than it is not called anymore during use of linux. 
(BTW, that happened to me, when the build in virus-checker did not
 react to lilo boot-block magic, but started to get crazy when installing
 MSDog...)

Well, a simple solution is to use dbmalloc. it's easy to use. Just include
their own malloc.h file, and link with -ldbmalloc. if this does what
you want, hen that would seem easier ... This is the most simple way
of using dbmalloc admittedly, but iot seeme to pick up most of the stupid
errors and works well for me ...

I think it would be nice if the packet was dropped and a message was

You can use gdb.

To see the current assembly instruction, I use:

display/i $pc

To see the registers: info regs

To disassemble the current function:

disassemble

To disassemble a block of code:

disassemble $pc $pc+0xA0

In your .gdbinit in the default directory I have some macros for all
this (def r as info regs, and the like).

To single step in assembler, you use: nexti and stepi (the
corresponding next and step instructions but for assembly).

Hope this helps,
Miguel.

I wonder whether there could be done something about this. Suppose you
could test the write protection status of the floppy without writing to
it. Suppose furthermore that mount() calls the init routine of the 
floppy driver. As we are at it, suppose that mount() tells the floppy
driver that it wants to access the floppy in a read/write fashion and 
not just readonly. 
Couldn't the floppy driver return an error, similar to the one you get
if there is no floppy at all in the drive? This would lead to a behaviour
where you couldn't use a write protected floppy at all, unless you mount
it read-only. This is somewhat more strict than now, where you can mount 
it read/write and get the errors later, but nevertheless, it seems
cleaner to me...

However, there is a philosophy problem involved, as far as I see it,
which is that the use of the drive for read or write is not really
clear at mount time, is it? The thing is, if it is possible, I would
gladly do it, if somebody could point out to me a) whether it makes
sense and b) where. My idea is to forbid opening the floppy device as
read/write if the floppy is write protected. An idea (as far as I see
now) would be to make floppy_ready() in floppy.c garble somthing or
other, so mount barfs or return somthing sensible somewhere, but all
the functions with promising names in floppy.c are void...

I think it's possible to add a new ioctl command to test write protection,
so mount could be patched to use this. But one would have to implement
all that in every single blk-driver written so far, which is clearly
too much work. How are CD-ROMs handled? Is it the filesystem that account
for R/O mounting?

As I said, if somebody could point out where, I'd gladly patch the floppy
routines.

Hi,

I'm quite new to linux and I hope this message is in the right newsgroup !
I got to work on the release 0.99 patchlevel 13.
I have to analyse the signals system and I encounter some problem with it.
In signal.c , in the do_signal function, there are some lines I can't
understand.
Here is one:
__asm__("bsf %2,%1\n\t"
        "btrl 1,%0"
        :"=m" (current->signal),"=r" (signr)
        :"1" (signr));

Of course, I know this is ASM and bsf is "bit scan forward" (if I remember)
but I dont understand the %i, \n, \t, "=m",....

If someone can explain me this line, or better tell me the principle of ASM
in linux code (so I wont have to ask for each ASM line I encounter) it will
greatly help  me.

Another thing: If anyone has docs and explanations on the signal code,
please send this to me.

I have put ISO 8859 fonts (for all 10 sets) on ftp.uni-erlangen.de
in pub/doc/ISO/charsets/isofont*. They have been made by Kosta
Kostis. They are available in all the usual VGA resolutions.
Perhaps you'd like to add them to your kbd package. (The ftp

Subject: select
Date: 15 Mar 94 10:07:30 GMT

A while ago I posted a request/comment about the select system call -- that
it doesnt properly timeout.

I missed the followup thread, but someone else has said to me that the 
consensus was that I wasnt filling in the timeval record properly. (Some 
people made the same comment to me privately).

Forgive me if I am wrong, but I believe that I DO fill out the timeout value,
and here is the offending code:

static int ns_select(long time_out)
{
  fd_set rset,wset,eset;
  struct timeval timeout;
  int status;
  int mask = sigblock(sigio_mask);      /* block SIGIO signals */

again:
  FD_ZERO(&rset);
  FD_ZERO(&wset);
  FD_ZERO(&eset);
  FD_SET(ns_socket, &rset);

  timeout.tv_sec = time_out;
  timeout.tv_usec = 0L;
  status = select(ns_socket+1,&rset,&wset,&eset,&timeout);

  if (status == -1) {
    if (errno == EINTR)
      goto again;
    else {
      perror("select() error ");
      CloseAddressBook();
      exit(1);
    }
  }

  sigsetmask(mask);
  return(status);
}

This program is called just once (I have another select for other purposes) 
at the startup of my system:

  if (ns_select(TIMEOUT) && read_msg(&msg, &ns, ns_socket)) {

where TIMEOUT is #defined:

#define TIMEOUT 5L              /* max time (secs) to wait for nameserver */

The behaviour that is exhibited is that the select returns immediately, with a
value of 1 (i.e., one FD ready).
A subsequent recvfrom system call on the `ready' FD returns the error 
ECONNREFUSED (which is a TCP -level error message on a UDP system call).

Now, if someone can identify the bug in this code I would be grateful and
humbled. 
I would just add the final comment that this program compiles and executes 
correctly under sunos 4.1.3

What exactly does "not convinced" mean?  If you are putting packets
destined for 127.rrr.rrr.rrr on the wire, you're losing.

Without regard to how the machine is set up, 127 is loopback.  I have
appended some of the appropriate RFC sections below.



RFC 1340        "Assigned Numbers"
                (Reynolds & Postel)

   There are certain special cases for IP addresses [11].  These special
   cases can be concisely summarized using the earlier notation for an
   IP address:

         IP-address ::=  { <Network-number>, <Host-number> }

            or

         IP-address ::=  { <Network-number>, <Subnet-number>,
                                                         <Host-number> }

         [...]


         (g)   {127, <any>}

            Internal host loopback address.  Should never appear outside
            a host.




RFC 1166        "Internet Numbers"
                (Kirkpatrick, Stahl & Recker)

         [...]

   Special Addresses:

      In certain contexts, it is useful to have fixed addresses with
      functional significance rather than as identifiers of specific
      hosts.

         [...]

         The class A network number 127 is assigned the "loopback"
         function, that is, a datagram sent by a higher level protocol
n         to a network 127 address should loop back inside the host.  No
         datagram "sent" to a network 127 address should ever appear on
         any network anywhere.

         [...]

Class A Networks

* Internet Address   Network          Name               References
- ----------------   -------          ----               ----------
 *127.rrr.rrr.rrr    Loopback        Loopback              [JBP]




RFC 1537        "Common DNS Data File Configuration Errors"
                (P. Beertema)

         [...]

   Also each nameserver should run primary for 0.0.127.in-addr.arpa;
   that zone file should contain a SOA and NS record and an entry:

         1    PTR     localhost.

   There has been extensive discussion about whether or not to append
   the local domain to it. The conclusion was that "localhost." would be
   the best solution; reasons given were:
