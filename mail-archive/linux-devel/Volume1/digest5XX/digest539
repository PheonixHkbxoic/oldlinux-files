This problem might be related to telnet hangs when telneting from a pc with
crynwr packet drivers and Clarkson univerity telnet or winqvt telnet with
winsock.dll to a linux computer. I in general get a hanging connection when
scrolling too fast. Changing to v mode in elvis and holding the cursor down
key with winqvt telnet is a very effective method to expose this problem.
If I connect with a Convex Unix computer as intermediary or directly between
2 linux computers I do not get these hangs. The problem was less severe with
a pl15f kernel and got worse again with pl15j and pre-1 kernel. The pl15f
kernel works much better than a pl14 or pl15 kernel and is probably the
best choice for providing service until this problem gets fixed for good.
I in general use a 386DX33 with 8 MB and NE2000 clone as linux computer,
but a 486DX66 with the Debian release 0.91 and a 486DX33 have shown the same
problem.

* No gettys on the serial ports *
When I first boot my machine, I can run kermit as much as I want with no 
problems.  My first DIP script runs fine, but when I kill DIP via kill -9 pid,
enter kermit, enter hang command to hang up modem, I have to re-boot!
DIP now gives me the error in the subject, or sometimes it hangs when setting
the port to ttyS0.  Kermit starts, then hangs untill I enter CTRL-C, which
brings me to the kermit prompt.  When I enter 'connect' I get

I don't think any 3.5" format pays any attention at all to the index hole
or its motor-position simulacrum; both MFM and GCR formats encode the
sector number in the block headers, so what use would the index thing be?

The Mac drives don't even have a wire to return the index information on.

No, it used GCR, which is more effective than the FM encoding used on these
disks by other manufacturers. FM needs two transitions per bit, while GCR
needs five transitions per four bits. Or something like that.

To get back to the topic at hand: An Amiga file system would be useful even
if you can't read the floppies. Amigas have hard disks too, after all, and
Linux is being ported to the Amiga, so...

I am beaten by my boss to make answering system for customer inquiry.
Currently I have a ZyXEL U-1496E+ and I want to do it under my Linux
box - one reason to persuade my boss to change some machines into Linux
:-). I did take a look at some DOS,WINDOWS,OS/2 but those application
are more or less specifically for an answering machine only. What I need
is a more flexible script/language to play with so that I can log
customer's information through touch tone and am able to respond
instructively. Any one can point me to a right direction? May be some of
you have done this before. Some *free* code will be very useful to me.
BTW, I can do c but have little idea in communication devices on a
unix.

I think X restores the font that was present at startup.
It is easy to make the kernel remember the font, or even
to have a separate font for each vt, but in my opinion
this is a waste of memory.

If you have freely distributable stuff, and it is not too much,
you might send it to me - I would probably put it into kbd-0.86.

Hi,

I tried to figure out wherther there is a driver for the NCR53C700-66 as 
used on the NexStor NXT-82 or Forex FR 600 AF. 
In the SCSI-HOWTO as of Jan 22 1994 it says there is development 
effort under way, but not publically available yet.

Is this still true or is there some driver available now?

Does anyone have any experince with the above mentioned boards (one of 
the developers).

I'd sure like to know how they'd compare to some of the other 
available SCSI adapters.

Not exactly, I think... I use bootlin and I remember it had to be
runned from the config.sys, and not from a "Running DOS environment".
It was explained why in the README (Thid could be an hint...). Or I am
using a very old version?

Not close enough!  If you code with K&R style function prototypes (as

I have to code for a variety of machines not all of which support ANSI

You call them on the phone.
Alternately, you wait for them to come back, and fire them.
Alternately, you set up a small cron job which checks every few minutes if
the YP server is still answering questions, and if not you kick it out and
start a new one.
Alternately, since the original question was what to do if  you have a
too-big passwd file, you replace the linear lookup in the passwd file
with gdbm access and forget about yp.

Sometimes, the simple but reliable solution doesn't scale well enough to be
useable.

I don't care if you're using YP or Hesiod or whatever to access an
/etc/passwd equivalent. I only care that (a) it works (b) is reasonably
secure  (c) is reasonably reliabe. In my book, YP does satisfy (c),
though it arguably falls a bit short otherwise, especially with (a).  ;-)

You could take a look at Gert Doering's mgetty+sendfax package. I have
added some support for ZyXEL voice operations, the changes are included
in the more recent versions. Try sunsite.unc.edu:
linux/system/Serial/mgetty*.

Normally `vgetty' acts like a normal answering machine with
fax/data capability, but you can call a shell script immediately
after picking up the phone and handle the touch tone commands
using shell commands, i.e.:

        CODE=`zplay -DS messages/TypeYourPhoneNumberNow`

would play back a recorded message and store DTMF tones received
in the environment variable $CODE.
