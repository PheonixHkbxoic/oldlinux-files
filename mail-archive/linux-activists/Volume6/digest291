The Binkley port is based off of the AtariST port, which was based off of
BT pre-2.50.  Granted, it isn't based off of the most current version, but
it adds a few things that the currently released version doesn't have (EMSI
sessions is a prime example).

Thus far, it works for me.  Now if I could get rfmail to give decent SeenBy
lines, I'd be all set to take off the last reason I boot DOS by default...

Why? I'm a developer. I want something that I can play with that I can't get

My parents have a design program I wrote under DOS, but we now want in under
windows (and may sell it), and then I'm interested in NT. I had several
responses to this post (thanX everyone, I replied to most by email, but
several addresses bounced), many of which had MSDOS/Linux/NT

>anyone out there have the correct Xconfig settings for the

This file describes the X configuration for the GW2k 66V with ATI GUP.

The ATI Graphics Ultra Pro card can emulate the ATI Wonder Plus. It is this
driver for the Wonder Plus that we use. The Xfree server reports upon startup
which driving frequencies can be used. Fortunately these frequencies are not all
the frequencies the card supports. Additional frequencies are 

            80, 110, 126 and 135 MHz.

The ATI board has 1MB memory (by the way, the Xfree driver does not support 
more). If a ratio is 4:3 is obeyed (the traditional TV H:V ratio) the 
resolution that comes closest to 1MB is 1184x880 (if the number of horizontal 
pixels is a multiple of 8, which is a requirement of the driver). More popular 
is the resolution 1152x900 because it allows for more horizontal text lines. 
Both entries can be found in the Xconfig example below.

The 15" monitor of Gateway is the 1572FS. This monitor has a maximum
horizontal frequency of 64 kHz (see page 10 of the monitor manual).

Experimentally I found that (for the 1572FS) :

. The horizontal sync pulse should come as least .32 usec after the last
  displayable pixel. Smaller values tend to truncate the line.

. The monitor needs 3 usec between horizontal lines (to sweep from right to
  left).

. The monitor needs .37 msec between two frames (to sweep from bottom to top)

The higher the driving frequency, the higher the screen refresh rate. For the
driving frequencies 110 MHz and higher the horizontal frequencies are above
64 kHz (outside the 1572 FS spec). So we use 80 MHz for the 1572FS. In terms of
the 'video.tutorial' this translates into:

80 MHz  ->   1 clock pulse = 0.0125 usec
D1 > .32 usec = 25.6 pulses      -> D1   =  32 pulses
D2+S > 3 usec = 240  pulses      -> D2+S = 240 pulses
One line is at least 1152+32+240 pixels = 17.8 usec. Therefore a delay of 
20 lines between two frames is the absolute minimum.

This results in:

N=1184 D1=32 S=240 D2=0 V=880 Vsync=2 Vdelay=20 or
N=1152 D1=32 S=240 D2=0 V=900 Vsync=2 Vdelay=20

Experimentally the best results are obtained for :

"1184x880"   80    1184 1224 1464 1464    880  880  882  902
"1152x900"   80    1152 1184 1424 1424    900  900  902  922

Note that the 1572FS monitor is the bottleneck and that higher refresh rates
are reachable with faster monitors (horizontal frequencies above 64 kHz).

hello?

on *BSD, HZ is 100, and has been for a long time.  (This includes {386,
Free,Net}BSD).

on SunOS, it's 60, for "compatibility reasons" or something like that.

on Ultrix, it appears to be something like either 100 on some
machines, or 256 on others (they've removed the #define, and
replaced it with an entry in a cpu configuration table, or so it
would seem).


but for {386,Free,Net}BSD, you're definitely wrong, hz is 100,
and always has been.
