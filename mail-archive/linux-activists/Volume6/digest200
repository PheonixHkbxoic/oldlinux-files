Subject: Problems with NET-2 and pl12
Date: 3 Sep 93 10:28:10 GMT

Hi,
        I have been having some strange problems with pl12.  From some
previous problems I see that the new kernel is stricter with routing etc.
Here is a synopsis of the problems.

1. I can't get access to machines on the local network.  All machines outside
of the local net are fine.  On checking netstat I find that my machine does
realize that another machine is trying to make a connection and it gives 
a SYN_RECV but then hangs.  I have gotten aroung this problem by directly
putting the ip addresses of the local machines into the routing table. Is this
the correct way of including machines on the localnet ?  By the way I am using
a remote nameserver and a gateway to the outside world.  in.telnetd processes
are also started for each connection that tries to get through.  

2. After reading NET-2-FAQ and trying to follow it through I am also having 
problems.  The FAQ specifies that the loopback and at least the local net
should be specified in /etc/networks.  I have found that if my local net is
included in /etc/networks, all the route add commands end up with a 
SIOADDRT: Network is unreachable error.  And the routing table ends up with
a route localnet that cannot be removed.  If the localnet entry is deleted 
from /networks then the routing table is okay.  

3. After the daemons ( nfsd , routed etc) are run the routing table is 
modified vs. looking at the routing table without running the daemons.  Is
that to be expected ?

4. I have found that telnet sessions to the linux machine crash consistently
while running NCSA Telnet 2.5b for the Macintosh.  The PC versions of NCSA
telnet and pctcp's tn all seem to work fine.  ?????

Any advice and assistance would be appreciated.  Is there a book or docs out
there yet other than NET-2-FAQ that go into more detail about TCP/IP routing
networks, etc ?

Thanks,


Pramod John

Date: 3 Sep 1993 17:41:56 GMT

Hello. I am trying to get Linux to co-exist on my OS/2 2.1 machine
by using the OS/2 Boot Manager. I am having troubles.

When I boot off the Yggdrasil floppy (and use the CDROM), things
go right -- I can boot up. When I log into INSTALL, and prepare to
update the partition info on the disk, it tells me it can't read 
device 0800.

I am using a clone 486/25 CONTAQ motherboard, 32Mbytes of RAM, 256KB
cache, Adaptec 1542B SCSI controller with a 240MB Maxtor drive.

Does any one know what I am doing wrong? Or what I should be doing?

Many thanks for your time,

Subject: Will Linux run MSDOS applications (which use DMA/interrupts)?
Date: 3 Sep 1993 13:31:51 -0500

We like everything I've heard/read about Linux, and we are considering
installing it on our PeeCees here.  However, we have some reservations ...
We're hoping somebody in these newsgroups can clear this up for us.

We have several MSDOS applications which use add-on DSP/A-to-D boards and
we don't want to lose this functionality if we convert to the Linux
environment. 

(1) How does Linux deal with MSDOS applications?  Is it reliable?
    Can it support real-time applications such as A/D and D/A?
(2) Will any special drivers need to be written/installed for Linux to 
    run MSDOS applications which do low-level I/O?  If so, I assume that
    software like this is application-specific.  Is this correct?
(3) If the DOS emulator currently won't handle these situations, is there
    work underway to address this, or am I hoping for too much from Linux?

Thanks for any and all info.

we here a lot about running ms-windows apps on linux boxes, but there are
much better user interfaces than windows, for example NeXT Step. this is
why i am wondering if there are any activities to build a next-linux

maybe it would be sufficient to have a source-code compatibility. is it true

   I'm just updated to SLS 1.03 and I need to an uncompressed kernel image
   to use for bootlin. How can I uncompress the zImage file in the root
   directory? Can this be done without the kernel source?

bootlin should be able to work using the zImage file; have you tried
this?

Otherwise, there is no way short of recompiling the kernel from source.

I have 2 IDE drives and one SCSI drive.  Since I have 2 IDE drives, my SCSI
drive is NOT controlled by the adapter BIOS.  It takes a driver to use it.

As I understand it, OS/2 Bootmanager doesn't understand SCSI that isn't
controlled by the adapter BIOS.  OS/2 apparently can't even boot off the
SCSI drive in this situation, because it doesn't understand SCSI (thats not
controlled by the adapter bios) until the device driver gets loaded.

I don't know if this is true or not, it just seems to be the case - can
someone enlighten me on this?

Thanks,

If you can't find xvt, look for rxvt.  It's slightly more stripped down.

Actually, from what I can gather, the only one not coordinating is
Bill Jolitz himself, since he refuses to let anyone see anything til
he decides to grace the world with his next new great release.  It's
been over a year since his last year.

On the other hand, the NetBSD and FreeBSD development groups
cooperate, and in fact, share code and new developments with each
other.  They're on quite friendly terms and have a "working"
relationship.

I run NetBSD.  I love it and will not move to anything else unless
something truly momentous were to happen elsewhere.  This is my
opinion.

The main differences are: 386BSD, the core of them all.  NetBSD and
FreeBSD are derivatives of the original 386BSD work.  386BSD hasn't
been improved in over a year by its author, but has a "patchkit" that
helps it along.  I would view this as a tedious and masochistic system
to install.

FreeBSD is the patchkit taken to an entirely seperate release.  It's
fairly close to the original 386BSD for those who want to stay there,
but with mucho bug fixes and upgrades.

NetBSD is a completely current work apart from 386BSD.  Although its
original source started with 386BSD, the massive amount of changes to
the kernel and other things qualify this as a totally seperate system.
The NetBSD maintainers have stated a few main goals (from *my*
understanding): a) The most stable, bugfree, production quality
release possible in a free unix, b) As complete as possible compliance
with 4.3BSD and Net/2, c) Incorporate as much of 4.4BSD as possible,
as it evolves, d) Buildable on as many architectures as possible
(386/486 currently in production, Amiga & HP300 in beta, many others
in alpha testing).

All three are true BSD unixes and are based on 4.3BSD for the most
part.  They all also incorporate Berkeley Net Release 2 networking
code to a varrying degree (the stuff in 4.3 and 4.4BSD).

I hope I haven't erred too much in my analysis. :-)

Linux is a completely different beast.  I haven't installed it and I
don't want it, but I know people who run it.  It works for certain
people, and more power to them.  We're all different. :-) Linux is not
based on any particular pre-existing unix, but is a built-from-scratch
OS designed to be posix compliant, and SysV/BSD compliant where
possible.  It's development is a bit more erratic, but productive.
It's kernel structure is not as clean, having had things piled on top
to add functionality many times.  Until recently, its networking was
not at all complete.  They have recently adopted Net/2, but it is
still somewhat buggy.  The advantage of Linux is that it has shared
libraries so uses much less memory and disk space.  Also, its rumored
to co-exist with DOS better, but this may be more opinion than fact.

Hello back.
I wouldn't consider what I have as a working dos system.(yet)
but I just got it to respond correctly yesterday.
this is the jist of a README file I had in my release:
mount your dos partition to /usr/dos
format a dos system disk, no autoexec.bat or config.sys
put it in your drive.
My existing dos binary was screwed up for some reason, so
I just rm'd it and ran make in /usr/src/dosemu
staying in that dir I ran ./dos > /dev/null
this caused my a: to whirl, and I had dos 5.0 on A:
go to C: drive, and run "LINUX.EXE D"
this puts what ever partition that is mounted to /usr/dos
on your "D:" drive.
that is as far as I have gotten. Can't run much, but it is
definitely dos.

Hello folks.
I am not on the Internet, and have to comb the bbs's
about to find any information that I need.
With much heartache, headache, and a few cartons of 
cigarettes, I have successfully configured my display
to show me X.  And let me start off by saying, I am impressed!
this looks at least as good as Xview, which I spent megabucks
for.  I do however have a few problems to clear up, and
hope that someone would be good enough to give me some feedback.
First, I am running a HP 386/25 with 12Meg ram.
I have SLS 1.0, running 0.99.pl6-30
I have tcp/ip running well, with a 3c503 card attached.
I have (your choice) a HP Bus mouse (the old style, not ps/2)
and a microsoft serial mouse.

1. my Serial ports are autoconfigure in the kernel and they come up
with the same memory and IRQ as MSD.EXE does.
whether or not my Xconfig file says :
Busmouse "/dev/mouse"
Microsoft "/dev/ttys0" or
Microsoft "/dev/ttys1" I get the same response:
When I run X I can see the mouse cursor, but it just does not respond.

2. as I said, tcp/ip works great. (what performance!)  however
when I run X it says "Setting TCP SO_LINGER: Protocol not available.
no SIOCGIFCONF
Where did I go wrong?

3. when I do a ctrl-alt-F2 to get another screen, it works great.
how do I jump back to tty1? that is , w/o getting the text config
screen. (I want to return to X)

4. Lastly, I have literally, 4 3 ring binders of FAQ's and README's
(my wife thinks I'm nuts, and I should just buy Unix if I want it)
But I enjoy seeing the ins and outs, being I admin SCO and HP/UX at
work, and know little about how everything works together.
Is there a FAQ that focuses on troubleshooting?  Linux
has many verbose errormessages, and if I knew where to look
when I get one, it would have aided my installation.

Oh, and thanks to all that helped make Linux possible.  I hope
to do serious development soon on it so I can donate to the cause
as well.
 (PS if anyone gives me an Internet address to find info,
 again, I have no access. Would someone please put up a BBS
 that remains quit current?  I will call just about anywhere
 in the US)

        Thank you to Unix people of vision. :)
