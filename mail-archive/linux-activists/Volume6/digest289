Subject: Need screen manager alternative to Curses.. Vitamin C for Linux?
Date: 6 Oct 93 00:31:53 GMT

I am developing applications for UNIX and DOS which need to have screen
management (data entry boxes, menus, etc.)  I have been using curses
but it is unpredictable on different terminals and ugly these days, 
anyway.  I have seen Vitamin C for Coherent/SCO/Ultrix/DOS/etc. adver-
tised, and it comes with full source, so has anyone got it to work under
Linux?  There is also another much more expensive set called PANEL Plus
II which I gather is just about the same thing.  I would be interested 
in knowing if anyone has ported Vitamin C to Linux, or used it at all
with any UNIX or DOS, or whether they have found another package (even
shareware???) which works nicely and makes nice looking stuff?

There is another alternative, which is to be able to write something in
XWindows which I can port to Windows.  Has anyone done this either?

Same thing happened to me on a Laptop 386SX. It hang after the code
to detect the soundcard. However, just after the floppy drive was
detected. A line 'floppy: unexpected interrupt' shown up. And I thought
that has something to do with the hangs. Hope this will help someone
trap down the problem.

I have installed SLS 1.03 and it has this annoying habit. About once a
day, on average, it just hangs. Everything seems hung except you can
still switch between VTs. No other keyboard input works, though, just
VT switching.

Has anyone else seen this or know how to fix?

This is not a problem.  The recent 3c503 drivers select the first free IRQ
line in the set {5, 2/9, 3, 4} at 'ifconfig' time.

386bsd doesn't have shared libraries, does it? If it does, I don't think
they're in common use. It might be more fair to make sure the Linux
binary is statically linked as well.

Well, I might have to be root to properly install that (properly, anyway)
but perhaps not. Regardless, my solution was his: I found the site the program
originates from- there are K&R binaries there which compiled fine under cc.
 
Kinda neat running multiple Xterms over a 9600bps line plus doing Alliance VLSI
CMOS design --usable, but slow.... 
 
BTW, anyone looking to do VLSI for FREE with Linux-- contact
ftp-masi.ibp.fr    - a complete package for VHDL hardware description language
(a limited subset)
via ftp.
 
You may have to get the source & compile using gcc & -fwritable-strings option to 
make the xwindows routing program work...

A long time ago in the history of LINUX (i.e. last year) the only file
system that we had was based on an earlier version of Unix called Minix.
This file system was limited to 64Meg per partition.

Since that time, there have been new file systems created for LINUX
(ext, ext2, xiafs) that allow much larger partitions.  If you are using
one of these file systems, you can ignore the warning from fdisk and
use one large partition.

I would first try doing things manually to make sure that ps and proc fs work
and also to eliminate possible problems (note: you need to be root to do this)::

mkdir /proc
mount -t proc /proc /proc
ps

If this works, then the problem is probably that the line in /etc/fstab
is incorrect (though what you indicated looks right).

If this doesn't work, then you either have an old version of mount or
your kernel was compiled without the proc fs support.

   if someone has done a more careful port and measurement than i, and

Two things to say about this before I see any benchmark figures:

1) When diddling lots of small files or other operations on file
system metastructure, one must consider that Linux uses write-behind
for this and therefore risks serious file system corruption should the
machine crash.  (Back when Linux crashed a couple of times per day for
me, I had no end of file system corruption which caused me to have to
reinstall.  I assume it does not crash that often now, but this is
still a serious bug.)  This also makes Linux's file systems faster.

2) I have no idea how TCP/IP performance will measure, but last I knew
Linux could not fragment packets, forcing small NFS packet sizes (and
thus *extremely* poor NFS write performance) and making it unusable as
a gateway.

If you have ALOT of programming experience, you might try to pick up the 
C source code to BinkleyTerm for DOS and OS/2..  I've heard of a port to 
Linux of it, but it was an old, outdated version..  Course, if you do 
that, you'll have to find some code to compile a version6/7 nodelist as 
well..
 
happy hunting..

Hm, I would say there is a difference between Linux cpio and others,
from the COHERENT manual:
---
cpio is  an archiving  utility that  reads and writes  files in  the format
specified  by the  cpio Archive/Interchange File  Format specified  in IEEE
standard 1003.1-1988.
---
I've used COHERENT's cpio to exchange files with systems like AIX, HP/UX,
Sinix, SCO, Apollo Domain and never had a problem with that.
Tar wasn't compatible accross all this systems.

: I purposefully used cpio to back up my stuff because the manual said

: tar before.

Cpio is more portable, see above.

: I can't reinstall my backup to Coherent and used a different format 
: because Coherent isn't on my hard drive anymore.

Get PAX from raven or MWCBBS, it includes a cpio which meets the IEEE standard
and port it to Linux. Then you should be able to read your archives back.

Subject: using term
Date: 6 Oct 1993 12:33:30 GMT

I have been trying to use term between my linux box at home
and the udel net at school. here is where I am at.
first I make the modem connection with kermit.
then I logon the sun at udel
then I start term on the sun (i got the source compiled there
sourcce from sunsite about a week ago).
then I escape back to my system, try these
        shell out of kermit, start term </dev/modem >/dev/modem &
        then try trsh "nothing appens on screen, but the modem rcv,send blinks"

        if I go back to kermit, I will see a lot of character being displayed.
        meaning I am receiving something.

        also if after shelling again to kermit I do
        echo 00000 > /dev/modem 
        when I come back to kermit, connect, the term on the
        sun is stopped as it should be.

Does anyone have any ideas of what I am doing wrong.
I have posted multiple message, the answers have helped thus far.

the version of linux I am running is 99.p6 (may be to old ??)
the connection is done through a modem pool. baud is 19200.
(maybe I should try 2400, I think i did).

thank you.

While telnetting from a sun to a linux box, the termcap is interpreted

the status bar, the screen gets fixed into inverse colour until (this
