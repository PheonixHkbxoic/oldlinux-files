SLS version: 1.03
Machine1: NEC Powermate 386
Machine2: Amax PC/386

I've installed the SLS v.1.03 release on three machines.  The two
listed above had the same trouble after installing, making a
bootdisk, and trying to boot from that bootdisk.  The trouble that
came about was when I tried to boot from the bootdisk (5.25" floppy
drive A:).  Just after it prints out that it's trying to detect
sound cards (one of the machines has no sound cards and the other
has a PAS), it just sits there and never goes on.  Can anyone help
me get beyond this?  I've been booting from the install disk and
telling LILO to go to the harddisk where it's installed but I'd
really like to get the boot floppy to work.  The boot messages are
included at the bottom of this post.

The third machine that I installed on (an Insight 486 with a PAS16)
boots fine off of it's boot floppy.

Reply-To: jmartin@opus.starlab.csc.com (John A. Martin)

Nicholas Vargish <vargish@sura.net> asks if there is interest in 
forming a Linux User Group in the DC area.  If there is an 
interest, it may be that there is also an unusual oppertunity to 
do so.

If there is interest in forming a Linux User Group in the
Baltimore-Washington DC area (Md., Va., WVa., ...) it might be
worthwhile to consider forming it as a Special Interest Group of
the Capital PC User Group (CPCUG).

Founded in 1982, the CPCUG has almost 5000 members, is a
501(c)(3) scientific and educational organization (ie. it is a
non profit organization contributions to which are
tax-deductible) that is run by volunteers.  The CPCUG has an
infrastructure that provides excellent support for its Special
Interest Groups (SIGs) and provides an opportunity for its SIGs
to make their presence felt by a substantial segment of the local
computer community and of the local community as a whole.

The steps needed to form a CPCUG Linux SIG are simple:

  1.  A SIG Chairman, who must be a member of the CPCUG, must be      
      chosen (this may well be whoever volunteers for the job).

  2.  A SIG becomes a recognized unit within the CPCUG when:

      a.  A meeting is held to discuss the formation of the SIG. 
          All interested parties are invited.  (In my opinion a
          virtual meeting via the Internet might meet this
          requirement.)

      b.  The following documentation is presented to the Board
          of Directors:

          1.  A SIG charter that includes:

              a.  An outline of the purposes, interests, and
                  activities of the proposed SIG.

              b.  An identification of the SIG chairman.

              c.  An estimate and analysis of any expenses or
                  anticipated revenue associated with the
                  activities of the SIG.

          2.  A description of the SIG for the CPCUG newsletter.

          3.  The Board of Directors votes and formally
              recognizes the SIG.  (Current practice is to grant
              provisional recognition for a period of about three
              months before final recognition.)

  3.  In order for a SIG to maintain its status as a recognized
      SIG and keep its membership on the board of directors, the
      following are required:

      a.  The SIG chairman must submit quarterly SIG membership
          rosters.

      b.  The SIG chairman or his representative must attend, as
          a minimum, seven of the Board meetings in the course of
          a year.  (The board normally meets monthly.)

      c.  The SIG must perform one of the following functions
          during the course of a year:

          1.  Give a presentation at the regional meetings.

          2.  Provide an article for the CPCUG newsletter.

          3.  Conduct a training seminar.

There are experienced volunteers who are willing to help in all
aspects of forming and operating a CPCUG SIG.

In exchange for abiding by the bureaucratic requirements above a
SIG benefits from being part of an established ongoing
organization with access to an office, well equipped meeting
places (albeit in competition with others), a BBS (the MIX
301-738-9060), a well edited monthly newsletter (The Capital PC
Monitor (ISSN 0884-0830)), postage for meeting announcements, and
a recognized identity.

Because all meetings of the CPCUG and its units are open to the
public there is no absolute requirement for any member of a CPCUG
SIG other than the SIG chairman to be a member of the CPCUG. 
(Many SIGs define their membership as "those present.")  CPCUG
membership is strongly urged however (like public radio).  The
inducements for CPCUG membership include a subscription to the
Monitor, extended use of the MIX, access to a lending library
(books, etc.), and reduced rates for a number of other services. 
(There is currently a move underway to do Internet access from
the MIX.)

The CPCUG is largely oriented toward the needs of computer
consumers (its logo states "Users Helping Users") but there are a
substantial number of members who are computer professionals and
a fair number of those whose professional computer work is not
solely with PCs.

I am willing to help organize a CPCUG Linux SIG, but I am not in
a position to take the major responsibility because I already
have substantial volunteer commitments.  (I serve as the Chairman
of the Potomac ACM SigAPL Chapter, as the Chairman of the CPCUG
APL SIG, and on a demanding ad-hoc committee of the CPCUG BoD.)

Please indicate your interest in this option for a
Baltimore-Washington DC Linux group by responding to Nicholas
Vargish <vargish@sura.net> whose message I am responding to is 
shown below.  It would be particularly encouraging to have
responses from both present CPCUG members and those who are not!

Cheers  --jam

In the SLS distribution, there are many aliases made in /etc/profile (also ll).
'Cause this file only is executed by a login shell you need to put the wanted
aliases in a file, which is run by the shell every time it starts (for bash
i.e. it's .bashrc in the users home directory).

No it isn't!  not at all.  I called Peter intending to maybe buy SLS from
him.  I asked about the ad and was told that the Win 3.1 stuff hadn't been
sent to him or somesuch.  Kind of stupid to adverttize something that isn't
truely in the product.  To each his own, I guess.   


I'll be putting my own semi-release together for some pretty specialized
software that I am writing. I would never consider saying in PRINT that I had
something in my distribution that wasn't there. 

Actually, rather than do my own semi-release, I'll probably just have them
grab Slackware.

A user in waffle would become userid 'bbs' in the shell, unless
a 'wrapper' (setname, in this case) were used.  While what you 
suggest is not trivial, is it not impossible.  For some, waffle
has the disadvantage of being commercial (for UNIX), at a cost
of $120 for the source.  I think for the original poster's question,
waffle is not a viable alternative, in spite of its other features.

I had posted the following post yesterday and Malcolm Beattie
<mbeattie@black.ox.ac.uk> suggested that I add my local network to the
/etc/networks file, which I did, but as soon as I do that 

-- networks file ---
local-net       128.193.76.0
====== end ====
 route add local-net

 starts givnig me the SCIOADDRT: Network unreachable error, and as soon as I
 take it out, I am able to add my local net to teh rouing table, but the
 flags are UH, which means it comes up as a host rather than a network.

 Any ideas..  My previous post an relevant info is appended below.  Would
 really appreciate any help.

===== previous post =====
I would really appreciate any help with solving this problem.  As you might
guess, I am a neophyte as far as Linux is concerned.  I recently picked up
the distribution of linux from ftp.cdrom.com:pub/linux/slackware/zooed_disks
and installed it on a generic 486 / 66 with two 1/2 GB SCSI drives, 1542 Adaptec
SCSI card and a NE2000 network card (I/O addr = 300, Int =3).  The
installation went rather smoothly, but when I issue the following command
to add a gateway to the routing table..

  route add default gw 128.193.76.20 metric 1

I get the following error..

  SIOCADDRT: Network unreachable.

For the life of me, I can't figure out what it means and how I can get rid
of it.  My machines IP address is 128.193.76.16, so it is on the same
network as the gateway machine.  I can also ping the Linux box from 
any machine on the same network, but not from across the gateway.  The local
loopback is setup ok, and I can telnet to itself. I am attaching below the
output from "ifconfig" and "route" and the rc.inet1 file.  Would really 
appreciate any help. 

If not a problem, please respond to my e-mail address since I am an

As the originator of the post, it's time to give the answers to my query.  We
can stop discussing this one and save bandwidth.

--

1.  Is it possible to 'port Linux to lower architechtures? (i.e. 8088, '286..)

Sure, but it wouldn't be a very good 'port.  Linux was built to take advantage
of the '386 architechture, and reworking the kernel of Linux to do less just
so that it'd run on older 16-bit machines wouldn't do justice to the os.  The
final product would not be Linux -- just a pale imitation.

IMHO, if anyone really wants to use UN*X on these dudes, it might be better to
go with an established UN*X like Minix (the most mentioned UN*X in the email
replies).  But 'porting Linux is not the move to make.


2.  What can I do with my old '286 and 8088 if I'm not going to try to 'port
Linux?

There were two suggestions, as a whole:

 - Use them as X terminals.  I like this idea, as it keeps them productive. 
(They both have vga.)

 - Sell 'em cheap.  If they don't work, sell 'em cheaper.  What I can't sell,
I'll give away.  ;-)

--

PS.  A few people accused me of not having read the FAQ before I posted.  I
did, but mine was NOT the irritating question answered again and again.  (Did
you read the first two lines of my post?)  Mine was a question on 'PORTING
Linux to an 8088, '286.., not RUNNING existing Linux on an 8088, '286..
