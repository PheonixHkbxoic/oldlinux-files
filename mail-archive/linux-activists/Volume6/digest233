Date: Wed, 15 Sep 1993 22:09:34 GMT

I have a 386/387 machine that should run Linux perfectly, but before I get it, I need to know if it will work with my video card.

I have a Hercules Graphics Station 1024. It has a generic (Intel) VGA
chipset so I know I can run X on it no problem, but I only really
want Linux if I can use the -TIGA 34010- part of this card at
1024x768x256ni. Does anyone know if a driver is available for the
HGS, or even if there is a generic TIGA driver? I could probably
hack HGS support into it if I had the source.

EMail useful replies to me at twrathbo@undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca
or the above address and I will attempt to summarize.

 Hi.
 I am working (and have nearly finished) a BBS provisionally called 
PoluxBBS. It is a much improved version of LazyBBS by someone else 
(can't remember who). I'll upload from details when I have a 
complete BBS running. (Currently all it lacks is the ability for a 
user to delete mail To or From her - and maybe the odd setup 
utility).
 
 It will be ready RSN :)

    Somehow you've missed the part of the instructions where it says
that linux needs a filesystem to install on. While linux can read a DOS
filesystem fine, it's not possible to install and run linux on one.
    Try to get and read the new Linux Installation Guide, available at
all popular linux archive sites.

I am installing the SLS 1.03 distributiuon on an NFS drive.  I get get on the
drive and mount it and access the druve.

The problem is while the install script is running, it cannot change owner of
any of the files (it says Operation not permitted) and as a result I don't
think the installation is going properly.

Anyone have any suggestions?

It should.  You may want to write to the author.  The ftape is still
experimental.  I have used it and it works great, however it doesn't mark bad

Well there is a Modula-2 to C convert available. It worked reasonably
well for me but I was not doing any serious work on it. I was using it
for assignments for a course I was doing.

Anyway look for mtcbin.tar.z and mtcsrc.tar.z on tsx-11.

When I save workspace under openwindows it never restores it when I

but it's just not being run.  Is there supposed to be a rc file

I have a Gateway 2000 486 which has two IDE controllers built-in
to the motherboard.  I have hooked up 3 drives to it and it
works well under DOS and OS/2.  But under Linux, I don't know
how to access the thrid drive.  All I see under /dev is
/dev/hda* and /dev/hdb*.  How can I get to /dev/hdc* ?
Can I mknod them?  

One other question, is there any way to change the permission on
the dos file partition so that everybody can read and write to them?
I have, for example, /hda3 mounted as /dosc.  I cannot 
"chmod 777 /dosc" so that all users can read and write to it.  Any
suggestion?

Thanks for the help.

Subject: [Q] Gateway2000 4DX2 66V and Panasonic printers
Date: Thu, 16 Sep 1993 01:48:30 GMT



Hi there,

Ever since I met "Linux" I am considering buying a PC. The model I am 
planning to buy is

        Gateway 2000 4DX2-66V

I know that this model is in the Hardware compatibility list but I
would like to hear from people using this PC. More specificaly I have
the following question:

        - Will Linux run "out of the box" or will I have to
          recompile the kernel in order to use the cd-rom ?
          If so which driver will I need?

        - Is the "ATI Ultra XLR VL-bus 1MB VRAM" card compatable
          with X or do I have to "downgrade" to "ATI Ultra Pro VL"

        - How noisy is the computer (Baby AT? Tower ?)

        - What do you think of the computer...


Also, I plan to buy a printer... Gateway2000 sells  Panasonic KX-P1624/
P-2123  I have no idea of what the capabilities of those printers are.
Any info? Advice?

So as not to waste bandwidth, email me your answers, flames, ... If you
want to know the answers, ask me and I'll forward you any answer I get.

Thanks,

                Francois

"Octave" is a matlab clone.  I _think_ it has been ported to Linux.
Look in the standard places, (tsx-11, sunsite) or ask archie.

Subject: NOT JUST ANOTHER LINUX + 386BSD CD-ROM
Date: 16 Sep 1993 03:19:19 GMT

=====================================================================

        NOT JUST ANOTHER LINUX + 386BSD CD-ROM.

Trans-Ameritech presents LINUX SLS/Slackware AND 386BSD and MULTYMEDIA CD-ROM.

A new Linux CD-ROM is available! But not just Linux. Also 386BSD and more.
Here is a brief summary of why we think this CD-ROM is the best.
As the price of only $30 puts it in the same price category as the JANA 
product, I'll base my comparison on it.


We provide 2 versions of SLS distribution - a very stable 1.02 and the new 1.03
and also the SLACKWARE distribution! Linux installs directly from the CD-ROM
on almost any hardware configuration.

1. The Trans-Ameritech Linux CD-ROM is not just a mirror of some ftp site. 
In addition to the full SLS distributions we supply a "live" image of a 
configured system. This is great if you don't want files that are not used 
very often to garble your hard disk. One example is manpages - use them 
directly from the CD-ROM. Same applies to emacs lisp files, info files etc.
How many fonts do you need? Have them all! Space is no problem.

2. Uncompressed sources are available for instant reference.

3. Several versions of the Linux kernel are provided precompiled to cover 
different hardware options including drivers for Sony-31A and Sound Blaster 
CD-ROMs.

4. Patches to support sound cards are included. Take this compiled kernel IF 
YOU WANT. If not - use a small kernel with no unused ballast.

5. Install Linux directly from the Sony-31A or Sound Blaster CD-ROM drive as
well as standart SCSI and Mitsumi types.

6. We are running Linux on several PCs to make sure that our configurations
really work. We don't wait for official SLS release for certain extra drivers
and utilities. If they work here, we include it as an option on the CDROM.

7. For your convenience a full recent distribution of 386BSD *NIX is provided
on the same CD-ROM.

8. Some space is dedicated to what takes too much room on hard disks - 
sounds and pictures. They are usable with the Linux sound/gif tools and under 
MS-DOS too!

9. A few choice MS-DOS applications are included in the assumption that the
majority of Linux users run DOS occasionaly. Or use it from dos-emu!
Most of the MS-DOS stuff comes from the SIMTEL20 archive. Naturally only part 
of it made it to the first CDROM. However the new releases will include other 
files from SIMTEL20, GARBO etc. So if you subsribe to the Trans-Ameritech 
Linux+ CDROM, you will not only get updated Linux, but over a year you will get
the full SIMTEL20 collection as an extra bonus.

10. Trans-Ameritech is a well established company with efficient organization
to guarantee on-time printing and shipping of this product. There will be a
significant discount if you subscribe for future releases.

But the best part is that YOU will decide what to put on the next edition!
We'll count votes and provide most popular software on the next one.

Credit card orders are wellcome. Call Trans-Ameritech at (408) 727- 3883.
