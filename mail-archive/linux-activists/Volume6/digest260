Reply-To: pings@ee.ubc.ca

Hi guys. Since I posted my problem with term-1.07 a couple of weeks ago, I 
still haven't got the right answer. Now I can't run X windows remotely. :-(
This is unbearable. So I have to ask you again. The problem is as follows:

When I was using the previous SLS package, I run term-1.05 on both local
and remote machines. I started kermit first and connected to the remote
machine and then broke back to the local machine and did
Kermit>!term <> /dev/ttyS1 &
Kermit>!trsh
Then I got back to the remote machine and could start X window programs
there.

But now with the SLS-1.03 and term-1.07 installed, the above procedure 
did not work. After trsh, all I get is
Connect: Invalid argument
and the connection to the remote machine is broken.

Anyone knows what might be the problem? Both my local and remote machine
have installed term-1.07, so there isn't any imcompatability problem. Is
it the term-1.07, the SLS-1.03, or the kermit? Please help. 

Another problem after I installed SLS-1.03 is when I use mdir, I get
mdir: Cannot initialize 'A:'
What is the problem?

   Yes. It is another BETTER package.  Slackware's maintainer is much more
   responsive to updates and general support than the SLS people are.

Subject: Can't umount!

  Has anyone been unable to umount partitions after compiling
with GCC in it?
  I encountered this, on my SLS 1.03 system.  I could umount
and mount /usr/local, no problem.  But after I compiled anything
in the directory with GCC, umount would refuse to unmount 
/usr/local with the "Device Busy" error message.  I don't
have any programs running out of /usr/local, the only shell
(me, logged in as root) is not in /usr/local, so I can't understand
why the device is busy!  This is a completely vanilla SLS 1.03
installation - nothing has been changed yet.  I thought of using
fuser to find any open files, but it appears that fuser is not 
available.  Does anyone have _any_ ideas (other than switch to
MCC (which I'm seriously considering)) ?  Is there a way to
look at Linux's FCB (open file list)?

  Please help - I dont want to shutdown my system - This has
happen before, same installation, and last time it ate
/usr/local and /usr, and I had to reinstall.

I can confirm that with only an Ultrastor 34F in the machine,
with the mailbox i/o port set to 340h, factory default IRQ and
other settings, the new Slackware boot/install disk works just
fine.

Unless I'm much mistaken I noticed a package in the X disks of Slackware
which was described as a word-processor that writes TeX output, so you
might want to look into that. I didn't install it, but I seem to remember
it was called `doc1'.

Has anyone actually used this?

Subject: Getting a SCSI CD-ROM working
Date: 25 Sep 1993 00:01:13 GMT

I have an Always IN2000 card and a TEXEL-3024 SCSI cd-rom drive hooked up
on my system.  Last weekend I had the above plus a bernoulli removable 150meg
drive working with linux (which was easier than I expected) so I know the
SCSI card is ok.

BUT

I can't get my cd-rom drive to work.  Does it need to be a certain logical
SCSI id?  I know the bernoulli wouldn't work until I had it setup as id 0.
I can't mount the rom drive no matter what I try.  Is there a -t parameter
for rom drives?

i.e. mount -t ???? /dev/scd0 /cdrom  <-- this directory DOES exist

I have rebuilt my kernel several times with no problems.  I have included
SCSI cd-rom, the IN2000 and the IS09660 support.  Do I need to have the
Mitsumi or the CDU31A?

I'm sure I'm doing something stupid.  
Any help would be appreciated.

Date: Fri, 24 Sep 1993 07:00:31 GMT

Hi

I'm running SLS Linux 1.03 and X3 ( X server for S3 chipset) on an IBM VP 
386 33DX/3 and am trying to get term up and running, but every time I connect
it "hangs" after I type 4 characters... My procedure is the following:

Dial up remote system via KERMIT
log on to remote machine
run "term" remotely
escape back to local prompt
suspend kermit 
run "term < /dev/cua0 > /dev/cua0"
go to another shell window and run "trsh"

At this point, it connects remotely ( a Sun 4 ) and seems ok.  I type "ls" and
return at which point the remote directories are listed.  Fine.  I try "ls" 
but only the "l" is displayed and the window seemingly freezes!

If I kill the "trsh" process, start kermit again, connect, and fire off "000000"
the remote "term" ends and I'm back at the remote prompt.

I've run linecheck and test and all is "seemingly" well...
Has anyone had this problem?  Am I missing something here?
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Maybe someone can explain whats going on here:

I havethe SLS boot-image file a1.5.  Its 1,228,928 bytes large.  My 
problem happens when I rawrite it to a high density floppy (5-1/4").  It 
seems to work fne until it gets to track 80.  At this point rawrite stops 
and says: 'address not found.'  

I suspect its because the file is too big for the disk.  Why would they 
write a boot-image too big for a floppy?  Any responses are welcome.

In spite of what the self-appointed net guardians of GPL purity may
have told you, your disk-rental idea is a fine one, and well within
the spirit of the GPL.

You cannot sell GPL'ed software.  However, you _can_ sell the service
of copying it, and you can sell the media on which it is carried.  For
these things, you can charge whatever the market will bear.  Linus
himself has hinted that if he heard that someone willingly paid a huge
sum for a copy of Linux, he would be pleased and flattered.

In your case, you would be just renting out the _media_ on which the
software is carried.  The GPL'ed _software_ belongs to its author, but
the _media_ (the physical objects on which the software is recorded)
belong to you, and there's nothing wrong with renting them out.

What you don't have the right to do is:

 - restrict further copying, or
 - distribute the software without either 
    -- the source code, or
    -- an offer to distribute the source code, or
    -- whatever information you have received about availability
       of the source code.

Don't believe the self-righteous GPL censors.  The GPL is designed to
promote the distribution of software by permitting people to copy
and distribute it, either for profit or not.

Subject: Linux 0.99pl9 (SLS 1.01) and 3Com EtherLink 16?  Any hope?
Date: Sat, 25 Sep 1993 00:16:59 GMT


Hello, Linuxers!!

I just purchased a new Ethernet card for my 386DX/40 clone.  It is a
3Com EtherLink 16, a 16-bit ISA Ethernet card with both an AUI port
and a BNC connector.

I'm running Linux 0.99pl9, as distributed with SLS 1.01, and would like
to get Linux running using this card, so that I can start building my
dream of a home Ethernet network.  I would like to use the BNC connector,
since I've got other devices that use ThinNet cabling.  However, I do have
a transceiver that plugs into the AUI port, so I can use that if needed.

A few questions:

(1) Is there a driver for this card, for Linux 0.99pl9?  If so,
    (A) Where can I get it? (FTP site)
    (B) How do I install it? (if it's not obviously documented in README)

(2) If there isn't a driver for 0.99pl9, is there a driver for 0.99pl10 or
    any of the other newer versions of Linux?
    (A) If so, where can I get it?
    (B) How do I install it? (if it's not obviously documented in README)

(3) If there isn't ANY driver for this card...
    (A) Is this card sufficiently compatible/similar with another type of
        network card, that I can use the driver for that other card?
    (B) Where can I get it, and how do I install it?
    (C) If no drivers that exist will work, is there any hope of MAKING a
        driver for this card? (i.e. are the spec's available, or is it a
        case like with Diamond video boards, where they won't release the
        info necessary to program it)

Please respond to me here at dburr@sbanet.netmail.com.  THANK YOU!!

Date: 25 Sep 1993 04:38:09 GMT


I've just recently read about the new IBM company called AMBRA.  They
are manufacturing some new machines based on an IBM manufactured Intel
processor called the 486 Blue Lighting.  I believe they also produce a
machine with a model number D466E/VL with is an Intel 486DX2 66
EISA/VESA LB system.

Now the my question -- Does any one know or have tried to get NetBSD,
FreeBSD, or Linux running on this machine?  I am interested in two of
their models they are the D466BL/CD and the D466E/VL machines.  The
first is a 5 slot ISA system with 2 VESA LB slots and built in SCSI
and 10BaseT ethnet. The second model is 7 slot EISA/2 VESA LB and a S3
video accelerator.  There was no mention of a SCSI controller or of
ethernet.

I know these are new machines so there is probably not a good chance someone
has tested this configuration yet, but I thought I would ask anyways.

What about AIX?  Does IBM have a Intel port?

Lighten up, guy! In the posts I have seen (and one by me), no one has 
acted as a "self-righteous GPL censor". We simply saw a case where we 
thought a GPL infringement **might** occur, warned the original poster 
of this possibility, and asked experts on the GPL to comment. No one
tried to censor anything. We just wanted to maybe help a science club
avoid a rather sticky situation later. And I for one am glad this can be
resolved before they got started...it would have certainly caused a
few minutes of sleeplessness if they had been accused of (accidentally)
participating in an illegal activity after they had distributed several
copies (whether the accusations have grounds or not).

And by the way, I have no reason believe your interpretation of the 
"spirit" of the GPL is the correct one, based on information given in 
your post. Are you a member of the FSF? Or an attorney who specializes in 
software? Also, does the intended spirit of a legal document mean diddly
anyway? I'm pretty sure (in the US anyway) that what is actually written 
down is all that counts. Otherwise, how could people always find, and act 
on, loopholes. 

I would still like to hear comments on this issue from someone who has 
something in his by-line that convinces me his interpretation is valid. 

Flames will be read, considered, and answered if the flamer requests a
response.
