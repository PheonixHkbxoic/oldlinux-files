Look at /etc/login.defs - there is a string wich looks like

CONSOLE tty1:tty2:tty3....ttyp1:ttyp2

You must add ttyS0 (or any other line wich you wish use as root) to this string.

Just a hunch, but you might want to try:

find / -name umount -print

:^)

I ran into the same thing caused by a duplicate umount. Otherwise, just
make sure you've rdev'ed your kernel properly. It took me a couple hours
to get bootutils going... it was one of those packages where just when I
was nearly ready to give up on it, it began working perfectly for no
apparent reason.

You're using the system V style "init", aren't you? That could also be a
factor. I think v. 2.4 is the latest.

(I have a nagging feeling, that this is a faq, but I haven't been able to
find it. Sorry).

My filesystems have been mounted during a hard-reset and now mount com-
plains about "mounting an unchecked filesystem" whenever I mount them.
e2fsck -r *has* already repaired the fs-es, but apparently there's
something missing.  I have a feeling that all I have to do is switch some
kind of "unchecked" -bit in the super-block, but how do I do that ?

I have the same problems on 3 machines (2*486 and 1*386) when I 
tried to boot from the original 3,5" bootdisk in driva A. The 
loading stops after the message "Detecting soundcard: AdLib

   Actually, he said two things:  1)  You can't run it on Intel platforms.
2)  You can run it on Intel, but only on a loaded machine.  As a
programmer, I dislike inconsistency in specifications. :-)

   Seriously though, at this very second I'm running a 486-66 that is fully
capable of running NextStep, and I paid under $2000.00 for it.  That's very
inexpensive for what you get out of the software.  Of course, I don't
choose to run it, for other reasons, but that's irrelevent. :-)

I have been looking for a UNIX system that not only supports TCP/IP
but also can connect to a Netware server.  (Netware 4.01)

SCO and USL offer such packages but cost too much.  NOVELL sells
an NFS system for $3000.00  which is more than the UNIX software
that can do both.  

I was just checking to see if someone in LINUX land has taken the

When I use the 'shutdown' that came with SLS 1.0? (Kernel pl12),
everything gets properly unmounted, even without booutils. Did you
realize, that the bootutils umount, can only remount your root fs as
readonly? 
Then to get everything starting, you have to e2fsck -r every Partition
and config lilo, to mount the root fs readonly.

I had a similar problem upgrading from 4 to 20 MB.  Compiling a kernel took
50 minutes instead of the usual 5 minutes.  The solution was in the
bios-setup.  The machine only cached the first 4 MB in the on-chip caches,
leaving 16 MB uncached, and therefore much slower.  Check your bios-setup.

The only problem I see with that is it defeats the purpose of the BBS.

If a person chooses to run a BBS for UNIX, it's usually because they don't
want the people to get a shell, and also for ease of use.  Many people are
accustomed to a 'BBS' type interface, and not to a UNIX shell.

A BBS allows the SysAdmin to give people an easy interface where they don't
have to be bothered with accounts, and other functions.

I think it's very odd that all sorts of people are using the same 
distribution, but problems seem to be unique.  wierd. (This isn't a 
cut on you Mark, just an observation.)  Anyway...

If you do man passwd I'm sure all your problems will be answered.  My
guess is when the accounts are being created, they are being set so that
the user can't change the password.  It is an option on passwd.  The manual
page should be able to help.

You know, I think that Linux should be ported to my refrigerator.  I
mean, it already has many built in features similar to Unix and I
think that these facts should make a port simple.

  o  Hierarchical structure, i.e. old stuff goes in back, I even have
     to defragment it whenever something starts to smell

  o  Electrical wiring (maybe in the future even this won't be needed!)

  o  Multi-user interface (I can use the freezer and someone else can
     access the rest without any device conflicts)

  o  I heard a rumour that a beta version already exists for toasters
     so surely someone must be working on a refrigerator version.

  o  It even has built-in power management (I heard the bulb
     turns off whenever I shut the door) that is only just staring to
     be used in typical personal computers.

And most important, almost everyone has a refrigerator lying around
that I believe needs to be running Linux to bring them up to par with
... well, my 386.  Doesn't this make you mad! - why should Unix be
restricted to people with computers?

If anyone knows where I can find someone else wanting to port Linux to
refrigerators, please mail me so we can start work right away!

========================================================================

Back to reality.

This "port Linux to everything thing phenomenon" is rather silly.  Why
on Earth would you want to port it to anything nobody uses anymore?  I
don't want to know how slow any Unix would run on my Commodore 128
(yes I still have a working one).  I know that we aren't all made of
gold, but 386's are dirt cheap these days.

Ian, if you are reading this, please add a "No, Linux is not being
ported to your refrigerator" to the daily-posting, if it isn't already
there.

Well, I got SLS 1.01, and I have since gone from .99pl9-6 all the way to
.99pl12 without obtaining all of the support files.  Like I said, if I use
shutdown now and go single user and type umount -a, it works.  If I just use
shutdown -r now it doesnt unmount root.

Does anyone know where I can get the source to shutdown?

The hardware floating point of a 486 (or 386/387 combo) makes a world of 
difference for floating point apps, though...  The only heavy fp app I use
is ghostscript, and it's pretty much useless on a 386 without a 387.

Yes, but what kind of security does your refrigerator have?  Has it
been through NSA's certification??  I'm all for the port, but a bit worried
about unauthorized users...

Hey, don't laugh... it took me a couple of days to port linux to my
TRS-80.  I'll be uploading it to sunsite in a couple of days
(sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/TRS-80/*).

In principle, I like the idea of free Unix running on any hardware capable
of supporting it.

The original questioner asked about the Atari ST/TT/Falcon line, not about
a Commodore 128 (or a refrigerator). The ST -- which has a 68000 and no
MMU -- is out of the question, but the TT030 and Falcon aren't. In terms
of CPU horsepower, they're comparable to the '386. 

But you're right to question whether it's worth the effort. The TT030 is
no longer in production, as far as I know, and Atari didn't sell very many
of them in the first place. The Falcon is nice -- 68030, Motorola DSP chip
and all that -- but Atari stupidly made it a 16-mHz machine instead of a
32-mHz machine and priced it above the current retail for a '486 box. Not
surprisingly, it isn't selling well. 

So the best advice for any Atari users who are interested in Linux is to
pick up a cheap used '386 box, stuff it full of memory, and hack away. Use
your Atari as a VT100 if you like, or just keep it around for running DTP
or Midi stuff.

Or, if you really must stick to the Atari, you can run Minix or fake it
with MiNT and a Unix shell.
