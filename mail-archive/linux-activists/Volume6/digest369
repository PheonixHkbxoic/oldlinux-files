Hi !

We have a PC 486-50 with linux Slackware distribution
so that we have a 3c503 ethernet card. 

Our network is the 137.204.72.0  the card configuration is that

ifconfig eth0 137.204.72.49
ifconfig broadcast 137.204.72.255
ifconfig netmask 255.255.255.0

when we try to connect to another machine the error is: 
The network is Unreachable write return = -1


Thanks in advance .

OpenVMS is for Alphas, not for VAXen.

Subject: SCSI woes again
Date: 10 Nov 1993 15:16:15 -0500

 This was posted earlier, but our mail connection died shortly afterwards, so
I not sure it went out... And I didn't get any responses.

 I am attempting to install Linux on my 486-66 Unisys that has an Adaptec SCSI
controller built onto the motherboard. Unfortunately, the boot disk does not
recognize this controller. I would like to get hold of code, if possible, to
recompile the scsi drivers to recognize my controller. But it seems a bit of a
catch-22 that I must have Linux installed in order to do this. Perhaps I am
wrong, but I had not been able to find appropriate code. Also, I wouldn't have
the first clue about how to create a bootable disk.
 Secondly, I cannot reach "sunsite" to send e-mail! Wrong backbone, apparently
we're restricted.

        There has been some posting reciently about a vendor being inter-

        and was requesting a responce to guage the marketability of this.
        If you have an interest in this you should respond to the survey.
        The only problem is that I am not sure which of the linux newsgroups

Hi,

A friend of mine who does not have access to Usenet is looking for sources
in C for compressing and archiving programs, something like arj or zip.
He would like to use them to write a compressing program in Unix.


Any suggestions?

Please reply directly to me since I do not read this group.

Yet more XFree86 2.0 fun!

So I fianlly compiled the pl13 kernel, and hopefully would be able to
run the SVGA server. No dice.

The Mono server works great, and would destroy this DEDCstation 3100 I'm
writing this on now, but I feel the need for color!

I have a Gateway2000 486DX33v, a Rocket (Western Digital) card, 8 megs RAM,
8 more swap partition, plenty of disk space, etc...

When I startx, (after I link the correct server, and reconfig appropriately),
I get thin vertical lines on my screen, then they get closer together, and
then the screen turns green (This may be from  my .twmrc, as I use the same
one I use on a DECsattion, where all my stuff is green (by choice!)), and
sits there.  When I move my mouse, the screen sometimes changes to a brighter
green. I think this is from my active border color in .twmrc, because I can
type ^D to exit my unseeable login xterm window, and I can't when the screen
is not that color...

Anyone have suggestions?

i trust this isn't a FAQ, but i can't seem to find an answer to this ...

my inittab contains the line:

        c9:56:respawn:/etc/uugetty 38400 ttyS1

when init reads inittab and runs the commands contained there, it invokes
_2_ copies if uugetty - or more to the point, it looks as tho' the first
uugetty spawns another version of itself. why whould this be, and how do
i correct it?

thanks.

One comment is that 50 MHz is too fast for VLB, if you care about 
such things.  Anyway it seems as though the DX2-66 is the better
bet.  Here is an old item off the bsdi-users mailing list.

Enjoy.

We have tested here if one Linux node could serve some e-mail, news + gopher 
users. We did test with 10 users using pine. The PC is 386 20 MHz + 8M ram
+ 100 M disk. The memory is too small for 10 users. 

It did work quite well! The load was not real I think it was hevier
than real 10 user load. The "load average" (top) was at 6 at some moments but 
the Linux PC did respond better than I did expect.

Hello

I just installed the OS/2-Bootmanager and added the Linux-Root-Partition to the
Boot-Menu. Then I ran LILO which I've told to boot from the Root-Partition.
That's an easy way to boot Linux and OS/2.

Hey folks, The original poster was asking about the new 486 part, not 386.
I've read one report of a person upgrading from a 386-20 to a 486DX-40 and
having problems, but it hasn't necessarily been pinned down to the MB.
All other reports I've read indicate that the AMD 486DX40 runs fine with
Linux. In fact I've seen postings in the ibm hardware newsgroups about
cranking it up to 50 Mhz with no heat sink with no problem.
