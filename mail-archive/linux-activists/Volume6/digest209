It seems that SLS has for some reason distributed a testing only version of
the libc library (I think because of some networking problems with 4.4.1).
libc.so.4.4.2 is NOT a public release. The messages you are getting is
because your stubs (.sa files) and DLL's (.so files) do not match version
numbers.

You can tell what the stub version number by doing the following:

        % nm /usr/lib/libc.sa | grep "[DU] ___libc"

this should give you multiple lines something like 

         U ___libc_4_402
         U ___libc_4_402
         U ___libc_4_402

This means your stub is version 4.4.2.

Now look in your /lib directory and see what your libc.so.4 file is linked
to. It is more likely than not linked to a DLL library version lower than
the stub library .sa - hence the warning mesage when a you compile
something.

The idea is to make sure both these versions numbers are the same so what
you compile gets dynamically linked to the correct version of the DLL at
run-time. In other words you probably need the new libc.so.4.4.2.

Please read the GCC-FAQ on sunsite.unc.edu /pub/Linux/docs/faqs for more
information.

        I took care to say the 0.9 SCSI driver would put ISA/EISA based

Hello,

Just tried to compile Linux PL12 this weekend. I have MCC 0.99pl10+
installed, (can't recall ver. of GCC and G++ though). I know that 
gcc 2.4.5 is recommended but everything seemed to compile fine. The
system now boots and when I try to change TTY (ie. ALT-F2, etc.) the
system crash with a swap partition error. Is my compiler the problem
or have I missed on something? Also the ';' key does not seem to
be working do I need to run a keyboard map?

Thanks,

I've been using Linux on a system with IDE harddisk for 15 months.  Now
I'm planning to get a new SCSI harddisk for running Linux (0.99.12).
Could anyone tell me if I'll encounter any problem with the combination
of following hardware?

Adaptec 1542C SCSI host adapter
Quantum PD1225S 1.2G harddisk

I'm especially interested in knowing if Linux can access any disk space
over 1000M.  I ask this because LINUX HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY LIST (Aug, 93)
states that it can't for ST41650 1400M harddisk.

Please email to me or reply to this newsgroup as my site doesn't have
those new comp.os.linux.* groups yet. :-(

This is likely due to you not upgrading your keymaps.  The pl12 kernel introduced
new keymaps that were more flexible than the old ones.  The big drawback is that
the new kernel panics when it runs into your old keymaps.  If you are using a
US keyboard the solution is very simple - delete /etc/kbmap - this will a) stop
the kernel from seeing the old keymaps :) and b) force the kernel to use its
default - the US keymap.  If you are using a different keyboard, boot up with an
older kernal, upgrade the keymaps and reboot with pl12.

This is because the file system must be umounted (or mounted read only ) when
running e2fsck in order for the clean bit to be set.

The main problem I have with the Amiga version right now is that it requires
a match coproceser and anMU with all the instructions.  This means that an
030 is needed, or an 020 with a lot of extra chips, and that the 040 can't
be used until the memory management has been rewritten (both a memory
management rewrite and a software math coprocesser are reportedly works in
progress, to be fair).

The screen/console differences are really another good argument for a
hardware abstraction layer for the video, keyboard, and mouse I/O; it would
be best if an X server for *BSD only needed a recompile for each processer
type, and a 680x0 binary should run unchanged on MACs, Amigas, etc.

The difference between shared and dynamic libraries boils down to when the
offset table is filled out.  While load tends to be faster with dynamic,
you do take run-time hits for initial reference of routines with dynamic
binding; I consider this a loss (it *is* a performance hit that should be
taken at link time, not runtime -- an application is typically linked
once and run many times).  Also, depending on implementation, you end up
either losing shared text for each fixup (if it is done wrong) or losing
shared text for the GOT for the jump-through and reference-through tables
which could otherwise be marked as shared pages after initial fixup (thus
increasing the per-instance cost of programs like xterm, etc. -- the size
of the GOT can be significant for libX + libXt + libc + ...).

All in all, I'll probably be buying an Amiga to run BSD some time in the
near future, but it won't be tomorrow.

This has nothing to do with your compiling the kernel.  This has to do with
the pl12 kernel using different keymaps (man this should be in the faq).  If you
are using a US keyboard, the solution is simple - delete /etc/kbmap.  This will
force the kernel to use its default keymapping - the US keymap.  If you
are not using a US keyboard, boot with an older kernel, grab the keymap kit
(to be found in the same directory you grabbed the pl12 source in) and install
the new keymap for your keyboard.  Then reboot with your new kernel.

Have fun.

If the main issue is cost, the Waffle is definitely out.  If not, then it's
a good bet insofar as 1) it's easy to port, 2) it has loads of features
(access to news, shell access for priviledged users, lots more), 3) it's
highly configurable (without programming experience).  On the other hand,
if you want a Unix bbs with shell access for certain users, you could
also just use XBBS and install vi as the default editor.  Instant shell
access!  Or, if you like the format of the Searchlight BBS, you could
get the code for PBBS (Pirate's BBS - what the Mars Hotel used to run)
from erc.msstate.edu and port it.  PBBS was written for the Sun 4/110
running Solaris but it has also been ported to Oracle or some other strange
Unix OS for Vaxen (BSD variant).  If you're not into porting, but like
the PBBS format, you might also as Ed Luke if he'd do the port.  I'm 
sure he won't mind :-).

Bzzzt!  Misinterpretation.  I was one of many people who wrote in suggesting
they be used as _terminals_.  However, if there is a good 286 VGA X terminal
program available, I don't know about it (and it would probably be expensive
