I really really want to automate the whole process of starting up slip.  If
anyone could please send me ANY scripts they are using with DIP I would
appreciate it.

Thanks so much,

I finally got SLIP working with DIP and now I'm running into a whole set
or new problems.  

***** Datagram fragmentation not yet supported *****

I looked in the man pages for ifconfig and it says to crank up the mtu
parameter to around 4096.

So I type:

>ifconfig sl0 up mtu 4096

and then I do another ifconfig sl0.  The mtu parameter has changed to 4096
but I still get the same error message.  (now getting upset)
I type:

>ifconfig sl0 up mtu 32768

and I still get the same error message!  (dooooh)

Does anyone know if there has been a new distribution of DIP that accepts
datagram frag?  Or maybe I'm looking at the wrong parameters.

Well, you didn't quite... :-)

  The driver talks to the SCSI controller. The SCSI controller talks to
  a card that speaks SCSI on one end and QIC36 on the other. Result:
  Your drive drives...

  The next possibility: The driver talks to a controller that looks like
  a QIC02 interface. QIC02 is a bit more intelligent then QIC36. It
  defines things like certain commands and a protocoll. This controller
  has a QIC36 connector that you connect your drive to. Voila, your dive
  drives!

No. Let's be clear about this: QIC-02 and QIC-36 are standards for the
IO (ISA/EISA/MCA are *system* buses; SCSI is an IO bus; IDE arguably is
an IO bus specification that is almost identical to the ISA system bus
specification) *bus* between the host controller in your PC and the
device controller bolted on the tape drive. With QIC-36 the host
controller is more sophisticated than the drive controller; with QIC-02
the latter is more sophisticated.

Neither QIC-02 nor QIC-36 have *any* relationship whatsoever to the
programmatic interface between the driver in Linux and the host
controller, to the hw interface between the motherboard and the host
controller, or (just to be complete) the format in which data are
recorded on the tape.

Now, what really matters to the Linux driver is the programmatic
interface (which IO ports the host controller uses, which commands, and
so on).

There are several different programmatic interfaces, but *most* host
controllers that communicate with tape drives over a QIC-02 or QIC-36
bus have either the Wangtek/Everex interface or the Archive interface,
which are BTW rather similar to each other. The Linux QIC-02 (a
misnomer) driver supports _both_, irrespective of whether the host
controller actually drives a QIC-02 or QIC-36 bus. In particular most
Wangtek/Everex host controllers have the same interface, whether they
support QIC-02 or QIC-36.

  As you can see, your "QIC36" card is really something that is QIC02 on
  one end and QIC36 on the other.

I think I never heard of a board that enables a QIC-36 tape drive to hang
off a QIC-02 bus, or viceversa; there are at least two that allow a QIC-02
or QIC-36 tape drive to hang off a SCSI bus, but they are rather ancient.

To end: the names of some Everex/Archive host controllers that have (nearly)
the same programmatic interface: 811/831, 409/499.

Huh.. take care Rob.. The A3000 does indeed have nice I/O performance,
but you won't exploit it with Amiga SVR4.. this one contains one of the
most dreadful implementations of a scsi driver I've seen on the amiga...

I did a quick iozone test on a 30M file (as was suggested in an
unrelated thread here):
bash# a.out 30 8192

        IOZONE: Performance Test of Sequential File I/O  --  V1.16 (10/28/92)
                By Bill Norcott

        Operating System: POSIX 1003.1-1988

        Send comments to:       norcott_bill@tandem.com

        IOZONE writes a 30 Megabyte sequential file consisting of
        3840 records which are each 8192 bytes in length.
        It then reads the file.  It prints the bytes-per-second
        rate at which the computer can read and write files.


Writing the 30 Megabyte file, 'iozone.tmp'...53.816667 seconds
Reading the file...29.700000 seconds

IOZONE performance measurements:
        584526 bytes/second for writing the file
        1059167 bytes/second for reading the file

This was on a totally "untuned" fs, I'll try and see if tunefs can
change the values significantly, I doubt it though. If I could hack
disksort() to not only sort blocks, but really merge them, that would
make for a whole lot more improvement (I could more or less double
performance when reading from the raw disk device just by doubling
block sizes...)

The screen/console code has been improved in the meantime, the console
part that runs on the native chip set (I'm myself using the Retina
console, which is based on the NCR 77C22E+ VGA chip) now uses the
Copper for scrolling, which should give it similar performance as the
Amiga SVR4 console, you don't really notice you're writing into a
bitmapped framebuffer.

As for dynamic libraries, there will be a NetBSD solution, not an 
Amiga solution.

For those interested into more details about the Amiga port, subscribe
to the netbsd-amiga mailing list, just write to 
netbsd-admin@cbmuucp.commodore.com (note that commodore just kindly
allowed to run the list on one of their machines, they're not involved
into NetBSD at all).

-Markus

BTW: binaries for NetBSD for the Amiga are available on ftp.eunet.ch,
software/os/bsd/NetBSD/NetBSD-Amiga, however, the current ones are
really old, if you can, either recompile yourself or wait a week
or so, I'll upload a new set by then.

This is exactly why I made my comment.  I've never been terribly fond
of the Amiga OS, but I would take a 68k processor box over the Intel
crap any day, if I could run the same software on each.

I truly think it would be worth picking up a used Amiga just to turn
into a unix (NetBSD) box.

Things like WORDPERFECT are available for UNIX, but not as far as I know
for LINUX.  And I'd be surprised if it *ever* is.  It is hard to get
around the fact that the "home type apps" available for PCs just aren't
available for Unix of any flavor.  For example, when was the last time
you saw something equivalent to "QUICKEN", or "XTALK/WIN" for any
Unix platform?

As much as I prefer working in the UNIX environment, I too am forced to
keep a DOS/win environment available.  As it is now, I have to boot
DOS or LINUX, depending on which things I need to do.  

Of course if LINUX can evenutally run WINDOWS apps, that will solve it
for me :-) :-)   At that point, WIN will go away :-)
(but of course when you work in the industry, it is good to stay in
touch with the "popular" things .... so it's still good to work with
Win (and NT) enough to stay famliar with them, etc, ... .but that's
a different issue.

Subject: Installing the New Linux
Date: 4 Sep 93 20:39:08 GMT

I'm having problems installing the newest version of Linux. First off, here
is my set-up:

        80386/SX 33 mhz
        4 megs of memory
        170 megs HD
        Drive a: is a 1.44 meg
        Trident SVGA 1Meg (8900C)

If I load the A1 disk into the ramdisk, I can't use the "install" login.
I'll login alright, but if I try to make a swap partition or the root 
partition, I run out of memory (some message like, "new couldn't allocate
memory - out of memory") or something like that. Also, if I go ahead and
do my OWN mke2fs'ing and fdisk'ing, I'm okay until I try to install the
system using doinstall. When I insert the A2 disk, it starts reading it
but then says it ran out of memory and skips onto the next file to install.
But, it isn't installing the files.

If I DON'T load the the floppy into the ramdisk, I can do the above, but
when it comes time to insert the next disk (e.g. A2), I can't have it
write protected and then garbage just flies all over my screen. I've ran
the previous version of Linux without a hitch. If I DON'T have the disk
write protected, Linux trashes it. 

Anyone have any ideas on this? I'd really like to get linux up and running,
but it looks like I'm out of luck at this time. I can't install the previous
version because I put the new version onto the old disks.

Reply-To: slb22@columbia.edu

Thanks to the many people who sent me helpful email.  Essentially, the
consensus was that my options were:

1.) Junk the UltraStor and get an Adaptec 1742.
2.) Get some friendly person with a working Linux installation to patch the
     kernel for me, then replace the zImage on the SLS A1 disk with the
     patched zImage and send me the disk image file.
3.) Sit on my duff and whine.

I have opted for a version of #2, namely, to take everything off my hard
drive and reformat it in IDE-emulation mode, then install Linux, patch the
kernel myself, reformat the drive in SCSI mode, and reinstall Linux.  I
hope to have it up and running in a week or so.... :-)
