Date: Thu, 7 Oct 1993 10:52:25 GMT

Help! - I have been trying to get my Mitsumi CD-ROM to work with Linux for a
long time. I started with the early SLS release but could not get any help 
from the supplier. I now have acces to the net (obviously) and had just 
downloaded the Slackware release 1.03 (kernel .99pl13). This says it has the
support built in for the Mitsumi CDROM but when I boot the message:

mitsumi init failed ... appears.

I have tried some different IRQ settings to no avail. 

Could somebody please send me the info I need to get this working?

Apart from the above Niggle I find Linux very interesting and useful.


Regards and thanks in advance - Shaun.,

Reply-To: tphillip@uk.oracle.com


Hi,

I've recently installed SLS on my system, it's great! Thanks to all the people
who've worked on it, and continue to do so!

As well as installing the basic version I've been collecting together the
latest versions of some utilities, the Kernel etc. from a number of ftp sites.

My problem is that disk space is severly limited on my PC!

According to the notes with the kernel I should use GCC 2.4.5 to compile my
kernel...

I've ftp'd the GCC 2.4.5 source code and transferred it on to the PC,
after uncompressing and untarring it I'm left with about 15 megs of disk space;
this isn't enough to do the job!!!

Aside from buying a new hard disk, which I can't afford for a couple of months
(but I'm painfully aware I need one!), is there a 'cut-down' version of GCC
2.4.5 just for linux/i386 platforms, or even better an executable that's
already been compiled? I`d need to get hold of it via a bitftp server as I
only have internet mail access.

One other question: I notice at the end of the acitivist digest which I get
that the current kernel version is up to patch level 19, I've only managed to
find up to pl12; where are the best places to find the latest versions?

Any suggestions are welcome

thanks

I tried to install the linux filesystem by typing the
following line:

this produced the following output:

  mke2fs 0.3,  93/04/22 for EXT2 FS 0.3a

  1888 inodes per group
  group = 11
  mke2fs: Unable to find a block for the inode table

The last two lines appeared some time after the other 
lines.

After these lines linux returned to the prompt.

What has gone wrong?

Try updating your kernel to 0.99.13, which fixes at least one memory
management bug which can result in a dead machine in pl12.  Pl13 seems
to be reasonably stable - I haven't had too many complaints yet,

Try getting the 0.99.13 kernel, and use that instead of 0.99.12.  That
is likely to stop the hangs.

NAH !
rc.net is for the network only, and as far as I know, xdm is the X daemon .. ;)

*IF* you would start xdm from a script at bootup, put it to rc.local, where it
belongs ...

Title: Help: SIOCADDRT error while executing /etc/route in net-2

Summary: SIOCADDRT: Network is unreachable - error occurs during
execution or rc.inet1 while booting. I am using kernel level
0.99p12 and net-2 TCP/IP software. Any help will be appreciated.

Hi all,
        I have been trying to install the NET-2 TCP/IP package on 
my Linux box (which is a 486/33 MHz SVGA box). The ethernet
card is an SMC Elite Plus (WD 8013 - I believe). I have 
recompiled the 0.99.p12 kernel to include my ethernet card, and
the boot time message claims that it has the correct IRQ, base
memory address and base I/O address for the card. subsequently,
within rc.inet1 I run ifconfig for eth0 with the IPADDR, the
NETMASK and the BROADCAST address set correctly. (I tried both
with and without broadcast, w/o any luck). It seems that the
ifconfig works correctly, because running ifconfig after booting
with no arguments shows two interfaces, loopback and eth0, with
the correct parameters. Subsequently, rc.inet1 tries to run
/etc/route as
/etc/route add 130.183.80.62 (which is the IP addr of my box)
and that generates the error
SIOCADDRT: Network is unreachable. 
any executions of route generate the same error.

I know that the ethernet is correctly connected and it works, since
I can use a DOS program to run the ethernet card from my DOS
partition, which works just fine. 

I would appreciate any help in the matter.
        Thanks a lot

Unfortunately, dhry typically doesn't find the system-specific value of
HZ, and it will default to 60 in this case.  This would have happened under
Linux (which defines only CLK_TCK, not HZ, in its include files); perhaps 
*BSD defines HZ, or perhaps dhry had been built with -DHZ=100 under *BSD.
This is still the only way to explain the original discrepancy in timings.

A quick check of MIPS Ultrix 4.3, SunOS 4.1.3, NextStep 2.1 and Vax BSD 4.3
reveals that all of them use HZ=60 when returning a value via times(),
by the way; my guess at HZ in BSD was based on Vax BSD.

THIS is the only correct statement in this posting.  For whatever reason,
the mouse can't be accessed.  Since I don't run Linux, I can't help with
this.

c) Either install the PEX part of the distribution or relink the server
   with PEX excluded (using the Link Kit).  Then beat up the SLS distributer
   for only including half of the package.

It is essentially harmless, though.

Not a timing error.  There just doesn't happen to be a valid clock selected
