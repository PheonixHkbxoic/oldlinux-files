Subject: Mouse Info
Date: 6 Sep 1993 23:03:54 -0400

Please point me in the right direction of there is am FAQ on this but I
have looked everywhere.

I have a Logitech Trackball Bus Mouse.  This mouse emulates a Microsoft
mouse and is compatible with Mouse.Com for MSDOS.

Linux (SLS 1.03) detects the card (set on irq 2) and tells me so on startup.

I have /dev/mouse symbolicly linked to /dev/busmouselogitech.

When I run Xwindows the mouse is detected but I can't move it.

in Xconfig, I have busmouse "/dev/mouse".

The funny thing is that I had VGA card installed previously that had a bus
mouse port on board.  This port worked fine.  Unfortunately this VGA card 
was not SVGA and not to fun for X.

Any help would be appreciated.  I would like to know if there is a way to
test the mouse outside of X at least.

When i type cat /dev/mouse I am told to try again.  I can't cat the mouse
movements.

Also, I would like to know how to install a serial mouse.  When SLS was
installed it asked me if I had a mouse and if I had a modem.  It said I
could change these things lateer with syssetup.  When I ran syssetup the
program ran, and dropped back to the prompt in 2-3 seconds and did nothing.

Is there a way to get this to run?

Thanks

Subject: Bugs with .99pl12
From: levinson@vax.sonoma.edu
Date: 6 Sep 93 20:09:21 -0800

I have just compiled and put on my system .99pl12 and noticed several problems
that you may want to know about.

1)  Sometimes when I boot, I cannot use my keyboard.  None of the keys do
anything including the numlock keys.  I have to reboot and hope the filesystem
is not corrupted.

2)
I downloaded ext2fsprogs 0.3.  When I run e2fsck on my hard disk, it checks,
then it marks it clean.  If I try to run e2fsck again, it says that the
filesystem is clean and exits.  I know this is normal conduct for e2fsck.  The
problem is that when I reboot (using shutdown -r now) the first mount says it
is mounting an unchecked file system, which leads me to believe that shutdown
marked it dirty???  then when my e2fsck runs (which I placed in /etc/rc) it
goes thru the whole kit and kaboodle and checks the filesystem.  Anyone know
why this is and how to correct it?  It should only actually check the system if
it is not marked clean.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Please respond via private mail if you
can.

I am using a Diamond Stealth 24 VLB (na na naa na na) and a CTX 17" monitor
to run X in 1024 X 768 and I'm having problems with X refreshing the screen
automatically.  It's noticably bad when you try to look at the menu from 
on top another window.

I think I either saw a FAQ on this or someone posted a solution in c.o.l. but
I've seen soo much paperwork in the last week while installing this that I
can't remember where it was.

Is there an easy solution or a way to map a keystroke to do an xrefresh?

Thanks,
Tom Bilan

OTOH, there is some sort of bug in networking with the p12 kernel, I can
with regularity crash the kernel and cause it to write a core file until
ANY disk partition runs out of capacity, I've gotten 142mb core files at
times, and you can imagine that takes awhile to generate! :-(  Most of
the time after it runs out of disk space, I can regain control of the
system and continue, of course the first step is to kill off the monster
core file!

        Try putting the line NoSpeedUp in Xconfig. That might fix the problems 
with the screen leaving bits of windows/not refreshing right, etc. I had 
problems with at ET4000 card until I disabled the speed up code. I think the 
speed up code might be buggy or doesn't work with certain buggy chipsets 
(not just Diamond I'm afraid, any Xfree people know about this?)....

        Adding NoSpeedUp to Xconfig might not help, but it might, so give it a
try.

        Do you know under what conditions you can regularly crash the kernel? 
Compile Linux with -g and lookup the EIP value using gdb 
/usr/src/linux/tools/system, and do a list *0xeipvalue. If the system doesn't 
do a crash dump, try using alt-scroll lock to get the EIP value. This could 
help finding the bug(s).

Hi there,

I found through trial and error that I could not do a serial login from ttys1 and with ttyS1, it comes up with the login prompt and will only accept the login name before freezing the port.  Lastly, I tried using cua1 and that has worked perfectly.  I am using Linux SLS distribution 1.02 as well.

Just my 2 cents worth.

Phil

First:
I have installed SLS 1.03 on my PC.
After kernel rebuilding, I used  Quickinstall to  boot linux from hard disk, 
but it seems to hang on boot. (It says LI... and dies)

Second:
I am not able to use properly all tree buttons of Microsoft serial Mouse.
It works fine only in tree buttons emulation mode.
Any ideas?

IMHO this is the main structural bug in most "BBS"-setups for
UNIX. There you have an operating system that went through
great pains to stick an owner-ID to each system object (files,
processes, devices and so on) and the first thing a UNIX-BBS
does is to put all its users under a single UID. The second
thing the BBS does is to duplicate the effort the OS made to
seperate the BBS users and their data again - apparently a
major braindamage.

IMHO a BBS setup for UNIX should consist mainly of two parts.

The first is the BBS program in form of a users shell with
integrated news and mail users agent. Such a program should
utilize native UNIX news and mail transport agents and not try
to implement a propietary data format.

The second part would be an administrators shell for easy
creation and removal of users.

Subject: UUCP on SLS 1.03
Date: Tue, 7 Sep 1993 13:03:21 GMT

[I think this is a Linux rather than a UUCP question. :-)]

I have been "playing" the UUCP capability of LInux SLS 1.03 for the
past few days (and nights. :-)) I used /dev/modem which is softlinked
to /dev/cua1 (COM 2) with uugetty -r set for /dev/modem in
/etc/inittab.  Also I used Any in the relevent entries in the
/usr/lib/uucp/Systems file (just to test things out).

Here are several observations:

1) When SLS 1.03 is first installed, the system talks to the modem
   (but no dialing out) frequently and then after a while (like an hour
   or more), it leaves the modem alone.
2) Having done the necessary modifications to Devices, Dialers, and
   Systems in the /usr/lib/uucp directory and the paths and config
   files in the smail directory (don't remember the exact path
   anymore), I could test my UUCP link using the command:
       /usr/lib/uucico [-f] -x2 -s<hostname>
   Without the -x2 (or higher e.g. x3, x4) flag, Linux would not
   initiate a call otherwise uucico dials out with and without the -f
   or the -r flags set.
3) I use crontab to schedule dialouts with the -f and -x2 flag on (I
   want to make sure that the system dials out).  Everything works
   fine for a day or so and then
       /usr/lib/uucico -f -r1 -x2 -s<hostname>
   would do nothing except create the LCK..* and TMP...... files
   in /usr/spool/uucp.  The audit.local and other logs in the
   /usr/spool/uucp don't seem to get updated when this happens (i.e.,
   when uucico doesn't initiate a dialout).  Usually the logs will say
   something or explain why the dialout didn't occur and a couple of
   modem lights will flicker for a few seconds but in this case nothing.

Questions:
a) How tightly "hardcoded" is the uucp neighbor "quick" to SLS 1.03?
b) How fast does the C.* and D.* files get created in the
   /usr/spool/uucp/hostname directory?  I notice that sometimes those
   files (email addressed to hostname) get created as soon as I "send"
   them out of the mail program (Emacs rmail mode) but then there are times
   I notice that the files don't get created that quickly.
c) I haven't left my system alone long enough (e.g. for > 24 hours)
   to see if the UUCP link will "wake" up again.  Is the uucico's behavior
   described in 3 above expected?

I had a similar problem...and I was told to remove the speedup code (via the 
NoSpeedUp in Xconfig.) However, it had NO effect (I'm using an S3 video board,
tho). I also got another suggestion. "Try a different Windows-Manager" That
worked very well. I'm using fvwm, and it works pretty well, thank you.
