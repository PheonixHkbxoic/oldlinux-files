Per message 58795 I posted about not being able to get NFS to mount,
I also discovered when I boot .99pl13, it does not say anything about getting
an interrupt.  .99pl9 says GOT IRQ 5.  .99pl13 doesnt say anything.

I have a Colorado Jumbo 250 (QIC-80) 125Mb Tape-Streamer.
My question is: Is there any Linux package system (SLS, etc)
that has a suitable script to install the whole LINUX system
from a tape *directly* (only using a 'disk1' booting diskette)?

Thank you in advance for any information.

Is anyone using the Mitsumi LU005S CD-ROM with Linux?  I found no

Do CD-ROM with their own interface cards work in general with Linux?

Subject: Sound card problem
Date: 30 Sep 1993 02:32:53 GMT


Hi,
    I have been running Linux for a while, and it runs great on my 486SX-33
w/ 4Meg of RAM.  But I can't run X because my sound card conflicts w/ my
serial mouse.
    I have an 8-bit Thunderboard sound card and a Logitech serial mouse in
my system.  I know that the problem is w/ the sound card because when I took
it out, X-windows came up fine.  Also, when I boot Linux, it says that it
has found a network card when it does an ethernet probe.  It didn't do this
when the card was removed (I don't have an ethernet card).  I've tried
changing the IRQ address and I/O address, and even inserting the card into
another slot, but with no avail.
    I've heard that I have to re-compile the kernel for Linux to properly
recognize my sound board.  I would greatly appreciate anyone out there that
could tell me exactly how to solve my problem, as I have no idea how to
re-compile the Linux kernel.  Please email me replies, as I don't read this
group often enough, and the files on our news server aren't kept that long
due to tight disk space.  Thanks in advance.

GNU-emacs is of an other order than the rest, with its M-x compile,
the Grand Unified Debugger, tags, ange-ftp, complete configurability
and reprogrammability, so that you can emulate any of the editors that

Some may think it is nonsense to read mail and news from within an
'editor', but the same set of keybindings everywhere, and complete
integration with the editor is a great blessing.

I hestitate to even stick my head out too far, b/c this doesn't seem to be a
terribly civiklised discussion, but there is a smallish group working (slowly)
on a WP for linux - (and any other platoform you care to port it to I suppose) -
we have aimed (in my opinion) fairly high - in that we want to write a WP
based on the Standard Generic Markup Language - what yu would call a structured
word processor. There are a lot of issues, and we are tackling them slowly - 
there will be much noise if/when this thing gets working, but this year isn't
a likely release date. If you wiosh to stir things up (the mail list has been
a bit slow lately) - you can join the linux-activists channel word to hear any
mail. Otherwise, I suggest you start reading the Tex Book - flames will be

Reply-To: jc%minya.uucp@eddie.mit.edu

Well, I finally found the newsgroup, and digging around via rn didn't
enlighten me, so I thought I'd up and ask ...

A couple of friends are looking at a project that needs a reasonably
small kernel that they can hack with their own real-time stuff, and
box for some customers.  They'd like to have as much Unix stuff on it
so as to make their own lives not too horrible, and they're looking
around at available kernels.  They are, of course, horrified by such
things as Sys/V and BSD, but they've heard some rave reviews of Linux,
along with a comment that "It only runs on Intel 80-whatevers".

So the question is:  Is this true, or has it been ported to other
processors?  If so, which processors (and how might one go about getting
in touch with the Right People)?  If not, well, suppose someone were
to take on the job of porting it to, say, a Motorola or MIPS or Alpha,
would this likely be a 3-month project, or a 10-year project?  Where
would the portability problem likely lie?

As usual, please respond via email; if I get queries of the "me too"
sort, I'll post a summary...

Has anyone got the busmouse that comes with the ATI Graphics Ultra Plus

changed if necessary.  Right now the mouse pointer sits in the middle 
of the screen, and is locked up.

Once this is figured out, I will publish my Xconfig and the magic
formula to make this work for all others in the same predicament.
