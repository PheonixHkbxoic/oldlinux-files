I think this step is your problem... you don't want to shell out of kermit
(if you do, it will probably still be listening to /dev/modem and receive
all the characters which should be going to term), you want to quit it
completely.  If your modem is fussy about hanging up when it loses DTR, you
may want to tell it 'at&d' before you start so that it won't hang up before
you have a chance to start term.

I hope that helps,
Gary.

Subject: X-Display problems
Date: 7 Oct 93 00:41:16 GMT

I'm hoping this is the right conference to ask this question. I know it deals
with X, but it concerns Linux.

My problem is running x programs in an Xterm window. I think I've narrowed my
problem down to permission settings, but I don't know where to begin. I've
read so many FAQs and HOW-TO's and none seem to answer my question.

If I am root, I can call x programs (such as xv, xman) from the prompt
in my Xterm window. Also, I have these programs setup in a pop-window.
If I'm NOT root, then I can't run these programs in my Xterm, only from
the menu. The error I get is "Can't open display". I've tried 
        setenv DISPLAY darkstar:0.0
but this doesn't work. I won't get an error, but it doesn't help. I've
tried xhost darkstar but that doesn't work either. I just get the error
can't open display.

I'm using the open-look windows manager, if that's any help.

Thanks for any information you could lend,

Subject: /proc, ptys and su on /dev/ttyS0
Date: Thu, 7 Oct 1993 00:16:25 GMT

Ok, I got the most recent SLS installed (got it from sunsite, only days ago).

Here are the three problems I'm having:

a] /proc won't mount even tho it's in fstab. If I log in as root and do a
   "/bin/mount -av -t nonfs" it mounts fine, but this line appears in /etc/rc
   and does nothing! Why? I've moved it around, put echo's before and after
   it to verify it's being executed. No output generated by it, /proc
   not mounted. Line line in fstab is:

   /proc /proc proc defaults

b] When I'm running X and I open too many xterms the beast locks up tight.
   Am I running out of pty's? There are dozens in /dev, but only the first
   four of them have modification times other than the far past. Ideas?

c] I've added a line to inittab for ttyS0 so I can hang a terminal off of
   it. I put /bin/getty 9600 ttyS0, and I get a prompt, etc, on the
   terminal. I can log in, but it hangs partway through the login
   procedure. Just after displaying "No Mail." it goes into never never
   land. It doesn't get as far as /etc/profile or .bashrc. I can
   control-c to a $ prompt. Experimentation there has shown su will
   also cause a similar lock up which can be control-c'd out of. Ideas?


Thanks for the help in advance,
PG

I had this problem while I had my Linux box and another PC connected to one
printer through one of those switch-boxes (mechanical switch, not a smart one!)

No problems at all with DOS or MS-Windows, but Linux on my PC kept saying 'Out
of paper' until I connected the printer directly.

I'm not quite sure what caused it, but I guess in your case it could be a slight
fault in the printer cable. (Perhaps an out of paper line being shorted or something...)
MS-DOS apps seem to ignore it. I can print a text from MS-Word 5.0 even when my Epson
LX-800's 'Out of paper' light is flashing!

I can't find the testresult in my benchmark.:

My benchmachine:  486/33 MHz, Eisa, 16MB DRam
      BSD0.9   :  setup as latest distribution 
                  max. 188 context switches / sek.
                  can't get CPU idle state less then 89% 
                  this machine don't use free menory for buffering
 
Reason for this:
        The machine works as NFS-Server
        has one HD 1GB with 1742B controller, kernel, news, ...all on one HD
        and we have to use NE2000 drivers witch don't use the interrupt
        (they use polling !!!!)
        because no other of our ISA-ethernet-card (WD, SMC, 3COM)
        works on our Eisa-motherboard.
        The most time this machine is loading executables, and data
        because there is no cache, no shared libraries, no ?...

Result: The BSD0.9 is 4 times slower than my private setup with Linux.
        This system might be fast, but we have no advantage, 
        we can only use 12% of CPU performance, and 70% of memory.

Next to do: Replace this BSD and this CPU-Platform. 
Joerg

I have run X on the non-VLB version of your card, the Diamond Stelth

I've had a few system crashes under X, but I've also had X running

My suggestion is to get the tamux package installed on your machine.  It
includes a "blank" Xconfig that will help get you started.  All you have 
to do is install this Xconfig, use Ctrl-Alt-[numeric keypad +] to cycle 
through the video modes, and write down the ones that work the best for you.

Unfortunately, you have to count yourself, beginning at one, what the number of
the modes are (since there are no indicators).  Then, remove all lines from 
the Xconfig video database that you don't want.  Finally, use vgaset to
optimize things (to help you center your screen, e.g.).

You can get a tamux setup package somewhere in one of the x-disks for slackware
at ftp.cdrom.com in pub/linux/slackware/x(something or other).

Good luck,

Just posted a reply along similar lines to your request (look for it).  
In a nutshell, get the tamux setup package.  The "blank" Xconfig and the
excellent documentation will get you up and running in no time.

You can get tamux setup from ftp.cdrom.com in pub/linux/slackware/x(I don't

Thanks to Arnd Gehrmann and Wayne Stidolph.  With their mail I pieced together
the following:

 Modify /usr/include/linux/busmouse.h and set the IRQ to 9 (from 5 or 
  whatever yours is set to).  The reason it is not set to 2, which is
  what the hardware IRQ was set to, is because IRQ2 is used by another,
  so IRQ2 gets 'cascaded' to IRQ9.

 Make config from the /linux directory and tell it to look for a MS busmouse.
  Then make the kernel.

 Create a symbolic link, just for clarity, using
  ln -s /dev/bmousems /dev/mouse

 In the Xconfig file, do not specify Microsoft "/dev/mouse".  Use 
  Busmouse "/dev/mouse".  Don't know why a Microsoft mouse does not work
  with the Microsoft setting, but when I used the Microsoft setting, the
  freaked and was acting as if I was holding the button down.

Glad I don't have to go out and get a serial mouse!

No, there is no token ring support in Linux.  To support token ring requires
more than only a writing a device driver, it also requires writing the source
routing routines for token ring.  Given that token ring is expensive, not
fast, and will probably be swept away by 100baseVG in a few months, it doesn't
seem worth it to write a driver.

Now if someone would loan or sell me a prototype 100base-* setup (2 cards and
a hub), I probably would put some serious effort into getting it working...

Yes... there is a really good clone of the Norton Commander available

and is a commercial product, priced to be equivalent with the Norton

I tried selling this a couple of years ago and no one seemed interested,
(or no one wanted to pay, I guess).

In any event, if there is still interest, I know I can dig up copies for
people.  Just have to know what platforms (Linux, Xenix, etc) they want

        I have been thinking about just this thing. I would use OB/OI
as it seems fairly easy to use and it would be good to show some
support for the product. 

        Each of the sections could be written and then merged into a
main utility. If it's designed carfully, if should be extendable as
well. As for the compile time stuff. Once the gui is set, it could be
compiled into a *.o files and then linked with the code for
maintaining the files.

        I think it would be good to have it very flexable. For
example, with UUCP automatically figuring out which type of config
files you are using and offering a conversion option to one of the
others. That way the user is offered a list of systems, they pick a
system (or add a new one) and get options to either clear/delete it,
or edit it's 'capabilities'.
