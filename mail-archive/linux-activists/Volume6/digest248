I am running a package called gf here which uses another fairly
large package called sgmls via a popen command. The second package
is a parser. The two work fine the first time, and then malfunction
the second and subsequent times. Doing an ls -R /  however clears the
buffer cache apparently and the program will run again once. If anyone
is interested in this bug, I can provide more details. I am using the
extended 2 file system on a 486-50. The bug is does not exhibit itself in pl4
according to the author of pl 4.

        I'm hoping this is a real simple problem that someone can
help me fix. I'm trying to get a linux box onto the net and it isnt
working so hot. At boot up time, the rc comes up with the error:
        SIOCADDRT: network unreachable
        SIOCADDRT: network unreachable

        If i try to telnet, it just hangs for a while, if i take the cable
out and try, it comes up with a bad cable error. Its the MCC p10 installation
with a p12 kernel. This is what rc.inet1 looks like:
   HOSTNAME=`hostname`

   /usr/etc/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
   /usr/etc/route add 127.0.0.1

   IPADDR="128.123.1.55"
   NETMASK="255.255.255.0"
   NETWORK="128.123.1.0"
   BROADCAST="128.123.1.255"

   /usr/etc/ifconfig eth0 ${IPADDR} netmask ${NETMASK} broadcast ${BROADCAST}
   /usr/etc/route add ${IPADDR}
   /usr/etc/route add ${NETWORK}
   /usr/etc/route add default gw ${GATEWAY} metric 1

Thats it. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Oh, BTW: its a 486-25
with a wd8003 8-bit card. Heres another question, at bootup, it seems
to autodetect everything that goes into the CONFIG in net/inet in the
kernel source, I defined it all anyway and compiled, but do i really
have to? Thanks,

The user that run xconsole MUST BE the owner of /dev/console, and have the rw
rights on it.  At login, you have do  a 
chown $USER /dev/console; chmod 600 /dev/console (or 655)
whith xdm, it can be done in the script defined by the DisplayManager._0.startup
resource. This script is run as root after the passwd controle.
In the srcipt defined by the DisplayManager._0.reset: resource, you can do a
chown root /dev/console;chmod 600 (or 655) /dev/console.
If you uses startx, i thick you whill have to do a root seteuid program to do this.

        Get a bigger SCSI disk -- prices being what they are, you can
        pick up a Toshiba 1.2GB 9ms. SCSI-2 drive for around $900. (us)
        it's worth spending a little more from the price of the  545 MB
        drive to get more storage.  And it looks like you're sparing no
        expense in setting up a killer system!

: I plan to attach scsi tape drive in the future, any recommendation

        With the size disk you've got, get a large capacity one.. the
        150s and 250s can get really annoying when you have to change
        tapes all the time.  If you expect your system to grow and can
        afford it, get something like the Exabyte 8mm 2.3GB scsi drive
        (it's external, but very good)  It'll cost more initially, but
        will be worth it in the future as you add more disk space.  Also,
        you can use those home-video 8mm cartridges which you can get for
        as little as $3.00 each as opposed to 15-20 bucks each for the QIC
        tapes! -- this adds up to big savings when you implement a decent
        backup strategy.  You can sometimes find the Exabytes used for very
        good prices - since it's scsi, it doesn't matter who makes it.  I'm
        using one that came off a Sun workstation -- just plugged it into
        the buss, entered the appropriate "find ..... | cpio -ovO /dev/rmt0"
        command and it took off and ran fine!  I am STILL trying to figure 
        out where they put all that data on those tiny little tapes!
        Oh - if you go this route, don't let the salescritters talk you 
        into "data-quality" media as opposed to vcr type tape -- this is
        utter bullshit - if it can record and reproduce a video signal, it
        has far greater bandwidth and frequency response than is needed for
        mere digital data!

Well the 1542C supports SCSI-2 whereas the B does not. Furthermore 1542C allows
you to enter the SCSI-select program for test and configuration purposes from
ROM at boot time, so you don't need SCSI-select utilities :-)

The problem is that the ultrastor uses a non-standard chipset to control
the SCSI peripherals.  If you contact gateway and make a big fuss that you
are having compatibility problems, they will replace the card.  The card to
demand is the Adaptec 1742.  It is also a 32 bit EISA SCSI controller. I am
currently waiting on my replacement card, since I had the same problem. I
have heard of many successful installations using the adaptec card, so that
is why I am recommending it.  Good Luck....

By convention, X programs that intercept the console will only do so
if the person running them owns the console.  I know that the xdm
GiveConsole and TakeConsole scripts should take care of ownership
of the console device, but if you just run startx, it probably doesn't.
        FYI, I'm not sure what the console device is under Linux (I'm
at work right now), but on my RS/6000, it is /dev/console.

I have finally got my auto-answer to work consistently.  I used the
default file in /usr/local/lib/src/getty/etc/default/uugetty.ttys0 (or
something like that I don't remember which exactly :-).  There are
several files in that directory, I used the one setup for 2400 baud.
I also added a couple of delays to get things to work for my modem.
Since I soft-linked /dev/modem to /dev/cua1, I copy that file to
/etc/default/uugetty.cua1 and soft-linked /etc/default/uugetty.modem
to it.  /dev/cua1 is the same port I used for dialing out to my UUCP
neighbor for my mail connection.  That has worked beautifully for
quite a while.

I am still playing around with the settings in
/etc/default/uugetty.modem(or cua1) As there are still some minor
problems like "+++AT" gets printed on the remote screen on hangup and
the /dev/modem line doesn't hang up when the other side hangs up.

Subject: Got trouble: Linux doesn't see UltraStor SCSI adaptor
Date: Tue, 21 Sep 1993 15:27:16 GMT

A friend of mine came to town this weekend with the intent of getting
Linux installed on his machine -- I'd told him it'd be an easy one-afternoon
task, but I'm afraid I ended up with egg on my face...

When we booted Linux on his machine from the SLS A1 disk it claimed
that it saw 0 hosts, 0 disks, 0 CD-ROM's, and 0 tape drives.
Figuring that it was just a problem with that disk, we booted with
HJ's rootdisk, but that didn't do any better.  And according to the
hardware compatability list, it oughta work.  His machine is a
Tristar GA-486VT 33MHz DX2 with an UltraStor 14f HF ISA SCSI Host
adapter & a Seagate ST3550N hard disk at SCSI ID 0 & a Texel CDRom
at SCSI ID 2.

I'm hoping we just need to set some sort of jumper or something like
that to get it to work, but I couldn't find anything that made sense
to either of us.  (The SCSI HowTo is definitely written for SCSI gurus --
or at least people who know alot about SCSI interfaces, which neither
of us do.)

In addition, and here's another case where I'm almost certainly being
a bonehead or something -- when SLS boots, it chucks up a prompt that
says something to the effect of remove the a1 disk and put in the
``utilities'' disk and then press 1 if you put it in a 5.25" A drive,
2 if you put it in a 3.5" A drive, etc.

What utilities disk?

I installed SLS myself about a million years ago, and I remember being
stumped on that same question, but I somehow figured out what to do there,
but this time things didn't work out that way...  I thought for sure that
this utilities disk was either A1 or A2, but neither of those approaches
seemed to work.  Finally I went over to my machine and constructed a floppy
with a minix file system and a bunch of stuff that looked useful on it
(fdisk, mke2fs, etc.)  That worked, but it was pretty much for nothing
since Linux didn't think /dev/sda was connected to anything.

So anyway, that's my story, and I'd sure appreciate it if somebody could
clear things up for me.

It's a simple matter to do so on a unix-style system as well.  There are
even programs to do it in /etc.  You just need to set permissions for your
co-sysops to do it.

No it isn't.  As a matter of fact, I have a friend (yes, it's not firsthand
experience, but I know of what I speak) running a homebrew BBS that's
nothing but a bunch of Perl scripts, used as a user's login shell.  And he
has a user 'new', that can create an account for a new user.  He doesn't
have to do anything by hand.

Now, he also doesn't have any real access restrictions in his system.  If
you've got access to news, you get all the groups, etc.  This is something
that is desireable in a BBS/public access environment, since you may not
want everyone reading everything that's out there.  There have been hacks
given to solve this (different groups for different newsgroups, but that
turns into a maintenance nightmare as well), but none of them more than a
hack....

Actually, what I think is a HUGE limiting factor to the unix BBS's is the
fact that no 2 tools are consistant in their user interfaces.  Mailers are
completely different from news readers, when, in reality, news and email
look about the same to the everyday user.

For example - put a newbie down in front of elm, and then try to
differentiate between when elm gets used and when trn gets used.  And then
try to explain why the commands are all different for the same sorts of
functions (next article, next message, highlight bars as opposed to none,
etc.).

For the non-computer literate, or a person who hasn't had much experience
(you know, the target market for most BBS's), the inconsistant command
interface is a HUGE problem.

Followups to comp.os.linux.misc, because comp.os.linux doesn't really exist

I've been having lockups ever since I dropped in the ET4000, but I've been
blaming the hardware.

Generally, the lockup will occur when I'm moving a window.  I'm using
either TWM or FVWM - doesn't matter.  Also doesn't matter how long the
machine's been on, or how long I've been running in X.  Or even, really
what's going on.  I can pull up an xterm, and when I go to place it, if I
move it around as a wire frame too much, it'll freeze after redrawing bits
of the frame.

Also, another IMPORTANT data point:  Same thing happens under DesqView/X,
under similar conditions.  So I can't blame XFree, unless they're both
using the same style ET4000 drivers....

I haven't tried shutting off the speedup code - I'll give that a shot next,
and see how long it takes to see the problems again.  It's pretty random,
but it's started to happen more and more again lately....

Hi world!!

I have installed the SLS 1.03 and all is almost OK except the fact
that sometimes under X11 the system suddenly hangs without any possibility
of escape, except the RESET button.
Is it possible that Xmem or Xload could generate some problems ???
(I read something about the trouble caused by Xmem or Xload on the news
but I don't remember....)
Please someone can help me ????????

Thanks very very much!!!

Bye, Luke.
