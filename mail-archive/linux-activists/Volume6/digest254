I've run several "benchmarks" on both a 486DX-33 and a Sun IPC with the
overall result that the PC was in the same ballpark as the Sun.  The
benchmarks were:  Drystone test, whetstone test, and a large TeX file
that came with the SLS distribution (gentle.tex).  The PC went from
a .tex file to a .dvi file, using the same version of tex, in a little
more than half the time that it took the Sun.  OTOH, the Sun was slightly
faster on the first two tests.

For my purposes, there was no need to go further.  I had satisfied
myself that the Linux box was roughly in the same ballpark as the
workstation on which this message is being composed.  However, the
Sun cost in excess of $10,000 when it was new (the prices have since
dropped), and that's quite a bit more than was paid for the PC. In
terms of cost / effectiveness, Linux has already outdistanced the
Sun.

Date: Thu, 23 Sep 93 13:41:59 GMT

Hi there,

I have already posted this but due to a Probleme with my address in the header
I repost it an other time:


 I have installed the SLS 1.03 release, with some problems.

 My machine is a 486DX50, 8Mo RAM, 214Mo  HD(IDE), screan NEC 4FG
 mouse MS compatible 3 bottons, AZERTY keyboard, NCR 77C22E (2Mo) video card
 with a DOS and a LINUX partitions.

1- after runing fdisk and writing the partition table to the disk, I had this
 message:
   79076 unallocated sectors. Is it that bad ???

2- at the tex pkgs installation I had thsi message:
   installing texbin...tar:could not create file usr/TeX/lib/tex/inputs:Is
   a directory

3- at the end of installation, when the system write the de boot floppy
   I had this message:
   Setting up lilo on $ROOTDISK
    If any specify a DOS partition to (...blabla...):/dev/hda2 (my LINUX 
    partition, I answered!!)
    First boot sector of /dev/hda2 doesn't have a lilo signature (what's wrong??) 

4- an other message;
    open /etc/lilo/map no such file or directory

==============end of installation

after reboot, I tried to change the american keyboard into french keyboard 
with setkbd but it asked for files I don't know where they are.
The README file is not very clear for me.
same problem with the doc of X11, I haven't found the doc for my video card,
to change the clock parameter and so.

Any help greatly apreciated, if any one around here is using a NCR 77C22E 
video card and have a runing Xconfig file, send it to me via email.

I would prefer email answers if any, there's a lot of trafic in this newsgroup

Thanx a lot

Ok, quick question about the I/O.  On the sparcs, are the drives local?
Or are they mounted through NFS?  (Some sites mount local drives through
NFS for some reason, don't ask me why).  NFS is MUCH slower than direct
access.  Also, what OS is being run?  We had Sparc classics at work running
Solaris 2.2 (*PUKE*) - when one of the guys there got SunOS 4.1.3 up
and running on the classic the difference in performace was unbelievable.
I would almost dare say twice as fast, though that might be overly
optimistic, but there was a VERY noticable difference.  

>Now, I'm kind of biased.  I personally believe Sparcs are junk, and that

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say Sun's are better (I happen to
like a linux machine better than a sun if only for no other reason than
the fact that the OS is free, and the hardware is cheaper), just to point
out some reasons for these numbers.  

D

note:  Just as an aside, X runs GREAT on my roommate's 486/33 w 8megs.
       (I don't own my own machine... :( - but i do have a terminal 
       hooked up to the serial port, which i'm using now while he works
       on C++ ;)  - it runs faster than the DECstation 2100's at school,
       and some of the SPARC's that we had at work.

Slackware is a Linux distribution like SLS. Here are some others:

MCC (from the Manchester Computing Center)
TAMU (Texas A&M University)
Debian (Soon to be released)

Personally I've used SLS and Slackware. I prefer Slackware because it has
many less bugs (at least in my case).

Hope this helps,

Subject: Setting up user accts.
Date: 23 Sep 1993 15:29:33 GMT

I have been successfully running linux for about a month now and I have friends
that are trying it out but one of them seems to be having a problem setting
up user accounts.  I told him to type:
useradd -m name
passwd name
Which works fine for me but when the users log in they don't have write
permission to their own directory.  I thought the problem was easy enough
to rectify so I said do (at the /home prompt):
chmod 777 name
chown name name
chgrp other name
Which set the permissions on the users directory and it still didn't work
so I had him change the mode for the /home directory to 777.  And it still
doesn't work...

I'm out of suggestions.  I beginning to wonder how mine ever worked :)

It's probably something stupid so don't make me(us) feel bad...:(

Thanks,
Tom

Although it's not much I can add this:

My Gateway 2000 4DX2-66V (running Linux) is about 3 times faster than
the SS 1+ on a compilation job of about 100,000 lines (in 150 files).

Date: 23 Sep 1993 15:44:17 GMT



     Help! :)
I am not new to Linux,, but I can't figure this one out.
I have a 386-33 8megs RAM 220meg IDE, mono, 10BT ,etc,etc....

And a 14.4k modem as /dev/cua1
I have set up uugetty, so I can dial out with cu, etc....
And I can dialin and either login as a regular user OR login as a SLIP
user and automatically start "dip"

The problem I am having is that if you drop the connection when running
a program (ex. "dip", "ping", etc...) it just hangs the process, instead
of killing it and uugetty respawning.

What gives? The "dip" man page says it will die it it looses carrier.
And if you log out normally it resets fine.
Also in "cu" if you do a ~. the modem resets (showing that DTR is
working correctly).

One other question. How do I setup a Charon LPR process to print BINARY
files to my LJ2 connected to /dev/lp1?
It is a remote lpr request, and it works for text files but not binary
files. Pretty useless for anything with different fonts than my printer.

All help is wanted! :)

I've got a very similar machine, except for the controller is ide
and the motherboard is EISA/VESA/ISA (oh, and a different VGA board).

Actually, I assume that the above system is ALSO VESA since the

Dunno but they are aging fast...

My advice to you is, get MCC and install Xfree over the top. It's not
difficult (from the posts I have seen recently SLS seems to make it harder :/)

I had 90% of MCC installed, plus all of XFree except PEX and the fonts, in
35MB, so you shouldn't have any problems.
