Subject: NovellLite and SLS
Date: 30 Sep 1993 13:21:23 GMT

  I have three PCs (386/486) connect via Ethernet NE2000. On two of these
  I installed NWLite 1.1 for printer and HD sharing. Recently, I tried Linux 
  on the third one and it's really great. I read that Linux supports NFS.
  Questions:
     1. What exactly is NFS.
     2. Is it possible to access NWLite Server for printing and file-serving
        under Linux. I have IPXODI or IPXPKT as protokoll
     3. Or can NWLite simulate NFS in any way.
     4. Can I use TCPIP and IPX concurrently when running one PC with Linux
        and the others with NWLite. (with PKT and ODI driver it works, because
        with these you can bind multible protokolls to one LAN-Card, but I
        dont't know how Linux handles the net)

                        all infos are appreciated

First of all I would like to thank all the people that replyed to my post
I have learned a lot. It would be impossible to send to each of them
a mail, so thank you all!

this is a summary of the answers I've had to my problem, the firts important
thing is to read the man pages for bash.

The bash manual could help.

The syntax of setting variables in csh is weird. If your using the
Linux default shell (bash) then don't try to use the csh syntax.

Try something like:

PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:.

From jmadison@tech.iupui.edu Wed Sep 29 14:41:54 1993

well, this is probably the gazillionth reply, but. your profile's found
in /etc. it's called profile (as opposed to .profile).
_______________________________________________________________________________
From stenger@zeus.uni-duisburg.de Wed Sep 29 14:19:38 1993

with the SLS there comes am /etc/profile.
This is the common data-base file for all users.
The .profile is only used when Your shell is /bin/sh.
If Your shell is /bin/bash You have to create a .bashrc in Your homedirectory.
Here's mine:
========begin ~/.bashrc =========
.profile
========end ~/.bashrc ===========

If You want a shell like Suns csh You should get the tcsh-package.
it's on tsx-11 under: /pub/linux/binaries/usr.bin/tcsh-6.04.tar.gz
_______________________________________________________________________________
From teffta@cs690-3.erie.ge.com Wed Sep 29 14:51:08 1993

.profile is for bash and sh. you don't source it, you 'dot' it
to run it. . ~/.profile

.cshrc and .login are for csh (tcsh). You source them to run them.

environment variables are for csh. They are propagated to subshells.
csh also has variables which are not propagated to subshells.

PATH in sh is just a variable. You must say export PATH after you
change it, to propagate its value to subshells.
_______________________________________________________________________________
From deleeuw@dutiws.TWI.TUDelft.NL Wed Sep 29 17:26:53 1993

        echo $PATH
this shows the current value of path.

If you want to change the PATH variable anyway use:
        PATH=<new_path>
or 
        PATH=$PATH:<extra_path>
for example if you wanna add /usr/X386/bin to your path
        PATH=$PATH:/user/X386/bin
_______________________________________________________________________________
From mitchum.dsouza@mrc-applied-psychology.cambridge.ac.uk Wed Sep 29 15:49:31 1993

Your .profile uses bourne type syntax and thus your .cshrc from the sun will
NOT work as it is csh.

You need to either get tcsh (csh clone) working and use all your Sun .cshrc
and .login type files or read the bash man page (for .profile) thoroughly.

e.g. setting up PATH

On csh (.cshrc)
        % setenv PATH /usr/bin:/bin:/etc:./

On bash (.profile)
        % export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/etc:./
_______________________________________________________________________________
From stenger@zeus.uni-duisburg.de Wed Sep 29 15:04:47 1993

Like /etc/profile is the common database for sh /etc/csh.cshrc
is the common database for tcsh.
Make a link : ln -s /bin/tcsh /bin/csh
Now You can say "csh" for Your shell.
/etc/csh.cshrc doesn't exist yet, You have to create it; here's mine:

=======begin /etc/csh.cshrc =========
# common database for all users
# only german users have the csh so the German keyboard is loaded
# here and not in the /etc/rc.local
/etc/loadkeys /usr/lib/keytables/gr-latin1.map
setenv NOREBIND
setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1
# the next 3 lines are necessary to show the german Umlaute
foreach key ( \\374 \\334 \\366 \\326 \\344 \\304 )
   bindkey $key self-insert-command
end

Yup.  Got a Mitsumi and love it for the mney I paid and the amount I use it
(just about never :) 

Configuring the Mitsumi to work with Linux is a snap.   In fact, pl13 has
Mitsumi support in the kernel code (pl12 may, too).  If you're working with
some older kernel (?)  UPGRADE! No, seriously, there is a patch somewhere
on tsx to your kernel sources for support.  It's by a guy name Martin Harris.
It's called, I think mcd-somtheting.tar.z

Don't know if this is significant enough to help, but I never run term in
the background.  I just do this:

HP-UX [1]% term
<escape sequence>
Kermit> !term <>/dev/cua2

This works like a charm, but when you kill term, it hangs up the line.
It's possible (not sure) that backgrounding term will cause it to die
(like some programs do) and this may in turn hang up your line.

Not maybe, there is. Fips works OK, but only with DOS partitions. It can
be other partitions in the drive, from wherever and whicherver taste, but
fips will only split DOS ones. All you need is to have all the data at the
beginning of the partition (use Norton's SD) and call fips. It'll give you
the partition table, prompt you which part to split, and to what extent. If
it has some problem, leave the part table untouched, so it's fairly secure.

Getty itself display this, as the shell, during startup (I don't find
it in a script) displays the contents of /etc/motd

I tend to put in my nodename at the left margin and the IP address at the
right.  While not the most logical approach, it is mildly entertaining.

BTW, the "login" prompt is generated from the line in /etc/gettydefs,
so you can modify that prompt too...

Hi,
i had the same problem with my ATI GUP. What solved my problem was 
reconfiguring the Card to seperated VGA and accelerator mem.
My card was set to mem=shared and X messed up the screen on leaving.
With setting VGA ram size to 256, 512 or 1024 byte my screen is now
ok. This change can be done with the install utility that came with the
ATI card.
Hope that helps

Hi.  I have a user who's running my application from home and displaying it
on a PC with Linux running X11R5.  The server at work is X11R4 (HP-UX 8.0)
and the application was compiled with X11R4 libraries.  This is running 
over "term", which he says is Linux's compressed communication protocol.

When the application comes up, it tends to crash very easily with:

Xlib:  sequence lost (0x10000 > 0x1f) in reply type 0x0!
X Error of failed request:

The information you desire can probably be found in the bash man page.

However there is no need to learn bash unless you want to. csh and tcsh
are both available for Linux. Look on your favorite Linux ftp site if
they're not already on your system. Once you get them, use chsh to
set your default shell (must be listed in your /etc/shells).
