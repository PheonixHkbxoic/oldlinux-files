Hi.

I am going to write some device drivers for linux, and wonder 
if anybody have some information about this.

Device driver for SB16 ASP.
Device driver for MS160 Search Engine.

I have looked at the sound device drivers for linux,
but I could not figure out what to do.

Hi.

I'm running linux-0.99.13 on my 80486DX50 16MB RAM 490MB IDE SMC ELITE
SB16 ASP and MS160 cards.

I used SLS 1.03.

My problem is tat I can not get linux to run for more than 10h before
it's craches.

When I export X (logg out) it craches.
When nobody do anything it craches.
ARRRHHHGGG !!!

Some times (2 time) i can log in via telnet, but are not able to
start X again because I have no free VT.

Anybody who might now any solutions ?
Can I start som kind of debugging ?

Get the setserial package from tsx-11. It lets you do this and

Only the swapon command should be needed in /etc/rc; the mkswap needs
to be only once for each swap area (the mkswap doesn't really hurt,
except it takes a little while to run, and if you ever use /dev/hda2
for something else and forget to remove the mkswap from /etc/rc,
you're screwed).

The mkswap program writes a `swap area signature' to the file, in
addition to doing some other stuff (I'm not sure exactly what, but
that is irrelevant).  This has a ``lasting effect''.

The swapon tells the operating system that it can use a particular
swap area.  This has to be done each time the system is started, and
that's why the command has to be in /etc/rc (which is run when the
system starts).

No video problems yet. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

A simple question.  Why?  Is the msdos file system code not up to it? 
Mkswap creates identical files on xiafs and msdos (and presumably other)
file systems, but swapon says that it can't find the swap signature.

For detailed info look in the file serial.c in the kernel sources. It is
located in the subdir chr_drv.
I do not have the sources at hand but if I remember correctly there are #define
flags to enable the support for various serial cards ( 3 if I remember
correctly). In my case the auto detect did not work. You can either use
setserial or swith of the autoirq for serial io. I modified the config.in
script for this.
In the source you can also find which IO address and IRQ to use and the major
and minor numbers for the tty entries in /dev

First contact was good,mounting iso9660 works, but...
No audio capability. The Workman (with or without SCSI-2 ioctl-Patch)
didn't work, the xcdplayer works neither !

Any help appreciated !

Is this a bug in the WD7000, the WD7000-driver, the CD-Rom or the
application-program ??


Ciao
  and thanx

Hi.  I've used the ext2 format quite successfully with partition sizes
of 120Mb, so it should cope with 75Mb ok.
