Subject: different packages
Date: Tue, 21 Sep 1993 05:24:33 GMT

After downloading almost the entire SLS 1.03 distribution, I find that
my current system does not boot using the SLS a1.3.  It claims that I
have a sound card installed, and then hangs.  I removed all hardware but
for my MFM controler, and 512k ATI VGA Wonder. Still says I have a sound
card installed.  No-go.  Ok, so now I have spoken to people on irc who
say. . ."SLS?  Mistake!"  or "MCC is the best." or "Slackware is the
most bug free. . ."  Well, I ca't make sense of this at all.  So if
somone could please clear up the situation, I'd be most appreciative.

My questions are:  Which package is best for a new user to install?
which is the most error-free instalation?  Which contains all the
important stuff, including X-windows?  Which is the best?!!!! (grin).
 
I booted up Slackware's boot, and it worked fine.  It seems like quite
an excellent system, compared to my experience with SLS.  

Ok, so give me the low down on the different dists., and tell me if I
can keep the SLS "x" series of the disks, even if I install the
Slackware.

Thanks!

I've upgraded the kernel, shared libraries, and keyboard table utilities 
in the Slackware Linux distribution on ftp.cdrom.com. The files that
have changed are noted in README_ChangeLog. Just in case anyone was in
the middle of downloading (again), the old files will be saved in
/pub/linux/slackware/obsolete for a while. This also provides a nice
safety net in case I introduced any big bugs :^)

The kernel has been upgraded to the newly released .99 patch level 13,
and the shared libraries have been upgraded to version 4.4.2 alpha. I
know I said I wasn't going to do that, but I'm giving in. I'll replace
these with the official versions as soon as they are released. The 
keyboard utilities have been upgraded to version 0.81, and several new
keyboard maps are included.

The new package "shlibs.tgz" cannot be upgraded using pkgtool. If you
wish to upgrade an existing system, do the following:

Put "shlibs.tgz" in your root directory.
Boot the bootdisk, and mount your root partition under /root.
rm /root/lib/libc.so.*
rm /root/lib/libm.so.*
cd /root
zcat shlibs.tgz | tar xvf -

Reboot, and you'll be all set.

I had the same problem yesterday (with SLS-1.03). Create a directory
/var/spool/lpd, and edit the /etc/printcap file to be correct. Mine
had an open entry for a hp Laserjet (which is ok for me), but the
"of=" entry is wrong (there is no output filter there, remove this entry)
and better set "sd=/var/spool/lpd" and "lf=/var/spool/lpd/lpd.log".
After that lpd should come up, and could be enabled with the lpc commands.

There is unfortunately not printcap(5) man page, but as an old 386bsd hacker,
I got one from there.

RTF FAQ! (Enclosed clipping for your benefit.)
===================
Question 4.3.  How can I have more than 16Mb of swap ?

You have to set up more than one swap partition or swapfile.  Linux only
supports swap area sizes up to 16Mb, but you can set up and configure
several swap areas and Linux will use them all.

Reply-To: ptrouton@bfsec.bt.co.uk

Please help. I am using Linux and gcc. I also have dbg and xxxdbg. My problem is this
I have a program that uses doubles, I can compile the code, but when I run the
program it crashes giving the error
program received signal 8, floating point exception error

When I got my setup it said

HOSTTYPE=i386

I am running Linux on a 486DX/33, it was installed on this machine.

I am certain that the program core's because it cannot use the maths co-pro on the 486, because it is in i386 mode.

How can I fix this, how can I set the HOSTTYPE to 486.

Also where can I get PS docs for gcc, dbg and xxxdbg, or even books on these programs.

I have tried everything, but nothing helps. Please help. ASAP.

Thanks in advance Paul...

I've just moved up from 10 to 12 (10 was very stable - only 1 unexplained

are supposed to improve, but I have locked it up several times in a few weeks,

Me too. But it's an ET3000, and even root hangs (though less frequent).
Strange enough, this doesn't seem to happen with my old 99pl8 Image.
Has anyone ever tried other kernels ? Maybe pl13A ?

Egads!  And I even checked for updates before reinstalling last night!

Oh well.  Here are some Obligatory Cleanups for slackware103:

        /etc/rc.local looks for /etc/syslog[dk],
        which are actually located in /usr/bin, so they never run.

        Also, some of the commented out examples in syslog.conf
        do not actually work when uncommented..

        There are still many duplicated man pages in /usr/man/cat1,
        mostly of the form:   xclock.1.z  xclock.1x.z

        There are several games manpages in /usr/man/cat1 that
        really belong in (and are formatted for) /usr/man/cat6

        Not all of the /usr/man/{cat[0-9],man[0-9]} dirs are created.

Sorry, but thats just wrong. Of course both adaptors are SCSI-2. Sorry again.
To prevent being flamed I'll withdraw my stupid statement

One of the main differences between B and C is the SCSI select feature which
can entered during boot time by just pressing Ctrl-A. This feature allows you to 
modify the settings of the card (e.g. disabling the host bus termination, 
selecting the DMA transfer rate, testing the bus, and a lot more) without
changing any jumpers and without the need of any other utility progs.

Actually the 1542C allows a slighty higher DMA transfer rate (10 Mb/s instead
of 8 Mb/s) but this feature is only of theoretical use, because the bus is 
not affected - the recommend setting for most hardware combinations is still 5 Mb/s.

I suppose you could qualify this as a help request.
Under DOS, I can move 45 Meg between partitions in about 18 seconds
with a HP SCSI disk, and an Adaptec 1542. Not bad - quite happy in fact.

Under linux I moved 200 Meg between partitions the other night in just
under 30 MINUTES. Do the calcuations, is there something major I've
done wrong. I'm running pl12 at the moment on a 486-50 - with 8 meg of
RAM. When I reboot, I should have pl13 running.

I have a similar problem. 
I'm trying to compile perl5alpha under linux (only guaranteed to work
on sun sparc ;) And any time (all the time) it tries to coerce a
double to a (long) int it generates an FPE.

Is this an interaction between gcc * the fpu? is their a switch to fix
it?
