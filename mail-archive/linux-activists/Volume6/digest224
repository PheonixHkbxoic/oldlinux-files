The hard disc driver disables interrupts while it transfers a sector's
worth of data to the disc controller, using a rep outsb instruction. If
your hard disc controller is on the ISA bus (as most of them are), this
can cause overruns on machines without 16550 serial chips. The best fix
is to replace your serial chip with a 16550. If you can't do this (I can't
since my machine is a notebook with no expansion slots and an VLSI do-it-all 
chip that emulates 16450s).
Disc writes, particularly sync calls, seem to cause overruns more than
reads do. If you are feeling brave, you can modify the source of hd.c
to enable interrupts during the transfer (further disc interrupts are
already disabled in the 8259). Find the occurences of port_read() and
port_write() in linux/kernel/blk_drv/hd.c. Add an sti() call before
each one, and for those calls which are not immediately followed by
an sti(), add a cli() call just after the port_read/port_write.

Warning:
I've been using these patches for a few months now without incident.
However, Linus posted the following comment in re. these patches:

So if you want to try this, *back up your system* and be sure you
are running e2fsck on bootup, using bootutils etc.

Subject: Linux's HD.C -- good idea to modify to allow >16h?
Date: 13 Sep 93 00:42:43 GMT

Hello, Everyone!

I'm having a *very* annoying problem.  I'm rather tired of having to search for
& boot off of a floppy every time I want to start Linux.  (My hard drive
geometry disallows LILO, and nothing better has come along, including bootlin).
When I set my translation (ESDI ctrllr) to full translation, I can only get one
option: 64 heads.  HD.C chokes on this.  Someone a while back said that I ought
to just modify HD.C to recognize >16h.  Okay -- but will it work?  I rather
dislike the idea of backing up 400mb of DOS partitions to reformat the drive
and finding that it don't work. :-(

Any comments?

Yup. Did encounter this bug and fixed it myself.. :-)

Hope you did change "mke2fs" to "mke2fs -c" while editing your script, too!
(btw e2fsck on the boot disk won't be bad, too).

Ah. And if you're already in work to fix some bugs/misconfigured things you
can change the /etc/groups that root is not in more than 8 groups (otherwise
there are problems with NFS-mounting on at least a dos-box running SOSS).

Further. I don't think it is a good way to remove the /bin/mount in your
script for the bootutils while _this_ mount is able to "mount -t nfs ....".
The /etc/ mount which is left does NOT.

Ah, and setting up the path's in login.defs (or suchlike) to directories that
exist would be nice, too.

Again. Excuse my english and, well, "happy-fixing" :-)) (seems, there are
still some "steps" left to get a "real" difference to SLS, but, I
think/hope/guess you're on the right way. Go on!)

I'm not certain if it was from my mcc distribution,
but /usr/bin/man runs ( or rather ran ) sgid info
, from which a shell was possible.

Whilst not a huge hole, it was upsetting to see a user

        Hi;

  I would have sent you email, but your posting only has a mal-formed address so...

There is, or atleast was, a version of magic on sunsite. I couldn't
get it to work so I went and compiled it myself. There was very little
effort involved (remember to -DBSD -lbsd and _doprnt() was
missing). If you can't get sunsites package to work, I could bundle up
mine and send it to you.

Subject: How to make a bootable root on floppy?
Date: 13 Sep 93 04:56:26 GMT

Okay.  So I want to try making some changes to HD.C (so >16heads is allowed)
and compile a new kernal image.  I want to throw that onto a bootable
floppy and put the basic utils to set up Linux on my hard drive (fdisk,
mke2fs, gzip, tar, and so forth).  See, I can't use LILO unless I have full
translation on my controller enabled, but then HD.C won't recognize my hard
drive because it says it has 64 heads.

How do I do this?

I scanned through the Linux FAQs but I didn't see much besides making a boot
disk ... to boot to the HD.  Nothing about making a boot disk *and* making it
root.  I tried making a fs on a floppy (ext2) and copying the zImage to it,
with its root set to /dev/fd0, but it wouldn't boot.  So now what?

Thanks for any help!

Subject: S3 Video Chipset/Swapping Problems
Date: 13 Sep 1993 06:09:17 GMT


I just recently installed Linux and am enjoying it's use very
much!
However, I'm having a hell of a time with getting X to run like
I want it to.

I understand that X does not suppor the S3 video card, but is there
someone out there with a "driver" for this video card (for color)
Also, xterm allways quits out with a segmentation fault!
Any ideas?

And for the swapping problem:
I've got a 486-66 w/ 16mb RAM and a 5mb SWAP partition.  I had a background
script logging the /proc/meminfo every 5 seconds while I ran X and
loaded it up with those goofy games and whatnot. Eventually, no more windows
could be opened, and upon returning to the shell, I noticed that
ram used was near 16mb, while swap used was 0!!  It says that there is
5megs of swap, 0 used, 5megs free!  Why doesn't it use the swap device?
(Yes, it's mounted from fstab)

Any ideas or helpful hints would be greatly appreciated...

It's on sunsite and tsx-11, as maxima.tar.z.  It runs under clisp.  It is
only accidentally publically available -- you were supposed to send in a fee
(a hefty one) to a company.  Said company having closed its doors, the
software becomes available...

But it might not do everything
>you're looking for. 

I don't know what that might be, except graphics.  For that, use gnuplot.  But
maxima is a complete CAS package.  It has more on-line help than Mma (not that
that is saying much), and is at places more mathematically careful than Mma.
It is as easy to use as a non-gui Mathematica or Maple, is quite fast, and is
extensible (this may require considerable knowledge of lisp, though).

 I myself have sent e-mail to Wolfram asking them
>whether they'd be interested in a port to Linux or 386bsd, and they

That is SOP

Someone told me that NeXT executables would run on Intel/NS?  There has 
been a NeXT Mma for years.  Will this not run under Intel/NS?

I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for linux Mathematica.  We have a much better
chance of seeing Maple.  They have a generic X11 interface, which Mma does not,
that is something akin to Mma's notebooks.  WRI has been promising notebooks
for Sun for a year or so.  Are they out?  But Maple has a nice gui for X.
Current one is Motif, though...

VERSION: 0.6                                               DATE: 01 Aug 93


Note:  This list was originally posted by who-knows?  I don't remember, and
I haven't seen it in a while, so I'll take the responsibility of maintaining
this list.  Please send your hardware (in)compatibility lists to erc@apple.com.
PLEASE put the word "HARDWARE" in your subject line IN CAPS!
================================= cut here ===================================
     Welcome to the Linux Hardware Compatibility List.  It is my hope that
this will be of help to people and that it will do away with a lot of the
"Will XXX work with my System?" questions.  I also hope that this will help
people who want to buy a system to run Linux or are in the process of
upgrading their system and want to make sure that the hardware they buy is
compatible with Linux (especially for item's such as SCSI controller's and
CD-ROM's, and video cards for X).
        Please be aware that the list NO LONGER contains X hardware
specifics.  These will be posted as a seperate listing.(along with 
clocks, settings, etc.)
        People who have emailed me (erc@apple.com) about specific pieces
of hardware that they've gotten to work have their name and email address
printed alongside.  This is to help others who are having difficulty get
help directly from the guilty party. ;)

     If you are wondering about a specific piece of Hardware and you don't
find it in this list all I can say is I don't know at this time but as soon
as I find out it will be in the next list.  If you find out that it work's
from some other source, i.e. a friend or trying it out, PLEASE let me know.
Also even though a piece of equipment is on this system doesn't mean that I
know how to get it to work with Linux, it is on this list because someone
has told me that it works on THEIR system. So if it is on the list and
you can't make it work, it sounds like a good time to, in order, do:

        1) read ALL the faq's
        2) read comp.os.linux, and scan the subjects for your XXX
        3) email the person listed here who says it works (if any)
        3) post AFTER READING comp.os.linux and c.o.l.announce.

    Thanks to everyone that has helped and sent info this list,it  is a lot 
better because of their help!

INCOMPATIBILITIES
=================

From: mow@marsu.tynet.sub.org

The ProAudio Spectrum 16 does not work properly in combination
with the Adaptec 1542B. This is due to both card's busmastering
feature. NeXTSTEP/Intel even crashes with this configuration.

Hi There!

There's a Program called muPAD from the university of Paderborn
in Germany which does not only behave (roughly) as a MAPLE clone,
but is intended to be used either on parallel machines (sequent, I think),
or to simulate parallel network topologies on sequential machines.
It is available for SunOS/OW, for Linux and for Macintoshes.
It is distributed *for free* to educational institutions.

As far as I know, you can ask for a registration form from:
MuPAD-distribution@uni-paderborn.de.

Hope this helps,

Maximilian
