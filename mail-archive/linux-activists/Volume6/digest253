Dear friends,

   (1) I cannot use "df"
   (2) While I run X, the following message appeared:

Reply-To: mitchell@sosc1.sosc.osshe.edu

As a follow up to my last note, I wanted to let folks know that setting
the irq to irq5 fixed the conflict with cua1. Apparently the autoprobe
for the 3c503 took irq 3 as the interrupt even though com2 existed. 
Unfortunately, irq 5 conflicts with the qic02 stuff, so I had to reconfigure
the kernel so it wouldn't use qic and now both com2 and the 3c503 card
work.... but the question remains: Do I have to recompile the entire
kernel each time I make a minor change?

This may not be much of an answer to you, but I suggest trying the MCC
boot/install disk.  I have a 14FB and have had no problems with MCC-Interim.

If MCC doesn't see your adapter with default factory settings (which I'm
using as I type [except for the transfer speed, which I upped a bit]), 
then you should ask for help from one of the scsi gurus again, 'cause
I'm not one of them.

hope this helps...

You do have to configure it in... while doing make config, answer yes
to the seagate st/01 controller option.  Note that the 16x0 does *not* 
use the future domain driver, but the seagate one.  If after installing
the kernel with this enabled and booting it still won't find your
card/drives, you may need to set some overrides in kernel/blk_drv/seagate.c.
It's well commented.  And it _does_ work, I have a 1680 with no rom on
it and it works like a charm.  Well, an 8 bit charm, but nonetheless...

I've been using linux for about 6 mos. now, just a basic setup:  386/486,
Tseng4k video, 325 megs Hd, 8M R, and your basic 24-pin dot-matrix.  I
don't have a lot of experience with Laser Printers and the likes, but was
thinking of upgrading to an HP LJ 4L.  Would I be able to still send data
to /dev/lp and have it print?  Do I need to compile special drivers into
the kernel (In the two-dozen or so odd kernel compiles, I recall nothing
along the lines of such)?  Basically, will I be able to create
documents/graphics, etc under linux and print them under linux, or will I
need to go to a msdos environment to print the data created under linux? 
The info on the printer that [may] be relevent:  26 scalables, 300dpi
w/RHT and mft, PCL 5, 1Meg w/HP MET, etc.  I don't know what half of it
means, but since this is comp.os.linux, I'm just asking if it'll run with
linux(though an emailed reply from some laserprinter knowlegable person
that explained some of the specs. would be greatly appreciated :).  So,
WILL it in fact run w/o massive modification?  Any info would be
appreciated very much,
                        Thanks,

Subject: [Help] Invalid partition table message at boot
Date: 23 Sep 1993 05:40:35 GMT


   Somehow, I scrapped my partition table with Linux' fdisk. (I think)
Details below.  (Please respond in email.)  Thank you.

   I first installed Linux on my drive (that is brand new) like this:

/dev/hda1       10M       Linux swap
/dev/hda2      115M       Linux extfs   (ext2fs actually)

   I successfully mkswap'ed and mke2fs'ed these two.  Then I made a new
partition, for the remaining size of the drive:

/dev/hda3      200M       Linux extfs   (ext2fs again)

   I had problems mke2fs'ing it, so I went back to fdisk, deleted the
partition.  Instead of typing "n" for a new partition, I typed "a" with
the partition #3.  I was told that this was an empty partition.
Eventually, I figured out that I was typing "a" (for add) instead of "n".
I then rebooted, and it told me, before the LILO prompt:

Invalid partition table

   And hung up there.  I have to boot with my floppy disk.

   When I couldn't make it work, I decided to re-install Linux from
my SLS 1.03 distribution.  After going through the main system (series
a, b & c), it told me the same message.  I tried the FIX-TABLE and the
IGNORE-TABLE lines in /etc/lilo/config (and then lilo'e it), to no
avail.

   Both MS-DOS' and Linux' fdisks read the partition table information
fine...  On my new configuration, I now have only two partitions, having
merged the 115M and 200M ones.

   Can anyone help?  Please reply by email.

I just installed Linux on my computer and I have set up X.
I would like to set up some users on my system, but when 
use the command "adduser -m User" the directories are created,
and the . files are transfered to the directory.  I chmod my
home directory to 755 and chown the directory so the owner is
User.  I also chmod this directory to 744 .  The problem is
that unless I am logged in as the root user I cannot write to my
directory.  I cannot write anything whatsoever.  I also tried making
home and the user directories 777 just to see if that would work,  No
such luck.  I am stumped , I read the linux Faq and all I can find is 
what I should do to chown and chmod directories and files.  I hace
not found anything to explain my situation.  Some help on this would
be greatly appreciated.  Thank you !!!

Has anyone already ported the PHIGS package (comes with X11R5) to Linux?
I have to use it for a graduating project, but I'd like to be able to 
do some work at home to. 
I've noticed that the Linux X-server already supports PEX, but the library
containing the PHIGS-extensions (libphigs.a) isn't on the distribution disks.

There is a version of PHIGS (called UIPEX), that promises a near complete 
version of PHIGS but I can't get the makefile working (I think this has some-
thing to do with the differences between GNU-make and the standard UNIX-make).

Any help, hints, tips etc will be greatly appreciated.

As far as I know there is an drive for floppy tape streamers

As an aside I would like to say that we should not talk fo

The signal interface is defined in (QIC-117 - hope that's right,
i don't have my QIC interface list at hand). 

For the same reason you talk of QIC-02 interfaces and not of
QIC-24, QIC-150 and so on. I'am not even sure wether the floppy
tape drive uses the QIC-80 format - to me it would not make sense
because - for backup purposes - QIC-80 is overspecified.
