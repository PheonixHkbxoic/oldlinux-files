First of all, I have not had the problem you describe. The fdisk used on
the Slackware bootdisk is one I compiled from the latest sources in
/pub/linux/sources/sbin on tsx-11.mit.edu. It is version 1.4, and is
newer than the ones I've seen with SLS (I think it uses fdisk 1.1
alpha). 

Have other people experienced trouble with this version of fdisk?

Subject: linux/mgetty again...
Date: Wed, 15 Sep 1993 08:06:53 GMT

  Sorry to return back to this topic, but I still have some small problems
with mgetty/sendfax.

  I am using the ACEEX 1496 faxmodem under Linux .99.8 and mgetty/sendfax
0.13. After enforcing the hardware flow control (mapping the ioctl calls to
tc{get,set}attr), sending faxes is working perfectly. The only problem is
faxrec. The received faxes are legible (somehow), but many lines are corrupted;
even g3topbm reports a problem of premature EOF, so I had to hack it in order
to get something at least. I fear the problem might still be the flow control,
but dunno...

  Another surprising fact is that sending a fax at 14400 bps sendfax consumes
only about 10% CPU (80386, 33 MHz), whereas receiving at 9600 mgetty consumes
something in the region 70-95 % CPU !! I seem to have noticed that even during
the fax receive, OPOST and OCRNL are active; is it quite OK?

  Would appreciate any hint, thanks in advance,

Reply-To: tqh@elctr.dk

Dear all, 

Forgive me if this is a wrong place. I don't know other places to turn
to. I got SLS 1.03 (with linux 99p12 I think) and succeeded in installing
the base system. But when I tried to boot from the generated bootdisk, the
computer either dies or reboots. I have tries to reinstall several
times, the result remains the same.
 
I could boot from the hard disk after having changed the active partition
to LINUX partition, but this is not a convenient way to switch between DOS
and LINUX.
 
My system is a 386DX/33 with 8M RAM and 130M hard disk partitioned into:

        partition 1 (/dev/hda1) is DOS partition.
        partition 2 (/dev/hda2) is LINUX with extended file system
        partirion 3 (/dev/hda3) is secondary partition with:
           partirion 5 (</dev/hda5 ) is DOS
           partition 6 ( /dev/hda6>) is another LINUX partition mounted
                                     on /home 
 
I didn't have problem with earlier releases of SLS. I understand that the
LILO is now built in in the installation program (please correct me if I
am wrong) and one step of installation is to modify the DOS boot sector to
add LINUX and DOS (I replied "/dev/hda1" to this step). This step wasn't
there in earlier releases.
 
Did I do anything wrong? Advices and hints are greatly appreciated.
Please answer directly to me by e-mail as I'm not a subscriber of this
discussion group. Thank you for your patience.
 
Best regards

I need help with setting up my printer.

I have read the Print-FAQ but to no avail. If you can help, please do.

my printer is Panasonic KXP-1024i
I am using SLS 1.03 release on a 486
Standard i/o, in DOS printer is LPT1:

I have created the var/spool/lpd dir
My device is dev/lp1
I have setup etc/printcap for the panasonic.

I get the message 
        jobs queued, but cannot start deamon

If I lpq I can see the file queued.

=====

More info: I am a localhost 127.0.0.1 hostname icrus.

===============

I have messed around with many different setup's to try to get it to work, but as of yet to no good. I notice that the Print-FAQ differes in its method of setup of the printer, that the SLS instructions. I also noticed that the method of setting up the network is different in SLS that the FAQ & HOWTO sheets. I used the FAQ and HOWTO information to setup my network and host names, PID etc etc.

I have a hunch that my problem may lie in the network setup, and I have spent more time with the network and host setup, but still to no good.

So please if you can help. please do.

Thanks in advance Paul.

Subject: Re: UUCP now works! (was: UUCP uid (was: UUCP on SLS 1.03))
Date: Wed, 15 Sep 1993 12:27:50 GMT

After tinkering around with some settings, I got UUCP to work
properly!

Previously I wrote...

   ...It seems that ownership of the UUCP files (in /usr/lib/uucp,
   especially) has to be set to uid 11, the default uid set by Linux
   during installation.  (Uid 11 is not in the installed passwd or group
   files.)  I was setting the ownership to "uucp" (uid = 5, I think)
   which should work but I think that I may have to set (haven't tried
   this yet!) the ownership of several of the UUCp executables, (e.g. cu,
   uuname, etc. in /usr/bin), from uid 11 to "uucp" too.

I set the ownership of several files in /usr/bin to uucp (they were
originally set to uid 11).  These files are:

-r-sr-xr-x   1 uucp     root       123908 Mar 24 08:01 cu
-r-sr-xr-x   1 uucp     uucp        87044 Mar 24 08:01 uucp
-r-sr-xr-x   1 uucp     uucp        37892 Mar 24 08:01 uuname
-r-sr-xr-x   1 uucp     uucp        99332 Mar 24 08:01 uustat
-r-sr-xr-x   1 uucp     uucp        87044 Mar 24 08:01 uux

Then I set the ownership of all the files in /usr/lib/uucp to uucp
(from uid 11).  Similarly in /usr/spool/uucp, I change the ownership
of every file and directory with uid 11 to uucp.  Everything (except
dialin; I'm still working on that :-) works like mint now.  Thanks to
all for your comments, suggestions, and conjectures. :-)

   However there are still some workarounds needed:
   1) I have to use -x with a level of 2 and above to get uucico to
      actually dial out.  If I don't use -x or use -x1, the modem will
      not dial out even though two lights on Hayes Smartmodem (forgot the
      names for the lights but it is the 3rd and 4th lights from the
      right).  Interestingly they are the same set of lights that flicker
      a lot when I don't use the -r flag for getty or uugetty for the 
      modem line (cua1).

This problem went away when I followed up on two person's suspicions
(including Ian Taylor's; thanks guys) that there may be some delay
problem.  The -x flag slows things down.  So I inserted a couple of
delay in the right entry of the /usr/lib/uucp/Devices file.  To be
safe I added an entry for wlimhayes in that file:

hayes      =,-, "" \dAT\r\c OK\r \EATDT\T\r\c CONNECT             # (original)
wlimhayes  =,-, "" \dAT\r\c\d OK\r \EATDT\T\r\c\d CONNECT         # (mine)
                            |                   |
                           delay               delay

I didn't play around to figure if I really need both delays or which
is the critical one.  Anyway, after that "uucico -f" and "uucico -r1"
work beautifully.

   2) I have to occassionally delete the audit.local file otherwise
      uucico will not dial out.  I don't know why.  Perhaps it has
      something to do with the file size???

This problem goes away once I avoided using the -x flag for uucico
since the audit.local files doesn't get created then.  For those who
asked, the last time I noticed the problem is when the file size for
audit.local was about 24k-25k. It went away when I deleted or moved
that file.

I hope this will help others to get their Linux uucp connection working.

Version 1.0.3 of the Slackware Linux distribution may be found on
ftp.cdrom.com in directory /pub/linux/slackware, or
/pub/linux/zooed_slackware. 

This is primarily a maintenance release incorporating suggestions and
bug fixes mailed in or discussed in comp.os.linux.*.

The most interesting new features are the Pine mailer, svgalib v.0.7,
man/xman patched to comprehend .z, .gz, and .Z extensions in the cat 
directories, and groff v. 1.08.

As far as the rest of the release, basically if you sent your bug report
in to me (or posted it) since the release of 1.0.2, it should be fixed
now, although there always seem to be more :^)

Thanks to everyone who sent in suggestions, bug reports, diffs, etc.
You've made the rapid debugging of this release possible.

No trouble, but it sure does whine and complain a lot!

My drive pretends to have 2034 cylinders, and fdisk 1.4 gives repeated
warnings about logical.ne.physical parameters for partitions above the
invisible 1024cyl "barrier".  If I didn't know better (and I do), I'd panic
and wonder what to do to use a disk over 1024cyl.  Perhaps we should get
the maintainer of fdisk1.4 to add a check to remove those warnings for linux
native partitions, possibly replacing them by a more sensible "note" about
bootable kernel images having to reside within the first 1024cyls.

Simon "Guru Aleph-Null" Janes (<spj@ukelele.gcr.com>) asked

The only thing I found was a bad (probably old) copy of
the latex.fmt file, which holds the compiled basic
commands of the LaTeX language.

But, you have all the source code available, so if you
just run something like 
`initex lplain \dump',
you will get a -- correct -- new latex.fmt (or lplain.fmt,
which you probably have to rename or so).

I'm not precise about it, because I am talking from my head.

Currently, Novell (e.g. USL) has UNIXWARE Personal Edition for $495 retail with
the TCP/IP module.  Novell will be releasing UNIXWARE bundled with the
TCP/IP module (whereas currently you have to get the module as an addon).
UNIXWARE inherently has IPX protocol support.

If you just want FTP support to/from the NetWare server, then Novell
FleX/IP offers this plus NetWare printer support for UNIX.  It costs
around $600-700 and does work with NetWare 4.01 (not using NDS though).
This is a NLM that runs on the server.

If you want NFS support, then the Novell NetWare NFS (not NFS Gateway)
will allow UNIX users to view NetWare volumes as UNIX file systems.
This also has FTP support.  And yes, it's not cheap, but you do get the
complete NFS functionality.

I have also heard that there are third-party shareware products that perform
similar functions as stated above, but I do not have personal experience in
their performance and reliability.
