I'm running 2 IDE disks off one IDE interface, and I've not had any
trouble so far.  If the disks are of different makes, then you may want
to get the hard disk data file from comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware -- it covers
nearly everything you could want to know about chaining two IDE drives
together.  Setting master/slave links can be fun.  I can e-mail you an
old copy of the file if you need it.

On the other hand, if you want to use to disks on two separate IDE cards,
then I think you need some kernel patches.  I can't be sure, but I think
you'll find what you need in the ``atdisk'' package.

James.

I have gnuplot running fine. It works in dumb terminal mode, - I can
run through the whole of all.demo just fine. When I run it under X, it
hangs my machine when it gets to the second sync function example.

The machine continues to sync (sorry for the confusion) the disk OK, so 
I actually haven't lost any data (yet) by resetting.

What's worse (in a sense) is that the X screensavers do it too 8-( .

(doc also does it, - I mentioned this in a previous posting but no-one 
replied...)

After some time when they've been running happily, - hang. -> RESET!

Running: 386DX 20MHz 8Mb mem, ULSI 387 Co-pro (I did wonder if it was
this....?) Slackware, pl12 + Linus' patch kernel, IDE drivers in, SLIP in.

I'm quite prepared to re-build the kernel with some alteration, - no 
problem since I've done it several times. Or, is it a shared library problem
or some such? (I went straight for the Slackware pl12a dist'n then to the pl12
kernel some days later and then applied Linus' patch. I've added SLIP since
and taken out SCSI support for the time being.)

Help?

Keep up the very good work everyone!

I am running Linux at home on a 486. I have access through work to Email and Internet
News. I love these two services very much and am afraid of loosing them if I changed my job. For this reason I am considering buying a modem and working from home. My idea
is this. If I was allowed to keep my account at work, could I forward my mail and news to home. Should I do this by simply downloading mail etc at night, or would it be better to put in a line, with a modem and keep it on line.

Is there such a thing as a modem that I can leave on and that will store Email and other info, without the computer having to be on.

Could you reccommend a modem for use with linux at home. I need Email and internet services.

Can I get an internet number for use with FTP? is it costly? is it possible?

Can my account in work forward News to my home address? Or will I have to log into work and read news online?

If I loose my account in work, where else can I log onto to get access to internet News without having to pay a fortune for the service.

In Brief I want help on what hardware and software I need to be able to use FTP, EMAIL and Internet News facilities at home. 


Thanks in advance Paul...

Subject: printing & BogoMips
Date: 09 Sep 93 05:53:29 GMT

Two completely unrelated questions:

1.  I have not been able to get lpr,lpd,etc to work right.
/usr/spool/lpd
/usr/spool/lp1
/dev/lp1 is linked to /dev/printer ( actually, the reverse is true )
lpd starts and stays running from my rc.local script
lpc says all is well, things get queued, no daemon present
lpc start, stop, up, down all produce expected results, except for the
'no daemon present' comment.

I have tried everything I've read here to get it to work.  I can call:
print /etc/gettydefs
and ir works just fine, but nothing gets printed with
lpr /etc/gettydefs

Any more hints?

2.  What is a BogoMip?  My compiles ( kernel) take forever.
I have a 386DX33 with 16 Mb, two 210 Mb IDE Drives, two 10 Mb swaps.
And of course, '5.86 BogoMips' - is this a reasonable number?

Thanks,

> 2.  What is a BogoMip?

MIPS is short for Millions of Instructions Per Second.  It is a
measure for the computation speed of a program.  Like most such
measures, it is more often abused than used properly (it is very
difficult to justly compare MIPS for different kinds of computers).

BogoMips are Linus's invention.  The kernel (or was it a device
driver?) needs a timing loop (the time is too short and/or needs to be
too exact for a non-busy-loop method of waiting), which must be
calibrated to the processor speed of the machine.  Hence, the kernel
measures at boot time how fast a certain kind of busy loop runs on a
computer.  "Bogo" comes from "bogus", i.e, something which is a fake.
(See the Jargon File for more information.)  Hence, the BogoMips value
gives some indication of the processor speed, but it is way too
unscientific to be called anything but BogoMips.

The reasons (there are two) it is printed during bootup is that a) it
is slightly useful for debugging and for checking that the computers
caches and turbo button work, and b) Linus loves to chuckle when he
sees confused people on the news.

My machine is 386DX33, 8 MB, 64 kB memory cache, 109 MB IDE, 12 MB
swap partition, about 5.99 BogoMips.  I think your BogoMips sound
reasonable.  

What is "forever"?  My kernel compiles take around 20 min (depending
on configuration options), when not running anything else (i.e., no
X).  If yours are significantly slower, there might be something wrong
in your setup.  Are your swaps files or partitions?  Partitions are
much faster.

OS9 is _not_ a Unix clone. OS9 is a small very neat modular real time OS.
It just happens to be a nice multi-user environment on tiny computers too.

Linux supports most common sound cards and several CD-ROM drives (like the
Mitsumi). There are programs like workman for playing audio CD's. THere is
also an MPEG player (mpeg_play) available for X windows, although this likes
a fast video card, a fastish computer and preferably the X server reconfigured
for shared memory buffer support. The mpeg player doesn't yet support combined
audio/video playing.

Unlike MS-Windows Linux supports tcp/ip based network audio - so you can play
sounds from remote hosts (rplay) and you can play mpeg movies across the network
(clobbers the network bandwidth 8-)).

It's not yet a nice integrated piece but the bits are all there.

Its probably worth answering this as an article rather than by mail

PhotoCD is an unpublished secret format protected in the US by countless
software patents and squads of lawyers. There is nothing actually special
about reading photo-cd disks so long as you have a multi-session cd-rom.
Unfortunately to produce photo-cd software you have to license it all and
sign an NDA.

Now as it happens if you look on alt.sources archives you'll find a 
preproduction photo-cd reader for various systems, which should port
to Linux.

The hardware is pretty much the same as on 386 systems (which is why a
lot of motherboards let you plug in a 386 or 486 these days).  Local bus
should speed up disk access (esp with scsi) and video access, but you
can get local bus for 386 machines as well.

I agree with the above statement that you really don't need a 486 (I
used to run bsd on a 386dx/16 with a 387 very happily, but wanted more
memory which meant buying a new motherboard, so I got a 486sx).

On the other hand with MB prices being so low these days (about a $30
difference between a 386/33 and a 486sx/25) why not just buy the 486...

I said a 486 wasn't that vital talking on CPU grounds. I've not run a local
bus machine, but faster video card and disk driving would be a huge asset.
Yes it probably is a very good argument.

A 4MB 286 might serve as an low-end X-terminal.

I've been told that GCC is able to compile for 16-bit target

The cheap QIC-80 hardware reportedly needs such strange methods of timing.
