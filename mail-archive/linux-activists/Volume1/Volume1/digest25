From the 16k ROM I suppose you have a ST-02. Well, drew
is supposed to be working on that one, but in case nothing
happens, I have sources for a ST-0X driver for Interactive
Unix which could (easily?) be adapted to Linux.

To the question of why none is available: The only thing
that gets available is the things people write, and since
noone (yet?) has written a ST-02 driver, such a beast is
not available.

"SCSI drivers" is really not one thing. There are several
different SCSI *Adapters* available.

The subject refers to the greeting I was given this morning.  I gave a copy
of the linux root and boot disks to a Viglen 386 owner and this was his 
opinion.

What happens is when his machine is booted from floppy (5 1/4") he gets
the SVGA options ok, can select one of two modes (I assume only to as
he only has 256K RAM on his svga card).  Then once the root disk is mounted
he gets a continuous;

scrolling up the screen. I assume this means linux is reading EOF from the
keyboard.  Anyone else seen this? any ideas why this machine might be 
incompatable?

Yes: I don't like it.  Under linux nothing is loaded at an "exec()", and
every bit of the executable is demand-loaded, so anything which tries to
compress executables is in trouble.  Not worth the trouble: it could be
done by exec loading the complete executable and uncompressing it, but
that would mean that demand-loading wouldn't work for that process: not
nice.  Demand-loading is an integral part of the memory management, and
helps to reduce swap-space need (no need to swap executable pages out:
they can just be re-demand-loaded).

Subject: Experiences with Linux: User's Report
Date: 29 Jan 92 13:55:38 GMT

These are my experiences with Linux after working with it for about a week.
I thought it might be valuable for the people developing it to hear, and
thereis a question or two at the end.
 
The machine is a Toshiba laptop, 386DX-25 with only 2 meg of memory, and
a 40 meg hard drive. Two partitions, 32 meg root and 8 meg swap. 

Seems like everything works fine after the first couple of tries figuring
it out. I managed to download, make floppies, install on hard drive, and 
yesterday, I rebuilt the kernal four times. Yep, with only a 2 meg machine,
swapping allowed me to rebuild the kernel with gcc. It was kinda pokey,
put it wasn't so slow that it was unbearable. I've seen worse.
 
The first time was just to see if I could do it. The second time was to change
my keyboard back to US since I booted up with a Finnish keyboard after making
the first kernal! The third time, I added the patches for the rename() syscall,
and moving directories worked just fine. Then the fourth time I added in the
new floppy driver, and it worked fine. "dd if=Image of=/dev/dosA" took 47 
seconds before, and 25 after putting the floppy driver in. Reads from a 
tar file on a floppy are about twice as fast as well.
All in all, I'm wholly satisfied with linux and would buy it (if It wasn' t
free.)

Now the questions: Why is linux around? Is it just an exercise in writing
an operating system, for educational use only, or do Linus & co. want to
write a "real", general-purpose, every-day-use operating system? 
 
On the educational note: I'm reading and playing with the kernel source. 
Am I learning things valuable if I were to go out and work with other OS's,
or is linux done in a way that no other operating systems are done? 
 
Thanks,

If you ftp from banjo.concert.net, all you have to do to get the entire thing
(or any part there-of) is cd to the right place, then say "get dirname.tar"
and it will automagically create a tar file of just what you want.. then you

tarred and compressed (16 bits)...

Subject: Patches for "lp" device.

Reply-To: ramesh@utdallas.edu


Yesterday, I got the lp patches from tsx-11.mit.edu and applied them to kernel
and tried compiling. Sad, it didn't (should I say I couldn't get it to) work.
First patch complained that it couldn't patch my Makefile in kernel/chr_drv
directory. I hand patched the Makefile and summoned make at /usr/src/linux.
But gcc complained about missing checkpoint.h in lp.h and some other file.
I looked for it carefully (i.e., did a tar tf on the lp patch again) and it
wasn't there. So I just commented it out!! and that worked !!!!!!!!!!!!!
But, the new kernel does not have anything different. No lp device?????
(Oh yes, I made the /dev/lp? with c 6 [0-2] as suggested). Please can some one
tell me what went wrong? I am quite frustrated at this point.

Now my question is: has this patch been tested already? Does this work?
what is "checkpoint.h" and where is it? Shouldn't a patch be complete/tested?
Could the ftp site managers make things clear whether patches are tested or
not? 

No, I am not flaming here, I am just asking whether things can be improved.
In particular, I would like certain organized approach to
supplying patches and making them available at ftp sites as naturally one
assumes certain level of correctness with patches especially when available
from an established ftp site. 

I apologize if I had been unnecessarily caustic. I assure you my intentions
are to be constructive only.

I have now solved this it would seam by reformating the floppy in a DOS5.0
machine and rewiting it with rawrite. The only reason I can think of is
that the disk was originally formatted under DOS3.2?

I have a Viglen 386 (Vig III/25, 5 1/4" drive A, 8Mb, Paradise graphics card),
and it works fine. Maybe there is a problem with the disks?

By the way, if anyone out there could give me any pointers as to how to start
writing a device driver for my tape drive (I think its a Tapeguard 927-T or
something) it would be greatly appreciated. I can currently back up my drive 
by using the 'backup image' option from the DOS driver, but this means I still
have to use DOS to back up my disk and it requires two tapes to do a complete
backup.

Thanks,
        Simon.

I agree. Broken software should be fixed -- not expect the environment
to save it. Actually, in the long run we're better of if the

Well, I successfully rebuilt the kernel on a 1M machine which had the

2M machine with a 20M swap partition (I know, a little large) and the

I am the author of this version of malloc(), and this was precisely
my reasoning when I made this decision.  Incidentally, it has caught
a number of bugs in programs that were calling malloc(0) when they
really didn't want to (including the binutils, of course).  So I feel
the decision has vindicated itself.

The only reason ever to change that behavior would be if, for some reason,
strict historical compatibility became an overwhelming priority (like if
you were compiling something whose source you couldn't change, for one
reason or another...)

I had this problem on my Commodire PC60 (386DX, 16MHz), and in the course of
re-installing, I forgot to sync and rebooted. It worked fine. The only thing
that was missing was /usr/root, and the two files in that. Tell him to re-
install and as soon as the files are on the HD reboot without syncing.

Secondly, we've installed Linux on a Viglen 386-16 with 3Mb of RAM and it works
fine, so I don't think it's machine types (ours are sl3-sx's)

WPI has not been recieving news for a while, I finally got tired of waiting
and signed up for the digest.

There turned out to be a problem with the original fd.tar.Z I uploaded, 
since then I've uploaded fpatch.tar.Z which contains patchs for the 
kernel files that need to be changed (if your starting from 0.12), and
has a copy of the new floppy.c if you already installed the old changes.
It seems to work fine on a single floppy drive but does have problems
when two floppy drives are used, I gave the patch to Linus to put in 0.13
and hopefully he will be able to fix the multifloppy problem (I only have one
floppy drive).
The patchs let you read floppies about 5 times faster, format floppies and
fixs the return value for end of device so that multivolume untars work.

Does any one know if there is a reason for the limitation of 65535 blocks
per file system? I have a 120meg drive and would like to be able to use the
whole thing at once.

TCP/IP:
 I've started digging through the BSD code and it looks like things have come
 full circle, the socket structure are used all the way into the lowest levels
 which kind of kills the idea of a simpler interface, unless I rewrite totally
 from scratch. Although I liked the idea of a seperate process it looks
 totally impractical after taking a closer look. A single block copy by the
 CPU is not much faster than the ethernet throughput, having to make multiple
 copies back and forth between kernel and user space would make it impossible 
 to handle even a fraction of the throughput available. I'm still a little
 worried about the BSD code, although I assume it has worked ok on things much
 slower than 386's (Vaxen etc.), so hopefully those linked list searchs arn't
 as bad as they look :)
 What complaints do people have about the BSD TCP/IP code, I've been told it
 was messed up but wasn't given specifics.

Thank you so much for protecting me from this "error". I'll bet you saved
me at least 100 bytes of storage, and I only had to change 6 source files!

I guess you forgot that there's nothing wrong with asking for 0 bytes
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T TRY TO DEREFERENCE THE RESULTING POINTER.

I'm glad you didn't implement the close() system call. You might have
decided to "save" me an inode if I decided not to write any characters
to the file I open()'d.
