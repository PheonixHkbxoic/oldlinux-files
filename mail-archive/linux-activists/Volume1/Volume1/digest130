Date: 20 Mar 92 08:09:22 GMT

When I tried to install 0.95a on my machine last night, I couldn't
access my 2nd disk drive (where I keep my root partition). After
rebooting with 0.95 and fiddling around with the 0.95/0.95.a 
kernel/blk_drv/hd.c, I found that the function check_partition()
resets the sector count for device 0x0340 (i.e. hd[64].nr_sects)
to zero!

When I removed the new extended partition check (commented out
lines 97-102 in the 0.95a hd.c) and recompiled, the problem went away.

Has anyone similar experiences?

There is a ps095.tar.Z file, it's a patch that you have to apply to
the kernel. As it was for 0.95, the automatic patch doesn't work
completly, you have to "finish ny hand" the patch of mm/swap.c

I've done it. It works, it is well documented, enjoy

(you have to do tar xvofz ps095.tar.Z in /usr/src/linux (or whatever
place the kernel sources are kept)

Hope this helps.

Upgrade mount and umount to the 0.95(a) versions: the 0.12 version opens
/etc/mtab~ with O_CREAT | O_EXCL, but no O_WROLNY, so writing to the
file will fail (and mount doesn't check for it). The 0.12 kernel didn't
check for the open-mode when writing, so it worked for that, but 0.95a
does.

Actually, the PS/2 70's have MCA architecture (something I was delighted
with 3 years ago when I got it and have regretted ever since!  Especially
now with the proliferation of free UNIXes which only support AT-buses).
Just out of curiosity, what is your objection to the more rigid MCA bus
(here, alas, my ignorance shows).  Will that make porting more difficult?

Anyone want to buy an IBM PS/2 70 :)

Well, I just installed .95a today. I had been using .95 with no         
apparent problems. With .95a, all appears fine except my 2nd hard
drive has started making a continuous whining noise and the access
to it has slowed considerably. It sounds like it is in a constant       
seek mode. I put up with it for a while, but I eventually rebooted
with the .95 kernel and the drive is back to normal. Therefore, I
don't think it's my hardware.

I have:

Anyone else encountered this?? wierd....

Plase...
Somebody tell me how to make use of the folowing stuff.
I really would like all this stuff about video mode to end.
And the following article shows how. I just have no experience

Subject: 0.95a, some differences...

Machine:
386sx/16MHz
a: 1.2Mb
drive0: WD IDE 40Mb
drive1: WD IDE 40Mb
===================
drive1:
/dev/hdb  40Mb
/dev/hdb2 / (root) 4Mb
/dev/hdb3 /usr 29Mb
/dev/hdb4 /swap 8Mb
=========
The booting process on 0.95a is flawless from floppies.
I haven't yet changed the hex number to reflect root on /dev/hdb2.
(it is still set up for 0.12, and that floppy boot reads /dev/hdb2
okay, yet when I do that /dev/hdb3, /dev/hdb4 don't read, have bad
IO numbers, blank-o!).
Under 0.95a I can mount, read, etc. all /dev's on drive1 okay.
But I can't get mtools to work at all reading drive0. I even 
'mknod /dev/c b 3 1' (which is the correct, under 0.12, device for
reading my drive0 DOS hard drive). But in 0.95a it always reports
errors reading A:, and I can see it reading drive a: floppy.

I have some files on drive0 that I'd like to get to the drive1 Linux
partition, but can't get over to there with mtools anymore.
Any suggestions?
(they are filetar.Z files, I know that if I go back to DOS, back
to the comm program, back to the school unix/bsd, uncompress them,
download them as tar's, rawrite them to floppy a:, then get back
into Linux I can then copy them over with 'tar xvf /dev/at0').

I just booted up 0.95a on my 386 - 4mByte - AMI BIOS, and the old 0.12
loaded on the HD.  I did the /INSTALL/install to upgrade (great idea!!).
But when it all finished, writing any new file the date/time somehow
does not write properly in the INode table.  'ls -l' gives a date/time
of "??? ??? ?? ?? ??:??" (or something close.) But the date/time on old
files does show correctly.  Is this a feature! ? ( bug ?? ) or do I have
to rebuild the entire thing.

Another possibly related problem, I have an old program that called
time() (?) to give me a pause, but it just seems to loop forever now, it
does not wait the way it did on 0.12.

What's up? What's the cure??

     There are a TON of 386 PS/2s with an ISA bus... like the model 40

The FAQ is wrong, and as far as I know, the code in the 0.95a kernel
is good.  I've had no problems at all, and I'm using /dev/hdb4 as my
/usr partition, with the devices set up as on the root disk.

Here's what I use.  It's based on the termcap entry supplied with
Linux, but has removed a few things that don't work (at least in
0.12).  It is set up for a color screen, so it gives you a green Emacs
