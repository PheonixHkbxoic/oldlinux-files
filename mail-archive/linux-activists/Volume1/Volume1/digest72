(Good suggestions deleted)

Three of those things I uploaded, without attribution:
- sdbm, an ndbm clone
- m4, a preprocessor
- John Haugh's shadow password suite.

I used the first two, and a number of pieces of poe's work, in building
the third.

The third contains:

chage chfn chpasswd chsh dialup.h dpasswd faillog gpasswd groupadd
groupdel groupmod groups id libshadow.a login login.defs logoutd
mkpasswd newgrp newusers passwd pwconv pwd.h pwunconv shadow.h
su sulogin useradd userdel usermod

If anything, it's too much stuff.  My 3M root partition is nearly
full.  Shared libraries for this would be kind of nice.

On tsx-11, the shadow password stuff is split into two files:
shadow-src.tar.Z and shadow-bin.tar.Z.  You *can* use the binaries
without grabbing the source, but there's a small kernel patch in
the src file, which makes it look nicer...  It adds ECHONL support,
so when you hit enter after typing a password, the enter is echoed.

shadow-src contains a README file.  shadow-bin contains a script
"quick.install", taken from a "make -n install", to get it
running on your system with minimal effort.

I've uploaded my kernel+some demo programs to tsx-11.mit.edu as tubes.tar.Z.
I tried to patch a fresh kernel and then make a diff from that but ran into
some weird problems which might also explain the problems people had with
the floppy patch. The fresh kernel seems to have some things mine doesn't.

The kernel I uploaded is the one I've been using, floppy+vc patchs.
All the changes in fs/*.c (except select) are surrounded with #ifdefs so
they could be cut and pasted in to another kernel. I'm hoping that once
Linux has VFS it will be possible to make a simple patch instead of
modifying a bunch of files.

Sun have placed the specification of all three components of NFS into the 
public domain, RPC (Remote Procedure Calls, and in this case they have also
placed an implementation into the public domain), XDR ( External Data
Representation) and the NFS protocol itself which sits on top of the above two.

They did this to encourage the wide spread adoption of NFS and were
successful in this.

i.e. OSF provide an implementation of NFS in OSF/1 which originates from Guelph 
University (where ever that is) which doesn't include any Sun Microsystem's
Code and which consequently isn't covered by any Sun Copyrights.

This style of enlightened marketing has been one of the great things about
Sun, hopefully ( in spite of recent signs to the contrary :-() sun will
continue this open approach.

Hi everyone:

  I saw an article a couple of days ago complaining that init takes too much
cpu cycles. I got into the same problem yesterday when I installed the poeigl
stuff for the first time. Like Peter (author, poeigl) points out init should
in fact be sleeing most of the time. A look at the code and the README file
reveals that all error messages are displayed on /dev/console and I didn't
have console. SO I made /dev/tty1 as console and then I found out that init was
forking like crazy with exec failing. A look at inittab didn't reveal anything
at first sight. But after a close look I found a blank line in it. A quick
look at init.c revealed that blank lines in inittab are not ignored. So, my
init was happily forking and execing a null string as file to execute.
Naturally it was failing and restarting etc... Deleting the null line and
sending a SIGHUP to init solved the problem.

All those who  had similar problems may want to check their inittab for null
lines and spelling mistakes. Also don't forget the /dev/console.

Peter, if you plan to fix this can you also make login and agetty to write
error messages to /dev/console so that by linking appropriate /dev/tty? we can
move error messages as per our liking.

Ramesh.

When I try to dial in to poe-IGL using a hayes compatible 2400 baud
modem i get stuff like this:
(none) login: password: Login incorrect
repeated a few times, without giving me the chance to respond to the
login: prompt.  What options do I need to give agetty in inittab?  What
options should my terminal emulator use (XON/XOFF, CTS/RTS, etc...).
Also, I have not yet dared to modify my kernel in order to have it run
init.  When I want to use it, I just type init & from the shell.  Is
this ok?
thanks for any info,

What happens when I start up. The home directory is always set to

Help please!!!

It's not that I want to be stupid but I'm getting a little paranoid....
The problem is (yes again) instalation to HD.
I know that there is a partion.faq and I read it a million times, give or
take a few, but it still dont work.

Now the setup is as follows...
My first harddisk is a 43 MB drive, I have split it into two partitions
at 23 MB and 20 MB, I got DOS running on the first partition and I want to
install Linux on the second partition, just like everybody else...

I boot Linux from floppy, fdisk tells me that I have two drives and that
the second drive holds 20046 blocks, nice!

mkfs -c /dev/hd2 20046 works allright two, no sweat.

Mounting /dev/hd2 /user goes well two.

The recursive copy function works, and I can cd /user and actually play around
the harddisk, this stuff is just okay, but I sync (yes 3 times don't wanna 
upset the UNIX god where ever he is:))

Reset and boot the boot disk which is changed to 508=3 509=2 comes up with
the usual Press enter to see SVGA modes....
. 
. 
. 
Insert rootsystem into floppy and press enter (I cant remember the exact words
but something like that you know it...)

BUT NOW WHEN I PRESS ENTER I JUST GET

Reset floppy called.
Reset floppy called.
Reset floppy called.
Reset floppy called.
Reset floppy called.
Reset floppy called.

You get the picture ?

I have tried the above drill about 15 times, please what do I do wrong?


Otherwise Linux seems just like what I needed, and I lokking forward to get
it running.

Well I'm knackered. I just finished showing off LINUX 0.12 to all the main
computing staff (CSM admissions tutor, SUN transputer manager, main unix
administrators and other asorted staff) (i've never been so terified in my
life!)

I 'modified' 6 machines (opel, emerald, diamond.. etc) and created an almost
exact duplicate of our main sun system's directory hirarchy and passwd files
.... extended thanks go to linus torvolds, LeBlanc@uk.ac.mcc, poe@dk.aau.daimi,
and all the other people i've pestered over the last few days 8)

verdict?... they all want one and bug**r the sun solaris effort that they had
all been reading about!... tom (sys manager of csd) wants xwindows, will (sys
of the workstation network) wants a 386.. badly, andy (transputer boss & sys
admin) will possibly donate a couple of tranputer 486's.... and wants a copy
for the one he has at home,... (sigh)...

QUOTE of the day: (Andy) ... look tom,.. it's unix,.. it's real unix!...

all went exceedingly well and except for the occasional bsd sysv conflict,
they all seemed quite at home. (I think it was the food that i provided that
set it all off actually). 

The thing is, these people are seasoned bsd unix administrators and although
almost everything worked, there was ONE small/big? problem

EMACS 18.57 !!!!!

tom tried to load up a shell in emacs and ... it hung,... the processor
died and i felt 2" high... (gurr) i tried it out and sure enough
emacs hangs trying to start a  new shell

has anyone else come across this? or is it something that i've not done?
the other features are all there but the shell seems broke,... i can't
recover from it either 8( not even in a second virt con

the machine is a 386 16mhz sx 40 meg hd, 9 meg swap space(overkill) 4 meg
memory...

any takers?

Subject: Floating point performance
Date: 26 Feb 1992 19:16:46 GMT


I just got GCC-1.40 and the libsoft.a. :-) :-) :-)

So I took a typical differential equation solution program (alright,
it's braindead, but it's interesting) and compiled it using

        gcc -O -Wall -o vibr vibr.c -lsoft

and timed the results. It took *9 TIMES* as long as the same program
compiled under MessedupDos using BC++ 3.0 to run. (only a few doshells
running, besides the program itself.)

All the algorithm does is take a sin(), a sqrt(), and some
multiplications and divisions on each step.

Is libsoft.a just slow, or is it the overhead of Linux, or what? 
Would I really see a >10x performance gain by getting a coprocessor?

Thanks!

Ok, as promised here it is.  It only makes whatis from roff manpages, and will
puke if the man pages are not  standard format 
(IE : .SH NAME 
name1[,name2, name3 ...] - description
is not there) 

Note that by changing it to look for the resulting "straight ASCII" 
of NAME , and by extracting section from the file name, 
you can work on CAT pages instead.  

Output is to stdout.

Problem : I don't have roff!
Solution : I have uploaded cawf binaries to nic.funet.fi under
        incomming.  The only changes to the distribution sources
        were to ignore non-fatal error messages.

        Simply install it, make a symlink to nroff from cawf, 
        and be happy.

It seems that the new gcc has some problems with converting floating
point numbers to ints.  Try 'printf( "%d\n", (int) 0.51 )'.  It appears
to be rounding instead of truncating.

I have also noticed some problems with v*printf.  v*printf should accept
a va_list as a formal parameter which is then passed on to _doprnt.
However in the new libc.a, v*printf acts just like *printf, with a
variable formal parameter list.  It then attempts to create the va_list
itself which it then incorrectly passes on to _doprnt.  

I have also
noticed dramatic reductions in floating point performance in comparison
with the old libc.a.  Oh yeah, the floor() and ceil() functions (or
maybe just one of them) cause a segmentation fault.

I've installed Linux (v.0.12, no patches yet - read on to see why) 
on my second HD (40Meg, Connors IDE somethingorother), and leave my first
40M HD as DOS.  I boot linux off floppy.  (I can diable speed switching, so
it's acceptably fast)
 
I d/l (using kermit - when will serial I/O work properly?)  all the compiler
binaries, as86, bison, flex, gcc, and stuck them into /tmp.
Then I try 'uncompress as86.tar.Z' ... it works for a little while, then
hangs the machine.  I can type for about ~15-25 seconds after I execute
(fg or bg - doesn't matter except in timing) and then the whole machine just
sits there ... a nice-looking paperweight. 
 
I have 4M RAM, no swap space.  No error messages.  It'll sync until it dies,
so it seems there's a specific point at which uncompress stops...

the same thing happens no matter which file I try to uncompress.
I didn't have this problem with the tar.Z that came on the root image.
I don't have this problem when I 'compress' something and then 'uncompress'
again. 

Any ideas, people?  

BTW: when will 0.13 be released?  2) what is the secondary v#(0.95) that I keep
 seeing ?
