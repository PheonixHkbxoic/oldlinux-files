available from ftp.uu.net and other sites) which is slower but more
efficient than the standard UNIX "compress".  I was able to build it
fairly easily under linux.

For people who have to do file transfer by slow modem or floppy disk,
using freeze rather than compress is likely to be a big help.  Even
for people with relatively fast connections (I'm using 9600 now), it
helps for large files.

What I did was first partition the disk under DOS 5.0 using the DOS
fdisk, and then use edpart to delete and recreate the partition for
Linux.  This lets you have a big partition for DOS, but still have the
old-style partition for Linux.

Hi. I've hacked together a little nifty routine that will allow you to
switch between your last two virtual consoles by hitting RIGHT-ALT-N.
It requires mods to keyboard.S and to tty_io.c. The diffs are at the
end of this message. Let me know what you think.

I now have a few observations and questions:

C library: the system has no strdup() or ttyname() function calls.

Standard input/output: Are the keyboard input routines (getchar,
gets, etc.) not supposed to flush the output device before they
read? I.e. If I do printf("Your name: "); gets(name); it should
print your name and then read in your name.

I have a program which I wrote that turns off all character canonization
and sets VMIN=1 and VTIME=0 (or whatever it is to get unbuffered character
input). Prompts (i.e. non newline terminated strings) are not echoed. Nor
are characters "putchar'd". No echoing at all occurs until a newline is
sent to the output.

This is not the case with SunOS nor SCO Unix/Xenix. The program worked
AOK for those two environments. Do I have to set the output to unbuffered
for linux to get it to work?

Kernel keyboard handling: Are there not different scan codes for the two ALT
keys? I don't quite understand how the code to detect the left from the 
right alt key in the kernel works. There is one comparison with e0 and
only one "alt" routine in the key_table. So, please let me know what's up
with the two alt keys.

Cheers,

Doug

Subject: cursor! vc patch killed it...
Date: 28 Jan 92 23:26:22 GMT

Thanks, I got ps working. Sorry I hadn't checked that all the files
that were patched were also recompiled. Stupid me.

But now that the files ARE compiled, ps works but when I start virtual
consoles, I have no cursor after the shell prompt in them! Everything
works as it should, and the cursor appears after I have run some
programs in the shell (not the same ones every time, sometimes ls,
sometimes ps etc.). Sometimes the cursor even appears in the middle of
the line while I am writing some command, and then again disappears.
Weird, I say.

This patching thing is a bit new for me, and it sure seems that if
there are multiple patches from different people, you can really blow
things up. Now I just have no idea which patches go first, which ones
are needed and even where to get all of them. Some come up on the
mailing list, some here and only a few of them go all the way to the
ftp sites. It's easy to miss something you might need later, when the
patches come and go unorganized like this.

Of course I am not blaming anyone but myself for my problems here (and
they really seem to be minor ones), I am just saying that it would be
nice to be able to get all the patches at same place (ftp preferably,
you can't miss that so easily) and that there should be clear
information about what needs to be done to be able to use a certain
patch.

Hi, Linuxers

Earlier it was stated that gcc will not work on a 2MB machine, but
in the announcement of the features of 0.12 Linus wrote (Dec 19th):

| I got VM working today (not bad in two days if I may say so :-), but
| haven't really tested extensively.  I tried some compilations (I remade
| uemacs) on a 2M machine (or rather a 8M machine, of which Linux sees
| only 2M), and it worked (gcc, make, bash etc in memory ar the same
| time), albeit slowly.  There are probably still problems, but it seems
| VM will definitely be in 0.12. 

I tried to recompile the kernel on my 2MB, 16MHz 386SX yesterday.
In none of the subdirectories this completed successfull.
Some modules compile well, on others gcc compiles a lot (HD ist
acting a lot), but after a while (5 .. 15min) there seems no more
traffic on the disk (only the 30s-updates).
With ^C I come back to sh and everything is o.k. (except that I didn't
get what I want - a new kernel).

Question:

Is anybody out there who successfully made a new kernel on
a small machine like mine? Maybe I simply did not wait long enough?

What would be better: To buy more RAM or a bigger Harddisk
(for a Swappartition and another Linux Partition).
Please send any answers, suggestions, ... per mail. I have no
access to the news.

I wonder how hard compressing the file system on the fly or maybe using
compressed executable would be?

Anyone have any thoughts?

It looks to me as if you forgot to SET FILE TYPE BIN in either or both
kermits and it inserted did something to the CR/LFs.

try again with setting the file types on both kermit.

Subject: CRON available
Date: 29 Jan 92 11:42:15 GMT


  I have ported Paul Vixie's SysV compatible cron to Linux.

  The beta version is now available (sources, and exectubles, man pages,
  etc...) in vixie-cron.tar.Z on tsx-11.mit.edu (in /incoming for the
  moment.)
  

  This is a beta version for several reasons:

     1) sleep() is incorrect in the version 0.12 libc.a; I have
        a replacement sleep.c in the sources.  You should replace
        your sleep.o in libc.a with this one.

     2) pause() isn't correct in version 0.12; but I have a work around
        in the cron sources (use -DLINUX_V0_12_PAUSE_BUG in the Makefile)
        (Linus has written a fix if you want it, but it's no big deal
        to cron if you don't have it.)

     3) file locking is not yet available in Linux; the cron daemon uses
        file locking to make sure only one cron daemon is running.
        So; be careful not to run two daemons, or your commands will
        execute twice.

  Most of the fixes for vixie-cron were related to these problems, but
  there was also a tendency in Paul Vixie's original source to reference
  free() memory; which I corrected as well.

  The two executables (crond and crontab) in the tar file should be 
  installed as follows:

          cp crond /etc/crond
          chmod 111 /etc/crond
          cp crontab /bin/crontab
          chmod 4111 /bin/crontab

  or, simply run make install.

          - Dave Rivers -
          (rivers@ponds.uucp)

p.s. I have only uploaded this (as well as my uuencode/uudecode port) to
     tsx-11.mit.edu; could some kind soul (who has decent internet
     access) please take a moment to propagate this to the other
     archives.  I actually have to kermit the images to my wife's
     account to ftp them.

p.p.s. Now with a decent cron() I may get started porting Taylor UUCP, or
       UUCP V1.2 from minix (I don't think minix's UUCP is under the
       same copyright constraints as the other minix sources...)
