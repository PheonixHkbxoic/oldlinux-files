I recently installed Linux 0.12 on my hard drive (105 Mb). From the
Instalation notes it say that you could only use a primary partition
for Linux - you can't use extended partitions. Edpart tells me that
primary partitions can only go in the first 32Mb of the hard disk, so
you can't make your 88Mb partition into a linux partition. (at least I
don't *think* you can)

Is anyone working on using extended partitions for linux?

On another note, there's a question that I have:

I can transfer tar's from DOS to linux by using rawrite on a floppy,
but is there any way to transfer data back to DOS from linux? I have
thought of one way - use kermit to transfer it to my unix account,
then from there transfer it back to DOS (seems like a long way to do
it, though), BUT I have one problem. No modem (I don't have the $$$
yet). So is there a way to transfer stuff from linux directly to a
disk in DOS-readable format? or should I wait for a modem?

And is there an FAQ? If so, could someone send it to me or tell me
where it is?

After posting about my problems w/ Linux boot not booting (disk spins several
seconds, writes |- Loa -and hangs), I've noticed several other posts from
owners of 486 systems with similar problems. Can anyone confirm that
Linux presently hates the 486? Anyone been able to get it to run under
a 486 and if so, what sort of configuration do you have?

If you're saying that primary partitions have to start within the first
32MB of the disk, then it's news to me.  My DOS partition takes the
first 160MB of my disk, and then my three Linux partitions start from
there.  None of them are extended partitions.

Get the excellent mtools package.  This gives you mattrib, mcd, mdir,
mdel, mcopy, mmd, mrd, mren, and a few others which act like the DOS
commands on DOS devices but run under Linux.  Mcopy lets you copy files
from/to DOS.  Mtools is probably available from the same place you got
Linux.  I got my copy from tsx-11.mit.edu.

Otherwise, you can always create tars under Linux and then write
yourself a rawread.  With rawrite as a model, it wouldn't be too
difficult.

When I saw that and other problems similar to what other people have been
describing in the installation problems postings, it was becase the file
had been mangled before it got to the dos machine.  I was using ftpmail
to VMS, then kermit to dos.  It took some experimenting before I got a
bootimage that worked.

When this happened to me it was because I didn't read the directions
carefully enough, and I was trying to write the files to the floppy
with a public domain tar under dos.  Then I realized I was suppose to
tar them to a file, and write the file to the floppy with rawrite.
After that it worked.

Hmmm... this is news to *me*. All I know is what edpart told me: I tried to
make a primary partition that went above the 32Mb mark on the hard drive
(I tried to make my first one 40Mb, then I tried to make two 20Mb primaries),
but edpart said something like 'partition above the 32Mb mark' and refused to
make it primary. Am I doing something wrong? fdisk told me the same thing.

Guess that shows me not to trust what the software tell me it can do :-)

it seems that this would probably have more advantages than just
linux->dos: You could probably save a few K on the disks if you used
raw data and didn't have to format it under dos (thus saving all the
space that normally get allocated to directories, etc.) This might be
useful for things like data disks, using rawread and rawrite, but if
this were done, it would probably create more headaches than it would
save storage space. Just out of curiosity, has anyone used this method
for saving raw data on disks? (other than for bootstraping os's :-)

The m-tools will do this.  They let you read and write to MS/DOS
floppies and hard disks.  Diffs for the mtools are on the archive
systems.

This is a typical Linux problem.  Somebody posts diffs, but gives you
no clue where to get the original files on which the diffs are based.
I'll be making full source and binaries available sometime this
weekend, to simplify things for other people.  My version of the
mtools has been extended to handle pipes.  I do backups by piping tar
to mwrite.  Thus the backup ends up as a file under MS/DOS.  I then
use MS/DOS to back up to a tape.  This method is useful for those of
you with disks too big for floppies to be a reasonable backup medium,
until we get tape support in Linux.  (I have a 128MB DOS partition, a
64MB Linux data partition, and a 64MB Linux swap partition.  I don't
really want to back up to 64 floppies.)

Well, yes. I'm still hoping it's the out-of-memory bug (which I have

Tools? We don't need no ...  :) Printk's in the kernel is the standard
"debugging" trick.  If somebody comes up with something better, feel
free to post: I'm not too happy about it either, but it's simple. 

This doesn't just extend to the kernel: debugging user programs isn't
exactly easy under linux either :( - I've resorted to things like

$ od -hx executable | less

to find errors efter a program crash... That's what the debugging info
printed after exceptions is there for. Oh, well..

Yes. Mr. Tommy Thorn posted one a couple of weeks ago. I don't know
how it performs or if any updates exist. If you can't find it in
the archives I could mail it to you. 

You need to have access to a machine with standard AT bus HD driver 
in order to recompile Linux with this driver - unless someone could
make available a boot image built with Mr. Thorn's driver...

I ask again: Is anyone working on a SCSI driver for DTC adapters?

I had the same problems as above, a loop showin register values.
It seems I got the problem because I used floppydisks that 
I've used before, ie. they were already formated, so I did not
bother doing that.

After formatting and then rawrite on a pair of 1.2mb it worked.

Has anyone thought about implementing a shutdown like the NeXT has?

On that system, you can press <L-CMD>-<R-CMD>-<~> (three key sequence pressed
together) and the system will verify that you want to shutdown.  Then it 
will proceed with the shutdown procedure.

Of course, on the NeXT, it does all this from the Graphics Login Prompt,
which Linux doesn't have (yet :-) .

Ideas?  Comments?  We could still implement it without graphics and make
sure that when graphics comes along (X, wherefore art though X? :-)
that it works with it also.

That would be much better than just a hard re-boot or a sync() and a reboot.

First of all, thanks to all those who responsed to the problem I was
having with TAR.  It took me an amazingly long time to realize that
the 3.5" drive I use as a: is a 1.44M, and not 1.2M, drive.... :-)  

Has someone fixed the problem with kermit?  I can get it to dial
(sometimes), but when I try to connect, I have less than a second of
communications before kermit decided I've had enough.  Also, why
doesn't:

        echo atx4dt 1234567 > /dev/tty64

dial the phone?

Is /dev/kmem implemented/working?  I'd like to run something like
``top.''

As I understand, all a DOS emulator would need to do is remap memory
and intercept DOS and BIOS interupts.  At least that should handle
well-behaved DOS programs.  Many of the interupts could simply be
converted into Unix system calls, I suspect.  At any rate, is anyone
working on this?  Also, can the 386 have virtual 386 machines?  For
example, could such a DOS emulator run DJGPP's GCC for DOS, which is
itself a 32 application?  What about windows under Linux?

Again, many thanks Linus!
