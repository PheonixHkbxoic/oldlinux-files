expr should not be a shell builtin, if you subscribe to the 'rc'
philosophy of keeping things out of the shell that are just as well
suited to stand-alone programs, which I believe expr is.

'expr' is part of the GNU shell utilities, which should be on the
tsx-11.mit.edu.

Also, you might want to take note that 'expr' is not available as a
builtin in either 'bash' or 'ash'.

/lib is where the shared libraries live, so it must be online before
you run any programs that survive on shared libraries.  /lib should
also be part of your / mount point (along with /bin, /dev, and /etc).

If you've used the inst2.0 script that comes with gcc 2.0, you'll need
to copy /usr/gcc2/shared/lib/lib92.03.15 (or whatever the date is) to
/lib, especially if /usr is a mounted partition (as I learned today).
Otherwise you end up with all sorts of errors when Linux can't resolve
the line that inst2.0 creates.

I've had great luck with gcc 2.0, with both static and shared libs.
With shared libs, everything compiles down really nice and small,
especially most of the minor utilities in /bin (hostname, chsh,
passwd, etc.)

The patches from Linus that I posted break xon (^Q).  Xon clears
stopped mode, but doesn't actually restart output.  It only starts the

0.95a has code that should have this effect already.  When the control
key is down, all characters are anded with 1f.  This maps space, @ and 2
into null, so you can hit ctrl-space, ctrl-2, or ctrl-@.

There is a version of KA9Q that is built this way already.  The reason
I didn't look at it when doing the KA9Q port is that we didn't have
any Unix-mode sockets or equivalent at the time.  I believe with

I finally got gcc-1.40 working. Apparently /bin/as got corrupted in
transit; replacing it with the 'as' from gccbin.tar seems to have done
the trick. But this is a different version, if I understand correctly
--- am I going to encounter some obscure incompatibility? I'm going
to download newgcc.tar again, and see if I get the same behavior.

That's an interesting idea, but there are a couple of things you
will want to watch out for.  You'll want to keep the temporary file
around as long as the program is running so that the VM system can
read pages back in from it if a code page gets dropped from RAM.
You'll also want to check and see if somebody else is using the
program and run from his uncompressed binary if he is so that you
can take advantage of shared text.  (Just think of a dozen people
running emacs without shared text!)

On some systems this could dramatically slow startup time, as well.
I would think that a sophisticated system would create the VM space
for the program but, rather than loading the whole thing into memory
right away, mark all the pages as swapped.  Then when the program
is run it will be loaded into memory though successive page faults
as it runs.  This ends up using more CPU time overall, but saves
on on disk accesses if all the facilities of a large program are
not used and also lets a large program start up quite quickly.

Uncompressing the program first, though, involves reading in the
entire program (albeit in compressed form) and then writing the
whole thing out to disk again before you even think about startup.
The uncompression, too, would be a drag on a system with a slow
CPU.

Are you sure tty0 is the current screen?  For my /dev, there isn't a
/dev/tty0.  There's a /dev/tty, which has major 5, minor 0, but
there's no /dev/tty0.  Perhaps /dev/tty[1-8] is wrong, too.  :)

The same goes for /dev/hda*.  Why are they not zero-based?  Seems like
a bit of inconsistency, to me.

On a related note, has anyone given thought to a consistent
floppy-naming scheme?  I really don't like the current /dev/PS0,
/dev/at0 stuff.

I was thinking of something along the lines of /dev/fdXY, where X
would represent the drive number (0 = A, 1 = B, etc.) and where Y
would be alphabetic, representing the type of format/drive type.
(i.e. a = 360k on 360k, b = 1.2m in 1.2m, c = 360k in 720k/1.44m)

Does anyone see a problem with this sort of naming scheme?

The current naming wouldn't be so bad if it were documented somewhere.(
Minix documentation doesn't count.

Whatever you do, you can't make everyone happy.  In keeping with that
thought, here are my suggestions:

Winchester disks:       wdDP  where D = drive [01], P = partition [a-z]
                        wdD   for entire drive D
SCSI disks:             sdDP  where D = drive [0-7], P = partition [a-z]
                        Note: I don't know enough about the SCSI drives 
                        to know if this is appropriate for them
Floppy disks:           fdDP  where D = drive [0-3], P = format [a-?]
                        fdD   for drive D with default format
Virtual consoles:       ttyN  where N = number [1-8]
                        tty0  for current console
                        Note: 1-based VC's works nicely with alt-Fn key
Serial ports:           ttyX  where X = number [a-d]
                        Note: ttys[1-4] are sometimes used for PTY's
SCSI tapes:             stD   where D = drive [0-?]
Other tapes:            tpD   where D = drive [0-?]

I had a feeling he was right, but I wasn't sure, since I've never seen
a /dev/tty0 on any Linux systems.  Should this have major 4 and minor 0?

In a way, I guess that's true.  It makes sense either way, really
(with zero-based, or one-based), so I don't think I'll mess with it,
much as I'm tempted to do so.  (Really, /dev/hda refers to all
/dev/hda[0-x], if it were zero-based.  That corresponds to /dev/tty
referring to the current /dev/tty*.)

Well, I don't like how it makes the different floppy names so
radically different from each other.  /dev/fdDT keeps all the floppy
drives under one name.

I know I won't make everyone happy.  :)  Some people have already made

I like this idea of /dev/fdD for the 'default', but I have a little
question - would that be a default on a Linux-wide basis, or per
machine?  I would suspect on a per-machine basis....

Yes, the correlation between /dev/tty1 and Alt-F1 is nice.

Does Linux support this many (presumably > 32) pty's?

Naming the serial ports /dev/tty[a-d] runs into problems if someone
has more than 9 virtual consoles (is that even possible?).

I still haven't a solution to the problem of serial devices I'm
entirely happy with.  /dev/ttys[0-3] could suffer from name
collisions, /dev/tty6[4567] is really non-informative, and groups it
with the virtual consoles, and /dev/com[1-4] is just icky.

Overall, I like the naming scheme you mentioned:  It's consistent, and
it makes sense.  That's what I'm going for by bringing up renaming the
serial devices and floppy devices...
