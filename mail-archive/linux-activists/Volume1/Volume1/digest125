It boots on many machines.  It doesn't boot on a lot.  With Linux,
you still have the option of running DOS on only one hard disk, 
with BSD you do a mklabel etc, and that IS your hard disk.   DOS and
BSD will not coexist.  BSD has neither virtual consoles nor X, 
so you want something there's no way to hangup, and you need a 
spare dumb terminal.  No ptrace, no shared libraries, heavy resource
usage.  BSD 386 is where linux was last year in terms of stability.

BSD has name recognition, FFS, networking, and tape support.  It will 
take more to rectify the 386 BSD problems, and add Linux standards like 
shared libraries, virtual consoles, etc.  than it will to add the 
missing features to Linux.

I do however see a cross pollination of code between BSD and Linux, 
with people from both groups borrowing code from eachother.

Minix : Linux and BSD will definately hit Minix's non-educational
users.  As far as educational users, the operating systems professor
here at CU was practically salavating over BSD 386, and having a
"real operating system" that he can teach with.  

I plan on staying with Linux.  At this point, BSD 386 just has a 
long way to go.

Subject: Here I go again.  (*another* shell - rc!)
Date: Thu, 19 Mar 1992 08:29:13 GMT

Well, when I first started making noises about replacing bash on the
root floppy with ash, a few people made happy sounds about a shell
called 'rc' in my direction.  Now that the root floppy (0.95a) is out,
and I have a little more time on my hands (after that corrupted
rootimage fiasco - sorry again!), I decided to track down a copy of
'rc' and see what was so swell about it.

I'm really impressed with 'rc', especially with either the GNU
readline library (which adds a bit of weight, but makes it as nice to
use as bash at 1/3 the weight), or with the smaller GNU-readline like
library included with rc-1.3beta (not quite as nice as readline, but
saves a fair amount of baggage.)

I'm going to run 'rc' through the hoops for a while on my system, and
will upload binaries to tsx-11 by the end of the week, probably with a
readline and an editline version.  For those that can't wait - compile
it yourself, it was absolutely painless.  (It's available on
archone.tamu.edu in /pub/rc.)

As you might have guessed, I'm also debating whether or not 'rc' might
find it's way onto the root floppy.  It would be nice, since it is
about a billion times better for interactive use than 'ash', but it
also means stepping into that fuzzy area of breaking a rather solid
tradition.

For those that are curious, rc weighs in at about 70k with the
editline library, and closer to 100k with the GNU readline library.
This drops dramatically with shared libraries, too.  (Down to about
50k for the GNU readline version, if I remember right.)

Very few programs have impressed me as much as 'rc' has in the last
few hours, and I've barely even scratched the surface of it's
capabilities.  If the rest of Plan 9 is this nice, someone should beat
up AT&T and force them to release it to the general public....

Also, a quick update on finding a small editor for the root-disk:

        People have suggested 'joe', which I remember hearing about
        before, but where can I get the latest version?  Archie only
        turns up earlier versions (I know Linux-support is in the
        official version, because I remember seeing the announcement.)

        I took a look at 'ae', a small editor which has it's roots in
        that wonderful hard-to-read C code contest (yeah, must be
        rough), but it can't handle the arrow keys out of the box, and
        I don't really want to try and add them in.

        I've got the fptedit posted to alt.sources today, but I
        haven't had a chance to look at it or try and compile it.
        I've been playing with 'rc' too much.  :)

Well, I just got linux runing on my system here. (Yea!)  I backed up my 81 
meg HD, and re-partioned/formated it. I used a shareware program called 
PDISK to create the partitions (DOS fdisk leaves a lot to be desired..). I 
made a 50 meg partition for DOS, and a 31 meg partition for linux. Then I 
followed the steps in the INSTALL file. This is only v0.12, because 0.95 or 
0.95a isn't available here yet. The INSTALL file gives a sample C program to 
change the root-disk to the HD, but a hex-edit was easier. Anyhow, the point 
is -- finally -- that it runs just fine on my 386sz/20Mhz with a 31 meg DOS 
partition, and 2 MB of RAM.

At this point I'm staying with Linux because its more fun. It will soon
have things that BSD doesn't.

I have just got Linux 0.95a working on my laptop with no problems (once
I understood what was needed to be done!).  The latest version seems to work
much better on my system (before, I occasionally got unexpect HD interrupt 
messages and other funnies) - thanks to all who put it together!

The laptop is an Acer 1100LX 386SX/16Mhz, 5Mb RAM and with coprocessor.
Linux is in a 25Mbyte partition on the hard disk (I have also partitions
for DR DOS 6.0 and OS/2.

I just read the BUGS section of the 386BSD release, and it seems to
have less features and more bugs than Linux! Tty things are not yet
finished, the thing crashes while paging, does not yet have a 
init/getty/login (or at least doesn't use it by default), missing/
extra interrupts cause system to hang....

Bugs that Linux doesn't have (anymore), and features already added.

Maybe not so much need to switch anyway! 

I will have a look at the tapestreamer support when I get a chance:
This looks promising.

Subject: Pklite for Linux, end of project.
Reply-To: jyelon@suna0.cs.uiuc.edu
Date: Thu, 19 Mar 1992 15:01:09 GMT

About the PKLITE project that I had undertaken: I am no longer
interested, here are my notes, for anyone who wishes to take over.

Implementation would be trivial if only we had this one
system call:

        execv_in_core(data, len, argv)
        char *data;
        int len;
        char *argv[];

It acts exactly like execv, except that rather than exec'ing
a file, it exec's a block of memory. In other words, these two
pieces of code should have basically the same effect:

        1. execv("/usr/josh/bin/foo",argv)
        
        2. progfile = open("/usr/josh/bin/foo",O_RDONLY);
           progsize = read(progfile, progbuffer, 9999999);
           execv_in_core(progbuffer, progsize, argv);

That's the only kernel modification you would need - the rest
would be user-level code. Pklite would work like this:

1. It compresses the executable.
2. It concatenates a decompression routing to the compressed data,
   and tacks on the appropriate ZMAGIC header.
3. When the new binary runs, it decompresses the data in memory,
   and then runs the data, using execv_in_core.

That's all there is to it! At least, in theory.

The problem is "execv_in_core". It looks trivial. In fact, it's
hopeless. Linux is absolutely infested with the assumption that
every process has an associated executable from which it can page.
execv_in_core would break that assumption, and everything
would fall to pieces. Even if we did somehow manage to patch things
up, we'd need to completely redo the implementation of shared pages in
order to get two execv_in_core programs to share pages.

I do hope that somebody tries: It seems very much worthwhile,
regardless of whether or not stacker exists. I don't disagree that
stacker is useful. However, a 'stacker' just can't get the same
level of compression that a program like pklite could achieve:

    - pklite can take all night to compress your files. Just
      start a batch file, and it'll be done in the morning.
      Stacker, instead, has to do a half-hearted job, since it's
      in a hurry not to slow down your filesystem.
    - pklite can make a useful assumption about your files:
      namely, that they contain mostly 386 instructions. That
      assumption should enable it to increase compression
      significantly.
    - pklite doesn't need to allow random access: there is
      no reason for pklite to chunk things into 1k, 2k, 3k,
      and 4k pages, thereby causing internal fragmentation,
      and reducing compression.

These factors add up to one thing: significantly better
compression ratios for pklite.

Call me if you get the system call implemented, but need a hand
on the data compression part.

The 0.95, and now the 0.95a rootimage files uncompress to; 1,228,800
bytes on my work bsd4.3/unix machine.

When I freshly format a 1.2M disk on my DOS machine using DOS 5,
the reported free disk space is; 1,213,952.

When I use 'rawrite.exe' to copy the image over to 1.2M disk no
problems are reported, and I don't seem to be missing anything when
I use Linux rootimage disk/files..... but, at reading the file length
in bytes and available bytes on formatted disk it wouldn't seem that
it would fit. Some beginners may wonder about this. I do.
Any suggestions?

As I understood, Terry's problem was that the kernel didn't try
to check for SVGA at all, but went ahead and booted instead.

Yeah, I have something called 'Expert VGA' with a Trident 8800CS
chip on it (I wonder if the 'expert' refers to the knowledge required
to make the card work ;-) ). The code above failed to recognize
my card, at least, so I had to do some tinkering. I've mailed the
patches to Linus, but I'll post'em anyway, just in case they didn't
make it into 0.95a.
