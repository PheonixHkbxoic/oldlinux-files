This was just information that I heard from someone at Mark Williams, who had
heard it from one of the original developers of Coherent.  PC/IX was very
similar to Coherent back in 1981, they both ran on the IBM PC/8088.  At this
point in time, Coherent only runs in 80286 protected mode on 286 or better
processors.  In 1981, Coherent and PC/IX were based on V7 UNIX.  Today,
Coherent has a lot of SYSV compatibility.

I spoke to someone who took an os course in college that used Minix on the
PC/XT.  He said it took well over an hour to recompile the kernel.  Times sure
have changed.

Subject: Has anyone ported....?

I found out my problems with installation - I thought the 508th byte
meant the 508th byte - not at offset 508 (which is the 509th byte).
Now, there are a couple programs which I could not find on tsx-11 (the
easiest to get to from the US).  Has anyone ported any of the following:

GCC v2.0
Gnu libc v1.00
GNU Emacs v18.58 (or something close)
GNU DBM (I saw an sdbm - put I have some gdbm stuff I would like to use.
I tried to compile gdbm straight - but none of the tests worked)
TeX/MF/dvips

any graphics library - maybe libgr.a from DJGPP under DOS?

Anyway, thanks for a great OS...

We should have the ethernet drivers be hierchical - with only the lowest
level changing for specific ethernet boards.  Look at my scsi code 
for how I did this.  This will let many other people share the bulk
of your code, with no modifications,  and if the autodetection routines 
are there, one distribution kernel can be used that supports everything 
out there (with individuals recompiling with only the options they want
turned on if they feel like it)

Subject: Header files
Date: 6 Mar 92 19:31:36 GMT

What state are the header files in. I've been trying to compile
textutils and run into a few problems. The first thing I noticed is that
the stat structure doesn't have a st_blksize. Is this important? The
configure shell that comes with textutils checks for its existence and
makes patches so I suppose it doesn't exist on all platforms. What does
posix say about it?

However, the patch for this used BSIZE which I can't find anywhere, not
in linux, Ultrix or Sun OS. I've obviously missed some define somewhere.
This is causing the compilation to barf. 

While I was doing all this nosing around in the include files I did
notice that there seem to be large gaps in some of them. stat.h has
quite a few differences with the other os's I looked at. param.h is
positively thin on the ground. My knowledge of the standards is pretty
weak so I don't know if they should be like this or not. What I'm asking
is, do the include files still need work on them or is it just my lack
of understanding.

Subject: Kernel configuration
Date: 6 Mar 92 20:06:57 GMT

In the begining, you had few options when building Linux : 
what keyboard you wanted, where to mount / from, and 
possibly overiding the BIOS hard disk parameters.

However, times are changing.  Now there is line printer 
support, SCSI support for one host adapter with others 
coming (soon, we hope), and in the future there will  
hopefully be networking support, puting SLIP, CSLIP, and normal
IP over ethernet in the kernel.  

Ideally, there will be a generic distribution kerenel that autodetects
what you have and just runs.  However, the space concious should be able 
to configure the kernel for their system, and rebuild it with only 
the options they want enabled.

Most information  probably belongs in config.h, and to simplify the process
even further, we chould have an interactive configuration script (ever
seen Larry Wall's perl/rn etc configuration script?).


In any case, there should probably be a standard, intuitive naming 
of the macros defined in config.h - ie            

#define BLK_DRV_SD 

would enable the SCSI disk driver,

#define CHR_DRV_LP 

would enable the printer driver.

Drew Eckhardt's reboot works on my 386 with AMI ROM BIOS.  AMI didn't
work with other reboot patches.  However, the reboot invokes a series of
speaker beeps, fast sequence (faster than clicks when RESET and don't
test memory) Hard to send audio over INTERNET.  I don't know if beeps is
good or basd just different from three finger salute when running MS-DOS
might be IDE doing something and not speaker???  John

I have not had any difficulty with symbolic links, even when
they are in the PATH variable.  I am using a patched 0.12
with almost everything recompiled with gcc-1.40.  Kernel,
patches, and executables are available by anonymous ftp.

This should probably be in the FAQ : the "old" gcc looks in the same 
place all gcc's do when compiled "straight out of the box" so
to speak.  All binaries are searched for as /usr/local/lib/gcc-* 
first - so cpp would be /usr/local/lib/gcc-cpp

The "new" gcc assumes that the GNU programs are the standard 
system ones, and looks for them in the write place.

btw :   If you are having path problems, you can recompile gcc (very small) 
        by itself - all it is is a front end to cpp, cc1, ld, etc.

This is a simple question that I hope someone can answer:

        In the linux installation docs, it says linux can use
extended partitions.  My question is, how do I create non-extended
partitions?  Whenever I user MSDOS 5.0's fdisk, it only allows me
to create extended dos partitions.....am I suppose to use DOS's fdisk,
or something else????   Thanks for any answers!!

Subject: Hrm...Got the stuff, but how do I get it to Linux?
Date: Sat, 7 Mar 1992 06:25:43 GMT

I've ftp'd the files from tsx-11.mit.edu, ftp'd them again
out to a floppy on a pc, and then took them home, so basically
I've got a bunch of MSDOS 50 files out there.

Before I begin, I've got The latest version of Derk's SCSI 
driver boot and root images, but when I try to boot these 
(386 25, 4MB RAM, SCSI drive, Super VGA, both sizes of floppies)
(and the SCSI host is a future domain)
I get a kernel panic.  This doesn't surprise me much, since 
the code is designed for a ST0X card.  

I've got 2 questions, basically:
1) Is there anyway I can work on binaries under dos, then move the
binaries to Linux somehow, so that eventually, I could make my
own low-level interface with the future domain host adapter?

2) How does one get a file from MSDOS to Linux without mtools?
   Is kermit (ugh) already implemented?  Would I have to kermit a file
   to my Mac, start Linux, and kermit that file back?  *gasp*

I've looked through the install docs, and also the scsi.user.doc, but
couldn't find this info anywhere.  ( so close BUT...)

I can't wait to try this new thing out guys.
(the thought of linux strictly from floppy gives me hives...;)

later...

How do you partition the hard disk without any other OS? DOS is not
necessary, but if you don't want to use it, you'll need some other,
even much more expensive OS to prepare the system to take linux on the
HD.
