I have been having trouble making /dev/hd3 the root fs.  I have run
the exact same program on it that worked for .11, and the docs say
that that should work, but it doesn't.  I get Child ### died return
code 00ff (or ff00, I may be mixed up).  This is making it dificult
for me to bootstrap, bbecause ot course then I cannot take the root fs
floppy out to put in any programs at all, so I am _stuck_.  If anyone
else has encountered and remedied this problem, please get in touch
with me.  For anyone trying to debug such things, I can give a clearer
account of what happened.

Thanks for your help.

Few things:

1) Can someone create a tar file contain ALL the files in /pub/linux ?
2) Who is doing the TCP/IP (I'm not)
3) is someonr gonna do the IPC (like message queues) ? If not, I will.

Subject: Troubles with Partitions
Date: Sun, 19 Jan 1992 08:56:28 GMT

Hello NetLanders,

   Well earlier yesterday and today I was banging right along with Linux.
I was able to tell Linux to boot from the hard disk and mount the root from
the hard disk (/dev/hd1). I used ShoeLace to do this.

THEN I tried to activate swapping on /dev/hd2.  No joy.  mkswap told me I
couldn't use the second partition because it was a DOS extended partition.

So, I proceded to try to change the partition type with 'edpart', which
seemed to work, until I tried to re-boot using the hard disk.  NO JOY!

It now would not boot!  Fortunately I had a bootable rootable floppy, which
I then proceeded to boot from.  When I then ran 'fdisk', it said that 
/dev/hd3 and /dev/hd4 were my partitions instead of /dev/hd1 and /dev/hd2!!!!

"Well", I says to myself, "I can live with that.", so I proceeded to install
ShoeLace to use /dev/hd3 as the root.  No Joy.  Upon booting /dev/hd3, it
comes up and says that I still am trying to use /dev/hd1 after I've already
told it I want /dev/hd3!  Pretty wierd, eh kiddies?

So, unless someone has any ideas, I'll just have to run without Swapping
enabled until I or someone else figures out how to get mkswap to accept
a DOS 5 or DOS 3.3 extended partition!

   Any ideas?

   Thanks!

There is no real consensus on whether partition #1 is the first
partition on the disk, or is the first entry in the partition
table.  Some parition programs sort this information on the
screen only, some will write the sorted information back to the
hard disk.  Linux assumes that the first entry is hd1, and so
if some utility starts sorting/reordering the table these things
can change.

A useful hack is to make each of your partitions a different size.
Then after any editting or possible change to the partition table
you can boot a floppy system and run fdisk (linux's, not DOS) to
see if the assignments still hold.

The 16 bit FAT DOS(4) Extension selection in edpart is acceptable
to linux for both the regular file system partitions and swap space.
These are not the same as the extended dos partitions that can
contain multiple logical volumes which linux objects to.

At least it works for me.

Are you sure you updated the utilities and /dev (it changed
significantly in 0.12) before trying to boot the hard disk?
Note that the cp +recursive command has changed behavior
between 0.11 and 0.12, and if you use the 0.11 installation
instructions to do the copy, it will put the new files in
the wrong places.  Watch to make sure that the file get
copied to /bin, /dev, and not to /bin/bin or /dev/dev.

The relevant change is:
0.11: cp +recursive +verbose /$i $i
0.12: cp +recursive +verbose /$i .

I seem to remember reading somewhere in this newsgroup that zmodem had been
used successfully with Linux.  However, I really don't know any more about
that.  I can, perhaps, help you speed up kermit, though...

At the kermit prompt, try typing "set send pack 1000" and "set rec pack 1000".
Do this on both ends of the connection.  This will allow you to use 1000
character packets, making the transfer speed much closer to that of Ymodem
(1k-Xmodem).  Not all versions of kermit support the extended length packets.
I know that MS-Dos kermit does, and the Unix kermit we are using here at WPI
does.  Also, you may notice that newer versions of kermit claim to let you up
the packet length to 2000 characters.  I have never gotten kermit to work with
anything greater than 1000 character packets, and I mean 1000, not 1024. 
Anyway, try it.  I think you'll find kermit much more livable.

Ok, I found my problem.  When I did my

cp +recursive...
to copy the root filesystem to hd3, bin/sh only got half written.

I think that this is a problem with my hard drive, not with linux.  I
have been unable to copy the file over, because every time I try, I
get a kernel panic, which I will reproduce here:

Kernel panic: HD controller not ready

Subject: Shoelace help required
Date: 19 Jan 92 19:03:30 GMT


I wasn't able to get shoelace to work.  The trouble is that I don't know 
or understand minix stuff, so the instructions were confusing. 
Here's what I did: what is missing?

1. I managed to get Linux 0.12 installed and working well on hd3,
booting from my bootimag floppy (1.2Mb: I defined a /dev/floppy0
for this.)  I've had no trouble installing utilities, vi, etc., using
rawrite and tar.

2. Working through the readme file on shoelace (from minix, apparently),
and skipping the floppy testing (I understand DOS MBRs and boot sectors,
and figured I wouldn't mess my hard drive) the only commands that it 
seemed I had to do were

   laceup /dev/hd3 wini

and

   laceup -w 3 /dev/hd0

What this achieved is a correct "winiboot", in that on startup I select
between partition 1 and 3 (DOS or Linux), but when I select Linux the
system doesn't boot because it can't find the kernal, then it can't
find the loadimage either.  It seems the steps I took don't actually
get the "bootimag" of the floppy disk onto the HD, so the kernal is never
loaded.

The screen I get looks like this (retyped by hand)

=====================================

I tried copying the bootimag file to /usr/src/linux/linux/Image, and
also tried the (bootimag - the first sector), but these don't work either.
Somewhere I am missing a step.  The partitions are fine, but the kernal
is not found on the hard disk.  Assumably it is in my bootimag on the
floppy.  How do I put it onto the hard disk? 

Meanwhile I can still boot from the floppy, etc., or get DOS running no
problem.

Tim.

Date: 19 Jan 92 18:46:16 GMT

First of all, linux is wonderful! Congratulations to its authors.
I've been running linux 0.12 for a couple of days now, and am ready to chuck 
my minix and dos partitions so I can use them for linux. (I'm running on a 
laptop with a 40M disk).

Now for the obligatory bug report:

It looks like the floppy device driver has no timeout to handle problems with
the floppy disk. Here are two scenarios I encountered:

1. Leave the floppy door open and type "cp any_handy_file /dev/floppy0".
   The kernel hangs (ie, won't let me kill the program with ctl-c)
   until a diskette is placed in the drive and the door is closed.

2. Try to copy more blocks to a diskette than it can hold.
   The kernel emits an endless stream of "floppy reset called" messages
   and never returns control to the shell. Reboot time.
   (Actually, I'm not sure if this condition is caused by writing too many 
   blocks, or by encountering a bad block on the diskette -- at any rate, 
   the kernel should give up after some small number of "reset" attempts 
   instead of looping forever).

These are nits, but a slightly scarier bug seems to involve "uncompress":

Under certain conditions (end of file?) when running uncompress, the
machine gets very quiet (the command seems to have completed, but the shell 
prompt doesn't return) for about 30 seconds (until "update" runs?) at which
time I get "out of swap space" or something like that. The shell starts
running again and everything is fine. I think this is a known bug in estdio.
I'll try digging out the fix from the minix archives and recompiling estdio
and uncompress.

articles from alt.os.linux, it's probably a safe bet to start posting
there, especially if you see a copy of this message on alt.os.linux on
your site.

People who sent mail to me request to be on the mail digest should have

      - Does Linux use TSS segments to provide multitasking?

Yes.

      - If not, is the kernel fairly 'easy' to read that building a
        'BIOS' emulator wouldn't mean having to rewrite everything.

Do you mean a DOS emulation mode?  It's not impossible, but due to the
way the 386 chips work, each 8086 task would have to have its own set of
page tables, and you would have to put in routines to intercept and deal
with I/O instructions, BIOS calls, etc.  It's probably more difficult
that you think...

      - Does Linux work on IDE drives?  I have a 80meg IDE drive
        (user-defined in the BIOS) and it doesn't work with the
        at-wini.c in Minix 1.3.

Yes; IDE drives work just fine.  (I using one on my system.)

      - How big is the 'complete' Linux package?

Well, the boot and root image disketts are about 750k compressed.  The
kernel sources are about 200k compressed, and the libc sources are
another 170k compressed.  The GNU C compiler is 670k, and the other
miscellaneous unix utilities are probably a bit over a megabyte.

Now add sources to whatever you want to port and compile yourself.  The
sources to GNU emacs are about 3 megabytes, compressed.  Groff (a troff
replacement) is just over 1 megabyte.

If you think this is big, remember that the OS/2 2.0 Limited Availability
release is 20 1.44 megabyte diskettes.

      - I don't have FTP access.  Any dial-up systems that I could pick it
        off of?  (i'm at 2400 MNP5/v.42/v.42bis)

I suggest you find a friend with FTP access; I think it's a bit too big
to comfortably grab via a modem.  After February 1st, I *may* be willing
to ship Linux distribution diskettes to people without net access for
some distribution fee (probably around US$ 5.00/diskette plus S/H).
(The price reflects the fact that I don't have fancy duplicating
equipment, and I want to encourage people who have friends with net
access to get it via FTP. :-)
