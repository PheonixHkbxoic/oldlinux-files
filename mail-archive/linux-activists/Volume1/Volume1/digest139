This is a function of the shell.  BASH supports job control, ash

Subject: Bad kernel build (0.95a) with GCC 1.40! Why????
Date: Mon, 23 Mar 1992 08:36:55 GMT

Today I ventured into build the kernel for Linuc 0.95a with
GCC 1.40.  I edit some of the makefiles so that the -fcombine-regs
flag was set and I did the make.  Everything compiled fine so I decided
to try it out.  I booted up with the new image and everything seems to
work except for the fact that some of the keyboard keys produce the
wrong characters (i.e. pressing / produces -).  Does anyone know why
this is happening?  Am I supposed to be using GCC 2.0?  If so, what
is the status of GCC 2.0? (Alpha, Beta???), and can it be used reliably
with Linux?  Thanks,

After ftp'ing a few megs, I installed Linux 0.95a this weekend on my
machine: Micronics board, 386-20, 2 MB RAM, HGC, 5.25 and 3.5 inch
drives and a WD 1006 with a Micropolis 70 MB MFM winchester drive.
(and lots of dust from over three years, but I doubt that counts:)

The rootimage was very helpful, I needed only a short while until the
machine booted the first time with root fs on winchester.  Everything
uncompressed fine and worked on first try.

When I copy *really* big files, like creating the swap file, I sometimes
get "HD timeout" messages.  Is this a warning or an error (read: can I
ignore it)?

After years with MINIX, I had to try out what might happen, if I start
two compilers parallel.  I got a trashing machine, as expected :)  But
something else happened as well:

   Warning, pid 1450 older sibling 10 has mismatched ys link
   Warning, pid 1450 younger sibling 10 has mismatched os link

What does that mean?  It happens from time to time, if the machine starts
thrashing.

When I try to compile the kernel, compiling fork.c will get aborted by
"Program got fatal signal 2615".  I tried to compile this, and a a few
more file without -O and finally got an Image file of 215552 bytes.  I
copied this file to /dev/at0 and rebooted the machine.  After printing
the usual information Loading .....  and number of ptys, I got a kernel
panic from swapper, trying to free unused page or similar (sorry, I'm
typing from memory).  I can give more information, if I didn't make a
wellknown mistake...  I used gcc 1.40 (newgcc) for compiling.

btw: Doesn't Linux create a core dump when a program produces a
segmentation fault?

There seems to be no putenv and no regex in the library, right?

Everything else seems to work fine, just now I am writing this article with
Origami, wnews and wmail only needed slightly changes (grrr, MINIX specific
code).  I am impressed of the speed of Linux, if I would have known that
earlier, I would have changed earlier, no matter how much bugs the older
versions had and I am really looking forward to the possibility of compiling
the kernel.

Reply-To: u31b3hs@messua.informatik.rwth-aachen.de (Michael Haardt)

I currently have two curses libraries, BSD curses which came with Linux
and a PD curses package, which has its origin in PC curses and ncurses.

I think BSD curses is awful old and 7 bit characters are a pain.  On the
other side, it is standard.

The PD curses has a few minor bugs, but I used it under MINIX for example
to compile sokoban, rogue and a few other games.  The weak points are the
print/scan functions (no ANSI way to pass arguments) and such things.  Its
features are support of ACS characters like SYS V and 8 bit characters with
standout, underline, bold etc.

If there is no other curses library, I will work more on this PD curses,
because I really need a curses lib.  Any comments?

Hi Linuxers,

I've got a problem with the keymapping when using kermit to connect from my

        If and when x11 is ported to Linux .. what will this mean.
From my reading of the faq s in comp.windows.x the 2 major intefaces
Motif and OPEN LOOK appear to both be commercial products.
        (I may be wrong!)

        Second question (and here I really display my ignorance)
how much work is involved in porting X? I suppose the OS will have
to be a bit more stable than it is now before work can really begin.
        Could someone estimate a time frame ( always a dangerous

Kernel support for networking doesn't have to be all-or-nothing. A
number of people (Clark, for one) have suggested putting just
multiplexing facilities in the kernel, and then doing the rest as a
library within the destination user process. For TCP/IP this would
mean putting all of IP and the connection control block lookup for TCP
into the kernel.

Some advantages are:

 - performance - you don't have to go kernel -> user process 1 -> user
   process 2

 - debugging is easier than full kernel implementation, although not
   as easy as full user process method.

 - "standard" TCP, RPC, etc. be supplied in shared library, but
   applications would be able to use custom tuned implementations as
   well. (see IEEE Network 1/92, article on RPC performance, for a
   good example of why you might want this)

Just a thought...

Some bizarre is going on with the HD timeouts, I think.  I get the
same problem running GCC (DJGPP) under DOS, which is also 32bit.
Every so often, I get a ``not ready error reading drive C:'' Of
course, that absurd.  I also get the same error when running some
programs compiled with GCC (DEMACS, e.g.).  BTW, my machine is a Dell
325D ('385 at 25MHz), with a Seagate (yuk) 110ish HD (IDE).

The bottom line is there's no reason the HD should timeout, or be not
ready.  I've spoken to Dell repeatedly about this matter.  The first
time they told me the software was as fault.  The second time they
told me there was a problem in their BIOS.  When they sent me the new
BIOS, the problem changed its manifestation, but was not repaired.
(Now whenever I get the error, the HD jumps to track 470 and stays
there.)  I spoke with tech support yesterday (but to my great surprise
got someone who didn't speak enough English to communicate.  What's
happening to Dell?)  He told me that one of their super-gurus said
it was either a problem on the motherboard or a problem with the HD.
They will replace the motherboard me.

Whatever the case, something screwy is going on.  I suspect problems
of a similar nature may be plaguing Linux.

Comments?  Suggestions?

This brings up something I've been meaning to ask.  Are you (or anyone

possibly even fully patched set of sources.  I'm mostly thinking about
bug-fixes here but we might want to also include an alternate set of
"expirmental" patches (and source) with the caveat that they may or
may not be included (at Linus' discretion) in the next release.

What I'm hoping to avoid is the "patch anxiety" experienced by users
like me who get a bit antsy when their kernel reaches a certain level
of patches.  I remember when the patches to 0.12 started to overlap.
They appeared to work but I didn't feel very secure.

I actually got 386BSD up and running.  It is a *MESS*.  People have compared
it to linux a year ago.  Perhaps.  Perhaps even worse.  I recommend that
anyone interested in 386BSD test it (yeah, blow away your hard drive, see if
I care), then watch it fail, "extra interrupt", hang, core dump, etc etc.
I am sure that in time, it will develop into a "good thing", but right now..

                                     NOT!

My thoughts:  Get the WD8003 code out of 386BSD, get TCP/IP working.  Linux
beats the pants off of 386BSD at this point.

Subject: minor linux 0.95a bugs
Date: 23 Mar 92 16:43:50



Hi Linuxers,

While playing around with the Linux0.95a images I found a few minor bugs.

 - At boot-time, when I am asked if I wish to select any VGA mode or
   just press any key to stay at 80x25, I noticed that some keys will
   keep the system from reading the root-image (i.e. the arrow-down key).
   BTW: In the upper right corner appeared EGAm instead of EGAc...

 - The backspace-problem appears even on a virtual console where backspace
   worked at first when I log out and try to log in again.

 - Has anybody tried to fill up the process table yet? O.K. this is what
   I tried: I started about 55 shells from the same virtual console :-)
   The last shell I started neither gave me a prompt nor printed any
   error message. Pressing ScrollLock showed that I had 58 processes.
   Switching to another virtual console where I also was logged in I still
   could start processes, but after a few seconds I got error messages
   like memory fault or out of memory or out of swap space (certainly,
   running from diskettes, I didn't have swapping enabled).
   Maybe I just ran out of memory but I think even then, this behaviour
   is, if not a bug, a little bit strange.
   BTW: We should get a /bin/kill in the root image :-}

 - One more bug: If I press ScrollLock and stay on the key for a few seconds,
   I get a few dumps from the process table, then the kernel hangs and
   prints:

     general protection: 0014
     EIP   : 0008:0000c166
     EFLAGS: 00010086
     fs: 0010
     base: 0076ffff, limit: 00000018
     Pid: 0, process nr: 0
     8e e0 ff 05 b0 a1 02 00 b0 20
     Kernel Panic: free_page_tables called with wrong alignment
     In swapper task - not syncing

   Looks like a real bug, doesn't it?

I was running Linux on a 386sx 20Mhz board with 32kB cache and 4 Mb RAM.

Linux is really great, thank you Linus and all the others!
