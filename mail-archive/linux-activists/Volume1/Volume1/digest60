A while back I uploaded a new set of the GNU Text Utilties to TSX-11,
with the fixed sort, so if you've still got the bad sort from the
previous upload available, you will want to at least grab the seperate
sort that has been uploaded.  If you're looking for all the neat GNU
text utilities (such as sort, cut, paste, join, head, tail, wc, cmp,
and most of the other basic text filters on unix systems), just grab

        tsx-11.mit.edu:pub/linux/binaries/usr.bin/text-1.1.tar.Z

I compiled the GNU bc utility, which is "an arbitrary precision
calculator language," and is part of the POSIX draft standard.  It
appears to work fine, but I'm open to criticisms....  Find it as:

        tsx-11.mit.edu:pub/linux/binaries/usr.bin/bc.tar.Z

Next, I compiled the GNU fgrep for Linux.  It's not part of POSIX
(since it duplicates (e)grep to a large degree, but it is a fairly
fast, fairly small grep for those cramped for disk space or just
love having all sorts of extra utilties around.  (It seems like my
Linux partitions are empty!)  You can find it as:

        tsx-11.mit.edu:pub/linux/binaries/usr.bin/fgrep.tar.Z

Lastly, I've been playing around compiling games/other fun stuff on
Linux lately, and I've come up with rain (BSD), larn (pd), and best
of all: worms (BSD), which I've modified to have _color_ worms!  So,
worms and rain, at least, will show up on TSX-11 in the near future.
(Once I apply the color diffs to my system so I can fix worms' colors, 
and fix a small problem with worms (it crashes mightily if you try
and tell it how many worms to use.  Sigh.).)  <- I've been programming
too much!

Uh, I beg to differ on that.  I'm running 1024x768 8-bit X11r4 here on
ISC's SysV 3.2.  It performs as well as the Sparcs that I've seen which
do not have acceleration (accelerated Sparcs I have not seen).  It runs
*faster* than the DecStation 3100.  It is true that Thomas Roell did a
masterful job of porting X to SysV 386, but there are a lot improvements
in X11r5 for general performance, and I'd say that linux already is or
soon will be faster than the dreaded monolithic AT&T kernel.

I have had mixed results with different systems.  Here are some results
I've had:

4meg 64K cache  Gateway 386/33    bootimage floppy gives results like above

8meg,64K cache  Gateway 486/33    no problems

4meg 64K cache  DTK 486/33 motherboard - works fine in slow-speed, but will
                crash as soon as any key is pressed if the system
                is put into turbo speed.  (Will read the bootimage
                floppy in turbo speed, but crashes as soon as the
                rootimage floppy is inserted).
 
    The Gateway's are not mine, the DTK is, so I'd certainly be
very interested if anyone has any ideas on getting it to run on 
the DTK motherboard at the high speed.

This is very similar to the problems I have trying to run on my DTK 486/33 
motherboard in turbo speed.  If you have a turbo switch, try running it in
the non-turbo speed.  That works for me (no idea why, though.)

    Most of the time, I get tons of messages scrolling off the screen too fast
to see, but this last time, it was within one screenfull, so in case it's of any help, here's what I see after trying to boot at high speed:

Any chance for the sources, or diffs to the sources, to be posted?
I'm one of those foolish people that don't like having only binaries.
I like having the sources and compiling the stuff myself if at all
possible.

This sounds like the problem with read()'s not bloking on tty's.
The fix is to put a select before the read() in ckutio.c in myfillbuf().
I've got the latest version of kermit to run fine under Linux with just
a few changes, including the above fix.  As soon as I get a chance to
get on my system long enough to load the diffs and sources to our local
anon ftp server I'll get them there.

I'm keeping a mirror of the nic.funet.fi and tsx.mit.edu files at
ftp.math.ksu.edu in /pub/linux/. I tar'd the files in the tsx/binaries
and tsx/sources directories for ease of downloading and put them in
/pub/linux/tsx_tar_files/. These two files will enable you to get most
of the distribution; you will still need to get the /pub/tsx/INSTALL
/pub/tsx/patches etc...

These tar files exclude all directories with OLD distribution files.
Note also that they do contain symbolic links to other directories not
included in the tar files. binaries.tar and sources.tar are both
around 4.8Mb, compressing does not help.

BTW, version 1.1 of poe's init is in /pub/linux/misc/poeigl-1.1.tar.Z.

I've not been keeping up to date with Linux recently, and I've just
tried to fetch all of Linux v. 0.12, with patches.  I tried
nic.funet.fi, tsx-11.mit.edu and src.doc.ic.ac.uk (a miror of nic).  It
all came down to guessing which files were important in the end, as I
really haven't a clue which files I needed and which I didn't.  At
tsx-11, there were three versions of find, and the middle one of the
three was the only one in the OLD directory.  At nic, there appears to
be both archives of source and source file by file, which would be OK
except there are several tar files with no idea as to what's in them.  A
few hints as to what's worth fetching in the README's wouldn't hurt.
In fact, if there's any interest and someone can get me up to date, I'll
keep a record of what the currently released bug fixes and extensions
are, and where they are.

I found a minor bug in the login program distributed with the
poeigl-package. If you enter more than seven characters at the
password prompt, the superfluous characters are passed to the shell.

I also added a putchar('\n') after reading the password, since
pressing return after the password doesn't echo as a newline.
