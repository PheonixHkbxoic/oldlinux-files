Someone mentioned a while back about going faster than 38400 on a serial port.
It's quite easy (in theory, at least) - edit the quotient table (near the
top of kernel/chr_dev/tty_ioctl.c) and replace the entries for 2304 (50 baud)
with 2 (57600 baud) and 1536 (75 baud) with 1 (115200).  You then
"#define B57600 B50" aand "#define B115200 B75" in your application, remake
the kernel, and everything should work.

BTW, the formula for converting baud rate divisors is 115,200 / baud_rate.
Works both ways, too...

I just looked at PATCH.DOC.  That's nice for tracking all patches, but
I'm looking for something more definitive though.  Something along the 
lines of:  "these are the recommended patches to the latest kernel for 
everyone running Linux."  The patches would be checked (and edited if 
necessary) to ensure they could be applied to a clean kernel automatically.
They would then be given identifying names like patch-0.95a-1, -2, etc.

Ideally, Linus would be the one to maintain such patches, but I'm sure
he's bsuy enough as it is.  Having someone else do it would keep Linus
free to continue kernel development (as long as he wants to, that is).
If nobody else volunteers, I'll do it.  Perhaps the patches and fully
patched kernel could be included in the upcoming ABC release.  What do
you think Alan?

This is a little program I wrote last night to patch linux boot diskettes
to boot from other devices without having to do the Norton/dd/whatever patch
stuff.  It won't work from the root diskette, because it has to be unmounted,
fixboot run, then re-mounted.  Maybe someone can fix this - it shouldn't be
very hard, but I've been busy with the Taylor-uucp port, and don't really have
time to hack it any further.

Not all shells have a built in kill.  However, consider what happens 
when the process table fills up.  If kill is a process, and the 
process table is full, it can't be started.  So, you wait for 
update to sync, if it hasn't been killed, and hit The Big Red Button.  

However, if kill is also available as an internal command in the shell,
you can free up enough processes to sync and reboot.

I can't offer any suggestions, but I'm having the same problem.  I posted a
message about it a few weeks ago, and only got a few mail responses which
weren't much help.
    My system runs at 33 MHz with no problem under MSDOS.  It's only under
Linux that it crashes at 33 MHz.   What motherboard are you using?  I have a
DTK 486-33 with 64K cache & 4 Megs RAM.

Hello linuxers,

Earlier I posted regarding problems with Jove, asking if anyone has
has similar problems.

I have found that Jove 4.14 compiled on my school HP-UX system
works fine with terminals supporting vt100 emulation at school
and Telix at home, but produces garbled screens with kermit
at under Linux over the modem, comparable to the garbled screens
I get when I run Jove on Linux.  In addition, less(1) doesn't work
properly over the modem, and some screen-manipulation characters
printed on startup don't work. :-(

I'm wondering if anyone has had similar (or contrary) experiences.
I plan to investigate the nature of the emulations defects as
time permits.

With all the fancy things going in to Linux these days, let's not
forget the simpler important ones such as terminal emulation that
is either 1) standard or 2) accurately represented in termcap.

Cheers, :-)

David.

You can't run an asynchronous port reliably with a divisor of 1.  It has
to do with how the chip samples the analog signal -- you need divide by 2
at least.  So 57600 is about the upper limit on PC hardware.  And with kernel
and interrupt latency, that's pushing it.

Is it possible that the problem stems from the bus speed?  Many
machines run faster than the standard 8MHz, and some peripherals (HD,
e.g.), start to act flakey at higher speeds.

Dilemma: I have a maxtor 600 MB drive with Ultrastor 12F esdi ctrlr.
The controller offers me track mapping, which, when invoked, fools
(DOS) into thinking it only has 1024 cyl (increases sectors/trk
accordingly).

BUT, Linux, like all other good Unix systems, won't run with the
controller in mapped mode.  Thus, I can only use 300+/- MB of
my disk.

Is there anything I/we can do to take advantage of the track
mapping?  I assume one would have to use the controller's
BIOS in some way. right?/wrong?

I'm willing to do some work myself - give me a place to start looking.

As far as I can tell, Linux doesn't care what kind of partition you
use, except for extended partitions.  Extended partitions are a hack
to allow more than 4 partitions: they are a single large partition
that contains an arbitrary number of "logical partitions" embedded
inside.  Linux will try find all the logical partitions in the
extended partition and let you use them.  (With the right set of
patches, it will even succeed in this attempt.)  I recommend using
some partition types other than the normal DOS ones, just to avoid
confusing DOS, which in the newest releases only seems to want one
primary and one extended partition.  Minix looks like a good choice,
since the file system format is based on Minix.

Well, it ends up executing another program, so it's a tad slower - not
a real big deal, though.

Actually, it'd be nice if someone would whip up a small termcap-using
clear command.  It shouldn't end up being more than 5k with shared
libs, which is not too unacceptable, and that way it supports all
terminal types.

Hello, every one,

I know someone has asked this question before, and I read the replies. But
I still make it work.

I un-tared 2misc.tar.Z and 2lib.tar.Z under "/usr/" directory, and ran the
"inst2.0" came with "2lib.tar.Z", with no problem.

I saw "/usr/lib/shared/" has the library files soft-linked to ones in
"/usr/gcc2/lib/gcc/i386-linux/2.0".

Then I compiled a a simple "main(){puts("Hello, world!")}" program, by
calling "gcc hello.c" command. (This gcc is from gcc2 package, not newgcc).
The size of file "a.out" is 30,722.

Then I copied the gcc lib files to the directory "/lib", and compiled the
program again, (and removed the "a.out" file) and compiled the program
again. Its size is the same as before, not "~5k" as mentioned in one of the
replies to the previous help request to shared lib.

I am terribly confused about people's comments on the contents in directory
"/lib", one reply says:
        "shared library itself must be in /lib"
another one says:
        ".. copy /usr/gcc2/shared/lib/lib92.03.15 (or whatever the date
        is)"
and another one says:

        "/lib/what_this_version_of_the_shared_libraray_is_as_specified_in_crt0"
        
Are shared libary (libaries) in different files than the static ones, I saw
the  "inst2.0" script linking "/usr/lib/shared/*" and "/usr/lib/static/*"
to the same files?

Or is there a single piece of file containing the shared lib,
"lib92.03.15", which I cannot find from 2misc.tar.Z or 2lib.tar.Z?

Or it is something else?


Please help me out.


Thanks in advance.

        Dahai Li

    I'm not familiar with the Ultrastor controller per se, but I do have 2 ESDI
drives that have more than 1024 cylinders.  I have a Western Digital controller.
It offers a mapping scheme that translates both drives cylinser count to some-
where around a quarter of the actual numbers and changes other counts accord-
ingly.  Perhaps the Ultrastor has a similar mode.  Linux accepts this mapping
just fine.
