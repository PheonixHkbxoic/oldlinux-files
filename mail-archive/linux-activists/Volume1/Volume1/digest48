  Glenn Greers's mathlib-2.1.tar.Z is available from:

    suphys.physics.su.oz.au  in /Esix/src/math

  It requires using GAS and a 387 chip, but for you Linux'ers who have one,
this may be the ticket.  I haven't tried it out yet.

  BTW, whoever ported GCC to Linux (Linus? ;-)), there may have been a bug 
introduced into the optimizer code (-O).  It showed up when I tried to
compile the Crisp 2.2e (found at ftp.uu.net in /pub/crisp) editor.  The 
file window.c produced the error.  I'll post the output when I get time
later this week.  I've compiled window.c with gcc -O (v1.40) on Interactive
2.2.1 and Esix 4.0.3a with no problems.  On Linux 0.12, if I try 
"gcc -c window.c", then it compiles fine.

  I am anxious to get Crisp 2.2e working on Linux, but there are some 
system calls missing (putenv() and some floating point routines).

  Something else is wierd with gcc on Linux as well.  It seems that GCC
will choke on a function named "typeof" with a parse error.   GCC 1.40 on
Esix 4.0.3a and Interactive 2.2.1 does no such thing.

Twice I've put binaries from the Linux 0.12 distribution and tried
to run them, and each time the program simply quits with a
segmentation fault.  The first program was `mkswap' and the second
`kermit.'

I downloaded the files under DOS, (and then unTAR'd and uncompressed
Kermit), then TAR'd the files, also under dos.  (I had to unTAR and
reTAR kermit because my 2M isn't enough to uncompress it.)  Then I
used rawrite to write the tar file to a floppy, and tar under Linux to
get the files back.  Neither one runs.  (Yes, I chmod'd them).  Is
there somthing else I'm supposed to be doing??

I would like to see the Shadow Password stuff by John F. Haugh II, but
I had problems getting it to compile, even though Linux is System V compatible.
Then, when I finally got the first of the programs to compile (su), it
bombed out when I ran it.  Pretty strange.  I am guessing that the problem
was with malloc(0) or something similar.  However, by that time school
had set in and I haven't had time to get back to it for a a couple of
weeks now.

Does anyone else have time to take it over?  I got the BSD init to
work, but I'm afraid to tackle 'getty'.  If someone could get
'getty' and the Shadow Password stuff to work then we would have a 
NICE init/getty/login!!!!

More than the 64MB limit, it's the 64 tasks the worries me.  64 tasks fill
up quickly if you let a dozen users on the machine at once.  Please tell me
if I am reading more into your statement about 64 parcels than there really
is...

Of course, keeping the memory parceled out makes it easier for implementing
shared memory and some other kernal functions.


After trying a long shot...  I was finally able to get Linux to boot
on my machine!!!  I used bootimage*.12 and rootimage*.12 from tsx-11.mit.edu.
(used rawrite to make the disks...)  It would not work with drive A as a
1.2meg drive.  I switched my A and B drives so that A is now 3 1/2 and B
is 5 1/4, made new boot disks and...  it worked!  Any ideas why Linux
wouldn't boot for me on a 5 1/4" 1.2meg drive?

I too had interesting responses from the Linux distribution.  I tried
the 0.12 from the mit ftp site (and also double checked w/ a source
from the .fi site) and rawrite it to a 1.2 MB 5.25 floppy. Upon
booting off of the floppy (assigned Drive A), I got:


|-
Loa

(as in Control character that looks like a |- and a Loa as in Loading...)
Then, freeze-city.

Version 0.11 gives me a little more response...sort of;-) I get the
full Loading... message and about 4 seconds of disk seeking...then hang city.

>BTW:  Dell 325D 386 at 25MHz with 2M.

Since I'm running a Gateway 486/25 system packed into a tower, 8 MB RAM,
and about as standard of 5.25 and 3.5 drives as you can get (Epson) along
w/ Phoenix BIOS, I'm running a rather "standard" clone - and pulling
my hair out on this one.

Any hints/ideas/suggestions/flames?

I'd like to see the reboot system call and a few programs like shutdown,
halt, fastboot, etc.  I'd even be willing to work on those if no one else
is currently doing it.

I have a really big phobia against using Ctrl-Alt-Del and hate having to
shut down linux that way.

I'd prefer someone to upload either the sources for a working make or
the diffs for a working make.  I've tried getting gnu make to work but
have been running into problems.

One major reason not to use pmake is that it doesn't understand RCS files
where gnu make does.  Since I've been doing everything in RCS using pmake
is a pain.  A working gnumake (say version 3.62 or so) would be great.

Subject: ctrl-alt-del doesn't reboot
Date: 12 Feb 92 02:56:06 GMT

I installed Linux this past weekend and have been enjoying being root
for the first time in my life, partitioning disks, etc.  Linux is
working pretty well on my setup: Gateway 463/33, 4MB RAM, 200MB IDE.
The only problem is that ctrl-alt-del does not reboot -- it only hangs
the machine.  This is true both with the original Image that I
downloaded and with an Image I built from sources.  If I hit Reset
after ctrl-alt-del, I get a warm boot, so I think ctrl-alt-del is
getting as far as sticking 1234h in the right place.  I compiled the
reboot sequence under DOS and that little program reboots the machine
nicely.  Can anyone shed any light on this problem?  If I could get
more information about the little-known interface between the keyboard
controller and the main CPU, I might be able to figure the problem out
on my own.  I know that on the original ATs, the keyboard controller
was involved in the protect-to-real mode switch.  If someone could tell
me how that was done I could just switch to real mode with CS:IP
pointing to FFFF:0000 (I don't want a 386/486 specific solution if
I can avoid it).

As a side note, how difficult would it be to have ctrl-alt-del do a
sync before rebooting?  Perhaps a hard-core Unix hacker is comfortable
with explicit syncs, but I find it a little crude.

Thanks for any information.  If I come up with a solution I'll post it.

Subject: kermit 5a-176
Date: 11 Feb 92 22:13:31

Well, I finally have kermit 5a up and running under linux.  The only major
change I had to make was to the tty reading.  Since read() doesn't block
when reading from a tty I had to add in a select() call so that kermit
didn't sit in a busy loop reading the serial line.

However, there is still a problem with kermit dropping a major amount of
characters at 9600 buad if anything else is going on.  It works fine so
long as it is the only thing running on the system (386sx-16, 4M).  Is
this a kernel problem or does kermit need to be more fine tuned.  Kermit
uses an internal buffer so that it can do reads of more than one character
at a time if they are there, so I am gussing that it is the kernel that
is losing the characters.  Is anyone working on a better tty driver?  This
is a must if SLIP or PPP is going to be used.

If anyone is interested I will put the sources, binaries and diffs on
our anon ftp server in the next day or so.  As soon as I can get it
all transferred back to the campus computers.  The address will be
matt.ksu.ksu.edu (129.130.1.64) and will be in /pub/linux.

 it should return the remainder of the string, but returns NULL.  I replaced
 the library strtok() with one written in C and things work much better.

 But... the tty line seems to be locking up (I noticed similar problems

 fine, and a doshell on the line doesn't have any problems.

I recently got the root and boot images of Linux 0.12 from tsx-11.mit.edu.
I use rawrite.exe to write them into floppy disks (with BIOS and Video
shadow RAM on my computer disabled).  When I boot up the computer with the

last two lines of message I got is :

Kernel panic : Trying to free up swapper memory
In swapper task - not syncing

Then nothing happened after that.

The machine I am using is an ACMA 486-25MHz with 4 MB RAM, one 80MB HD with

Well, if you're gonna use doubles, you should be allowed

However, one usually gets fewer floating point registers,
