The binaries are not on tsx-11.  To properly compile the mtools
package, you need to apply the patches that are in:
/pub/linux/ports/mtools-patches.tar.  I used the the patch
program from the tsx-11 archive in /pub/linux/binaries/usr.bin/patch.Z
to do this.  This also supposedly corrects a problem when reading
large DOS partitions.

hehe.. well,. currently i've been using one of the poly's 386sx's 16Mhz, 4mb 
ram with only a 40 mb hd.

as the machine is novell networked, all the dos bits etc are held off on the
fileserver so I simply partitioned the hard disk as follows

4mb dos active partition
27mb linux (filesystem/root)
9 mb for the memory swap space

i had to use utils like disk edit fromm norton utilities to hard code the
partition (9mb) into the dreaded dos-16 bit (honest guv) partition that was
required for the swap space.

so what happens is that for normal users in the poly all they ever see is dos
and the fact that the machine has been working completely normally for other
users is a) a relief and b) secure as they don't know (yet) how to get to linux
To get to linux i have a boot disk whick i have to insert into the floppy
drive which boots up the kernel. no probs. (anyone want to flame or correct
what i've said so far?)

PS. I've tried compiling mtools with the parameters etc required but i keep
errors, mainly from the striung handeling section. it could be that the 
string?.h includes i have are trash and i don't know about it, but if any kind
soul out there could mail me the binaries, for a a: = 1.44 b:=1.2 and c:=hd

You can get stats on the root file system, but only if you know the trick.
Some programs read /etc/mtab to see what file systems have been mounted.
mount(1) and umount(1) update this file.  The root file system, however,
is mounted by the kernel and no entry is made in mtab.

This doesn't require a kernel fix.  Simply add the line

>/dev/hd? /

to /etc/rc before you mount your other file systems.  (This will reset
/etc/mtab in case it was garbaged as well.  Naturally you use the correct
device name of your root partition, not ``?''.)

Now mount(1) without arguments will correctly report all mounted file
systems too.

As for df on the root file system, try ``df /dev/hd?'' instead of
``df /'' which won't work.

While trying to add swapping to files, I ran into the following problem that

It seems that all the files I ftp'ed had nothing in them indicating the
indicating the recommended or required path to install the files.  Is there
any reason the original tar files didn't have the correct path extensions?
If not, then wouldn't it be a good idea for the tar files to be remade
using the full path names, or at least relative path names from the root?

Not unless you change the bnoot sector.  When the PC boots, dl contains 
the drive number.  The boot sector can check this to see where it should
bootstrap the OS from.  However, in Linux this is hardcoded to 0.

You can edit the boot sector source or binary to hard code this to 
a 1, if space allows.

If you want more space, I would format a floppy )1.44MB) for b:, 
DOS format, do a mkfs on the B drive, and mount it under the
root directory on /mnt or something.

This will give you another megabyte + hunk of space if you want it.

Subject: ctype.h isn't ANSI compliant
Date: 24 Jan 92 08:03:14 GMT

According to ANSI C and POSIX, the definitions in ctype.h should be
functions, not macros.

Fortunately, this is easy to fix, and gcc lets us do it with no loss in
performance.  Change the macro definitions to inline functions.  (If
standard C had inline functions we could flush macros with arguments
entirely -- the C implementation is a bad hack anyway).  Prepend the line
``#define inline'' to libc/ansi/ctype.c.  While we're at it, the chars
that should be ints problem (pointed out by someone else) could be fixed too.

I also recommend that the header files using the asm and inline keywords
be written to use __STRICT_ANSI__ so that programs can be compiled with
gcc -ansi.  For production use, Linux programs wouldn't use -ansi, but
for anyone developing software to run on other machines and compilers
this would be nice.  (Gcc's use of const and volatile on functions such
as exit in stdlib.h would also have to be ifdef'ed.)

Hello Linux'ers!

I am having a strange thing happen to me when I run BASH.  I was trying
to compile a software package so I tried to execute the 'configure' shell
script.  It keeps coming back and saying: 'configure: No such file or
directory'.  Well, I have checked VERY carefully multiple times and I
even typed './configure'.  THe file IS there...I can list it, 'ls' it, and
things like that.  The strange thing is that if I take the execute permissions
OFF....THEN I can execute it with no problems!  This is totally bizarre!
It seems to be checking the execute permissions on the file and if they
are set then it WON'T execute it!

Has anybody seen anything like this?  Other than that, things seem to be
working fine.

I'm currently working on 'init', 'getty', and 'login'.  So far I have
scrounged up 'init' and 'getty' from the network and I plan to use
the 'Shadow Password' programs to do all the login stuff.

I'm on the verge of testing it.

   Thanks!

Ummm...forgive me if I'm wrong, but I read in the Minix Commands directory that you are '...free
to modify the code...etc' as if it were a Public Domain set of commands.
The fact is that apart from UUENCODE/DECODE I haven't found any other Minix commands that'll
compile and run yet, so I'm not bothering with them.

        Help  :-)

        I used a program (or a set of programs) named Bootany.Zoo, or rather
        in that archive.  It was supposed to help me set up my hard drive so
        I could use multiple OSes under it at the same time, and select
        and bootup which one to use, et al.

        Unfortunately, either I didn't set it up right or it wasn't compatible
        with my hardware set up or something along those lines.  Irregardless,
        my hard drive is now completely inaccessable.  When I boot up via
        my hard drive, it gives me the list of function keys and the OSes,
        but it doesn't even *try* to boot anything up when I hit the
        appropriate key.  I recently reformated and reinstalled dos onto the
        hard drive, using only one partition, and bootany didn't go away
        (like I was hoping, having completely reformed the hard drive), and
        it still didn't work.  It just tried to access by floppy drive
        unendingly after that.

        Could someone knowledgable or the author(s) of these programs please
        write a program that would write back to the boot sectors of a hard
        drive the original information, so bootany could be undone?  I'm
        desperate, here, I'd love to have access to my hard drive back.  Its
        *my* opinion that distributing such a program with Bootany.Zoo would
        be a Good Thing (tm) if only for the fact that people could UNDO
        what Bootany does, in this case, destructively.

        Can anyone help?

No, but it /does/ have to be at VIRTUAL address 0.  Thus it IS a special
task: all other linux tasks are given 64M slices of the 4GB address
space, and can use segments to keep them off each others (and make them
beleive they are at address 0).  Not so a V86 task.  Other unices
haven't got this problem, as they use a flat 32-bit address space, and
change page tables when they change tasks: linux doesn't.  This has some
problems, but I'm willing to bet that linux has the simplest mm of any
unix that implementes paging/sharing/demand-loading/VM on a 386.  And
frankly, simplicity is the name of the game when you try to implement a
kernel from scratch.

I like the 386 chip (but x86, x<3 are pure sh*t, gimme 68k any day), but
there are two problems with it: write-protected pages are ignored in
kernel mode (corrected in the 486), and V86 cannot be relocated to an
arbitrary virtual address.  That's ok if you use only paging to
implement memory management, but frankly, I'd like to see something
where V86 can live /inside/ a 386-segment.  Remember: linux isn't really
unix: it's a operating system I wrote with the unix API in mind, and I
didn't do it the same way everybody else did.

Incorrect.  The ANSI standard allows any standard library functions to be
defined as macros, *provided* that there is a fall-back "real" function that
can be accessed by #undef'ing the symbol.

<ctype.h> is ANSI compliant, in this sense, if there is also an underlying
set of real functions, in addition to the macros.

Over the next few days, I will be putting together a full 'release' of Linux,
including correct paths to files, versions as new as I can find, etc etc.

The FTP host will be banjo.concert.net, in the directory /pub/Linux/release.

I plan to have tar files for each of the major parts, as well as a full
directory tree so you can pull out the parts you need.

I will also be re-writing the installation instructions to some point to
reflect my work.

One thing I would like to see is a plan for standardized submissions to the
archives.  If anyone would care to help me out with this, please drop me some
e-mail.
