/***********************************************************/
This is as far as I have got (full backups of 2 partitions onto a
stack of floppies is neither quick nor fun :-(. I would be grateful
for any comments, corrections etc and, the only thing I ask is that
you don't mail me the whole thing with the odd one line change.... my
mailbox isn't built for that sort of volume and it is not necessary.
So changes/comments only please.

                   A Beginner's Guide to Linux
                   ---------------------------

Purpose
=======

        This document is intended to be a complete beginner's guide to the
installation and running of Linux (a free Unix clone) and, as such,
tries to make as few assumptions as possible. However, some familiarity
with Unix at an "ordinary user" level (i.e. no sysadmin experience) is
assumed/required but I'll try to keep to a "hand-holding" level for anything
out of the ordinary. I don't intend this as a technical reference
guide, merely something to get you started and keep you clear of trouble!

        I hope to cover everything you need to get "up and running"
but if not please let me know so that I can change things. Similarly,
if there is anything you think is a "must know", a useful tip, or a
waste of space please let me know so I can do something about it.
Email is best 'cos I can't guarantee to see all the stuff posted to
alt/comp.os.linux. 

          Hope this helps and happy hacking,

                        Iain Reid [Iain_Reid@ed.ac.uk]

p.s. This document is quite big (and has a lot of information in it
     hopefully) so you might find it useful to print it out. I know
     this is damaging to rainforests, aardvarks etc but then again do
     you really want to be stuck in the middle of something tricky
     with nothing to refer to if everything starts to go wrong?

/***********************************************************/
Required abilities
==================

        To get Linux and keep up to date with new releases you will need
to be able to get files from your nearest Linux archive site,
uncompress some of them and transfer them to a DOS filesystem. If you
don't know how to do this you should ask someone at your local site to
show you because the exact method used is highly dependant on your
local hardware and software.

        All the files and utilities mentioned should be available from the
Linux archive sites.
/***********************************************************/

Ok, ready to start.... First and foremost....

BACKUP EVERYTHING!!!!!! 

I don't expect you to have problems but if you do then why risk losing
everything? You'll need to do this before installing to hard disk
anyway so why not do it now?

1. Preliminary testing (otherwise known as 10 steps to happiness)
======================

Q. Will Linux run on my hardware?
A. If you have a 386Sx or above with 2 or more megabytes of memory
   then the chances are that Linux will run but the easiest way to
   check is to try running from floppy.

You will need - the current bootimage (bootimage-0.96.Z)
              - the current rootimage (rootimage-0.95.Z)
              - rawrite.exe (a utility to write the boot & root images
                to floppy from within DOS)
              - Two formatted floppies (2 x 1.2 Mb or 2 x 1.44 Mb but
                both must be the same capacity)

        It's up to you whether you use 1.2 Mb or 1.44 Mb disks but you
should use whichever type you can boot your machine from. For example,
my disk drives (under DOS) are

   A: 3.5" 1.44 Mb floppy drive [ bootable ]
   B: 5.25" 1.2 Mb floppy drive [ NOT bootable]
   C: 110 Mb IDE Hard Disk [ bootable ]

In my BIOS setup program I can choose to boot from drive A or C so I
would choose 1.44 Mb floppy disks.

What to do:

   1. Get the three files listed above from your nearest archive site.
   2. Uncompress the boot and root images and transfer them plus
      rawrite.exe to DOS
   3. Run rawrite.exe and you should see something like the following
      (type bootimage or rootimage where prompted and use whichever
      drive you can boot from)

c:\> rawrite
Rawrite 1.2 - Write disk file to raw floppy diskette

Enter source file name: bootimage <RETURN>
Enter destination drive: a <RETURN>
Please insert a formatted diskette into drive A: and press -ENTER-:

    4. Save bootimage (about 200 Kbytes) and rootimage (about 1100
       Kbytes) to separate disks using rawrite as above. You should
       see some information about tracks and sectors and the numbers
       should keep changing until it is finished and the command
       prompt comes back. Bootimage is fairly quick to transfer but
       rootimage is sloooooow so leave it running and have a cup of
       tea or something.

    5. Reboot your machine with the boot floppy (i.e. the one with
       bootimage on it) in your floppy drive. If all goes well your
       floppy should whir a bit and the message "Loading...." should
       appear. The floppy will whir and click a bit more and some more
       dots should appear. On my machine this takes about 6 or 7
       seconds in total... it should be fairly quick. The following
       message should appear

Press <RETURN> to see SVGA-modes available or any other key to continue.

       and you may see something like EGAc in the top right corner of
       your screen. Things get slightly hazy for me here because Linux
       and my video card disagree about things but you can have a
       quick explore here if you wish. I have no idea what is supposed
       to happen, I just know that it dosn't happen for me :-(. Press
       return or any other key as instructed and you should see
       something like this

8 virtual consoles
4 pty's
Partition table ok.
Insert root floppy and press ENTER

    6. Put the root floppy (i.e. the one with the rootimage on it) in
       the drive and press enter. You should see something like the
       following although the numbers may be different)

52/1200 free blocks.
285/400 free inodes.
797 buffers = 816128 bytes buffer space
Free mem: 2621440 bytes

(none) login: 

        7. login as root (no password) and you should see

==================================================
        Welcome to linux version 0.95
==================================================
#

    8. Congratulations! Linux is now running (from floppy admittedly)
       on your system. The '#' is your command prompt so you can have
       a play now although there isn't very much on the root floppy.
       Something like this should work but this is about as exciting
       as it gets for now.

# cd /etc
# ls -l
 
       Don't worry about your floppy drive bursting into life at odd
       times (usually at least once every 30 seconds or so (see "sync"
       later on)).... this is normal.
 
[ You can run entirely from floppy but as you can see it really isn't
much fun so, if you like what you see, onwards ever onwards, otherwise
please think again... Linux really is gorgeous to use once you get it
set up. Still not convinced? Oh well, bye then ] 

    9. You now know that Linux will run on your processor so the next
       question is "Will it run on my hard disk?". To test this use
       the fdisk command

# fdisk

/dev/hda2:  69286 blocks active 16-bit DOS (>=32M)
/dev/hda3:  31710 blocks unknown partition type 0x9F
/dev/hda4:   8610 blocks unknown partition type 0x9F

        The messages you get will vary according to what you have set
        up on your hard disk but, if it tells you about any partitions
        (I have 3 as shown), then Linux can read at least part of your
        hard drive. This is good. If it barfs then things don't look
        so good and, if you think Linux should run on your hardware
        (see the info sheet at the archive sites), you should tell
        Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux) 'cos he needs to know
        such things. Please be very sure that it is supposed to run on
        your hardware before sending off that mailer tho' :-)

    10. Sync. This is an initially mysterious command which you must
        ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS run before you log out. What does it
        do? Well, in common with many unix systems, Linux stores some
        information in buffers in memory (remember those 797 buffers
        at bootup?). Some of it is to do with what's where on the disk
        so rebooting the machine without syncing (writing those
        buffers to disk) could leave you in a BIG mess. That's why you
        must ALWAYS sync. 'Nuff said?

# sync <RETURN>

Well, you've got this far so that means that 1. you can run Linux, 2.
your hard disk and Linux are on talking terms and 3. You're ready to
install to hard disk :-)
/***********************************************************/

Installing Linux on your hard disk
==================================

1. The theory 
=============

 - In common with just about every other operating system Linux operates
   best from hard disk although it can be run entirely from floppy if
   you are feeling particularly masochistic.
 
- The Linux file system is not comaptible with any other file system so it
  will need its own area on your hard disk. This area is known as a partition.

- Creating partitions is easy and trouble free (in theory :-))

2. The practice
===============

You will need: the current bootimage on disk (see above)
               the current rootimage on disk (see above)
               a disk partitioning program (e.g. edpart.exe for DOS)
               
1. Remember the bit where I suggested you backup everything? The bit you
   then promptly ignored 'cos as everyone knows, accidents only ever happen
   to other people and their hard disks. Backup everything now because
   first of all you're going to HAVE to rely on those backups in a
   minute, secondly, you may surprise yourself and in a fit of tired
   mindlessness do something which on reflection is unbelievably
   stupid (trust me, I know what I'm talking about here) and thirdly
   'cos you're going to be furious with yourself if something does go
   wrong and you haven't got any backups. So....

          !!!!!!!BACKUP ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING NOW!!!!!!!

   In theory it is possible to partition a disk without wiping out
   everything on it but it is not particularly easy to do properly and
   you're much safer with a backup on a stack of floppies/tape
   drive/another machine. I realise that this is not pleasant (I have a
   110 Mb hard disk and a BIG stack of high density floppies to prove it)
   but it is isn't worth the risk not to do it. The exact method you use
   is up to you but I what I did was 

1.1 Create a DOS bootable floppy and test it thoroughly (see your DOS
    manual for details). What you put on it is up to you but don't
    forget your partitioning program or pkunzip. Mine looks like this

a:\aliases.txt                  <-- stuff for 4DOS
a:\autoexec.bat
a:\command.com
a:\config.sys
a:\filelist                             <-- output from dir /FS c:\ under DOS

a:\DOS\ansi.sys
a:\DOS\attrib.exe
a:\DOS\emm386.exe
a:\DOS\fdisk.exe                <-- Just in case
a:\DOS\format.com               <-- Just in case
a:\DOS\himem.sys
a:\DOS\keyb.com
a:\DOS\keyboard.sys

a:\4DOS\4dos.com

a:\UTILS\edpart.exe             <-- disk partitioner.... don't forget it
a:\UTILS\emacs.rc               <-- startup file for MicroEmacs (ue.exe)
a:\UTILS\pkunzip.exe    <-- do NOT forget this
a:\UTILS\pkzipfix.exe
a:\UTILS\prune.com              <--
a:\UTILS\rawrite.exe    <--
a:\UTILS\ue.exe                 <-- Various non essential but handy utils
a:\UTILS\whereis.exe    <--
a:\UTILS\zipzap.exe             <--

1.2 Then I used the pkunzip with the -rP options to create many zip
    files of less than 1.44 Mb. [The -r means recurse into sub
    directories and the -P means store path information. Do not forget
    the path 'cos restoring without it is a nightmare.] As you zip
    things up remove the originals (if sensible i.e remove things like
    Windows directories but leave DOS) to make space for new zips (unless
    you have plenty of free hard disk).

1.3 Fill up your stack of floppies with whatever will fit. I had no
    disk with more than about 10K free on it by keeping my zips
    relatively small (i.e. try to avoid too many >500K zips).

[ You can use the DOS backup command to backup your hard disk but I have
  had problems with it from time to time so I prefer not to ]

2. Reboot your machine using your DOS bootable floppy. This is a bit
   slow but gets there in the end. Run edpart.exe (on the bootable
   floppy) and you should see something like the following

[to be continued]

That's about it so far.... if all goes well with my repartiotioning tonight
there should be a bit on that available soon but I need honest comments,
experiences with different setups etc, problems to make it usefull so put
fingers to keyboard and get writing :-)

Ah, but there is!  Read the group for a while, it'll turn up.
Or go look on your nearest linux archive site (I use tsx-11.mit.edu)
and FTP the docs from there.

Date: Tue, 17 Mar 1992 20:57:57 GMT

Well, I finally got the .95 kernel to compile, and I have a word of warning to
those, who, like me, edited their partition tables to put a bootable Linux
partition on that last unused 4M of their C: drive.

It's not enough to defrag and edit the partition tables; also edit the boot
record so DOS doesn't merrily assume it has the whole disk.  I found this out
after about the third time Linux and some of my documents had stomped each
other :-(.

Anyway, I was wondering if someone could please tell me the device numbers I
need for a 720K 3-1/2" a: drive and a 360K 5-1/4" b: drive (they're really HD
drives, but I'd like to be able to use my older DD disks with 'em).

I think that we should create a "how did I port ...." directory.
This list should be maintained at one of the FTP sites. Everyone who
ports something to linux should be requested to enter a file, with
information that will make it easier for the rest of us.
I'll give an example to make things clear:

Program ported:   Mtools.
Program version:  2.05
FTP site:         nic.funet.fi
Directory:        pub/...... (sorry, don't know right now)
Linux version:    0.12 & 0.95
Kernel patches:   NONE
program patches:  Edit devices.c for your configuration.
Makefile flags:   NONE
Warnings that can be ignored: NONE

Patches that were required should be included, except as in this case,
where the patch is configuration dependent.

Yes, it is ftp'able at this site:

in this directory:  pub/386BSD

this is very interesting stuff.  I like the ethernet board inclusion.  May

Hi.
I installed 0.95 yesterday and everything worked just fine, except kermit.
I entered kermit, set the line to "tty65" (com2), set the speed to 9600
and typed "connect". After hitting "return" a few times, the remote host
responed. A few seconds later I got the following error message:
"Can't get character: EAGAIN"
"[Back at Local System]"
and I was back at the C-Kermit prompt.
What went wrong and why.

I have recently installed 0.95 in my machine with a svga card based on the
trident 8800 chipset with 256k ram. Linux hasn't been waiting for keyboard
input at all, it presents the "Press <RETURN> to see SVGA modes" prompt,
but just just steps straight on an mounts the root file system.

I have no troubles using this card and config in 132*60 mode from DOS,
any suggestions as to what might be causing the problem ?
