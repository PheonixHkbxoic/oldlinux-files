All the machine has to be tuned for performance, not just the processor.
Without going into a religious war I think that Workstations are better
designed and tuned than ISA machines. 
Also.... how many have money to buy a 486 + BIG disk + Other fancy stuff
and DO NOT have the money to buy a commercial SysV ?

My point is just a list of priorityes
1) Get the interface between Linux and the outside world as complete as
   possible ( looking at POSIX and GNU stuff ) and at this stage
   FORGET about things like 64 tasks & 64Mb limits.
2) Implemet something that is easy emought to be TESTED by a simple user
   NOT by a company. ( I don't want a kernel that crashes ! )
3) After this is done THEN start adding fancy things.....
   But I am shure that It will be a long time to produce a STABLE kernel
   that includes TCP + Semaphores + Shared Mem.
   ( Are you following the thread about the Kernel crash while handling
   large files ?.... ) How easy will it be to debug if you had to dig
   around in many modules with a complex structure ?

Therefore.... Let's start building from SOLID ground instead of just adding
stuff hoping that it works. The problem is finding the BASIC requirements
for the kernel in order to be possible to add extra stuff in a CLEAN and
tested way.

Yup, One thing I really would like is conditional compilation.
Something like a list of features I would like in the kernel after all not
everybody may be able to run X11 ( Disk space ).

There is another point I would like to make.
As I see now more than one people would like to put in the kernel a kind of
"portable" interface to the ps command.
As usual in theory there is nothing wrong with this... BUT you are putting
into the kernel code that is NOT needed !
What CAN be done is a set of functions that LOOK into /dev/kmem and extract
the right informations. Your PS program will use this set of functions to
extract data from the kernel. When the kernel change the functions change
too. It has been implemented. It seems pretty good to me AND it leaves the
kernel intact. 
BTW: Using a library you can return list of malloc stuff VERY easly !

I, for example.

The cost of a commercial SysV (a complete system with at least the
compilers, tcp/ip and X) would be here about the same that my entire
system (486/33, 2x300 MB HD) thus far. I would also have to pay more
for every major O/S update I may need.

More importantly, this would also be a binaries only distribution.
I would be at the mercy of the software company with bug-fixes. With
linux I can (at least try to :) fix them myself. I can also add new
features to the system if I need.

There is also a very real danger of the s/w company going bankrupt,
and thus ceasing to support the product, in these days of recession.

Go ask drew@cs.colorado.edu (Drew Eckhardt), he has promised to write
a general SCSI driver and asked others to write the lowlevel ones.
I've been ready for quite some time. It's really trivial to take the

Greetings everyone.

Due to work, I have to upgrade banjo.concert.net from SunOS 4.1.1 to 4.1.2,
and the easiest way is to re-install from scratch.  This will take me about
a day to get everything back up right, so...

This upgrade impacts the linux-standards mailing list, and the anonymous

to get them going.

The system is a Gateway 2000 386/25 with a DTC 7287 controller, and hd7 is a

Help, please!

The solution to GNU-1.10 (also GNU tar-1.09) complaining on files
uncompressed where pads inserted in the download process [head -c <exact

Ok, I have received mail from a number of people concerning my problem
with getting linux to boot.  I have followed a number of suggestions,
but I still cannot get it working.  

Here is what I did:

Formatted a fresh 1.44mb floppy in drive a: (1.44mb 3.5" drive).
Used rawrite on a just downloaded (binary mode) bootimage.
Rebooted the machine.

It read the disk for a few seconds and then printed out:

|-
Loa


That is *exactly* what it showed (the top line is an ibm graphics
character (a sideways "T")).  I tried formatting with both DOS and
Norton, on other machines (PS/2), etc.   I have been unable to duplicate
the register dump that I had before.

This was most certainly a high-density disk in a high-density drive.  Is
there anybody else that has had this problem??  HELP!

I am a little confused by what you are saying.  You should read /dev/kmem with
the kvm_open, kvm_read, kvm_getproc, etc calls.  The ps program in SunOS uses
these routines.  If the kernel changes you rebuild ps with the new libkvm.a,
ps.o stays the same.  

I vote that /dev/kmem stays in Linux.  There should also be a kvm library
to support it.

I have users defined as "group" that have no problems on login, they end
