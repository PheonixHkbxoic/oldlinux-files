Hello Linuxers (Linuxians?),

Just a note to let you know I've ported some programs to Linux. Ted
Ts'o has kindly made them available from tsx-11.mit.edu
pub/linux/sources/usr.bin. The progams are:

flip1src.zip - no porting needed, this is a file filter by Rahoul Dhesi
that converts unix text files to msdos text files, very nice.

cawf2.zip
cawf2.cdiff - source and cdiffs to cawf, the C Amazingly Workable
Formatter, a small nroff clone that works fine to format man pages,
including its own.

install.tar.Z
install.cdiff - source and cdiffs to install, a utility sometimes
called by make to install programs, recently posted to comp.os.minix

Enjoy,

Subject: Questions about Linux
Date: 8 Feb 92 10:08:19 GMT

I got linux working on my machine. Wery great !!
I REALLY like it !!! Congratulation !

And now the other part of the news :-)
1) Into the FAQ is written that there is UK keyboard support.
   As it is from the distribution I have got from
   nic.funet.fi, release 0.12 there is no UK support.
   Can someone please tell me in which site the file keyboard.S
   has the UK support ? 

2) I understand that mintaining and updating an operating system
   is NOT easy but something has to be done.
   What I am referring to is the place where files should be.
   As it stands now somebody put files in /usr/local/lib...
   some files in /usr/bin/gnubin and so on.
   The problem with this is that the result a complete mess :-)
   I suggest that we follow some kind of de-facto standard and what
   come to mind is SunOS.
   The following schema would be nice
   /etc         { Administrative files included wtmp utmp ..    }
   /bin         { Essential files for maintenance               }
   /usr/bin     { The rest of the binary stuff cc, as, ld..     }
   /usr/uucp    { The uucp package ( when it is there :-)       }
   /usr/X11     { The X stuff when it is there  ....            }
   /usr/src/..  { This is the space for the source files        }
   /usr/src/linux       { The source for linux                  }
   /usr/src/lib         { The sources of libraries              }
   /usr/src/...         { The source of everything else         }
   /lib         { If shared lib then put here the ESSENTIAL     }
   /usr/lib     { All the rest of the stuff, X11 lib ...        }
   /tmp         { the usual volatile tmp                        }
   /usr/tmp     { The one used by everybody...                  }
   /home        { Under here there are the users                }
   /usr/local   { Here there is stiff LOCAL LOCAL LOCAL !       }
   /var         { The equivalent of /usr/spool                  }

3) Another thing that I would REALLY like is to AVOID to invent
   new names for existing things. I read an article about implementing
   pipes in Linux and the article said to call that "tube"...
   Why ? Why can't we keep the name pipe ?
   What is GREAT about Linux is that it try to conform as much as
   possible to the de-facto standards !
   This apply for values returned from functions, functions names
   and so on. The rule should be :
   See if what you want to do exists and if it does use the existing
   naming and conventions.
   This apply to the gnu compiler itself....
   Why call it gcc if it is the standard 'c' compiler ? it would
   be better to call it cc, ld, as .... since it is what the standard
   distribution delivers.

4) Is it possible to have the structure of the FTP sytes distribution
   rapresent the actual structure of the filesystem ?
   What  mean is that by this way we cut in downloading time
   since there is no duplicate of files.

5) I would like to write a program that does partitioning of HD
   from INSIDE linux. Something like the SunOS format program.
   This program should be into the install root disk and should
   allow the user to define the partitions of the HD.
   It should be possible since /dev/hd0 and /dev/hd5 can access all
   disk but I don't have informations about the structure of the 
   partitioning table. Can somebody send the partition table structure
   of DOS to me ?
   Even better, is there somebody that is already doing this ?

Thanks for your answers !
Thanks for your opinions
THANKS to Linus !

What you need is not short filenames, but a decent shell; one with filename
completion.  Tcsh (and bash and ksh I think) will complete filenames for
you if you hit a key (tab in tcsh), also, if you hit ^D in the middle of
typing a filename, the shell will show you all the files that match that
prefix.  Very nice, and problem solved.

I think _most_ people would agree that 14 characters just isn't enough for
consistent naming schemes.  For example, "linux-0.12.tar.Z".  Oops, too
long, we'll have to do some non-intuitive name-scrunching.  The ideal would
be to allow names long enough that we never have to think about the limit
in practice.

So, the question is, how long is enough.  Should we just bump the dir size
from 16 bytes to 32?  Well, that's _probably_ fine in _many_ cases.  How
about 64 bytes? Yeah, surely that's enough.  Certainly the 255 char
filename limit of the BSD filesystem is as good as infinity for
_human-generated_ filenames.

Well, as it turns out, a variable-length directory is usually more space
efficient than even the 16 byte entry, and is much better than 32 or 64
byte entries.

Of course, it's possible to argue that variable-length dirents are not
worth the added complexity in the filesystem, but for most people the
lifting of such an arbitrary limit as 14 is nothing but good news.

Cheers,
Jaime

Subject: More Miscellaneous new user questions
Date: Fri, 7 Feb 1992 16:42:21 GMT


Hi, I got LINUX 0.12 installed on an 8MB partition on my DOS C:
disk drive.  (/dev/hd3 uses cylinders > 1024, but that part
seems to be working just fine!)  My machine is a 25MHz 386-DX
with 4MB memory, an EEGA, a HS modem, a "bus" mouse, 4 serial
ports, and 2 broken printers B^).  My hard disks are a 70MB
and an 80MB (both with > 1024 cylinders) both MFM.

1) I've tried to run kermit, but I get no activity on the modem
(and no response from it either).  The modem is a USR-HST on
COM1 (oops, /dev/tty64).  Works just fine under DOS.  I added
/usr/spool/uucp to get rid of the "can't lock" msg, but when I
go into connection mode, nothing I type at the keyboard makes
it to the modem (the modem has lights and SD and RD remain OFF,
while TR, MR, CS, RS, AA are on).  The modem should respond to
any AT sequence sent at any baud rate, but just to be sure, I've
set the baud rate on /dev/tty64 with both stty and .kermrc.  No
luck just yet.  (I want to talk to the modem at 19200, but right
now I'll settle for ANY speed!)

2) Where can I find info on how to use gcc?  I've downloaded df.c
and I would like to compile it (couldn't find a df command in any
of the utils TAR files I've downloaded so far).  I'm not a UNIX
programmer, so please no responses that say it works just like
under UNIX!  Command line options and usage info needed.  I've
installed gcc in /usr/local/bin, and the rest of the gcc tar file
in /usr/local/lib.  The compiler seems to run, but I can't find
where it writes the executable, or how to tell it to leave me an
executable.

3) I put a "doshell /dev/tty2 /bin/sh&" into my /etc/rc file so
I can have another "user".  (Job control works nice too.)  But the
second user has a HOME=/, while the /dev/tty1 user has HOME=/usr/root.
This is just a minor annoyance right now.  I put links in / to the
profile files in /usr/root so the two users get setup the same
beyond a few environment variables.

4) I'm still booting from floppy (I patched the root device to /dev/hd3).
My machine boots in non-turbo mode (that's 10MHz instead of 25 MHz).
In order to put it into turbo mode, I have to hit CTRL ALT - during
POST (Thats: control alt minus).  Sometimes, if I don't hit it fast
enough, the boot reads this as my response to the super VGA modes
question.  Also, after LINUX is running, the CTRL ALT - doesn't
toggle the machine speed anymore.  Is LINUX no longer using the
keyboard BIOS in my machine?  I haven't tried the CTRL ALT ESC sequence
yet to see if I can still get into the BIOS SETUP program from LINUX.
Can you say "Thank-you DTK"?

5) I have an EEGA card capable of extended text and graphics modes
up to 800x600 and 132x44 with BIOS support.  Any chance the
SVGA select can be modified, maybe via a patchable table int the
bootimage?  Sure would be nice if there was a way to program the
EGA/VGA registers directly to control the available modes.  Then we
wouldn't be BIOS dependent (upon whether the BIOS supports a mode
or not!).  Maybe I should decode my video BIOS to see how this is
done?

6) All in all, this looks pretty damn good!  Keep up the good work.
I can hardly wait for UUCP, NEWS, and STREAMS (read SLIP).
Any chance of someone coming up with a DOS shell?  (aka SUN's on
their 386i workstations?)  I know it's probably a LOT of work and
there might be licensing issues (how about 4DOS instead?).  But
I use a financial package under DOS at home that I would really
like to keep access to without having to reboot the machine.

the libc.a can go either in usr/lib or usr/local/lib
the lib sources go in usr/src/lib/whatever, apply make ranlib and put
the Libc.a in the usr/lib/libc.a or usr/local/lib/libc.a
The port of vt100 is not complete in one of the digest of alt.os.linux

gcc doesn't LOOK for its programs in usr/local/bin.  It should be 
installed as follows : 

libc.a, crt0.o : /lib
gcc-* : /usr/local/lib
include : /usr/include

Make symlinks from /bin, /usr/bin, or /usr/local/bin to the real files 
for as, etc as you prefer - just makesure the traditional cc, cpp, 
as are in your path so that makes don't work.

gcc -v will show you if it is calling the right sub programs when it 
runs - all gcc is is a front end onto cc1, cpp, as, ld, etc.

After init is running, this won't be a problem.  If you were so inclined,
you could set HOME=/usr/root for the initial shell or whatever in main.c

Linux is a 100% 386 32 bit protected mode operating system!  You can't 
call ANY BIOS routines!  Period.  Any machine.

It kicks into extended ASCII modes while BIOS is still good, before 
the leap into protected mode.  Patch setup.s under linux/boot.

Several things : 
1.  You can use mtools to read / write DOS files, and edit with 
        emacs, etc.

2.  No, you don't run a DOS shell or emulate DOS.  You run DOS concurently
        as a 386vm task, trapping BIOS calls and port IO, remapping
        memory to handle video.  This is what QEMM386, 
        DOS extenders, etc all do.

It isn't as complicated as it sounds, but mm would have to change so 
that we could have multiple page tables (A 386 VM task must reside
in address 0 of the virtual address space - which means each
386 VM task needs its own page table) , and that 386 VM exceptions 
were handled differently

Linux came up remarkably easily!  Kudos, folks.

P.S.  Has anyone else installed Linux on a laptop with "power save

what would be required to support these features under Linux?  I really
have no idea how these work at the system level.  Currently I disable these
