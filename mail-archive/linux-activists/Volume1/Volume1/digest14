Yes, I've thought of the same thing. If I can help in anyway, please let
me know.


Even though Linux is still a beta (though the most stable beta I know),
there nothing to stop us making installation easier for newcomers.

Right.  The natural thing to do would be just to copy the pointer to the
swapped out block, right? Wrong.  Now we have two pointers pointing to a
swapped out block, and when one of the processes causes a swap-in, the
bitmap entry for that swap-page gets set (indicating it's free), even
though another task is still using the page.  There are 2 solutions:

1 - have a swap-page counter: something like what is done for shared
pages that are in memory. 

2 - swap in the parent block with read_swap_page(), and put the
swap-page pointer only in the child.  Now we have just one pointer, and
the bitmap operations work fine again.  You can of course swap in the
page to the child memory, but usually the child does an exec right after
the fork, so the page would be of no use.

Linux uses (2) - sharing of swapped out dirty pages is highly unusual,
and happens /only/ after a fork, so the bitmap is the best bet 99% of
the time. Also, the current method allows us to use the "valid swap
blocks" bitmap found at the start of a swap-device (and created by
mkswap) to be used directly as a swap-page-bitmap.

Is there any way of installing version .12 over version .11 without

   Couldn't one just write a simple program to read the first track of 
   drive B, and jump to it?


Such a program alread exists, twice.  One is commercial (I forget the
name) and one is shareare ($15, maybe -- I don't have or use it)
called BOOT_B, and it is available at wuarchive.wustl.edu.  I think
that it is in the mirrors/msdos/dskutils or something like that
directory.  I know I have seen it at wuarchive.

Yes, you need to change the bootimage in just the same way that you
change it to boot off the hard drive, except instead of having it
hard-coded to 301 or 302 or whatever (hex), you need to use the
major/minor pair (again in hex) for your B: drive, whatever that is.

BootAny is probably residing in the first 2 sectors of your harddrive
where the partition information is.  If you want to get rid of
BootAny for good, and you don't need the information currently on the
drive, you should low-level format the drive.  That should remove any
program anywhere on the drive.  (see your drive manual or the supplier
on how to low-level format it, or pick up one of the programs floating
around that will do it for you).

Otherwise, if you're trying to save the information on the drive, you 
would probably need to reconstruct the first 2 sectors, but I can't
help you on that, but I do think it's possible.

No, No, No    - if you what to restore the tape, compile and run.

I think this has used up plenty of bandwidth but I could not let
this go without a plea to Joe Green to provide the code for STREAMS

Am I correct is suppose that a consequence of this is that every single
dirty page of the parent has to be swapped in during a fork()?  If so, I
wonder what sort of hit you will take when something like GNU emacs
fork()'s.  (My GNU emacs on my Vax 3100 workstation is currently
weighing in at 5.4 meg.)

Turning around the proceedure for booting to a HD to boot to B: doesn't
seem to work (IOW - Offset 508=x1D(29 dec.) 509=x02) produces a loop

This time I see where NINDIR is being refered to in fileblocks.c...it seems
that it is a constant...but I am not sure what this constant should be.

I was able to compile the shell utils with no problems (after setting up gcc
as described by Linus and others) execpt for the commands logname and test
which makes sense since I am not login and there is a test command built into
bash...

I would appreciate any help with any of this...and let me add my thanks to
Linus and company for a wonderful new toy :)

Subject: Found problem with executable shell scripts.
Date: 25 Jan 92 05:02:48 GMT

Hi Guys (and gals :-)

   I found the work-around for problem that I was having.  As you might recall,
I tried to execute a shell script 'configure' and it had execute permissions
and had:

#!/bin/sh

as the first line (a lot of you asked me to make sure about this).

Well, BASH said 'file or directory not found' or something like that.

Well, I found out that if I changed it to:

#!/usr/bin/sh

then it works fine!  What seems to be happening is that BASH is NOT following
symbolic links!  I have /bin -> /usr/bin, with 'sh' in /usr/bin.  With
everything else I've tested, it follows the symbolic links, but apparently not
on the above.  Any ideas?  Should I just grab the current version of BASH
and re-compile?  Is this a "feature" or a "bug"?

   Thanks!
