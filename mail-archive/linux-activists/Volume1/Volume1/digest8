Yes, this is a no-no.  Minix is copyrighted.  Linux is copyrighted, but
freely redistributable.  This is not the case with Minix.  Even putting
the binaries of Minix- or AT&T- derived sources is illegal, without
explicit permission from the copyright holders.

This is true in general, but many bits of Minix, particularly the commands,
are things posted to the net that were picked up by AST.  If you are
interested in a particular Minix command, check the source file for an
indication of who the author is, and contact that person for permission.

For example, in 1987 I posted to comp.os.minix a little chmod.c replacement
that handled symbolic permissions, unlike the then-current Minix 1.1 chmod.
Somewhere along the line my program got put into the real Minix release
without any knowledge on my part.  Not that I mind: that's exactly what I
wanted.  The point is that my code is still free even though it is in the
Minix release; you are welcome to it (but don't bother; the GNU chmod.c is
better). 

Things like patch, zmodem, kermit, etc fall into the same category.

Also, don't forget the wealth of stuff in various Minix archives that
should be applicable to Linux as well.

Keep in mind that at least some of the source in minix is public
software. I.E. The vi clone distributed with minix is publically
available from archive sites. The minix kernel on the other hand, is
definitely not.

Which brings to mind a question.  Exactly what parts of the MINIX
distribution is copyright Prentice Hall and which parts are freely
redistributable?

First of all you should know that the kermit in that file (kermit.Z) does not
work properly (at least it didn't for me).  There is a version of kermit in
the file utils.tar.Z that does work.  Assuming you have a second floppy drive
and that there is sufficient room on the root file system, you should be able
to use the method described in the 0.12 release notes.  Just use rawrite.exe 
to put the tar file onto the second floppy and then once you have booted Linux
you can use the tar program on the Linux root filesystem to extract the files
from the floppy.  If you have a copy of the release notes it explains this 
fairly nicely I beleive. Enjoy!

I have been having some trouble compiling some of the GNU utilities.  Take
for example the GNU shell utilities.  I ran configure and then ran make.
Some output from the compiler came onto the screen and then the message
'making all in lib' came up.  I then started to compile the code and then
gave the error 'echo: command not found'.  I then proceeded to either remove
all the echo statements or commenting them out, and I still get the same
error when I run make.  Any ideas?

Hi,

I am planning to port pcomm to Linux. But I am not sure if libc.a has
all I need to do it. I am concerned about termcap. Is the termcap in
libc.a the subset of the real thing? If it is, I may be in trouble.

I noticed that there is no SIGWINCH. Is it going to be implemented in
the future?

I checked BASH_VERSION in /bin/sh and bash. /bin/sh says 0.00.7 and bash
says 0.00.3. Which shell is bash 1.11?

I took a look at the BSD vi source codes (version 3.7). I didn't see
any AT&T copyright notice. Is that AT&T free? I hope I am right. I
really miss the real vi. Any comments on this?

BTW, I just compiled strings. It works fine. Anybody interested? I may
post the diffs or binary.

I was led to believe that Linux was still socketless, and that X11 required
sockets to function at all. This was a good enough reason for the Minix
people to say that X could not be compiled on that OS. Am I wrong in either
of these statements?

Yes and No.  X requires a reliable byte stream.  How you implement that is up
to you.  Of course, to run it "out of the box," it will want either TCP
connections, unix domain sockets, or decnet connections.

Before this gets too far, there is a port of the mit X11R4 core to various PC unix
platforms and several VGA cards.  The one main requirement that the README
specifies is that STREAMS must exist.  I have included the README below.

===============================cut here=======================================



       Announcing Release 1.1 of the X386 SYSTEM V/386 X11R4 server.

FILES:
===============================================================================

X386.tar.Z      The sources and patches neccessary to build the whole core
                MIT/X11R4 release. This will require over 80MBytes free disk
                space.

X11R4core.tar.Z All binaries, libraries, etc. that are needed to get X11R4
                run on your 386box (except the fonts).

X11R4fonts.tar  All fonts, which should be installed to get X386 running.
                Note, that they don't have changed since X386 1.0, so you
                might not need them.

(all files are also available as splitted versions)

Totally space needed: 20 MBytes. (BUT IT IS absolutely worth every byte)

Where to get it: 131.159.8.35, anonymous-ftp, /pub/i386/X11R4


REQUIREMENTS:
===============================================================================
X386 will run on following Unix operating systems:

        Interactive 386/ix, 2.0.2 or later
        ESIX

        SCO Unix (planned)

You must have installed the STREAMS facility and optional TCP/IP. 

A lot of RAM !!! 4MBytes seem to be the absolute minimum. 8MBytes are strongly
recommended.


VGA boards with the following chipsets are supported:

        PVGA1A / PVGA1B         (no, sorry ... maybe some day)
        ET3000                  (for ex. GENOA 5300/5400)
        ET4000                  (STB PWR Graph, Sigma Legend, etc.)
        GVGA                    (Genoa 6400)


Mice that support one of the following communication standards:

        Microsoft serial        (Microsoft, various NoName ...)
        Mouse Systems serial    (Mouse Systems, ...)
        MMSeries                (Summa Mouse, ...)
        Logitech                (Logitech)
        Mircosoft Busmouse


FEATURES:
===============================================================================

o  AT&T/ISC/SCO local and TCP/IP connections.

o  XView 2.0 Toolkit. With shared libs and sample clients.

o  REAL portable shared libs (X11, Xt, Xmu, Xaw , Xext, olgx & xview !!!)

o  The very first VGA server that is FULLY configurable. 
   (see /usr/lib/X11/X386/Xconfig)

o  First UNIX/386 X-server that realises the 'PC/AT Keyboard proposal'.
   Including international keyboards (via ttymap(1))

o  Virtual terminal switching - with multible servers on different virtual
   terminals running at the same time.

o  Full use of installed video RAM through the concept of a virtual screen.
   (also called panning)

o  Switching between different display resolutions by keypress.

o  Online Manpages, along with xman, an X - application for online manual 
   browsing.



CHANGES:
===============================================================================

o  New shared libs. This means that you may delete the *.4.0 ones in 
   /usr/lib/X11/shlib if NO clients needs them anymore. Otherwise, you should
   keep them installed.

o  Many changes in the directory structure.

o  Easier configuration (/usr/lib/X11/X386/etc/install.sh)

o  Uncountable internal changes & bugfixes



NOTES:
===============================================================================
o  I will not write a driver for your VGA board that is not supported now,
   unless I have the data-book of this specific chipset and the same VGA in
   my 386box to test the driver. If you want to write the driver by your own,
   please contact me first, so that I can give you hints and further
   information.

o  This server may be added to commerical products. But it would be nice that
   in this case the company supports me with money or hardware to keep things
   on goning.

o  For questions, you can reach me via e-mail. Please post every request also
   via comp.unix.sysv386, so everybody can use the results of the question you
   had.


BENCHMARKS:
===============================================================================
This are the results of the famous xbench, I got with the following equipment:

        33MHz 386 / no 387
        8 MBytes RAM
        CDC IV - SCSI - HD
        TRICOM VGA, ET4000, 1MB RAM

Format for the floppy driver finally seems to be working.

 The floppy controller belongs in a museum. It has such wonderful features as
recalibrate only stepping back 77 tracks before giving up, no buffering
causing DMA to lose data when mixed with screen access, undocumented
recalibration errors requiring you to try try again, and tech writers who
write worse than I do :) 
Now that I fixed most (I hope) of the other problems I'm going to try the track
buffering again and see if it decides to puke again.
