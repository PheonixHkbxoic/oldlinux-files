I think the point here is that Richard Stallman is not on the poverty
line himself and he does get paid for working. He's quite happy to have
Cygnus provide the service they do because it's no skin off his nose if
other people also get paid for working on free software. 

However, the sentiments of many people working on Linux are
understandably quite different. They get no financial benefits out of
Linux and are working on it for fun and because it's a worthwhile
project. If all you intend to do is provide a service and make a little
money on the side then that's in this spirit. However, when you say
things like, "can I make a living out of this" and the such like then
their reaction is, not surprisingly, "why should I give my free time so
that someone else can get rich". This is basically exploitation of others
good intentions.

If you are just going to make a little extra money providing a service
to those without easy access to Linux, then good luck. If you intend
making a living off the backs of others then you deserve what you get.
This is certainly not in the spirit of the GPL.

|

The above sounds like something from AT&T. If we can't make any money
from it then why bother. People have to live but the whole point of the
free software is that software development should not be guided by
profit but by the need for it.

I think the harsh words of those who are against your aims are due to
their reluctance to spend all their extra hours working on Linux, while
you get rich and they stay poor. Remember, many of those working on
linux are doing so because they can't afford to spend money on software
i.e. they are NOT rich.


Well, those are my thoughts on the matter.

I'm personally in favor of the SCO XENIX (/UNIX?) standard of naming
console screens as tty01, tty02,..., tty12; direct-connect terminals as
tty1a, tty1b, tty2a; serial-connect terminals as tty1A, tty1B, tty2A
(where the number represents the physical card and the letter represents
the port on that card.  For normal 2-ports-per-serial-card, this means
that COM1 and COM2 are tty1a and tty1b, and COM3 and COM4 are tty2a and
tty2b.  For a multi-port serial card this means that you have tty1a
through tty1h.); pseudo-terminals are ttyp0-ttypf, ttyq0-ttyqf, etc.

I personally have no problem with people profiting from distribution of free
software as long as it is done honestly (this is what the GPL tries to
insure). Unfortunitly not everyone has net access and you can't expect
people to put out the effort to mail out thousands of copies of Linux
without earning something for it.

I do some consulting work in addition to my part time job at WPI. So far
I've had to do it all in DOS (YUCK!!!), the main reason is that its hard to
convince a customer to shell out $1000 for Sys V to run a mailing list.
Fortunitly I have access to Linux from the net, but there are many people
who could make use of Linux who don't have this good fortune. Please don't
pretend Linux is just a toy, once it has network and X support it will be
the best PC operating system available. Lets make sure people can use it
instead of just a small cult of those fortunite enough to have ftp access.
Some day you will be thankful that you can write in a real OS rather than a
microsoft excretion.

While not distributers arn't legally obligated to do so I think it is only
fair that some of the profits earned from distributing linux go back into
improving it.
