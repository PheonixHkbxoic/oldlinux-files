Subject: I wrote 'time' but ...
Date: 21 Jan 92 08:12:12 GMT

I'm new to Linux, and wanted to help.  I figured that the easiest way
is to start by writing small utilities.  So I wrote the unix 'time;'
command.

It works just like the normal time command.  I'd like to add it to the
standard distribution.  How do I do that?

Second, it seems all of the fields in 'rusage' are returned zero
except the user/system time.  Is this correct, or am I a horrable
programmer.

Third, can these little pesky utilities be found in source code
somewhere, or do we have to write them all ourselves?

-Thanks

        Hmm.. My friend installed it on one 386 last night and it took
him about 3-4 hours total with disk backup & partitioning etc. Howewer,
he is really a unix wizard and someone with less experience in such opera-
ting systems might have faced lots of difficulties and so on. It isn't 
particularly easy to install and it lacks some utilities (I know, you can
port and add then yourself, but..) but it has some edge. You don't
have to pay several hundred dollars just to try it. If you are interested,
it is well worth trying!

Linux does not use Mach, nor any other pre-existing kernel.  Is
completely written by Linus Torvalds (+ collaborators, from the
Linux-activists mailing list (which this newsgroup tries to replace for
people with news access)).

I don't think saving steps has been a guiding priciple for Linus.  In
fact, I secretly think he started the project because he got tired of
playing Prince of Persia (or something like that, I never bothered to
take a look at the game).

This is approximately true.  I don't remember the exact date, but that
is approximately the time (he bought his 386 a bit earlier in the
spring, I think, but he was playing around for awhile first).

This sounds like it has indeed changed your root-device, but something
is missing on it (like it couldn't find /dev/tty1, and bash is exiting
at once?). Check out that the root device has all the necessary files.

Also check out the bootup-message that tells you the size of the
root-device: do the numbers look ok?

Request for Discussion
======= === ==========

GROUP:  comp.os.linux

STATUS: unmoderated

PURPOSE:

        Linux-related discussion: Linux kernel hacking, porting utilities
         to Linux, Linux bug-fixes, and implementing new features in Linux.

======================

What's Linux ?

Linux is a UNIX clone, which currently runs only on 386/486 machines.
Linux is freely distributable (within rules in the Linux copyright)
and available with the complete source code.


Why comp.os.linux ?

Our mailing list has now far too much traffic, which has caused some
unsubscribtions, but still we have ~400 subscribers (and ~10 mailing
lists) - which is really too big, because list users activity is
real high.


What happens to Linux-activists mailing list?

There will be a News <-> Mail Digest gateway for people people who do
not have access to Usenet, much like the comp.lang.perl <->
Perl-Users@fuggles.acc.Virginia.edu mailing list.  It is anticipated,
however, that the vast majority of the Linux community will be using
the comp.os.linux newsgroup.


When will voting begin ?

Voting will begin on Februrary 18th, one month after the posting of
this Call for Discussion.  Theodore Ts'o (tytso@athena.mit.edu) will
serve as vote collector; the exact address and voting procedures will
be contained in the Call For Votes when it is issued. The usual
requirements (2/3 of the votes in favor, and at least 100 more YES
votes than NO votes) will apply.

LINUX INFORMATION SHEET
by Robert Blum (blum@cip-s01.informatik.rwth-aachen.de) et al.
(last updated 13 Jan 1992)

1. WHAT IS LINUX
    LINUX 0.12 is a freely distributable UNIX clone.  It implements a
subset of System V and POSIX functionality.  LINUX has been written
from scratch, and therefore does not contain any AT&T or MINIX
code--not in the kernel, the compiler, the utilities, or the libraries.
For this reason it can be made available with the complete source code
via anonymous FTP.  LINUX runs only on 386/486 AT-bus machines; porting
to non-Intel architectures is likely to be difficult, as the kernel
makes extensive use of 386 memory management and task primitives.

     Version 0.12 is still a beta release, but it already provides much
of the functionality of a System V.3 kernel.  For example, various
users have been able to port programs such as bison/flex without having
to modify code at all.  Another indication of its maturity is that
it is now possible to do LINUX kernel development using LINUX itself 
and freely-available programming tools.

2. LINUX features
  - System call compatible with a subset of System V and POSIX
  - Full multiprogramming (multiple programs can run at once)
  - Memory paging with copy-on-write
  - Demand loading of executables
  - Page sharing of executables
  - Virtual memory: swapping to disk when out of RAM
  - POSIX job control
  - virtual consoles on EGA/VGA screens
  - pty's
  - some 387-emulation
  - ANSI compliant C compiler (gcc)
  - A complete set of compiler writing tools
    (bison as yacc-replacement, flex as lex replacement)
  - The GNU 'Bourne again' shell (bash)
  - Micro emacs
  - most utilities you need for development
    (cat, cp, kermit, ls, make, etc.)
  - Over 200 library procedures (atoi, fork, malloc, read, stdio, etc.)
  - Currently 4 national keyboards: Finnish/US/German/French
  - Full source code (in C) for the OS is freely distributable
  - Full source code of the tools can be gotten from many anonymous ftp sites
    (Almost the entire suite of GNU programs has been ported to Linux.)
  - Runs in protected mode on 386 and above
  - Support for extended memory up to 16M on 386 and above
  - RS-232 serial line support with terminal emulation, kermit, zmodem, etc.
  - Supports the real time clock


3. HARDWARE REQUIRED
   - A 386 or 486 machine with an AT-bus.  (EISA will probably work, also,
     but you will need an AT-bus hard disk controller.)
     Both DX and SX processors will work.
   - A hard disk implementing the standard AT hard disk interface--
     for example, an IDE drive.  SCSI drives are not supported yet.
   - A high-density disk drive--either 5.25" (1.2MB) or 3.5" (1.44MB).
   - At least 2 megabytes of RAM.  (LINUX will boot in 2 Mb.  To use
     gcc 4 MB is a good idea.)
   - Any video card of the following: Hercules,CGA,EGA,VGA

In addition, LINUX supports
   - Up to two serial lines
   - A real time clock 

4. PARTIAL LIST OF UTILITIES INCLUDED IN OR AVAILABLE FOR LINUX 0.12 
   - The MTOOLS package (reading/writing to DOS filesystems)
   - The complete GNU filetools (ls, cat, cp, mv, ...)
   - The GNU C compiler with GNU assembler, linker, ar, ...
   - bison
   - flex
   - rcs
   - pmake (BSD 4.3 Reno/BSD 4.4  make)
   - kermit
   - Micro emacs
   - less
   - mkfs
   - fsck
   - mount/umount


5. LINUX BINARIES
    The LINUX binaries and sources are available at three
    anonymous FTP sites. These are:

    nic.funet.fi:/pub/OS/Linux
    tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux
    tupac-amaru.informatik.rwth-aachen.de:/pub/msdos/replace


6. LEGAL STATUS OF LINUX
     Although LINUX is  supplied with the  complete source  code, it is
copyrighted software.  Unlike MINIX, however, it is available for free,
provided  you obey  to the  rules specified  in  the  LINUX  copyright.


7. NEWS ABOUT LINUX
     Since LINUX's  introduction to the public there has been a rapidly
growing mailing list, "linux-activists@niksula.hut.fi". To subscribe to 
this  list,  mail to  "linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi".  If the
traffic in this lists increases  further, there are  plans to swap ( at 
least partially ) over  to comp.os.misc, so  watch out  for  any  LINUX 
articles in  this group.  For the current status of LINUX, do "finger
torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi".


8. FUTURE PLANS
     Work is underway on LINUX version 1.0, which will close some of the
gaps in the present implementation.  Various people are currently working
on:
     - A virtual filesystem layer 
     - STREAMS 
     - init/getty/login
     - Interprocess communication
     - IEEE POSIX P1003.1 / P1003.2 compatibility
     - SCSI support

Subject: Buggy omit-frame-pointer?
Date: 21 Jan 1992 17:23:26 GMT

Hello.  First, I'd like to express my gratitude to Linus and the rest
of the Linux contributors.  It's a nice piece of work.

With that out of the way, let's move on to the bitching :-)

For now, I'm cross-compiling Linux from Minix using GCC 1.40.  There
seems to be a problem with variadic routines compiled with
"-fomit-frame-pointer".  At first I though that my version of GCC was
screwed, but then I noticed that a similar problem shows up in the
distributed init/main.s.

From init/main.c:

    static int printf(const char *fmt, ...)
    {
        va_list args;
        int i;

        va_start(args, fmt);
        write(1,printbuf,i=vsprintf(printbuf, fmt, args));
        va_end(args);
        return i;
    }

From init/main.s:

    _printf:
        pushl %ebx
        leal 12(%esp),%eax
        pushl %eax
        pushl 12(%esp)              !!!! THIS SHOULD BE 8(%esp) !!!!
        pushl $_printbuf
        call _vsprintf
        movl %eax,%ebx
        pushl %ebx
        pushl $_printbuf
        pushl $1
        call _write
        movl %ebx,%eax
        addl $24,%esp
        popl %ebx
        ret

Strangely enough, my version of GCC uses an offset of 16 in both places
where 12 is used above.   This is even more wrong.  Is this a known bug
in GCC?  If so, why do all the distributed makefiles use -fomit-frame-pointer?
I couldn't get anything to work until I deleted this from the makefiles.

Before you write any of the small utilities, it might behoove you to try
look at the GNU(*) utilities to see if someone has already written a freely
distributable version of a command.  For example, there is a GNU time
program which already has been written.  (And, like most GNU programs,
it suffers from acute featuritis  :-)  See below for where to find the
GNU programs....

>It works just like the normal time command.  I'd like to add it to the

Right now, there is no "standard distribution";  just upload it to the
FTP sites, and announce it to the newsgroup once it's been made
available via FTP.  Someone chaotic, but Linux has been changing to fast
for people to put together "standard distributions".  I expect this will
change once more features are added and it finally leaves beta release.

>Second, it seems all of the fields in 'rusage' are returned zero

Yes, this is correct.  Linux currently isn't keeping track of those
statistics.  I just passed them back in the rusage structure so that
once we do add those features to the kernel, people won't need to
recompile their programs.  But right now, yes, they're all zero.

>Third, can these little pesky utilities be found in source code
>somewhere, or do we have to write them all ourselves?

Most of the sources to the Linux-specific programs (mkfs, fsck, etc.)
are on the Linux FTP sites: (nic.funet.fi, tsx-11.mit.edu,
tupac-amaru.informatik.rwth-aachen.de).  Most of the "regular" programs
(cp, mv, gcc, etc.) are from the GNU distribution.  They can be found
vai FTP from prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu.  Most of the Unix utilities that
you'll be looking for will be bundled up in one of these packages:
file-utils, text-utils, shell-utils, and bin-utils.  

(*) GNU stands for GNU's Not Unix, which (besides being a recursive
acronym) is a project started by the Free Software Foundation (the FSF)
to write a freely distributable version of Unix.  The GNU kernel is
named HURD, and is based on Mach.  It is currently being written, and is
not yet done.  Many of the GNU utilities, however, are completed and are
much more functional than the original Unix utilities.  Since they are
freely available, Linux is using them as well.

Might be easier to simply run Linux under the PC-Soft 386 emulation
software.  (Assuming the m68k is a Mac box.)  I wonder if that would
work?

How about using the 'screen' package ? It should be portable even to
Linux.

I'm so found of it that I even use it under X :-)

I've recently pulled down the gcc and tried installing it.  Unfortunately I've

Subject: Re: /proc, anyone?
Date: Tue, 21 Jan 92 21:11:13 GMT

Rather than just hacking in /proc, it would be better to implement
a complete "file system switch" abstraction in the kernel, and
rewrite the existing disk file system in terms of that.  Then
when the time comes to add things like (say) NFS, it will be much
easier.

One might obtain inspiration for how to structure such a file
system abstraction from, say, the BSD sources (vnodes) or
the Plan 9 papers.

Roughly speaking, most such abstractions include at least:

        reading and writing bytes (of course)
        reading and writing "stat" information
        name to internal filehandle conversion (namei--
                in BSD, probably System V, and Plan 9,
                the abstraction usually provides a
                "walk one path component" operation)
        deleting names
        renaming names
        making hard links

Then access to file systems could go through a "file system
switch" table, in much the same way that access to devices
is vectored through a device table.  (In fact, in Plan 9
they have eliminated all such tables except the file system
switch, and all device drivers implement file systems.)

No, not at all. I know next to nothing about installing and
maintaining unix machines, and the only problem I had when starting
with linux was that I thought my ESDI drive would not work with it. I
tried some old MFM drives and that was it. I even started with linux
0.10 and at that time you even needed minix demo diskette to make
filesystems, but everything else was easy. There were difficulties
with some bugs but those ones have got a lot of DDT since that time.
Now installing linux is very straightforward. Of course you can't do
too much with the system without some knowledge, because you need to
compile the programs you use yourself. Nobody I know sells
shrink-wrapped software for this system. But also porting things is
easy, rather often just "make".

After all even the problem with my ESDI drive got solved (for those
that don't know, at least Joincom controller with Magtron drive work
well after you comment out the "unexpected hd interrupt"-message from
hd.c).

I would suggest trying it out, especially because it is free. You
don't lose anything (if you have backups :). I was really impressed.
