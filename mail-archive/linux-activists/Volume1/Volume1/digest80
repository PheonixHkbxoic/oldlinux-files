Is there a version of tr around somewhere.  There are a couple of
packages that use it during installation e.g. patch. Although I could
get by without it I'd really like to get the patch Configure shell to
work just to satisfy myself that linux really is fully equipped, so to
speak. SYSV also needs expr and echo routines in bin. I've just found a
expr prgram so I'll have a look at it. Have these little details been
done by someone else. We might as well tackle a few of the little tasks
while we're waiting for the big jobs to be finished.

Also, is the Berkeley VI in the public domain. Elvis is driving me mad.
Does anyone else have the habit of typing :0 to get to the top of the
file, I have and it doesn't work in elvis :-(

One last point, I remember some discusion about uncompress crashing on
corrupted files. Well, it just happened to me. If the file is corrupted
in some way then compress just hangs, taking the rest of the system down
with it. Is this being fixed, it should recognise corrupted files
shouldn't it!

Coherent might run on a 512k machine.  The docs seem to say that you must
have at least 640k.  The kernel seems to allocated about 250k of memory for
buffers and drivers.  When I am expiring news and doing compiling and data
transfers simultaneously, I get up in the 3 to 3.5 meg area of memory usage.
I guees a 512k machine could be used if swapping was enabled, but it would
be like watching paint dry.

I would like to use DOS for them.  But I have a problem, I would like to run DOS
as a VC under LINUX.  In that way, I could be doing a file transfer, or other useful
work under LINUX at the same time!  Don't tell me that its too hard to do!  I have
a SUN386i workstation at work, and even though it doesn't support graphics applications
(unless its a CGA application under SUN-View windows), it DOES support DOS utilities
that run entirely in text mode!  It can be done.  We don't have to make every program
which writes to the E/VGA hardware work!  This along with the mtools package would
be a VERY complete intergration of DOS and LINUX.  Under a VC, it should be sufficient
for most DOS text mode packages to work fine.  I do NOT want to have to reboot
DOS and stop any other LINUX tasks that I might have going on, especially if I'm
running KA9Q in another process, or after SL/IP support is added to the LINUX
kernal!  

I don't want to run DOS for the GAMES, I want to run DOS for the commercial
programs that just aren't or won't be ported to LINUX!

DOS trickery shouldn't have to be coded into the MM.  However, if DOS tasks
should need something special added, that should not be a reason not to do it.
espicially if its a simple thing to do!  (I don't know, would it be a simple
change?)  I don;t wish to force instability in the kernal, but I also
don't like some of the anti-DOS attitudes being aired around here here
lately.  It IS possible for DOS to run nicely under UNIX, SUN proved it!

   Actually, the "GNU OS" will be a gnu filesystem (HURD) running on Mach
   (the unix successor being developed by CMU).

The Hurd is far more than just a filesystem.

I've just seen the 4th person independently fix vXprintf.  Please, can
we have whoever is maintaining the 1.4 libc bless the fixes, so each
individual user doesn't have to do them?  I have already put what I
believe is a reasonable libc on athos.rutgers.edu:/pub/linux.  It
fixes this and a couple of other things, and adds the time/date stuff.
There was recently a rerelease of the 1.4 stuff because of floating
point problems, but from the posting, it didn't sound like this
affected libc.  So it should be possible to use the new gnulib from
that and my libc, date, etc.

    I recently got linux, and I have enjoyed playing around with it, it

However I have a couple questions.  
  1.  In release 0.13 or 0.95 I guess now,  will it be distributed in a
      more orderly fashion?  I am having a very hard time finding and then
      figuring out what goes where.
  2.  Is there a list of what the most current patches are?  I have seen
      so many in the mail list that I have given up trying to patch my 
      0.12 release.
 
    Thanks.

500k of ram would be practically useless for Coherent.  I run news and mail

the 3 meg mark on a regular basis.

Coherent = 64k code + 64k data + whatever you can stuff on the stack.  And
there are virtual memory routines that can be used to extend the data space
of a process.

Coherent costs $100.

Actually, 2 meg on an Intel box is more like 1.7 meg because of the no man's

It dosen't work on our Solbournes (SunOS 4.1) unless you have certain things
in your .emacs file - this is probably the case with Emacs. Unfortunately,
I can't remember what these 'certain things' are, I'm going to try the

True. People comparing coherent with Linux aren't comparing like with like.
Coherent is an inferior OS which can only run executables 64k or smaller,
where as Linux is a real UNIX in comparison.
