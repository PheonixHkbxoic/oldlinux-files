I think there are *many* good reasons to rewrite mm.  First of all, we
(at least I) certainly want a DOS emulator down the road.  The easiest
way to do this is to run the BIOS, and then DOS, in V86 mode, I think.
Also, I think a more general page table scheme would be nice on its
own merits.  (I can see having more than 64 tasks, e.g.)

One place to start might be the code from DJGPP.  DJGPP is a port of
GCC to DOS (!).  It contains a lot of code for switching back and
forth between 32- and 16- bit modes.

The other option, of course, is to copy the BIOS into a process's
memory (in protected mode), and try to make use of it.  I don't know
how difficult this would be.

A friend of mine, who purchased a 386 motherboard for the express
purpose of running Linux (hooray) is having some problems getting

The boot process goes just fine, but fdisk reports NOTHING.  It
dies without any sort of output whatsoever.

Furthermore, skipping the mkfs portion (and just guessing the #
of blocks) reports bad blocks before the first data block (or
something to that effect).

He has an 386/25 with Award BIOS, a ST251R (42 meg) RLL drive, with
a ST22 controller card.  (and 4M memory...)

Dear all,

I am planning on installing Linux on a new 486 box equipped with
only a 40M hard-drive.  Given the lack of space, I would be keen
to press into serivce a 60M MFM drive that I posses.

The tricky questions are thus:  (1) What flavour of MFM controller
can LINUX drive (2) are there likely to be any complications
in driving both an MFM controller and an IDE drive from LINUX /
DOS?   I have visions of much kernel tweakery and endless
fiddling with interrupt jumpers etc

I trust this question isn't hopelessly naive...

Hi,

I just got pfdisk and installed it (scary to mess around with boot-blocks!).
Now I got a question: how do I use it with 2 hard disks?
My configuration is as follows:
            partition   1            2            3             4
disk 1 (106 Mb)       unused       unused    DOS(active)    DOS(extension)
disk 2 (106 Mb)     Linux(boot)  Linux(swap)    Linux         Linux

I installed "bootactv.bin" on /dev/hd0. When I boot it finds the 
active partition on disk 1 and if I don't press a key it boots DOS.
When I press a key I can choose 1-4, but only on the first disk.
How do I get it to boot partition 1 on disk 2? I assumed I had to install
a boot-block and some other programs on my Linux root-partition, so I 
looked at shoelace and installed the programs as I should. I installed 
the Linux bootimage-0.12 as /vmlinux and edited /etc/config accordingly.
I ran laceup and finally I ran pfdisk on /dev/hd5 again, but it still 
only boots from the first disk. 

So, how do I do it?

Ben.

Where can I get hold of standards documents e.g. ANSI C, POSIX and
anything else we're using for linux. In particular, are there any
on-line sources.


Has anyone started work on ethernet drivers. I was thinking of looking
at the clarkson packet drivers. If anyone could give me any pointers,
like which device driver should I look at to give me some idea of
structure etc, I might start to get somewhere.

I've got an isolan 4110, so I'll be working on that. If someone who
knows about the clarkson drivers and writing linux device drivers wants
to work on this with me then let  me know. In particular, someone with a
different ethernet card would be handy.

I don't think the actual mode changes are much of the problem with regards to
SVGA cards, basically all you do is pick up a table of values and stuff them
into the registers. This is straightforward from the Linux kernel (about 10
lines of C - in fact have a look at the X386 code, that's where I got it from.)
It certainly isn't worth the horrors of setting the machine up to do a BIOS
call.. though, of course if we want DOS emulation.. actually I think I'd be
happiest if I could just mount a DOS filesystem under linux..

The real problem with SVGA's is the bank switching and pallette control while
in SVGA mode and actually writing to the thing. Unless the card supports a
linear memory map mode, you are forced to do this, and you need to perform
port I/O to do it (ioctl's are too slow - you have to do lots of them at times)
currently Linix seems to blackhole port I/O from user space :-(

Anyway - apart from the graphic support, what's missing from 0.13 that we still
need to get X up and running? (Not that I like X, I'm just lumping it..)

I'm still working on getting a Linux system up and running, but you could try
afio which was posted to comp.sources.*something* (unix? misc?) a while back;
I've used it on my Atari ST to back up Minix paritions to floppies. Once I have

Cawf is a fairly reasonable nroff substitute, and comes with man and ms
macro packages.   It prints anoying warning messages, but these are
easily deactivated -

Editing whatis : 

When I added some things to whatis, I decided that writing a short 
shell script would be simpler.  It's marred by my imperfect use of 
sed, and dies when it encounters a non-standard man page, but I have a
makewhatis script if people are interested.

A better solution would be Tom Christensen's makewhatis and man
perl scripts - they make use of dbm databases, and will maintain compressed
cat pages, etc.  dbm and col are required.

Cat pages  :

Cawf is not too slow,
