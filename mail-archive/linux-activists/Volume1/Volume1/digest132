Does anyone know of a port of X windows to linux of 386BSD or some
other 386 unix-like operating system?

Of course I am interested in a "free" version (especially a linux port),
but I am also curious about the commercial products.

I use a rc.local which is called at the end of rc. That way it's safe
to install another rc. You just need to add the extra line that calls
rc.local

 I certainly will stay with linux and I am happy with linux 0.95a, thanks
to Linus and those involved.
  I tried 386BSD boot-floppy on three different 386 machines, for two of
them, drive A: was being read forever, the third one boot and panic
and automatically re-boot, ...... . 
  I don't have a math co-processor, and DOS HAS to be on the same dirve.

Hi:

   I remember reading that you could use the lp.12 patches to get lp support
on 0.95a. So I tried it today. But alas, something happened somewhere and the
kernel I got complaint a lot about General Protection errors (the thing
that used to be very common in 0.95) and said NO lp! :-(

So I rebooted (not a cold boot) with the old kernel but still I got the GPE's.
Only after switch-off-on sequence with the old kernel solved the problem.

Has any one succeeded in getting lp patch to work? If so, did you hand patch
all the files? Again, if so, can you post/e-mail the diff with fresh 0.95a.

Any help would be appreciated.

I've installed 0.95a and I'm very pleased. The install scripts are a
major improvement! Great work!

Now a question: I am running a mono-vga in 50 line mode and really
like it. I do have a problem with kermit not using all the lines and
not resetting the terminal to its original state. I've played with
setterm, but with no results. Is there any easy way to get kermit to
use all 50 lines?

Second, I know it is in the newgcc.faq, but I still can't seem to find
limits.h. Where is it? Thanks.

Thanks!  (Really, though, I wish someone would complain - the only bad
thing I've heard is that the install script doesn't handle the case
where /usr is a mounted partition.)

I assume you're having problems once connected someplace (such as your
school's computer), in which case the other end has to know you have
50 lines available.  If the other machine is a Unix box, that's easy:
use stty on that machine.  (stty rows 50).  I'll agree that 50-line
mode is simply wonderful.  Whenever I have to use 25-line mode (less
and less :), the gargantuan letters bug the heck out of me.

Also, for those keeping score:  I rebuilt the kernel with the Finnish
keyboard, *again*.  This makes every kernel since 0.11.  I swear, I
thought I changed it this time, but it changed itself back.  Gremlins,
that's what it is....

        All:

        I am having problems getting linux installed on my personal machine
        and was wondering if anyone can help me out.  I have been working
        with Linux on the machine at work for about a month now. but I can't
        seem to be able to get anyplace with installing it on my machine
        at home.

        Here's the setup.
                Machine:        BSR 386SX/16
                Memory:         4 MB
                Floppies:       Drive A:        1.2MB 5.25"
                                Drive B:        1.44MB  3.5"
                Hard Drives:    Drive C:        Plus HardCard IIXL
                                Drive D:        Seagate ST1106 (RLL)
                Controller:     Floppy:         On Motherboard
                                Drive D:        Seagate ST-21/22

        Here's the problem:
        I can boot linux fine and run off of floppies (either one)
        when I run fdisk it just returns (NO ERROR, Nothing printed
        at all).  What I think is happening is that it is not even
        seeing either of the hard disks, I do NOT know why? I can
        understand it not knowing about the HardCard, but Does anyone
        know of any reason why it is not finding the RLL drive?
        I have heard of other people running off of RLL drives,
        is it just the particular card that I have? can someone
        offer some assistance and a possible soloution to this
        problem? 

        Thanks for any assistance that anyone can give me.

        Paul

        P.S. Before someone else suggests it, I have tried using the
                RLL drive as C: and the HardCard as D: and I end up with
                the same results.

  in /etc/rc to set the com port's line speed.  set baud 9600 at the kermit

doesn't change the device's speed ...

BTW I cannot successfully get kermit to transmit on com1 at 19200 - Any clues 
would be greatfully received.  I've got ka9q running at 9600, with the following
in /etc/rc :-

/bin/stty 9600 -IXOFF -IXON < /dev/tty64 > /dev/tty64

   ... but 19200 would be so much better, if poss ....

Also, when using ka9q I keep getting an "extra" return/linefeed every time I hit
return.  I found the following clears up this problem, and doesn't seem to
mess up anything else :-

stty -ECHONL

        perhapse this could become the default ???

In kermit you can use  C-\ (that's   ctrl  \  ) and after that hit  c
you get the "C-Kermit>" prompt. From there you can use  '?' to get help.
You can even quit from kermit and then fire it up again with no problem.
The only problem that I have with kermit is that it won't hangup the phone.
I had to power the modem off or give  +++ ATH0 command.

-Problem with login thru /dev/ttys1 and /dev/ttys2:
 I am having problem with <CR>. Hitting return key does not move the cursor
 down. For example if I do 'ls -l', the first output will overwrite the
 current cursor line and at the end of the command the cursor stays at the
 line where the command ended. Is this a known bug ?
 BTW, "who" works fine. I can see a list of people login in :-)
 "write" works too...

-I am looking at 'procmail' and thinking that it could be the mail transport
 agent (MTA) for local mail. With procmail I can create a dummy "sendmail"
 and indeed it delivers the mail to the right userid with the right ownership.
 I'll post a msg if I can get this up and running. I understand somebody
 else is working on 'deliver'. How is it going ?
 Is anybody working on 'sendmail' and 'smail' ? I'd like to know how it goes.

-I am also looking at 'elm' and 'mush' as mail user agent (MUA).
 Unfortunately the 'Configure' script for 'elm' breaks since I don't have
 'expr', 'awk', 'sed', 'echo'. I found 'gawk' and 'sed' in tsx-11.mit.edu 
 but no 'expr'. Anybody ?
 Compiling 'mush' is not as smooth as I expected. It breaks trying to find
 getlogin(), re_comp(), and re_exec().
 Where can I find these libraries  ? I can see re_comp() and re_exec()
 in <regex.h> though. Is there a switch I should use when compiling.


Setup: Linux 0.95a, newgcc (is this 1.40 ?)

I must have a faulty memory chip, or something, but every time I don't
have the documentation at hand I'll swear I have a WD controller, but
as it happens, my controller is a Data Technology 7287 Revision B.

Oh well. I did a little testing this morning and I managed to pinpoint
the bug (or perhaps the drive just got tired of whining). It appears
that the bug is in reset_controller(). The 0.95a hd driver forces a
controller reset at startup and this messes up the Seagate drive.

One way to get around this is to change the line:
   static int reset = 1;
back to:
   static int reset = 0;

However, if you ever run into serious enough a hd failure to cause a
controller reset, the drive will probably start screaming again.

You could also comment out the code in reset_controller(), but this
way you could still get stuck with a hd failure. Sigh.

Could one of you guys who really know this stuff take a wee look?
Linus? Drew? Please.

All right. Earlier I had posted about a noisy second hard drive. 
Well, I did what was suggested and rebuilt the kernel using the
old hd.c from .95 but I also found how to modify the hd.c from v.95a.
It is simple and it seems to work but do not ask me why.
Just change the line in hd.c that reads:

static int reset = 1;
to
static int reset = 0;

It is near the top of the file. Again, I am not sure exactly what I did
here but it works.

Thanks to all who responded with the same problem. Now I can sleep
knowing I have a complete .95a version. ;)

1. Below find a patch to ls.c of the 3.1 fsf file utilities
for a simple change to show file types in color: executables
in green, directories in cyan, links with blue background.
Flag '-f' disables the colors (but you might want to reverse
the sense of this).

2. Maybe it's time to consider gcc 2.0 with the shared library
to be a beta.  I've compiled the 95a kernel, 1.6 shell utilities,
3.1 file utilities, kermit 5A, ps, and it seems to work fine.

3. ... except kermit 5A doesn't echo CR correctly in command
mode.  Does anyone know what to do about that?

4. I can't access a 720kb 3.5" floppy in my 1.44mb drive.  Do
I need to change an entry in the floppy_type table in floppy.c?
If so, what specs should I use?

5. It would be nice to be able to format floppies.  There's a
note in the 95a source from Keith White that he has a patch
for that.  Is that available anywhere for ftping?  Or perhaps
he could post it.
