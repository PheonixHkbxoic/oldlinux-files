   You need to create a small shell script for clear.  Do this:

           cat > /usr/bin/clear
           #! /bin/sh -
           echo ^[[H^[[J
           ^D
           chmod 0755 /usr/bin/clear
Actually, use setterm -clear, as this will work on your terminals too,
if you have them.  In the same spirit as this answer, you can make a
shell script like this:

cat > /usr/bin/clear
#! /bin/sh -
setterm -clear
^D
chmod 0755 /usr/bin/clear

Well, gang.  I've just now installed Linux for the third time now.
I've got just about of there is for it on my hard drive.
I've been trying to get a compiler, any compiler, to work.  Guess
what?  I can't.  I followed the directions as well as I could.
What happens?  Glad you asked.
When I run gcc I get something saying that it can't exec a binary.
What binary?  Where?  How can I fix it?  Does my path need
to be expanded?  (It is the default path within bash)
Is there there some magical directory for all the binaries of gcc?
Any alt-spam symbolic links to files needed?  Some assembly required? :)
Basically,  HELP!

    Another question, I've been looking and the man.c source (@tsx-11) and
I'm wondering where this 'nroff' is located?  I did a find for it and came
up with nothing?  Where can I get it?  

Thanks,

I had fun with pfdisk.  Could someone tell me what OS ID code to
use?  I tryed 129 (Minix ver 4.? and later) which seemed to work.
Also, is the list of the partition meant to "garbage-up" when
you modify a partition record?  Whatever it did works but
pfdisk is useless now because I can't get a good listing from it.
Is this a known bug?  I would recompiler it, bnt my compiler seems
to have taken a permenant (sp) vacation.

The pfdisk package (uploaded to tsx-11 and nic.funet) already does what 
you want. 
Ad 1) There is a command to set the number of sectors, heads and cylinders.
      It is also possible to compile these numbers in the code (although
      this won't work for a distribution version for the root-disk).

I had the same problem. I just added "/usr/src/linux/lib/ctype.o"
to the list of object-files when I linked ps. (so I did something like:
gcc -o ps ps.o psdata.o update_db.o /usr/src/linux/lib/ctype.o.
This solved my problem with ps. 

I have another problem with "free" though. I get the following output:

My swap-partition is on /dev/hdb2. When I make /dev/hdn2 a link to /dev/hdb2
the output is what you would expect. What's happening?

   Hmmm, does a 'rm swap-file-name' works ?

   You obviousually have to cut the call to swapon from your rc.

   If you have a swap partition, well just make an fdisk on it.

mkfs, of course -- fdisk won't help much :-)

Subject: Adding RAM
Date: 24 Mar 92 17:06:14 GMT

Hi,

        I have Linux 0.95a running fine on my 386 clone with 4Mb (80Mb IDE,
AMI bios, OPTI chip set).  Yesterday I bought 4Mb of RAM to bring my machine
up to 8Mb. The power on memory test OK's the new RAM; MSDOS runs fine; Minix
runs fine, recognizing all the memory.  However, Linux gives a kernel panic:
free block list corrupted, or some such.  I think it unlikely that the RAM is
at fault since I've switched the new RAM for the original 4Mb and everything
works fine.  Is this a known problem?  Do I have to reconfigure the kernel?
Any help would be appreciated.

#include <excuses.h>

First a few comments-

Alan B Clegg - subj: ABC release.
        I would like to suggest that in the packages containing binaries
you include a list of files with their checksums.  Many of us (me for 
example have to move the files though quite a few networks and to quote
Linux "bad things happen".

Jim Winstead - subj: install script.
        Great job, but could you pander to my laziness and have it ask me
if I want my BASH bashed.

To those installing gcc-1.40 this should be of help. 


        These are instructions for installing gcc-1.40 on Linux-0.95a.
Lunux-0.95a contains everything you need to install and run gcc 1.40
however an editor would certainly be helpful for testing.

You will need to get include-0.12.tar and newgcc.tar to your linux system.
It is probably easiest to uncompess them  and Rawrite them to floopies under
DOS. You should also read newgcc.FAQ.

Now cd to / and untar the include files (include-0.12.tar)
        For example if you have rawritten your uncompressed include-0.12
files to a 5 1/4 inch disk put your floppy in drive a: and type

tar -tvf /dev/at0 | more
   (This shows you what files are in the tar, as well as detecting some errors. 
     If Murphy's laws do not apply to you, you can skip it.)

tar -xvf /dev/at0
   (This should write a bunch of *.h files into /usr/include . If you are 
      paranoid go to /usr/include and look at some of them.)

Now cd to /usr and untar newgcc.tar.
        If you are working with rawritten floppies put in the floppy with
                newgcc.tar and

tar -tvf /dev/at0 | more (for people with healthy paranoia)
tar -xvf /dev/at0

        This will overwrite some of the include files from include-0.12,
don't panic, thats why you untarred the include files first.)

Now gcc looks for ccp and cc1 in /usr/local/lib while they are actually in
/usr/lib so you will need to create symbolic links with

ln -s /usr/lib/cc1 /usr/local/lib
ln -s /usr/lib/cpp /usr/local/lib


Now to test it create the file hello.c

#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
  printf("Hello Linux\n")
}


and compile it by

gcc -o hello hello.c

and run it

./hello

I spend several hours last night trying to get 0.95a to work on my PC to
no avail.  0.12 has worked fine since I installed it back in January...

When I boot I get several HD timeout messages on both my hard drives...but
it gets through this and says "Partition tables OK" and boots...everything
seems to work ok for a while and I start untarring stuff (backup, gcc2.0, etc)
...only the first couple of untars work...I use the following command:

        tar zxvf /dev/at0

the floppy drive will be accessed for a while but it never starts untarring...
I can ^C out of it but after this happens once I am unable to untar anything
large...I have started from scratch by:

        mkfs /dev/hdb4 20757 -c
        mount /dev/hdb4 /mnt
        mktree /mnt
        mkdev /mnt
        install /mnt

but the same thing happens eventually...

My system is a 16MHz 386sx with AMI BIOS, 4 meg RAM, 2 MFM drives...my root
partition is on the fourth partition of the second drive...the first is a DOS
partition and the 2nd and 3rd are not used (edpart set it up this way)...any
help would be appreciated on this matter...

Step one, uncompress kermit.tar.Z into kermit.tar.  If you are
doing this on a PC, get an MS-DOS compress/uncompress.  Otherwise,
do this on your system onto which you FTP'ed the compressed files,
before transferring them to your PC.

Step two, use rawrite.exe to write out kermit.tar to the floppy disk.

Step three, under LINUX, attach to the directory you want to untar
the file into.

Step four, "tar xf /dev/PS0".  This will extract all entries from
the "tar" file on the floppy disk into the current directory
(or as modified by the pathnames in the "tar" file).

rawrite does NOT write out a mountable file system.  It writes
out the file (in sequential sectors) directly on the floppy disk.
tar then treats the floppy as if it were a single disk file, with
the data stored sequentially.

I have been playing with Linux for a while now and I've noticed
two odd things that maybe somebody can help me with:

1.- Why can I execute a program (has the execute permissions set) that is
in my present working directory but not the path variable???  I have to
copy it to a directory in the path to run it!

2.- I have noticed that you can do a 'cd directory' even if you don't
have the access permissioms for that directory (non root login)!  You can't
do a 'ls' once you are in, but I think that you shouldn't be allowed to
'cd' into the directory in the first place if you don't have the access
permissions.  Any comments?
