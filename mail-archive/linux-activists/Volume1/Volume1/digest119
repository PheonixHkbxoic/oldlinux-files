Kudos to Linus for linux.  

I got .95 installed on my machine and am able to boot
from the HD.  My problem is that I can't mount floppies that were created with
rawrite under DOS.  The error that comes back with fsck is bad magic number in
the super-block.  Drive A is 1.44 and B is 1.2. 

For some reason, I can mount the rootimages of both .12 and .95 (I used DOS & rawrite).
If I make a fs under linux, with the mkfs /dev/PS0 1440, it works fine and is
mountable.  Do I need to modify rawrite?  What am I missing here?  

Sorry if this is a FAQ.  Thanks in advance,

OK, since you asked, here is the assembler code for Trident VGA
detection.  I got it from sources/system/linux/boot/setup.S.
Try putting this code fragment into a MASM or TASM file (with any
necessary changes to get it to assemble) and see if it works with
you card under DOS.  If it does, then it's a LINUX problem.  If it
doesn't then it's a problem with the code itself.

nopara: mov     dx,#0x3c4               ! Check Trident 'clues'
        mov     al,#0x0e
        out     dx,al
        inc     dx
        in      al,dx
        xchg    ah,al
        mov     al,#0x00
        out     dx,al
        in      al,dx
        xchg    al,ah
        mov     bl,al           ! Strange thing ... in the book this wasn't
        and     bl,#0x02        ! necessary but it worked on my card which
        jz      setb2           ! is a trident. Without it the screen goes
        and     al,#0xfd        ! blurred ...

        and     ah,#0x0f
        cmp     ah,#0x02
        jne     notrid

I don't know where these 'clues' came from.  Do they work on
any else TRIDENT VGA card?

I'd do it myself, but I don't have a TRIDENT card to test it out on B^).

Subject: Help on as86?
Date: 18 Mar 92 19:04:44 GMT

Hi fello Linux fans,

I have some problem with using 'as86' on Linux 0.95. It complains even
when I tried to assemble crt0.s from the Linux kernel source.

I looked up in Linux kernel's makefile (linux/Makefile), which uses the '-0
-a' option, and I tried that without success.

Do I forget something here? either the option switch, or simply the wrong
assembler?

I also tried to use gcc2.0 to compile a hello-world program. It requires
'as' and 'ld', so I linked my as86 to as and ld86 to ld respectively.
But it fails in a similar fashion.

The as86 and ld86 I have now were from Linux' distribution file
"binaries/compilers/as86.tar.Z" from FTP site tsx-11.mit.edu.

Could somebody help me out?

Thanks in advance.

Sorry for taking so long moving IPC over to .95. I'm having to add a 
few more features to VFS before I can get it to support pseudo directories.
It may take a while longer but it should save a lot of future work since
the kernel will be much more modular, and will make it possible to
have things like
/proc
/inet 
etc.

I really think we should try to be innovative rather than just being 
compatible. I think this is one of the biggest things Linux has going
for it.

Last night, I attempted to create a ZIP archive of several files
I was working with.  Using LINUX 0.95, I called the zip program
which I FTP'ed from tsx-11.  It compressed several files of less
that 20K, but stopped after compressing a file of approximately
64K.  I then tried compressing that file seperately, and got the
same error.

The error was EINVAL, but that didn't give me any useful information.

If someone wants to look into this, I'll send her or him the file
that caused the problem.

Thanks.

I am planning to purchase a 386 - based laptop PC, with a hard drive of
course, immediately after graduation. I would like to install Linux on
this machine. Has anyone been able to install Linux on a laptop, and
if so, what brand, model, et cetera? I don't want to buy a machine that
can't run the ultimate hacker's OS. (-:

In addition, has anyone yet been able to add any sort of Ethernet support
to Linux at all?

Ok.  I have been playing with the SCSI driver stuph and almost have the
driver for the CSC {Fast/Flash}cache controller working.  Translation:
I can mount the HD and it doesen't lock up too often.  Next question:  
I have two 1.7G drives that work flawlessly under DOS with
my controller, but linux requires 64M partition limits.

Now, that is 53 partitions I have to make!  I haven't yet dug through the
source to see if this is easy to modify, is it?  Is there a plan to eliminate
this bottleneck?  Any comments, hints, tips and or suggestions appreciated.

Once VFS is fully in Linux, it will be trivial to implement neat things 
such as Berkely FFS and LFS, the pageable RAM filesystem (great for 
/tmp) , DOS FAT file system, etc.

Then you'll be saved.  However... until then...

I propose that you spend your time in implementing shared libraries,
this will drastically reduce the size of the binaries (for example,
/bin/ls is 13336 bytes long on a SunOS 4.1.1 machine while using
122880 on Ultrix), among other advantages of shared libraries
(bug-fixing in the libraries without recompilation of the binaries)

I tried to  install 3 things last night:
ckermit 5a (179) beta
textutils 1.3
shellutils 1.6

I have various unresolved refs and so on but at one point I get the
complaint that it can't find libg.a.  I've already installed gcc 2.0
and it worked fine to build the linux .95 kernel.  Does it want
libg++ or libgcc which I have or do I have to get libg.a also?

At this point I could probably use the recently proposed repository
of people's porting experiences for particular packages (I picked
the above mentioned versions because they were higher than what I
found for linux on the ftp sites).

Just a quick question, probably a FAQ, sorry, I was just wondering 
how much disk space the bare bones Linux OS takes up, how many
megs of RAM is required. Also, can DOS an LINUX coexist on two 
partitions of a hard drive with the user selecting between them upon 
bootup?  Has anyone thought of porting X-Windows to Linux?

Hello,

a few comments first I like linux even if I can only run it from floppies
(so I cut cost in building my 386 buy using what I could from my old xt)
I just read that the .95a will have cat and more added... great
I was getting tired of cp ????.?? /dev/tty0

my biggest problem/question is what do all these extra commands do
I know the standard ones, but looking through and seeing commands
that aren't very helpfull and having to guess what they do and
then having them do nothing visible and reporting no help not even
a list of options. is there a list someone of what each comand does?
or atleast a list of options... I know what I want is man pages...

if someone could take type up something very brief maybe even 5 lines
per command (like mknod creates devices.. well... sort of...)
noting to be the end all of end all.. but something to give those that
like to play with things something to do... a direction.

and my major question.. beyond what goes where is I'm used to only
using a multi user system.. someone else created the account, and 
set up most of the programs, etc.... and I'm used to owning and setting up
a single user system (pc, dos etc) so I haven't more then a clue what
needs to be done to admin a unix system.... and advice..help
documentation or referals would be appresiated.. any good books?

thanks in advance.....

I'll post the FAQ pretty soon (in fact just after this mail). 
I do *NOT* think it's bug free, I just download 0.95a (so I have not

and 0.95a).
Feel free to contact me, with FAQ in the subject of your mail. I
