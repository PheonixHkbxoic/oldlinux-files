The init/main.c code in the kernel sets up that home directory, and sets the
TERM and HOME environments too. The other environmentvariables are set up
by the shell.

Yes. You will have to use the login stuff to change root's homedir.

1. Be sure that you run version 1.1 and not 1.0. 1.0 had some problems with
the ttybuffers being full of garbage.

2. Did you turn the modem into silent mode with  an "ATE" command? If
not then getty is confused by the "CONNECT" message.

3. Did you use the -m flag to getty? This is recommended.

Set your terminal-emulator to use xon/xoff. Getty intelligently adjusts for
parity and such.

Things get very BAD when you try to implement them.
The idea is that things are NOT so simple as they appear !
Let's leave DOS out... Please !

Yes of course it is nice...
It will be nice to have a CRAY instead !
The 386 is NOT a cray. 64 tasks with 64 mb each is a very reasonable limit
If you need much more then you probably need another machine too.
I am not sayng that linux should not be improved I am sayng that 
there are others thing FIRST !

Why don't you try and have fun ?
As long as things are NOT in the kernel the worse that should happen
is that your process dies.. :-)

Yes, but even that one uses the kernel for addition and multiplications,
I think (unless it uses some all-integer cordic algorithm, which I
doubt). Thus the math-emulator in the kernel still gets called (a lot)
when doing things like sin etc: this is /extremely/ slow, and is the
reason floating point performance was better in the older versions. The
math-emulator has to calculate effective addresses etc for every add or
mul: much slower than just a simple function call.

Some people may wonder why use an emulator at all, if it's slower than
having function calls. There are reasons: never fear. One of the reasons
is that gcc for the 386 assumes at least minimum float-emulation, unless
you want to patch every new version of gcc that comes out. An equally
pressing reason is that with an emulator, the /same/ binary will work on
both a 387-machine and on one without any coprocessor: no need for the
soft-float libraries (well, right now it's still needed for sin/sqrt
etc, but that will change eventually (not in 0.13)).

Probably an extreme example, but yes, it pays to have a coprocessor.
Most (well, many anyway) people probably do, and those that haven't got
one probably never wanted to calculate a lot in the first place.

libsoft uses the coprocessor when present for most things: all the
things that are present in the kernel (additions, loads etc). Libsoft
is used only for the more complex functions, which don't have kernel
support yet (and even they get /much/ faster with a coprocessor: they
are built up from adds/muls).

What in the world is a Undefined symbol: __stderr in text segment???? No 
matter how many different versions of GCC and no matter how many different
ways I go about installing it, I can *NEVER* get a damned thing compiled
with out error coming up somewhere. It usually happens when the compiler

Date: Fri, 28 Feb 1992 15:56:12 GMT

Well, last night I bit the bullet, and repartitioned my 80MB drive 1
from 3 26MB SSTOR partitions, into 2 32MBs, an 8MB, and a 4MB.

I rebooted LINUX (which is on my 70MB drive 0), and tried to mount
the new 8MB partition under /files.  I ran fdisk to get the block
sizes (under LINUX), and ran mkfs on the 8 MB partition (/dev/hd7),
and mkswap on the 4 MB partition (/dev/hd6).  when I try and mount
/dev/hd7 /files, mount complains about not being able to open a
lock-file.  Of course it doesn't say WHAT lock file, or WHERE,
or WHY it can't open it!  As a control test, I tried to mount
a floppy filesystem (empty) that I had made when I installed
LINUX on /dev/PS1, and got the same error message.  fsck can find
no errors on the devices I'm trying to mount.  Can anyone explain
what is wrong?  Do I need to boot from floppy again, and fsck my
root partition?

Also, anyone know where I can find a swapon binary so I can 
use the 4MB of swap space that mkswap says I created?

Thanx.

Hi there,

    I am a newcomer in OS and just begins to learn how does it work.  I have
followed both comp.os.minix and alt.os.linux for a while, and have installed
linux.012 successfully in my 386 machine and quite happy with it.

    Since I am a beginner, linux might be a little bit difficult to me.  I
think PC Minix might be more suitable for me at this moment.

Yes, XON/XOFF isn't quite ready in 0.12 - this in one more of the fixes
for 0.13. The problem is simply that ^Q doesn't correctly wake up the
writing process, so only the buffer already written will be output, and
then the process just sleeps away... Nothing bad happens, it's just not
noticing that it can start writing again.

In my version (and thus 0.13) this is corrected, and ^S/^Q work all
right. There are some other rewrites in there too: tty-io has been
cleaned up a bit.

Subject: Announcement: poeigl 1.2 (init/getty/login)
Date: 29 Feb 92 13:16:26 GMT

I am happy to announce version 1.2 of the poe-IGL package. Once again it should
fix all the reported bugs and defiencies of version 1.1.

Most notably:

* The TERM environment variable is now carried through from the kernel all the
  way to the shell. The termcap field in /etc/inittab is thereby overridden
  by what you choose at boot time. The setting in inittab is still in effect
  for non-console tty's such as modem ports.

* Login now correctly handles passwords longer than 8 characters (ie. it does
  not send the superflous chars to the shell)

* The ERASE char is now set properly by getty.

* Init now handles the HUP and TSTP signals properly.

* Two new commands have been added: users and mesg.
  (Both are small shell scripts, and "users" requires that you have "awk").

The package still includes: init, getty, login, wall, write, UFC-crypt, etc.

In order to get the TERM setting from the boot-time selection an other patch
to init/main.c is necessary. A context-diff against the ORIGINAL 0.12 kernel
is included.

I'm afraid that this release wont make it into 0.13 | 0.95. Oh well.

You can ftp the package from

        ftp.daimi.aau.dk        (130.225.16.27)

in the file

        pub/Linux-source/poeigl-1.2.tar.Z

I also uploaded it to

Now and then I've been getting the cursor in the wrong place.  I
believe this is because "do" is defined as linefeed, and linefeed also
does a CR.  I suggest changing the "do" property from linefeed to
