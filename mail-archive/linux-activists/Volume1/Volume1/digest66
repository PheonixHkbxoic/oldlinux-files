I finally had a free day to finish IPC. I've got tinymush working with it
so I'm pretty confident it will work for any demons. The only thing I'm not
sure about at this point is how to make it into a patch, I've got the old
virtual console patch, floppy patch and this all in the same kernel. If I do
a diff of the present kernel with the old (floppy+vc patch) kernel will this
work right?

Hi,

I just fixed a FP bug in gnulib, a bug in sqrt(0.0) of libsoft.a and put
a new newgcc.tar.Z on tsx-11.mit.edu.

The cc1 now will support dbx. Now gcc will look for /usr/local/lib and
also check /usr/local/gcc-include. Since gcc is the native compiler on
Linux, I don't see why we should use /usr/local for the standard stuffs
of gcc.

The binary utilities have the same names as they in Unix. There is no
prefix 'g'.

When you get the new newgcc.tar.Z, unpack it in /usr. Everything will
fall in the right place.

If you don't have a 387, use -lsoft instead of -lm when you use math
functions.

Some other bugs have been reported in libc.a come with the new gcc
1.40. I am working on gcc 2.0 and a new libc.a. Some of the bugs
in the old libc.a will disappear in the new libc.a. Most of the codes in
./unistd will stay in the new libc.a. But the other parts may be very
different from the old one.

The new libc.a will be ANSI (and BSD?) compatible. I will try to port
as much gnu libc.a as possible, as long as I don't have to change any
syscalls.

I hope someone will take over the old libc.a so that I can spend more
time on the new one. But please send me the bugs. I will make sure it
won't happen in the new one.

BTW, if there is another serious bug in gcc, I will be happy to try to
fix it.

Thanks.

H.J.

Hi gurus:

  I have Linux installed on hardrive and boot using shoelace. Since shoelace
requires a boot partition selection, I need to press a key. Apparently
shoelace does not clear some buffer (I don't know which one) and the key is
still available to linux as it boots. Consequently I cannot set the SVGA modes
as the key left in the buffer becomes the answer to the SVGA mode question.
Could some one tell me a way out of this. In particular, could some one give me
details as to how to clear this buffer containing the key left by shoelace
before the SVGA prompt.

BTW, I don't want to insert a floppy each time to boot. I prefer the shoelace
approach. Please answer, if you can, with this constraint.

Is there any one out there who owns a Gateway PC that has the cntrl-alt-del
(reboot) working. The current code does not seem to pull the
reset line in my PC, and thus simply hang the m/c. An attempt to get out of
protected mode and jump to BIOS reboot address craps my CMOS. Help!!!! I hate
pressing reset button (even though it is meant for that).

Thanks.

Ramesh
