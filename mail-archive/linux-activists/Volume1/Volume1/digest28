Hi there:

    I am trying to port Gnu make and gas to linux without much success.
There was no problem in compiling Gnu gas but in the linking phase Gcc        
complained it couldn't find the library 'libg.a'.  I searched the Gnu ftp
sites and couldn't find 'libg.a', could anybody points me out where to find
it.
    When compiling Gnu make, the compiler said 'couldn't find <nlist.h>', and
quit.  Have anybod succeded in porting them.     

    Any sugguestion is welcomed and I will put out a summary or upload these
two utilities if I have succeeded in porting them.

        Please forgive me if this is already in linux, I'm not where the sources
        are at the moment...

        Another point I would like to bring up is the use of a 16 bit value for
the number of inodes (MINIX is this way, I'm assuming linux is too).  I know,
I know, why would anyone want more than 64K inodes?  Well, as BIG disks are
getting cheaper and cheaper, I want to have some large partitions around.
This is especially useful for things like NEWS, where postings to
multiple groups get linked all over the place.  A decently sized NEWS partition
( 300 Meg or so ) could easily need 80,000 files.

        Just a thought.  (Although I emagine that by now the FS is pretty
much carved in stone.)

I haven't seen the BSD code, so I can't comment on it.  You might consider
looking at porting all or parts of KA9Q NOS if you decide not to use the
BSD code.  It may be closer to what you are looking for.  It has been ported
from PCs to some non Unix boxes that didn't have TCP/IP support built in, and
other machines including Macs.  Let me know if you need info on where to
get the source.

  ...... stuff deleted....

I too had problems with floppy patches. In my case I have no problem with make
but the resulting image is crappy. I am taking up this with Lawrence
(entropy@ee.wpi.edu) and let us see what happens. In the mean time, I suggest
you first make a copy of your files before applying floppy patches. I know
I shouldn't think that you would do otherwise but....

In the light of such problems (I had trouble with lp patches also and gave up
on it) can I suggest that the readme file that goes with the patches should
indicate in what orders the patches should be applied (such as must be
applied to fresh kernel-0.12 or some such thing)

The problem is that bad things happen if you make the first link(), and
then mvdir crashes and doesn't do the unlink().  This results in an
inconsistent filesystem, and it is somewhat undesirable for the
filesystem to be at the mercy of a user program.  This can be alleviated
by only allowing root to do hard links on directories, but that still
means that a root program can accidentally link a directory in two
places and really screw things up.

Also, under your scheme it is up to the program to detect cases where
you're doing a "mvdir /usr/src /usr/src/linux/src".  If you do the link()
and unlink() blindly, they will succeed, but the subdirectory which used
to be /usr/src will end up being disconnected from the filesystem
hierarchy --- and you won't be able to recover those files or even
reclaim the disk space without the help of fsck.

       Okay, okay, race condition?  What the heck *IS* a race
   condition?

A race condition happens when two processes are trying to do something,
and they run into each other.  For example, suppose we used your design
of performing mvdir by doing a link(src, dest) and then a unlink(dest).
Now suppose two users simultaneously issue the commands:

        mvdir /usr/src/linux /src/linux
        mvdir /usr/src/linux /usr/src/sys

Now then, suppose that the order of the links and unlink happen in this
order

User 1: link("/usr/src/linux", "/usr/linux");
User 2: link("/usr/src/linux", "/usr/src/sys");
User 1: unlink("/usr/src/linux");
User 2: unlink("/usr/src/linux");       (fails)

Now you have one directory appearing in two different places, which is
bad but not a catastrophe.  However, there may be much worse race
conditions, depending on the specifics of how the code is structured.  
Race conditions are notoriously hard to debug, since they happen so
rarely.  The phase of the moon has to be just right.....

If you want to find out more about race conditions, you should probably
read a OS design book, like the Minix: Design and Implementation book.

You have to put a full device number in the word reserved for the
swap-device: the logic is exactly the same as for the root device.  Thus
if you want /dev/hd2 to be your swap-device, you'll have to write a 2
(minor nr) into byte 506, and a 3 (= harddisk) into byte 507.  You can
use virtually the same program to make a swap-device as you used to
change the boot-device (just change the offset to 2 less). 

> Does that mean swapping is not working?

Try to change both the bytes (506 and 507) and things should work.

Other error messages are "unable to find swap signature" and "bad
swap-space bitmap" which both indicate that there is something wrong
with the swap-partition: you probably haven't made it a swap-device with
mkswap. Those messages mean that at least linux finds the device you
indicated: it just cannot make sense of the first page on it which is
used to verify that it really /is/ a swap-device, so that linux won't
overwrite something important.

> How do I know if it is swapping?

You'll notice :).  First of all, linux tells you so with "Adding swap:
XXX pages of swap space" at bootup, and if you start running out of real
memory, you'll note that the harddisk starts working overtime, and
things slow down.  Generally 2 meg RAM means you swap constantly with
gcc, 4 meg means you'll swap occasionally when trying to optimize big
files (and having other things active, like make), and with 8 M or ram I
haven't swapped yet, but I seldom do heavy computing in more than one
VC.

I have a super VGA card (an older ATI Wonder), and for whatever reason

Is there any way to set screen into 80 x 50 or 80 x 43 mode?

Also, after connecting through a modem using kermit to another unix
system, I sometimes get stuck in a mode where everything I type or

fine, but as soon as I return from it I am back on line 25.  stty rows 25
doesn't do the trick either.

Hi to the world of Linux users!

I am a reasonable experienced (although previously unprivilidged) Unix and DOS
user who has just made the jump to Linux (v0.12). I have never had to perform
"system management" type things before so I thought I'd better ask a couple of
questions before I destroy (again (exit is such a fun command for root to use
:-)) my file system.

I have 33Mhz i386 based box with 4Mb RAM (pitiful I know but soon to be
upgraded to 8) and a 110Mb IDE hard drive (+ floppies of both major types). I
have a fairly permanent null modem cable connected to a DOS box on COM2, a
mouse on COM1 and a modem installed as COM3. Now...

1. A hunt through the source for Linux only seemed to cater for serial port
rates of 2400 baud... are faster (i.e. up to 115,200 baud) available. I would
like to be able to run a decent (and cheap) comms link to the DOS box (laplink
type of thing). Is interrupt driven comms a viable option in Linux?

2. COM3 (or favourite euphemism for) support? Can I use my modem on com3 with
kermit/other comms software? If so, how?

3. Shoelace... I have two partitions on my disk- one for DOS and one for Linux.
Can I boot linux entirely from hard disk 'cos booting from floppy is a pain in
the neck.... is this what shoelace does? I have got it all installed so that I
boot from floppy and then it all runs from hard disk... what do I do now?

4. If fast comms on a serial port are available, what is the best way to
implement a server to respond to serial port activity? Does a blocking read on
the serial port impose a minimal load on the system or is there a better way?

Confused but extremely happy to have UNIX without an overdraft (show me a
student with money).

Does POSIX specify that a filename has to 14 chars long to be portable?
I dislike a the filename length limitation (having been used to Ultrix).
I agree it is better than DOS but couldn't it be increased to say 31
atleast? Am I in the minority on this or do most others feel this way too.
Or is this restriction going to be lifted once we get a VFS and linux
has it own "native" file system?
