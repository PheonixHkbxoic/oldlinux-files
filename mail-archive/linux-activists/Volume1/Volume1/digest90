Stupid question : did you add mmap to libc.a with ar?  If not, 
you will get these errors.

That was the one omission.  Zorst sent out a note saying that it should 
be 

#define MAP_FIXED 0x10
>

You'll notice that #define MAP_FIXED 3 does not work, as it will break this
case statement 

 switch (flags & MAP_TYPE)
        {
        case MAP_SHARED:

where MAP_TYPE is 
#define MAP_TYPE 0xf                    /* mask for sharing types */

And MAP_SHARED, MAP_PRIVATE are 1 and 2 respectively.

Recompile the kernel and demos with a correct mman.h, and remember to make 
under mmap/libc/, puting the resulting object code into your 
libc.a

Linux 0.95 is now available on TSX-11.MIT.EDU.  Sites in the U.S. will
probably find it much faster to go to TSX-11 than to try to use the
(overtaxed) trans-atlantic link to NIC.FUNET.FI.  :-)

Subject: 0.95 serial support still has problems
Date: 9 Mar 92 08:55:12 GMT

The new kernel is probably somewhat better than 0.12 about dropping
input on the serial lines.  (It feels about the same as the version of
0.12 I was running before.  But I had done a lot of work to speed it
up.  So I think Linus' changes have done the equivalent of what I
did.)  However there are some other things that make SLIP over
/dev/tty64 still not work very well:

  (1) ka9q still comes screeching to a halt whenever anything
        else is running.  The simplest test is to do a loop
        in the shell in another window.  Is it possible that
        there's some problem in the handling of select in
        the scheduler?

  (2) displaying a whole screen is if anything worse than
        before.  It's like the screen output is interfering
        with the serial input.  So there are generally one or more
        pauses when refreshing a screen in emacs over telnet.

Subject: Re: Linux-0.95
Date: 9 Mar 92 10:02:27 GMT

After about a hour of playing around with 0.95, I've found a couple
of problems.  Here's my configuration:

  - kernel built from source, using GCC 1.40.  (I don't have access
        to GCC 2.0.)
  - otherwise I'm using a 0.12 system, i.e. no changes in libraries, etc.

1) system hung, probably in serial or tty code.  I was experimenting
with performance of SLIP.  So all I was doing was serial I/O and
screen display.  When I increased the TCP window size to 1024 the
system hung, having displayed a few lines of garbage on the screen.
The obvious suspicion is that the serial code can't handle getting
more characters than its buffer size.  I tried increasing the tty
buffer size to 2048.

2) I was unable to rebuild the system under 0.95.  gcc claimed it saw
unterminated conditionals.  There were other signs of problems with
the hard disk during this: "Unexpected HD interrupt".  I tried
removing the warning message and reset.

3) While trying to FTP in the image of the root disk, I got a panic
"free_page_tables called with wrong alignment".  At this point I would
have been doing serial line I/O and a small amount of disk I/O
(writing the file).

I've backed out of testing 0.95 for the moment.

most people.  Please note that it is a *GUIDELINE* and is not *REQUIRED*, but
if most people follow the guidelines, we all get along a lot better.

If you have comments/questions about this document, and you are not on the
linux-standards mailing list, I would ask that you join the list.  The request
address is:  linux-standards-request@banjo.concert.net.  Please try to keep
debate off the news group, and on the mailing list.

For those of you on the linux-standards list, the verticle bars in column one
represent the only changes from draft 2.

==== SNIP HERE ====

The following is being submitted by Alan Clegg [abc@concert.net] on behalf
of the Linux-Standards list as the standard for directory file structure
under Linux.

Revision 1.0

Complete implementation of this file structure is completely voluntary,
and will not be enforced, but will be recommended.  This specification
is released as guidelines for people porting and writing software for
the Linux Operating System to allow easy software installation, upgrade, and
tailoring on already installed systems.

Root Directory:

        Files:
                {none defined by spec}

        Directories:
                bin dev etc home lib mnt usr
        
        Rationale:
                The root directory should not be cluttered with files or
                directories, and should contain no user programs.

/bin Directory:

        Files:
                sh init mount umount dd cat ls fsck {and as needed}

        Directories:
                {none defined by spec}

        Rationale:
                The /bin directory should contain programs that are vital
                to the restoration of other file systems in the case of 
                a corrupting crash.  No executable in /bin should require
                any other file system to be mounted to execute correctly.

/dev Directory:

        Files:
                {device files}

        Directories:
                {none define by spec}

        Rationale:
                Standard UNIX device files.  This directory should contain
                device entries for all devices that are supported in the
                standard kernel, even if the hardware device does not exist
                on the system.

/etc Directory:

        Files:
                mtab passwd rc ttytab {and as needed}

        Directories:
                {none defined by spec}

        Rationale:
                Standard location of files required during system boot.  Files
                in this directory are usually system specific.  Most will
|               require human intervention during system upgrade.  /etc will
|               also contain administrative binaries that should not be in
|               the normal users PATH.

/home Directory:
        
        Files:
                NONE

        Directories:
                {one per user excepting root}

        Rationale:
                Standard location of users home directories.  Will most likely
                be a mounted file system once the system is up.  root's home
                directory should be /.

/lib Directory:

        Files:
                {libraries required for system initialization}

        Directories:
                {none defined by spec}

        Rationale:
                To keep the size of the root partition small (if separate from
                /usr), the files in this directory should only be ones required
                by files in the root partition.

/mnt Directory:
        
        Files:
                NONE

        Directories:
                NONE

        Rationale:
                Standard mount point for external (transient) file systems.
                Must be available for sub-system installation.  Should remain
                as an empty directory.

/tmp Directory:
        
        Files:
                NONE
        
        Directories:
                NONE

        Rationale:
                Temporary file space available for general program use.  May
                become a mounted partition upon system boot.

/usr Directory:

        Files:
                {none defined by spec}

        Directories:
                adm bin spool local lib etc man include src tmp

        Rationale:
                /usr is the mount point for the second major (after root)
                hierarchy of file structure and is discussed in the next
                section.

/usr/adm Directory:

        Files:
                {none defined in spec}

        Directories:
                {none defined in spec}

        Rationale:
                Location of log files and accounting information.

/usr/bin Directory:

        Files:
                {all executable files from standard distribution not contined
                 in /bin}

        Directories:
                {none defined in spec}

        Rationale:
                contains 'drop-in' executables that are considered to be
                standard to the UNIX system.  These files should NOT be
                Linux specific, but should have the same function as their
                UNIX equivalents.

/usr/etc Directory:
        
        Files:
                {none defined in spec}

        Directories:
                {none defined in spec}

        Rationale:
                contains configuration files for any files in /usr/bin. helps
                to keep /etc clean and small.

/usr/spool Directory:

        Files:
                {none defined in spec}

        Directories:
                uucp mail

        Rationale:
                containes spool files for mail, printing, uucp transfer, etc.
                May be a mount point for another volume.

/usr/local Directory:

        Files:
                NONE
        
        Directories:
                bin lib etc man src

        Rationale:
                contains files local to the specific system.  will not be
                modified by upgrade process. 

/usr/lib Directory:

        Files:
                libc.a crt0.s {and as needed}

        Directories:
                {none defined in spec}

        Rationale:
                location for library files required for multi-user system
                operation.  This is the directory where program libraries
|               should reside.  /usr/lib will also contain binaries required
|               to support programs residing in /usr/bin.

/usr/man Directory:

        Files:
                NONE
        
        Directories:
                man1 man2 man3 man4 man5 man6 man7 man8

        Rationale:
                Contains manual pages for programs that are standard with
                Linux.

/usr/include Directory:

        Files:
                {programmers include files}

        Directories:
                {as needed}

        Rationale:
                Standard place for system include files.

/usr/src Directory:
        
        Files:
                NONE
        
        Directories:
                bin lib linux usr.bin usr.lib

        Rationale:
                Contains source code for all applications in the release.
                /usr/src/linux contains directories required for kernel builds.

/usr/tmp Directory:

        Files:
                NONE


        Directories:
                NONE

        Rationale:
                Used as additional scratch space for programs.  If /tmp is
                a mounted file system, /usr/tmp may be a symbolic link to
                /tmp.

I have another idea, why not put all freed text pages in a hash table,
and bypass the buffer cache for demand loading. On a page fault in the
code space you check if the needed page is in this hash table (after
having tried to share this page). You could even use the sticky bit on
executables to favor some pages when you need to evict a page from this
table if you need a free page.

This way you use the buffer cache for all normal file access and all of
your free memory as page cache.

I am all for this.  There are times when I need large buffers, and others
when I need large user space.  They are not usually simultaneous.  At
the moment, I have been changing main.c, but I don't want to have to
keep on changing the size.  I was thinking about putting somehting in 
the boot code, along the lines of SVGA setup to select buffer size,
but I think Linux should do it itself.

I would be very nice if Linux automagically and dynamically used the 
optimum amounts of memory for buffers, executables and swapping.  Since
the kernel is really the only place this is known, it should be there.

It will also have the advantage of making Linux appear faster - a good 
thing.  I can't wait for all the Ms-Dos weenies to start on the 'X under
Windows/Desqview runs 6x faster then Linux on the same machine!'

Hi there,

The FAQ needs some slight changes, due to the modification done by
Linus in the 0.95 release of Linux.
I hope the next release will be ready at the end of the next week (mid
March). So please, don't ask for it before that time.

Happy installation, and remind the vote for comp.os.linux
