Linux runs fine on the machine I use. It is a 486/33, 120 M IDE drive, 4
megs memory. Brand is something called 'comdex'. Just another clone I
think. SVGA trident card with 1 meg memory. Nice and stable.

I've got a friend that uses Linux all the time.  This is his configuration  
(to the best of my knowledge):  486-33, 4Meg, 120 M hard disk, 1.2M disk  
drive (A:), 1.44M disk drive (B:), SVGA.  He has had no problems at all.  I  
have run into some strange problems also.  I tried to run it on a PS/2-80.   
It started up and looked like it was going to work, but then after it asked  
me to choose a video mode and I responded, it gave me an error:   
copy_to_cooked: missing queues.  At that point, it just died.  I tried the  
same thing on an old XT with a 386Inboard.  I just kept getting those strange  
errors like were listed:
ax 123
bx 141
cx 34235
dx 0914
Let me ask a question and see if this stimulates any ideas.  I tried using a  
PS/2 that would boot up on 1.44 and it didn't work.  Could that be a  
peculiarity with Linux?  Maybe it doesn't like 1.44M drives on some machines.   
I have seen other people post here and they use PS/2's and Linux is a bit  
crippled, but it works.

Subject: More questions about Linux :-)
Date: 15 Feb 92 16:07:44 GMT


Hello !

Few more questions about Linux :-)

1) I have seen the draft 2 for the filesystem it seems fairly complete to
   me and I think it is time for it to be published. When will this 
   happen ?

2) As it is now there is no /vmlinux file in the root directory. The
   standard vay to boot is to boot all the kernel from floppy. I haven't
   tried shoelace... so I can't know if that is the solution. What I would
   like is to have a SMALL boot code in the floppy that loads /vmlinux and
   execute it. Is this possible ? Will it be done in the next release ?

3) Related to the above question there is the problem of the ps command
   that now uses an ioctl to do it's job. This is not very standard.
   Usually what ps does is to use the symbols in /vmlinux to look in
   /dev/kmem for the right stuff. Of course to have a ps like this we need
   a /vmlinux and a /dev/kmem working. Will it be done ?

4) I just bought a book about UNIX system V system calls (Release 4 ) it is
   quite useful since it describes the error codes and when they happens
   ( In additions to the availables syscalls in AT&T Unix )
   and it is fairly complete. I heard thet SYS V r 4 is POSIX compatible.
   Is this true ? . If it is compatible will be possible to try to follow
   part of this book ? 
   BTW SunOs is going to be SysVr4 with Solaris .....
   ( If anybody is interested I will email the books details )

5) I am writting the format program. It will allow you to examine the
   partitions of DOS Hd and change them. I started the coding.. but I would
   like to know if somebody has already done it :-)

This is caused by an error on my part. The utmp2.c routines try to open
/etc/utmp as O_RDWR, even when not running as root. It's been fixed in
my new and improved :-) package: poeigl.tar.Z available from ftp.daimi.aau.dk
See separate announcement...

BTW. permissions on /etc/utmp and /etc/wtmp should be -rw-r--r--, we dont'
want to make the same mistake as Sun, making utmp world writable.

I have just ftp'ed my package of init/getty/login for Linux to:

        ftp.daimi.aau.dk        file: /pub/Linux-source/poeigl.tar.Z
        nic.funet.fi            file: /pub/OS/Linux/incoming/poeigl.tar.Z

There are actually 2 inits, namely a hacked version of qpl-init, but it
doesn't work very well, and a more SysV like init that I wrote myself. It
works very well for me.

The getty program is a port of agetty posted to comp.sources.misc.

The login program is a port of BSD login first to HPUX then to Linux.

For init to work really well you should patch your kernel to run init as
process 1 instead of /etc/rc. But you can test it without that patch.

There's even a README file this time. :-)

The package still contains the complete UFC code, plus who, last and hostname
utils.

Try it, and let me know what you think.

I hope this will be in 0.13...

As an aside: I wrote about a bug in the kernel concering the check in 
check_char_dev() in fs/open.c of tty->session == 0. As an experiment I removed
that check and built a new kernel, and the problems disappeared! 

I doubt that this is a good way to solve it though.

Linus mentioned using an od in a recent posting.  Where

I've just put my copy of mtools on athos.rutgers.edu:/pub/linux.  This
is reflected onto banjo.concert.net, which would probably be a better
place to get it.  mtoolbin.tar.Z is the binaries and formatted man
pages, mtoolsrc.tar.Z is the sources.  This is based on the most
recent mtools I could find, which supports large DOS disk partitions.
I've modified it slightly, to allow a Unix filename of "-" to indicate
standard in or standard out in mwrite and mread.  This allows things
like my backup script, which does a tar piped into mwrite.

You may need to modify devices.c to match your system's floppy setup.
It's currently set so that a: is /dev/at0 and b: is /dev/PS1, I think.
(I confess I'm not entirely sure how that code works, as I only use
this software with the hard disk.)

I've tested the code carefully with hard disk files, and not at all
with floppy files.

I think many people now believe it's a mistake to have programs
reading kernel memory.  This makes programs highly dependent upon the
structure of the kernel.  E.g. under SunOS, whenever you get a new
version of the kernel, you have to change ps and the sharable
libraries on which it depends.  In a new system, I'd strongly
recommend using some method other than /dev/kmem for programs like ps.
Preferably it should be a system call that you can use to ask for
specific data.  This allows kernel data structures and variable names
to be changed without affecting programs, since the system call can
reformat the data.  In my view, /dev/kmem is a remnant of the early
Unix philosophy that almost any hack is acceptable if it avoids the
need for adding something to the kernel.  This makes sense on
PDP-11's, but on larger systems I'm willing to accept a bit of grwoth
in the kernel to avoid hacks like programs that have to understand the
kernel data structures.  Please, let's stamp out /dev/kmem and any
other dependencies on kernel data structures in Linux.

I'm not sure I'd use an ioctl for this.  I suggest adding a system
call specifically for getting information from the kernel.  I'd
suggest looking at the TOPS-20 calls as a model.  I'm a bit hazy on
details, but as I recall, you passed the system call a list of
descriptors saying what you wanted.  Each descriptor was a table
number or name, an offset into the table, a location to put it, and
the amount of memory you had available at that offset.  The table and
offset was because often you needed lists, e.g. lists of jobs, but
sometimes you might only be interested in one item.  In the first case
you'd give an offset of zero (or -1, meaning the whole thing?)  and
pass a large data area.  In the second case you'd give the offset of
the job you wanted, and pass a small data area.  By passing more than
one thing in a single system call, you allow the kernel to guarantee
that you get consistent information, something not possible by reading
/dev/kmem.

I think there have been other proposals in the Unix context, e.g.
/proc.  If they also give independence from kernel data structures,
that's fine with me.
