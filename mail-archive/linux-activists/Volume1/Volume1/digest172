FYI, I got Linux 0.95a to work with my two IDE drives by tweaking
controller_ready() in hd.c:

  used 0.12 inb_p test : inb_p(HD_STATUS)&0xc0 != 0x40
                            instead of
                         inb_p(HD_STATUS) & 0x80

  boosted max retry count by *5

Nice to have a working system again!

Hello, I've got a major problem with installing LINUX, and any help would be
greatly appreciated!

I got Linux's bootimage and rootimage on 2 3.5" floppies, and followed all
instructions regarding installations.  Everything worked as expected (I
helped a friend to install Linux on his computer a few days ago, and now
I'm installing it on mine) UP TO THE POINT when I tried to boot from the
hard disk.

Ok, so after formatting, copying, etc.  I go and edit my bootimage disk to
reflect my HD, i.e. I put 0x02 and 0x03 at the correct location on the 
floppy (Linux is on my 1st HD, 2nd partition).  And I insert the bootimage
disk and reboot my machine (I tried both cold/warm with no luck).  I get
as far as "Loading....", and when it's trying to access my HD, I get a
message that's something like "...not found ... kernal panic, etc..."
(sorry, I don't remeber everything right now).


2 friends and I worked on this for tons of time (~11P-6AM?, can't remember),
and I worked on it for a few more hours later that day.  (all this was during
a Friday to Saturday).  Another one of my friends also tried to install Linux
on his 486 machine, and he's getting the same exact error I'm getting.

My machine is a 386/40, with FOREX chipset and AMI BIOS, VGA, 125MB IDE
drive.

The friend that I helped to install Linux had a 386DX/25, with Chip and Tech.
chipset, AMI BIOS, 40MB IDE, SVGA

the 486 machine had OPTi chipset, AMI BIOS, 120MB IDE, SVGA.

The BIOS date on the 486 and 386/40 are newer thean the 386/25 machine.

This sounds like some program is running from /usr - do you have
/usr/bin/bash as your shell? In that case bash is removed from the
directory tree, but it stays on the disk as it might still be needed for
demand-loading. This also would explain the error 16: EBUSY, which just
means that some file on the fs is still in use.

Aw sh*t!  It turns out that Linux only coincidentally worked with the
changes I made.  The real reason seems to be related to the DOS/Linux
rebooting sequence I followed - Linux still won't consistently boot in
my two disk configuration.

I'm going away and shutting up now.

Hmmm... no, I put bash in /bin. BUT looking around, I find that for
some braindead reason I had a copy of rm in /usr/bin, which probably
explains the problem.... I'll be quiet now....

BTW, dvips is also available from archsci.arch.su.oz.au under pub/linux. In
fact you will find the entire ported 3.14 "tex", including metafont etc, in
that directory (thanks to Peter Williams). My ghostscript port is able to
drive the epson LQ that I have to print the ps files produced by this dvips
(which should be functionally same as the one that will be produced by the
fixed version of the above as both are dvips 5.47 by Radical eye software)

Am I the only who noticed there is a bug in free.c? The calculation for
swap device name is wrong. It was

        (swapdev >> 6) + 'a'
        
but should be 

        (swapdev >> 14) + 'a'

Iain, could you please put a patch somewhere? BTW, Linux uses ANSI
standard. I really hope the code for Linux is as close to ANSI as
possilbe.

Raj Manandhar notes that SunOS checks /etc/shells for full path name of
acceptable shells for su.  The Linux su.c has _PATH_BSHELL defined as
/bin/sh.  The code using this needs toifdef out or additional code added
to read /etc/shells.  Does GNU have a su?

I have just got lp working on my pc at home. The 0.12 patches to the kernel did
the trick but had to be applied at different places in the sources. I will 
bring it in tommorow and put it on the system.

The version I have will not necessarily work on all machines as I had to make
some changes to the lp_init() code for my machine. Apparently normal machines
return either 0 or the byte sent during initialization but my machine reliably
sends 170 from ports that exist and 255 from ports that do not. So the code may
need some changes in lp_init() dependent on your machine.

On a similar vein has anybody got (or is anybody working on) a printer daemon?

After building a 0.95a kernel with 0.95 ps patches applied, the new
kernel only reboots repeatingly.  I got different answers, and none
of them seems to hit the point.  The patch to swap.c is obvious and
can easily be done by hand, and the patch for memory.c is ok, it needs
no change.

I was tired when I applied the patches, so I only used make instead of
"make clean;make" like said in the README file.  I think there are some
dependencies of sched.h missing in the makefiles because this is the
only include file which was patched, but I haven't looked at it yet.  I
first wanted to tell you how to fix the problem.

After building a completely new kernel, everything works fine, at least
for me.

I am very impressed on the reaction to my posting, thanks to all who

Why does MINIX fsck each time complain about not cleared inodes?
Linux fsck also has an option for this, but isn't able to repair
them.  Is this a bug or a feature?  Last time I checked, I had a
few hundred of these not cleared inodes.

I recently got the source for GNU tar 1.1 and it compiled with only
slight modifications.  I hate only to have binaries.  Then I did backup
the home directories.  Unfortunately, the disk (dev/at0 mounted on /mnt)
got full and I got the following messages:

  tar: only write 2048 of 10240 bytes to /mnt/michael.tar

  Mounted disk changed - tssk, tssk
  inode in use on removed disk

Well, I think tar meant the current block it tried to write, because
the whole file was a lot longer.  But what does the Message from the
kernel mean???  I didn't change the disk!

When you link /foo/bar to /foo you get

/foo/hd.c
/foo/bar/hd.c
/foo/bar/bar/hd.c
/foo/bar/bar/bar/hd.c

It's a recursion without an end. This situation is avoided by find if it
doesn't follow symbolic links. Of course you shouldn't do links like that ;-)

This is my second post of these questions, please don't be shy :-) and try and
answer or speculate about them:

Hi folks,
I've been giving linux a run. I AM impressed with the quality of of linux (good
work linus). However, I did come up with various problems here and there:
These happened will I was tryimg to compile alternative shells.
Ksh compiled without to many problems if you exclude job control.
On running though it was a bit flakey. when typing 'cd -' it output a random
character and linefeed before it works. This is quite cosmetic. Of a more
serious nature is that it can't handle & at the end of command line; it print
%6291404 29998 %%%-2d%c %5d %-20s % %s
-Oh} ${PATH:= blah, blah, blah
and then it dies! This used to work on minix by the way.
In trying to compile zsh, I had all sort of problems figuring out if linux
was SYSV or BSD or a mixture of both + POSIX that is not in either.
I found out that setpgrp is not an implemented system call (even the prototype
was wrong. -O caused unrecognized insn errors (anybody figure out why?)
Also no utmp.h
In other news today, the adduser package has a crypt.o which has no _crypt  and
refers to ufc_* functions not in the library. I'm using the libc.a that came
with newgcc. Is newlibc a more uptodate one?
Any finally for today, some commands, say mv mostly, output a couple of 
linefeeds and then a couple of prompts. is this a kernel or a shell problem?

Thanks for any hints, and keep up the good work,
Zeyd

Nobody know the IP address of dec1.eecs.wsu.edu?

On the subject of curses, I've compiled ncurses after adding termios stuff
and tried to compile mille. Everything went OK until I typed ./mille and got:
general protection error
Blah, blah, blah.

Oh well, back to the drawing board.
