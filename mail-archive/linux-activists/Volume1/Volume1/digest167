Sorry if this question has been aksed before, but the machine I read news
on has been down for 2 weeks..

I have a 650Mb hard disk that I want to use for DOS and Linux.  The hard
disk controller is mapped as 16 haed, 63 sector, lots of cylinders (forget
exactly how many, but is greater than 1024).
The BIOS can only recognise 16x63x1024=504Mb, which I have setup for DOS.
Can Linux access the remaining 140Mb ?
The controller is a Distributed Processing Technology ESDI board, with
slightly old Firmware.

Thanks

Hi,

Does Linux 0.95a allow printing to LPT1: (parallel port)?

And, has anyone tried compiling ghostscript (Postscript -> other
printer types converter) under Linux.

Thanks,

Subject: Problems with Mtools ...
Date: Fri, 27 Mar 1992 10:30:41 GMT

We have a totally different problem with mtools,
currently compiled with GCC 2.0, with and without the shared librarys:

All things work fine, including mdir, mcd, mwrite, ... on HD (drive c:), FDD 
(drive A: 1.2MB 5.25, drive B: 1.44MB 3.5),
but we can't read large (especially tar'ed) files without errors.
Mcopy and mread both seem to ignore some of the source-data when reading.
These are typically about 10 bytes per 100 k (NO, I didnt read in text-mode)
and so far I know, the only bug-eaten bytes were located as first byte in a 
sector, and ONLY if its first char is 0xFF. Because everything else
just works fine, I suspected an error either in my hardware or in the GCC2.0
library. (I don't believe there's a bug in mtools itself, because everything
seemed ok with gcc 1.40, and mtools uses --- as far as I know --- no function
wich could manifest such a nasty bug)
The computer is a 33Mhz 386 (AMI Bios, RLL-HD) and we were able to reproduce the whole problem
on a 33Mhz 486 (AMI-BIOS, IDE-HD) 
   If you have an idea, please let us know!

       Thanks in advance

Subject: taylor-uucp and smail
Date: 27 Mar 92 13:17:55 GMT

About  a  week ago  I   reported   that  I  had successfully  compiled
taylor-uucp 1.02 and smail 2.5 under Linux 0.95. I also mentioned that
this combo acutally works for mail delivery. Now, further tests showed
that the problems where overwhelming. When trying to send anything but
a few lines a segmentation  fault occurred. Some stdio-routines in the
newlibc for gcc-1.40  must be broken, because the  Log and Debug files
generated  by taylor-uucp  where totally blurred   and  more or   less
unreadable.

Switching  to gcc-2.0   and the  new libraries   solved most of  these
problems, but a new  one arose:  some of the string  functions in this
library are broken  as  well. So  using the new  compiler and string.o
from newlibc  (NB compiled by gcc-1.40! The  bug  is in the compiler).
Also, taylor-uucp  needs ftruncate.  I got this from  GNU textutils (I
think it was).

I have neither a proper  local binmail, nor a  fancy user interface. I
use minix binmail clone for both these tasks. 

This is an experimental package. It works for me, but I don't think it
is good enough for a binary release. However, I  want to discuss these
matters  with others and therefore  I  will make source code available
for anonymous ftp on host lotka.teorekol.lu.se (130.235.149.50).

There are other problems related to uucp-mail and file transfer. It is
necessare to have good getty and login programs.  Now, I know only one
way to change a serial port from being  outgoing to becoming incoming:
edit the  inittab file and reboot.  I uucico can  do both  itself. But
then the port will be used only for uucp.

   They aren't designed to change your /etc/rc.  What they should do,
   however, is warn you that you may need to change some things.  I did
   this because with the utilities on the root disk, there's no neat way to
   modify the /etc/rc, and if you're like me, your /etc/rc has been
   customized to a fair degree (to mount partitions, set up the hostname,
   etc.)

Do you think we should switch to using an /etc/rc.boot and /etc/rc.local,
like many other Unixes do?  The idea is that /etc/rc *doesn't get edited*
locally, so that it can be simply replaced wholesale during a new OS
installation, and that local customizations occur in /etc/rc.local (usually
/etc/rc.boot is used to set hostnames and domainnames, and is executed
early in /etc/rc, whereas /etc/rc.local is executed late and is used for
most everything else).

This scheme is a little more cluttered, but makes upgrading OS revisions
much less painful.

Subject: Adduser and Sound Blaster device driver
Date: 27 Mar 92 04:15:04 GMT


  I just got Linux 0.95a installed on my HD last week.  It is quite impressive.
  I compiled the adduser program (I forgot where I grabbed the code at the  
  moment.  Maybe mit?). Anyway, it loops back to the group prompt when I 
  answer no to the question "Superuser Priveleges?[y|n]".   Is it possible
  to create a non-superuser account in Linux?  I always assumed it was, but
  now I am not sure.  
        I am currently trying to install a device driver for my Soundblaster
  card.  (I know, there is no real use for such toys in UNIX, but I want it 
  anyway:>).  The source is meant for another version of UNIX that uses the
  Intel 386 chip.  I got it off of nic.funet.fi  . It mentions a program 
  called /etc/insdriver that apparently installs the drivers once they are
  compiled.  Does there exist a program to do this in Linux?  (No hurry on 
  this one, I am still poring over the source code).
        Another question: Are there any alias commands like in UNIX that can
  set up an alias like alias dir "ls -l" ?  how about a "repeat last command"
  command like !!?  Are there any printer command that will utilize a dot-matrix  printer forseen in the future?  
        Congratulations and many many thanks to all of those involved in 
  developing Linux so far.

Yes: the cooked mode has a minor bug, and as I don't use programs which
use cooked mode very often, I didn't notice it. The fix is easy: in
tty_io.c after the PUTCH(127,tty->write_q) (or whatever) in the
^U and Del routines, just add a TTY_WRITE_FLUSH(tty) before the
continue. That should do it.

| On the other side, ^S and ^Q works like a charm and gdb seems to be okay

^Q in fact has the same problem, but this was corrected in a very small
patch from hedrick. Add a TTY_WRITE_FLUSH(tty) after the tty->stopped =
0 in the ^Q code (unless you already have the fix installed).

Have a look at tesla.ee.cornell.edu:/pub/386/bsd/README.  This gives
directions for building a cross compiler for 386bsd on a sparc, as well
as directions for building the assembler, and other binary support

        configure sparc -target i386-bsd

Hello,

To help pinpoint the problems with Linux vt100 emulation, I fetched
the vt100 test program from a comp.sources.unix (vol 7) archive and
fixed it to use termio for linux.

part of the problem appears to be a flaw in cursor positioning, which
I will attempt to correct.  However, others may be more familiar with
the console code than I, so I'm uploading the source to tsx-11
in /incoming as vttest.tar.Z (Is that OK, Ted Ts'o?)

It will be a little while before I find the time to do this, however :-(

I've also got a fully functional port of Jove with i-shells, etc. that
I will post once the vt100 problems are fixed (since it is messy to
use otherwise :-( )

Cheers, :-)

 I would greatly appreciate a bootimage posted with the RAMDISK activated.
With a great deal of floppy juggling, i've been able to compile some
things on my 8Meg ram but, alas, no HD computer. I dont think i've room
to recompile the kernel tho.  While there are probably not many in my
situation, I think such a boot image would be widely appreciated.
  Personally, I'd like a 4 meg ramdisk, but less might be more widely useful.
(tho the 512k"default" in the std Makefile seems too low). 2 megs?

Sorry, the SCSI driver didn't come with Minix (at least it didn't come
with mine).  Da Silva posted his driver to comp.os.minix a long time ago.
Besides, I don't think the original poster was talking about porting
Da Silva's code to Linux;  he was going to use it as a source of inform-

all, why else would Minix release all of their source code?  It's an
educational tool.

Personally, the faster someone writes an Adaptec driver, the faster
I'll be happy.  I'll finally be able to put Linux on my hard drive
and do something with it.

I posted a message yesterday regarding lp support and somehow it didn't get
into the group. Here is a copy of this message.

      Some time ago, I posted a message about not being able to use
     lp.12 with linux 0.95a. This is a correction to that post. lp.12
     patch works with 0.95a also. But the patching has to be done
     manually as some of the files (like tty_io.c) has changed drastically
     between 0.12 and 0.95a. 
     
     Actually there is very little patching work involved and it is quite
     obvious how the patching should be done. So, if my previous message
     had discouraged any one, I suggest him/her to try patching by hand.
     Also you may have to hardwire lp detection in lp_init() is some cases.
     
     Good luck

I tried porting ghostscript 2.3 and it bombed on ps files produced by dvips.
When I tried to contact the creater of ghostscript, I was directed to get
ghostscript 2.4. I will try it today and let the world know what I get out of
it.
