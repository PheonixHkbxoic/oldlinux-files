4 megs of real memory, another 2+ M of swap space if you are interested in
gcc2 rather than gcc1.40.  This swap space can be created either in 
its own partition, or on on any normal file system.

Yes.  Also, with careful manipulation of the partition table and 
boot record of your DOS partition, you can shrink the DOS partition
and create a Linux partition without reformatting and repartitioning
the disk.

>bootup?  Has anyone thought of porting X-Windows to Linux?

yes.  Zorst is working on this.  Linux currently supports shared libraries,
we have enough of a sysV mmap() call implemented to map the SVGA frame 
buffer into user space, the socket emulation library which runs 
on tubes, and Zorts has some IO permissions bitmap stuff that lets
the Xserver go straight at the hardware.  

Add that together, and you can see that X should be here in the near 
future.

It wants libg.a also.  A workaround is to go into /usr/lib,
and do an ar -r libg.a.  This will create a libg.a, albeit
and empty one.

   Yup.  Most of us suckers here in North America can't get mail to you.
   The UK gateway refuses our mail, stating that [we] are not an
   'authorized sender' (or is it 'user' ?)

Since I started this after getting a bounce from mailing Iain (on
investigating, you got an automatic reply saying his account wasn't
authorized) and then jumping to conclusions and posting... I'll
explain.

I have since learned that over the weekend, there was a problem with
some of the relay machines over in the UK. Apparently a disk filled
and so a list of hosts authorized to receive mail from the US, which
gets built nightly, was prematurely truncated. Actually all hosts on
the JAnet over there are authorized to get mail from here; this I
would guess covers most UK posters. The result was this erroneous
bounce. I presume this is now corrected (I haven't gotten a bounce in
the last day or so), so if you have been having trouble mailing
someone there, just try again. I don't think the ~5 hour mail
propagation time to there is going to change soon, though :-(.

In the meantime boyer@sumax.seattleu.edu was collecting US
suggestions; perhaps you guys ought to get together over the newly
working mail link :-). Both postings looked like a good start. 

Enough mailer stuff, now back to our regularly scheduled hacking...

Nachpt.  You could also put it in the disk driver, a la Stacker.  This would
have the advantage of cleanliness, though you'd only get page-by-page
compression.

But... naah.  I think it would actually do best in the buffer cache.
Whenever you load a chunk of data in, you decompress it; whenever you store
it back, you recompress it.

Random access shouldn't be a problem, but from what I know of compression
algorithms writing is.  Most files on a system are only read, anyway, so
this shouldn't be much of a problem.

I've been messing with the vastly improved 0.95a kernel, but I think I
may have stumbled on the tiniest of bugs:

        The vt100 response string doesn't work!

I'm running kermit, connected to my school computer, and it uses
'qterm' to figure out what kind of terminal emulation I'm using.  It
used to work just great, figuring out I was doing vt100.  Now it
refuses to acknowledge the response string.  Is it being sent out
properly?

Okay, I've been looking at this further, and it appears the output
from copy_to_cooked is not being flushed properly.  Using a small test
program that sends ESC-Z to the screen, I've found that Linux doesn't
respond until one of two things happens:  if the test program is run
on the remote computer, a keypress causes the response string to be
sent, and if it's run on my computer (under Linux, obviously), the
string is sent immediately.

The program: (watch out, it's a big one! :)

main() { printf("\033Z"); }

Any ideas?  (Linus?)

nic.funet.fi and tsx-11.mit.edu with the same bad outcome
from both.  On my local unix system, uncompress just kept
running.  I noticed something was wrong when I saw that
rootimage-0.95a was over 30 megs and still growing.
I tried using compress 4.30 for MSDOS, and it said
"file token bad" for the file.  If I am not crazy and
everyone else is having this problem, could the person(s)
who posted the file please repost it to those sites?  thanks!

Are others having this problem?  You will want to be absolutely sure
that you've set yourself up for 'binary' mode transfers when ftp'ing
and anywhere else along the line (with kermit, etc).

You can check to see if the checksum's match with what I got if you
have a 'sum' program available on your machine.  I get the following
output:

25001   624     rootimage-0.95a.Z

This is true for both my copy on my machine and on my school's
machine.  This should be a decent indicator of whether your transfer
went okay or not.

Hello, world,

I have just FTPed the latest version of Linux, 0.95a. The boot image seems
to be OK. 

But I am unable to uncompress the root image. My compress
commmand on DOS simply gives me an error message "file token bad in
root95a.Z". I tried it on a SunOS, with compress command went crazy: I
saw the uncompressed file size growing well over 1,600,000 bytes, and
compress was still running.

Is there a problem with this root image?

I tried the root image both from Finland and MIT. They are the same.

By some evil twist of fate, the rootimage-0.95a.Z uploaded to
nic.funet.fi was corrupted in transit, and as a result, was also
corrupt on tsx-11.mit.edu.  I have uploaded a fresh copy to tsx-11,
and this will be available momentarily (the last five minutes have
been a flurry of email for me :).

I will also be uploading a new copy to nic.funet.fi momentarily, but
I'm not sure when this will become available.  Watch this space for
details....  (For US users, you're better off waiting for tsx-11 to
get it to reduce the transatlantic net.load - especially since the
root image is more than 600k....)

I apologize profusely for the problems this has caused.

You can find out by looking in /usr/include/errno.h and in 
/usr/src/lib/estdio/errlist.h . However this will be a problem if
you can't get you system up and running. (by the way, most programs
report "EACCESS" instead of "error 2", which just depends on how
you compiled the program. 

===== If you have problems getting your system booted, here comes
===== /usr/src/lib/estdio/errlist.h:

(DOS) BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO LINUX v0.95a
======================================
Comments enclosed in double brackets: (( text )) 'are' the
inclusions
by Chuck Boyer and are the 'DOS-beginner's-guide-to-linux.'

          RELEASE NOTES FOR LINUX v0.95
          Linus Torvalds, March 7, 1992

          COPYRIGHT

Linux-0.95 is NOT public domain software, but is copyrighted by me.


The copyright conditions are the same as those imposed by the GNU
copyleft: 
get a copy of the GNU copyleft at any major ftp-site (if it carries
linux, 
it probably carries a lot of GNU software anyway, and they all
contain the 
copyright). 

The copyleft is pretty detailed, but it mostly just means that you
may
freely copy linux for your own use, and redistribute all/parts of
it, as
long as you make source available (not necessarily in the same
distribution, but you make it clear how people can get it for
nothing
more than copying costs).  Any changes you make that you distribute
will
also automatically fall under the GNU copyleft.

NOTE! The linux unistd library-functions (the low-level interface
to
linux: system calls etc) are excempt from the copyright - you may
use
them as you wish, and using those in your binary files won't mean
that
your files are automatically under the GNU copyleft.  This concerns
/only/ the unistd-library and those (few) other library functions
I have
written: most of the rest of the library has it's own copyrights
(or is
public domain).  See the library sources for details of those. 


          INSTALLATION

Installation of Linux is covered in two documents;

INSTALL-0.11
and
LINUX.FAQ
INSTALL-0.11 is the installation documentation that accompanied
version
0.11 of Linux and dealt with installing Linux onto a hard disk,
among
other things. LINUX.FAQ is the linux 'Frequently-Asked-Questions'
documentation file. Grab a copy of these for future reference. Most
of
the material will be beyond your understanding for a little while,
but
once you have installed your Linux copy for yourself you should
have
gained an understanding through the process to understand much of
what
is included in these documentation files.

It is assumed that you have a working knowledge of how to grab a
document,
file, etc. from an archive site through Internet. You use 'ftp' to
call
up and log onto the system, 'binary' to set the mode of transfer,
and
'get filename' to transfer the file from the logged onto system ftp
site to your home directory of the machine you have called out
from.

It is also assumed that you have a basic working knowledge of DOS
and
can get around well enough. (Perhaps you know how to create batch
files
using your favorite editor, or 'copy con' command line statement,
and
how to use the basic DOS utilities; fdisk, copy, erase, etc...). I
am
only trying to create a documentation here for DOS users who are
totally
unknowlegable of Unix system calls, utilities, commands and lastly;
being a System Administrator (which you will be once you have Linux
up
and running on your 386/486 machine).

In a later chapter I will describe the commands and utilities, etc.
that
are available to you. I, too, am a 'beginner' unix system user, so
much
of the explanations found here have been 'donated' in time and
effort
by programmers/concerned users of Linux from the 'alt.os.linux'
newsfeed.
(I have listed their names at the end of this documentation.)

Anyway, back to installation of Linux on your machine. Basically,
you can
run Linux one of two ways; either from your floppy drives only, or
from
your hard disk/drive. If you just want to play around with Linux
and
get the 'look and feel' of using a Unix Operating System (as
opposed to
a DOS operating system) then you might want to choose to just run
it
from the floppy drive. Basically, the logic here would be that, you
don't want to screw up anything on your hard drive (which is loaded
with Windows, word processors, graphics programs, data-base
programs,
etc.), and you have either spent long and hard learning hours to
have
it set up that way, or you had someone else set it up for you and
you
wouldn't have a clue on how to re-set it up yourself. Running Linux
from your floppy disk drive will not screw up your hard drive,
basically.
There 'are' programs on the Linux disks that you will have access
to
that 'can' ruin your hard drive though. (typing 'mkfs /dev/hda' for
instance may render your hard drive unreadable by DOS, but then you
wouldn't know how to do that yet...). Or, you could run Linux from
booting from the floppy drive and thereafter having it run from the
hard disk drive. The differences between these two methods are that
Linux will run a lot (10 times?) slower if you choose to run it
solely
from the floppy disk drive, and you will be limited to the commands
and
utilities that you can run using the floppy drive only situation.
On the other hand, running from the hard disk drive will run Linux
much faster/quicker as well as give you space to have many more
programs
and utilities to run/use, but it also entails you having to learn
to
1) create a Linux partition on your hard disk drive, and 2)
learning
how to maintain this partition with a handfull of sub-directories.
