Actually, I *have* ported GNU Make, but not because of the 'setuid'-
problem. :-) 
I have diffs for gmake-3.62/Linux-0.12. I'll try to upload the
diffs+executable after I have verified them for Linux-0.95a. [Maybe 
Friday, I still have some upgrading to do].

Gmake-3.62 seems to work ok, but there is one know problem: if gmake
forks another 'gmake' [such as when you are makeing a new kernel] and
press ctrl-C, the tty just hangs until you press ctrl-C again. I haven't
figured out yet why.

Also, pmake [Berkeley] makefiles can use things like 
'OBJS+=module1 module2' and use files in /usr/share/mk/*. The libcurses
stuff I have seems to do this. So sometimes you may need to rewrite
an occasional Makefile if you import foreign [BSD] programs.

PS: After I've uploaded gmake, I'm going to take a look at the BSD386
tape-driver and see if it's possible to port it to Linux. (I just happen
to have the right drive [Wangtek]!) Any pointers to info on tape formats and 
interfaces (lots of people have Colorado's, I think) are very much appreciated.
Also is the source for 'mt' in the public domain? Anybody got info on ioctl
calls for tape devices? I would prefer to keep things portable, if possible.

expr should be a shell builtin.  It is a standard in the bourne shell.  You
may have to do a little script editing.

First, an aside...

Now that I have the UltraStor SCSI driver working, I had enough disk space to
try and rebuild GNU Emacs 18.57 and see if I could find out why creating a
shell buffer hung the process.  Surprise!  It works!  I have no idea why the
version on tsx-11 has this problem.  Only strange thing is that it only works
with ash, not bash, as its shell.  All bash processes get immediately
suspended because of "background input".  If I get time, I'll try to figure
out the problem with bash and upload a new version of emacs.

Now, the main message...

Here is an update of a patch I posted back on 25-Feb for version 0.12.  It
appeared in Digest V1N70.

==========

To make using Emacs easier for those of us used to DEC keyboards, here is a
patch to keyboard.S which maps control-space to control-@.  This is far easier
to type and almost second nature to many Emacs users with DEC keyboards.

Line numbers may vary depending on which other patches you & I have applied.
Patch is to version 0.95a.

Subject: 95a HD timeout: what, why? + Beginner's guide (2)
Date: 22 Mar 92 06:54:45 GMT

I finally got round to picking up 0.95a this afternoon and, after playing about
with my partitions I came to install properly. During a full floppy boot (508
and 509 == 0) my HD burst into life with an unhealthy sliding note (shoelace
does the same thing). The error message at the time is HD timeout. What is this
(other than an HD timeout), what is the likely cause, solution, prognosis etc.

Normally this wouldn't worry me but in the course of a a full HD reformat
tonight I discovered some HD damage (nothing major but worrying all the same).

Beginner's guide (2): I have been working on the HD partitioning, installation
and booting bits of the guide and wondered what pfdisk was supposed to do. I
thought it was supposed to partition but as far as i could see it all was
willing to do was write a small program to my partition table. Can anyone
enlighten me (examples good too)?

Thanks,
      Iain

p.s. Sorry if this is little weird.... I'm very tired (long night trying to
persuade my HD that it liked me and wanted to work properly for me :-()

Subject: Idea for elegant TCP/IP in user-mode
Date: 22 Mar 92 14:48:06 GMT

I have an idea for an elegant implementation of TCP/IP (supporting Ethernet
as well as other interfaces) in user-mode on Linux.  See what you think.

The problem with most user-mode TCP/IP implementations (such as KA9Q) is that
they are monolithic in the sense that each application has a copy of the
TCP/IP stack linked in.  Thus, only one TCP/IP application can be run at a
time.  This results in kludges like the PC/IP telnet which includes code for
a terminal emulator and and FTP server!

However, this is a result of poor design rather than inherent limitations on
what can be done with a user-mode implementation.  Consider this:

A TCP/IP process could be created which would open all network devices and
manage routing packets between these and user processes.  User processes
would talk to the TCP/IP process through a connection to a named socket
(named tube in Linux?).

The advantages of this approach are:
        * We don't have to mangle the kernel trying to get it to do networking.
          It can remain clean and simple.
        * It's easier to write code that runs in user-mode because you have
          all the facilities provided by the kernel and user-mode libraries
          at your disposal.
        * Development work on user-mode TCP/IP could proceed completely
          independently of kernel work on Linux.
        * The only thing needed in the kernel would be network device drivers
          which would be responsible only for buffering packets as they were
          received and writing outgoing packets to the device.  It's legal
          to drop packets if you run out of buffer space.  This should
          be easy.
        * A socket emulation library could easily be written that would
          make it look to applications programs like TCP/IP was in the kernel.

I know this can work, because I have something very similar working on a Sun
for a class project.  I took the PC/IP code and ported it to a Sun, using
/dev/nit (the "network interface tap") as my "Ethernet card".  All that would
be needed would be to add some code to demultiplex packets to user processes.

Here's what we need:

        * A network device driver of some kind.  For example, a driver
          for a serial line.  It wouldn't even have to speak slip.
          It would need to be able to support multiple serial lines so we
          can test the routing code in the user-mode TCP/IP.  It would be
          fine if these were separate /dev files.  The only fancy
          thing it would need to do would be to buffer incoming packets until
          the user-mode process could read them.  Eventually we'll need
          an Ethernet device driver.  There are PD packet drivers available
          for every Ethernet card under the sun.  I don't know how portable
          these would be to Linux, though.
        * A light-weight process library.  I think there are PD LWP libraries
          that could probably be ported to Linux with little trouble.  This is
          needed in the user-mode TCP/IP (I use Sun LWP in my Sun version of
          this).  Porting something like this to Linux would probably uncover
          all kinds of bugs, but it would be good for it in long run.
        * Something that works like named sockets, so that application
          processes can open connections to the TCP/IP process.  I don't
          know how close tubes are to providing this functionality.  This
          is the same functionality that is needed for X, though, so I'm
          sure someone is working on it.
        * An emulation library to make all this look like traditional
          network sockets.
        * And, of course, the user-mode TCP/IP implementation.  This shouldn't
          be too hard given all the other stuff, and given something like
          PC/IP and/or KA9Q as a starting point.

With a little time spent on specification, progress could be made in
parallel on all 5 of theses pieces.

Comments?  Does somebody else want to write the specification, or should
I have a go at it?

What files need to be online when you run a program linked with shared
libs ? I was wondering if you could link programs in /bin shared. And in that
case what else need to be in the / mount point ?
I have used gcc2 without any problems yet, compiling gnu-utils amongst others
but I have not tested the programs for correct output and with different flags.
So the only thing I know is that they pass the compiler and can be run. I have
used both static and shared libs.

I agree with Jim Winstead;  almost all of what you propose to provide is
*already* being provided for *free*.  Linux has, through the generousity
and hard work of Linus, and the hard work of many, many others, become
the *nix of those who wish to avoid commercial channels.   I think Jim's
suggestions for service prices are about right.  I don't think, however,
that $15 dollar distributions could sustain your service unless it was
not much more than (or just) a hobby.  I plan to do some ports as soon
as I am able to expand my diskspace and give gcc 2.0 a try (the libs for
1.40 are not quite complete, though very stable);  I will do this for the
joy of it and as my contribution to Linux.  If you do set up a distribtuion/
support service, I hope it's in the same spirit.
