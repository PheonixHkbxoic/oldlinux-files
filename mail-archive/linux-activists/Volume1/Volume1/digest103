Unfortunately, much more documentation comes out in troff format than in TeX.
It is my firm belief that we install both troff (groff?) and TeX into
/usr/{bin,lib} and make each of them an optional package.  If you want TeX, you
load TeX, if you want troff, you load troff.

I disagree.  I don't want anyone to have /etc in their path (perhaps root,
perhaps not) and I really *DO* use mount every once in a while as a regular
user.  I guess you could say that I should use df, but ... NO ...  I think
that mount really is a user binary, and not for use of root alone.

i've got groff & friends up and running in linux. unfamiliar with the
troff system, tho.
  ran  groff -T dvi gtroff.1  and then printed the TeX dvi file on
my laserjet and was pleased to get readable output
  however, the page/line formating is wrong. are the *.1 files meant
to be run thru something else? nroff? how do i get groff to format
them into a nicely readable form?

i was right - the rehashed swapping code had problems. following is the diff
against the original 0.95 code. with this diff applied i was able to compile
the huge c files in the x11 stuff i'm working on. i suspect that with this

Yes. It is good in theory :-)
As usual there are other things that I consider more important
1) Organize the ftp sites such there are different subtrees for different
   releases of linux.
2) Implement the ioctl to change the vga mode ( For X11 )
3) Having a minimal socket library ( for X11 )
4) Modularize the kernel install so you can select which part
   you want.
   ( SCSI driver, Ethernet driver (in the future) and all posible
     rubbish you can think )

Let's create a framework that is good enought to be the same for at least
one year :-) Othervise we have to put a LOT more work to keep trak of what
is goin on !!

BTW: I think that writing the kernel memory is bad in any case.
     One example of thing that is bad in any case is writting a directory
     It can be argued that allowing root to write directly a directory can
     be good thing ( using xvi ).  This is prevented by the kernel, would
     you like to edit a directory "on the fly" too ? :-) :-) <- Smile
     No flames, please. :-)

Find a way of fitting it on a 1.2|1.44 MB floppy and you have a chance.
I think the best way for linux to be distributed is with a boot disk, an
install disk and several files disks.

Joe Average User then sticks in the install disk.  This makes the complete
directory trees, asks about how much JAU wants installed (eg man pages
etc), checks there is enuf disk space, deals with modems, scsi controllers
etc.  It then prompts JAU to plug in the files disks and copies and
decompresses the relevant stuff off.

A model for this would be Ms-Windows install, which has all aspects of this
(eg variable hardware and variable setup, decompress).

Ahh, but did anyone notice the really serious life threating bug in 0.95.
Yup, it is the one in the kernel config file that gives the version as ...
0.12,  I hope this serious error will be fixed in the next release ;-)

-fcombine-regs

something to do with that.

Also, I have noticed that 0.95 is a lot more unstable.  I used to be able
to compile the kernel in one tty, and the libraries in another without
problem.  If I try that now, various processes get segmentation violations,
usually getty's and sh's.

The things I would like to see concerning filesystems are:

- shared libraries asap - got to keep executable size down
- a bsd style filesystem with 4K blocks, and all the ends of files joined
  together to ensure as little 'slack' space as possible
- a compressing filesystem much like stacker or superstore for dos

   this could be implemented fairly easily using the following scheme:

   the files need to be blocked in chunks of 4096 bytes

   thus, each 4K page in a file could be compressed to occupy either 1K, 2K
   3K or 4K.  This should be fairly efficient, and still satisfy the
   ability to do demand paging quickly.  However it is more difficult with
   4K blocks.

Subject: Anybody else want the ftruncate syscall?
Date: 13 Mar 92 13:05:00


In porting various programs to Linux, the system call I find missing most
often, and the one hardest to work around (impossible to mimic correctly)
is ftruncate().  This should be an easy system call to implement.  I
haven't studied the 0.95 sources yet (especially since they're in flux),
but based on the 0.12 sources the code for ftruncate should be minimal and
trivial (the race cases Linus mentions in the comments in truncate() as
being tricky and unsolved in 0.12 may complicate it, I'll have to look at
what he did in 0.95).

You may have noticed that tar -d is a NOP under Linux, for instance.  I'm
certain this is due to no good workaround for ftruncate, so Linus no doubt
chose to simply NOP out the operation (too bad there's no warning of any
sort, but it's not a *real* big deal).

I suspect you'll find the same thing for zoo and zip, and I originally ran
into it while porting lharc.

Is anyone else considering implementing this syscall?  If not, I'll do it
myself when 0.95a comes out, unless someone would like to flame me for
adding a new system call to Linux that they consider unimportant
(everyone's entitled to an opinion :-).
