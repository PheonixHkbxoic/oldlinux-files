(about the 64 MB/partition limit in linux)

   This is a problem based on the fact that right now, we are using the
   Minix filesystem because it is the one for which the structures are
   detailed in ast's OS textbook which of course highlites the minix
   which he wrote.

If I remember it right, the book specified that zone size can be a 
multiple of blocks. Thus, the disk could be addressed in zones of
f.ex. 4 kB each, making a file system with total capacity of 256 MB.
Does this feature work on linux?

Well, I'm one of them.  Although I don't know how to do it, I'll say tar
all the needed files into several small files and each of them is roughly
1.2M (or 720K) so that it fits into a single diskette.  When I have time to
test drive Linus, all I need to do are

1.  ftp
2.  cd /linux/install

        I'm curious as to why there isn't an SCSI driver for Linux.  Excuse
my ignorance--I don't exactly know how to control an SCSI device.  I know
that on my computer, the controller has 16k of ROM that interfaces to BIOS.
I'm curious as to what has to go into writing an SCSI driver for Linux.  I'm
a hacker at heart, but just don't have the rescorces to figure out how to
go about doing it.
        A little more down to earth... who's working on it and when do they
think it'll be done?  I appreciate all the work everybody has done for Linux.
I just wish I could use it!

To populate my Linux, I have to kermit to dos, then tar to floppy, for
which I have pdtar.  I have not been successful in writing a floppy
that Linux tar could read however, and I think that pdtar may be at

Would someone tell me of an alternate tar for msdos that I could try.

   Not if it can be avoided. But what is the real difference between /bin
   and /usr/bin?

Very often in real installations the root file system is very small portion
of the total disk space (for example here it is around 2% of the total).
This is done to minimize the activity in the root file system and thus
the change of corruption in system failure. The catch is that /bin resides
in the root file system and /usr/bin often does not.

I'd propose putting only the minimal binaries to boot the system and do
system maintenance (sh, fsck, backup and restore programs etc.) to be 
put in /bin and putting the rest in /usr/bin (or /usr/local/bin in some 
cases). So we would have support for a separate /usr filesystem available 
to them who want to use it to make their life easier.

In this scheme at least hard links between /bin and /usr/bin are straight
out, of course. I'd also propose putting each binary only to one place to
conserve disk space. It does not really matter in normal use, if some 
executable is in /bin, /usr/bin or /usr/foo/bar/bin. Hey, that's what
the path is for.

No - I doubt it works under minix either, although some of the routines
are there.  It's simply very complicated to change the block-size, and
several things in the linux kernel are hardcoded to 1024 bytes
(demand-loading assumes 4 blocks/page etc etc).  A 4kB block size would
be a good idea though, and I'm thinking (idly) about it every now and
then.

A much easier way to get around the 64MB limit completely is to use
longs for block addresses: the kernel proper already uses unsigned longs
for the block numbers, it's just the fs that cannot handle them.  That
still means a lot of changes, but this /will/ be implemented: it
shouldn't be too difficult to copy the current routines and make them
work under VFS.  Expect it in 0.14 or so (not 0.13 - the VFS routines
are probably still just stubs for it then). 

> doshell /dev/ttyX, X = nonexistant VC reboots. Bug or feature?

Oh, well. Yes, it's a bug. I didn't check all the NULL-pointers that
could happen, and I think the tty_ioctl() happily overwrites some of the
page tables when given a VC that doesn't exist. Instant reboot. Very
practical for those of you that don't have a working ctrl-alt-del, so
maybe I could call it a feature :)

Seriously: it's fixed (I think) in my version - 0.13 will have the
corrections, and in the meantime: avoid using non-existent VC's.

> serial line misses characters on 9600 when doing other things

I've modified the interrupts a bit, and it's probably better now. No
promises.

> init/login on a serial line doesn't echo.

I don't think this is a bug: it's just that the current init/login
doesn't enable echoing etc. On the console this is no problem, as echo
is enabled by default, but on serial lines you have to use stty or
change login.

> pty's don't work correctly with GNU-emacs. Some one-process limit.

Ok.  I'd be grateful for any corrections in the pty-code: currently only
one pty master may be active at once.  I've never actually used the
pty's: I (re-)wrote most of the code, but it was written on the code by
pmacdona and the man-pages he sent me, and I never tested it by running
a program that actually knew what it was doing.

You don't have to send in actual patches: even just telling me exactly
what goes wrong (on a system-call level if possible), I'll be able to
correct it.

> 387 problems

I already replied to the person who posted it, but here's some info for
those interested.

The kernel support (for actual 387's: not the emulation code) is
probably rather complete: it's more a problem with gcc and the library. 
The library-functions that use floating point will have to be recompiled
to work with other 387-code, and in some cases totally rewritten (the
soft-float code for printf etc).  Not the most fun thing in the world:
it would probably be a good idea to wait for gcc2 and then start to
/really/ port the GNU libc.a.  I'll do it if nobody else does.

There are several utilities out there that fit into the master boot

most widely known is BOOTMENU, I believe. I have a beast like that
myself that I could post if need my be. BOOTMENU was posted to

BOOTMENU will display a menu of available partitons on startup and you
can chose any OS to boot with a keystroke. I believe there is even a
timeout mechanism there and the "active" partition will be booted if
the timeout expires.

Wrong.  It's "implementation-defined; the value returned shall be
either a null pointer or a unique pointer".  So either mechanism --
returning NULL or allocating a single byte -- is correct.

Returning NULL will save space and will detect these common bugs, but
will require fixing them.  Allocating storage permits people to still
win with broken software.  I would lean towards keeping it as is.

We've been fighting this battle on our Sun's here and still haven't come
up with any good concrete ideas except *don't touch the stuff that comes
with the system*.  Anything installed should be put in /usr/local and the
standard /usr left alone.  But, with linux, everything is installed because
nothing comes with the system so you wind up with an empty /usr.  :)

Anyway, the /usr/PACKAGE/* idea doesn't work real well because you then
wind up with either huge long paths that no one ever gets set right or
zillions of symbolic links from /usr/local/* to /usr/PACKAGE/* that never
get updated when things change.

If anyone can come up with a good scheme I'd really like to hear it because
it would definitely make my life easier.

This is not strictly true.  I used edpart to split a 200M drive
into three 64M and 1 9M partitions.  Though I don't run DOS in
any of them.  My DOS runs on a separate 200M drive.

What you might be saying is that edpart won't create a DOS partition
larger than 32M.  I'm not sure that even that is true, as I think
it can create a DOS 4.x primary partition greater than 32M.  Although
I've never tried it.  I run DOS 5, and wouldn't trust edpart on my
DOS partitions anyway.

Have you tried creating the 80M partition with DOS fdisk, and then
adding the 20M partition with edpart?  If edpart doesn't mess with
the existing entry created by DOS, this should work.
