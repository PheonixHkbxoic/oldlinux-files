I'm putting in the finishing touches this week: 0.13 should be out next
weekend at the latest (unless some new bug shows up), and I hope to get
it ready by Thursday. I'll definitely call it 0.95, making clear that
version 1.0 isn't that far away.

0.95 will have these features:

- faster floppy (based on cdiffs by entropy (Lawrence Foard), but I
  didn't patch in the formatting code).  Untaring from a floppy is no
  longer a pain.

- VFS-stubs (based on cdiffs by proven (Chris Provenzo), but again my
  version does not contain all of his code, and I added some changes of
  my own too.)

- Better VC handling (works on other cards that EGA/VGA), thanks to
  pmacdona (Peter McDonald).  I think 0.13 finally contains most of the
  VC code things: screen blanking, corrected vt100-codes etc. 

- Swapon system call (swapping from files as well as block devices),
  based on patches by Simmule Turner.  This one needs some additional
  work still.

- poe-IGL-1.2 (or close to it).

- ptrace (by Ross Biro) - not guaranteed, but I think we'll get gdb
  working in 0.95. 

- bugfixes and minor enhancements: file protections, nonblocking IO,
  UK and Danish keyboards, rename etc. 

Most of the patches have been heavily edited by me (indeed, very few of
them are patched in automatically with 'patch'), and not all of the
functionality of all the patches will be there.  I've mostly written in
the patches by hand, so the author of the code will not necessarily even
recognize his own work.  As with the VC patches, some of these patches
will probably evolve for a few releases before they get their final form
(especially VFS which was easily the biggest patch to date). 


Changes that haven't been seen as patches that will be in 0.95:

- many minor corrections (rename corrected, ^S/^Q corrected, better (?)
  buffer-cache handling, some corrected error-returns).

- lockup bugs (two of them) removed: I hope that was the last of them
  (yeah, sure..).

- minor race-conditions with swapping removed (still not 100%, but
  better, and I hope the "block already free'd" error should go away)

- TIOCxWINSZ works now.

- Harddisk changes: the second harddisk will be on minor numbers 64-127
  instead of 5-9 as now.  I also have some code there that hopefully
  gets extended partitions right, but as I haven't been able to test it
  I somehow doubt it works 100% ... The default harddisk names have
  changed: here's a simple listing

        new     minor           old     minor
        
        hda     0               hd0     0
        hda1    1               hd1     1
        hda2    2               hd2     2
        hda3    3               hd3     3
        hda4    4               hd4     4
        hda5    5 (extended)    -       -
        hdaX    X  -- "" --     -       -

        hdb     64              hd5     5
        hdb1    65              hd6     6
        etc

  I'm guessing this will get some people confused, but the old naming
  and numbering conventions were so bad as to be pretty unusable with
  extended partitions.  Fdisk currently doesn't understand extended
  partitions: I'll try to get that corrected too.

Patches available now, but NOT in 0.95:

- printer port patch.  I still haven't gotten around to this one, as I
  haven't got a printer.  So sue me. 

- SCSI driver: didn't make it in time.  I don't expect too many problems
  applying the 0.12-patch to 0.95. 

- mmap patch: not in time, and so specialized I felt there wasn't that
  much of a hurry.  Again, this patch should probably patch into 0.95
  without undue problems. 

So: I hope 0.13 should prove to be more stable, and more easily
extensible, but it will look mostly like 0.12 with a init/login.  No
/major/ new features like in eariler releases: I hope that means linux
is getting more mature rather than stagnating :)

I threw comp.os.coherent back on the newsgroups line as some Coherent people
might be interested in the discussion. :-)

Some sites don't get alt.os.linux, because they don't get alt.

I like bash.  If I had to choose an interactive shell, it would be bash or
ksh.  My feeling is that a UNIX system should have a minimal Bourne shell
equivalent include for the usual mundane task of executing scripts that are
associated with cron tasks, etc.

Yes.  When I get Coherent 386, GCC will be the first thing that I port.

It will be interesting when someone gets a full newsfeed up and running

So do I.  I am trying to patiently wait for Coherent 386.

I have 4 megs now, and I'm giving that a good workout.  I think I'm going
to add another 16 meg.

Subject: tubes for linux
Date: 2 Mar 92 06:52:03 GMT

I noticed the post about the faucet and drain commands and thought I would
post about the recent hacking I've been doing. I just added two new features
to linux (the worlds only real free OS).

I've always been annoyed by the recent trend toward having seperate name
spaces and commands for everything. So I decided to write IPC (tubes) so
that it you could write multiconnection demons using shell scripts.

For example:

tpair /tmp/end1 /tmp/end2
cat /tmp/end1 &
ls -al >/tmp/end2
#shows the output of ls
#the following also works
cat /tmp/end1 &
cat /tmp/end1 &
ls -al >/tmp/end2
ps >/tmp/end2
#unlike named pipes it creates a new connection when ever an open has
#been done on both sides.

I'm planning to do the same for TCP/IP but with a pseudo directory.
tar -cf - * >/dirs/inet/$/32.45.23.34/2000
#send output of tar to port 2000 on machine 32.45.23.34

and on the remote machine
tar -xf - </dirs/inet/2000/$/$
#untar the next connection to local port 2000

One other neat command, you can "pin" a file handle to a file name, the
program opening that file has the file handle given to them.

tar -cf - * | pinin /tmp/here
tar -xf - </tmp/here
or for an even weirder effect
(stty sane cs8 9600;pinout /tmp/here) >/dev/tty65
then
ls -al >/tmp/here
sends the ls out the terminal with sane,cs8 and 9600 set.

Ob hot food discussion:
 One more vote for hackers liking hot food, I frequently need to ask for
extra hot oil on the side after asking for the food extra hot. This usually
gets a rather frightened look from the waiter/waitress. Who says those hot
peppers are just for seasoning munch munch munch :-)

Nice fun to apply patches :-)
Anyway, the usual rule is :
Apply ONE patch at a time. Test the system as much as you can.
SAVE the current status. Go on with another patch....

Got mmap but I haven't added yet. BTW Is Linux going to include mmap
in the next release ?
I have init-1.2 and it seems to work ok..

My patch vas two bits. One was the reboot call and one was the access to
/dev/kmem. They are two distinct things and as I wrote in the article
you should try to understand what's going on while applyng them.

>Finally I've seen in a recent news someone try to mkfs a swap

What you need is to:
1) Create a partition for the swap using any tool you like.
2) Find what is the device of the partition using Linux fdisk
3) Use linux mkswap -c /dev/hdxx Block_num
   where the block_num come from fdisk
4) In the kernel makefile set the right major and minor of the swap
   partition
NOTE: You may have to CREATE (using mknod) the HD devices you need

Considering the price of ram I suggest you buy more ram instead of
Coherent. You can use the ram for DOS too :-)

Well... Yes old UNIX was running on 64k ram. Today you want more...

I still think that 2MB is a fair number considered the price of ram today !
BTW: How much does Coherent cost ?

I'm working on it and have made some progress but it's a slow battle
cuz I'm fighting with curses as well as Pcomm.  (There are some
subtle problems on both sides and I'm new to curses so....)  Further,
I grapped the original release of PCOMM instead of a more recent
version...  the code is that much simpler!  If I get anything going
the even looks half stable I'll be sure to post it!
