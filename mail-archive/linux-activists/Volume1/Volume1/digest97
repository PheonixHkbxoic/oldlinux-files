The problem is that the /mnt directory is missing on the boot image. Try this:

Once you start filling in all the features of BSD/SYSV, Linux will bloat
up to match their size.  The best thing to do may be to decide which
features Linux doesn't need,

Check /dev/hdb*.  The root image (at least the one I got) only comes
with hdb, and hdb1.  I had to make hdb2 (with mknod) in order to mount

   Look for 2.0, at least now, in dec1.eecs.wsu.edu, in /incoming (thanks Ramesh).

Firstly, note that gcc v2.0 is still in alpha testing, so there may be bugs.
Anyone planning to use it really ought to get hold of hlu@eecs.wsu.edu, who is
the person who compiled it.  He also has a FAQ sheet for it.

   It's two files, 2lib and 2misc, and since 2lib compressed is 1.2 meg, I assume
   the only way to get it to linux without (ack) Kermit or something is to
   dd it and then pipe that to uncompress and pipe that to tar xvf???.

Apart from that, there should be a compiled copy of mtools around somewhere,
which will do the trick, or you could compile mtools yourself under 0.12 (the
sources are on tsx-11.mit.edu, at least).  What I do is download on a machine
connected to the net, use a local net to get it onto a PC and then onto floppy
and then use mread to get it onto Linux on my own PC.

Subject: 0.95 problems (x2) + Shoelace question
Date: 10 Mar 92 19:10:55 GMT

3 questions for all you guru's. 2 are 0.95 related questions and the
other is a shoelace question.

1. "Program got fatal signal n" during kernel make

I downloaded all the bits and pieces for linux 0.95 last night, played
about with shoelace for a bit last night (more later) and finally got
round to building a new image (with UK keyboard) this evening. On the
first attempt with pmake all went well until it reached fork.c. I
retried a couple of times, did a full reboot and tried again. The
following is a sample screen.dump result

/***********************************************************/
/tmp/linux: make
(cd kernel; make)
gcc -Wall -O -fstrength-reduce -fomit-frame-pointer   -finline-functions -nostdi
nc -I../include  -c -o fork.o fork.c
Program  got fatal signal 45.
*** Error code 1
 
Stop.
*** Error code 1
 
Stop.
/tmp/linux: setterm -dump > /dev/tty0
 /***********************************************************/

The fatal signal started at 16 and was incremented by 7 or 8 on each
successive attempt. Any idea what's happening here? I installed by
mounting the rootimage within 0.12, copying across all the new bits
and bobs, modifying the bootimage and getting shoelace to work with
it. Any potential problems with this?


2. Microemacs + function keys + 0.95

I use a heavily customised (via .emacsrc) microemacs setup which uses
F1-F10 to trigger some functions. I've been using this under 0.12 with
no problems but 0.95 doesn't seem to like function keys :-( Is this
because linux has changed from vt100 to vt200? I've fiddled around
with /etc/inittab but to no avail. Once again, any ideas?

3. Shoelace

I didn't want to, but finally I was forced to give in and use shoelace
rather than bootany. Yeeeuch! I picked up a copy from src.doc.ic.ac.uk
(nearest archive site) and after some fiddling got it to boot my
harddisk. It does however complain about not being able to find
/dev/fd0, guessing major and minor device numbers and not being able
to find the kernel. It then barfs a bit and runs the bootimage. What
changes to I have to make to make this work cleanly?, where do they
have to go?, etc etc

The main changes I've made so far (in /etc/config) are to change the
boot entry to point to the correct place and change the setdev rootdev
bootdev line to setdev rootdev /dev/hd3

Many thanks,
           Iain

Ignore the error for /dev/fd0. or just link /dev/at0 as /dev/fd0 and this error
should go away.

Hi victims of reset floppy problem:

   If you haven't read the message from Linux, let me repeat it here (so, the
credit goes to Linus).

Recompile kernel (with gcc 1.40 you have add the option
-fcombine-registers to gcc in many makefiles compile without errors) with the
following correction made.
 

1) Goto to directory ~<linux-source>/kernel/blk_drv
2) Edit floppy.c
3) Look for "function bad_floppy-intr(???)"
4) Add a line containing "recalibrate = 1;" before the first if statement. 
   If you prefer add it as the first executable line in this function
5) recompile kernel and try the new one.

If this doesn't work. Please tell Linus (torvalds@cc.helsinki.fi) as he wants
to know. BTW, it worked for me.

Hi,

After I posted a message about pfdisk I got several questions on how 
to boot directly off the harddisk. I don't claim to be a guru on this
subject but I'm willing to share my experience with the rest of you.

Let me start with some disclaimers. I will describe *my* situation,
my configuration and what I did to get it running. There may be other
solutions to do this. And don't blame me if you follow these instructions
and mess up.

My configuration is as follows:
      partition         1             2            3             4
disk 1 (106 Mb)        DOS           OS/2        Linux(/)   SCO-UNIX(active)
disk 2 (106 Mb)  Linux(/oldroot)  Linux(swap)  Linux(/home)   Linux(/usr)

I use pfdisk (just uploaded to funet and tsx-11) and shoelace (the version
from tsx-11). The major drawback of pfdisk is that you can only boot from 
the first HD. So your root-partition *must* be on disk 1.
Shoelace has two problems with it. 
- During booting it displays the message about selecting the video-mode, 
  but it immediately continues and you'll end up in 80x25 mode.
  I remember seeing a solution for this, but couldn't find it anymore
  (besides, I like the standard mode).
- It doesn't do swapping (this should be solved in v0.95).

Step 1.

Get Linux running from floppy (just follow instruction from release notes).

Step 2.

Partition harddisk. Use edpart (MS-DOS) or pfdisk (either MS-DOS or Linux)
for this. For the Linux root-partition 3-4 Mb should be enough (actually, 
1 Mb is currently sufficient, but you better plan ahead).
Mkfs a Linux filesystem on the root-partition and copy the root-files to it
(this is also in the release-notes).

Step 3.

Install a master boot block on disk 1. You can do this with pfdisk. There 
are three different boot-blocks provided with pfdisk. I used bootactv.bin.

Step 4. 

Install shoelace on your Linux root-partition. Skip the part about installing
the master boot block. Just put the following files in /etc: bootlace,
disktab, config, laceup and winiboot. The file shoelace should go to "/".

Step 5.

Create a kernel which knows about your root-device (either patch the 
bootimage (see the release-notes) or recompile it). 

Step 6.

Install the new kernel on the root-partition. I installed it as /vmlinux.
You have to edit /etc/config to tell shoelace where it can find the kernel.
I have the following line in it: 

boot    /vmlinux

Step 7.

Run /etc/laceup to install a boot-sector on your new root-partition.
"/etc/laceup /dev/hd3 wini" (or whatever device you use). 

Step 8.

Reboot. You should see something as:
bootdev: hd0,

if you press a key you'll get a menu and you can choose a partition to
boot from. If you don't press a key it'll automatically boot the first
active partition of your disk (you can make partitions active with pfdisk).

If you choose your Linux root-partition you should see some shoelace 
messages. Finally Linux should come up.

Well, that's it.

Succes,

Ben Lippolt.

Um, BSD and Linux should fill different niches.  If they're both free,
it doesn't make sense to talk about one of them "winning".

BSD should be for people who want a kernel that's huge and has things
like the ISO networking stacks built into it and who can't handle a
limit of 64 processes with 64M address spaces.  If you've got a 486
machine with 16 meg of RAM and 200 meg of hard drive space, BSD is for
you.  Linux should be a lean mean kernel that runs reasonably well on
a 386sx-16 with less than 6 meg of RAM.

Linux should "compete" with Minix; if you want something to compete
with BSD, use the Hurd on top of Mach 3.0.

Do they work with large disks (e.g. ST4766N, ST41200N, ...) too ?

I've heard that the ST01/02 has some limitations which cause problems
when used with certain disks, but I don't know whether they are caused
by the driver software (on MS-DOS) or by the hardware.

Hi,

Since the libc.a is changed, all the programs compiled by the previous
gcc 2.0 for 0.95 have to be relinked with the new libc.a. Fail to do
so, you are on your own.

BTW, gcc 2.0 is still in alpha testing, this will be my last post to

There is an error in the UK keyboard in the file keyboard.S
in linux/kernel/chr_drv.  The faulty line (about line 437)
reads at present

        .ascii "!\"#$%%&*()_+"

The problem is that the second percent sign should be a
caret or up-arrow.  I presume this occurred because the
character got corrupted between here and Finland, not
too surprising, since I think we go through at least one
IBM machine between here and there.  To fix this, you
may replace this line with

        .ascii "!\"#$%"
        .byte 94
        .ascii "&*()_+"

and then, having recompiled the kernel, put in

        .ascii "!\"#$%^&*()_+"

when you can get the character in the editor!

I was involved in the discussion which produced this document,
and I wish to bring up in this forum a topic which I discussed
there.  In doing so, I do not wish to start a flame war, but I
know many people are extremely emotional about this question.
I am bringing up this subject again because I believe we came
to the wrong conclusion.

It seems to me inappropriate that root have / as its login directory.
If it does, than root's profile and various logfiles must be in that
directory.  I am well aware that this is done in this way on many
systems, but I am also aware that it is done otherwise on many other
systems.  It seems to me that the overriding considerations are
that the root directory must be clean, that root's login directory
must not be accidentally inacessible.  But Linux already logs you
