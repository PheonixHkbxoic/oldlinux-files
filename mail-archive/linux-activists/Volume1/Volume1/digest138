I've been around Unix systems for years, and I have yet to see any
really nice system of naming devices.  Fortunately in most cases it
really doesn't matter.  For disks, you put it in /dev/fstab and that's
the end of it.  Backups and fsck's are typically done (at least with
bsd software) using the file system names, e.g. you dump /usr rather
than /dev/sd0c.  Thus I think it's best just to leave things alone,
except when there's some really compelling argument, since names that
keep changing are worse than any choice of names.  I do agree that
it's probably worth changing the serial lines from /dev/tty64+ to
/dev/ttysN.  I like the idea of having a link from /dev/fd to the
floppy device I normally use, but that's something I can do for
myself.

We should probably support a secondary controller and therefore
wd{01234}

It's appropriate, although theoretically one can have multiple host adapters,
etc to get over 7 drivers.

Normally, magnetic tapes are /dev/mt*.  Also there will often be a 
second entry for each mt, nrmt*, which says don't rewind at end of file.

Finally, under "normal" unices all block devices have a second character
device entry for them, the raw device - as in

/dev/rst*
/dev/rwd*

It seems that gcc2 works great, dynamic or static libraries (and the shared
library versions of everything are sooo much smaller).  The included 
half-linked version of tr doesn't work, and uname(1) only returns the 
hostname and operating system name - but I would assume this is 
a result of configuration problems with those programs, not with
gcc2 or shared libraries.

Actually not so :-)  a number of shell functions, including
test, expr, echo, catf, line, . . . are available as builtins
in ash.  One may, however, choose to compile them out.  Including
them as builtins may lead to some funny behavior (expr is not

I think it's clarification time.  There are two different BSDs for the 386.
One is commercial, one isn't.  The commercial one is named BSD386, bsd386,
or bsd/386, depending on who you ask.  The just-released free one is named
386bsd.

BSD386 is in beta test right now, and will feature support for lots of
different disk controllers and drives, will have X11R5 bundled, and so on.
Release 0.0 of 386bsd is in very early testing, and is unable to operate
in much more than single-user mode.  It is unlikely to ever be as polished
as BSD386, and will definitely never have telephone tech support!  :-)

BSD386, when released, will cost $1000 with source code.  386bsd will be
free.

The place for information on both products appears to be comp.unix.bsd.

I'm wondering if anyone has, or knows a way I can obtain or create,

I both some variant of CC as well as an assembler-- (gcc and gas
would be great, but can they be built under Linux to compile for
a VAX?)  As far as libraries go, I can probably just build most
of them from the Linux sources, once I have the compiler/assembler,
or I can get them from a local site here, if the a.out format
is compatable with the BSD format.
Do I need a new version of ld, too, or is it generic enough to work
with any system that uses the same a.out?

For now, setterm can be found in one of the virtual console patchkits
for Linux 0.12.  You'll need to take the color definitions that are
commented out and uncomment them, and delete the color definitions
that were being used instead.

As soon as I get around to it, I'll release the most current source
code for the Linux-specific utilities.  This includes setterm,
doshell, update, mount, umount, fdisk, and a bunch of other little
programs.  I've been working on this off and on since Linux 0.95a was
release, but I've been busy with other work the last couple of days.

Be careful, there's two places ash can be gotten from - the BSD
sources, or the comp.sources.unix archives - the one on the root disk
comes from the former source, with some small changes taken from the
latter.
