[...about brain-dead tape drive manufacturers who won't release

I have a CMS QIC-40 drive and had the same problem.  The manufacturers
all seem to think that their DOS-based backup utilities give them
some sort of advantage, and they don't want competition.  The good
news is that you can get the relevant standards documents for free
just by asking.

Here is an exerpt from the comp.os.minix posting that got me
pointed in the right direction:

|I got the QIC-40 specs *free* from the standards committee.  Write to 
|        Freeman Associates
|        Management Consulting 
|        311 East Carillo St.
|        Santa Barbara, CA 93101
|Ask for QIC-117 Rev A 19 Apr 88 "Common Command Set Interface Spec
|for Flexible Disk Controller Based Mini Data Cartridge Tape Drives"
|and QIC-40 Rev E 18 Sep 87 "Flexible Disk Controller Compatible
|Recording Format for Information Interchange using 1/4-inch Mini Data
|Cartridge Magnetic Tape Drives 40 Megabyte Capacity 20 Tracks,
|10000Bpi, MFM Encoded" and QIC-107 Rev A 5 Jun 86 "Basic Drive
|Interface for Flexible-Disk-Controller Compatible 1/4-inch Mini Data
|Cartridge Tape Drives"

This data is from Oct, 1989, and is probably out of date.  If I remember
correctly, Freeman Associates has an 800 number that you can get by
calling 1-800-555-1212.  I spoke with a nice woman who mailed me
what I needed the next day.  If you want something other than
QIC-40, you might just ask for a list of the available standards
and then use that to determine what you really need.

Whether the QIC documentation will actually help you write a driver
remains to be seen.  I've corresponded with several people over the
years who were interested in creating a Minix QIC-40 driver, but
I haven't seen one yet.  All I've got for the time I spent on it
is some code that doesn't work and fond memories of many hours
spent hacking.  :-(  I'll return to it someday.

Subject: Patches to poe-igl 1.2
Date: 2 Mar 92 15:35:31 GMT


 
I have adopted the following patches to the poe-igl release
1.2 files.
 
Note:
(1)  I have added -s to gcc rather than strip the binaries as part
     of the install target, in case 'make install' is not used.
(2)  I have added getlogin, putenv, setenv, and utmp2 to libc.a, and
     hence not compiled them here.
(3)  I have made 'clean' a dependency of 'Clean' for the sake of
     those of us who use 'egrep clean Makefile'.
(4)  In last.c and who.c I have changed the abbreviated terminal
     name to the expanded one.  This eliminates the irritating use,
     for example, of 'so' as an abbreviation for 'console'.
(5)  I have removed the motd bits from login.c, since this is better
     done in /etc/profile.
(6)  I have made the library routines more ANSI and eliminated
     some inconsistencies in the header files.  Note in particular
     that the definition of getdtablesize in param.h is not
     consistent with the existing definition in stdio.h.

Subject: MGR + Cntl<->Caps + selecting video mode
Date: 3 Mar 92 22:13:57 GMT
Reply-To: B.J.Lippolt@research.ptt.nl

A number of totally unrelated questions:

Has anybody tried to compiled MGR on Linux? I got the sources (with
patches for Minix), but before I'll try it I'd like to know if anybody
already did this. Or would it be better to wait for v0.13/0.95 and GCC-2.0?
Is everything I need for MGR available, or are some things missing?

I would like to exchange the Control and CapsLock keys. How do I do this?

When I boot from floppy I get the chance to choose a video mode. Since I
boot directly from my HD (with pfdisk and shoelace) I just see the menu
flashing by. I doesn't stop and I always end up in the standard 80x25 mode.
What to do about this?

Thanx.

Ben.

Subject: Bug in gcc-1.40 libc (in sscanf)
Date: 3 Mar 92 22:26:30 GMT
Reply-To: B.J.Lippolt@research.ptt.nl

I probably discovered a bug in the libc which came with gcc-1.40.
The following little program illustrates it.

----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

main()
{
  int   id, len, res;
  char  *argp = "100 200";

  res == sscanf(argp,"%i%n", &id, &len);
  printf("res=%i, id=%i, len=%i\n", res, id, len);
}
---- 
It produces the following output:
res=0, id=100, len=200

According to the SunOS manual-page of sscanf it should be:
res=1, id=100, len=3 
(this same program on the Sun actually produces: res=0, id=100, len=3)
This same bug might also be in the scanf and fscanf routines. I took a quick
look at the code of scanf.c, but decided I had to learn more about it than
I aspired to to solve this bug.

BTW. I used the libc-binary from tsx-11.

Ben.

Several people have requested that an interim version of linux
be made available.  I have been working on this for some time,
but the idea of having a tidy distribution with readme files
and full instructions is apparently out of reach due to lack
of time.  I have in any case decided to make my day-to-day
interim versions available in the directory pub/linux/mcc-interim
on the same machine.  It currently contains three subdirectories:
disks, patches, and sources.
 
I do not want to cause a lot of hassle with this, but please
let me know if any changes should be made.  I have not applied
all possible patches, but I have included quite a few, including
swapon, poe-igl, and other updates.

I suggest that the VGA mode selection is taken out from the initialization
code and put into an IOCTL to the device. This is more UNIX style and
should make easier to add different card type.
BTW: Using the IOCTL you are in charge to tell to the system what card you
have, there is no "try to see if thi is...." stage.
Is this reasonable ?
Is this better than the current status ?
( Of course then you start in VGA all the time and adjust as you need when
you have booted )

I think that is a problem of the console emulation.....

Subject: need help with libcurses/probs with printw
Date: Wed, 4 Mar 1992 15:26:58 GMT


I just installed Linux this weekend and, having installed the gcc 1.40,
(don't have the old one), I have tried a simple compile with the old
libcurses I found on tsx-11.  It barfed (of course :-) on the defs
for stdin and stdout, so I rebuilt it with gcc 1.40, and everything 
seemed fine until I reached link time while porting torus (robots..
gotta have *one* game :-)  I got this error:

/usr/lib/libcurses.a (printw.o):undefined symbol _fwopen referenced
from text segment

I went and looked at printw.c and saw this def:

extern FILE *fwopen();

in _sprintw()

To make a long story short, I grabbed libc-0.12 and grepped everything..
no fwopen.  Could someone point me to a fix for this?  Is there a patch?
Is fwopen in some other libsource that I could grab?

thanks in advance,

==========================================================================
Last night I was playing with the lp.12.tar.Z package trying to make it
work, and I seemed to misplace /src/linux/include/checkpoint.h probably
because I didn't backup my source code before patching. :(

I'm not complaining I didn't backup the original source, what bothers me
is when I went to tsx-11.mit.edu to get original source code back on
my machine, checkpoint.h was not to be found.  Forgive me if this 
file was deleted/replaced and I did not catch it on a.o.l or this list.

This leads me to believe that the source code package linux-0.12.tar.Z should
have a README (even though these are far and few between) that states the
date of package creation.   

Does anybody agree?

The "certain things" are the map from the characters the keyboard actually
sends to the actions that you want to perform. (I usually use just a bunch
of (global-set-key)'s). But alas, my favorite trick for finding out what 
keys emacs is getting doesn't quite work.

This bit of elisp is from the Emacs FAQ.

    (defun see-chars ()
      "Displays characters typed, terminated by a 3-second timeout."
      (interactive)
      (let ((chars "")
            (inhibit-quit t))
        (message "Enter characters, terminated by 3-second timeout.")
        (while (not (sit-for 3))
          (setq chars (concat chars (list (read-char)))
                quit-flag nil))         ; quit-flag maybe set by C-g
        (message "Characters entered: %s" (key-description chars))))
  

You type M-x see-chars, bang on a bunch of function keys, and then 
Emacs (is supposed to) tell you what it got. 

BUT ALAS!!!! This bit HANGS my emacs most heinously. It won't respond
to anything; fortunately, it doesn't kill my other virtcons's off.
Boo. So I've been using C-n and C-f, until I can go in and figure out
1) what's hanging Emacs and 2) what characters the f- and arrow-keys
actually send.

If anyone knows why this lisp hangs, PLEASE let us know, and better yet,
tell us how to fix it.

Thanks!
