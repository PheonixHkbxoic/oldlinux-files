>Who is doing TCP/IP?
Looks like I am unless someone tells me they have already started it :)

I just sent this to the mailing list but now that the group is here I'll send
a copy here to:


I'm just about done with some modifications to greatly speed up the floppy
drive. The new version has a floppy cylinder buffer and always reads a
cylinder at a time and satisifies any further requests on that cylinder out of
the buffer. This speeds up reads a lot and seems to make the floppy perform as
well or better than it does under MS-DROSS. I'm still working one one
obnoxious problem that appears to be the fault of Not-So-Intel, if a screen
scroll happens during a floppy read it appears to tie the bus up long enough
(presumably Hercules has lots of wait states) to prevent DMA from happening on
time, causing the drive to constantly reset when you scroll :( At this point I
am just going to try to have it silently retry, but any other ideas would be
appreciated. I'm also going to add a format IOCTL call for the floppy driver
and am considering a set of minor numbers that would automatically format a
floppy. This way you could go through backing up onto a box of blank floppies
without having to format as you go. If all goes well (a big if since it is
Intel) I will upload the new driver sometime this evening.  

I'm considering a similar trick with the HD driver but TCP/IP is probably
more important at the moment.

It looks like I am going to be doing the TCP/IP port after all, the person
who claimed it before decided to do IPC instead. If any one else has started
warn me so we don't duplicate efforts. 

A friend of mine has been working on a self booting floppy that contains 
fdisk and some other needed utilities. This would allow a system to be 
setup from scratch without having to involve MS-MOSS.

I can't wait for X-Windows to work, it will be so much fun playing X-tank in
front of people who think EVENT-QUEUE-CLUDGED-ON-TO-MS-LOSS 3.0 is the
greatest thing since sliced bread ;)

Suggestion:
        Instead of using /dev/tty64 and /dev/tty65 for the serial line
ports, rename them to /dev/ttys1 and /dev/ttys2.  You're much less
likely to get confused that way.

        Linus, I would recommend doing the same thing in the
documentation and in the next root disk image.  /dev/ttys1 and
/dev/ttys2 are much easily understandable than /dev/tty64.

        Also, would someone be interested in setting up support for COM
3 and COM 4?  It shouldn't be that difficult a job, and it would be a
good first project for someone who wants knows a little bit about 80386
assembler and who wants to get their feet wet doing some basic kernel
programming.

   Please forgive me if these have already been covered, but I haven't seen a
FAQ for this groups yet (is there one?).  Before I start downloading Linux
and working through the installation I would  like to know some info about the
following:

1)  How much disk space does a full Linux installation take up?  With all the
    extras and utilities?  How about a minimum install?

2)  How stable is Linux in sharing a disk with DOS?  Does it reside nicely
    on a partitioned disk?  


Any other information/experiences people can share about running both Linux
and Dos would be very helpful.  I free 386 Unix has been a long time coming,
but I'm not ready to give up all my DOS programs to use it...thanks in 
advance.

To firm up my previous offer:  As of February 1st, I will make available
diskettes which contain the Linux distribution and utilities.  The
distribution fee which I will charge is US $5.00/diskette, with shipping
and handling costs of:

$2.50 * (ceil(number of 5" diskettes/5) + ceil(number of 3" diskettes/3)) 
        For addresses within US/Canada

$5.00 * (ceil(number of 5" diskettes/5) + ceil(number of 3" diskettes/3)) 
        For other addresses

Note that the Linux distribution is freely available; I do not plan to
get rich over this.  Once you a Linux distribution (by whatever means),
you are perfectly free to give away copies to whomever you wish.  I am
charging something to cover the costs of the diskettes and floppy
mailers (it doesn't even begin to cover for my time), and to encourage
people who can find some way of getting access of Linux to use them.

If someone with time to burn wants to undercut me and do it for free, or
for a reduced distribution fee, please step up.  If someone else wants
to run this service, I will have more time to do other things.  :-)

Assuming no one else steps up, I will be figuring out how to package the
distribution, and will post something about that in a week or two.
Figure on 2 disks for the boot and root images, and another 2 or 3 for
the binaries of basic utilities: gcc, diff, rcs, etc.  The source code
for the kernel, library, etc. should fit on one diskette.  Sources for
the GNU utilities will vary (and will be big).  The sources to GNU emacs
will take at least 3 disks, for example.

hi.  I don't have ftp either but have found that there are many ftp mail
servers out there that can do the job and send you the files via mail.

The server I use is ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  I send it mail with the ftp
commands in it and it send back a log of the ftp session and the request
files.  Binary files are in uuencode format and split into 60k(+-) junks
so mail can handle them.  You edit the mail, put the pieces back together
and run uudecode to convert back to the original binary file.

It's not as simple as ftp, but it gets the job done.

To find the list of commands valid at an ftpmail server, send a message
with just "help" in the body.  The server will send back instructions
and command list.

Example:     mail ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
             Subject: anything you want
             help

To get a list of files available from tsx-11:/pub/linux send:

        mail ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
        Subject: whatever
        reply <your return mail addr>
        connect tsx-11.mit.edu
        chdir /pub/linux       #only 1 chdir allowed per session
        dir -R
        quit

First you'll get back acknowledgement of your request.  Then after
awhile you get a log of the ftp session, and the output from dir.

To get files in uuencode format send this to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com:

        reply <your return addr>
        connect tsx-11.mit.edu
        binary
        uuencode
        chdir /pub/linux
        get images/bootimage-0.12.Z
        get images/rootimage-0.12.Z
        get docs/INSTALL-0.11
        get docs/RELNOTES-0.11
        get docs/RELNOTES-0.12
        quit

I think I found a problem in the new Linux 0.12.  The kernel
panicked saying "tty_ioctl: dev<0".  Anyway, this is what I did:

  1. Started 10 /bin/sh background jobs
  2. Typed "logout" twice.

...and it happened.  If I'm not mistaken, it should've just killed 
the shells and logged me out.  Apparently it has problems doing that.

I'm the author of rawrite.exe, a program that writes DOS files to
floppies.  The original purpose of rawrite was to write the Minix demo
software on floppies so people could check if their computer was
compatible enough to run Minix.

My mind boggled a little when I saw David's first note.  Pulled out my
archive copy of rawrite.c, compiled it, then went looking for that
string..

It's part of the scanf() library routine.  Borland tried to set it up
so that the floating point library would only be loaded if needed...
and since there aren't any floats in rawrite, the floating conversion
routines aren't loaded, and the string appears when scanf() is asked
to perform such a conversion.

Then I started wondering where scanf() was getting a format requiring
floating point conversion.

Then his second note crossed my tube... :-)
                                   
Bug reports are appreciated.  Some people may wonder why data is read
and written in 3-sector chunks.  I discovered, during testing, that
some BIOS' didn't correctly implement full-track writes to floppy
drives.  Considering DOS-compatible floppies have 9, 15, or 18 sectors
per track, using 3 seemed to be a good idea.

Regards,
Mark

Shoelace has a bug in it. As far as I am aware, it will not be possible
to use shoelace to boot a kernel that does swapping (something to do
with the fact that shoelace overwrites the wrong bytes in the bootsector
when loading. If you want to grab the shoelace sources, I am informed
that it is a fairly easy bug to fix. )

I'm currently in the process of getting linux down to my '386; to try
it out... looks like it's going to be something nice to have...

I have noticed a great amount of brew-ha-ha in the minix group about
the missing init/login, and thought I would offer a suggestion - which
I would implement myself, but I don't think I'll have the time; since it's
going to take a couple of days to get everything downloaded (2400 baud
kermit...)

Anyway, in the comp.os.sysv386 group; not too long ago was a public domain
login - which can replace login under ISC, etc...   Perhaps someone
can just get that and compile it...  (if you're game, and don't have
the source; toss me a note and I'll send it to you, it's only two parts).
Then all we really need is init, which may already be around just
as this login() was.  [By the way, this is apparently a small change
to the login replacement in comp.sources.misc.]

Subject: init/login and questions...
Date: 20 Jan 92 08:36:50 GMT

Greetings,
    Happy!  Since this newsgroup has been created, my mail/day has dropped
from 56 to 22!  *grin*

    In regards to init/login, there was some SERIOUS fur flying when I
tried to install that.  I'm not sure what was the matter, but 1) the
libc.a library's /etc/passwd accessing calls were *TOTALLY* bogus.  (They
returned values that boggled the mind...)  I'm not sure what I ended up
doing, but along the way I found that I had two different library source
collections, and that one wouldn't work at all, and the other would.  *sigh*

    Anyhow, the init.c program (from qpl-init.tar.Z, as I recall) has an
unfortunate bug that the author couldn't have forseen (not having terminals
hung off their serial port, as they said).  In the while loop that loads in
the next terminal definition if and only if that definition is 'on', the
conditional is reversed.

    That's an easy fix.  (It's something like '== ON' and it should be
'!=ON', or something similar.)

    A stranger problem involved 'login' always giving a 'Login incorrect'
message before the login prompt when it started up.  This was fixed by
adding a '-p' inside the getty field in "/etc/ttytab".  (This problem was
compounded by my having had *NO* idea what /etc/ttytab was for when init.c
mentioned it.  I downloaded one off this site, and trimmed it down to two
'terminals'.)

    Now for my main *PROBLEM*.  init now loads login correctly for both
my real terminal and my Modem.  (Useful, trust me.)  The problem is that
input from the serial port is *NOT ECHOED BACK*.  Moreover, it's
evidently not even accepted into login!

    (Actually, if I 'doshell /dev/tty64 /bin/sh &' and a person is attached
to my modem, they are dropped into the shell happily.  Except their input
still doesn't echo!  *argh!*)

    I also have the problem that when my modem answers the phone, I get a
GPI, then things continue fine usually.  (I believe it also happens when
the modem hangs up.)

    I'd like to second the mumble of frustration of the person for whom a
disk error on the disk they are reading from causes the need for a reboot.

    (fsck is bitching at me about problems on my disk, that it evidently
can't fix, and I think it's caused because I wasn't able to sync with the
'floppy reset called' flashing up my screen.  If anyone has a suggestion on
how to fix fsck errors, I'd love to hear them.)

    Even including these clear and simple little beta problems, the
operating system is (to giggle slightly) more valuable to me than the
Coherent operating system that I purchased a while back.  A salute to
Linus for a brilliant job, and the willingness to share it with us all.
