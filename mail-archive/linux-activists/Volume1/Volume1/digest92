I have been trying to collect the sources for various programs
which have been distributed for Linux.  In pub/linux/interim/sources
on hpb.mcc.ac.uk [130.88.200.7] I have placed the file misc.tar.Z
which contains the sources and Makefile for df, swapon, fdisk,

(1)  I should very much like to include other missing sources.
     Among the binaries distributed with Linux, there do not
     seem to be sources for od, passwd, rootdev, sync, and update.
     There are also no sources for Bruce Evans's as86 and ld86.
(2)  More and more bits will be added to this file in time, I
     expect.  Please feel free to contribute suggestions and
     source.  I'll be glad to distribute big source separately.

Subject: Linux 0.95 - booting problems.
Date: 10 Mar 92 01:50:20 GMT

Hi linuxers and Linus:

   I ftped the boot and root image from tsx-11 and got them over to my PC
which currently runs 0.12. Uncompressed each piece and booted the new kernel.
Every thing went fine until I had to insert root floppy. Alas! 0.95 was unable
to read the root fs and called reset floppy about 20 times and paniced not
being able to read device 0208 (I guess major = 2, minor = 8 i.e., /dev/at0) and
hung. One obvious thought was corrupt ftp'ing or kermitting. But, I don't
think so, as the root diskette itself is mountable and usable/readable with
exisiting 0.12 kernel. So I figured the boot diskette is bad.

To fix the second problem, I got the kernel sources compiled with gcc 1.40
and got a version with rootdev=FLOPPY. Booting with this also leads to the
same problem. Any ideas as to what is going on?

Next, I compiled the kernel for hard disk version (/dev/hd2, I didn't care
too much for change of names as the major/minor # are the same). Booted with
it. This time everything went fine until I tried to login as root on
/dev/tty2. Oops! kernel cried twice with general protection error 000.....
etc. But, it did let me login and use the system. So far so good. Now I move
into the linux 0.95 source and do a "make clean". Oops!, kernel really
yells. I got a number of messages with (1) invalid arguement = 0000 (2) fs:
0010 etc. After all that I checked and found that, in fact, make clean has
done its job. I do a make clean again (just to check) and again I get the
same set of messages (the number of times it is repeated may be different).

Can anybody make any sense?

All ftp location sites which are going to carry the root/boot image
files should also carry copies of 'a'/'any' (a standard one?) set 
of DOS environment transfer, editing tools for getting the images 
onto diskettes and setting up the hard-disks. 
 
This will hold down/stop the 'beginner' questions.

     Well, I've been lurking around this newsgroup hoping that oneday I
  could try to install Linux on my 386... so today I read all the hype about
  0.95 and decided that I'd give it a whirl...

     After backing up EVERYTHING in my 105M drive onto FLOPPIES I decided 
  to see if my machine would boot linux from floppy...

     I got 0.12, 0.95 and 0.12-seagate (0.12 with st-0x support)

     I tried all three...

     0.12)  Didn't recognize my drive... Kernal panic: couldn't mount root

     0.95)  Couldn't mount root, wouldn't read the rootimage disk...

     0.12 with seagate)  booted all the way to... harddrives 0 tapes 0
                         kernal panic: could not mount root

       I'm sensing a pattern here...

     I know that my controller probably isn't seagate st-0x compatible (or
  even close)  but I would at least think I could boot linux from floppy?!?!?

       Anyone?  Anyone?

     And does ANYONE out there even HAVE a DTC controller?  let alone have
  the driver for it to use linux???  *sigh*  all day backing this thing up
  and I don't even get a new operating system to play with *sob*

Speaking of ftp sites, are there any which contain a gcc 2.0 which will work
under Linux?  I'd rather not put together 0.95 until I have gcc 2.0 to work
with.

Subject: Linux 0.95 floppy problem (3.5")
Date: 10 Mar 92 05:26:02 GMT

I got the 0.95 boot and root image files from tsx-11 today, but I'm
disappointed to say that I'm unable to boot properly.  I get all the
way through to the "insert root floppy" prompt OK, but after switching
to the root image floppy I get a series of "reset-floppy called"
messages followed by "floppy I/O error".  My A drive is a 3.5" 1.44 MB type.
At first I thought the root image was bad, remembering the reset-floppy
message was returned if a floppy had a bad sector (in 0.12).  I re-ftp'd
and re-rawrite'd the boot and root image floppies and tried again. No Luck.

When I boot 0.12, I can mount and read the 0.95 root image file system just
fine.  One time I got 0.95 to boot from the floppy and all seemed normal,
but when I rebooted (yes after a sync) it failed again, and subsequent 
retries have also failed.  Every time I have the boot failure my CMOS
configuration data gets trashed and I have to reset it before I can
boot linux or dos.  

Just for kicks, I patched the boot image to find root on the hard-drive
and was able to boot OK.  Once I had 0.95 up this way, I tried to mount
and/or fsck a file system on drive A and again got the "reset-floppy 
called" messages followed by "floppy I/O error" and "dev 021c block 1" 
(or block 0) and upon reboot the CMOS configuration was trashed again.
I can read/mount/fsck/mtool files and file systems on my B drive (a 5.25"
1.2 MB type).  It would appear that, at least for me, the 0.95 release 
breaks my 3.5" floppy.

My system is a Gateway 2000 486/33 (Micronics) with 8 MB of memory and a
WD 200 MB IDE hard-drive.  Linux 0.12  ran just fine on my system.

Any suggestions, ideas, fixes, sympathy, encouragement would be greatly
appreciated.  For now I'm still using 0.12 :(.

Thanks in advance,

joe.

Hi,

Please remember gcc 2.0 now at most is just a beta. I think it is just
an alpha. It may change everyday. It MAY NEED 4MB RAM and some swap
space to run. It may run with 2MB RAM and 4+ MB swap space. I won't
guarantee anything about that.

But, I should say it''s much better than 1.40. And you want g++,
it's only thing you get.

===========================FAQ======================
QUESTION: Where is the gcc 2.0?

ANSWER: It's on dec1.eecs.wsu.edu under /incoming. There are two files,
2lib.tar.Z and 2misc.tar.Z.

QUESTION: What are the contents of them?

ANSWER: 2lib.tar.Z contains cc1, cc1plus and cpp. 2misc.tar.Z contains
gcc 2.0 drivers, header files, libraries, manual pages and installation
instructions.

QUESTION: How do I install it?

ANSWER: You may have to have 4 MB ram to run it and have some swap
space (> 2MB) since cc1 and cc1plus are more than 1 MB. First do

        cd /usr
        tar xvofvz xxxx/2misc.tar.Z

Then read FAQ in /usr/gcc2/install. After

        cd /usr
        tar xvofvz xxxx/2lib.tar.Z

run the shell script "inst2.0" and apply the patches. Make sure
/usr/gcc2/bin is in your path.

QUESTION: What are the main differences with the old release?

ANSWER: Here are the features

1. gcc and g++ are in one.

2. ANSI and BSD 4.4 compatible stdio.

3. iostream for g++. It has

* Full implementation of ANSI C stdio.
* Full implementation of the streambuf layer of AT&T's
  iostream library for C++.
* Full compatibility between stdio and streambufs.

and a beta version of libg++.a 2.00.

4. Libc.a are almost new. Most of glibc.a 1.00 (no network) are here.

        a. ctype
        b. grp
        c. locale
        d. posix
        e. pwd
        f. stdlib
        g. string
        h. time

Some other functions are added.

        b. cvt
        b. drand48
        c. getlogin
        d. getpass
        e. mkfifo (is that supported in kernel?)
        f. regex
        g. ufc
        h. utmp stuffs (poeigl-1.2)

These old functions are not changed very much.

        a. soft math
        b. math (some are new)
        c. termcap
        d. unistd

QUESTION: Is stdio ANSI compatible?

ANSWER: Yes, please test it.

QUESTION: Is g++ in 2.0?

ANSWER: Yes. use g++ to compile the C++ code. A beta version of
libg++.a 2.0 is here. Only thing missing is curses since I don't have
it. One test not passed is tFix24.

QUESTION: Why is size of the executable bigger than 1.40?

ANSWER: The stdio in 2.0 is based on iostream. There are some overhead.
When the shared libraries are out, it will go down. The reason for it
is g++ is part of 2.0.

QUESTION: What options can I use for gcc?

ANSWER: Read manual page, gcc.ps or gcc.man. -O3 and -O4 should work
with 2.0. Some said -O3 is the best. Don't ask me why. Try it yourself.

QUESTION: Where is the source code of the new libc.a?

ANSWER: I will release the source code after the alpha test is
finished. Please test it as much as possible.

QUESTION: Can I use gcc 2.0 to compile the kernel?

ANSWER: Yes. The 0.95 kernel is compiled with gcc 2.0. But if you want
to use gcc 1.40 to compile the kernel, you have to add a flag. I don't
remember which one.

QUESTION: Where do I put sprintk.c?

ANSWER: I have no idea. Since I borrowed it from printk.c in
linux/kernel, I just put it together with printk.c in linux/kernel.

QUESTION: How do I to compile the kernel?

ANSWER: To compile the kernel, you have to use the old gcc and
be sure the header files are compatible with the gcc 2.0. At least you
should use <linux/sys.h> and <unistd.d> from gcc 2.0.

QUESTION: Why does g++ complain?

ANSWER: You need "expr". Grab GNU shell utilities 1.6, compile it with
gcc 2.0 yourself. It is a very good testing. Most functions of in ./lib
are in libc.a, check them out. You have to modify the Makefiles, auto
config doesn't work very well. You may have to modify some files in
./src. Xmalloc.c in ./lib has to be modified to take care of
malloc (0).

QUESTION: Why do I always get "out of memory"?

ANSWER: Change all malloc (n) (calloc (), realloc ()) to

        malloc (n ? n : 1)

QUESTION: Why doesn't gcc -s work?

ANSWER: I am working on it.

Look for 2.0, at least now, in dec1.eecs.wsu.edu, in /incoming (thanks Ramesh).

It's two files, 2lib and 2misc, and since 2lib compressed is 1.2 meg, I assume
the only way to get it to linux without (ack) Kermit or something is to
dd it and then pipe that to uncompress and pipe that to tar xvf???.

That was exactly my question two weeks ago. I didn't receive any answers,

OK, I see a few others have been having disk problems with 0.95, but I'll
throw in my experience for what it's worth. 0.95 booted fine, I've installed
it and rebuilt it a few times using the newgcc 1.4. It seems pretty stable,
with the following caveats.

(1) drive problems; both the 'Reset-floppy called' and 'Unexpected HD
    interrupt' messages popped up a few times during a several-hour session.
    I hardly ever got these under 0.12 (with fast floppy patches). The last
    time the floppy problem occurred, I got the continuously scrolling
    version, interruptable only by reboot. The last time the HD problem
    occurred, it was at the beginning of a make, while cc was fetching cpp; it
    obviously made it load an invalid page, since all subsequent invocations
    of cpp gave a SEGV. [It would be nice to be able to somehow invalidate all
    loaded pages when this problem occurs, to force reloading, although
    rebooting obviously solves it.] At least in the case of the HD interrupt,
    other things were going on in other VCs (perhaps causing it to miss an
    interrupt?)

(2) screen problems; again, something I never got under 0.12 (patched with
    virtcons). When scrolling up line by line under uEmacs (`down' key held
    down), the screen contents occasionally get out of sync, and also stripes
    of strange coloured graphics characters appear at random positions.
    Usually, but not always, these problems are transient, and vanish when
    scrolling stops. It does this in the standard 80x25 mode as well as others.
    But it doesn't do it during standard scrolling, e.g. when doing `ls -lR /'.

setup: pretty standard 386SX/16, 100Mb IDE drive, 3.5 HD floppy, C&T VGA, etc.

Any light on these problems would be much appreciated. Could it be something
to do with using gcc 1.4 to rebuild, instead of gcc 2?

0.95 looks very good, with some useful enhancements; I'm really looking
forward to using the gdb/ptrace combo...
