Are sources available for the C library for version 0.95?
For example, it looks like the "mv" command from the rootimage
now handles directories (yeah!), so I assume the "rename" function
in the library has been fixed. There must be other things that have
been fixed since the 0.12 library sources were distributes.

Any chance of making 0.95 libc sources available Linus?

To balance out some of the 0.95 problem reports:
I recompiled the 0.95 kernel using gcc 1.40 and am running 0.12 binaries
on it nicely with no disk problems (386 Everex, 40M IDE drive, 4M mem).

I didn't bother installing init/login/passwd - still running /bin/sh directly.

I like the extra disk buffers -- gcc + cpp + cc1 + as seem to all
fit in memory now, so compilations go faster and quieter!

I trust you're not serious about this.  I was a user of a commercial
port of System V for the AT done by Microport, a company set up by ATT
and Intel to support System V on the Intel architecture.  They spent
years and still couldn't get it right.  Supporting every clone known

0.95 works OK as far as mknodding, mounting, and the shell go, but I can't
get it it work with floppies at all (Floppy reset error n times and then exits
and barfs).  This is a problem since, for some bizarre reason, uemacs
hangs everything solidly (anyone know why?), and I can't get elvis or
something off a floppy, so my system has no editor at the moment.  This is
very, very suboptimal.

WHat do I have to have so that, given a Makefile, I can just type "make" and
away I go rather than compiling everything by hand?

I have a Gateway 2000 386/25 with 2 RLL drives.  Linux .12 seems to work 
just fine.

Any help would be appreciated.

I am considering installing Linux in order to learn the ways of UNIX and 
I would like to hear some suggestions on how to partition 80 megs of hard
disk space.  I have 10 megs of RAM in my machine so how much swap space do
you think I should have?  Also should I divide the remainder into 2 partitions
(one for system files, one for user files), or just one?  I am new to the
workings of *NIX so I haven't a clue on how it's done.  Thanks for any input!

Hi,

I got the boot and root last week (version 0.12) and put them onto disks.
It boots fine once every four or five tries (I think the fault lies in my
drive.)

I can run fdisk and see the partitions, but when I run mkfs, all I get is
the "usage:" message from mkfs, even with the proper command line
(mkfs -c /dev/hd2 92208).

Does this have anything to do with the status or type of the partition?
I've tried everything available to me with EDPART, but the installation
notes keep saying it needs to be an 'active' partition.  Is this for real?
With DOS' FDISK program, I can only make one partition active at a time!

I wouldn't call what they do 'support'.  I almost got suckered into buying a
Microport-marked SysV until I was informed that their 'upgrade' policy consisted
of removing all copies of the software and mailing back the original disks, then
paying 70% of the retail cost of the new version.  An you had to include a
letter saying that you really removed it, so your machine would be down for the
weeks it takes for a two-way UPS shipment.

At any rate, I second the kudos to Linus.  I don't run Linux right now, for
lack of time, but I have in the past (0.11).  Thanks Linus.

PS: No flames if this isn't the true uPort upgrade policy.  But a friend of
mine told me this one day, and he looked pissed enough that I beleived him.

Would it be possible to compile .95 with the gcc 1.40 ?
It is a stable ( isn't it ? ) 'c' compiler and it will allow people
to compile their own kernel. 
This will introduce one less variable ( The new gcc 2.0 ) in the 
system testing....

I have my old .12 fs on /dev/hda4.  Originally I had it as DOS extended partition
which I mashed with edpart.exe.  Now with .95 I would like to mount the same
fs and just copy the files off the floopy root.

When I boot .95 with the root in my 1.2Meg floppy I get 3 Resetting Floppys
then everying works fine until I get a 'can't find utmp'.  I can log
in a root and run the various programs on the root fs.

However, I cannot seem to mount /dev/hda4 /user andas all I
ever get is mount error 2 (except when mtab~ is left around and 
I get a can't open lock file).

I have tried every partition ID imaginable. I have tried it as XENIX, DOS extended, DOS additional, DOS, DOS bootable, etc (everything available
from edpart, part, and nu (4.5).

The strange thing is that 0.12 boots just fine to the same partition
with any of the IDs.  

I don't have to do anything crazy like mkfs just to load .95 do I?
I don't have to mknod anything before I execute the mount?  My entire
startup sequence consists of logging in on a fresh root (just rawrite'ed)
and typing mount /dev/hda4 /user (fdisk reports /dev/hda4 as the variously
unrecognized IDs).

I've come by a secondhand ide drive, and replaced my real second drive,
having the good intention of copying my root partition onto it and
donating it to a friend who doesn't have any spare disk space on his
hard drive.  At first it seemed all well, disk formated ok under DOS,
and I could dd the whole partition without errors under linux. 

But when I came to put a file system on the drive, mkfs -c found 9 bad
blocks (on an IDE drive!?). Then with cp -Rp I got loads of

controller_ready: status = ff

The resultant filesytem after the copy was a complete mess (/etc/utmp was
a directory and that was one of the better points).  Could this just be 
because the disk is old (it came out of a 286 Compaq portable and is a
20M conner, my machine is a 33c 486).  If I up retries variable in the 
controller_ready() of blk_dev.c function is it possible the problems 
will go away??? or is the disk just flaking?

I would really like to leave a plug for Latin-1: the PC character set is
brain-damaged, with no upper-case character for most accented characters,
and several important ones missing (like Norwegian/Danish O WITH SLASH).

I have written a character-set editor for the PC with DOS, mouse and
EGA/VGA and can provide a Latin-1 font as well as an extended 512 character
font for EGA (I could write additional versions like 8x8 for 43/50 lines).

I would very much like Latin-1 seen used in place of the PC charset on any
hardware that supports it (EGA, VGA, HGC+, InColor, XGA...); I guess we
could support it in graphic mode on CGA and HGC as well.

Since my character set editor is currently in "closed beta" (and has been
for a while... sigh... haven't worked on it lately) I don't want to post it
to the net yet, but YOU can use it to improve the Linux project write to me
and I will e-mail you a copy.  If response is overwhelming I might change
my mind and provide a special "net distribution" in this newsgroup.

Date: 12 Mar 92 07:05:20 GMT

I've been able to successfully compile the sh(ell) that comes with
the BSD-reno distribution for Linux, without job control.  It weighs
in at a mere 75k, compared to the 300k monstrosity known as the
Bourne-Again Shell.  (It is also has about infinity less features,
as you might have guessed.  No aliases!  Ack!)

Would people like to see this on the standard root distribution, so
more stuff could be fit on the disk?  Tar and compress have already
lost out in the struggle for space, and I would hate to see much
more forced off the root disk than that.  (In fact, if we switched
to ash, we could probably put tar/compress back on!)

Also, related to this, how does on go about producing an root-disk
image like the distributed one?

I'd like to put in my vote for replacing the rootdev that comes 
with 0.95 with the rdev that was posted just recently.  It's the 
first utility I've seen that correctly handles the new hard drive 
names, and it adds some great utility to a little utility.

Finally, if someone would like to try out ash for me, I can ftp it
to a convenient site.  Keep in mind this would be for beta-testing
purposes, so I won't be uploading it to tsx-11 or nic for a while.

Nice job. I was just complaining about this recenty while upgrading to

Date: 12 Mar 92 12:17:06 GMT

I've just noticed an interesting side-effect of some bug in the 0.95
serial line driver: the driver occasionally flips characters and Kermit
fails to notice that with default settings. Result: files get currupted
during Kermit transfers.

Here's what happens: the serial line driver confuses the order of in-
coming (and possibly of outgoing too) characters. E.g. "#ifndef" be-
comes "#ifdenf" or "return 0;" becomes "retur 0n;". Unfortunately,
Kermit's default checksumming method is to build a 6 bit sum, which
doesn't detect flipped characters.

Remedy: tell the Kermit sender or client to use a 16 bit CRC instead:
set block-check 3
