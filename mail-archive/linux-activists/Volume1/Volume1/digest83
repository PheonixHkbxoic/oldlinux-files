I have installed Linux 0.12 on my Opti 386/25 with 2 meg of RAM. It works
quite well, with the following exception:

  after booting off of floppy,  mkfs /dev/hd2 62000
  That worked (Actually, I used -c)

  mount /dev/hd2 /u0

  That worked. Copied everything over, and shut the unit off (syncing first).

  After that, I changed the boot disk so it would boot off of the hard
  disk (take / as /dev/hd2). That worked. This doesn't:

  mkfs /dev/fd1 1000
    (this works)
  mount /dev/fd1 /u1
  mount: error 2

  fsck /dev/fd1
    (this works)

  NOW.... I boot off of floppy (floppy as /). 
  mount /dev/hd2 /u0
  mount: error 2

  What did I do wrong? I always exited and sync'd the fs. I tried a fresh
 boot and root image, and it won't mount /dev/hd2.
 Apparently, error 2 is ENOENT (file not found?), but fsck, mkfs, mkswap,
  ls, even cat, all know that /dev/hd2 exists. But mount does not.

 Other than that, I am pleased with Linux and all of its utilities.

Just a small point.....
I installed the new ps. I like it ! I have much more informations now ! Good
Just that I had to take away the "optimization" that is double !!
to have it working... ( I had incorrect readings from /dev/kmem )
Is is just me or there is a problem with the following optimization ?

!                       break;

!       p -= *pos;
!       *pos += (int) p;

P.S. The piece of code can be found in /usr/src/linux/fs/char_dev.c under
the routine that handle the /dev/kmem read.
BTW: I think that writing /dev/kmem should not be allowed.

I am a student at Carnegie Mellon Univ. and have run across some mention
of a 386 unix written by someone in MIT , the OS being named linux. 
Hence, my posting on this board.  At CMU we are developing what is known
at MACH (same idea as linux but huge) and I was interested in possibly
running my 386-33 with 8mg ram as a unix box on occation.  Could someone
be so kind as to refer me to some informational messages, FAQ's etc that
deal with the practicality of using linux, whether it uses XWindows, how
much space (HD) it needs, where to find the software, can Dos
applications run under it.  Is it compatible with Qemm and Desqview
(QuarterDeck Office Systems) or does it totally ignore such software in
bootup, etc. etc.

Basically I need some info on this OS.

All help much appreciated.

Yesterday I reported a bug in sscanf in the new libc.
Dan Stromberg mailed me a small problem with the example program I used.
Instead of 
  res == sscanf(argp,"%i%n", &id, &len);
it should be:
  res = sscanf(argp,"%i%n", &id, &len);
This solved the problem with the return value, but the problem with the
incorrect handling of the "%n" still remains.

----
main()
{
  int   id, len, res;
  char  *argp = "100 200";

  res = sscanf(argp,"%i%n", &id, &len);
  printf("res=%i, id=%i, len=%i\n", res, id, len);
}
---- 
It now produces the following output:
res=2, id=100, len=200
                   ^^^wrong!

Thanks Dan,

Ben.

I too would love to have X, but how long is it going to take before we
have a stable version; 2 months, 6 months, a year? So basically I was
asking how difficult it would be to get MGR up and running. If it can be
done quickly without too much trouble it might be nice way to pass the
time until X arrives.
BTW. My question about how long it will take to get X running is a serious one.
Does anybody have any idea how long it might take. I'm even interested in
very rough estimates.

What's /dev/port? 
I normally work on Sun and there is no /dev/port. Still MGR works on Sun.

Obviously you have Pcomm - where did you get it from? The compressed file from
tsx-11 appears to be corrupt - it won't compress either on Linux (hangs) or
our Sun4 (makes a file over 40Mb long)

Back postings of this news group, either one of the archive sites tsx-11.mit.edu

>deal with the practicality of using linux, whether it uses XWindows, how

It's fairly practical - most software runs out of the box.  The patches 
floating around, some of which made it into .95, make it even more so.
Right now, X is not supported.  However, there is a mmap(2) patch (didn't
make .95), and a socket emulation library that does UNIX domain sockets , 
.95 has shared libraries, so we should be able to get X up without 
too many problems, using the stock X386 server.  Some people are working
on it.

  
>much space (HD) it needs, where to find the software, can Dos

I have every utility imagineable, except EMACS, full kernel / library
source, other source, spare kernels, object code from kernel builds,
all in a 32M partition, of which ~14M are free.

Software can be found at either of the above mentioned archive sites in
binary form - most programs will compile "out of the box" - as the 
C compiler (gcc) is ansi compliant, with full headers and 
libraries.

>applications run under it.  Is it compatible with Qemm and Desqview

Linux is a real  operating system.  The kernel boots itself off of floppy using 
BIOS, then kicks into protected mode and ignores BIOS completely.  DOS is 
nowhere in the picture (other than the fact that mtools can read / write
DOS files)

I just grabbed pcomm12.tar.Z from tsx-11.mit.edu in /pub/linux/binaries/usr.bin
and unpacked it on a SPARCstation 2 running SunOS 4.1.2.  It uncompressed and
untarred without any problems.  This file contains binaries, documentation,
and config files only -- no source.  I don't recall where the source file is,
but I can look for it and try unpacking that too.

Linux is getting more SYSV / POSIX compatable.  A memmap(2) call has been
added, as well as UNIX domain socket emulation in the socket library.  This
will allow the use of a virtually unmodified x386 server - the only 
changes being IO read/writes with /dev/port IO in place of the assembler
in / out.

>>>Is everything I need for MGR available, or are some things missing?

/dev/mem will be slower than memmap()ing the frame buffer into your user
space.  

>
>What's /dev/port? 

/dev/port is basically like /dev/mem or /dev/kmem, only it reads/writes from/to
IO space not memory.

I don't know what header file defines it, but if you can't find the
definition, then try putting the following before line 50:

#ifdef __STDC__
#define __P(x) x
#else
#define __P(x)
#endif

The offending lines are attempting to do prototyping if it's supported.

I wouldn't exactly call Coherent inferior, it just has different goals.
Coherent 286 is a good implementation of Version 7, while Linux is coming
up to speed as an implementation of SYSTEM V.  Coherent 386 will be more
of a SYSV os, and will ship with all the tools that it has currently.

Back in 1981 there was a UNIX clone that ran on the 8088 called Coherent.
A guy named Andrew Tannenbaum decided that he wanted to develop a UNIX-like
os for teaching purposes.  The development platform was Coherent.  In 1991
a guy named Linus Torvald decided he was sick of Minix and wrote Linux using
Minix as the development platform.  At some point, someone will decide that
they can write a much better kernel than Linux.  And they will use Linux as
the development platform.

Coherent -> Minix -> Linux -> ?

There has to be a certain amount of sophistication at every level to develop
something that surpasses the previous generation.
