I think you're overplaying this a bit.  It doesn't take much to look
at a few files and decide if they'll fit into 1.2 megs or not.

This also isn't necessarily relevant, because you'd only really need
to do this once - to get mtools over to the hard disk.  After that,
you have the flexibility to use whatever you want.

>Am I missing something, or are we limited to one file to a diskette?  

Right, just one file, unless I've missed something as well.  But
that's also all you need.

>Anyway, you have to format the disks under DOS anyway to use rawrite

Why not use them for Linux?

That may be the way usual MS-DOS programs get transferred, but why
can't it be different for Linux?  I think it's far more useful to give
someone an already-rawritten boot/root disk than to give the
compressed files, and for the same reasons, it would be of more
utility to give them rawritten floppies with the major utilities (like
mtools).

What if they use Linux to do all their calling out?  :)

Right, after they have gone through the motions of rawriting a tarred
floppy and untarring it under Linux *once*, to get the mtools binaries
over.  Is this too much to ask?

I'm not saying that mtools should not even exist for Linux, I'm saying
that is not vital to have it on the root floppy.

Finite number doesn't necessarily equal small number. :)  If you have
the 'generic' mtools set up to handle many different partition types,
you have an mtools that is that much harder to use by a DOS/Unix
novice.  How many people really now if they have 12 or 16-bit FAT
tables?

>What I'm trying to put across is that it makes sense to have more than

I think I could agree here - but if mtools makes it on the 0.95a floppy
(which it might, since someone has volunteered to try and make a
'generic' mtools), and space later becomes cramped (i.e. for 0.96 and
beyond), it will be one of the first to go.  It's nice to have, for
some people, but hardly necessary.

>This is _one_ thing AST had working right in MINIX - he loaded the root

Yes, it is a shame that so much of the boot disk is wasted - it would
be nice to be able to load a number of programs from there.

>>In a perfect world, DOS wouldn't exist.  :)
>
>Not really.  How would you like to be running PRODOS?

Who said the alternative to DOS is ProDOS?  You're even talking about
two entirely different architectures...  (If we're talking about the
same ProDOS - the Apple II OS.)

I should have said - DOS wouldn't exist *anymore*.  It has outlived
it's time, which is why companies like Microsoft are developing
Windows/NT, and IBM is working on OS/2.  DOS was a dead-end from the
beginning.

>>Not really, what happens if they nuke the root partition?  I've come

> Sorry, I must be one of that extreme minority who've never had many

Not necessarily just rm.  It is possible some other program will go
hog-wild and wipe out a partition.  It is also possible to introduce
deadly bugs in the kernel while you're working on it.  Just ask
Linus...

>>[tar as a filesystem]
>
>Wouldn't this be _really_ slow on the average '386?

I don't know, about that - you'd have to ask the GNU Hurd people.  It
may not be all that fast, but it would be useful.

>Phew.  I'm getting _really_ longwinded.

I know the feeling well.

I think we've almost beaten this horse to death...  I don't see mtools
as a utility vital enough to _have_ to be on the root disk, and
nothing you've said really changes that.  I do, however, appreciate
the usefulness of mtools for those of us that haven't dived completely
into Linux yet.  It will be on the root floppy if I get a version that
is generic enough to be of utility to most users, and more
importantly, if it fits.  Beyond that, it's hard to make promises.

Hi,

I am starting to get "read" errors while booting my computer (not the MSDOS
partition) This is new. However I have lately been experimenting with 
DR-DOS, which has had some nasty effects on some non-dos partitions 
(junked).  Now I am looking into trying to lowlevel format the
disk again, since using the AMI bios hard disk utility hasn't had any
effect. (I'm posting to hardware groups since this is soooo close to a
hardware issue.... suppose I had bought a new IDE harddisk which needs 
to be formatted....)
Any help will be appreciated.

That's pretty impressive.  Why the heck is mtools distributed with all
the seperate programs, then?  If it could all be sym-linked, it seems
silly not to do this.  (That means mtools is wasting almost 200k on my
hard disk!  Argh!)

Easier to program, but not necessarily easier to use by a novice.

If you can pull this off, and I can fit it on the root floppy, it will
be there.  In any case, a better mtools would be ideal - the current
one obviously has some holes in it.

I don't think so.  Several people (myself included) have a compiled
Zmodem, but mine is a bit flaky.  I'll try and work on it after 0.95a
is released, but I also have a number of other things to do, first.

They probably won't compete at all. The ABC release will be naturally
much slower to incorporate new features, but will be a comparably stable
base release instead. (How often do you upgrade the OS on your bigger
irons ? Weekly ? :-)

If the ABC release includes good installation tools, I see no reason why
the average user would want to use the root disk for system installation.
Therefore, I don't see a need why the root disk should be tied to LDS.

Reading through my posting again, I notice that I'm making quite a few
assumptions about the ABC release. Are they correct ?

The version of tar I have, which seems to be the current one (there

It backs up the thing pointed to.  Does anybody have a tar that

I've been trying out gdb, from tsx-11.  It's not entirely easy to
install it, as I had to figure out what libg.a is supposed to be,
and I had to remember to use cc1-g from the 1.40 distribution.
But I've got something that mostly works.  However when I try
to step through a call to localtime, I get

This is the version of localtime from the BSD ctime.c, which is

Here's my point:  Why should the 'standard' root disk be a 'harder'
way to install Linux?  That is part of the reason why I took over
maintaining the root disk from Linus:  He is busy working on making
the kernel as stable as possible.  I have the time to make the
distributed root disk as useful as possible.

Why should the 'standard' release be any less stable?  The only reason
things are changing so rapidly now is that Linux is still relatively
new - not even a year old.  (By the way, when is Linux's birthday?)  I
expect that once we reach Linux v1.0, things will be very stable.

Linux is *very* close to a v1.0 release, which is why we're at 0.95a
now, instead of 0.13a.  You'll notice the number of changes between
0.11 and 0.12 were much greater than those between 0.12 and 0.95.

Once we hit v1.0, I would be willing to bet there will be a
significant change in how Linux is distributed, in that there will be
actual beta releases of new kernels before they are distributed for
mass consumption.  At least, this is how I'd like to see it.  Right
now, all of Linux is considered alpha/beta.

I see no reason why the average user shouldn't be given a root disk
that has good installation tools for system installation.  The root
disk should be tied to LDS because it is important to pick a standard
and support it.

>Reading through my posting again, I notice that I'm making quite a few
>assumptions about the ABC release. Are they correct ?

I don't think so, but my assumptions may be just as incorrect.  You
seem to see the ABC release as the 'easy install' release, rather than
providing some organization to how the myriad utilities for Linux are
released, as is how I see it.

Date: 15 Mar 92 18:40:34 GMT

Many thanks to drew@cs.colorado.edu (Drew Eckhardt).  I had looked at
shoelace, and concluded that the installation process was too complex
to bother with.  These instructions made it simple.

However neither the installation file nor your posting gives
instructions on what to do once shoelace is installed.  From trial and
error:

  - When you boot, it will give a prompt.  What it's looking
        for is a single digit, which is the partition number to
        boot from.  Thus you can choose DOS, Linux, etc.
  - If you specify your Linux partition number, you'll see
        lots of junk, and eventually Linux will come up.
  - If you want to boot something other than the default file
        specified in /etc/config, hit a space while the boot is
        happening.  There's no prompt -- you just hit the space
        after typing the partition number, while it's printing
        stuff.  If you do that, instead of Linux coming up,
        you'll end up in a command processor for shoelace.
  - Commands are keywords.  "help" will give a list.  The most
        useful is "load <filename>".  This does what you'd
        expect "boot" to do.  It boots the specified image file.

        Technically, you are not supposed to low-level and IDE drive, it should
come that way from the factory.
        However, I low-leveled my Maxtor drive with a utility I got off of the
Maxtor tech-support BBS.  If you call your drive manufacturer, they will usually
send you or let you dial-up and get the software you need for free... you can't
really pirate a drive, so they'll give you the stuff w/o having to send in a
proof of ownership form or anything.
        Hope this helps.
