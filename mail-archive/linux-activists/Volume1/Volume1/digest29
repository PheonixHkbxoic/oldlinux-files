Any one installing any patchs should make a copy of the current kernel first
(does patch have an unpatch option?). Not all people working on patchs will
have installed all other patchs so conflicts are fairly likely. Has any one
else had problems with the floppy patchs interfering with other patchs? The
only problems I'm aware of with the patchs themselves are that multiple floppy
users might have problems expecially if a timeout happens.

I'm going to start working on porting the kernel socket system calls and
libraries tonight. The code doesn't look to bad but I'm not sure how much
effort is going to be involved making all the supporting stuff work (adding
mbuffs, and other BSD stuff to linux). I'm going to try to keep it as seperate
as possible from the rest of the kernel, so it can be optionally compiled in
or not compiled in to save space.
If any one is working on code that will need sockets (not TCP/IP yet) or named
sockets tell me and I'll give you a copy as soon as it seems to work. Does X
windows always use TCP/IP? On the X windows systems I use there is a file 
/tmp/.X11-unix/X0 which is a named socket, can X work with just this?

Subject: some patches for graphics with et4000.
Date: 30 Jan 92 08:37:28 GMT

i've written a patch to the kernel to allow it to do graphics.
as is, it'll only work with 640x480 with 256 color mode on et4000.
this is because i dont want to bother with the timing for fancier modes.
it'll only work with et4000.  it should be easy to change it to work
with any other vga chip though.

as it is now, if the tty gets a escape g, the virtual console will go
into graphics mode. then a ^]t puts it back into text mode.
the graphics mode has a simple-dumb-thing-terminal-driver-thing that i made.
it takes escape sequences and sets pixels and color palette stuff accordingly.
also, text works, but no fancy vt100 stuff and no cursor.

what i want to know is what the best way to make it do graphics is.
what escape sequence would be the best for puting it in graphics mode?
what kind of terminal would be the best to try to make it emulate?
where could i get a description of the codes used for such a terminal?

also, something i want to improve is to get rid of that switching
of the console between graphics and text mode durring a keyboard
interupt.  when one switches to a vc in graphics mode, from one in 
text mode, it switches the mode of the screen from the keyboard
interupt. i imagine this is not good. any ideas for a simple alternative?

What I've got is high level disk and tape drivers, which talk to a mid 
level scsi driver, which implements things like read and write, with
sensitivity to readonly devices, and handles remapping on errors, which
in turn talks to a low level SCSI driver, the interface to which is       
standardized. 

The top level is like anyother driver.
The lowest level  varies as to how inteligent the SCSI board is - our ST-02's
are incredibly stupid, and you manually manipulate the SCSI bus, where as 
the Adaptec takes a command and sends it out.

I've got the generic high & mid level drivers, and the ST-01/02 lowlevel 
driver.  The time is - SOON.  It's mostly there, but needs some work ....
delays keep popping up, Usenix, classes, design changes
(Mainly generic interrupt driven support and consolodation of st.c / sd.c 
high level code into the mid level driver, preventing sd / st conflicts 
and reducing the total amount of code)
, taking
 time out to install other kernel patches, and extra terminal, etc. 

What the generic drivers let you do is write a SCSI driver for a different
host, and all you need to do is know how to get SCSI commands to the bus
and transfer data across it.  Also, the major / minor numbers are the
same for each host. 

 
That's this weekend's project - with luck, I'll finish it in a couple
of all nighters this weekend, less luck by next weekend, definately by
the .13 release.
 
I'd say definately by the next release of Linux.


I've got mail filed away from people who have finished Adaptec, and I think
DTC low level drivers - 

Other ST-02/ST-02 owners : 

My lowlevel interface has support to auto-detect different host adapters.  
It detects fine for *MY* ST-02. 

 However, Seagate has gone through a 
number of ROM revisions, and the first couple were written by DTC, and 
therefore have a different signature.  Could everyone please look at the
ASCII message at the head of their ROM and mail it to me with the ROM
version?  


DEBUG 
d rom_seg:0000
will get it up.  


 
SCSI owners : 

Should I bother to include support for sector size != 512?

Have you tried a make clean in the linux/kernel/chr_drv, and also 
linux/fs  directories ?  This will force a rebuild of the .o and .a 
files.


If you have RCS runnng on your source tree, did you checkin a PATCHED
version of the files changed before any CO either by you or make?

Oh yes.  It works.  It works VERY well,
When it is working, there is an lp_init message shown at bootup.
I would assume checkpoint.h was a remnant from debugging.

Several things :
Patches should be with respect to the distribution.
Patches should include a note stating how stable it is.  

Developers should use RCS to maintain unpatched versions, etc to make the
cdiffs agains.

Come on, guys.  Give us a break.  If you want people like me to port

I haven't had this much fun with my computer in years!

Pretty cool stuff, Linus, thanks.

Of course, I wouldn't post JUST a thank you (couldn't deal with all
the flames)--I have a question for any of you budding linux experts out
there.

I created a floppy with root = /dev/hd2 and swap = /dev/hd3.  Works
great (although I don't think I've ever *ACTUALLY* swapped anything out,
all the boot messages look good).

However, when I try to boot using shoelace, the routine init_swapping()
in src/linux/mm/swap.c is receiving a bogus value for the global SWAP_DEV.
  
    1. I've verified that the correct values are in the Image at 506 and
       507.
    2. When I hardcode |SWAP_DEV = 0x0303;| in init_swapping() (just before
       using it), things seem to work fine.

Any Ideas?

Well, this isn't a big question any more, now that there /is/ a patch
for mvdir (rename) in the kernel. But just to clarify the interesting
things about mvdir (there are few other commands as susceptible to races
etc - mvdir is indeed special):

>    I'd think this would be the simplest way to implement a
>'mvdir' command...

That is indeed the logical thing to think.  Sadly, it simply won't work
(at least not without special-cases and other hacks): directories under
unix are special in that they also contain a link to the parent
directory. Trying to link a directory using link() will result in the
directory having /two/ parent directories. What then? Do we keep the
link to the original, do we switch links, or do we try to have several
links?

>    Okay, okay, race condition?  What the heck *IS* a race
>condition?

This is a totally unrelated problem, and just goes to show that mvdir
really is hairier than most other unix filesystem calls. If you are
really interested, I'd suggest reading Andrew S Tanenbaum: Operating
system design and implementation. Although I and ast have our
differences of opinion (as everyone who follows c.o.m knows by now), the
book is quite nice.

Races happen when several processes (or an interrupt) try to use the
same resource without enough handshaking to be sure that they don't mess
up each others datastructures: thay aren't too bad, but you have to be
careful when coding to avoid them.  Races can also happen in user code:
the classic example handles signals in C, which is why posix has added
some new kernel primitives (sigblocking etc).  mvdir just happens to be
one of the worst pieces of fs-code when it comes to races: most other
system calls don't do that much work.

Well, I got a better list today (from I-forget-who), maybe it will
finally be better in 0.13.  If this is the biggest problem with linux, I
can be very happy.  It's just cosmetic...

Subject: getting C-Kermit 5A(176) ALPHA to work
Date: 1 Feb 92 03:22:01 GMT

As my first thing to do to learn about Linux I decided to compile the latest
version of kermit that we have on our machines at work, namely version 5A.

I downloaded all of the sources that are needed, typed 'make posix' and
waited to see what happened.

Everything compiled without a hitch (pretty cool!) until it tried to
link it.  Then I got error messages about tcflush, tcsendbreak (I
think), and getlogin not being defined.  The getlogin I just commented
out since it has alternate ways to get the information if getlogin
fails (although getlogin should be added as a stub returning NULL at
the last I think).

The tcflush and tcsendbreak was a little tougher, but not much.  Just
had to patch tcattr.c in the posix lib stuf to make the functions which
are only ioctl's.

Now, the whole thing compiles and links just fine, but when I do a
connect it sits for a few seconds and then gives me a "Communications
terminated" message (or something like that, I'm not where I can try
it right now), and dumps me back to the kermit command line.  The few
seconds while it is in the connect mode you can type stuff and get
responses, but it always dumps me back to the command line.

I did some testing and found out that it is in the main character reading
loop that it is dying, due to ttin timing out and returning a -1.

Anyone have any ideas?  I'm on a 2M, 386sx with AMI SCAT bios.  I have
the vc patches, the fd patches and the emacs patches installed in the
kernel.  I could try booting with the original kernel to see if it works,
but I doubt it is going to make a difference since what I think is causing
the problem hasn't been touched by any of the patches.

Yup. You need the latest copy of shoelace (I think the bug in fix in
it). The bug is that shoelace tries to pass of the root dev to the
kernel, and does so by way of hacking the boot image. Problem is that it
hacks the wrong values, and gets the swap device instead of the root
device. You just need to get a fixed copy, or re-compile it with the
right changes.

Greetings,
    The messages coming up are: "Zone X: in use, counted=0"

    And a comment about a directory which is missing both it's "." and
its ".." directories.  (Moreover, I can't remove said directory.)

    Gcc just started dying on me recently, after a *HARD* crash which
totalled my filesystem.  (Linux didn't get a chance to sync up...)
(This crash occurred when I ^Z'ed out of Emacs, did some work, then
tried to use '%1' to return, forgetting that %1 was an EARLIER emacs
job...  Don't ask me, I only work here!  *gr'yn*)

    Worse yet, there's a constant process (init) which is writing to a
file named 'annoy.log', as part of my debugging, and I didn't realize
at first that this might ('might' hell, WOULD!) interfere with fsck.
I wanted to fix *THAT* as soon as I realized that it was a problem.
(Like when fsck -a dumped a million or so messages about it on my
screen.)  The problem there is that my compiler (gcc) barfed,
assumedly because something appeared in the middle of the executable
file...  Wheee!

    As of right now, I'm *HOPING* that all I'll need to do is pull the
gccbin stuff back, but it's coming up with a few hundred of these
"Zone X: in use, counted=0" errors, and that's worrying me a *LOT*.

    fsck -a didn't do ANYTHING for the Zone messages.  I managed to
dealwith all of the "Zone X: not in use, counted=1" errors by removing
files that I guessed were causing problems.

    In general, my filesystem seems to be okay, but *SOMETHING* is
fucked somewhere.  I can't recover the directory that has been
trashed, and I'm not sure what files have lost sectors...

    By the way, if you pipe the output of the 'fsck' program to a file
it decides that it *HATES* that file...  *grin*

    So, is it likely that I should be able to backup the entire
system, re-mkfs, and restore and have most of the stuff work?

Well, the make for linux is some older version of GNU make (not /that/
old: 3.60, I just checked), so I know it's possible to compile it...  I
think nlist is only used for load average calculation, and linux doesn't
support that anyway, so add a -DNO_LDAV (or something like that) to the
Makefile.  I think this is also the reason make seems to be wanting to
be installed as suid root or something. 

Sorry for being vague - I've had to delete some of my sources to get
other things to fit, and the sources to make was one of the things that
went overboard.
