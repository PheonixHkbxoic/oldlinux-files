You mean I've been lucky running LINUX on my DTK-PEM2500 with NO MAJOR PROBLEMS,
386-DX running at 25MHz (IO bus at 10MHz)????  It's news to me.  Perhaps you
can be a little more specific about your problems (CPU type, CPU speed,
IO bus speed, whether or not problems go away when not in TURBO mode,
whether or not you are using peripherals not designed for a 10MHz IO
bus, ... etc, etc, etc.).

Is this certain? Someone suggested in an earlier post or two that
Linux was 'exactly' compatible with Minix (what version of Minix

I built ispell some time ago, and didn't run into this problem at all
- it compiled just about perfectly out of the box, from what I
remember.  I think there's something in the README or INSTALL notes
about building some of the things without the 'standard' UNIX spell.
(Such as there is one pre-generated file in the package, but it isn't
used by default - sort of how yacc/bison and flex stuff sometimes is
provided for those without the necessary programs.)

If you still have problems, drop me a line and tell me what the
Makefile is trying to generate (the dictionary, I assume) and I can
package up the dictionary I have.

I looked at the pathnames with "tar tf /dev/xxx" and do a "cd" so the file

You need to run a terminal emulator (like kermit) in the vc.  You then need
to have kermit do a "set line /dev/ttysx" to own the serial line.  On the other
side, you need to have a getty running on serial port being connected to.
Note, it you try and connect the two serial ports together that are running
the gettys, then you will end up with the 2 gettys trying to talk to each other.
Not very useful.  Now the kermit user can go into the terminal emulator, and if
you did things right, he should be talking to a getty which is asking him
to login.

How are you fixed for disk space?  Can you setup a swap partition or
put a swap file in your file system somewhere?  I turn my swap partition
on with a "swapon /dev/hdxx" in my /etc/rc file.  Turned 4 MB into 9 MB.

I get my sources from tsx-11.mit.edu, though I will admit to not knowing
if Z-modem is there or not.

It should, swap space (whether a partition or a disk file) should look
to you like virtual memory.  It may not be as fast when you have to use it,
but you can do more before you run out of "memory".

Sorry.  Unix programming is new to me too.  That's why I'm playing

I have KA9Q running between home and my office via a modem connection.
Here's how I did it.  In my office I have an 286 PC with 640K memory
running DOS 3.3, and KA9Q for DOS.  It also has an ethernet card.
the DOS KA9Q is set up to route packets from the ethernet to the modem
via SL/IP.  My machine at home and the machine in my office are on a subnet
by themselves.  AT home under either DOS or LINUX, I have similar AUTOEXEC.NET
files that configure my home PC.  First from home, I call the modem in my office
(usually with kermit since the KA9Q for LINUX doesn't support TIP yet).  Once the
two modems are connected, I bring up KA9Q at home.  Since both KA9Qs are talking
SL/IP over the modem, I AM CONNECTED.  As long as the name service and routers
at work know about the SL/IP routing, I AM LIVE ON THE INTERNET.  I can then
TELNET, FTP, PING, etc to my heart's content while I am running KA9Q.

I can't wait for when SL/IP support is in the LINUX kernal, and all I have to do
is make the modem connection for ANY LINUX user to be able to use the SL/IP
connections.

I'm currently live at 2400 BAUD.  Both KA9Qs support SL/IP, cSL/IP, and PPP.
I will admit to not trying out the latter two yet (It involves remembering
to change both configurations correctly at a penalty of being unconnected
for 24 hours if I get it wrong).  I tried just changing one side from SL/IP
to cSL/IP.  It didn't work.  I know that when cSL/IP is installed on a UNIX
box it will make connections with either SL/IP or cSL/IP.  Whoever put the
support in KA9Q must have cut a corner for cSL/IP.

One of these days, I'll get around to using a faster modem/protocol and see what
happens.

I installed gcc 1.4 from newgcc.tar and newlib.tar soon after they
were put on tsx-11.  I then built df.c from it.  No problems.

And seeing as I couldn't use the previous gcc, I was quite amazed.
Of course following the instruction from various people probably
helped a lot since I tried installing the old gcc with no help
at all.  Read the documentation that come with newgcc.  It helped me!

Date: 26 Mar 92 23:38:25 GMT

I have been having problems with tar in version 0.95a, it usually happens
with large compressed tar files (the gcc2 files for example)...I use the
command:
        tar xvofvz 2misc.tar.Z
and tar just hangs doesn't extract any files sometimes it will show the
first directory in the file but not with the gcc2 files...I can always
press ^C to cancel so it is not actually locking up...most of the time
I can go ahead and uncompress the tar.Z file and then untar the tar file
but that did not work with the new gcc2 files (3/25/92)...what I did was
boot up version 0.12 untar the files with no problems and then boot version
0.95a and run the inst2.0 script...but now I can't compile anything
even something like:
        gcc -o man man.c
hangs...again I can press ^C to cancel...I had been using the 3/15/92 version
of gcc2 with no problems until today...

I would appreciate any help on either of these problems...

There are indeed.  As one of the instigators of the binutils patch I
have a few comments.  Don't expect to just drop in the changes and
expect gld to magically produce correct a.out files for linux.  When
I was making the changes I was thinking only of 386bsd (or whatever
it's called these days).  For which purpose it works great (IMHO).  If
anyone wants some hints on how it may be possible to make this produce
code for linux, drop me a line.

I just checked it and the version on nic.funet is indeed corrupt. 
I tried to uncompress and untar the file and it crashed at a small
binary file. So I suppose I indeed forgot to set binary mode when I
uploaded the file to nic.funet. Sorry for that. The copy on tsx-11
(pub/linux/sources/sbin/pfdisk.tar.Z) is correct. Maybe the one on
nic.funet can be replaced with the correct one?

(1)  pfdisk does not do what I want: it requires me to know the
     number of heads and cylinders on my hard disk.  I have written
     a small patch to get this information from the kernel.

(2)  My pfdisk now does most of the required handling of extended

     extra-for-experts features, and with verification and
     warning messages.

This is a bug.  I am using 0.95a + the published patches from Linus.
The cd works, but if you type pwd when you are there, the command
fails.  I suspect error checking in bash, which is older than the
current library release.  This bug does not exist in the same version
of bash on other machines.  It is also possible that some error code
is not being interpreted properly.

Because the gcc 2.0 is in alpha testing, there have been quite a
number of releases.  Shared libraries did not work in one of these,
which I believe is the one now on nic.funet.fi.  Get the latest
version of the compiler from dec1.eecs.wsu.edu (/incoming/2*).

sort comes from GNU textutils.  A slightly outdated version
(as of March 16) can be found in textutils-1.2.tar.Z in /pub/linux/mcc-bin
on hpb.mcc.ac.uk [130.88.200.7], which is accessible by anonymous ftp.
This contains binaries and patches.  I call it slightly outdated
because GNU have released textutils-1.3 on March 16.  This is
being worked on.

With respect to the files on this machine, several people have
made good suggestions about their organisation, which will be
implemented as soon as time permits.

Some British Linuxists have asked whether this machine can be
accessed by coloured book file transfer (NIFTP).  I have not been
able to answer all of them, in one case because my mailer refuses
to accept his address.  Such software does exist on that machine,
but it will stop working when we upgrade its operating system.  It
is poorly written and does not support anonymous ftp in a secure
fashion.  While it is still there, I am willing to set up temporary
user names for specific people on a short term basis, but I cannot
open the machine up for general access using this software.

I have tried to get an info-server working, but have not yet found
one which works on HP-UX.
