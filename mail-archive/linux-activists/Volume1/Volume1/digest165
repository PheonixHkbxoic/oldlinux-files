Could someone tell me where I might find the binary or sources for
date, bash, and who?  Yes, I've looked on tsx-11.

Also, I noticed that whenever I use ^C to kill an incomplete 
command line, the shell properly gives me a new line and a
prompt, but it forgets to kill the old command line.  Maybe
I'll just port tcsh...

Depends. When I got pfdisk and compiled it with gcc-1.40 I discovered
a bug in the sscanf library-routine (in "newlibc"). I did a very crude
hack to get around this bug. The only problem with this hack is that 
you have to type exactly *one* space between the numbers. I put this
hacked version of pfdisk.c as pfdisk.c-bjl in the kit which I uploaded
to tsx-11 and nic.funet. I explained in the README file what I did.
I don't know which gcc version was used to compile pfdisk and which 
version of pfdisk.c was used. I haven't tried it with gcc-2.0 yet. 
To summarise: grab the sources of pfdisk (the one on nic.funet seems to 
be corrupt), check your version of gcc and recompile.

I'm not sure I understand this. I uploaded pfdisk.tar.Z to tsx-11 and
to nic.funet. I'm sure it was the same file I sent to both servers. 
It is true that the original files came from a DOS system (with ^Ms
after each line) but I cleaned them up and it worked on my system. The
only difference between nic.funet and tsx-11 could be that tsx-11 has
binary mode as the standard mode for ftp. It was the first time I ever
uploaded something, and I might have forgotten to set binary mode when
I uploaded to nic.funet. Unfortunately our InterNet link is down so I
can't check this.

It's not a problem.  Only one request at a time will be passed to the 
device driver.  It's taken care of farther up than the device driver.

With disks : No, it won't be a problem.

With serial ports, etc : output isn't a problem, except that there 
is no definite order inwhich the output will be mixed, input -

I (boyer@sumax.seattleu.edu) am about (in one week) release the 
'completed' version of the '(DOS) BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO LINUX/unix'!!

PLEASE!!!: read it, as it will represent Linux 0.95a. 

Old users (programmers, comfortable, seasoned unix users);
 please read it for any syntactic problems. This guide is meant to
 answer 99% of the 'new-users (especially from DOS)' silly, idiotic,
 questions which will clutter up the net, while more important
 programming/compiling, bug questions/posts/discussions are going on...
 So, your corrections, suggestions, concerns will be used.

New users (DOS users who are trying Linux/unix for the first time ever);
 please read and try out a few examples from the manual. Mail me where
 you find problems understanding my explanations, where something is
 confusing. This will help the next 'new' user out a lot, as I will
 implement your suggestions in the final release.

The final release will be April 4th.!!! So, suggestions made after
April 1st will not be addressed/included into the Guide. I will then
take a rest, do other things, and will not change/update the Guide
Until June at least (perhaps that will be Linux release 1.2? Whatever).

Especially Linus, any responses?

=============
Already mailed requests/responses that I will implement;

1) There will be appendices for
        a. ls -l listings (which will also be 'crc' checking listings
                for anybody.
        b. error code listing moved to appendix b.
        c. special problems that need further explanations, appendix c.

2) the loose usage of root, /, and /root will be clarified.

thanks,
chuck

Subject: No more kernel messages flying off the screen - pause patches
Date: 27 Mar 92 04:54:35 GMT


When doing heavy kernel hacking and debugging, sometimes the DEBUG messages
implemented with printk()'s would fly off the screen so fast, it would 
make you dizzy =8^)

I have fixed this misfeature with the pause patches.  What these 
do is ensure that you have atleast X seconds (configurable) to read 
each printk() message.  If the last printk is going to scroll off the 
screen, and X seconds have not elapsed, it goes into a kernel pause,
where interrupts are serviced but everything else is sstopped.


The keyboard lights move from left to right when this happens,
so you know what has happened.

The patches are in the file pause.tar.Z at the usual places 
(arl, and tytso - it is in incoming of tsx-11 and nic.funet)
and on my machine headrest.colorado.edu under pub/linux/src

What else needs to be done - these patches work with the configuration
system I am currently using.


--- IMPORTANT ---
You also need a config.dist.h, and config.site.h.  You can grab the 
config.dist.h from the SCSI patches, or just touch(1) it.  
touch config.site.h.  

Note that keyboard.S and config.h are patched against the originals - 
if you have installed the SCSI patches, you'll have to either 
patch by hand, or patch the original distribution files.

Subject: bootsector.S @X patch
Date: 27 Mar 92 05:02:59 GMT

I had originally patched the bootsector to muck with the FD 
controller parameters, as some systems would not do whole
track reads on anything but lowdensity disks.

When I did this, I put in the now infamous code that does the 
error dumps

@X:xxxx
AX:xxxx
BX:

etc.

for my own debugging purposes, and left it there as I decided that 
it was a Good Thing (tm) - it's real easy to look at a dump, 
and say "Hey, you wrote it to a low density disk, and that's 
why it doesn't work" 

That @X isn't supposed to be printed, and is the result of a one line    
omission in the bootsect.s patches (I had originally been assembling 
with A86, as I could then use a symbolic debugger on the boot code.
I translated from the original source to MASM syntax with a small 
perl script, but patched the original sources by hand once it was
working - and left off one instruction).  The following patch corrects this :

Please don't.  If memory serves, the Minix software is copyright Prentice-

incoprorated in it that isn't (or can't be) covered by the GNU copyright.

Subject: Sound Blaster for Unix: Version 2 released
Date: Fri, 27 Mar 92 05:36:46 GMT

I've just posted the second release of a suite of Unix drivers
and applications for the IBM PC Sound Blaster card.  It will
also do synth stuff on the Adlib.

The full driver is a classic Unix character device driver.
It should port over easily to the two 386 BSD implementations;
I haven't looked Linux drivers so I don't know what you're in for.

I use it on AT&T V.3; it is loadable on ESIX.  SCO is unknown.  
It hangs the kernel on startup under on ISC 3.0; I don't know why.

Here's the README:


                         Sound Blaster(tm) Driver
                       (Copyright 1991, Brian Smith)

        Rewritten for Release 2 by Lance Norskog, March 1992

This is a driver and application suite for the Creative Labs'
original monophonic Sound Blaster card.  It should work on
other cards that claim to be SB-compatible, like the SB Pro,
MediaVision, etc.  (The Adlib synth chips are supported, but
you may have to comment out the SB DSP chip support if you
want to run the Adlib or Game Board cards.)

Version 1 of the driver & applications was written by Brian Smith 
(brians@rigel.cs.pdx.edu).  Pace Willisson (pace@blitz.com) rewrote
the driver for overall cleanliness and to use in-kernel buffering
to avoid the gottverdammter clicking problem. Independently, I
rewrote the assembler interrupt to attack this issue, and have
since merged my ugly hacks into Pace's very clean rewrite.
There's nothing new in the application suite except a program
to play a .INS file as a tone, just as a previewer.  

REQUIREMENTS

This driver and the associated user programs require a 386/486 system
running System V 3.2 Unix.  It has been tested on ISC Unix versions
2.0.2 through 2.2.1.  I believe it will work correctly on Esix, Intel,
and AT&T Unix.  SCO is a mystery to me (as well as many others).  I do
not believe it will work in SysV 4.0 and above, but the modifications
should be fairly minimal.  Remember, though, THERE IS NO WARRANTY.
As a character driver, it should port easily to Linux and the various
BSD 386 ports going on.  There is a Streams driver that presently
only does MIDI; this should port to V.4 easily.  It should also be
easy to port the sampling and FM synthesis parts of the driver
into the Streams version, but nobody's done it yet.

GENERAL INFORMATION

This driver is for the Sound Blaster sound card designed by Creative
Labs, Incorporated.  The Sound Blaster is a sound card for the
IBM-PC(tm) type I/O bus.  The card is capable of sampling sound from a
microphone jack from 4KHz to 23KHz (or 24KHz, depending upon which
portion of the manual you believe) at 8 raw bits of resolution.  It is
also capable of playing samples at speeds from 4KHz up to 12KHz.  The
board can play raw 8 bit samples, or 2 bit, 2.6 bit, or 4 bit ADPCM
packed samples.  ADCPM is a lossy method of data compression.  The
sampling and output may be directly driven by the CPU, or it may be
driven by DMA.  The card is also capable of playing music through an
on-board FM synthesizer chip.  The chip may play 9 simultaneous
instruments, or it can play 6 simultaneous voices with 5 additional
rhythm instruments.  In addition, the board (but NOT my driver) also
supports the addition of 2 C/MS chips. For more information, read the
advertising blurb, errr...  manual which comes with the Sound Blaster.

The driver is capable of utilizing only a subset of the capabilities
of the Sound Blaster card.  The driver is accessed through four
device nodes.

The /dev/sbdsp node accesses the DSP chip which controls sampling and
sample playback.  Only 8-bit sound is supported thus far.  The driver
utilizes DMA, and therefore is very unobtrusive to the system load.
The ls utility is harder upon the system.  Read(2) and write(2) upon
/dev/sbdsp sample sound and play back sound samples, respectively.
Several ioctl(2)'s control sampling/playback speed, resets, etc... 
The play_snd utility demonstrates the use of the /dev/sbdsp node.

The /dev/sbfm node accesses the FM chips.  The only access to the FM
chips are through ioctl(2)'s.  The play_cmf utility demonstrates the
use of the FM chips by (mostly) interpreting and playing CMF files.
The various options controlling the voices can be dumped from a CMF
file by the get_instruments utility.  Those familiar with synthesizers
can then learn how to create their own instruments.  

The /dev/sbcms node accesses absolutely nothing.  The C/MS chips are 
really awful, and Creative Labs is trying to forget it ever used them.

The /dev/sbmidi node does MIDI I/O if you have a MIDI dongle box
attached to the joystick port.  The driver reads & writes a longword
per MIDI byte, with the other 3 bytes giving a Unix time code.
There are no programs for this; read the driver.  The mfplay
program does not compile by itself.  It needs an old version
of TJ Thompson's 'midifile' library; it should be rewritten
for the recent 'mf2t' version of that library.

This driver is merely the rough outlines of what it could be.  Support
could be added for oodles of features, like efficiency improvements, and
ADCPM interpretion for the /dev/sbdsp node.  If you wish to add to this
driver, please be my guest (after reading the license file).  

The file sb.prog.doc gives the complete info on programming the
SB and SB Pro.  If you have an SB Pro and want to hear it do
stereo, you'll have to modify this software.  Please send in
your changes.

With Brian's consent, I have taken over as maintainer of this suite.
Please!  Send your fixes to me, and I'll integrate them, test them,
and send the patches to Usenet.  That way, there won't be billions 
of versions of this driver to contend with.

Send money to Brian Smith, if you want.
