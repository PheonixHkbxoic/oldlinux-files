Will this gcc2.1 run on Linux straight out of the box, or does it need some
tweaking?

I haven't got Linux running yet so I can't comment on kernel latency
but I know that 115200 is possible in DOS with 8250s. The $25network
and Laplink run reliably at that speed and I've transferred a 40M
disk using Laplink.

Try compiling with the unpatched swap.c, this should work too.

If this doesn't help try removing the lines that do the stack check

Maybe you are still using the ps compiled for Linux 0.95, you have to
recompile ps for version 0.95a. And don't forget to run 'ps -U'.

Has anyone had trouble using uncompress (off of .12 distribution) with
files off of tsx-11.mit.edu?  At first I got an out of memory error, so
I got swap up and running (have 4megs of swapping).  I can now use gcc 
on larger files, however, when trying to uncompress a 26k file (fgrep.tar.Z)
it dies with:
out of memory
out of swap space
segmentation fault

I then compressed bash (300k) and then successfully uncompressed it using
the same.  What gives?

PC UNIX SIG                                     Wednesday, April 1, 7pm


                        Linux vs. 386BSD
                        ----------------

The age of free Unix for 386 machines has arrived, and the biggest
question is which one to pick!  A rewrite of Unix called Linux started
the excitement a few months ago, and the March meeting of SVNet made
bigger news by making a bootable 386 version of Berkeley Unix available.
Both are pre-releases that people around the world are helping debug.

Frank Schulz, our recently converted Minix expert, has been working with
both Linux and 386BSD, and will give an overview of the 2 systems.  He
will explain the differences between them and help you decide which one
is better for your environment.  He will also talk about gcc 2.0, the
GNU C compiler, which is part of both systems.

We are hoping to see some of the other people in the area who are
working on these systems, especially those brave enough to use the 0.0
release of 386BSD.

BYO Party

Bring your own computer or formatted disks.  Frank will have the latest
Linux version and John Sokol, who is helping Bill Jolitz, will have the
latest 386BSD version.


General Meeting Information:

        Date:   Wednesday, April 1, 7:00pm to 9:00pm -- no fooling!

        Place:  Cupertino Library               (Still looking for a
                10400 Torre Ave.                 place to call home.)

                Take 280 to the Cupertino exit South; turn left on
                Stevens Creek; turn right on Torre; the library is
                past the city hall on the left.

Upcoming meetings:

The PC UNIX SIG is a group that meets monthly to learn about UNIX and
discuss the popular UNIX versions for the IBM PC family.  The format is
technical discussions or product presentations.  We also have a club
computer with Usenet access.

The meetings are free and open to the public, but members are encouraged
to join the parent group, Silicon Valley Computer Society, an IBM PC

I had this problem too.  I found that after the dialing screen has left, and
the status line re-appears, that if you enter an "T", which will put you in the
though mode, that then you can get echo from the romote terminal and your modem.
Hope that helps...

If you are using the latest devices, the com ports are /dev/ttys0 for
com1, /dev/ttys1 for com2, /dev/ttys3, and /dev/ttys4.  Their major
number is 4, and their minor numbers are 64-67 respectively.

The file /etc/passwd is described in /usr/include/pwd.h, which
is included by programs getting information from that file.
(Actually a system may get some of this information from elsewhere.)

    1.  User name (maximum eight characters on many systems).
    2.  Encrypted password, usually 13 characters.  No entry allows
        login without password, and '*' prevents login even with password.
    3.  User id number.
    4.  Group id number.
    5.  'Gecos'.  This field is conventionally used to hold personal
        information about the user: name, office, phone number.
        I don't believe this is actually defined by any standards.
    6.  The home directory, sometimes restricted in length, e.g.,
        to 64 characters.
    7.  The login shell, or program executed at login, also often
        restricted in length.  On my systems I have a user sync
        whose login 'shell' is /bin/sync, so you see a true shell
        is unnecessary.  Sometimes, to prevent login, the shell
        /bin/false is used.

The file /etc/group is described in /usr/include/grp.h, although,
as in the previous case, the information need not be actually
obtained from the file.

    1.  Group name (maximum eight characters on many systems).
    2.  Encrypted group password, almost never used.
    3.  Group id number.
    4.  Group member list, containing the names of users allowed
        to execute newgrp to that group, separated by commas.

Hope this is of interest.

Several people seem to have received the impression that it is
necessary to reformat a floppy every time you use rawrite;
perhaps the documentation is misleading.  Under normal circumstances,
rawrite works on any disk which has been formatted once.  The
documentation probably intended to warn users of new floppies
that they can't be rawritten(!) out of the box.

I see you've never installed a commercial *NIX package.  I've installed
several - they all provide for user-partitioning, error recovery, etc.
Linux could do the same thing.  It's not that damned hard to write a self-

guys can do it.

I've got a solution to the "what do we name the tty" wars - name your own!!

That's what "mv", "mknod", and "ln {-s}" are for.  If you don't like the names
of the tty/serial/hd devices, you can ALWAYS change them/link them to something
that you DO like.
