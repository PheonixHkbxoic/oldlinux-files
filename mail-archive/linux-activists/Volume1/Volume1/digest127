Dear fellow Linuxers,

Does any one know where I can get 'ps' and 'df' utilities? I noticed there
seems to be a 'df.c' file in Linux distribution, but I don't seen 'ps'. Or is
there some other utility resemble ps' functionality in the standard
distribution?


Thanks in advance, and thanks again for people who helped me on 'as' 'ld'

What terminal type does KA9Q/LINUX support through TELNET connections.
I have not had any luck trying to use VT100 as a terminal type.
Should I be using the same TERMCAP entry on the remote side as is
available locally in LINUX, even though LINUX doesn't use it B^)?

I am very enthused about linux, and I am especially interested in 
the ability to use SCSI.  I have a Future Domain 1650 Controller.
Has anyone had any experience - or know of any available sources - 
to anything that talks to this controller.  I am hoping I can build upon 
the work done for the Seagate Controller - but FD gives you no docs
or sample code.  They will sell you thier dev kit for big $$$$'s though.


Any pointers or info would be much appreciated.

If you'd waited about ten minutes more, the problem would have been
corrected... :)  In any case, the 0.95a root disk, not corrupted, is
available on tsx-11.mit.edu now.  I'm not sure if the one on

That's something I hadn't considered when I did the 8x8 font - oops.
If someone can send a simple way to tell whether a EGA or VGA card is
in use, it's a trivial change.  (For now, change the line that says
'return 80x50' to 'mov al, #0x502b', which will tell the kernel you're
using 80x43.  Make sure to create a con80x43 termcap entry!)

>2a) I want to add my EGA extended text modes to the setup.c code.

If the EGA extended modes are handled through int 10, it would be
simple to add the detection routine as if it were a SVGA card.  If it
involves selecting different fonts, scan lines, etc, it gets a bit
trickier.  (I might look at this eventually for different VGA modes,
but not yet....)

When you modify termcap to handle con80x43, you should be able to copy
con80x50 and just change any reference to '50' to a '43'.  There's
about four or five things you need to change.

Make sure the serial devices have read/write permissions set for
everyone.  (That'd mean chmod /dev/ttys*.)

Good point, and one I hadn't thought of.  I'll make the change for the
next root disk.  (Just in case everyone isn't confused enough already!)

The current naming scheme could handle 26 drives and 15 partitions per
drive.  Y can be hexidecimal, much as the pty numbers are. (16 if we
made them zero-based....)

I run Linux with two IDE drives (a Conner and a Seagate, with a
Seagate controller).  It works fine for me, but I'm not mixing drive
types.

Something to keep in mind if you are a non-hacker, or won't have enough
disk space to build the Xserver.  

The stock X386 driver supports Tseng and

I agree wholeheartedly with this. My feeling is that Linux should appear
as "standard as possible", with normal names for disks, serial
ports, etc.  On most Unix machines, disks are numbered in the form

/dev/{r,}{h,s}d followed by a disk number and then a partition number.

Normally, I've seen disks numbered numerically, partitions with letters,
and it's pretty safe to assume partition c is the whole disk, a root,
g usr, etc.

Technically, with SCSI it is possible.  There are SCSI controllers that
hang off of a SCSI bus, and make 7 SCSI drives appear as LUN 0-6 of
their ID.  You can have 7 of these on one SCSI bus - so that's 
49 drives!

Note that ESDI / MFM / RLL / IDE normally all appear to the system
as a WD1003 compatable conroller. This means that they occupy the same
address. You can set one up as a secondary. but right now Linux does
not support this.  Hard disk driver hack, anyone?

This will probably be the way to go, but Right Now (tm), the only 
fully supported adapter is the Seagate. However, Dave Gentzel 
is in the testing stages with his lowlevel Ultrastor driver, David Darknell
with the lowlevel CSC driver, Tommy Thorn is working on an adaptec, 
Michael Johnson on a DTC driver, other people on Future Domain and 
Always IN-2000. 

SCSI also coexists with MFM / RLL / IDE / ESDI with no problems.
As far as SCSI now, your choice are to wait, or if you have a good 
deal on a SCSI disk pick one up and use it with a Seagate ($20)
until you get a "real" SCSI host.

Since the Linux SCSI drivers do not go through BIOS, or any brain-dead
mapping schemes to get the disks to fit within the geometries
allowed by BIOS / DOS, and instead uses that native SCSI as a block
device, you will be able to unplug one host adapter, plug in a different
one, hook the same disk up to it, and use it without reformatting or 
anything.

With SCSI and unmodified sources (other than the SCSI patches), only 
SCSI will coexist with any of the others. Otherwise, you'll have to 
hack the HD driver to support a primary / secondary controller.

>    So basically, what is my best choice for LINUX from the four above?

If you want to use your current disk too, I'd say SCSI - but you probably 
want to wait for something other than the Seagate (slow, but very cheap), 
or Ultrastor / CSC (fast, but not so cheap) drivers.  

If you don't care about your current disk, or don't mind hacking
in support for primary / secondary controllers, I'd say whatever
is cheapest.

That's the whole point of my three-tiered SCSI driver package.  Adding 
support for new devices, such as SCSI tape or SCSI printers, and 
adding support for different SCSI hosts is trivial.  The midlevel
driver handles all of the timeouts for you, retring error conditions
and classifying them as "Fatal, Could retry, Ignore, and media error,
you should remap", etc.  The high level drivers handle their devices
(ie SCSI disk)  for ANY lowlevel driver, and share a lot of common code 
in the mid level driver.  

Also, the way it's set up, the drivers are 100% self configuring, so
that one distribution kernel can be used for all supported SCSI hosts,
as well as "normal" IDE / MFM / RLL / ESDI systems.

To implement the lowlevel driver, including comments and DEBUG code,
you're looking at  300-500 lines of code.  Conversely, the rest of 
the package is over 2000 lines of C and header files, plus Makefile and
clean diffs against .95.  

>or sample code.  They will sell you thier dev kit for big $$$$'s though.
>

Right now, Ken Corey - <kenc@sol.acs.unt.edu> is working on a Future Domain
low level driver, unfortunately last I heard he's on a floppy / SCSI only 
system and running gcc off of floppy disks (it is possible - 
I've made file system images available from headrest.colorado.edu with
a mostly compiled kernel, where all that remains is linking in the
SCSI code modified for your system.  This is .12, gcc-1.39).  

You might talk to him and see if he's found out anything. 

Also, if you brown-nose the right people, you might be able to get 
a free developer's package out of it. Explain the situation, how 
a group of netters led by Linus are developing a free 386 Unix,
how the generic SCSI drivers fit into the picture, supported and 
soon to be supported SCSI hardware, etc.  Most companies want their
hardware to be supported, many are very helpful to students, and
are willing to help out.

>Any pointers or info would be much appreciated.

To other SCSI developers out there :

I have set up the "linux-scsi" anonymous FTP site and mailing list.

headrest.colorado.edu will carry the latest version of the SCSI
        code, bootable kernels, and general SCSI information that
        will be of use to developers.  Disk space is sparse and 
        I don't have time to maintain full archives of all
        Linux stuff, so SCSI and related materials are all that
        will be found there.
