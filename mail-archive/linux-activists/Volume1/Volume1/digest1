   LINUX 0.12 is a freely distributable UNIX clone.  It implements a
subset of System V and POSIX functionality.  LINUX has been written
from scratch, and therefore does not contain any AT&T or MINIX
code--not in the kernel, the compiler, the utilities, or the libraries.
For this reason it can be made available with the complete source code
via anonymous FTP.  LINUX runs only on 386/486 AT-bus machines; porting
to non-Intel architectures is likely to be difficult, as the kernel
makes extensive use of 386 memory management and task primitives.

Alt.os.linux is a newsgroup for discussing the development of Linux.
The Linux-Activists@joker.cs.hut.fi mailing list currently contains over
400 recipients, and it is melting down from overload.  Thus, the
creation of alt.os.linux is the result of an emergency situation.  The
expectation is that comp.os.linux will be proposed as a new newsgroup,
and when it is created, alt.os.linux will become obsoleted by the new
group.

Like comp.lang.perl, there will be a news <-> mail digest gateway
installed for people on the old mailing who cannot receive Usenet.  It
is expected, however, that the vast majority of the 400+ members of
Linux activists will be reading things via this newsgroup.

Has anyone managed to us a z-modem with linux connected by modem to
a unix host?  Currently I use Kermit and it's just too slow.  It
would be nice to have a faster download.  If you have been able to
use sz and rz or any other fast protocol, please let me know how
you did it.  Thanks.

Does Linux use Mach as it's kernel? I don't know how hard it would
be, but I would think it would save steps and lead to higher
compatibility in the long run.

I believe that in the discussion about MGR, "/dev/screen" was
mentioned as something that had not yet been added to linux.  Could
someone who knows kindly elaborate on /dev/screen?  Character?
Graphics?  In what format is it accessed?

Is there any way to get a preexisting boot disk that will allow enough of
a Linux format that I can then get the rest of the stuff on my disk without
having to read and write raw blocks myself?  I fear I'm not quite studly
enough to do disk I/O without a filesystem.

First, does ANYONE already have 'make' for Linux?  I'm trying to compile
it right now.

Next:

I have figured out how to boot up Linux from both the hard disk and the 
floppy.  I have a 18969 line uuencoded compressed SHAR file that I could
post (in 19 files).  

Should I post it?

I THINK that all you have to do is to:

  1. Boot up from the floppy.
  2. Create your hard disk partition and mount it.
  3. Copy the floppy to the hard disk.
  4. Run the ChangeBoot program listed in INSTALL-0.10


BUT!!!  I haven't tried this as I only have one disk and its working fine
thank you (I've been working on this since last night (Friday) and just
got it working an hour or so ago.

I used SHOELACE to boot up stuff, and now I can boot up on 1 floppy that is
also a root file system. Same thing for the hard disk.

Please let me know if you want it.  I might also be able to make it
available via ANON FTP if that would be better..

Get a copy of the rawrite.exe program to do it for you.  It's
very simple.  You give it a filename and a device, and it
will put the file on the device.  Source, doc, and exe are
on tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/INSTALL/rawrite.* among other
places.

make is part of the standard release.  In versions 0.10 and 0.11 it
was in the file utilbin.tar.Z.  In version 0.12 utilbin.tar.Z has
been replaced by fileutil.tar.Z and utils.tar.Z.  You'll find make
in utils.tar.Z.  In addition you may want to grap the text utilities
in test-1.1.bin.tar.Z.  Other utilities have been ported separately.

I believe all these are on the normal linux distribution systems
mentioned in the INFO sheet that was just posted.

With the various kernel changes going on, I'd be tempted to keep
separate boot and root disks.  But that's just a personal opinion.

>BUT!!!  I haven't tried this as I only have one disk and its working fine
Posting of untested or alpha versions are likely to cause problems.

LINUX INFORMATION SHEET
(last updated 13 Jan 1992)

1. WHAT IS LINUX 0.12
    LINUX 0.12 is a freely distributable UNIX clone.  It implements a
subset of System V and POSIX functionality.  LINUX has been written
from scratch, and therefore does not contain any AT&T or MINIX
code--not in the kernel, the compiler, the utilities, or the libraries.
For this reason it can be made available with the complete source code
via anonymous FTP.  LINUX runs only on 386/486 AT-bus machines; porting
to non-Intel architectures is likely to be difficult, as the kernel
makes extensive use of 386 memory management and task primitives.

     Version 0.12 is still a beta release, but it already provides much
of the functionality of a System V.3 kernel.  For example, various
users have been able to port programs such as bison/flex without having
to modify code at all.  Another indication of its maturity is that
it is now possible to do LINUX kernel development using LINUX itself 
and freely-available programming tools.

2. LINUX features
  - System call compatible with a subset of System V and POSIX
  - Full multiprogramming (multiple programs can run at once)
  - Memory paging with copy-on-write
  - Demand loading of executables
  - Page sharing of executables
  - Virtual memory: swapping to disk when out of RAM
  - POSIX job control
  - virtual consoles on EGA/VGA screens
  - pty's
  - some 387-emulation
  - ANSI compliant C compiler (gcc)
  - A complete set of compiler writing tools
    (bison as yacc-replacement, flex as lex replacement)
  - The GNU 'Bourne again' shell (bash)
  - Micro emacs
  - most utilities you need for development
    (cat, cp, kermit, ls, make, etc.)
  - Over 200 library procedures (atoi, fork, malloc, read, stdio, etc.)
  - Currently 4 national keyboards: Finnish/US/German/French
  - Full source code (in C) for the OS is freely distributable
  - Full source code of the tools can be gotten from many anonymous ftp sites
    (Almost the entire suite of GNU programs has been ported to Linux.)
  - Runs in protected mode on 386 and above
  - Support for extended memory up to 16M on 386 and above
  - RS-232 serial line support with terminal emulation, kermit, zmodem, etc.
  - Supports the real time clock


3. HARDWARE REQUIRED
   - A 386 or 486 machine with an AT-bus.  (EISA will probably work, also,
     but you will need an AT-bus hard disk controller.)
     Both DX and SX processors will work.
   - A hard disk implementing the standard AT hard disk interface--
     for example, an IDE drive.  SCSI drives are not supported yet.
   - A high-density disk drive--either 5.25" (1.2MB) or 3.5" (1.44MB).
   - At least 2 megabytes of RAM.  (LINUX will boot in 2 Mb.  To use
     gcc 4 MB is a good idea.)
   - Any video card of the following: Hercules,CGA,EGA,VGA

In addition, LINUX supports
   - Up to two serial lines
   - A real time clock 

4. PARTIAL LIST OF UTILITIES INCLUDED IN OR AVAILABLE FOR LINUX 0.12 
   - The MTOOLS package (reading/writing to DOS filesystems)
   - The complete GNU filetools (ls, cat, cp, mv, ...)
   - The GNU C compiler with GNU assembler, linker, ar, ...
   - bison
   - flex
   - rcs
   - pmake (BSD 4.3 Reno/BSD 4.4  make)
   - kermit
   - Micro emacs
   - less
   - mkfs
   - fsck
   - mount/umount


5. LINUX BINARIES
    The LINUX binaries and sources are available at three
    anonymous FTP sites. These are:

    nic.funet.fi:/pub/OS/Linux
    tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux
    tupac-amaru.informatik.rwth-aachen.de:/pub/msdos/replace


6. LEGAL STATUS OF LINUX
     Although LINUX is  supplied with the  complete source  code, it is
copyrighted software.  Unlike MINIX, however, it is available for free,
provided  you obey  to the  rules specified  in  the  LINUX  copyright.


7. NEWS ABOUT LINUX
     Since LINUX's  introduction to the public there has been a rapidly
growing mailing list, "linux-activists@niksula.hut.fi". To subscribe to 
this  list,  mail to  "linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi".  If the
traffic in this lists increases  further, there are  plans to swap ( at 
least partially ) over  to comp.os.misc, so  watch out  for  any  LINUX 
articles in  this group.  For the current status of LINUX, do "finger
torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi".


8. FUTURE PLANS
     Work is underway on LINUX version 1.0, which will close some of the
gaps in the present implementation.  Various people are currently working
on:
     - A virtual filesystem layer 
     - STREAMS 
     - init/getty/login
     - Interprocess communication
     - IEEE POSIX P1003.1 / P1003.2 compatibility
     - SCSI support

Hi:

  I would like to know whether Tex/Latex/mf is ported to linux. Does Linux
support/permit bitmapped graphics on vga/svga cards. This question is
important to me as I am interested in knowing whether it is possible to port
dvi previewers / picture drawing facility to Linux. 

Please bear with me if these questions are inappropriate to the current state
of Linux (which I know is 0.12 & beta)

In a quick scan through of the code, I noticed that there is no ptrace
system call. How are people currently debugging code? Is someone working
on implementing ptrace, or will a different (aka Mach-style) exception
handling mechanism be implemented?

Hi
I have been on the search for a easy to use *nix for 386/486 PCs (personally
I believe a 386/486 is wasted on DOS!). All the same in order to increase 
user acceptance many such clones run dos applications also. 
Does linux do it too?
No flames please!

No, Tex/LaTex has not been ported to Linux yet.  It should be fairly
easy to compile the Tex/LaTeX formatters themselves; the rub (as you
yourself pointed out) is doing the previewer.  

No, there are no interfaces for doing graphics operations on Linux
(yet).  There are several people who are interested in porting X11 to
Linux, which will solve all sorts of problems, but there are a couple of
things like BSD Networking/sockets that we would have to implement
first.
