1) The file is kernel/chr_drv/keyboard.S.  keyboard.s is made during
   recompilation.

2) This used to be on the FAQ list.

3) One of the first changes I made the first time I recompiled the
   kernel:

   a)  In keyboard.S, delete the line '#define KBD_FINNISH'.

   b)  In the same directory, in the Makefile, add at the top
       a default line 'KB =FINNISH', and after the keyboard.s: keyboard.S
       line, insert the word '-DKBD_$(KB)' before keyboard.S.

   c)  In the main Makefile, two directories up, change the original
       line to '(cd kernel/chr_drv; make KB=$(KB))'
       and insert at the top 'KB = US' or UK or FR or whatever.

You need to have . in your path.  I don't recommend putting . in root's
path though.  Too easy to run something you didn't mean to.  If you're
root and you want to run something in the current directory, use "./something".

Dunno, sounds like a bug unless you have "x" access, in which case being
able to cd but unable to ls is the correct behavior.

This *could* be written in the kernel, ya know.  linux supports a variety
of VGA display cards -- why not 386SX notebook computers?

It might be better to make that one a loadable device driver, though.  In
fact, why not make the VGA drivers loadable drivers?  Make a generic one
for bootup, and the real one gets loaded after the kernel starts up.

   Well, I've decided this isn't my day.  Thanks to all who wrote
me.  Since this morning, I have installed Linux twice!  Once
because I got the gcc (2.00) compiler working but ran out of swap
memory (I was compiling df.c  !).  So, brillant me decide to play
with the mkswap program(s).  Well, I did a 

  mkswap /dev/hda2
    (  It said it wanted a device name  )

Well, bad MOVE!  In a few minutes I had a totally trashed file system
with no idea how to repair it.  :)  I got a kernel panic (my first)
and fsck said "bad magic number in superblock"..  I found this very
funny.  :)

Second, I did a "find" and told it to exec tar xf...  Bad Move 2.
It untarred everything in my root.. EVERYTHING!  So, I'm starting
completely from scratch.  I'll get just the needed soures and 
binaries to function.  Maybe I can get somewhere except backup
heaven.  *grin*

Anyway,  one question.  (well two)
  Where can I get a binary of ps (process status)?  My roommate
  could not get it to compile either on his machine.

  And how do you fix file system problems?  I rm(ed) my swap
file that I managed to get on the second try and had a little
fun with fsck.. :)

Again, thanks to all who answered.
Wish my luck on install number 6!

Try setting up your CMOS wiyh the Power-On defaults if you have an AMI BIOS,
that is turn off/down your wait states for the bus, etc...  Also, turn off
the BIOS and VIDEO Shadow options.  Basically, don't tweak and push your
machine too much.  This works for me (386/33/64).

Subject: mtools... drive c: doesn't work in Linux 0.95a...??
Date: 25 Mar 92 04:12:24 GMT


There's much more interesting things going on for Linux 0.95a I
know, but, (heh) I've got to get gcc2.0 and the libs are larger
than my 5 1/4"/1.2M floppy drive disks can hold. I was used to
(under Linux 0.12) just downloading things to the DOS box and
then using Mtools to copy it over to my Linux partition...
Now I can't read drive c: (/dev/hda1) (don't suggest me trying
to read /dev/hda for this stuff, as I did once in the 0.12 and
had mangled my DOS FAT tables and had to reformat the drive
and reload everything, luckily I've got x2WD 40Mb IDE's, one
for DOS, one for Linux)... can't Mtool anything to drive
/dev/at1 either...hmmmmm....
Is there some reason that things have changed at all in this
regards?

I'm trying to set everything up, plus walk a friend through the
process and add all of the steps in the (DOS) Beginner's Guide...
so any suggestions will get documented.

    I've heard about this xmindows (called X386?) that works on
many of the other unix(s) out there.  Has anyone heard of this too?
I've been wanting something like xmindows, actually anything that
will let be display graphics.  (I don't know enough about any unix
to figure out how to access and modify the IO prevl. map for the
386)

    I've found just about very thing on linux that my DOS
can do except graphics... (DOS has better interfaces for word
processing about I can live without it for now... :)

PS.  I think it is written entirely in assembly.

Thanks,
Dan

For folks using the dos-rawrite/linux-tar-x method I'd recommend leaving the
files compressed and wrapping them in another tar file before Rawrite-ing them
onto the floppy -- this allows you to fit larger files and more than one at
a time.  If you do this wrapping on a unix box instead of under dos it even
preserves the file names for you.
