This is interesting. I came across the same problem and fixed it by

        PUSH    0FFFFFFF0H
        MOV     AX,0
        MOV     CR0,AX
        RET
to the reboot routine in keyboard.S

This works. I doubt that the address fffffff0 is right. (I got it from
some book on the 386 as the address that it starts execution from.
Looking at it , it is definately wrong. it should be ffff000. )
The mov cr0, ax simply moves the cpu back to real mode. It bashs a few
other things on the way, none of which are important. (crossed

The code above does this. NOTE. gas doesn't know about cr0 as far as I

        0x0f, 0x22, 0xc0 (I think. from memory. U will want to check
        this)

BTW, as far as I can see a non 386/486 specific solution doesn't make sense.
Linux only runs on the 386/486. 32 bit protected mode doesn't exist on
any other 80x86 chip.

Main problem here is that (This is hersey, correct if I am wrong) sync()
only schedules the buffers for writing, and the buffers may not

The best solution here is to throw away the control-alt-del and write a
reboot program. /etc/shutdown is a good idea. ;)

This might be relevant for some of these problems.  SunOS 4.x has a mutant
SYSV compatibility.  For instance, there is a big difference between the
BSD echo command and the SYSV echo command.  They have 2 versions of echo -
the BSD version is in /usr/bin, and the SYSV version is in /usr/5bin .
If you want to use the SYSV style of commands you put /usr/5bin in your 
path variable.  BTW, /usr/5bin has ls, chmod, pg, od, stty, sed, tr,
df, date - quite a few SYSV versions of unix commands.

I don't know if this would work, but maybe have a /usr/noposixbin directory,
put a suid root chown in there, and then put that /usr/noposixbin high in your
search path.

OK, so I'm happily scribbling out a graphics device driver, /dev/fb we can

If you had looked in keyboard.S you would have found

It might be unfortunately that the sources default to finish.

REBOOT(2)                 SYSTEM CALLS                  REBOOT(2)
NAME
     reboot - reboot system or halt processor
SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/reboot.h>

     reboot(howto, [ bootargs ] )
     int howto;
     char *bootargs;

DESCRIPTION
     reboot() reboots the system, and is invoked automatically in
     the event of unrecoverable system failures.  howto is a mask
     of options passed to the bootstrap program.  The system call
     interface  permits  only RB_HALT or RB_AUTOBOOT to be passed
     to the reboot program; the other flags are used  in  scripts
     stored  on  the  console  storage  media,  or used in manual
     bootstrap procedures.   When  none  of  these  options  (for
     instance  RB_AUTOBOOT) is given, the system is rebooted from
     file /vmunix in the root file system of unit  0  of  a  disk
     chosen  in  a  processor  specific  way.   An automatic con-
     sistency check of the disks is then normally performed.

     The bits of howto are:

     RB_HALT        the processor is  simply  halted;  no  reboot
                    takes  place.   RB_HALT  should  be used with
                    caution.

     RB_ASKNAME     Interpreted by the bootstrap program  itself,
                    causing  it to inquire as to what file should
                    be booted.  Normally, the  system  is  booted
                    from the file /vmunix without asking.

     RB_SINGLE      Normally, the reboot  procedure  involves  an
                    automatic  disk  consistency  check  and then
                    multi-user  operations.   RB_SINGLE  prevents
                    the  consistency check, rather simply booting
                    the system with a single-user  shell  on  the
                    console.   RB_SINGLE  is  interpreted  by the
                    init(8) program in the newly booted system.

     RB_DUMP        A  system  core  dump  is  performed   before
                    rebooting.

     RB_STRING      The optional argument bootargs is  passed  to
                    the  bootstrap  program.   See  boot(8S)  for
                    details.  This option overrides RB_SINGLE but
                    the  same effect can be achieved by including
                    -s as an option in bootargs.
     Only the super-user may reboot() a machine.

RETURN VALUES
     On success,  reboot()  does  not  return.   On  failure,  it
     returns -1 and sets errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     EPERM          The caller is not the super-user.

FILES
     /vmunix

SEE ALSO
     panic(8S), halt(8), init(8), intro(8), reboot(8)

Are you sure you have been FTP'ing/kermiting in BINARY mode? Quite a few people
(myself included) failed to put 'set fi ty bi' in Kermit, and ended up with
executables that gave segmentation faults or crashed the machine.

Yes.  I'm using binary mode.  I also tried yet another program last
night (less) and it, too, gave a segmentation fault.  I even
re-uploaded the executable and ran `diff' to make sure there was no
corruption.  Maybe my machine just doesn't like me.

I remeber some one suggesting me this (may be it is you Peter. No this is not
a flame on you. Actually, thanks for sharing the knowledge). But I would
really warn every one to actually do some digging around (to make sure that
addresses are correct etc.) before actually coding this into keyboard.S. The
reason for this is that the last time I did this it messed up my CMOS and
screwed up the setting (The next hard boot promptly put me in setup
complaining that CMOS is corrupted, and it was). Of course, I didn't want to
mess around too much so I gave up fixing Cntrl-alt-delete all together. But, I
did write to Linus to include a working reboot system call (I mean that does
not depend on the keyboard reset taking the processor out of protected mode
etc.)

Check the number of waitstates being used for memory, io.  Should be AT 
LEAST 1 on a cache miss.  Also check bus speed.  

Your configuration could have been lost due to weak batteries, etc.

tcsh, bash, newer versions of csh, ksh all do file name completion.  Standard
Bourne Shell does not. Filename completion is not a standard 'Unix' thing - 
although all of the more popular shells support it.

If the working directory of any process is that directory, it cannot 
be removed.  You just aren't getting the correct error message.

Rebooting will kill off the process that has that directory as its wd.  
Logging out should cause all of your foreground process to be killed, 
and if that's what's in the directory...

Could be a number of things.  a20 must be disabled when reset occurs - 
that could be it.  As you say, the keyboard chip *does* control a lot 
of things, and has outputs to a lot of signals.

Not as simple as it sounds, but workable.  Protected->real means
1.  Jump to an address where physical address = virtual address.
2.  Disable paging 
3.  Have a valid interrupt descriptor table
4.  Enter real mode

make a sync() call.

I can confirm there is a problem with the -O parameter. I ran into it
twice while trying to compile the latest pax code. Again the workaround
is to not use optimization.

By the way, anybody else looking at pax. I've got it compiled and working.
It creates multi-volume tar files, but when I try to restore the files,
I get a corrupted archive error at the end of the first disk. Ah well,
it works just fine for single disk archives, tar and cpio.

High Gurus,

I know this is another fucking FAQ,
but I hope that someone would answer.

I heard about Linux, as a free Unix. Is that true PD :-)
Is there a distributer in europe ? Perhaps in gemany ?
Is Linux like Minix with 64KB-limit ?
Is there a TCP/IP-NFS-X Window for Linux ?
How much memory and diskspace does Linux require ?
Is it posible to run OMF or COFF aplications ?

Gibt es einen Deutschen der Linux benutzt ?

Hi there,

I'm sure this is a FAQ but it isn't covered in the Linux Information Sheet
so here goes anyway.

Can Linux and DOS coexist on the same IDE drive in different partitions?
If so, how do I boot up or run Linux?  

Another question:

How many different partitions are recommended  on a hard drive and what
is  the recommended size of each of those partitions.

Thanks in advance.

If you're talking about floppy disks, there's a kernel bug. At the end
of the disk, it returns EIO instead of end of file.  Could that be
your problem?  I believe the fix has been posted.  I'm at Rutgers
rather than at home, so I can't give you the fix, but it's an obvious
goof in the block I/O read routine.

I am trying to compile original gawk-2.13 source.  I created my own
config file which has BLKSIZE_MISSING, RANDOM_MISSING, and STDC_HEADERS.
Everything compiles without warnings except some complaints about
assigning const char *'s to char *'s, and the lack of a prototype for
popen() (I supplied the missing prototype, but why is it
missing anyway?).  When I tested the executable with some trivial stuff
it seems to work, but all the test programs that come with the gnu
distribution fail.  In particular, when awf formats text it comes out
without any control characters, and the rand() builtin always returns 0.
What am I missing?  Are there different warning levels with gcc?  If I
turn up the warning level will I be overwhelmed with pages of warnings?
