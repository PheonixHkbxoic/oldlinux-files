I had the same problem. My second drive wouldn't mount at all
(may be it would have, if I had waited long enough) and the noise
was quite fearsome. Shiver.

If you want to run 0.95a, you can do this by compiling it with the
hard disk driver from version 0.95. It works fine. However, if anyone
has ideas about how to fix this little problem, I'd be delighted to
hear them.

   I thought the voting was over a long time ago but this group still
   hasn't appeared.

No, actually the voting just ended yesterday at 7:00 EST (0:00 UTC).  (I
suspect you were confusing the 1 month discussion period with the 1
month voting period.)  

I'm currently in San Deigo attending a conference, so is rather
inconvenient for me to make sure all of the votes are correct and to
eliminate duplicates, etc.  I plan to do that Tuesday or Wednesday,
after I return to Boston.  After the voting results are posted, there
must be a five day waiting period while people can verify the votes and
complainin about any voting anamolies.  After the waiting period, *then*
the newsgroup can be created.

Although I have not double checked all of the addresses of people who
have voted to eliminate duplicates, I have done a first pass over the
votes, and the unofficial results is roughly 850 yes votes and 5 no
votes.  So it is extremely likely that the comp.os.linux newsgroup
*will* be created.  Just please be patient while we work through the
formalities in the next week or two.

Hi, folks!

Well, Coherent finally failed me (small-model compiler won't do what I
need), so I thought, "This looks like a job for Linux!", and went out
and got a bunch of things off tsx-11 (boot, root, gcc (I think :),
emacs...).

0.95a boots like a dream on my 486-33 (4 meg, Trident svga), actually
asks me about SVGA modes and even WAITS FOR ME TO ANSWER! Gosh, I
thought, this is fantastic! I even got kermit working. Great work,
Linus and everyone involved!

I have only two problems (the first of which must be a FAQ, but I
couldn't find it in the FAQ :)

1) What do I need to do to get my hda4 partition mounted as / at boot
time?

2) Deals with gcc. I'm not completely sure what all I need to run gcc
1.40. I got newlibc.tar and newgcc.tar from tsx-11 and installed them,
but when I try to compile a little "#include <stdio.h> main()
{puts("Hi, world.");}", I get the following mystifying output:

general protection: 0000
EIP:    000f:00000180

Pid: 93, process nr: 10
10 89 55 fc 8b 45 fc 80 38 2d
Program received fatal signal 93

At first I thought, "I wonder what signal 93 is?" then noticed that in
the "fatal signal xx" the "xx" is always the same as the PID. Anyone
willing to help me out? (BTW, I'm not exactly what you call a Unix
hacker, but I'm willing, nay, veritably eager, to learn!:)

Thanks in advance,

        I'm amazed at the quality of help I've been getting here - better
support than any software company I've ever had to deal with.  Thanks,
really.  

But, I'm still having a few minor problems:



1) My "make" doesn't work.  It says "error executing binary:  cannot
execute binary file" or words to that effect.  The permissions are fine.
 I had this same problem with gcc until I moved it to /usr/local/bin
(and it works fine now), but make won't work *anywhere*.

2)  Is there any way to transfer files over to linux besides using
mtools or tar??  I'd like to rawrite my emacs.Z file onto a floppy and
the uncompress it, but it doesn't seem to work.

3) I have 0.95 running fairly well, but I'd like to upgrade to .95a. 
How can I update the kernel without destroying the partition?  (or won't
mkfs destroy it?)

4) I'd like to get Linux, DOS, and OS/2 v1.3 running on the same drive. 
Right now I have 3 primary partitions (80, 62, 60mb) with DOS on the
first and identical Linux partitions on the second (in case I destroy
one :-] ).  Is there any way to put OS/2 on the 2nd or 3rd partition? 
The installation program is fairly brain-dead.
It seems like I should move my DOS partition to my 2nd primary, and just
let OS/2 do it's thing on the 1st partition.  EXCEPT - it says in the
manual that if I install HPFS on a partition that I won't be able to
access any partitions after it!  yikes..
Anybody have a setup like this?  Should I just wait for 2.0??



Thanks in advance..

Subject: Something writes kernel memory where it shouldn't
Date: 20 Mar 92 20:12:46 GMT

I picked up .95a kernel sources, threw in my SCSI drivers, and 
ocassionally programs would segfault.  At an address in the 0x0008 
segment.  This is kernel memory, in a SYS call.

I figured, hey, I screwed something up, flipped the configuration file
macros so SCSI wouldn't be built, and it worked fine.  So, I put SCSI
back in, but never initialized it, so everything in data, and BSS would
be nudged up to where it was being corrupted, but it couldn't be 
the SCSI.  Same problem.  I traced the problem back to the code
fragment 


83 78 08, at address 0008:00012269.  Same thing EVERY time, irregardless
of the program running.

The address is unimportant, but 
I used that to get an object file, decided that the sys_write
function was where it was segfaulting, disassembled the code by hand 
and came up with cmpl $0, 8($eax), searched for that in the 
assembler output, and translated back to 'C' to come up with this 
line, in the dereferencing of the file_operations structure.


assembler output
 
L48:
        cmpl $0,12(%ecx)
        je L49
        movl 12(%ecx),%eax
        cmpl $0,8(%eax)
        je L49


'C'

        if (file->f_op && file->f_op->write)
                return file->f_op->write(inode,file,buf,count);

        

Fails here at file->f_op->write dereference.  The SCSI code was just
big enough to move things just enough so that this got corrupted, instead of 
something else, more insidious.  

This could also explain a lot of other little quircks that 
go on  - I guess I'm just lucky enough to have gotten a segfault 
instead of some other more insidious error.


This brings up some important issues : 

Linux NEEDS a kernel debugger.  Being able to do stack 
backtraces, etc would REALLY help track down the problem.  Also,
the die() code in traps.c should be changed so that ALL registers
are dumped out, as these (eax was being used as an index in this
case), will help track down the problem.

At least until Linus is 100% stable, it should check for valid data
structures wherever possible.  Seeing if f_op was minix_operations,
and panicing there if it wasn't would have saved some trouble.

I can't read debug dumps fast enough - and they sometimes fly off
the screen.  A good thing that should be done would be to 
make printk() print to a user (perhaps syscall) selectable device -
like a printer.

Also, implementing a pause key that freezes the kernel would be nice 
for debugging too.  How about a sysreq invoked kernel debugger?  
The debug registers would make this really convienient.

Well, recompiling with the hd.c from 0.95 (not a) worked just fine--my drive
is no longer making ugly sounds.

I'm having some ps woes, though--the kernel patches went OK (swap.c I had to
do by hand, but no biggee), and the kernel recompiled fine, but when I try
to compile ps, I get all the .o files fine.  Then I

gcc -o ps ps.o psdata.o update_db

and it gags and dies with


ps.o: Undefined symbol __cytpe referenced from text segment
ps.o: Undefined symbol __ctype referenced from text segment
cmdline.o: Undefined symbol __ctype referenced from text segment

What's going wrong?

Linuxites,

        I am attempting to write a guide for programming on linux,
more a porting software, patching the kernel manual than actual 
programming. It should contain sufficient information for someone with a
knowledge of programming to be able to port software. I.e. common gcc switches
using make, what to link as to, etc. I have an extensive outline and shold be
able to get a draft done this weekend. (promises, promises :-)) 
        In an attempt to disprove, "Those who can do, those who can't write
documentation", I have been working on porting textutils-1.3 and
fileutils-3.1, and have discovered that there seem to be some 
#defines missing from include/sys/*h, or atleast gnu expects to find 
some things there. BSIZE (blocksize ?) and NINDIR (something about 
blocks per Inode but I haven't quite figured it out.)
        If instead of just telling me BSIZE = 1024 or something similar,
which solves one problem, you told me somewhere where this info could be 
found I would'nt have to bother you again.
        Also some info on where gnu docs gan be obtained without
the accompanying code would also be useful.  
        Any useful experiences any one has had porting things would be 
appreciated.

                Thanks,
                   Deinst.


P.S. Why do the optimizations allowed by combine-regs keep the kernel from
crashing? This baffles me.

It's not a bug, it's a feature. :-) The new login program sets XON/XOFF
flow controll in all the terminals. So ^S stops the screen from
scrolling, and ^Q restores scrolling. Work around: M-X save-file works
(type ESC X save-file ENTER). Fix, get stty from tsx-11 and disable
XON/XOFF, or recompile poe-IGL 1.2 to do the same.

If you could afford a PS/2 you can certainly afford the money for a real 386
or 486. There are many 486's under $2000 now and they will blow the PS/2
away. You might even be able to sell your PS/2 to some gullible person for 
enough to buy a real machine :-)

Hi,

I hate to waste bandwidth, but... :)  I've successfully
installed basic linux on my pc (finally!) and have noticed
a few nagging problems.  One is the refusal of the filesystem
to run in 33MHz on my 486. Its a major bummer to have to 
resort to 8 and loose all that potential (uncompress is a
*chore* ).  Does anyone have any suggestions? The other thing
is the lack of other niceties, such as job control, and the
inability of kermit to escape back to linux, which obviously
prevents me from using kermit (Not a bad idea, but when its 
all you have :)  Keep up the excellent work, Linus!

PLEESE, let's not start holy wars, not here in alt.os.linux.  The fact is that
PS/2s with 32-bit MCA can transfer data across the bus at up to 40Mb per
second.  That completely obliterates the ISA bus, which usually clocks around
4Mb/sec if I remember right, and even beats the EISA bus (which I use) that
gets 33Mb/sec on a good day.

Fact is, for disk intensive 32-bit OS, this is likely to more than make up for
the extra power you can get out of a faster processor.

If you need raw horsepower, get a clone.  If you need the fast bus, get a
PS/2, or if you can stand the headaches, get EISA.

If you can't accept more than one architecture, get lost (lots of :->s).
