Booted up into linux from floppy, getting 2 sets of about 7 HD timeouts
in the process.
Then tried fdisk (twice) :

1st fdisk

HD timeout harddisk I/O error
dev 0300, block 0

HD timeout Disk 1 :
/dev/hdb1 : 43545 blocks 16-bit DOS (>=32M)
/dev/hdb5 : 834086032 blocks disk-manager active? (74) unknown
partition type 0x52


2nd fdisk

Disk 0 :
/dev/hda3 : 82101 blocks active unknow partition type 0xc6
/dev/hda4 : 45390 blocks unknown partition type 0xc5

Disk 1 :
/dev/hdb1 : 43545 blocks 16-bit DOS (>=32M)
/dev/hdb5 : 834086032 blocks disk-manager active? (74) unknown
partition type 0x52


Now tried mkfs :

mkfs -c /dev/hdb1 43545

14515 inodes
43545 blocks
Firstdatazone = 464 (464)
Zonesize = 1024
Maxsize = 268966912

mkfs : bad blocks before data area : cannot make fs


Now I tried physically disconnecting my 1st drive (the ST1144A) and
making my ST157A the one and only drive.

Boot up from floppy, no problems, fdisk works, make file system, it 
works.  Install root onto /dev/hda1, it works!!!

Logout, boot into DOS from floppy, load up Norton, change the 508th
bytes to 01 03.  Reboot, whatdya know, IT WORKS!!!!!


Now it all goes wrong, tried putting everything back to normal, ie
ST1144A is drive 0, ST157A (linux /dev/hda1) is drive 1.

Boot into DOS from HD, no problem, load up Norton change the 508th
to 41 03 to reflect the fact that the linux is on /dev/hdb1.
As in INSTALL-0.95a

Boot into linux,

root sytem not found,
kernel panic

or words to that effect.

The machine now hangs.

Reset, change boot disk 508th byte to 00 00.

Reboot, 2 loads of HD timeouts

try fdisk :

HD timeoutHD timeout ........

HD timeoutHD timeout ........

for both drives.

I am now stuck,  I don't know what more to do.

PLEASE HELP ME!

Scott.

I second this emotion (8-) and would like to ask the following question:

  HAS ANYONE FOUND ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE CURRENT VERSION OF 2.1(beta)?

If not, I am going to use it as the base for the ABC Release of Linux .95a
which I hope to have available by this Friday.

    Thanks to those of you that submitted code to me for the release!

   Dell still charges $399 for their proprietary-format 4M SIMM.  :-((((

Can't you get third-party ones cheaper?  (Not telling you to -- just
curious...)  If you can't, that's one strike against buying dell...

Yeah, but you have to buy 4 x 4-Meg simms to work on a 32bit machine.

After shipping that's around $500.  But, you can buy 4 1-Meg Simms, if 
you still have slots left.

If you are booting with shoelace, with a /vmunix or whatever, you will
probably have installed winiboot, or a similar primary bootblock. At boot
up, this will prompt you for which partition you want to boot - and 
will timeout to provide a default.

winiboot is similar to the OS/2 bootmanager.

If you are booting the kernel off of floppy (slow), simply insert the 
bootimage floppy when you want Linux, DOS or nothing when you 
want DOS to come up.

This is incorrect.  DOS will only support one "DOS primary partition".  
Current versions of FDisk will create "one DOS primary partition, and
one DOS extended partition".  Using an alternate partition editor 
will allow you to create all four partitions.  Mark the partition as 
something other than DOS - 0x81 "Minix" is traditionally used because that
is the file system we are currently using.

Subject: Linux Drivers and Kernel question.
Date: 6 Apr 92 20:08:38 GMT

Is there an ethernet driver in the works?  along with patches to ka9q to
make ethernet work? 

How about multiterminal boards?  I've got a Digichannel PC/xi 16port serial
board... I don't have docs, and I haven't the foggiest where to begin to
write a driver for it.  Anyone else out there have neat hardware like this too?
..didn't think so. oh well.    

is there a "Driver Hackers FAQ" out there somewhere to aide those people 
who want to add their custom hardware? 

Kernel question: I'm running 0.95.  i still haven't gotten around to installing
0.95a, as it doesn't offer me much... however, all the kernel patches don't
work for 0.95.  now we're up to 0.95c (in patch form only,..)   is there a way
I can just download the root/boot image disks and do some quick and dirty 
manipulation to grab the new kernel without having to rebuild the entire system?
..no, i don't have the kernel source online yet..  it's a real low priority..
I'm still looking for a complete working Unix enviornment before I go patching
away at the kernel.  ( I came to Linux from SVR4, not dos.. I want that level
of functionality! :-) 
 
Oh...  yet another question.. is anyone working on X windows for Linux?  It does
not have to be X11r5 or anything... older r3 or r4 is plenty of functionality 
at least to start out with..   somewhere i saw someone complaining that it 
reqiured 300 megs to compile X and several days of time....  there's gotta be
*someone* out there with enough space to produce one good working binary.. 
X isn't something you need to have the source online for, IMHO... once it's 
working, leave it alone..  (No, i'm obviously not an X junkie.. i just need
xv and some other graphics manipulation tools and that's it. virtual consoles
are faster than point-and-click)

Subject: mtools (mcopy) problems
Date: Sun, 05 Apr 92 11:25:56 GMT

I'm having some problems with mtools, specifically mcopy from tsx-11.mit.edu.
I've created the /etc/mtools file correctly (A /dev/at0, b /dev/PS1, c /dev/
hd4 -16) and mdel, mdir, mcat, etc. work fine except for mcopy.

mcopy does nothing at all - when I type mcopy c:/gcc-1.40/gccinfo.1 gccinfo.1
nothing happens. I can "mcat" the file and I can view it, but I can't
copy it to my Linux directory.

(BTW I'm still running Linux 0.12 if it's relevant.)

Thanks in advance...

I believe that the adduser should use a random salt, so that you do not
normally get the same encrypted password for the same input password.

However, for login to work, you need to get the same encryped password for
the same input password, so you need to use the salt in the password file
for the user you are checking against.  Adduser should be adding a completely
new account, so there is no existing password entry to check.  The password
changing program should also choose a new salt for the new password.

        In reading through this informative post, I discovered only one real
major error. In the table where you point out the minor numbers of the hard disk partitions, there is an error that should be corrected.:

>>>
        For a hard disk the major number (offset 509) is always 3, and the
    minor number (offset 508) is a combination of primary or secondary HD
        drive and partition details (see FAQ for details). Here are the details

    Device      Major    Minor       Device      Major    Minor
    ------      -----    -----       ------      -----    -----
    /dev/hda1     3        1         /dev/hdb1     3        65
    /dev/hda2     3        2         /dev/hdb2     3        66
    /dev/hda3     3        3         /dev/hdb3     3        67
    /dev/hda4     3        4         /dev/hdb4     3        68

    /dev/hda7     3        7         /dev/hdb7     3        71
    /dev/hda8     3        8         /dev/hdb8     3        72

>>>>

        In the second set of device numbers, the drive major number should be
4 with the minor numbers as 1 through 8. This is for a second disk drive
on a system, using single or multiple partitions. 

        This should clear up any problems people might be having accessing
second drives.

        See you all around.

When I worked repairing these PC we could sometimes add a second controller
and drive, sometimes it didn't work.  The only way to be sure is try it.  The
WD controller should have a jumper to make it a secondary controller.  I'm
not sure if they put those on the IDE controllers.

Not counting X11 I'm up to about 20 MB for my linux system.  That includes
man, mtools, GCC and GNU Emacs.  The only other stuff is stuff that I consider
core Unix, ie, grep find etc.

*** 169,179 ****
  utilities get an error from kernel saying something about binary file
  format?
  
! ANSWER: Linux has changed a.out.h. The new a.out.h is compatible with
! the applications compiled with the old a.out.h. But if an application is
! compiled with the new a.out.h, you have to use the new a.out.h. If you
! get this error message, you should get the new a.out.h and old ld from
! where you get this and use them to recompile the kernel.
  
  QUESTION: Why does g++ complain?

  utilities get an error from kernel saying something about binary file
  format?
  
! ANSWER: Linux has changed a.out.h. The new a.out.h in Linus' second
! patch is compatible with the applications compiled with the old
! a.out.h. But if an application is compiled with the new ld which uses
! the new a.out.h, you have to use the kernel compiled with the new
! a.out.h. You have to recompile the kernel with Linus' second patch
! applied and old ld. And then use new ld to compile the programs.
