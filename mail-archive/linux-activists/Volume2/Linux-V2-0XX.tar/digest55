I'm about to buy a new machine, in which I will run mainly Linux. I
have an attractive offer of a 486 machine that has Microgram
motherboard with local bus (directly on the motherboard) SVGA card
with a S3 chip. That is supposed to be a very fast configuration, and
popular with (blech) MS-Windows. But I'm not sure if I should buy this
card, since it's new and I anticipate it won't be among the first cards
that the Linux (or BSD) X servers will have drivers to. So, should I
buy a tried and true ET4000 card instead?

I would appreciate a general comment on graphics cards from the
people who are working on Linux's graphics, since it might shed light
for others also.

I use SCM at home on my linux box. It is pretty painless to get it to
compile.

I would rather use that instead of a big hog as scheme-7.1. SCM also 
adheres to the R4RS and the IEEE standard.

You can ftp SCM sources from "the Scheme repository" at nexus.yorku.ca.

Reply-To: ulan@ee.ualberta.ca (Dale Ulan)

Compiling the kernel with GCC1.40 does not seem to work any more.

Yesterday, I wrote about problems with compilation of 0.95c+ 
under GCC1.40.

Last night I switched to GCC2.1, and the kernel compiled fine
(just very slowly... I've only got 2 meg of RAM).
The only problem I had was with the include files from /usr/include
for build.c
I ended up commenting out a whole bunch of lines from stdlib.h,
starting with mblen and ending with wcstombs.
(parse errors in that area).  (at 3am it's easier than trying to
fix the include files :-) )

In any case, it now works, so perhaps the GCC1.40 provision could 
be taken out of the makefile...

I tried reading the kernel code, but I guess I'm not much of a kernel
hacker, what I was wondering was about the 'mismatched parent link'
and the 'os' and 'ys' warnings.... and why they happen.... or am I
the only one that gets those?

I've got a terrible problem. I installed gcc-2.1 again today, and
suddenly "make" quit working entirely. It says "No system rules
(/usr/share/mk/sys.mk)". Does anyone know what's going on? It's true
there isn't even a directory /usr/share, but I don't know where such a
directory would come from in the first place. It wasn't in the gcc
distribution. And even my old non-shared-libs version of pmake doesn't
work (same error). Also, my previous four or five installations of
gcc-2.1 went fine, and everything worked.

Thanks for any advice,

Subject: Local Bus support?

I am posting this for a friend:

Hello netters.  I was just curious as to whether or not LINUX supports
32-bit local bus cards, such as 32-bit video cards and/or disk controllers.
This is _not_ the same as EISA.  I understand that programs running over
the bios have no problem, but since LINUX manipulates the hardware directly
I wasn't sure.

Please reply to me or this newsgroup and I'll forward the responses
accordingly.

I see that a bootimage for 0.95c+ has arrived on tsx-11, will there be a
corresponding rootimage file?  (Linus's message said he would post a new
kernel, but didn't the patches since 0.95a also involve stuff in rootimage?)

Hi,

There is a bug in strtod.c, which is taken from glibc.a 1.02. The

I saw someone (I forget who) say that expr is part of the gnu shell
utilities v1.6.  This is great, but I don't know where to find
it/them.  I'm getting an error message while making the 0.95c+ kernel
(although I still get a bootable image) so I would guess that expr has
already been ported to Linux.

(Thanks to everyone who told me where to find dd two weeks ago.)

i inadvertantly  compiled  mount using shared libs. /usr is a mounted
partition on my machine, so i couldn't mount anything or run any
program using shared libs. is there any reason why i can't copy the

i compiled 0.95c+ without any changes whatsoever using gcc 2.1. i was,
however, running a 95c kernel which had also been compiled with gcc
2.1 if that makes any difference. i haven't had any problems with
either linux or the compiler that seem to be related to that.

I have a 16550 on my second serial port and have major problems with Linux
grabbing incomming data.  I have a modem connected to the port, and I 
see that characters are sent, but I never see any echo.  The modem
lights for RX bink on command completion (eg, OK), but kermit does
not show modem response.  Ideas?

Hi, folks.

There's an embryonic project underway to collect/write a reasonably
coherent User's Guide to Linux. I include here an excerpt of recent
discussion from the man-page mailing list, and invite comments on the
plan outlined. We're especially looking for comments / criticism /
volunteerism on the following points:

1) Do you think there is a need for such a document?

2) Does the organization outlined seem reasonable? Should it be
expanded/changed? I know it's a bit vague at the moment, but it can't
be made less so without feedback...

3) Would you be willing to contribute a chapter on a particular
subject or software package? This is important --- the level of
technical expertise among those of us on the manpage list is, in many
cases, not sufficient to turn out the sort of documentation we're
lookin' to compile. We can, however, make sure that documentation is
edited into a readable-for-beginners form without distorting the
content. So we need help from the real experts.

Post, or send email to jknapka@aisun2.ai.uga.edu. 

Thanks,  

Joseph

    Recently I have tried to keep up with the current Linux releases but 
trying to find the most up to date software, applying patches, and other
things has had me fall behind...I have a few questions about the ABC release
1. how will it be released?  rawrite images, tar.Z files?
2. what will be in it?
3. will it be multiple files, I know i would like to put it all on 
   1.2 meg floppies for ease of re-installing,  that is my major gripe
   with the recent release of the 2.6 meg binaries file.
  
     I'm really having fun playing with linux,  keep up the good work..

Yes, I think such a document would be rather valuable.

Linux is great.. what more could a hacker ask for?
But we could make the results of the same work accessible to
a much larger class of users if we add "a little" effort
on documentation and easy-to-use installation/administration.
