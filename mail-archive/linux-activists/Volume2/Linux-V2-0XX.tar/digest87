I just downloaded the root and boot images and am having a few problems.
I decompressed the files and then rawrited them to 1.2 MB disks, this is where
the 1st problem is.  When I rawrite the root disk it aborts with the message:
Adress Mark Not Found.  It almost looks like the root image is bigger than
a 1.2 meg disk. (not by much though)  I tried to run linux anyway ands it seems
to work fine.  Also, Unix utilities like CAT and others are not included, do I 
have to get those separatly, and if I do then will t I need to partition my
hardrive to use them.  The root disk is already to full the way it is.
I know that these are novice questions, but hey I am a novice Unix user :-)

Thanks for any advice

Hi,

After reading the FAQ about as86 (Bruce Evan's assembler) I decided to
get it.  Is it a PC program?!! Can't seem to run it.  Also, where can
I get the source and/or documentation for the assembler?  Can someone
tell me why this assembler rather than other commercial assemblers
(i.e., Borland and MS) was used and if anyone has  translated the
assembler source for these latter assemblers?

Many thanks,

Okay, this is a semi-stupid question, BUT...  I've looked all over for
docs for the patch util - can't find any, anywhere (I probably just
didn't look hard enough, but...)  Can somebody tell me what the format
for patching diffs is?  For example, I have the 2.1kernel.tar.Z
patches to apply to my 0.95c source code (in /usr/src/linux) - how do
I patch the untared/uncompressed file into whatever it's supposed to
be patched into?  Same goes with the svga autoset patch...

E-mail would be nice since it appears as if everybody reading this
group except me already knows how to do this :-)

OBTW Linus: Linux is way, way, way heavily great.

Thanks for any help anybody wants to give in advance,

Date: 17 Apr 92 06:22:33 GMT

Okay, I have the new 0.95c+ kernel compiled and running, using
gcc2.1...  Everything seems to work fine.  Today I tried to install
the svga autoset patch that was posted here a few days ago.  It
installed fine, and the kernel compiled and ran fine, with one slight
hitch: it didn't set the mode to the one I wanted.  I have a paradise
512K card, and upon bootup I am usually given the choice of two modes:
0, which is 132x25, or 1, which is 132x43.  I use mode 0 exclusively,
because my crummy monitor makes 132x43 come out hideously fuzzy.  So I
followed the instructions on the patch and set -DSVGA_MODE=0 in the
top level make file, and it worked fine, the system didn't stop on
bootup to ask me what mode I wanted, but it defaulted to standard
80x24 text mode :-(  I recompiled using the MODE=1 option, and it
worked - it came up in 132x43, as expected, only unfortunately hard to
read.  So I think the problem has something to do with using a ZERO as
the mode number in the patch.  Does anybody have any ideas/hints I
could follow towards working at a solution?

Oh, my other question.  I also just tonight downloaded, patched, and
compiled the mouse cut/paste system SELECTION 1.0.  Everything patched
and compiled fine once again, only this time I found myself looking
frantically through my /dev directory for a tty0 (the readme describes
it as "current tty") entry.  I don't have one.  Does anybody know the
correct mknod command to create one, or how I can go about getting a
/dev/tty0 into my system?  Thanks very much for any help...

Reply-To: ted@nmsu.edu



dynamic linking does not have to involve running bin/ld.


in the linux context, the only thing that has to be dynamicly linked
are the standard libraries.  this can easily be done without either
the overhead of running ld, or the current kludge of staticly linking
programs with a stubs library pointing to a reserved part of virtual
memory. 

the simplest approach is to just use a jump table and plug the stubs
into the jump table.  this way, the actual version of the library can
change, and as long as the jump table is compatible, things will work
just fine.  the startup routine in crt0 can even check to make sure
that the currently visible jump table is a compatible version.

on the other hand, true dynamic linking can also be done quite
handily.  all that has to be done is make the stubs a bit more
intelligent.  in particular, let each stub know its own name and write
a procedure which will resolve the jump table as needed.  each stubs
library would have its own jump table in which all entries initially
point to a routine which resolves that entry and then calls the new
entry.  all subsequent calls would be directed through the jump table.

but in fact, i can't see any compelling reasons why the first option
isn't just as acceptable as the second.  it does feel a bit more
static and confining, but i can't see any reason that is a problem
here.

Subject: Question about svga preset patch
Date: 20 Apr 92 07:01:08 GMT

Okay, I got the 0.95c+ kernel patched and compiled with no problem,
and have lp and ps working, and I've nearly got a completely working
Unix system that's faster than just about anything I've seen for an
86-based machine...  Kudos to all working on the project...

Now, a question of whoever (I lost his address) the guy is who wrote
the svga-preset patch.  I patched my source with the patch, and it
compiled and ran fine, with one problem.  My desired svga mode is mode
zero on my machine (paradise video card) - 132x25.  Anything higher
than that (my only other choice is mode one, 132x43) is too fuzzy on
my cheap crummy monitor...  The patch works fine with the video mode
set to one and compiled, but if I set it to zero (my preferred mode),
it compiles and runs, but defaults to standard 80x25 VGA mode.  Is
there any fix available, even if it means patching other sources?
Thanks for any help...

I guess I havent made myself clear. I would like to do something like this,
where I would create a superset of the vt100. But the mode as it is, is
insufficient for the kind of graphics I am talking about. I want to also add
this new mode to the telnet program (when it gets written), so that the
graphics get displayed remotely.

I need some help with partitioning my harddrive - as I don't know
ANYTHING about partitions.  I've made the boot and root disks for
Linux and have decided to run it from my hardrive.  Currently, I have
a 120Meg drive (and just 1 partition).  It was already formatted for
me with DOS 5.0 already installed.  Now - from what I've read -
repartitioning my drive with erase all the data - that's fine, I've
backed everything up.  I take it I'll have to reinstall DOS on my
hardrive (??).  To make it DOS bootable - do I install DOS on the
primary partition?? Will I have to reformat my drive (I really don't
have a clue - the manuals I have are QUITE brief and don't mention
disk partitions at all. :( )  The docs for linux say that I should put
the linux file system on the primary partition - why??? what will
happen if I don't???  From what I've read - I'll need about a 30 Meg
partition for Linux, is this right??? I'll need to run the compiler,
terminal programs (for the modem), and maybe rayshade (has anyone
compiled this for linux??).  The remainder of the drive will go to DOS
as that's what all my software is right now... 
        Getting back to partitioning - should I partition from DOS
with fdisk or from linux with pfdisk(??) What's the difference?? It is
critical that I be able to boot my computer with DOS - any
suggestions, etc would be greatly appreciated as I don't have the
slightest CLUE - and it would be nice to not completely TRASH my
drive. 

Email me as there's no sense in wasting bandwidth on something so
basic.
Thanks in Advance!!

As the proud new owner of a Gateway 2000 386/33 EISA system I would
like to get into the wonderful world of desktop unix.  As BSD's version
seems to be a bit too flakey at the moment, I'd like to install Linux
and have been reading this group for a while getting a feel for some
of the problems I may run into.
 
My setup is the full up Gateway configuration, with a 8514/a Ultra graphics carda 340 meg scsi drive with a 200 and 80 meg dos partion leaving 60 megs free
for a kinder and gentler os.

As far as I can tell, I should be able to run off floppies fine but I'm wondering if anyone has got a machine just like this one going with one of the several scsi patches out there.
 
My eisa scsi card is an Adaptec AHA-1742A currently in non bus mastering
mode and driving my two floppies and the 340 meg hd.

I have a v.32 modem going to an apollo network, so ftping will not be
too much a a problem, but I doubt I'll be able or want to recompile the
kernal unless it's absolutely necessary as I tend to use unix apps rather
than write them.

So, does anyone have this config running ?  Or can provide any hints ?
I'll have to keep the rest of my system (windows 3.1 and Dos) so some
sort of boot block swapping setup would be nice so that I could boot up
from either at will without messing with floppies.
 
Thanks for the help, replies here or my mail address.  If there is an
FAQ for scsi, please point me to it or mail it to me, I haven't seen it
and don't really want to get on any more mailing lists... :)
